<p>Perhaps it was a result quite different from your expectations, that
Mr. David Faux should have returned from the West Indies only a few
years after his arrival there, and have set up in his old business,
like any plain man who has never travelled.  But these cases do
occur in life.  Since, as we know, men change their skies and see
new constellations without changing their souls, it will follow
sometimes that they don't change their business under those novel
circumstances.</p>

<p>Certainly, this result was contrary to David's own expectations.  He
had looked forward, you are aware, to a brilliant career among &quot;the
blacks&quot;; but, either because they had already seen too many white
men, or for some other reason, they did not at once recognize him as
a superior order of human being; besides, there were no princesses
among them.  Nobody in Jamaica was anxious to maintain David for the
mere pleasure of his society; and those hidden merits of a man which
are so well known to himself were as little recognized there as they
notoriously are in the effete society of the Old World.  So that in
the dark hints that David threw out at the Oyster Club about that
life of Sultanic self-indulgence spent by him in the luxurious
Indies, I really think he was doing himself a wrong; I believe he
worked for his bread, and, in fact, took to cooking as, after all,
the only department in which he could offer skilled labour.  He had
formed several ingenious plans by which he meant to circumvent
people of large fortune and small faculty; but then he never met
with exactly the right circumstances.  David's devices for getting
rich without work had apparently no direct relation with the world
outside him, as his confectionery receipts had.  It is possible to
pass a great many bad half pennies and bad half-crowns, but I
believe there has no instance been known of passing a halfpenny or a
half-crown as a sovereign.  A sharper can drive a brisk trade in
this world:  it is undeniable that there may be a fine career for
him, if he will dare consequences; but David was too timid to be a
sharper, or venture in any way among the mantraps of the law.  He
dared rob nobody but his mother.  And so he had to fall back on the
genuine value there was in him - to be content to pass as a good
halfpenny, or, to speak more accurately, as a good confectioner.
For in spite of some additional reading and observation, there was
nothing else he could make so much money by; nay, he found in
himself even a capability of extending his skill in this direction,
and embracing all forms of cookery; while, in other branches of
human labour, he began to see that it was not possible for him to
shine.  Fate was too strong for him; he had thought to master her
inclination and had fled over the seas to that end; but she caught
him, tied an apron round him, and snatching him from all other
devices, made him devise cakes and patties in a kitchen at
Kingstown.  He was getting submissive to her, since she paid him
with tolerable gains; but fevers and prickly heat, and other evils
incidental to cooks in ardent climates, made him long for his native
land; so he took ship once more, carrying his six years' savings,
and seeing distinctly, this time, what were Fate's intentions as to
his career.  If you question me closely as to whether all the money
with which he set up at Grimworth consisted of pure and simple
earnings, I am obliged to confess that he got a sum or two for
charitably abstaining from mentioning some other people's
misdemeanours.  Altogether, since no prospects were attached to his
family name, and since a new christening seemed a suitable
commencement of a new life, Mr. David Faux thought it as well to
call himself Mr. Edward Freely.</p>

<p>But lo! now, in opposition to all calculable probability, some
benefit appeared to be attached to the name of David Faux.  Should
he neglect it, as beneath the attention of a prosperous tradesman?
It might bring him into contact with his family again, and he felt
no yearnings in that direction:  moreover, he had small belief that
the &quot;something to his advantage&quot; could be anything considerable.  On
the other hand, even a small gain is pleasant, and the promise of it
in this instance was so surprising, that David felt his curiosity
awakened.  The scale dipped at last on the side of writing to the
lawyer, and, to be brief, the correspondence ended in an appointment
for a meeting between David and his eldest brother at Mr. Strutt's,
the vague &quot;something&quot; having been defined as a legacy from his
father of eighty-two pounds, three shillings.</p>

<p>David, you know, had expected to be disinherited; and so he would
have been, if he had not, like some other indifferent sons, come of
excellent parents, whose conscience made them scrupulous where much
more highly-instructed people often feel themselves warranted in
following the bent of their indignation.  Good Mrs. Faux could never
forget that she had brought this ill-conditioned son into the world
when he was in that entirely helpless state which excluded the
smallest choice on his part; and, somehow or other, she felt that
his going wrong would be his father's and mother's fault, if they
failed in one tittle of their parental duty.  Her notion of parental
duty was not of a high and subtle kind, but it included giving him
his due share of the family property; for when a man had got a
little honest money of his own, was he so likely to steal?  To cut
the delinquent son off with a shilling, was like delivering him over
to his evil propensities.  No; let the sum of twenty guineas which
he had stolen be deducted from his share, and then let the sum of
three guineas be put back from it, seeing that his mother had always
considered three of the twenty guineas as his; and, though he had
run away, and was, perhaps, gone across the sea, let the money be
left to him all the same, and be kept in reserve for his possible
return.  Mr. Faux agreed to his wife's views, and made a codicil to
his will accordingly, in time to die with a clear conscience.  But
for some time his family thought it likely that David would never
reappear; and the eldest son, who had the charge of Jacob on his
hands, often thought it a little hard that David might perhaps be
dead, and yet, for want of certitude on that point, his legacy could
not fall to his legal heir.  But in this state of things the
opposite certitude - namely, that David was still alive and in
England - seemed to be brought by the testimony of a neighbour, who,
having been on a journey to Cattelton, was pretty sure he had seen
David in a gig, with a stout man driving by his side.  He could
&quot;swear it was David,&quot; though he could &quot;give no account why, for he
had no marks on him; but no more had a white dog, and that didn't
hinder folks from knowing a white dog.&quot;  It was this incident which
had led to the advertisement.</p>

<p>The legacy was paid, of course, after a few preliminary disclosures
as to Mr. David's actual position.  He begged to send his love to
his mother, and to say that he hoped to pay her a dutiful visit by
and by; but, at present, his business and near prospect of marriage
made it difficult for him to leave home.  His brother replied with
much frankness.</p>

<p>&quot;My mother may do as she likes about having you to see her, but, for
my part, I don't want to catch sight of you on the premises again.
When folks have taken a new name, they'd better keep to their new
'quinetance.&quot;</p>

<p>David pocketed the insult along with the eighty-two pounds three,
and travelled home again in some triumph at the ease of a
transaction which had enriched him to this extent.  He had no
intention of offending his brother by further claims on his
fraternal recognition, and relapsed with full contentment into the
character of Mr. Edward Freely, the orphan, scion of a great but
reduced family, with an eccentric uncle in the West Indies.  (I have
already hinted that he had some acquaintance with imaginative
literature; and being of a practical turn, he had, you perceive,
applied even this form of knowledge to practical purposes.)</p>

<p>It was little more than a week after the return from his fruitful
journey, that the day of his marriage with Penny having been fixed,
it was agreed that Mrs. Palfrey should overcome her reluctance to
move from home, and that she and her husband should bring their two
daughters to inspect little Penny's future abode and decide on the
new arrangements to be made for the reception of the bride.  Mr.
Freely meant her to have a house so pretty and comfortable that she
need not envy even a wool-factor's wife.  Of course, the upper room
over the shop was to be the best sitting-room; but also the parlour
behind the shop was to be made a suitable bower for the lovely
Penny, who would naturally wish to be near her husband, though Mr.
Freely declared his resolution never to allow HIS wife to wait in
the shop.  The decisions about the parlour furniture were left till
last, because the party was to take tea there; and, about five
o'clock, they were all seated there with the best muffins and
buttered buns before them, little Penny blushing and smiling, with
her &quot;crop&quot; in the best order, and a blue frock showing her little
white shoulders, while her opinion was being always asked and never
given.  She secretly wished to have a particular sort of chimney
ornaments, but she could not have brought herself to mention it.
Seated by the side of her yellow and rather withered lover, who,
though he had not reached his thirtieth year, had already crow's-
feet about his eyes, she was quite tremulous at the greatness of her
lot in being married to a man who had travelled so much - and before
her sister Letty!  The handsome Letitia looked rather proud and
contemptuous, thought her nature brother-in-law an odious person,
and was vexed with her father and mother for letting Penny marry
him.  Dear little Penny!  She certainly did look like a fresh white-
heart cherry going to be bitten off the stem by that lipless mouth.
Would no deliverer come to make a slip between that cherry and that
mouth without a lip?</p>

<p>&quot;Quite a family likeness between the admiral and you, Mr. Freely,&quot;
observed Mrs. Palfrey, who was looking at the family portrait for
the first time.  &quot;It's wonderful! and only a grand-uncle.  Do you
feature the rest of your family, as you know of?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't say,&quot; said Mr. Freely, with a sigh.  &quot;My family have mostly
thought themselves too high to take any notice of me.&quot;</p>

<p>At this moment an extraordinary disturbance was heard in the shop,
as of a heavy animal stamping about and making angry noises, and
then of a glass vessel falling in shivers, while the voice of the
apprentice was heard calling &quot;Master&quot; in great alarm.</p>

<p>Mr. Freely rose in anxious astonishment, and hastened into the shop,
followed by the four Palfreys, who made a group at the parlour-door,
transfixed with wonder at seeing a large man in a smock-frock, with
a pitchfork in his hand, rush up to Mr. Freely and hug him, crying
out, - &quot;Zavy, Zavy, b'other Zavy!&quot;</p>

<p>It was Jacob, and for some moments David lost all presence of mind.
He felt arrested for having stolen his mother's guineas.  He turned
cold, and trembled in his brother's grasp.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, how's this?&quot; said Mr. Palfrey, advancing from the door.  &quot;Who
is he?&quot;</p>

<p>Jacob supplied the answer by saying over and over again -</p>

<p>&quot;I'se Zacob, b'other Zacob.  Come 'o zee Zavy&quot; - till hunger prompted
him to relax his grasp, and to seize a large raised pie, which he
lifted to his mouth.</p>

<p>By this time David's power of device had begun to return, but it was
a very hard task for his prudence to master his rage and hatred
towards poor Jacob.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know who he is; he must be drunk,&quot; he said, in a low tone
to Mr. Palfrey.  &quot;But he's dangerous with that pitchfork.  He'll
never let it go.&quot;  Then checking himself on the point of betraying
too great an intimacy with Jacob's habits, he added &quot;You watch him,
while I run for the constable.&quot;  And he hurried out of the shop.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, where do you come from, my man?&quot; said Mr. Palfrey, speaking to
Jacob in a conciliatory tone.  Jacob was eating his pie by large
mouthfuls, and looking round at the other good things in the shop,
while he embraced his pitchfork with his left arm, and laid his left
hand on some Bath buns.  He was in the rare position of a person who
recovers a long absent friend and finds him richer than ever in the
characteristics that won his heart.</p>

<p>&quot;I's Zacob - b'other Zacob - 't home.  I love Zavy - b'other Zavy,&quot; he
said, as soon as Mr. Palfrey had drawn his attention.  &quot;Zavy come
back from z' Indies - got mother's zinnies.  Where's Zavy?&quot; he added,
looking round and then turning to the others with a questioning air,
puzzled by David's disappearance.</p>

<p>&quot;It's very odd,&quot; observed Mr. Palfrey to his wife and daughters.
&quot;He seems to say Freely's his brother come back from th' Indies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a pleasant relation for us!&quot; said Letitia, sarcastically.  &quot;I
think he's a good deal like Mr. Freely.  He's got just the same sort
of nose, and his eyes are the same colour.&quot;</p>

<p>Poor Penny was ready to cry.</p>

<p>But now Mr. Freely re-entered the shop without the constable.
During his walk of a few yards he had had time and calmness enough
to widen his view of consequences, and he saw that to get Jacob
taken to the workhouse or to the lock-up house as an offensive
stranger might have awkward effects if his family took the trouble
of inquiring after him.  He must resign himself to more patient
measures.</p>

<p>&quot;On second thoughts,&quot; he said, beckoning to Mr. Palfrey and
whispering to him while Jacob's back was turned, &quot;he's a poor half-
witted fellow.  Perhaps his friends will come after him.  I don't
mind giving him something to eat, and letting him lie down for the
night.  He's got it into his head that he knows me - they do get
these fancies, idiots do.  He'll perhaps go away again in an hour or
two, and make no more ado.  I'm a kind-hearted man MYSELF - I
shouldn't like to have the poor fellow ill-used.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, he'll eat a sovereign's worth in no time,&quot; said Mr. Palfrey,
thinking Mr. Freely a little too magnificent in his generosity.</p>

<p>&quot;Eh, Zavy, come back?&quot; exclaimed Jacob, giving his dear brother
another hug, which crushed Mr. Freely's features inconveniently
against the stale of the pitchfork.</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, aye,&quot; said Mr. Freely, smiling, with every capability of
murder in his mind, except the courage to commit it.  He wished the
Bath buns might by chance have arsenic in them.</p>

<p>&quot;Mother's zinnies?&quot; said Jacob, pointing to a glass jar of yellow
lozenges that stood in the window.  &quot;Zive 'em me.&quot;</p>

<p>David dared not do otherwise than reach down the glass jar and give
Jacob a handful.  He received them in his smock-frock, which he held
out for more.</p>

<p>&quot;They'll keep him quiet a bit, at any rate,&quot; thought David, and
emptied the jar.  Jacob grinned and mowed with delight.</p>

<p>&quot;You're very good to this stranger, Mr. Freely,&quot; said Letitia; and
then spitefully, as David joined the party at the parlour-door, &quot;I
think you could hardly treat him better, if he was really your
brother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've always thought it a duty to be good to idiots,&quot; said Mr.
Freely, striving after the most moral view of the subject.  &quot;We
might have been idiots ourselves - everybody might have been born
idiots, instead of having their right senses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know where there'd ha' been victual for us all then,&quot;
observed Mrs. Palfrey, regarding the matter in a housewifely light.</p>

<p>&quot;But let us sit down again and finish our tea,&quot; said Mr. Freely.
&quot;Let us leave the poor creature to himself.&quot;</p>

<p>They walked into the parlour again; but Jacob, not apparently
appreciating the kindness of leaving him to himself, immediately
followed his brother, and seated himself, pitchfork grounded, at the
table.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Miss Letitia, rising, &quot;I don't know whether YOU mean to
stay, mother; but I shall go home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, me too,&quot; said Penny, frightened to death at Jacob, who had
begun to nod and grin at her.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I think we HAD better be going, Mr. Palfrey,&quot; said the
mother, rising more slowly.</p>

<p>Mr. Freely, whose complexion had become decidedly yellower during
the last half-hour, did not resist this proposition.  He hoped they
should meet again &quot;under happier circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's my belief the man is his brother,&quot; said Letitia, when they
were all on their way home.</p>

<p>&quot;Nonsense!&quot; said Mr. Palfrey.  &quot;Freely's got no brother - he's said
so many and many a time; he's an orphan; he's got nothing but
uncles - leastwise, one.  What's it matter what an idiot says?  What
call had Freely to tell lies?&quot;</p>

<p>Letitia tossed her head and was silent.</p>

<p>Mr. Freely, left alone with his affectionate brother Jacob, brooded
over the possibility of luring him out of the town early the next
morning, and getting him conveyed to Gilsbrook without further
betrayals.  But the thing was difficult.  He saw clearly that if he
took Jacob himself, his absence, conjoined with the disappearance of
the stranger, would either cause the conviction that he was really a
relative, or would oblige him to the dangerous course of inventing a
story to account for his disappearance, and his own absence at the
same time.  David groaned.  There come occasions when falsehood is
felt to be inconvenient.  It would, perhaps, have been a longer-
headed device, if he had never told any of those clever fibs about
his uncles, grand and otherwise; for the Palfreys were simple
people, and shared the popular prejudice against lying.  Even if he
could get Jacob away this time, what security was there that he
would not come again, having once found the way?  O guineas!  O
lozenges! what enviable people those were who had never robbed their
mothers, and had never told fibs!  David spent a sleepless night,
while Jacob was snoring close by.  Was this the upshot of travelling
to the Indies, and acquiring experience combined with anecdote?</p>

<p>He rose at break of day, as he had once before done when he was in
fear of Jacob, and took all gentle means to rouse this fatal brother
from his deep sleep; he dared not be loud, because his apprentice
was in the house, and would report everything.  But Jacob was not to
be roused.  He fought out with his fist at the unknown cause of
disturbance, turned over, and snored again.  He must be left to wake
as he would.  David, with a cold perspiration on his brow, confessed
to himself that Jacob could not be got away that day.</p>

<p>Mr. Palfrey came over to Grimworth before noon, with a natural
curiosity to see how his future son-in-law got on with the stranger
to whom he was so benevolently inclined.  He found a crowd round the
shop.  All Grimworth by this time had heard how Freely had been
fastened on by an idiot, who called him &quot;Brother Zavy&quot;; and the
younger population seemed to find the singular stranger an
unwearying source of fascination, while the householders dropped in
one by one to inquire into the incident.</p>

<p>&quot;Why don't you send him to the workhouse?&quot; said Mr. Prettyman.
&quot;You'll have a row with him and the children presently, and he'll
eat you up.  The workhouse is the proper place for him; let his kin
claim him, if he's got any.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Those may be YOUR feelings, Mr. Prettyman,&quot; said David, his mind
quite enfeebled by the torture of his position.</p>

<p>&quot;What! IS he your brother, then?&quot; said Mr. Prettyman, looking at his
neighbour Freely rather sharply.</p>

<p>&quot;All men are our brothers, and idiots particular so,&quot; said Mr.
Freely, who, like many other travelled men, was not master of the
English language.</p>

<p>&quot;Come, come, if he's your brother, tell the truth, man,&quot; said Mr.
Prettyman, with growing suspicion.  &quot;Don't be ashamed of your own
flesh and blood.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Palfrey was present, and also had his eye on Freely.  It is
difficult for a man to believe in the advantage of a truth which
will disclose him to have been a liar.  In this critical moment,
David shrank from this immediate disgrace in the eyes of his future
father-in-law.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Prettyman,&quot; he said, &quot;I take your observations as an insult.
I've no reason to be otherwise than proud of my own flesh and blood.
If this poor man was my brother more than all men are, I should say
so.&quot;</p>

<p>A tall figure darkened the door, and David, lifting his eyes in that
direction, saw his eldest brother, Jonathan, on the door-sill.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll stay wi' Zavy,&quot; shouted Jacob, as he, too, caught sight of his
eldest brother; and, running behind the counter, he clutched David
hard.</p>

<p>&quot;What, he IS here?&quot; said Jonathan Faux, coming forward.  &quot;My mother
would have no nay, as he'd been away so long, but I must see after
him.  And it struck me he was very like come after you, because we'd
been talking of you o' late, and where you lived.&quot;</p>

<p>David saw there was no escape; he smiled a ghastly smile.</p>

<p>&quot;What! is this a relation of yours, sir?&quot; said Mr. Palfrey to
Jonathan.</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, it's my innicent of a brother, sure enough,&quot; said honest
Jonathan.  &quot;A fine trouble and cost he is to us, in th' eating and
other things, but we must bear what's laid on us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And your name's Freely, is it?&quot; said Mr. Prettyman.</p>

<p>&quot;Nay, nay, my name's Faux, I know nothing o' Freelys,&quot; said
Jonathan, curtly.  &quot;Come,&quot; he added, turning to David, &quot;I must take
some news to mother about Jacob.  Shall I take him with me, or will
you undertake to send him back?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take him, if you can make him loose his hold of me,&quot; said David,
feebly.</p>

<p>&quot;Is this gentleman here in the confectionery line your brother,
then, sir?&quot; said Mr. Prettyman, feeling that it was an occasion on
which format language must be used.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want to own him,&quot; said Jonathan, unable to resist a
movement of indignation that had never been allowed to satisfy
itself.  &quot;He ran away from home with good reasons in his pocket
years ago:  he didn't want to be owned again, I reckon.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Palfrey left the shop; he felt his own pride too severely
wounded by the sense that he had let himself be fooled, to feel
curiosity for further details.  The most pressing business was to go
home and tell his daughter that Freely was a poor sneak, probably a
rascal, and that her engagement was broken off.</p>

<p>Mr. Prettyman stayed, with some internal self-gratulation that HE
had never given in to Freely, and that Mr. Chaloner would see now
what sort of fellow it was that he had put over the heads of older
parishioners.  He considered it due from him (Mr. Prettyman) that,
for the interests of the parish, he should know all that was to be
known about this &quot;interloper.&quot;  Grimworth would have people coming
from Botany Bay to settle in it, if things went on in this way.</p>

<p>It soon appeared that Jacob could not be made to quit his dear
brother David except by force.  He understood, with a clearness
equal to that of the most intelligent mind, that Jonathan would take
him back to skimmed milk, apple-dumpling, broad beans, and pork.
And he had found a paradise in his brother's shop.  It was a
difficult matter to use force with Jacob, for he wore heavy nailed
boots; and if his pitchfork had been mastered, he would have
resorted without hesitation to kicks.  Nothing short of using guile
to bind him hand and foot would have made all parties safe.</p>

<p>&quot;Let him stay,&quot; said David, with desperate resignation, frightened
above all things at the idea of further disturbances in his shop,
which would make his exposure all the more conspicuous.  &quot;YOU go
away again, and to-morrow I can, perhaps, get him to go to Gilsbrook
with me.  He'll follow me fast enough, I daresay,&quot; he added, with a
half-groan.</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Jonathan, gruffly.  &quot;I don't see why YOU shouldn't
have some trouble and expense with him as well as the rest of us.
But mind you bring him back safe and soon, else mother'll never
rest.&quot;</p>

<p>On this arrangement being concluded, Mr. Prettyman begged Mr.
Jonathan Faux to go and take a snack with him, an invitation which
was quite acceptable; and as honest Jonathan had nothing to be
ashamed of, it is probable that he was very frank in his
communications to the civil draper, who, pursuing the benefit of the
parish, hastened to make all the information he could gather about
Freely common parochial property.  You may imagine that the meeting
of the Club at the Woolpack that evening was unusually lively.
Every member was anxious to prove that he had never liked Freely, as
he called himself.  Faux was his name, was it?  Fox would have been
more suitable.  The majority expressed a desire to see him hooted
out of the town.</p>

<p>Mr. Freely did not venture over his door-sill that day, for he knew
Jacob would keep at his side, and there was every probability that
they would have a train of juvenile followers.  He sent to engage
the Woolpack gig for an early hour the next morning; but this order
was not kept religiously a secret by the landlord.  Mr. Freely was
informed that he could not have the gig till seven; and the
Grimworth people were early risers.  Perhaps they were more alert
than usual on this particular morning; for when Jacob, with a bag of
sweets in his hand, was induced to mount the gig with his brother
David, the inhabitants of the market-place were looking out of their
doors and windows, and at the turning of the street there was even a
muster of apprentices and schoolboys, who shouted as they passed in
what Jacob took to be a very merry and friendly way, nodding and
grinning in return.  &quot;Huzzay, David Faux! how's your uncle?&quot; was
their morning's greeting.  Like other pointed things, it was not
altogether impromptu.</p>

<p>Even this public derision was not so crushing to David as the
horrible thought that though he might succeed now in getting Jacob
home again there would never be any security against his coming
back, like a wasp to the honey-pot.  As long as David lived at
Grimworth, Jacob's return would be hanging over him.  But could he
go on living at Grimworth - an object of ridicule, discarded by the
Palfreys, after having revelled in the consciousness that he was an
envied and prosperous confectioner?  David liked to be envied; he
minded less about being loved.</p>

<p>His doubts on this point were soon settled.  The mind of Grimworth
became obstinately set against him and his viands, and the new
school being finished, the eating-room was closed.  If there had
been no other reason, sympathy with the Palfreys, that respectable
family who had lived in the parish time out of mind, would have
determined all well-to-do people to decline Freely's goods.
Besides, he had absconded with his mother's guineas:  who knew what
else he had done, in Jamaica or elsewhere, before he came to
Grimworth, worming himself into families under false pretences?
Females shuddered.  Dreadful suspicions gathered round him:  his
green eyes, his bow-legs had a criminal aspect.  The rector disliked
the sight of a man who had imposed upon him; and all boys who could
not afford to purchase, hooted &quot;David Faux&quot; as they passed his shop.
Certainly no man now would pay anything for the &quot;goodwill&quot; of Mr.
Freely's business, and he would be obliged to quit it without a
peculium so desirable towards defraying the expense of moving.</p>

<p>In a few months the shop in the marketplace was again to let, and
Mr. David Faux, alias Mr. Edward Freely, had gone - nobody at
Grimworth knew whither.  In this way the demoralization of Grimworth
women was checked.  Young Mrs. Steene renewed her efforts to make
light mince-pies, and having at last made a batch so excellent that
Mr. Steene looked at her with complacency as he ate them, and said
they were the best he had ever eaten in his life, she thought less
of bulbuls and renegades ever after.  The secrets of the finer
cookery were revived in the breasts of matronly house-wives, and
daughters were again anxious to be initiated in them.</p>

<p>You will further, I hope, be glad to bear, that some purchases of
drapery made by pretty Penny, in preparation for her marriage with
Mr. Freely, came in quite as well for her wedding with young Towers
as if they had been made expressly for the latter occasion.  For
Penny's complexion had not altered, and blue always became it best.</p>
