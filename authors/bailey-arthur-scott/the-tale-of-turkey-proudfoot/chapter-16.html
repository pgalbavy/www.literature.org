<p>Turkey Proudfoot was not always content to stay in the farmyard.
Although Farmer Green fed him well, he liked to range over the fields in
search of extra tidbits, such as grain, seeds and insects. Sometimes he
wandered even as far as the pasture. And one day he strayed into the
edge of the woods beyond the pasture fence.
</p>
<p>There he discovered a beech tree. And Turkey Proudfoot was enjoying the
nuts that he found on the ground beneath it when all at once a
<u>thump-thump-thump</u> startled him. He raised his head and listened. The
thumping sound came faster and faster, then died away in a rumble.
</p><p>"Ho! It's only Johnnie Green drumming. Probably his mother wouldn't let
him drum near the farmhouse, so he came to the woods where she couldn't
hear him."
</p><p>Turkey Proudfoot paid no more heed to the drumming, which rolled through
the woods now and then. He went on with his search for beechnuts. But at
last a thought popped into his head. "Johnnie Green must be eating most
of the time, or he'd drum oftener," Turkey Proudfoot muttered. "He must
have found a beech tree."
</p><p>Soon Turkey Proudfoot decided to join Johnnie Green. He hoped that
beechnuts were more plentiful beneath Johnnie's tree. So Turkey
Proudfoot picked his way slowly through the underbrush. And guided by
the <u>thump-thump-thump</u> which once in a while boomed upon his ears, at
last Turkey Proudfoot came into a little clearing.
</p><p>There on a log sat a speckly, feathered, short-necked gentleman with a
tail spread in much the fashion in which Turkey Proudfoot so often
carried his own.
</p><p>Turkey Proudfoot drew back behind a bush, out of sight.
</p><p>"I'll show that bird a tail that <u>is</u> a tail," he muttered to himself.
So he spread his tail and then stepped proudly forth. A dry twig snapped
beneath his weight. At that sound the stranger on the log turned his
head quickly. Just for an instant there was an eager look on his face.
But when he beheld Turkey Proudfoot it changed to one of
disappointment.
</p><p>"Who are you?" the stranger asked in none too pleasant a tone.
</p><p>"I'm Turkey Proudfoot," said the ruler of the farmyard. "I live down the
hill at Farmer Green's place."
</p><p>"Then you'd better go home where you belong," said the stranger on the
log. "I was expecting some one. I've been drumming for a friend. And
when I heard you step on that dry twig I thought she'd come. I had my
tail spread in her honor."
</p><p>"Drum again!" Turkey Proudfoot ordered. "Call your friend at once and
I'll show her a tail that is a tail. Yours is no bigger than Mrs.
Green's fan."
</p><p>The stranger made no move to obey. He appeared somewhat sulky.
</p><p>"What's your name?" Turkey Proudfoot demanded.
</p><p>"I'm Mr. Grouse," the stranger snapped out. "I supposed everybody in
Pleasant Valley knew me. My drumming is famous."
</p><p>"Indeed!" said Turkey Proudfoot. "I thought it was Johnnie Green making
that noise."
</p><p>"No wonder!" Mr. Grouse sniffed. "You're only a barnyard fowl. You can't
be expected to know anything about us game birds."
