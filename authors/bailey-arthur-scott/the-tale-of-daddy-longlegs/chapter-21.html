<p>IN common with all the other youngsters that went to school in the
little red school-house, Johnnie Green thought that Daddy Longlegs and
every one of his relations had a strange power.
</p>
<p>Yes! Johnnie believed that if you happened to be lost in the woods, you
would need only to find Daddy Longlegs--or one of his cousins--and he
would point out the way home for you, if you asked him. Or if you wanted
to recover something you had lost, you could surely find it with the
help of any one of Daddy Longlegs' family.
</p><p>So that was the reason why Johnnie Green was glad to see Daddy just at
that time. Having lost his new jackknife, Johnnie was determined that
Daddy should tell him where to find it.
</p><p>"Now, you listen to me!" Johnnie commanded, frowning severely at Daddy.
"I've dropped my knife somewhere and you must point towards it if you
want me to let you go.
</p><p>"I'll tell you what it's like," he continued, "so you won't make any
mistake. It has two blades, and a saw, and a corkscrew, and a gimlet,
and a leather-punch, and a hook to use on a horse's hoof. It's the best
knife I've ever owned. And I'd be pretty angry if you sent me off the
wrong way to find a jackknife that wasn't nearly so good."
</p><p>Now, Daddy Longlegs was angry himself. He thought that Johnnie Green
had no business to make him a prisoner. And as for knowing where the
lost knife was, he hadn't the faintest idea where it could be.
</p><p>"I can't tell you anything about your old jackknife!" Daddy cried. (It
was really a new knife, as Johnnie had explained to him. But you must
remember that Daddy Longlegs was in a terrible temper.)
</p><p>Unfortunately Daddy's voice was entirely too tiny for Johnnie Green to
hear. And meanwhile Daddy continued to tug and twist, trying to free
himself from Johnnie Green's grasp. His eight legs kept reaching out in
all directions for firmer footholds.
</p><p>Silly Johnnie Green thought that he was trying to point the way to the
missing knife!
</p><p>"Stop!" Johnnie cried. "Take your time and don't get excited! If you
keep motioning with all your legs at once you can't expect me to
understand what you mean."
</p><p>Soon after that Daddy became quieter, though it was only because he grew
tired from his efforts to escape. But he was so angry and so worried
that one of his legs kept twitching; and it felt so queer that Daddy
Longlegs had to stretch it again and again.
</p><p>"Ah! That's better!" Johnnie Green exclaimed then. "Now you're pointing
plainly enough. I know now that you're trying to tell me to walk right
towards the sweet apple tree if I want to find my knife. And I'm obliged
to you, Mr. Daddy Longlegs! Thank you very much!"
</p><p>Then Johnnie let go his prisoner, who crept quickly into a crevice of
the stone wall, where he stayed for a long time.
</p><p>As for Johnnie Green, he scrambled spryly over the wall and began to
move in a bee line toward the sweet apple tree. He walked slowly and
searched the ground with great care. But he saw no sign of his precious
knife.
</p><p>Beneath the sweet apple tree Johnnie paused mournfully.
</p><p>"He was only fooling me!" he exclaimed. "That old Daddy Longlegs played
a trick on me!"
</p><p>Johnnie just couldn't help feeling disappointed. And he just couldn't
help feeling hungry as well. Luckily there were apples on the old tree.
So he began to shin up into its branches.
</p><p>And then all at once he saw his beautiful knife sticking into the
tree-trunk right before his eyes.
</p><p>Johnnie remembered then that he had visited the sweet apple tree soon
after breakfast that very day, when he had happened to feel hungry. And
he had stuck the knife there himself and gone off and forgotten it.
</p><p>With a shout of joy he gripped its horn handle and pulled it out.
</p><p>"Old Daddy Longlegs knew what he was about after all!" he shouted.
</p><p>And Johnnie Green never guessed that his finding his jackknife was
nothing but an accident. Daddy had never even seen it. And if he had, he
wouldn't have known what it was.
</p><p>But after that Johnnie was more convinced than ever that Daddy Longlegs
had a strange power.
