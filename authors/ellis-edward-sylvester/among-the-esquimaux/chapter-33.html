<p>No one can question that many animals have the propensity to
fun and frolic. It may be absent in some, but it certainly is
not lacking in the canine species.</p>

<p>It didn't take three teams of dogs long to discover that their
passengers belonged to the most verdant specimens of their kind,
and when the brutes struck the smooth surface, where traveling
was but a pastime, they decided to have some sport at their expense.</p>

<p>At the moment Jack Cosgrove was uttering his words to his young
friends, he failed to notice a small hillock just ahead and at
one side of the course they were following. But the leading dogs
saw it, and, veering off, they made straight for it with increased
speed, heedless of the shouts and cracking of the driver's whip.
Before he could restrain them, the sleigh collided with the obstruction,
overturned in a twinkling and Jack found, as he after described
it, that his nose was plowing through the snow with the whole
plaguey load on top of him.</p>

<p>He was dragged a hundred feet before extricating himself, and
before the driver could check the animals, who looked so meek
and sorrowful that he visited them with slight punishment. Matters,
however, were soon righted and the journey resumed, amid the laughter
of the boys in which the sailor heartily joined.</p>

<p>Within the next hour Rob's sleigh went over and he had an almost
similar experience. But he was expecting something of the kind,
and prepared for it, so that he emerged from underneath before
being dragged far.</p>

<p>Fred got it, too, despite the apparent efforts of the drivers
to restrain the dogs. By the time matters were once more righted
and under way, the suspicion was confirmed among the passengers
that the wild men were in the plot and enjoyed the ludicrous turn
of affairs as much as did the brutes themselves. But Jack and
the lads were the last to complain, and were quite willing that
such good allies should have a little sport at their expense.
It was noticeable that after all had been capsized, nothing of
the kind took place again.</p>

<p>At noon an hour's halt was made. The Esquimaux produced their
cooked venison and all ate. The snow, although it seems to add
to one's thirst, when first used, served excellently in the place
of water.</p>

<p>As well as they could by signs, the passengers offered to walk
and allow the Esquimaux to ride. Where the surface was so favorable
this would have imposed no hard work, but the natives refused,
even declining to ride alternately in the rear sleigh.</p>

<p>The dogs were tired enough to give no trouble during the noon
halt. They sat around on their haunches and eagerly devoured the
bits of raw meat tossed to them. When one or two showed a disposition
to stir up matters, an angry warning and snap of the whip from
one of the drivers brought him to his senses, and he deferred
the amusement to a more convenient season.</p>

<p>The Esquimaux chatted volubly among themselves, and, although
our friends could not catch the meaning of anything said, they
were sure they had made good progress toward Ivigtut, which, barring
accident, would be reached by nightfall.</p>

<p>The journey was pressed with the same vigor through the afternoon,
the men seeming as tireless as the dogs, who trotted along as
they might have done over the bare ground without any load impeding
their movements.</p>

<p>The sun was still above the horizon when the party reached the
crest of the mountains near the coast, and saw before them, nestling
at the curve of a fiord, a collection of low, weather-beaten houses,
dispersed along the slope of the hills, with a wharf at the water's
edge, on which lay a large number of blocks of the peculiar white
ore known as cryolite.</p>

<p>"Vee-tut, vee-tut!" exclaimed one of the drivers, addressing
the passengers with great animation. This was the nearest he was
able to come to pronouncing the name "Ivigtut."</p>

<p>Yes, this was the mining town famous the world over as containing
the only cryolite mines so far discovered on the globe.</p>

<p>Ivigtut is in latitude sixty-one degrees and twelve minutes north,
its climate being severe at certain seasons, but comparatively
moderate during summer. Then there are one hundred and thirty
picked men from Copenhagen engaged in the quarries, the number
being a little more than one-half as great in winter. Only one
or two Esquimaux are to be found about the place, and the only
family that of the superintendent, who has his wife and her maid
with him.</p>

<p>The principal work of the employees is in quarrying the cryolite
and piling it on the wharf, ready for shipment both to the Old
and New World. And now how many of my readers can tell me what
cryolite is? Shall I explain?</p>

<p>Do you know that most of the sal-soda, the bicarbonate of soda,
the alum, and the caustic soda used in your homes is dug out of
a mountain in Greenland?</p>

<p>In 1806, a German named Giesecke, believing that valuable minerals
might be found in Greenland, applied to the Danish Government
for permission to prospect the mountains. He did so, all the way
from Cape Farewell, living with the Danish governors or among
the Esquimaux, as circumstances required, until he reached Arsuk
Fiord.</p>

<p>At this place he heard of a deposit of ice that never melted
and which was on the edge of the fiord. It was powdered, was used
by the natives in tanning skins, and acted on a greasy hide like
soap. The prospector gathered a number of specimens and started
with them for Germany, for the substance was entirely new and
required analysis.</p>

<p>On the homeward voyage the Danish ship was captured by a British
man-of-war and the specimens of cryolite went to an English institution,
where they were analyzed for the first time. It was interesting
of itself, but pronounced comparatively worthless.</p>

<p>It remained for a distinguished chemist named Thomson to discover
that sal-soda and bicarbonate of soda can be made cheaply from
the substance. It is free from all impurities, and steps were
taken to develop the quarry. The first attempt was in 1852, but
regular work did not begin until six years later, and more years
passed before any money was made out of the mine.</p>

<p>Up to 1864 the entire product of the quarry went to Europe. In
that year the American firm known as the Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing
Company, of Natrona and Philadelphia, began to import it. The
ships used are made as strongly as possible, for they have to
force their way through fields of floating ice, craunch into huge
blocks, and keep a sharp lookout for icebergs.</p>

<p>Small quantities of cryolite have been found in the Ural Mountains
and a trace was discovered at Pike's Peak, in our own country,
some years ago, but it did not pan out. A genuine cryolite mine
within easy reach would prove a bonanza to the discoverer.</p>

<p>Cryolite in appearance resembles white quartz or ice, with a
mixture of snow in it. Although generally white, it is not always
so. It is sometimes a light brown or a dark color, due either
to vegetable matter that has soaked into it or the presence of
iron.</p>

<p>What I have related and considerably more, our friends learned
during their stay at Ivigtut.</p>

<p>Finding themselves at the end of their journey, the three climbed
out of the sleighs, their limbs considerably cramped from their
long-constrained posture. They shook hands with the Esquimaux,
who understood that form of salutation, and who grinned the delight
they could not form the words to speak.</p>

<p>To one of them Jack presented his gun and Fred gave his to another.
This quite overwhelmed them, but the whites divided nearly all
the money they had among them between the other two. The wild
men were paid triple what they expected for the inestimable service
rendered the party, who regretted that they could not do a good
deal more for them.</p>

<p>They parted on the edge of the town, and, just as night began
settling over Ivigtut, the three came down the slope and showed
themselves among the employees, where their appearance attracted
considerable curiosity.</p>

<p>Rob's first inquiry was for the superintendent of the mines.
He was directed to a one-story house painted blue, near the rear
of which rose a staff from which the flag of Denmark floated.</p>

<p>At the eastern end of the settlement was a somewhat similar house
painted black, where the comptroller, or representative of the
king lived, while near the centre were two other structures, from
which puffs of steam rose.</p>

<p>The visitors received the kindest hospitality from the superintendent,
whose name was G. E. Schmidt. He listened to their story with
deep interest, and insisted that they should make their home with
him as long as they could stay in Ivigtut. He brought in his wife
and introduced them to her.</p>

<p>They found her a most pleasant lady, and the three soon felt
entirely at home.</p>

<p>"By the way," he asked, as the preparations for supper progressed,
"what did you say was the name of the ship on which you left London?"</p>

<p>"The 'Nautilus,'" replied Rob; "we fear she foundered in the
gale a few days ago which separated us from her."</p>

<p>"I'm not so fearful about that," put in Jack; who felt that such
remarks were a slight upon the ship to which he was attached;
"she has rid out a good many tough storms, and I don't see why
she couldn't pull through that one."</p>

<p>"Let us hope that she did," said the superintendent, kindly,
and with a twinkle of his fine eyes which the others did not notice.</p>

<p>"I was hopeful that she had possibly made her way to Ivigtut,"
added Fred, who continued, turning to the sailor, "we forgot to
take a look in the harbor."</p>

<p>"No use of that," replied Jack; "she might have come in at some
of the other ports, but not here."</p>

<p>"I suppose, Mr. Schmidt, that we can go home by way of Denmark?"</p>

<p>"There will be no trouble about that; the only inconvenience
is that it will extend the trip much longer than is pleasant,
but I understand that you contemplated a visit to one of the posts
of the Hudson Bay Company."</p>

<p>"Yes, the destination of the 'Nautilus' is York Factory."</p>

<p>"Then your friends at home will feel no alarm, since you will
be the first to carry the news there, unless possibly Captain
McAlpine turned immediately about and started for England."</p>

<p>It struck Rob Carrol as singular that the superintendent should
mention the name of the skipper of the "Nautilus" when no one
of the visitors had yet done so. Where could he have learned it?
His companions did not notice the odd fact and he was too polite
to ask their host to explain.</p>

<p>"We rarely receive a visit from the English vessels," continued
Mr. Schmidt, "though now and then one drops down on us, but there
is an American line, inasmuch as a good deal of cryolite goes
to the United States. How would you like to make a voyage to that
part of the country?"</p>

<p>"It would be pleasant, but hardly practicable," replied Rob,
who could not forget that the funds of the company were at a frightfully
low ebb. "We shall have to defer that treat to some more convenient
season."</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you how pleased I am to receive this visit," said
the superintendent; "you must stay several weeks with me, and
visit the mines and see all there is to be seen. I hardly suppose
you would care to make a hunting trip into the interior?" he added,
with a smile.</p>

<p>"No, we have had enough of that to last several lifetimes," replied
Jack, uttering at the same time the sentiments of his friends.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder; there is too much snow and cold weather for
real sport, except at certain seasons. I must see the men who
brought you in. The real wild Esquimaux live on the east coast,
where the climate is so terrible that the whites rarely, if ever,
visit them, and they are beyond the control of all except their
own. If these fellows of yours make their homes in the interior,
they are very different from all the Esquimaux of which I know
anything. I think there is some mistake about it."</p>

<p>"We know nothing, of course, beyond what Docak told us."</p>

<p>"He is an unusually intelligent native, and I know him very well.
He is a little morose at times, and I understand has caused some
trouble at the other settlements, but he is a worthy fellow for
all that. By the way, I have a friend who is expected to supper
with me this evening. It will be a pleasure, I am sure, for you
to meet him."</p>

<p>"It will be a pleasure to meet any of your friends," Rob hastened
to say, for his heart had already warmed to the genial and hospitable
gentleman.</p>

<p>"If I am not mistaken, he has arrived," added Mr. Schmidt, rising
from his chair and stepping to the door.</p>

<p>The next moment he admitted a stalwart, whiskered, sun-browned
man, in middle life, and, shaking his hand, turned to his other
guests.</p>

<p>"Permit me, captain, to introduce you to Messrs. Cosgrove, Carrol,
and Warburton."</p>

<p>"Wal, by the great horned spoon!" exclaimed the sailor, springing
to his feet and striding across the room, "where did you come
from, captain?"</p>

<p>It was Captain McAlpine, of the "Nautilus," standing before them,
smiling, bewildered, and happy, as he gazed into the faces of
his friends whom he had mourned for days under the fear that they
were dead.</p>

<p>The laughing Rob and Fred were right behind Jack, and they shook
the hands of the good old sailor, and felt like throwing their
arms about his neck and hugging him.</p>

<p>"I must apologize for this little joke," said Superintendent
Schmidt, who enjoyed it fully, "but really I couldn't help it.
Captain McAlpine arrived at Ivigtut yesterday, and came straight
to me with news of what had happened. He was driven far away from
the iceberg, as you know, and had searched for it in vain. At
a loss what to do, he put into Ivigtut to consult with me."</p>

<p>By this time the excitement was about over, and all seated themselves
as the servant came in and lighted the lamps. Mr. Schmidt continued:</p>

<p>"The occurrence was so extraordinary that I was at a loss how
to advise him, and his purpose in coming here this evening was
that we might discuss the question and decide it."</p>

<p>"You see," observed the captain (and he thereby verified the
words of Jack Cosgrove, uttered several days before), "I observed
that that iceberg wasn't sailing straight for the Equator, and
I got the idea that it was to be looked for further up north,
though as likely as not it would change its course and head south
again. The only thing for me was to try to get another ship or
two to jine me in a search for you. I was going to find out whether
that could be done, but now there isn't any need of it."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven, no!" fervently responded Rob Carrol; "we have
had a close call, and the only regret we shall feel in leaving
Greenland is that it will take us away from our friends."</p>

<p>"It is I who feel that, but it is one of the sure penalties of
our existence. Supper, I see, is ready; will you kindly walk out
with me?" he asked, rising to his feet, and leading the way.</p>

<p>And perhaps it is as well that we should say good-bye to the
party, now that they are seated around the board with keen appetites,
cheerful conversation, and happy hearts; for of the visit made
to the cryolite mines the next day, the sailing of the "Nautilus"
two days later, the voyage through Hudson Bay to York Factory,
the visit there, the safe return to England, and the settling
down of Rob Carrol and Fred Warburton to the sober business of
life&mdash;why, all these may be covered in a paragraph, and so we
say, "Good-bye."</p>
