<p>Catherine, going downstairs, found Peyrol still at the well.
He seemed to be looking into it with extreme interest.</p>

<p>"Your coffee is ready, Peyrol," she shouted to him from the doorway.</p>

<p>He turned very sharply like a man surprised and came along smiling.</p>

<p>"That’s pleasant news, Mademoiselle Catherine," he said. "You
are down early."</p>

<p>"Yes," she admitted, "but you too, Peyrol. Is Michel about? Let
him come and have some coffee too."</p>

<p>"Michel’s at the tartane. Perhaps you don’t know that she is
going to make a little voyage." He drank a mouthful of coffee
and took a bite out of a slice of bread. He was hungry. He had
been up all night and had even had a conversation with Citizen
Scevola. He had also done some work with Michel after daylight;
however, there had not been much to do because the tartane was
always kept ready for sea. Then after having locked up again Citizen
Scevola, who was extremely concerned as to what was going to happen
to him but was left in a state of uncertainty, he had come up
to the farm, had gone upstairs, where he was busy with various
things for a time, and then had stolen down very cautiously to
the well, where Catherine, whom he had not expected downstairs
so early, had seen him before she went into Lieutenant Réal’s
room. While he enjoyed his coffee he listened without any signs
of surprise to Catherine’s comments upon the disappearance of
Scevola. She had looked into his den. He had not slept on his
pallet last night, of that she was certain, and he was nowhere
to be seen, not even in the most distant field, from the points
of vantage around the farm. It was inconceivable that he should
have slipped away to Madrague, where he disliked to go, or to
the village, where he was afraid to go. Peyrol remarked that whatever
happened to him he was no great loss, but Catherine was not to
be soothed.</p>

<p>"It frightens a body," she said. "He may be hiding somewhere
to jump on one treacherously. You know what I mean, Peyrol."</p>

<p>"Well, the lieutenant will have nothing to fear, as he’s going
away. As to myself, Scevola and I are good friends. I had a long
talk with him quite recently. You two women can manage him perfectly;
and then, who knows, perhaps he has gone away for good."</p>

<p>Catherine stared at him, if such a word as stare can be applied
to a profound contemplative gaze. "The lieutenant has nothing
to fear from him," she repeated cautiously.</p>

<p>"No, he is going away. Didn’t you know it?" The old woman continued
to look at him profoundly. "Yes, he is on service."</p>

<p>For another minute or so Catherine continued silent in her contemplative
attitude. Then her hesitation came to an end. She could not resist
the desire to inform Peyrol of the events of the night. As she
went on Peyrol forgot the half-full bowl of coffee and his half-eaten
piece of bread. Catherine’s voice flowed with austerity. She stood
there, imposing and solemn like a peasant-priestess. The relation
of what had been to her a soul-shaking experience did not take
much time, and she finished with the words, "The lieutenant is
an honest man." And after a pause she insisted further: "There
is no denying it. He has acted like an honest man."</p>

<p>For a moment longer Peyrol continued to look at the coffee in
the bowl, then without warning got up with such violence that
the chair behind him was thrown back upon the flagstones.</p>

<p>"Where is he, that honest man?" he shouted suddenly in stentorian
tones which not only caused Catherine to raise her hands, but
frightened himself, and he dropped at once to a mere forcible
utterance. "Where is that man? Let me see him."</p>

<p>Even Catherine’s hieratic composure was disturbed.</p>

<p>"Why?" she said, looking really disconcerted, "he will be down
here directly. This bowl of coffee is for him."</p>

<p>Peyrol made as if to leave the kitchen, but Catherine stopped
him. "For God’s sake, Monsieur Peyrol," she said, half in entreaty
and half in command, "don’t wake up the child. Let her sleep.
Oh, let her sleep! Don’t wake her up. God only knows how long
it is since she has slept properly. I could not tell you. I daren’t
think of it." She was shocked by hearing Peyrol declare: "All
this is confounded nonsense." But he sat down again, seemed to
catch sight of the coffee bowl and emptied what was left in it
down his throat.</p>

<p>"I don’t want her on my hands more crazy than she has been before,"
said Catherine in a sort of exasperation but in a very low tone.
This phrase in its selfish form expressed a real and profound
compassion for her niece. She dreaded the moment when that fatal
Arlette would wake up and the dreadful complications of life which
her slumbers had suspended would have to be picked up again. Peyrol
fidgeted on his seat.</p>

<p>"And so he told you he was going? He actually did tell you that?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"He promised to go before the child wakes up.... At once."</p>

<p>"But, sacré nom d’un chien, there is never any wind before eleven
o’clock," Peyrol exclaimed in a tone of profound annoyance, yet
trying to moderate his voice, while Catherine, indulgent to his
changing moods, only compressed her lips and nodded at him soothingly.
"It is impossible to work with people like that," he mumbled.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Monsieur Peyrol, that she has been to see the priest?"
Catherine was heard suddenly towering above her end of the table.
The two women had had a talk before Arlette had been induced by
her aunt to lie down. Peyrol gave a start.</p>

<p>"What? Priest?... Now look here, Catherine," he went on with
repressed ferocity, "do you imagine that all this interests me
in the least?"</p>

<p>"I can think of nothing but that niece of mine. We two have nobody
but each other in the world," she went on, reproducing the very
phrase Arlette had used to Réal. She seemed to be thinking aloud,
but noticed that Peyrol was listening with attention. "He wanted
to shut her up from everybody," and the old woman clasped her
meagre hands with a sudden gesture. "I suppose there are still
some convents about the world."</p>

<p>"You and the patronne are mad together," declared Peyrol. "All
this only shows what an ass the curé is. I don’t know much about
these things, though I have seen some nuns in my time, and some
very queer ones too, but it seems to me that they don’t take crazy
people into convents. Don’t you be afraid. I tell you that." He
stopped, because the inner door of the kitchen came open and Lieutenant
Réal stepped in. His sword hung on his forearm by the belt, his
hat was on his head. He dropped his little valise on the floor
and sat down in the nearest chair to put on his shoes, which he
had brought down in his other hand. Then he came up to the table.
Peyrol, who had kept his eyes on him, thought: "Here is one who
looks like a moth scorched in the fire." Réal’s eyes were sunk,
his cheeks seemed hollowed, and the whole face had an arid and
dry aspect.</p>

<p>"Well, you are in a fine state for the work of deceiving the
enemy," Peyrol observed. "Why, to look at you, nobody would believe
a word you said. You are not going to be ill, I hope. You are
on service. You haven’t got the right to be ill. I say, Mademoiselle
Catherine, produce the bottle, you know, my private bottle...."
He snatched it from Catherine’s hand, poured some brandy into
the lieutenant’s coffee, pushed the bowl towards him and waited.
"Nom de nom!" he said forcibly, "don’t you know what this is for?
It’s for you to drink." Réal obeyed with a strange, automatic
docility. "And now," said Peyrol, getting up, "I will go to my
room and shave. This is a great day&mdash;the day we are going to see
the lieutenant off."</p>

<p>Till then Réal had not uttered a word, but directly the door
closed behind Peyrol he raised his head.</p>

<p>"Catherine!" His voice was like a rustle in his throat. She was
looking at him steadily, and he continued: "Listen, when she finds
I am gone you tell her I will return soon. To-morrow. Always to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Yes, my good Monsieur," said Catherine in an unmoved voice but
clasping her hands convulsively. "There is nothing else I would
dare tell her!"</p>

<p>"She will believe you," whispered Réal wildly.</p>

<p>"Yes! She will believe me," repeated Catherine in a mournful
tone.</p>

<p>Réal got up, put the sword-belt over his head, picked up the
valise. There was a little flush on his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Adieu," he said to the silent old woman. She made no answer,
but as he turned away she raised her hand a little, hesitated,
and let it fall again. It seemed to her that the women of Escampobar
had been singled out for divine wrath. Her niece appeared to her
like the scapegoat charged with all the murders and blasphemies
of the Revolution. She herself, too, had been cast out from the
grace of God. But that had been a long time ago. She had made
her peace with Heaven since. Again she raised her hand and, this
time, made in the air the sign of the cross at the back of Lieutenant
Réal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, upstairs Peyrol, scraping his big flat cheek with
an English razor-blade at the window, saw Lieutenant Réal on the
path to the shore; and high above there, commanding a vast view
of sea and land, he shrugged his shoulders impatiently with no
visible provocation. One could not trust those epaulette-wearers.
They would cram a fellow’s head with notions either for their
own sake or for the sake of the service. Still, he was too old
a bird to be caught with chaff; and besides, that long-legged
stiff beggar going down the path, with all his officer airs, was
honest enough. At any rate he knew a seaman when he saw one, though
he was as cold-blooded as a fish. Peyrol had a smile which was
a little awry.</p>

<p>Cleaning the razor-blade (one of a set of twelve in a case) he
had a vision of a brilliantly hazy ocean and an English Indiaman
with her yards braced all ways, her canvas blowing loose above
her blood-stained decks overrun by a lot of privateersmen, and
with the island of Ceylon swelling like a thin blue cloud on the
far horizon. He had always wished to own a set of English blades
and there he had got it, fell over it as it were, lying on the
floor of a cabin which had been already ransacked. "For good steel&mdash;it
was good steel," he thought, looking at the blade fixedly. And
there it was, nearly worn out. The others too. That steel! And
here he was, holding the case in his hand as though he had just
picked it up from the floor. Same case. Same man. And the steel
worn out.</p>

<p>He shut the case brusquely, flung it into his sea-chest, which
was standing open, and slammed the lid down. The feeling which
was in his breast, and had been known to more articulate men than
himself, was that life was a dream less substantial than the vision
of Ceylon lying like a cloud on the sea. Dream left astern. Dream
straight ahead. This disenchanted philosophy took the shape of
fierce swearing. "Sacré nom de nom de nom.... Tonnerre de bon
Dieu!"</p>

<p>While tying his neckcloth he handled it with fury as though he
meant to strangle himself with it. He rammed a soft cap on to
his venerable locks recklessly, seized his cudgel&mdash;but before
leaving the room walked up to the window giving on the east. He
could not see the Petite Passe on account of the lookout hill,
but to the left a great portion of the Hyères Roadstead lay spread
out before him, pale grey in the morning light, with the land
about Cape Blanc swelling in the distance with all its details
blurred as yet and only one conspicuous object presenting to his
sight something that might have been a lighthouse by its shape,
but which Peyrol knew very well was the English corvette already
under way and with all her canvas set.</p>

<p>This sight pleased Peyrol mainly because he had expected it.
The Englishman was doing exactly what he had expected he would
do, and Peyrol looked towards the English cruiser with a smile
of malicious triumph as if he were confronting her captain. For
some reason or other he imagined Captain Vincent as long-faced,
with yellow teeth and a wig, whereas that officer wore his own
hair and had a set of teeth which would have done honour to a
London belle, and was really the hidden cause of Captain Vincent
appearing so often wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>That ship at this great distance and steering in his direction
held Peyrol at the window long enough for the increasing light
of the morning to burst into sunshine, colouring and filling-in
the flat outline of the land with tints of wood and rock and field,
with clear dots of buildings enlivening the view. The sun threw
a sort of halo around the ship. Recollecting himself, Peyrol left
the room and shut the door quietly. Quietly too he descended the
stairs from his garret. On the landing he underwent a short inward
struggle, at the end of which he approached the door of Catherine’s
room and opening it a little, put his head in. Across the whole
width of it he saw Arlette fast asleep. Her aunt had thrown a
light coverlet over her. Her low shoes stood at the foot of the
bed. Her black hair lay loose on the pillow; and Peyrol’s gaze
became arrested by the long eyelashes on her pale cheek. Suddenly
he fancied she moved, and he withdrew his head sharply, pulling
the door to. He listened for a moment as if tempted to open it
again, but judging it too risky, continued on his way downstairs.
At his reappearance in the kitchen Catherine turned sharply. She
was dressed for the day, with a big white cap on her head, a black
bodice and a brown skirt with ample folds. She had a pair of varnished
sabots on her feet over her shoes.</p>

<p>"No signs of Scevola," she said, advancing towards Peyrol. "And
Michel, too, has not been here yet."</p>

<p>Peyrol thought that if she had been only shorter, what with her
black eyes and slightly curved nose she would have looked like
a witch. But witches can read people’s thoughts, and he looked
openly at Catherine with the pleasant conviction that she could
not read his thoughts. He said:</p>

<p>"I took good care not to make any noise upstairs, Mademoiselle
Catherine. When I am gone the house will be empty and quiet enough."</p>

<p>She had a curious expression. She struck Peyrol suddenly as if
she were lost in that kitchen in which she had reigned for many
years. He continued:</p>

<p>"You will be alone all the morning."</p>

<p>She seemed to be listening to some distant sound, and after Peyrol
had added, "Everything is all right now," she nodded, and after
a moment said in a manner that for her was unexpectedly impulsive:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Peyrol, I am tired of life."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and with somewhat sinister jocosity
remarked:</p>

<p>"I will tell you what it is; you ought to have been married."</p>

<p>She turned her back on him abruptly.</p>

<p>"No offence," Peyrol excused himself in a tone of gloom rather
than of apology. "It is no use to attach any importance to things.
What is this life? Phew! Nobody can remember one-tenth of it.
Here I am; and, you know, I would bet that if one of my old-time
chums came along and saw me like this, here with you &mdash;I
mean one of those chums that stand up for a fellow in a scrimmage
and look after him should he be hurt&mdash;well, I bet," he repeated,
"he wouldn’t know me. He would say to himself, perhaps, ‘Hullo!
here’s a comfortable married couple.’"</p>

<p>He paused. Catherine, with her back to him and calling him, not
Monsieur, but Peyrol, <em>tout court</em>, remarked, not exactly
with displeasure, but rather with an ominous accent, that this
was no time for idle talk. Peyrol, however, continued, though
his tone was very far from being that of idle talk:</p>

<p>"But you see, Mademoiselle Catherine, you were not like the others.
You allowed yourself to be struck all of a heap, and at the same
time you were too hard on yourself."</p>

<p>Her long thin frame, bent low to work the bellows under the enormous
overmantel, she assented: "Perhaps! We Escampobar women were always
hard on ourselves."</p>

<p>"That’s what I say. If you had had things happen to you which
happened to me...."</p>

<p>"But you men, you are different. It doesn’t matter what you do.
You have got your own strength. You need not be hard on yourselves.
You go from one thing to another thoughtlessly."</p>

<p>He remained looking at her searchingly, with something like a
hint of a smile on his shaven lips, but she turned away to the
sink, where one of the women working about the farm had deposited
a great pile of vegetables. She started on them with a broken-bladed
knife, preserving her sibylline air, even in that homely occupation.</p>

<p>"It will be a good soup, I see, at noon to-day," said the rover
suddenly. He turned on his heels and went out through the salle.
The whole world lay open to him, or at any rate the whole of the
Mediterranean, viewed down the ravine between the two hills. The
bell of the farm’s milch-cow, which had a talent for keeping herself
invisible, reached him from the right, but he could not see as
much as the tips of her horns, though he looked for them. He stepped
out sturdily. He had not gone twenty yards down the ravine when
another sound made him stand still as if changed into stone. It
was a faint noise resembling very much the hollow rumble an empty
farm-cart would make on a stony road, but Peyrol looked up at
the sky, and though it was perfectly clear, he did not seem pleased
with its aspect. He had a hill on each side of him and the placid
cove below his feet. He muttered "H’m! Thunder at sunrise. It
must be in the west. It only wanted that!" He feared it would
first kill the little breeze there was and then knock the weather
up altogether. For a moment all his faculties seemed paralysed
by that faint sound. On that sea ruled by the gods of Olympus
he might have been a pagan mariner subject to Jupiter’s caprices;
but like a defiant pagan he shook his fist vaguely at space, which
answered him by a short and threatening mutter. Then he swung
on his way till he caught sight of the two mastheads of the tartane,
when he stopped to listen. No sound of any sort reached him from
there, and he went on his way thinking, "‘Go from one thing to
another thoughtlessly’! Indeed!... That’s all old Catherine knows
about it." He had so many things to think of that he did not know
which to lay hold of first. He just let them lie jumbled up in
his head. His feelings too were in a state of confusion, and vaguely
he felt that his conduct was at the mercy of an internal conflict.
The consciousness of that fact accounted perhaps for his sardonic
attitude towards himself and outwardly towards those whom he perceived
on board the tartane, and especially towards the lieutenant, whom
he saw sitting on the deck leaning against the head of the rudder,
characteristically aloof from the two other persons on board.
Michel, also characteristically, was standing on the top of the
little cabin scuttle, obviously looking out for his "maître."
Citizen Scevola, sitting on deck, seemed at first sight to be
at liberty, but as a matter of fact he was not. He was loosely
tied up to a stanchion by three turns of the mainsheet with the
knot in such a position that he could not get at it without attracting
attention; and that situation seemed also somewhat characteristic
of Citizen Scevola with its air of half liberty, half suspicion
and, as it were, contemptuous restraint. The sans-culotte, whose
late experiences had nearly unsettled his reason, first by their
utter incomprehensibility and afterwards by the enigmatical attitude
of Peyrol, had dropped his head and folded his arms on his breast.
And that attitude was dubious, too. It might have been resignation
or it might have been profound sleep. The rover addressed himself
first to the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Le moment approche," said Peyrol with a queer twitch at a corner
of his lip, while under his soft woollen cap his venerable locks
stirred in the breath of a suddenly warm air. "The great moment&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>He leaned over the big tiller, and seemed to be hovering above
the lieutenant’s shoulder.</p>

<p>"What’s this infernal company?" murmured the latter without even
looking at Peyrol.</p>

<p>"All old friends&mdash;quoi?" said Peyrol in a homely tone. "We will
keep that little affair amongst ourselves. The fewer the men,
the greater the glory. Catherine is getting the vegetables ready
for the noonday soup and the Englishman is coming down towards
the Passe, where he will arrive about noon too, ready to have
his eye put out. You know, lieutenant, that will be your job.
You may depend on me for sending you off when the moment comes.
For what is it to you? You have no friends, you have not even
a petite amie. As to expecting an old rover like me&mdash;oh no, lieutenant!
Of course liberty is sweet, but what do you know of it, you epaulette-wearers?
Moreover, I am no good for quarter-deck talks and all that politeness."</p>

<p>"I wish, Peyrol, you would not talk so much," said Lieutenant
Réal, turning his head slightly. He was struck by the strange
expression on the old rover’s face. "And I don’t see what the
actual moment matters. I am going to look for the fleet. All you
have to do is to hoist the sails for me and then scramble ashore."</p>

<p>"Very simple," observed Peyrol through his teeth, and then began
to sing:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Quoique leurs chapeaux sont bien laids<br/>
&nbsp;God-dam! Moi, j’aime les Anglais<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ils ont un si bon caractère!"

</p>
</div>
<p>but interrupted himself suddenly to hail Scevola:</p>

<p>"Hé! Citoyen!" and then remarked confidentially to Réal: "He
isn’t asleep, you know, but he isn’t like the English, he has
a sacré mauvais caractère. He got into his head," continued Peyrol,
in a loud and innocent tone, "that you locked him up in this cabin
last night. Did you notice the venomous glance he gave you just
now?"</p>

<p>Both Lieutenant Réal and the innocent Michel appeared surprised
at his boisterousness; but all the time Peyrol was thinking: "I
wish to goodness I knew how that thunderstorm is getting on and
what course it is shaping. I can’t find that out unless I go up
to the farm and get a view to the westward. It may be as far as
the Rhône Valley; no doubt it is and it will come out of it too,
curses on it. One won’t be able to reckon on half an hour of steady
wind from any quarter." He directed a look of ironic gaiety at
all the faces in turn. Michel met it with a faithful-dog gaze
and innocently open mouth. Scevola kept his chin buried on his
chest. Lieutenant Réal was insensible to outward impressions,
and his absent stare made nothing of Peyrol. The rover himself
presently fell into thought. The last stir of air died out in
the little basin, and the sun clearing Porquerolles inundated
it with a sudden light, in which Michel blinked like an owl.</p>

<p>"It’s hot early," he announced aloud, but only because he had
formed the habit of talking to himself. He would not have presumed
to offer an opinion unless asked by Peyrol.</p>

<p>His voice having recalled Peyrol to himself, he proposed to masthead
the yards, and even asked Lieutenant Réal to help in that operation,
which was accomplished in silence, except for the faint squeaking
of the blocks. The sails, however, were kept hauled up in the
gear.</p>

<p>"Like this," said Peyrol, "you have only to let go the ropes
and you will be under canvas at once."</p>

<p>Without answering Réal returned to his position by the rudder-head.
He was saying to himself: "I am sneaking off. No, there is honour,
duty. And of course I will return. But when? They will forget
all about me and I shall never be exchanged. This war may last
for years,&mdash;" and illogically he wished he could have had a God
to whom he could pray for relief in his anguish. "She will be
in despair," he thought, writhing inwardly at the mental picture
of a distracted Arlette. Life, however, had embittered his spirit
early, and he said to himself: "But in a month’s time will she
even give me a thought?" Instantly he felt remorseful with a remorse
strong enough to lift him to his feet as if he were morally obliged
to go up again and confess to Arlette this sacrilegious cynicism
of thought. "I am mad," he muttered, perching himself on the low
rail. His lapse from faith plunged him into such a depth of unhappiness
that he felt all his strength of will go out of him. He sat there
apathetic and suffering. He meditated dully: "Young men have been
known to die suddenly; why should not I? I am, as a matter of
fact, at the end of my endurance. I am half dead already. Yes!
but what is left of that life does not belong to me now."</p>

<p>"Peyrol," he said, in such a piercing tone that even Scevola
jerked his head up; but he made an effort to reduce his shrillness
and went on speaking very carefully: "I have left a letter for
the Secretary-General at the Majorité to pay twenty-five hundred
francs to Jean&mdash;you are Jean, are you not? &mdash;Peyrol, price
of the tartane in which I sail. Is that right?"</p>

<p>"What did you do that for?" asked Peyrol with an extremely stony
face. "To get me into trouble?"</p>

<p>"Don’t be a fool, gunner, nobody remembers your name. It is buried
under a stack of blackened paper. I must ask you to go there and
tell them that you have seen with your own eyes Lieutenant Réal
sail away on his mission."</p>

<p>The stoniness of Peyrol persisted, but his eyes were full of
fury. "Oh yes, I see myself going there. Twenty-five hundred francs!
Twenty-five hundred fiddlesticks." His tone changed suddenly.
"I heard someone say that you were an honest man, and I suppose
this is a proof of it. Well, to the devil with your honesty."
He glared at the lieutenant, and then thought: "He doesn’t even
pretend to listen to what I say"&mdash;and another sort of anger, partly
contemptuous and with something of dim sympathy in it, replaced
his downright fury. "Pah!" he said, spat over the side, and walking
up to Réal with great deliberation, slapped him on the shoulder.
The only effect of this proceeding was to make Réal look up at
him without any expression whatever.</p>

<p>Peyrol then picked up the lieutenant’s valise and carried it
down into the cuddy. As he passed by, Citizen Scevola uttered
the word "Citoyen," but it was only when he came back again that
Peyrol condescended to say "Well?"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me?" asked Scevola.</p>

<p>"You would not give me an account of how you came on board this
tartane," said Peyrol in a tone that sounded almost friendly,
"therefore I need not tell you what I will do with you."</p>

<p>A low muttering of thunder followed so close upon his words that
it might have come out of Peyrol’s own lips. The rover gazed uneasily
at the sky. It was still clear overhead, and at the bottom of
that little basin surrounded by rocks there was no view in any
other direction; but even as he gazed there was a sort of flicker
in the sunshine, succeeded by a mighty but distant clap of thunder.
For the next half-hour Peyrol and Michel were busy ashore taking
a long line from the tartane to the entrance of the little basin,
where they fastened the end of it to a bush. This was for the
purpose of hauling the tartane out into the cove. Then they came
aboard again. The bit of sky above their heads was still clear,
but while walking with the hauling line near the cove Peyrol had
got a glimpse of the edge of the cloud. The sun grew scorching
all of a sudden, and in the stagnating air a mysterious change
seemed to come over the quality and the colour of the light. Peyrol
flung his cap on the deck, baring his head to the subtle menace
of the breathless stillness of the air.</p>

<p>"Phew! Ca chauffe," he muttered, rolling up the sleeves of his
jacket. He wiped his forehead with his mighty forearm upon which
a mermaid with an immensely long fishtail was tattooed. Perceiving
the lieutenant’s belted sword lying on the deck, he picked it
up and without any ceremony threw it down the cabin stairs. As
he was passing again near Scevola, the sans-culotte raised his
voice.</p>

<p>"I believe you are one of those wretches corrupted by English
gold," he cried like one inspired. His shining eyes, his red cheeks,
testified to the fire of patriotism burning in his breast, and
he used that conventional phrase of revolutionary time, a time
when, intoxicated with oratory, he used to run about dealing death
to traitors of both sexes and all ages. But his denunciation was
received in such profound silence that his own belief in it wavered.
His words had sunk into an abysmal stillness and the next sound
was Peyrol speaking to Réal.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will get very wet, lieutenant, before long,"
and then, looking at Réal, he thought with great conviction: "Wet!
He wouldn’t mind getting drowned." Standing stock still, he fretted
and fumed inwardly, wondering where precisely the English ship
was by this time and where the devil that thunderstorm had got
to: for the sky had become as mute as the oppressed earth. Réal
asked:</p>

<p>"Is it not time to haul out, gunner?"</p>

<p>And Peyrol said:</p>

<p>"There is not a breath of wind anywhere for miles." He was gratified
by the fairly loud mutter rolling apparently along the inland
hills. Over the pool a little ragged cloud torn from the purple
robe of the storm floated, arrested and thin like a bit of dark
gauze.</p>

<p>Above at the farm Catherine had heard, too, the ominous mutter
and came to the door of the salle. From there she could see the
purple cloud itself, convoluted and solid, and its sinister shadow
lying over the hills. The oncoming of the storm added to her sense
of uneasiness at finding herself all alone in the house. Michel
had not come up. She would have welcomed Michel, to whom she hardly
ever spoke, simply as a person belonging to the usual order of
things. She was not talkative, but somehow she would have liked
somebody to speak to just for a moment. This cessation of all
sound, voices or footsteps, around the buildings was not welcome;
but looking at the cloud, she thought that there would be noise
enough presently. However, stepping back into the kitchen, she
was met by a sound that made her regret the oppressive silence,
by its piercing and terrifying character; it was a shriek in the
upper part of the house, where, as far as she knew, there was
only Arlette asleep. In her attempt to cross the kitchen to the
foot of the stairs the weight of her accumulated years fell upon
the old woman. She felt suddenly very feeble and hardly able to
breathe. And all at once the thought "Scevola! Was he murdering
her up there?" paralysed the last remnant of her physical powers.
What else could it be? She fell, as if shot, into a chair under
the first shock and found herself unable to move. Only her brain
remained active, and she raised her hands to her eyes as if to
shut out the image of the horrors upstairs. She heard nothing
more from above. Arlette was dead. She thought that now it was
her turn. While her body quailed before the brutal violence, her
weary spirit longed ardently for the end. Let him come! Let all
this be over at last, with a blow on the head or a stab in the
breast. She had not the courage to uncover her eyes. She waited.
But after about a minute&mdash;it seemed to her interminable&mdash;she heard
rapid footsteps overhead. Arlette was running here and there.
Catherine uncovered her eyes and was about to rise when she heard
at the top of the stairs the name of Peyrol shouted with a desperate
accent. Then again, after the shortest of pauses, the cry of "Peyrol,
Peyrol!" and then the sound of feet running downstairs. There
was another shriek, "Peyrol!" just outside the door before it
flew open. Who was pursuing her? Catherine managed to stand up.
Steadying herself with one hand on the table, she presented an
undaunted front to her niece, who ran into the kitchen with loose
hair flying and the appearance of wildest distraction in her eyes.</p>

<p>The staircase door had slammed to behind her. Nobody was pursuing
her; and Catherine, putting forth her lean brown arm, arrested
Arlette’s flight with such a jerk that the two women swung against
each other. She seized her niece by the shoulders.</p>

<p>"What is this, in Heaven’s name? Where are you rushing to?" she
cried, and the other, as if suddenly exhausted, whispered:</p>

<p>"I woke up from an awful dream."</p>

<p>The kitchen grew dark under the cloud that hung over the house
now. There was a feeble flicker of lightning and a faint crash,
far away.</p>

<p>The old woman gave her niece a little shake. "Dreams are nothing,"
she said. "You are awake now...." And indeed Catherine thought
that no dream could be so bad as the realities which kept hold
of one through the long waking hours.</p>

<p>"They were killing him," moaned Arlette, beginning to tremble
and struggle in her aunt’s arms. "I tell you they were killing
him."</p>

<p>"Be quiet. Were you dreaming of Peyrol?"</p>

<p>She became still in a moment and then whispered: "No, Eugène."</p>

<p>She had seen Réal set upon by a mob of men and women, all dripping
with blood, in a livid cold light, in front of a stretch of mere
shells of houses with cracked walls and broken windows, and going
down in the midst of a forest of raised arms brandishing sabres,
clubs, knives, axes. There was also a man flourishing a red rag
on a stick, while another was beating a drum which boomed above
the sickening sound of broken glass falling like rain on the pavement.
And away round the corner of an empty street came Peyrol, whom
she recognized by his white head, walking without haste, swinging
his cudgel regularly. The terrible thing was that Peyrol looked
straight at her, not noticing anything, composed, without a frown
or a smile, unseeing and deaf, while she waved her arms and shrieked
desperately to him for help. She woke up with the piercing sound
of his name in her ears and with the impression of the dream so
powerful that even now, looking distractedly into her aunt’s face,
she could see the bare arms of that murderous crowd raised above
Réal’s sinking head. Yet the name that had sprung to her lips
on waking was the name of Peyrol. She pushed her aunt away with
such force that the old woman staggered backwards, and to save
herself had to catch hold of the overmantel above her head. Arlette
ran to the door of the salle, looked in, came back to her aunt
and shouted: "Where is he?"</p>

<p>Catherine really did not know which path the lieutenant had taken.
She understood very well that "he" meant Réal.</p>

<p>She said: "He went away a long time ago"; grasped her niece’s
arm and added with an effort to steady her voice: "He is coming
back, Arlette&mdash;for nothing will keep him away from you."</p>

<p>Arlette, as if mechanically, was whispering to herself the magic
name, "Peyrol, Peyrol!" then cried: "I want Eugène now. This moment."</p>

<p>Catherine’s face wore a look of unflinching patience. "He has
departed on service," she said. Her niece looked at her with enormous
eyes, coal-black, profound, and immovable, while in a forcible
and distracted tone she said: "You and Peyrol have been plotting
to rob me of my reason. But I will know how to make that old man
give him up. He is mine!" She spun round wildly, like a person
looking for a way of escape from a deadly peril, and rushed out
blindly.</p>

<p>About Escampobar the air was murky but calm and the silence was
so profound that it was possible to hear the first heavy drops
of rain striking the ground. In the intimidating shadow of the
storm-cloud, Arlette stood irresolute for a moment, but it was
to Peyrol, the man of mystery and power, that her thoughts turned.
She was ready to embrace his knees, to entreat and to scold. "Peyrol,
Peyrol!" she cried twice, and lent her ear as if expecting an
answer. Then she shouted: "I want him back."</p>

<p>Catherine, alone in the kitchen, moving with dignity, sat down
in the armchair with the tall back, like a senator in his curule
chair awaiting the blow of a barbarous fate.</p>

<p>Arlette flew down the slope. The first sign of her coming was
a faint thin scream which really the rover alone heard and understood.
He pressed his lips in a particular way, showing his appreciation
of the coming difficulty. The next moment he saw, poised on a
detached boulder and thinly veiled by the first perpendicular
shower, Arlette, who, catching sight of the tartane with the men
on board of her, let out a prolonged shriek of mingled triumph
and despair: "Peyrol! Help! Pey<hr>rol!"</p>

<p>Réal jumped to his feet with an extremely scared face, but Peyrol
extended an arresting arm. "She is calling to me," he said, gazing
at the figure poised on the rock. "Well leaped! Sacré nom!...
Well leaped!" And he muttered to himself soberly: "She will break
her legs or her neck."</p>

<p>"I see you, Peyrol," screamed Arlette, who seemed to be flying
through the air. "Don’t you dare."</p>

<p>"Yes, here I am," shouted the rover, striking his breast with
his fist.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Réal put both his hands over his face. Michel looked
on open-mouthed, very much as if watching a performance in a circus;
but Scevola cast his eyes down. Arlette came on board with such
an impetus that Peyrol had to step forward and save her from a
fall which would have stunned her. She struggled in his arms with
extreme violence. The heiress of Escampobar, with her loose black
hair, seemed the incarnation of pale fury. "Misérable! Don’t you
dare!" A roll of thunder covered her voice, but when it had passed
away she was heard again in suppliant tones. "Peyrol, my friend,
my dear old friend. Give him back to me," and all the time her
body writhed in the arms of the old seaman. "You used to love
me, Peyrol," she cried without ceasing to struggle, and suddenly
struck the rover twice in the face with her clenched fist. Peyrol’s
head received the two blows as if it had been made of marble,
but he felt with fear her body become still, grow rigid in his
arms. A heavy squall enveloped the group of people on board the
tartane. Peyrol laid Arlette gently on the deck. Her eyes were
closed, her hands remained clenched; every sign of life had left
her white face. Peyrol stood up and looked at the tall rocks streaming
with water. The rain swept over the tartane with an angry swishing
roar to which was added the sound of water rushing violently down
the folds and seams of the precipitous shore, vanishing gradually
from his sight, as if this had been the beginning of a destroying
and universal deluge&mdash;the end of all things.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Réal, kneeling on one knee, contemplated the pale
face of Arlette. Distinct, yet mingling with the faint growl of
distant thunder, Peyrol’s voice was heard saying:</p>

<p>"We can’t put her ashore and leave her lying in the rain. She
must be taken up to the house." Arlette’s soaked clothes clung
to her limbs while the lieutenant, his bare head dripping with
rainwater, looked as if he had just saved her from drowning. Peyrol
gazed down inscrutably at the woman stretched on the deck and
at the kneeling man. "She has fainted from rage at her old Peyrol,"
he went on rather dreamily. "Strange things do happen. However,
lieutenant, you had better take her under the arms and step ashore
first. I will help you. Ready? Lift."</p>

<p>The movements of the two men had to be careful and their progress
was slow on the lower, steep part of the slope. After going up
more than two-thirds of the way, they rested their insensible
burden on a flat stone. Réal continued to sustain the shoulders,
but Peyrol lowered the feet gently.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he said. "You will be able to carry her yourself the rest
of the way and give her up to old Catherine. Get a firm footing
and I will lift her and place her in your arms. You can walk the
distance quite easily. There.... Hold her a little higher, or
her feet will be catching on the stones."</p>

<p>Arlette’s hair was hanging far below the lieutenant’s arm in
an inert and heavy mass. The thunderstorm was passing away, leaving
a cloudy sky. And Peyrol thought with a profound sigh: "I am tired."</p>

<p>"She is light," said Réal.</p>

<p>"Parbleu, she is light. If she were dead you would find her heavy
enough. Allons, mon lieutenant. No! I am not coming. What’s the
good? I’ll stay down here. I have no mind to listen to Catherine’s
scolding."</p>

<p>The lieutenant, looking absorbed into the face resting in the
hollow of his arm, never averted his gaze&mdash;not even when Peyrol,
stooping over Arlette, kissed the white forehead near the roots
of the hair, black as a raven’s wing.</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" muttered Réal.</p>

<p>"Do? Why, give her up to old Catherine. And you may just as well
tell her that I will be coming along directly. That will cheer
her up. I used to count for something in that house. Allez! For
our time is very short."</p>

<p>With these words he turned away and walked slowly down to the
tartane. A breeze had sprung up. He felt it on his wet neck and
was grateful for the cool touch which recalled him to himself,
to his old wandering self which had known no softness and no hesitation
in the face of any risk offered by life.</p>

<p>As he stepped on board, the shower passed away, Michel, wet to
the skin, was still in the very same attitude gazing up the slope.
Citizen Scevola had drawn his knees up and was holding his head
in his hands; whether because of rain or cold or for some other
reason, his teeth were chattering audibly with a continuous and
distressing rattle. Peyrol flung off his jacket, heavy with water,
with a strange air as if it was of no more use to his mortal envelope,
squared his broad shoulders, and directed Michel, in a deep, quiet
voice, to let go the lines holding the tartane to the shore. The
faithful henchman was taken aback and required one of Peyrol’s
authoritative "Allez!" to put him in motion. Meantime the rover
cast off the tiller lines and laid his hand with an air of mastery
on the stout piece of wood projecting horizontally from the rudder-head
about the level of his hip. The voices and the movements of his
companions caused Citizen Scevola to master the desperate trembling
of his jaw. He wriggled a little in his bonds, and the question
that had been on his lips for a good many hours was uttered again.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me?"</p>

<p>"What do you think of a little promenade at sea?" Peyrol asked
in a tone that was not unkindly.</p>

<p>Citizen Scevola, who had seemed totally and completely cast down
and subdued, let out a most unexpected screech.</p>

<p>"Unbind me. Put me ashore."</p>

<p>Michel, busy forward, was moved to smile as though he had possessed
a cultivated sense of incongruity. Peyrol remained serious.</p>

<p>"You shall be untied presently," he assured the blood-drinking
patriot, who had been for so many years the reputed possessor
not only of Escampobar but of the Escampobar heiress that, living
on appearances, he had almost come to believe in that ownership
himself. No wonder he screeched at this rude awakening. Peyrol
raised his voice: "Haul on the line, Michel."</p>

<p>As, directly the ropes had been let go, the tartane had swung
clear of the shore, the movement given her by Michel carried her
towards the entrance by which the basin communicated with the
cove. Peyrol attended to the helm, and in a moment, gliding through
the narrow gap, the tartane carrying her way, shot out almost
into the middle of the cove.</p>

<p>A little wind could be felt, running light wrinkles over the
water, but outside the overshadowed sea was already speckled with
white caps. Peyrol helped Michel to haul aft the sheets and then
went back to the tiller. The pretty spick-and-span craft that
had been lying idle for so long began to glide into the wide world.
Michel gazed at the shore as if lost in admiration. Citizen Scevola’s
head had fallen on his knees while his nerveless hands clasped
his legs loosely. He was the very image of dejection.</p>

<p>"Hé, Michel! Come here and cast loose the citizen. It is only
fair that he should be untied for a little excursion at sea."</p>

<p>When his order had been executed, Peyrol addressed himself to
the desolate figure on the deck.</p>

<p>"Like this, should the tartane get capsized in a squall, you
will have an equal chance with us to swim for your life."</p>

<p>Scevola disdained to answer. He was engaged in biting his knee
with rage in a stealthy fashion.</p>

<p>"You came on board for some murderous purpose. Who you were after,
unless it was myself, God only knows. I feel quite justified in
giving you a little outing at sea. I won’t conceal from you, citizen,
that it may not be without risk to life or limb. But you have
only yourself to thank for being here."</p>

<p>As the tartane drew clear of the cove, she felt more the weight
of the breeze and darted forward with a lively motion. A vaguely
contented smile lighted up Michel’s hairy countenance.</p>

<p>"She feels the sea," said Peyrol, who enjoyed the swift movement
of his vessel. "This is different from your lagoon, Michel."</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Michel with becoming gravity.</p>

<p>"Doesn’t it seem funny to you, as you look back at the shore,
to think that you have left nothing and nobody behind?"</p>

<p>Michel assumed the aspect of a man confronted by an intellectual
problem. Since he had become Peyrol’s henchman he had lost the
habit of thinking altogether. Directions and orders were easy
things to apprehend; but a conversation with him whom he called
"notre maître" was a serious matter demanding great and concentrated
attention.</p>

<p>"Possibly," he murmured, looking strangely selfconscious.</p>

<p>"Well, you are lucky, take my word for it," said the rover, watching
the course of his little vessel along the head of the peninsula.
"You have not even a dog to miss you."</p>

<p>"I have only you, Maître Peyrol."</p>

<p>"That’s what I was thinking," said Peyrol half to himself, while
Michel, who had good sea-legs, kept his balance to the movements
of the craft without taking his eyes from the rover’s face.</p>

<p>"No," Peyrol exclaimed suddenly, after a moment of meditation,
"I could not leave you behind." He extended his open palm towards
Michel.</p>

<p>"Put your hand in there," he said.</p>

<p>Michel hesitated for a moment before this extraordinary proposal.
At last he did so, and Peyrol, holding the bereaved fisherman’s
hand in a powerful grip, said:</p>

<p>"If I had gone away by myself, I would have left you marooned
on this earth like a man thrown out to die on a desert island."
Some dim perception of the solemnity of the occasion seemed to
enter Michel’s primitive brain. He connected Peyrol’s words with
the sense of his own insignificant position at the tail of all
mankind, and, timidly, he murmured with his clear, innocent glance
unclouded, the fundamental axiom of his philosophy:</p>

<p>"Somebody must be last in this world."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you will have to forgive me all that may happen
between this and the hour of sunset."</p>

<p>The tartane, obeying the helm, fell off before the wind, with
her head to the eastward.</p>

<p>Peyrol murmured: "She has not forgotten how to walk the seas."
His unsubdued heart, heavy for so many days, had a moment of buoyancy&mdash;the
illusion of immense freedom.</p>

<p>At that moment Réal, amazed at finding no tartane in the basin,
was running madly towards the cove, where he was sure Peyrol must
be waiting to give her up to him. He ran out on to the very rock
on which Peyrol’s late prisoner had sat after his escape, too
tired to care, yet cheered by the hope of liberty. But Réal was
in a worse plight. He could see no shadowy form through the thin
veil of rain which pitted the sheltered piece of water framed
in the rocks. The little craft had been spirited away. Impossible!
There must be something wrong with his eyes! Again the barren
hillsides echoed the name of "Peyrol," shouted with all the force
of Réal’s lungs. He shouted it only once, and about five minutes
afterwards appeared at the kitchen door, panting, streaming with
water as if he had fought his way up from the bottom of the sea.
In the tall-backed armchair Arlette lay, with her limbs relaxed,
her head on Catherine’s arm, her face white as death. He saw her
open her black eyes, enormous and as if not of this world; he
saw old Catherine turn her head, heard a cry of surprise, and
saw a sort of struggle beginning between the two women. He screamed
at them like a madman: "Peyrol has betrayed me!" and in an instant,
with a bang of the door, he was gone.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased. Above his head the unbroken mass of clouds
moved to the eastward, and he moved in the same direction, as
if he too were driven by the wind up the hillside, towards the
lookout. When he reached the spot and, gasping, flung one arm
round the trunk of the leaning tree, the only thing he was aware
of during the sombre pause in the unrest of the elements was the
distracting turmoil of his thoughts. After a moment he perceived
through the rain the English ship with her topsails lowered on
the caps, forging ahead slowly across the northern entrance of
the Petite Passe. His distress fastened insanely on the notion
of there being a connection between that enemy ship and Peyrol’s
inexplicable conduct. That old man had always meant to go himself!
And when a moment after, looking to the southward, he made out
the shadow of the tartane coming round the land in the midst of
another squall, he muttered to himself a bitter "Of course!" She
had both her sails set. Peyrol was indeed pressing her to the
utmost in his shameful haste to traffic with the enemy. The truth
was that from the position in which Réal first saw him, Peyrol
could not yet see the English ship, and held confidently on his
course up the middle of the strait. The man-of-war and the little
tartane saw each other quite unexpectedly at a distance that was
very little over a mile. Peyrol’s heart flew into his mouth at
finding himself so close to the enemy. On board the <em>Amelia</em>
at first no notice was taken. It was simply a tartane making for
shelter on the north side of Porquerolles. But when Peyrol suddenly
altered his course, the master of the man-of-war noticing the
manœuvre, took up the long glass for a look. Captain Vincent was
on deck and agreed with the master’s remark that "there was a
craft acting suspiciously." Before the <em>Amelia</em> could come
round in the heavy squall, Peyrol was already under the battery
of Porquerolles and, so far, safe from capture. Captain Vincent
had no mind to bring his ship within reach of the battery and
risk damage in his rigging or hull for the sake of a small coaster.
However, the tale brought on board by Symons of his discovery
of a hidden craft, of his capture, and his wonderful escape, had
made every tartane an object of interest to the whole ship’s company.
The <em>Amelia</em> remained hove to in the strait while her officers
watched the lateen sails gliding to and fro under the protecting
muzzles of the guns. Captain Vincent himself had been impressed
by Peyrol’s manœuvre. Coasting craft, as a rule, were not afraid
of the <em>Amelia</em>. After taking a few turns on the quarter-deck
he ordered Symons to be called aft.</p>

<p>The hero of a unique and mysterious adventure, which had been
the only subject of talk on board the corvette for the last twenty-four
hours, came along rolling, hat in hand, and enjoying a secret
sense of his importance.</p>

<p>"Take the glass," said the captain, "and have a look at that
vessel under the land. Is she anything like the tartane that you
say you have been aboard of?"</p>

<p>Symons was very positive. "I think I can swear to those painted
mastheads, your honour. It is the last thing I remember before
that murderous ruffian knocked me senseless. The moon shone on
them. I can make them out now with the glass." As to the fellow
boasting to him that the tartane was a dispatch-boat and had already
made some trips, well, Symons begged his honour to believe that
the beggar was not sober at the time. He did not care what he
blurted out. The best proof of his condition was that he went
away to fetch the soldiers and forgot to come back. The murderous
old ruffian! "You see, you honour," continued Symons, "he thought
I was not likely to escape after getting a blow that would have
killed nine out of any ten men. So he went away to boast of what
he had done before the people ashore; because one of his chums,
worse than himself, came down thinking he would kill me with a
dam’ big manure fork, saving your honour’s presence. A regular
savage he was."</p>

<p>Symons paused, staring, as if astonished at the marvels of his
own tale. The old master, standing at his captain’s elbow, observed
in a dispassionate tone that, anyway, that peninsula was not a
bad jumping-off place for a craft intending to slip through the
blockade. Symons, not being dismissed, waited, hat in hand, while
Captain Vincent directed the master to fill on the ship and stand
a little nearer to the battery. It was done, and presently there
was a flash of a gun low down on the water’s edge and a shot came
skipping in the direction of the <em>Amelia</em>. It fell very
short, but Captain Vincent judged the ship was close enough, and
ordered her to be hove to again. Then Symons was told to take
a look through the glass once more. After a long interval he lowered
it and spoke impressively to his captain:</p>

<p>"I can make out three heads aboard, your honour, and one is white.
I would swear to that white head anywhere."</p>

<p>Captain Vincent made no answer. All this seemed very odd to him;
but after all it was possible. The craft had certainly acted suspiciously.
He spoke to the first lieutenant in a half-vexed tone.</p>

<p>"He has done a rather smart thing. He will dodge here till dark
and then get away. It is perfectly absurd. I don’t want to send
the boats too close to the battery. And if I do he may simply
sail away from them and be round the land long before we are ready
to give him chase. Darkness will be his best friend. However,
we will keep a watch on him in case he is tempted to give us the
slip late in the afternoon. In that case we will have a good try
to catch him. If he has anything aboard, I should like to get
hold of it. It may be of some importance, after all."</p>

<p>On board the tartane Peyrol put his own interpretation on the
ship’s movements. His object had been attained. The corvette had
marked him for her prey. Satisfied as to that, Peyrol watched
his opportunity and taking advantage of a long squall, with rain
thick enough to blur the form of the English ship, he left the
shelter of the battery to lead the Englishman a dance and keep
up his character of a man anxious to avoid capture.</p>

<p>Réal, from his position on the lookout, saw in the thinning downpour
the pointed lateen sails glide round the north end of Porquerolles
and vanish behind the land. Some time afterwards the <em>Amelia</em>
made sail in a manner that put it beyond doubt that she meant
to chase. Her lofty canvas was shut off too presently by the land
of Porquerolles. When she had disappeared Réal turned to Arlette.</p>

<p>"Let us go," he said.</p>

<p>Arlette, stimulated by the short glimpse of Réal at the kitchen
door, whom she had taken for a vision of a lost man calling her
to follow him to the end of the world, had torn herself out of
the old woman’s thin, bony arms which could not cope with the
struggles of her body and the fierceness of her spirit. She had
run straight to the lookout, though there was nothing to guide
her there except a blind impulse to seek Réal wherever he might
be. He was not aware of her having found him until she seized
hold of his arm with a suddenness, energy and determination of
which no one with a clouded mind could have been capable. He felt
himself being taken possession of in a way that tore all his scruples
out of his breast. Holding on to the trunk of the tree, he threw
his other arm round her waist, and when she confessed to him that
she did not know why she had run up there, but that if she had
not found him she would have thrown herself over the cliff, he
tightened his clasp with sudden exultation, as though she had
been a gift prayed for instead of a stumbling-block for his pedantic
conscience. Together they walked back. In the failing light the
buildings awaited them, lifeless, the walls darkened by rain and
the big slopes of the roofs glistening and sinister under the
flying desolation of the clouds. In the kitchen Catherine heard
their mingled footsteps, and rigid in the tall arm-chair awaited
their coming. Arlette threw her arms round the old woman’s neck,
while Réal stood on one side, looking on. Thought after thought
flew through his mind and vanished in the strong feeling of the
irrevocable nature of the event handing him to the woman whom,
in the revulsion of his feelings, he was inclined to think more
sane than himself. Arlette, with one arm over the old woman’s
shoulders, kissed the wrinkled forehead under the white band of
linen that, on the erect head, had the effect of a rustic diadem.</p>

<p>"To-morrow you and I will have to walk down to the church."</p>

<p>The austere dignity of Catherine’s pose seemed to be shaken by
this proposal to lead before the God with whom she had made her
peace long ago that unhappy girl chosen to share in the guilt
of impious and unspeakable horrors which had darkened her mind.</p>

<p>Arlette, still stooping over her aunt’s face, extended a hand
towards Réal, who, making a step forward, took it silently into
his grasp.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you will, Aunt," insisted Arlette. "You will have to
come with me to pray for Peyrol, whom you and I shall never see
any more."</p>

<p>Catherine’s head dropped, whether in assent or grief; and Réal
felt an unexpected and profound emotion, for he, too, was convinced
that none of the three persons in the farm would ever see Peyrol
again. It was as though the rover of the wide seas had left them
to themselves on a sudden impulse of scorn, of magnanimity, of
a passion weary of itself. However come by, Réal was ready to
clasp for ever to his breast that woman touched by the red hand
of the Revolution; for she, whose little feet had run ankle-deep
through the terrors of death, had brought to him the sense of
triumphant life.</p>
