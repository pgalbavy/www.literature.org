WHEN OUR GUARDS AROUSED US FROM SLEEP WE were much refreshed.
They gave us food.  Strips of dried meat it was, but it
put new life and strength into us, so that now we too
marched with high-held heads, and took noble strides.
At least I did, for I was young and proud; but poor Perry
hated walking.  On earth I had often seen him call a cab
to travel a square--he was paying for it now, and his old
legs wobbled so that I put my arm about him and half carried
him through the balance of those frightful marches.
<P>
The country began to change at last, and we wound up
out of the level plain through mighty mountains of
virgin granite.  The tropical verdure of the lowlands was
replaced by hardier vegetation, but even here the effects
of constant heat and light were apparent in the immensity
of the trees and the profusion of foliage and blooms.
Crystal streams roared through their rocky channels,
fed by the perpetual snows which we could see far above us.
Above the snowcapped heights hung masses of heavy clouds.
It was these, Perry explained, which evidently served
the double purpose of replenishing the melting snows and
protecting them from the direct rays of the sun.
<P>
By this time we had picked up a smattering of the bastard
language in which our guards addressed us, as well
as making good headway in the rather charming tongue
of our co-captives. Directly ahead of me in the chain
gang was a young woman.  Three feet of chain linked us
together in a forced companionship which I, at least,
soon rejoiced in.  For I found her a willing teacher,
and from her I learned the language of her tribe,
and much of the life and customs of the inner world--at
least that part of it with which she was familiar.
<P>
She told me that she was called Dian the Beautiful,
and that she belonged to the tribe of Amoz, which dwells
in the cliffs above the Darel Az, or shallow sea.
<P>
"How came you here?" I asked her.
<P>
"I was running away from Jubal the Ugly One," she answered,
as though that was explanation quite sufficient.
<P>
"Who is Jubal the Ugly One?" I asked.  "And why did you
run away from him?"
<P>
She looked at me in surprise.
<P>
"Why DOES a woman run away from a man?" she answered
my question with another.
<P>
"They do not, where I come from," I replied.
"Sometimes they run after them."
<P>
But she could not understand.  Nor could I get her to grasp
the fact that I was of another world.  She was quite as
positive that creation was originated solely to produce her
own kind and the world she lived in as are many of the outer
world.
<P>
"But Jubal," I insisted.  "Tell me about him, and why you
ran away to be chained by the neck and scourged across
the face of a world."
<P>
"Jubal the Ugly One placed his trophy before my father's house.
It was the head of a mighty tandor.  It remained there
and no greater trophy was placed beside it.  So I knew
that Jubal the Ugly One would come and take me as his mate.
None other so powerful wished me, or they would have
slain a mightier beast and thus have won me from Jubal.
My father is not a mighty hunter.  Once he was,
but a sadok tossed him, and never again had he the full
use of his right arm.  My brother, Dacor the Strong One,
had gone to the land of Sari to steal a mate for himself.
Thus there was none, father, brother, or lover, to save
me from Jubal the Ugly One, and I ran away and hid among
the hills that skirt the land of Amoz.  And there these
Sagoths found me and made me captive."
<P>
"What will they do with you?" I asked.  "Where are they
taking us?"
<P>
Again she looked her incredulity.
<P>
"I can almost believe that you are of another world,"
she said, "for otherwise such ignorance were inexplicable.
Do you really mean that you do not know that the Sagoths
are the creatures of the Mahars--the mighty Mahars who
think they own Pellucidar and all that walks or grows
upon its surface, or creeps or burrows beneath, or swims
within its lakes and oceans, or flies through its air?
Next you will be telling me that you never before heard
of the Mahars!"
<P>
I was loath to do it, and further incur her scorn;
but there was no alternative if I were to absorb knowledge,
so I made a clean breast of my pitiful ignorance as to the
mighty Mahars.  She was shocked.  But she did her very best
to enlighten me, though much that she said was as Greek
would have been to her.  She described the Mahars largely
by comparisons.  In this way they were like unto thipdars,
in that to the hairless lidi.
<P>
About all I gleaned of them was that they were
quite hideous, had wings, and webbed feet; lived in
cities built beneath the ground; could swim under
water for great distances, and were very, very wise.
The Sagoths were their weapons of offense and defense,
and the races like herself were their hands and feet--they
were the slaves and servants who did all the manual labor.
The Mahars were the heads--the brains--of the inner world.
I longed to see this wondrous race of supermen.
<P>
Perry learned the language with me.  When we halted,
as we occasionally did, though sometimes the halts seemed
ages apart, he would join in the conversation, as would
Ghak the Hairy One, he who was chained just ahead of Dian
the Beautiful.  Ahead of Ghak was Hooja the Sly One.
He too entered the conversation occasionally.  Most of
his remarks were directed toward Dian the Beautiful.
It didn't take half an eye to see that he had developed
a bad case; but the girl appeared totally oblivious
to his thinly veiled advances.  Did I say thinly veiled?
There is a race of men in New Zealand, or Australia,
I have forgotten which, who indicate their preference
for the lady of their affections by banging her over
the head with a bludgeon.  By comparison with this method
Hooja's lovemaking might be called thinly veiled.
At first it caused me to blush violently although I
have seen several Old Years out at Rectors, and in other
less fashionable places off Broadway, and in Vienna,
and Hamburg.
<P>
But the girl!  She was magnificent.  It was easy to see
that she considered herself as entirely above and apart from
her present surroundings and company.  She talked with me,
and with Perry, and with the taciturn Ghak because we
were respectful; but she couldn't even see Hooja the
Sly One, much less hear him, and that made him furious.
He tried to get one of the Sagoths to move the girl up
ahead of him in the slave gang, but the fellow only poked
him with his spear and told him that he had selected the
girl for his own property--that he would buy her from the
Mahars as soon as they reached Phutra.  Phutra, it seemed,
was the city of our destination.
<P>
After passing over the first chain of mountains we skirted
a salt sea, upon whose bosom swam countless horrid things.
Seal-like creatures there were with long necks stretching
ten and more feet above their enormous bodies and whose
snake heads were split with gaping mouths bristling
with countless fangs.  There were huge tortoises too,
paddling about among these other reptiles, which Perry
said were Plesiosaurs of the Lias.  I didn't question his
veracity--they might have been most anything.
<P>
Dian told me they were tandorazes, or tandors of the sea,
and that the other, and more fearsome reptiles, which
occasionally
rose from the deep to do battle with them, were azdyryths,
or sea-dyryths--Perry called them Ichthyosaurs.
They resembled a whale with the head of an alligator.
<P>
I had forgotten what little geology I had studied
at school--about all that remained was an impression
of horror that the illustrations of restored prehistoric
monsters had made upon me, and a well-defined belief
that any man with a pig's shank and a vivid imagination
could "restore" most any sort of paleolithic monster he
saw fit, and take rank as a first class paleontologist.
But when I saw these sleek, shiny carcasses shimmering in
the sunlight as they emerged from the ocean, shaking their
giant heads; when I saw the waters roll from their sinuous
bodies in miniature waterfalls as they glided hither
and thither, now upon the surface, now half submerged;
as I saw them meet, open-mouthed, hissing and snorting,
in their titanic and interminable warring I realized
how futile is man's poor, weak imagination by comparison
with Nature's incredible genius.
<P>
And Perry!  He was absolutely flabbergasted.  He said
so himself.
<P>
"David," he remarked, after we had marched for a long time
beside that awful sea.  "David, I used to teach geology,
and I thought that I believed what I taught; but now I
see that I did not believe it--that it is impossible
for man to believe such things as these unless he sees
them with his own eyes.  We take things for granted,
perhaps, because we are told them over and over again,
and have no way of disproving them--like religions,
for example; but we don't believe them, we only think
we do.  If you ever get back to the outer world you
will find that the geologists and paleontologists will
be the first to set you down a liar, for they know
that no such creatures as they restore ever existed.
It is all right to IMAGINE them as existing in an equally
imaginary epoch--but now?  poof!"
<P>
At the next halt Hooja the Sly One managed to find enough
slack chain to permit him to worm himself back quite close
to Dian.  We were all standing, and as he edged near the
girl she turned her back upon him in such a truly earthly
feminine manner that I could scarce repress a smile; but it
was a short-lived smile for on the instant the Sly One's
hand fell upon the girl's bare arm, jerking her roughly
toward him.
<P>
I was not then familiar with the customs or social ethics
which prevailed within Pellucidar; but even so I did
not need the appealing look which the girl shot to me
from her magnificent eyes to influence my subsequent act.
What the Sly One's intention was I paused not to inquire;
but instead, before he could lay hold of her with his
other hand, I placed a right to the point of his jaw that
felled him in his tracks.
<P>
A roar of approval went up from those of the other prisoners
and the Sagoths who had witnessed the brief drama; not, as I
later learned, because I had championed the girl, but for
the neat and, to them, astounding method by which I had bested
Hooja.
<P>
And the girl?  At first she looked at me with wide, wondering
eyes,
and then she dropped her head, her face half averted,
and a delicate flush suffused her cheek.  For a moment
she stood thus in silence, and then her head went high,
and she turned her back upon me as she had upon Hooja.
Some of the prisoners laughed, and I saw the face of Ghak
the Hairy One go very black as he looked at me searchingly.
And what I could see of Dian's cheek went suddenly from red
to white.
<P>
Immediately after we resumed the march, and though I realized
that in some way I had offended Dian the Beautiful I could
not prevail upon her to talk with me that I might learn
wherein I had erred--in fact I might quite as well have
been addressing a sphinx for all the attention I got.
At last my own foolish pride stepped in and prevented
my making any further attempts, and thus a companionship
that without my realizing it had come to mean a great deal
to me was cut off.  Thereafter I confined my conversation
to Perry.  Hooja did not renew his advances toward the girl,
nor did he again venture near me.
<P>
Again the weary and apparently interminable marching became
a perfect nightmare of horrors to me.  The more firmly
fixed became the realization that the girl's friendship
had meant so much to me, the more I came to miss it;
and the more impregnable the barrier of silly pride.
But I was very young and would not ask Ghak for the
explanation which I was sure he could give, and that might
have made everything all right again.
<P>
On the march, or during halts, Dian refused consistently
to notice me--when her eyes wandered in my direction
she looked either over my head or directly through me.
At last I became desperate, and determined to swallow
my self-esteem, and again beg her to tell me how I
had offended, and how I might make reparation.  I made
up my mind that I should do this at the next halt.
We were approaching another range of mountains at the time,
and when we reached them, instead of winding across
them through some high-flung pass we entered a mighty
natural tunnel--a series of labyrinthine grottoes,
dark as Erebus.
<P>
The guards had no torches or light of any description.
In fact we had seen no artificial light or sign of
fire since we had entered Pellucidar.  In a land of
perpetual noon there is no need of light above ground,
yet I marveled that they had no means of lighting
their way through these dark, subterranean passages.
So we crept along at a snail's pace, with much stumbling
and falling--the guards keeping up a singsong chant ahead
of us, interspersed with certain high notes which I found
always indicated rough places and turns.
<P>
Halts were now more frequent, but I did not wish to speak
to Dian until I could see from the expression of her face
how she was receiving my apologies.  At last a faint
glow ahead forewarned us of the end of the tunnel,
for which I for one was devoutly thankful.  Then at a sudden
turn we emerged into the full light of the noonday sun.
<P>
But with it came a sudden realization of what meant
to me a real catastrophe--Dian was gone, and with her
a half-dozen other prisoners.  The guards saw it too,
and the ferocity of their rage was terrible to behold.
Their awesome, bestial faces were contorted in the most
diabolical expressions, as they accused each other of
responsibility for the loss.  Finally they fell upon us,
beating us with their spear shafts, and hatchets.
They had already killed two near the head of the line,
and were like to have finished the balance of us when
their leader finally put a stop to the brutal slaughter.
Never in all my life had I witnessed a more horrible
exhibition of bestial rage--I thanked God that Dian had not
been one of those left to endure it.
<P>
Of the twelve prisoners who had been chained ahead of me
each alternate one had been freed commencing with Dian.
Hooja was gone.  Ghak remained.  What could it mean?  How
had it been accomplished?  The commander of the guards
was investigating.  Soon he discovered that the rude
locks which had held the neckbands in place had been
deftly picked.
<P>
"Hooja the Sly One," murmured Ghak, who was now next to me
in line.  "He has taken the girl that you would not have,"
he continued, glancing at me.
<P>
"That I would not have!" I cried.  "What do you mean?"
<P>
He looked at me closely for a moment.
<P>
"I have doubted your story that you are from another world,"
he said at last, "but yet upon no other grounds could
your ignorance of the ways of Pellucidar be explained.
Do you really mean that you do not know that you offended
the Beautiful One, and how?"
<P>
"I do not know, Ghak," I replied.
<P>
"Then shall I tell you.  When a man of Pellucidar
intervenes between another man and the woman the other
man would have, the woman belongs to the victor.
Dian the Beautiful belongs to you.  You should have claimed
her or released her.  Had you taken her hand, it would
have indicated your desire to make her your mate, and had
you raised her hand above her head and then dropped it,
it would have meant that you did not wish her for a mate
and that you released her from all obligation to you.
By doing neither you have put upon her the greatest affront
that a man may put upon a woman.  Now she is your slave.
No man will take her as mate, or may take her honorably,
until he shall have overcome you in combat, and men do not
choose slave women as their mates--at least not the men
of Pellucidar."
<P>
"I did not know, Ghak," I cried.  "I did not know.
Not for all Pellucidar would I have harmed Dian the Beautiful
by word, or look, or act of mine.  I do not want her as
my slave.  I do not want her as my--" but here I stopped.
The vision of that sweet and innocent face floated before
me amidst the soft mists of imagination, and where I had
on the second believed that I clung only to the memory
of a gentle friendship I had lost, yet now it seemed
that it would have been disloyalty to her to have said
that I did not want Dian the Beautiful as my mate.
I had not thought of her except as a welcome friend
in a strange, cruel world.  Even now I did not think
that I loved her.
<P>
I believe Ghak must have read the truth more in my
expression than in my words, for presently he laid
his hand upon my shoulder.
<P>
"Man of another world," he said, "I believe you.
Lips may lie, but when the heart speaks through the eyes
it tells only the truth.  Your heart has spoken to me.
I know now that you meant no affront to Dian the Beautiful.
She is not of my tribe; but her mother is my sister.
She does not know it--her mother was stolen by Dian's
father who came with many others of the tribe of Amoz
to battle with us for our women--the most beautiful women
of Pellucidar.  Then was her father king of Amoz, and her
mother was daughter of the king of Sari--to whose power I,
his son, have succeeded.  Dian is the daughter of kings,
though her father is no longer king since the sadok tossed
him and Jubal the Ugly One wrested his kingship from him.
Because of her lineage the wrong you did her was greatly
magnified in the eyes of all who saw it.  She will never
forgive you."
<P>
I asked Ghak if there was not some way in which I
could release the girl from the bondage and ignominy
I had unwittingly placed upon her.
<P>
"If ever you find her, yes," he answered.  "Merely to
raise her hand above her head and drop it in the presence
of others is sufficient to release her; but how may you
ever find her, you who are doomed to a life of slavery
yourself in the buried city of Phutra?"
<P>
"Is there no escape?" I asked.
<P>
"Hooja the Sly One escaped and took the others with him,"
replied Ghak.  "But there are no more dark places on
the way to Phutra, and once there it is not so easy--the
Mahars are very wise.  Even if one escaped from Phutra
there are the thipdars--they would find you, and then--"
the Hairy One shuddered.  "No, you will never escape
the Mahars."
<P>
It was a cheerful prospect.  I asked Perry what he thought
about it; but he only shrugged his shoulders and continued
a longwinded prayer he had been at for some time.
He was wont to say that the only redeeming feature of our
captivity was the ample time it gave him for the improvisation
of prayers--it was becoming an obsession with him.
The Sagoths had begun to take notice of his habit
of declaiming throughout entire marches.  One of them
asked him what he was saying--to whom he was talking.
The question gave me an idea, so I answered quickly
before Perry could say anything.
<P>
"Do not interrupt him," I said.  "He is a very holy
man in the world from which we come.  He is speaking
to spirits which you cannot see--do not interrupt him
or they will spring out of the air upon you and rend you
limb from limb--like that," and I jumped toward the great
brute with a loud "Boo!" that sent him stumbling backward.
<P>
I took a long chance, I realized, but if we could make
any capital out of Perry's harmless mania I wanted to make
it while the making was prime.  It worked splendidly.
The Sagoths treated us both with marked respect during
the balance of the journey, and then passed the word along
to their masters, the Mahars.
<P>
Two marches after this episode we came to the city of Phutra.
The entrance to it was marked by two lofty towers of granite,
which guarded a flight of steps leading to the buried city.
Sagoths were on guard here as well as at a hundred or more
other towers scattered about over a large plain.
