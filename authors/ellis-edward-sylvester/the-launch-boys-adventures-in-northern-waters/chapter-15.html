<p>Alvin easily caught the swing of the bass and sang when the chorus
was reached. Mike barely touched the keys, bringing out a few
faint chords that could not add to the sweetness of his voice.
Mrs. Friestone sat motionless, looking intently at him until he
came to the last words. Then she abruptly took off her glasses
and put her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>

<p>The sweet long ago! Again she saw the handsome, sturdy youth
when he returned from the war for the defence of his country,
as brave, as resolute, as aflame with patriotism as in his earlier
years, but with frame wrenched by painful wounds. Their lives
were inexpressibly happy from the time she became a bride, and
their maturer age was blessed by the gift of darling Nora. Existence
became one grand sweet dream&mdash;more happy, more radiant and more
a foretaste of what awaited them all in the great beyond. That
loved form had vanished in the sweet long ago, but the memory
could never fade or grow dim.</p>

<p>It was the song that brought back the picture with a vividness
it had not worn for many a year. The tears would come, and Nora,
glancing at her mother, buried her face in her own handkerchief
and sobbed. Alvin and Chester sat silent, and Mike, turning gently
on the stool, looked sympathetically at mother and daughter.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mike," came a soft, choking voice from behind the
snowy bit of linen, and the brave lad winked rapidly and fought
back the tears that crowded into his honest eyes.</p>

<p>It was not strange that the effect of Mike Murphy's beautiful
singing of the touching songs brooded like a benison throughout
the evening. Even Nora, when asked to favor them again, shook
her head.</p>

<p>"Not after Mike," she replied, her eyes gleaming more brightly
through the moisture not yet dried.</p>

<p>It was impossible for the Irish lad to restrain his humor, and
soon he had them all smiling, but there was no loud laughter such
as greeted his first sallies, and the conversation as a whole
was soberer and more thoughtful. Alvin and Chester told of their
school experiences, and finally Mike related his adventure when
marooned on the lonely island well out toward the Atlantic and
his friends found him after they had given him up as drowned.</p>

<p>So the evening wore away until, at a seasonable hour, the head
of the household said that when they wished to retire she would
show them to their room. Just then Mike had his hand over his
mouth in the effort to repress a yawn. Nora laughingly pointed
at him.</p>

<p>"In a few minutes he'll be asleep and will tumble off his chair."</p>

<p>"I'm afeard ye're right, as I replied to me tacher whin he obsarved
that I was the biggest numskull in Tipperary County. Come, Captain
and sicond mate&mdash;ye won't forgit, Miss Nora, that I'm <em>first</em>
mate of the battleship <em>Deerfut</em>."</p>

<p>The girl went to the kitchen from which she speedily returned,
carrying a hand lamp, which she gave to her mother. She nodded
to the lads, who followed her to the door of the apartment assigned
them for the night. They entered behind her as she set the light
on the stand and turned about.</p>

<p>"I think you will find everything as you wish."</p>

<p>"It couldn't be itherwise, whin it's yersilf that has provided
the same. Be that token, we're getting more than we desarve."</p>

<p>"Nothing could be finer," added Alvin, glancing round the lighted
room. "It's as neat as a pin and we shall sleep the sleep of the
just."</p>

<p>The three had noticed when in the parlor the portrait suspended
in the place of honor. The blue uniform, the military cap resting
on one knee, and the strong, expressive face told their own story.
It was the picture of Captain Carter Friestone, taken many a year
before, when in the flush of his patriotic young manhood. A smaller
picture was on the wall of the bedroom of mother and daughter.</p>

<p>The chamber which the lads entered was graced with two small,
inexpensive pictures of a religious character, a pretty rug covered
most of the floor, the walls were tastefully papered and there
were several chairs, to say nothing of the mirror, stand and other
conveniences.</p>

<p>Not only was the broad bed with its snowy counterpane and downy
pillows roomy enough for two, but a wide cot had been placed on
the other side of the neat little room for whoever chose to sleep
upon it.</p>

<p>That which caught the eye of the three was a musket leaning in
the far corner. Chester stepped across, and asking permission
of Mrs. Friestone, picked it up and brought it over to where the
light was stronger. He saw it was a Springfield rifle, but the
lock and base of the barrel were torn into gaping rents.</p>

<p>"I suppose this belonged to the captain," said Chester inquiringly.
The widow nodded her head.</p>

<p>"And it did good service&mdash;that is certain," added Chester, with
his companions beside him scrutinizing the weapon. "But it seems
to have been injured."</p>

<p>She smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"Carter brought it home from the war, declaring it was better
than when new. He put a double charge in one Fourth of July morning,
forgetting that the weapon was much worn from many previous firings.
It exploded at the lock and came very near killing him. But,"
she added, with a sigh, "it is very precious to me."</p>

<p>"I am sure of that," said Chester as he reverently carried the
gun back to the corner.</p>

<p>The good woman kissed each lad on the forehead. When she thus
saluted Mike, who was the last, she placed her thin hand on his
head, and said with infinite tenderness:</p>

<p>"I thank you for what you did to-night."</p>

<p>"I beg ye don't mintion it&#11834;"</p>

<p>Mike stopped abruptly, and pretending to see something interesting
in the old rifle, hurried across the room to examine it more closely.</p>

<p>"Good night and pleasant dreams," called the lady as she passed
out, noiselessly closing the door behind her.</p>

<p>It having been agreed that Mike should use the cot, the three
prepared for retiring, the mind of each full of the experience
of the evening. Both Alvin and Chester wished to speak of the
extraordinary voice of Mike, but neither did, for they knew he
would prefer they should not. He could not help knowing how greatly
he had been favored by nature, and disliked any reminder.</p>

<p>The wick of the lamp was turned down and blown out by Alvin,
after glancing around and noting that his companions were ready.
Through the raised window, opening over a broad alley, the cool
wind stole. It so came about that for several days and nights,
including the one of which I am now speaking, the leading cities
of the country, embracing even Boston, were suffering from one
of the most intense heat waves that ever swept like a furnace
blast over most of the States in the Union. But in favored southern
Maine it was ideally cool. You could stand a thin covering at
night, or you could cast it aside. You were equally comfortable
in either situation.</p>

<p>Our young friends ought to have sunk into a sound sleep within
a few minutes after lying down, but they did not. Something was
on their minds, and the singular fact of it was that the thoughts
of each were identically the same, though as yet not a hint had
been dropped by anyone.</p>

<p>It was Mike who abruptly spoke:</p>

<p>"I say, Captain, are ye aslaap?"</p>

<p>"I ought to be, but I was never wider awake."</p>

<p>"How about the second mate?"</p>

<p>"The same here," was the reply from that individual.</p>

<p>"I wish to obsarve that I'm engaged just now in thinking, byes."</p>

<p>"Thinking of what?" asked Alvin.</p>

<p>"'Spose them post office robbers should pay this place a visit."</p>

<p>"What in the world put that in your head?"</p>

<p>"Didn't the same thought come to ye, Captain?"</p>

<p>"I must admit it did."</p>

<p>"And how is it with the second mate?"</p>

<p>"It has troubled me, too, Mike."</p>

<p>"But I can see no real cause for misgiving," added Alvin.</p>

<p>"We know the <em>Water Witch</em> is somewhere in the neighborhood,"
remarked Chester, to which his chum replied:</p>

<p>"What could attract them to a small office like this? They hunt
for bigger game."</p>

<p>"There's a good lot of money in the safe downstairs," said Mike.
"'Twas mesilf that obsarved one of the leddy's callers gave her
twinty-five hundred dollars, which she put away. Where could the
spalpeens make a bigger haul?"</p>

<p>"But how should they know about it? They didn't see it done,"
said Alvin.</p>

<p>"Hist, now! From what me eyes told me, the same being anither
chap called and would have lift more, had he not been afeard of
me eagle eye that was on him."</p>

<p>"What of that?"</p>

<p>"Doesn't it show that it's the practice in Beartown wid some
of them as has lots of money to lave the same wid the leddy? Thim
chaps are prying round and it would be aisy fur 'em to larn the
fact."</p>

<p>"We should have seen something of them if they were in this village."</p>

<p>Alvin felt the weakness of this statement, for such unwelcome
visitors would be too shrewd to expose themselves to discovery
when it was possible to avoid it. All three might have been in
Beartown for hours without drawing attention to themselves and
without giving Mike, during his earlier visit, a glimpse of them.</p>

<p>Speculating in this manner, Alvin and Mike came to the belief,
or rather hope, that their good friend was in no danger of a burglarious
visit. Chester would not be convinced, but expressed the hope
that they were right.</p>

<p>"I shall make bold to remind Mrs. Friestone in the morning of
the risk she runs and advise her to cease accepting any outside
deposits."</p>

<p>Chester was the last to fall asleep. It was a long time before
he sank into slumber, but by and by he glided into the realm of
dreams. He had no means of knowing how long he lay unconscious,
when he gradually became aware of a peculiar tapping somewhere
near. A moment's listening told him that someone was knocking
on the door.</p>
