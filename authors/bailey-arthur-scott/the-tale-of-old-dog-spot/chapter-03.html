<p>Old dog Spot felt greatly pleased with himself. He had told everybody
that would listen to him how he could make Miss Kitty Cat angry just by
standing still and pointing at her.
</p>
<p>"You'd better leave that cat alone," the old horse Ebenezer advised him.
"Don't you remember how she clawed you when you cornered her in this
barn one day?"
</p><p>"I remember--yes!" Spot admitted, as he looked cross-eyed at his nose,
which still bore the marks of Miss Kitty's claws. "I'm careful not to
stand too near her," he explained. "I don't try to grab her. I just
stare at her. And she gets wild."
</p><p>"A wild cat," old Ebenezer warned him, "is a dangerous creature."
</p><p>"Nonsense!" said Spot. "She always sneaks away after I've pointed at her
for a few minutes. It's the funniest sight! If you could see it once
you'd know she was terribly afraid of me."
</p><p>"Nonsense!" said the old horse Ebenezer. But he couldn't make Spot
believe there was the slightest danger in teasing Miss Kitty Cat.
</p><p>"She always runs up a tree after I've been pointing at her," Spot went
on.
</p><p>"You'd better look out!" Ebenezer cautioned him. "She'll have you
climbing a tree the first thing you know."
</p><p>Well, that made Spot laugh. And he went out of the barn feeling even
more pleased with himself than ever. He was sorry that Miss Kitty Cat
wasn't in the yard. He felt just like bothering her.
</p><p>"I'll go up to the pasture and find me a woodchuck to chase," Spot said
to himself, for he was in such high spirits that he simply had to have
fun of some sort.
</p><p>First, however, he decided to stop and dig up a bone that he had buried
in the flower garden. So he trotted across the yard. And as he drew near
the farmhouse he changed his plans all at once. He forgot his bone and
he forgot his woodchuck, too. For he caught sight of something that had
escaped his eye before. Stretched on the ledge outside one of the
kitchen windows Miss Kitty Cat was enjoying a nap in the sunshine.
</p><p>"Aha!" said Spot very softly. "Aha! Here's a bit of luck." And he turned
sharply aside and hurried towards the house, to come to a dead stop
beneath the window and stand there motionless with his nose pointing at
the sleeping form of Miss Kitty.
</p><p>Though Spot didn't make the slightest noise the sleeper suddenly opened
her eyes.
</p><p>"_Tchah!_" she exclaimed, springing to her feet and glaring at her
annoyer.
</p><p>If the window hadn't been closed no doubt Miss Kitty would have slipped
through it into the kitchen. But there was no escape that way.
</p><p>"It's a pity," she muttered, "that a person can't take a cat nap without
being stared at by this old dog. I think it's about time I took my
neighbor's advice and taught him to keep his eyes and his nose where
they belong."
</p><p>Then Miss Kitty Cat jumped. She jumped off the window ledge straight at
old dog Spot, who was still gazing up at her from below.
</p><p>When he saw her coming he gave a startled yelp and tried to dodge her.
But he was too slow. Miss Kitty Cat landed squarely on his back and
clawed him savagely.
</p><p>Old Spot dashed half way across the farmyard, then dropped suddenly and
rolled over and over on the ground.
</p><p>The next instant he was on his feet again and tearing toward the barn.
Though Miss Kitty had dropped off his back and was already on her way to
the house he did not look around to see what had become of her.
</p><p>Spot bolted through the barn door and scurried into an empty stall,
where he jumped into the manger and cowered down in the hay that half
filled it, and moaned.
</p><p>[Illustration: Spot Bolted Through the Barn Door.

</p><p>It was the stall next to the old horse Ebenezer's. And that mild fellow
peered over at him in wonder. "What has happened?" he inquired.
</p><p>"The cat scratched me," Spot told him. "I was teasing her and she wasn't
at all nice about it."
</p><p>"What were you doing--pointing at her?" Ebenezer asked him.
</p><p>"Yes!"
</p><p>"I suppose it made her wild," the old horse remarked. "And a wild cat is
a dangerous creature."
</p><p>Spot whined fretfully. He wished he could lick his wounds. But how can
one lick scratches when they are behind one's ears?
</p><p>"I was a wild dog for a few moments," he groaned. "I never dreamed she
would plump down on me like that."
</p><p>"Haven't you ever heard of it's raining cats and dogs?" Ebenezer said.
"Well, to-day it rained cats."
