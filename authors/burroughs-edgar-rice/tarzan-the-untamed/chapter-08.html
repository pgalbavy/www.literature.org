<P>
Three days the ape-man spent in resting and recuperating,
eating fruits and nuts and the smaller animals that were
most easily bagged, and upon the fourth he set out to
explore the valley and search for the great apes. Time was a
negligible factor in the equation of life -- it was all the same
to Tarzan if he reached the west coast in a month or a year
or three years. All time was his and all Africa. His was abso-
lute freedom -- the last tie that had bound him to civilization
and custom had been severed. He was alone but he was not
exactly lonely. The greater part of his life had been spent
thus, and though there was no other of his kind, he was at all
times surrounded by the jungle peoples for whom familiarity
had bred no contempt within his breast. The least of them in-
terested him, and, too, there were those with whom he always
made friends easily, and there were his hereditary enemies
whose presence gave a spice to life that might otherwise have
become humdrum and monotonous.
<P>
And so it was that on the fourth day he set out to explore
the valley and search for his fellow-apes. He had proceeded
southward for a short distance when his nostrils were assailed
by the scent of man, of Gomangani, the black man. There
were many of them, and mixed with their scent was another --
that of a she Tarmangani.
<P>
Swinging through the trees Tarzan approached the authors
of these disturbing scents. He came warily from the flank,
but paying no attention to the wind, for he knew that man
with his dull senses could apprehend him only through his eyes
or ears and then only when comparatively close. Had he been
stalking Numa or Sheeta he would have circled about until his
quarry was upwind from him, thus taking practically all the
advantage up to the very moment that he came within sight
or hearing; but in the stalking of the dull clod, man, he ap-
proached with almost contemptuous indifference, so that all
the jungle about him knew that he was passing -- all but the
men he stalked.
<P>
From the dense foliage of a great tree he watched them
pass -- a disreputable mob of blacks, some garbed in the uni-
form of German East African native troops, others wearing a
single garment of the same uniform, while many had reverted
to the simple dress of their forbears -- approximating nudity.
There were many black women with them, laughing and talk-
ing as they kept pace with the men, all of whom were armed
with German rifles and equipped with German belts and am-
munition.
<P>
There were no white officers there, but it was none the less
apparent to Tarzan that these men were from some German
native command, and he guessed that they had slain their
officers and taken to the jungle with their women, or had stolen
some from native villages through which they must have
passed. It was evident that they were putting as much ground
between themselves and the coast as possible and doubtless
were seeking some impenetrable fastness of the vast interior
where they might inaugurate a reign of terror among the
primitively armed inhabitants and by raiding, looting, and
rape grow rich in goods and women at the expense of the
district upon which they settled themselves.
<P>
Between two of the black women marched a slender white
girl. She was hatless and with torn and disheveled clothing
that had evidently once been a trim riding habit. Her coat
was gone and her waist half torn from her body. Occasionally
and without apparent provocation one or the other of the
Negresses struck or pushed her roughly. Tarzan watched
through half-closed eyes. His first impulse was to leap among
them and bear the girl from their cruel clutches. He had
recognized her immediately and it was because of this fact that
he hesitated.
<P>
What was it to Tarzan of the Apes what fate befell this en-
emy spy? He had been unable to kill her himself because of
an inherent weakness that would not permit him to lay hands
upon a woman, all of which of course had no bearing upon
what others might do to her. That her fate would now be
infinitely more horrible than the quick and painless death that
the ape-man would have meted to her only interested Tarzan
to the extent that the more frightful the end of a German the
more in keeping it would be with what they all deserved.
<P>
And so he let the blacks pass with Fraulein Bertha Kircher
in their midst, or at least until the last straggling warrior
sug-
gested to his mind the pleasures of blackbaiting -- an amuse-
ment and a sport in which he had grown ever more proficient
since that long-gone day when Kulonga, the son of Mbonga,
the chief, had cast his unfortunate spear at Kala, the ape-man's
foster mother.
<P>
The last man, who must have stopped for some purpose,
was fully a quarter of a mile in rear of the party. He was
hurrying to catch up when Tarzan saw him, and as he passed
beneath the tree in which the ape-man perched above the trail,
a silent noose dropped deftly about his neck. The main body
still was in plain sight, and as the frightened man voiced a
piercing shriek of terror, they looked back to see his body rise
as though by magic straight into the air and disappear amidst
the leafy foliage above.
<P>
For a moment the blacks stood paralyzed by astonishment
and fear; but presently the burly sergeant, Usanga, who led
them, started back along the trail at a run, calling to the
others
to follow him. Loading their guns as they came the blacks
ran to succor their fellow, and at Usanga's command they
spread into a thin line that presently entirely surrounded the
tree into which their comrade had vanished.
<P>
Usanga called but received no reply; then he advanced
slowly with rifle at the ready, peering up into the tree. He
could see no one -- nothing. The circle closed in until fifty
blacks were searching among the branches with their keen
eyes. What had become of their fellow? They had seen him
rise into the tree and since then many eyes had been fastened
upon the spot, yet there was no sign of him. One, more ven-
turesome than his fellows, volunteered to climb into the tree
and investigate. He was gone but a minute or two and when
he dropped to earth again he swore that there was no sign of
a creature there.
<P>
Perplexed, and by this time a bit awed, the blacks drew
slowly away from the spot and with many backward glances
and less laughing continued upon their journey until, when
about a mile beyond the spot at which their fellow had disap-
peared, those in the lead saw him peering from behind a tree
at one side of the trail just in front of them. With shouts to
their companions that he had been found they ran forwards;
but those who were first to reach the tree stopped suddenly
and shrank back, their eyes rolling fearfully first in one direc-
tion and then in another as though they expected some name-
less horror to leap out upon them.
<P>
Nor was their terror without foundation. Impaled upon the
end of a broken branch the head of their companion was
propped behind the tree so that it appeared to be looking out
at them from the opposite side of the bole.
<P>
It was then that many wished to turn back, arguing that they
had offended some demon of the wood upon whose preserve
they had trespassed; but Usanga refused to listen to them,
assuring them that inevitable torture and death awaited them
should they return and fall again into the hands of their cruel
German masters. At last his reasoning prevailed to the end
that a much-subdued and terrified band moved in a compact
mass, like a drove of sheep, forward through the valley and
there were no stragglers.
<P>
It is a happy characteristic of the Negro race, which they
hold in common with little children, that their spirits seldom
remain depressed for a considerable length of time after the
immediate cause of depression is removed, and so it was that
in half an hour Usanga's band was again beginning to take
on to some extent its former appearance of carefree light-
heartedness. Thus were the heavy clouds of fear slowly dis-
sipating when a turn in the trail brought them suddenly upon
the headless body of their erstwhile companion lying directly
in their path, and they were again plunged into the depth of
fear and gloomy forebodings.
<P>
So utterly inexplicable and uncanny had the entire occur-
rence been that there was not a one of them who could find
a ray of comfort penetrating the dead blackness of its ominous
portent. What had happened to one of their number each
conceived as being a wholly possible fate for himself -- in fact
quite his probable fate. If such a thing could happen in broad
daylight what frightful thing might not fall to their lot when
night had enshrouded them in her mantle of darkness. They
trembled in anticipation.
<P>
The white girl in their midst was no less mystified than they;
but far less moved, since sudden death was the most merciful
fate to  which she might now look forward. So far she had
been subjected to nothing worse than the petty cruelties of the
women, while, on the other hand, it had alone been the pres-
ence of the women that had saved her from worse treatment
at the hands of some of the men -- notably the brutal, black
sergeant, Usanga. His own woman was of the party -- a
veritable giantess, a virago of the first magnitude -- and she
was
evidently the only thing in the world of which Usanga stood
in awe. Even though she was particularly cruel to the young
woman, the latter believed that she was her sole protection
from the degraded black tyrant.
<P>
Late in the afternoon the band came upon a small palisaded
village of thatched huts set in a clearing in the jungle close
beside a placid river. At their approach the villagers came
pouring out, and Usanga advanced with two of his warriors to
palaver with the chief. The experiences of the day had so
shaken the nerves of the black sergeant that he was ready to
treat with these people rather than take their village by force
of arms, as would ordinarily have been his preference; but now
a vague conviction influenced him that there watched over this
part of the jungle a powerful demon who wielded miraculous
power for evil against those who offended him. First Usanga
would learn how these villagers stood with this savage god
and if they had his good will Usanga would be most careful
to treat them with kindness and respect.
<P>
At the palaver it developed that the village chief had food,
goats, and fowl which he would be glad to dispose of for
a proper consideration; but as the consideration would have
meant parting with precious rifles and ammunition, or the
very clothing from their backs, Usanga began to see that after
all it might be forced upon him to wage war to obtain food.
<P>
A happy solution was arrived at by a suggestion of one of
his men -- that the soldiers go forth the following day and hunt
for the villagers, bringing them in so much fresh meat in re-
turn for their hospitality. This the chief agreed to, stipulating
the kind and quantity of game to be paid in return for flour,
goats, and fowl, and a certain number of huts that were to be
turned over to the visitors. The details having been settled
after an hour or more of that bickering argument of which the
native African is so fond, the newcomers entered the village
where they were assigned to huts.
<P>
Bertha Kircher found herself alone in a small hut to the
palisade at the far end of the village street, and though she was
neither bound nor guarded, she was assured by Usanga
that she could not escape the village without running into almost
certain death in the jungle, which the villagers assured them
was infested by lions of great size and ferocity. "Be good to
Usanga," he concluded, "and no harm will befall you. I will
come again to see you after the others are asleep. Let us be
friends."
<P>
As the brute left her the girl's frame was racked by a con-
vulsive shudder as she sank to the floor of the hut and cov-
ered her face with her hands. She realized now why the
women had not been left to guard her. It was the work of
the cunning Usanga, but would not his woman suspect some-
thing of his intentions? She was no fool and, further, being
imbued with insane jealousy she was ever looking for some
overt act upon the part of her ebon lord. Bertha Kircher felt
that only she might save her and that she would save her if
word could be but gotten to her. But how?
<P>
Left alone and away from the eyes of her captors for the
first time since the previous night, the girl immediately took
advantage of the opportunity to assure herself that the papers
she had taken from the body of Hauptmann Fritz Schneider
were still safely sewn inside one of her undergarments.
<P>
Alas! Of what value could they now ever be to her be-
loved country? But habit and loyalty were so strong within
her that she still clung to the determined hope of eventually
delivering the little packet to her chief.
<P>
The natives seemed to have forgotten her existence -- no
one came near the hut, not even to bring her food. She could
hear them at the other end of the village laughing and yelling
and knew that they were celebrating with food and native
beer -- knowledge which only increased her apprehension. To
be prisoner in a native village in the very heart of an unex-
plored region of Central Africa -- the only white woman among
a band of drunken Negroes! The very thought appalled her.
Yet there was a slight promise in the fact that she had so far
been unmolested -- the promise that they might, indeed, have
forgotten her and that soon they might become so hopelessly
drunk as to be harmless.
<P>
Darkness had fallen and still no one came. The girl won-
dered if she dared venture forth in search of Naratu, Usanga's
woman, for Usanga might not forget that he had promised to
return. No one was near as she stepped out of the hut and
made her way toward the part of the village where the revelers
were making merry about a fire. As she approached she
saw the villagers and their guests squatting in a large circle
about the blaze before which a half-dozen naked warriors
leaped and bent and stamped in some grotesque dance. Pots
of food and gourds of drink were being passed about among
the audience. Dirty hands were plunged into the food pots
and the captured portions devoured so greedily that one might
have thought the entire community had been upon the point
of starvation. The gourds they held to their lips until the
beer ran down their chins and the vessels were wrested from
them by greedy neighbors. The drink had now begun to
take noticeable effect upon most of them, with the result
that they were beginning to give themselves up to utter and
licentious abandon.
<P>
As the girl came nearer, keeping in the shadow of the huts,
looking for Naratu she was suddenly discovered by one upon
the edge of the crowd -- a huge woman, who rose, shrieking,
and came toward her. From her aspect the white girl thought
that the woman meant literally to tear her to pieces. So ut-
terly wanton and uncalled-for was the attack that it found
the girl entirely unprepared, and what would have happened
had not a warrior interfered may only be guessed. And then
Usanga, noting the interruption, came lurching forward to
question her.
<P>
"What do you want," he cried, "food and drink? Come
with me!" and he threw an arm about her and dragged her
toward the circle.
<P>
"No!" she cried, "I want Naratu. Where is Naratu?"
<P>
This seemed to sober the black for a moment as though he
had temporarily forgotten his better half. He cast quick, fear-
ful glances about, and then, evidently assured that Naratu
had noticed nothing, he ordered the warrior who was still
holding the infuriated black woman from the white girl to
take the latter back to her hut and to remain there on guard
over her.
<P>
First appropriating a gourd of beer for himself the warrior
motioned the girl to precede him, and thus guarded she re-
turned to her hut, the fellow squatting down just outside the
doorway, where he confined his attentions for some time to
the gourd.
<P>
Bertha Kircher sat down at the far side of the hut awaiting
she knew not what impending fate. She could not sleep so
filled was her mind with wild schemes of escape though each
new one must always be discarded as impractical. Half an
hour after the warrior had returned her to her prison he rose
and entered the hut, where he tried to engage in conversation
with her. Groping across the interior he leaned his short spear
against the wall and sat down beside her, and as he talked he
edged closer and closer until at last he could reach out and
touch her. Shrinking, she drew away.
<P>
"Do not touch me!" she cried. "I will tell Usanga if you do
not leave me alone, and you know what he will do to you."
<P>
The man only laughed drunkenly, and, reaching out his
hand, grabbed her arm and dragged her toward him. She
fought and cried aloud for Usanga and at the same instant the
entrance to the hut was darkened by the form of a man.
<P>
"What is the matter?" shouted the newcomer in the deep
tones that the girl recognized as belonging to the black ser-
geant. He had come, but would she be any better off? She
knew that she would not unless she could play upon Usanga's
fear of his woman.
<P>
When Usanga found what had happened he kicked the war-
rior out of the hut and bade him begone, and when the fel-
low had disappeared, muttering and grumbling, the sergeant
approached the white girl. He was very drunk, so drunk that
several times she succeeded in eluding him and twice she
pushed him so violently away that he stumbled and fell.
<P>
Finally he became enraged and rushing upon her, seized her
in his long, apelike arms. Striking at his face with clenched
fists she tried to protect herself and drive him away. She
threatened him with the wrath of Naratu, and at that he
changed his tactics and began to plead, and as he argued with
her, promising her safety and eventual freedom, the warrior
he had kicked out of the hut made his staggering way to the
hut occupied by Naratu.
<P>
Usanga finding that pleas and promises were as unavailing
as threats, at last lost both his patience and his head, seizing
the girl roughly, and simultaneously there burst into the hut
a raging demon of jealousy. Naratu had come. Kicking,
scratching, striking, biting, she routed the terrified Usanga in
short order, and so obsessed was she by her desire to inflict
punishment upon her unfaithful lord and master that she quite
forgot the object of his infatuation.
<P>
Bertha Kircher heard her screaming down the village street
at Usanga's heels and trembled at the thought of what lay in
store for her at the hands of these two, for she knew that to-
morrow at the latest Naratu would take out upon her the full
measure of her jealous hatred after she had spent her first
wrath upon Usanga.
<P>
The two had departed but a few minutes when the warrior
guard returned. He looked into the hut and then entered.
"No one will stop me now, white woman," he growled as he
stepped quickly across the hut toward her.
<P>
Tarzan of the Apes, feasting well upon a juicy haunch from
Bara, the deer, was vaguely conscious of a troubled mind.
He should have been at peace with himself and all the world,
for was he not in his native element surrounded by game in
plenty and rapidly filling his belly with the flesh he loved
best?
But Tarzan of the Apes was haunted by the picture of a slight,
young girl being shoved and struck by brutal Negresses, and
in imagination could see her now camped in this savage coun-
try a prisoner among degraded blacks.
<P>
Why was it so difficult to remember that she was only a
hated German and a spy? Why would the fact that she was a
woman and white always obtrude itself upon his conscious-
ness? He hated her as he hated all her kind, and the fate that
was sure to be hers was no more terrible than she in common
with all her people deserved. The matter was settled and Tar-
zan composed himself to think of other things, yet the picture
would not die -- it rose in all its details and annoyed him. He
began to wonder what they were doing to her and where they
were taking her. He was very much ashamed of himself as he
had been after the episode in Wilhelmstal when his weakness
had permitted him to spare this spy's life. Was he to be thus
weak again? No!
<P>
Night came and he settled himself in an ample tree to rest
until morning; but sleep would not come. Instead came the
vision of a white girl being beaten by black women, and again
of the same girl at the mercy of the warriors somewhere in
that dark and forbidding jungle.
<P>
With a growl of anger and self-contempt Tarzan arose,
shook himself, and swung from his tree to that adjoining, and
thus, through the lower terraces, he followed the trail that
Usanga's party had taken earlier in the afternoon. He had
little difficulty as the band had followed a well-beaten path
and when toward midnight the stench of a native village as-
sailed his delicate nostrils he guessed that his goal was near
and that presently he should find her whom he sought.
<P>
Prowling stealthily as prowls Numa, the lion, stalking a
wary prey, Tarzan moved noiselessly about the palisade, lis-
tening and sniffing. At the rear of the village he discovered a
tree whose branches extended over the top of the palisade and
a moment later he had dropped quietly into the village.
<P>
From hut to hut he went searching with keen ears and
nostrils some confirming evidence of the presence of the girl,
and at last, faint and almost obliterated by the odor of the
Gomangani, he found it hanging like a delicate vapor about a
small hut. The village was quiet now, for the last of the beer
and the food had been disposed of and the blacks lay in their
huts overcome by stupor, yet Tarzan made no noise that even
a sober man keenly alert might have heard.
<P>
He passed around to the entrance of the hut and listened. 
From within came no sound, not even the low breathing of
one awake; yet he was sure that the girl had been here and
perhaps was even now, and so he entered, slipping in as
silently as a disembodied spirit. For a moment he stood mo-
tionless just within the entranceway, listening. No, there was
no one here, of that he was sure, but he would investigate.
As his eyes became accustomed to the greater darkness within
the hut an object began to take form that presently outlined
itself in a human form supine upon the floor.
<P>
Tarzan stepped closer and leaned over to examine it -- it
was the dead body of a naked warrior from whose chest pro-
truded a short spear. Then he searched carefully every square
foot of the remaining floor space and at last returned to the
body again where he stooped and smelled of the haft of the
weapon that had slain the black. A slow smile touched his
lips -- that and a slight movement of his head betokened that
he understood.
<P>
A rapid search of the balance of the village assured him that
the girl had escaped and a feeling of relief came over him
that no harm had befallen her. That her life was equally in
jeopardy in the savage jungle to which she must have flown
did not impress him as it would have you or me, since to
Tarzan the jungle was not a dangerous place -- he considered
one safer there than in Paris or London by night.
<P>
He had entered the trees again and was outside the palisade
when there came faintly to his ears from far beyond the vil-
lage an old, familiar sound. Balancing lightly upon a swaying
branch he stood, a graceful statue of a forest god, listening
intently. For a minute he stood thus and then there broke
from his lips the long, weird cry of ape calling to ape and he
was away through the jungle toward the sound of the boom-
ing drum of the anthropoids leaving behind him an awakened
and terrified village of cringing blacks, who would forever
after connect that eerie cry with the disappearance of their
white prisoner and the death of their fellow-warrior.
<P>
Bertha Kircher, hurrying through the jungle along a well-
beaten game trail, thought only of putting as much distance as
possible between herself and the village before daylight could
permit pursuit of her. Whither she was going she did not
know, nor was it a matter of great moment since death must
be her lot sooner or later.
<P>
Fortune favored her that night, for she passed unscathed
through as savage and lion-ridden an area as there is in all
Africa -- a natural hunting ground which the white man has
not yet discovered, where deer and antelope and zebra, giraffe
and elephant, buffalo, rhinoceros, and the other herbivorous
animals of central Africa abound unmolested by none but their
natural enemies, the great cats which, lured here by easy prey
and immunity from the rifles of big-game hunters, swarm the
district.
<P>
She had fled for an hour or two, perhaps, when her attention
was arrested by the sound of animals moving about, muttering
and growling close ahead. Assured that she had covered a
sufficient distance to insure her a good start in the morning
before the blacks could take to her trail, and fearful of what
the creatures might be, she climbed into a large tree with the
intention of spending the balance of the night there.
<P>
She had no sooner reached a safe and comfortable branch
when she discovered that the tree stood upon the edge of a
small clearing that had been hidden from her by the heavy
undergrowth upon the ground below, and simultaneously she
discovered the identity of the beasts she had heard.
<P>
In the center of the clearing below her, clearly visible in
the bright moonlight, she saw fully twenty huge, manlike apes
-- great, shaggy fellows who went upon their hind feet with
only slight assistance from the knuckles of their hands. The
moonlight glanced from their glossy coats, the numerous gray-
tipped hairs imparting a sheen that made the hideous creatures
almost magnificent in their appearance.
<P>
The girl had watched them but a minute or two when the
little band was joined by others, coming singly and in groups
until there were fully fifty of the great brutes gathered there
in the moonlight. Among them were young apes and several
little ones clinging tightly to their mothers' shaggy shoulders.
Presently the group parted to form a circle about what ap-
peared to be a small, flat-topped mound of earth in the center
of the clearing. Squatting close about this mound were three
old females armed with short, heavy clubs with which they
presently began to pound upon the flat top of the earth mound
which gave forth a dull, booming sound, and almost imme-
diately the other apes commenced to move about restlessly,
weaving in and out aimlessly until they carried the impression
of a moving mass of great, black maggots.
<P>
The beating of the drum was in a slow, ponderous cadence,
at first without time but presently settling into a heavy rhythm
to which the apes kept time with measured tread and sway-
ing bodies. Slowly the mass separated into two rings, the
outer of which was composed of shes and the very young, the
inner of mature bulls. The former ceased to move and
squatted upon their haunches, while the bulls now moved
slowly about in a circle the center of which was the drum and
all now in the same direction.
<P>
It was then that there came faintly to the ears of the girl
from the direction of the village she had recently quitted a
weird and high-pitched cry. The effect upon the apes was
electrical -- they stopped their movements and stood in atti-
tudes of intent listening for a moment, and then one fellow,
huger than his companions, raised his face to the heavens and
in a voice that sent the cold shudders through the girl's slight
frame answered the far-off cry.
<P>
Once again the beaters took up their drumming and the slow
dance went on. There was a certain fascination in the savage
ceremony that held the girl spellbound, and as there seemed
little likelihood of her being discovered, she felt that she
might
as well remain the balance of the night in her tree and r�sum�
her flight by the comparatively greater safety of daylight.
<P>
Assuring herself that her packet of papers was safe she
sought as comfortable a position as possible among the
branches, and settled herself to watch the weird proceedings
in the clearing below her.
<P>
A half-hour passed, during which the cadence of the drum
increased gradually. Now the great bull that had replied to
the distant call leaped from the inner circle to dance alone
between the drummers and the other bulls. He leaped and
crouched and leaped again, now growling and barking, again
stopping to raise his hideous face to Goro, the moon, and,
beating upon his shaggy breast, uttered a piercing scream --
the challenge of the bull ape, had the girl but known it.
<P>
He stood thus in the full glare of the great moon, motionless
after screaming forth his weird challenge, in the setting of the
primeval jungle and the circling apes a picture of primitive
savagery and power -- a mightily muscled Hercules out of the
dawn of life -- when from close behind her the girl heard an
answering scream, and an instant later saw an almost naked
white man drop from a near-by tree into the clearing.
<P>
Instantly the apes became a roaring, snarling pack of angry
beasts. Bertha Kircher held her breath. What maniac was
this who dared approach these frightful creatures in their
own haunts, alone against fifty? She saw the brown-skinned
figure bathed in moonlight walk straight toward the snarling
pack. She saw the symmetry and the beauty of that perfect
body -- its grace, its strength, its wondrous proportioning, and
then she recognized him. It was the same creature whom she
had seen carry Major Schneider from General Kraut's head-
quarters, the same who had rescued her from Numa, the lion;
the same whom she had struck down with the butt of her
pistol and escaped when he would have returned her to her
enemies, the same who had slain Hauptmann Fritz Schneider
and spared her life that night in Wilhelmstal.
<P>
Fear-filled and fascinated she watched him as he neared
the apes. She heard sounds issue from his throat -- sounds
identical with those uttered by the apes -- and though she
could scarce believe the testimony of her own ears, she knew
that this godlike creature was conversing with the brutes in
their own tongue.
<P>
Tarzan halted just before he reached the shes of the outer
circle. "I am Tarzan of the Apes!" he cried. "You do not
know me because I am of another tribe, but Tarzan comes in
peace or he comes to fight -- which shall it be? Tarzan will
talk with your king," and so saying he pushed straight forward
through the shes and the young who now gave way before
him, making a narrow lane through which he passed toward
the inner circle.
<P>
Shes and balus growled and bristled as he passed closer,
but none hindered him and thus he came to the inner circle of
bulls. Here bared fangs menaced him and growling faces
hideously contorted. "I am Tarzan," he repeated. "Tarzan
comes to dance the Dum-Dum with his brothers. Where is
your king?" Again he pressed forward and the girl in the tree
clapped her palms to her cheeks as she watched, wide-eyed,
this madman going to a frightful death. In another instant
they would be upon him, rending and tearing until that perfect
form had been ripped to shreds; but again the ring parted,
and though the apes roared and menaced him they did not
attack, and at last he stood in the inner circle close to the
drum
and faced the great king ape.
<P>
Again he spoke. "I am Tarzan of the Apes," he cried.
"Tarzan comes to live with his brothers. He will come in
peace and live in peace or he will kill; but he has come and
he will stay. Which -- shall Tarzan dance the Dum-Dum in
peace with his brothers, or shall Tarzan kill first?"
<P>
"I am Go-lat, King of the Apes," screamed the great bull.
"I kill! I kill! I kill!" and with a sullen roar he charged the
Tarmangani.
<P>
The ape-man, as the girl watched him, seemed entirely
unprepared for the charge and she looked to see him borne
down and slain at the first rush. The great bull was almost
upon him with huge hands outstretched to seize him before
Tarzan made a move, but when he did move his quickness
would have put Ara, the lightning, to shame. As darts for-
ward the head of Histah, the snake, so darted forward the
left hand of the man-beast as he seized the left wrist of his
antagonist. A quick turn and the bull's right arm was locked
beneath the right arm of his foe in a jujutsu hold that Tarzan
had learned among civilized men -- a hold with which he
might easily break the great bones, a hold that left the ape
helpless.
<P>
"I am Tarzan of the Apes!" screamed the ape-man. "Shall
Tarzan dance in peace or shall Tarzan kill?''
<P>
"I kill! I kill! I kill!" shrieked Go-lat.
<P>
With the quickness of a cat Tarzan swung the king ape
over one hip and sent him sprawling to the ground. "I am
Tarzan, King of all the Apes!" he shouted. "Shall it be peace?"
<P>
Go-lat, infuriated, leaped to his feet and charged again,
shouting his war cry: "I kill! I kill! I kill!" and again Tarzan
met him with a sudden hold that the stupid bull, being ig-
norant of, could not possibly avert -- a hold and a throw that
brought a scream of delight from the interested audience and
suddenly filled the girl with doubts as to the man's madness
-- evidently he was quite safe among the apes, for she saw
him swing Go-lat to his back and then catapult him over his
shoulder. The king ape fell upon his head and lay very still.
<P>
"I am Tarzan of the Apes!" cried the ape-man. "I come to
dance the Dum-Dum with my brothers," and he made a mo-
tion to the drummers, who immediately took up the cadence
of the dance where they had dropped it to watch their king
slay the foolish Tarmangani.
<P>
It was then that Go-lat raised his head and slowly crawled
to his feet. Tarzan approached him. "I am Tarzan of the
Apes," he cried. "Shall Tarzan dance the Dum-Dum with his
brothers now, or shall he kill first?"
<P>
Go-lat raised his bloodshot eyes to the face of the Tar-
mangani. "Kagoda!" he cried "Tarzan of the Apes will dance
the Dum-Dum with his brothers and Go-lat will dance with him!"
<P>
And then the girl in the tree saw the savage man leaping,
bending, and stamping with the savage apes in the ancient
rite of the Dum-Dum. His roars and growls were more
beastly than the beasts. His handsome face was distorted
with savage ferocity. He beat upon his great breast and
screamed forth his challenge as his smooth, brown hide
brushed the shaggy coats of his fellows. It was weird; it was
wonderful; and in its primitive savagery it was not without
beauty -- the strange scene she looked upon, such a scene as
no other human being, probably, ever had witnessed -- and
yet, withal, it was horrible.
<P>
As she gazed, spell-bound, a stealthy movement in the tree
behind her caused her to turn her head, and there, back of
her, blazing in the reflected moonlight, shone two great, yellow-
green eyes. Sheeta, the panther, had found her out.
<P>
The beast was so close that it might have reached out and
touched her with a great, taloned paw. There was no time to
think, no time to weigh chances or to choose alternatives.
Terror-inspired impulse was her guide as, with a loud scream,
she leaped from the tree into the clearing.
<P>
Instantly the apes, now maddened by the effects of the
dancing and the moonlight, turned to note the cause of the
interruption. They saw this she Tarmangani, helpless and
alone and they started for her. Sheeta, the panther, knowing
that not even Numa, the lion, unless maddened by starvation,
dares meddle with the great apes at their Dum-Dum, had
silently vanished into the night, seeking his supper elsewhere.
<P>
Tarzan, turning with the other apes toward the cause of the
interruption, saw the girl, recognized her and also her peril.
Here again might she die at the hands of others; but why con-
sider it! He knew that he could not permit it, and though the
acknowledgment shamed him, it had to be admitted.
<P>
The leading shes were almost upon the girl when Tarzan
leaped among them, and with heavy blows scattered them to
right and left; and then as the bulls came to share in the kill
they thought this new ape-thing was about to make that he
might steal all the flesh for himself, they found him facing
them with an arm thrown about the creature as though to
protect her.
<P>
"This is Tarzan's she," he said. "Do not harm her." It was
the only way he could make them understand that they must
not slay her. He was glad that she could not interpret the
words. It was humiliating enough to make such a statement
to wild apes about this hated enemy.
<P>
So once again Tarzan of the Apes was forced to protect a
Hun. Growling, he muttered to himself in extenuation:
<P>
"She is a woman and I am not a German, so it could not be
otherwise!"
