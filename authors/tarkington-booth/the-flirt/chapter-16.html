<p>The two girls let themselves into the house noiselessly, and,
turning out the hall-light, left for them by their mother, crept
upstairs on tiptoe; and went through the upper hall directly to
Laura's room &mdash;Cora's being nearer the sick-room. At their
age it is proper that a gayety be used three times: in anticipation,
and actually, and in after-rehearsal. The last was of course now
in order: they went to Laura's room to "talk it over." There was
no gas-fixture in this small chamber; but they found Laura's oil-lamp
burning brightly upon her writing-table.</p>

<p>"How queer!" said Laura with some surprise, as she closed the
door. "Mother never leaves the lamp lit for me; she's always so
afraid of lamps exploding."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Miss Peirce came in here to read, and forgot to turn
it out," suggested Cora, seating herself on the edge of the bed
and letting her silk wrap fall from her shoulders. "Oh, Laura,
wasn't he gorgeous. . . ."</p>

<p>She referred to the gallant defender of our seas, it appeared,
and while Laura undressed and got into a wrapper, Cora recounted
in detail the history of the impetuous sailor's enthrallment;&mdash;a
resume predicted three hours earlier by a gleeful whisper hissed
across the maritime shoulder as the sisters swung near each other
during a waltz: "<em>proposed</em>!"</p>

<p>"I've always heard they're horribly inconstant," she said, regretfully.
"But, oh, Laura, wasn't he beautiful to look at! Do you think
he's more beautiful than Val? No&mdash;don't tell me if you do. I don't
want to hear it! Val was so provoking: he didn't seem to mind
it at all. He's nothing but a big brute sometimes: he wouldn't
even admit that he minded, when I asked him. I was idiot enough
to ask; I couldn't help it; he was so tantalizing and exasperating&mdash;laughing
at me. I never knew anybody like him; he's so sure of himself
and he can be so cold. Sometimes I wonder if he really cares about
anything, deep down in his heart&mdash;anything except himself. He
seems so selfish: there are times when he almost makes me hate
him; but just when I get to thinking I do, I find I don't&mdash;he's
so deliciously strong, and there's such a <em>big</em> luxury
in being understood: I always feel he <em>knows</em> me clear
to the bone, somehow! But, oh," she sighed regretfully, "doesn't
a uniform become a man? They ought to all wear 'em. It would look
silly on such a little goat as that Wade Trumble, though: nothing
could make him look like a whole man. Did you see him glaring
at me? Beast! I was going to be so nice and kittenish and do all
my prettiest tricks for him, to help Val with his oil company.
Val thinks Wade would come in yet, if I'D only get him in the
mood to have another talk with Val about it; but the spiteful
little rat wouldn't come near me. I believe that was one of the
reasons Val laughed at me and pretended not to mind my getting
proposed to. He <em>must</em> have minded; he couldn't have helped
minding it, really. That's his way; he's so <em>mean</em>&mdash;he
won't show things. He knows <em>me</em>. I can't keep anything
from him; he reads <em>me</em> like a signboard; and then about
himself he keeps me guessing, and I can't tell when I've guessed
right. Ray Vilas behaved disgustingly, of course; he was horrid
and awful. I might have expected it. I suppose Richard was wailing
<em>his</em> tiresome sorrows on your poor shoulder&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No," said Laura. "He was very cheerful. He seemed glad you were
having a good time."</p>

<p>"He didn't look particularly cheerful at me. I never saw so slow
a man: I wonder when he's going to find out about that pendant.
Val would have seen it the instant I put it on. And, oh, Laura!
isn't George Wattling funny? He's just <em>soft</em>! He's good-looking
though," she continued pensively, adding, "I promised to motor
out to the Country Club with him to-morrow for tea."</p>

<p>"Oh, Cora," protested Laura, "no! Please don't!"</p>

<p>"I've promised; so I'll have to, now." Cora laughed. "It'll do
Mary Kane good. Oh, I'm not going to bother much with <em>him</em>&mdash;he
makes me tired. I never saw anything so complacent as that girl
when she came in to-night, as if her little Georgie was the greatest
capture the world had ever seen. . . ."</p>

<p>She chattered on. Laura, passive, listened with a thoughtful
expression, somewhat preoccupied. The talker yawned at last.</p>

<p>"It must be after three," she said, listlessly, having gone over
her evening so often that the colours were beginning to fade.
She yawned again. "Laura," she remarked absently, "I don't see
how you can sleep in this bed; it sags so."</p>

<p>"I've never noticed it," said her sister. "It's a very comfortable
old bed."</p>

<p>Cora went to her to be unfastened, reverting to the lieutenant
during the operation, and kissing the tire-woman warmly at its
conclusion. "You're always so sweet to me, Laura," she said affectionately.
"I don't know how you manage it. You're so good"&mdash;she laughed&mdash;"sometimes
I wonder how you stand me. If I were you, I'm positive I couldn't
stand me at all!" Another kiss and a hearty embrace, and she picked
up her wrap and skurried silently through the hall to her own
room.</p>

<p>It was very late, but Laura wrote for almost an hour in her book
(which was undisturbed) before she felt drowsy. Then she extinguished
the lamp, put the book away and got into bed.</p>

<p>It was almost as if she had attempted to lie upon the empty air:
the mattress sagged under her weight as if it had been a hammock;
and something tore with a ripping sound. There was a crash, and
a choked yell from a muffled voice somewhere, as the bed gave
way. For an instant, Laura fought wildly in an entanglement of
what she insufficiently perceived to be springs, slats and bedclothes
with something alive squirming underneath. She cleared herself
and sprang free, screaming, but even in her fright she remembered
her father and clapped her hand over her mouth that she might
keep from screaming again. She dove at the door, opened it, and
fled through the hall to Cora's room, still holding her hand over
her mouth.</p>

<p>"Cora! Oh, Cora!" she panted, and flung herself upon her sister's
bed.</p>

<p>Cora was up instantly; and had lit the gas in a trice. "There's
a burglar!" Laura contrived to gasp. "In my room! Under the bed!"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"I fell on him! Something's the matter with the bed. It broke.
I fell on him!"</p>

<p>Cora stared at her wide-eyed. "Why, it can't be. Think how long
I was in there. Your bed broke, and you just thought there was
some one there. You imagined it."</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" wailed Laura. "I <em>heard</em> him: he gave a
kind of dreadful grunt."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"<em>Sure</em>? He wriggled&mdash;oh! I could <em>feel</em> him!"</p>

<p>Cora seized a box of matches again. "I'm going to find out."
"Oh, no, no!" protested Laura, cowering.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. If there's a burglar in the house I'm going to find
him!"</p>

<p>"We mustn't wake papa."</p>

<p>"No, nor mamma either. You stay here if you want to&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Let's call Hedrick," suggested the pallid Laura; "or put our
heads out of the window and scream for&#11834;"</p>

<p>Cora laughed; she was not in the least frightened. "That wouldn't
wake papa, of course! If we had a telephone I'd send for the police;
but we haven't. I'm going to see if there's any one there. A burglar's
a man, I guess, and I can't imagine myself being afraid of any
<em>man</em>!"</p>

<p>Laura clung to her, but Cora shook her off and went through the
hall undaunted, Laura faltering behind her. Cora lighted matches
with a perfectly steady hand; she hesitated on the threshold of
Laura's room no more than a moment, then lit the lamp.</p>

<p>Laura stifled a shriek at sight of the bed. "Look, look!" she
gasped.</p>

<p>"There's no one under it now, that's certain," said Cora, and
boldly lifted a corner of it. "Why, it's been cut all to pieces
from underneath! You're right; there was some one here. It's practically
dismembered. Don't you remember my telling you how it sagged?
And I was only sitting on the edge of it! The slats have all been
moved out of place, and as for the mattress, it's just a mess
of springs and that stuffing stuff. He must have thought the silver
was hidden there."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, oh!" moaned Laura. "He <em>wriggled</em>&#11834;ugh!"</p>

<p>Cora picked up the lamp. "Well, we've got to go over the house&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, no!"</p>

<p>"Hush! I'll go alone then."</p>

<p>"You <em>can't</em>."</p>

<p>"I will, though!"</p>

<p>The two girls had changed places in this emergency. In her fright
Laura was dependent, clinging: actual contact with the intruder
had unnerved her. It took all her will to accompany her sister
upon the tour of inspection, and throughout she cowered behind
the dauntless Cora. It was the first time in their lives that
their positions had been reversed. From the days of Cora's babyhood,
Laura had formed the habit of petting and shielding the little
sister, but now that the possibility became imminent of confronting
an unknown and dangerous man, Laura was so shaken that, overcome
by fear, she let Cora go first. Cora had not boasted in vain of
her bravery; in truth, she was not afraid of any man.</p>

<p>They found the fastenings of the doors secure and likewise those
of all the windows, until they came to the kitchen. There, the
cook had left a window up, which plausibly explained the marauder's
mode of ingress. Then, at Cora's insistence, and to Laura's shivering
horror, they searched both cellar and garret, and concluded that
he had escaped by the same means. Except Laura's bed, nothing
in the house had been disturbed; but this eccentricity on the
part of a burglar, though it indeed struck the two girls as peculiar,
was not so pointedly mysterious to them as it might have been
had they possessed a somewhat greater familiarity with the habits
of criminals whose crimes are professional.</p>

<p>They finally retired, Laura sleeping with her sister, and Cora
had begun to talk of the lieutenant again, instead of the burglar,
before Laura fell asleep.</p>

<p>In spite of the short hours for sleep, both girls appeared at
the breakfast-table before the meal was over, and were naturally
pleased with the staccato of excitement evoked by their news.
Mrs. Madison and Miss Peirce were warm in admiration of their
bravery, but in the same breath condemned it as foolhardy.</p>

<p>"I never knew such wonderful girls!" exclaimed the mother, almost
tearfully. "You crazy little lions! To think of your not even
waking Hedrick! And you didn't have even a poker and were in your
bare feet&mdash;and went down in the <em>cellar</em>&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It was all Cora," protested Laura. "I'm a hopeless, disgusting
coward. I never knew what a coward I was before. Cora carried
the lamp and went ahead like a drum-major. I just trailed along
behind her, ready to shriek and run&mdash;or faint!"</p>

<p>"Could you tell anything about him when you fell on him?" inquired
Miss Peirce. "What was his voice like when he shouted?"</p>

<p>"Choked. It was a horrible, jolted kind of cry. It hardly sounded
human."</p>

<p>"Could you tell anything about whether he was a large man, or
small, or&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Only that he seemed very active. He seemed to be kicking. He
<em>wriggled</em>&#11834;ugh!"</p>

<p>They evolved a plausible theory of the burglar's motives and
line of reasoning. "You see," said Miss Peirce, much stirred,
in summing up the adventure, "he either jimmies the window, or
finds it open already, and Sarah's mistaken and she <em>did</em>
leave it open! Then he searched the downstairs first, and didn't
find anything. Then he came upstairs, and was afraid to come into
any of the rooms where we were. He could tell which rooms had
people in them by hearing us breathing through the keyholes. He
finds two rooms empty, and probably he made a thorough search
of Miss Cora's first. But he isn't after silver toilet articles
and pretty little things like that. He wants really big booty
or none, so he decides that an out-of-the-way, unimportant room
like Miss Laura's is where the family would be most apt to hide
valuables, jewellery and silver, and he knows that mattresses
have often been selected as hiding-places; so he gets under the
bed and goes to work. Then Miss Cora and Miss Laura come in so
quietly&mdash;not wanting to wake anybody&mdash;that he doesn't hear them,
and he gets caught there. That's the way it must have been."</p>

<p>"But why," Mrs. Madison inquired of this authority, "why do you
suppose he lit the lamp?"</p>

<p>"To see by," answered the ready Miss Peirce. It was accepted
as final.</p>

<p>Further discussion was temporarily interrupted by the discovery
that Hedrick had fallen asleep in his chair.</p>

<p>"Don't bother him, Cora," said his mother. "He's finished eating&mdash;let
him sleep a few minutes, if he wants to, before he goes to school.
He's not at all well. He played too hard, yesterday afternoon,
and hurt his knee, he said. He came down limping this morning
and looking very badly. He oughtn't to run and climb about the
stable so much after school. See how utterly exhausted he looks!
&mdash;Not even this excitement can keep him awake."</p>

<p>"I think we must be careful not to let Mr. Madison suspect anything
about the burglar," said Miss Peirce. "It would be bad for him."</p>

<p>Laura began: "But we ought to notify the police&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Police!" Hedrick woke so abruptly, and uttered the word with
such passionate and vehement protest, that everybody started.
"I suppose you want to <em>kill</em> your father, Laura Madison!"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he wouldn't know something had happened with
a squad of big, heavy policemen tromping all over the house? The
first thing they'd do would be to search the whole place&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Mrs. Madison quickly. "It wouldn't do at all."</p>

<p>"I should think not! I'm glad," continued Hedrick, truthfully,
"<em>that</em> idea's out of your head! I believe Laura imagined
the whole thing anyway."</p>

<p>"Have you looked at her mattress," inquired Cora, "darling little
boy?"</p>

<p>He gave her a concentrated look, and rose to leave. "Nothin'
on earth but imagina&#11834;" He stopped with a grunt as he forgetfully
put his weight on his left leg. He rubbed his knee, swallowed
painfully, and, leaving the word unfinished, limped haughtily
from the room.</p>

<p>He left the house, gloomily swinging his books from a spare length
of strap, and walking with care to ease his strains and bruises
as much as possible. He was very low in his mind, that boy. His
fortunes had reached the ebb-tide, but he had no hope of a rise.
He had no hope of anything. It was not even a consolation that,
through his talent for surprise in waylayings, it had lately been
thought necessary, by the Villard family, to have Egerton accompanied
to and from school by a man-servant. Nor was Hedrick more deeply
depressed by the certainty that both public and domestic scandal
must soon arise from the inevitable revelation of his discontinuing
his attendance at school without mentioning this important change
of career at home. He had been truant a full fortnight, under
brighter circumstances a matter for a lawless pride&mdash;now he had
neither fear nor vainglory. There was no room in him for anything
but dejection.</p>

<p>He walked two blocks in the direction of his school; turned a
corner; walked half a block; turned north in the alley which ran
parallel to Corliss Street, and a few moments later had cautiously
climbed into an old, disused refuse box which stood against the
rear wall of the empty stable at his own home. He pried up some
loose boards at the bottom of the box, and entered a tunnel which
had often and often served in happier days&mdash;when he had friends&mdash;for
the escape of Union officers from Libby Prison and Andersonville.
Emerging, wholly soiled, into a box-stall, he crossed the musty
carriage house and ascended some rickety steps to a long vacant
coachman's-room, next to the hayloft. He closed the door, bolted
it, and sank moodily upon a broken, old horsehair sofa.</p>

<p>This apartment was his studio. In addition to the sofa, it contained
an ex-bureau, three chair-like shapes, a once marble-topped table,
now covered with a sheet of zinc, two empty bird cages, and a
condemned whatnot. The walls were rather over-decorated in coloured
chalks, the man-headed-snake motive predominating; they were also
loopholed for firing into the hayloft. Upon the table lay a battered
spy-glass, minus lenses, and, nearby, two boxes, one containing
dried corn-silk, the other hayseed, convenient for the making
of amateur cigarettes; the smoker's outfit being completed by
a neat pile of rectangular clippings from newspapers. On the shelves
of the whatnot were some fragments of a dead pie, the relics of
a "Fifteen-Puzzle," a pink Easter-egg, four seashells, a tambourine
with part of a girl's face still visible in aged colours, about
two thirds of a hot-water bag, a tintype of Hedrick, and a number
of books: several by Henty, "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the
Sea," "100 Practical Jokes, Easy to Perform," "The Jungle Book,"
"My Lady Rotha," a "Family Atlas," "Three Weeks," "Pilgrim's Progress,"
"A Boy's Life in Camp," and "The Mystery of the Count's Bedroom."</p>

<p>The gloomy eye of Hedrick wandered to "The Mystery of the Count's
Bedroom," and remained fixed upon it moodily and contemptuously.
His own mystery made that one seem tame and easy: Laura's bedroom
laid it all over the Count's, in his conviction; and with a soul
too weary of pain to shudder, he reviewed the bafflements and
final catastrophe of the preceding night.</p>

<p>He had not essayed the attempt upon the mattress until assured
that the house was wrapped in slumber. Then, with hope in his
heart, he had stolen to Laura's room, lit the lamp, feeling safe
from intrusion, and set to work. His implement at first was a
long hatpin of Cora's. Lying on his back beneath the bed, and,
moving the slats as it became necessary, he sounded every cubic
inch of the mysterious mattress without encountering any obstruction
which could reasonably be supposed to be the ledger. This was
not more puzzling than it was infuriating, since by all processes
of induction, deduction, and pure logic, the thing was necessarily
there. It was nowhere else. Therefore it was there. It <em>had</em>
to be there! With the great blade of his Boy Scout's knife he
began to disembowel the mattress.</p>

<p>For a time he had worked furiously and effectively, but the position
was awkward, the search laborious, and he was obliged to rest
frequently. Besides, he had waited to a later hour than he knew,
for his mother to go to bed, and during one of his rests he incautiously
permitted his eyes to close. When he woke, his sisters were in
the room, and he thought it advisable to remain where he was,
though he little realized how he had weakened his shelter. When
Cora left the room, he heard Laura open the window, sigh, and
presently a tiny clinking and a click set him a-tingle from head
to foot: she was opening the padlocked book. The scratching sound
of a pen followed. And yet she had not come near the bed. The
mattress, then, was a living lie.</p>

<p>With infinite caution he had moved so that he could see her,
arriving at a coign of vantage just as she closed the book. She
locked it, wrapped it in an oilskin cover which lay beside it
on the table, hung the key-chain round her neck, rose, yawned,
and, to his violent chagrin, put out the light. He heard her moving
but could not tell where, except that it was not in his part of
the room. Then a faint shuffling warned him that she was approaching
the bed, and he withdrew his head to avoid being stepped upon.
The next moment the world seemed to cave in upon him.</p>

<p>Laura's flight had given him opportunity to escape to his own
room unobserved; there to examine, bathe and bind his wounds,
and to rectify his first hasty impression that he had been fatally
mangled.</p>

<p>Hedrick glared at "The Mystery of the Count's Bedroom."</p>

<p>By and by he got up, brought the book to the sofa and began to
read it over.</p>
