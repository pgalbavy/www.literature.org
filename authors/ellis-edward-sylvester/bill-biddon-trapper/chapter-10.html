<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I have now reached a point in my life over which I would fain
pass in silence. It is an experience so strange, so like some
horrid vision of sleep, so different from what usually falls to
the lot of man, that, at this remote day, I cannot look upon it
without a recoiling shudder of horror. I have sometimes persuaded
myself that it was unreal; but no, it is true, and time can never
clothe the memory of it in a different dress than that of unearthly
terror. Bleak and bare it stands alone, in my checkered lot, and
the silver that now glistens prematurely in my hair, came upon
that night.</p>

<p>I remember falling into a deep sleep, in which the last form
that passed before my eyes was that of the dark Medicine Man;
there was a confused murmur of voices, and then all became blank
and dark. Gradually the darkness was swept by the glittering folds
of a dream&mdash;a dream which had little form or theme, but the minutest
particulars of which I remember to this day. There were airy,
waving figures gliding silently about me without voice, but with
every variety of motion. They passed and repassed before my face,
frequently pausing and extending their arms over my body, and
sometimes standing and intently scanning my countenance. This
continued a long time, not a word spoken either by myself or the
forms, when suddenly the whole changed. The waving figures darted
with the rapidity of lightning among each other, and the quiet
radiance became instantly as black as night. In this, I could
distinguish the rushing forms growing fainter and fainter, until,
at last, all was blackness again.</p>

<p>Then came a feeling as though the thick darkness in one volume
were gradually crushing me beneath it, and then a strange feeling
of being cramped and held forcibly still. Then came a long, deep,
indrawn breath, and I awoke.</p>

<p>All was confused and inexplicable. Open my eyes as wide as I
might, I could not pierce the Stygian gloom. I tried to move,
but could not&mdash;could not stir a limb, and only the fingers of
my hand. The air was steamy and hot, and I was surrounded by something
which chained every part. I strove to collect my thoughts. I remembered
the consultation in the hut, the coming unconsciousness, and&mdash;my
present awakening. My first impression, after this, was that the
house had fallen over me. I clenched my hands&mdash;<em>they closed
upon earth</em>! I reached forward and licked the darkness. <em>I
tasted earth!</em>&mdash;and then came the sudden, overwhelming knowledge&mdash;</p>

<p>I <em>WAS BURIED ALIVE</em>!!</p>

<p>No pen can draw the faintest picture, no soul conceive the unutterable
horror, unless that soul has gone through the same awful experience
that filled my soul at that discovery. Such a whirlwind of fire
as seethed through my bursting brain, such a perfect blaze of
all the passions that can rack the human mind, I cannot portray
with this feeble pen. For a moment I was frantic, and then suddenly
a dreadful and frightful calmness soothed my frame.</p>

<p>Ay, I was buried alive! The savages had mistaken my trance-like
stupor for death itself, and I had been hurried prematurely into
the grave.</p>

<p>Oh, the appalling discovery! To die while in the grave! The thought
was too horrible! I was not yet ready to give way to utter despair.
I durst not pause a second for thought, for I knew it would surely
come. I twisted and struggled with the strength of fury. I could
turn my body around, and use my arms. There was an open space
before my face, as I had been buried in the sitting position.
Had I lain back I could not have survived five minutes; as it
was, my limbs were immovably secured, and it <em>was absolutely
impossible for me to free myself</em>.</p>

<p>It was a long time, for such an experience, before I admitted
this, but I was compelled to at last. Death by suffocation was
rapidly approaching, and all that was left for me was to prepare
for it. The small breath of air around me had already been breathed
over and over again, and was become hot, steamy, and sickening.
I was gasping and panting, but strove to collect my thoughts and
keep them from wandering. I commenced praying.</p>

<p>Suddenly a muffled sound reached my ear, as though something
had fallen to the earth above. I listened&mdash;it was repeated directly
over me, now rapidly and regularly. What could it mean? Was it
the sign of dissolution, or was it real? I listened, and heard
it plainer and plainer above the mild throbs of my heart. <em>It
was real!</em> Something or somebody was digging at the grave
above!</p>

<p>Could I now hold out till I was reached? The air had already
become <em>thick and palpable</em>, and strange fires were flitting
before my eyes. I held my breath till the distended blood-vessels
seemed bursting, and then as I respired, the earth turned to soft
<em>mud</em> around me; and then the long-labored inspiration
was like drawing in some loathsome reptile.</p>

<p>But <em>what</em> was above? It could not be a person, as I had
been buried by them. It must be some famished animal hastening
to devour me. Yet this would be a relief, to gain one more draught
of the sweet, cool air of heaven before death.</p>

<p>Now I heard the murmur of <em>voices</em>! I shouted&mdash;there was
a pause and stillness; then the efforts were renewed with greater
vigor. I shouted again. I could feel the jarring tremble of the
loose earth above. Some one was endeavoring to rescue me from
my awful fate, thank God!</p>

<p>A moment after, and the cool air brushed my face; a strong hand
seized my arm, and &mdash;Oh, joy inexpressible! I was on the
earth again.</p>

<p>For a moment I was bewildered and dizzy, and my pulse fluttered
wildly, for I had been very, very nigh death. I was recalled to
full consciousness by the familiar voice of Jim.</p>

<p>"Got in a tight fix, Bill. Ole Jim jus’ in time."</p>

<p>I took the savage’s hand without a word, and, sinking upon my
knees, sent up a deep, heartfelt prayer to the Merciful Being
who had thus snatched me from the most appalling death. There
was a bright moon shining, and, as I turned, I saw the dark Indian’s
eyes fixed wonderingly upon me.</p>

<p>"Jim," said I, solemnly, "may the God who has put it into your
heart, reward you for this act. I <em>never, never</em> can."</p>

<p>"Jim didn’t do it," he quickly interrupted. "<em>She</em> did!"
and, disengaging his grasp, he darted out of sight I turned and
looked behind me. There, standing motionless as a statue, her
slight form wrapped in a thick mantle, her sweet, white face appearing
like a spirit’s, stood the fair, mysterious captive.[3]</p>

<p>
[3] In the northwestern part of Oregon is a tribe of Indians<br/>
called Chenooks, who bury their sick, as soon as the Medicine<br/>
Man pronounces them beyond recovery. This horrid practice is not<br/>
confined to them alone, for other tribes in the northwest have<br/>
been known to inflict it upon their captives.

</p>
</div>
<p>For a moment, I was disposed to believe it was a spirit before
me, so still and motionless she remained. Suddenly she turned
to depart.</p>

<p>"Hold!" exclaimed I, springing forward and seizing her arm; "hold
one moment, till I thank thee."</p>

<p>"Thank the Great One above," she replied, in a low, sweet voice.
"He it is who has preserved your life."</p>

<p>As she uttered these words, she turned her dark eyes upward,
and the moonlight streaming down upon her face, threw a vail like
the halo of glory around it. Then looking me calmly in the face,
she added:</p>

<p>"You have escaped an awful death, it is true; and you are not
the only one who has thus risen from the grave. When delirious,
you spoke of home and of friends there, and I know your presence
is prayed for. The chance of reaching them is now placed within
your reach. A horse is saddled and bridled, and awaiting you,
but a short distance away. Jim will furnish you with a rifle.
You know the direction to take, and let me urge you to flee."</p>

<p>Again she turned to go, but I restrained her.</p>

<p>"You are a white person, and do you wish to live and die with
these savages?"</p>

<p>The tears glistened on her face as she replied, "I have not a
friend in the civilized world. My parents were murdered by the
Indians, and myself and sister carried away in captivity. We were
separated; I was taken eastward, and she westward beyond the Rocky
Mountains. She cannot be living, for she was a delicate child,
younger than me, and incapable of bearing one-half the suffering
that must have been imposed upon her. Should I ever see the land
I left when a child, I should be a stranger among strangers. There
are those here who love me, and I will remain behind and die among
them."</p>

<p>"Flee with me," I impetuously urged. "You will not be a stranger.
Hundreds will love you, and you can die with your own kindred.
Jim, who is faithful to you, will furnish us both with a fleet
horse, and we can elude all pursuit. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>I paused, for her agitation had become painful. She was sinking
to the earth, when I caught her, and, leading her a short distance,
seated myself beside her upon a fallen tree. Then I gently pulled
her head over on my bosom, and looked down upon her features.
Her gaudy head-dress was removed, and her white face lay among
the mass of jetty hair like a jewel set in darkness. The dark,
sweeping lashes, the faint roseate glow of each cheek, the delicate
nose and lips, as the moonlight rested on them, were indescribably
beautiful. There was, too, an utter abandonment about her,&mdash;a
tumultuous throbbing, that showed what a powerful emotion was
agitating her.</p>

<p>What was that emotion? Was it a response to my own great passion?
What else could it be? Encouraged by the certainty that the latter
was the case, I urged my suit with redoubled ardor. I pictured
the happiness that would be hers in a civilized country, and the
utter misery that must follow her life among the savages. She
informed me that she was a captive, not of the tribe near at hand,
but of one further north, which had held her ever since the massacre
of her parents; and that she had been told, in case she attempted
to leave them, instant death would be the result. I saw she wished&mdash;she
<em>longed</em> to flee, and the objections she offered were only
suggested by her fears.</p>

<p>"Hist!" she whispered, "there is some one."</p>

<p>I turned on the defensive. In an instant Jim stood beside me.</p>

<p>"How soon goin’?" he asked, anxiously, turning toward me.</p>

<p>"Shortly; why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Day clus comin’, and if you cotched, no use!" he replied, meaningly.</p>

<p>"I was not aware, Jim, that I had enemies among you."</p>

<p>"You hain’t; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rest of the sentence was gesticulated, first pointing to
me and the fair one beside me.</p>

<p>"Do you not understand?" asked the latter. "There are several
in the tribe who look upon me with envious eyes, and were they
conscious that you knew of my existence, you would not be spared
a moment. This is what Jim means, and his words must be heeded."</p>

<p>"Must I travel afoot and alone?" I asked of the Indian.</p>

<p>"There’s the hoss what tossed you over the buffler there," he
answered, pointing to a clump of trees, "and I’ve brought you
them other things," he added, handing me my knife, powder-horn,
and rifle, "and I’ll show you through the woods to the peararie."</p>

<p>"Thank you; but I shall not need you, as I know the way well
enough."</p>

<p>"How soon you goin’ to start?" he asked, turning to depart.</p>

<p>"In less than an hour I shall bid you farewell."</p>

<p>"Jim," interposed the fair captive, "bring my horse to the same
spot. I think I shall also leave for home to-night. If inquiry
is made, you can tell them this, and add that I shall probably
be with them in a few days again. As I know the wilderness well,
I will guide our friend here through it."</p>

<p>The savage looked cautiously at us both. If he was shrewd enough
to suspect the truth, he was polite enough not to show it. He
replied that her wish should be gratified, and he disappeared
as noiselessly as he came. It was now getting far in the night.
The moon rode high in the heavens, and shed a full, perfect light
down upon us.</p>

<p>"So you are going," said I, looking at her.</p>

<p>"I am going to attempt it," she answered, firmly.</p>

<p>"And through no action of mine shall you ever regret this step,"
I added, warmly.</p>

<p>"Oh! I hope he will soon return, for I <em>wish</em> to go,"
she said, as with a shiver of apprehension she looked hurriedly
about in the dark shadows of the forest.</p>

<p>"As yet, we know not each other’s names," said I, pleasantly.</p>

<p>"True," she answered, with a faint smile. "Mine is Imogene Merment."</p>

<p>"And mine is William Relmond; but where can Jim be?"</p>

<p>"Ah! there he is now," she answered, with a deep flush; and the
next minute the savage stood beside us.</p>

<p>"The animals are there; and I’m thinking you’d better be off.
Soon as you git away, I’ll cover up the hole, so thee won’t think
him has crawled out; but I’m much afeared there am some peeking
about here."</p>

<p>"We will go at once," said Imogene, gathering up her dress.</p>

<p>I turned to give a last word to Jim, but he had vanished.</p>

<p>"Let us hurry," said she, "for I have a dread that we are watched,
and will not get away after all. I pray God that nothing may prevent
us, now that we are started."</p>

<p>She almost ran, and in a minute we reached the grove referred
to. Here we found two horses saddled and bridled, and ready for
a journey. Without losing a moment, we mounted and struck to the
northward.</p>

<p>"Why this direction, Imogene?" I asked.</p>

<p>"To avoid pursuit," she answered. "At daylight we will change
it, and proceed to the south-east."</p>

<p>The open prairie was some miles distant, and as long as we were
in the deep shadows of the wood, the greatest danger was to be
apprehended. It was more than probable that the extended absence
of Jim and Imogene, at the same time, had aroused the suspicions
of more than one savage. As all must have known that I was buried
while still living, and that she had battled their determination
as long as there was hope, when the morning came and showed her
abrupt departure, they could not help suspecting the true cause.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Without losing a moment, we mounted and struck
to the northward."]</p>

<p>The air was cool and exhilarating, and, as my fiery animal pranced
beside that of Imogene, I could not restrain the wild, ardent
hopes that thrilled my being. I was homeward bound with the fairest
prize of the universe to me. What else could be needed? Ah! there
was the fate of Nat, my companion, still shrouded in obscurity.
I determined to question her at once in regard to him.</p>

<p>"Imogene, although this is hardly the proper moment, I cannot
help questioning you about the fate of a friend of mine."</p>

<p>"I know to whom you refer," she answered, quickly. "I have heard
him speak of you, but he does not know of your existence. He is
a captive like yourself, save that he seems perfectly contented
with his fate."</p>

<p>"Thank heaven! it seems indeed that a wonderful Providence is
watching over all of us."</p>

<p>"I believe he can effect his escape, but it must be through your
instrumentality, for I will not dare to show myself under the
circumstances."</p>

<p>"Good, clever Nat, I will do anything for him," I exclaimed,
warmly. "He is a whole-souled fellow, for all he is so odd. Only
to think, he has been so nigh me all this time! Of course, it
is my place to assist him, as far as lies in my power."</p>

<p>"I have had several conversations with him, in all of which he
spoke of you. He appeared to love you, and regretted greatly that
you were so reckless. He said he had long striven to teach you
how to hunt with caution, but never succeeded. He also referred
to a trapper named Bill Biddon, the one who did his best to save
our family when they fell victims to the savages, and who I would
give all the world to see. He said he succeeded, after several
years, in making quite a hunter of him."</p>

<p>"Oh! the rascal," I laughed, "just like him."</p>

<p>When day dawned we continued our journey for several hours. I
learned in the course of our conversation that Imogene Merment
wandered continually among the tribes for many miles around, and,
as I learned in after years, her existence was known to points
as far opposite as Fort Churchill and Fort Hall.[4]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
[4] The Crow Indians are a numerous tribe, subdivided into the<br/>
Blackfeet-Sioux, Dacotah, Ouk-pa-pas, Two Kettle, and Minnie,<br/>
besides several others. Each has its separate village and chief,<br/>
but all are on friendly relations with each other.

</p>
</div>
<p>At noon I shot a ptarmigan, which was cooked and upon which we
made a hearty dinner. Imogene ascended a small eminence to ascertain
whether any signs of pursuit were visible. None were discovered,
but we hurried forward until nightfall, when we drew up for the
night. We started a fire, and at my urgent request, Imogene lay
down beside it, while I kept watch. Our horses were picketed at
scarcely a rod distant, and yet in the night they became so terrified
at the approach of some animal, that they broke loose and fled,
and we never saw them again.</p>

<p>This was a great loss to us, but in the morning we continued
our journey on foot, and at noon ascended a high mountain, which
was a spur of the Black Hills, lying between the Yellowstone and
Missouri. The day was a clear, beautiful one, and the fairest
peaks of the mountains, looming up against the blue, far-off horizon,
formed a fine background to the glorious landscape spread out
before us. Never shall I forget the magnificent scene which was
opened to our vision. To the north, the mighty wilderness stretched
in one unbroken tract as far as the eye could reach, while to
the southward the glistening waters of the vast rivers could be
seen, winding and losing their tortuous channels in the forest
again. Numerous patches of prairie were visible to the west, and
small, dark specks moving over their face, showed us that animal
life was not wanting in this favored country. South of us, nestling
in a deep valley, could be seen the tiny beehive-like lodges of
the tribe we had left, seemingly covering scarcely a square rod
of ground.</p>

<p>"Yonder," said Imogene, pointing to the northward, "is the tribe
which holds your friend. The village is two days’ journey, but
the course is direct, and you cannot fail to find it. If you wish
to search for him, I will remain here until you return. I should
wish to approach no nearer, as it would increase the danger to
both of us. Your friend has hunted with the tribe in this mountain,
and should you be at a loss to find me again, ask him to guide
you to the ‘Death Rock,’ and you will reach me by the most direct
course."</p>

<p>I hesitated long before leaving Imogene, but my duty to Nat,
and the hopeful view she took of it, finally decided me. She was
confident I should find him and be back in a few days, and urged
me to delay no longer. We repaired to the "Death Rock," where
we separated. Imogene was familiar with its peculiarities, and
assured me that in its recesses she could find security from any
animal foe.[5] Before leaving her, I saw that she was provided
with food sufficient to last a week at least, and as she was furnished
with a rifle and ammunition, her situation was certainly as good
as my own.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

[5] Death Rock is composed principally of a vast cave, in which<br/>
it is said a whole tribe of Indians once perished; choosing<br/>
death by starvation rather than to fall into the hands of their<br/>
enemies.
