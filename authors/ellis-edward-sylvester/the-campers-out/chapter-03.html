<p>Mr. Wagstaff, on receiving word at the Town Hall from the janitor
who brought the message of the terrified servant to him, forgot,
in his excitement, to tell his wife of the fearful news, and rushed
out-of-doors without a word.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wagstaff knew it must be something awful that had called
him away in that style, and she lost no time in following, while
the children scrambled after them at varying distances.</p>

<p>The husband entered the door through which several of the neighbors
had timidly passed, only a few paces ahead of his wife, who was
upstairs almost as soon as he.</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear Tommy," she wailed, as she caught sight of the silent
figure fastened at the foot of the bed; "have they killed you?"</p>

<p>The sight was enough to startle any parent. The father had just
jerked the handkerchief loose and flung it to the floor, and the
lad’s head was drooping over on one shoulder, his eyes half-closed,
and his tongue protruding. The parent caught up a pitcher of water
and dashed it in his face, while the mother frantically strove
to unfasten the cruel thongs at the wrists and ankles.</p>

<p>The unexpected shock of the water startled Tommy into gasping
and opening his eyes, but his look was dazed and aimless. His
father whipped out his pocket-knife and quickly cut the thongs.
The released boy would have fallen had not both parents seized
and laid him on the bed, where he moaned as if suffering greatly.</p>

<p>"Send for the doctor at once," said the mother.</p>

<p>"And call in the police," added the father; "a dastardly outrage
has been committed; it may prove murder."</p>

<p>By this time the room was filled with horrified and sympathizing
neighbors. The solicitude of the parents for their child caused
them to pay no heed to the visitors until the father, seeing a
friend at his elbow, begged him to clear the house of intruders,
and to admit no one except the physician or an officer of the
law.</p>

<p>It took but a few minutes to comply with this request, and the
parents were left to give undivided attention to their suffering
child, who continued to moan and roll his eyes as if he were at
his last gasp.</p>

<p>The father was anxious, silent, and watchful; the mother demonstrative
and weeping. She rubbed her boy’s hands, chafed his limbs, gazing
lovingly the meanwhile in his face, and begging him to speak to
her. Maggie, the servant, had regained her senses, now that she
was sure she was alive and the precious heir had not been killed.
She took upon herself to fasten the doors and keep out intruders,
finding time to make a search up-stairs, which needed to be extended
only a few minutes to learn that an extensive robbery had been
committed.</p>

<p>"Of course," remarked Mr. Wagstaff, when the amount of his loss,
as well as that of his wife, was reported to him, "I knew what
had been done the moment I saw my poor boy."</p>

<p>"Don’t tell me," said the mother, waving the servant away, "I
don’t care if they have taken everything in the house, so long
as my darling Tommy lives."</p>

<p>Her heart was kept in a state of torture by the alarming symptoms
of her heir. At times he seemed about to revive, a look of intelligence
coming into his eyes, but, after several gasping efforts to speak,
he sank back on his pillow and gave it up as a failure.</p>

<p>By and by, in the midst of the trying scene, the physician arrived
and took charge of the patient. He was a wise old gentleman of
wide experience, and his cheerful words did much to awaken hope
in the parents, who hung on his words and watched his manner.</p>

<p>It required but a few minutes for him to make known that their
child was not seriously hurt. During his examination he gleaned
the particulars of the outrage, and succeeded in getting Tommy
into a sitting posture. Then he expressed the belief that if the
boy’s senses did not come to him very soon he would have to bore
a hole through his crown with a large auger.</p>

<p>This astounding declaration was meant for the benefit of Tommy
alone, a sly wink at the parents preventing them from taking alarm.
It was noteworthy that the boy began to pick up at once, and in
the course of a few minutes was entirely himself.</p>

<p>When the chief of police arrived the urchin was able to talk
with something of his usual facility, and imparted to his awed
listeners his account of the daring outrage and crime.</p>

<p>He said he did not feel very well after his folks left for the
concert, and he went up-stairs to lie down on his parents’ bed.
He thought it strange that the gas was lit, though it was turned
down, but he supposed it had been done by Maggie.</p>

<p>Just as he lay down he fancied he heard a man moving softly about
the room. He rose from the bed and was about to call out, when
he became sure that there were two persons near him. Before he
could give the alarm he was seized and told that if he made any
noise he would be instantly killed.</p>

<p>Still the brave boy tried to shout, when he was gagged, bound,
and tied to the bed-post, where he remained while the robbery
went on around him.</p>

<p>The doctor having pronounced Tommy out of danger, his parents
became more composed, and listened quietly to the questioning
of the chief of police, who was one of the shrewdest members of
his profession.</p>

<p>He listened gravely until the questions of the others were finished,
when he asked Tommy to describe the appearance of the criminals
so far as he could. The lad did so quite glibly. Both of the intruders
were masked, wore soft, slouch hats, long dark coats buttoned
to their chins, had gruff voices, and one of them took a dreadful-looking
revolver from his side pocket, and seemed to be on the point of
discharging several of the chambers at the captive.</p>

<p>Chief Hungerford asked the latter about the shots that had broken
the glass down-stairs, and given the servant such a fright. At
first Tommy declared he did not hear them, but upon being questioned
further, recalled that he did hear something of the kind just
after he was bound.</p>

<p>"Is this the handkerchief with which he was gagged?" asked the
officer, picking up the article from the floor.</p>

<p>"Yes, that’s it," replied the father, who had snatched it from
the head of his son the instant he reached the room.</p>

<p>The chief continued talking without looking further at the linen,
but when the attention of the couple was diverted he slipped it
into his pocket. Then he asked liberty to make an examination
of the house. Permission was cheerfully accorded, and he spent
a half-hour in going through the lower story in his own peculiar
but thorough manner.</p>

<p>At the end of that period he came back to the room where the
parents, brothers, and sisters were coddling poor Tommy, who was
muffled up in a rocking-chair, sipping lemonade, sucking oranges,
and nibbling the choicest candy. Now and then he would start convulsively
and beg them to take away those bad men, and not let them hurt
him. Then, when he was reassured by the kind words of the loving
ones around him, he complained of his throat, and found it helpful
to swallow more lemonade and take an additional suck or two at
one of the oranges pressed upon him.</p>

<p>Chief Hungerford stood in the door of the room, hat in hand,
and looked fixedly at the lad for a minute or two before speaking.
Even then it was only in answer to the question of Mr. Wagstaff.</p>

<p>"What have you found?"</p>

<p>"Nothing special, sir; there have been so many people in the
house tramping back and forth, that they have destroyed what clews
we might have discovered. Then, too, the job was so easy that
there was no need of leaving any traces."</p>

<p>"How was that?"</p>

<p>"Why the doors were unlocked, so that they had only to open and
enter without forcing a window or fastening anywhere. After they
got inside they found you were kind enough to leave keys wherever
they were needed, and consequently no violence was required up-stairs."</p>

<p>"But why did they fire those shots through the window down-stairs?"</p>

<p>"That was to frighten away the servant."</p>

<p>"It seems a strange proceeding when the reports were sure to
be heard and bring people here, while the servant herself was
certain to raise the alarm. They might have bound and scared her
into quiescence."</p>

<p>The chief of police had thought of all this before, and looked
upon it as one of the peculiar features of the business; but he
smiled, and said, in his off-hand fashion:</p>

<p>"It may strike us both as a little odd, but the best proof of
the wisdom of what the scamps did is the fact that they got off
with the plunder and have not left the first clew behind. Well,
good-evening all; I will report as soon as I pick up anything
worth telling."</p>

<p>And courteously saluting the family he descended the stairs and
passed out of the door. Before doing so he questioned the servant
on what seemed unimportant points. Finally he entered the street
and was obliged to answer the innumerable questions that were
asked him at every turn. He had found it necessary to station
a couple of his men on the premises to keep away the curious people,
who persisted in crowding forward through the grounds and even
into the house itself.</p>

<p>The rumors on the streets did not astonish him, even though they
were to the effect that Tommy (everybody called him "Tommy" since
his mishap) had been strangled to death, his last breath leaving
him just as he was caught in his mother’s arms, and that Maggie
the servant had been attacked and badly wounded, but escaped by
leaping from the second story window and running to the Town Hall,
where the family were attending a concert.</p>

<p>When the chief entered his private room he drew the handkerchief
from his pocket, spread it out on his desk under a strong gaslight
and carefully examined it.</p>

<p>He had little hope of finding anything worth knowing, but he
was too wise to neglect the least step. He carefully went over
the somewhat soiled piece of linen and smiled to himself when
he observed that a name was written in the corner in indelible
ink.</p>

<p>"Burglars aint apt to carry handkerchiefs around even with their
initials written on them, but one of these gentry has been kind
enough to give us his whole name. It is written so legibly, too,
that I can read it without my glasses. Ah, ‘<em>William Waylett</em>!’
there it is as plain as print.</p>

<p>"It strikes me," continued the chief, following the train of
thought, "that I’ve heard that name before. Jim Waylett was my
classmate in college, and he has three daughters and one boy.
The name of the youngster is William, generally called Billy.
That chap is the owner of this handkerchief as sure as a gun."</p>

<p>By this time, as the reader will perceive, the sagacious officer
was not only on the right trail, but advancing rapidly to the
correct conclusion. He had not heard all of Tommy Wagstaff’s story
before he began to grow suspicious. His experience enabled him
to detect more than one inconsistency despite the skill of the
tremendous falsifier who built up the structure.</p>

<p>Investigation and further questioning confirmed this suspicion
until, when he left the house, all doubt was gone. He knew that
no man had visited the Wagstaff home that night or taken any part
in the indignities to which Master Tommy was subjected.</p>

<p>But it was equally clear that the young rogue had had partners
in his shameless trick, and the chief meant to learn who they
were.</p>

<p>He was confident that he could find them out from Tommy himself,
whom he could handle in such a way as to force a confession, but
while the parents, especially the mother, were in such a state
of excitement, they would be indignant at the first hint of the
boy’s trickery, and would defeat what advantage he might gain
if left alone with him.</p>

<p>"They will come to it in the course of a few days," reflected
the officer, who had seen similar scenes before, "and it won’t
do any harm to wait until then. I will get a chance at the boy
before long, and, if I don’t force it out of him, then I’ll resign
my office and take to the woods."</p>

<p>The chief was desirous also of sparing the feelings of the parents
of the boy, whom he liked. They would feel much worse if compelled
to admit the truth after first refusing to listen to his suggestion.
Then, too, he had another boy to work upon. Billy Waylett must
know something of the affair. At any rate, he could tell how it
was his handkerchief came to be used to gag one of his playmates,
and <em>that</em> little piece of information was likely to give
him just the clew that was needed.</p>

<p>"I’ll wait until things get cool," concluded the chief, who happened
to have other matters pressing upon his attention just then.</p>

<p>Accordingly he gave his whole energies to the business which
took him out of Ashton for a part of two days. When he returned
it was with the resolve to take hold of the matter in earnest,
but to his dismay, when he came to make inquiry, he was told that
Tommy Wagstaff, Jimmy McGovern, and Billy Waylett had disappeared.</p>
