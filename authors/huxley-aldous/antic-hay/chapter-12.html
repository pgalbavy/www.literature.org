<p>"You? Is it you?" She seemed doubtful.</p>

<p>Gumbril nodded. "It’s me," he reassured her. "I’ve shaved; that’s
all." He had left his beard in the top right-hand drawer of the
chest of drawers, among the ties and the collars.</p>

<p>Emily looked at him judicially. "I like you better without it,"
she decided at last. "You look nicer. Oh no, I don’t mean to say
you weren’t nice before," she hastened to add. "But—you know—gentler——"
She hesitated. "It’s a silly word," she said, "but there it is:
sweeter."</p>

<p>That was the unkindest cut of all. "Milder and more melancholy?"
he suggested.</p>

<p>"Well, if you like to put it like that," Emily agreed.</p>

<p>He took her hand and raised it to his lips. "I forgive you,"
he said.</p>

<p>He could forgive her anything for the sake of those candid eyes,
anything for the grave, serious mouth, anything for the short
brown hair that curled—oh, but never seriously, never gravely—with
such a hilarious extravagance round her head. He had met her,
or rather the Complete Man, flushed with his commercial triumphs
as he returned from his victory over Mr. Boldero, had met her
at the National Gallery. "Old Masters, young mistresses;" Coleman
had recommended the National Gallery. He was walking up the Venetian
Room, feeling as full of swaggering vitality as the largest composition
of Veronese, when he heard, gigglingly whispered just behind him
his Open Sesame to new adventure, "Beaver." He spun round on his
tracks and found himself face to face with two rather startled
young women. He frowned ferociously: he demanded satisfaction
for the impertinence. They were both, he noticed, of gratifyingly
pleasing appearance and both extremely young. One of them, the
elder it seemed, and the more charming, as he had decided from
the first, of the two, was dreadfully taken aback; blushed to
the eyes, stammered apologetically. But the other, who had obviously
pronounced the word, only laughed. It was she who made easy the
forming of an acquaintance which ripened, half an hour later,
over the tea-cups and to the strains of the most classy music
on the fifth floor of Lyons’s Strand Corner House.</p>

<p>Their names were Emily and Molly. Emily, it seemed, was married.
It was Molly who let that out, and the other had been angry with
her for what was evidently an indiscretion. The bald fact that
Emily was married had at once been veiled with mysteries, surrounded
and protected by silences; whenever the Complete Man asked a question
about it, Emily did not answer and Molly only giggled. But if
Emily was married and the elder of the two, Molly was decidedly
the more knowledgeable about life; Mr. Mercaptan would certainly
have set her down as the more civilized. Emily didn’t live in
London; she didn’t seem to live anywhere in particular. At the
moment she was staying with Molly’s family at Kew.</p>

<p>He had seen them the next day, and the day after, and the day
after that; once at lunch, to desert them precipitately for his
afternoon with Rosie; once at tea in Kew Gardens; once at dinner,
with a theatre to follow and an extravagant taxi back to Kew at
midnight. The tame decoy allays the fears of the shy wild birds;
Molly, who was tame, who was frankly a flirting little wanton,
had served the Complete Man as a decoy for the ensnaring of Emily.
When Molly went away to stay with friends in the country, Emily
was already inured and accustomed to the hunter’s presence; she
accepted the playful attitude of gallantry, which the Complete
Man, at the invitation of Molly’s rolling eyes and provocative
giggle, had adopted from the first, as natural and belonging to
the established order of things. With giggling Molly to give her
a lead, she had gone in three days much further along the path
of intimacy than, by herself, she would have advanced in ten times
the number of meetings.</p>

<p>"It seems funny," she had said the first time they met after
Molly’s departure, "it seems funny to be seeing you without Molly."</p>

<p>"It seemed funnier with Molly," said the Complete Man. "It wasn’t
Molly I wanted to see."</p>

<p>"Molly’s a very nice, dear girl," she declared loyally. "Besides,
she’s amusing and can talk. And I can’t; I’m not a bit amusing."</p>

<p>It wasn’t difficult to retort to that sort of thing; but Emily
didn’t believe in compliments; oh, quite genuinely not.</p>

<p>He set out to make the exploration of her; and now that she was
inured to him, no longer too frightened to let him approach, now,
moreover, that he had abandoned the jocular insolences of the
Complete Man in favour of a more native mildness, which he felt
instinctively was more suitable in this particular case, she laid
no difficulties in his way. She was lonely, and he seemed to understand
everything so well; in the unknown country of her spirit and her
history she was soon going eagerly before him as his guide.</p>

<p>She was an orphan. Her mother she hardly remembered. Her father
had died of influenza when she was fifteen. One of his business
friends used to come and see her at school, take her out for treats
and give her chocolates. She used to call him Uncle Stanley. He
was a leather merchant, fat and jolly with a rather red face,
very white teeth and a bald head that was beautifully shiny. When
she was seventeen and a half he asked her to marry him, and she
had said yes.</p>

<p>"But why?" Gumbril asked. "Why on earth?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"He said he’d take me round the world; it was just when the war
had come to an end. Round the world, you know; and I didn’t like
school. I didn’t know anything about it and he was very nice to
me; he was very pressing. I didn’t know what marriage meant."</p>

<p>"Didn’t know?"</p>

<p>She shook her head; it was quite true. "But not in the least."</p>

<p>And she had been born within the twentieth century. It seemed
a case for the text-books of sexual psychology. "Mrs. Emily X.,
born in 1901, was found to be in a state of perfect innocence
and ignorance at the time of the Armistice, 11th November 1918,"
etc.</p>

<p>"And so you married him?"</p>

<p>She had nodded.</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>She had covered her face with her hands, she had shuddered. The
amateur uncle, now professionally a husband, had come to claim
his rights—drunk. She had fought him, she had eluded him, had
run away and locked herself into another room. On the second night
of her honeymoon he gave her a bruise on the forehead and a bite
on the left breast which had gone on septically festering for
weeks. On the fourth, more determined than ever, he seized her
so violently by the throat, that a blood-vessel broke and she
began coughing bright blood over the bedclothes. The amateur uncle
had been reduced to send for a doctor and Emily had spent the
next few weeks in a nursing home. That was four years ago; her
husband had tried to induce her to come back, but Emily had refused.
She had a little money of her own; she was able to refuse. The
amateur uncle had consoled himself with other and more docile
nieces.</p>

<p>"And has nobody tried to make love to you since then?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, lots of them have tried."</p>

<p>"And not succeeded?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I don’t like men," she said. "They’re hateful,
most of them. They’re brutes."</p>

<p>"<em>Anch’ io?</em>"</p>

<p>"What?" she asked, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Am I a brute too?" And behind his beard, suddenly, he felt rather
a brute.</p>

<p>"No," said Emily, after a little hesitation, "you’re different.
At least I think you are; though sometimes," she added candidly,
"sometimes you do and say things which make me wonder if you really
are different."</p>

<p>The Complete Man laughed.</p>

<p>"Don’t laugh like that," she said. "It’s rather stupid."</p>

<p>"You’re perfectly right," said Gumbril. "It is."</p>

<p>And how did she spend her time? He continued the exploration.</p>

<p>Well, she read a lot of books; but most of the novels she got
from Boots’ seemed to her rather silly.</p>

<p>"Too much about the same thing. Always love."</p>

<p>The Complete Man gave a shrug. "Such is life."</p>

<p>"Well, it oughtn’t to be," said Emily.</p>

<p>And then, when she was in the country—and she was often in the
country, taking lodgings here and there in little villages, weeks
and months at a time—she went for long walks. Molly couldn’t understand
why she liked the country; but she did. She was very fond of flowers.
She liked them more than people, she thought.</p>

<p>"I wish I could paint," she said. "If I could, I’d be happy for
ever, just painting flowers. But I can’t paint." She shook her
head. "I’ve tried so often. Such dirty, ugly smudges come out
on the paper; and it’s all so lovely in my head, so lovely out
in the fields."</p>

<p>Gumbril began talking with erudition about the flora of West
Surrey: where you could find butterfly orchis and green man and
the bee, the wood where there was actually wild columbine growing,
the best localities for butcher’s broom, the outcrops of clay
where you get wild daffodils. All this odd knowledge came spouting
up into his mind from some underground source of memory. Flowers—he
never thought about flowers nowadays from one year’s end to the
other. But his mother had liked flowers. Every spring and summer
they used to go down to stay at their cottage in the country.
All their walks, all their drives in the governess cart had been
hunts after flowers. And naturally the child had hunted with all
his mother’s ardour. He had kept books of pressed flowers, he
had mummified them in hot sand, he had drawn maps of the country
and coloured them elaborately with different coloured inks to
show where the different flowers grew. How long ago all that was!
Horribly long ago! Many seeds had fallen in the stony places of
his spirit, to spring luxuriantly up into stalky plants and wither
again because they had no deepness of earth; many had been sown
there and had died, since his mother scattered the seeds of the
wild flowers.</p>

<p>"And if you want sundew," he wound up, "you’ll find it in the
Punch Bowl, under Hindhead. Or round about Frensham. The Little
Pond, you know, not the Big."</p>

<p>"But you know all about them," Emily exclaimed in delight. "I’m
ashamed of my poor little knowledge. And you must really love
them as much as I do."</p>

<p>Gumbril did not deny it; they were linked henceforth by a chain
of flowers.</p>

<p>But what else did she do?</p>

<p>Oh, of course she played the piano a great deal. Very badly;
but at any rate it gave her pleasure. Beethoven: she liked Beethoven
best. More or less, she knew all the sonatas, though she could
never keep up anything like the right speed in the difficult parts.</p>

<p>Gumbril had again shown himself wonderfully at home. "Aha!" he
said. "I bet you can’t shake that low B in the last variation
but one of Op. 106 so that it doesn’t sound ridiculous."</p>

<p>And of course she couldn’t, and of course she was glad that he
knew all about it and how impossible it was.</p>

<p>In the cab, as they drove back to Kew that evening, the Complete
Man had decided it was time to do something decisive. The parting
kiss—more of a playful sonorous buss than a serious embracement—that
was already in the protocol, as signed and sealed before her departure
by giggling Molly. It was time, the Complete Man considered, that
this salute should take on a character less formal and less playful.
One, two, three and, decisively, as they passed through Hammersmith
Broadway, he risked the gesture. Emily burst into tears. He was
not prepared for that, though perhaps he should have been. It
was only by imploring, only by almost weeping himself, that Gumbril
persuaded her to revoke her decision never, never to see him again.</p>

<p>"I had thought you were different," she sobbed. "And now, now——"</p>

<p>"Please, please," he entreated. He was on the point of tearing
off his beard and confessing everything there and then. But that,
on second thoughts, would probably only make things worse.</p>

<p>"Please, I promise."</p>

<p>In the end, she had consented to see him once again, provisionally,
in Kew Gardens, on the following day. They were to meet at the
little temple that stands on the hillock above the valley of the
heathers.</p>

<p>And now, duly, they had met. The Complete Man had been left at
home in the top right-hand drawer, along with the ties and collars.
She would prefer, he guessed, the Mild and Melancholy one; he
was quite right. She had thought him ‘sweeter’ at a first glimpse.</p>

<p>"I forgive you," he said, and kissed her hand. "I forgive you."</p>

<p>Hand in hand they walked down towards the valley of the heaths.</p>

<p>"I don’t know why you should be forgiving me," she said, laughing.
"It seems to me that I ought to be doing the forgiving. After
yesterday." She shook her head at him. "You made me so wretched."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you’ve already done your forgiving."</p>

<p>"You seem to take it very much for granted," said Emily. "Don’t
be too sure."</p>

<p>"But I am sure," said Gumbril. "I can see——"</p>

<p>Emily laughed again. "I feel happy," she declared.</p>

<p>"So do I."</p>

<p>"How green the grass is!"</p>

<p>Green, green—after these long damp months it glowed in the sunlight,
as though it were lighted from inside.</p>

<p>"And the trees!"</p>

<p>The pale, high, clot-polled trees of the English spring; the
dark, symmetrical pine trees, islanded here and there on the lawns,
each with its own separate profile against the sky and its own
shadow, impenetrably dark or freckled with moving lights, on the
grass at its feet.</p>

<p>They walked on in silence. Gumbril took off his hat, breathed
the soft air that smelt of the greenness of the garden.</p>

<p>"There are quiet places also in the mind," he said meditatively.
"But we build bandstands and factories on them. Deliberately—to
put a stop to the quietness. We don’t like the quietness. All
the thoughts, all the preoccupations in my head—round and round,
continually." He made a circular motion with his hand. "And the
jazz bands, the music-hall songs, the boys shouting the news.
What’s it for? what’s it all for? To put an end to the quiet,
to break it up and disperse it, to pretend at any cost it isn’t
there. Ah, but it is; it is there, in spite of everything, at
the back of everything. Lying awake at night, sometimes—not restlessly,
but serenely, waiting for sleep—the quiet re-establishes itself,
piece by piece; all the broken bits, all the fragments of it we’ve
been so busily dispersing all day long. It re-establishes itself,
an inward quiet, like this outward quiet of grass and trees. It
fills one, it grows—a crystal quiet, a growing, expanding crystal.
It grows, it becomes more perfect; it is beautiful and terrifying,
yes, terrifying as well as beautiful. For one’s alone in the crystal
and there’s no support from outside, there’s nothing external
and important, nothing external and trivial to pull oneself up
by or to stand on, superiorly, contemptuously, so that one can
look down. There’s nothing to laugh at or feel enthusiastic about.
But the quiet grows and grows. Beautifully and unbearably. And
at last you are conscious of something approaching; it is almost
a faint sound of footsteps. Something inexpressibly lovely and
wonderful advances through the crystal, nearer, nearer. And, oh,
inexpressibly terrifying. For if it were to touch you, if it were
to seize and engulf you, you’d die; all the regular, habitual,
daily part of you would die. There would be an end of bandstands
and whizzing factories, and one would have to begin living arduously
in the quiet, arduously in some strange, unheard-of manner. Nearer,
nearer come the steps; but one can’t face the advancing thing.
One daren’t. It’s too terrifying, it’s too painful to die. Quickly,
before it is too late, start the factory wheels, bang the drum,
blow up the saxophone. Think of the women you’d like to sleep
with, the schemes for making money, the gossip about your friends,
the last outrage of the politicians. Anything for a diversion.
Break the silence, smash the crystal to pieces. There, it lies
in bits; it is easily broken, hard to build up and easy to break.
And the steps? Ah, those have taken themselves off, double quick.
Double quick, they were gone at the first flawing of the crystal.
And by this time the lovely and terrifying thing is three infinities
away, at least. And you lie tranquilly on your bed, thinking of
what you’d do if you had ten thousand pounds, and of all the fornications
you’ll never commit." He thought of Rosie’s pink underclothes.</p>

<p>"You make things very complicated," she said, after a silence.</p>

<p>Gumbril spread out his great-coat on a green bank and they sat
down. Leaning back, his hands under his head, he watched her sitting
there beside him. She had taken off her hat; there was a stir
of wind in those childish curls, and at the nape, at the temples,
where the hair had sleaved out thin and fine, the sunlight made
little misty haloes of gold. Her hands clasped round her knees,
she sat quite still, looking out across the green expanses, at
the trees, at the white clouds on the horizon. There was quiet
in her mind, he thought. She was native to that crystal world;
for her, the steps came comfortingly through the silence and the
lovely thing brought with it no terrors. It was all so easy for
her and simple.</p>

<p>Ah, so simple, so simple; like the Hire Purchase System on which
Rosie had bought her pink bed. And how simple it was, too, to
puddle clear waters and unpetal every flower!—every wild flower,
by God! one ever passed in a governess cart at the heels of a
barrel-bellied pony. How simple to spit on the floors of churches!
<em>Si prega di non sputare.</em> Simple to kick one’s legs and
enjoy oneself—dutifully—in pink underclothing. Perfectly simple.</p>

<p>"It’s like the Arietta, don’t you think?" said Emily suddenly,
"the Arietta of Op. 111." And she hummed the first bars of the
air. "Don’t you feel it’s like that?"</p>

<p>"What’s like that?"</p>

<p>"Everything," said Emily. "To-day, I mean. You and me. These
gardens——" And she went on humming.</p>

<p>Gumbril shook his head. "Too simple for me," he said.</p>

<p>Emily laughed. "Ah, but then think how impossible it gets a little
farther on." She agitated her fingers wildly, as though she were
trying to play the impossible passages. "It begins easily for
the sake of poor imbeciles like me; but it goes on, it goes on,
more and more fully and subtly and abstrusely and embracingly.
But it’s still the same movement."</p>

<p>The shadows stretched farther and farther across the lawns, and
as the sun declined the level light picked out among the grasses
innumerable stipplings of shadow; and in the paths, that had seemed
under the more perpendicular rays as level as a table, a thousand
little shadowy depressions and sun-touched mountains were now
apparent. Gumbril looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he said, "we must fly." He jumped up. "Quick, quick!"</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"We shall be late." He wouldn’t tell her for what. "Wait and
see" was all that Emily could get out of him by her questioning.
They hurried out of the gardens, and in spite of her protests
he insisted on taking a taxi into town. "I have such a lot of
unearned increment to get rid of," he explained. The Patent Small-Clothes
seemed at the moment remoter than the farthest stars. </p>
