<p><em>THE PERSIAN'S NARRATIVE CONTINUED</em></p>

<p>I have said that the room in which M. le Vicomte de Chagny and
I were imprisoned was a regular hexagon, lined entirely with mirrors. 
Plenty of these rooms have been seen since, mainly at exhibitions:
they are called "palaces of illusion," or some such name.  But
the invention belongs entirely to Erik, who built the first room
of this kind under my eyes, at the time of the rosy hours of Mazenderan. 
A decorative object, such as a column, for instance, was placed
in one of the corners and immediately produced a hall of a thousand
columns; for, thanks to the mirrors, the real room was multiplied
by six hexagonal rooms, each of which, in its turn, was multiplied
indefinitely.  But the little sultana soon tired of this infantile
illusion, whereupon Erik altered his invention into a "torture-chamber."
For the architectural motive placed in one corner, he substituted
an iron tree. This tree, with its painted leaves, was absolutely
true to life and was made of iron so as to resist all the attacks
of the "patient" who was locked into the torture-chamber.  We
shall see how the scene thus obtained was twice altered instantaneously
into two successive other scenes, by means of the automatic rotation
of the drums or rollers in the corners.  These were divided into
three sections, fitting into the angles of the mirrors and each
supporting a decorative scheme that came into sight as the roller
revolved upon its axis.</p>

<p>The walls of this strange room gave the patient nothing to lay
hold of, because, apart from the solid decorative object, they
were simply furnished with mirrors, thick enough to withstand
any onslaught of the victim, who was flung into the chamber empty-handed
and barefoot.</p>

<p>There was no furniture.  The ceiling was capable of being lit
up.  An ingenious system of electric heating, which has since
been imitated, allowed the temperature of the walls and room to
be increased at will.</p>

<p>I am giving all these details of a perfectly natural invention,
producing, with a few painted branches, the supernatural illusion
of an equatorial forest blazing under the tropical sun, so that
no one may doubt the present balance of my brain or feel entitled
to say that I am mad or lying or that I take him for a fool.[1]</p>

<p>I now return to the facts where I left them.  When the ceiling
lit up and the forest became visible around us, the viscount's
stupefaction was immense.  That impenetrable forest, with its
innumerable trunks and branches, threw him into a terrible state
of consternation.  He passed his hands over his forehead, as though
to drive away a dream; his eyes blinked; and, for a moment, he
forgot to listen.</p>

<p>I have already said that the sight of the forest did not surprise
me at all; and therefore I listened for the two of us to what
was happening next door.  Lastly, my attention was especially
attracted, not so much to the scene, as to the mirrors that produced
it.  These mirrors were broken in parts.  Yes, they were marked
and scratched; they had been "starred," in spite of their solidity;
and this proved to me that the torture-chamber in which we now
were <em>HAD ALREADY SERVED A PURPOSE</em>.</p>

<p>Yes, some wretch, whose feet were not bare like those of the
victims of the rosy hours of Mazenderan, had certainly fallen
into this "mortal illusion" and, mad with rage, had kicked against
those mirrors which, nevertheless, continued to reflect his agony. 
And the branch of the tree on which he had put an end to his own
sufferings was arranged in such a way that, before dying, he had
seen, for his last consolation, a thousand men writhing in his
company.</p>

<p>Yes, Joseph Buquet had undoubtedly been through all this!  Were
we to die as he had done?  I did not think so, for I knew that
we had a few hours before us and that I could employ them to better
purpose than Joseph Buquet was able to do.  After all, I was thoroughly
acquainted with most of Erik's "tricks;" and now or never was
the time to turn my knowledge to account.</p>

<p>To begin with, I gave up every idea of returning to the passage
that had brought us to that accursed chamber.  I did not trouble
about the possibility of working the inside stone that closed
the passage; and this for the simple reason that to do so was
out of the question.  We had dropped from too great a height into
the torture-chamber; there was no furniture to help us reach that
passage; not even the branch of the iron tree, not even each other's
shoulders were of any avail.</p>

<p>There was only one possible outlet, that opening into the Louis-Philippe
room in which Erik and Christine Daae were.  But, though this
outlet looked like an ordinary door on Christine's side, it was
absolutely invisible to us.  We must therefore try to open it
without even knowing where it was.</p>

<p>When I was quite sure that there was no hope for us from Christine
Daae's side, when I had heard the monster dragging the poor girl
from the Louis-Philippe room <em>LEST SHE SHOULD INTERFERE WITH
OUR TORTURES, I </em>resolved to set to work without delay.</p>

<p>But I had first to calm M. de Chagny, who was already walking
about like a madman, uttering incoherent cries.  The snatches
of conversation which he had caught between Christine and the
monster had contributed not a little to drive him beside himself:
add to that the shock of the magic forest and the scorching heat
which was beginning to make the prespiration{sic} stream down
his temples and you will have no difficulty in understanding his
state of mind.  He shouted Christine's name, brandished his pistol,
knocked his forehead against the glass in his endeavors to run
down the glades of the illusive forest.  In short, the torture
was beginning to work its spell upon a brain unprepared for it.</p>

<p>I did my best to induce the poor viscount to listen to reason. 
I made him touch the mirrors and the iron tree and the branches
and explained to him, by optical laws, all the luminous imagery
by which we were surrounded and of which we need not allow ourselves
to be the victims, like ordinary, ignorant people.</p>

<p>"We are in a room, a little room; that is what you must keep
saying to yourself.  And we shall leave the room as soon as we
have found the door."</p>

<p>And I promised him that, if he let me act, without disturbing
me by shouting and walking up and down, I would discover the trick
of the door in less than an hour's time.</p>

<p>Then he lay flat on the floor, as one does in a wood, and declared
that he would wait until I found the door of the forest, as there
was nothing better to do!  And he added that, from where he was,
"the view was splendid!"  The torture was working, in spite of
all that I had said.</p>

<p>Myself, forgetting the forest, I tackled a glass panel and began
to finger it in every direction, hunting for the weak point on
which to press in order to turn the door in accordance with Erik's
system of pivots.  This weak point might be a mere speck on the
glass, no larger than a pea, under which the spring lay hidden. 
I hunted and hunted.  I felt as high as my hands could reach. 
Erik was about the same height as myself and I thought that he
would not have placed the spring higher than suited his stature.</p>

<p>While groping over the successive panels with the greatest care,
I endeavored not to lose a minute, for I was feeling more and
more overcome with the heat and we were literally roasting in
that blazing forest.</p>

<p>I had been working like this for half an hour and had finished
three panels, when, as ill-luck would have it, I turned round
on hearing a muttered exclamation from the viscount.</p>

<p>"I am stifling," he said.  "All those mirrors are sending out
an infernal heat!  Do you think you will find that spring soon? 
If you are much longer about it, we shall be roasted alive!"</p>

<p>I was not sorry to hear him talk like this.  He had not said
a word of the forest and I hoped that my companion's reason would
hold out some time longer against the torture.  But he added:</p>

<p>"What consoles me is that the monster has given Christine until
eleven to-morrow evening.  If we can't get out of here and go
to her assistance, at least we shall be dead before her!  Then
Erik's mass can serve for all of us!"</p>

<p>And he gulped down a breath of hot air that nearly made him faint.</p>

<p>As I had not the same desperate reasons as M. le Vicomte for
accepting death, I returned, after giving him a word of encouragement,
to my panel, but I had made the mistake of taking a few steps
while speaking and, in the tangle of the illusive forest, I was
no longer able to find my panel for certain!  I had to begin all
over again, at random, feeling, fumbling, groping.</p>

<p>Now the fever laid hold of me in my turn ... for I found nothing,
absolutely nothing.  In the next room, all was silence.  We were
quite lost in the forest, without an outlet, a compass, a guide
or anything. Oh, I knew what awaited us if nobody came to our
aid ...  or if I did not find the spring!  But, look as I might,
I found nothing but branches, beautiful branches that stood straight
up before me, or spread gracefully over my head.  But they gave
no shade.  And this was natural enough, as we were in an equatorial
forest, with the sun right above our heads, an African forest.</p>

<p>M. de Chagny and I had repeatedly taken off our coats and put
them on again, finding at one time that they made us feel still
hotter and at another that they protected us against the heat. 
I was still making a moral resistance, but M. de Chagny seemed
to me quite "gone." He pretended that he had been walking in that
forest for three days and nights, without stopping, looking for
Christine Daae!  From time to time, he thought he saw her behind
the trunk of a tree, or gliding between the branches; and he called
to her with words of supplication that brought the tears to my
eyes.  And then, at last:</p>

<p>"Oh, how thirsty I am!" he cried, in delirious accents.</p>

<p>I too was thirsty.  My throat was on fire.  And, yet, squatting
on the floor, I went on hunting, hunting, hunting for the spring
of the invisible door ... especially as it was dangerous to remain
in the forest as evening drew nigh.  Already the shades of night
were beginning to surround us.  It had happened very quickly:
night falls quickly in tropical countries ... suddenly, with hardly
any twilight.</p>

<p>Now night, in the forests of the equator, is always dangerous,
particularly when, like ourselves, one has not the materials for
a fire to keep off the beasts of prey.  I did indeed try for a
moment to break off the branches, which I would have lit with
my dark lantern, but I knocked myself also against the mirrors
and remembered, in time, that we had only images of branches to
do with.</p>

<p>The heat did not go with the daylight; on the contrary, it was
now still hotter under the blue rays of the moon.  I urged the
viscount to hold our weapons ready to fire and not to stray from
camp, while I went on looking for my spring.</p>

<p>Suddenly, we heard a lion roaring a few yards away.</p>

<p>"Oh," whispered the viscount, "he is quite close! ... Don't you
see him? ... There ... through the trees ... in that thicket! 
If he roars again, I will fire! ..."</p>

<p>And the roaring began again, louder than before.  And the viscount
fired, but I do not think that he hit the lion; only, he smashed
a mirror, as I perceived the next morning, at daybreak.  We must
have covered a good distance during the night, for we suddenly
found ourselves on the edge of the desert, an immense desert of
sand, stones and rocks.  It was really not worth while leaving
the forest to come upon the desert.  Tired out, I flung myself
down beside the viscount, for I had had enough of looking for
springs which I could not find.</p>

<p>I was quite surprised&mdash;and I said so to the viscount&mdash;that we
had encountered no other dangerous animals during the night. 
Usually, after the lion came the leopard and sometimes the buzz
of the tsetse fly.  These were easily obtained effects; and I
explained to M. de Chagny that Erik imitated the roar of a lion
on a long tabour or timbrel, with an ass's skin at one end.  Over
this skin he tied a string of catgut, which was fastened at the
middle to another similar string passing through the whole length
of the tabour.  Erik had only to rub this string with a glove
smeared with resin and, according to the manner in which he rubbed
it, he imitated to perfection the voice of the lion or the leopard,
or even the buzzing of the tsetse fly.</p>

<p>The idea that Erik was probably in the room beside us, working
his trick, made me suddenly resolve to enter into a parley with
him, for we must obviously give up all thought of taking him by
surprise.  And by this time he must be quite aware who were the
occupants of his torture-chamber. I called him:  "Erik!  Erik!"</p>

<p>I shouted as loudly as I could across the desert, but there was
no answer to my voice.  All around us lay the silence and the
bare immensity of that stony desert.  What was to become of us
in the midst of that awful solitude?</p>

<p>We were beginning literally to die of heat, hunger and thirst
...  of thirst especially.  At last, I saw M. de Chagny raise
himself on his elbow and point to a spot on the horizon.  He had
discovered an oasis!</p>

<p>Yes, far in the distance was an oasis ... an oasis with limpid
water, which reflected the iron trees! ... Tush, it was the scene
of the mirage ...  I recognized it at once ... the worst of the
three! ... No one had been able to fight against it ... no one... 
I did my utmost to keep my head <em>AND NOT TO HOPE FOR WATER,
</em>because I knew that, if a man hoped for water, the water
that reflected the iron tree, and if, after hoping for water,
he struck against the mirror, then there was only one thing for
him to do: to hang himself on the iron tree!</p>

<p>So I cried to M. de Chagny:</p>

<p>"It's the mirage! ... It's the mirage! ... Don't believe in the
water! ... It's another trick of the mirrors! ..."</p>

<p>Then he flatly told me to shut up, with my tricks of the mirrors,
my springs, my revolving doors and my palaces of illusions!  He
angrily declared that I must be either blind or mad to imagine
that all that water flowing over there, among those splendid,
numberless trees, was not real water! ... And the desert was real! 
... And so was the forest! ... And it was no use trying to take
him in ... he was an old, experienced traveler ... he had been
all over the place!</p>

<p>And he dragged himself along, saying:  "Water!  Water!"</p>

<p>And his mouth was open, as though he were drinking.</p>

<p>And my mouth was open too, as though I were drinking.</p>

<p>For we not only saw the water, but WE <em>HEARD IT! ... </em>We
heard it flow, we heard it ripple! ... Do you understand that
word "ripple?" ... IT IS A <em>SOUND WHICH YOU HEAR WITH YOUR
TONGUE!  ... </em>You put your tongue out of your mouth to listen
to it better!</p>

<p>Lastly&mdash;and this was the most pitiless torture of all&mdash;we heard
the rain and it was not raining!  This was an infernal invention... 
Oh, I knew well enough how Erik obtained it!  He filled with little
stones a very long and narrow box, broken up inside with wooden
and metal projections.  The stones, in falling, struck against
these projections and rebounded from one to another; and the result
was a series of pattering sounds that exactly imitated a rainstorm.</p>

<p>Ah, you should have seen us putting out our tongues and dragging
ourselves toward the rippling river-bank! Our eyes and ears were
full of water, but our tongues were hard and dry as horn!</p>

<p>When we reached the mirror, M. de Chagny licked it ... and I
also licked the glass.</p>

<p>It was burning hot!</p>

<p>Then we rolled on the floor with a hoarse cry of despair.  M.
de Chagny put the one pistol that was still loaded to his temple;
and I stared at the Punjab lasso at the foot of the iron tree. 
I knew why the iron tree had returned, in this third change of
scene! ...  The iron tree was waiting for me! ...</p>

<p>But, as I stared at the Punjab lasso, I saw a thing that made
me start so violently that M. de Chagny delayed his attempt at
suicide.  I took his arm.  And then I caught the pistol from him
... and then I dragged myself on my knees toward what I had seen.</p>

<p>I had discovered, near the Punjab lasso, in a groove in the floor,
a black-headed nail of which I knew the use.  At last I had discovered
the spring!  I felt the nail ...  I lifted a radiant face to M.
de Chagny ...  The black-headed nail yielded to my pressure ...</p>

<p>And then ...</p>

<p>And then we saw not a door opened in the wall, but a cellar-flap
released in the floor.  Cool air came up to us from the black
hole below.  We stooped over that square of darkness as though
over a limpid well.  With our chins in the cool shade, we drank
it in.  And we bent lower and lower over the trap-door. What could
there be in that cellar which opened before us?  Water?  Water
to drink?</p>

<p>I thrust my arm into the darkness and came upon a stone and another
stone ... a staircase ... a dark staircase leading into the cellar.
The viscount wanted to fling himself down the hole; but I, fearing
a new trick of the monster's, stopped him, turned on my dark lantern
and went down first.</p>

<p>The staircase was a winding one and led down into pitchy darkness. 
But oh, how deliciously cool were the darkness and the stairs? 
The lake could not be far away.</p>

<p>We soon reached the bottom.  Our eyes were beginning to accustom
themselves to the dark, to distinguish shapes around us ...  circular
shapes ... on which I turned the light of my lantern.</p>

<p>Barrels!</p>

<p>We were in Erik's cellar:  it was here that he must keep his
wine and perhaps his drinking-water. I knew that Erik was a great
lover of good wine.  Ah, there was plenty to drink here!</p>

<p>M. de Chagny patted the round shapes and kept on saying:</p>

<p>"Barrels!  Barrels!  What a lot of barrels! ..."</p>

<p>Indeed, there was quite a number of them, symmetrically arranged
in two rows, one on either side of us.  They were small barrels
and I thought that Erik must have selected them of that size to
facilitate their carriage to the house on the lake.</p>

<p>We examined them successively, to see if one of them had not
a funnel, showing that it had been tapped at some time or another. 
But all the barrels were hermetically closed.</p>

<p>Then, after half lifting one to make sure it was full, we went
on our knees and, with the blade of a small knife which I carried,
I prepared to stave in the bung-hole.</p>

<p>At that moment, I seemed to hear, coming from very far, a sort
of monotonous chant which I knew well, from often hearing it in
the streets of Paris:</p>

<p>"Barrels! ... Barrels! ... Any barrels to sell?"</p>

<p>My hand desisted from its work.  M. de Chagny had also heard. 
He said:</p>

<p>"That's funny!  It sounds as if the barrel were singing!"</p>

<p>The song was renewed, farther away:</p>

<p>"Barrels! ... Barrels! ... Any barrels to sell? ..."</p>

<p>"Oh, I swear," said the viscount, "that the tune dies away in
the barrel! ..."</p>

<p>We stood up and went to look behind the barrel.</p>

<p>"It's inside," said M. de Chagny, "it's inside!"</p>

<p>But we heard nothing there and were driven to accuse the bad
condition of our senses.  And we returned to the bung-hole. M.
de Chagny put his two hands together underneath it and, with a
last effort, I burst the bung.</p>

<p>"What's this?" cried the viscount.  "This isn't water!"</p>

<p>The viscount put his two full hands close to my lantern ... 
I stooped to look ... and at once threw away the lantern with
such violence that it broke and went out, leaving us in utter
darkness.</p>

<p>What I had seen in M. de Chagny's hands ... was gun-powder!</p>

<p>[1] It is very natural that, at the time when the Persian was
writing, he should take so many precautions against any spirit
of incredulity on the part of those who were likely to read his
narrative.  Nowadays, when we have all seen this sort of room,
his precautions would be superfluous.</p>
