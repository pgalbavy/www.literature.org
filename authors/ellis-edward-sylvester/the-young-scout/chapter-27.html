<p>It must not be supposed, from what has been related about Mendez,
the White Mountain scout, that he was superior to the weaknesses
peculiar to his race. That he was brave, loyal to the whites,
cunning, full of resources and a consummate master of woodcraft,
was conceded by his bitterest enemies; but while he possessed
these admirable traits, it must be stated that he shared the unfortunate
fondness of his people for intoxicants. At times he indulged in
this love for the frightful decoction, "tiswin," which, as has
been made known elsewhere, is the product of fermented corn, and
is one of the most villainous forms of "fire-water" conceivable.</p>

<p>Had Mendez related the particulars of the outbreak of Maroz and
Ceballos, he would have stated that he, Cemuri and they were indulging
their weakness and that, humiliating as the confession must have
been, he fell more under its influence than any one of them. In
fact, he was so far gone that his recollection of the affray was
always exceedingly misty. He recalled that, like the explosion
of a bombshell, the party suddenly became engaged in a fierce
conflict, in which he was the principal offender, and in some
way he was slightly wounded and then left alone. The facts that
afterward came to light were of an interesting character.</p>

<p>It is a physiological fact that intoxicants remove the sense
of moral restraint in a person, or, as it has been expressed,
a man, when under their influence, will do that which he would
do when sober if he dared; in other words, while in that condition
he acts out his natural self.</p>

<p>This was the case with Maroz and Ceballos, who, though less helpless
than Mendez, became so reckless that they threw off the mask they
had been wearing so long, and showed themselves the ferocious
miscreants they had always been. They cast aside all restraint,
and, being more sober than Mendez, would have slain him but for
the interference of Cemuri, who had more self-command than even
they. He was able to refrain when he had barely tasted the fiery
stuff, and with a subtlety like that of Mendez, when he was his
own master, he convinced Maroz and his companion that he was with
them in sentiment and would eagerly join in the outbreak.</p>

<p>He professed to have a grievance against the colonel at the fort,
and was only awaiting the chance to repay it. He would have preferred
to wait still longer, but since the couple were determined upon
taking the warpath without delay, he was ready to risk everything.</p>

<p>That he succeeded in convincing the two of his earnestness was
proof that he was as sagacious in some respects as his comrade
for many years. He would not permit the latter, however, to receive
any serious injury, and thus it was that the courageous fellow,
who was literally helpless, was allowed to wander off in the darkness,
with little more than a scratch, received from Maroz himself,
who had meant to destroy him without mercy. Cemuri joined the
rebels, displaying an ardor that surpassed, if possible, their
own, and so well counterfeited that they were wholly deceived.</p>

<p>Mendez spent the night in sodden slumber, but became himself
on the morrow. Brushing the cobwebs from his brain, and recalling
the grotesque incidents of the night before, he found himself
mystified to understand how it was he was alive and substantially
unharmed.</p>

<p>It was a part of Cemuri’s far-reaching scheme to make it seem
he was dead. By this means his opportunities for befriending the
whites were increased. When, therefore, Mendez heard from others
that his former companion had been slain and his body flung into
the bush he doubted the truth of the statement no more than he
doubted that Maroz and Ceballos were leading the formidable revolt.
He leaped upon his pony and dashed to Fort Reno in all haste with
the tidings. He was considerably mixed as to details, but his
story was accepted with little questioning; and the measures were
set on foot that have been made clear elsewhere.</p>

<p>Although Maroz and Ceballos had burned their bridges behind them,
they were not sufficiently recovered from the effects of their
debauch to undertake offensive movements before the morrow.</p>

<p>Enough has been told to give an idea of the emotions of the scout,
when he recognized Cemuri in the camp of the hostiles, and saw
him in friendly converse with them. Even his stolid nature was
too startled to permit him to form a satisfactory explanation,
until he had listened awhile to their conversation, and had managed
to recall a little more clearly the events of the preceding evening.
But it was not long ere he grasped the whole plot of his friend,
whose peculiar mental qualities were better known to him than
to any one else.</p>

<p>The first natural question was as to why Cemuri, if aiming to
give the whites his individual aid, had deferred action until
this late hour. There must have been many opportunities for striking
an effective blow before this. It may have been, however, that
he contemplated a grand <em>coup d’etat</em> when matters should
approach a crisis.</p>

<p>These and similar thoughts passed through the brain of Mendez,
while standing too far back in the gloom to be detected, watching
the party and listening to their conversation.</p>

<p>The words were disappointing to Mendez, for they gave him no
knowledge not possessed before. They referred to the expected
pursuit by the soldiers and the plan for ambuscading them, whenever
they should penetrate far enough into the mountains to render
the success of the Apaches beyond question. He heard nothing about
the stolen child, and was, therefore, in as much ignorance of
his fate or whereabouts as before.</p>

<p>The one indispensable step remained for Mendez to establish communication
with his friend; that accomplished, and the prospects would become
the brightest. But as matters stood, the task was beyond the skill
of the wonderful scout. The most guarded signal that he could
make was certain to be heard by the hostiles, at the same instant
it reached Cemuri; and, instead of proving a help, must overthrow
everything.</p>

<p>His only possible hope was that the party would break up by and
by and leave Cemuri to himself. If that should take place, the
object could be readily attained. The belief that something of
the kind would occur held Mendez like a statue, during nearly
all the long period he was absent from Lieutenant Decker and Mr.
Freeman. He showed the patience of the Esquimau waiting by the
air hole, in the ice for the appearance of the nose of the seal.</p>

<p>The experience of the scout was another illustration of the truth
that everything comes to him who waits. After awhile Maroz stole
away in the gloom, leaving the couple alone. By and by he returned
and Ceballos took a hand. They reported that the soldiers were
not yet near, and were likely to push their pursuit until the
night was further along. All this time not the first reference,
so far as Mendez could learn, was made to the little captive.</p>

<p>Then, when the scout was looking for Cemuri to start off on his
reconnaissance, a fourth Apache suddenly appeared in camp. He
was from the main body, further back in the mountains, and he
remained a half hour, discussing business with the others, and
making sure that no possible miscarriage could occur in the plan
laid for the overthrow of their pursuers.</p>

<p>But the messenger finally left, and then Cemuri set out to look
after matters, disappearing in the wood in the shadowy manner
that his predecessors had done.</p>

<p>The opportunity had come at last, and it need not be told how
Mendez improved it. He and his former friend met within a hundred
yards of the camp, and that which has been told at the beginning
of this chapter was made clear to the scout, confirming the suspicions
he had formed while playing the part of eavesdropper.</p>

<p>All the information the latter sought was speedily given to him,
and, parting from his companion for a time, he made his way to
his other friends and told them the amazing story.</p>

<p>Maurice Freeman was so overcome that he was forced to sit down
until he could regain mastery of himself. Even Lieutenant Decker
lost his facetiousness for the time, and stood with open mouth
and staring eyes, unable at first to ask the questions that rapidly
took form in his brain.</p>

<p>Mendez was a little foggy, as before, in describing the occurrences
of the preceding night, but the officer suspected the truth, which,
if fully told, would have humiliated the brave fellow. He forbore
to question him on the point, for it was of little importance.</p>

<p>Cemuri was not present at this interview, but was only a short
way off, awaiting the return of his companion. Telling his friends
that the two would soon be with them, Mendez withdrew, and they
were again left to themselves.</p>

<p>"It is the most wonderful thing I ever knew," remarked Mr. Freeman,
in an awed tone; "in all my calculations and surmises, I never
deemed this among the possibilities."</p>

<p>"It would have been still more remarkable had you done so," replied
the lieutenant; "it begins to look as if you will recover your
little boy."</p>

<p>"I hardly dare believe it," said the parent, with a shiver of
anxious hope, "and yet why not?"</p>

<p>"I think I understand the <em>motif</em> of those fellows in
taking the extraordinary course they did. Maroz and Ceballos,
I needn’t tell you, are among the worst Apaches that ever lived,
and that is a tremendous statement. They saw that if they allowed
the child to pass into the hands of the principal band, they must
surrender control of him. In the complications likely to follow,
it is not impossible that the others would agree to give him up,
in order to save their own necks. That would be wise, but at the
same time it would rob Maroz and Ceballos of their pet scheme
of enjoyment."</p>

<p>"It seems incredible that even an Apache should be so cruel."</p>

<p>"There is nothing which human ingenuity can conceive that is
too cruel for an Apache to do. This being so, they did not handicap
themselves by keeping your child near them. They were liable to
lose him, in the event of a sudden attack, before they could remove
him, after the fashion that has been popular among the aborigines,
ever since the Miss MacCrea episode, more than a hundred years
ago."</p>

<p>"How readily they might have ended the difficulty by putting
him out of the way at once!" exclaimed the parent with a shudder.</p>

<p>"But for their cruelty of disposition, they would have done that.
Such a course, however, must have robbed them of the exquisite
happiness they are now feasting upon in imagination. So they carried
the sleeping fellow, as tenderly as you could have done, to the
place among the rocks, within a hundred feet of their camp. There
they secured him against molestation from any prowling wild beast,
believing he would sleep until morning, though it mattered little
whether he did or not, since there is no way by which he could
help himself."</p>

<p>"If I only knew the place," added the parent, half rising to
his feet in his excitement, "I would go thither at once."</p>

<p>"That is the reason Mendez gave us no hint of its location. I’m
afraid, Freeman, he doesn’t rank you as being among the champion
scouts of the country."</p>

<p>"I never laid claim to that honor," replied the man, with an
earnestness that he would not have shown under other circumstances,
"but it is so hard to wait—wait, when there’s no saying what obstacles
may arise."</p>

<p>"You must content your soul with patience as best you can, for
Mendez is running this administration, and no one can do it better."</p>

<p>The suspense was briefer than the lieutenant anticipated, though
it seemed ten times its real length to the distressed parent.
A gentle rustling, evidently made intentionally, caused both to
turn their head.</p>

<p>There stood Mendez and Cemuri, and the former held in his dusky
palm the dimpled hand of a little boy.</p>

<p>"Oh papa, is that you? Why did you leave me so long?"</p>

<p>"God be thanked!" was the fervent ejaculation of the delighted
father, as he seized his child in his arms, pressed him to his
breast and kissed him over and over again.</p>

<p>Fulton was sleeping soundly when released from his prison among
the rocks, and Mendez started to carry him, but the disturbance
awoke the child, and, seeing that he was feverish and frightened,
his rescuer allowed him to walk at his side as he wished, while
he led him to his father.</p>

<p>When a few minutes later the party was about to start northward,
in the direction of the river, with the intention of picking up
their ponies on the way, and seeing Maurice Freeman safe home
again with his loved boy, Lieutenant Decker remarked:</p>

<p>"It seems to me we’re forgetting that we are not yet out of the
woods; are we not in danger, Mendez, of being followed by Maroz
and Ceballos?"</p>

<p>"<em>No!</em>"</p>

<p>While the little party were silently threading their way northward
to the desolate home which, in due time, was illuminated with
perfect joy by the return of the child that had been mourned as
dead, Captain Shindle and his cavalry were pressing matters from
a different direction. The severe ride deferred their assault
on the Apache stronghold until later than was desired, but the
diversion, described elsewhere, produced the best effects. Under
the guidance of the other White Mountain scouts, the hostiles
were so effectually entrapped that their overthrow was complete.</p>

<p>In the conflict that followed, half of them were destroyed by
the cavalry, who knew it was mercy to the innocent that such heroic
measures should be adopted. Those who were not exterminated were
captured and taken back as prisoners to the fort.</p>

<p>The disastrous results of the outbreak speedily became known
to all the hostiles on the reservation, Maroz and Ceballos, the
leaders, being among the first victims to the vengeance they had
invoked. The lesson was of the most salutary nature. Others were
on the point of joining the hostiles, and, had a temporary advantage
come to the band in the mountains, one of the most formidable
outbreaks known in the history of the southwestern frontier would
have followed, carrying in its train unutterable woe and suffering.</p>

<p>But the prompt measures of the cavalry, and especially the actions
of Mendez and Cemuri, nipped it in the bud.</p>

<p><em>THE END</em>.</p>
