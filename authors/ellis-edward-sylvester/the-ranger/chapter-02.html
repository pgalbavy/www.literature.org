<p>Few words were interchanged during the evening. George and Rosalind
had enough to occupy their minds, and Zeb, finding them taciturn,
relapsed into a sullen silence.</p>

<p>At an early hour each retired. Rosalind now felt more than George
that unaccountable presentiment which sometimes comes over one
in cases of danger. During the last few hours it had increased
until it nearly resolved itself into a certainty.</p>

<p>The view from the front of the house was clear and unobstructed
to the river, a quarter of a mile distant. Along this lay the
cultivated clearing, while the forest, stretching miles away,
approached to within a few yards of the rear of the house.</p>

<p>Rosalind's room overlooked this wilderness. Instead of retiring,
she seated herself by the window to gaze out upon it. There was
a faint moon, and the tree-tops for a considerable distance could
be seen swaying in the gentle night-wind. The silence was so profound
that it seemed to make itself <em>felt</em> and, in that vast
solitude, few indeed could remain without being impressed with
the solemn grandeur of nature around.</p>

<p>Hour after hour wore away; still Rosalind remained at the window.
As there was no inclination to sleep, she determined to remain
in her position until morning. She knew that it must be far beyond
midnight, and at the thought there sprung up a faint hope within
her breast. But she was startled by the dismal hoot of an owl.
She sprang up, with a beating heart, listening intently and painfully;
but no other sound was heard. Trying to smile at her trepidation,
she again seated herself and listened; in a moment that cry was
repeated, now in an opposite direction from which the first note
was heard.</p>

<p>Rosalind wondered that the simple circumstance should so affect
her; but try as much as she might, she could not shake it off.
Again, for a few minutes, she remained trembling with an undefinable
fear, when there came another hoot, followed instantly by another,
in an opposite direction. She began now to entertain a fearful
suspicion.</p>

<p>Her first impulse was to awaken her brother, but, after a moment's
thought, she concluded to wait a short time. A few more sounds
were heard, when they entirely ceased. During this time, Rosalind,
although suffering an intense fear, had been gazing vacantly toward
the point or clearing nearest the house. As her eyes rested upon
the spot, she caught the shadowy outlines of a dark body moving
stealthily and noiselessly along upon the ground.</p>

<p>Without waiting a moment, she darted to George's room. He had
not slept, and in an instant was by her side.</p>

<p>"Call Zeb," she exclaimed. "We are surrounded by Indians."</p>

<p>Leland disappeared, and in a moment came back with the negro.</p>

<p>"Gorra mighty!" said the latter, in a hurried, husky whisper,
"where am de cussed niggers? Heigh, Miss Rosa?"</p>

<p>"Keep quiet," she replied, "or you will be heard."</p>

<p>"Dat's just what I wants to be, and I calkilates I'll be <em>felt</em>
too, if dar are any of 'em 'bout."</p>

<p>"Stay here a moment," said George, "while I look out. Rosalind,
what did you see?"</p>

<p>"A body approaching the house from the woods. Be careful and
do not expose yourself, George."</p>

<p>He made no answer and entered her room, followed by herself and
the negro, who remained at a safe distance, while he cautiously
approached the window. He had no more than reached it, when Zeb
asked:</p>

<p>"See noffin'?"</p>

<p>This question was repeated perhaps a dozen times without an answer,
when the patience of Zeb becoming exhausted, he shuffled to the
window and pressed his head forward, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Gorra mighty, whar am dey?"</p>

<p>"Hist! there is one now&mdash;yes, two of them!"</p>

<p>"Whar&mdash;whar?"</p>

<p>"Keep your mouth shut," interrupted the young man, his vexation
causing him to speak louder than he intended.</p>

<p>"Heigh! dat's him! Look out!"</p>

<p>And before young Leland suspected his intentions or could prevent
it, Zeb had taken aim and fired. This was so sudden and unexpected
that, for a moment, nothing was heard but the dull echo, rolling
off over the forest and up the river. Then arose a piercing, agonized
yell, that told how effectual was the shot of the negro. Rosalind's
face blanched with terror as she heard the fearful chorus of enraged
voices, and thought of the fearful scene that must follow.</p>

<p>"Are the doors secured?" she asked, laying her hand upon George's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yes, I barricaded them all," he answered. "If they do not fire
the building, we may be able to keep them off until morning. I
don't know but what Zeb's shot was the best, after all &mdash;God
save us!"</p>

<p>This last exclamation was caused by a bullet whizzing past, within
an inch of his face. For a while Leland was uncertain of the proper
course to pursue. Should he expose his person at the window, he
was almost certain to be struck; yet this or some other one equally
exposed, was the only place where he could exchange shots, and
the savages must be kept in check.</p>

<p>Zeb had reloaded his gun, and peering around the edge of the
window, caught a glimpse of an Indian. As reckless of danger as
usual, he raised his rifle and discharged it. He was a good marksman,
and the shot was as effective as the other.</p>

<p>"Gorra mighty!" he exclaimed, "I can dodge dar lead. Didn't I
pick dat darkey off awful nice? Just wait till I load ag'n." Chuckling
over his achievements, he proceeded to prime his rifle. George
Leland withdrew to the window of another room, from which he succeeded
in slaying a savage, and by being careful and cautious, he was
able to make his few shots tell with effect.</p>

<p>When Zeb shot the first savage, the red-skins sprung to their
feet and commenced yelling and leaping, feeling that those within
were already at their mercy; but the succeeding shots convinced
them of their mistake, and retreating to cover, they were more
careful in exposing themselves. Several stole around to the front
of the house, but George had anticipated them, and there being
no means of concealing their appearance, they were easily kept
at a distance. Rosalind followed and assisted him as far as lay
in her power, while Zeb was left alone in his delight and glory.</p>

<p>"Be careful," said Leland; "don't come too near. Just have the
powder and wadding ready and hand it to me when I need it."</p>

<p>"I will," she replied, in a calm, unexcited voice, as she reached
him his rod.</p>

<p>"Just see what Zeb is at, while I watch my chance."</p>

<p>She disappeared, and in a moment returned.</p>

<p>"He seems frantic with delight, and is yet unharmed."</p>

<p>"God preserve him," said George, "for his assistance is needed."</p>

<p>"Be careful," said Rosalind, as George approached the window.</p>

<p>"I shall&mdash;whew! that's a close rub!" he muttered, as a bullet
pierced his cap. "There, <em>you're</em> past harm," he added,
as he discharged his gun.</p>

<p>Thus the contest was kept up for over an hour. But few shots
were interchanged on either side, each party becoming more careful
in their action. Young Leland remained at his window, and kept
a close watch upon his field; but no human being was seen. Zeb
laughed, ducked his head, and made numerous threats toward his
enemies, but seemed to attract no notice from them.</p>

<p>Now and then Rosalind spoke a word to her brother, but the suspense
which the silence of their enemies had put them in, sealed their
lips, and, for a long while, the silence was unbroken by either.
They were startled at length by the report of Zeb's rifle, and
the next minute he appeared among them, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Gorra mighty! I shot out my ramrod. I seen a good chance, and
blazed away 'fore I thought to take it out. It went through six
of 'em, and stuck into a tree and hung 'em fast. Heigh! it's fun
to see 'em."</p>

<p>"Here, take mine, and for God's sake, cease your jesting!" said
Leland, handing his rod to him.</p>

<p>"Wish I could string some more up," added Zeb, as he rammed home
his charge. "Yer oughter seen it, Miss Rosa. It went right frough
de fust feller's eye, and den frough de oder one's foot, den frough
de oder's gizzard, and half way frough de tree. Gorra, how dey
wriggled! Looked just like a lot of mackerel hung up to dry. Heigh!"</p>

<p>At this point Leland discharged his gun, and said, without changing
his position:</p>

<p>"They are trying to approach the house. Go, Zeb, and attend to
your side. Be very sharp!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I's dar, stringing 'em up," he rejoined, as he turned away.</p>

<p>"Hark!" exclaimed Rosalind, when he had gone. "What noise is
that?"</p>

<p>Leland listened awhile, and his heart died within him as he answered:</p>

<p>"Merciful Heaven! the house is on fire! All hope is now gone!"</p>

<p>"Shall we give ourselves up?" hurriedly asked Rosalind.</p>

<p>"No; come with me."</p>

<p>"Hurry up, massa, dey's gwine to roast us. De grease begins to
siss in my face a'ready," said Zeb, as he joined them.</p>

<p>The fugitives retreated to the lower story, and Leland led the
way to a door which opened upon the kitchen, at the end of the
house. His hope was that from this they might have a chance of
escaping to the wood, but a short distance off, ere they were
discovered.</p>

<p>Cautiously opening the door, he saw with anxious, hopeful joy,
that no Indians were visible.</p>

<p>"Now, Rosalind," he whispered, "be quick. Make for the nearest
trees, and if you succeed in reaching them, pass to the river-bank
and wait for me. Move softly and rapidly."</p>

<p>Rosalind stepped quickly out. The yells of the infuriated savages
deafened her; but, although fearfully near, she saw none, and
started rapidly forward. Leland watched each step with an agony
of fear and anxiety which cannot be described. The trees were
within twenty yards, and half the distance was passed, when Leland
knew that her flight was discovered. A number of savages darted
forward, but a shot from him stopped the course of the foremost.
Taking advantage of the confusion which this had occasioned, Rosalind
sprung away and succeeded in reaching the cover; but here, upon
the very threshold of escape, she was reached and captured.</p>

<p>"Gorra mighty!" shouted Zeb, as he saw her seized and borne away.
"Ef I don't cowhide ebery nigger of 'em for dat trick."</p>

<p>And clenching his hands he stalked boldly forward and demanded:</p>

<p>"Whar's dat lady? Ef you doesn't want to git into trouble, I
calkilate you'd better bring her back in double-quick time."</p>

<p>Several savages sprung toward him, and Zeb prepared himself for
the struggle. His huge fist felled the first and the second; but
ere he could do further damage he found himself thrown down and
bound.</p>

<p>"Well, dar, if dat ain't de meanest trick yet, servin' a decent
prisoner dis way. I'll cowhide ebery one ob you. Oh, dear, I wish
I had de whip!" he muttered, writhing and rolling in helpless
rage upon the ground.</p>

<p>Leland had seen this occurrence and taken advantage of it. It
had served to divert the action of the savages, and the attention
of all being occupied with their two prisoners, he managed with
considerable difficulty to reach the wood without being discovered.</p>

<p>Here, at a safe distance, he watched the progress of things.
The building was now one mass of flame, which lit up the sky with
a lurid, unearthly glare. The border of the forest was visible
and the trunks and limbs of the trees appeared as if scorched
and reddened by the consuming heat. The savages resembled demons
dancing and yelling around the ruin which they had caused. It
was with difficulty that Leland restrained himself from firing
upon them. With a sad heart he saw the house which had sheltered
him from infancy fall inward with a crash. The splinters and ashes
of fire were hurled in the air and fell at his feet, and the thick
volume of smoke reached him.</p>

<p>Yet he thought more of the captives which were in the hands of
their merciless enemies. Their safety demanded his attention.
Thoughtfully and despondingly he turned upon his heel and disappeared
in the shadows of the great forest.</p>
