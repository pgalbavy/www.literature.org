<p>Fred's fear was that if any of the Apaches were near at hand
they would hear the beating of his heart&mdash;so intense was his excitement
and anxiety. But delay seemed only to increase it, and, pressing
close to the corner, he removed his cap and stealthily shoved
his head forward until he could look along the other side.</p>

<p>At the first glance, he jerked back as if he had caught the flash
of a rifle aimed at him, for the sight that he gazed upon was
startling enough. Within ten feet of him sat an Indian warrior,
his knees gathered up, his back against the arch, and his head
bowed as if in slumber.</p>

<p>The lad's first supposition was that the redskin was waiting
for him, and had seen his head as it was thrust forward and drawn
back again. But, as he listened, there was no sound to betray
any movement, and when he recalled the terrifying picture that
caught his eye, he remembered that the face of the warrior was
not turned toward him, so that it was hardly to be supposed that
he could have observed the stealthy movement. By carefully considering
the matter and reassuring himself, Fred soon gained sufficient
courage to repeat the attempt.</p>

<p>This time, after pushing his head forward enough to see the red-skin,
he held it motionless sufficiently long to take in the entire
picture.</p>

<p>The first thing which impressed itself upon his mind was the
fact that the Indian was not an Apache, or at least, did not belong
to the trio which had had him in charge. His dress and make-up
were altogether different, and he clearly belonged to another
tribe. The truth of it was, he was a Kiowa, and his attitude was
that of a sleeping person.</p>

<p>A dirty blanket was gathered about his shoulders, and his head,
with its straggling horse-hair covering, drooped so far forward
that the line of the face was at right angles with that of the
chest. The up-drawn knees were separated enough to permit a long,
gleaming rifle to rest between them, the barrel partly supported
by the shoulder, with the stock at his feet, while if the aquiline
nose, clear cut against the dim fire beyond, had descended three
or four inches lower, it would have been shut off from view by
the same knees. The blanket was thrown back far enough to reveal
the body, legs and moccasins of the warrior, which were those
of a man of powerful frame and great activity.</p>

<p>The camp-fire had smoldered as though it had not been replenished
for hours. Still it diffused a steady, subdued glow, from the
other side of the figure, as if the latter were stamped in ink,
and the picture was a striking one in every respect.</p>

<p>After Fred had scrutinized it a few minutes he gathered more
courage and took in the surroundings. These were not very extensive,
but such as they were, they were of a hopeful nature. Just in
front of the sleeping Indian were several objects lying upon the
leaves, which he was certain were the bones of some animal, most
probably a deer or buffalo.</p>

<p>"And if they are, there's meat upon them," was the consideration
of the lad, who smacked his lips in anticipation.</p>

<p>That might be, but how were they to be obtained? That was the
all-important question. It was not to be supposed that the most
skillful scout in the West could creep up to the feet of a sleeping
Kiowa and gather some food without an almost certainty of detection.
But for the fact that Fred was so hungry, nothing could have induced
him to make the attempt. As it was, he believed that he could
succeed. At any rate, he resolved that the attempt should be made.</p>

<p>"Maybe he'll wake up and turn over," reflected the boy, as he
fixed his eyes upon the Kiowa and watched him, like a cat waiting
for a mouse to come within its reach. "I wonder whether Indians
snore," added Fred, a moment later. "I can't hear him breathe,
and yet his chest seems to rise and sink, just as regular as anybody's."</p>

<p>Some ten minutes' more waiting brought the boy to the second
crisis in his perilous undertaking. With another ejaculated prayer
he crept out from the rock, and moved toward the "feast," as he
believed it to be.</p>

<p>He knew where the fragments lay, and, heading in that direction,
he moved carefully forward, while he kept his eyes fixed upon
that dreaded red-skin, who certainly seemed a remiss sentinel
when in an enemy's country. Only a few feet interposed, and these
were speedily passed over, and Fred stretched out his hand to
lay it upon what seemed the greatest prize of his life.</p>

<p>So, indeed, it proved.</p>

<p>The Kiowas, at some time during the day, had cooked some antelope
meat by that very campfire, and had scattered the remnants all
round. The first thing which Fred grasped was a bone, upon which
still remained considerable half-cooked meat. His hunger was so
consuming at that moment that, forgetful of the red-skin sitting
so near, he began knawing the bone like a famished dog.</p>

<p>Never did food taste sweeter and more delicious!</p>

<p>If the boy's jaws had been a little stronger, he would have crunched
up the bone also&mdash;but he cleaned it of its nutritious covering
so speedily and cleanly that it seemed as if done by some wonderful
machinery.</p>

<p>When he found that no more remained, he clawed about in the semi-darkness
for more and found it. Indeed, it looked very much as if the Kiowas
had left one of their rude meals prepared for some expected visitors.</p>

<p>When fairly under way, Fred did not stop until he had fully sated
his appetite, and there proved to be enough to satisfy all his
purpose. Then, when he craved no more, he awoke to a keen realization
of the extremely perilous position in which he was placed.</p>

<p>"I had better dig out of here," was the thought that came to
him, as he glanced furtively at the motionless figure. "He doesn't
see me yet, but there is no telling how soon he will."</p>

<p>And now the extraordinary good fortune which had attended the
boy up to this time seemed to desert him. He had scarcely begun
his return to the cover of the rock, when he felt a sudden desire
to sneeze coming over him. He grasped his nose, in the hope of
checking it&mdash;but it only made matters worse, and the explosion
which instantly followed was twice as great as it would have been
otherwise.</p>

<p>Poor Fred was in despair!</p>

<p>He felt that it was all over, and he was powerless to move. He
was like one overtaken by a dreadful nightmare, when he finds
himself unable to escape some appalling evil that is settling
down upon him. He turned, with a despairing glance, to the red-skin,
expecting to see the glitter of his tomahawk or knife as it descended.</p>

<p>The warrior did not stir! Could Indian sleep so sound?</p>

<p>Surely not, and the boy just then recalled the fate of the sentinel
Thompson, a couple of nights before.</p>

<p>"I believe he is dead," he muttered, looking attentively toward
him, and feeling a speedy return of his courage.</p>

<p>With a lingering fear and doubt besetting him, he crept around
the corner of the rock, taking one of the bones as he did so,
and, when in position, he gave it such a toss that it dropped
directly upon the head of the unconscious red man.</p>

<p>This was not a very prudent way of learning whether a man was
sleeping temporially or eternally, when so much depended upon
the decision of the question, for, if he were only taking a nap,
he would be certain to resent the taking of any such liberties
with his person. The test, however, was effectual. The bone struck
his bead, and glanced as though it had fallen against the surface
of a rock, and Fred could no longer doubt that the red-skin had
been slain while sitting in this very attitude by the fire.</p>

<p>Such was the case. There had been plotting and counterplotting.
While the Kiowas were playing their tricks upon the Apaches, the
latter managed to a certain extent to turn the tables. When they
branched out upon their reconnoitering expedition, Waukko was
engaged in the same business. When he discovered the single sentinel
sitting by the fire, he crept up like a phantom behind him, and
drove his hunting knife with such swift silence that his victim
gave only a spasmodic quiver and start, and was dead.</p>

<p>Waukko placed him in the position he was occupying at the time
he first caught sight of him, and then left his companions to
learn the truth for themselves, while he crept back to learn that
his prisoner had given his captor the slip.</p>

<p>Fred Munson was terrified when he found he was standing by the
dead form of his friend Thompson, a couple of nights before, and
so, in the present instance, a certain awe came over him, as it
naturally does when a person stands in the presence of death.
But, for all that, the boy was heartily glad, and he had wisdom
enough to improve the splendid opportunity that thus came to him,
and for which he had hardly dared to pray.</p>

<p>"I don't see what a dead man can want of a gun," he muttered,
as he moved rather timidly toward the figure, "and, therefore,
it will not be thieving for me to take it."</p>

<p>There was a little involuntary shuddering when he grasped the
barrel and sought to draw the weapon from its resting-place. The
inanimate warrior seemed to clutch it, as though unwilling to
let it go, and the feeling that he was struggling with a dead
man was anything but comfortable. Fred persevered, however, and
speedily had the satisfaction of feeling that the rifle was in
his possession.</p>

<p>The weapon was heavy for one of his size, but it was a thousand
times preferable to nothing.</p>

<p>He stood "hefting" it, as the expression goes, and turning it
over in his hand, when he heard the report of a second gun, this
time so close that he started, thinking it had been aimed at him.</p>

<p>Such was not the case; but at that moment there came an overpowering
conviction that he was doing a most foolhardy thing in remaining
so conspicuously in view, when the red-skins were liable to return
at any moment and wreak their vengeance upon him for the robbery,
to say nothing of the death, of their comrade, which might be
attributed to him. So he hurriedly and quietly withdrew into the
outer darkness.</p>
