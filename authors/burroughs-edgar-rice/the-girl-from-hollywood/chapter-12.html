<p>As Gaza de Lure entered the house in which she roomed, her landlady
came hastily from the living room.
</p>
<p>“Is that you, Miss Burke?” she asked. “Here is a telegram that came for
you just a few minutes ago. I do hope it’s not bad news!”
</p><p>The girl took the yellow envelope and tore it open. She read the
message through very quickly and then again slowly, her brows puckered
into a little frown, as if she could not quite understand the meaning
of the words she read.
</p><p>“Your mother ill,” the telegram said. “Possibly not serious--doctor
thinks best you come--will meet you morning train.” It was signed
“Custer Pennington.”
</p><p>“I do hope it’s not bad news,” repeated the landlady.
</p><p>“My mother is ill. They have sent for me,” said the girl. “I wonder if
you would be good enough to call up the S. P. and ask the first train I
can get that stops at Ganado, while I run upstairs and pack my bag?”
</p><p>“You poor little dear!” exclaimed the landlady. “I’m so sorry! I’ll
call right away, and then I’ll come up and help you.”
</p><p>A few minutes later she came up to say that the first train left at
nine o’clock in the morning. She offered to help pack; but the girl
said there was nothing that she could not do herself.
</p><p>“I must go out first for a few minutes,” Gaza told her. “Then I will
come back and finish packing the few things that it will be necessary
to take.”
</p><p>When the landlady had left, the girl stood staring dully at the black
traveling bag that she had brought from the closet and placed on her
bed; but she did not see the bag or the few pieces of lingerie that she
had taken from her dresser drawers. She saw only the sweet face of her
mother, and the dear smile that had always shone there to soothe each
childish trouble--the smile that had lighted the girl’s dark days, even
after she had left home.
</p><p>For a long time she stood there thinking--trying to realize what
it would mean to her if the worst should come. It could make no
difference, she realized, except that it might perhaps save her mother
from a still greater sorrow. It was the girl who was dead, though
the mother did not guess it; she had been dead for many months. This
hollow, shaking husk was not Shannon Burke--it was not the thing that
the mother had loved. It was almost a sacrilege to take it up there
into the clean country and flaunt it in the face of so sacred a thing
as mother love.
</p><p>The girl stepped quickly to a writing desk, and, drawing a key from
her vanity case, unlocked it. She took from it a case containing a
hypodermic syringe and a few small phials; then she crossed the hall to
the bathroom. When she came back, she looked rested and less nervous.
She returned the things to the desk, locked it, and ran downstairs.
</p><p>“I will be back in a few minutes,” she called to the landlady. “I shall
have to arrange a few things to-night with a friend.”
</p><p>She went directly to the Vista del Paso bungalow. Crumb was surprised
and not a little startled as he heard her key in the door. He had a
sudden vision of Allen returning, and he went white; but when he saw
who it was he was no less surprised, for the girl had never before
returned after leaving for the night.
</p><p>“My gracious!” he exclaimed. “Look who’s here!”
</p><p>She did not return his smile.
</p><p>“I found a telegram at home,” she said, “that necessitates my going
away for a few days. I came over to tell you, and to get a little snow
to last me until I come back. Where I am going they don’t have it, I
imagine.”
</p><p>He looked at her through narrowed, suspicious lids.
</p><p>“You’re going to quit me!” he cried accusingly. “That’s why you went
out with Allen! You can’t get away with it. I’ll never let you go. Do
you hear me? I’ll never let you go!”
</p><p>“Don’t be a fool, Wilson,” she replied. “My mother is ill, and I have
been sent for.”
</p><p>“Your mother? You never told me you had a mother.”
</p><p>“But I have, though I don’t care to talk about her to you. She needs
me, and I am going.”
</p><p>He was still suspicious.
</p><p>“Are you telling me the truth? Will you come back?”
</p><p>“You know I’ll come back,” she said. “I shall have to,” she added with
a weary sigh.
</p><p>“Yes, you’ll have to. You can’t get along without it. You’ll come back
all right--I’ll see to that!”
</p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked.
</p><p>“How much snow you got home?” he demanded.
</p><p>“You know I keep scarcely any there. I forgot my case to-day--left it
in my desk, so I had a little there--a couple of shots, maybe.”
</p><p>“Very well,” he said. “I’ll give you enough to last a week--then you’ll
have to come home.”
</p><p>“You say you’ll give me enough to last a week?” the girl repeated
questioningly. “I’ll take what I want--it’s as much mine as yours!”
</p><p>“But you don’t get any more than I’m going to give you. I won’t
have you gone more than a week. I can’t live without you--don’t you
understand? I believe you have a wooden heart, or none at all!”
</p><p>“Oh,” she said, yawning, “you can get some other poor fool to peddle it
for you if I don’t come back; but I’m coming, never fear. You’re as bad
as the snow--I hate you both, but I can’t live without either of you. I
don’t feel like quarreling, Wilson. Give me the stuff--enough to last a
week, for I’ll be home before that.”
</p><p>He went to the bathroom and made a little package up for her.
</p><p>“Here!” he said, returning to the living room. “That ought to last you
a week.”
</p><p>She took it and slipped it into her case.
</p><p>“Well, good-by,” she said, turning toward the door.
</p><p>“Aren’t you going to kiss me good-by?” he asked.
</p><p>“Have I ever kissed you, since I learned that you had a wife?” she
asked.
</p><p>“No,” he admitted; “but you might kiss me good-by now, when you’re
going away for a whole week.”.
</p><p>“Nothing doing, Wilson!” she said with a negative shake of the head.
“I’d as lief kiss a Gila monster!”
</p><p>He made a wry face.
</p><p>“You’re sure candid,” he said.
</p><p>She shrugged her shoulders in a gesture of indifference and moved
toward the door.
</p><p>“I can’t make you out, Gaza,” he said. “I used to think you loved me,
and the Lord knows I certainly love you! You are the only woman I ever
really loved. A year ago I believe you would have married me, but now
you won’t even let me kiss you. Sometimes I think there is some one
else. If I thought you loved another man, I’d--I’d----”
</p><p>“No, you wouldn’t. You were going to say that you’d kill me, but you
wouldn’t. You haven’t the nerve of a rabbit. You needn’t worry--there
isn’t any other man, and there never will be. After knowing you I
could never respect any man, much less love one of ’em. You’re all
alike--rotten! And let me tell you something--I never did love you. I
liked you at first, before I knew the hideous thing that you had done
to me. I would have married you, and I would have made you a good wife,
too--you know that. I wish I could believe that you do love me. I know
of nothing, Wilson, that would give me more pleasure than to <u>know</u>
that you loved me madly; but of course you’re not capable of loving
anything madly, except yourself.”
</p><p>“I do love you, Gaza,” he said seriously. “I love you so that I would
rather die than live without you.”
</p><p>She cocked her head on one side and eyed him quizzically.
</p><p>“I hope you do,” she told him; “for if it’s the truth, I can repay you
some measure of the suffering you have caused me. I can be around where
you can never get a chance to forget me, or to forget the fact that you
want me, but can never have me. You’ll see me every day, and every day
you will suffer vain regrets for the happiness that might have been
yours, if you had been a decent, honorable man; but you are not decent,
you are not honorable, you are not even a man!”
</p><p>He tried to laugh derisively, but she saw the slow red creep to his
face and knew that she had scored.
</p><p>“I hope you’ll feel better when you come back from your mother’s,” he
said. “You haven’t been very good company lately. Oh, by the way, where
did you say you are going?”
</p><p>“I didn’t say,” she replied.
</p><p>“Won’t you give me your address?” he demanded.
</p><p>“No.”
</p><p>“But suppose something happens? Suppose I want to get word to you?”
Crumb insisted.
</p><p>“You’ll have to wait until I get back,” she told him.
</p><p>“I don’t see why you can’t tell me where you’re going,” he grumbled.
</p><p>“Because there is a part of my life that you and your sort have never
entered,” she replied. “I would as lief take a physical leper to my
mother as a moral one. I cannot even discuss her with you without a
feeling that I have besmirched her.”
</p><p>On her face was an expression of unspeakable disgust as she passed
through the doorway of the bungalow and closed the door behind her.
Wilson Crumb simulated a shudder.
</p><p>“I sure was a damn fool,” he mused. “Gaza would have made the greatest
emotional actress the screen has ever known, if I’d given her a
chance. I guessed her wrong and played her wrong. She’s not like any
woman I ever saw before. I should have made her a great success and won
her gratitude--that’s the way I ought to have played her. Oh, well,
what’s the difference? She’ll come back!”
</p><p>He rose and went to the bathroom, snuffed half a grain of cocaine,
and then collected all the narcotics hidden there and every vestige
of contributary evidence of their use by the inmates of the bungalow.
Dragging a small table into his bedroom closet, he mounted and opened a
trap leading into the air space between the ceiling and the roof. Into
this he clambered, carrying the drugs with him.
</p><p>They were wrapped in a long, thin package, to which a light, strong
cord was attached. With this cord he lowered the package into the space
between the sheathing and the inner wall, fastening the end of the cord
to a nail driven into one of the studs at arm’s length below the wall
plate.
</p><p>“There!” he thought, as he clambered back into the closet. “It’ll take
some dick to uncover that junk!”
</p><p>Hidden between plaster and sheathing of the little bungalow was a
fortune in narcotics. Only a small fraction of their stock had the
two peddlers kept in the bathroom, and Crumb had now removed that, in
case Allen should guess that he had been betrayed by his confederate
and direct the police to the bungalow, or the police themselves should
trace his call and make an investigation on their own account. He
realized that he had taken a great risk; but his stratagem had saved
him from the deadly menace of Allen’s vengeance, at least for the
present. The fact that there must ultimately be an accounting with
the man he put out of his mind. It would be time enough to meet that
contingency when it arose.
</p><p>As a matter of fact, the police came to the bungalow that very evening;
but through no clew obtained from Allen, who, while he had suspicions
that were tantamount to conviction, chose to await the time when he
might wreak his revenge in his own way. The desk sergeant had traced
the call to Crumb, and after the arrest had been made a couple of
detective sergeants called upon him. They were quiet, pleasant-spoken
men, with an ingratiating way that might have deceived the possessor of
a less suspicious brain than Crumb’s.
</p><p>“The lieutenant sent us over to thank you for that tip,” said the
spokesman. “We got him all right, with the junk on him.”
</p><p>Not for nothing was Wilson Crumb a talented actor. None there was who
could better have registered polite and uninterested incomprehension.
</p><p>“I am afraid,” he said, “that I don’t quite get you. What tip? What are
you talking about?”
</p><p>“You called up the station, Mr. Crumb. We had central trace the call.
There is no use----”
</p><p>Crumb interrupted him with a gesture. He didn’t want the officer to go
so far that it might embarrass him to retract.
</p><p>“Ah!” he exclaimed, a light of understanding illuminating his face. “I
believe I have it. What was the message? I think I can explain it.”
</p><p>“We think you can, too,” agreed the sergeant, “seein’ you phoned the
message.”
</p><p>“No, but I didn’t,” said Crumb, “although I guess it may have come over
my phone all right. I’ll tell you what I know about it. A car drove
up a little while after dinner, and a man came to the door. He was a
stranger. He asked if I had a phone, and if he could use it. He said
he wanted to phone an important and confidential message to his wife.
He emphasized the ‘confidential,’ and there was nothing for me to do
but go in the other room until he was through. He was only a minute or
two talking, and then he called me. He wanted to pay for the use of
the phone. I didn’t hear what he said over the phone, but I guess that
explains the matter. I’ll be careful next time a stranger wants to use
my phone.”
</p><p>“I would,” said the sergeant dryly. “Would you know him if you saw him
again?”
</p><p>“I sure would,” said Crumb.
</p><p>They rose to go.
</p><p>“Nice little place you have here,” remarked one of them, looking around.
</p><p>“Yes,” said Crumb, “it is very comfortable. Wouldn’t you like to look
it over?”
</p><p>“No,” replied the officer. “Not now--maybe some other time.”
</p><p>Crumb grinned after he had closed the door behind them.
</p><p>“I wonder,” he mused, “if that was a threat or a prophecy!”
</p><p>A week later Slick Allen was sentenced to a year in the county jail for
having morphine in his possession.
