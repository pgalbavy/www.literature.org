<p>It was fairly good walking up the shore, so that the two searchers were
able to make excellent progress here. Much of the way the waves had
pounded the beach until it was hard and level as a floor. But in places
the sand was strewn with quantities of sea shells, many of them broken.
These troubled Van Dusen a little, even though he wore heavy-soled
shoes. He wondered that the barefooted Ichabod experienced no discomfort
to all appearance. As a matter of fact, the old fisherman's soles were
horny, tough as any leather.
</p><p>As the two journeyed on, the detective gratified his natural curiosity
concerning things round-about by questioning his companion. He was
especially interested in the small bands of wild ponies that appeared
from time to time. These, like himself, were inquisitive, and often
would stand gazing with curious eyes, until the men were within a
hundred yards of them, before they would show their heels and go
cantering off through the deep sand.
</p><p>Ichabod, though he answered at length all the questions put to him by
the detective, kept up a train of thinking apart. He showed the results
of it presently when he spoke.
</p><p>"Do ye know, Mr. Detective," he began, "I've been a-thinkin' a whole
week 'bout that poor cuss what me an' you are a-tryin' to run down? Do
ye know, from what that pretty gal says, I don't say as how that feller
orter go to a jail house? Thar's a heap o' good left in that man yit.
Jest think what he done out thar in the Sound a-savin' o' the kid! That
wa'n't the act o' no beast--not by a damned sight!"
</p><p>"Yes, Captain," Van Dusen answered, "I'll admit that was not the act of
a beast. But don't you think that a man becomes worse than a beast when
he allows the craving for drugs to destroy mind and body and to prompt
him to acts such as those of which this degenerate has been guilty?"
</p><p>"But, Mr. Detective," the fisherman argued, "that man was led astray.
Seems as if, 'cordin' to my way o' thinkin', this case is a heap like
that o' a poor gal what's led off when she's young. It don't make no
difference what happens arterward. The folks, women 'specially, won't
give her no credit, no matter how hard she tries to go right. They jest
naturally kain't see no good in her. Ye see, I used to know a gal like
that. But she was smart. She up an' moved clear out o' the country, an'
started life all over ag'in. It's right-smart hard to believe, but, sir,
that gal married a preacher, an' worked a durn sight harder fer God than
a heap o' the ones that she up and left behind did! Them poor fools are
still a-talkin' 'bout her. Now, Mr. Van Dusen, do ye exactly have to
arrest Garnet if we find him?"
</p><p>"Well," the detective answered, "since he's a murderer any one has the
right to arrest him. For my part, I have no right to take him in charge
for the other things he's done. I have no warrant, an' I'm not a state
officer."
</p><p>"What I'm afeard of," Ichabod went on, "is that while he's a-sufferin'
so, an' so full o' remorse, he'll do away with himself. If he don't do
that now, I 'low as how he's a cured man. It's my opinion that feller
will never hit the dope ag'in. An' if he don't, he's too valuable a man
to lose. If we come up with him, let's me an' you see if we can't git
him to do what that kind-hearted little girl wanted him to--go off
somewhars under another name an' work fer his feller human bein's, an'
fer God. A man, when he does it right, is a-workin' fer Him when he
practices medicine!"
</p><p>Unaccustomed emotion vibrated in Van Dusen's voice as he replied:
</p><p>"Captain, you yourself would make a good one to work for the Master. You
have a heart! And, in my profession, I find many, both men and women,
who are heartless. I would not willingly put a straw in the way of
Garnet. But, just the same, for the love of God and man, think what his
guilt is."
</p><p>The old fisherman wagged his head in assent.
</p><p>"Yes, I admit he has done a heap o' evil. But, Mr. Detective, the
closin' words that man said to Ethel Marion are still a-ringin' in my
ears. I hain't got much edicatin, but I can repeat 'em jest like she
said the Doctor said 'em. Here they be: 'My only hope now is to return
you safe to your friends an' to do my utmost to explain these most
unbelievable circumstances. I care nothing fer my own future. It is
ruined, an', like a good patient, I am ready to take my medicine.'"
</p><p>As the old man ended his quotation from the Doctor's farewell to Ethel,
Van Dusen suddenly pointed a little way ahead.
</p><p>"Unless I'm greatly mistaken," he exclaimed, "he has already taken--or
been given--his medicine. That looks to me like a yachtsman's cap down
there on the beach. You said he was dressed in yachting costume."
</p><p>The two men hurried forward. When they reached the cap, which was
weighted down with a shell, the detective picked it up and found a note
pinned to the top of it. Captain Ichabod glanced about him with
apprehension at thought of the tragedy that might have occurred here.
</p><p>Just beyond where they were standing there was a sort of false inlet. It
does not show as an inlet upon the map. Nevertheless, at times it allows
the water to cut clear across the Core Banks. Except at high tide, it is
shallow. But it is not safe for fording by those who do not know the
way, for the bed of it abounds in treacherous quicksands. It was indeed
at this point that Captain Jones had feared lest Garnet, a stranger,
might meet with disaster. Now, it seemed likely that he had.
</p><p>Van Dusen unpinned the note, opened it, and read aloud:
</p><p>     "To the World:
</p><pre>
     "I hope to cross this unknown channel in safety, for the sake of
     the young woman, Ethel Marion, who is pure and innocent. I have
     spent my energies in order that the world might be benefited. But
     in zeal to win the fame for myself while helping others, I resorted
     to drugs to give me a capacity for strength beyond that apportioned
     to me by my Creator. Let my guilt serve as a warning to every
     professional man who desires to be of service to his fellows. There
     can be no gain to humanity from a folly that must cost him his own
     soul.
     "GIFFORD GARNET."</pre>
<p>[Illustration: Van Dusen unpinned the note, opened it, and read aloud.]
</p><p>Ichabod burst forth excitedly as the reading ended.
</p><p>"Thar, now, didn't I tell ye that feller was no beast? The poor man! I
wonder if he did get over all right. Maybe he has jest really destroyed
himself, an' meant to, but didn't want folks to think he was that kind
o' a coward."
</p><p>Van Dusen shook his head.
</p><p>"No, I don't believe he meant to kill himself. I believe he meant to try
his best to cross, but feared he might be swept away and drowned."
</p><p>Ichabod bade the detective wait while he himself should ford the inlet
in order to look for tracks in the sand on the further side. He reached
the opposite shore safely, and there moved to and fro along the water's
edge for a time, apparently making a close search. Van Dusen awaited a
signal, but there was none. At last, Ichabod reÃ«ntered the water and
crossed to where the detective awaited him. In answer to the mute
inquiry of his companion's gaze, Captain Jones shook his head sadly as
he spoke.
</p><p>"Mr. Van Dusen, thar hain't a doubt in my mind but that God A'mighty
will be mighty easy with that feller at the judgment seat."
</p><p>The two slowly retraced their steps toward the cabin. The detective
purposely lagged a little. He wished to save his companion from
over-exertion. He had never hitherto seen a man of such advanced age
endure so much strenuous physical activity, and he feared that it might
bring ill consequences. As a matter of fact, of the two, Ichabod
probably felt less fatigued.
</p><p>It was dark by the time they reached the landing. A sailor from the
yacht was in waiting for them with a motor-equipped tender, similar to
that of <u>The Isabel</u>. The man had already made his painter fast to the
disabled boat, ready for towing it back to the yacht. Very quickly, the
detective and fisherman were aboard, and the little boat was chugging
sturdily toward <u>The Hialdo</u>. Van Dusen reflected, almost with a sigh of
regret, that his work was practically at an end. There remained only to
make a report to the Collector of the Port and the Justice of the Peace
at Beaufort. He would exhibit to them the cap and the accompanying note,
and thus the case would be done with. The evidence would eliminate
Doctor Garnet from further consideration.
</p><p>Ichabod regarded the detective as a man of extraordinary experience and
ability. He proposed to avail himself of the wisdom here ready to his
need.
</p><p>"Mr. Van Dusen," he demanded suddenly, "air ye a fambly man?"
</p><p>"I suppose," was the answer, given with a smile, "you mean by that, am I
so lucky as to have a wife and children."
</p><p>"That's it!" Ichabod agreed.
</p><p>"No, my friend, I am sorry to say that I am not. I suspect I'm one of
those fellows that will keep putting it off until it's too late. But,
why do you ask?"
</p><p>"I reckon the reason is," the old man said very solemnly, "cause I'm
goin' to be, myself, an' that right soon. An' I thought if ye was, ye
might be able to give me a little advice 'bout the pre-nuptals, as Sarey
calls 'em. She mentioned it, an', to tell ye the truth, I didn't know
the meanin' o' the remark. Is it something pertain' to weddin' frocks
an' things, or air ye like me, igornant? She said, jest before I left,
that it'd take a little time for the pre-nuptals, an' since I ag'in
realized how unsartin life is, I sorter thought I'd like to have it over
with to-morrer."
</p><p>Van Dusen smiled.
</p><p>"I don't think you need to worry, Captain Ichabod," he declared
soothingly. "I think the pre-nuptials will be satisfactorily adjusted by
you without any trouble. All you need to do is to walk up to your girl
to-morrow, and wave before her the five-thousand-dollar check Roy
Morton's going to give you as your reward. So long as you have the
wherewithal for the post-nuptials you don't need to worry about the
pre-. Then you might tell her that there's a fine yacht all ready to
take the two of you north for a honeymoon trip."
</p><p>Van Dusen dropped his bantering tone and spoke with great cordiality.
</p><p>"Leaving all joking aside, Captain, here is a splendid chance for you.
I'll take you and your bride all the way to New York, or I'll drop you
at any port you like between. I know that Roy and Miss Marion will be
delighted by this chance to get better acquainted with the man who made
their reunion possible. They owe everything to you."
</p><p>"Yes," Ichabod retorted; "an' I owe them a heap, too. It's that girl
that started the whole change in my way o' thinkin'. She caused me to
decide to take on a fambly an' happiness. I don't much like what ye says
'bout that-thar five thousand, though. Ye see, we folks down this way
don't go round savin' lives fer pay--that is 'ceptin' the coast-guard
boys. What we does is fer the feelin's that possess us. Why, do ye know,
if thar's airy man in Cartaret that I didn't think'd do what I did, an'
more, in this scrape, I'd head a passel o' men to run him clean into the
swamps fer keeps!"
</p><p>"It's a legally posted reward offered for the discovery of Ethel
Marion," Van Dusen explained, "and there is no question as to its being
rightfully yours. You need have no scruple about taking it. But Roy and
his sweetheart will convince you as to that, even if I can't."
</p><p>Ichabod appeared dubious for the moment. Then his face wrinkled in a
grin, for he had found a method whereby to satisfy his conscience in the
matter.
</p><p>"Wall," he declared judicially, "I has lost consider'ble time from my
fishin'." Then his enthusiasm overcame his air of reticence. "Whoopee!
Five-thousand dollars! I cal'late that sure will cut out them
pre-nuptals--whatever they be."
