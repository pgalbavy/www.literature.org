<p>Lieutenant Fred Godfrey expected such a reception from Jake Golcher
as would give him a suitable excuse for opening fire on the Tory
and the Senecas, but the panic of the leader disarmed his enmity,
and really forced the arrangement that was now carried out; one
that, it may be said, was intensely disagreeable to Dick Durkee
and his comrades, who were unwilling to spare such miscreants.</p>

<p>But the lieutenant was the commander, and there was no rebellion
against his orders.</p>

<p>"Bring your warriors up here," ordered Fred, and Golcher made
a sign for the Senecas to approach.</p>

<p>They moved forward a few paces, but, mistrusting the purposes
of the patriots, refused to come further. Golcher berated, and
ordered them to advance, telling them&mdash;what they already knew&mdash;they
were covered by the guns of the whites.</p>

<p>But they stood sullenly apart, and began moving in the direction
of the river.</p>

<p>At this moment Dick Durkee called out:</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, shall we fire? We've got every wretch of 'em fast."</p>

<p>"Keep them covered, but don't shoot unless they raise their guns,"
called Fred, who was embarrassed by the unexpected turn.</p>

<p>"May I go with 'em?" asked Jake Golcher, in a cringing voice,
beginning to back away from his dreaded master.</p>

<p>"Yes, go; and I pray Heaven none of us may ever look on your
face again."</p>

<p>Fred should have been prepared for what followed, inasmuch as
no one understood the treacherous nature of Tory and Indian better
than he, but, as we have intimated, he was confronted by an unexpected
condition of affairs, and was caught off his guard, so to speak.</p>

<p>He saw the warriors withdrawing, and already entering the wood
on his left, while he stood in the full light of the camp-fire,
calmly watching the movement.</p>

<p>"Fred, move away from there," called out his father; "you are
too good a mark for them."</p>

<p>Fortunately, the young man stepped back and to one side, placing
himself near Dick Durkee, who stood with cocked rifle, fairly
quivering with rage, because he was forced to hold his fire.</p>

<p>Fred himself had his pistol at command, but he was without any
rifle, having handed his over to one of his friends, when he went
forward with Habakkuk McEwen.</p>

<p>The Indians were in the fringe of the wood, when all the former
prisoners, who were sitting on the fallen tree, sprang up, and
began moving away.</p>

<p>At this juncture one of Durkee's men shouted:</p>

<p>"Look out! They're going to shoot!"</p>

<p>The words were yet in his mouth, when Jake Golcher, with unparalleled
treachery, raised the gun that he had caught from one of the Senecas,
and aimed directly at Maggie Brainerd.</p>

<p>His position was such that only her father understood his purpose,
and he sprang forward to shield his daughter, throwing himself
before her at the very moment the Tory discharged his gun.</p>

<p>With a groan of pain, the brave parent staggered a few steps
and fell heavily to the ground.</p>

<p>"Just as I expected," exclaimed Dick Durkee. "Give it to 'em,
boys! Don't spare one!"</p>

<p>With incredible celerity the Iroquois fired their guns almost
simultaneously with the Tory, and then darted off like so many
shadows through the wood, the dim morning light being insufficient
to betray them in the thick undergrowth.</p>

<p>But Dick Durkee and his men returned the volley instantly, and
sprang after them.</p>

<p>Fred Godfrey had not noticed the fall of his father, but, with
his whole soul aflame at the outrage, he dashed toward the wretches,
pistol in hand, determined to wreak vengeance on the party, who,
he well knew, were inspired to the deed by Golcher himself.</p>

<p>On the edge of the wood, where the Senecas had stood for a single
moment when they fired their guns, two of their number were stretched
lifeless, proving that the return volley had done some execution.</p>

<p>The settlers charged through the undergrowth without any regard
to order and the peril into which they might precipitate themselves.</p>

<p>Had Gray Panther and his warriors appeared on the ground at that
crisis, in all probability he would have drawn the entire party
into ambush, and cut them off to a man.</p>

<p>But the fleeing force was too small to attempt a stand, or any
such tactics, and they devoted themselves entirely to getting
away.</p>

<p>They were more expert in this than their pursuers, and scattering&mdash;as
is the custom of the red men to this day, when closely pressed&mdash;each
used all his energy and cunning in flight.</p>

<p>Dick Durkee and his men, including Fred Godfrey, went crashing
and tearing ahead, glaring in front and to the right and left
in quest of a target, but finding none, until, when the blind
pursuit had lasted fifteen minutes or more, it dawned on those
concerned that it was idle to attempt anything more.</p>

<p>Then they stopped for breath, and, turning about, began straggling
back toward camp.</p>

<p>Fred Godfrey would have been the last to rejoin his friends had
he not been seized with a dread that something might go wrong
with those who were left defenseless.</p>

<p>He therefore hastened, and in the gray light of the morning came
upon a scene of sadness.</p>

<p>Richard Brainerd, his step-father, lay on his back, with his
head in the lap of Maggie, while Eva was weeping over him, and
Aunt Peggy was standing beside them, her face streaming with tears.</p>

<p>Gravity Gimp was rolling on the ground in an agony of sorrow,
for he saw what was apparent to the young man&mdash;the loved father
and master was dying.</p>

<p>Fred knelt by his side, and taking a whisky flask from the rough
but kind-hearted Dick Durkee, pressed it to the white lips of
the sufferer.</p>

<p>"It's no use, Fred," said he, with a sad smile; "I'm done for.
Jake Golcher fired that shot, but he meant it for Maggie, and
not for me. I'm close to death."</p>

<p>"I hope it isn't as bad as that," said Fred, through his tears,
his manner showing he could not believe his own words.</p>

<p>"It's as well that I should go," said the old man, rallying slightly;
"and I'm thankful that the rest of you escaped. Good-bye, Fred."</p>

<p>The youth took the hand that was already growing clammy and limp,
and, returning the pressure, could only murmur:</p>

<p>"Good-bye, good bye; would that it had been I, rather than such
a noble father as you have always been to me."</p>

<p>Gravity Gimp, rousing to a sense of the situation, rushed forward
with irrestrainable grief, and shook the hand of his master, bending
over and kissing his forehead.</p>

<p>Aunt Peggy did the same, and then came the last, sad parting
scene between the father and his loved daughters.</p>

<p>The murmured words were heard only by Maggie and Eva, who treasured
them up in after-years as the most precious mementos of their
lives.</p>

<p>When the mild, loving eyes of the parent gradually grew dim,
they rested upon the tearful faces of the two girls; and, as he
entered the land of shadows, his last memory of the world he left
behind was illumined by those two yearning countenances, whose
kisses were pressed upon his lips. And the dark angel, reaching
out his hand, took that of the patriot, and led him through the
shadowy valley into the bright realms beyond.</p>
