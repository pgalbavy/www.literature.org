<p>Old dog Spot was trotting down the road with the bundle of clothes in
his mouth--the clothes which belonged to Johnnie Green's friend Red, who
was one of the swimming party in the mill pond.
</p>
<p>Somewhat to Spot's surprise the boys had not come tearing down the road
after him.
</p><p>"It's queer," he said to himself. "I wonder why they don't follow me.
This would be fun if they'd only chase me."
</p><p>Just then he happened to spy a squirrel on a stone wall. Spot promptly
made for this gentleman. Keeping a firm hold on his bundle, he plunged
through a tangle of blackberry bushes that grew beside the road.
</p><p>The thorny brambles caught at Spot's bundle and held it fast.
</p><p>"_G-r-r-r!_" he growled. "I don't want to lose sight of that fat fellow.
Unless I'm mistaken, it was Frisky Squirrel. And I've had an eye out for
him for a longtime."
</p><p>After a few frantic tugs he let go of the bundle of clothes and dashed
after the squirrel.
</p><p>It was Frisky Squirrel. He ran up a tree while Spot was struggling in
the blackberry thicket. And he scampered from one tree top to another
while Spot followed beneath him, barking furiously.
</p><p>At last Frisky stopped and sat on a limb, to chatter and scold at old
dog Spot.
</p><p>"What are you doing so far from home?" he demanded after a while.
</p><p>"I've been swimming in the mill pond with the boys," said old dog Spot.
</p><p>"Then you'd better go back there at once, unless you want a punishing
later," Frisky Squirrel told him. "I can hear them whistling for you."
</p><p>It wasn't far from the mill pond--that place where they were talking,
for Spot's chase of Frisky Squirrel had led him back up the hill again.
Now Spot cocked his ear in the direction of the pond and listened. Sure
enough! he could hear Johnnie Green's whistle.
</p><p>"I'll see you again," he told Frisky Squirrel.
</p><p>"Not if I see you first!" Frisky muttered as old Spot started through
the woods for the mill pond.
</p><p>"Come here!" Johnnie Green greeted him sternly when, a few minutes
later, he appeared on the bank. "Where are those clothes that you
took?"
</p><p>Spot wagged his tail. He acted very, very friendly. Nobody would have
supposed, from his looks, that he had stolen anyone's clothes.
</p><p>"This is no joke," Johnnie Green declared. "I haven't anything to wear.
Get those clothes and bring them back here!"
</p><p>"I don't know what's the matter with Johnnie," Spot thought. "I didn't
touch his things. I don't see why he's so angry."
</p><p>"Good old Spot!" Johnnie coaxed. "Find the clothes! There's a good
fellow!"
</p><p>He waded toward the bank and snapped his fingers at Spot.
</p><p>The old dog edged away. Johnnie <u>talked</u> pleasantly enough. But he had
a queer look in his eye. Spot thought it safer to keep out of his
clutches.
</p><p>Just then the miller came driving up the hill on a load of corn. When he
saw the boys in the pond he stopped his horses.
</p><p>"Anybody here lost any clothes?" he asked, holding a bundle up in his
hand. "I found these by the side of the road. I noticed them hanging on
a blackberry bush."
</p><p>"I'll take 'em!" Johnnie Green cried. "They belong to Red. But you can
leave them with me."
</p><p>The miller tossed the bundle to him.
</p><p>The boy Red, wearing Johnnie's clothes, was watching everything that
went on, from behind a tree. He waited until Johnnie had untied the
hard, wet knots in the clothes. Then he stepped out from his hiding
place.
</p><p>"Let's swap!" he said. And while they were swapping, old dog Spot took a
swim in the mill pond. Somehow he felt that all was well again.
