<p>GRANDFATHER MOLE was digging a new gallery under the garden, leading out
from his house into a field of corn, where he expected to find a good
many fine grubs.
</p>
<p>His work was half done, and he was under the cabbage-patch, when he
found himself in the open air. Farmer Green's hired man's hoe had left a
small hollow between two heads of cabbage; and as luck had it,
Grandfather Mole's gallery led straight into it. So the first thing he
knew, there he was right out in the light of early morning! And somebody
called out in a cheery sort of voice, "How-dy-do, Grandfather Mole!
It's a pleasure to see you! And isn't this a beautiful day?"
</p><p>Grandfather Mole knew at once that he had nothing to fear, for he
recognized Jimmy Rabbit's voice. And he knew, too, without being told,
that he was in the cabbage-patch. For Jimmy Rabbit could be nowhere else
at breakfast time.
</p><p>"Good morning!" said Grandfather Mole. "I hope you are enjoying your
breakfast."
</p><p>"I am," Jimmy Rabbit answered. "And as soon as I've finished this leaf
I'm eating now, I'm going to take a stroll. Won't you join me?"
</p><p>"I don't care if I do," said Grandfather Mole--meaning that he'd be glad
to walk with Jimmy. And in about half a minute Jimmy Rabbit said he was
ready.
</p><p>"Very well!" Grandfather Mole told him. "Let's be on our way! I'll see
you at the edge of the duck-pond." And to Jimmy Rabbit's amazement he
stuck his nose straight down into the loose dirt, thrust out his strong
fore-feet, and was out of sight before Jimmy Rabbit could speak.
</p><p>The duck-pond was just beyond the garden fence. And since Grandfather
Mole had accepted Jimmy's invitation there was nothing for Jimmy Rabbit
to do but to go to the edge of the pond and wait.
</p><p>He grew very restless, for it was a long time before Grandfather Mole
appeared. But at last the old gentleman's head came popping up out of
the ground, and the owner of the head cried, "Here I am! And I'm glad to
see you haven't kept me waiting, young man. I dug so fast I was afraid
I'd get here before you did."
</p><p>Really, he had made astonishing speed for one who had tunnelled his way
underground. And being a polite person, Jimmy Rabbit could only tell
Grandfather Mole that he had been very quick.
</p><p>"And now we're this far," Grandfather Mole remarked, "I'd like to stroll
over in the meadow--if that suits you."
</p><p>Jimmy Rabbit said that it did. There was clover in the meadow. And he
had waited so long for Grandfather Mole that he had begun to feel hungry
again. A luncheon of clover-tops! It would be exactly what he needed.
</p><p>"Then let's be on our way!" Grandfather Mole cried again. "I'll join you
on the other side of the duck-pond!"
