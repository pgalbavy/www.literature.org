<p>It was just as Jimmy Rabbit had said. You remember that as he stood
behind Frisky Squirrel's back with his mother's big shears, all ready
to cut off Frisky's tail, he had told Frisky that "it would all be
over in a jiffy"?
</p>
<p>Well, it <u>was</u>. But things didn't happen just as Jimmy Rabbit had
expected. He had taken a good, firm grip on the shears, and he was
just about to shut them upon Frisky's tail with a snap, when somebody
called Frisky's name. Frisky knew who it was right away. It was his
mother! And like most of us, when our mothers catch us doing something
we ought not to do, Frisky was so surprised and so startled that he
gave a great jump.
</p><p>That jump was all that saved Frisky's tail. For just as Mrs. Squirrel
called, Jimmy Rabbit shut the shears together as hard as he could. But
Jimmy was too late. When Frisky jumped, his tail followed him, of
course. It whisked out from between the shears; and they closed upon
nothing at all.
</p><p>"Now, that's too bad!" Jimmy exclaimed. He had been so interested in
what he was doing that he had never heard Mrs. Squirrel at all. "Come
back here and we'll try again."
</p><p>The words were scarcely out of Jimmy Rabbit's mouth when he received a
terrific box on the ear. Now, it's bad enough for anybody to have his
ears boxed. But Jimmy's ears were so big that I dare say it hurt him
three times as much as it would have hurt anyone else. And it
surprised him, too. For he hadn't heard Mrs. Squirrel as she stole up
behind him. Anyhow, he ran off howling, taking his mother's shears
with him.
</p><p>"That awful Rabbit boy!" Mrs. Squirrel said. "A moment more and he
would have cut off your beautiful tail--your best feature, too!"
</p><p>"What's a feature, Mother?" Frisky asked.
</p><p>"Why--your nose, and your eyes, and your ears--anything of that sort,"
Mrs. Squirrel said. "It makes me feel faint just to think what almost
happened."
</p><p>"But Jimmy Rabbit says long tails are out of fashion," said Frisky.
</p><p>"Out of fashion indeed!" Mrs. Squirrel sniffed. "He's jealous--that's
what's the trouble with him. He wishes he had a fine, long, bushy tail
himself. Goodness me! I'm all of a flutter--I'm so upset." And poor
Mrs. Squirrel sat right down and fanned herself with her sun-bonnet.
"Now, don't you ever let anybody try to cut off your tail again," she
said to Frisky. "You have your father's tail. And everybody always
said that he had the most beautiful tail that was ever seen in these
woods."
</p><p>Frisky didn't quite understand what his mother meant. If he had his
father's tail, then where was his? And if it was his, then where was
his father's? All the way home he kept asking himself questions like
those. But whatever the answers might be, Frisky was glad that he
still bore that beautiful brush. He began to see that he would have
looked very queer, with just a short stub like Jimmy Rabbit's.
