<p>Brigham Edwards stopped short on hearing the signal of Kenton,
and he and his wife held themselves ready to repulse any attack
from the Indians, whom they knew to be in the neighborhood. Red
Crow did a little thing which won the confidence of the couple,
who could not help regarding him at first with suspicion: he placed
himself directly in front, with his bow and arrow ready for use.</p>

<p>The little party was not kept long in suspense. From among the
trees strode the athletic figure of the famous scout, who, at
that time, was in his magnificent prime. Directly behind him walked
Wharton Edwards and Larry Murphy.</p>

<p>At the sight of her son, the mother forgot everything else. Dropping
her rifle to the ground, she ran forward with the exclamation:</p>

<p>"Wharton! my darling boy!"</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, my dearest mother!"</p>

<p>The lad, equally forgetful, flung aside his weapon and met his
beloved parent more than half way, throwing his arms about her
neck, while both wept with joy. The father smilingly advanced,
and waited until the youth was released. Then he clasped the boy
to his breast with a happiness and gratitude as deep and all-pervading,
though it was less demonstrative.</p>

<p>Larry stepped blushingly forward, when the way was clear, and
was warmly greeted in turn by the parents, for he held a warm
place in their hearts. He was a dutiful and respectable youth,
who appreciated the unselfish goodness those people had always
shown to him.</p>

<p>Even the grim, iron-hearted scout betrayed a suspicious moisture
of the eyes at the affecting scene. He looked on in silence, while
Red Crow gazed off among the trees as though he saw something
that interested him. What strange musings coursed through that
warped brain is beyond the power of fancy to imagine.</p>

<p>"This 'ere looks sorter like a family reunion," remarked Kenton,
with a smile, when the first flurry was over; "I shouldn't wonder
now, Brigham, if you and Margaret thar are summat glad to see
the younkers agin."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I shall always thank heaven for its mercies. Wife and
I did not sleep a wink last night after we learned how bad things
looked, and nothing could have kept us from hurrying to them."</p>

<p>"And how about you chaps?" asked the scout, turning toward the
two happy boys.</p>

<p>"Neither of us can express our thankfulness," replied Wharton;
"we have seen a good deal of trouble during the last few days,
but our suffering all the time had been about them."</p>

<p>"Yis," added Larry with a sigh; "it was mesilf that had not only
them to think about, but Whart was on me hands, too, and thare
was times whin I was ready to give up entirely."</p>

<p>"Well, Simon," said the head of the family, "we've had good fortune
so far, but I have had enough experience to know that we are not
out of the woods yet."</p>

<p>"Not by a long shot," was the expressive comment.</p>

<p>"How do things look to you?"</p>

<p>"Yer see that Blazing Arrer and one of his varmints has gone
ahead and across the clearin' out yender. They know that we have
started to round this part of the trail with the idee of comin'
back agin beyend whar they're watchin' for us."</p>

<p>"And they will try to prevent us doing so?"</p>

<p>"That's it, and it's goin' to be a tough job, with the hosses
to take care of."</p>

<p>"I've been thinking lately that the only safe plan is to abandon
the animals and push on ourselves."</p>

<p>"That will give us the best show, thar's no doubt about that;
but I hate powerfully to let the varmints get ahead of us, even
as much as that."</p>

<p>"You and I, Simon, have tramped the woods long enough to know
that we must take things as we find them. It's a hundred times
better that we should leave the horses than to imperil our lives
by keeping them with us."</p>

<p>"The man as would deny them sentiments is a fool, but we hain't
got to that p'int yet."</p>

<p>"I notice that the ground is much more difficult to get over
than where we turned out to avoid the swamp. Both the horses fell
once or twice with their loads, and I had almost reached the conclusion
that we would have to turn back or abandon them. They are the
only animals I own, and their loss would be a serious one, but
it won't do to stop at that."</p>

<p>While this fragmentary conversation was going on, Arqu-wao, or
Red Crow, held his position as motionless as before, and seemingly
occupied with something among the trees, invisible to the rest.
The boys noticed that he assumed his old attitude, which had caused
them so much uneasiness before. But, inasmuch as there could be
no misgiving now as to his intentions, they were certain that
their former suspicions were unjust. When he surrendered to them
in the early light of that breaking morning, he did so unreservedly,
and had done his best to serve them. It was a great comfort to
know this, but how much greater it would have been had they known
it from the first.</p>

<p>He showed a quicker perception than any of his companions suspected,
for he understood the doubt in the mind of the ranger and the
settler concerning the horses. Turning about, he said:</p>

<p>"Arqu-wao show way to settlement."</p>

<p>"But we know the way ourselves," said Mr. Edwards, kindly.</p>

<p>"Show way for hosses."</p>

<p>"You mean by the trail yonder; we have come over that, but the
Shawanoes are on the watch, and we dare not follow it."</p>

<p>"Arqu-wao show way for hosses &mdash;Shaw'noe don't know&mdash;get
dere quick &mdash;Snaw'noe don't see."</p>

<p>The pioneer turned to the scout.</p>

<p>"He means to say that he knows of a route to the settlement different
from the regular trail, over which we can take the animals in
safety."</p>

<p>"That's what the varmint is drivin' at."</p>

<p>"What do you think of it, Simon?"</p>

<p>The scout significantly touched his forehead and shook his head.</p>

<p>"I know that, but he has done well so far. He lives by himself
in the woods, and must be more familiar with it than any of his
people. I'm inclined to believe there is something in what he
says."</p>

<p>"I haven't much faith in a chap whose brain is twisted hind side
afore, but I don't know as it will do any harm to try it; leastways
we've stood here longer than we oughter."</p>
