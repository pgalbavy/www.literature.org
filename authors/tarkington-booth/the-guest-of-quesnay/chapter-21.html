<p>Mr. Earl Percy and I sat opposite each other at dinner that evening.
Perhaps, for charity's sake, I should add that though we faced
each other, and, indeed, eyed each other solemnly at intervals,
we partook not of the same repast, having each his own table;
his being set in the garden at his constant station near the gallery
steps, and mine, some fifty feet distant, upon my own veranda,
but moved out from behind the honeysuckle screen, for I sat alone
and the night was warm.</p>

<p>To analyse my impression of Mr. Percy's glances, I cannot conscientiously
record that I found favour in his eyes. For one thing, I fear
he may not have recalled to his bosom a clarion sentiment (which
doubtless he had ofttimes cheered from his native gallery in softer
years): the honourable declaration that many an honest heart beats
beneath a poor man's coat. As for his own attire, he was even
as the lilies of Quesnay; that is to say, I beheld upon him the
same formation of tie that I had seen there, the same sensuous
beauty of the state waistcoat, though I think that his buttons
were, if anything, somewhat spicier than those which had awed
me at the chateau. And when we simultaneously reached the fragrant
hour of coffee, the cigarette case that glittered in his hand
was one for which some lady-friend of his (I knew intuitively)
must have given her All&mdash;and then been left in debt.</p>

<p>Amedee had served us both; Glouglou, as aforetime, attending
the silent "Grande Suite," where the curtains were once more tightly
drawn. Monsieur Rameau dined with his client in her own salon,
evidently; at least, Victorine, the femme de chambre, passed to
and from the kitchen in that direction, bearing laden trays. When
Mr. Percy's cigarette had been lighted, hesitation marked the
manner of our maitre d'hotel; plainly he wavered, but finally
old custom prevailed; abandoning the cigarette, he chose the cigar,
and, hastily clearing my fashionable opponent's table, approached
the pavilion with his most conversational face.</p>

<p>I greeted him indifferently, but with hidden pleasure, for my
soul (if Keredec is right and I have one) lay sorrowing. I needed
relief, and whatever else Amedee was, he was always that. I spoke
first:</p>

<p>"Amedee, how long a walk is it from Quesnay to Pere Baudry's?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur, about three-quarters of an hour for a good walker,
one might say."</p>

<p>"A long way for Jean Ferret to go for a cup of cider," I remarked
musingly.</p>

<p>"Eh? But why should he?" asked Amedee blankly.</p>

<p>"Why indeed? Surely even a Norman gardener lives for more than
cider! You usually meet him there about noon, I believe?"</p>

<p>Methought he had the grace to blush, though there is an everlasting
doubt in my mind that it may have been the colour of the candle-shade
producing that illusion. It was a strange thing to see, at all
events, and, taking it for a physiological fact at the time, I
let my willing eyes linger upon it as long as it (or its appearance)
was upon him.</p>

<p>"You were a little earlier than usual to-day," I continued finally,
full of the marvel.</p>

<p>"Monsieur?" He was wholly blank again.</p>

<p>"Weren't you there about eleven? Didn't you go about two hours
after Mr. Ward and his friends left here?"</p>

<p>He scratched his head. "I believe I had an errand in that direction.
Eh? Yes, I remember. Truly, I think it so happened."</p>

<p>"And you found Jean Ferret there?"</p>

<p>"Where, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"At Pere Baudry's."</p>

<p>"No, monsieur."</p>

<p>"What?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No, monsieur." He was firm, somewhat reproachful.</p>

<p>"You didn't see Jean Ferret this morning?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Amedee!"</p>

<p>"Eh, but I did not find him at Pere Baudry's! It may have happened
that I stopped there, but he did not come until some time after."</p>

<p>"After you had gone away from Pere Baudry's, you mean?"</p>

<p>"No, monsieur; after I arrived there. Truly."</p>

<p>"Now we have it! And you gave him the news of all that had happened
here?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur!"</p>

<p>A world&mdash;no, a constellation, a universe!&mdash;of reproach was in
the word.</p>

<p>"I retract the accusation," I said promptly. "I meant something
else."</p>

<p>"Upon everything that takes place at our hotel here, I am silent
to all the world."</p>

<p>"As the grave!" I said with enthusiasm. "Truly&mdash;that is a thing
well known. But Jean Ferret, then? He is not so discreet; I have
suspected that you are in his confidence. At times you have even
hinted as much. Can you tell me if he saw the automobile of Monsieur
Ingle when it came back to the chateau after leaving here?"</p>

<p>"It had arrived the moment before he departed."</p>

<p>"Quite SO! I understand," said I.</p>

<p>"He related to me that Mademoiselle Ward had the appearance of
agitation, and Madame d'Armand that of pallor, which was also
the case with Monsieur Ward."</p>

<p>"Therefore," I said, "Jean Ferret ran all the way to Pere Baudry's
to learn from you the reason for this agitation and this pallor?"</p>

<p>"But, monsieur&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I retract again!" I cut him off&mdash;to save time. "What other news
had he?"</p>

<p>There came a gleam into his small, infolded eyes, a tiny glitter
reflecting the mellow candle-light, but changing it, in that reflection,
to a cold and sinister point of steel. It should have warned me,
but, as he paused, I repeated my question.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, people say everything," he answered, frowning as if
deploring what they said in some secret, particular instance.
"The world is full of idle gossipers, tale-bearers, spreaders
of scandal! And, though I speak with perfect respect, all the
people at the chateau are not perfect in such ways."</p>

<p>"Do you mean the domestics?"</p>

<p>"The visitors!"</p>

<p>"What do they say?"</p>

<p>"Eh, well, then, they say&mdash;but no!" He contrived a masterly pretense
of pained reluctance. "I cannot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Speak out," I commanded, piqued by his shilly-shallying. "What
do they say?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur, it is about"&mdash;he shifted his weight from one leg to
the other&mdash;"it is about&mdash;about that beautiful Mademoiselle Elliott
who sometimes comes here."</p>

<p>This was so far from what I had expected that I was surprised
into a slight change of attitude, which all too plainly gratified
him, though he made an effort to conceal it. "Well," I said uneasily,
"what do they find to say of Mademoiselle Elliott?"</p>

<p>"They say that her painting is only a ruse to see monsieur."</p>

<p>"To see Monsieur Saffren, yes."</p>

<p>"But, no!" he cried. "That is not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," I assured him calmly. "As you know, Monsieur Saffren
is very, very handsome, and Mademoiselle Elliott, being a painter,
is naturally anxious to look at him from time to time."</p>

<p>"You are sure?" he said wistfully, even plaintively. "That is
not the meaning Jean Ferret put upon it."</p>

<p>"He was mistaken."</p>

<p>"It may be, it may be," he returned, greatly crestfallen, picking
up his tray and preparing to go. "But Jean Ferret was very positive."</p>

<p>"And I am even more so!"</p>

<p>"Then that malicious maid of Mademoiselle Ward's was mistaken
also," he sighed, "when she said that now a marriage is to take
place between Mademoiselle Ward and Monsieur Ingle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Proceed," I bade him.</p>

<p>He moved a few feet nearer the kitchen. "The malicious woman
said to Jean Ferret&mdash;" He paused and coughed. "It was in reference
to those Italian jewels monsieur used to send&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What about them?" I asked ominously.</p>

<p>"The woman says that Mademoiselle Ward&mdash;" he increased the distance
between us&mdash;"that now she should give them to Mademoiselle Elliott!
<em>GOOD </em>night, monsieur!"</p>

<p>His entrance into the kitchen was precipitate. I sank down again
into the wicker chair (from which I had hastily risen) and contemplated
the stars. But the short reverie into which I then fell was interrupted
by Mr. Percy, who, sauntering leisurely about the garden, paused
to address me.</p>

<p>"You folks thinks you was all to the gud, gittin' them trunks
off, what?"</p>

<p>"You speak in mysterious numbers," I returned, having no comprehension
of his meaning.</p>

<p>"I suppose you don' know nothin' about it," he laughed satirically.
"You didn' go over to Lisieux 'saft'noon to ship 'em? Oh, no,
not <em>YOU</em>!"</p>

<p>"I went for a long walk this afternoon, Mr. Percy. Naturally,
I couldn't have walked so far as Lisieux and back."</p>

<p>"Luk here, m'friend," he said sharply&mdash;"I reco'nise 'at you're
tryin' t' play your own hand, but I ast you as man to man: DO
you think you got any chanst t' git that feller off t' Paris?"</p>

<p>"DO you think it will rain to-night?" I inquired.</p>

<p>The light of a reflecting lamp which hung on the wall near the
archway enabled me to perceive a bitter frown upon his forehead.
"When a gen'leman asts a question AS a gen'leman," he said, his
voice expressing a noble pathos, "I can't see no call for no other
gen'leman to go an' play the smart Aleck and not answer him."</p>

<p>In simple dignity he turned his back upon me and strolled to
the other end of the courtyard, leaving me to the renewal of my
reverie.</p>

<p>It was not a happy one. My friends&mdash;old and new &mdash;I saw
inextricably caught in a tangle of cross-purposes, miserably and
hopelessly involved in a situation for which I could predict no
possible relief. I was able to understand now the beauty as well
as the madness of Keredec's plan; and I had told him so (after
the departure of the Quesnay party), asking his pardon for my
brusquerie of the morning. But the towering edifice his hopes
had erected was now tumbled about his ears: he had failed to elude
the Mursiana. There could be no doubt of her absolute control
of the situation. <em>THAT </em>was evident in the every step
of the youth now confidently parading before me.</p>

<p>Following his active stride with my eye, I observed him in the
act of saluting, with a gracious nod of his bare head, some one,
invisible to me, who was approaching from the road. Immediately
after&mdash;and altogether with the air of a person merely "happening
in"&mdash;a slight figure, clad in a long coat, a short skirt, and
a broad-brimmed, veil-bound brown hat, sauntered casually through
the archway and came into full view in the light of the reflector.</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet and started toward her, uttering an exclamation
which I was unable to stifle, though I tried to.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Percy," she said cheerily. "It's the most
<em>EXUBERANT </em>night. <em>YOU'RE </em>quite hearty, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Takin' a walk, I see, little lady," he observed with genial
patronage.</p>

<p>"Oh, not just for that," she returned. "It's more to see <em>HIM."
</em>She nodded to me, and, as I reached her, carelessly gave
me her left hand. "You know I'm studying with him," she continued
to Mr. Percy, exhibiting a sketch-book under her arm. "I dropped
over to get a criticism."</p>

<p>"Oh, drawin'-lessons?" said Mr. Percy tolerantly. "Well, don'
lemme interrup' ye."</p>

<p>He moved as if to withdraw toward the steps, but she detained
him with a question. "You're spending the rest of the summer here?"</p>

<p>"That depends," he answered tersely.</p>

<p>"I hear you have some <em>PASSIONATELY </em>interesting friends."</p>

<p>"Where did you hear that?"</p>

<p>"Ah, don't you know?" she responded commiseratingly. "This is
the most scandalously gossipy neighbourhood in France. My <em>DEAR
</em>young man, every one from here to Timbuctu knows all about
it by this time!"</p>

<p>"All about what?"</p>

<p>"About the excitement you're such a <em>VALUABLE </em>part of;
about your wonderful Spanish friend and how she claims the strange
young man here for her husband."</p>

<p>"They'll know more'n that, I expec'," he returned with a side
glance at me, "before <em>VERY </em>long."</p>

<p>"Every one thinks <em>I</em> am so interesting," she rattled
on artlessly, "because I happened to meet <em>YOU </em>in the
woods. I've held quite a levee all day. In a reflected way it
makes a heroine of me, you see, because you are one of the very
<em>MOST </em>prominent figures in it all. I hope you won't think
I've been too bold," she pursued anxiously, "in claiming that
I really am one of your acquaintances?"</p>

<p>"That'll be all right," he politely assured her.</p>

<p>"I am so glad." Her laughter rang out gaily. "Because I've been
talking about you as if we were the <em>OLDEST </em>friends, and
I'd hate to have them find me out. I've told them everything&mdash;about
your appearance you see, and how your hair was parted, and how
you were dressed, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Luk here," he interrupted, suddenly discharging his Bowery laugh,
"did you tell 'em how HE was dressed?" He pointed a jocular finger
at me. "That <em>WUD '</em>a' made a hit!"</p>

<p>"No; we weren't talking of him."</p>

<p>"Why not? He's in it, too. Bullieve me, he <em>THINKS </em>he
is!"</p>

<p>"In the excitement, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Right!" said Mr. Percy amiably. "He goes round holdin' Rip Van
Winkle Keredec's hand when the ole man's cryin'; helpin' him sneak
his trunks off t' Paris&mdash;playin' the hired man gener'ly. Oh, he
thinks he's quite the boy, in this trouble!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's a small part," she returned, "compared to yours."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hold my end up, I guess."</p>

<p>"I should think you'd be so worn out and sleepy you couldn't
hold your head up!"</p>

<p>"Who? ME? Not t'-night, m'little friend. I tuk MY sleep's aft'noon
and let Rameau do the Sherlock a little while."</p>

<p>She gazed upon him with unconcealed admiration. "You are wonderful,"
she sighed faintly, and "<em>WONDERFUL!" </em>she breathed again.
"How prosaic are drawing-lessons," she continued, touching my
arm and moving with me toward the pavilion, "after listening to
a man of action like that!"</p>

<p>Mr. Percy, establishing himself comfortably in a garden chair
at the foot of the gallery steps, was heard to utter a short cough
as he renewed the light of his cigarette.</p>

<p>My visitor paused upon my veranda, humming, "Quand l'Amour Meurt"
while I went within and lit a lamp. "Shall I bring the light out
there?" I asked, but, turning, found that she was already in the
room.</p>

<p>"The sketch-book is my duenna," she said, sinking into a chair
upon one side of the centre table, upon which I placed the lamp.
"Lessons are unquestionable, at any place or time. Behold the
beautiful posies!" She spread the book open on the table between
us, as I seated myself opposite her, revealing some antique coloured
smudges of flowers. "Elegancies of Eighteen-Forty! Isn't that
a survival of the period when young ladies had 'accomplishments,'
though! I found it at the chateau and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind," I said. "Don't you know that you can't ramble over
the country alone at this time of night?"</p>

<p>"If you speak any louder," she said, with some urgency of manner,
"you'll be 'hopelessly compromised socially,' as Mrs. Alderman
McGinnis and the Duchess of Gwythyl-Corners say"&mdash;she directed
my glance, by one of her own, through the open door to Mr. Percy&mdash;"because
HE'LL hear you and know that the sketch-book was only a shallow
pretext of mine to see you. Do be a little manfully self-contained,
or you'll get us talked about! And as for 'this time of night,'
I believe it's almost half past nine."</p>

<p>"Does Miss Ward know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think it likely? One of the most convenient things about
a chateau is the number of ways to get out of it without being
seen. I had a choice of eight. So I 'suffered fearfully from neuralgia,'
dined in my own room, and sped through the woods to my honest
forester." She nodded brightly. "That's <em>YOU</em>!"</p>

<p>"You weren't afraid to come through the woods alone?" I asked,
uncomfortably conscious that her gaiety met a dull response from
me.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But if Miss Ward finds that you're not at the chateau&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She won't; she thinks I'm asleep. She brought me up a sleeping-powder
herself."</p>

<p>"She thinks you took it?"</p>

<p>"She <em>KNOWS I </em>did," said Miss Elliott. "I'm full of it!
And that will be the reason&mdash;if you notice that I'm particularly
nervous or excited."</p>

<p>"You seem all of that," I said, looking at her eyes, which were
very wide and very brilliant. "However, I believe you always do."</p>

<p>"Ah!" she smiled. "I knew you thought me atrocious from the first.
You find <em>MYRIADS </em>of objections to me, don't you?"</p>

<p>I had forgotten to look away from her eyes, and I kept on forgetting.
(The same thing had happened several times lately; and each time,
by a somewhat painful coincidence, I remembered my age at precisely
the instant I remembered to look away.) "Dazzling" is a good old-fashioned
word for eyes like hers; at least it might define their effect
on me.</p>

<p>"If I did manage to object to you," I said slowly, "it would
be a good thing for me&mdash;wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've <em>WON!" </em>she cried.</p>

<p>"Won?" I echoed.</p>

<p>"Yes. I laid a wager with myself that I'd have a pretty speech
from you before I went out of your life"&mdash;she checked a laugh,
and concluded thrillingly&mdash;"forever! I leave Quesnay to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"Your father has returned from America?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear, no," she murmured. "I'll be quite at the world's mercy.
I must go up to Paris and retire from public life until he does
come. I shall take the vows&mdash;in some obscure but respectable pension."</p>

<p>"You can't endure the life at the chateau any longer?"</p>

<p>"It won't endure ME any longer. If I shouldn't go to-morrow I'd
be put out, I think&mdash;after to-night!"</p>

<p>"But you intimated that no one would know about to-night!"</p>

<p>"The night isn't over yet," she replied enigmatically.</p>

<p>"It almost is&mdash;for you," I said; "because in ten minutes I shall
take you back to the chateau gates."</p>

<p>She offered no comment on this prophecy, but gazed at me thoughtfully
and seriously for several moments. "I suppose you can imagine,"
she said, in a tone that threatened to become tremulous, "what
sort of an afternoon we've been having up there?"</p>

<p>"Has it been&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"Oh, heart-breaking! Louise came to my room as soon as they got
back from here, this morning, and told me the whole pitiful story.
But they didn't let her stay there long, poor woman!"</p>

<p>"They?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, Elizabeth and her brother. They've been at her all afternoon&mdash;off
and on."</p>

<p>"To do what?"</p>

<p>"To 'save herself,' so they call it. They're insisting that she
must not see her poor husband again. They're <em>DETERMINED </em>she
sha'n't."</p>

<p>"But George wouldn't worry her," I objected.</p>

<p>"Oh, wouldn't he?" The girl laughed sadly. "I don't suppose he
could help it, he's in such a state himself, but between him and
Elizabeth it's hard to see how poor Mrs. Harman lived through
the day."</p>

<p>"Well," I said slowly, "I don't see that they're not right. She
ought to be kept out of all this as much as possible; and if her
husband has to go through a trial&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want you to tell me something," Miss Elliott interrupted.
"How much do you like Mr. Ward?"</p>

<p>"He's an old friend. I suppose I like my old friends in about
the same way that other people like theirs."</p>

<p>"How much do you like Mr. Saffren &mdash;I mean Mr. Harman?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>THAT!" I </em>groaned. "If I could still call him 'Oliver
Saffren,' if I could still think of him as 'Oliver Saffren,' it
would be easy to answer. I never was so 'drawn' to a man in my
life before. But when I think of him as Larrabee Harman, I am
full of misgivings."</p>

<p>"Louise isn't," she put in eagerly, and with something oddly
like the manner of argument. "His wife isn't!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know. Perhaps one reason is that she never saw him at
quite his worst. I did. I had only two glimpses of him&mdash;of the
briefest&mdash;but they inspired me with such a depth of dislike that
I can't tell you how painful it was to discover that 'Oliver Saffren'&mdash;this
strange, pathetic, attractive <em>FRIEND </em>of mine&mdash;is the
same man."</p>

<p>"Oh, but he isn't!" she exclaimed quickly.</p>

<p>"Keredec says he is," I laughed helplessly.</p>

<p>"So does Louise," returned Miss Elliott, disdaining consistency
in her eagerness. "And she's right&mdash;and she cares more for him
than she ever did!"</p>

<p>"I suppose she does."</p>

<p>"Are you&mdash;" the girl began, then stopped for a moment, looking
at me steadily. "Aren't you a little in love with her?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered honestly. "Aren't you?"</p>

<p>"<em>THAT'S </em>what I wanted to know!" she said; and as she
turned a page in the sketch-book for the benefit of Mr. Percy,
I saw that her hand had begun to tremble.</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked, leaning toward her across the table.</p>

<p>"Because, if she were involved in some undertaking&mdash;something
that, if it went wrong, would endanger her happiness and, I think,
even her life&mdash;for it might actually kill her if she failed, and
brought on a worse catastrophe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" I said anxiously, as she paused again.</p>

<p>"You'd help her?" she said.</p>

<p>"I would indeed," I assented earnestly. "I told her once I'd
do anything in the world for her."</p>

<p>"Even if it involved something that George Ward might never forgive
you for?"</p>

<p>"I said, 'anything in the world,'" I returned, perhaps a little
huskily. "I meant all of that. If there is anything she wants
me to do, I shall do it."</p>

<p>She gave a low cry of triumph, but immediately checked it. Then
she leaned far over the table, her face close above the book,
and, tracing the outline of an uncertain lily with her small,
brown-gloved forefinger, as though she were consulting me on the
drawing, "I wasn't afraid to come through the woods alone," she
said, in a very low voice, "because I wasn't alone. Louise came
with me."</p>

<p>"What?" I gasped. "Where is she?"</p>

<p>"At the Baudry cottage down the road. They won't miss her at
the chateau until morning; I locked her door on the outside, and
if they go to bother her again&mdash;though I don't think they will&mdash;they'll
believe she's fastened it on the inside and is asleep. She managed
to get a note to Keredec late this afternoon; it explained everything,
and he had some trunks carried out the rear gate of the inn and
carted over to Lisieux to be shipped to Paris from there. It is
to be supposed&mdash;or hoped, at least&mdash;that this woman and her people
will believe <em>THAT </em>means Professor Keredec and Mr. Harman
will try to get to Paris in the same way."</p>

<p>"So," I said, "that's what Percy meant about the trunks. I didn't
understand."</p>

<p>"He's on watch, you see," she continued, turning a page to another
drawing. "He means to sit up all night, or he wouldn't have slept
this afternoon. He's not precisely the kind to be in the habit
of afternoon naps &mdash;Mr. Percy!" She laughed nervously. "That's
why it's almost absolutely necessary for us to have you. If we
have&mdash;the thing is so simple that it's certain."</p>

<p>"If you have me for what?" I asked.</p>

<p>"If you'll help"&mdash;and, as she looked up, her eyes, now very close
to mine, were dazzling indeed&mdash;"I'll adore you for ever and ever!
Oh, <em>MUCH </em>longer than you'd like me to!"</p>

<p>"You mean she's going to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean that she's going to run away with him again," she whispered.</p>
