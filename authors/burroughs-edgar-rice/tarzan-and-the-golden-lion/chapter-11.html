<p>AS Tarzan carried the dead Bolgani from the village of the Gomangani, he
set his steps in the direction of the building he had seen from the rim
of the valley, the curiosity of the man overcoming the natural caution
of the beast. He was traveling up wind and the odors wafted down to his
nostrils told him that he was approaching the habitat of the Bolgani.
Intermingled with the scent spoor of the gorilla-men was that of
Gomangani and the odor of cooked food, and the suggestion of a heavily
sweet scent, which the ape-man could connect only with burning incense,
though it seemed impossible that such a fragrance could emanate from the
dwellings of the Bolgani. Perhaps it came from the great edifice he had
seen—a building which must have been constructed by human beings, and
in which human beings might still dwell, though never among the
multitudinous odors that assailed his nostrils did he once catch the
faintest suggestion of the man scent of whites.
</p>
<p>When he perceived from the increasing strength of their odor, that he
was approaching close to the Bolgani, Tarzan took to the trees with his
burden, that he might thus stand a better chance of avoiding discovery,
and presently, through the foliage ahead, he saw a lofty wall, and,
beyond, the outlines of the weird architecture of a strange and
mysterious pile—outlines that suggested a building of another world, so
unearthly were they, and from beyond the wall came the odor of the
Bolgani and the fragrance of the incense, intermingled with the scent
spoor of Numa, the lion. The jungle was cleared away for fifty feet
outside the wall surrounding the building, so that there was no tree
overhanging the wall, but Tarzan approached as closely as he could,
while still remaining reasonably well concealed by the foliage. He had
chosen a point at a sufficient height above the ground to permit him to
see over the top of the wall.
</p><p>The building within the enclosure was of great size, its different parts
appearing to have been constructed at various periods, and each with
utter disregard to uniformity, resulting in a conglomeration of
connecting buildings and towers, no two of which were alike, though the
whole presented a rather pleasing, if somewhat bizarre appearance. The
building stood upon an artificial elevation about ten feet high,
surrounded by a retaining wall of granite, a wide staircase leading to
the ground level below. About the building were shrubbery and trees,
some of the latter appearing to be of great antiquity, while one
enormous tower was almost entirely covered by ivy. By far the most
remarkable feature of the building, however, lay in its rich and
barbaric ornamentation. Set into the polished granite of which it was
composed was an intricate mosaic of gold and diamonds; glittering stones
in countless thousands scintillated from façades, minarets, domes, and
towers.
</p><p>The enclosure, which comprised some fifteen or twenty acres, was
occupied for the most part by the building. The terrace upon which it
stood was devoted to walks, flowers, shrubs, and ornamental trees, while
that part of the area below, which was within the range of Tarzan’s
vision, seemed to be given over to the raising of garden truck. In the
garden and upon the terrace were naked blacks, such as he had seen in
the village where he had left La. There were both men and women, and
these were occupied with the care of growing things within the
enclosure. Among them were several of the gorilla-like creatures such as
Tarzan had slain in the village, but these performed no labor, devoting
themselves, rather, it seemed, to directing the work of the blacks,
toward whom their manner was haughty and domineering, sometimes even
brutal. These gorilla-men were trapped in rich ornaments, similar to
those upon the body which now rested in a crotch of the tree behind the
ape-man.
</p><p>As Tarzan watched with interest the scene below him, two Bolgani emerged
from the main entrance, a huge portal, some thirty feet in width, and
perhaps fifteen feet high. The two wore head-bands, supporting tall,
white feathers. As they emerged they took post on either side of the
entrance, and cupping their hands before their mouths gave voice to a
series of shrill cries that bore a marked resemblance to trumpet calls.
Immediately the blacks ceased work and hastened to the foot of the
stairs descending from the terrace to the garden. Here they formed lines
on either side of the stairway, and similarly the Bolgani formed two
lines upon the terrace from the main portal to the stairway, forming a
living aisle from one to the other. Presently from the interior of the
building came other trumpet-like calls, and a moment later Tarzan saw
the head of a procession emerging. First came four Bolgani abreast, each
bedecked with an ornate feather headdress, and each carrying a huge
bludgeon erect before him. Behind these came two trumpeters, and twenty
feet behind the trumpeters paced a huge, black-maned lion, held in leash
by four sturdy blacks, two upon either side, holding what appeared to be
golden chains that ran to a scintillant diamond collar about the beast’s
neck. Behind the lion marched twenty more Bolgani, four abreast. These
carried spears, but whether they were for the purpose of protecting the
lion from the people or the people from the lion Tarzan was at a loss to
know.
</p><p>The attitude of the Bolgani lining either side of the way between the
portal and the stairway indicated extreme deference, for they bent their
bodies from their waists in a profound bow while Numa was passing
between their lines. When the beast reached the top of the stairway the
procession halted, and immediately the Gomangani ranged below prostrated
themselves and placed their foreheads on the ground. Numa, who was
evidently an old lion, stood with lordly mien surveying the prostrate
humans before him. His evil eyes glared glassily, the while he bared his
tusks in a savage grimace, and from his deep lungs rumbled forth an
ominous roar, at the sound of which the Gomangani trembled in unfeigned
terror. The ape-man knit his brows in thought. Never before had he been
called upon to witness so remarkable a scene of the abasement of man
before a beast. Presently the procession continued upon its way
descending the staircase and turning to the right along a path through
the garden, and when it had passed them the Gomangani and the Bolgani
arose and resumed their interrupted duties.
</p><p>Tarzan remained in his concealment watching them, trying to discover
some explanation for the strange, paradoxical conditions that he had
witnessed. The lion, with his retinue, had turned the far corner of the
palace and disappeared from sight. What was he to these people, to these
strange creatures? What did he represent? Why this topsy-turvy
arrangement of species? Here man ranked lower than the half-beast, and
above all, from the deference that had been accorded him, stood a true
beast—a savage carnivore.
</p><p>He had been occupied with his thoughts and his observations for some
fifteen minutes following the disappearance of Numa around the eastern
end of the palace, when his attention was attracted to the opposite end
of the structure by the sound of other shrill trumpet calls. Turning his
eyes in that direction, he saw the procession emerging again into view,
and proceeding toward the staircase down which they had entered the
garden. Immediately the notes of the shrill call sounded upon their ears
the Gomangani and the Bolgani resumed their original positions from
below the foot of the staircase to the entrance to the palace, and once
again was homage paid to Numa as he made his triumphal entry into the
building.
</p><p>Tarzan of the Apes ran his fingers through his mass of tousled hair, but
finally he was forced to shake his head in defeat—he could find no
explanation whatsoever for all that he had witnessed. His curiosity,
however, was so keenly piqued that he determined to investigate the
palace and surrounding grounds further before continuing on his way in
search of a trail out of the valley.
</p><p>Leaving the body of Bolgani where he had cached it, he started slowly to
circle the building that he might examine it from all sides from the
concealing foliage of the surrounding forest. He found the architecture
equally unique upon all sides, and that the garden extended entirely
around the building, though a portion upon the south side of the palace
was given over to corrals and pens in which were kept numerous goats and
a considerable flock of chickens. Upon this side, also, were several
hundred swinging, beehive huts, such as he had seen in the native
village of the Gomangani. These he took to be the quarters of the black
slaves, who performed all the arduous and menial labor connected with
the palace.
</p><p>The lofty granite wall which surrounded the entire enclosure was pierced
by but a single gate which opened opposite the east end of the palace.
This gate was large and of massive construction, appearing to have been
built to withstand the assault of numerous and well-armed forces. So
strong did it appear that the ape-man could not but harbor the opinion
that it had been constructed to protect the interior against forces
equipped with heavy battering rams. That such a force had ever existed
within the vicinity in historic times seemed most unlikely, and Tarzan
conjectured, therefore, that the wall and the gate were of almost
unthinkable antiquity, dating, doubtless, from the forgotten age of the
Atlantians, and constructed, perhaps, to protect the builders of the
Palace of Diamonds from the well-armed forces that had come from
Atlantis to work the gold mines of Opar and to colonize central Africa.
</p><p>While the wall, the gate, and the palace itself, suggested in many ways
almost unbelievable age, yet they were in such an excellent state of
repair that it was evident that they were still inhabited by rational
and intelligent creatures; while upon the south side Tarzan had seen a
new tower in process of construction, where a number of blacks working
under the direction of Bolgani were cutting and shaping granite blocks
and putting them in place.
</p><p>Tarzan had halted in a tree near the east gate to watch the life passing
in and out of the palace grounds beneath the ancient portal, and as he
watched, a long cavalcade of powerful Gomangani emerged from the forest
and entered the enclosure. Swung in hides between two poles, this party
was carrying rough-hewn blocks of granite, four men to a block. Two or
three Bolgani accompanied the long line of carriers, which was preceded
and followed by a detachment of black warriors, armed with battle-axes
and spears. The demeanor and attitude of the black porters, as well as
of the Bolgani, suggested to the ape-man nothing more nor less than a
caravan of donkeys, plodding their stupid way at the behest of their
drivers. If one lagged he was prodded with the point of a spear or
struck with its haft. There was no greater brutality shown than in the
ordinary handling of beasts of burden the world around, nor in the
demeanor of the blacks was there any more indication of objection or
revolt than you see depicted upon the faces of a long line of
burden-bearing mules; to all intents and purposes they were dumb, driven
cattle. Slowly they filed through the gateway and disappeared from
sight.
</p><p>A few moments later another party came out of the forest and passed into
the palace grounds. This consisted of fully fifty armed Bolgani and
twice as many black warriors with spears and axes. Entirely surrounded
by these armed creatures were four brawny porters, carrying a small
litter, upon which was fastened an ornate chest about two feet wide by
four feet long, with a depth of approximately two feet. The chest itself
was of some dark, weather-worn wood, and was reinforced by bands and
corners of what appeared to be virgin gold in which were set many
diamonds. What the chest contained Tarzan could not, of course,
conceive, but that it was considered of great value was evidenced by the
precautions for safety with which it had been surrounded. The chest was
borne directly into the huge, ivy-covered tower at the northeast corner
of the palace, the entrance to which, Tarzan now first observed, was
secured by doors as large and heavy as the east gate itself.
</p><p>At the first opportunity that he could seize to accomplish it
undiscovered, Tarzan swung across the jungle trail and continued through
the trees to that one in which he had left the body of the Bolgani.
Throwing this across his shoulder he returned to a point close above the
trail near the east gate, and seizing upon a moment when there was a
lull in the traffic he hurled the body as close to the portal as
possible.
</p><p>“Now,” thought the ape-man, “let them guess who slew their fellow if
they can.”
</p><p>Making his way toward the southeast, Tarzan approached the mountains
which lie back of the Valley of the Palace of Diamonds. He had often to
make detours to avoid native villages and to keep out of sight of the
numerous parties of Bolgani that seemed to be moving in all directions
through the forest. Late in the afternoon he came out of the hills into
full view of the mountains beyond—rough, granite hills they were, whose
precipitous peaks arose far above the timber line. Directly before him a
well-marked trail led into a canyon, which he could see wound far upward
toward the summit. This, then, would be as good a place to commence his
investigations as another. And so, seeing that the coast was clear, the
ape-man descended from the trees, and taking advantage of the underbrush
bordering the trail, made his way silently, yet swiftly, into the hills.
For the most part he was compelled to worm his way through thickets, for
the trail was in constant use by Gomangani and Bolgani, parties passing
up it empty-handed and, returning, bearing blocks of granite. As he
advanced more deeply into the hills the heavy underbrush gave way to a
lighter growth of scrub, through which he could pass with far greater
ease though with considerable more risk of discovery. However, the
instinct of the beast that dominated Tarzan’s jungle craft permitted him
to find cover where another would have been in full view of every enemy.
Half way up the mountain the trail passed through a narrow gorge, not
more than twenty feet wide and eroded from solid granite cliffs. Here
there was no concealment whatsoever, and the ape-man realized that to
enter it would mean almost immediate discovery. Glancing about, he saw
that by making a slight detour he could reach the summit of the gorge,
where, amid tumbled, granite boulders and stunted trees and shrubs, he
knew that he could find sufficient concealment, and perhaps a plainer
view of the trail beyond.
</p><p>Nor was he mistaken, for, when he had reached a vantage point far above
the trail, he saw ahead an open pocket in the mountain, the cliffs
surrounding which were honeycombed with numerous openings, which, it
seemed to Tarzan, could be naught else than the mouths of tunnels. Rough
wooden ladders reached to some of them, closer to the base of the
cliffs, while from others knotted ropes dangled to the ground below. Out
of these tunnels emerged men carrying little sacks of earth, which they
dumped in a common pile beside a rivulet which ran through the gorge.
Here other blacks, supervised by Bolgani, were engaged in washing the
dirt, but what they hoped to find or what they did find, Tarzan could
not guess.
</p><p>Along one side of the rocky basin many other blacks were engaged in
quarrying the granite from the cliffs, which had been cut away through
similar operations into a series of terraces running from the floor of
the basin to the summit of the cliff. Here naked blacks toiled with
primitive tools under the supervision of savage Bolgani. The activities
of the quarrymen were obvious enough, but what the others were bringing
from the mouths of the tunnels Tarzan could not be positive, though the
natural assumption was that it was gold. Where, then, did they obtain
their diamonds? Certainly not from these solid granite cliffs.
</p><p>A few minutes’ observation convinced Tarzan that the trail he had
followed from the forest ended in this little cul-de-sac, and so he
sought a way upward and around it, in search of a pass across the range.
</p><p>The balance of that day and nearly all the next he devoted to his
efforts in this direction, only in the end to be forced to admit that
there was no egress from the valley upon this side. To points far above
the timber line he made his way, but there, always, he came face to face
with sheer, perpendicular cliffs of granite towering high above him,
upon the face of which not even the ape-man could find foothold. Along
the southern and eastern sides of the basin he carried his
investigation, but with similar disappointing results, and then at last
he turned his steps back toward the forest with the intention of seeking
a way out through the valley of Opar with La, after darkness had fallen.
</p><p>The sun had just risen when Tarzan arrived at the native village in
which he had left La, and no sooner did his eyes rest upon it than he
became apprehensive that something was amiss, for, not only was the gate
wide open but there was no sign of life within the palisade, nor was
there any movement of the swinging huts that would indicate that they
were occupied. Always wary of ambush, Tarzan reconnoitered carefully
before descending into the village. To his trained observation it became
evident that the village had been deserted for at least twenty-four
hours. Running to the hut in which La had been hidden he hastily
ascended the rope and examined the interior—it was vacant, nor was
there any sign of the High Priestess. Descending to the ground, the
ape-man started to make a thorough investigation of the village in
search of clews to the fate of its inhabitants and of La. He had
examined the interiors of several huts when his keen eyes noted a slight
movement of one of the swinging, cage-like habitations some distance
from him. Quickly he crossed the intervening space, and as he approached
the hut he saw that no rope trailed from its doorway. Halting beneath,
Tarzan raised his face to the aperture, through which nothing but the
roof of the hut was visible.
</p><p>“Gomangani,” he cried, “it is I, Tarzan of the Apes. Come to the opening
and tell me what has become of your fellows and of my mate, whom I left
here under the protection of your warriors.”
</p><p>There was no answer, and again Tarzan called, for he was positive that
someone was hiding in the hut.
</p><p>“Come down,” he called again, “or I will come up after you.”
</p><p>Still there was no reply. A grim smile touched the ape-man’s lips as he
drew his hunting knife from its sheath and placed it between his teeth,
and then, with a cat-like spring, leaped for the opening, and catching
its sides, drew his body up into the interior of the hut.
</p><p>If he had expected opposition, he met with none, nor in the dimly
lighted interior could he at first distinguish any presence, though,
when his eyes became accustomed to the semi-darkness, he descried a
bundle of leaves and grasses lying against the opposite wall of the
structure. Crossing to these he tore them aside revealing the huddled
form of a terrified woman. Seizing her by a shoulder he drew her to a
sitting position.
</p><p>“What has happened?” he demanded. “Where are the villagers? Where is my
mate?”
</p><p>“Do not kill me! Do not kill me!” she cried. “It was not I. It was not
my fault.”
</p><p>“I do not intend to kill you,” replied Tarzan. “Tell me the truth and
you shall be safe.”
</p><p>“The Bolgani have taken them away,” cried the woman. “They came when the
sun was low upon the day that you arrived, and they were very angry, for
they had found the body of their fellow outside the gate of the Palace
of Diamonds. They knew that he had come here to our village, and no one
had seen him alive since he had departed from the palace. They came,
then, and threatened and tortured our people, until at last the warriors
told them all. I hid. I do not know why they did not find me. But at
last they went away, taking all the others with them; taking your mate,
too. They will never come back.”
</p><p>“You think that the Bolgani will kill them?” asked Tarzan.
</p><p>“Yes,” she replied, “they kill all who displease them.”
</p><p>Alone, now, and relieved of the responsibility of La, Tarzan might
easily make his way by night through the valley of Opar and to safety
beyond the barrier. But perhaps such a thought never entered his head.
Gratitude and loyalty were marked characteristics of the ape-man. La had
saved him from the fanaticism and intrigue of her people. She had saved
him at a cost of all that was most dear to her, power and position,
peace and safety. She had jeopardized her life for him, and become an
exile from her own country. The mere fact then that the Bolgani had
taken her with the possible intention of slaying her, was not sufficient
for the ape-man. He must know whether or not she lived, and if she lived
he must devote his every energy to winning her release and her eventual
escape from the dangers of this valley.
</p><p>Tarzan spent the day reconnoitering outside the palace grounds, seeking
an opportunity of gaining entrance without detection, but this he found
impossible inasmuch as there was never a moment that there were not
Gomangani or Bolgani in the outer garden. But with the approach of
darkness the great east gate was closed, and the inmates of the huts and
palace withdrew within their walls, leaving not even a single sentinel
without—a fact that indicated clearly that the Bolgani had no reason to
apprehend an attack. The subjugation of the Gomangani, then, was
apparently complete, and so the towering wall surrounding their palace,
which was more than sufficient to protect them from the inroads of
lions, was but the reminder of an ancient day when a once-powerful, but
now vanished, enemy threatened their peace and safety.
</p><p>When darkness had finally settled Tarzan approached the gate, and
throwing the noose of his grass rope over one of the carved lions that
capped the gate posts, ascended quickly to the summit of the wall, from
where he dropped lightly into the garden below. To insure an avenue for
quick escape in the event that he found La, he unlatched the heavy gates
and swung them open. Then he crept stealthily toward the ivy-covered
east tower, which he had chosen after a day of investigation as offering
easiest ingress to the palace. The success of his plan hinged largely
upon the age and strength of the ivy which grew almost to the summit of
the tower, and, to his immense relief, he found that it would easily
support his weight.
</p><p>Far above the ground, near the summit of the tower, he had seen from the
trees surrounding the palace an open window, which, unlike the balance
of those in this part of the palace, was without bars. Dim lights shone
from several of the tower windows, as from those of other parts of the
palace. Avoiding these lighted apertures, Tarzan ascended quickly,
though carefully, toward the unbarred window above, and as he reached it
and cautiously raised his eyes above the level of the sill, he was
delighted to find that it opened into an unlighted chamber, the interior
of which, however, was so shrouded in darkness that he could discern
nothing within. Drawing himself carefully to the level of the sill he
crept quietly into the apartment beyond. Groping through the blackness,
he cautiously made the rounds of the room, which he found to contain a
carved bedstead of peculiar design, a table, and a couple of benches.
Upon the bedstead were stuffs of woven material, thrown over the softly
tanned pelts of antelopes and leopards.
</p><p>Opposite the window through which he had entered was a closed door. This
he opened slowly and silently, until, through a tiny aperture he could
look out upon a dimly lighted corridor or circular hallway, in the
center of which was an opening about four feet in diameter, passing
through which and disappearing beyond a similar opening in the ceiling
directly above was a straight pole with short crosspieces fastened to it
at intervals of about a foot—quite evidently the primitive staircase
which gave communication between the various floors of the tower. Three
upright columns, set at equal intervals about the circumference of the
circular opening in the center of the floor helped to support the
ceiling above. Around the outside of this circular hallway there were
other doors, similar to that opening into the apartment in which he was.
</p><p>Hearing no noise and seeing no evidence of another than himself, Tarzan
opened the door and stepped into the hallway. His nostrils were now
assailed strongly by the same heavy fragrance of incense that had first
greeted him upon his approach to the palace several days before. In the
interior of the tower, however, it was much more powerful, practically
obliterating all other odors, and placing upon the ape-man an almost
prohibitive handicap in his search for La. In fact as he viewed the
doors upon this single stage of the tower, he was filled with
consternation at the prospect of the well-nigh impossible task that
confronted him. To search this great tower alone, without any assistance
whatever from his keen sense of scent, seemed impossible of
accomplishment, if he were to take even the most ordinary precautions
against detection.
</p><p>The ape-man’s self-confidence was in no measure blundering egotism.
Knowing his limitations, he knew that he would have little or no chance
against even a few Bolgani were he to be discovered within their palace,
where all was familiar to them and strange to him. Behind him was the
open window, and the silent jungle night, and freedom. Ahead danger,
predestined failure; and, quite likely, death. Which should he choose?
For a moment he stood in silent thought, and then, raising his head and
squaring his great shoulders, he shook his black locks defiantly and
stepped boldly toward the nearest door. Room after room he had
investigated until he had made the entire circle of the landing, but in
so far as La or any clew to her were concerned his search was fruitless.
He found quaint furniture and rugs and tapestries, and ornaments of gold
and diamonds, and in one dimly lighted chamber he came upon a sleeping
Bolgani, but so silent were the movements of the ape-man that the
sleeper slept on undisturbed, even though Tarzan passed entirely around
his bed, which was set in the center of the chamber, and investigated a
curtained alcove beyond.
</p><p>Having completed the rounds of this floor, Tarzan determined to work
upward first and then, returning, investigate the lower stages later.
Pursuant to this plan, therefore, he ascended the strange stairway.
Three landings he passed before he reached the upper floor of the tower.
Circling each floor was a ring of doors, all of which were closed, while
dimly lighting each landing were feebly burning cressets—shallow,
golden bowls—containing what appeared to be tallow, in which floated a
tow-like wick.
</p><p>Upon the upper landing there were but three doors, all of which were
closed. The ceiling of this hallway was the dome-like roof of the tower,
in the center of which was another circular opening, through which the
stairway protruded into the darkness of the night above.
</p><p>As Tarzan opened the door nearest him it creaked upon its hinges, giving
forth the first audible sound that had resulted from his investigations
up to this point. The interior of the apartment before him was
unlighted, and as Tarzan stood there in the entrance in statuesque
silence for a few seconds following the creaking of the hinge, he was
suddenly aware of movement—of the faintest shadow of a sound—behind
him. Wheeling quickly he saw the figure of a man standing in an open
doorway upon the opposite side of the landing.
