<p>An ejaculation of thankfulness escaped Fred Linden when he found
himself floating in the comparatively still water below the rapids,
and he knew that although he was pretty well bruised, none of
his bones was broken. He let go of the limb of the tree that had
served him so well, and flirting the water from his eyes, struck
out with his old time vigor for the shore, toward which he had
started in the canoe.</p>

<p>When Terry Clark saw his friend go spinning into the whirlpool,
he scrambled back from the trunk of the tree, on which he had
found refuge, and ran at full speed down the bank. Fast as he
went, he was just in time to see Fred swimming through the foaming
waters toward the land.</p>

<p>"Give me yer hand!" called out the delighted youngster; "there
isn't any body in the wide wurruld that could bate that onless
it is mesilf, and I couldn't do it."</p>

<p>"Whew!" exclaimed Fred, as he laboriously clambered up the steep
bank; "that was the biggest lot of swimming and diving crowded
into the space of a minute or two that I ever knew; I wouldn't
like to take such a trip each day."</p>

<p>"And I'm thinkin' that it'll be a few days after this whin we
try it agin," added Terry, delighted to see his loved comrade
before him unharmed; "I jist give up when I seen you plunge in
among the rocks, and was wonderin' how your father and mother
and sister Edith would faal when I should be luggin' your dead
body home."</p>

<p>"I'm thankful that you haven't <em>that</em> to do," said Fred
with an earnestness that could not be mistaken; "but come, the
clothes of us both are dripping, and we can't get away any too
soon."</p>

<p>It was not far to walk, and a few minutes later they reached
the other side of the clearing, where the cluster of cabins stood.
The first living object on which their eyes rested was Brindle,
lying on the ground and chewing her cud with an air of contentment
which belongs exclusively to her kind, or rather kine.</p>

<p>The boys laughed and Terry said:</p>

<p>"If she had such a thing as conscience she wouldn't be takin'
things in that aisy style, after givin' us a duckin' that come
nigh bein' our last one."</p>

<p>"You are right, Terry, but what did you do with that bell that
Deerfoot took away from the Winnebago?"</p>

<p>"I lift it wid my gun on the other side of the creek; I didn't
want it tollin' our funeral knell all the time we was goin' through
the rapids and splittin' the rocks to pieces by bangin' our heads
agin them."</p>

<p>"It is just as well, for the creek will be so low that there
will be no danger in crossing it to-morrow, and you can get the
bell again; well, here we are at home."</p>

<p>The boys separated, and at the same moment, each entered the
cabin where he lived. They were only a short distance apart. Several
men and a number of the lads, some older and some younger than
the two in whom we are interested, were moving about, and looked
curiously at the dripping figures. A couple asked an explanation
of Fred, but he laughingly answered that he would tell them after
he had got dry, and immediately disappeared in his own house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Linden and Edith, her daughter, who was two years younger
than Fred, looked up in surprise when they saw the state of the
lad.</p>

<p>"Terry and I started to paddle across the creek, that is higher
than usual, and were overturned by a tree that stove in the side
of the boat and gave us a ducking."</p>

<p>Having heard this explanation his folks seemed to feel no more
curiosity about it. The lad passed into his room, he being one
of those fortunate ones who had two complete suits of clothing,
with the exception of cap and shoes. It took him but a short time
to effect the change, when he reappeared, placing his foot and
head gear near the fire, where they would soon dry.</p>

<p>The home of Fred Linden may be taken as a type of the best that
were found on the frontier. As a matter of course, it was made
of logs, with a stone chimney so huge that it projected like an
irregular bay window from the rear. The fire-place took up the
greater part of one side of the house, where the immense blocks
of oak and hickory not only diffused a cheery warmth through the
lower portion, but sent fully one-half the heat up the enormous
throat of the chimney.</p>

<p>The large room, which served for parlor, sitting and dining room,
was furnished simply, but comfortably, with plain chairs, a bench,
spinning-wheel, a rocking-chair, table, a few cheap pictures and
the indispensable cooking utensils. There was no stove, every
thing being prepared in the fire-place. At that day, as you well
know, no one had ever dreamed of using coal as an article of fuel,
and the old-fashioned stoves were exceedingly few in number. Carpets,
of course, were not thought of, though the rough floor was kept
clean enough to serve as a table for food.</p>

<p>A rifle rested on two deer prongs over the mantel-piece, and
there seemed to be any number of knick-knacks about the room,
though it would have been found that nearly every one had a distinct
use in the household.</p>

<p>Two rooms were connected on the same floor with the larger apartment.
One of these served as the sleeping quarters for the parents when
Mr. Linden was at home, and the other for Edith, while Fred occupied
the loft, which had the rafters for a ceiling, and extended over
half the lower floor. During the absence of the father, Edith
and her mother used one room, while Fred had the other.</p>

<p>Noon had passed when the son came home, and his substantial dinner
of venison&mdash;procured some days before by Fred himself&mdash;brown bread,
potatoes, butter and milk, were awaiting him. Taking his place
at the table, he ate as only a rugged, growing boy of sixteen
can eat.</p>

<p>He made no further mention of the dangerous adventure that had
just befallen him, but gave the full particulars of Terry Clark's
encounter with the Winnebago Indian, who stole the bell from the
cow, and tried to have a little sport at the expense of the boy.
It was an interesting story, and mother and daughter listened
with rapt attention. Edith, who was a bright girl, and very fond
of her brother, asked many questions as to how the Winnebago looked,
what he said, and whether he really meant to kill poor Terry.
Then her interest suddenly transferred itself to Deerfoot, and
she plied Fred with all sorts of queries, until he laughingly
told her that she was asking them two and three times over, and
really he had nothing more to tell.</p>

<p>Then Fred drew out the moist and soiled bit of paper that he
had taken from his other clothes, and which contained the message
of his father. This, of course, caused a sensation, for it made
known the fact that the son was to join his parent for several
months. It would be supposed that this would cause some inconvenience,
but in such a primitive community all were neighbors, and the
chores and work that would have been done by Fred Linden would
be cheerfully attended to by others. It was not until many years
afterward, when the settlements became towns, that the social
distinctions between families were formed.</p>

<p>During all the conversation, after it had been agreed that Fred
should start alone on a hundred mile journey through the wild
forest, nothing was said about such a thing as the personal danger
attending it. And that, too, directly on the heels of the Winnebago's
attempt on Terry Clark. The habit of self-reliance was taught
to the children of the pioneers at such an early age, that their
parents felt no solicitude, where in these times they would have
been tortured by anxiety, and, no doubt, with abundant reason.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bowlby was told of the mishap that had befallen her absent
lord, when she was asked by Edith to come over in the evening,
but she was assured that there was no cause for alarm, and so
she felt none. She wrote a letter to her husband, as did the wife
of Hardin, and Fred's own mother. These constituted all the extra
luggage that he was to take, for it would have been oppressive
to load him with any thing in the nature of a burden when the
hunters had been absent only a few days.</p>

<p>The decision was that Fred should make his start at early dawn
the next day. It was his purpose to reach camp on the fourth day;
that would be only an ordinary tramp for a rugged youngster like
him, and he was confident that he would have no trouble in keeping
to the trail that had been ridden over so recently by his friends.</p>

<p>The little personal articles, as they may be called, which the
lad would require, were mostly the same as those of his father,
and could be utilized by the son. Such, as from the nature of
things, could not answer for both were tied into a compact package
with his linen and strapped over his shoulders with a thick blanket.
His powder horn and bullet pouch were not forgotten. An extra
flint for his rifle was placed in his pocket, and the weapon,
which belonged to the lad himself, was slung over his shoulder
after the manner of a professional hunter. Then making sure that
nothing had been left behind, Fred gave his sister and mother
a warm hug and kiss apiece, called to them a jaunty good-by, and
set his face toward the Ozark mountains.</p>

<p>It had become known that he was to start on quite a lengthy journey,
and those who were astir at that early hour called their hearty
good wishes to the lad, who was popular with all. Fred looked
for Terry, and seeing nothing of him, shouted his name as he passed
by his door, but receiving no response, concluded that he was
still asleep.</p>

<p>The heart of the boy was light as he strode at a rapid pace across
the clearing. He felt no inconvenience from the bruises received
the day before, during the passage of the rapids, and his natural
buoyancy caused him to look upon the tramp through the woods as
a school boy views his long expected vacation. There was no fear
of any peril in the stretch of unbroken forest that opened before
him. It was fortunate indeed for his peace of mind that he did
not know what was awaiting him in the dark arches and labyrinths
of the almost interminable wilderness.</p>
