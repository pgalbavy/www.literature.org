<p>No person in all the world is so quick to detect deception as
a mother. It is simply wonderful the way she will sometimes read
one's thoughts. I am sure you boys who have lagged on the road
when sent on an errand, had a scrimmage with some other boy, or
done any one of the numerous acts in which a mother persists in
asking annoying questions, will agree with me.</p>

<p>While Omas, the Delaware warrior, stood with his face turned
away from the camp fire and looking off in the gloom, as if he
was trying to discover something in the darkness, Mrs. Ripley
was sure she knew what the trouble was: he was trying to decide
whether he should stay longer with the little party or leave them
to make the rest of their way through the woods without him.</p>

<p>He might well say they were now so far from Wyoming that they
were in little danger. They had but to keep on tramping for several
days and nights, and they would reach the little town of Stroudsburg,
which, you may know, is near Delaware Water Gap. There they need
have no fear of the red men.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ripley knew all this as well as Omas himself, but she did
not wish him to go back and join the hostile Iroquois, as he wanted
to do. She felt it would be far better if he would stay with them,
for then he would do no further harm to the white people.</p>

<p>When, therefore, he turned about and bade them goodbye, all doubt
was gone. Ben did not reply, but his mother rose from the other
blanket on which she had been sitting, walked quietly to where
the Delaware was standing, and laid her hand kindly on his arm.</p>

<p>"Omas, I do not wish you to leave us," she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her, for both stood where the firelight fell upon
their faces, and replied&mdash;"No danger&mdash;walk towards the rising
sun&mdash;need not walk fast &mdash;Iroquois won't hurt&mdash;soon be safe."</p>

<p>The lady was too wise to let her real objection appear.</p>

<p>"A while ago we heard the noise of a gun; our people are fleeing
through the woods, and the red men are following them. Alice is
tired, and we have stopped to rest. When we start again tomorrow,
some of the red men will be ahead of us. What shall we do without
our friend Omas?"</p>

<p>"He have gun." he replied, indicating Ben.</p>

<p>"So have the red men, and there are more of them."</p>

<p>Now, if Mrs. Ripley was skilful in reading the thoughts of the
Delaware, it may be that he, too, suspected the real cause for
her objections. Be that as it may, it was plain he was not satisfied.
He held the Ripley family in too high regard to offend them openly;
but Omas was set in his ways.</p>

<p>He made no reply to the last remark, but stepped a little nearer
the fire and sat down, moody and silent.</p>

<p>"You have said enough, mother," remarked Ben in a low voice;
"it will anger him to say more. I will sit with my head against
the rock; do you lie down on the blanket and let your head rest
in my lap. I think it will be safe for us all."</p>

<p>With some hesitation the mother complied, the Delaware apparently
paying no heed to them. He kept his seat on the ground, looking
gloomily into the fire and in deep thought. A struggle was going
on in his mind, and no one could say whether the good or evil
would win.</p>

<p>Ben Ripley was anxious that his mother should sleep. She had
undergone the severest of trials since early morning, and none
had wrought harder than she. The morrow would make further demands
on her strength. As for himself, he was young, sturdy, and could
stand more and rally sooner than she.</p>

<p>When, therefore, she said something in a low tone, he placed
his hand softly over her mouth and whispered&mdash;"<em>S&mdash;</em>h!
go to sleep, baby."</p>

<p>He smoothed the silky hair away from the forehead so gently and
so soothingly that she could not resist the effect. She meant
to keep awake until Omas made his final decision; but no person
can resist the approach of slumber, except by active movement.</p>

<p>Before long, and while Ben's hand was still gliding like down
over the forehead, the faint, regular breathing showed she was
asleep.</p>

<p>The son smiled.</p>

<p>"Good! The best mother that ever lived! Heavenly Father, watch
over her and spare her for many years. Watch over us all."</p>

<p>He looked across at Omas, on the other side of the camp fire,
and saw the Delaware gazing fixedly at him.</p>

<p>He arose as silently as a shadow and stepped nearer, peering
down on the pale, handsome face with its closed eyes.</p>

<p>"She sleep?" asked the Indian.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Ben, softly, with a nod of his head.</p>

<p>He looked at her a moment and then across to the other blanket,
where the round, chubby cheeks of the little girls reflected the
firelight. He waited a moment, and then the gentler side of his
nature triumphed. He bent over the forms, kissed each in turn,
straightened up, and pointing to the eastward, said to Ben&mdash;"Go
dat way&mdash;you safe&mdash;goodbye."</p>

<p>"Goodbye," replied the lad, knowing it was useless to protest.</p>

<p>Like the gliding of the shadow of a cloud, the Delaware passed
beyond the circle of light thrown out by the fire into the deep
gloom of the wood. The moccasins pressed the dry leaves without
giving back any sound, and he vanished.</p>

<p>"That makes a change of situation," was the conclusion of Ben
Ripley; "he's gone, and I become the general of this army; there's
no telling what danger may be abroad tonight, so I will keep my
eyes open till sunrise, to make sure that no harm comes to these
folks."</p>

<p>And ten minutes after this decision the lad was as sound asleep
as his mother and the two little ones.</p>

<p>But there was One who did not slumber while all were unconscious.
He ever watches over His children, and,&mdash;though there were many
perils abroad that night, none of them came near our friends.</p>

<p>The camp fire which had been burning so brightly grew dimmer
and lower until the figures could hardly be seen. They gradually
became more indistinct, and finally the gloom was as deep as anywhere
in the dense woods. Only a few smouldering embers were left, and
they gave out no glow.</p>

<p>Ben was still sleeping, when something tickled his nose. He rubbed
it vigorously with his forefinger and opened his eyes, confused
and bewildered.</p>

<p>An odd, chuckling laugh at his elbow drew his gaze hither. There
stood Linna, with the sprig of oak which she had been passing
back and forth under the base of his nose, making it feel for
all the world like a fly titillating his nostrils.</p>

<p>Ben made an attempt to catch the mischievous girl, but she deftly
eluded him, and laughed so heartily that the others awoke and
looked wonderingly to learn what it all meant.</p>

<p>"I'll pay you for that!" exclaimed the lad, as his mother raised
her head from his lap. Bounding to his feet, he darted after Linna,
but she was so nimble, and dodged back and forth and from right
to left so fast, that it took much effort to run her down.</p>

<p>Like all little girls, she was very "ticklish," and when he dallied
with his fingers about her plump neck, she dropped to the ground
and kicked and rolled over to get away from him. He let her up,
and said with pretended gravity that he never allowed any trifling
with him without punishing the person therefore.</p>

<p>Linna did not seem to notice the absence of her father, and asked
no questions. Ben told his mother how he went off after she fell
asleep, and the good woman saddened, for she was sure she understood
it all.</p>

<p>The first thing done, after a few minutes' talk, was to kneel
in prayer, Mrs. Ripley leading in a petition to Heaven that all
might be preserved from harm and reach the distant settlement
safely. She did not forget the absent Omas, or the hundreds of
hapless people whom they had left behind, who were still in great
danger.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Ripley's custom always to offer prayer in the little
household at the beginning of each day. Linna, who had gained
a dim idea of what the touching act meant, bent on her knees beside
Alice; and who shall say the petition which went up from her heart
was not heard and remembered by Him who notices the fall of every
sparrow.</p>

<p>And now came the serious business of the day. Many long miles
of trackless forest lay before them and the delay caused all to
feel the need of hurry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ripley gave to each a moderate portion of the food brought
with them, carefully preserving what was left, for they were sure
to need that and much more before reaching the end of their journey.
The day promised to be sultry like the preceding one, and each
sadly missed the water with which to quench their thirst and splash
upon their faces and hands.</p>

<p>"We shall come across some before long," said Ben hopefully when
he and his mother had divided the luggage between them and set
out toward the rising sun; "we are a great deal better off than
the poor folks of Wyoming."</p>

<p>The mother pinched the clothing of Linna, and found it dried
of the moisture gained by her swim in the Susquehanna.</p>

<p>It is a curious practice among not only the Indians, but with
many white people, not to change wet stockings or garments for
dry ones. I knew a fisherman's boy whose father once punished
him for removing his saturated stockings and shoes for others.</p>

<p>"Always let 'em dry on you, and you won't catch cold," was his
doctrine. "Keep moving if you can, but don't change 'em."</p>

<p>I don't believe in the practice; but be that as it may, the little
Delaware girl showed no ill effects from sleeping in the clothing
that had been wet. As for her father, he would have been insulted
at the mention of such a thing to him.</p>

<p>Ben's belief about finding water proved true. They had gone hardly
a half mile from camp when they came upon a sparkling brook, cold
and clear, and abundant enough to serve all. Having no vessels
with them, they lay down and quaffed their fill. Then they bathed
their faces and hands in the delicious fluid, and were much refreshed.</p>

<p>The expectation was that they would travel a good many miles
before night again overtook them. The way, while rough and broken
in many places, was not hard, and all, even to the smaller children,
were used to being on their feet. There was little fear indeed
that Linna would not do her part as well as the older ones. Young
as she was in years, she had been trained to hardship from the
time she could walk. Not only that, but, like all her race, she
had learned to bear suffering in silence and without sign of pain.</p>

<p>She would have to become very tired before her companions would
know it.</p>

<p>By and by the ground was found to be rising, and in the course
of an hour they gained an elevation which, having few trees, gave
them an extended view of the surrounding country.</p>

<p>Looking back in the direction of Wyoming, the sky was seen to
be soiled by the heavy smoke not only from the burned Fort Wintermoot,
but from other buildings that had been fired by the Tories and
Indians. The sight was a sorrowful one, and caused the mother
and son some uneasiness. They seemed nearer to the scene of the
conflict than they had supposed, and&mdash;since the people had been
continually swimming the river, and taking flight in the woods
for the same point that was the destination of the Ripleys&mdash;it
was quite certain that some of the pursuers were not far off.</p>

<p>"We must make as little noise as we can," said Ben, when the
party were about to start forward again: "for there can be no
telling how close we are to Indians that are looking for us.'</p>

<p>"I think it better for you to walk a little way in front," suggested
the mother, "so as to warn us in time."</p>

<p>"The plan is a good one. I will keep in sight of you, and the
minute I see anything amiss, will make a sign, so you can stop
at once."</p>

<p>This course was adopted. Ben carried one of the blankets flung
over his left arm as if it were an extra garment, and steadied
the heavy rifle on his shoulder with the other. As you remember,
he was tall for his years, strong, and with rugged health.</p>

<p>Had the weather been cooler he could have Kept up this method
of traveling for hours without fatigue; but the heat made it trying.
True, at that season of the year the foliage was dense on the
trees and shut out the sun's rays, except in the open spaces and
natural clearings which they now and then crossed; but the vegetation
also stopped whatever breeze was stirring, and obliged the members
of the party to halt many times to rest and cool themselves.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ripley had but few extra things to carry, and showed less
fatigue than anyone, excepting the Delaware child. The latter
and Alice walked most of the time side by side, and generally
with clasped hands. There was no use of their trying to keep their
tongues still, but they were wise enough to speak in whispers
and such soft undertones that no one else could tell what they
said, and therefore nothing was to be feared on that account from
any enemies in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>"Why not he make sign?" was the startling question of Linna,
pointing at Ben, before the party had gone far after their brief
rest.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the puzzled Mrs. Ripley; "he isn't
to make any sign to us till he sees or hears something wrong."</p>

<p>"People off dere!" replied Linna, pointing ahead and to the right
of their course. "Me hear dem speak."</p>

<p>It was true. The keen ears of the child had discovered a peril
that no one else suspected. She alone had caught the sound of
voices that escaped all other ears.</p>
