<P>
Lieutenant Harold Percy Smith-Oldwick, Royal Air
Service, was on reconnaissance. A report, or it would be
better to say a rumor, had come to the British headquar-
ters in German East Africa that the enemy had landed in
force on the west coast and was marching across the dark
continent to reinforce their colonial troops. In fact the new
army was supposed to be no more than ten or twelve days'
march to the west. Of course the thing was ridiculous -- pre-
posterous -- but preposterous things often happen in war; and
anyway no good general permits the least rumor of enemy
activity to go uninvestigated.
<P>
Therefore Lieutenant Harold Percy Smith-Oldwick flew low
toward the west, searching with keen eyes for signs of a Hun
army. Vast forests unrolled beneath him in which a German
army corps might have lain concealed, so dense was the
overhanging foliage of the great trees. Mountain, meadow-
land, and desert passed in lovely panorama; but never a sight
of man had the young lieutenant.
<P>
Always hoping that he might discover some sign of their
passage -- a discarded lorry, a broken limber, or an old camp
site -- he continued farther and farther into the west until well
into the afternoon. Above a tree-dotted plain through the
center of which flowed a winding river he determined to turn
about and start for camp. It would take straight flying at top
speed to cover the distance before dark; but as he had ample
gasoline and a trustworthy machine there was no doubt in his
mind but that he could accomplish his aim. It was then that
his engine stalled.
<P>
He was too low to do anything but land, and that immedi-
ately, while he had the more open country accessible, for
directly east of him was a vast forest into which a stalled
engine could only have plunged him to certain injury and
probable death; and so he came down in the meadowland
near the winding river and there started to tinker with his
motor.
<P>
As he worked he hummed a tune, some music-hall air that
had been popular in London the year before, so that one might
have thought him working in the security of an English flying
field surrounded by innumerable comrades rather than alone
in the heart of an unexplored African wilderness. It was
typical of the man that he should be wholly indifferent to his
surroundings, although his looks entirely belied any assump-
tion that he was of particularly heroic strain.
<P>
Lieutenant Harold Percy Smith-Oldwick was fair-hatred,
blue-eyed, and slender, with a rosy, boyish face that might
have been molded more by an environment of luxury, indo-
lence, and ease than the more strenuous exigencies of life's
sterner requirements.
<P>
And not only was the young lieutenant outwardly careless
of the immediate future and of his surroundings, but actually
so. That the district might be infested by countless enemies
seemed not to have occurred to him in the remotest degree.
He bent assiduously to the work of correcting the adjustment
that had caused his motor to stall without so much as an up-
ward glance at the surrounding country. The forest to the
east of him, and the more distant jungle that bordered the
winding river, might have harbored an army of bloodthirsty
savages, but neither could elicit even a passing show of inter-
est on the part of Lieutenant Smith-Oldwick
<P>
And even had he looked, it is doubtful if he would have
seen the score of figures crouching in the concealment of the
undergrowth at the forest's edge. There are those who are
reputed to be endowed with that which is sometimes, for want
of a better appellation, known as the sixth sense -- a species of
intuition which apprises them of the presence of an unseen
danger. The concentrated gaze of a hidden observer provokes
a warning sensation of nervous unrest in such as these, but
though twenty pairs of savage eyes were gazing fixedly at
Lieutenant Harold Percy Smith-Oldwick, the fact aroused no
responsive sensation of impending danger in his placid breast.
He hummed peacefully and, his adjustment completed, tried
out his motor for a minute or two, then shut it off and de-
scended to the ground with the intention of stretching his legs
and taking a smoke before continuing his return flight to
camp. Now for the first time he took note of his surroundings,
to be immediately impressed by both the wildness and the
beauty of the scene. In some respects the tree-dotted meadow-
land reminded him of a parklike English forest, and that
wild beasts and savage men could ever be a part of so quiet
a scene seemed the remotest of contingencies.
<P>
Some gorgeous blooms upon a flowering shrub at a little
distance from his machine caught the attention of his aesthetic
eye, and as he puffed upon his cigarette, he walked over to
examine the flowers more closely. As he bent above them he
was probably some hundred yards from his plane and it was
at this instant that Numabo, chief of the Wamabo, chose to
leap from his ambush and lead his warriors in a sudden rush
upon the white man.
<P>
The young Englishman's first intimation of danger was a
chorus of savage yells from the forest behind him. Turning,
he saw a score of naked, black warriors advancing rapidly
toward him. They moved in a compact mass and as they
approached more closely their rate of speed noticeably di-
minished. Lieutenant Smith-Oldwick realized in a quick glance
that the direction of their approach and their proximity had
cut off all chances of retreating to his plane, and he also
understood that their attitude was entirely warlike and menac-
ing. He saw that they were armed with spears and with bows
and arrows, and he felt quite confident that notwithstanding
the fact that he was armed with a pistol they could overcome
him with the first rush. What he did not know about their
tactics was that at any show of resistance they would fall
back, which is the nature of the native Negroes, but that after
numerous advances and retreats, during which they would
work themselves into a frenzy of rage by much shrieking,
leaping, and dancing, they would eventually come to the point
of a determined and final assault.
<P>
Numabo was in the forefront, a fact which taken in con-
nection with his considerably greater size and more warlike
appearance, indicated him as the natural target and it was at
Numabo that the Englishman aimed his first shot. Unfortu-
nately for him it missed its target, as the killing of the chief
might have permanently dispersed the others. The bullet
passed Numabo to lodge in the breast of a warrior behind him
and as the fellow lunged forward with a scream the others
turned and retreated, but to the lieutenant's chagrin they ran
in the direction of the plane instead of back toward the forest
so that he was still cut off from reaching his machine.
<P>
Presently they stopped and faced him again. They were
talking loudly and gesticulating, and after a moment one of
them leaped into the air, brandishing his spear and uttering
savage war cries, which soon had their effect upon his fellows
so that it was not long ere all of them were taking part in the
wild show of savagery, which would bolster their waning
courage and presently spur them on to another attack.
<P>
The second charge brought them closer to the Englishman,
and though he dropped another with his pistol, it was not
before two or three spears had been launched at him. He
now had five shots remaining and there were still eighteen
warriors to be accounted for, so that unless he could frighten
them off, it was evident that his fate was sealed.
<P>
That they must pay the price of one life for every attempt
to take his had its effect upon them and they were longer now
in initiating a new rush and when they did so it was more
skilfully ordered than those that had preceded it, for they
scattered into three bands which, partially surrounding him,
came simultaneously toward him from different directions,
and though he emptied his pistol with good effect, they
reached him at last. They seemed to know that his ammuni-
tion was exhausted, for they circled close about him now with
the evident intention of taking him alive, since they might
easily have riddled him with their sharp spears with perfect
safety to themselves.
<P>
For two or three minutes they circled about him until, at a
word from Numabo, they closed in simultaneously, and though
the slender young lieutenant struck out to right and left, he
was soon overwhelmed by superior numbers and beaten down
by the hafts of spears in brawny hands.
<P>
He was all but unconscious when they finally dragged him
to his feet, and after securing his hands behind his back,
pushed him roughly along ahead of them toward the jungle.
<P>
As the guard prodded him along the narrow trail, Lieuten-
ant Smith-Oldwick could not but wonder why they had
wished to take him alive. He knew that he was too far inland
for his uniform to have any significance to this native tribe to
whom no inkling of the World War probably ever had come,
and he could only assume that he had fallen into the hands
of the warriors of some savage potentate upon whose royal
caprice his fate would hinge.
<P>
They had marched for perhaps half an hour when the
Englishman saw ahead of them, in a little clearing upon the
bank of the river, the thatched roofs of native huts showing
above a crude but strong palisade; and presently he was
ushered into a village street where he was immediately sur-
rounded by a throng of women and children and warriors.
Here he was soon the center of an excited mob whose intent
seemed to be to dispatch him as quickly as possible. The
women were more venomous than the men, striking and
scratching him whenever they could reach him, until at last
Numabo, the chief, was obliged to interfere to save his pris-
oner for whatever purpose he was destined.
<P>
As the warriors pushed the crowd back, opening a space
through which the white man was led toward a hut, Lieu-
tenant Smith-Oldwick saw coming from the opposite end of
the village a number of Negroes wearing odds and ends of
German uniforms. He was not a little surprised at this, and
his first thought was that he had at last come in contact with
some portion of the army which was rumored to be crossing
from the west coast and for signs of which he had been search-
ing.
<P>
A rueful smile touched his lips as he contemplated the
unhappy circumstances which surrounded the accession of
this knowledge for though he was far from being without
hope, he realized that only by the merest chance could he
escape these people and regain his machine.
<P>
Among the partially uniformed blacks was a huge fellow
in the tunic of a sergeant and as this man's eyes fell upon the
British officer, a loud cry of exultation broke from his lips,
and immediately his followers took up the cry and pressed
forward to bait the prisoner.
<P>
"Where did you get the Englishman?" asked Usanga, the
black sergeant, of the chief Numabo. "Are there many more
with him?"
<P>
"He came down from the sky," replied the native chief
"in a strange thing which flies like a bird and which frightened
us very much at first; but we watched for a long time and
saw that it did not seem to be alive, and when this white man
left it we attacked him and though he killed some of my
warriors, we took him, for we Wamabos are brave men and
great warriors."
<P>
Usanga's eyes went wide. "He flew here through the sky?"
he asked.
<P>
"Yes," said Numabo. "In a great thing which resembled a
bird he flew down out of the sky. The thing is still there
where it came down close to the four trees near the second
bend in the river. We left it there because, not knowing what
it was, we were afraid to touch it and it is still there if it
has
not flown away again."
<P>
"It cannot fly," said Usanga, "without this man in it. It is a
terrible thing which filled the hearts of our soldiers with ter-
ror, for it flew over our camps at night and dropped bombs
upon us. It is well that you captured this white man, Numabo,
for with his great bird he would have flown over your village
tonight and killed all your people. These Englishman are
very wicked white men."
<P>
"He will fly no more," said Numabo "It is not intended
that a man should fly through the air; only wicked demons do
such things as that and Numabo, the chief, will see that this
white man does not do it again," and with the words he pushed
the young officer roughly toward a hut in the center of the
village, where he was left under guard of two stalwart warriors.
<P>
For an hour or more the prisoner was left to his own devices,
which consisted in vain and unremitting attempts to loosen
the strands which fettered his wrists, and then he was inter-
rupted by the appearance of the black sergeant Usanga, who
entered his hut and approached him.
<P>
"What are they going to do with me?" asked the English-
man. "My country is not at war with these people. You
speak their language. Tell them that I am not an enemy, that
my people are the friends of the black people and that they
must let me go in peace."
<P>
Usanga laughed. "They do not know an Englishman from
a German," he replied. "It is nothing to them what you are,
except that you are a white man and an enemy."
<P>
"Then why did they take me alive?" asked the lieutenant.
<P>
"Come," said Usanga and he led the Englishman to the
doorway of the hut. "Look," he said, and pointed a black
forefinger toward the end of the village street where a wider
space between the huts left a sort of plaza.
<P>
Here Lieutenant Harold Percy Smith-Oldwick saw a num-
ber of Negresses engaged in laying fagots around a stake and
in preparing fires beneath a number of large cooking vessels.
The sinister suggestion was only too obvious.
<P>
Usanga was eyeing the white man closely, but if he expected
to be rewarded by any signs of fear, he was doomed to dis-
appointment and the young lieutenant merely turned toward
him with a shrug: "Really now, do you beggars intend eating
me?"
<P>
"Not my people," replied Usanga. "We do not eat human
flesh, but the Wamabos do. It is they who will eat you, but
we will kill you for the feast, Englishman."
<P>
The Englishman remained standing in the doorway of the
hut, an interested spectator of the preparations for the coming
orgy that was so horribly to terminate his earthly existence. It
can hardly be assumed that he felt no fear; yet, if he did, he
hid it perfectly beneath an imperturbable mask of coolness.
Even the brutal Usanga must have been impressed by the
bravery of his victim since, though he had come to abuse and
possibly to torture the helpless prisoner, he now did neither,
contenting himself merely with berating whites as a race and
Englishmen especially, because of the terror the British avia-
tors had caused Germany's native troops in East Africa.
<P>
"No more," he concluded, "will your great bird fly over our
people dropping death among them from the skies -- Usanga
will see to that," and he walked abruptly away toward a group
of his own fighting men who were congregated near the stake
where they were laughing and joking with the women.
<P>
A few minutes later the Englishman saw them pass out of
the village gate, and once again his thoughts reverted to various
futile plans for escape.
<P>
Several miles north of the village on a little rise of ground
close to the river where the jungle, halting at the base of a
knoll, had left a few acres of grassy land sparsely wooded, a
man and a girl were busily engaged in constructing a small
boma, in the center of which a thatched hut already had been
erected.
<P>
They worked almost in silence with only an occasional word
of direction or interrogation between them.
<P>
Except for a loin cloth, the man was naked, his smooth skin
tanned to a deep brown by the action of sun and wind. He
moved with the graceful ease of a jungle cat and when he
lifted heavy weights, the action seemed as effortless as the
raising of empty hands.
<P>
When he was not looking at her, and it was seldom that he
did, the girl found her eyes wandering toward him, and at such
times there was always a puzzled expression upon her face as
though she found in him an enigma which she could not solve.
As a matter of fact, her feelings toward him were not un-
tinged with awe, since in the brief period of their association
she had discovered in this handsome, godlike giant the attri-
butes of the superman and the savage beast closely intermin-
gled. At first she had felt only that unreasoning feminine terror
which her unhappy position naturally induced.
<P>
To be alone in the heart of an unexplored wilderness of
Central Africa with a savage wild man was in itself sufficiently
appalling, but to feel also that this man was a blood enemy,
that he hated her and her kind and that in addition thereto he
owed her a personal grudge for an attack she had made upon
him in the past, left no loophole for any hope that he might
accord her even the minutest measure of consideration.
<P>
She had seen him first months since when he had entered
the headquarters of the German high command in East Africa
and carried off the luckless Major Schneider, of whose fate
no hint had ever reached the German officers; and she had
seen him again upon that occasion when he had rescued her
from the clutches of the lion and, after explaining to her that
he had recognized her in the British camp, had made her
prisoner. It was then that she had struck him down with the
butt of her pistol and escaped. That he might seek no personal
revenge for her act had been evidenced in Wilhelmstal the
night that he had killed Hauptmann Fritz Schneider and left
without molesting her.
<P>
No, she could not fathom him. He hated her and at the
same time he had protected her as had been evidenced again
when he had kept the great apes from tearing her to pieces
after she had escaped from the Wamabo village to which
Usanga, the black sergeant, had brought her a captive; but
why was he saving her? For what sinister purpose could this
savage enemy be protecting her from the other denizens of his
cruel jungle? She tried to put from her mind the probable
fate which awaited her, yet it persisted in obtruding itself
upon her thoughts, though always she was forced to admit
that there was nothing in the demeanor of the man to indicate
that her fears were well grounded. She judged him perhaps
by the standards other men had taught her and because she
looked upon him as a savage creature, she felt that she could
not expect more of chivalry from him than was to be found in
the breasts of the civilized men of her acquaintance.
<P>
Fraulein Bertha Kircher was by nature a companionable
and cheerful character. She was not given to morbid fore-
bodings, and above all things she craved the society of her
kind and that interchange of thought which is one of the
marked distinctions between man and the lower animals.
Tarzan, on the other hand, was sufficient unto himself. Long
years of semi-solitude among creatures whose powers of oral
expression are extremely limited had thrown him almost en-
tirely upon his own resources for entertainment.
<P>
His active mind was never idle, but because his jungle
mates could neither follow nor grasp the vivid train of imag-
inings that his man-mind wrought, he had long since learned
to keep them to himself; and so now he found no need for
confiding them in others. This fact, linked with that of his
dislike for the girl, was sufficient to seal his lips for other
than
necessary conversation, and so they worked on together in
comparative silence. Bertha Kircher, however, was nothing if
not feminine and she soon found that having someone to talk
to who would not talk was extremely irksome. Her fear of
the man was gradually departing, and she was full of a thou-
sand unsatisfied curiosities as to his plans for the future in so
far as they related to her, as well as more personal questions
regarding himself, since she could not but wonder as to his
antecedents and his strange and solitary life in the jungle, as
well as his friendly intercourse with the savage apes among
which she had found him.
<P>
With the waning of her fears she became sufficiently em-
boldened to question him, and so she asked him what he in-
tended doing after the hut and boma were completed.
<P>
"I am going to the west coast where I was born," replied
Tarzan. "I do not know when. I have all my life before me
and in the jungle there is no reason for haste. We are not
forever running as fast as we can from one place to another
as are you of the outer world. When I have been here long
enough I will go on toward the west, but first I must see that
you have a safe place in which to sleep, and that you have
learned how to provide yourself with necessaries. That will
take time."
<P>
"You are going to leave me here alone?" cried the girl; her
tones marked the fear which the prospect induced. "You are
going to leave me here alone in this terrible jungle, a prey
to wild beasts and savage men, hundreds of miles from a
white settlement and in a country which gives every evidence
of never having been touched by the foot of civilized men?"
<P>
"Why not?" asked Tarzan. "I did not bring you here. Would
one of your men accord any better treatment to an enemy
woman?"
<P>
"Yes," she exclaimed. "They certainly would. No man of my
race would leave a defenseless white woman alone in this hor-
rible place."
<P>
Tarzan shrugged his broad shoulders. The conversation
seemed profitless and it was further distasteful to him for the
reason that it was carried on in German, a tongue which he
detested as much as he did the people who spoke it. He wished
that the girl spoke English and then it occurred to him that as
he had seen her in disguise in the British camp carrying on her
nefarious work as a German spy, she probably did speak Eng-
lish and so he asked her.
<P>
"Of course I speak English," she exclaimed, "but I did not
know that you did."
<P>
Tarzan looked his wonderment but made no comment. He
only wondered why the girl should have any doubts as to the
ability of an Englishman to speak English, and then suddenly
it occurred to him that she probably looked upon him merely
as a beast of the jungle who by accident had learned to speak
German through frequenting the district which Germany had
colonized. It was there only that she had seen him and so
she might not know that he was an Englishman by birth,
and that he had had a home in British East Africa. It was as
well, he thought, that she knew little of him, as the less she
knew the more he might learn from her as to her activities
in behalf of the Germans and of the German spy system of
which she was a representative; and so it occurred to him to
let her continue to think that he was only what he appeared
to be -- a savage denizen of his savage jungle, a man of no
race and no country, hating all white men impartially; and
this in truth, was what she did think of him. It explained per-
fectly his attacks upon Major Schneider and the Major's
brother, Hauptmann Fritz.
<P>
Again they worked on in silence upon the boma which was
now nearly completed, the girl helping the man to the best
of her small ability. Tarzan could not but note with grudging
approval the spirit of helpfulness she manifested in the oft-
times painful labor of gathering and arranging the thorn
bushes which constituted the temporary protection against
roaming carnivores. Her hands and arms gave bloody token
of the sharpness of the numerous points that had lacerated her
soft flesh, and even though she were an enemy Tarzan could
not but feel compunction that he had permitted her to do
this work, and at last he bade her stop.
<P>
"Why?" she asked. "It is no more painful to me than it must
be to you, and, as it is solely for my protection that you are
building this boma, there is no reason why I should not do my
share."
<P>
"You are a woman," replied Tarzan. "This is not a wom-
an's work. If you wish to do something, take those gourds
I brought this morning and fill them with water at the river.
You may need it while I am away."
<P>
"While you are away --" she said. "You are going away?"
<P>
"When the boma is built I am going out after meat," he
replied. "Tomorrow I will go again and take you and show
you how you may make your own kills after I am gone."
<P>
Without a word she took the gourds and walked toward
the river. As she filled them, her mind was occupied with
painful forebodings of the future. She knew that Tarzan had
passed a death sentence upon her, and that the moment that
he left her, her doom was sealed, for it could be but a question
of time -- a very short time -- before the grim jungle would
claim her, for how could a lone woman hope successfully to
combat the savage forces of destruction which constituted so
large a part of existence in the jungle?
<P>
So occupied was she with the gloomy prophecies that she
had neither ears nor eyes for what went on about her. Me-
chanically she filled the gourds and, taking them up, turned
slowly to retrace her steps to the boma only to voice im-
mediately a half-stifled scream and shrank back from the
menacing figure looming before her and blocking her way to
the hut.
<P>
Go-lat, the king ape, hunting a little apart from his tribe,
had seen the woman go to the river for water, and it was he
who confronted her when she turned back with her filled
gourds. Go-lat was not a pretty creature when judged by
standards of civilized humanity, though the shes of his tribe
and even Go-lat himself, considered his glossy black coat shot
with silver, his huge arms dangling to his knees, his bullet
head sunk between his mighty shoulders, marks of great per-
sonal beauty. His wicked, bloodshot eyes and broad nose, his
ample mouth and great fighting fangs only enhanced the claim
of this Adonis of the forest upon the affections of his shes.
<P>
Doubtless in the little, savage brain there was a well-formed
conviction that this strange she belonging to the Tarmangani
must look with admiration upon so handsome a creature as
Go-lat, for there could be no doubt in the mind of any that
his beauty entirely eclipsed such as the hairless white ape
might lay claim to.
<P>
But Bertha Kircher saw only a hideous beast, a fierce and
terrible caricature of man. Could Go-lat have known what
passed through her mind, he must have been terribly cha-
grined, though the chances are that he would have attributed
it to a lack of discernment on her part. Tarzan heard the
girl's cry and looking up saw at a glance the cause of her
terror. Leaping lightly over the boma, he ran swiftly toward
her as Go-lat lumbered closer to the girl the while he voiced
his emotions in low gutturals which, while in reality the most
amicable of advances, sounded to the girl like the growling of
an enraged beast. As Tarzan drew nearer he called aloud to
the ape and the girl heard from the human lips the same
sounds that had fallen from those of the anthropoid.
<P>
"I will not harm your she," Go-lat called to Tarzan.
<P>
"I know it," replied the ape-man, "but she does not. She is
like Numa and Sheeta, who do not understand our talk. She
thinks you come to harm her."
<P>
By this time Tarzan was beside the girl. "He will not harm
you," he said to her. "You need not be afraid. This ape has
learned his lesson. He has learned that Tarzan is lord of
the jungle. He will not harm that which is Tarzan's."
<P>
The girl cast a quick glance at the man's face. It was evi-
dent to her that the words he had spoken meant nothing to
him and that the assumed proprietorship over her was, like
the boma, only another means for her protection.
<P>
"But I am afraid of him," she said.
<P>
"You must not show your fear. You will be often sur-
rounded by these apes. At such times you will be safest. Be-
fore I leave you I will give you the means of protecting your-
self against them should one of them chance to turn upon
you. If I were you I would seek their society. Few are the
animals of the jungle that dare attack the great apes when
there are several of them together. If you let them know that
you are afraid of them, they will take advantage of it and
your life will be constantly menaced. The shes especially would
attack you. I will let them know that you have the means of
protecting yourself and of killing them. If necessary, I will
show you how and then they will respect and fear you."
<P>
"I will try," said the girl, "but I am afraid that it will be
difficult. He is the most frightful creature I ever have seen."
Tarzan smiled. "Doubtless he thinks the same of you," he
said.
<P>
By this time other apes had entered the clearing and they
were now the center of a considerable group, among which
were several bulls, some young shes, and some older ones with
their little balus clinging to their backs or frolicking around
at their feet. Though they had seen the girl the night of the
Dum-Dum when Sheeta had forced her to leap from her con-
cealment into the arena where the apes were dancing, they
still evinced a great curiosity regarding her. Some of the shes
came very close and plucked at her garments, commenting
upon them to one another in their strange tongue. The girl,
by the exercise of all the will power she could command, suc-
ceeded in passing through the ordeal without evincing any of
the terror and revulsion that she felt. Tarzan watched her
closely, a half-smile upon his face. He was not so far removed
from recent contact with civilized people that he could not
realize the torture that she was undergoing, but he felt no
pity for this woman of a cruel enemy who doubtless deserved
the worst suffering that could be meted to her. Yet, not-
withstanding his sentiments toward her, he was forced to ad-
mire her fine display of courage. Suddenly he turned to the
apes.
<P>
"Tarzan goes to hunt for himself and his she," he said. "The
she will remain there," and he pointed toward the hut. "See
that no member of the tribe harms her. Do you understand?"
<P>
The apes nodded. "We will not harm her," said Go-lat.
<P>
"No," said Tarzan. "You will not. For if you do, Tarzan
will kill you," and then turning to the girl, "Come," he said,
"I am going to hunt now. You had better remain at the hut.
The apes have promised not to harm you. I will leave my
spear with you. It will be the best weapon you could have in
case you should need to protect yourself, but I doubt if you
will be in any danger for the short time that I am away."
<P>
He walked with her as far as the boma and when she had
entered he closed the gap with thorn bushes and turned away
toward the forest. She watched him moving across the clear-
ing, noting the easy, catlike tread and the grace of every move-
ment that harmonized so well with the symmetry and perfec-
tion of his figure. At the forest's edge she saw him swing
lightly
into a tree and disappear from view, and then, being a woman,
she entered the hut and, throwing herself upon the ground,
burst into tears.
