<p>"How was it that you came to leave me for so long a time?" inquired
Ned, after he had welcomed his two friends with boyish enthusiasm
and congratulated himself upon his timely deliverance.</p>

<p>"Wal," replied Tom, as the three took up a comfortable position
before the fire, "we started you off on that hunt on purpose to
give you a little taste of buffaler huntin', calc'latin' to foller
on after ye in the course of an hour or two. Afore we could do
so, a war-party of a hundred redskins got right atween us&mdash;didn't
you see 'em?"</p>

<p>"No such party as that."</p>

<p>"In course they shut us out altogether. The worst of it was,
we exchanged a few shots back and forth with 'em, and they give
us a brush; so by the time we had dodged out of their way, we
was a long ways off from you. We couldn't do nothin' till mornin',
and by that time the buffaloes and Injuns had trampled out your
trail, so that there was nothin' to be seen of it, and we had
to go it on general principles. We had 'bout made up our mind
that some of the varmints had gobbled you, when we put eyes on
this fire, and there ain't any use of tellin' any more."</p>

<p>The lad now in compliance with their request, related his entire
experience since their separation. Old and veteran hunters as
they were, and chary of praise as was their custom, they did not
hesitate to compliment him highly upon the courage he had displayed
in the most trying emergencies in which he was placed. His experience
had, indeed, been a most remarkable one, and Providence had protected
him in a wonderful manner.</p>

<p>Everything being understood, and the past cleared up, it now
became them to look to the future. There were only two horses
to three persons, and as there were no means of obtaining one,
it became necessary to divide the lad between the two hunters&mdash;an
arrangement which was easily made.</p>

<p>But, although it might seem that the greatest danger of the company
had passed, the truth was, however, that the greatest was still
before them, and both Dick and Tom knew it. They were pursuing
a journey in an almost due south-westerly direction&mdash;precisely
the course necessary to take in order to reach home, as they had
come to look upon Fort Havens. But directly in their path was
a broad level patch of country, interspersed, here and there,
with rocks and vegetation, over which both the Comanches and Apaches
were so constantly roaming that it would be impossible for a white
man to cross it without being discovered by some of the war-parties.</p>

<p>When Dick and Tom were coming from the other direction, they
were seen, and escaped only by the superior fleetness of their
horses. But the trouble was that while they were not expected
and not watched for then, now they were. The redskins were cunning
enough to know that if two hunters rode at full speed through
their country in the direction of Santa Fe, they would be very
likely to return again in the course of a few days, and, as Dick
said, the reds "would be ready for 'em." Consequently, it became
not a question of fleetness; for, if it were, the hunters could
afford to have very little apprehension over the result; but Tom
Hardynge was well convinced that the Apaches, to the number of
a hundred or more, were distributed at different points, and on
the lookout for them. Indeed, he had already seen such evidence
of the fact that it could not be doubted. He did not consider
it necessary to tell their young friend all this, for he would
learn it in due time.</p>

<p>Such being the case it would have been a waste of time for the
three to remain where they were, while they had the sheltering
darkness to screen them in their flight; but the two mustangs
had done a good deal of traveling, and it was wise to give them
the rest while it could be gained. Here were water and grass,
of which the animals were taking the advantage. It was wise to
husband their strength and endurance until the following day.</p>

<p>The hunters extinguished one camp fire entirely, and toned the
other down so that there was no possibility of its attracting
the notice of any one unless he passed very near at hand. Fortunately
for Ned, they had some very good and substantial lunch with them,
with which his hunger was fully satisfied. There still remained
a little stock on hand, which was reserved more for him than themselves.
They were accustomed to such privations and could stand it very
well, but the lad was of too tender years not to suffer keenly.</p>

<p>The night was so far gone that no one attempted to obtain any
sleep. The hunters went out and examined the dead grizzly, learning
his dimensions by the sense of feeling alone. Tom picked up the
tomahawk, and, wiping off the blade upon the grass, shoved it
down in his belt, with the remark that it might come handy again
before they reached Fort Havens. The two then made an observation
for the purpose of learning whether any of the Indians were in
the neighborhood. Nothing important was discovered, however, and
in due time the night ended and the morning came again.</p>

<p>The sun was scarcely up when they were under way. Ned at first
was placed upon the back of the mustang ridden by Dick Morris,
and side by side, the two fleet-limbed creatures left the ridge
and took the shortest route to Fort Havens. The gait was an easy,
swinging one, which the horses were capable of keeping up from
rise of morn until set of sun. The day was warm and sunshiny,
but the air was so clear and pure that the oppressiveness was
much less than would have been the case in a more northern latitude.</p>

<p>Beyond the ridge, the country remained open, as the prairie was
inclined to be rolling than otherwise, but with a surface which
permitted the utmost swiftness of which an animal was capable.
Occasionally patches of wood and rocky elevations were discernible,
but these were given a wide berth in all cases, as they were the
very places where the treacherous enemies would have wished them
to come. A herd of buffaloes, probably the same seen a short time
before, was discerned far to the south, but they were passed by
while still a long distance away.</p>
