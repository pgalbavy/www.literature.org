<p>In no respect did the Indian display his matchless coolness more
strikingly than when, amid the terrific exertion he was compelled
to put forth, he never ceased his doleful singing, if such it
may be called. It continued, indeed, while he was paddling directly
against the current, until, when one of his strains was half complete,
it ceased abruptly, as if cut in two.</p>

<p>At the same moment the prow of the craft was turned to the left,
and, shooting across the brief space, slid a few inches up the
sloping beach. It was evident that his keen eye had detected the
recent presence of persons there, and with far less fear of them
than they had of him he proceeded straightway to investigate matters.</p>

<p>By this time the boys were less inclined to run. The spiritual
edge, so to speak, had worn off, and they saw that it was a material
creature before them&mdash;a genuine red man, with some of whom they
had had experience, especially during the preceding hours. They
had become accustomed to that business, and could view it with
comparative calmness, inasmuch as each held a loaded rifle in
his hand.</p>

<p>Wharton gently touched the shoulder of his companion as an appeal
to him not to speak or make any sound. The two rose noiselessly
to their feet and watched the strange being's actions.</p>

<p>The prow of the canoe having been forced far enough up the stony
slope to hold it motionless, the Indian laid down his paddle,
leaned forward, took the torch in hand, and then stepped from
the boat. The torch was a piece of resinous pine, whose top leaned
so far over the gunwale that there was no danger from the smoking
flame. With this in his left hand he looked down at the embers
of the late fire, some of them still giving forth a faint blue
smoke, and he saw the few remaining fragments of the meal.</p>

<p>With much deliberation he gazed out over the moonlit lake, gradually
coming back to such a position that when he peered into the gloomy
depth of the woods his eyes seemed to be centred on the spot where
the two boys looked silently and wonderingly at him in turn.</p>

<p>The strange being had no gun, but a knife and tomahawk protruded
from the belt around his waist. He was dressed similarly to the
Shawanoes whom they had encountered so recently, and there could
be little doubt that he belonged to their tribe.</p>

<p>No figure could be more picturesque than that formed by this
creature when he raised the flaming torch aloft, bent his head
down and craned it forward, while his black eyes seemed to pierce
the impenetrable gloom from whence the boys silently watched him.</p>

<p>His face was smeared in the truly frightful manner of his people,
and his countenance and features were so irregular that he was
forbidding to the last degree. He stood with one foot advanced,
his attitude suggesting that of a man pausing on the edge of a
ravine and peering across before venturing to leap.</p>

<p>He maintained this attitude for several minutes, as motionless
as those toward whom he was staring. It seemed to Wharton that
his flaming black eyes could look through solid wall or rock,
and the youth held his gun ready to meet any sudden rush from
him.</p>

<p>But he did not advance. Suddenly he resumed his weird chanting,
and then began a fantastic dancing back and forth over the rock,
keeping rude time by swaying the torch and the free arm. The exhibition
was so grotesque that the spectators surmised the truth.</p>

<p>The explanation of it was that the Shawanoe was a zany or lunatic.
The latter is as rare with the American race as it was with the
African in the South before the war, but on no other theory could
the course of the Indian be explained.</p>

<p>Neither Wharton nor Larry held a thought of harming him. Had
he been Blazing Arrow himself they would not have done so, except
in self-defence. Believing him harmless, they would have been
glad to act the part of a friend toward him.</p>

<p>Instead of seeking out those who had started the fire, the warrior
returned to his canoe, carefully adjusted the torch in its place,
shoved the boat clear, leaped into it, caught up his paddle, and
sent his craft spinning along the left bank, seemingly with the
speed of a swallow on the wing.</p>

<p>"He's not a ghost," exclaimed Larry, "but he's crazy clear through.
Where has he gone?"</p>

<p>The two stepped to the edge of the water and looked in the direction
where the boat had disappeared. A short distance away the shore
made a curve, and it was this, evidently, which shut the Indian
and canoe from sight. It would have taken rapid motions, but the
paddler had proved his expertness in that.</p>

<p>The occurrence caused the boys to forget their drowsy, tired
feeling. They became as alert and wide awake as during the day.</p>

<p>"Larry, let's push on and around the lake. I'm worried now about
father and mother, and it won't do to lose more time."</p>

<p>"I'm as willing as yersilf."</p>

<p>The rocky shore made travelling easy, and they walked with greater
freedom than at any time since leaving the vicinity of the falls.
The younger kept his place a few paces in advance, and had not
gone far when he stopped again with the exclamation:</p>

<p>"Here's the crazy man again!"</p>

<p>He was not exactly right, for instead of the Indian he saw the
canoe drawn up against the rocky shore, as in the previous instance.
The paddle was there, but the Indian and torch were missing.</p>

<p>"I wonder what that means?"</p>

<p>"Maybe he has grown tired and gone ashore to rest awhile."</p>

<p>It did not seem likely that the fellow was far away, and they
looked curiously in every direction. He had not resumed his chanting
after leaving the scene of the boys' camp, and he was nowhere
in sight.</p>

<p>There is no telling what fancy may enter the head of a lunatic,
and, much as the couple would have disliked to harm him, they
were always ready to defend themselves.</p>

<p>Doubtless it was the sight of the fire by which Wharton cooked
the fish that led the Shawanoe to paddle his craft across the
lake. It is not likely that the whole performance was meant to
frighten away the intruders.</p>

<p>"I don't think we have anything to fear from him," remarked Wharton,
after they had waited several minutes; "we may as well use our
time in pushing on."</p>

<p>"It's a long thramp we have before us."</p>

<p>The two looked up the lake toward the end where the wild waters
rushed through the gorge. The outlook was discouraging, for, light
as was the moonlight, they could see nothing of the dark line
of forest which must have marked the uttermost boundary.</p>

<p>Wharton drew a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"I'm tempted to turn back; we can follow the stream and find
the trail again, while now there's no telling where we may bring
up."</p>

<p>"I've a better idea," said Larry, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>By way of answer he pointed to the canoe, whispering:</p>

<p>"The paddle is there."</p>

<p>"We'll do it; it will save us a good deal of hard work, and perhaps
prevent our going astray. But the owner will be likely to object."</p>

<p>"How can he help himself?"</p>

<p>"All right; in with you; there's no saying when he'll be back
again."</p>

<p>Larry Murphy was as deft in handling the paddle as his companion,
and at the same moment shoved the prow clear and leaped in. He
made a couple of sweeps with the implement, which sent the boat
far out over the gleaming surface.</p>

<p>It was well that they were so prompt in their movements, for
the next minute the red man burst from the woods, and came rushing
and chattering toward them as if he intended to overhaul them
by swimming. His words were unintelligible, being in his native
tongue, but there was no mistaking his wrath.</p>

<p>"I belave the gintleman is excited," remarked Larry, swinging
the paddle more leisurely.</p>

<p>"It looks that way&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Sh! mind your eye!"</p>

<p>Something whizzed by the head of Wharton and splashed in the
water beyond. It almost grazed his cheek, and seemed to be like
a cannon ball. For all purposes it might have been considered
such, for had it struck the youth, the result would have been
fatal.</p>

<p>The crazy Indian had hurled a large stone with prodigious force
and accuracy. Little need, it would seem, of such a thrower carrying
a firearm.</p>

<p>As Wharton turned his affrighted gaze around he saw the fellow
about to hurl another.</p>

<p>"Gracious! he will kill us," exclaimed the youth, bending his
head forward to dodge the terrible missile.</p>

<p>"No, he won't, ayther."</p>

<p>As Larry spoke he dropped his paddle, caught up his rifle, and,
pointing toward the red man, fired.</p>
