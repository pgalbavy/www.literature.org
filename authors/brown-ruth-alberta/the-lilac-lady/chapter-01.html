<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Two days after the night of the memorable surprise party in the
little brown house, the place stood dismantled and deserted under
the naked, shivering trees, good-byes had been spoken, and the
six smiling sisters had driven away from their Parker home amid
much fluttering of handkerchiefs and waving of hands. Everyone
was sorry to see them go, yet all rejoiced in the great good fortune
which had befallen the little orphan brood. Even after the Judge's
carriage, which was to take them to the station, disappeared around
the bend of the creek road, the enthusiastic crowd of friends
and neighbors clustered about the sagging gate continued to shout
their joking warnings and happy wishes upon the crisp, frosty,
morning air.</p>

<p>"There," breathed Peace, grinning from ear to ear, as she slowly
unwound from the corkscrew twist she had assumed in her attempt
to catch the last glimpse of the old home. "They're all out of
sight now. I can't even see Hec Abbott any longer up in the tree
with his dirty handkerchief. Oh, Mr. Judge, I forgot you were
our coachman this morning, but his handkerchief <em>is</em> awful
dirty! It always is. I guess his mother doesn't chase him up like
Gail does us with clean ones. Faith Greenfield, what do you mean
by kicking me like that? Ain't there room enough on that back
seat for your big feet?"</p>

<p>"Little girls should be heard and not seen," quoted Cherry with
her most sanctimonious air, noting the gathering frown on the
older sister's face, and not quite understanding what had gone
amiss.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's just what Peace believes, too," cried Hope with
her happy, contagious laugh in which Gail and the Judge and even
Faith joined, making the sharp air ring with their hilarity.</p>

<p>"Guess this ride must make you feel ticklish, too," suggested
Peace, looking over her shoulder with a comical, self-complacent
air at the crowded rear seat of the carryall. "I 'xpected to see
some of you bawling about now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bawling!" echoed the girls in genuine surprise, while the old
Judge chuckled to himself. "What for?"</p>

<p>"'Cause we've left Parker for good and all. We're never going
to live there any more."</p>

<p>"But we shall visit there often. Grandpa said so," cried Hope,
warmly. "It isn't as if we were bound for the poor-farm or some
dreadful orphan home. We might have reason to cry then; but as
it is, we're going to Martindale to live in a splendid great house
with splendid, lovely people; and I can't help wanting to jump
up and shout for gladness, even though we do love Parker and all
the people there who have been so good to us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good for you, Miss Hope! Hip, hip, hurrah!" broke in the Judge,
flapping the reins wildly as he doffed his hat and cheered heartily.
"That's the proper spirit! We Parkerites don't expect you to break
your hearts because you are going to a new home; we'd think it
very queer indeed if you did. But we are glad to know this old
town holds a tender spot in your memories. We shall miss you more
than you will us, which is only natural; but as Hope says, you
will be often among us as visitors, even though the little brown
house will never be home to you again. Doctor and Mrs. Campbell
have not only opened the door of their big house to you, but also
the door of their hearts. Go in and take possession. You can make
them the happiest people on earth if you want to&mdash;and I know you
do. They intended to drive over after you this morning, but we
villagers said no. They ought to be in Martindale to greet you,
and we certainly deserved the privilege of escorting you to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ain't it nice to be pop'lar?" sighed Peace in ecstasy. "We're
all bones of <em>condescension</em> today&mdash;now what are you laughing
at?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we've reached the station already," chirped Allee with a
suddenness which made everyone jump.</p>

<p>"And if there isn't Mr. Strong!" cried the older girls in astonishment.
"How did you ever get here ahead of us? We left you sitting on
Peace's gate-post."</p>

<p>"He sneaked," Peace declared without giving him a chance for
reply. "He can sneak in anywhere. Oh, I didn't mean that as a
<em>complimemp</em>, Mr. Preacher. You know I didn't! But you
truly go so like a cat that people never know when you will jump
out at them. Where is Elspeth &mdash;I mean Pet&mdash;I mean &mdash;Oh,
there she is in the station house, and Miss Truesdale and Miss
Dunbar and Dr. Bainbridge! We're much obliged that so many of
you have come down to make sure we left town. Let me get out of
here, Judge! I want to kiss Glen again." Scrambling excitedly
out of her seat beside the dignified driver, she was over the
wheels before he could stop her, and into the arms of the waiting
friends.</p>

<p>None of the orphan sisters had expected such a glorious send-off&mdash;nor,
indeed, had the Parker friends planned it beforehand. It was just
one of those acts of kindness born of the impulse of the moment
and made possible because of a shortcut to the station and the
grocer's wagon which stood hitched in front of Mr. Hartman's door.
But the sight of the little group of neighbors on the station
platform was very gratifying to every one of the youthful Greenfields,
and each proceeded to show her pleasure in her own characteristic
way. This second farewell-taking was very brief, however, for
down the tracks came the puffing train, stopping at the narrow
platform only long enough for the laughing, chattering girls to
climb aboard, before it glided away again, with Peace's shrill
protests trailing off into silence: "I don't see why we have to
take the train when it is such a teeny short ride. I'd rather
go by street-car. I didn't kiss Elspeth but once, and the Judge
looked as if he was dying for another&mdash;"</p>

<p>Silently, soberly, the gay little company at the railroad station
dispersed to their various homes; but fortunately for the band
of inexperienced travellers aboard the flying train, there was
no time for serious thought, so brief was their journey. Scarcely
were they settled with their hand-bags and grips when the brakeman
threw open the door and strode down the aisle, bawling loudly,
"Martindale, Martindale! Our next stop is Martindale Union Depot!"
And before they could realize what was happening, the porter had
bundled them off in the great, dark, noisy station-yard, filled
with throngs of excited, hurrying people passing in and out of
the heavy iron gates.</p>

<p>Caught in the jam, there was a moment of breathless bewilderment;
a frantic disentangling of themselves from the pushing, shoving
crowd; a hurried, frightened survey of the sea of unfamiliar faces
around them, and then straight into the arms of the smiling college
President the anxious sextette walked.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well!" he cried with boyish eagerness, trying to
gather them all in one embrace. "Here you are at last! I've waited
one solid hour for this train. Those Parker people tried to tell
me it was my place to stand in the doorway over at the house and
welcome you there, but blessed if I could wait! Neither could
Grandma. I thought I had stolen away without anyone seeing me,
but before I had reached the car-tracks, there she was right at
my heels. Here, mother, are your&mdash;own!"</p>

<p>No welcome from the doorsteps of the great house could have warmed
and thrilled those six hearts as did the husky, tremulous words
of greeting in the dim, smoky station amid the clanging engines
and shouted orders of trainmen. Home! Ah, what a glorious feeling
of possession! The tears which had not come at thought of leaving
the old home now welled up in the blue eyes and in the brown,
but they were tears of joy and thanksgiving.</p>

<p>"I knew someone would do some bawling before we got through with
this," sniffed Peace, searching in vain for the handkerchief which
was never to be found in her pocket, and finally wiping her eyes
on the august President's coat-sleeve. "Let's go home now. I want
to see what it's like. You didn't bring the carriage, did you?
It's just as well, I guess, for I s'pose we'll have lots of rides
anyway. Only I wanted to see if the horses looked anything like
Black Prince. Is this our car? Oak Street &mdash;I'll remember
that; I may want to do some travelling all by myself some day.
If you've got ten rooms in your house, how many are you going
to turn over to us? For our very own, I mean. Three in a room
makes things awfully crowded if the rooms are as teeny as they
were in our house in Parker. 'Tisn't so bad in winter, but in
summer we nearly roast to death nights. Do you have much comp'ny,
and will we have to give up our rooms to them all the time? I
forgot to ask you about these things before we said we'd come."</p>

<p>"Peace!" reproved Gail in an undertone, trying to check the flow
of questions and information pouring so rapidly from the lively
tongue. "Don't talk all the time. Give grandpa a chance to say
a few words."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will," responded the child with angelic sweetness, in
such loud tones that she could be heard all over the car. "I'm
waiting for him to say a few words now. How about it, grandpa?
Shall we each have a room or must we double up or thribble&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace!" called Allee in wild excitement, "there is Frances Sherrar's
house!"</p>

<p>"Where? Is it, grandpa?" asked Cherry, a little twinge of envy
seizing her as she remembered her younger sisters' visit there
a few weeks before.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, glancing hastily out of the window, "I think
very likely it was, as they live on the corner we have just passed,
and the next street is where we get off. Press the button, Curlypate,
or the conductor will carry us by. I didn't know you were acquainted
with the Sherrars, Abigail. Frances is a student at the University;
you will probably be in some of her classes. Give me your hand,
Hope. There, mother, all our family are off. Right about face!
One block west, and&mdash;here we are. Welcome home, my children! Peace,
how do you like the looks of it?"</p>

<p>They had paused in front of a great, rambling, old house, set
in the midst of a wide lawn, brown and sere now with approaching
winter, and surrounded by huge, knotted, gnarled, old oaks, whose
dry leaves still clung to the twisted branches and rustled in
the crisp air. A fat, sleek, black Tabby lay asleep on the warm
porch-rail; a gaunt, ungainly greyhound lay sunning himself on
the door mat, and from inside somewhere came the sound of a canary's
riotous song. The whole place breathed of home, and with a deep
sigh of content, Peace lifted her great, brown eyes to the President's
face and whispered, "It seems 'sif I b'longed already."</p>

<p>"You do," he murmured huskily. "This is home, dear."</p>

<p>Hand in hand they walked up the path and through the door into
the big hall, flooded with warm sunshine and sweet with the smell
of roses. Up the stairway they marched, followed by the other
sisters, all silent, wondering, but happy, and paused in the doorway
of a large, airy room, furnished with easy-chairs and couches,
a tempting array of late books, and a dainty sewing-table, heaped
with pretty materials such as young girls love. "This is mother's
domain," the President announced, stepping aside to let them enter.
"Hang your wraps in that closet for the time being, make yourselves
presentable&mdash;there is a mirror on purpose for prinking&mdash;and then
get acquainted with your new home. There is still an hour and
a half before luncheon will be served, and that ought to give
you quite an opportunity to make discoveries. Now away with you!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;," "How," "What do you mean?" blurted out the astonished
girls, wondering whether he was in earnest or just joking, for
this seemed a queer way to introduce them to their new life.</p>

<p>"Just what I say," he laughed. "Mother thought we ought to conduct
you about the place and explain all the different phases of your
new home, but I am inclined to believe you will like it better
if you can make the tour all by yourselves. Young folks usually
glory in unexplored fields. Now to it, for time is fleeting! I
shall call for a report of your discoveries at luncheon. A prize
for the one who has seen the most."</p>

<p>"Do we have to go by ourselves?" Peace lingered to ask.</p>

<p>"As you wish," was the brief response; and with his hat in his
hand, the busy President descended the stairs, leaving a very
bewildered group in the sewing-room behind him.</p>

<p>"Well!" Gail ejaculated. "How shall we begin?"</p>

<p>"I saw a piano as we came through the hall below," Faith half
whispered.</p>

<p>"And books! Everywhere!" cried Cherry, her eyes fastened longingly
upon the little book-case in the corner. "Do they really belong
to us now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," answered Peace in business-like tones. "Come
on, Allee; let's get to work and see what we can find before lunch
time. This is a pretty big house, and we've got to hustle if we
get all around it in an hour and a half. Wonder where grandpa
and grandma went. Shall we commence at the bottom and work up,
or start in at the attic? I guess the attic first will be best,
seeing we've come up one flight of stairs already, and it would
be just a waste of time to go down and have to climb them all
again." Answering her own question, she clutched Alice's hand
and disappeared in one direction, as the sisters, following her
example, scattered about the great house on their tours of inspection.</p>

<p>The next ninety minutes were busy ones in the Campbell house,
and it was necessary to ring the dinner bell twice before all
members of the happy family were summoned to the table.</p>

<p>"Well, how goes it?" smiled the President. "Judging from the
time it took to gather the clans, some of you must have been pretty
busy."</p>

<p>"We were," dreamily murmured Cherry, who had been dragged bodily
from the stacks of books in the library.</p>

<p>"Made any great discoveries?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" they cried in unison.</p>

<p>"Good! I'm all impatience! Relate your adventures. We are anxious
to hear how you like your new home&mdash;mother and I. Abigail, you
are the oldest; suppose you begin."</p>

<p>"I didn't get very far, I am afraid," said Gail modestly. "Just
a peep into the rooms upstairs and a beginning down here when
I found Gussie almost on the verge of tears because her dessert
had burned black and she had no time to make any more; so I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bet our talking burned up her pies," Peace was heard to murmur
remorsefully.</p>

<p>"&mdash;helped her out a little," continued Gail, "and by that time
the bell rang, so there was no opportunity for any further investigations."</p>

<p>"Saint Elizabeth," said the President reverently, while the white-haired
mistress of the house beamed her approval.</p>

<p>"Now, Faith,&mdash;but there is really no need of asking her about
her discoveries. She got no further than the parlor with its piano.
Now, did you?"</p>

<p>"No, grandpa," Faith confessed unblushingly. "I saw it when we
came in, and I simply couldn't resist it a minute longer than
was absolutely necessary. There will be lots of days for getting
acquainted here, and besides, I knew Peace would carry off the
prize&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Me carry off the prize!" Peace interrupted. "I've never got
a prize for anything in my life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only because there never was one offered before for the person
who could see the most or talk the longest," laughed Faith, and
Peace subsided suddenly.</p>

<p>"Saint Cecilia,&mdash;she could not get past the piano," teased Dr.
Campbell, when the shout of laughter at Faith's sally had died
away. "Hope, what have you to say for yourself?"</p>

<p>"Not much. I visited all the rooms upstairs and down; fed the
canary; got acquainted with Blinks, the cat, and Kyte, the hound;
found Towzer and tried to make him be friends with Kyte, but he
wouldn't be coaxed. Gussie said there were some kittens in the
basement, so I went down there to find them, but the boy from
the hardware store was there working on the furnace, and some
way we fell to talking about studies, and he was so discouraged
over his algebra lesson for night-school that I stopped to see
if I could help him out a little, and the bell rang Just as we
got the third problem worked."</p>

<p>"My gentle Saint Lucia," he said in praise, as he turned from
her to the next sister in age. "Cherry, give an account of your
wanderings."</p>

<p>"I wandered downstairs as far as the library &mdash;I guess that
is what you call it."</p>

<p>"And then what?" for she stopped as if her tale were told.</p>

<p>"That's all. I stayed there."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The President wilted, Mrs. Campbell stared, and for a moment
even the sisters were silent in surprise at the matter-of-fact
tone of the narrator; then the whole assembly burst into another
merry shout, much to the disgust of poor Cherry, who could see
no cause for amusement, and voiced her sentiments by saying petulantly,
"I don't see anything the matter with that! What difference is
there between playing the piano all the morning and reading books?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't what you did that amused us," said Mrs. Campbell soothingly.
"It was the way you told it. We won't laugh any more."</p>

<p>"Oh!" breathed the ruffled damsel in relief, "if that's all,
I don't care how much you laugh. But you'll have a better chance
with Peace&mdash;she never can tell anything straight."</p>

<p>"What kind of a saint is Cherry?" inquired the younger girl,
ignoring the compliment she had just received. "If Gail is Saint
'Lizabeth and Faith is Saint Cecilia and Hope is Saint Lucy, what's
Cherry?"</p>

<p>"Saint Bookworm, I guess, Miss Curiosity-Box. What have you been
doing this morning?"</p>

<p>"Oh, lots of things," she sighed heavily. "Allee and me went
together. We began with the attic, which is full of trunks of
old clothes and battered-up furniture and cobwebs, and has two
rooms for the hired girls to sleep in. Gussie's room is just <em>suburb</em>!
It's dec'rated with the queerest looking old bird of a bedstead&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace! What slang!" cried Faith in genuine horror.</p>

<p>"It's no such thing! It is a bird! She calls it a swan, for it's
got a tall, crooked neck for the foot-board, and if I had it in
my room, I'd hang curtains on its tail. It could be done just
splendid! I'll show you after lunch if you don't b'lieve me."</p>

<p>"Oh, we believe you! Go on. I'm interested in that room," begged
Hope, wondering why she too had not begun with the attic.</p>

<p>"Then on the wall she has a great fish-net full of the prettiest
postcards of Norway and Sweden and De'mark. She's a Swede, you
know, &mdash;Gussie is; and her married brother and two sisters
and grandmother still live over there. That's where the fish-net
came from. I didn't have time to stop long to look at the cards
'cause there was so much else to do 'fore lunch time, but she's
invited us to come up some evening when she's through work and
then she'll tell all about them. There's the loveliest green and
yellow quilt on her bed that she made all herself. She said grandma
had a red one for her to use, but it seemed more like home with
her own things, so she uses them instead of those that b'long
to the house. But the prettiest of everything is a queer little
piece of glass hanging in the window which makes her room look
like a real rainbow on sunny days, 'cause the <em>prison respects</em>
the light and sorts out all the colors. Oh, you needn't laugh
and think you know better! Gussie told us all about it, didn't
she, Allee?"</p>

<p>"Gussie did not call it a <em>prison</em>," Hope could not refrain
from saying. "It is a prism, and it re&mdash;it isn't <em>respects</em>
the light, grandpa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. Refracts is the word she wants to use. Peace tries to drink
in so much information that she can't digest it all."</p>

<p>"Maybe that is what's the matter," Peace agreed thoughtfully.
"Anyway, her room is a beauty&mdash;lots prettier that Marie's, though
Marie has the same chance of making hers look nice that Gussie
has. There's the same difference in the girls themselves that
there is in their rooms, too."</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean?" cried the astonished mistress of the
house, while the President nodded his head in approval at the
child's observations.</p>

<p>"Well, Gussie is good-natured and 'bliging, while Marie is cross
and grouchy. We hadn't got the knob of her door turned before
she ordered us out of her room and told us to mind our own business."</p>

<p>"Poor childie, I ought to have cautioned you not to go into either
of those attic rooms without the girls' permission. You see, while
they work here, that is the one place in the house which is really
theirs, and they don't want the rest of the family intruding."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know now. Gussie told me how it was when I spoke of Marie's
being cross, but we never touched a thing; we just looked, didn't
we, Allee? Marie had the tooth-ache, and that's enough to make
anyone ugly. I got her some funny stuff that a shoemaker in Parker
gave me once when I had the tooth-ache. After that she was a little
pleasanter to us&mdash;that is, for a time. It did stop the aching
right away, but it took all the skin off her cheek where she put
the medicine&mdash;it is to be rubbed on outside. I forgot to tell
her it would do that, so she didn't like it very well when her
face began to peel off, 'cause she is going to the theatre tonight
with her beau. But when she jawed about it, I told her I'd rather
have a skinned face and a chance to go to the theatre, than an
aching tooth any day of the week, and fin'ly she decided she would,
too. I guess I'll like her in time, but I like Gussie better.
Then we went on downstairs and 'xamined the rooms on that floor.
The big front room is awfully pretty, and so is grandma's room
where she sews, but the other three bedrooms are very bare and
ugly-looking. Is that where you're going to put us, grandpa?"</p>

<p>"Peace!" shrieked the sisters in horrified chorus.</p>

<p>"Yes!" roared the delighted President, and even Mrs. Campbell
joined in his merriment.</p>

<p>"Well, I s'pose it is healthy," Peace reluctantly admitted; then
as if divining a joke somewhere, she smiled serenely and continued
her recital. "We looked through the parlor and library and dining-room
and where you put company when they come, and then we came to
the kitchen. We got there ahead of Gail all right, for Gussie
was just making some pies and reading a book at the same time."</p>

<p>"A book!" echoed Mrs. Campbell, a slight frown gathering on the
usually placid forehead.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was a <em>pome</em> of some kind that she was trying
to learn. She wants to be a <em>neducated</em> Swede. She got
through High School, but she wants to know more'n that, so's she
can be a teacher some day. That's how she comes to be cooking
for other people. She is a good cook and can make pretty good
money that way. She isn't a big spender, so every month she can
put away 'most all of her wages towards going to Normal School.
I always thought Normal School was where they sent bad boys and
girls who couldn't be good at home, but she says I mean Reform
School. I guess she'll get to Normal School all right. I told
her Gail would help her with her lessons when they got too hard
for her alone, 'cause Gail's to go to the University right away;
but I didn't think Faith would be much good at that, as long's
she isn't quite through High School herself. I told her Faith
could make lovely fancy things to eat and would like awfully well
to teach her when she had any spare time, and Gussie says she'll
be tickled to learn, 'cause she is only a plain cook and not up
on frills yet."</p>

<p>Faith and the President exchanged comical glances across the
table, but Peace was too much interested in her cake and fruit
to notice what was going on around her, and blissfully continued,
"We went down in the basement, too, and saw that boy from Benton's.
His name is Caspar Dodds. His father is dead&mdash;what a lot of dead
folks there are in this world!&mdash;and he has to earn money to take
care of his mother and two sisters. She does plain sewing, and
I promised you'd hire her sometimes, grandma. They live on Sixteenth
Street, just at the corner where the Pendennis car turns off from
the bridge. He told me how to get there. He's going to night-school
so's he can learn the education he's missing daytimes, and says
he gets along well in everything but algebra. I guess that's how
he came to speak to Hope about it. I told him she'd be glad to
help him with 'xamples he couldn't do, 'cause she was Professor
Watson's star scholar in that. Gussie told <em>us</em> about the
kittens, too, so I knew Hope would be down to find them, and that
way she'd see Caspar. She must have come along right after us
or she wouldn't have found him, 'cause he was 'most ready to go
when we went out to the barn.</p>

<p>"Jud had just brought in the horses from exercising them, and
I told him I guessed likely we'd help him at that job after this,
for all of us like to ride. At first he wasn't going to let us
see the horses and we had to do a lot of talking 'fore he'd give
in. He used awful poor grammar, and when he told us the stable
wasn't the place for little girls and that we better go in the
house and learn to cook like Gussie, I asked him why he didn't
get some books and learn to speak right like Gussie, instead of
sitting on an old box and reading yellow newspapers&mdash;well, it
<em>was</em> yellow, just as yellow and musty and old as it could
be! And he's too nice looking to be nothing but a horseman all
his life. When I told him that, he got interested and fin'ly showed
us some books he was trying to study, but he can't see sense in
the grammar. Gussie promised to help him, but she never has much
time for such things, and he thinks she thinks he's a plumb dunce.
I promised to ask her if that's the way she felt, but he said
I mustn't; so I did the next best I could think of &mdash;I told
him Cherry would study grammar with him. She uses the same book
he has in the barn, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace Greenfield, did you really tell him that?" gasped poor
frightened Cherry, looking as if she had just heard her death
sentence pronounced.</p>

<p>"Why, yes! I thought you'd be glad to help him out that much.
I haven't got as far as grammar in school yet, or I'd teach him
all myself; but I promised to <em>talk</em> proper grammar to
him, so's to help all I could. What do you look so scared about,
Cherry? He really wants to learn; he ain't fooling. And he's an
awful nice man. He showed us the squirrels' hole in the vacant
oak by the barn &mdash;I mean the hollow oak&mdash;and took us down
to the boat-house on the river. You never told us anything about
the river being so near here, grandpa. And he pointed out the
University buildings through the trees, and promised to show us
around the grounds right after lunch if you didn't have time to
bother. He let us go up in the barn loft and says if you're willing,
we can have a playhouse up there in the part with the window that
looks out over the river. Then he pulled out his watch to let
us know it was lunch time, but we told him right square out that
there was one more thing we wanted to see, lunch time or no lunch
time, and that was the horses. So after he grumbled some more
about children being such nuisances, he took us downstairs again,
and showed us your Marmalade and Champagne. Oh, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" shouted the whole family in shocked amazement.</p>

<p>"Marmalade and Champagne," Peace repeated more slowly. "That
is what Jud called them. They aren't as pretty as our Black Prince,
'cause they are only red, and a red horse is never as nice as
a black&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Horses! What funny names!" laughed Hope.</p>

<p>"She has made a mistake," smiled Mrs. Campbell. "They are Marmaduke
and Charlemagne. My nephew's children named them, which accounts
for their high-sounding titles. I am glad you like Marmaduke and
Charlemagne, Peace. We think they are very intelligent animals.
Jud has succeeded in teaching them several rather clever tricks."</p>

<p>"Yes, I like the horses and I like the people. It's going to
be nice to live with such a <em>neducated</em> bunch. Marie's
the only one that doesn't want to learn more, but p'raps she'll
get over it. Who wins the prize, grandpa? That's all Allee and
me saw. And what is the prize?"</p>

<p>"After dinner in the den tonight I'll tell you the secret," the
President promised. "I had no idea it would take so long to recount
your adventures, but my time is up now. I must go back to the
University at once. And by the way, Peace, I am afraid Jud will
have to show you around the campus if you must see it this afternoon.
I have an important meeting at two o'clock."</p>
