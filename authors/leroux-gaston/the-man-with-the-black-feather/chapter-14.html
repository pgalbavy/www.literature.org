<p>It is to M. Lecamus that we owe the account of the operation
which M. Eliphas de Saint-Elme de Taillebourg de la Nox thought
it his duty to perform on Theophrastus Longuet. His account of
it, apparently written for the Pneumatic Club, at the instance
of Theophrastus himself, is among the papers in the sandalwood
box. It runs:</p>

<p>"The scene of savagery which would have ended in my poor friend
Theophrastus losing the little finger of his left hand, but for
the presence of mind of M. Eliphas de la Nox, proved to us that
the bloodthirsty imagination of Cartouche had absolutely filled
the brain of that honest man, my best and trustiest friend. It
seemed to us therefore that the sole cure for this terrible evil
was <em>the death of Cartouche</em>.</p>

<p>"M. de la Nox, indeed, did not hesitate; he had tried reason
in vain, though for a moment we had believed it victorious: an
operation was indicated. Madame Longuet made a few protests, so
half-hearted that we ignored them. As for Theophrastus, it was
useless to ask his opinion. Besides, M. de la Nox had already
fixed him with his gaze; and no one has ever resisted the gaze
of M. de la Nox.</p>

<p>"Theophrastus breathed several deep sighs, and began to tremble
violently. But when M. de la Nox cried: 'I order you to sleep,
Cartouche!' he fell back into the armchair behind him and never
stirred. His breathing was so faint that we might almost have
doubted that he was still living.</p>

<p>"The operation of the death of Cartouche was about to begin.
I knew, from several famous instances, that it was an operation
of great difficulty, for one always risks, in essaying to kill
a reincarnate soul, that is to say, to cast back into nothingness
that part of the Individuality which has been someone in a previous
existence, and pursues us into this with a violence which prevents
us from living in the Present&mdash;one always risks, I say, <em>killing
along with the reincarnate soul the body in which it is reincarnate</em>.
We were going to try to kill Cartouche without killing Theophrastus,
<em>but we might kill Theophrastus</em>. Hence our anxiety.</p>

<p>"It needed all the authority, all the science, and also the absolute
calmness of M. de la Nox to render me at all at ease in the extremity
in which we found ourselves. But M. de la Nox has the most powerful
and dominating will the world has known since Jacques Molay, whom
he has succeeded in the supreme command of the actual and secret
Order of the Templars.</p>

<p>"Also I bore in mind the categorical demonstrations of his last
treatise on Psychical Surgery, and the exact precision of his
instructions in his monograph on the <em>Astral Scalpel</em>.
My trust in M. de la Nox, and the criminal eccentricity of poor
Theophrastus, of which the ears of the wretched Signor Petito
had been the first victims and filled me with dread of irremediable
catastrophes, led me to consider the operation of the death of
Cartouche, in spite of its danger, the best course in these painful
circumstances.</p>

<p>"We carried the sleeping Theophrastus down into the basement,
into the psychical laboratory of the Mage, which is lighted night
and day by great hissing flames of a crimson gas of the nature
of which I am ignorant.</p>

<p>"We laid Theophrastus down on a camp-bed; and for more than a
quarter of an hour M. de la Nox gazed at him in a marvellous stillness.
We were silent. At last an admirable melody was heard. It was
the voice of M. de la Nox praying. Of what angelic music, of what
empyrean vibrations, of what syllables of heavenly glory and triumphant
love, was that prayer composed! Who shall ever repeat it? Who
shall ever re-compose it? Do you know the musician, incomparable
Master of sound, who shall re-compose, once they have passed,
the elements of that fragrant breeze of Spring which chants, for
the first time, under the first leaves, its trembling song of
hope and eternal life, on the threshold of the recurring seasons?</p>

<p>"I only know that that prayer began somewhat like this:</p>

<p>'In the beginning, you were Silence, Æon eternal, source of Æons!
Silent, as thou wert, was Eunoia, and ye contemplated one another
in an inexpressible embrace, Æon, source of Æons, Eunoia, source
of love, fruitful germ from which the Abyss should bring forth
life! In the beginning, you were the Silence, source of Æons!'...</p>

<p>"When the prayer came to an end, M. de la Nox took the hand of
Theophrastus and commanded him. But since the lips of M. de la
Nox did not move, since he commanded without speaking, and questioned
Theophrastus through the sole interpreter of his dominating will,
I only learnt what his commands and questions had been from the
answers of the sleeping Theophrastus.</p>

<p>"Theophrastus began without any apparent effort or suffering:</p>

<p>"'Yes; I see... Yes; I am...</p>

<p>"'.......................</p>

<p>"'I'm Theophrastus Longuet...</p>

<p>"'.......................</p>

<p>"'In a flat in Gerando Street...'</p>

<p>"M. de la Nox turned towards us, and said in a low voice: 'The
operation is not going well. I put Cartouche to sleep; and it
is Theophrastus who is answering. He is asleep in the Present.
It would be dangerous to be abrupt. I am going to let him move
about in <em>the Present</em> for a while.'</p>

<p>"Theophrastus began to speak again:</p>

<p>"'I'm in Gerando Street, in the flat above my own. I see stretched
on a bed an earless man. Facing him is a woman&mdash;a dark woman&mdash;young
and pretty&mdash;her name is Regina&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'.......................</p>

<p>"'The pretty young woman ... whose name is Regina ... is speaking
to the earless man ... She is saying:</p>

<p>"'"As sure as my name's Regina, you'll see no more of me, and
you'll never hear the 'Carnival of Venice' again, if in forty-eight
hours from now you haven't found some way of making a big enough
income to support me properly. When I married you, Signor Petito,
you deceived me shamefully about the amount of your fortune and
the character of your intelligence. A nice thing that fortune
of yours, Signor Petito! We're two quarters behind with the rent;
and unless we wish to lose our furniture, we must shoot the moon.
And as for your intelligence! Well, when a woman is young and
pretty like I am, she wants a husband with enough intelligence
to find the money to pay her dressmaker's bill. Am I to go back
to my mother, or are you going to do it?"</p>

<p>"'The earless man is speaking... He says:</p>

<p>"'"Oh, shut up, Regina, you're only making my head ache. Can't
you leave me in peace to discover the hiding-place of the treasures,
which the silly fool downstairs is incapable of getting out of
the earth?"</p>

<p>"'The silly fool,' said the sleeping Theophrastus, 'is Cartouche!'</p>

<p>"'I was waiting for that word,' said M. de la Nox quickly. 'Now
I can make him quit <em>the Present</em>! Pray, madame! pray,
my friend! the hour has come! <em>I am going to tempt Providence!</em>'</p>

<p>"Then, raising his hand above the brow of my sleeping friend,
he said in a voice of command impossible, utterly impossible,
to disobey: 'Cartouche, what were you doing at ten o'clock at
night on the First of April, 1721?'</p>

<p>"'At ten o'clock at night on the First of April, 1721,' said
the sleeping Theophrastus without a moment's hesitation, 'I tap
sharply twice on the door of the Queen Margot tavern... After
the row I should never have believed that I could have got so
easily to Ferronnerie Street... But I did for the horse of the
French Guard, or rather he fell down near the pump at Notre-Dame...
I have thrown my pursuers off my track... At the Queen Margot
I find Patapon, Saint James's Gate, and Black-mug... Pretty-Milkmaid
is with them... I tell them the story over a bottle of ratafia...
I trusted them; and I tell them that I suspect Old Easy-Going,
and perhaps Marie-Antoinette herself, of having whispered something
to the Police... They all protested... But I shout louder than
they; and they are quiet... I tell them that I have made up my
mind to deal faithfully with all those who give me any reason
to suspect them. I get into a fine rage... Pretty-Milkmaid says
that there's no longer any living with me... It's true that there's
no longer any living with me... But is it my fault?... Everybody
betrays me. I can't sleep two nights running in the same place...
Where are the days when I had all Paris on my side? The day of
my wedding with Marie-Antoinette? The day when at the Little Seal
tavern in Faubourg-Saint-Antoine Street, we sang in chorus:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Guzzle, cullies, and booze away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Gabriel's trump on Judgment Day!"

</p>
</div>
<p>We ate partridge that day&mdash;that was more than the King did&mdash;we
drank champagne. My beautiful Marie-Antoinette loved me dearly.
My Uncle and Aunt Tanton were there. And all that happiness was
only last May, the fifteenth of last May!... And now!... Where
is Uncle Tanton now? Shut up in the Châtelet... And his son?...
I had to kill him last month to prevent him denouncing me!...
I was quick about it... One pistol bullet at Montparnasse, and
the body in a ditch; and I was sure of his silence... But how
many more to kill?... How many more to kill to be sure of the
silence of all?... By the throttle of Madame Phalaris! I had to
kill Pepin, the Archer, and Huron the King's Deputy who were in
full cry after me one evening, and five archers besides whom I
massacred, poor beggars! in Mazarine Street... <em>I see their
five corpses still</em>... And yet I'm not at all bad-natured!...
I don't want to hurt anybody... I only ask one thing, to be allowed
to quietly police Paris, for everybody's security... My chief
councillor himself is grumbling. He doesn't forgive my executing
Jacques Lefebvre... Of course, there's no living with me any longer;
but it's only because I wish to live!</p>

<p>"'After that little talk I leave them... I look out of the door
of the Queen Margot: Ferronnerie Street is empty. I hurry off;
and near the Cemetery of the Innocents I meet Madeline... But
I don't tell her where I am going... As a matter of fact, I am
going to spend the night in my hole in Amelot Street[4] like a
wretched thief!... It's pouring with rain.'"</p>

[Footnote 4: In 1823, when they were cleaning the great sewer<br/>
under Amelot Street, they found near its principal mouth a recess,<br/>
a cave, about nine feet square which they still called, in the<br/>
Official Report, "Cartouche's chamber," because that robber had<br/>
often been obliged to spend the night in it. This is a long way<br/>
from the legend which represents Cartouche as living in the<br/>
best society and on the eve of marrying the daughter of a rich<br/>
nobleman, when he was arrested.]

</p>

<p>M. Adolphe Lecamus declares that he has given us the exact words
which came from the lips of Theophrastus in his hypnotic sleep,
but that he has not been able to give us the modulation of these
phrases, their strange tones, their sudden stops, their hurried
starts, and their often dolorous endings. He makes no attempt
to describe the physiognomy of Theophrastus. At times it expressed
anger, at times scorn, sometimes extravagant daring, sometimes
terror. Sometimes, he declares, at certain moving moments, <em>Theophrastus
was exactly like the portrait of Cartouche</em>.</p>

<p>M. de la Nox was desirous of bringing Cartouche to the hour of
his death by slow degrees. He feared the shock of making him abruptly
live it over again. Therefore he had taken him back to the First
of April, 1721.</p>

<p>The minutes which followed were exceedingly painful for us, as
the wretched Cartouche once more went through the agony of those
last months amid the perpetual treachery of his lieutenants and
the incredible, dogged animosity of the police.</p>

<p>The narrative of M. Lecamus, painful as it is, presents no new
fact. It merely corroborates history. There is, indeed, nothing
to be gained by descending to the laboratory of M. Eliphas de
la Nox to acquire a knowledge of the sensational arrest and imprisonment
in the Grand-Châtelet. We find in the Register of the Orders of
Committal of the King:</p>

<p>"May 16, 1721, Order of the King to seize and arrest one Cartouche,
who has murdered Sire Huron, Lieutenant of the Short Robe, and
one Tanton; and also Cartouche Cadet, called Louison; the Chevalier,
called Cracksman; and Fortier, called Mouchy, for complicity in
the murders."</p>

<p>On the margin against the name of Cartouche is written the single
word, "<em>Broken.</em>"</p>

<p>That arrest was much easier to order than to effect. It was not
till October 14, 1721, that treachery bore its fruit, and we can
read the report of Jean de Coustade, paymaster of the company
of Chabannes, forty-seven years old, twenty-seven years' service.</p>

<p>M. de Coustade took with him forty men and four sergeants, of
whose trustworthiness he was assured by Duchâtelet (Lieutenant
of Cartouche, who was betraying him, himself a sergeant of the
French Guards; they had promised him a pardon), dressed as civilians,
with their weapons hidden, and surrounded the house in which Duchâtelet
had informed him that Cartouche was lying. It was a little after
nine at night that they arrived at the Pistol Inn, kept by Germain
Savard and his wife, at Courtille, near High Borne (Trois-Bornes
Street).</p>

<p>Savard was smoking his pipe on his door-step; and Duchâtelet
said to him, "Is there anyone upstairs?"</p>

<p>"No," said Savard.</p>

<p>"Are the four ladies here?"</p>

<p>"Up you go!" said Savard, who was waiting for these words.</p>

<p>He stepped aside; and the whole troop dashed upstairs to attack
Cartouche.</p>

<p>"When we entered the chamber upstairs," writes M. Jean de Coustade
in his report, "we found Balagny and Limousin drinking wine in
front of the fire. Gaillard was in bed, and Cartouche sitting
on the side of the bed, mending his breeches. We threw ourselves
on him. The stroke was so unexpected that he had no time to make
any resistance. We bound him with thick ropes, took him first
to the house of the Secretary of State for War, and then, on foot,
to the Grand-Châtelet, as soon as the order was given."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the affair was by no means as simple as M.
de Coustade relates, though it ended as he says. In spite of his
short stature, Cartouche was of exceptional strength; and they
only overcame him and bound him to a pillar after a furious struggle.</p>

<p>At last, after all precautions had been taken, they put him in
a coach. He was in his shirt only; for he had not had time to
put on the breeches he was mending. Since they hustled him fiercely,
he said: "Look out, lads, you're ruffling my clothes!"</p>

<p>He had retained all his usual calm; and he congratulated the
lieutenant who had betrayed him on the fine clothes he was wearing
that day. In truth, Duchâtelet had come out dressed in a very
fine new black suit, on account of the death of the Duchess Marguerite
d'Orleans, who had died a fortnight before. On the way, as the
coach just missed crushing an unfortunate wayfarer, Cartouche
once more uttered the words of which he was so fond: "<em>We must
avoid the wheel!</em>"</p>

<p>From the house of the Secretary of State for War he went on foot
in the middle of a grand escort. Half the people of Paris rushed
out of their houses to see him pass, crying, "It's Cartouche!"
without any strong belief that it was. They had been deceived
so many times. But they perceived that it was true, when an officer
of the escort struck the prisoner with his cane, and the prisoner
turned quietly round and gave him a kick on the jaw with his left
foot, which sent him head over heels into the gutter. The crowd
applauded, for it has a great affection for robbers&mdash;when they
are taken.</p>

<p>In the Grand-Châtelet Prison Cartouche was visited by all the
Polite World. The Regent went out of his way to express his personal
regret at this sad event. "But," said he, "my sovereign duties
impose this unpleasant duty on me." The ladies of the Court vied
with one another in their attentions to the prisoner. They refused
him nothing. He had three pints of wine a day.</p>

<p>He had never been so much the fashion. At once a play was produced
entitled "Cartouche." Legrand, its author, and Quinault, who took
the principal part, came to ask him for information about details
of the production. At last, when Cartouche had sufficiently amused
himself, he turned his attention to escape. In spite of the unceasing
watch they kept on him, he was on the very point of success, having
got out of his cell and by means of a rope twisted from the straw
of his mattress, made his way down into a shop, when they caught
him as he was drawing the last bolt of a door which separated
him from the street. They found that the Grand-Châtelet was not
safe enough for a man of such ingenuity; and he was secretly carried
in chains to the Conciergerie, and imprisoned in the most secure
corner of Montgomery Tower.[5]</p>
