<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>A fine lace-work of mist lay over the salt meadows; the fairy
trilling of the little owl had ceased. Marsh-fowl were sleepily
astir; the last firefly floated low into the shrouded bushes and
its lamp glimmered a moment and went out.</p>

<p>Where the east was growing grey long lines of wild-ducks went
stringing out to sea; a few birds sang loudly in meadows still
obscure; cattle in foggy upland pastures were awake.</p>

<p>When the first cock-crow rang, cow-bells had been clanking for
an hour or more; the rising sun turned land and sea to palest
gold; every hedge and thicket became noisy with birds; bay-men
stepped spars and hoisted sail, and their long sweeps dripped
liquid fire as they pulled away into the blinding glory of the
east.</p>

<p>And Clive rose wearily from his window chair, care-worn and haggard,
with nothing determined, nothing solved of this new and imminent
peril which was already menacing Athalie with disgrace and threatening
him with that unwholesome notoriety which men usually survive
but under which a woman droops and perishes.</p>

<p>He bathed, dressed again, dully uneasy in the garments of yesterday,
uncomfortable for lack of fresh linen and toilet requisites; little
things indeed to add such undue weight to his depression. And
only yesterday he had laughed at inconvenience and had still found
charm to thrill him in the happy unconventionality of that day
and night.</p>

<p>Connor was already weeding in the garden when he went out; and
the dull surprise in the Irishman's sunburnt visage sent a swift
and painful colour into his own pallid face.</p>

<p>"Miss Greensleeve was kind enough to put me up last night," he
said briefly.</p>

<p>Connor stood silent, slowly combing the soil from the claw of
his weeder with work-worn fingers.</p>

<p>Clive said: "Since I have been coming down here to watch the
progress on Miss Greensleeve's house have you happened to notice
any strangers hanging about the grounds?"</p>

<p>Connor's grey eyes narrowed and became fixed on nothing.</p>

<p>Presently he nodded to himself:</p>

<p>"There was inquiries made, sorr, I'm minded now that ye mention
it."</p>

<p>"About me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sorr. There was strangers askin' f'r to know was it you
that owns the house or what."</p>

<p>"What was said?"</p>

<p>"I axed them would they chase themselves,&mdash;it being none o' their
business. 'Twas no satisfaction they had of me, Misther Bailey,
sorr."</p>

<p>"Who were they, Connor?"</p>

<p>"I just disremember now. Maybe there was a big wan and a little
wan.... Yes, sorr; there was two of them hangin' about on and
off these six weeks past, like they was minded to take a job and
then again not minded. Sure there was the two o' thim, now I think
of it. Wan was big and thin and wan was a little scutt wid a big
nose."</p>

<p>Clive nodded: "Keep them off the place, Connor. Keep all strangers
outside. Miss Greensleeve will be here for several days alone
and she must not be annoyed."</p>

<p>"Divil a bit, sorr."</p>

<p>"I want you and Mrs. Connor to sleep in the house for the present.
And I do not wish you to answer any questions from anybody concerning
either Miss Greensleeve or myself. Can I depend on you?"</p>

<p>"You can, sorr."</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it. Now, I'd like to have you go to the village
and buy me something to shave with and to comb my hair with. I
had not intended to remain here over night, but I did not care
to leave Miss Greensleeve entirely alone in the house."</p>

<p>"Sure, sorr, Jenny was fixed f'r to stay&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know. Miss Greensleeve told her she might go home. It was
a misunderstanding. But I want her to remain hereafter until Miss
Greensleeve's servants come from New York."</p>

<p>So Connor went away to the village and Clive seated himself on
a garden bench to wait.</p>

<p>Nothing stirred inside the house; the shades in Athalie's room
remained lowered.</p>

<p>He watched the chimney swifts soaring and darting above the house.
A faint dun-coloured haze crowned the kitchen chimney. Mrs. Connor
was already busy over their breakfast.</p>


<p>When the gardener returned with the purchases Clive went to his
room again and remained there busy until a knock on the door and
Mrs. Connor's hearty voice announced breakfast.</p>

<p>As he stepped out into the passage-way he met Athalie coming
from her room in a soft morning neglig√©e, and still yawning.</p>

<p>She bade him good morning in a sweet, sleepy voice, linked her
white, lace-clouded arm in his, glanced sideways at him, humorously
ashamed:</p>

<p>"I'm a disgrace," she said; "I could have slain Mrs. Connor when
she woke me. Oh, Clive, I <em>am</em> so sleepy!"</p>

<p>"Why did you get up?"</p>

<p>"My dear, I'm also hungry; that is why. I could scent the coffee
from afar. And you know, Clive, if you ever wish to hopelessly
alienate my affections, you have only to deprive me of my breakfast.
Tell me, did you get <em>any</em> sleep?"</p>

<p>He forced a smile: "I had sufficient."</p>

<p>"I wonder," she mused, looking at his somewhat haggard features.</p>

<p>They found the table prepared for them in the sun-parlour; Athalie
presided at the coffee urn, but became a trifle flushed and shy
when Mrs. Connor came in bearing a smoking cereal.</p>

<p>"I made a mistake in allowing you to go home," said the girl,
"so I thought it best for Mr. Bailey to remain."</p>

<p>"Sure I was that worritted," burst out Mrs. Connor, "I was minded
to come back&mdash;what with all the thramps and Dagoes hereabout,
and no dog on the place, and you alone; so I sez to my man Cornelius,&mdash;'Neil,'
sez I, 'it's not right,' sez I, 'f'r to be lavin' th' young lady&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Certainly," interrupted Clive quietly, "and you and Neil are
to sleep in the house hereafter until Miss Greensleeve's servants
arrive."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid," murmured Athalie, looking at him with lazy
amusement over the big, juicy peach she was preparing. But when
Mrs. Connor retired her expression changed.</p>

<p>"You dear fellow," she said, "You need not ever be worried about
me."</p>

<p>"I'm not, Athalie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive! Aren't you always going to be honest with me?"</p>

<p>"Why do you think I am anxious concerning you when Connor and
his wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dearest!"</p>

<p>"What?" He looked across at her where she was serenely preparing
his coffee; and when she had handed the cup to him she shook her
head, gravely, as though in gentle disapproval of some inward
thought of his.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked uneasily.</p>

<p>"You know already."</p>

<p>"What <em>is</em> it?" he repeated, reddening.</p>

<p>"Must <em>I</em> tell <em>you</em>, Clive?"</p>

<p>"I think you had better."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> should have told <em>me</em>, dear.... Don't ever
fear to tell me what concerns us both. Don't think that leaving
me in ignorance of unpleasant facts is any kindness to me. If
anything happens to cause you anxiety, I should feel humiliated
if you were left to endure it all alone."</p>


<p>He remained silent, troubled, uncertain as yet, how much she
knew of what had happened in the garden the night before.</p>

<p>"Clive, dear, don't let this thing spoil anything for us. I know
about it. Don't let any shadow fall upon this house of ours."</p>

<p>"You saw me last night in the garden."</p>

<p>Between diffidence and the candour that characterised her, she
hesitated; then:</p>

<p>"Dear, a very strange thing has happened. Until last night never
in all my life, try as I might, could I ever 'see clearly' anything
that concerned you. Never have I been able to 'find' you anywhere&mdash;even
when my need was desperate&mdash;when my heart seemed breaking&mdash;"</p>

<p>She checked herself, smiled at him; then her eyes grew dark and
thoughtful, and a deeper colour burned in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I'll try to tell you," she said. "Last night, after I left you,
I lay thinking about&mdash;love. And the&mdash;the new knowledge of myself
disconcerted me.... There remained a vague sense of dismay and&mdash;humiliation&mdash;"
She bent her head over her folded hands, silent until the deepening
colour subsided.</p>

<p>Still with lowered eyes she went on, steadily enough: "My instinct
was to escape &mdash;I don't know exactly how to tell this to
you, dear,&mdash;but the impulse to escape possessed me&mdash;and I felt
that I must rise from the lower planes and free myself from a&mdash;a
lesser passion&mdash;slip from the menace of its control&mdash;become clean
again of everything that is not of the spirit.... Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"So I rose and knelt down and said my prayers.... And asked to
be instructed because of my inexperience with&mdash;with these new
and deep&mdash;emotions. And then I lay down, very tranquil again,
leaving the burden with God.... All concern left me,&mdash;and the
restless sense of shame. I turned my head on the pillow and looked
out into the moonlight.... And, gently, naturally, without any
sense of effort, I left my body where it lay in the moonlight,
and&mdash;and found myself in the garden. Mother was there. You, also,
were there; and two men with you."</p>

<p>His eyes never left her face; and now she looked up at him with
a ghost of a smile:</p>

<p>"Mother spoke of the loveliness of the flowers. I heard her,
but I was listening to you. Then I followed you where you were
driving the two men from the grounds. I understood what had happened.
After you went into the house again my mother and I saw you watching
by your window. I was sorry that you were so deeply disturbed.</p>

<p>"Because what had occurred did not cause me any anxiety whatever."</p>

<p>"Do you mean," he said hoarsely, "that the probability of your
name being coupled with mine and dragged through the public mire
does not disconcert you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why not? Is it because your clairvoyance reassures you as to
the outcome of all this?"</p>

<p>"Dear," she said, gently, "I know no more of the outcome than
you do. I know nothing more concerning our future than do you&mdash;excepting,
only, that we shall journey toward it together, and through it
to the end, accomplishing the destiny which links us each to the
other.... I know no more than that."</p>

<p>"Then why are you so serene under the menace of this miserable
affair? For myself I care nothing; I'd thank God for a divorce
on any terms. But you&mdash;dearest&mdash;dearest! &mdash;I cannot endure
the thought of you entangled in such a shameful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where is the shame, Clive? The real shame, I mean. In me there
are two selves; neither have, as yet, been disgraced by any disobedience
of any law framed by men for women. Nor shall I break men's laws&mdash;under
which women are governed without their own consent&mdash;unless no
other road to our common destiny presents itself for me to follow."...
She smiled, watching his intent and sombre face:</p>

<p>"Don't fear for me, dear. I have come to understand what life
is, and I mean to live it, wholesomely, gloriously, uncrippled
in body and mind, unmaimed by folk-ways and by laws as ephemeral&mdash;"
she turned toward the open windows&mdash;"as those frail-winged things
that float in the sunshine above Spring Pond, yonder, born at
sunrise, and at sundown dead."</p>

<p>She laughed, leaning there on her dimpled elbows, stripping a
peach of its velvet skin:</p>

<p>"The judges of the earth,&mdash;and the power of them! &mdash;What
is it, dear, compared to the authority of love! To-day men have
their human will of men, judging, condemning, imprisoning, slaying,
as the moral fashion of the hour dictates. To-morrow folk-ways
change; judge and victim vanish along with fashions obsolete&mdash;both
alike, their brief reign ended.</p>

<p>"For judge and victim are awake at last; and in the twinkling
of an eye, the old world has become a memory or a shrine for those
tranquil pilgrims who return to worship for a while where love
lies sleeping.... And then return no more."</p>

<p>She rose, signed him to remain seated, came around to where he
sat, and perched herself on the arm of his chair.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind," she said, "I shall smooth out that troubled
crease between your eyebrows." And she encircled his head with
both arms, and laid her smooth hands across his forehead. Then
she touched his hair lightly, with her lips.</p>

<p>"We are great sinners," she murmured, "are we not, my darling?"</p>

<p>And drew his head against her breast.</p>

<p>"Of what am I robbing <em>her</em>, Clive? Of the power to humiliate
you, make you unhappy. It is an honest theft.</p>

<p>"What else am I stealing from her? Not love, not gratitude, not
duty, nothing of tenderness, nor of pride nor sympathy. I take
nothing, then, from her. She has nothing for me to steal&mdash;unless
it be the plain gold ring she never wears.... And I prefer a new
one&mdash;if, indeed, I am to wear one."</p>

<p>He said, deeply troubled, "How do you know she never wears a
ring?" And he turned and looked up at her over his shoulder. The
clear azure of her eyes was like a wintry sky.</p>

<p>"Clive, I know more than that. I know that your wife is in New
York."</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed, astonished.</p>

<p>"I have been aware of it for weeks," she said tranquilly.</p>

<p>He remained silent; she continued to caress his hair:</p>

<p>"Your wife," she went on thoughtfully, "will learn much when
she dies. There is a compulsory university course which awaits
us all,&mdash;a school with many forms and many grades and many, many
pupils. But we must die before we can be admitted.... I have never
before spoken to you as I have spoken to-day.... Perhaps I never
shall again.... The world is a blind place&mdash;lovely but blind.</p>

<p>"As for the woman who wears your name but wears no ring of yours
she has been moving through my crystal for many days; &mdash;I
would have made no effort to intrude on her had she not persisted
in the crystal, haunted it, &mdash;I cannot tell you why&mdash;only
that she is always there, now.... And last night I knew that she
was in New York, and why she had come here.... Shall you see her
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"At the Regina."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>The girl calmly closed her eyes for a moment. After a brief silence
she opened them: "She is still there.... She will awake in a little
while and ring for her breakfast. The two men you drove out of
the garden last night are waiting to see her. There is another
man there. I think he is your wife's attorney.... Have you decided
to see her?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You won't let what she may say about me trouble you, will you?"</p>

<p>"What will she say?" he asked with the na√Øve confidence of absolute
and childish faith.</p>

<p>Athalie laughed: "Darling! I don't know. I'm not a witch or a
sorceress. Did you think I was?&mdash;just because I can see a little
more clearly than you?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know what your limit might be," he answered, smiling
slightly, in spite of his deep anxiety.</p>

<p>"Then let me inform you at once. My eyes are better than many
people's. Also my <em>other</em> self can see. And with so clear
a vision, and with intelligence&mdash;and with a very true love and
reverence for God&mdash;somehow I seem to visualise what clairvoyance,
logic, and reason combine to depict for me.</p>

<p>"I used to be afraid that a picturesque and vivid imagination
coupled with a certain amount of clairvoyance might seduce me
to trickery and charlatanism.</p>

<p>"But if it be charlatanism for a paleontologist to construct
a fish out of a single fossil scale, then there may be something
of that ability in me. For truly, Clive, I am often at a loss
where to draw the line between what I see and what I reason out&mdash;between
my clairvoyance and my deductions. And if I made mistakes I certainly
should be deeply alarmed. But &mdash;I don't," she added, laughing.
"And so, in regard to those two men last night, and in regard
to what <em>she</em> and they may be about, I feel not the least
concern. And you must not. Promise me, dear."</p>

<p>But he rose, anxious and depressed, and stood silent for a few
moments, her hands clasped tightly in his.</p>

<p>For he could see no way out of it, now. His wife, once merely
indifferent, was beginning to evince malice. And what further
form that malice might take he could not imagine; for hitherto,
she had not desired divorce, and had not concerned herself with
him or his behaviour.</p>

<p>As for Athalie, it was now too late for him to step out of her
life. He might have been capable of the sacrifice if the pain
and unhappiness were to be borne by him alone&mdash;or even if he could
bring himself to believe or even hope that it might be merely
a temporary sorrow to Athalie.</p>

<p>But he could not mistake her, now; their cords of love and life
were irrevocably braided together; and to cut one was to sever
both. There could be no recovery from such a measure for either,
now.</p>

<p>What was he to do? The woman he had married had rejected his
loyalty from the very first, suffered none of his ideas of duty
to move her from her aloofness. She cared nothing for him, and
she let him know it; his notions of marriage, its duties and obligations
merely aroused in her contempt. And when he finally understood
that the only kindness he could do her was to keep his distance,
he had kept it. And what was he to do now? Granted that he had
brought it all upon himself, how was he to combat what was threatening
Athalie?</p>

<p>His wife had so far desired nothing of him, not even divorce.
He could not leave Athalie and he could not marry her. And now,
on her young head he had, somehow, loosened this avalanche, whatever
it was&mdash;a suit for separation, probably&mdash;which, if granted, would
leave him without his liberty, and Athalie disgraced. And even
suppose his wife desired divorce for some new and unknown reason.
The sinister advent of those men meant that Athalie would be shamefully
named in any such proceedings.</p>

<p>What was he to do? An ugly, hunted look came into his face and
he swung around and faced the girl beside him:</p>

<p>"Athalie," he said, "will you go away with me and let them howl?"</p>

<p>"Dearest, how silly. I'll stay <em>here</em> with you and let
them howl."</p>

<p>"I don't want you to face it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall not turn my back on it. Oh, Clive, there are so many
more important things than what people may say about us!"</p>

<p>"You can't defy the world!"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to, darling. But I may possibly shock a few of
the more orthodox parasites that infest it."</p>

<p>"No girl can maintain that attitude."</p>

<p>"A girl can try.... And, if law and malice force me to become
your mistress, malice and law may answer for it; not I!"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> shall have to answer for it."</p>

<p>"Dearest," she said with smiling tenderness, "you are still very,
very orthodox in your faith in folk-ways. That need not cause
<em>me</em> any concern, however. But, Clive, of the two pictures
which seems reasonable&mdash;your wife who is no wife; your mistress
who is more and is considered less?</p>

<p>"Don't think that I am speaking lightly of wifehood.... I desire
it as I desire motherhood. I was made for both. If the world will
let me I shall be both wife and mother. But if the world interferes
to stultify me, then, nevertheless I shall still be both, and
the law can keep the title it refuses me. I deny the right of
man to cripple, mar, render sterile my youth and womanhood. I
deny the right of the world to forbid me love, and its expression,
as long as I harm no one by loving. Clive, it would take a diviner
law than man's notions of divinity, to kill in me the right to
live and love and bring the living into life. And if I am forbidden
to do it in the name of the law, then I dare do it in the name
of One who never turned his back on little children&mdash;"</p>

<p>She ceased abruptly; and he saw her eyes suddenly blinded by
tears:</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive&mdash;if you only could have seen them&mdash;the little flower-like
faces and pleading arms around&mdash;my&mdash;neck&mdash;warm &mdash;Oh, sweet!&mdash;sweet
against my breast&mdash;"</p>
