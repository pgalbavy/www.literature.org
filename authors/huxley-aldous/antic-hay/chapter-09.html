<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Fan-shaped, blond, mounted on gauze and guaranteed undetectable,
it arrived from the wig-maker, preciously packed in a stout cardboard
box six times too large for it and accompanied by a quarter of
a pint of the choicest spirit gum. In the privacy of his bedroom
Gumbril uncoffined it, held it out for his own admiration, caressed
its silkiness and finally tried it on, holding it provisionally
to his chin, in front of the looking-glass. The effect, he decided
immediately, was stunning, was grandiose. From melancholy and
all too mild he saw himself transformed on the instant into a
sort of jovial Henry the Eighth, into a massive Rabelaisian man,
broad and powerful and exuberant with vitality and hair.</p>

<p>The proportions of his face were startlingly altered. The podium,
below the mouth, had been insufficiently massive to carry the
stately order of the nose; and the ratiocinative attic of the
forehead, noble enough, no doubt, in itself, had been disproportionately
high. The beard now supplied the deficiencies in the stylobate,
and planted now on a firm basement of will, the order of the senses,
the aerial attic of ideas, reared themselves with a more classical
harmoniousness of proportion. It only remained for him to order
from Mr. Bojanus an American coat, padded out at the shoulders
as squarely and heroically as a doublet of the Cinquecento, and
he would look the complete Rabelaisian man. Great eater, deep
drinker, stout fighter, prodigious lover; clear thinker, creator
of beauty, seeker of truth and prophet of heroic grandeurs. Fitted
out with coat and beard, he could qualify for the next vacancy
among the cœnobites of Thelema.</p>

<p>He removed his beard—"put his beaver up," as they used to say
in the fine old days of chivalry; he would have to remember that
little joke for Coleman’s benefit. He put his beaver up—ha, ha!—and
stared ruefully at the far from Rabelaisian figure which now confronted
him. The moustache—that was genuine enough—which had looked, in
conjunction with the splendid work of art below, so fierce and
manly, served by itself, he now perceived, only droopily to emphasize
his native mildness and melancholy.</p>

<p>It was a dismal affair, which might have belonged to Maurice
Barrès in youth; a slanting, flagging, sagging thing, such as
could only grow on the lip of an assiduous Cultivator of the Me,
and would become, as one grew older, ludicrously out of place
on the visage of a roaring Nationalist. If it weren’t that it
fitted in so splendidly with the beard, if it weren’t that it
became so marvellously different in the new context he had now
discovered for it, he would have shaved it off then and there.</p>

<p>Mournful appendage. But now he would transform it, he would add
to it its better half. Zadig’s quatrain to his mistress, when
the tablet on which it was written was broken in two, became a
treasonable libel on the king. So this moustache, thought Gumbril,
as gingerly he applied the spirit gum to his cheeks and chin,
this moustache which by itself serves only to betray me, becomes,
as soon as it is joined to its missing context, an amorous arm
for the conquest of the fair sex.</p>

<p>A little far-fetched, he decided; a little ponderous. And besides,
as so few people had read Zadig, not much use in conversation.
Cautiously and with neat, meticulous finger-tips he adjusted the
transformation to his gummed face, pressed it firmly, held it
while it stuck fast. The portals of Thelema opened before him;
he was free of those rich orchards, those halls and courts, those
broad staircases winding in noble spirals within the flanks of
each of the fair round towers. And it was Coleman who had pointed
out the way; he felt duly grateful. One last look at the Complete
Man, one final and definitive constatation that the Mild and Melancholy
one was, for the time at least, no more; and he was ready in all
confidence to set out. He selected a loose, light great-coat—not
that he needed a coat at all, for the day was bright and warm;
but until Mr. Bojanus had done his labour of padding he would
have to broaden himself out in this way, even if it did mean that
he might be uncomfortably hot. To fall short of Complete Manhood
for fear of a little inconvenience would be absurd. He slipped,
therefore, into his light coat—a toga, Mr. Bojanus called it,
a very neat toga in real West Country whipcord. He put on his
broadest and blackest felt hat, for breadth above everything was
what he needed to give him completeness, breadth of stature, breadth
of mind, breadth of human sympathy, breadth of smile, breadth
of humour, breadth of everything. The final touch was a massive
and antique Malacca cane belonging to his father. If he had possessed
a bulldog, he would have taken it out on a leash. But he did not.
He issued into the sunshine, unaccompanied.</p>

<p>But unaccompanied he did not mean to remain for long. These warm,
bright May days were wonderful days for being in love on. And
to be alone on such days was like a malady. It was a malady from
which the Mild and Melancholy Man suffered all too frequently.
And yet there were millions of superfluous women in the country;
millions of them. Every day, in the streets, one saw thousands
of them passing; and some were exquisite, were ravishing, the
only possible soul-mates. Thousands of unique soul-mates every
day. The Mild and Melancholy one allowed them to pass—for ever.
But to-day—to-day he was the complete and Rabelaisian man; he
was bearded to the teeth; the imbecile game was at its height;
there would be opportunities, and the Complete Man could know
how to take them. No, he would not be unaccompanied for long.</p>

<p>Outside in the square the fourteen plane trees glowed in their
young, unsullied green. At the end of every street the golden
muslin of the haze hung in an unwrinkled curtain that thinned
away above the sky’s gauzy horizon to transparent nothing against
the intenser blue. The dim, conch-like murmur that in a city is
silence seemed hazily to identify itself with the golden mistiness
of summer, and against this dim, wide background the yells of
the playing children detached themselves, distinct and piercing.
"Beaver" they shouted, "beaver!" and, "Is it cold up there?" Full
of playful menace, the Complete Man shook at them his borrowed
Malacca. He accepted their prompt hail as the most favourable
of omens.</p>

<p>At the first tobacconist’s Gumbril bought the longest cigar he
could find, and trailing behind him expiring blue wreaths of Cuban
smoke, he made his way slowly and with an ample swagger towards
the Park. It was there, under the elms, on the shores of the ornamental
waters, that he expected to find his opportunity, that he intended—how
confidently behind his Gargantuan mask!—to take it.</p>

<p>The opportunity offered itself sooner than he expected.</p>

<p>He had just turned into the Queen’s Road and was sauntering past
Whiteley’s with the air of one who knows that he has a right to
a good place, to two or three good places even, in the sun, when
he noticed just in front of him, peering intently at the New Season’s
Models, a young woman whom in his mild and melancholy days he
would have only hopelessly admired, but who now, to the Complete
Man, seemed a destined and accessible prey. She was fairly tall,
but seemed taller than she actually was, by reason of her remarkable
slenderness. Not that she looked disagreeably thin, far from it.
It was a rounded slenderness. The Complete Man decided to consider
her as tubular—flexible and tubular, like a section of boa constrictor,
should one say. She was dressed in clothes that emphasized this
serpentine slimness, in a close-fitting grey jacket that buttoned
up to the neck and a long, narrow grey skirt that came down to
her ankles. On her head was a small, sleek black hat, that looked
almost as though it were made of metal. It was trimmed on one
side with a bunch of dull golden foliage.</p>

<p>Those golden leaves were the only touch of ornament in all the
severe smoothness and unbroken tubularity of her person. As for
her face, that was neither strictly beautiful nor strictly ugly,
but combined elements of both beauty and ugliness into a whole
that was unexpected, that was oddly and somehow unnaturally attractive.</p>

<p>Pretending, he too, to take an interest in the New Season’s Models,
Gumbril made, squinting sideways over the burning tip of his cigar,
an inventory of her features. The forehead, that was mostly hidden
by her hat; it might be pensively and serenely high, it might
be of that degree of lowness which in men is villainous, but in
women is only another—a rather rustic one perhaps, rather <em>canaille</em>
even, but definitely another—attraction. There was no telling.
As for her eyes, they were green, and limpid; set wide apart in
her head they looked out from under heavy lids and through openings
that slanted up towards the outer corners. Her nose was slightly
aquiline. Her mouth was full-lipped, but straight and unexpectedly
wide. Her chin was small, round and firm. She had a pale skin,
a little flushed over the cheek-bones, which were prominent.</p>

<p>On the left cheek, close under the corner of the slanting eye,
she had a brown mole. Such hair as Gumbril could see beneath her
hat was pale and inconspicuously blond. When she had finished
looking at the New Season’s Models she moved slowly on, halting
for a moment before the travelling trunks and the fitted picnic
baskets; dwelling for a full minute over the corsets, passing
the hats, for some reason, rather contemptuously, but pausing,
which seemed strange, for a long pensive look at the cigars and
wine. As for the tennis rackets and cricket bats, the school outfits
and the gentleman’s hosiery—she hadn’t so much as a look for one
of them. But how lovingly she lingered before the boots and shoes!
Her own feet, the Complete Man noticed with satisfaction, had
an elegance of florid curves. And while other folk walked on neat’s
leather she was content to be shod with nothing coarser than mottled
serpent’s skin.</p>

<p>Slowly they drifted up Queen’s Road, lingering before every jeweller’s,
every antiquarian’s, every milliner’s on the way. The stranger
gave him no opportunity, and indeed, Gumbril reflected, how should
she? For the imbecile game on which he was relying is a travelling
piquet for two players, not a game of patience. No sane human
being could play it in solitude. He would have to make the opportunity
himself.</p>

<p>All that was mild in him, all that was melancholy, shrank with
a sickened reluctance from the task of breaking—with what consequences
delicious and perilous in the future or, in the case of the deserved
snub, immediately humiliating?—a silence which, by the tenth or
twelfth shop window, had become quite unbearably significant.
The Mild and Melancholy one would have drifted to the top of the
road, sharing, with that community of tastes which is the basis
of every happy union, her enthusiasm for brass candlesticks and
toasting-forks, imitation Chippendale furniture, gold watch-bracelets
and low-waisted summer frocks; would have drifted to the top of
the road and watched her, dumbly, disappearing for ever into the
green Park or along the blank pavements of the Bayswater Road;
would have watched her for ever disappear and then, if the pubs
had happened to be open, would have gone and ordered a glass of
port, and sitting at the bar would have savoured, still dumbly,
among the other drinkers, the muddy grapes of the Douro, and his
own unique loneliness.</p>

<p>That was what the Mild and Melancholy one would have done. But
the sight, as he gazed earnestly into an antiquary’s window, of
his own powerful bearded face reflected in a sham Heppelwhite
mirror, reminded him that the Mild and Melancholy one was temporarily
extinct, and that it was the Complete Man who now dawdled, smoking
his long cigar, up the Queen’s Road towards the Abbey of Thelema.</p>

<p>He squared his shoulders; in that loose toga of Mr. Bojanus’s
he looked as copious as François Premier. The time, he decided,
had come.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the reflection of the stranger’s face
joined itself in the little mirror, as she made a little movement
away from the Old Welsh dresser in the corner, to that of his
own. She looked at the spurious Heppelwhite. Their eyes met in
the hospitable glass. Gumbril smiled. The corners of the stranger’s
wide mouth seemed faintly to move; like petals of the magnolia,
her eyelids came slowly down over her slanting eyes. Gumbril turned
from the reflection to the reality.</p>

<p>"If you want to say Beaver," he said, "you may."</p>

<p>The Complete Man had made his first speech.</p>

<p>"I want to say nothing," said the stranger. She spoke with a
charming precision and distinctness, lingering with a pretty emphasis
on the <em>n</em> of nothing. "N—n—nothing"—it sounded rather
final. She turned away, she moved on.</p>

<p>But the Complete Man was not one to be put off by a mere ultimatum.
"There," he said, falling into step with her, "now I’ve had it—the
deserved snub. Honour is saved, prestige duly upheld. Now we can
get on with our conversation."</p>

<p>The Mild and Melancholy one stood by, gasping with astonished
admiration.</p>

<p>"You are v—very impertinent," said the stranger, smiling and
looking up from under the magnolia petals.</p>

<p>"It is in my character," said the Complete Man. "You mustn’t
blame me. One cannot escape from one’s heredity; that’s one’s
share of original sin."</p>

<p>"There is always grace," said the stranger.</p>

<p>Gumbril caressed his beard. "True," he replied.</p>

<p>"I advise you to pr—ray for it."</p>

<p>His prayer, the Mild and Melancholy one reflected, had already
been answered. The original sin in him had been self-corrected.</p>

<p>"Here is another antique shop," said Gumbril. "Shall we stop
and have a look at it?"</p>

<p>The stranger glanced at him doubtfully. But he looked quite serious.
They stopped.</p>

<p>"How revolting this sham cottage furniture is," Gumbril remarked.
The shop, he noticed, was called ‘Ye Olde Farme House.’</p>

<p>The stranger, who had been on the point of saying how much she
liked those lovely Old Welsh dressers, gave him her heartiest
agreement. "So v—vulgar."</p>

<p>"So horribly refined. So refined and artistic."</p>

<p>She laughed on a descending chromatic scale. This was excitingly
new. Poor Aunt Aggie with her Arts and Crafts, and her old English
furniture. And to think she had taken them so seriously! She saw
in a flash the fastidious lady that she now was—with Louis whatever-it-was
furniture at home, and jewels, and young poets to tea, and real
artists. In the past, when she had imagined herself entertaining
real artists, it had always been among really artistic furniture.
Aunt Aggie’s furniture. But now—no, oh no. This man was probably
an artist. His beard; and that big black hat. But not poor; very
well dressed.</p>

<p>"Yes, it’s funny to think that there are people who call that
sort of thing artistic. One’s quite s—sorry for them," she added,
with a little hiss.</p>

<p>"You have a kind heart," said Gumbril. "I’m glad to see that."</p>

<p>"Not v—very kind, I’m af—fraid." She looked at him sideways,
and significantly as the fastidious lady would have looked at
one of the poets.</p>

<p>"Well, kind enough, I hope," said the Complete Man. He was delighted
with his new acquaintance.</p>

<p>Together they disembogued into the Bayswater Road. It was here,
Gumbril reflected, that the Mild and Melancholy one would dumbly
have slunk away to his glass of port and his loneliness among
the alien topers at the bar. But the Complete Man took his new
friend by the elbow, and steered her into the traffic. Together
they crossed the road, together entered the park.</p>

<p>"I still think you are v—very impertinent," said the lady. "What
induced you to follow me?"</p>

<p>With a single comprehensive gesture, Gumbril indicated the sun,
the sky, the green trees airily glittering, the grass, the emerald
lights and violet shadows of the rustic distance. "On a day like
this," he said, "how could I help it?"</p>

<p>"Original sin?"</p>

<p>"Oh," the Complete Man modestly shook his head, "I lay no claim
to originality in this."</p>

<p>The stranger laughed. This was nearly as good as a young poet
at the tea-table. She was very glad that she’d decided, after
all, to put on her best suit this afternoon, even if it was a
little stuffy for the warmth of the day. He, too, she noticed,
was wearing a great-coat; which seemed rather odd.</p>

<p>"Is it original," he went on, "to go and tumble stupidly like
an elephant into a pitfall, head over ears, at first sight...?"</p>

<p>She looked at him sideways, then closed down the magnolia petals,
and smiled. This was going to be the real thing—one of those long,
those interminable, or, at any rate, indefinitely renewable conversations
about love; witty, subtle, penetrating and bold, like the conversations
in books, like the conversations across the tea-table between
brilliant young poets and ladies of quality, grown fastidious
through an excessive experience, fastidious and a little weary,
but still, in their subtle way, insatiably curious.</p>

<p>"Suppose we sit down," suggested Gumbril, and he pointed to a
couple of green iron chairs, standing isolated in the middle of
the grass close together and with their fronts slanting inwards
a little towards one another in a position that suggested a confidential
intimacy. At the prospect of the conversation that, inevitably,
was about to unroll itself, he felt decidedly less elated than
did his new friend. If there was anything he disliked it was conversations
about love. It bored him, oh, it bored him most horribly, this
minute analysis of the passion that young women always seemed
to expect one, at some point or other in one’s relation with them,
to make. How love alters the character for both good and bad;
how physical passion need not be incompatible with the spiritual;
how a hateful and tyrannous possessiveness can be allied in love
with the most unselfish solicitude for the other party—oh, he
knew all this and much more, so well, so well. And whether one
can be in love with more than one person at a time, whether love
can exist without jealousy, whether pity, affection, desire can
in any way replace the full and genuine passion—how often he had
had to thrash out these dreary questions!</p>

<p>And all the philosophic speculations were equally familiar, all
the physiological and anthropological and psychological facts.
In the theory of the subject he had ceased to take any interest.
Unhappily, a discussion of the theory always seemed to be an essential
preliminary to the practice of it. He sighed a little wearily
as he took his seat on the green iron chair. But then, recollecting
that he was now the Complete Man, and that the Complete Man must
do everything with a flourish and a high hand, he leaned forward
and, smiling with a charming insolence through his beard, began:</p>

<p>"Tiresias, you may remember, was granted the singular privilege
of living both as a man and a woman."</p>

<p>Ah, this was the genuine young poet. Supporting an elbow on the
back of her chair and leaning her cheek against her hand, she
disposed herself to listen and, where necessary, brilliantly to
interpellate; it was through half-closed eyes that she looked
at him, and she smiled faintly in a manner which she knew, from
experience, to be enigmatic, and though a shade haughty, though
a tiny bit mocking and ironical, exceedingly attractive.</p>

<p>An hour and a half later they were driving towards an address
in Bloxam Gardens, Maida Vale. The name seemed vaguely familiar
to Gumbril. Bloxam Gardens—perhaps one of his aunts had lived
there once?</p>

<p>"It’s a dr—dreadful little maisonnette," she explained. "Full
of awful things. We had to take it furnished. It’s so impossible
to find anything now."</p>

<p>Gumbril leaned back in his corner, wondering, as he studied that
averted profile, who or what this young woman could be. She seemed
to be in the obvious movement, to like the sort of things one
would expect people to like; she seemed to be as highly civilized,
in Mr. Mercaptan’s rather technical sense of the term, as free
of all prejudices as the great exponent of civilization himself.</p>

<p>She seemed, from her coolly dropped hints, to possess all the
dangerous experience, all the assurance and easy ruthlessness
of a great lady whose whole life is occupied in the interminable
affairs of the heart, the senses and the head. But, by a strange
contradiction she seemed to find her life narrow and uninteresting.
She had complained in so many words that her husband misunderstood
and neglected her, had complained, by implication, that she knew
very few interesting people.</p>

<p>The maisonnette in Bloxam Gardens was certainly not very splendid—six
rooms on the second and third floors of a peeling stucco house.
And the furniture—decidedly Hire Purchase. And the curtains and
cretonnes—brightly ‘modern,’ positively ‘futurist.’</p>

<p>"What one has to put up with in furnished flats!" The lady made
a grimace as she ushered him into the sitting-room. And while
she spoke the words, she really managed to persuade herself that
the furniture wasn’t theirs, that they had found all this sordid
stuff cluttering up the rooms, not chosen it, oh with pains! themselves,
not doggedly paid for it, month by month.</p>

<p>"Our own things," she murmured vaguely, "are stored. In the Riviera."
It was there, under the palms, among the gaudy melon flowers and
the croupiers that the fastidious lady had last held her salon
of young poets. In the Riviera—that would explain, now she came
to think of it, a lot of things, if explanation ever became necessary.</p>

<p>The Complete Man nodded sympathetically. "Other people’s tastes,"
he held up his hands, they both laughed. "But why do we think
of other people?" he added. And coming forward with a conquering
impulsiveness he took both her long, fine hands in his and raised
them to his bearded mouth.</p>

<p>She looked at him for a second, then dropped her eyelids, took
back her hands. "I must go and make the tea," she said. "The servants"—the
plural was a pardonable exaggeration—"are out."</p>

<p>Gallantly, the Complete Man offered to come and help her. These
scenes of intimate life had a charm all their own. But she would
not allow it. "No, no," she was very firm, "I simply forbid you.
You must stay here. I won’t be a moment," and she was gone, closing
the door carefully behind her.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Gumbril sat down and filed his nails.</p>

<p>As for the young lady, she hurried along to her dingy little
kitchen, lit the gas, put the kettle on, set out the teapot and
the cups on a tray, and from the biscuit-box, where it was stored,
took out the remains of a chocolate cake, which had already seen
service at the day-before-yesterday’s tea-party. When all was
ready here, she tiptoed across to her bedroom and sitting down
at her dressing-table, began with hands that trembled a little
with excitement to powder her nose, and heighten the colour of
her cheeks. Even after the last touch had been given, she still
sat there, looking at her image in the glass.</p>

<p>The lady and the poet, she was thinking, the <em>grande dame</em>
and the brilliant young man of genius. She liked young men with
beards. But he was not an artist, in spite of the beard, in spite
of the hat. He was a writer of sorts. So she gathered; but he
was reticent, he was delightfully mysterious. She too, for that
matter. The great lady slips out, masked, into the street; touches
the young man’s sleeve: Come with me. She chooses, does not let
herself passively be chosen. The young poet falls at her feet;
she lifts him up. One is accustomed to this sort of thing.</p>

<p>She opened her jewel box, took out all her rings—there were not
many of them, alas!—and put them on. Two or three of them, on
second thoughts, she took off again; they were a little, she suspected
with a sudden qualm, in other people’s taste.</p>

<p>He was very clever, very artistic—only that seemed to be the
wrong word to use; he seemed to know all the new things, all the
interesting people. Perhaps he would introduce her to some of
them. And he was so much at ease behind his knowledge, so well
assured. But for her part, she felt pretty certain, she had made
no stupid mistakes. She too had been, had looked at any rate—which
was the important thing—very much at ease.</p>

<p>She liked young men with beards. They looked so Russian. Catherine
of Russia had been one of the great ladies with caprices. Masked
in the streets. Young poet, come with me. Or even, Young butcher’s
boy. But that, no, that was going too far, too low. Still, life,
life—it was there to be lived—life—to be enjoyed. And now, and
now? She was still wondering what would happen next, when the
kettle, which was one of those funny ones which whistle when they
come to the boil, began, fitfully, at first, then, under full
steam, unflaggingly, to sound its mournful, other-worldly note.
She sighed and bestirred herself to attend to it.</p>

<p>"Let me help you." Gumbril jumped up as she came into the room.
"What can I do?" He hovered rather ineptly round her.</p>

<p>The lady put down her tray on the little table. "N—nothing,"
she said.</p>

<p>"N—nothing?" he imitated her with a playful mockery. "Am I good
for n—nothing at all?" He took one of her hands and kissed it.</p>

<p>"Nothing that’s of the l—least importance." She sat down and
began to pour out the tea.</p>

<p>The Complete Man also sat down. "So to adore at first sight,"
he asked, "is not of the l—least importance?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, smiled, raised and lowered her eyelids. One
was so well accustomed to this sort of thing; it had no importance.
"Sugar?" she asked. The young poet was safely there, sparkling
across the tea-table. He offered love and she, with the easy heartlessness
of one who is so well accustomed to this sort of thing, offered
him sugar.</p>

<p>He nodded. "Please. But if it’s of no importance to you," he
went on, "then I’ll go away at once."</p>

<p>The lady laughed her section of a descending chromatic scale.
"Oh no, you won’t," she said. "You can’t." And she felt that the
<em>grande dame</em> had made a very fine stroke.</p>

<p>"Quite right," the Complete Man replied; "I couldn’t." He stirred
his tea. "But who are you," he looked up at her suddenly, "you
devilish female?" He was genuinely anxious to know; and besides,
he was paying her a very pretty compliment. "What do you do with
your dangerous existence?"</p>

<p>"I enjoy life," she said. "I think one ought to enjoy life. Don’t
you? I think it’s one’s first duty." She became quite grave. "One
ought to enjoy every moment of it," she said. "Oh, passionately,
adventurously, newly, excitingly, uniquely."</p>

<p>The Complete Man laughed. "A conscientious hedonist. I see."</p>

<p>She felt uncomfortably that the fastidious lady had not quite
lived up to her character. She had spoken more like a young woman
who finds life too dull and daily, and would like to get on to
the cinema. "I am very conscientious," she said, making significant
play with the magnolia petals and smiling her riddling smile.
She must retrieve the Great Catherine’s reputation.</p>

<p>"I could see that from the first," mocked the Complete Man with
a triumphant insolence. "Conscience doth make cowards of us all."</p>

<p>The fastidious lady only contemptuously smiled. "Have a little
chocolate cake," she suggested. Her heart was beating. She wondered,
she wondered.</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Gumbril finished his chocolate cake,
gloomily drank his tea and did not speak. He found, all at once,
that he had nothing to say. His jovial confidence seemed, for
the moment, to have deserted him. He was only the Mild and Melancholy
one foolishly disguised as a Complete Man; a sheep in beaver’s
clothing. He entrenched himself behind his formidable silence
and waited; waited, at first, sitting in his chair, then, when
this total inactivity became unbearable, striding about the room.</p>

<p>She looked at him, for all her air of serene composure, with
a certain disquiet. What on earth was he up to now? What could
he be thinking about? Frowning like that, he looked like a young
Jupiter, bearded and burly (though not, she noticed, quite so
burly as he had appeared in his overcoat) making ready to throw
a thunderbolt. Perhaps he was thinking of her—suspecting her,
seeing through the fastidious lady and feeling angry at her attempted
deception. Or perhaps he was bored with her, perhaps he was wanting
to go away. Well, let him go; she didn’t mind. Or perhaps he was
just made like that—a moody young poet; that seemed, on the whole,
the most likely explanation; it was also the most pleasing and
romantic. She waited. They both waited.</p>

<p>Gumbril looked at her and was put to shame by the spectacle of
her quiet serenity. He must do something, he told himself; he
must recover the Complete Man’s lost <em>morale</em>. Desperately
he came to a halt in front of the one decent picture hanging on
the walls. It was an eighteenth-century engraving of Raphael’s
‘Transfiguration’—better, he always thought, in black and white
than in its bleakly-coloured original.</p>

<p>"That’s a nice engraving," he said. "Very nice." The mere fact
of having uttered at all was a great comfort to him, a real relief.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "That belongs to me. I found it in a second-hand
shop, not far from here."</p>

<p>"Photography," he pronounced, with that temporary earnestness
which made him seem an enthusiast about everything, "is a mixed
blessing. It has made it possible to reproduce pictures so easily
and cheaply, that all the bad artists who were well occupied in
the past, making engravings of good men’s paintings, are now free
to do bad original work of their own." All this was terribly impersonal,
he told himself, terribly off the point. He was losing ground.
He must do something drastic to win it back. But what?</p>

<p>She came to his rescue. "I bought another at the same time,"
she said. "‘The Last Communion of St. Jerome,’ by—who is it? I
forget."</p>

<p>"Ah, you mean Domenichino’s ‘St. Jerome’?" The Complete Man was
afloat again. "Poussin’s favourite picture. Mine too, very nearly.
I’d like to see that."</p>

<p>"It’s in my room, I’m afraid. But if you don’t mind."</p>

<p>He bowed. "If <em>you</em> don’t."</p>

<p>She smiled graciously to him and got up. "This way," she said,
and opened the door.</p>

<p>"It’s a lovely picture," Gumbril went on, loquaciously now, behind
her, as they walked down the dark corridor. "And besides, I have
a sentimental attachment to it. There used to be a copy of an
engraving of it at home, when I was a child. And I remember wondering
and wondering—oh, it went on for years—every time I saw the picture;
wondering why on earth that old bishop (for I did know it was
a bishop) should be handing the naked old man a five-shilling
piece."</p>

<p>She opened a door; they were in her very pink room. Grave in
its solemn and subtly harmonious beauty, the picture hung over
the mantelpiece, hung there, among the photographs of the little
friends of her own age, like some strange object from another
world. From within that chipped gilt frame all the beauty, all
the grandeur of religion looked darkly out upon the pink room.
The little friends of her own age, all deliciously nubile, sweetly
smiled, turned up their eyes, clasped Persian cats or stood jauntily,
feet apart, hand in the breeches pocket of the land-girl’s uniform;
the pink roses on the wallpaper, the pink and white curtains,
the pink bed, the strawberry-coloured carpet, filled all the air
with the rosy reflections of nakedness and life.</p>

<p>And utterly remote, absorbed in their grave, solemn ecstasy,
the robed and mitred priest held out, the dying saint yearningly
received, the body of the Son of God. The ministrants looked gravely
on, the little angels looped in the air above a gravely triumphant
festoon, the lion slept at the saint’s feet, and through the arch
beyond, the eye travelled out over a quiet country of dark trees
and hills.</p>

<p>"There it is," she waved towards the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>But Gumbril had taken it all in long ago. "You see what I mean
by the five-shilling piece." And stepping up to the picture, he
pointed to the round bright wafer which the priest holds in his
hand and whose averted disk is like the essential sun at the centre
of the picture’s harmonious universe. "Those were the days of
five-shilling pieces," he went on. "You’re probably too young
to remember those large, lovely things. They came my way occasionally,
and consecrated wafers didn’t. So you can understand how much
the picture puzzled me. A bishop giving a naked old man five shillings
in a church, with angels fluttering overhead, and a lion sleeping
in the foreground. It was obscure, it was horribly obscure." He
turned away from the picture and confronted his hostess, who was
standing a little way behind him smiling enigmatically and invitingly.</p>

<p>"Obscure," he repeated. "But so is everything. So is life in
general. And you," he stepped towards her, "you in particular."</p>

<p>"Am I?" she lifted her limpid eyes at him. Oh, how her heart
was beating, how hard it was to be the fastidious lady, calmly
satisfying her caprice. How difficult it was to be accustomed
to this sort of thing. What was going to happen next?</p>

<p>What happened next was that the Complete Man came still closer,
put his arms round her, as though he were inviting her to the
fox-trot, and began kissing her with a startling violence. His
beard tickled her neck; shivering a little, she brought down the
magnolia petals across her eyes. The Complete Man lifted her up,
walked across the room carrying the fastidious lady in his arms
and deposited her on the rosy catafalque of the bed. Lying there
with her eyes shut, she did her best to pretend she was dead.</p>

<p>Gumbril had looked at his wrist watch and found that it was six
o’clock. Already? He prepared himself to take his departure. Wrapped
in a pink kimono, she came out into the hall to wish him farewell.</p>

<p>"When shall I see you again, Rosie?" He had learnt that her name
was Rosie.</p>

<p>She had recovered her great lady’s equanimity and detachment,
and was able to shrug her shoulders and smile. "How should I know?"
she asked, implying that she could not foresee what her caprice
might be an hour hence.</p>

<p>"May I write then, and ask one of these days if you do know?"</p>

<p>She put her head on one side and raised her eyebrows, doubtfully.
At last nodded. "Yes, you can write," she permitted.</p>

<p>"Good," said the Complete Man, and picked up his wide hat. She
held out her hand to him with stateliness, and with a formal gallantry
he kissed it. He was just closing the front door behind him, when
he remembered something. He turned round. "I say," he called after
the retreating pink kimono. "It’s rather absurd. But how can I
write? I don’t know your name. I can’t just address it ‘Rosie’"</p>

<p>The great lady laughed delightedly. This had the real <em>capriccio</em>
flavour. "Wait," she said, and she ran into the sitting-room.
She was back again in a moment with an oblong of pasteboard. "There,"
she said, and dropped it into his great-coat pocket. Then blowing
a kiss she was gone.</p>

<p>The Complete Man closed the door and descended the stairs. Well,
well, he said to himself; well, well. He put his hand in his coat
pocket and took out the card. In the dim light of the staircase
he read the name on it with some difficulty. Mrs. James—but no,
but no. He read again, straining his eyes; there was no question
of it. Mrs. James Shearwater.</p>

<p>Mrs. James Shearwater.</p>

<p>That was why he had vaguely known the name of Bloxam Gardens.</p>

<p>Mrs. James Shear——. Step after step he descended, ponderously.
"Good Lord," he said out loud. "Good Lord."</p>

<p>But why had he never seen her? Why did Shearwater never produce
her? Now he came to think of it, he hardly ever spoke of her.</p>

<p>Why had she said the flat wasn’t theirs? It was; he had heard
Shearwater talk about it.</p>

<p>Did she make a habit of this sort of thing!</p>

<p>Could Shearwater be wholly unaware of what she was really like?
But, for that matter, what <em>was</em> she really like?</p>

<p>He was half-way down the last flight, when with a rattle and
a squeak of hinges the door of the house, which was only separated
by a short lobby from the foot of the stairs, opened, revealing,
on the doorstep, Shearwater and a friend, eagerly talking.</p>

<p>"... I take my rabbit," the friend was saying—he was a young
man with dark, protruding eyes, and staring, doggy nostrils; very
eager, lively and loud. "I take my rabbit and I inject into it
the solution of eyes, pulped eyes of another dead rabbit. You
see?"</p>

<p>Gumbril’s first instinct was to rush up the stairs and hide in
the first likely-looking corner. But he pulled himself together
at once. He was a Complete Man, and Complete Men do not hide;
moreover, he was sufficiently disguised to be quite unrecognizable.
He stood where he was, and listened to the conversation.</p>

<p>"The rabbit," continued the young man, and with his bright eyes
and staring, sniffing nose, he looked like a poacher’s terrier
ready to go barking after the first white tail that passed his
way; "the rabbit naturally develops the appropriate resistance,
develops a specific anti-eye to protect itself. I then take some
of its anti-eye serum and inject it into my female rabbit; I then
immediately breed from her." He paused.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Shearwater, in his slow, ponderous way. He lifted
his great round head inquiringly and looked at the doggy young
man from under his bushy eyebrows.</p>

<p>The doggy young man smiled triumphantly. "The young ones," he
said, emphasizing his words by striking his right fist against
the extended palm of his left hand, "the young ones are born with
defective sight."</p>

<p>Thoughtfully Shearwater pulled at his formidable moustache. "H’m,"
he said slowly. "Very remarkable."</p>

<p>"You realize the full significance of it?" asked the young man.
"We seem to be effecting the germ-plasm directly. We have found
a way of making acquired characteristics...."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said Gumbril. He had decided that it was time to
be gone. He ran down the stairs and across the tiled hall, he
pushed his way firmly but politely between the talkers.</p>

<p>"... heritable," continued the young man, imperturbably eager,
speaking through and over and round the obstacle.</p>

<p>"Damn!" said Shearwater. The Complete Man had trodden on his
toe. "Sorry," he added, absent-mindedly apologizing for the injury
he had received.</p>

<p>Gumbril hurried off along the street. "If we really have found
out a technique for influencing the germ-plasm directly ..." he
heard the doggy young man saying; but he was already too far away
to catch the rest of the sentence. There are many ways, he reflected,
of spending an afternoon.</p>

<p>The doggy young man refused to come in, he had to get in his
game of tennis before dinner. Shearwater climbed the stairs alone.
He was taking off his hat in the little hall of his own apartment,
when Rosie came out of the sitting-room with a trayful of tea-things.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked, kissing her affectionately on the forehead.
"Well? People to tea?"</p>

<p>"Only one," Rosie replied. "I’ll go and make you a fresh cup."</p>

<p>She glided off, rustling in her pink kimono towards the kitchen.</p>

<p>Shearwater sat down in the sitting-room. He had brought home
with him from the library the fifteenth volume of the <em>Biochemical
Journal</em>. There was something in it he wanted to look up.
He turned over the pages. Ah, here it was. He began reading. Rosie
came back again.</p>

<p>"Here’s your tea," she said.</p>

<p>He thanked her without looking up. The tea grew cold on the little
table at his side.</p>

<p>Lying on the sofa, Rosie pondered and remembered. Had the events
of the afternoon, she asked herself, really happened? They seemed
very improbable and remote, now, in this studious silence. She
couldn’t help feeling a little disappointed. Was it only this?
So simple and obvious? She tried to work herself up into a more
exalted mood. She even tried to feel guilty; but there she failed
completely. She tried to feel rapturous; but without much more
success. Still, he certainly had been a most extraordinary man.
Such impudence, and at the same time such delicacy and tact.</p>

<p>It was a pity she couldn’t afford to change the furniture. She
saw now that it wouldn’t do at all. She would go and tell Aunt
Aggie about the dreadful middle-classness of her Art and Craftiness.</p>

<p>She ought to have an Empire <em>chaise longue</em>. Like Madame
Récamier. She could see herself lying there, dispensing tea. "Like
a delicious pink snake." He had called her that.</p>

<p>Well, really, now she came to think of it all again, it had been
too queer, too queer.</p>

<p>"What’s a hedonist?" she suddenly asked.</p>

<p>Shearwater looked up from the <em>Journal of Biochemistry</em>.
"What?" he said.</p>

<p>"A hedonist."</p>

<p>"A man who holds that the end of life is pleasure."</p>

<p>A ‘conscientious hedonist’—ah, that was good.</p>

<p>"This tea is cold," Shearwater remarked.</p>

<p>"You should have drunk it before," she said. The silence renewed
and prolonged itself.</p>

<p>Rosie was getting much better, Shearwater reflected, as he washed
his hands before supper, about not interrupting him when he was
busy. This evening she had really not disturbed him at all, or
at most only once, and that not seriously. There had been times
in the past when the child had really made life almost impossible.
There were those months at the beginning of their married life,
when she had thought she would like to study physiology herself
and be a help to him. He remembered the hours he had spent trying
to teach her elementary facts about the chromosomes. It had been
a great relief when she abandoned the attempt. He had suggested
she should go in for stencilling patterns on Government linen.
Such pretty curtains and things one could make like that. But
she hadn’t taken very kindly to the idea. There had followed a
long period when she seemed to have nothing to do but prevent
him from doing anything. Ringing him up at the laboratory, invading
his study, sitting on his knee, or throwing her arms round his
neck, or pulling his hair, or asking ridiculous questions when
he was trying to work.</p>

<p>Shearwater flattered himself that he had been extremely patient.
He had never got cross. He had just gone on as though she weren’t
there. As though she weren’t there.</p>

<p>"Hurry up," he heard her calling. "The soup’s getting cold."</p>

<p>"Coming," he shouted back, and began to dry his large, blunt
hands.</p>

<p>She seemed to have been improving lately. And to-night, to-night
she had been a model of non-existence.</p>

<p>He came striding heavily into the dining-room. Rosie was sitting
at the head of the table, ladling out the soup. With her left
hand she held back the flowing pink sleeve of her kimono so that
it should not trail in the plates or the tureen. Her bare arm
showed white and pearly through the steam of lentils.</p>

<p>How pretty she was! He could not resist the temptation, but coming
up behind her bent down and kissed her, rather clumsily, on the
back of her neck.</p>

<p>Rosie drew away from him. "Really, Jim," she said, disapprovingly.
"At meal-times!" The fastidious lady had to draw the line at these
ill-timed, tumbling familiarities.</p>

<p>"And what about work-times?" Shearwater asked laughing. "Still,
you were wonderful this evening, Rosie, quite wonderful." He sat
down and began eating his soup. "Not a sound all the time I was
reading; or, at any rate, only one sound, so far as I remember."</p>

<p>The great lady said nothing, but only smiled—a little contemptuously
and with a touch of pity. She pushed away the plate of soup unfinished
and planted her elbows on the table. Slipping her hands under
the sleeves of her kimono, she began, lightly, delicately, with
the tips of her fingers, to caress her own arms.</p>

<p>How smooth they were, how soft and warm and how secret under
the sleeves. And all her body was as smooth and warm, was as soft
and secret, still more secret beneath the pink folds. Like a warm
serpent hidden away, secretly, secretly. </p>
