<p>The First Serious Engagement&mdash;Loss of the Philadelphia &mdash;The
Scheme of Captain Bainbridge &mdash;Exploit of Lieutenant Decatur.</p>

<p>Andrew Sterrett was executive officer of the <em>Constellation</em>,
which captured the French frigate <em>L'Insurgente</em>, in 1799,
and <em>La Vengeance</em>, in 1800. It fell to his lot, while
in command of the <em>Enterprise</em>, a vessel of 12 guns, to
have the first serious fight in the war with Tripoli. When off
Malta, he met a Tripolitan vessel of 14 guns, and they fought
furiously for two hours, at the end of which time the enemy hauled
down his flag. The Americans left their guns and broke into cheers,
whereupon the Tripolitan fired a broadside. Nothing loath, Lieutenant
Sterrett resumed the battle. The Tripolitans ran in close and
attempted to board, but were repulsed, and, under the fierce fire
of the <em>Enterprise</em>, they again hauled down their flag.</p>

<p>"I guess they mean it this time," remarked Lieutenant Sterrett,
but the words were hardly spoken when the enemy let fly with another
broadside.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, this exhausted the patience of the American
commander. He ordered his men to their guns, and mentally resolved
to finish the job without fail. Circling round his antagonist,
he raked her from stem to stern, shot away the mizzen mast, made
a sieve of the hull and killed and wounded fifty men. He was still
at it, when, through the smoke, he caught sight of the swarthy
captain, leaping up and down on the deck, swinging his arms and
shrieking in broken English that he had surrendered. To show he
was in earnest, he flung his colors overboard.</p>

<p>"Now throw your guns and powder after your flag," shouted Sterrett.</p>

<p>He was promptly obeyed; and, resolved to take no chances, Sterrett
then compelled him to cut away his masts, after which he was permitted
to rig a jury mast and a single sail.</p>

<p>"Now go home to your Dey," said his conqueror, "and give him
my compliments."</p>

<p>Not a man was killed on board the <em>Enterprise</em>, though,
as has been shown, the loss of the enemy was severe.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>CAPTAIN WILLIAM BAINBRIDGE</em>.]</p>

<p>The American squadron in that part of the world was increased,
and a number of engagements took place, with the advantage invariably
on the side of our countrymen. By the opening of 1803 there were
nine of our ships, carrying two hundred and fourteen guns, in
the Mediterranean waters. The fine frigate <em>Philadelphia</em>
captured a Moorish cruiser upon which were found papers signed
by the Governor of Tangier authorizing the commander to destroy
American commerce. Commodore Preble sailed into the harbor and
demanded an explanation of the emperor. He denied having given
any such authority to his subordinate, and in making his denial
undoubtedly told a falsehood. Nevertheless, he was so scared that
he signed anew the treaty of 1786, deprived the governor of his
commission and confiscated his estates.</p>

<p>Captain William Bainbridge was in command of the <em>Philadelphia</em>,
and was detailed to help in blockading Tripoli. His companion
vessel was sent in pursuit of a corsair, so that the <em>Philadelphia</em>
was left alone to perform blockade duty. On the last day of October,
1803, Captain Bainbridge observed a Tripolitan vessel trying to
make port. He gave chase, but the coast was dangerous, abounding
with shoals and reefs, with which the fugitive vessel was familiar,
while Captain Bainbridge had to keep sounding and regulating his
speed in accordance with the degree of danger.</p>

<p>In the midst of the pursuit, and while every precaution was taken,
the crew, to their dismay, heard a dull, grating sound, whose
meaning they well knew; the bow of the frigate rose six feet out
of the water, and the stoppage was so sudden that nearly every
one was thrown off his feet.</p>

<p>A hurried examination showed that the <em>Philadelphia</em> was
inextricably fast, and could not be freed until the tide rose.
Meanwhile the corsairs would issue from the harbor near at hand,
and, choosing their own position, batter the frigate to pieces
and kill or make prisoners of the crew.</p>

<p>Every possible effort was made to release the ship, but she was
too firmly spiked on the jagged reef to be budged, and the dreaded
peril speedily appeared. The Tripolitans soon discovered the plight
of the American, and nine gunboats hurried out from the harbor.
Fire was opened on both sides, but neither was effective, the
position of the frigate preventing an effective aim. The sea drove
her higher upon the rocks, and she careened so much that all the
guns became useless. The Tripolitans, seeing her helplessness,
now came closer and increased their fire.</p>

<p>There was no help for Captain Bainbridge. Unable to deliver an
effective shot, the enemy could kill every one of his men. He
therefore flooded his magazine, blocked the pumps, bored holes
through the bottom of the ship in order to sink her if his enemies
succeeded in releasing her, and then struck his flag. Distrustful
at first, though they ceased firing, the Tripolitans finally came
aboard, plundered the officers and men of their personal property,
and then took them&mdash;three hundred and fifteen in all&mdash;to the city,
where they were lodged in prison.</p>

<p>Some days later a powerful northerly wind partly lifted the <em>Philadelphia</em>
off the rocks, and by united efforts her captors succeeded in
getting her into deep water. The holes in the bottom were plugged,
and the guns and anchors that had been thrown overboard in the
shallow water were easily recovered and replaced on the ship.
Thus the Bashaw secured a most valuable prize.</p>

<p>The disaster gave a serious aspect to the war, for it not only
added material strength to the enemy, but increased their courage
and insured a more determined resistance on their part. While
the loss was a severe one to the American navy, it was not difficult
to replace it.</p>

<p>One day a letter reached Commodore Preble. Apparently it was
nothing but a blank sheet of paper, but knowing that lemon juice
had been employed for ink, the Commodore held it before a flame
and brought out the following, in the handwriting of Bainbridge:</p>

<p>"Charter a small merchant schooner, fill her with men and have
her commanded by fearless and determined officers. Let the vessel
enter the harbor at night with her men secreted below deck; steer
her directly on board the frigate, and then let the men and officers
board, sword in hand, and there is no doubt of their success.
It will be necessary to take several good rowboats in order to
facilitate the retreat after the enterprise has been accomplished.
The frigate in her present condition is a powerful auxiliary battery
for the defence of the harbor. Though it will be impossible to
remove her from her anchorage and thus restore this beautiful
vessel to our navy, yet, as she may and no doubt will be repaired,
an important end will be gained by her destruction."</p>

<p>Captain Bainbridge had sent several similar letters to Preble,
his good friend, the Swedish consul, being the man who secured
their delivery. The plan suggested by Bainbridge was a good one,
for, since it was impossible to add the <em>Philadelphia</em>
to our navy, the next best thing was to prevent her remaining
with that of Tripoli. It may as well be stated here that the court
martial which investigated the particulars of the loss of the
<em>Philadelphia</em> acquitted Captain Bainbridge of all blame
and declared that he had done everything possible under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the American squadron succeeded about this time
in capturing a Tripolitan gunboat, which would serve admirably
to disguise the purpose of the Americans. Preble then told Lieutenant
Decatur of the suggestion made by Bainbridge. No sooner was the
young lieutenant acquainted with the plan than he volunteered
to lead in the perilous enterprise. Nothing could have suited
the daring fellow better.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Charles Stewart, who arrived a short time before in
the <em>Siren</em>, not knowing of the scheme that had been formed,
proposed with the <em>Siren's</em> men to cut out the <em>Philadelphia</em>.
Preble informed him the honor had been given to Decatur. Stewart
was disappointed, but expressed his honest pleasure that the management
of the affair was entrusted to such worthy hands.</p>

<p>"He is the best man that could have been selected," he said heartily,
"and there isn't a shadow of doubt that he will succeed."</p>

<p>Every one in the fleet was eager to volunteer, but Decatur selected
sixty-two men, to which were added six officers from the <em>Enterprise</em>
and six from the <em>Constitution</em>, with a native pilot. Knowing
the daring nature of Decatur, he was given strict orders not to
attempt to cut out the <em>Philadelphia</em>, but to destroy her.</p>

<p>Late in the day, February 9, 1804, the ketch left Syracuse for
Tripoli, accompanied by the <em>Siren</em>, Lieutenant Stewart,
to cover the retreat. The weather became so bad that the attempt
had to be postponed, since the ketch was sure to be dashed to
pieces on the rocks. The impatient crew was compelled to withdraw
and wait for a week before the weather moderated. On the 15th,
everything being favorable, the crew of the ketch bade good-by
to their friends and set out on their perilous mission.</p>

<p>The night was clear and starlit, and at nine o'clock the ketch
was in full view of the city and its twinkling lights, with the
dark shores crowded with batteries, while far ahead, under the
guns of the Bashaw's castle, lay the <em>Philadelphia</em>. The
wind fell and the little craft crept slowly through the water,
seemingly into the very jaws of death, until the outlines of the
silent frigate loomed to sight through the gloom. Following Decatur's
guarded orders, the men lay flat on the deck, all concealing themselves
as best they could, while five or six, dressed as Maltese sailors,
lounged about in plain sight.</p>

<p>The quartermaster at the wheel, obeying the directions of Decatur,
steered so as to foul the <em>Philadelphia</em>, from which there
suddenly came a hail. Lieutenant Decatur whispered to the pilot
to say they had just arrived from Malta, and, having lost their
anchor, wished to make fast to the <em>Philadelphia's</em> cables
until another could be got from shore. A brief conversation followed,
during which the ketch edged closer, but the Tripolitans soon
discovered the men in the stargleam, and the alarm was sounded;
but with great coolness and haste the ketch was worked into position
and Decatur gave the order to board.</p>

<p>The eager Americans, with cutlass and boarding pike in hand,
dashed through the gun ports and over the bulwarks. In a twinkling
the quarter deck was cleared and all the Tripolitans on the forecastle
were rushed overboard. The noise brought up a number of Turks
from below, but the moment they saw what was going on they either
leaped into the sea or hid themselves in the hold. They were pursued,
and within ten minutes the frigate was captured, without a shot
having been fired or an outcry made.</p>

<p>An abundance of combustibles had been brought, and they were
now distributed and fired so effectively that nothing could save
the fine vessel. Then the Americans scrambled back to the ketch,
Lieutenant Decatur being the last to leave the doomed frigate,
from which the dazzling glare lit up the harbor and revealed the
smaller boat straining to get away. The batteries on shore opened
fire, but, in their excitement, they aimed wildly, and no harm
was done. Every American safely reached the <em>Siren</em>, waiting
anxiously outside. The two made sail for Syracuse, where Captain
Preble was vastly relieved to hear the news. The ketch was renamed
the <em>Intrepid</em>, and Decatur, for his daring exploit, was
promoted to the rank of captain and presented with a sword by
Congress.</p>

<p>The <em>Philadelphia</em> was totally destroyed, and its remains
still lie at the bottom of the harbor of Tripoli. In referring
to this exploit, the great English naval commander, Lord Nelson,
said it was "the most bold and daring act of the age."</p>
