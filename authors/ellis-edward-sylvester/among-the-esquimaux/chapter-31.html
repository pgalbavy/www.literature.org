<p>The little party were overwhelmed with dismay. The very man on
whom they had relied from the beginning, the one who had conducted
them thus far, and the one who, under heaven, could alone guide
them to safety, had thrown up his hands and yielded the struggle.
He lay on the snow limp, helpless, and despairing.</p>

<p>The new fall of snow had almost obliterated their trail, but
enough remained to identify it beyond mistake. The cavity which
Docak had scooped out, and in which they slept, was recognized
on the first glance. The whole day, from the moment of starting,
had been wasted, in laboring to their utmost strength, in getting
back to the very point from which they set out, and which itself
was twenty miles from the sea-coast.</p>

<p>The tendency that every one shows to travel in a circle, when
lost, has been explained in various ways. It is probably due to
the fact that one side of every person is more developed than
the other. A right-handed individual gradually veers to the left,
a left-handed one to the right, while a really ambidextrous one
ought to keep straight ahead.</p>

<p>Jack and the boys remained silent for a moment. They looked down
on the prostrate figure, and finally Fred asked:</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Docak?"</p>

<p>"Gib up&mdash;no use&mdash;we die&mdash;neber see home 'gin."</p>

<p>The words were uttered with all the dejection that it is possible
to conceive, and the native did not move. He acted as if the power
to do so had gone from him.</p>

<p>Suddenly, to the astonishment of the others, Jack Cosgrove gave
him a thumping kick.</p>

<p>"Get up!" he commanded; "if you're such a lubber as all this,
I'll take you by the neck and boot you all the way across Greenland."</p>

<p>And as a guarantee of his good faith he yanked Docak to his feet,
and made ready for a still harder kick, when the fellow moved
nimbly out of the way.</p>

<p>"If you are too big a calf to go on, I'll take the lead, and
when I flop it'll be after all the rest of you've gone down."</p>

<p>The breezy style in which the sailor took hold of matters produced
an inspiriting effect on the others. Despite the grim solemnity
of the moments, both Rob and Fred laughed, as much at the quickness
with which Docak responded as anything else.</p>

<p>"Since we are here at the same old spot," said Rob, "and it is
growing dark, we might as well go into camp."</p>

<p>"That's the fact, as we won't have to scoop out a new place to
sleep in. I suppose, Docak, you're able to sleep, aint you?"</p>

<p>The native made no answer, and the party silently placed themselves
in position for another night's rest, Docak not refusing to huddle
in among them. But there was little talking done. No one could
say anything to comfort the others, and each was busy with his
own thoughts.</p>

<p>It need not be said that, despite the fearful gloom and these
forebodings, they were ravenously hungry. Their bodies were in
need of sustenance, and the probability that they could not get
it for an indefinite time to come was enough to deepen the despair
that was stealing into every heart.</p>

<p>It was unto Fred Warburton that something in the nature of a
revelation came in the darkness of that awful night. His senses
remained with him for some time after the others were asleep,
as he knew from their deep, regular breathing.</p>

<p>The snowfall had almost ceased, and he sat wondering whether,
after all, the end was at hand, and he was asking himself whether,
such seeming of a surety to be the fact, it was worth while to
rise from their present position and try to press on further.
If die they must, why not stay where they were and perish together?</p>

<p>These thoughts were stirring his mind, with many other solemn
meditations, which crowd upon every person who, in his right senses,
sees himself approaching the Dark River, when it seemed to him
that there was sounding, at intervals, an almost inaudible roar,
so faint and dull that for awhile he paid no heed to it, deeming
it some insignificant aural disturbance, such as causes a buzzing
or ringing at times in the head.</p>

<p>But it obtruded so continually that he began to suspect it was
a reality and from some point outside of himself.</p>

<p>It was a low, almost inaudible murmur, sometimes so faint that
he could not hear it, and again swelling out just enough to make
it certain it had an actuality.</p>

<p>Suddenly the heart of the lad almost stood still.</p>

<p>"It's the ocean!" he whispered; "the air has become so still
that I can hear it. The plain is open, there has been a big storm,
and the distance is not too great for it to reach us. But, no,
it is from the wrong direction; it can't be the sea."</p>

<p>The next moment he laughed at himself. Having fixed in his mind
the course to the home of Docak, and, hearing the roar from another
point of the compass, it did not at once occur to him that he
himself might be mistaken.</p>

<p>"If Docak, with all his experience could not keep himself from
going astray, what wonder that I should drift from my moorings?
Yes, that is the sound of the distant ocean or that part known
as Davis' Strait and Baffin's Bay. We can now tell which course
to take to get out of this accursed country."</p>

<p>He wished to awake his friends, and in view of their hungry condition,
urge that they should set out at once; but they were so wearied
that the rest would be grateful, and it was needed. And so, while
not exactly clear as to what should be done, he fell asleep and
did not open his eyes until morning.</p>

<p>Docak was the first to rouse himself. He found that the snow
was falling again, with the prospect worse than ever.</p>

<p>Fred sprang to his feet and quickly told what he had discovered
the evening before.</p>

<p>"It was the ocean," he added, with a shake of his head: "I have
heard it too often to make a mistake&mdash;listen!"</p>

<p>All were silent, but the strained ear could catch no sound like
the hollow roar which reached the youth a few hours before.</p>

<p>"I don't care; I was not mistaken," he insisted.</p>

<p>"Why don't we hear it now?" asked Rob, anxious to believe what
he said, but unable fully to do so.</p>

<p>"There was no snow falling at the time; the air was clearer then,
and what little wind there was must have been in the right direction."</p>

<p>"Where did sound come from?" asked the Esquimau, looking earnestly
at Fred and showing deep interest in his words.</p>

<p>"From off yonder," replied the lad, pointing in the proper direction.</p>

<p>"He right&mdash;dat so&mdash;he hear sea," said Docak, who, to prove the
truth of his words, pointed down at the dimly marked trail. It
led in the precise course indicated by Fred. In other words, when
the Esquimau resumed the journey on the preceding morning, at
which time his bearings were correct, he went of a verity directly
toward his own home, which was the route now pointed by Fred Warburton.</p>

<p>The others saw the point, and admitted that the declaration of
the lad had been proven to be correct beyond question.</p>

<p>And yet, while all this was interesting in its way, and for the
time encouraged the others, of what possible import was it? The
conditions were precisely the same as twenty-four hours before,
except they were less favorable, for the comrades in distress
were hungrier and weaker.</p>

<p>But they could not hear the ocean, the snow was falling, and
there was no way of guiding themselves.</p>

<p>They could only struggle on as before, hoping that possibly before
wandering too far astray they might be able to catch the roar
that would be an infallible guide to them in their despairing
groping for home.</p>

<p>The three looked at Docak, expecting him to take the lead, as
he had done from the start. It may be said that Jack Cosgrove
had kicked the Esquimau into his proper place and he was prepared
to stay there as long as he could.</p>

<p>But the native, instead of moving off, stood with his head bent
and his ears bared in the attitude of intense attention.</p>

<p>They judged that he was striving to catch a sound of the ocean.
But he was not.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, Docak had detected another sound of a totally
different character, but far more important than the hollow roar
of the far-away Arctic Sea.</p>
