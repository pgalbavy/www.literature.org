<p>"A fight! A fight! Form a ring!" A dozen or more excited boys
shouted these words, and, rushing forward, hastily formed a ring
around two playmates who stood in the middle of the road, their
hats off, eyes glaring, fists clenched, while they panted with
anger, and were on the point of flying at one another with the
fury of young wildcats.</p>

<p>They had been striking, kicking and biting a minute before over
some trifling dispute, and they had now stopped to take breath
and gather strength before attacking each other again with a fierceness
which had become all the greater from the brief rest.</p>

<p>"Give it to him, Sam! Black his eyes for him! Hit him under the
ear! Bloody his nose!"</p>

<p>Thus shouted the partisans of Sammy McClay, who had thrown down
his school books, and pitched into his opponent, as though he
meant to leave nothing of him.</p>

<p>The friends of Joe Hunt were just as loud and urgent.</p>

<p>"Sail in, Joe! You can whip him before he knows it! Kick him!
Don't be a coward! You've got him!"</p>

<p>A party of boys and girls were on their way home from the Tottenville
public school, laughing, romping and frolicking with each other,
when, all at once, like a couple of bantam chickens, these two
youngsters began fighting.</p>

<p>The girls looked on in a horrified way, whispering to each other,
and declaring that they meant to tell Mr. McCurtis, the teacher,
including also the respective mothers of the young pugilists.</p>

<p>The other boys, as is nearly always the case, did their utmost
to urge on the fight, and, closing about Sam and Joe, taunted
them in loud voices, and appealed to them to resume hostilities
at once.</p>

<p>The fighters seemed to be equally matched, and, as they panted
and glared, each waited for the other to renew the struggle by
striking the first blow.</p>

<p>"You just hit me if you dare! that's all I want!" exclaimed Sammy
McClay, shaking his head so vigorously that he almost bumped his
nose against that of Joe Hunt, who was just as ferocious, as he
called back:</p>

<p>"You touch me, Sam McClay, just touch me! I dare you! double,
double dare you."</p>

<p>Matters were fast coming to the exploding point, but not fast
enough to suit the audience. Jimmy Emery picked up a chip, and
running forward, balanced it in a delicate position on the shoulder
of Sam McClay, and, addressing his opponent said: "Knock that
off, Joe!"</p>

<p>"Yes, knock it off!" shouted Sam, "I dare you to knock it off!"</p>

<p>"Who's afraid?" demanded Joe, looking at the chip, with an expression
which showed he meant to flip it to the ground.</p>

<p>"Well, you just try it&mdash;that's all!"</p>

<p>Joe was in the very act of upsetting the bit of wood, when a
boy about their own age, with a flapping straw hat, and with his
trousers rolled far above his knees, ran in between the two, and
used his arms with so much vigor that the contestants were thrown
quite a distance apart.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you fellows?" demanded this boy, glancing
from one to the other. "What do you want to make fools of yourselves
for?"</p>

<p>"He run against me," said Sammy McClay, "and knocked me over
Jim Emery."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" asked the peacemaker. "Will it make you feel
any better to get your head cracked? What's the matter of <em>you</em>,
Joe Hunt?" he added, turning his glance without changing his position,
toward the other pugilist.</p>

<p>"What did he punch me for, when I stubbed my toe and run agin
him?" and Joe showed a disposition just then to move around his
questioner, so as to get at the offender.</p>

<p>The other boys did not like this interference with their enjoyment,
and called on the peacemaker to let them have it out; but he stood
his ground, and shaking his right fist at Sammy McClay, and his
left at Joe Hunt, he told them they must let each other alone,
or he would whip them both.</p>

<p>This created some laughter, for the lad was no older than they,
and hardly as tall as either; but there is a great deal in the
manner of a man or boy. If his flashing eye, his stern voice,
and look of determination show that he means what he says, or
is in dead earnest, his opponent generally yields.</p>

<p>At the critical juncture, the girls added their voices in favor
of peace, and their champion, stooping down, picked up the hats
from the ground, and jammed them upon their owners' heads with
a force that nearly threw them off their feet.</p>

<p>"That's enough! now come on!"</p>

<p>Sam and Joe walked along, rather sullenly at first. They glowered
on each other, shook their heads, muttered and seemed on the point
of renewing the contest more than once; but the passions of childhood
are brief, and the storm soon blew over. Before the boys and girls
had reached the cross-roads, Sam McClay and Joe Hunt were playing
with each other like the best of friends, as indeed they were.</p>

<p>The name of the lad who had stopped the fight was Fred Sheldon,
and he is the hero of this story.</p>
