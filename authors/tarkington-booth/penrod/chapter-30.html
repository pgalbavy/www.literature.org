<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>A dancing floor had been laid upon a platform in the yard, when
Mrs. Schofield and her son arrived at their own abode; and a white
and scarlet striped canopy was in process of erection overhead,
to shelter the dancers from the sun. Workmen were busy everywhere
under the direction of Margaret, and the smitten heart of Penrod
began to beat rapidly. All this was for him; he was Twelve!</p>

<p>After lunch, he underwent an elaborate toilette and murmured
not. For the first time in his life he knew the wish to be sand-papered,
waxed, and polished to the highest possible degree. And when the
operation was over, he stood before the mirror in new bloom, feeling
encouraged to hope that his resemblance to his father was not
so strong as Aunt Sarah seemed to think.</p>

<p>The white gloves upon his hands had a pleasant smell, he found;
and, as he came down the stairs, he had great content in the twinkling
of his new dancing slippers. He stepped twice on each step, the
better to enjoy their effect and at the same time he deeply inhaled
the odour of the gloves. In spite of everything, Penrod had his
social capacities. Already it is to be perceived that there were
in him the makings of a cotillon leader.</p>

<p>Then came from the yard a sound of tuning instruments, squeak
of fiddle, croon of 'cello, a falling triangle ringing and tinkling
to the floor; and he turned pale.</p>

<p>Chosen guests began to arrive, while Penrod, suffering from stage-fright
and perspiration, stood beside his mother, in the "drawing-room," 
to receive them. He greeted unfamiliar acquaintances and intimate
fellow-criminals with the same frigidity, murmuring: "'M glad
to see y'," to all alike, largely increasing the embarrassment
which always prevails at the beginning of children's festivities.
His unnatural pomp and circumstance had so thoroughly upset him,
in truth, that Marjorie Jones received a distinct shock, now to
be related. Doctor Thrope, the kind old clergyman who had baptized
Penrod, came in for a moment to congratulate the boy, and had
just moved away when it was Marjorie's turn, in the line of children,
to speak to Penrod. She gave him what she considered a forgiving
look, and, because of the occasion, addressed him in a perfectly
courteous manner.</p>

<p>"I wish you many happy returns of the day, Penrod."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir!" he returned, following Dr. Thrope with a glassy
stare in which there was absolutely no recognition of Marjorie.
Then he greeted Maurice Levy, who was next to Marjorie: "'M glad
to see y'!"</p>

<p>Dumfounded, Marjorie turned aside, and stood near, observing
Penrod with gravity. It was the first great surprise of her life.
Customarily, she had seemed to place his character somewhere between
that of the professional rioter and that of the orang-outang;
nevertheless, her manner at times just hinted a consciousness
that this Caliban was her property. Wherefore, she stared at him
incredulously as his head bobbed up and down, in the dancing-school
bow, greeting his guests. Then she heard an adult voice, near
her, exclaim:</p>

<p>"What an exquisite child!"</p>

<p>Mariorie galanced up&mdash;a little consciously, though she was used
to it&mdash;naturally curious to ascertain who was speaking of her.
It was Sam Williams' mother addressing Mrs. Bassett, both being
present to help Mrs. Schofield make the festivities festive.</p>

<p>"Exquisite!"</p>

<p>Here was a second heavy surprise for Marjorie: they were not
looking at her. They were looking with beaming approval at a girl
she had never seen; a dark and modish stranger of singularly composed
and yet modest aspect. Her downcast eyes, becoming in one thus
entering a crowded room, were all that produced the effect of
modesty, counteracting something about her which might have seemed
too assured. She was very slender, very dainty, and her apparel
was disheartening to the other girls; it was of a knowing picturesqueness
wholly unfamiliar to them. There was a delicate trace of powder
upon the lobe of Fanchon's left ear, and the outlines of her eyelids,
if very closely scrutinized, would have revealed successful experimentation
with a burnt match.</p>

<p>Marjorie's lovely eyes dilated: she learned the meaning of hatred
at first sight. Observing the stranger with instinctive suspicion,
all at once she seemed, to herself, awkward. Poor Marjorie underwent
that experience which hearty, healthy, little girls and big girls
undergo at one time or another&mdash;from heels to head she felt herself,
somehow, too <em>THICK</em>.</p>

<p>Fanchon leaned close to Penrod and whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>"Don't you forget!"</p>

<p>Penrod blushed.</p>

<p>Marjorie saw the blush. Her lovely eyes opened even wider, and
in them there began to grow a light. It was the light of indignation;&mdash;at
least, people whose eyes glow with that light always call it indignation.</p>

<p>Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, approached Fanchon, when she
had made her courtesy to Mrs. Schofield. Fanchon whispered in
Roderick's ear also.</p>

<p>"Your hair is pretty, Roddy! Don't forget what you said yesterday!"</p>

<p>Roderick likewise blushed.</p>

<p>Maurice Levy, captivated by the newcomer's appearance, pressed
close to Roderick.</p>

<p>"Give us an intaduction, Roddy?"</p>

<p>Roddy being either reluctant or unable to perform the rite, Fanchon
took matters into her own hands, and was presently favourably
impressed with Maurice, receiving the information that his tie
had been brought to him by his papa from Skoone's, whereupon she
privately informed him that she liked wavy hair, and arranged
to dance with him. Fanchon also thought sandy hair attractive,
Sam Williams discovered, a few minutes later, and so catholic
was her taste that a ring of boys quite encircled her before the
musicians in the yard struck up their thrilling march, and Mrs.
Schofield brought Penrod to escort the lady from out-of-town to
the dancing pavilion.</p>

<p>Headed by this pair, the children sought partners and paraded
solemnly out of the front door and round a corner of the house.
There they found the gay marquee; the small orchestra seated on
the lawn at one side of it, and a punch bowl of lemonade inviting
attention, under a tree. Decorously the small couples stepped
upon the platform, one after another, and began to dance.</p>

<p>"It's not much like a children's party in our day," Mrs. Williams
said to Penrod's mother. "We'd have been playing 'Quaker-meeting,'
'Clap-in, Clap-out,' or 'Going to Jerusalem,' I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, or 'Post-office' and 'Drop-the-handkerchief,'" said Mrs.
Schofield. "Things change so quickly. Imagine asking little Fanchon
Gelbraith to play 'London Bridge'! Penrod seems to be having a
difficult time with her, poor boy; he wasn't a shining light in
the dancing class."</p>

<p>However, Penrod's difficulty was not precisely of the kind his
mother supposed. Fanchon was showing him a new step, which she
taught her next partner in turn, continuing instructions during
the dancing. The children crowded the floor, and in the kaleidoscopic
jumble of bobbing heads and intermingling figures her extremely
different style of motion was unobserved by the older people,
who looked on, nodding time benevolently.</p>

<p>Fanchon fascinated girls as well as boys. Many of the former
eagerly sought her acquaintance and thronged about her between
the dances, when, accepting the deference due a cosmopolitan and
an oracle of the mode, she gave demonstrations of the new step
to succeeding groups, professing astonishment to find it unknown:
it had been "all the go," she explained, at the Long Shore Casino
for fully two seasons. She pronounced "slow" a "Fancy Dance" executed
during an intermission by Baby Rennsdale and Georgie Bassett,
giving it as her opinion that Miss Rennsdale and Mr. Bassett were
"dead ones"; and she expressed surprise that the punch bowl contained
lemonade and not champagne.</p>

<p>The dancing continued, the new step gaining instantly in popularity,
fresh couples adventuring with every number. The word "step" is
somewhat misleading, nothing done with the feet being vital to
the evolutions introduced by Fanchon. Fanchon's dance came from
the Orient by a roundabout way; pausing in Spain, taking on a
Gallic frankness in gallantry at the Bal Bullier in Paris, combining
with a relative from the South Seas encountered in San Francisco,
flavouring itself with a carefree negroid abandon in New Orleans,
and, accumulating, too, something inexpressible from Mexico and
South America, it kept, throughout its travels, to the underworld,
or to circles where nature is extremely frank and rank, until
at last it reached the dives of New York, when it immediately
broke out in what is called civilized society. Thereafter it spread,
in variously modified forms&mdash;some of them disinfected&mdash;to watering-places,
and thence, carried by hundreds of older male and female Fanchons,
over the country, being eagerly adopted everywhere and made wholly
pure and respectable by the supreme moral axiom that anything
is all right if enough people do it. Everybody was doing it.</p>

<p>Not quite everybody. It was perhaps some test of this dance that
earth could furnish no more grotesque sight than that of children
doing it.</p>

<p>Earth, assisted by Fanchon, was furnishing this sight at Penrod's
party. By the time ice-cream and cake arrived, about half the
guests had either been initiated into the mysteries by Fanchon
or were learning by imitation, and the education of the other
half was resumed with the dancing, when the attendant ladies,
unconscious of what was happening, withdrew into the house for
tea.</p>

<p>"That orchestra's a dead one," Fanchon remarked to Penrod. "We
ought to liven them up a little!"</p>

<p>She approached the musicians.</p>

<p>"Don't you know," she asked the leader, "the Slingo Sligo Slide?"</p>

<p>The leader giggled, nodded, rapped with his bow upon his violin;
and Penrod, following Fanchon back upon the dancing floor, blindly
brushed with his elbow a solitary little figure standing aloof
on the lawn at the edge of the platform.</p>

<p>It was Marjorie.</p>

<p>In no mood to approve of anything introduced by Fanchon, she
had scornfully refused, from the first, to dance the new "step,"
and, because of its bonfire popularity, found herself neglected
in a society where she had reigned as beauty and belle. Faithless
Penrod, dazed by the sweeping Fanchon, had utterly forgotten the
amber curls; he had not once asked Marjorie to dance. All afternoon
the light of indignation had been growing brighter in her eyes,
though Maurice Levy's defection to the lady from New York had
not fanned this flame. From the moment Fanchon had whispered familiarly
in Penrod's ear, and Penrod had blushed, Marjorie had been occupied
exclusively with resentment against that guilty pair. It seemed
to her that Penrod had no right to allow a strange girl to whisper
in his ear; that his blushing, when the strange girl did it, was
atrocious; and that the strange girl, herself, ought to be arrested.</p>

<p>Forgotten by the merrymakers, Marjorie stood alone upon the lawn,
clenching her small fists, watching the new dance at its high
tide, and hating it with a hatred that made every inch of her
tremble. And, perhaps because jealousy is a great awakener of
the virtues, she had a perception of something in it worse than
lack of dignity&mdash;something vaguely but outrageously reprehensible.
Finally, when Penrod brushed by her, touched her with his elbow,
and, did not even see her, Marjorie's state of mind (not unmingled
with emotion!) became dangerous. In fact, a trained nurse, chancing
to observe her at this juncture, would probably have advised that
she be taken home and put to bed. Marjorie was on the verge of
hysterics.</p>

<p>She saw Fanchon and Penrod assume the double embrace required
by the dance; the "Slingo Sligo Slide" burst from the orchestra
like the lunatic shriek of a gin-maddened nigger; and all the
little couples began to bob and dip and sway.</p>

<p>Marjorie made a scene. She sprang upon the platform and stamped
her foot.</p>

<p>"Penrod Schofield!" she shouted. "You <em>BEHAVE </em>yourself!"</p>

<p>The remarkable girl took Penrod by the ear. By his ear she swung
him away from Fanchon and faced him toward the lawn.</p>

<p>"You march straight out of here!" she commanded.</p>

<p>Penrod marched.</p>

<p>He was stunned; obeyed automatically, without question, and had
very little realization of what was happening to him. Altogether,
and without reason, he was in precisely the condition of an elderly
spouse detected in flagrant misbehaviour. Marjorie, similarly,
was in precisely the condition of the party who detects such misbehaviour.
It may be added that she had acted with a promptness, a decision
and a disregard of social consequences all to be commended to
the attention of ladies in like predicament.</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself!" she raged, when they reached
the lawn. "Aren't you ashamed of yourself?"</p>

<p>"What for?" he inquired, helplessly.</p>

<p>"You be quiet!"</p>

<p>"But what'd <em>I</em> do, Marjorie? <em>I</em> haven't done
anything to you," he pleaded. "I haven't even seen you, all aftern&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You be quiet!" she cried, tears filling her eyes. "Keep still!
You ugly boy! Shut up!"</p>

<p>She slapped him.</p>

<p>He should have understood from this how much she cared for him.
But he rubbed his cheek and declared ruefully:</p>

<p>"I'll never speak to you again!"</p>

<p>"You will, too!" she sobbed, passionately.</p>

<p>"I will not!"</p>

<p>He turned to leave her, but paused.</p>

<p>His mother, his sister Margaret, and their grownup friends had
finished their tea and were approaching from the house. Other
parents and guardians were with them, coming for their children;
and there were carriages and automobiles waiting in the street.
But the "Slingo Slide"  went on, regardless.</p>

<p>The group of grown-up people hesitated and came to a halt, gazing
at the pavilion.</p>

<p>"What are they doing?" gasped Mrs. Williams, blushing deeply.
"What is it? What IS it?"</p>

<p>"<em>WHAT IS IT?" </em>Mrs. Gelbraith echoed in a frightened
whisper. "<em>WHAT</em>&#11834;"</p>

<p>"They're Tangoing!" cried Margaret Schofield. "Or Bunny Hugging
or Grizzly Bearing, or&#11834;"</p>

<p>"They're only Turkey Trotting," said Robert Williams.</p>

<p>With fearful outcries the mothers, aunts, and sisters rushed
upon the pavilion.</p>

<p>"Of course it was dreadful," said Mrs. Schofield, an hour later,
rendering her lord an account of the day, "but it was every bit
the fault of that one extraordinary child. And of all the quiet,
demur little things&mdash;that is, I mean, when she first came. We
all spoke of how exquisite she seemed&mdash;so well trained, so finished!
Eleven years old! I never saw anything like her in my life!"</p>

<p>"I suppose it's the New Child," her husband grunted.</p>

<p>"And to think of her saying there ought to have been champagne
in the lemonade!"</p>

<p>"Probably she'd forgotten to bring her pocket flask," he suggested
musingly.</p>

<p>"But aren't you proud of Penrod?" cried Penrod's mother. "It
was just as I told you: he was standing clear outside the pavilion&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I never thought to see the day! And Penrod was the only boy
not doing it, the only one to refuse? <em>ALL </em>the others
were&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Every one!" she returned triumphantly. "Even Georgie Bassett!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Schofield, patting her on the shoulder. "I guess
we can hold up our heads at last."</p>
