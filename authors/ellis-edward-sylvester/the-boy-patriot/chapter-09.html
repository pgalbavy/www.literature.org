<p>Hal was still in the deep sleep into which he had fallen, when
the bolts of their place of confinement were withdrawn. Blair's
clear bright eyes looked full in the face of the English commander,
who now stood before him.</p>

<p>"Give me your hand, my boy," said the captain. "I can respect
bravery wherever I find it. I honor you for your determined courage.
Tell me, who taught you so to love your country?"</p>

<p>Blair's hand still hung at his side as he answered, "My mother,
sir; the best of mothers. She would rather have me die in the
right cause, than live a traitor."</p>

<p>"You will not give me your hand? Perhaps I do not deserve it;
but it was not cruelty which prompted me to act as I did last
evening. I felt our danger, and scrupled not to use any means
which should bring you to terms. Your constancy triumphed. I knew
that no threats could force such a spirit. You shall not lose
your reward, in the knowledge of the service you have done your
home and your kindred. My orders were to get into the harbor of
Fairport, to take possession of the naval stores there belonging
to privateersmen, and then to reduce the town to ashes."</p>

<p>For the first time Blair's eyes filled with tears, and his chest
swelled with strong emotion as he exclaimed, "Thank God, I have
been able to be useful to my country and my home. This will fill
my mother's heart with joy. To her I owe all in me that is worthy
of praise."</p>

<p>"I believe I can trust you, my lad," said the captain. "I would
not willingly have my name go out as one who would maim and torture
a brave lad. My desperation is my excuse for my expedient of last
evening. I want you to promise to keep that scene a secret. You
may perchance some day have your own sins to cover. I have been
reckoned brave and honorable, and I would not have my fair name
tarnished. Will you promise?"</p>

<p>"I forgive you from my heart. I promise," said Blair, frankly
extending his hand.</p>

<p>"Such a mother as yours can be trusted," said the English commander,
warmly grasping the offered hand. "She must know how her son did
her honor in his hour of danger. Tell her the story, but let her
keep it to herself. The true patriot, my boy, is willing to suffer
for his country, though he win no glory from his sufferings. Are
you equal to such a sacrifice?"</p>

<p>"I own I should like to be known as one who had done something
for his native land," said Blair; "but it will do me good, and
make me the purer patriot, I trust, to have only my mother's praise,
if we ever meet again."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> shall be released at the earliest opportunity;
but this your companion must stay with us. I wish he was of the
stuff that you are. We would make a British tar of him, who would
do us honor. His tongue tells the story of his birth, even if
we could doubt the witness of his Saxon eyes and hair."</p>

<p>"He chose to be an American. He worked his way to a home with
us, and to us he ought to belong," said Blair boldly.</p>

<p>"He is English, unnaturalized of course, as he is under age.
He belongs to us by all law. I wish he were a better prey," said
the captain.</p>

<p>"You do Hal Hutchings injustice. A truer heart never throbbed.
Timid as he is, he ventured with me in the boat because he would
not see me go alone. Let him once love his duty as he loves me,
and there will be no post of danger from which he will shrink."</p>

<p>Blair's eyes flashed and his cheek glowed as he spoke.</p>

<p>"He shall be kindly cared for. We will make the best of what
is in him. You are both free to go your way on board the ship.
There is no chance of escape where we now are. You will see how
our good vessel has suffered by the storm. Yet she weathered it
bravely. You shall have food here presently, and then you are
at large, prisoners on parole."</p>

<p>With these words the captain took his leave.</p>

<p>Blair's first impulse, when left alone, was to throw himself
on his knees beside his sleeping companion. From the depths of
his heart he thanked God for enabling him to be firm to his duty;
and earnestly he prayed that he might be made humble in the midst
of the honor which had been allowed him. For his dear mother too
rose a fervent prayer that she might be kept in the hollow of
her Maker's hand during the absence of her son, whom she had striven
to train as a Christian patriot, whose watchwords are ever, "God
and my native land."</p>
