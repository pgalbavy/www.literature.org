<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Gerald Buxton was boiling over with indignation when he parted
company with Mike Murphy and realized how he had been tricked.
He had allowed the real burglar to get away while he held up his
innocent pursuer.</p>

<p>"All I ask is one sight of that villain!" he muttered, striking
into a lope which carried him rapidly over the ground. Since the
fugitive had disappeared several minutes before and there was
no telling what course he had taken, it would seem there was not
one chance in a hundred of Buxton ever seeing him again.</p>

<p>But, although the citizen had been cleverly hoodwinked, he used
shrewdness in wrestling with the problem. As he viewed it, the
fellow was likely to make for the stretch of woods between Beartown
and the river, that he might screen himself as quickly as possible.
He would lose no time in getting away from the village as soon
as he could. It was quite probable that he and his gang had come
up or down the river and had a launch awaiting them. To avoid
going astray, he would use the highway which joined Beartown and
the landing.</p>

<p>Mr. Buxton had to climb three fences before he reached an open
field of slight extent, beyond which lay the woods. He knew the
chances of overtaking the criminal were meagre, but with a thrill
of delight he caught sight of his man only a little way in front
and walking in the same direction with himself. He seemed to have
sprung from the ground, and it was clear that he had no thought
of further pursuit. His follower tried to get nearer to him before
he reached the woods, but the fellow heard him and glancing over
his shoulder broke into a run.</p>

<p>"Stop or I'll fire!" shouted Buxton.</p>

<p>After the young man's experience with his first pursuer and his
Springfield, he could not be blamed for refusing to heed the command.
He ran the faster and the next minute would have whisked beyond
reach, had not Buxton come to an abrupt halt, and taking a quick
aim, fired.</p>

<p>He got his man too. With a cry of pain he leaped several feet
in the air and fell. Terrified by what he had done, Buxton ran
forward, gun in hand, and called out while several paces distant:</p>

<p>"Are you hurt bad?"</p>

<p>"I'm done for," was the reply as the wounded fellow laboriously
climbed to his feet.</p>

<p>With anger turned into sympathy, the captor asked:</p>

<p>"Where did I hit you?"</p>

<p>"You shattered my right leg," was the reply, accompanied by groans
as the fellow with excruciating effort tried to support himself
on the other limb.</p>

<p>Buxton laid down his weapon and knelt to examine the wound. He
saw now that the lower part of the trousers leg was shredded by
the charge of shot and that, doubtless, the hurt was a very grievous
one.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I gave it to you so bad, but you can't deny you desarved
it. If you're able to walk back to my house, with my help, I'll
get a doctor and we'll soon&#11834;"</p>

<p>At that instant the young man sprang back a couple of paces,
and the startled Buxton looking up saw that he stood firmly on
both feet, with the shotgun pointed at him. He had snatched up
the weapon while the owner was stooping over to inspect the wound.</p>

<p>"Now it's <em>my</em> turn!" he said, with a chuckle. "It isn't
your fault that you didn't kill me, and it will be my fault if
I don't even matters up with you!"</p>

<p>Poor Buxton slowly came to the upright position, with jaws dropping
and eyes staring. He could only mumble:</p>

<p>"W-w-what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing with me; it's <em>you</em> that's in a hole."</p>

<p>Believing it was all up with him, the terrified victim stood
mute.</p>

<p>"I ought to shoot you down and I'll do so if you don't obey me."</p>

<p>"W-w-what do you want?" Buxton managed to stammer out.</p>

<p>"Dance!" was the crisp command.</p>

<p>The citizen stared, not comprehending the order.</p>

<p>"We cowboys in the West when we want a little fun make a tenderfoot
dance while we fire our revolvers at his feet. <em>BEGIN</em>!"</p>

<p>The victim lowered the point of the gun so as to point it at
the shoes of Mr. Buxton.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>can't dance; never done it in my life,"
he stuttered.</p>

<p>"Can't begin earlier. Start up!"</p>

<p>Knowing what was ordered, the victim obeyed. He leaped up and
down, shuffled his feet and made such comical antics that the
gun wabbled in the hands of the laughing master of the situation.</p>

<p>"I have one loaded barrel left and I'm aching to let you have
it! Keep it up!"</p>

<p>Now that he had started, Mr. Buxton threw more vigor into his
steps. He bounded in the air, side-stepped, kicked out his feet,
tried a number of fancy movements of which he knew nothing, and
acted like an energetic youth taking his first lessons in that
branch of the terpsichorean art called buck dancing.</p>

<p>"Turn your back toward me and dance all the way home! If you
let up for one minute or look around I'll blaze away, and you
won't get the charge in your <em>feet</em>! Remember that!"</p>

<p>Mr. Buxton reflected that having left home so jauntily with loaded
weapon over his shoulder, it would be anything but a dignified
return to dance back again without it. If he jig-stepped down
the main street some neighbor was likely to see him and make remarks.
A waltz through the gate, up the steps of the porch and into the
hall, by which time it would probably be safe for him to cease
his exhausting performance, would undoubtedly cause annoying inquiries
on the part of his wife and family.</p>

<p>But there was hope. He might gain a start that would make it
safe to resume his natural gait. He did his best. Facing the boundary
fence less than two hundred yards away he kicked up his heels,
swung his arms in unison, and steadily drew away from that fearful
form standing with gun levelled at him. He yearned to break into
a run, but dared not. He believed his tormentor was following
so as to keep him in range.</p>

<p>It was hardly to be expected that he should go over the fence
with a dance step, but he reflected that he could resume his labors
immediately he dropped to the ground on the other side and faithfully
maintain it to the next boundary. But there was risk and he was
afraid to incur it. While still shifting his feet with an energy
that caused him to breathe fast, he approached the obstruction.
Partly turning his head while toiling as hard as ever, he called:</p>

<p>"I'll have to stop a minute till I climb over, but I'll resoom
dancing as soon as I hit the ground on the other side agin. Is
that all right?"</p>

<p>There was no reply and he repeated the question in a louder voice.
Still hearing nothing, he ventured to look back. The young man
was nowhere in sight. Truth to tell, no sooner had Mr. Buxton
begun his humorous exhibition than the youth, vainly trying to
suppress his mirth, flung down the gun, turned about and entered
the wood toward which he was running when so abruptly checked
by his pursuer.</p>

<p>"Wal, I'll be hanged!" was the disgusted exclamation of the panting
Buxton. "That's the meanest trick I ever had played on me. The
scand'lous villain oughter be hung. What a sight I made! I'm mighty
glad no one seen me."</p>

<p>In his relief, he did not notice a vague form which flitted along
the edge of the wood, so close to the trees that the shadow screened
it from clear view. Had Mr. Buxton noted it he might not have
felt certain that no one witnessed his unrivalled performance.</p>

<p>He was so tired out from his tremendous efforts that he stood
awhile mopping his moist forehead with his handkerchief while
he regained his wind.</p>

<p>"It's lucky he didn't foller and make me dance all the way home.
Never could have done it. Would have dropped dead, I am that blamed
tired."</p>

<p>He leaned against the fence while recovering from his unwonted
exercise. Naturally he believed the young man who had used him
so ill had carried away his weapon beyond possibility of recovery.</p>

<p>"And I paid twenty-five dollars for it in Portland," he bitterly
mused. "It looks to me that as a hunter of post office robbers
I ain't of much account."</p>

<p>He resumed his walk homeward, going slowly, carefully climbing
the obstructions in his path and studying what explanation to
make to his friends for the loss of his valuable piece. He might
manage it with all except his wife and son. It would not do to
tell them he had dropped it somewhere along the road without noticing
the accident. A boy might lose his pocketknife (I know of a youngster
who lost a wheelbarrow and never found it again), but a double
barreled shotgun manifestly could not disappear in that fashion
so much out of the ordinary way of things.</p>

<p>"I think I'll have a look at the post office and larn what mischief
the villain done there."</p>

<p>He veered in his course and came to the back window, where a
light showed that some persons were gathered. He found mother,
daughter and the three boys, who gave him warm greeting.</p>

<p>"Was that your gun we heard a little while ago?" asked the woman.</p>

<p>"I reckon it must have been," replied Mr. Buxton, who declined
the invitation to enter and remained standing outside the window.</p>

<p>"Did you hit the burglar?" asked Alvin.</p>

<p>"Young man," said Mr. Buxton loftily, "when I fire at anything
I <em>always</em> hit it."</p>

<p>"You didn't kill him, Gerald!" exclaimed the horrified mother.</p>

<p>"No; I just winged him so he won't forget it if he lives a thousand
years; don't like to kill a scamp even if he is a burglar."</p>

<p>"Where's your gun?" continued Alvin.</p>

<p>The man glanced around as if it were hidden somewhere about his
garments.</p>

<p>"Now isn't that a fine go?" he exclaimed disgustedly. "I set
it down while I went forward to see how bad that feller was hit,
and plumb forgot."</p>

<p>"O dad, here's your gun!"</p>

<p>It was the son Jim who called this greeting as he straddled forward
with the heavy piece resting on his shoulder. All stared in amazement,
and the father in his confusion was imprudent enough to ask:</p>

<p>"Where did you get it?"</p>

<p>"I seen that feller that took it away from you and made you dance
all the way across the field. He throwed it down and went into
the woods. When I seen you hopping and dancing and kicking up
your heels I nearly died a-larfing. But I didn't forgit the gun,
and run along the edge of the woods and picked it up. Gee! it's
heavy! But, dad, I didn't know you could dance like that. Say&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You young rascal, didn't I tell you to stay home? I'll larn
you!"</p>

<p>The parent made a dive at his son, who, with the gun still over
his shoulder, scooted across the yard and over the fence, with
his irate father in fierce pursuit.</p>
