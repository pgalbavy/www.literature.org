<p>Tom's anxiety for his comrade drove all thought of sleep from
his eyes for the time; and he sat long in the hot, smoky air of
the room down-stairs, in the hope that Jim would come.</p>

<p>It seemed to the watcher that there was an unusually large number
of visitors in the house that evening. There was a great deal
of drinking and carousing going on, and many of the men gathered
there, he was sure, belonged to the lowest grades of society.</p>

<p>A half-dozen foreign nations were represented, and one had but
to listen to the talk for a short while to learn that among them
were many whom one might well fear to meet on a lonely road at
night.</p>

<p>Tom might have felt some dread but for the fact that, rather
strangely, these men showed little disposition to engage in any
brawl, and no one seemed to notice him.</p>

<p>Late in the evening a couple of policemen came in and waited
a while around the stove. They only spoke to the bartender, who
treated them with the greatest consideration; but they scrutinized
the lad with a curious look, which caused him to wonder whether
they held any suspicion of wrong-doing on his part. They said
nothing to him, however, and shortly after went out.</p>

<p>Tom's great alarm for Jim drove nearly every other thought from
his mind. Late as it was, he would have started out to search
for him, could he have formed the least idea of the course to
take; but, besides being a stranger in the city, he knew that
a single man or a hundred might spend weeks in hunting for one
in the metropolis, without the least probability of finding him.</p>

<p>It was near midnight when he concluded to make his way to the
room, hoping that Jim would show up before morning.</p>

<p>The sounds of revelry below, mingled with shouts and the stamping
of feet, together with the feverish condition of the lad, kept
him awake another hour; but at last he fell into a light, uneasy
sleep, haunted by all sorts of grotesque, awful visions.</p>

<p>Suddenly he awoke; in the dim light of his little room Tom saw
the figure of a man standing by the bed.</p>

<p>"Who are you? What do you want?" whispered the terrified lad,
struggling to rise to a sitting position.</p>

<p>"Mebbe ye doesn't know me, but I'm Patsey McConough, and it was
mesilf that saw ye shtrike out so boldly last night and save the
gal that had fallen overboard, and St. Patrick himself couldn't
have done it any better than did yersilf."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by coming into my room this way?" asked Tom,
whose fear greatly subsided under the words of the Irishman.</p>

<p>"I come up-stairs to wake ye, for I'm afeard ye are going to
have trouble onless ye look mighty sharp."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Patsey carefully closed and bolted the door behind him, and sat
down on the edge of the bed, speaking in a low, guarded voice.</p>

<p>"There's a big crowd down-stairs, and Tim's grog is getting to
their heads, and they're riddy for any sort of a job. There are
a couple of Italian cut-throats, and though I can't understand
much of their lingo, yet I cotched enough of the same to make
me sartin they mean to rob ye."</p>

<p>"But would they dare try it in the house here?"</p>

<p>"Whisht now, there isn't anything they wouldn't thry, if they
thought there was a chance of making a ha'pence at it. They've
murdered men afore to-night, and they would just as lief slip
up here and cut your wizen as they would ate a piece of macaroni.
Whisht now, and I'll give ye the partic'lars and inshtruct ye
what to do. It wouldn't be safe for ye to git up and go out, for
they'll folly ye and garrote ye afore ye could raich a safe place.
I would stay here and watch with ye, but that I've overstayed
me time alriddy, and I'll catch thunder whin I git back home,
'cause I can't make the boss belave the raison why I staid. Here's
a pistol," added the Irishman, shoving a five-shooter into the
hand of the astonished lad, "and ivery barrel is loaded, and it
niver misses fire, as the victims can tell ye as have been hit
by the same. Do ye take this, bolt yer door, and if anybody comes
poking in the room after I'm gone, just bore a hole through him,
and then ax him if he ain't ashamed of himself to steal into a
private apartment in that shtyle. Take me word for it, he won't
come agin."</p>

<p>"I should think not," said Tom, who was dressing himself. "But
I don't like the idea of shooting a man."</p>

<p>"Nor do I, but it's loikely to be a chice between shooting him
or him shooting ye, and ye are at liberty to decide."</p>

<p>And with a few parting words of caution the Irishman took his
departure, first pausing long enough to advise Tom to change his
quarters if he was spared until the morrow, and suggesting that
the wisest thing he could do was to get out of New York as speedily
as he knew how.</p>

<p>As may well be imagined, Tom Gordon was not likely to fall asleep
again that night, so, having fully dressed himself, he sat down
on the edge of the bed to wait and watch.</p>

<p>A small transom over his door admitted enough light to discern
objects with sufficient distinctness in the room, and he carefully
shoved the bolt in place, feeling he was prepared for any emergency.</p>

<p>Even with such an exciting subject to occupy his thoughts, he
could not fail to wonder and fear for his missing friend. He prayed
Heaven to watch over the boy's footsteps and to prevent his wandering
into any danger, while the feeling that the poor fellow was already
beyond all human help weighed down the heart of Tom like a mountain
of lead.</p>

<p>This suspense did not continue long when the watchful lad heard
some one ascending the stairs&mdash;an action which might mean nothing
or a great deal.</p>

<p>The room occupied by the boy was along a narrow hall, perhaps
fifty feet in length, the apartment being half that distance from
the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>It seemed to Tom that there was an attempt to smother the sound
made by the feet, which plainly belonged to two people, though
the effort was far from being a success.</p>

<p>"They may be going to their own room, after all"&mdash;</p>

<p>The heart of the lad gave a great bound, for at that instant
the footsteps paused directly in front of his own door, and he
could hear the men muttering to each other in low tones.</p>

<p>"They're looking for me," was the conclusion of the boy, who
grasped his pistol more rigidly, and rose to the standing posture.</p>

<p>"If they want me, all they've got to do is to take me."</p>

<p>What was the amazement of the youth to see at this moment, while
his eyes were fixed upon the door, the iron bolt slowly move back,
without, so far as he could see, the least human agency.</p>

<p>This was a house, indeed, in which such characters were given
every facility they could wish to ply their unholy vocation.</p>

<p>Immediately after the fastening went back, the latch was lifted,
and the door swung noiselessly inward.</p>

<p>As it did so, a head, covered only with a mass of shock hair,
which hung down like pieces of tarred rope, and with the lower
part of the face veiled by a black, stringy beard, was thrust
far enough within to show the shoulders. Directly behind appeared
another face, placed on a shorter body, but none the less repellant
in expression, and the two were forcing their way into the room,
when they paused.</p>

<p>They seemed to conclude that it would be best to consider the
matter further before rushing in there.</p>

<p>Instead of seeing a boy sound asleep in bed, waiting for them
to rob him of all his earthly possessions, they found themselves
confronted by a wide-awake lad, with his revolver pointed straight
at their villainous heads.</p>

<p>"Why don't you come in?" asked Tom, never lowering his weapon.</p>

<p>"Put him down!" said the foremost of the villains, in broken
English, hoping to frighten the lad.</p>

<p>"I don't feel like doing it just now," was the reply, while the
arm remained as fixed as a bar of iron.</p>

<p>Tom did not intend to shoot unless they advanced upon him; but,
not being accustomed to the weapon, he was unaware that a very
slight pressure was enough to discharge it. Unconsciously he exerted
that slight pressure, and, while the miscreants were glaring in
the door, the pistol was fired.</p>

<p>What was more, the bullet struck one of the Italians, who, with
a howl of pain, wheeled about and hurried down-stairs, followed
by his terror-stricken companion.</p>

<p>Tom was half-frightened out of his wits, and made up his mind
that the best thing he could do was to get out of the place without
any further delay.</p>

<p>The only way to escape was to go down the stairs, the same as
his assailants had done.</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant duty; but, remembering what the Irishman
had told him, and filled with an uncontrollable aversion against
staying any longer, he hurried out, pausing only long enough to
catch up his small bundle of clothing.</p>

<p>In the smoky, hot room down-stairs, the scene was nearly the
same as when he left it a couple of hours before to go to bed.
The two Italians were invisible, and the little affray up-stairs
seemed to have attracted no attention at all. The bartender was
too much occupied to notice the lad, who made his way outside
into the clear, frosty air, where he inhaled a few deep draughts
to give him new life and courage.</p>

<p>He knew not which way to turn, but he was confident he could
find some safe lodging-place without going far, and he moved along
the street, where there were plenty of pedestrians abroad, even
though the hour was so late.</p>

<p>He was quite near the river, and determined not to be caught
in such a trap again. He walked slowly, scrutinizing as well as
he could the exterior of each building in sight, where the wayfarer
and traveler was invited to step within and secure food and lodging.</p>

<p>In this manner he passed several houses, and was on the point
of turning into one which seemed to have an inviting look, when
his attention was arrested by a lad who was running toward him
from the rear.</p>

<p>He was panting and laboring along as though about exhausted.</p>

<p>As he reached the wondering Tom, who stopped and turned aside
to let him pass, the stranger paused and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Say, sonny, just hold that watch, will you, till I come back?"</p>

<p>And before the boy fairly understood the question, the other
shoved a gold watch and chain into his hands, then darted into
an alleyway and disappeared.</p>

<p>He had scarcely done so when two swift footed policemen came
dashing along, as if in pursuit.</p>

<p>"Here he is!" exclaimed one, catching hold of Tom's arm, and
dealing him a stunning blow on the head with his locust.</p>

<p>"That's the little imp," added the other, the two guardians of
the law pouncing upon the lad as if he were a Hercules, who meant
to turn upon and rend them.</p>

<p>"I haven't done anything," remonstrated Tom, feeling that some
fearful mistake had been made.</p>

<p>"Shut up, you little thief!" yelled the policeman, whacking him
on the head again with his club. "Ah, here is the watch on him!
We've been looking for you, my boy, for a month, and we've got
you at last."</p>
