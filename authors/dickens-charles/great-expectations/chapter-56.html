He lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between his 
committal for trial, and the coming round of the Sessions. He had 
broken two ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he 
breathed with great pain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was 
a consequence of his hurt, that he spoke so low as to be scarcely 
audible; therefore, he spoke very little. But, he was ever ready to 
listen to me, and it became the first duty of my life to say to him, 
and read to him, what I knew he ought to hear. 

<p>Being fur too ill to remain in the common prison, he was re- 
moved, after the first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me 
opportunities of being with him that I could not otherwise have 
had. And but for his illness he would have been put in irons, for he 
was regarded as a determined prison-breaker, and I know not what 
else. 

<p>Although I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; 
hence, the regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long 
enough to record on his face any alight changes that occurred in 
his physical state. I do not recollect that I once saw any change in it 
for the better; he wasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, 
day by day, from the day when the prison door closed upon him. 

<p>The kind of submission or resignation that he showed, was that 
of a man who was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, 
from his manner or from a whispered word or two which escaped 
him, that he pondered over the question whether he might have 
been a better man under better circumstances. But, he never justi- 
fied himself by a hint tending that way, or tried to bend the past 
out of its eternal shape. 

<p>It happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his 
desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in 
attendance on him. A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his 
eyes on me with a trustful look, as if he were confident that I had 
seen some small redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when 
I was a little child. As to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, 
and I never knew him complain. 

<p>When the Sessions came round, Mr Jaggers caused an applica- 
tion to be made for the postponement of his trial until the following 
Sessions. It was obviously made with the assurance that he could 
not live so long, and was refused. The trial came on at once, and, 
when he was put to the bar, he was seated in a chair. No objection 
was made to my getting close to the dock, on the outside of it, and 
holding the hand that he stretched forth to me. 

<p>The trial was very shod and very clear. Such things as could be 
said for him, were said -- how he had taken to industrious habits, 
and had thriven lawfully and reputably. But, nothing could unsay 
the fact that he had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge 
and Jury. It was impossible to try him for that, and do otherwise 
than find him guilty. 

<p>At that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terrible ex- 
perience of that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passing 
of Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of 
Death. But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now 
holds before me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these 
words, that I saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the 
Judge to receive that sentence together. Foremost among the two- 
and-thirty, was he; seated, that he might get breath enough to keep 
life in him. 

<p>The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the 
moment, down to the drops of April rain on the windows of the 
court, glittering in the rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I 
again stood outside it at the corner with his hand in mine, were the 
two-and-thirty men and women; some defiant, some stricken with 
terror, some sobbing and weeping, some covering their faces, some 
staring gloomily about. There had been shrieks from among the 
women convicts, but they had been stilled, and a hush had suc- 
ceeded. The sheriffs with their great chains and nosegays, other 
civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great gallery full of 
people -- a large theatrical audience -- looked on, as the two-and- 
thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then, the Judge 
addressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom 
he must single out for special address, was one who almost from 
his infancy had been an offender against the laws; who, after re- 
peated imprisonments and punishments, had been at length sen- 
tenced to exile for a term of years; and who, under circumstances of 
great violence and daring had made his escape and been re-sen- 
tenced to exile for life. That miserable man would seem for a time 
to have become convinced of his errors, when far removed from the 
scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a peaceable and honest 
life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those propensities and 
passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a 
scourge to society, he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance, 
and had come back to the country where he was proscribed. Being 
here presently denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading 
the officers of Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of 
flight, he had resisted them, and had -- he best knew whether by 
express design, or in the blindness of his hardihood -- caused the 
death of his denouncer, to whom his whole career was known. The 
appointed punishment for his retum to the land that had cast him 
out, being Death, and his case being this aggravated case, he must 
prepare himself to Die. 

<p>The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, 
through the glittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a 
broad shaft of light between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, 
linking both together, and perhaps reminding some among the 
audience, how both were passing on, with absolute equality, to the 
greater Judgment that knoweth all things and cannot err. Rising 
for a moment, a distinct speck of face in this way of light, the 
prisoner said, `My Lord, I have received my sentence of Death 
from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,' and sat down again. There 
was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had to say 
to the rest. Then, they were all formally doomed, and some of them 
were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a hag- 
gard look of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or 
three shook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of 
herb they had taken from the sweet herbs lying about. He went last 
of all, because of having to be helped from his chair and to go very 
slowly; and he held my hand while all the others were removed, and 
while the audience got up (putting their dresses right, as they might 
at church or elsewhere) and pointed down at this criminal or at that, 
and most of all at him and me. 

<p>I earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Re- 
corder's Report was made, but, in the dread of his lingering on, I 
began that night to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of 
State, setting forth my knowledge of him, and how it was that he 
had come back for my sake. I wrote it as fervently and pathetically 
as I could, and when I had finished it and sent it in, I wrote out 
other petitions to such men in authority as I hoped were the most 
merciful, and drew up one to the Crown itself. For several days 
and nights after he was sentenced I took no rest except when I fell 
asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed in these appeals. And 
after I had sent them in, I could not keep away from the places 
where they were, but felt as if they were more hopeful and less 
desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonable restlessness 
and pain of mind, I would roam the streets of an evening, wander- 
ing by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions. To 
the present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold 
dusty spring night, with their ranges of stern shut-up mansions 
and their long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this asso- 
ciation. 

<p>The daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he 
was more strictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of 
an intention of carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before 
I sat down at his bedside, and told the officer who was always there, 
that I was willing to do anything that would assure him of the 
singleness of my designs. Nobody was hard with him, or with me. 
There was duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly. The 
officer always gave me the assurance that he was worse, and some 
other sick prisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who 
attended on them as sick nurses (malefactors, but not incapable of 
kindness, GOD be thanked!), always joined in the same report. 

<p>As the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie 
placidly looking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in 
his face, until some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and 
then it would subside again. Sometimes he was almost, or quite, 
unable to speak; then, he would answer me with slight pressures 
on my hand, and I grew to understand his meaning very well. 

<p>The number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater 
change in him than I had seen yet. His eyes were turned towards 
the door, and lighted up as I entered. 

<p>`Dear boy,' he said, as I sat down by his bed: `I thought you 
was late. But I knowed you couldn't be that.' 

<p>`It is just the time,' said I. `I waited for it at the gate.' 

<p>`You always waits at the gate; don't you, dear boy?' 

<p>`Yes. Not to lose a moment of the time.' 

<p>`Thank'ee dear boy, thank'ee. God bless you! You've never 
deserted me, dear boy.' 

<p>I pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had 
once meant to desert him. 

<p>`And what's the best of all,' he said, `you've been more comfort- 
able alonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun 
shone. That's best of all.' 

<p>He lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he 
would, and love me though he did, the light left his face ever and 
again, and a film came over the placid look at the white ceiling. 

<p>`Are you in much pain to-day?' 

<p>`I don't complain of none, dear boy.' 

<p>`You never do complain.' 

<p>He had spoken his last words. He smiled, and I understood his 
touch to mean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his 
breast. I laid it there, and he smiled again, and put both his hands 
upon it. 

<p>The allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking 
round, I found the governor of the prison standing near me, and 
he whispered, `You needn't go yet.' I thanked him gratefully, and 
asked, `Might I speak to him, if he can hear me?' 

<p>The governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The 
change, though it was made without noise, drew back the film from 
the placid look at the white ceiling, and he looked most affec- 
tionately at me. 

<p>`Dear Magwitch, I must tell you, now at last. You understand 
what I say ?' 

<p>A gentle pressure on my hand. 

<p>`You had a child once, whom you loved and lost.' 

<p>A stronger pressure on my hand. 

<p>`She lived and found powerful friends. She is living now. She is 
a lady and very beautiful. And I love her!' 

<p>With a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but 
for my yielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips. 
Then, he gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands 
lying on it. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and 
passed away, and his head dropped quietly on his breast. 

<p>Mindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the 
two men who went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there 
were no better words that I could say beside his bed, than `O 
Lord, be merciful to him, a sinner!'
