<p>Mrs. Woodchuck was not so sorry, after all, that she had to leave
her home in the pasture. You see, she always moved twice a year,
anyhow. Every fall she went into the woods to live; and every
spring she returned to Farmer Green's pasture. And every time that
Mrs. Woodchuck moved, she made a new house for herself.
</p>
<p>To be sure, there were plenty of chucks that never went to all that
trouble. They were the lazy kind. They just hunted around till they
found an old, empty house and then they moved in and made
themselves right at home. But that was not the way of Billy
Woodchuck's mother. She wanted everything neat and clean.
</p><p>You remember that when Farmer Green blasted away the old stump near
Mrs. Woodchuck's bedroom he tore a hole in the very roof of the
house. And Billy and his mother and his brothers and sisters went
into the woods and spent the night in a house where his great
grandmother had once lived.
</p><p>Mrs. Woodchuck said it would do, until she could dig a new one.
</p><p>The very next morning she started to work. And all her children
helped her.
</p><p>Billy told his mother that they ought to build the back door first
of all. You see he remembered what his mother had taught him, early
in the summer, when he made his play-houses.
</p><p>"Nonsense!" she said. "Of course, we must have a back door. But we
must dig it from the <u>inside up</u>, and not from the <u>outside down</u>."
</p><p>And she explained that when you build a door by digging <u>down</u> into
the ground, there's always a heap of dirt about it, which anybody
can see. But when you are out of sight in your tunnel you can dig
right <u>up</u> to the top of the ground and make a small, round door,
beneath a hummock of grass, or a stone, or a stump. People must
have very sharp eyes to see a back door that's made in that way,
for the dirt all falls <u>inside</u> your house.
</p><p>With all the help she had, Mrs. Woodchuck's new house was soon
finished. But it was done none too soon. She had hardly carried in
clean grass for the beds, when her children began to feel very
sleepy. At least, all of them except Billy. He was just as wide
awake as his mother.
</p><p>Even after his brothers and sisters had been tucked up for their
winter's nap he was as spry as anything. And he told his mother
that he was not going to spend the winter sleeping.
</p><p>"Jimmy Rabbit says that it's great fun to play in the snow," he
said.
</p><p>Mrs. Woodchuck couldn't help smiling; for at that very moment Billy
was yawning as wide a yawn as you ever saw on a young chuck's face.
Though he didn't know it, he was already growing drowsy. And his
mother knew very well that no matter how much he wanted to stay
awake, in a short time he would be sound asleep.
</p><p>Though Jimmy Rabbit came to Billy's house the very next day and
called and called to him, he never came out at all.
