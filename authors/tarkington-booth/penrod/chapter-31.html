<p>Penrod was out in the yard, staring at the empty marquee. The
sun was on the horizon line, so far behind the back fence, and
a western window of the house blazed in gold unbearable to the
eye: his day was nearly over. He sighed, and took from the inside
pocket of his new jacket the "sling-shot" aunt Sarah Crim had
given him that morning.</p>

<p>He snapped the rubbers absently. They held fast; and his next
impulse was entirely irresistible. He found a shapely stone, fitted
it to the leather, and drew back the ancient catapult for a shot.
A sparrow hopped upon a branch between him and the house, and
he aimed at the sparrow, but the reflection from the dazzling
window struck in his eyes as he loosed the leather.</p>

<p>He missed the sparrow, but not the window. There was a loud crash,
and to his horror he caught a glimpse of his father, stricken
in mid-shaving, ducking a shower of broken glass, glittering razor
flourishing wildly. Words crashed with the glass, stentorian words,
fragmentary but collossal.</p>

<p>Penrod stood petrified, a broken sling in his hand. He could
hear his parent's booming descent of the back stairs, instant
and furious; and then, red-hot above white lather, Mr. Schofield
burst out of the kitchen door and hurtled forth upon his son.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he demanded, shaking Penrod by the shoulder.
"Ten minutes ago, for the very first time in our lives, your mother
and I were saying we were proud of you, and here you go and throw
a rock at me through the window when I'm shaving for dinner!"</p>

<p>"I didn't!" Penrod quavered. "I was shooting at a sparrow, and
the sun got in his eyes, and the sling broke&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What sling?"</p>

<p>"This'n."</p>

<p>"Where'd you get that devilish thing? Don't you know I've forbidden
you a thousand times&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It ain't mine," said Penrod. "It's yours."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the boy meekly. "Aunt Sarah Crim gave it to
me this morning and told me to give it back to you. She said she
took it away from you thirty-five years ago. You killed her hen,
she said. She told me some more to tell you, but I've forgotten."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mr. Schofield.</p>

<p>He took the broken sling in his hand, looked at it long and thoughtfully&mdash;and
he looked longer, and quite as thoughtfully, at Penrod. Then he
turned away, and walked toward the house.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, papa," said Penrod.</p>

<p>Mr. Schofield coughed, and, as he reached the door, called back,
but without turning his head.</p>

<p>"Never mind, little boy. A broken window isn't much harm."</p>

<p>When he had gone in, Penrod wandered down the yard to the back
fence, climbed upon it, and sat in reverie there.</p>

<p>A slight figure appeared, likewise upon a fence, beyond two neighbouring
yards.</p>

<p>"Yay, Penrod!" called comrade Sam Williams.</p>

<p>"Yay!" returned Penrod, mechanically.</p>

<p>"I caught Billy Blue Hill!" shouted Sam, describing retribution
in a manner perfectly clear to his friend. "You were mighty lucky
to get out of it."</p>

<p>"I know that!"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't of, if it hadn't been for Marjorie."</p>

<p>"Well, don't I know that?" Penrod shouted, with heat.</p>

<p>"Well, so long!" called Sam, dropping from his fence; and the
friendly voice came then, more faintly, "Many happy returns of
the day, Penrod!"</p>

<p>And now, a plaintive little whine sounded from below Penrod's
feet, and, looking down, he saw that Duke, his wistful, old, scraggly
dog sat in the grass, gazing seekingly up at him.</p>

<p>The last shaft of sunshine of that day fell graciously and like
a blessing upon the boy sitting on the fence. Years afterward,
a quiet sunset would recall to him sometimes the gentle evening
of his twelfth birthday, and bring him the picture of his boy
self, sitting in rosy light upon the fence, gazing pensively down
upon his wistful, scraggly, little old dog, Duke. But something
else, surpassing, he would remember of that hour, for, in the
side street, close by, a pink skirt flickered from behind a shade
tree to the shelter of the fence, there was a gleam of amber curls,
and Penrod started, as something like a tiny white wing fluttered
by his head, and there came to his ears the sound of a light laugh
and of light footsteps departing, the laughter tremulous, the
footsteps fleet.</p>

<p>In the grass, between Duke's forepaws, there lay a white note,
folded in the shape of a cocked hat, and the sun sent forth a
final amazing glory as Penrod opened it and read:</p>

<p>"Your my bow."</p>
