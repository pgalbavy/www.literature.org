<p>It is with the most extreme mortification that I record my ensuing
experiences, for I felt that I could not honourably accept my
salary without earning it by carrying out the parent Poor's wishes.
That first morning I endeavoured to direct my pupil's steps toward
the Musee de Cluny, with the purpose of inciting him to instructive
study; but in the mildest, yet most immovable manner, he proposed
Longchamps and the races as a substitute, to conclude with dinner
at La Cascade and supper at Maxim's or the Cafe' Blanche, in case
we should meet engaging company. I ventured the vainest efforts
to reason with him, making for myself a very uncomfortable breakfast,
though without effect upon him of any visibility. His air was
uninterruptedly mild and modest; he rarely lifted his eyes, but
to my most earnest argument replied only by ordering more eggs
and saying in a chastened voice:</p>

<p>"Oh no; it is always best to begin school with a vacation. To
Longchamps&mdash;we!"</p>

<p>I should say at once that through this young man I soon became
an amateur of the remarkable North-American idioms, of humour
and incomparable brevities often more interesting than those evolved
by the thirteen or more dialects of my own Naples. Even at our
first breakfast I began to catch lucid glimpses of the intention
in many of his almost incomprehensible statements. I was able,
even, to penetrate his meaning when he said that although he was
"strong for aged parent," he himself had suffered much anguish
from overwork of the "earnest youth racquette" in his late travels,
and now desired to "create considerable trouble for Paris."</p>

<p>Naturally, I did not wish to begin by antagonizing my pupil&mdash;an
estrangement at the commencement would only lead to his deceiving
me, or a continued quarrel, in which case I should be of no service
to my kind patron, so that after a strained interval I considered
it best to surrender.</p>

<p>We went to Longchamps.</p>

<p>That was my first mistake; the second was to yield to him concerning
the latter part of his programme; but opposition to Mr. Poor,
Jr. had a curious effect of inutility. He had not in the least
the air of obstinacy,&mdash;nothing could have been less like rudeness;
he neither frowned not smiled; no, he did not seem even to be
insisting; on the contrary, never have I beheld a milder countenance,
nor heard a pleasanter voice; yet the young man was so completely
baffling in his mysterious way that I considered him unique to
my experience.</p>

<p>Thus, when I urged him not to place large wagers in the pesage,
his whispered reply was strange and simple&mdash;"Watch me!" This he
conclusively said as he deposited another thousand-franc note,
which, within a few moments, accrued to the French government.</p>

<p>Longchamps was but the beginning of a series of days and nights
which wore upon my constitution&mdash;not indeed with the intensity
of mortification which my former conspicuosity had engendered,
yet my sorrows were stringent. It is true that I had been, since
the age of seventeen, no stranger to the gaieties and dissipations
afforded by the capitals of Europe; I may say I had exhausted
these, yet always with some degree of quiet, including intervals
of repose. I was tired of all the great foolishnesses of youth,
and had thought myself done with them. Now I found myself plunged
into more uproarious waters than I had ever known I, who had hoped
to begin a life of usefulness and peace, was forced to dwell in
the midst of a riot, pursuing my extraordinary charge.</p>

<p>There is no need that I should describe those days and nights.
They remain in my memory as a confusion of bad music, crowds,
motor-cars and champagne of which Poor Jr. was a distributing
centre. He could never be persuaded to the Louvre, the Carnavalet,
or the Luxembourg; in truth, he seldom rose in time to reach the
museums, for they usually close at four in the afternoon. Always
with the same inscrutable meekness of countenance, each night
he methodically danced the cake-walk at Maxim's or one of the
Montemarte restaurants, to the cheers of acquaintances of many
nationalities, to whom he offered libations with prodigal enormity.
He carried with him, about the boulevards at night, in the highly
powerful car he had hired, large parties of strange people, who
would loudly sing airs from the Folie-Rouge (to my unhappy shudderings)
all the way from the fatiguing Bal Bullier to the Cafe' de Paris,
where the waiters soon became affluent.</p>

<p>And how many of those gaily dressed and smiling ladies whose
bright eyes meet yours on the veranda of the Theatre Marigny were
provided with excessive suppers and souvenir fans by the inexhaustible
Poor Jr.! He left a trail of pink hundred-franc notes behind him,
like a running boy dropping paper in the English game; and he
kept showers of gold louis dancing in the air about him, so that
when we entered the various cafes or "American bars" a cheer (not
vocal but to me of perfect audibility) went up from the hungry
and thirsty and borrowing, and from the attendants. Ah, how tired
I was of it, and how I endeavoured to discover a means to draw
him to the museums, and to Notre Dame and the Pantheon!</p>

<p>And how many times did I unwillingly find myself in the too enlivening
company of those pretty supper-girls, and what jokings upon his
head-top did the poor bald gentleman not undergo from those same
demoiselles with the bright eyes, the wonderful hats, and the
fluffy dresses!</p>

<p>How often among those gay people did I find myself sadly dreaming
of that grey pongee skirt and the beautiful heart that had understood!
Should I ever see that lady? Not, I knew, alas! in the whirl about
Poor Jr.! As soon look for a nun at the Cafe' Blanche!</p>

<p>For some reason I came to be persuaded that she had left Paris,
that she had gone away; and I pictured her&mdash;a little despairingly&mdash;on
the borders of Lucerne, with the white Alps in the sky above her,&mdash;or
perhaps listening to the evening songs on the Grand Canal, and
I would try to feel the little rocking of her gondola, making
myself dream that I sat at her feet. Or I could see the grey flicker
of the pongee skirt in the twilight distance of cathedral aisles
with a chant sounding from a chapel; and, so dreaming, I would
start spasmodically, to hear the red-coated orchestra of a cafe'
blare out into "Bedelia," and awake to the laughter and rouge
and blague which that dear pongee had helped me for a moment to
forget!</p>

<p>To all places, Poor Jr., though never unkindly, dragged me with
him, even to make the balloon ascent at the Porte Maillot on a
windy evening. Without embarrassment I confess that I was terrified,
that I clung to the ropes with a clutch which frayed my gloves,
while Poor Jr. leaned back against the side of the basket and
gazed upward at the great swaying ball, with his hands in his
pockets, humming the strange ballad that was his favourite musical
composition:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"The prettiest girl I ever saw<br/>
Was sipping cider through a straw-aw-haw!"

</p>
</div>
<p>In that horrifying basket, scrambling for a foothold while it
swung through arcs that were gulfs, I believed that my sorrows
approached a sudden conclusion, but finding myself again upon
the secure earth, I decided to come to an understanding with the
young man.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the following morning, I entered his apartment
and addresses myself to Poor Jr. as severely as I could (for,
truthfully, in all his follies I had found no ugliness in his
spirit&mdash;only a good-natured and inscrutable desire of wild amusement)
reminding him of the authority his father had deputed to me, and
having the venturesomeness to hint that the son should show some
respect to my superior age.</p>

<p>To my consternation he replied by inquiring if I had shaved my
head as yet that morning. I could only drop in a chair, stammering
to know what he meant.</p>

<p>"Didn't you suppose I knew?" he asked, elevating himself slightly
on his elbow from the pillow. "Three weeks ago I left my aged
parent in London and ran over here for a day. I saw you at the
Cafe' de la Paix, and even then I knew that it was shaved, not
naturally bald. When you came here I recognized you like a shot,
and that was why I was glad to accept you as a guardian. I've
enjoyed myself considerably of late, and you've been the best
part of it, &mdash;I think you are a wonderation! I wouldn't have
any other governess for the world, but you surpass the orchestra
when you beg me to respect your years! I will bet you four dollars
to a lead franc piece that you are younger than I am!"</p>

<p>Imagine the completeness of my dismay! Although he spoke in tones
the most genial, and without unkindness, I felt myself a man of
tatters before him, ashamed to have him know my sorry secret,
hopeless to see all chance of authority over him gone at once,
and with it my opportunity to earn a salary so generous, for if
I could continue to be but an amusement to him and only part of
his deception of Lambert R. Poor, my sense of honour must be fit
for the guillotine indeed.</p>

<p>I had a little struggle with myself, and I think I must have
wiped some amounts of the cold perspiration from my absurd head
before I was able to make an answer. It may be seen what a coward
I was, and how I feared to begin again that search for employment.
At last, however, I was in self-control, so that I might speak
without being afraid that my voice would shake.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," I said. "It seemed to me that my deception would
not cause any harm, and that I might be useful in spite of it&mdash;enough
to earn my living. It was on account of my being very poor; and
there are two little children I must take care of. &mdash;Well,
at least, it is over now. I have had great shame, but I must not
have greater."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked me rather sharply.</p>

<p>"I will leave immediately," I said, going to the door. "Since
I am no more than a joke, I can be of no service to your father
or to you; but you must not think that I am so unreasonable as
to be angry with you. A man whom you have beheld reduced to what
I was, at the Cafe' de la Paix, is surely a joke to the whole
world! I will write to your father before I leave the hotel and
explain that I feel myself unqualified&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're going to write to him why you give it up!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I shall make no report of espionage," I answered, with, perhaps,
some bitterness, "and I will leave the letter for you to read
and to send, of yourself. It shall only tell him that as a man
of honour I cannot keep a position for which I have no qualification."</p>

<p>I was going to open the door, bidding him adieu, when he called
out to me.</p>

<p>"Look here!" he said, and he jumped out of bed in his pajamas
and came quickly, and held out his hand. "Look here, Ansolini,
don't take it that way. I know you've had pretty hard times, and
if you'll stay, I'll get good. I'll go to the Louvre with you
this afternoon; we'll dine at one of the Duval restaurants, and
go to that new religious tragedy afterwards. If you like, we'll
leave Paris to-morrow. There's a little too much movement here,
maybe. For God's sake, let your hair grow, and we'll go down to
Italy and study bones and ruins and delight the aged parent! &mdash;It's
all right, isn't it?"</p>

<p>I shook the hand of that kind Poor Jr. with a feeling in my heart
that kept me from saying how greatly I thanked him&mdash;and I was
sure that I could do anything for him in the world!</p>
