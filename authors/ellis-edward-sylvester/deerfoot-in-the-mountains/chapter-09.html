<p>There was wonderful virtue in the remedy used by the dwarf Indian.
You and I know that in many a mountaineer's cabin and barbarian's
wigwam are found curatives which surpass anything known to what
we call medical science. The proofs of this fact are too numerous
to be questioned.</p>

<p>As Deerfoot rode away with Whirlwind on a walk, he knew his hurt
had been greatly benefited. With his foot hanging, the flow of
blood downward tended to increase the pain, but there was not
only less of it than at any time since his mishap, but it was
perceptibly decreasing. The swelling was going down, for the stocking
was becoming looser. He timidly tapped the ribs of the stallion
with his heel and was delighted to find it caused less of a twinge
than he expected.</p>

<p>At the first water he paused, but would not allow Whirlwind to
kneel to help him dismount. He let himself down rather gingerly
and did not suffer therefrom. At the side of the little stream
he examined his injury. The swelling was markedly less and he
was able to press it without wincing. He had brought away the
surplus berries, but, instead of using them, moistened the old
binding and replaced it. It might be that he would not be able
to find more of the remedy, and it was prudent to husband the
supply. Observant as he was, he did not recall ever having seen
the shrub growing, and was certain it was not found in Ohio or
Kentucky.</p>

<p>One potent factor in the rapid recovery of the Shawanoe must
not be overlooked; that was his own superb health and condition.
You need not be reminded that when anything goes amiss with us
physically, nature sets to work at once to right it, and the most
that medical skill can do is to sit by and watch for contingencies
and give assistance as opportunity offers, which is less frequent
than many think. A system that has not been weakened by dissipation
or the violation of the laws of health will do wonders in the
way of repairing disease or injury.</p>

<p>It was not yet noon when Deerfoot became so hopeful and curious
that he suddenly slipped from the back of his horse without checking
his walk. Whirlwind must have been startled, for he instantly
stopped and turned his head to learn what it meant.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," said his master with his familiar chuckle. "Deerfoot
is almost well and will soon be himself again."</p>

<p>He ventured to bear a part of his weight on the weak leg. It
caused a twinge, and he instantly shifted to the other foot, but
with the transference of weight the pain departed, which was one
of the best of signs.</p>

<p>The days of miracles passed long ago, and with all the virtues
that may linger in the Thomsonian system of medicine, no possibility
existed of the Shawanoe regaining the full use of his limb for
several days to come. None the less, his recovery was astonishingly
rapid, for, as I have said, his perfect vigor and healthfulness
of body greatly aided in such recovery. Added to this was the
intelligence he used. While he frequently tested and experimented
with the injury, he did not venture too far. Now and then he carefully
shifted a part of his weight to his left limb, then he hobbled
a few steps, but stopped immediately at the first warning twinge.
It may be said he encouraged the ankle to do its best to get well.</p>

<p>It was a little past meridian when he reached a place which showed
a considerable growth of grass, and letting himself down to the
ground, he told Whirlwind to attend to his own dinner. As for
himself, he preferred to wait until nightfall, or the next day.
At present all his attention was given to his hurt.</p>

<p>He decided, after inspecting the bandage, to replace it with
a new one. He therefore flung the old one aside and mashed the
berries and applied them as the dwarf had done. But the injured
limb had so decreased in size that the stocking failed to hold
it in place. The motion of the horse caused the bandage to slip
over the foot. This was remedied by taking some of the threads
of fringe from the skirt of his hunting shirt and tying them round
the poultice. He expected the increased pressure to hurt, but
to his pleased surprise the opposite effect resulted.</p>

<p>It had been in his mind to construct a crude crutch to aid in
hobbling around, but he decided not to do so. If his recovery
continued without relapse he could do well enough without such
aid.</p>

<p>On the journey from the Ohio to the Pacific, as well as during
their intimacy in the new State, Deerfoot and Mul-tal-la had talked
so much about the home of the latter that the Shawanoe felt himself
well informed. A hundred years ago that tribe numbered several
thousand, and they lived in villages, some of which were long
distances from one another. The country over which they roamed
covered thousands of square miles of mountain, prairie and stream.
Mul-tal-la described his own village as consisting of more than
a hundred lodges, located near the middle of the Blackfoot territory.
The tepees were strung along the eastern bank of a stream of considerable
size, and was the dwelling-place of Taggarak, the most famous
of the Blackfoot war chiefs and the head of the other sachems,
most of whom lived in different villages. Deerfoot had formed
so clear a picture in his own mind that he believed he could identify
the Indian town at first sight, though it might be its resemblance
to others would prevent such recognition.</p>

<p>The Blackfoot country lies to the east of the Rocky Mountains,
while he was on the west of the stupendous range. It was necessary,
therefore, to make his way through and over the backbone of the
continent, in order to rejoin his friends. Inasmuch as the land
of the Assiniboines was not only farther east, but many leagues
to the northward, it will be understood that the party that had
tried to run off Whirlwind had ventured on a most extensive raid,
which brought them no reward except that of having slain several
of Chief Amokeat's Nez Perces.</p>

<p>A requirement for getting through the mountains was an avenue,
since the passage could be effected in no other way except by
flying, and Deerfoot was not yet ready to try that means.</p>

<p>Using all the woodcraft of which he was master, he spent the
remainder of the day in searching for such a pass. He scanned
every part of his field of vision, but the day was drawing to
a close before anything like success came to him. He had learned
that the warriors to the east and west of the Rockies made journeys
now and then back and forth. Sometimes these were raiding expeditions,
at other times were merely rambles or visits, when the red men
proved themselves capable of hospitality and friendship.</p>

<p>These people must be acquainted with the readiest means of travel,
and wherever they walked or rode they left inevitable signs to
guide others. The sun was still two hours above the horizon when
Deerfoot came upon a plainly marked trail, leading almost due
east and west. Without hesitation he turned into it. Instead of
being a comparatively narrow passage, however, like that traversed
by Mul-tal-la and George and Victor Shelton when they thought
they were embroiled with the Shoshones, it was two or three miles
wide, and even wider in some places. The ground was so depressed
that it partook of the nature of a valley, through the middle
of which a considerable stream of water had flowed, fed no doubt,
as was the rule, by the melting snows and ice of the mountains.</p>

<p>The surface of this pass varied greatly. There were portions
where boulders, rocks and ravines seemed to bar all progress,
but these obstructions, upon a closer approach, revealed passages
which could be easily traversed by horse or animal. Then came
long stretches of fairly level land, where grass, trees and shrubbery
were abundant. The mountains towered on the right and left, and
now and then directly in front, some of the peaks piercing the
sky far above the snow line.</p>

<p>Deerfoot would not have dared to attempt this passage but for
the proofs that it had been traversed before by others. In fact,
shortly after he made the change of direction he came upon a spot
where a large party had encamped not long previous. It was too
early in the day to halt for the night, and he allowed the stallion
to pass on.</p>

<p>An hour later, when casting about for a suitable camping site,
he descried an Indian party not far in advance, but a fourth of
a mile to the left. While they were using the same pass with himself,
they were traversing another portion and pursuing the same direction
as he.</p>

<p>Not convinced that it was well to seek their company, the Shawanoe
brought his glass to bear and surveyed the motley group that were
straggling eastward. The sight was interesting even to him, for
the Indians were composed of warriors, squaws, children and pappooses,
evidently migrating to a new home. They had eight or ten scraggly
ponies, each walking between two poles that served as shafts and
extended so far to the rear that they dragged on the ground. Thus
they served as runners or crude sleds. Held in place by thongs
and crosspieces, the primitive wagon gave a resting place for
tired squaws and children, their lazy husbands, or the furs and
luggage of the party. The primitive contrivances left a peculiar
trail.</p>

<p>The Indians numbered perhaps fifty or three score, and had nothing
attractive in their slouching, untidy appearance, which suggested
so many dusky tramps on their way to quarters that offered a better
opportunity for begging. Deerfoot had no wish to gain a closer
acquaintance and kept well to the south, so as to be sure of passing
without mingling with the company. As the ground was favorable
he put Whirlwind at a moderate gallop.</p>

<p>The dusky strangers showed their keenness of vision by observing
the stranger almost as soon as he descried them. He saw several
of the warriors who were on foot point toward him. They seemed
to expect Deerfoot to come forward, but, when he did not do so,
showed no further interest in him.</p>

<p>The wish to keep clear of the uninviting throng caused the youth
to ride on until the gathering gloom told him night was at hand.
He then saw he had come to another place that had served as a
camp for those who had traveled the way before him. There were
the little stream of icy water, the rank grass, the scattered
undergrowth and the boulders and rocks of every size and variety.</p>

<p>The air was so chilly that Deerfoot began gathering wood for
a fire, though he had nothing in the nature of food for an evening
meal. I have shown, however, that that was a matter of small account
to him. There was more than enough for Whirlwind, who, leaving
his master to himself, began edging up the pass, cropping the
choicest grass on the way. The Shawanoe had to grope in many places
before he collected enough fuel. He heaped a part against the
cold bare face of the rock, several paces from the winding brook,
whose waters were not only clear, but of the temperature of ice
itself.</p>

<p>With his usual deftness, Deerfoot soon had the fire blazing.
He had not seen living man or animal since his sight of the migrating
Indians, and he did not think it likely he would meet any before
morning. The past day and night had been so stirring that the
present rest was grateful. He assumed an easy posture, half reclining
on his blanket, and, supporting the upper part of his body on
one elbow, he drew out his Bible and held it so that the firelight
fell on the printed page.</p>

<p>He read for a full hour. Many of the passages were familiar to
him, and he could repeat them&mdash;as he often did when riding or
walking alone&mdash;without glancing within the volume. He read some
of the chapters a second and third time, dwelling on certain verses,
as if to make sure he lost nothing of their wonderful significance
and beauty. Finally, he closed the book and placed it back in
its usual resting place.</p>

<p>The fire was sinking and he flung more wood on the blaze. Then
moving beyond the circle of light, he gathered his blanket about
his shoulders, and, finding his ankle free from pain, leaned back
against the face of the rock and gave himself over to meditation
upon the fascinating and yet awesome mysteries of the Word and
of the Author of them all.</p>

<p>Everything favored the sweet, solemn reverie. He was utterly
alone, so far as any of his kind was concerned. He could hear
the soft impact of Whirlwind's hoof now and then as he shifted
his position and continued nibbling the grass. The night wind
sighed around the massive rock, fanning the blaze, and sometimes
rising to a moan as it careered upward and swirled about the stupendous
peaks towering near at hand. Far aloft he caught the faint honk
of the wild geese hurrying southward from the Arctic winter that
would soon lock the world in its rigid fetters. The dismal howl
of a mountain wolf sounded far off in the solitude and seemed
to linger tremblingly in the air. The silence was all the more
impressive because of these disturbances which belonged to the
time and place.</p>

<p>Leaning back against the rugged rock, in which a slight warmth
was perceptible from the contact farther away with the blaze,
Deerfoot's thoughts drifted to other places, scenes and persons.
He recalled his rambles with Ned Preston, Jo Springer, Jim Turner
and the quaint negro youth known as "Blossom," when all passed
through many stirring experiences, as you learned long since in
the "Boy Pioneer Series;" and of Jack Carleton and Otto Relstaub
in the "Log Cabin" stories. Fred Linden and Terry Clark were to
come later.</p>

<p>Deerfoot had known many men who later gained a place in history.
You will recall the high esteem in which he was held by General
W. H. Harrison, Governor of Indiana Territory, and afterward President
of the United States. It was he who declared, when a Senator in
Washington, that he looked upon the young Shawanoe as the greatest
Indian in many respects that ever lived, with natural abilities
superior to those of the renowned Tecumseh, who, nevertheless,
holds the most exalted position in the estimate of those that
came after him.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone, the renowned pioneer, regarded the youth highly,
while Simon Kenton, himself one of the best judges of men, was
as unstinted in his praise as Governor Harrison. The acceptance
of Christianity by this remarkable youth shut out forever the
political fame and power that he would have assuredly won had
he refused the true faith and been an Indian in his traits, tastes
and ambitions. But the sweet, soul-satisfying happiness that was
always his he would not have exchanged for the highest honors
the world can give.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Deerfoot Lost in Reverie by the Camp Fire.]</p>

<p>The musings of Deerfoot took a daintier, softer, tenderer tint.
His thoughts flew across the thousands of miles of forest, river,
mountain and prairie to one whose image was never absent from
his heart, and whom he hoped to see again and all in good time
call <em>wife</em>. He talked to none of her, for the theme was
too sacred to be shared with another, but next to his religion
it was the sweetest, dearest consolation of his life.</p>

"In the rainbow-tinted forest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the sleepy waters flow,&mdash;<br/>
Roamed I with a dark-haired maiden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In an autumn long ago;<br/>
And her dimpled hand was resting<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Timidly within mine own,<br/>
And her voice to mine replying,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a whispered undertone."
