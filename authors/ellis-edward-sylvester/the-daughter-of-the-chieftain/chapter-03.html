<p>While Ben Ripley was frolicking with little Alice and her Indian
friend Linna, the mother prepared the evening meal.</p>

<p>The candles were lighted, and they took their places at the table.</p>

<p>All this was new and strange to Linna. In her own home, she was
accustomed to sit on the ground, and use only her fingers for
knife and fork when taking food; but she was observant and quick,
and knowing how it had been with her, her friends soon did away
with her embarrassment. The mother cut her meat into small pieces,
spread butter&mdash;which the visitor looked at askance&mdash;on the brown
bread, and she had but to do as the rest, and all went well.</p>

<p>A few minutes after supper both girls became drowsy, and Mrs.
Ripley, candle in hand, conducted them upstairs to the small room
set apart for their use.</p>

<p>This was another novel experience for the visitor. She insisted
at first upon lying on the hard floor, for never in her life had
she touched a bed; but after awhile, she became willing to share
the couch with her playmate.</p>

<p>Alice knelt down by the side of the little trundle bed and said
her prayers, as she always did; but Linna could not understand
what it meant. She wonderingly watched her until she was through,
and then with some misgiving, clambered among the clothes, and
the mother tucked her up, though the night was so warm they needed
little covering.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ripley felt that she ought to tell the dusky child about
her heavenly Father, and to teach her to pray. She therefore sat
down on the edge of the bed, and in simple words began the wonderful
story of the Saviour, who gave His life to save her as well as
all others.</p>

<p>Alice dropped asleep right away, but Linna lay motionless, with
her round black eyes fixed on the face of the lady, drinking in
every word she said. By and by, however, the eyelids began to
droop, and the good woman ceased. Who shall tell what precious
seed was thus sown in that cabin in Wyoming, more than a hundred
years ago?</p>

<p>While Mrs. Ripley was talking upstairs, she heard voices below;
so that she knew Ben had a visitor. As she descended, she recognized
a neighbor who lived on the other side of the river.</p>

<p>"I called," said he, "to tell you that you must lose no time
in moving into Forty Fort with your little girl."</p>

<p>"You do not mean right away?"</p>

<p>"Not tonight, but the first thing in the morning."</p>

<p>"Is the danger so close as that?"</p>

<p>"Our scouts report the Tory Colonel Butler with a large force
of whites and Indians marching down the valley."</p>

<p>"But do you not expect to repel them?"</p>

<p>"We are sure of that," was the confident reply; "but it won't
do for any of the women and children to be exposed. The Indians
will scatter, and cut off all they can. Others of our friends
are out warning the people, and we must have them all in a safe
place."</p>

<p>"Will you wait for your enemies to attack the fort?"</p>

<p>"I believe our Colonel Butler favors that; but others, and among
them myself and Ben, favor marching out and meeting them."</p>

<p>"That's it," added the lad, shaking his head. "I believe in showing
them we are not scared. Colonel Butler got leave of absence to
come to Wyoming; he has some regulars with him, and with all our
men and boys we'll teach the other Colonel Butler a lesson he
won't forget as long as he lives."</p>

<p>"Well, if you think it best, we will move into the fort with
the other people until the danger is past."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother; I will fight better knowing that you and Alice
are safe. There's Linna! What about her?"</p>

<p>"Who's Linna?" asked the visitor.</p>

<p>"She is the little child of Omas, the Delaware warrior. He brought
her here this afternoon to make Alice a visit, and promised to
call tomorrow for her. Will it be safe to wait until he comes?"</p>

<p>The neighbor shook his head.</p>

<p>"You mustn't take any chances. Why don't you turn her loose to
take care of herself? She can do it."</p>

<p>"I couldn't," the mother hastened to say; "Omas left her in our
care, and I must not neglect her. She will go with us."</p>

<p>"I don't think it will be safe for her father to come after her,
when the flurry is over."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"He will be with the Iroquois, even though his tribe doesn't
like them any too well; for the Iroquois are the conquerors of
the Delawares, and drove them off their hunting grounds."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Ripley, with a sigh; "even if he never comes
for her, she will always have a home with us."</p>

<p>The dwelling of the Ripleys was on the eastern shore of the Susquehanna.
On the other side stood Fort Wintermoot and Forty Fort, the former
being at the upper end of the valley. That would be the first
one reached by the invaders, and the expectation was that it would
give up whenever ordered to do so, for nearly all in it were friends
of the Tories.</p>

<p>It was evident that when Omas left his child with her friends,
and spoke of returning the next day, or soon thereafter, he did
not know how near the invasion was. Mrs. Ripley expected that
when he did learn it, he would hasten back for her.</p>

<p>The night, however, passed without his appearance, and the hot
July sun came up over the forests on the eastern bank of the river,
and still he remained away. It looked as if he had decided to
let her take her chances while he joined the invaders in their
work of destruction and woe.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ripley would have been willing to wait longer, but she was
urged not to lose another hour. The frightened settlers were not
allowed to take anything but their actual necessaries with them,
for the cramped quarters in Forty Fort, where a number of cabins
were erected, would be crowded to the utmost to make room for
the hundreds who might clamor for admission. The quarters, indeed,
were so scant that many camped outside, holding themselves ready
to rush within should it become necessary.</p>

<p>Little Linna was filled with wonder when she saw her friends
preparing to move and knew she was going with them. But she helped
in her way as much as she could and asked no questions. There
was no need, in fact, for Alice asked enough for both.</p>

<p>And just here I must relate to you a little history.</p>

<p>On the last days of June, 1778, Colonel John Butler, with about
four hundred soldiers&mdash;partly made up of Tories&mdash;and six or seven
hundred Indians, entered the head of Wyoming Valley. As I have
said, he was a cousin of Colonel Zebulon Butler, who commanded
the patriots and did all he could to check the invaders. Reaching
Fort Wintermoot, the British officer sent in a demand for its
surrender. The submission was made, and the invaders then came
down the valley and ordered the Connecticut people to surrender
Forty Fort and the settlements. Colonel Zebulon Butler had under
him, to quote the historical account, "two hundred and thirty
enrolled men, and seventy old people, boys, civil magistrates,
and other volunteers." They formed six companies, which were mustered
at Forty Fort, where the families of the settlers on the east
side of the river had taken refuge.</p>

<p>Colonel Zebulon Butler, upon receiving the summons, called a
council of war. This was on the 3rd of July. The officers believed
that a little delay would be best, in the hope of the arrival
of reinforcements; but nearly all the men were so clamorous to
march out and give the invaders battle, that it was decided to
do so.</p>

<p>"You are going into great danger," remarked the leader, as he
mounted his horse and placed himself at the head of the patriots,
"but I will go as far as any of you."</p>

<p>At three o'clock in the afternoon the column, numbering about
three hundred, marched from the fort with drums beating and colors
flying. They moved up the valley, with the river on the right
and a marsh on the left, until they arrived at Fort Wintermoot,
which had been set on fire by the enemy to give the impression
they were withdrawing from the neighborhood.</p>

<p>As you may well believe, the movements of the patriots were watched
with deep interest by those left behind. The women and children
clustered along the river bank and strained their eyes in the
direction of Fort Wintermoot, the black smoke from which rolled
down the valley and helped to shut out their view.</p>

<p>There was hardly one among the spectators that had not a loved
relative with the defenders. It might be a tottering grandfather,
a sturdy son, who, though a boy, was inspired with the deepest
fervor, and eager to risk his life for the sake of his mother
or sister, whose hearts almost stopped beating in the painful
suspense which must continue until the battle was decided.</p>

<p>Alice was too young fully to understand the peril in which Ben
was placed. She had kissed him goodbye when he ran to take his
place with the others, and, with a light jest on his lips about
her and Linna, he had snatched a kiss from the little Delaware's
swarthy cheek.</p>

<p>The mother added a few cheering words to the children, and it
was a striking sight when they and a number of others, about their
age or under, began playing with all the merriment of children
who never dream that the world contains such afflictions as sorrow,
woe, and death.</p>

<p>It was easy to follow the course of the patriots for a time after
they were beyond sight, by the sound of their drums and the shrill
whistling of several fifes.</p>

<p>In those days it was much more common than now for people to
drink intoxicating liquors. Just before the patriots started up
the valley, I am sorry to say, a few of the men drank more than
they should. It has been claimed by some that but for this things
would have gone differently on that day, which will live for ever
as one of the saddest in American history.</p>

<p>By and by the anxious people near the fort noticed that the sound
of drums and fifes had ceased, and the reports of firearms were
heard.</p>

<p>They knew from this that the opposing forces were making ready
for the conflict, and the suspense became painful indeed.</p>

<p>Then amid the rattle of musketry sounded the whoops of the Iroquois.
The battle was on. Fighting began about four o'clock in the afternoon.
Colonel Zebulon Butler ordered his men to fire, and at each discharge
to advance a step. The fire was regular and steady, and the Americans
continued to gain ground, having the advantage where it was open.
Despite the exertions of the invaders, their line gave way, and
but for the help of the Indians they would have been routed.</p>

<p>The flanking party of red men kept up a galling fire on the right,
and the patriots dropped fast. The Indians on the Tory left were
divided into six bands who kept up a continuous yelling which
did much to inspirit each other, while the deadly aim told sadly
upon the Americans.</p>

<p>The most powerful body of Indians was in a swamp on the left
of the patriots, and by and by they outflanked them. The Americans
tried to manoeuvre so as to face the new danger, but some of them
mistook the order for one to retreat. Everything was thrown into
confusion.</p>

<p>Colonel Zebulon Butler, seeing how things were going, galloped
up and down between the opposing lines, calling out&mdash;"Don't leave
me, my children. Stand by me and the victory is ours!"</p>

<p>But it was too late. The patriots could not be rallied. They
were far outnumbered, and once thrown into a panic, with the captain
of every company slain, the day was lost.</p>

<p>You cannot picture the distress of the women, children, and feeble
old men waiting at Forty Fort the issue of the battle.</p>

<p>The sorrowful groups on the bank of the river listened to the
sounds of conflict, and read the meaning as they came to their
ears.</p>

<p>The steady, regular firing raised their hopes at first. They
knew their sons and friends were fighting well, despite the shouts
of the Indians borne down the valley on the sultry afternoon.</p>

<p>By and by the firing grew more scattering, and instead of being
so far up the river as at first, it was coming closer.</p>

<p>This could mean but one thing; the patriots were retreating before
the Tories and Indians.</p>

<p>One old man, nearly four score years of age, who pleaded to go
into the battle, but was too feeble, could not restrain his feelings.
He walked back and forth, inspired with new strength and full
of hope, until the scattered firing and its approach left no doubt
of its meaning.</p>

<p>He paused in his nervous, hobbling pace, and said to the white
faced women standing breathlessly near&mdash;"Our boys are retreating:
they have been beaten&mdash;all hope is gone!"</p>

<p>The next moment two horsemen galloped into sight. "Colonel Butler
and Colonel Denison!" said the old man, recognizing them; "they
bring sad news."</p>

<p>It was true. They rode their horses on a dead run, and reining
up at the fort, where the people crowded around them, they leaped
to the ground, and Colonel Butler said&mdash;"Our boys have been driven
from the field, and the Tories and Indians are at their heels!"</p>
