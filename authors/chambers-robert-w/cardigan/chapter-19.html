<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Day after day I lay in my bed, staring at the ceiling till night
blotted it out. Then, stunned and exhausted, I would lie in the
dark, crying in my weakness, whimpering for those I loved who
had left me here alone. There was no strength left in me, body
or mind; and, perhaps for that reason, my suffering was too feeble
to waste what was left of me, for I had not even the strength
of the fretful who do damage themselves with every grimace.</p>

<p>Certain it was that my thinned blood was growing gradually warmer,
and its currents flowed with slightly increasing vigour day by
day. The fever, which had come only partly from my wounds, had
doubtless been long in me, and had fermented my blood as the opportunity
offered when Wraxall nigh drained my every vein with his butcher's
blade.</p>

<p>The emaciation of my body was extreme, my limbs were pithless
reeds, my skull grinned through the tensely stretched skin, and
my eyes were enormous.</p>

<p>Yet, such sturdy fibre have I inherited from my soldier father
that grief itself could not retard the mending of me, and in the
little French mirror I could almost see my sunken muscles harden
and grow slowly fuller. Like a pear in a hot-frame, I was plump
long before my strength could aid me or my shocked senses gather
to take counsel for the future.</p>

<p>The dreadful anguish of my bereavement came only at intervals,
succeeded by an apathy which served as a merciful relief. But
most I thought of Silver Heels, and why she had left me here,
and when she might return. Keen fear lurked near to stab me when,
rousing from blank slumber, my first thought was of her. Then
I would lie and wonder why she had gone, and tell myself I loved
her above all else, or whimper and deem her cruel to leave me.</p>

<p>One late afternoon the doctor came with a dish of China oranges,
which I found relief in sucking, my gums being as yet somewhat
hot and painful. He made a hole in an orange and I sucked it awhile,
watching him meditatively. He wore crape on his arm&mdash;the arm that
Quider had broken, and which now he could not bend as formerly.</p>

<p>"Why does not my Aunt Molly come to see me?" I asked, quietly.</p>

<p>"Dear lad," said the doctor, raising his eyebrows, "did you not
know she had gone to Montreal?"</p>

<p>"How should I know it," I asked, "when you tell me nothing?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you what I am permitted," he answered, gently.</p>

<p>"Then tell me when my cousin Felicity is coming back? Have you
not heard from Sir John Johnson?"</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I have heard," replied the doctor, cautiously.</p>

<p>I waited, my eyes searching his face.</p>

<p>"Sir John returns to-morrow," he said.</p>

<p>A thrill set my blood leaping. I felt the warm colour staining
my pinched face.</p>

<p>"To-morrow!" I repeated.</p>

<p>The doctor regarded me very gravely.</p>

<p>"Miss Warren will remain in Boston," he said.</p>

<p>The light died out before my eyes; presently I closed them.</p>

<p>"How long?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>The orange, scarcely tasted, rolled over the bed and fell on
the floor. I heard him rise to pick it up.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes and looked at the distant pines through the
window.</p>

<p>"Doctor," I muttered, "I am heartsick for a familiar face. Where
are the people who have lived in this house? It is scarce four
months that I have been away, yet all is changed and strange&mdash;new
servants everywhere, no old, friendly faces&mdash;nay, even Peter has
grown so gross and sullen that I scarce knew him. Where is Esk?
Is there not one soul unchanged?"</p>

<p>"Have I changed?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;you are gray! gray!&mdash;and smaller; and you stoop when you
sit."</p>

<p>After a moment he said: "These are times to age all men. Have
you yourself not aged in these five months? You went away a fresh-faced
lad, scarce weaned from your alley-taws and the chalky ring! You
return a man, singed already by the first breath of a fire which
will scorch this land to the bedded rock!"</p>

<p>Presently I asked, "Is war certain?"</p>

<p>He nodded, looking at the floor.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and the Six Nations?" I asked again.</p>

<p>"On our side surely," he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"On our side?" I repeated.</p>

<p>He looked at me suddenly, stern mouth tightly shut. A cold light
touched his gray eyes and seemed to harden every feature.</p>

<p>"When I say 'our side' I assume you to be loyal, Mr. Cardigan,"
he said, curtly.</p>

<p>The change in his shrewd, kindly face amazed me. Was it possible
for old friends to turn so quickly? Was this coming strife to
poison the world with its impending passions?</p>

<p>"If you have become tainted with rebel heresy since you left
us, thank God you have returned in time to purge your mind," he
said, sternly. "Sir William has gone &mdash;Heaven rest his brave
soul!&mdash;but Sir John is alive to take no uncertain stand in the
face of this wicked rebellion which all true loyal hearts must
face."</p>

<p>I looked at him serenely. Who but I should know what Sir William
had thought about the coming strife. Those sacred confidences
of the past had cleared my mind, and made it up long since. Had
I not, in Sir William's service, braved death for the sake of
these same rebels? I understood my mission better now. I had gone
in the cause of humanity&mdash;a cause which was not embraced by the
loyal subjects of our King. I had failed, but failure had brought
wisdom. Never could I set my back against the firm rock of loyalty
to fight for a name that now meant nothing to me. I had quenched
my thirst at bitter waters; I had learned that men could beggar
themselves for principle and die for a tuppenny tax with pockets
full.</p>

<p>"Lad," said the doctor, kindly, "the two rough woodsmen who brought
you home did what their rude skill permitted to save your life.
They washed your wounds and bound them with balsam and linen;
they bore you faithfully for miles and miles through the valley
of death itself. But, lad, they could not have saved you had not
something intervened between you and that keen blade which searched
your life to slay it!"</p>

<p>He rose and took something from the chest of drawers in the corner.
It was a British flag, all torn and hacked and covered with black
stains.</p>

<p>"It was found rolled up beneath your hunting-shirt," he said,
solemnly. "Look on it, lad! For this torn flag, which your father
died defending, held back that deadly knife, shielding the vital
spark beneath its folds. A hair's-breadth more and you had died
at the first stab. The flag was your strength and shield: let
it become your salvation! It was your father's flag: exalt it!"</p>

<p>He spread the flag reverently upon the bed. I touched its folds,
stiff with my own blood. It was the flag of Cresap's fort which
I had taken, seeing it abandoned by all.</p>

<p>"I shall always honour it," I said, half unconsciously.</p>

<p>"And the men who bear it!" he added.</p>

<p>"That is very different," I said, wearily, and turned my head
on the pillow.</p>

<p>When I looked again he was folding the flag and placing it in
the chest of drawers, smiling quietly to himself. Doubtless he
thought me loyal to the King whose armies bore the flag my father
died for. But I was too tired to argue further.</p>

<p>"There is one man I would like to see," I said, "and that is
Mr. Duncan. Will you send to the guard-house and beg him to come
to me, doctor?"</p>

<p>"Ay, that I will, lad," he said, cheerily, picking up his hat
and case of drugs. "And, by-the-way, your regiment of Border Horse
will be here in a month. You will doubtless be content to see
the gallant troopers in whose ranks you will one day serve, please
God."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," I said, closing my eyes.</p>

<p>I must have fallen into a light sleep, for when I unclosed my
eyes I saw Mr. Duncan beside me, looking down into my face. I
smiled and raised one hand, and he took it gently in both of his
strong, sun-browned hands.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well," he muttered, smiling, while the tears stood
in his pleasant eyes; "here is our soldier home again&mdash;that same
soldier whom I last saw in the guard-house, having his poll clipped
by honest Wraxall, Ã  la coureur-de-bois&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>I motioned feebly for him to find a chair beside my bed, and
he sat down, still holding my hand in his.</p>

<p>"Now," I said, "explain to me all that has happened. The doctor
tells me what I ask, but I have had little inclination to hear
much. I like you, Mr. Duncan. Tell me everything."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;about Sir William?" he asked, gently.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but that last of all," I muttered, choking.</p>

<p>After a silence he straightened up, unhooked his sword, and laid
it against the wall. Then, settling comfortably back in his chair,
he clasped his hands over his white gaiters and looked at me.</p>

<p>"You must know," he said, "that Colonel Guy Johnson is now superintendent
of Indian affairs in North America for his Majesty. He has appointed
as deputies Colonel Claus and Colonel John Butler&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Colonel Butler," repeated Mr. Duncan; "you remember him, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember him," I replied; "where is he?"</p>

<p>"He and Joseph Brant are organizing the loyalists and Indians
north of us," said Mr. Duncan, innocently. "This border war in
Virginia has set the Six Nations afire. Many of our Mohawks have
slipped away to join Logan and Sowanowane against this fellow
Cresap who murdered Logan's children; the others are restless
and sullen. There was but one man in the world who could have
controlled them&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>"I know it," said I. "You mean Sir William."</p>

<p>"Ay, Mr. Cardigan, I mean Sir William. Well, well, there is no
help now. It is Sir John Johnson's policy to win over the savages
to our side; but I often think Sir William knew best how to manage
them. It will be dreadful, dreadful! I for one wish no such allies
as are gathering north of us under Joseph Brant and Colonel Butler."</p>

<p>"Why do you not say as much to Sir John?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I? What weight would my opinion carry? I have said often to
those who ask me that I would give all I possess to see the savages
remain neutral in this coming strife."</p>

<p>"Do you also believe it is coming?"</p>

<p>"Surely, surely," he said, lifting his hand solemnly. "Mr. Cardigan,
you have been away, and have also been too ill to know what passes
at our very doors. You are ignorant of the passion which has divided
every town, village, and hamlet in Tryon County&mdash;ay, the passion
which has turned neighbours to bitterest foes&mdash;the passion which
has turned kinship to hatred&mdash;which sets brother against brother,
son against father!</p>

<p>"Our village of Johnstown yonder seethes and simmers with Tory
against Whig, loyalist against rebel. Houses are barricaded; arms
stored, stolen, and smuggled; seditious words uttered, traitorous
songs sung, insults flung in the faces of the King's soldiers.
We of the Royal Americans receive the grossest epithets; curses
and threats are flung in our teeth; sentries on guard are mocked
and reviled; officers jeered at in tavern and street.</p>

<p>"I do not believe such fierceness would betray itself if the
question here were but the old Boston grievance&mdash;the ancient protest
against taxing people without the people's consent. No, it is
not the wrangle between Parliament and colonies that has brought
the devil's own confusion into Tryon County; it is the terrible
possibility that one or the other side may let loose the savages.
We of Tryon County know what that means. Small wonder then, I
say, that the rebels curse us for swine and dogs and devils incarnate
because we are slowly gaining the good-will of the Six Nations."</p>

<p>He wiped his face with a laced hanker and pressed his temples,
frowning.</p>

<p>"Yet," he said, "the rebels, too, would doubtless use the savages
against us if they could win them over. Sir John says so. That
is why he sent Thayendanegea and Colonel Butler to recruit in
the north. They say that Captain Walter Butler is with Cresap.
I don't know; I have not seen him in months."</p>

<p>"I know," said I, quietly.</p>

<p>"Doubtless you met him then at Cresap's camp?"</p>

<p>"Doubtless."</p>

<p>Mr. Duncan waited a moment, then laughed.</p>

<p>"You were ever a man to keep your own counsel," he said.</p>

<p>"What have you heard from Cresap's men?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing save that the war is a fierce one. An express came in
yesterday with news that the Cayugas had been terribly whipped
by the backwoodsmen under Andy Lewis, somewhere near the Great
Kanawha. The express rider got it from some of Cresap's men, but
it may not be true."</p>

<p>After a silence I asked him what month of the year it now was.
I had noticed yellow leaves outside.</p>

<p>"October," he said, pityingly; "did you not know it?"</p>

<p>I tried to realize the space of time which had been wiped out
from my memory.</p>

<p>"When did Sir William&mdash;die?" I muttered, painfully.</p>

<p>Mr. Duncan looked at me with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>"On Monday, the 11th of July."</p>

<p>"Tell me&mdash;all," I motioned, with quivering lips.</p>

<p>"It is history," he said, simply. "I will tell you what I heard
and what I witnessed.</p>

<p>"On the 1st of July we received news of the murder of Bald Eagle,
a friendly Delaware chief. Rumour had it that one of my Lord Dunmore's
agents had slain the old man, but that, of course, is preposterous.
It is hard to sift truth out of rumours. Why, the wildest statements
were openly made in some taverns that young Walter Butler had
murdered the old man. What reason could Walter Butler have to
slay a friendly chief in Pennsylvania?"</p>

<p>"Go on," I said, grimly.</p>

<p>"Well, then, this murder was committed while the poor old man
was sitting in his canoe on one of the streams near Fort Pitt.
After tearing the scalp from the old man the murderer set him
afloat in his canoe. The ghastly progress of the dead was seen
by Indians and whites, and the news, following the report of the
outrage on Logan by that creature Daniel Greathouse, roused the
Six Nations to fury.</p>

<p>"You know that even after the Logan outrage Sir William had held
back the warriors of the Long House; but this fresh crime drove
them frantic. They might still have held off had not Bald Eagle
been scalped, but you know, Mr. Cardigan, that the Six Nations
<em>always</em> regard the scalping of a murdered person as a
<em>national</em> act, not an individual one, and <em>always</em>
accept it as a declaration of war."</p>

<p>"I know," I said.</p>

<p>"The sachems of the Long House," continued Mr. Duncan, "immediately
notified Sir William that they desired to see him without delay.
When you think, Mr. Cardigan, that the murders of Logan's children
and of Bald Eagle touched every clan tie in the Six Nations, nothing
could prove more clearly the marvellous influence of Sir William
over the savages than the fact that their first impulse was not
to seize hatchet and knife and begin an indiscriminate butchery
of our people, but to solicit a conference with Sir William, so
that they might state their wrongs calmly and ask his advice.
Lord! Lord! A great man died in last July; and who can take his
place?"</p>

<p>Again he wiped his brow and clasped his gaitered knees with his
hands.</p>

<p>"In two days," he resumed, "two hundred Onondagas came here,
with intelligence that four hundred more were on their way. Then
they came in hordes &mdash;Mohawks, Senecas, Cayugas, and Oneidas.
From morning till night Sir William was engaged in talking with
them, persuading and promising and exerting himself tirelessly
to hold the gathering tempest in check.</p>

<p>"He was even then far from well; his old trouble had returned;
he could scarcely drag himself up here to this room when night
came. Yet he said to me, after an exhausting conference with the
Oneidas, 'Mr. Duncan, I have daily to combat with thousands of
white men who, by their avarice, cruelty, or indiscretions, are
constantly counteracting all my judicious measures with the Indians.
It is not the Indians I blame. I shall persevere: the occasion
requires it; and I shall never be without hope till I find myself
without that influence which has never yet forsaken me.'</p>

<p>"'That influence is built up on your personal honour,' I said;
'it can never forsake you.'</p>

<p>"He smiled&mdash;you know his rare smile, Mr. Cardigan&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Duncan almost broke down; my eyes were dry and throbbing.</p>

<p>"On the 7th of July," he resumed, "we had a thousand Indians
assembled here at the Hall. The sachems and chiefs were earnestly
pleading for the congress. Sir William was sick abed and suffering
pitifully, but he rose and refused to listen to Doctor Pierson,
saying that the congress should never be delayed by anything but
his own death.</p>

<p>"The weather was frightfully hot; nearly the whole of the first
day was occupied by the speech of Senhowane, a Seneca chief, who
made out a bitter case against the white people of Cresap's command.
A Cayuga war-chief followed the Seneca, speaking until the moon
rose.</p>

<p>"The next day was the Sabbath. Sir William lay abed all day,
unable to see for the frightful pains in his head. Yet the next
day, at half-past nine in the morning, Sir William was at the
fire, belts in hand.</p>

<p>"Never, never, Mr. Cardigan, had any one heard him speak with
such eloquence. Sick unto death as he was, he stood there in the
burning July sun, hour after hour, in the cause of peace. He spoke
with all the fire and vivacity of youth; his words held the savages'
grave and strained attention until the end."</p>

<p>Mr. Duncan paused, staring at space as though to fix that last
scene in his mind forever.</p>

<p>"I was commanding the escort," he said. "My men saluted as the
Indians left the congress. When the last chief had disappeared,
I saw that Sir William was in distress, and ran to him. He lurched
forward into my arms. I held him a moment. He tried to speak,
but all he could say was, 'Tell Michael I am proud&mdash;of&mdash;him,'
and then fell back full weight. We got him to the Hall and laid
him on the library couch. A gillie rode breakneck for Sir John,
who was at the old fort nine miles away. Mistress Molly had gone
to Schenectady; there remained no one of his own kin here."</p>

<p>Mr. Duncan leaned forward, with his face in his hands.</p>

<p>"Sir John came too late," he said; "Sir William died utterly
alone."</p>

<p>As I lay there I could hear the robins chirping outside, just
as I had so often heard them from the school-room. Could this
still be the same summer? Years and years seemed to have slipped
away in these brief months between May and October.</p>

<p>"Where is he buried?" I asked.</p>

<p>"In the vault under the stone church he built in the village.
When you can walk&mdash;we will go."</p>

<p>"I shall walk very soon now," said I.</p>

<p>After a moment I asked who had succeeded Sir William.</p>

<p>"In title and estate Sir John succeeds him," said Mr. Duncan,
"but the King has conferred the intendancy of Indian affairs on
Colonel Guy Johnson."</p>

<p>"Is he as close a friend as ever of Colonel Butler and Joseph?"</p>

<p>"Quite. Joseph Brant is a special deputy, too."</p>

<p>"Then God save our country," I replied, calmly, and closed my
eyes.</p>

<p>Lying there, thinking, I saw for a moment into that red horror
called the future&mdash;which now, thank God, is already the past.</p>

<p>"When Sir John returns from Boston you will hear the will read,"
said Mr. Duncan.</p>

<p>"When does he return?" I asked, opening my eyes.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, we hope."</p>

<p>"Why did he go?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Mr. Duncan, frankly.</p>

<p>"Why did he take Miss Warren?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I do not know," he answered.</p>

<p>"Will she return with him?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say&mdash;but I suppose she will," replied Mr. Duncan, looking
curiously at me.</p>

<p>"The doctor says she will not return with Sir John."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Lord, lad, I don't know!" he exclaimed, amused.</p>

<p>"Did Miss Warren see me while I was ill?"</p>

<p>"Ay, that she did," he cried. "She never left you; they could
not drag her away to eat enough to keep a bird alive. She hung
over you, she followed the doctor, holding to his sleeve and asking
questions till the good man nigh lost his senses. And all the
time Sir John was fuming and impatient to be off to Boston, but
Miss Warren would not go until the doctor was able to promise
on his sacred honour that you were not only out of danger, but
that you would recover completely in mind and body."</p>

<p>"And then?" I muttered.</p>

<p>"Why, then Sir John would no longer be denied, and she must needs
journey with him to Boston. I know that she herself did not understand
why she was going, except that some legal affairs required her
presence."</p>

<p>"And she left no word for me?"</p>

<p>"None with me. I heard her ask Sir John how soon you would be
able to read if she wrote you, but Sir John shook his head without
reply. Then she asked the doctor, and I think he told Miss Warren
she might write in October if she remained in Boston as long as
that. So, doubtless, the express is already galloping up the old
post-road with your letter, Mr. Cardigan."</p>

<p>Presently&mdash;for I was becoming very tired &mdash;I asked about
the two forest-runners who had brought me hither, not mentioning
their names for prudence sake.</p>

<p>"I don't know where they are," said Mr. Duncan, rising to buckle
on his sword. "The little, mild-spoken man disappeared the day
that Sir John and Miss Warren left for Boston. The other, the
big, swaggering fellow, abandoned by his running-mate, seemed
astonished, and hunted about the village for a week, swearing
that there was foul play somewhere, and that his comrade would
never willingly have deserted him. Then our magistrate, Squire
Bullock, was stopped and robbed on the King's highway&mdash;ay, and
roundly cursed for a Tory thief&mdash;by this same graceless giant
in buckskin who brought you here. They sought for him, but you
know how those fellows travel. He may be in Quebec now, for aught
I know&mdash;the impudent rascal."</p>

<p>After a moment I said, "Miss Warren, you say, cared for me while
I lay ill?"</p>

<p>"Like a mother&mdash;or fond sister."</p>

<p>I closed my eyes partly.</p>

<p>He looked down at me and pressed my hand.</p>

<p>"I have tired you," he said, gently.</p>

<p>"No, you have given me life," I answered, smiling.</p>
