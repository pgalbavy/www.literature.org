<p>Both Jack Carleton and Otto Relstaub were disturbed by the singular
behavior of the squaw and chief.</p>

<p>"They're talking about something outdoors," whispered Jack; "keep
quiet and listen."</p>

<p>The faint rustling of the leaves, the gentle breathing of the
sleeping infant, and the soft purring of the fire (caused by the
sudden flaring up of one of the brands), were the only sounds
that came to their ears.  Wish-o-wa-tum held the stem of his pipe
between his lips, without ejecting any smoke, while his eyes were
fixed on the ground in front of his feet, with that absent expression
which showed he was listening intently to something not visible
to the eye.  The attitude of the wife was similar, except that
she looked steadily in the face of Jack Carleton, as though seeking
to read his thoughts.</p>

<p>Hark! both the boys caught a stirring of the leaves, precisely
as if made by the foot of an animal prowling around the wigwam.</p>

<p>"Sh!" warned Jack; "it's a man or beast!"</p>

<p>The words had no more than left his lips, when the flapping deerskin
was silently drawn backward and an Indian warrior entered.</p>

<p>He was powerful and well formed in his war paint, and with his
long rifle in his right hand.  He had no blanket thrown over his
shoulders, but he was fully dressed in other respects, with knife
and tomahawk thrust in the girdle around his waist.</p>

<p>The first glance showed that he not only belonged to the Shawanoe
tribe, but he was one of the most dreaded members of the same. 
Both Otto and Jack had seen him before, his forehead and cheeks
being so curiously marked as to identify him wherever no one else
was similarly ornamented.</p>

<p>When the boys were making their desperate run for the shelter
of the logs on the other side, of the Mississippi, Otto threw
back an affrighted look, which gave him such a vivid picture of
that particular savage that he felt the memory would remain with
him through life.  A few minutes after, as my reader will recall,
Jack deliberately held fast to the upper edge of the rude fort
and looked over upon the fierce warriors outside.  The one who
particularly impressed him was the Shawanoe with the hideously
painted countenance.  It was this same Indian that flung the bear
skin about his shoulders and, creeping up the inclined tree trunk,
surveyed the astonished youths below, and it was he who now entered
the lodge of Wish-o-wa-tum and confronted the inmates.</p>

<p>The truth flashed upon the boys: he was one of a party that had
followed them across the Mississippi, and had traced them to this
lodge.  It was natural the youths should believe that others were
not far off.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Otto had left his gun on the edge
of the clearing some distance away, while the weapon of Jack stood
near the entrance of the lodge.  The instant the Shawanoe stepped
inside, his eye rested on it, and, as if divining the truth, he
extended his hand and picked it up.  The act gave him two guns,
while neither of the boys possessed a fire-arm.</p>

<p>Having performed this clever exploit, the Shawanoe, still standing
erect, just within the lodge, turned to the chief and addressed
him in what may be termed a mixture of the Shawanoe and Osage
tongues. He paid no attention to the squaw at the other end of
the wigwam, for to an American Indian the native woman is of little
account under any circumstances.</p>

<p>Nor did his face indicate that he was aware of the presence of
the boys, who looked at him with dismay; but it was morally certain
that the conversation which opened immediately related almost
solely to them.</p>

<p>"My gracious!" said Jack, when able to recover himself, "this
is bad for us.  I never dreamed of anything of the kind."</p>

<p>He spoke very guardedly, with his head close to his friend's
though both narrowly watched the warriors, while giving expression
to their own fears.</p>

<p>"Vie didn't we start sooner don he comes?" whispered Otto, his
jaw trembling with fear; "I don't see vot we doted does."</p>

<p>An absurd scheme of escape suggested itself to Jack.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether we can't dash through the side of the lodge
and get away."</p>

<p>"Wait till I sees."</p>

<p>Otto carefully leaned back with a view of learning bow much resistance
the deerskins would offer.  While they were quite strong, they
were not taut, and yielded so much that the boy tipped over backwards,
with his feet in the air, somewhat after the style of the baby
when frolicking on the blanket.</p>

<p>The two warriors, including the squaw, looked stolidly at him,
and there was not the trace of a smile on any countenance.  Agitated
as was Jack, he could not repress a slight laugh when he witnessed
the discomfiture of his companion.</p>

<p>"Mine gracious!" muttered Otto, clambering to the sitting position
again; "I dinks dot some one have pulls de lodge away van I don't
leans against him."</p>

<p>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p>"There's no use of trying that; before we could get through they
could catch us both.  If they attack us, we'll have to make the
beat fight we can."</p>

<p>"And dot won't be good for nodding," was the truthful remark
of Otto, who looked toward the two warriors again.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe must have felt he was entire master of the situation.
As if to remove any doubt on that point in the minds of the youths,
he now set down the gun he had picked up, leaned his own against
the side of the lodge, close to it, and then seated himself about
half way between the door and the sleeping baby.  This placed
him opposite Wish-o-wa-tum and closer to the entrance where were
Otto and Jack.  For the latter to pass out, they must rush by
both warriors, a feat utterly impossible, should the Indians object. 
It was equally beyond their power to secure the guns, which would
have proven potent factors in settling the question.</p>

<p>"I believe he has left the rifles there on purpose to tempt us
to make a dash for them," said Jack, half inclined to accept the
challenge, hopeless as it was.</p>

<p>"Dot ish vot they does him for," assented Otto.</p>

<p>Jack was strongly of the belief that other Shawanoes were near. 
It was unreasonable to suppose that a single warrior would have
crossed the Mississippi alone, when a dozen of them had proven
unable to bring the boys to terms.</p>

<p>"They have found we are in here," was the thought of the boy,
"and becoming tired of waiting for us, have sent this one to talk
with the Osage and to hurry us out.  Ah, why did Deerfoot leave
us so soon?  If we ever needed him, now is the time."</p>

<p>The name of the wonderful youth gave a new turn to the thoughts
of the lad.  He asked himself whether it was probable that the
Shawanoes and Miamis had sent a party over to pursue the boys
alone, or to revenge themselves upon Deerfoot.  Their enmity against
the latter must be tenfold greater than it could be against any
one else.</p>

<p>The most natural decision to which the lad could come was that
the hostiles were numerous enough to divide and follow both trails. 
At any rate it was improbable, as has already been said, that
the task of running the youths to earth was entrusted to a single
warrior.</p>

<p>While Wish-o-wa-tum and his latest visitor were talking in their
odd, granting fashion, the boys carefully studied their countenances,
in the vain effort to read the meaning of the words that passed
their lips.  They occasionally glanced at the squaw, who manifested
more interest than was expected.  Sometimes she held the pipe
for a minute or two motionless, her eyes on the warriors, as if
anxious to catch every word.  Then she would give a snuff or grunt,
lean forward and stir the fire and smoke with great vigor.</p>

<p>To the amazement of the listening boys, the red men all at once
changed their language to the English&mdash;or rather they attempted
to do so, for they made sorry work of it.</p>

<p>"Dog Deerfoot&mdash;he dog," was the somewhat obscure remark of the
latest arrival.</p>

<p>"Him so," nodded Man-not-Afraid-of-Thunder, who probably had
never beard of the individual until within the last few minutes.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot dog&mdash;coward&mdash;shoot Injin no more."</p>

<p>Wish-o-wa-tum started a reply in English, but the difficulty
was such that he slid back into his own lingo.  Consequently,
the purport of what he said was lost upon the youths.  Jack Carleton,
however, was quick enough to suspect the meaning, of the proceeding
which troubled him so much at first.  The words in broken English
were intended for the friends of Deerfoot.  It was characteristic
of the Shawanoe visitor that he should attempt to play upon the
feelings of the hapless boys.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot dead," he added, with a sidelong glance toward the
latter, which confirmed the suspicion of the young Kentuckian.</p>

<p>Otto started on hearing the words, but whispered, as he hitched
closer to his friend:</p>

<p>"I don't dinks so."</p>

<p>"Nor do <em>I&mdash;</em>hark!"</p>

<p>"How die?" asked Wish-o-wa-tum again struggling with the tongue
to which he was a subject rather than of which he was master.</p>

<p>"Arorara threw him down," replied the visitor, striking his fist
against his breast to signify the name was his own; "jump on him&mdash;take
scalp.  Deerfoot dog!"</p>

<p>"I know how deceitful the Indians are," said Jack in the same
low tone, "but that fellow don't know bow to lie in English. 
I should like to see the warrior that can throw Deerfoot down
and take his scalp."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe seemed to have overheard the expression, or at least
suspected its meaning, guarded though the words were in their
utterance, for he leaped to his feet and again striking his fist
against his chest, exclaimed in hot anger:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot dog &mdash;Deerfoot dead!  Arorara take scalp."</p>

<p>To the amazement of Jack Carleton, Otto also sprang to his feet,
and struck his chest a resounding thump.</p>

<p>"Arorara ish one pig liar!" he shouted; "he is a liar as never
vos! He says dot Deerfoot is dead, and dere stands Deerfoot now!"</p>

<p>And as the German lad thundered the words, he pointed toward
the deerskin, which had been flung back once more.</p>
