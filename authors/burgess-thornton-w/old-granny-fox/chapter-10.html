A saucy tongue is dangerous to possess;<br/>
Be sure some day 't will get you in a mess.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Old Granny Fox.

</p>
</div>
<p>Reddy Fox is headstrong and, like most headstrong people, is
given to thinking that his way is the best way just because it
is his way. He is smart, is Reddy Fox. Yes, indeed, Reddy Fox
is very, very smart. He has to be in order to live. But a great
deal of what he knows he learned from Old Granny Fox. The very
best tricks he knows she taught him. She began teaching him when
he was so little that he tumbled over his own feet. It was she
who taught him how to hunt, that it is better never to steal chickens
near home but to go a long way off for them, and how to fool Bowser
the Hound.</p>

<p>It was Granny who taught Reddy how to use his little black nose
to follow the tracks of careless young Rabbits, and how to catch
Meadow Mice under the snow. In fact, there is little Reddy knows
which he didn't learn from wise, shrewd Old Granny Fox.</p>

<p>But as he grew bigger and bigger, until he was quite as big as
Granny herself, he forgot what he owed to her. He grew to have
a very good opinion of himself and to feel that he knew just about
all there was to know. So sometimes when he had done foolish or
careless things and Granny had scolded him, telling him he was
big enough and old enough to know better, he would sulk and go
off muttering to himself. But he never quite dared to be openly
disrespectful to Granny, and this, of course, was quite as it
should have been.</p>

<p>"If only I could catch Granny doing something foolish or careless,"
he would say to himself. But he never could, and he had begun
to think that he never would. But now at last Granny, clever Old
Granny Fox, had been careless! She had allowed Farmer Brown's
boy to catch her napping! Reddy did wish he had been there to
see it himself. But anyway, he had been told about it, and he
made up his mind that the next time Granny said anything sharp
to him about his carelessness he would have something to say back.
Yes, Sir, Reddy Fox was deliberately planning to answer back,
which, as you know, is always disrespectful to one's elders.</p>

<p>At last the chance came. Reddy did a thing no truly wise Fox
ever will do. He went two nights in succession to the same henhouse,
and the second time he barely escaped being shot. Old Granny Fox
found out about it. How she found out Reddy doesn't know to this
day, but find out she did, and she gave him such a scolding as
even her sharp tongue had seldom given him.</p>

<p>"You are the stupidest Fox I ever heard of," scolded Granny.</p>

<p>"I'm no more stupid than you are!" retorted Reddy in the most
impudent way.</p>

<p>"What's that?" demanded Granny. "What's that you said?"</p>

<p>"I said I'm no more stupid than you are, and what is more, I
hope I'm not so stupid. I know better than to take a nap in broad
daylight right under the very nose of Farmer Brown's boy." Reddy
grinned in the most impudent way as he said this.</p>

<p>Granny's eyes snapped. Then things happened. Reddy was cuffed
this way and cuffed that way and cuffed the other way until it
seemed to him that the air was full of black paws, every one of
which landed on his head or face with a sting that made him whimper
and put his tail between his legs, and finally howl.</p>

<p>"There!" cried Granny, when at last she had to stop because she
was quite out of breath. "Perhaps that will teach you to be respectful
to your elders. I was careless and stupid, and I am perfectly
ready to admit it, because it has taught me a lesson. Wisdom often
is gained through mistakes, but never when one is not willing
to admit the mistakes. No Fox lives long who makes the same mistake
twice. And those who are impudent to their elders come to no good
end. I've got a fat goose hidden away for dinner, but you will
get none of it."</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I wish I'd never heard of Granny's mistake," whined
Reddy to himself as he crept dinnerless to bed.</p>

<p>"You ought to wish that you hadn't been impudent," whispered
a small voice down inside him.</p>
