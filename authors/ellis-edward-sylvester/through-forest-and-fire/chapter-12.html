<p>Happily there are few little girls in this favored land who are
called upon to go through such trials as fell to the lot of little
Nellie Ribsam when she was but eight years old.</p>

<p>It created much talk in the neighborhood, and she was complimented
on the bravery she had shown, while the glad father became more
confirmed than ever in his favorite belief that God helps them
that help themselves.</p>

<p>"'Spose dot she didn't try to helps herself some," he said, in
talking the matter over with Mr. Marston, "don't you not sees
dot she would get eat up doo, dree times by dot bear dot vos bigger
as nefer vos?"</p>

<p>"It is a good thing for one, even though he be a child, to be
able to do his utmost when overtaken by danger&mdash;there can be no
question about <em>that</em>; but it would require a great deal
of training to bring some children to that point, even when they
are double the years of your little girl."</p>

<p>"Dot's becos dere folks don't not begins right; we starts mit
Nick and Nellie when dey was so small dot dey didn't know nuffin,
which is why it happens dey knows so much now."</p>

<p>Great as was the interest excited by the adventure of Nellie,
it was not long before it was thrown in the shade by another fact
which was brought to light by that same experience: that was the
existence of a large bear in the woods which lay to the east and
west of the road leading to Dunbarton.</p>

<p>This forest, as has already been intimated, covered a large tract
of country, in which, a few years previous, bears, deer, and wolves
had been hunted by many of those dwelling on the outskirts. Large
inroads had been made on the woodland, and here and there the
cabin of a settler or squatter was found by those who penetrated
any distance.</p>

<p>There were clearings extending over several acres, while, again,
a man might wander for hours without emerging from the timber,
which included the common varieties found in the Middle States&mdash;oak,
beech, maple, birch, hickory, hemlock, black walnut, American
poplar or whitewood, gum, elm, persimmon, and others less important.</p>

<p>The pine resembled the famous white pine of the Allegheny mountains,
and predominated. Where there was such a large area covered with
timber, about every variety of surface was known. In some places
were rocks, ravines, hollows, and gulches; in others there were
marshy swamps through which a hunter would find it hard work to
force his way.</p>

<p>Shark Creek entered from the east and was of considerable volume.
In many places it was deep, while elsewhere it widened into broad
and shallow expansions. It wound its way through the woods in
the sinuous course always taken by such streams, and, crossing
the road, where it was spanned by a bridge, it continued onward
a quarter of a mile, when it reached Shark Pond, the overflow
of which ultimately found its way into the Susquehanna and so
to the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Why the waters were called Shark Creek and Pond was more than
any one could explain. Most likely it was because no such fish
as the shark had ever been seen near them, the circumstances of
the case rendering it impossible that such a voracious creature
ever should have sported in their depths.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it will be seen that the woods offered
a most inviting home for a few wild bears, and there was the best
reason for the belief of many of the neighbors that if the tract
was well hunted over several of the animals would be found.</p>

<p>The universal opinion was that they should be exterminated, for
so long as they were in the woods, so long were they a standing
menace to all the men, women, and children who dwelt in the section.
The children, especially, were considered in great peril, and
several timid mothers refused to let their girls and boys go to
school, which stood at no great distance from the woods.</p>

<p>There was more than one farmer who contended that, if the few
bears were left alone they would multiply to that degree that
they would sally forth from the forest, like the Delaware Indians
of the last century, and carry death and destruction before them.</p>

<p>A few individuals, like Gustav Ribsam, said there was nothing
to fear, for when the bears showed any marked increase they would
be killed, and it would be no very difficult job, either.</p>

<p>But no one could dispute the desirability of ridding the country
of the brute which came so near eating little Nellie Ribsam; and,
where there was so much talk, something was done, or at least
attempted.</p>

<p>A hunting party of six men was organized in the month of October,
and they tramped through the woods for days, with a couple of
dogs, but the trail of the animal could not be found. They finally
gave up the hunt, the most tired and disgusted not hesitating
to declare they did not believe a bear had been seen in the forest
for half a century.</p>

<p>The opinion of those best qualified to judge, was that bruin
obtained all the food he wanted with such little trouble that
he did not care to molest any persons, and therefore kept out
of the way of the hunters.</p>

<p>Nick Ribsam, like all boys, was fond of a gun and dog, and he
did not own either. His father had brought from Holland an old
musket, used before the country was erected into a kingdom for
Louis Bonaparte, more than eighty years ago; but when Nick rammed
a charge down its dusty throat one day, forgetful that one had
been resting there for months, and pulled trigger, it hung fire
a long time; but, when it did go off, it did so in an overwhelming
fashion, bursting into a dozen pieces and narrowly missing killing
the astounded lad who discharged it.</p>

<p>But Nick was so anxious to own a gun, that his father bought
him one on the day he reached the age of ten years, which was
shortly after Nellie's adventure with the bear. Although the farmer
was frugal in all things, he believed it was the cheapest to buy
the best, and the gun which was placed in the hands of Nick was
a breech-loader with double barrels. It was a shot-gun, as a matter
of course, for little use could be found for a rifle in that neighborhood.</p>

<p>But Nick had practiced with this piece only a few weeks, when
his ambition was turned in another direction by a large, strong
boy, who hired himself out upon the farm of Mr. Marston. He was
sixteen years of age, and was named Sam Harper. His father had
been a soldier in the late war, and gave to Sam a fine breech-loading
rifle, which he brought with him when he hired out to Mr. Marston.</p>

<p>The lad had owned it two years, and, under the tutelage of his
father, who was wounded and living upon a pension, he became very
skillful for one of his age.</p>

<p>Beside this, Mr. Marston himself, as I have shown, was fond of
hunting in his early manhood, and was the owner of an excellent
muzzle-loading rifle, which was as good as when his keen eye glanced
along the brown barrel and the bullet was buried in the unsuspicious
deer, so far away as to be scarcely visible to the ordinary vision.</p>

<p>"If you and Sam want to hunt the bear," said the kind owner,
"you are welcome to my rifle, for you know a shot-gun ain't exactly
the thing to go hunting bears with."</p>

<p>"That's just what I want it for," said Nick, with sparkling eyes.</p>
