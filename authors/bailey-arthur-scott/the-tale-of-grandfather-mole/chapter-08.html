<p>IT often happened, when Grandfather Mole came up from his home under
Farmer Green's garden, that he turned straight around and went back
again. Sometimes, to be sure, he ran about a bit in a bewildered way,
before he disappeared. For he never felt at home in the world above; and
he was always uneasy until he felt the darkness closing in around him.
</p>
<p>So nobody thought it strange when Grandfather Mole came tumbling up
amongst the turnips one day and began running blindly around the garden,
zig-zagging in every direction. Nobody that saw him paid much attention
to him. But at last Rusty Wren, who had come to the garden to look for
worms, noticed that Grandfather Mole was quite upset over something. He
didn't seem to have any notion of going back into the ground, but kept
twisting this way and that, with his long nose turning here and turning
there, in a manner that was unmistakably inquiring.
</p><p>"What's the matter?" Rusty Wren finally asked him, for his curiosity
soon got the better of him.
</p><p>But Grandfather Mole didn't appear to hear. Perhaps he didn't want to
answer the question.
</p><p>"Have you lost something?" Rusty Wren cried.
</p><p>But Grandfather Mole never stopped to reply. He never stopped running
to and fro. And Rusty Wren became more curious than ever. It was plain,
to him, that something unusual was afoot. And he wanted to know what it
was. "Can't I help you?" he asked in his shrillest tones, flying close
to Grandfather Mole and speaking almost in his ear--only Grandfather
Mole had no ears, so far as Rusty Wren could see. "Can't I help you?"
</p><p>"Yes, you can!" Grandfather Mole answered at last. "If you wish to help
me, for pity's sake go away and keep still! I don't want the whole
neighborhood to come a-running. The cat will be here the first thing we
know."
</p><p>Rusty Wren felt sure, then, that Grandfather Mole was in trouble. And if
he was worried about Farmer Green's cat, why didn't he dig a hole for
himself at once, and get out of harm's way?
</p><p>Since Rusty Wren didn't know, he asked Grandfather Mole--in little more
than a whisper. But Grandfather Mole only shook his head impatiently, as
if to say that digging a hole wouldn't help him this time.
</p><p>Meanwhile some of Rusty Wren's friends had come up to see what was going
on. And talking in low tones, so that they wouldn't attract the cat's
attention, they agreed with him that there was some mystery about
Grandfather Mole. But not one of them knew what it could be.
</p><p>"He's lost something!" Rusty Wren declared.
</p><p>"There's no doubt of that," Jolly Robin chimed in.
</p><p>"What can it be?" little Mr. Chippy piped in his thin voice.
</p><p>"I know!" Rusty Wren exclaimed abruptly. "It's his bearings! Grandfather
Mole has lost his bearings!"
