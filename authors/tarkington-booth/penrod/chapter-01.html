<p>Penrod sat morosely upon the back fence and gazed with envy at
Duke, his wistful dog.</p>

<p>A bitter soul dominated the various curved and angular surfaces
known by a careless world as the face of Penrod Schofield. Except
in solitude, that face was almost always cryptic and emotionless;
for Penrod had come into his twelfth year wearing an expression
carefully trained to be inscrutable. Since the world was sure
to misunderstand everything, mere defensive instinct prompted
him to give it as little as possible to lay hold upon. Nothing
is more impenetrable than the face of a boy who has learned this,
and Penrod's was habitually as fathomless as the depth of his
hatred this morning for the literary activities of Mrs. Lora Rewbush&mdash;an
almost universally respected fellow citizen, a lady of charitable
and poetic inclinations, and one of his own mother's most intimate
friends.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lora Rewbush had written something which she called "The
Children's Pageant of the Table Round," and it was to be performed
in public that very afternoon at the Women's Arts and Guild Hall
for the benefit of the Coloured Infants' Betterment Society. And
if any flavour of sweetness remained in the nature of Penrod Schofield
after the dismal trials of the school-week just past, that problematic,
infinitesimal remnant was made pungent acid by the imminence of
his destiny to form a prominent feature of the spectacle, and
to declaim the loathsome sentiments of a character named upon
the programme the Child Sir Lancelot.</p>

<p>After each rehearsal he had plotted escape, and only ten days
earlier there had been a glimmer of light: Mrs. Lora Rewbush caught
a very bad cold, and it was hoped it might develop into pneumonia;
but she recovered so quickly that not even a rehearsal of the
Children's Pageant was postponed. Darkness closed in. Penrod had
rather vaguely debated plans for a self-mutilation such as would
make his appearance as the Child Sir Lancelot inexpedient on public
grounds; it was a heroic and attractive thought, but the results
of some extremely sketchy preliminary experiments caused him to
abandon it.</p>

<p>There was no escape; and at last his hour was hard upon him.
Therefore he brooded on the fence and gazed with envy at his wistful
Duke.</p>

<p>The dog's name was undescriptive of his person, which was obviously
the result of a singular series of mesalliances. He wore a grizzled
moustache and indefinite whiskers; he was small and shabby, and
looked like an old postman. Penrod envied Duke because he was
sure Duke would never be compelled to be a Child Sir Lancelot.
He thought a dog free and unshackled to go or come as the wind
listeth. Penrod forgot the life he led Duke.</p>

<p>There was a long soliloquy upon the fence, a plaintive monologue
without words: the boy's thoughts were adjectives, but they were
expressed by a running film of pictures in his mind's eye, morbidly
prophetic of the hideosities before him. Finally he spoke aloud,
with such spleen that Duke rose from his haunches and lifted one
ear in keen anxiety.</p>

"'I hight Sir Lancelot du Lake, the Child,<br/>
Gentul-hearted, meek, and mild.<br/>
What though I'm <em>BUT </em>a littul child,<br/>
Gentul-hearted, meek, and&#11834;'  <em>OOF</em>!"

</p>
</div>
<p>All of this except "oof" was a quotation from the Child Sir Lancelot,
as conceived by Mrs. Lora Rewbush. Choking upon it, Penrod slid
down from the fence, and with slow and thoughtful steps entered
a one-storied wing of the stable, consisting of a single apartment,
floored with cement and used as a storeroom for broken bric-a-brac,
old paint-buckets, decayed garden-hose, worn-out carpets, dead
furniture, and other condemned odds and ends not yet considered
hopeless enough to be given away.</p>

<p>In one corner stood a large box, a part of the building itself:
it was eight feet high and open at the top, and it had been constructed
as a sawdust magazine from which was drawn material for the horse's
bed in a stall on the other side of the partition. The big box,
so high and towerlike, so commodious, so suggestive, had ceased
to fulfil its legitimate function; though, providentially, it
had been at least half full of sawdust when the horse died. Two
years had gone by since that passing; an interregnum in transportation
during which Penrod's father was "thinking" (he explained sometimes)
of an automobile. Meanwhile, the gifted and generous sawdust-box
had served brilliantly in war and peace: it was Penrod's stronghold.</p>

<p>There was a partially defaced sign upon the front wall of the
box; the donjon-keep had known mercantile impulses:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
The O. K. RaBiT Co.<br/>
<em>PENROD </em>ScHoFi<em>ELD AND CO.<br/>
</em>iNQuiRE <em>FOR </em>PRicEs

</p>
</div>
<p>This was a venture of the preceding vacation, and had netted,
at one time, an accrued and owed profit of $1.38. Prospects had
been brightest on the very eve of cataclysm. The storeroom was
locked and guarded, but twenty-seven rabbits and Belgian hares,
old and young, had perished here on a single night&mdash;through no
human agency, but in a foray of cats, the besiegers treacherously
tunnelling up through the sawdust from the small aperture which
opened into the stall beyond the partition. Commerce has its martyrs.</p>

<p>Penrod climbed upon a barrel, stood on tiptoe, grasped the rim
of the box; then, using a knot-hole as a stirrup, threw one leg
over the top, drew himself up, and dropped within. Standing upon
the packed sawdust, he was just tall enough to see over the top.</p>

<p>Duke had not followed him into the storeroom, but remained near
the open doorway in a concave and pessimistic attitude. Penrod
felt in a dark corner of the box and laid hands upon a simple
apparatus consisting of an old bushel-basket with a few yards
of clothes-line tied to each of its handles. He passed the ends
of the lines over a big spool, which revolved upon an axle of
wire suspended from a beam overhead, and, with the aid of this
improvised pulley, lowered the empty basket until it came to rest
in an upright position upon the floor of the storeroom at the
foot of the sawdust-box.</p>

<p>"Eleva-ter!" shouted Penrod. "Ting-ting!"</p>

<p>Duke, old and intelligently apprehensive, approached slowly,
in a semicircular manner, deprecatingly, but with courtesy. He
pawed the basket delicately; then, as if that were all his master
had expected of him, uttered one bright bark, sat down, and looked
up triumphantly. His hypocrisy was shallow: many a horrible quarter
of an hour had taught him his duty in this matter.</p>

<p>"El-e-<em>VAY-</em>ter!" shouted Penrod sternly. "You want me
to come down there to you?"</p>

<p>Duke looked suddenly haggard. He pawed the basket feebly again
and, upon another outburst from on high, prostrated himself flat.
Again threatened, he gave a superb impersonation of a worm.</p>

<p>"You get in that el-e-<em>VAY-</em>ter!"</p>

<p>Reckless with despair, Duke jumped into the basket, landing in
a dishevelled posture, which he did not alter until he had been
drawn up and poured out upon the floor of sawdust with the box.
There, shuddering, he lay in doughnut shape and presently slumbered.</p>

<p>It was dark in the box, a condition that might have been remedied
by sliding back a small wooden panel on runners, which would have
let in ample light from the alley; but Penrod Schofield had more
interesting means of illumination. He knelt, and from a former
soap-box, in a corner, took a lantern, without a chimney, and
a large oil-can, the leak in the latter being so nearly imperceptible
that its banishment from household use had seemed to Penrod as
inexplicable as it was providential.</p>

<p>He shook the lantern near his ear: nothing splashed; there was
no sound but a dry clinking. But there was plenty of kerosene
in the can; and he filled the lantern, striking a match to illumine
the operation. Then he lit the lantern and hung it upon a nail
against the wall. The sawdust floor was slightly impregnated with
oil, and the open flame quivered in suggestive proximity to the
side of the box; however, some rather deep charrings of the plank
against which the lantern hung offered evidence that the arrangement
was by no means a new one, and indicated at least a possibility
of no fatality occurring this time.</p>

<p>Next, Penrod turned up the surface of the sawdust in another
corner of the floor, and drew forth a cigar-box in which were
half a dozen cigarettes, made of hayseed and thick brown wrapping
paper, a lead-pencil, an eraser, and a small note-book, the cover
of which was labelled in his own handwriting:</p>

<p>"English Grammar. Penrod Schofield. Room 6, Ward School Nomber
Seventh."</p>

<p>The first page of this book was purely academic; but the study
of English undefiled terminated with a slight jar at the top of
the second: "Nor must an adverb be used to modif&#11834;"</p>

<p>Immediately followed:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>And the subsequent entries in the book appeared to have little
concern with Room 6, Ward School Nomber Seventh.</p>
