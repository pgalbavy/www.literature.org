<p> As soon as he had come up quite close he said, mouthing in a
growl&mdash;</p>

<p>"What’s this I hear, Whalley? Is it true you’re selling the Fair
Maid?"</p>

<p>Captain Whalley, looking away, said the thing was done&mdash;money
had been paid that morning; and the other expressed at once his
approbation of such an extremely sensible proceeding. He had got
out of his trap to stretch his legs, he explained, on his way
home to dinner. Sir Frederick looked well at the end of his time.
Didn’t he?</p>

<p>Captain Whalley could not say; had only noticed the carriage
going past.</p>

<p>The Master-Attendant, plunging his hands into the pockets of
an alpaca jacket inappropriately short and tight for a man of
his age and appearance, strutted with a slight limp, and with
his head reaching only to the shoulder of Captain Whalley, who
walked easily, staring straight before him. They had been good
comrades years ago, almost intimates. At the time when Whalley
commanded the renowned Condor, Eliott had charge of the nearly
as famous Ringdove for the same owners; and when the appointment
of Master-Attendant was created, Whalley would have been the only
other serious candidate. But Captain Whalley, then in the prime
of life, was resolved to serve no one but his own auspicious Fortune.
Far away, tending his hot irons, he was glad to hear the other
had been successful. There was a worldly suppleness in bluff Ned
Eliott that would serve him well in that sort of official appointment.
And they were so dissimilar at bottom that as they came slowly
to the end of the avenue before the Cathedral, it had never come
into Whalley’s head that he might have been in that man’s place&mdash;provided
for to the end of his days.</p>

<p>The sacred edifice, standing in solemn isolation amongst the
converging avenues of enormous trees, as if to put grave thoughts
of heaven into the hours of ease, presented a closed Gothic portal
to the light and glory of the west. The glass of the rosace above
the ogive glowed like fiery coal in the deep carvings of a wheel
of stone. The two men faced about.</p>

<p>"I’ll tell you what they ought to do next, Whalley," growled
Captain Eliott suddenly.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"They ought to send a real live lord out here when Sir Frederick’s
time is up. Eh?"</p>

<p>Captain Whalley perfunctorily did not see why a lord of the right
sort should not do as well as anyone else. But this was not the
other’s point of view.</p>

<p>"No, no. Place runs itself. Nothing can stop it now. Good enough
for a lord," he growled in short sentences. "Look at the changes
in our time. We need a lord here now. They have got a lord in
Bombay."</p>

<p>He dined once or twice every year at the Government House&mdash;a
many-windowed, arcaded palace upon a hill laid out in roads and
gardens. And lately he had been taking about a duke in his Master-Attendant’s
steam-launch to visit the harbor improvements. Before that he
had "most obligingly" gone out in person to pick out a good berth
for the ducal yacht. Afterwards he had an invitation to lunch
on board. The duchess herself lunched with them. A big woman with
a red face. Complexion quite sunburnt. He should think ruined.
Very gracious manners. They were going on to Japan. . . .</p>

<p>He ejaculated these details for Captain Whalley’s edification,
pausing to blow out his cheeks as if with a pent-up sense of importance,
and repeatedly protruding his thick lips till the blunt crimson
end of his nose seemed to dip into the milk of his mustache. The
place ran itself; it was fit for any lord; it gave no trouble
except in its Marine department&mdash;in its Marine department he repeated
twice, and after a heavy snort began to relate how the other day
her Majesty’s Consul-General in French Cochin-China had cabled
to him&mdash;in his official capacity&mdash;asking for a qualified man to
be sent over to take charge of a Glasgow ship whose master had
died in Saigon.</p>

<p>"I sent word of it to the officers’ quarters in the Sailors’
Home," he continued, while the limp in his gait seemed to grow
more accentuated with the increasing irritation of his voice.
"Place’s full of them. Twice as many men as there are berths going
in the local trade. All hungry for an easy job. Twice as many&mdash;and
&mdash;What d’you think, Whalley? . . ."</p>

<p>He stopped short; his hands clenched and thrust deeply downwards,
seemed ready to burst the pockets of his jacket. A slight sigh
escaped Captain Whalley.</p>

<p>"Hey? You would think they would be falling over each other.
Not a bit of it. Frightened to go home. Nice and warm out here
to lie about a veranda waiting for a job. I sit and wait in my
office. Nobody. What did they suppose? That I was going to sit
there like a dummy with the Consul-General’s cable before me?
Not likely. So I looked up a list of them I keep by me and sent
word for Hamilton&mdash;the worst loafer of them all&mdash;and just made
him go. Threatened to instruct the steward of the Sailors’ Home
to have him turned out neck and crop. He did not think the berth
was good enough&mdash;if&mdash;you&mdash;please. ‘I’ve your little records by
me,’ said I. ‘You came ashore here eighteen months ago, and you
haven’t done six months’ work since. You are in debt for your
board now at the Home, and I suppose you reckon the Marine Office
will pay in the end. Eh? So it shall; but if you don’t take this
chance, away you go to England, assisted passage, by the first
homeward steamer that comes along. You are no better than a pauper.
We don’t want any white paupers here.’ I scared him. But look
at the trouble all this gave me."</p>

<p>"You would not have had any trouble," Captain Whalley said almost
involuntarily, "if you had sent for me."</p>

<p>Captain Eliott was immensely amused; he shook with laughter as
he walked. But suddenly he stopped laughing. A vague recollection
had crossed his mind. Hadn’t he heard it said at the time of the
Travancore and Deccan smash that poor Whalley had been cleaned
out completely. "Fellow’s hard up, by heavens!" he thought; and
at once he cast a sidelong upward glance at his companion. But
Captain Whalley was smiling austerely straight before him, with
a carriage of the head inconceivable in a penniless man&mdash;and he
became reassured. Impossible. Could not have lost everything.
That ship had been only a hobby of his. And the reflection that
a man who had confessed to receiving that very morning a presumably
large sum of money was not likely to spring upon him a demand
for a small loan put him entirely at his ease again. There had
come a long pause in their talk, however, and not knowing how
to begin again, he growled out soberly, "We old fellows ought
to take a rest now."</p>

<p>"The best thing for some of us would be to die at the oar," Captain
Whalley said negligently.</p>

<p>"Come, now. Aren’t you a bit tired by this time of the whole
show?"  muttered the other sullenly.</p>

<p>"Are you?"</p>

<p>Captain Eliott was. Infernally tired. He only hung on to his
berth so long in order to get his pension on the highest scale
before he went home. It would be no better than poverty, anyhow;
still, it was the only thing between him and the workhouse. And
he had a family. Three girls, as Whalley knew. He gave "Harry,
old boy," to understand that these three girls were a source of
the greatest anxiety and worry to him. Enough to drive a man distracted.</p>

<p>"Why? What have they been doing now?" asked Captain Whalley with
a sort of amused absent-mindedness.</p>

<p>"Doing! Doing nothing. That’s just it. Lawn-tennis and silly
novels from morning to night. . . ."</p>

<p>If one of them at least had been a boy. But all three! And, as
ill-luck would have it, there did not seem to be any decent young
fellows left in the world. When he looked around in the club he
saw only a lot of conceited popinjays too selfish to think of
making a good woman happy. Extreme indigence stared him in the
face with all that crowd to keep at home. He had cherished the
idea of building himself a little house in the country&mdash;in Surrey&mdash;to
end his days in, but he was afraid it was out of the question,
. . . and his staring eyes rolled upwards with such a pathetic
anxiety that Captain Whalley charitably nodded down at him, restraining
a sort of sickening desire to laugh.</p>

<p>"You must know what it is yourself, Harry. Girls are the very
devil for worry and anxiety."</p>

<p>"Ay! But mine is doing well," Captain Whalley pronounced slowly,
staring to the end of the avenue.</p>

<p>The Master-Attendant was glad to hear this. Uncommonly glad.
He remembered her well. A pretty girl she was.</p>

<p>Captain Whalley, stepping out carelessly, assented as if in a
dream.</p>

<p>"She was pretty."</p>

<p>The procession of carriages was breaking up.</p>

<p>One after another they left the file to go off at a trot, animating
the vast avenue with their scattered life and movement; but soon
the aspect of dignified solitude returned and took possession
of the straight wide road. A syce in white stood at the head of
a Burmah pony harnessed to a varnished two-wheel cart; and the
whole thing waiting by the curb seemed no bigger than a child’s
toy forgotten under the soaring trees. Captain Eliott waddled
up to it and made as if to clamber in, but refrained; and keeping
one hand resting easily on the shaft, he changed the conversation
from his pension, his daughters, and his poverty back again to
the only other topic in the world&mdash;the Marine Office, the men
and the ships of the port.</p>

<p>He proceeded to give instances of what was expected of him; and
his thick voice drowsed in the still air like the obstinate droning
of an enormous bumble-bee. Captain Whalley did not know what was
the force or the weakness that prevented him from saying good-night
and walking away. It was as though he had been too tired to make
the effort. How queer. More queer than any of Ned’s instances.
Or was it that overpowering sense of idleness alone that made
him stand there and listen to these stories. Nothing very real
had ever troubled Ned Eliott; and gradually he seemed to detect
deep in, as if wrapped up in the gross wheezy rumble, something
of the clear hearty voice of the young captain of the Ringdove.
He wondered if he too had changed to the same extent; and it seemed
to him that the voice of his old chum had not changed so very
much&mdash;that the man was the same. Not a bad fellow the pleasant,
jolly Ned Eliott, friendly, well up to his business&mdash;and always
a bit of a humbug. He remembered how he used to amuse his poor
wife. She could read him like an open book. When the Condor and
the Ringdove happened to be in port together, she would frequently
ask him to bring Captain Eliott to dinner. They had not met often
since those old days. Not once in five years, perhaps. He regarded
from under his white eyebrows this man he could not bring himself
to take into his confidence at this juncture; and the other went
on with his intimate outpourings, and as remote from his hearer
as though he had been talking on a hill-top a mile away.</p>

<p>He was in a bit of a quandary now as to the steamer Sofala. Ultimately
every hitch in the port came into his hands to undo. They would
miss him when he was gone in another eighteen months, and most
likely some retired naval officer had been pitchforked into the
appointment&mdash;a man that would understand nothing and care less.
That steamer was a coasting craft having a steady trade connection
as far north as Tenasserim; but the trouble was she could get
no captain to take her on her regular trip. Nobody would go in
her. He really had no power, of course, to order a man to take
a job. It was all very well to stretch a point on the demand of
a consul-general, but . . .</p>

<p>"What’s the matter with the ship?" Captain Whalley interrupted
in measured tones.</p>

<p>"Nothing’s the matter. Sound old steamer. Her owner has been
in my office this afternoon tearing his hair."</p>

<p>"Is he a white man?" asked Whalley in an interested voice.</p>

<p>"He calls himself a white man," answered the Master-Attendant
scornfully; "but if so, it’s just skin-deep and no more. I told
him that to his face too."</p>

<p>"But who is he, then?"</p>

<p>"He’s the chief engineer of her. See <em>that</em>, Harry?"</p>

<p>"I see," Captain Whalley said thoughtfully. "The engineer. I
see."</p>

<p>How the fellow came to be a shipowner at the same time was quite
a tale. He came out third in a home ship nearly fifteen years
ago, Captain Eliott remembered, and got paid off after a bad sort
of row both with his skipper and his chief. Anyway, they seemed
jolly glad to get rid of him at all costs. Clearly a mutinous
sort of chap. Well, he remained out here, a perfect nuisance,
everlastingly shipped and unshipped, unable to keep a berth very
long; pretty nigh went through every engine-room afloat belonging
to the colony. Then suddenly, "What do you think happened, Harry?"</p>

<p>Captain Whalley, who seemed lost in a mental effort as of doing
a sum in his head, gave a slight start. He really couldn’t imagine.
The Master-Attendant’s voice vibrated dully with hoarse emphasis.
The man actually had the luck to win the second prize in the Manilla
lottery. All these engineers and officers of ships took tickets
in that gamble. It seemed to be a perfect mania with them all.</p>

<p>Everybody expected now that he would take himself off home with
his money, and go to the devil in his own way. Not at all. The
Sofala, judged too small and not quite modern enough for the sort
of trade she was in, could be got for a moderate price from her
owners, who had ordered a new steamer from Europe. He rushed in
and bought her. This man had never given any signs of that sort
of mental intoxication the mere fact of getting hold of a large
sum of money may produce&mdash;not till he got a ship of his own; but
then he went off his balance all at once: came bouncing into the
Marine Office on some transfer business, with his hat hanging
over his left eye and switching a little cane in his hand, and
told each one of the clerks separately that "Nobody could put
him out now. It was his turn. There was no one over him on earth,
and there never would be either." He swaggered and strutted between
the desks, talking at the top of his voice, and trembling like
a leaf all the while, so that the current business of the office
was suspended for the time he was in there, and everybody in the
big room stood open-mouthed looking at his antics. Afterwards
he could be seen during the hottest hours of the day with his
face as red as fire rushing along up and down the quays to look
at his ship from different points of view: he seemed inclined
to stop every stranger he came across just to let them know "that
there would be no longer anyone over him; he had bought a ship;
nobody on earth could put him out of his engine-room now."</p>

<p>Good bargain as she was, the price of the Sofala took up pretty
near all the lottery-money. He had left himself no capital to
work with. That did not matter so much, for these were the halcyon
days of steam coasting trade, before some of the home shipping
firms had thought of establishing local fleets to feed their main
lines. These, when once organized, took the biggest slices out
of that cake, of course; and by-and-by a squad of confounded German
tramps turned up east of Suez Canal and swept up all the crumbs.
They prowled on the cheap to and fro along the coast and between
the islands, like a lot of sharks in the water ready to snap up
anything you let drop. And then the high old times were over for
good; for years the Sofala had made no more, he judged, than a
fair living. Captain Eliott looked upon it as his duty in every
way to assist an English ship to hold her own; and it stood to
reason that if for want of a captain the Sofala began to miss
her trips she would very soon lose her trade. There was the quandary.
The man was too impracticable. "Too much of a beggar on horseback
from the first,"  he explained. "Seemed to grow worse as the time
went on. In the last three years he’s run through eleven skippers;
he had tried every single man here, outside of the regular lines.
I had warned him before that this would not do. And now, of course,
no one will look at the Sofala. I had one or two men up at my
office and talked to them; but, as they said to me, what was the
good of taking the berth to lead a regular dog’s life for a month
and then get the sack at the end of the first trip? The fellow,
of course, told me it was all nonsense; there has been a plot
hatching for years against him. And now it had come. All the horrid
sailors in the port had conspired to bring him to his knees, because
he was an engineer."</p>

<p>Captain Eliott emitted a throaty chuckle.</p>

<p>"And the fact is, that if he misses a couple more trips he need
never trouble himself to start again. He won’t find any cargo
in his old trade. There’s too much competition nowadays for people
to keep their stuff lying about for a ship that does not turn
up when she’s expected. It’s a bad lookout for him. He swears
he will shut himself on board and starve to death in his cabin
rather than sell her&mdash;even if he could find a buyer. And that’s
not likely in the least. Not even the Japs would give her insured
value for her. It isn’t like selling sailing-ships. Steamers <em>do</em>
get out of date, besides getting old."</p>

<p>"He must have laid by a good bit of money though," observed Captain
Whalley quietly.</p>

<p>The Harbor-master puffed out his purple cheeks to an amazing
size.</p>

<p>"Not a stiver, Harry. Not&mdash;a&mdash;single&mdash;sti-ver."</p>

<p>He waited; but as Captain Whalley, stroking his beard slowly,
looked down on the ground without a word, he tapped him on the
forearm, tiptoed, and said in a hoarse whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Manilla lottery has been eating him up."</p>

<p>He frowned a little, nodding in tiny affirmative jerks. They
all were going in for it; a third of the wages paid to ships’
officers ("in my port," he snorted) went to Manilla. It was a
mania. That fellow Massy had been bitten by it like the rest of
them from the first; but after winning once he seemed to have
persuaded himself he had only to try again to get another big
prize. He had taken dozens and scores of tickets for every drawing
since. What with this vice and his ignorance of affairs, ever
since he had improvidently bought that steamer he had been more
or less short of money.</p>

<p>This, in Captain Eliott’s opinion, gave an opening for a sensible
sailor-man with a few pounds to step in and save that fool from
the consequences of his folly. It was his craze to quarrel with
his captains. He had had some really good men too, who would have
been too glad to stay if he would only let them. But no. He seemed
to think he was no owner unless he was kicking somebody out in
the morning and having a row with the new man in the evening.
What was wanted for him was a master with a couple of hundred
or so to take an interest in the ship on proper conditions. You
don’t discharge a man for no fault, only because of the fun of
telling him to pack up his traps and go ashore, when you know
that in that case you are bound to buy back his share. On the
other hand, a fellow with an interest in the ship is not likely
to throw up his job in a huff about a trifle. He had told Massy
that. He had said: "‘This won’t do, Mr. Massy. We are getting
very sick of you here in the Marine Office. What you must do now
is to try whether you could get a sailor to join you as partner.
That seems to be the only way.’ And that was sound advice, Harry."</p>

<p>Captain Whalley, leaning on his stick, was perfectly still all
over, and his hand, arrested in the act of stroking, grasped his
whole beard. And what did the fellow say to that?</p>

<p>The fellow had the audacity to fly out at the Master-Attendant.
He had received the advice in a most impudent manner. "I didn’t
come here to be laughed at," he had shrieked. "I appeal to you
as an Englishman and a shipowner brought to the verge of ruin
by an illegal conspiracy of your beggarly sailors, and all you
condescend to do for me is to tell me to go and get a partner!"
. . . The fellow had presumed to stamp with rage on the floor
of the private office. Where was he going to get a partner? Was
he being taken for a fool? Not a single one of that contemptible
lot ashore at the "Home" had twopence in his pocket to bless himself
with. The very native curs in the bazaar knew that much. . . .
"And it’s true enough, Harry," rumbled Captain Eliott judicially.
"They are much more likely one and all to owe money to the Chinamen
in Denham Road for the clothes on their backs. ‘Well,’ said I,
‘you make too much noise over it for my taste, Mr. Massy. Good
morning.’ He banged the door after him; he dared to bang my door,
confound his cheek!"</p>

<p>The head of the Marine department was out of breath with indignation;
then recollecting himself as it were, "I’ll end by being late
to dinner&mdash;yarning with you here . . . wife doesn’t like it."</p>

<p>He clambered ponderously into the trap; leaned out sideways,
and only then wondered wheezily what on earth Captain Whalley
could have been doing with himself of late. They had had no sight
of each other for years and years till the other day when he had
seen him unexpectedly in the office.</p>

<p>What on earth . . .</p>

<p>Captain Whalley seemed to be smiling to himself in his white
beard.</p>

<p>"The earth is big," he said vaguely.</p>

<p>The other, as if to test the statement, stared all round from
his driving-seat. The Esplanade was very quiet; only from afar,
from very far, a long way from the seashore, across the stretches
of grass, through the long ranges of trees, came faintly the toot&mdash;toot&mdash;toot
of the cable car beginning to roll before the empty peristyle
of the Public Library on its three-mile journey to the New Harbor
Docks.</p>

<p>"Doesn’t seem to be so much room on it," growled the Master-Attendant,
"since these Germans came along shouldering us at every turn.
It was not so in our time."</p>

<p>He fell into deep thought, breathing stertorously, as though
he had been taking a nap open-eyed. Perhaps he too, on his side,
had detected in the silent pilgrim-like figure, standing there
by the wheel, like an arrested wayfarer, the buried lineaments
of the features belonging to the young captain of the Condor.
Good fellow &mdash;Harry Whalley&mdash;never very talkative. You never
knew what he was up to&mdash;a bit too off-hand with people of consequence,
and apt to take a wrong view of a fellow’s actions. Fact was he
had a too good opinion of himself. He would have liked to tell
him to get in and drive him home to dinner. But one never knew.
Wife would not like it.</p>

<p>"And it’s funny to think, Harry," he went on in a big, subdued
drone, "that of all the people on it there seems only you and
I left to remember this part of the world as it used to be . .
."</p>

<p>He was ready to indulge in the sweetness of a sentimental mood
had it not struck him suddenly that Captain Whalley, unstirring
and without a word, seemed to be awaiting something&mdash;perhaps expecting
. . . He gathered the reins at once and burst out in bluff, hearty
growls&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ha! My dear boy. The men we have known&mdash;the ships we’ve sailed&mdash;ay!
and the things we’ve done . . ."</p>

<p>The pony plunged&mdash;the syce skipped out of the way. Captain Whalley
raised his arm.</p>

<p>"Good-by."</p>
