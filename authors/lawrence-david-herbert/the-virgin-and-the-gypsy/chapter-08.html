<p>The rector heard about Yvette's intimacy with the Eastwoods, and
she was somewhat startled by the result.  She had thought he
wouldn't care.  Verbally, in his would-be humorous fashion, he was
so entirely unconventional, such a frightfully good sport.  As he
said himself, he was a conservative anarchist, which meant, he was
like a great many more people, a mere unbeliever.  The anarchy
extended to his humorous talk, and his secret thinking.  The
conservatism based on a mongrel fear of the anarchy, controlled
every action.  His thoughts, secretly, were something to be scared
of.  Therefore, in his life, he was fanatically afraid of the
unconventional.</p>

<p>When his conservatism and his abject sort of fear were uppermost,
he always lifted his lip and bared his teeth a little, in a dog-
like sneer.</p>

<p>&quot;I hear your latest friends are the half-divorced Mrs. Fawcett and
the maquereau Eastwood,&quot; he said to Yvette.</p>

<p>She didn't know what a maquereau was, but she felt the poison in
the rector's fangs.</p>

<p>&quot;I just know them,&quot; she said.  &quot;They're awfully nice, really.  And
they'll be married in about a month's time.&quot;</p>

<p>The rector looked at her insouciant face with hatred.  Somewhere
inside him, he was cowed, he had been born cowed.  And those who
are born cowed are natural slaves, and deep instinct makes them
fear with prisonous fear those who might suddenly snap the slave's
collar round their necks.</p>

<p>It was for this reason the rector had so abjectly curled up, who
still so abject curled up before She-who-was-Cynthia: because of
his slave's fear of her contempt, the contempt of a born-free
nature for a base-born nature.</p>

<p>Yvette too had a free-born quality.  She too, one day, would know
him, and clap the slave's collar of her contempt round his neck.</p>

<p>But should she?  He would fight to the death, this time, first.
The slave in him was cornered this time, like a cornered rat, and
with the courage of a cornered rat.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose they're your sort!&quot; he sneered.</p>

<p>&quot;Well they are, really,&quot; she said, with that blithe vagueness.  &quot;I
do like them awfully.  They seem so solid, you know, so honest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You've got a peculiar notion of honesty!&quot; he sneered.  &quot;A young
sponge going off with a woman older than himself, so that he can
live on her money!  The woman leaving her home and her children!
I don't know where you get your idea of honesty.  Not from me,
I hope. - And you seem to be very well acquainted with them,
considering you say you just know them.  Where did you meet them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When I was out bicycling.  They came along in their car, and we
happened to talk.  She told me at once who she was, so that I
shouldn't make a mistake.  She is honest.&quot;</p>

<p>Poor Yvette was struggling to bear up.</p>

<p>&quot;And how often have you seen them since?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I've just been over twice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Over where?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To their cottage in Scoresby.&quot;</p>

<p>He looked at her in hate, as if he could kill her.  And he backed
away from her, against the window-curtains of his study, like a rat
at bay.  Somewhere in his mind he was thinking unspeakable
depravities about his daughter, as he had thought them of She-who-
was-Cynthia.  He was powerless against the lowest insinuations of
his own mind.  And these depravities which he attributed to the
still-uncowed, but frightened girl in front of him, made him
recoil, showing all his fangs in his handsome face.</p>

<p>&quot;So you just know them, do you?&quot; he said.  &quot;Lying is in your blood,
I see.  I don't believe you get it from me.&quot;</p>

<p>Yvette half averted her mute face, and thought of Granny's
barefaced prevarication.  She did not answer.</p>

<p>&quot;What takes you creeping round such couples?&quot; he sneered.  &quot;Aren't
there enough decent people in the world, for you to know?  Anyone
would think you were a stray dog, having to run round indecent
couples, because the decent ones wouldn't have you.  Have you got
something worse than lying, in your blood?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What have I got, worse than lying in my blood?&quot; she asked.  A cold
deadness was coming over her.  Was she abnormal, one of the
semicriminal abnormals?  It made her feel cold and dead.</p>

<p>In his eyes, she was just brazening out the depravity that underlay
her virgin, tender, bird-like face.  She-who-was-Cynthia had been
like this: a snowflower.  And he had convulsions of sadistic
horror, thinking what might be the ACTUAL depravity of She-who-was-
Cynthia.  Even his OWN love for her, which had been the lust love
of the born cowed, had been a depravity, in secret, to him.  So
what must an illegal love be?</p>

<p>&quot;You know best yourself, what you have got,&quot; he sneered.  &quot;But it
is something you had best curb, and quickly, if you don't intend to
finish in a criminal-lunacy asylum.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; she said, pale and muted, numbed with frozen fear.  &quot;Why
criminal lunacy?  What have I done?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is between you and your Maker,&quot; he jeered.  &quot;I shall never
ask.  But certain tendencies end in criminal lunacy, unless they
are curbed in time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mean like knowing the Eastwoods?&quot; asked Yvette, after a
pause of numb fear.</p>

<p>&quot;Do I mean like nosing round such people as Mrs. Fawcett, a Jewess,
and ex-Major Eastwood, a man who goes off with an older woman for
the sake of her money?  Why yes, I do!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you CAN'T say that,&quot; cried Yvette.  &quot;He's an awfully simple,
straightforward man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is apparently one of your sort.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well. - In a way, I thought he was.  I thought you'd like him too,&quot;
she said, simply, hardly knowing what she said.</p>

<p>The rector backed into the curtains, as if the girl menaced him
with something fearful.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't say any more,&quot; he snarled, abject.  &quot;Don't say any more.
You've said too much, to implicate you.  I don't want to learn any
more horrors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what horrors?&quot; she persisted.</p>

<p>The very na&iuml;vet&eacute; of her unscrupulous innocence repelled him, cowed
him still more.</p>

<p>&quot;Say no more!&quot; he said, in a low, hissing voice.  &quot;But I will kill
you before you shall go the way of your mother.&quot;</p>

<p>She looked at him, as he stood there backed against the velvet
curtains of his study, his face yellow, his eyes distraught like a
rat's with fear and rage and hate, and a numb, frozen loneliness
came over her.  For her too, the meaning had gone out of
everything.</p>

<p>It was hard to break the frozen, sterile silence that ensued.  At
last, however, she looked at him.  And in spite of herself, beyond
her own knowledge, the contempt for him was in her young, clear,
baffled eyes.  It fell like the slave's collar over his neck,
finally.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mean I mustn't know the Eastwoods?&quot; she said</p>

<p>&quot;You can know them if you wish,&quot; he sneered.  &quot;But you must not
expect to associate with your Granny, and your Aunt Cissie, and
Lucille, if you do.  I cannot have THEM contaminated.  Your Granny
was a faithful wife and a faithful mother, if ever one existed.
She has already had one shock of shame and abomination to endure.
She shall never be exposed to another.&quot;</p>

<p>Yvette heard it all dimly, half hearing.</p>

<p>&quot;I can send a note and say you disapprove,&quot; she said dimly.</p>

<p>&quot;You follow your own course of action.  But remember, you have to
choose between clean people, and reverence for your Granny's
blameless old age, and people who are unclean in their minds and
their bodies.&quot;</p>

<p>Again there was a silence.  Then she looked at him, and her face
was more puzzled than anything.  But somewhere at the back of her
perplexity was that peculiar calm, virgin contempt of the free-born
for the base-born.  He, and all the Saywells, were base-born.</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; she said.  &quot;I'll write and say you disapprove.&quot;</p>

<p>He did not answer.  He was partly flattered, secretly triumphant,
but abjectedly.</p>

<p>&quot;I have tried to keep this from your Granny and Aunt Cissie,&quot; he
said.  &quot;It need not be public property, since you choose to make
your friendship clandestine.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a dreary silence.</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; she said.  &quot;I'll go and write.&quot;</p>

<p>And she crept out of the room.</p>

<p>She addressed her little note to Mrs. Eastwood.  &quot;Dear Mrs.
Eastwood, Daddy doesn't approve of my coming to see you.  So you
will understand if we have to break it off.  I'm awfully sorry - .&quot;
That was all.</p>

<p>Yet she felt a dreary blank when she had posted her letter.  She
was now even afraid of her own thoughts.  She wanted, now, to be
held against the slender, fine-shaped breast of the gipsy.  She
wanted him to hold her in his arms, if only for once, for once, and
comfort and confirm her.  She wanted to be confirmed by him,
against her father, who had only a repulsive fear of her.</p>

<p>And at the same time she cringed and winced, so that she could
hardly walk, for fear the thought was obscene, a criminal lunacy.
It seemed to wound her heels as she walked, the fear.  The fear,
the great cold fear of the base-born, her father, everything human
and swarming.  Like a great bog humanity swamped her, and she sank
in, weak at the knees, filled with repulsion and fear of every
person she met.</p>

<p>She adjusted herself, however, quite rapidly to her new conception
of people.  She had to live.  It is useless to quarrel with one's
bread and butter.  And to expect a great deal out of life is
puerile.  So, with the rapid adaptability of the postwar
generation, she adjusted herself to the new facts.  Her father was
what he was.  He would always play up to appearances.  She would do
the same.  She too would play up to appearances.</p>

<p>So, underneath the blithe, gossamer-straying insouciance, a certain
hardness formed, like rock crystallising in her heart.  She lost
her illusions in the collapse of her sympathies.  Outwardly, she
seemed the same.  Inwardly she was hard and detached, and, unknown
to herself, revengeful.</p>

<p>Outwardly she remained the same.  It was part of her game.  While
circumstances remained as they were, she must remain, at least in
appearance, true to what was expected of her.</p>

<p>But the revengefulness came out in her new vision of people.  Under
the rector's apparently gallant handsomeness, she saw the weak,
feeble nullity.  And she despised him.  Yet still, in a way, she
liked him too.  Feelings are so complicated.</p>

<p>It was Granny whom she came to detest with all her soul.  That
obese old woman, sitting there in her blindness like some great
red-blotched fungus, her neck swallowed between her heaped-up
shoulders and her rolling, ancient chins, so that she was neckless
as a double potato, her Yvette really hated, with that pure, sheer
hatred which is almost a joy.  Her hate was so clear, that while
she was feeling strong, she enjoyed it.</p>

<p>The old woman sat with her big, reddened face pressed a little
back, her lace cap perched on her thin white hair, her stub nose
still assertive, and her old mouth shut like a trap.  This motherly
old soul, her mouth gave her away.  It always had been one of the
compressed sort.  But in her great age, it had gone like a toad's
lipless, the jaw pressing up like the lower jaw of a trap.  The
look Yvette most hated, was the look of that lower jaw pressing
relentlessly up, with an ancient prognathous thrust, so that the
snub nose in turn was forced to press upwards, and the whole face
was pressed a little back, beneath the big, wall-like forehead.
The will, the ancient, toad-like obscene WILL in the old woman, was
fearful, once you saw it: a toad-like self-will that was godless,
and less than human!  It belonged to the old, enduring race of
toads, or tortoises.  And it made one feel that Granny would never
die.  She would live on like these higher reptiles, in a state of
semi-coma, forever.</p>

<p>Yvette dared not even suggest to her father that Granny was not
perfect.  He would have threatened his daughter with the lunatic
asylum.  That was the threat he always seemed to have up his
sleeve: the lunatic asylum.  Exactly as if a distaste for Granny
and for that horrible house of relatives was in itself a proof of
lunacy, dangerous lunacy.</p>

<p>Yet in one of her moods of irritable depression, she did once fling
out:</p>

<p>&quot;How perfectly beastly, this house is!  Aunt Lucy comes, and Aunt
Nell, and Aunt Alice, and they make a ring like a ring of crows,
with Granny and Aunt Cissie, all lifting their skirts up and
warming their legs at the fire, and shutting Lucille and me out.
We're nothing but outsiders in this beastly house!&quot;</p>

<p>Her father glanced at her curiously.  But she managed to put a
petulance into her speech, and a mere cross rudeness into her look,
so that he could laugh, as at a childish tantrum.  Somewhere,
though, he knew that she coldly, venomously meant what she said,
and he was wary of her.</p>

<p>Her life seemed now nothing but an irritable friction against the
unsavoury household of the Saywells, in which she was immersed.
She loathed the rectory with a loathing that consumed her life, a
loathing so strong, that she could not really go away from the
place.  While it endured, she was spell-bound to it, in revulsion.</p>

<p>She forgot the Eastwoods again.  After all! what was the revolt of
the little Jewess, compared to Granny and the Saywell bunch!  A
husband was never more than a semicasual thing!  But a family! - an
awful, smelly family that would never disperse, stuck half dead
round the base of a fungoid old woman!  How was one to cope with
that?</p>

<p>She did not forget the gipsy entirely.  But she had no time for
him.  She, who was bored almost to agony, and who had nothing at
all to do, she had not time to think even, seriously, of anything.
Time being, after all, only the current of the soul in its flow.</p>

<p>She saw the gipsy twice.  Once he came to the house, with things to
sell.  And she, watching him from the landing window, refused to go
down.  He saw her too, as he was putting his things back into his
cart.  But he too gave no sign.  Being of a race that exists only
to be harrying the outskirts of our society, forever hostile and
living only by spoil, he was too much master to himself, and too
wary, to expose himself openly to the vast and gruesome clutch of
our law.  He had been through the war.  He had been enslaved
against his will, that time.</p>

<p>So now, he showed himself at the rectory, and slowly, quietly
busied himself at his cart outside the white gate, with that air of
silent and forever-unyielding outsideness which gave him his
lonely, predative grace.  He knew she saw him.  And she should see
him unyielding, quietly hawking his copper vessels, on an old, old
war-path against such as herself.</p>

<p>Such as herself?  Perhaps he was mistaken.  Her heart, in its
stroke, now rang hard as his hammer upon his copper, beating
against circumstances.  But he struck stealthily on the outside,
and she still more secretly on the inside of the establishment.
She liked him.  She liked the quiet, noiseless clean-cut presence
of him.  She liked that mysterious endurance in him, which endures
in opposition, without any idea of victory.  And she liked that
peculiar added relentlessness, the disillusion in hostility, which
belongs to after the war.  Yes, if she belonged to any side, and to
any clan, it was to his.  Almost she could have found in her heart
to go with him, and be a pariah gipsy-woman.</p>

<p>But she was born inside the pale.  And she liked comfort, and a
certain prestige.  Even as a mere rector's daughter, one did have a
certain prestige.  And she liked that.  Also she liked to chip
against the pillars of the temple, from the inside.  She wanted to
be safe under the temple roof.  Yet she enjoyed chipping fragments
off the supporting pillars.  Doubtless many fragments had been
whittled away from the pillars of the Philistine, before Samson
pulled the temple down.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not sure one shouldn't have one's fling till one is twenty-
six, and then give in, and marry!&quot;</p>

<p>This was Lucille's philosophy, learned from older women.  Yvette
was twenty-one.  It meant she had five more years in which to have
this precious fling.  And the fling meant, at the moment, the
gipsy.  The marriage, at the age of twenty-six, meant Leo or Gerry.</p>

<p>So, a woman could eat her cake and have her bread and butter.</p>

<p>Yvette, pitched in gruesome, deadlocked hostility to the Saywell
household, was very old and very wise: with the agedness and the
wisdom of the young, which always overleaps the agedness and the
wisdom of the old, or the elderly.</p>

<p>The second time, she met the gipsy by accident.  It was March, and
sunny weather, after unheard-of rain.  Celandines were yellow in
the hedges, and primroses among the rocks.  But still there came a
smell of sulphur from far-away steelworks, out of the steel-blue
sky.</p>

<p>And yet it was spring.</p>

<p>Yvette was cycling slowly along by Codnor Gate, past the lime
quarries, when she saw the gipsy coming away from the door of a
stone cottage.  His cart stood there in the road.  He was returning
with his brooms and copper things, to the cart.</p>

<p>She got down from her bicycle.  As she saw him, she loved with
curious tenderness, the slim lines of his body in the green jersey,
the turn of his silent face.  She felt she knew him better than she
knew anybody on earth, even Lucille, and belonged to him, in some
way, for ever.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you made anything new and nice?&quot; she asked innocently,
looking at his copper things.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think,&quot; he said, glancing back at her.</p>

<p>The desire was still there, still curious and naked, in his eyes.
But it was more remote, the boldness was diminished.  There was a
tiny glint, as if he might dislike her.  But this dissolved again,
as he saw her looking among his bits of copper and brasswork.  She
searched them diligently.</p>

<p>There was a little oval brass plate, with a queer figure like a
palm-tree beaten upon it.</p>

<p>&quot;I like that,&quot; she said.  &quot;How much is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What you like,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>This made her nervous: he seemed off-hand, almost mocking.</p>

<p>&quot;I'd rather you said,&quot; she told him, looking up at him.</p>

<p>&quot;You give me what you like,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; she said, suddenly.  &quot;If you won't tell me I won't have it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; he said.  &quot;Two shilling.&quot;</p>

<p>She found half-a-crown, and he drew from his pocket a handful of
silver, from which he gave her her sixpence.</p>

<p>&quot;The old gipsy dreamed something about you,&quot; he said, looking at
her with curious, searching eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Did she!&quot; cried Yvette, at once interested.  &quot;What was it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She said:  Be braver in your heart, or you lose your game.  She
said it this way:  Be braver in your body, or your luck will leave
you.  And she said as well:  Listen for the voice of water.&quot;</p>

<p>Yvette was very much impressed.</p>

<p>&quot;And what does it mean?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I asked her,&quot; he said.  &quot;She says she don't know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me again what it was,&quot; said Yvette.</p>

<p>&quot;'Be braver in your body, or your luck will go.'  And:  'Listen for
the voice of water.'&quot;</p>

<p>He looked in silence at her soft, pondering face.  Something almost
like a perfume seemed to flow from her young bosom direct to him,
in a grateful connection.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm to be braver in my body, and I'm to listen for the voice of
water!  All right!&quot; she said.  &quot;I don't understand, but perhaps I
shall.&quot;</p>

<p>She looked at him with clear eyes.  Man or woman is made up of many
selves.  With one self, she loved this gipsy man.  With many
selves, she ignored him or had a distaste for him.</p>

<p>&quot;You're not coming up to the Head no more?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>Again she looked at him absently.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps I will,&quot; she said, &quot;some time.  Some time!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Spring weather!&quot; he said, smiling faintly and glancing round at
the sun.  &quot;We're going to break camp soon, and go away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When?&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps next week.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where to?&quot;</p>

<p>Again he made a move with his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps up north,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>She looked at him.</p>

<p>&quot;All right!&quot; she said.  &quot;Perhaps I WILL come up before you go, and
say goodbye! to your wife and to the old woman who sent me the
message.&quot;</p>
