<p>The suite of rooms into which they were ushered appeared to be
furnished in irreproachable taste. Except for the <em>salon</em>
at the further end of the suite, where play was in progress, the
charming apartment might have been a private one; and the homelike
simplicity of the room, where books, flowers, and even a big,
grey cat confirmed the first agreeable impression, accented the
lurking smile on Sengoun's lips.</p>

<p>Doc Curfoot, in evening dress, came forward to receive them,
in company with another man, young, nice-looking, very straight,
and with the high, square shoulders of a Prussian.</p>

<p>"<em>Bong soire, mussoors</em>," said Curfoot genially. "<em>J'ai
l'honnoor de vous faire connaitre mong ami, Mussoor Weishelm.</em>"</p>

<p>They exchanged very serious bows with "Mussoor" Weishelm, and
Curfoot retired.</p>

<p>In excellent French Weishelm inquired whether they desired supper;
and learning that they did not, bowed smilingly and bade them
welcome:</p>

<p>"You are at home, gentlemen; the house is yours. If it pleases
you to sup, we offer you our hospitality; if you care to play,
the <em>salon</em> is at your disposal, or, if you prefer, a private
room. Yonder is the buffet; there are electric bells at your elbow.
You are at home," he repeated, clicked his heels together, bowed,
and took his leave.</p>

<p>Sengoun dropped into a comfortable chair and sent a waiter for
caviar, toast, and German champagne.</p>

<p>Neeland lighted a cigarette, seated himself, and looked about
him curiously.</p>

<p>Over in a corner on a sofa a rather pretty woman, a cigarette
between her jewelled fingers, was reading an evening newspaper.
Two others in the adjoining room, young and attractive, their
feet on the fireplace fender, conversed together over a sandwich,
a glass of the widely advertised Dubonnet, and another of the
equally advertised Bon Lait Maggi&mdash;as serenely and as comfortably
as though they were by their own firesides.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they are," remarked Sengoun, plastering an oblong of
hot toast with caviar. "Birds of this kind nest easily anywhere."</p>

<p>Neeland continued to gaze toward the <em>salon</em> where play
was in progress. There did not seem to be many people there. At
a small table he recognised Brandes and Stull playing what appeared
to be bridge whist with two men whom he had never before seen.
There were no women playing.</p>

<p>As he watched the round, expressionless face of Brandes, who
was puffing a long cigar screwed tightly into the corner of his
thin-lipped mouth, it occurred to him somewhat tardily what Rue
Carew had said concerning personal danger to himself if any of
these people believed him capable of reconstructing from memory
any of the stolen plans.</p>

<p>He had not thought about that specific contingency; instinct
alone had troubled him a little when he first entered the Café
des Bulgars.</p>

<p>However, his unquiet eyes could discover nothing of either Kestner
or Breslau; and, somehow, he did not even think of encountering
Ilse Dumont in such a place. As for Brandes and Stull, they did
not recognise him at all.</p>

<p>So, entirely reassured once more by the absence of Ali-Baba and
Golden Beard, and of Scheherazade whom he had no fear of meeting,
Neeland ate his caviar with a relish and examined his surroundings.</p>

<p>Of course it was perfectly possible that the stolen papers had
been brought here. There were three other floors in the building,
too, and he wondered what they were used for.</p>

<p>Sengoun's appetite for conflict waned as he ate and drank; and
a violent desire to gamble replaced it.</p>

<p>"You poke about a bit," he said to Neeland. "Talk to that girl
over there and see what you can learn. As for me, I mean to start
a little flirtation with Mademoiselle Fortuna. Does that suit
you?"</p>

<p>If Sengoun wished to play it was none of Neeland's business.</p>

<p>"Do you think it an honest game?" he asked, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"With negligible stakes all first-class gamblers are honest."</p>

<p>"If I were you, Sengoun, I wouldn't drink anything more."</p>

<p>"Excellent advice, old fellow!" emptying his goblet with satisfaction.
And, rising to his firm and graceful height, he strolled away
toward the <em>salon</em> where play progressed amid the most
decorous and edifying of atmospheres.</p>

<p>Neeland watched him disappear, then he glanced curiously at the
girl on the sofa who was still preoccupied with her newspaper.</p>

<p>So he rose, sauntered about the room examining the few pictures
and bronzes, modern but excellent. The carpet under foot was thick
and soft, but, as he strolled past the girl who seemed to be so
intently reading, she looked up over her paper and returned his
civil recognition of her presence with a slight smile.</p>

<p>As he appeared inclined to linger, she said with pleasant self-possession:</p>

<p>"These newspaper rumours, monsieur, are becoming too persistent
to amuse us much longer. War talk is becoming <em>vieux jeu</em>."</p>

<p>"Why read them?" inquired Neeland with a smile.</p>

<p>"Why?" She made a slight gesture. "One reads what is printed,
I suppose."</p>

<p>"Written and printed by people who know no more about the matter
in question than you and I, mademoiselle," he remarked, still
smiling.</p>

<p>"That is perfectly true. Why is it worth while for anyone to
search for truth in these days when everyone is paid to conceal
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "not everyone."</p>

<p>"No; some lie naturally and without pay," she admitted indifferently.</p>

<p>"But there are still others. For example, mademoiselle, yourself."</p>

<p>"I?" She laughed, not troubling to refute the suggestion of her
possible truthfulness.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>"This&mdash;club&mdash;is furnished in excellent taste."</p>

<p>"Yes; it is quite new."</p>

<p>"Has it a name?"</p>

<p>"I believe it is called the Cercle Extranationale. Would monsieur
also like to know the name of the club cat?"</p>

<p>They both laughed easily, but he could make nothing of her.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said; "and I fear I have interrupted your reading&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I have read enough lies; I am quite ready to tell you a few.
Shall I?"</p>

<p>"You are most amiable. I have been wondering what the other floors
in this building are used for."</p>

<p>"Private apartments," she replied smiling, looking him straight
in the eyes. "Now you don't know whether I've told you the truth
or not; do you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I know."</p>

<p>"Which, then?"</p>

<p>"The truth."</p>

<p>She laughed and indicated a chair; and he seated himself.</p>

<p>"Who is the dark, nice-looking gentleman accompanying you?" she
enquired.</p>

<p>"How could you see him at all through your newspaper?"</p>

<p>"I poked a hole, of course."</p>

<p>"To look at him or at me?"</p>

<p>"Your mirror ought to reassure you. However, as an afterthought,
who is he?"</p>

<p>"Prince Erlik, of Mongolia," replied Neeland solemnly.</p>

<p>"I supposed so. We of the infernal aristocracy belong together.
I am the Contessa Diabletta d'Enfer."</p>

<p>He inclined gravely:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't belong here," he said. "I'm only a Yankee."</p>

<p>"Hell is full of them," she said, smiling. "All Yankees belong
where Prince Erlik and I are at home.... Do you play?"</p>

<p>"No. Do you?"</p>

<p>"It depends on chance."</p>

<p>"It would give me much pleasure&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Thank you, not tonight." And in the same, level, pleasant voice:
"Don't look immediately, but from where you sit you can see in
the mirror opposite two women seated in the next room."</p>

<p>After a moment he nodded.</p>

<p>"Are they watching us?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Mr. Neeland?"</p>

<p>He reddened with surprise.</p>

<p>"Get Captain Sengoun and leave," she said, still smiling. "Do
it carelessly, convincingly. Neither of you needs courage; both
of you lack common sense. Get up, take leave of me nicely but
regretfully, as though I had denied you a rendezvous. You will
be killed if you remain here."</p>

<p>For a moment Neeland hesitated, but curiosity won:</p>

<p>"Who is likely to try anything of that sort?" he asked. And a
tingling sensation, not wholly unpleasant, passed over him.</p>

<p>"Almost anyone here, if you are recognised," she said, as gaily
as though she were imparting delightful information.</p>

<p>"But <em>you</em> recognise us. And I'm certainly not dead yet."</p>

<p>"Which ought to tell you more about me than I am likely to tell
anybody. Now, when I smile at you and shake my head, make your
adieux to me, find Captain Sengoun, and take your departure. Do
you understand?"</p>

<p>"Are you really serious?"</p>

<p>"It is you who should be serious. Now, I give you your signal,
Monsieur Neeland&#11834;"</p>

<p>But the smile stiffened on her pretty face, and at the same moment
he was aware that somebody had entered the room and was standing
directly behind him.</p>

<p>He turned on his chair and looked up into the face of Ilse Dumont.</p>

<p>There was a second's hesitation, then he was on his feet, greeting
her cordially, apparently entirely at ease and with nothing on
his mind except the agreeable surprise of the encounter.</p>

<p>"I had your note," he said. "It was charming of you to write,
but very neglectful of you not to include your address. Tell me,
how have you been since I last saw you?"</p>

<p>Ilse Dumont's red lips seemed to be dry, for she moistened them
without speaking. In her eyes he saw peril&mdash;knowledge of something
terrible&mdash;some instant menace.</p>

<p>Then her eyes, charged with lightning, slowly turned from him
to the girl on the sofa who had not moved. But in her eyes, too,
a little flame began to flicker and play, and the fixed smile
relaxed into an expression of cool self-possession.</p>

<p>Neeland's pleasant, careless voice broke the occult tension:</p>

<p>"This is a pretty club," he said; "everything here is in such
excellent taste. You might have told me about it," he added to
Ilse with smiling reproach; "but you never even mentioned it,
and I discovered it quite by accident."</p>

<p>Ilse Dumont seemed to find her voice with an effort:</p>

<p>"May I have a word with you, Mr. Neeland?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Always," he assured her promptly. "I am always more than happy
to listen to you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Please follow me!"</p>

<p>He turned to the girl on the sofa and made his adieux with conventional
ceremony and a reckless smile which said:</p>

<p>"You were quite right, mademoiselle; I'm in trouble already."</p>

<p>Then he followed Ilse Dumont into the adjoining room, which was
lined with filled bookcases and where the lounges and deep chairs
were covered with leather.</p>

<p>Halting by the library table, Ilse Dumont turned to him&mdash;turned
on him a look such as he never before had encountered in any living
woman's eyes&mdash;a dead gaze, dreadful, glazed, as impersonal as
the fixed regard of a corpse.</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>"I came.... They sent for me.... I did not believe they had the
right man.... I could not believe it, Neeland."</p>

<p>A trifle shaken, he said in tones which sounded steady enough:</p>

<p>"What frightens you so, Scheherazade?"</p>

<p>"Why did you come? Are you absolutely mad?"</p>

<p>"Mad? No, I don't think so," he replied with a forced smile.
"What threatens me here, Scheherazade?"&mdash;regarding her pallid
face attentively.</p>

<p>"Death.... You must have known it when you came."</p>

<p>"Death? No, I didn't know it."</p>

<p>"Did you suppose that if they could get hold of you they'd let
you go? &mdash;A man who might carry in his memory the plans for
which they tried to kill you? I wrote to you &mdash;I wrote to
you to go back to America! And&mdash;<em>this</em> is what you have
done instead!"</p>

<p>"Well," he said in a pleasant but rather serious voice, "if you
really believe there is danger for me if I remain here, perhaps
I'd better go."</p>

<p>"You <em>can't</em> go!"</p>

<p>"You think I'll be stopped?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Who is your crazy companion? I heard that he is Alak Sengoun&mdash;the
headlong fool&mdash;they call Prince Erlik. Is it true?"</p>

<p>"Where did you hear all these things?" he demanded. "Where were
you when you heard them?"</p>

<p>"At the Turkish Embassy. Word came that they had caught you.
I did not believe it; others present doubted it.... But as the
rumour concerned <em>you</em>, I took no chances; I came instantly.
I &mdash;I had rather be dead than see you here&#11834;" Her voice
became unsteady, but she controlled it at once:</p>

<p>"Neeland! Neeland! Why did you come? Why have you undone all
I tried to do for you&#11834;?"</p>

<p>He looked intently at Ilse Dumont, then his gaze swept the handsome
suite of rooms. No one seemed to notice him; in perspective, men
moved leisurely about the further <em>salon</em>, where play was
going on; and there seemed to be no one else in sight. And, as
he stood there, free, in full pride and vigour of youth and strength,
he became incredulous that anything could threaten him which he
could not take care of.</p>

<p>A smile grew in his eyes, confident, humorous, a little hint
of tenderness in it:</p>

<p>"Scheherazade," he said, "you are a dear. You pulled me out of
a dreadful mess on the <em>Volhynia</em>. I offer you gratitude,
respect, and the very warm regard for you which I really cherish
in my heart."</p>

<p>He took her hands, kissed them, looked up half laughing, half
in earnest.</p>

<p>"If you're worried," he said, "I'll find Captain Sengoun and
we'll depart&#11834;"</p>

<p>She retained his hands in a convulsive clasp:</p>

<p>"Oh, Neeland! Neeland! There are men below who will never let
you pass! And Breslau and Kestner are coming here later. And that
devil, Damat Mahmud Bey!"</p>

<p>"Golden Beard and Ali Baba and the whole Arabian Nights!" exclaimed
Neeland. "Who is Damat Mahmud Bey, Scheherazade dear?"</p>

<p>"The shadow of Abdul Hamid."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear child, but Abdul the Damned is shut up tight in a
fortress!"</p>

<p>"His shadow dogs the spurred heels of Enver Pasha," she said,
striving to maintain her composure. "Oh, Neeland! &mdash;A hundred
thousand Armenians are yet to die in that accursed shadow! And
do you think Mahmud Damat will hesitate in regard to <em>you</em>!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Does a murderous Moslem go about Paris killing people
he doesn't happen to fancy? Those things aren't done&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Have you and Sengoun any weapons at all?" she interrupted desperately,
"Anything! &mdash;A sword cane&#11834;?"</p>

<p>"No. What the devil does all this business mean?" he broke out
impatiently. "What's all this menace of lawlessness&mdash;this impudent
threat of interference&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It is <em>war</em>!"</p>

<p>"War?" he repeated, not quite understanding her.</p>

<p>She caught him by the arm:</p>

<p>"War!" she whispered; "War! Do you understand? They don't care
what they do now! They mean to kill you here in this place. They'll
be out of France before anybody finds you."</p>

<p>"Has war actually been declared?" he asked, astounded.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow! It is known in certain circles!" She dropped his arm
and clasped her hands and stood there twisting them, white, desperate,
looking about her like a hunted thing.</p>

<p>"Why did you do this?" she repeated in an agonised voice. "What
can I do? I'm no traitor!... But I'd give you a pistol if I had
one&#11834;" She checked herself as the girl who had been reading
an evening newspaper on a sofa, and to whom Neeland had been talking
when Ilse Dumont entered, came sauntering into the room.</p>

<p>The eyes of both women met; both turned a trifle paler. Then
Ilse Dumont walked slowly up to the other:</p>

<p>"I overheard your warning," she said with a deadly stare.</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>Ilse stretched out her bare arm, palm upward, and closed the
fingers tightly:</p>

<p>"I hold your life in my hand. I have only to speak. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You are lying. You <em>do</em> understand. You take double wages;
but it is not France you betray! Nor Russia!"</p>

<p>"Are you insane?"</p>

<p>"Almost. <em>Where do you carry them?</em>"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Answer quickly. <em>Where?</em> I tell you, I'll expose you
in another moment if you don't answer me! Speak quickly!"</p>

<p>The other woman had turned a ghastly white; for a second or two
she remained dumb, then, dry-lipped:</p>

<p>"Above&mdash;the knee," she stammered; but there was scarcely a sound
from the blanched lips that formed the words.</p>

<p>"Pistols?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Loaded? Both of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Clips?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Unstrap them!"</p>

<p>The woman turned, bent almost double, twisting her supple body
entirely around; but Ilse Dumont was at her side like a flash
and caught her wrist as she withdrew her hand from the hem of
her fluffy skirt.</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;<em>take</em> your life!" said Ilse Dumont between her
teeth. "There's the door! Go out!"&mdash;following her with blazing
eyes&mdash;"Stop! Stand where you are until I come!"</p>

<p>Then she came quickly to where Neeland stood, astonished; and
thrust two automatic pistols into his hands.</p>

<p>"Get Sengoun," she whispered. "Don't go <em>down</em>-stairs,
for God's sake. Get to the roof, if you can. Try&mdash;oh, try, try,
Neeland, my friend!" Her voice trembled; she looked into his eyes&mdash;gave
him, in that swift regard, all that a woman withholds until the
right man asks.</p>

<p>Her lips quivered; she turned sharply on her heel, went to the
outer hallway, where the other woman stood motionless.</p>

<p>"What am I to do with <em>you</em>?" demanded Ilse Dumont. "Do
you think you are going out of here to summon the police? Mount
those stairs!"</p>

<p>The woman dropped her hand on the banisters, heavily, set foot
on the first stair, then slowly mounted as though her little feet
in their dainty evening slippers were weighted with ball and chain.</p>

<p>Ilse Dumont followed her, opened a door in the passage, motioned
her to enter. It was a bedroom that the electric light revealed.
The woman entered and stood by the bed as though stupefied.</p>

<p>"I'll keep my word to you," said Ilse Dumont. "When it becomes
too late for you to do us any mischief, I'll return and let you
go."</p>

<p>And she stepped back across the threshold and locked the door
on the outside.</p>

<p>As she did so, Neeland and Sengoun came swiftly up the stairs,
and she beckoned them to follow, gathered the skirts of her evening
gown into one hand, and ran up the stairs ahead of them to the
fifth floor.</p>

<p>In the dim light Neeland saw that the top floor was merely a
vast attic full of débris from the café on the ground floor&mdash;iron
tables which required mending or repainting, iron chairs, great
jars of artificial stone with dead baytrees standing in them,
parts of rusty stoves and kitchen ranges, broken cutlery in boxes,
cracked table china and heavier kitchen crockery in tubs which
once had held flowers.</p>

<p>The only windows gave on a court. Through their dirty panes already
the grey light of that early Sunday morning glimmered, revealing
the contents of the shadowy place, and the position of an iron
ladder hooked to two rings under the scuttle overhead.</p>

<p>Ilse Dumont laid her finger on her lips, conjuring silence, then,
clutching her silken skirts, she started up the iron ladder, reached
the top, and, exerting all her strength, lifted the hinged scuttle
leading to the leads outside.</p>

<p>Instantly somebody challenged her in a guttural voice. She stood
there a few moments in whispered conversation, then, from outside,
somebody lowered the scuttle cover; the girl locked it, descended
the iron ladder backwards, and came swiftly across to where Neeland
and Sengoun were standing, pistols lifted.</p>

<p>"They're guarding the roof," she whispered, "&mdash;two men. It is
hopeless, that way."</p>

<p>"The proper way," said Sengoun calmly, "is for us to shoot our
way out of this!"</p>

<p>The girl turned on him in a passion:</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I care what happens to <em>you</em>?" she said.
"If there were no one else to consider you might do as you pleased,
for all it concerns me!"</p>

<p>Sengoun reddened:</p>

<p>"Be silent, you treacherous little cat!" he retorted. "Do you
imagine your riffraff are going to hold <em>me</em> here when
I'm ready to depart! <em>Me!</em> A free Cossack! Bah!"</p>

<p>"Don't talk that way, Sengoun," said Neeland sharply. "We owe
these pistols to her."</p>

<p>"Oh," muttered Sengoun, shooting a menacing glance at her. "I
didn't understand that." Then his scowl softened and a sudden
laugh cleared his face.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, mademoiselle," he said. "You're quite welcome to
your low opinion of me. But if anyone should ask me, I'd say that
I don't understand what is happening to us. And after a while
I'll become angry and go downstairs for information."</p>

<p>"They know nothing about you in the <em>salle de jeu</em>," she
said, "but on the floor below they're waiting to kill you."</p>

<p>Neeland, astonished, asked her whether the American gamblers
in the <em>salon</em> where Sengoun had been playing were ignorant
of what was going on in the house.</p>

<p>"What Americans?" she demanded, incredulously. "Do you mean Weishelm?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you know there were Americans employed in the <em>salle
de jeu</em>?" asked Neeland, surprised.</p>

<p>"No. I have not been in this house for a year until I came tonight.
This place is maintained by the Turkish Government&mdash;" She flashed
a glance at Sengoun&mdash;"<em>you're</em> welcome to the information
now," she added contemptuously. And then, to Neeland: "There was,
I believe, some talk in New York about adding one or two Americans
to the personnel, but I opposed it."</p>

<p>"They're here," said Neeland drily.</p>

<p>"Do you know who they are?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There's a man called Doc Curfoot&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Who!!</em>"</p>

<p>And suddenly, for the first time, Neeland remembered that she
had been the wife of one of the men below.</p>

<p>"Brandes and Stull are the others," he said mechanically.</p>

<p>The girl stared at him as though she did not comprehend, and
she passed one hand slowly across her forehead and eyes.</p>

<p>"Eddie Brandes? <em>Here?</em> And Stull? Curfoot? <em>Here in
this house!</em>"</p>

<p>"In the <em>salon</em> below."</p>

<p>"They <em>can't</em> be!" she protested in an odd, colourless
voice. "They were bought soul and body by the British Secret Service!"</p>

<p>All three stood staring at one another; the girl flushed, clenched
her hand, then let it fall by her side as though utterly overcome.</p>

<p>"All this espionage!" cried Sengoun, furiously. " &mdash;It makes
me sick, I tell you! Where everybody betrays everybody is no place
for a free Cossack!&#11834;"</p>

<p>The terrible expression on the girl's face checked him; she said,
slowly:</p>

<p>"It is we others who have been betrayed, it seems. It is <em>we</em>
who are trapped here. They've got us all&mdash;every one of us. Oh,
my God!&mdash;every one of us&mdash;at last!"</p>

<p>She lifted her haggard face and stared at the increasing light
which was turning the window panes a sickly yellow.</p>

<p>"With sunrise comes war," she said in a stunned voice, as though
to convince herself. "We are caught here in this house. And Kestner
and Weishelm and Breslau and <em>I&#11834;" </em>she trembled, framing
her burning face in slim hands that were like ice. "Do you understand
that Brandes and Curfoot, bought by England, have contracted to
deliver us to a French court martial?"</p>

<p>The men looked at her in silence.</p>

<p>"Kestner and Breslau knew they had been bought. One of our own
people witnessed that treachery. But we never dreamed that these
traitors would venture into this house tonight. We should have
come here ourselves instead of going to the Turkish Embassy. That
was Mahmud Damat's meddling! His messenger insisted. God! What
a mistake! What a deathly mistake for all of us!"</p>

<p>She leaned for a moment against one of the iron pillars which
supported the attic roof, and covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>After a moment, Neeland said:</p>

<p>"I don't understand why you can't leave this house if you are
in danger. You say that there are men downstairs who are waiting
to kill us&mdash;waiting only for Kestner and Breslau and Mahmud Damat
to arrive."</p>

<p>She said faintly:</p>

<p>"I did not before understand Mahmud's delay. Now, I understand.
He has been warned. Breslau and Kestner will not come. Otherwise,
you now would be barricaded behind that breastwork of rubbish,
fighting for your lives."</p>

<p>"But you say there are men on the stairs below who are ready
to kill us if we try to leave the house."</p>

<p>"They, too, are trapped without knowing it. War will come with
sunrise. This house has been under surveillance since yesterday
afternoon. They have not closed in on us yet, because they are
leaving the trap open in hopes of catching us all. They are waiting
for Breslau and Kestner and Mahmud Damat.... But they'll never
come, now.... They are out of the city by this time.... I know
them. They are running for their lives at this hour.... And we&mdash;we
lesser ones&mdash;caught here&mdash;trapped&mdash;reserved for a French court
martial and a firing squad in a barrack square!"</p>

<p>She shuddered and pressed her hands over her temples.</p>

<p>Neeland said:</p>

<p>"I am going to stand by you. Captain Sengoun will do the same."</p>

<p>She shook her head:</p>

<p>"No use," she said with a shiver. "I am too well known. They
have my <em>dossier</em> almost complete. My <em>procès</em> will
be a brief one."</p>

<p>"Can't you get away by the roof? There are two of your men up
there."</p>

<p>"They themselves are caught, and do not even know it. They too
will face a squad of execution before the sun rises tomorrow.
And they never dream of it up there&#11834;"</p>

<p>She made a hopeless gesture:</p>

<p>"What is the use! When I came here from the Turkish Embassy,
hearing that you were here but believing the information false,
I discovered you conversing with a Russian spy&mdash;overheard her
warn you to leave this house.</p>

<p>"And there, all the while, unknown to me, in the <em>salle de
jeu</em> were Curfoot and that unspeakable scoundrel Brandes!
Why, the place was swarming with enemies&mdash;and I never dreamed
it!... Yet &mdash;I might have feared some such thing &mdash;I
might have feared that the man, Brandes, who had betrayed me once,
would do it again if he ever had the chance.... And he's done
it."</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Ilse stood staring at the melancholy
greyish light on the window panes.</p>

<p>She said as though to herself:</p>

<p>"I shall never see another daybreak."... After a moment she turned
and began to pace the attic, a strange, terrible figure of haggard
youth in the shadowy light. "How horribly still it is at daybreak!"
she breathed, halting before Neeland. "How deathly quiet&#11834;"</p>

<p>The dry crack of a pistol cut her short. Then, instantly, in
the dim depths of the house, shot followed shot in bewildering
