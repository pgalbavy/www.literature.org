<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>My brother was born on the 18th of September, 1821 at Uffington,
in Berkshire, of which your great-grandfather was vicar. Uffington
was then a very primitive village, far away from any high road,
and seven miles from Wantage, the nearest town from which a coach
ran to London. There were very few neighbours, the roads were
almost impassable for carriages in the winter, and the living
was a poor one; but your great-grandfather (who was a Canon of
St. Paul’s) had exchanged a much richer living for it, because
his wife had been born there, and was deeply attached to the place.
Three George Watts’s had been vicars of Uffington, in direct succession
from father to son, and she was the daughter of the last of them.
So your grandfather, who was their only child, came to live in
the village on his marriage, in an old farmhouse close to the
church, to which your grandfather added some rooms, so as to make
it habitable. If you should ever make a pilgrimage to the place,
you will not find the house, for it has been pulled down; but
the grand old church is there, and White Horse Hill, rising just
behind the village, just as they were half a century ago, when
we first looked at them. We could see the church from our bed-room
window, and the hill from our nursery, a queer upper room amongst
the rafters, at the top of the old part of the house, with a dark
closet in one corner, into which the nurses used to put us when
we were more unruly than usual. Here we lived till your great-grandfather’s
death, thirteen years later, when your grandfather removed to
his house at Donnington.</p>

<p>The memories of our early childhood and boyhood throng upon me,
so that I scarcely know where to begin, or what to leave out.
I cannot, however, I am sure, go wrong in telling you, how I became
first aware of a great difference between us, and of the effect
the discovery had on me. In the spring of 1828, when he was seven
and I six years old, our father and mother were away from home
for a few days. We were, playing together in the garden, when
the footman came up to us, the old single-barrelled gun over his
shoulder which the gardener had for driving away birds from the
strawberries, and asked us whether we shouldn’t like to go rook-shooting.
We jumped at the offer, and trotted along by his side to the rookery,
some 300 yards from the house. As we came up we saw a small group
of our friends under the trees—the groom, the village schoolmaster,
and a farmer or two—and started forwards to greet them. Just before
we got to the trees, some of them began firing up at the young
rooks. I remember, even now, the sudden sense of startled fear
which came over me. My brother ran in at once under the trees,
and was soon carrying about the powder-horn from one to another
of the shooters. I tried to force myself to go up, but could not
manage it. Presently he ran out to me, to get me to go back with
him, but in vain. I could not overcome my first impression, and
kept hovering round, at a distance of thirty or forty yards, until
it was time for us to go back; ashamed of myself, and wondering
in my small mind why it was that he could go in amongst that horrible
flashing and smoke, and the din of firing, and cawing rooks, and
falling birds, and I could not.</p>

<p>I had encountered the same puzzle in other ways already. Some
time before my father had bought a small Shetland pony for us,
Moggy by name, upon which we were to complete our own education
in riding. We had already mastered the rudiments, under the care
of our grandfather’s coachman. He had been in our family thirty
years, and we were as fond of him as if he had been a relation.
He had taught us to sit up and hold the bridle, while he led a
quiet old cob up and down with a leading rein. But, now that Moggy
was come, we were to make quite a new step in horsemanship. Our
parents had a theory that boys must teach themselves, and that
a saddle (except for propriety, when we rode to a neighbour’s
house to carry a message, or had to appear otherwise in public)
was a hindrance rather than a help. So, after our morning’s lessons,
the coachman used to take us to the paddock in which Moggy lived,
put her bridle on, and leave us to our own devices. I could see
that that moment was, from the first, one of keen enjoyment to
my brother. He would scramble up on her back, while she went on
grazing—without caring to bring her to the elm stool in the corner
of the field, which was our mounting place—pull her head up, kick
his heels into her sides, and go scampering away round the paddock
with the keenest delight. He was Moggy’s master from the first
day, though she not unfrequently managed to get rid of him by
sharp turns, or stopping dead short in her gallop. She knew it
quite well; and, just as well, that she was mistress as soon as
I was on her back. For weeks it never came to my turn without
my wishing myself anywhere else. George would give me a lift up,
and start her. She would trot a few yards, and then begin grazing,
notwithstanding my timid expostulations, and gentle pullings at
her bridle. Then he would run up, and pull up her head, and start
her again, and she would bolt off with a flirt of her head, and
never be content till I was safely on the grass. The moment that
was effected she took to grazing again, and I believe enjoyed
the whole performance as much as George, and certainly far more
than I did. We always brought her a carrot, or bit of sugar, in
our pockets, and she was much more like a great good-tempered
dog with us than a pony.</p>

<p>Our first hunting experience now came off. Some staghounds—the
King’s, if I remember rightly—came down for a day or two’s sport
in our part of Berkshire, and a deer was to be turned out on the
downs, a few miles from our house. Accordingly the coachman was
to take us both. I was to go before him on one of the carriage
horses, made safe by leather strap which encircled us both, while
George rode Moggy. He was anxious to go unattached, but on the
whole it was considered better that the coachman should hold a
leading rein, as no one knew how Moggy might behave with the dogs,
and no one but I knew how completely she would have to do as he
chose. We arrived safely at the meet, saw the deer uncarted, the
hounds laid on, and lumbered slowly after, till they swept away
over a rise in the downs, and we saw them no more. So, after riding
about for some time, the coachman produced some bread and cheese
from his pocket, and we dismounted, and hitched up horse and pony
on the leeward side of an old barn. We had not finished our lunch,
when suddenly, to our intense delight, the stag cantered by within
twenty yards of us, and, by the time we were on horseback again,
the hunt followed. This time George and Moggy made the most desperate
efforts for freedom, but the coachman managed to keep them in
tow, and so the hunt went away from us again. I believe it was
in consequence of George’s remonstrances when he got home that
it was now settled he should be allowed to go to the next meet
of the foxhounds in our neighbourhood without a leading rein.
This is his account of that great event, in a letter to his grandmother,
almost the first he ever wrote. Those of you who have been brought
up in the country will see how respectfully he always treats the
fox, always giving him a capital F when he mentions him.</p>

"Your little dog Mustard sometimes teases the hawk by barking<br/>
at him, and sometimes the hawk flies at Mustard. I have been<br/>
out hunting upon our black pony, Moggy, and saw the Fox break<br/>
cover, and the hounds follow after him. I rode fifteen miles.<br/>
Papa brought me home the Fox’s lug. I went up a great hill to<br/>
see the hounds drive the Fox out of the wood. I saw Ashdown<br/>
Park House: there is a fine brass nob at the top of it. Tom and<br/>
I send best love to you and grandpapa.

</p>
<p>
"I am, your affectionate grandson,

</p>
<p>
"<em>GEORGE HUGHES</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>On this first occasion, as you may see by the letter, your grandfather
was out with him, and he had not been allowed to follow. But soon
afterwards his great triumph occurred, at a meet to which he and
Moggy went off one morning after breakfast, in the wildest spirits.
Your grandfather did not go out that day; so one of the farmers
who happened to be going was to give an eye to Master George,
and see that he got into no trouble, and found his way home. This
he did about three o’clock in the afternoon, bearing the brush
in his hand, with his face all covered with blood, after the barbarous
custom of those days. He had been in at the death; and the honest
farmer recounted to us in the broadest Berkshire the wonders which
he and Moggy had performed together; creeping through impossible
holes in great fences, scrambling along ditches and up banks to
the finish, when he had been singled out from outside the ring
of horsemen and led up to the master, the late Lord Ducie, to
be "blooded" by the huntsman, and receive the brush, the highest
honour the boy foxhunter can achieve.</p>

<p>And so it was with all our games and exercises, whether we were
at football, wrestling, climbing, single-stick (which latter we
were only allowed to practise in the presence of an old cavalry
pensioner, who had served at Waterloo). He seemed to lay hold
of whatever he put his hand to by the right end, and so the secret
of it delivered itself up to him at once. One often meets with
people who seem as if they had been born into the world with two
left hands, and two left feet, and rarely with a few who have
two right hands; and of these latter he was as striking an example
as I have ever known. Often as a boy, and much oftener since,
I have thought over this gift, trying to make out where the secret
lay. For, though never very ambitious myself, I was more so than
he was, and had the greatest wish to do every exercise and game
as well as I possibly could; and by dint of real hard work, and
years of practice, I did manage, in one or two instances, to reach
the point which he had attained almost as it were by instinct.
But I never could get nearer to his secret than this, that it
lay in a sort of unconsciousness, which I believe to be natural
courage. What I mean is, that what might possibly happen to himself
never seemed to cross his mind: that he might get a fall and hurt
himself, for instance, or get his head or his shins broken, or
the like. And so, not being disturbed by any such considerations
about himself, he had nothing to hinder him from just falling
at once into the very best way of doing whatever he took in hand.
Of course, even then, it required a fine body, as I have known
boys and men, of equal natural courage, who were awkward and slow
because they were very clumsily put together. But, on the other
hand, I have known many men with equally fine bodies who never
could get any decent work out of them. Now, with all the thinking
in the world about it, I never could have acquired this natural
gift; but, by having an example of it constantly before my eyes,
I got the next best thing, which was a scorn of myself for feeling
fear. This by degrees hardened into the habit of doing what I
saw him do, and so I managed to pass through school and college
without betraying the timidity of which I was ashamed.</p>

<p>Why do I make the confession now to you? Because I see the same
differences in you that there were in us. One or two of you are
naturally courageous, and the rest as naturally timid as I was.
The first I hope will always bear with the others, and help them,
as my brother helped me. If he had twitted me because I could
not come under the trees at the rook-shooting, or because I was
afraid of Moggy, I should probably never have felt the shame,
or made the exertion, necessary to overcome my natural timidity.
And to you who are not naturally courageous, I would say, make
the effort to conquer your fear at once; you can’t begin too early,
and will never be worth much till you have made it.</p>

<p>But there was another natural difference between us which deserves
a few words, as it will bring out his character more clearly to
you; and that was, that he was remarkably quiet and reserved,
and shy with strangers, and I the reverse. When we came down to
dessert, after a dinner party, and had to stand by our father’s
side (as the custom was then in our parts), and say to each guest
in turn, "Your good health, Sir, or Madam," while we sipped a
little sweet wine and water, the ceremony was a torture to him;
while to me it was quite indifferent, and I was only running my
eye over the dishes, and thinking which I should choose when it
came to my turn. In looking over his earliest letters, I find
in one, written to his mother a few weeks after we first went
to school, this passage: "We are both very well and happy. I find
that I like Tom better at school than I do at home, and yet I
do not know the reason." I was surprised for a moment when I came
on this sentence. Of course, if love is genuine, the longer people
know each other, the deeper it becomes; and therefore our friendship,
like all others, grew richer and deeper as we got older. But this
was the first time I ever had an idea that his feelings towards
me changed after we went to school. I am not sure that I can give
the reason any more than he could; but, on thinking it over, I
daresay it had something to do with this difference I am speaking
of.</p>

<p>I remember an old yeoman, a playfellow of our father’s, who lived
in a grey gabled house of his own at the end of the village in
those days, and with whom we used to spend a good deal of our
spare time, saying to a lady, about her sons, "Bring ’em up sarcy
(saucy), Marm! I likes to see bwoys brought up sarcy." I have
no doubt that he, and others, used to cultivate my natural gift
of sauciness, and lead me on to give flippant answers, and talk
nonsense. In fact, I can quite remember occasions of the kind,
and George’s quiet steady look at them, as he thought, no doubt,
"What a fool my brother is making of himself, and what a shame
of you to encourage him!" Apart altogether from his shyness, he
had too much self-command and courtesy himself to run into any
danger of this kind.</p>

<p>Now, the moment we got to school, my sauciness abated very rapidly
on the one hand, and, on the other, I became much more consciously
beholden to him. We had scarcely been there a week when the first
crisis occurred which made us both aware of this fact. My form
had a lesson in early Greek History to get up, in which a part
of the information communicated was, that Cadmus was the first
man who "carried letters from Asia to Greece." When we came to
be examined, the master asked us, "What was Cadmus?" This way
of putting it puzzled us all for a moment or two, when suddenly
the words "carried letters" came into my head, and, remembering
the man with the leather bag who used to bring my father’s papers
and letters, and our marbles and whipcord, from Farringdon, I
shouted, "A postman, Sir." The master looked very angry for a
moment, but, seeing my perfect good faith, and that I had jumped
up expecting to go to the head of the form, he burst out laughing.
Of course all the boys joined in, and when school was over I was
christened Cadmus. That I probably should not have minded, but
it soon shortened into "Cad," at which all the blood in my eight-year-old
veins was on fire. The more angry I was, the more some of the
boys persecuted me with the hateful name; especially one stupid
big fellow of twelve or so, who ought to have been two forms higher,
and revenged himself for his place amongst us little ones by making
our small lives as miserable as he could. A day or two after,
with two or three boys for audience, he had got me in a corner
of the playground, into which he kept thrusting me violently back,
calling me "Cad, Cad," while I was ready to fly at his throat
and kill him. Suddenly we heard a step tearing down the gravel
walk, and George, in his shirt sleeves, fresh from a game of rounders,
rushed into the circle, and sent my tyrant staggering back with
a blow in the chest, and then faced him with clenched fists, and
a blaze in his eye, which I never saw there more than two or three
times. I don’t think many boys, or men, would have liked to face
him when it was there. At any rate my persecutor didn’t, though
he must have been a stone heavier, and much stronger. So he slunk
off, muttering to himself, to the disgust of the boys who hoped
for a row, and I strutted out of my corner, while George went
back to his rounders, after looking round and saying, "Just let
me hear any of you call my brother ‘Cad’ again." I don’t think
I ever heard <em>that</em> nickname again at our first school,
and it must have been very shortly after that he wrote home, "I
find I like Tom better at school than I do at home, and yet I
do not know the reason." The strongest and most generous natures
are always fondest of those who lean on them.</p>

<p>But I am getting on faster than I intended. We have not quite
got away from home yet. And now let me turn again to my story.
You will, I am sure, be interested by the following letter, which
was written to us by Miss Edgeworth. You probably have never read
her books; but in our day, when there were very few children’s
books, they were our great delight, and almost the only ones we
possessed, after "Robinson Crusoe," "The Pilgrim’s Progress,"
and "Sandford and Merton." I forget how we discovered that the
lady who wrote "Frank and Rosamond" was really alive, and that
our grandmother actually had met her, and knew her. But, having
made the discovery; we laid our heads together, and wrote two
letters, asking her to tell us what were the contents of the remaining
drawers in the wonderful Indian cabinet. Our grandmother sent
her the letters, and in due time we received the following reply:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>EDGEWORTH’S TOWN, </em><em>July 20th, 1828</em>.

</p>
<p>
"To my dear young readers, <em>GEORGE </em>and <em>THOMAS HUGHES</em>.

</p>
<p>
"I am glad that you can write as well as read; your two letters<br/>
were both very well written, and I had pleasure in reading<br/>
them. I am glad that you like Harry and Lucy and Frank and<br/>
Rosamond. I wish I could tell you anything more that would<br/>
entertain you about the other nine drawers of the India<br/>
cabinet; but what I am going to tell you will disappoint you<br/>
I daresay, and I cannot help it. When Rosamond opened the 4th<br/>
drawer she found in it—nothing—but a sheet of white paper at<br/>
the bottom of the drawer, and on the paper was written only the<br/>
word <em>China</em>. The writing was in a large round hand, like that<br/>
in which your letter to me was written. Rosamond shut this<br/>
drawer and opened the next, which was the 5th—empty! On the<br/>
paper at the bottom of this drawer, in the same handwriting,<br/>
was <em>Constantinople</em>. The 6th, the 7th, the 8th which she<br/>
opened, one after another as fast as she could, were all empty!<br/>
On the paper in the 6th drawer, which was very deep, was<br/>
written—<em>The North Pole and Iceland—Norway—Sweden and Lapland</em>.<br/>
In the 8th drawer was written <em>Rome and Naples—Mount Vesuvius<br/>
and Pompeii</em>. At the bottom of the 9th drawer, <em>Persia—Arabia<br/>
and India</em>.

</p>
<p>
"Then on the paper in the 9th drawer was written in small-hand<br/>
and cramped writing without lines, and as crookedly as might be<br/>
expected from a first attempt without lines, what follows:—

</p>
<p>
"‘I, little Matt, (which is short for Matthew), promise my<br/>
dear good kindest of all aunts, Aunt Egerton, whom I love best<br/>
in the world, that when I am grown up <em>quite</em> to be a great<br/>
man, and when I go upon my travels as I intend to do when I am<br/>
old enough and have money enough, I will bring her home all<br/>
the greatest curiosities I can find for her in every country<br/>
for these drawers. I have written in them the names of the<br/>
countries I intend to visit, therefore I beg my dear aunt will<br/>
never put anything in these 9 drawers till my curiosities<br/>
come home. I will unpack them myself. N. B.—I have begun this<br/>
morning to make a list from my book of travels and voyages of<br/>
all the curiosities I think worthy my bringing home for the<br/>
India cabinet.’ (M. E.—A true copy.)

</p>
<p>
"My dear young readers, this is all I know about the matter. I<br/>
am sorry I can tell you no more; but to no one else have I ever<br/>
told so much. This letter is all for yourselves—from one who<br/>
would like to see you very much, and who hopes that you would<br/>
like her too if you knew her, though you might not like her at<br/>
first sight; for she is neither young nor pretty, but an old<br/>
good-natured friend,

</p>
<p>
(Signed) "<em>MARIA EDGEWORTH</em>."

</p>

<p>In the winter, before we went to school first, we were left alone
at home, for the first time, while our parents paid some visits.
George was left in charge of the house (under the governess),
with injunctions to see that all things went on regularly in the
village. Our mother’s Saturday clothing club was to be held as
usual, and we were not to neglect either the poor, or the birds,
who were fed daily through the winter on a table on the lawn,
just outside the dining-room window. The following letter will
show you how conscientiously the trust was fulfilled:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"<em>January 21st, 1830.</em>

</p>
<p>
"<em>DEAR MAMA</em>,

</p>
<p>
"We are all well, and quite free from colds. All the people<br/>
brought their money correctly last Saturday. Tims had his<br/>
chimney began more than a week ago, and no doubt it is finished<br/>
by this time. I have told cook about making broth and gruel for<br/>
any who are sick. We constantly feed all your birds, and they<br/>
eat as much as would give baby two meals. We shall be glad to<br/>
see you and Papa.

</p>
<p>
"I am, your dutiful son,

</p>
<p>
"<em>GEORGE HUGHES</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>One other letter I will give to amuse you. You elder boys will
say, that if he hadn’t learnt to answer questions better when
he went to school, he would never have taken a high degree at
Oxford:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>January 26th, 1830.</em>

</p>
<p>
"MY <em>DEAR MAMA</em>,

</p>
<p>
"We thank you for the conundrums you sent us, and I think we<br/>
have found out two of them:—‘If all the letters were asked out<br/>
to dinner, which of them would not go?’ The one that asked them<br/>
would not go. ‘What thing is that which lights the eyes, yet<br/>
never fails to blind?’ The sun. You must tell us when you write<br/>
whether these are right or not. We cannot find out the other<br/>
one. Give my love to papa, and tell him that I will write to<br/>
him next week. We shall be delighted to see you home again. I<br/>
think I am going on well with my Latin, and I hope Papa will be<br/>
satisfied with me.

</p>
<p>
"I am, your affectionate son,

</p>
<p>
"<em>GEORGE HUGHES</em>."

</p>

<p>We went to school together, in the autumn of this year, at Twyford,
near Winchester. On the way there we stayed a few days at Lyndhurst,
in the New Forest, at the house of an old naval officer. He had
another house near us in Berkshire, our favourite resort, as there
were several little girls in the family of our own age, all very
pretty. One of these little ladies took a fancy to some water-flower,
as we were walking in the forest, the day before the school met.
Without saying a word, George just jumped into the pond, and fetched
it for her; thereby ruining a new suit of clothes (as your grandmother
remarked) and risking his life, for there was no one but a nurse
with us, and it was just as likely that the pond might be out
of his depth as not. However, as it happened, no harm came of
it, and we went on next day to Twyford.</p>
