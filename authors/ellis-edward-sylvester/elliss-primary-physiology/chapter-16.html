<p>Don't be afraid of the sun. Its rays give life and vigor not
only to men and animals, but to the vegetable world. A little
tanning or browning of the skin is good for you. In summer when
the rays are very strong, you should avoid them; but at other
times, live in the sunlight all you can.</p>

<p>Very rarely indeed is a child sunstruck; but it is wise to guard
against it, because it is often fatal. As I have just told you,
you must keep out of the direct rays of the sun when the day is
very hot. It is well to carry a wet handkerchief, or several large
green leaves in the crown of your hat.</p>

<p>
<em>SYMPTOMS OF SUNSTROKE</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>The symptoms of sunstroke are stinging pains in the head, dizziness,
weakness, confusion of sight, and in some cases, sickness at the
stomach. The person becomes partly or wholly insensible and often
moans or snores. Sometimes he has spasms.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
<em>HOW TO TREAT SUNSTROKE</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Should you ever see any one thus affected, do your utmost to
have him taken at once to the coolest place that is near at hand,
and where there is plenty of fresh air. The clothing should be
removed and the body sponged with cold water, if the surface is
warm; if it is cool, warm water should be used.</p>

<p>If the patient's body is very hot, his pulse high, he snores
or moans, and is limp and senseless, he should be laid upon his
face, his head slightly raised and cold water poured upon it for
several minutes, from a height of four or five feet.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>CAUTION</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>If the pulse is feeble and fast, the breathing light, and the
body cool, the treatment just named would be highly dangerous.
The patient must be given small doses of diluted brandy or whiskey,
and a blister applied to the back of the neck. Of course a physician
will be sent for at once.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>POISONS</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>It may happen that a child swallows by mistake some kind of poison
(when he is alone), and when a few minutes' delay in reaching
a physician will be fatal. The best and indeed the only thing
to do is to produce instant vomiting. Stir a tablespoonful of
salt or a teaspoonful of mustard in a tumbler of warm water and
swallow without a moment's delay.</p>

<p>At the end of five minutes, repeat the dose, and continue doing
so for half an hour. If vomiting does not take place immediately,
bring it on by thrusting the forefinger down the throat, since
vomiting alone will save your life.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>SULPHURIC ACID POISON</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>There is but one poison which cannot be thrown off by the means
just described. If water is drank directly after swallowing sulphuric
acid, it will be fatal. Vomiting must be induced by using the
finger.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
A <em>SAFE RULE</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>The only safe rule for children, as well as for grown persons,
is never to swallow or touch anything which they are not certain
can do them no harm. When there is the least doubt, leave it alone.</p>

<p>  What is said of sunlight? When should the rays be avoided?</p>

<p>  What should be carried in the crown of the hat when the sunlight
is   very strong?</p>

<p>  Describe the symptoms of sunstroke.</p>

<p>  What is the first thing to do when a person suffers sunstroke?  
Suppose the surface of the body is warm? Suppose it is cool?</p>

<p>  If the body is hot, pulse high, he snores, is limp, etc.?</p>

<p>  If the pulse is feeble and fast, breathing light, body cool?</p>

<p>  What course should be followed if poison is taken by mistake?  
Suppose the dose described does not cause vomiting?</p>

<p>  What of sulphuric acid?</p>

<p>  What is the only safe rule? </p>
