Adam Salton went for a walk before returning to Lesser Hill; he felt
that it might be well, not only to steady his nerves, shaken by the
horrible scene, but to get his thoughts into some sort of order, so
as to be ready to enter on the matter with Sir Nathaniel.  He was a
little embarrassed as to telling his uncle, for affairs had so
vastly progressed beyond his original view that he felt a little
doubtful as to what would be the old gentleman's attitude when he
should hear of the strange events for the first time.  Mr. Salton
would certainly not be satisfied at being treated as an outsider
with regard to such things, most of which had points of contact with
the inmates of his own house.  It was with an immense sense of
relief that Adam heard that his uncle had telegraphed to the
housekeeper that he was detained by business at Walsall, where he
would remain for the night; and that he would be back in the morning
in time for lunch.
<P>
When Adam got home after his walk, he found Sir Nathaniel just going
to bed.  He did not say anything to him then of what had happened,
but contented himself with arranging that they would walk together
in the early morning, as he had much to say that would require
serious attention.
<P>
Strangely enough he slept well, and awoke at dawn with his mind
clear and his nerves in their usual unshaken condition.  The maid
brought up, with his early morning cup of tea, a note which had been
found in the letter-box.  It was from Lady Arabella, and was
evidently intended to put him on his guard as to what he should say
about the previous evening.
<P>
He read it over carefully several times, before he was satisfied
that he had taken in its full import.
<P>
<P>
"DEAR MR. SALTON,
<P>
"I cannot go to bed until I have written to you, so you must forgive
me if I disturb you, and at an unseemly time.  Indeed, you must also
forgive me if, in trying to do what is right, I err in saying too
much or too little.  The fact is that I am quite upset and unnerved
by all that has happened in this terrible night.  I find it
difficult even to write; my hands shake so that they are not under
control, and I am trembling all over with memory of the horrors we
saw enacted before our eyes.  I am grieved beyond measure that I
should be, however remotely, a cause of this horror coming on you.
Forgive me if you can, and do not think too hardly of me.  This I
ask with confidence, for since we shared together the danger--the
very pangs--of death, I feel that we should be to one another
something more than mere friends, that I may lean on you and trust
you, assured that your sympathy and pity are for me.  You really
must let me thank you for the friendliness, the help, the
confidence, the real aid at a time of deadly danger and deadly fear
which you showed me.  That awful man--I shall see him for ever in my
dreams.  His black, malignant face will shut out all memory of
sunshine and happiness.  I shall eternally see his evil eyes as he
threw himself into that well-hole in a vain effort to escape from
the consequences of his own misdoing.  The more I think of it, the
more apparent it seems to me that he had premeditated the whole
thing--of course, except his own horrible death.
<P>
"Perhaps you have noticed a fur collar I occasionally wear.  It is
one of my most valued treasures--an ermine collar studded with
emeralds.  I had often seen the nigger's eyes gleam covetously when
he looked at it.  Unhappily, I wore it yesterday.  That may have
been the cause that lured the poor man to his doom.  On the very
brink of the abyss he tore the collar from my neck--that was the
last I saw of him.  When he sank into the hole, I was rushing to the
iron door, which I pulled behind me.  When I heard that soul-
sickening yell, which marked his disappearance in the chasm, I was
more glad than I can say that my eyes were spared the pain and
horror which my ears had to endure.
<P>
"When I tore myself out of the negro's grasp as he sank into the
well-hole; I realised what freedom meant.  Freedom!  Freedom!  Not
only from that noisome prison-house, which has now such a memory,
but from the more noisome embrace of that hideous monster.  Whilst I
live, I shall always thank you for my freedom.  A woman must
sometimes express her gratitude; otherwise it becomes too great to
bear.  I am not a sentimental girl, who merely likes to thank a man;
I am a woman who knows all, of bad as well as good, that life can
give.  I have known what it is to love and to lose.  But you must
not let me bring any unhappiness into your life.  I must live on--as
I have lived--alone, and, in addition, bear with other woes the
memory of this latest insult and horror.  In the meantime, I must
get away as quickly as possible from Diana's Grove.  In the morning
I shall go up to town, where I shall remain for a week--I cannot
stay longer, as business affairs demand my presence here.  I think,
however, that a week in the rush of busy London, surrounded with
multitudes of commonplace people, will help to soften--I cannot
expect total obliteration--the terrible images of the bygone night.
When I can sleep easily--which will be, I hope, after a day or two--
I shall be fit to return home and take up again the burden which
will, I suppose, always be with me.
<P>
"I shall be most happy to see you on my return--or earlier, if my
good fortune sends you on any errand to London.  I shall stay at the
Mayfair Hotel.  In that busy spot we may forget some of the dangers
and horrors we have shared together.  Adieu, and thank you, again
and again, for all your kindness and consideration to me.
<P>
"ARABELLA MARSH."
<P>
<P>
Adam was surprised by this effusive epistle, but he determined to
say nothing of it to Sir Nathaniel until he should have thought it
well over.  When Adam met Sir Nathaniel at breakfast, he was glad
that he had taken time to turn things over in his mind.  The result
had been that not only was he familiar with the facts in all their
bearings, but he had already so far differentiated them that he was
able to arrange them in his own mind according to their values.
Breakfast had been a silent function, so it did not interfere in any
way with the process of thought.
<P>
So soon as the door was closed, Sir Nathaniel began:
<P>
"I see, Adam, that something has occurred, and that you have much to
tell me."
<P>
"That is so, sir.  I suppose I had better begin by telling you all I
know--all that has happened since I left you yesterday?"
<P>
Accordingly Adam gave him details of all that had happened during
the previous evening.  He confined himself rigidly to the narration
of circumstances, taking care not to colour events by any comment of
his own, or any opinion of the meaning of things which he did not
fully understand.  At first, Sir Nathaniel seemed disposed to ask
questions, but shortly gave this up when he recognised that the
narration was concise and self-explanatory.  Thenceforth, he
contented himself with quick looks and glances, easily interpreted,
or by some acquiescent motions of his hands, when such could be
convenient, to emphasise his idea of the correctness of any
inference.  Until Adam ceased speaking, having evidently come to an
end of what he had to say with regard to this section of his story,
the elder man made no comment whatever.  Even when Adam took from
his pocket Lady Arabella's letter, with the manifest intention of
reading it, he did not make any comment.  Finally, when Adam folded
up the letter and put it, in its envelope, back in his pocket, as an
intimation that he had now quite finished, the old diplomatist
carefully made a few notes in his pocket-book.
<P>
"Your narrative, my dear Adam, is altogether admirable.  I think I
may now take it that we are both well versed in the actual facts,
and that our conference had better take the shape of a mutual
exchange of ideas.  Let us both ask questions as they may arise; and
I do not doubt that we shall arrive at some enlightening
conclusions."
<P>
"Will you kindly begin, sir?  I do not doubt that, with your longer
experience, you will be able to dissipate some of the fog which
envelops certain of the things which we have to consider."
<P>
"I hope so, my dear boy.  For a beginning, then, let me say that
Lady Arabella's letter makes clear some things which she intended--
and also some things which she did not intend.  But, before I begin
to draw deductions, let me ask you a few questions.  Adam, are you
heart-whole, quite heart-whole, in the matter of Lady Arabella?"
<P>
His companion answered at once, each looking the other straight in
the eyes during question and answer.
<P>
"Lady Arabella, sir, is a charming woman, and I should have deemed
it a privilege to meet her--to talk to her--even--since I am in the
confessional--to flirt a little with her.  But if you mean to ask if
my affections are in any way engaged, I can emphatically answer
'No!'--as indeed you will understand when presently I give you the
reason.  Apart from that, there are the unpleasant details we
discussed the other day."
<P>
"Could you--would you mind giving me the reason now?  It will help
us to understand what is before us, in the way of difficulty."
<P>
"Certainly, sir.  My reason, on which I can fully depend, is that I
love another woman!"
<P>
"That clinches it.  May I offer my good wishes, and, I hope, my
congratulations?"
<P>
"I am proud of your good wishes, sir, and I thank you for them.  But
it is too soon for congratulations--the lady does not even know my
hopes yet.  Indeed, I hardly knew them myself, as definite, till
this moment."
<P>
"I take it then, Adam, that at the right time I may be allowed to
know who the lady is?"
<P>
Adam laughed a low, sweet laugh, such as ripples from a happy heart.
<P>
"There need not be an hour's, a minute's delay.  I shall be glad to
share my secret with you, sir.  The lady, sir, whom I am so happy as
to love, and in whom my dreams of life-long happiness are centred,
is Mimi Watford!"
<P>
"Then, my dear Adam, I need not wait to offer congratulations.  She
is indeed a very charming young lady.  I do not think I ever saw a
girl who united in such perfection the qualities of strength of
character and sweetness of disposition.  With all my heart, I
congratulate you.  Then I may take it that my question as to your
heart-wholeness is answered in the affirmative?"
<P>
"Yes; and now, sir, may I ask in turn why the question?"
<P>
"Certainly!  I asked because it seems to me that we are coming to a
point where my questions might be painful to you."
<P>
"It is not merely that I love Mimi, but I have reason to look on
Lady Arabella as her enemy," Adam continued.
<P>
"Her enemy?"
<P>
"Yes.  A rank and unscrupulous enemy who is bent on her
destruction."
<P>
Sir Nathaniel went to the door, looked outside it and returned,
locking it carefully behind him.
