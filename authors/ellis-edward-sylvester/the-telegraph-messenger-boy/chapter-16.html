<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>When the father of Rutherford Richmond's friend, at whose house
the young Bostonian was visiting, learned the facts, he was indignant
beyond description. He declared that Ben Mayberry had served the
young scapegraces right, except he ought to have punished both
more severely, which was rather severe, as was shown by the blackened
eyes and bruised faces.</p>

<p>Ben declined to push the matter on the morrow, as the boys had
been punished, and he had proved he was able to take care of himself,
as against them, at any time. But the gentleman insisted that
he would not permit the matter to drop, unless his son and Rutherford
agreed to go to the telegraph office and beg the pardon of the
boy whom he learned they had insulted under Mr. Grandin's roof.
Rutherford and his friend consented, and they humiliated themselves
to that extent. The succeeding day Rutherford went home to Boston,
and did not reappear in Damietta until long afterward, when he
hoped the disgraceful episode was forgotten.</p>

<p>On the following week Dolly Willard returned to New York, and
Ben, for the first time in his life, began to feel as though his
native city had lost a good deal of the sunshine to which it was
entitled.</p>

<p>"She will visit Damietta again," he said to himself, with just
the faintest sigh, "and she promised to write me; I hope she won't
forget her promise."</p>

<p>And, indeed, the sprightly little miss did not lose sight of
her pledge. It may be suspected that she took as much pleasure
in expressing on paper her warm friendship for Ben, as he did
in reading the pure, honest sentiments, and in answering her missives,
which he did with great promptness.</p>

<p>It was just one week after the memorable night of the party,
while I was sitting at my desk, that the following cipher dispatch
came over the wires, addressed to G. R. Burkhill, Moorestown:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Fwfszuijoh hr pl nm ujnf Sgtqdezw bu bnqmdq. Tom."

</p>
</div>
<p>I passed the message to Ben, whose eyes sparkled as he took it
in hand. It required but a few minutes for him to translate it
by the method which has already been made known, and the following
rather startling words came to light:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Everything is O. K. On time Thursday at corner."

</p>
</div>
<p>This unquestionably referred to the same unlawful project outlined
in the former dispatches. Mr. Burkhill had not been in the office
for months. As yet, of the three telegrams sent him, he had not
received one. The first was lost in the river, the second had
been on file more than half a year, and we now had the third.</p>

<p>But the latter did not lie uncalled for even for an hour. Remembering
the instruction received from the manager, I took a copy of the
message, with the translation written out by Ben, to the office
of the mayor, where I laid the facts before him. This was on Wednesday,
and the contemplated robbery was fixed for the following night.
By his direction I sent a dispatch at once to the address of the
detective in New York, who, it had been arranged, was to look
after the matter.</p>

<p>The reply to this message was the rather surprising information
that Detective Maxx had been in Damietta several days, and knew
of the contemplated robbery. He was shadowing the suspected party,
and if he deemed it necessary, he would call on the mayor for
assistance.</p>

<p>While I was absent from the office, who should walk in but Mr.
G. R. Burkhill. He greeted Ben with much effusion, shaking him
warmly by the hand, inquiring how he got along, and telling him
that his niece sent her special regards to him.</p>

<p>"I have been on a trip to New Orleans," he added, "or I would
have been down in Damietta sooner, for I like the place."</p>

<p>"The summer isn't generally considered a good time to go so far
south," ventured Ben.</p>

<p>"That is true, as relates to Northerners, but I was born in the
Crescent City, and have no fear of Yellow Jack; fact is, I have
had the confounded disease myself. By the way, have you a message
for me?"</p>

<p>"We have two, in fact I may say three, for the copy of the first
one that went down the river with me has never been handed you,
and one came a day or two after you left."</p>

<p>"I know what they are, so you needn't mind about them. I will
take the last, if you please."</p>

<p>"It arrived within the last half hour," explained Ben, as he
handed the damp sheet to him.</p>

<p>The boy watched his countenance while Burkhill was reading it.
It took several minutes for him to study out its meaning, but
he did so without the aid of pencil or paper. A strange glitter
came into his gray eyes as the meaning broke upon him, and he
muttered something to himself which the lad did not quite catch.</p>

<p>Then he turned to the desk, and was engaged only a minute or
two when he handed a return message to Ben, paying for it as the
man had done who forwarded the other to him. It was this:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"Uibu rthsr fybdumz Vhkk cf qdzex.

</p>
<p>
"G. R. Burkhill."

</p>
</div>
<p>Applying his rule (which compelled him to go to the end of the
alphabet, when, for instance, the letter "a" demanded to be represented
by a preceding letter), Ben Mayberry very readily translated the
cipher as follows:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"That suits exactly. Will be ready.

</p>
<p>
"G. R. Burkhill."
