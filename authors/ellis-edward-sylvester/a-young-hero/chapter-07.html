<p>"I'll show you how it works," he called out, with a grin, and
without a word of warning he whirled it about the legs and bodies
of the boys, who jumped with pain and started to run.</p>

<p>He followed them just as the teacher did before, delivering blows
rapidly, every one of which fairly burned and blistered where
it struck. Bud laughed and enjoyed it, because he was inflicting
suffering, and he would have caused serious injury had not one
of the men shouted to him to stop.</p>

<p>Bud obeyed, catching the end of the lash in the hand which held
the whipstock, and slouching back to his position, said:</p>

<p>"They wanted me to give 'em free tickets, and 'cause I wouldn't
they told me they were going to crawl under the tent; so I thought
I would let 'em have a little taste beforehand."</p>

<p>"You mustn't be quite so ready," said the man; "some time you
will get into trouble."</p>

<p>"It wan't be the first time," said Bud, looking with a grin at
the poor boys, all three of whom were crying with pain; "and I
reckon I can get out ag'in, as I've done often enough."</p>

<p>Fred Sheldon, after edging away from the other lads and his friends,
all of whom were pitying him, recalled that he had come into the
village of Tottenville to see the constable, Archie Jackson, and
to tell him about the robbery that had been committed at the residence
of the Misses Perkinpine the preceding evening.</p>

<p>Archie, a short, bustling, somewhat pompous man, who turned in
his toes when he walked, was found among the crowd that were admiring
the circus and menagerie, and was soon made acquainted with the
alarming occurrence.</p>

<p>"Just what might have been expected," he said, severely, when
he had heard the particulars; "it was some of them circus people,
you can make up your mind to that. There's always an ugly crowd
going along with 'em, and sometimes a little ahead. It's been
some of 'em, I'm sure; very well, very well, I'll go right out
and investigate."</p>

<p>He told Fred it was necessary he should go along with him, and
the boy did so, being informed that he would be permitted to attend
the show in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The fussy constable made the investigation, assisted by the sisters,
who had become much calmer, and by Fred, who, it will be understood,
was an important witness.</p>

<p>The officer went through and through the house, examining the
floor and chairs and windows and furniture for marks that might
help him in ferreting out the guilty parties. He looked very wise,
and, when he was done, said he had his own theory, and he was
more convinced than ever that the two burglars were attach√©s of
Bandman's menagerie and circus.</p>

<p>"Purely as a matter of business," said he, "I'll attend the performances
this afternoon and evening; I don't believe in circuses, but an
officer of the law must sometimes go where his inclination doesn't
lead him. Wouldn't you ladies like to attend the show?"</p>

<p>The sisters were quite shocked at the invitation, and said that
nothing could induce them to go to such an exhibition, when they
never attended one in all their lives.</p>

<p>"In the meantime," added the bustling officer, "I suggest that
you offer a reward for the recovery of the goods."</p>

<p>"The suggestion is a good one," said Aunt Annie, "for I do not
believe we shall ever get back the silverware unless we make it
an inducement for everybody to hunt for it."</p>

<p>After some further words it was agreed that the constable should
have a hundred posters printed, offering a reward for the recovery
of the stolen property, nothing being said about the capture and
conviction of the thieves.</p>

<p>Nor would the conscientious ladies consent to make any offer
that could be accepted by the thieves themselves, by which they
could claim protection against prosecution.</p>

<p>They would rather bear their irreparable loss than consent to
compound crime.</p>

<p>"I know Mr. Carter, a very skillful detective in New York," said
Archie Jackson, as he prepared to go, "and I will send for him.
He's the sharpest man I ever saw, and if the property can be found,
he's the one to do it."</p>

<p>The confidence of the officer gave the ladies much hope, and
they resumed their duties in their household, as they had done
so many times for years past.</p>

<p>As the afternoon approached, the crowds began streaming into
Tottenville, and the sight was a stirring one, with the band of
music inside, the shouts of the peddlers on the outside, and the
general confusion and expectancy on the part of all.</p>

<p>The doors were open early, for, as is always the case, the multitude
were ahead of time, and were clamoring for admission.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, the boys were among the earliest, and the
little fellows who had suffered at the hands of the cruel Bud
Heyland forgot all their miseries in the delight of the entertainment.</p>

<p>On this special occasion Fred had rolled down his trousers and
wore a pair of shoes, although most of his playmates preferred
no covering at all for their brown, expanding feet.</p>

<p>The "performance," as the circus portion was called, did not
begin until two o'clock, so that more than an hour was at the
disposal of the visitors in which to inspect the animals.</p>

<p>These were found to be much less awe-inspiring than they were
pictured on the flaming posters and on the sides of their cages.
The hippopotamus, which was represented as crushing a large boat,
containing several men, in his jaws, was taken for a small, queer-looking
pig, as it was partly seen in the tank, while the grizzly bear,
the "Monarch of the Western Wilds," who had slain any number of
men before capture, did not look any more formidable than a common
dog.</p>

<p>The chief interest of Fred and two or three of his young friends
centered around the cage containing the Numidian lion. He was
of pretty fair size, looked very fierce, and strode majestically
back and forth in his narrow quarters, now and then giving vent
to a cavernous growl, which, although not very pleasant to hear,
was not so appalling by any means as some travelers declare it
to be.</p>

<p>Most of the boys soon went to the cage of monkeys, whose funny
antics kept them in a continual roar; but Fred and Joe Hunt, who
were about the same age, seemed never to tire of watching the
king of beasts.</p>

<p>"Come, move on there; you've been gaping long enough, and it's
time other folks had a chance."</p>

<p>It was Bud Heyland, who had yielded his position on the outside
for a few minutes to one of the men, and had come in to look around.
He raised his whip in a threatening manner, but did not let it
descend.</p>

<p>"I'm not in anybody's way," replied the indignant Fred, "and
I'll stand here as long as I want to."</p>

<p>"You will, eh? I'll show you!"</p>

<p>This time the bully drew back his whip with the intention of
striking, but before he could do so Archie Jackson, standing near,
called out:</p>

<p>"You touch him if you dare!"</p>

<p>Bud turned toward the constable, who stood at his elbow, with
flashing eyes, and demanded:</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"That boy isn't doing any harm, and if you touch him I'll take
you by the collar and lock you up where you'll stay a while after
this miserable show has gone."</p>

<p>Bud knew the officer and held him in more fear than any one else
in the community, but he growled:</p>

<p>"This boy crawled under the tent, and he's no business in here."</p>

<p>"That's a falsehood, for I saw him buy his ticket. Come now,
young man, I <em>know something about last night's nefarious proceedings</em>."</p>

<p>It would be hard to describe the significance with which these
words were spoken, but it may be said that no one could have made
them more impressive than did the fiery constable, who said them
over a second time, and then, shaking his head very knowingly,
walked away.</p>

<p>It may have been that Bud Heyland was such a bad boy that his
conscience accused him at all times, but Fred Sheldon was certain
he saw the red face grow more crimson under the words of the hot-tempered
constable.</p>

<p>"Can it be Bud knows anything about last night?" Fred asked himself,
attentively watching the movements of Bud, who affected to be
interested in something going on a rod or two distant.</p>

<p>He walked rapidly thither, but was gone only a short while when
he came back scowling at Fred, who looked at him in an inquiring
way.</p>

<p>"What are you staring at me so for?" asked Bud, half raising
his hand as if he wanted to strike, but was afraid to do so.</p>

<p>Fred now did something which bordered on insolence, though the
party of the other part deserved no consideration therefor. The
little fellow looked steadily in the red, inflamed face, and with
that peculiar grin that means so much in a boy, said in a low,
confidential voice:</p>

<p>"Bud, how about last night?"</p>

<p>Young Sheldon had no warrant to assume that Bud Heyland knew
anything of the robbery, and he was only following up the hint
given by Archie Jackson himself.</p>

<p>This may have been the reason that Fred fancied he could detect
a resemblance&mdash;very slight though it was&mdash;between the voice of
Bud Heyland and that of the tramp who sat at the table in the
old brick house, and who, beyond question, had a false beard on.</p>

<p>The young man with the whip in his hand simply looked back at
the handsome countenance before him, and without any appearance
of emotion, asked in turn:</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>Fred continued to look and smile, until suddenly Bud lost all
self-command and whirled his whip over his head.</p>

<p>As he did so, the lash flew through the bars of the cage and
struck the Numidian lion a sharp, stinging blow on the nose.</p>

<p>He gave a growl of anger, and half-rearing on his hind feet,
made a furious clawing and clutching with both paws. The end of
the lash seemed to have hit him in the eye, for he was furious
for a minute.</p>

<p>Bud Heyland knew what the sounds behind him meant, and instead
of striking the young lad whom he detested so much, he turned
about in the hope of soothing the enraged lion.</p>

<p>He spoke kindly to the beast, and failing to produce any effect,
was about to call one of the men to bring some meat, but at that
instant every one near at hand was startled by a crashing, grinding
sound, and the cage was seen to sway as if on the point of turning
over.</p>

<p>Then, before any one could comprehend fully what had occurred,
a huge form was seen to bound through the air in front of the
cage, landing directly among the terrified group, who stood spell-bound,
scarcely realizing their fearful peril.</p>

<p>"The lion is loose! the lion is loose!" was the next cry that
rang through the enclosure.</p>

group." &mdash;(See page 71.)]</p>
