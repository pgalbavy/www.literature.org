Blacky is a dreamer!<br/>
Blacky is a schemer!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is strong;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When things go wrong<br/>
Blacky is a screamer!

</p>
</div>
<p>It's a fact. Blacky the Crow is forever dreaming and scheming
and almost always it is of mischief. He is one of the smartest
and cleverest of all the little people of the Green Meadows and
the Green Forest, and all the others know it. Blacky likes excitement.
He wants something going on. The more exciting it is, the better
he likes it. Then he has a chance to use that harsh voice of his,
and how he does use it!</p>

<p>So now, as he sat in the top of the Big Hickory-tree beside the
Smiling Pool and looked down on all the little people gathered
there, he was very happy. In the first place he felt very important,
and you know Blacky dearly loves to feel important. They had all
come at his invitation to listen to a plan for seeing for themselves
if it were really true that Farmer Brown's boy was afraid of Buster
Bear.</p>

<p>On the Big Rock in the Smiling Pool sat Little Joe Otter, Billy
Mink, and Jerry Muskrat. On his big, green lily-pad sat Grandfather
Frog. On another lily-pad sat Spotty the Turtle. On the bank on
one side of the Smiling Pool were Peter Rabbit, Jumper the Hare,
Danny Meadow Mouse, Johnny Chuck, Jimmy Skunk, Unc' Billy Possum,
Striped Chipmunk and Old Mr. Toad. On the other side of the Smiling
Pool were Reddy Fox, Digger the Badger, and Bobby Coon. In the
Big Hickory-tree were Chatterer the Red Squirrel, Happy Jack the
Gray Squirrel, and Sammy Jay.</p>

<p>Blacky waited until he was sure that no one else was coming.
Then he cleared his throat very loudly and began to speak. "Friends,"
said he.</p>

<p>Everybody grinned, for Blacky has played so many sharp tricks
that no one is really his friend unless it is that other mischief-maker,
Sammy Jay, who, you know, is Blacky's cousin. But no one said
anything, and Blacky went on.</p>

<p>"Little Joe Otter has told us how he saw Farmer Brown's boy hurry
home when he found the footprint of Buster Bear on the edge of
the Laughing Brook, and how all the way he kept looking behind
him, as if he were afraid. Perhaps he was, and then again perhaps
he wasn't. Perhaps he had something else on his mind. You have
made a hero of Buster Bear, because you believe Little Joe's story.
Now I don't say that I don't believe it, but I do say that I will
be a lot more sure that Farmer Brown's boy is afraid of Buster
when I see him run away myself. Now here is my plan:</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning, very early, Sammy Jay and I will make a great
fuss near the edge of the Green Forest. Farmer Brown's boy has
a lot of curiosity, and he will be sure to come over to see what
it is all about. Then we will lead him to where Buster Bear is.
If he runs away, I will be the first to admit that Buster Bear
is as great a hero as some of you seem to think he is. It is a
very simple plan, and if you will all hide where you can watch,
you will be able to see for yourselves if Little Joe Otter is
right. Now what do you say?"</p>

<p>Right away everybody began to talk at the same time. It was such
a simple plan that everybody agreed to it. And it promised to
be so exciting that everybody promised to be there, that is, everybody
but Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle, who didn't care to
go so far away from the Smiling Pool. So it was agreed that Blacky
should try his plan the very next morning.</p>
