<p>Graylock looked at Drene’s heavily sagging pocket and knew what
was in it. A sudden sweat chilled his temples, but he said steadily
enough:</p>

<p>"I’d like to say a word or two&mdash;if you’ll give me time." And,
as Drene made no reply;&mdash;"You’re quite right: This business of
ours should be finished one way or another. I can’t stand it any
longer."</p>

<p>"In that case," remarked Drene with an evil stare at him, "I
may postpone it&mdash;to find out how much you can stand." He dropped
his right hand into the sagging pocket, looking intently at Graylock
all the while:</p>

<p>"What do you want here anyway?"</p>

<p>"I fancy that you have already guessed."</p>

<p>"Maybe. All the same, what do you want?"&mdash;fumbling with his bulging
pocket for a moment and then remaining motionless.</p>

<p>Graylock’s worn eyes rested on the outline of the shrouded weapon:
he stood eyeing it absently for a moment, then seated himself
on the sofa, his heavy eyes shifting from one object to another.</p>

<p>But there were few objects to be seen in that silent place;&mdash;a
star overhead glimmering through the high expanse of glass above;&mdash;otherwise
gray monotony of wall, a clay shape or two swathed in wet clothes,
a narrow ring of lamp light, and formless shadow.</p>

<p>"It’s a long time, Drene."</p>

<p>Drene mused in silence, now and then watching the other obliquely.</p>

<p>Presently he withdrew his right hand from his coat pocket, pulled
an armchair toward him and seated himself.</p>

<p>"It’s many years," repeated Graylock. "I expected you to do something
before this."</p>

<p>"Were you uneasy?" sneered Drene. Then he shrugged, knowing that
Graylock was no coward, sorry he had intimated as much, like a
man who deals a premature and useless blow.</p>

<p>He sat brooding for a while, his lean dangerous head lowered
sideways as though listening; his oblique glance always covering
Graylock.</p>

<p>"I suppose you’ll be surprised when I tell you one reason that
I came here," said Graylock.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose you can still surprise me by anything you may
say or do?"</p>

<p>The man remained silent, sitting with his hands tightly clasped
on his knees.</p>

<p>"Drene," he said, in a low voice, "don’t strike at me through
this young girl."</p>

<p>Drene began to laugh, unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"Are you in love with her?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... You know it."</p>

<p>Drene said, still laughing: "It’s the common rumor. You may imagine
it amuses your friends&mdash;if you have any left."</p>

<p>Graylock spoke in a voice that had a ghostly sound in the great
room:</p>

<p>"Don’t harm her, Drene. It is not necessary. I shall never see
her again&mdash;if that will content you."</p>

<p>Drene laughed: "I never saw my wife again. Did that help me?
I never saw her again, but as long as she lived I knew what she
was ... My wife. And when she died, still my wife. There was no
relief&mdash;no relief."</p>

<p>Graylock, deathly white, framed his haggard face between his
hands and stared at nothing:</p>

<p>"I know," he said. "I understand now. I am here to-night to pay
the reckoning."</p>

<p>"You can’t pay it."</p>

<p>"No, not the whole score. There’s another bill, I suppose, waiting
for me&mdash;somewhere. But I can settle my indebtedness to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"That’s up to you, Drene."</p>

<p>"How?" repeated Drene, violently.</p>

<p>Graylock made a slight gesture with his head toward Drene’s sagging
pocket: "That way if you like. Or," he added, "There is a harder
punishment."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"To give her up."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Drene, "that is harder. But I can make it even harder
than that. I can make it as hard for you as you made it for me.
I can let you live through it."</p>

<p>He laughed, fisted in his pocket, drew out the lumpy automatic
and leisurely pushed the lever to "safe."</p>

<p>He said: "To kill you would be like opening the cell door for
a lifer. You know what you are while you’re alive; maybe you’d
forget if you were dead. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>He ceased, fiddling absently with the dull-colored weapon on
his knee; and for a while they remained silent, not looking at
each other. And when Drene spoke again he was still intent upon
the automatic.</p>

<p>"If I knew what happens after a man dies I could act intelligently."
He shot an ugly look at Graylock: "I don’t know about you, either.
You’re a rat. But you might fool me at that. You might be repentant.
And in that case you’d get away&mdash;if it’s true that the eleventh
hour is not too late.... If it’s true that Christ is merciful....
So I’ll take no chances of a getaway. You might fool me&mdash;one way
or another&mdash;if you were dead."</p>

<p>Graylock lifted his head from his hands: "I don’t know how much
of the other debt I’ve already paid, Drene. But I’ve paid heavily
since I knew her&mdash;if that is any satisfaction to you. And since
I knew she cared for you, and when I realized that you meant to
strike me through her &mdash;I have paid, heavily.... Yet, if
you were honestly in love with her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that any of your damned business?"</p>

<p>"She’s only a child&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You rat! That’s what’s coming to you!"</p>

<p>"If you say so. But what is coming to her, Drene?"</p>

<p>"Continue to guess. But I know you. It’s yourself you’re sorry
for and what you’ll have to endure&mdash;live through. That’s what
you can’t stand, and remain the sleek, self-satisfied rat you
are. No, it will make earth a living hell for you; never a second,
day or night, will you be able to forget&mdash;if you really do love
her.... And I believe you do &mdash;I don’t understand how a thing
like you can love&mdash;but it seems it can."</p>

<p>After a silence Graylock said: "You don’t care if you damn yourself?"</p>

<p>"It’s worth it to me."</p>

<p>"Are you willing that I should know you are as great a blackguard
as I am?" Drene’s gaunt features reddened and he set his jaws
in silence.</p>

<p>"Don’t you care what you do to her?" asked Graylock, unsteadily.
"It’s a viler business than that for which you are punishing me."</p>

<p>For a long time Drene sat there looking down at the weapon on
his knees. And after a while, the other man spoke huskily: "It’s
bad enough either way for me, Drene. I’ll do what you wish in
the matter. I’ll leave the country; I’ll stay; whichever you say.
Or," he said with a ghastly smile, "I’ll clean out that automatic
for you to-night&mdash;if you’ll marry her."</p>

<p>Drene looked up, slowly:</p>

<p>"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"I said that I’d clean out your automatic for you&mdash;to-night&mdash;if
you wish.... It can be an accident or not, just as you say."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In my own rooms&mdash;if it is to be an accident."</p>

<p>"Do you offer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; if you’ll marry her afterwards. If you say you will I’ll
take your word."</p>

<p>"And then you’ll be out of your misery, you damned coward!"</p>

<p>"God knows.... But I think not," said Graylock, under his breath.</p>

<p>Drene twisted the automatic, rose and continued to twirl it,
considering. Presently he began to pace the floor, no longer noticing
the other man. Once his promenade brought him up facing the wall
where a calendar hung.</p>

<p>He stood for a while looking at it absently. After a few moments
he stepped nearer, detached the sheet for the present month, then
one by one tore off the remaining sheets until he came to the
month marked December, Graylock watching him all the while.</p>

<p>"I think it happened on Christmas," remarked Drene turning toward
the other and laying a finger on the number 25 printed in red.</p>

<p>Graylock’s head bent slightly.</p>

<p>"Very well. Suppose about eleven o’clock on Christmas night you
give your automatic a thorough cleaning.</p>

<p>"If you say so."</p>

<p>"You have one?"</p>

<p>"I shall buy one."</p>

<p>"Didn’t you come here armed?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Drene looked at him very intently. But Graylock had never been
a liar. After a few moments he went over to his desk, replaced
the weapon under the papers, and, still busy, said over his shoulder:</p>

<p>"All right. You can go."</p>
