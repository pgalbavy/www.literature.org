<p>Bending as closely to the floor of the cabin as he could, the
Texan advanced until directly in front of the crackling fire,
when he reached up with his Winchester, which was grasped near
the muzzle. By this means he placed the stock directly beneath
the two weapons resting on the deer antlers.</p>

<p>With a deftness that would hardly have been expected, he raised
both guns until their stocks were lifted clear off their support,
when he began gently lowering them, so as to bring them within
his reach. He might have flirted them free by a single quick movement
and let them fall upon the floor; but he wished to avoid this,
since he ran the risk of injuring them.</p>

<p>None knew better than Avon Burnet the great danger of this apparently
simple act on the part of his uncle. The chances were so immeasurably
in favor of his discovery that he was certain it would take place.
While the wife and servant held their breath in a torture of suspense,
the youth, with his cocked rifle firmly grasped, stole softly
along the side of the cabin until close to the door. In reaching
the spot, he stooped so as to move beyond the first opening, the
proceeding placing him between the windows, with his left elbow
against the heavy door.</p>

<p>In this situation his nerves were at the highest tension. Everything
was in plain sight, but he was listening intently to the movements
of his enemies. He heard the sounds of the mustangs' hoofs, as
they circled swiftly about the cabin, sometimes turning quickly
upon themselves, and at varying distances from the structure.
Now and then one or two of the horsemen would rein up abruptly,
as if striving to peer through the openings, or about to apply
for admission.</p>

<p>It may seem incredible, but there is no reason to doubt the fact
that, at the moment Captain Shirril began cautiously reaching
upward with his weapon, the youth heard one of the Comanches slip
down from the back of his mustang and approach the door. His hand
moved softly over the rough surface, as though searching for the
latch string, which was generally hanging out; and, finding it
not, he began stealing to the window just beyond.</p>

<p>This was the very thing Avon dreaded above all others, for it
was inevitable that he should detect the figure of the Texan operating
so guardedly in front of the fire.</p>

<p>Such proved to be the fact. Whether the youth actually observed
the action of the Indian, or whether he fancied he heard him moving
along the side of the house, cannot be said with certainty; but
a faint rustle in front of the shattered glass made known that
the dusky miscreant was there, and had detected the stratagem
of the Texan, who at that moment was in the act of lowering the
gun from the deer's prongs over the mantel.</p>

<p>His uncle was so clearly in his field of vision that, without
looking at him, Avon did not miss the slightest movement, but
his whole attention was fixed on the window, and it was well it
was so.</p>

<p>"Look! look! Avon, do you see that?"</p>

<p>It was his aunt who uttered the terrified question with a gasp,
as she pointed at the narrow opening.</p>

<p>The youth had observed the object which appalled the lady; the
muzzle of a gun was slowly gliding through the window.</p>

<p>Captain Shirril had been discovered, and the Comanche was fixing
his weapon in position to fire a fatal shot. He might have stood
back a couple of paces and discharged it without revealing his
presence, but a better aim could be secured by thrusting a few
inches of the barrel into the room.</p>

<p>At the instant the dark muzzle showed itself and the gleam of
the firelight was reflected from it, Avon leaned his own rifle
against the door at his side, quickly drew his revolver from the
holster at his hip, sprang forward like a cat, and seizing the
muzzle of the gun threw it upward toward the ceiling.</p>

<p>It was done in the nick of time, for the Comanche pressed the
trigger just then, and the bullet which, had Avon's action been
delayed a single moment, would have killed Captain Shirril, was
buried in the timbers overhead.</p>

<p>The daring act brought the youth directly in front of the window,
where for the instant he was exposed to any shot from the outside.</p>

<p>As he made the leap he saw the face of the warrior, agleam with
paint and distorted with passion, but slightly flustered by the
unaccountable occurrence. Before he could recover, and at the
same instant, Avon darted his revolver through the shattered window
pane and let fly with two chambers in quick succession. An ear-splitting
screech and a heavy fall left little doubt of the success of the
daring act. The Comanche had not only been hit, but hit hard.</p>

<p>Although startled by the noise and flurry, Captain Shirril was
too much of a veteran to be taken at fault. His big right hand
closed around the two weapons for which he had run all this risk,
and partly straightening up, he bounded to the rear of the little
room with three rifles secure in his grasp, and with not a hair
of his head harmed.</p>

<p>Avon was as much on the alert as he, and reached the shelter
at the same moment.</p>

<p>"It was confoundedly more risky than I supposed," remarked the
captain, with a smile and a shake of his head, "but all's well
that ends well; I guess you dropped him, my boy."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder, for I couldn't have had a better chance,"
was the modest reply of the youth.</p>

<p>"It was one of the neatest things I ever saw, and I'm proud of
you," exclaimed his relative, slapping him affectionately on the
shoulder. "I said you would count as a full hand on the trip to
Kansas, but at this rate you'll add up double."</p>

<p>Avon blushed as he used to do in school, when his teacher praised
him for excellent lessons, and made no answer, but the eyes of
his aunt kindled with love for the brave fellow who, by his readiness
of resource, had saved her husband's life. Even Dinah, with whom
he had always been a favorite, added an expression of affection
for the boy who had done so well.</p>

<p>There were now two men and two women within the Texan's cabin,
and each held a trusty weapon, while there was plenty of ammunition
for all. It might well be asked, therefore, what cause they had
for alarm.</p>

<p>Outside were a dozen or more savage Comanches, who are among
the finest horsemen in the world, and who in fighting ability
and bravery are surpassed by none, unless the Apaches of the Southwest.</p>

<p>It was a piece of daring on the part of these dusky raiders thus
to attack the cabin, when they knew how well it was defended.
Captain Shirril was probably right in supposing they believed
that he and his nephew were with the rest of the cowboys, watching
the herd five miles away. Finding the couple in the cabin, they
could not resist the temptation to bring down the head of the
household, after which they must have supposed the rest would
be an easy task.</p>

<p>But having failed, probably they would have withdrawn but for
the shot of Avon Burnet, that had brought down one of their best
warriors, and their well-known desire for revenge urged them to
the most desperate measures against the whites.</p>

<p>But a few minutes' whispered conference at the rear of the cabin
brought to light the fact that every one of our friends, including
even Dinah, understood that their peril was of the gravest nature
conceivable.</p>

<p>The structure of the cabin was so thoroughly seasoned by its
years of exposure that it would be an easy matter for their assailants
to set fire to it, and that they would make the attempt was not
to be doubted. They always prepared for such action, and none
knew better than they its fearful effectiveness.</p>

<p>"We might reach the boys by means of the reports of our guns,"
said the captain, "if the wind were not the wrong way, but they
won't catch the first sound, especially as they will have their
hands full in looking after the cattle."</p>

<p>"But dey will obsarve de light ob de fiah," suggested Dinah.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, but when they do see it," said her master, "it
will be too late to help us. They haven't a suspicion of anything
of this kind; if they had, they would be down here like so many
cyclones."</p>

<p>"There is one way of letting them know," said Avon.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"By carrying word to them, and <em>I'm going to try it</em>!"</p>
