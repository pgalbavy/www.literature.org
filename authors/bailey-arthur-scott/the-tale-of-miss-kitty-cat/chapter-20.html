<p>BY SUNRISE Miss Kitty Cat had trotted at least a mile along the road
that passed the peddler's house. She wanted to get a safe distance away
before the family got up and turned loose the dog that had barked the
night before, when she arrived.
</p>
<p>Miss Kitty remembered clearly that the wagon had been climbing a long
hill before it turned into the peddler's dooryard. So without hesitating
she started <u>down</u> the road. She knew that in that direction lay
Pleasant Valley--and her home at Farmer Green's.
</p><p>Having put the first mile of her journey behind her, Miss Kitty stopped
beside a little brook and drank her fill of cool, sweet water. She was
very thirsty, because she hadn't had a drink since the evening before.
</p><p>A pretty wood stretched beyond the brook, tempting Miss Kitty Cat to
explore it. At that hour of the morning there were many birds twittering
among the trees. And spry chipmunks were frisking about in search of
their breakfast. Miss Kitty Cat just naturally began to think of her own
breakfast.
</p><p>"If I were at home, Mrs. Green would be setting a saucer of milk on the
woodshed steps about this time," she murmured. "But now I must shift for
myself."
</p><p>Luckily Miss Kitty was quite able to find something to eat, as a
surprised meadow mouse soon discovered.
</p><p>After breakfasting, Miss Kitty lingered a while to tease the birds, who
scolded her shrilly, calling her a tramp and telling her to get out of
their woods.
</p><p>Of course Miss Kitty had to stay there for a time after that, to let the
birds know that they couldn't frighten her away. She scared them almost
out of their wits by threatening to climb up where their nests were. But
she didn't do more than sharpen her claws against a tree-trunk. That
alone was enough to throw them into a panic.
</p><p>At last, after she had bothered the birds quite enough, Miss Kitty Cat
set off for Pleasant Valley once more. Sometimes she travelled through
fields; sometimes she jogged along the roads; sometimes she jumped to
the top of a stone wall and used that for a highway. And always when she
heard the creak and rattle of a wagon, as the sun rose higher and
higher, she crept into the bushes and hid until she had the road to
herself again.
</p><p>If Miss Kitty hadn't been homesick she would have thought her adventure
a great lark. But somehow she couldn't get Mrs. Green's house out of her
mind. Especially the thought of the kitchen, with its delicious odors of
seven-layer cakes baking in the oven, and doughnuts frying on top of the
range, made Miss Kitty's nose twitch. And her own particular warm spot
under the range, where she basked away long hours! When she recalled
that it was no wonder that her pace quickened.
</p><p>Perhaps Miss Kitty Cat herself couldn't have told exactly how she knew
the way back to Farmer Green's place. No doubt she wouldn't have told,
had she known; for she was one of the kind that keep such things to
themselves. She never even explained to old dog Spot, afterward, where
she spent the three nights that she was away from the farm.
</p><p>Anyhow, Miss Kitty Cat kept plodding along. And one afternoon when she
came out of a patch of woods on a hill-top, she saw something looming
right ahead of her that looked familiar.
</p><p>It was Blue Mountain. And she knew that on the other side of it lay
Pleasant Valley--and her home at Farmer Green's.
