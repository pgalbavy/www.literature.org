<p>Deerfoot's survey of the opposite shore was ended; but whether
it was satisfactory to himself or not, could be learned only by
questioning him. Jack Carleton took good care not to do that.
He had never seen the young Shawanoe so reserved, and having once
been denied the knowledge he sought, he left his friend to work
in his own way.</p>

<p>It looked to Jack as if the Shawanoe was seeking to wrap more
mystery than usual around himself, for when he came back to his
friends, he took off his quiver of arrows and placed it and his
bow in their charge, thus showing his purpose to leave them behind
in the business in which he was about to engage. It certainly
was inconvenient to swim the river with them, and, in spite of
the care and skill of the owner, it was impossible to reach land
with bow and arrows in the best condition. Furthermore, they rendered
him too conspicuous. No doubt some of the Pawnees were near at
hand, even though no signs were discovered, and if the Shawanoe
carried his weapons, his venture was likely to be defeated at
the beginning.</p>

<p>"Let my brother open his eyes," said he, after a few words with
the Sauk, which, of course, were not intelligible to Jack Carleton,
"the Pawnees are not far."</p>

<p>"I will do my best to guard against surprise," replied the young
Kentuckian, "and with Hay-uta as my friend, I am sure we shall
take care of ourselves."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot cannot say when he will come back," added the warrior,
looking toward the river, as though expecting to catch sight of
some clew among the leaves and branches, "but he hopes to be with
his friend before the sun is overhead."</p>

<p>This was the only farewell uttered by the Shawanoe, who walked
to the undergrowth which lined the shore and overhung the water.
He entered the latter like a diving-bell, whose enormous weight
causes it to sink silently and swiftly to the bottom.</p>

<p>"Hay-uta, let's watch him," said Jack, moving carefully to the
margin of the river, from which they could peer out without detection.
The Sauk could comprehend the action of the boy, though not his
words, and I am warranted in saying that his curiosity was equal
to that of his companion, when he gazed through the leafy interstices
upon the river.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe now gave an example of his amazing skill in the
water, such as Jack Carleton had never seen before. He remembered
the dexterity which he displayed in towing the canoe across the
Mississippi, with Jack and Otto in it, and with the Indians along
shore blazing away with their rifles; he had seen the youth disport
himself in a way that no one else could equal, but on none of
these occasions were his achievements so extraordinary as when
he let himself into the river, passed under the surface, and vanished
from sight.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton had heard of his exploit in sinking to the bottom
of the Ohio in a large iron kettle let over the side of the flatboat,
and of his swimming to shore behind the canoe in which sat Tecumseh,
but it now looked to him as if he were passing the entire distance&mdash;more
than a hundred yards&mdash;beneath the surface.</p>

<p>"That can not be," said the lad to himself, when he reflected
on the time it must take to proceed that far; "no human being
can hold his breath long enough to go more than half the distance,
and I don't believe he can go even that far."</p>

<p>There was scarcely a zephyr stirring, so that the rapidly flowing
river was without wavelet or disturbance. As none of us is amphibious,
the most skillful swimmer must seek the air at brief intervals,
and, knowing where the Shawanoe had entered, Jack fixed on the
point in the river where he would be likely to rise. He knew that,
of course, when he did so it would be only his nose which would
appear. Anyone on the shore would not suspect the meaning of such
appearance unless previous knowledge had awakened expectation,
but the closest scrutiny of Jack failed to see the slightest ripple,
such, as would have been made by the dropping of a pebble into
the river. The lad was right, beyond all question, when he concluded
that, wherever Deerfoot came up for air, it was a long ways from
the spot on which he had fixed his attention.</p>

<p>Glancing at Hay-uta bending forward at his side, he observed
that his scrutiny of the stream was as close as his own. He had,
in fact, made the same guess as the pale-face youth, but with
a more profound belief in the prodigious capacity of the Shawanoe,
he fixed upon a point further down stream and closer to the other
bank for his reappearance; but the seconds lengthened into minutes
and nothing was seen. The wing of the flitting insect, had it
glanced against the surface, would have caused a crinkle or two
which the watchful eyes of the Sauk would have detected, but as
it was, his vision, roaming back and forth, and here and there
over the calm surface, saw no sign that any thing of the kind
had taken place.</p>

<p>At the moment of greatest wonderment, both watchers were startled
by the leap of a small fish, which sprang a foot or two into the
air, flashing like silver in the sunlight, and then fell back.
The first belief of the spectators was that this was their friend,
but the truth was immediately apparent.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton was on the point of giving up, when the Sauk touched
his arm and uttered an exclamation. He was pointing to the other
shore, his extended finger indicating a tree which grew out almost
horizontally over the river, for a distance of eight or ten feet
and then curved upward like the runner of a sleigh.</p>

<p>As he looked he saw Deerfoot in the act of drawing himself out
of the water. With one hand he raised himself upon the twisted
trunk, along which he crept into the wood beyond, never making
the least salutation to his friends, who he might have known were
watching for him.</p>

<p>"By gracious!" exclaimed Jack. "He swam the whole distance under
water! he can beat a fish!"</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that Deerfoot accomplished this feat,
for it was beyond the range of human attainment; but he did swim
the distance with only a single rise if such it may be termed
when the tip of his nose gently came up long enough to empty his
lungs of their hot air, and take in another draught of the life-giving
element. That he should do this under the eyes, as may be said,
of two watchers, without their detection, was not the least remarkable
part of his performance.</p>

<p>Jack would have given much had he and Hay-uta possessed the power
of talking to each other. The Indian was one of the best warriors
of his tribe, and had formed a peculiar affection for the young
Shawanoe. More than likely he held some well-founded suspicions
of the real reason which led Deerfoot to make his curious trip
across the river, and between the two the truth might be brought
out.</p>

<p>Deerfoot having disappeared, it was idle to watch the river any
longer, and the two withdrew a step or two and sat on the ground,
there to await the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose I shall have time to teach him the English language,"
thought Jack, surveying his companion, who lolled on the ground
as though he meant to put in an hour or two of sleep; "and I'm
sure he won't be able to make much headway with me. I spent some
weeks visiting the Sauks (that is on their invitation), and never
was able to get hold of more than a dozen or so of their outlandish
words, but there isn't one of them that can be turned to account
just now. So I'll wait till Deerfoot tells the story for himself."</p>

<p>Probably twenty minutes had gone by, when the stillness was broken
by the report of a gun. It was from the other shore, and sounded
so faint that it must have been fully half a mile inland. Hay-uta
started up, and looking sharply at Jack, raised his hand for him
to keep silent. No need of that, for the youth was listening as
well as he. In the course of a few minutes Hay-uta rose and went
to the river shore, where he stayed some time, peering out over
the surface, but he came back without having seen any thing unusual,
nor did the two hear another sound of a gun.</p>

<p>"It would be strange," thought Jack Carleton, "if that rifle
killed Deerfoot; the tiniest bullet, if rightly aimed, will do
it, and great as is his skill it can not protect him against treachery.
As mother says, his time will come sooner or later, but none of
us can tell when, anymore than we can name the hour appointed
for us to die."</p>

<p>Except for the slight disturbance named, the Sauk would have
fallen into slumber, but all such disposition was now gone. Seating
himself on the ground, he began examining the bow and arrows which
had been left in their charge. Finding it somewhat awkward to
do so while in the sitting position, he rose to his feet, and
Jack placed himself at his side as if to give help, should it
be needed.</p>

<p>Perhaps it should be said that Jack Carleton knew one or two
interesting facts regarding Deerfoot not yet known to the reader.
In the first place, the Shawanoe was the owner of at least two
bows, nearly as long as himself and possessing tremendous power.
That which the Sauk held in charge was of mountain ash, made in
the usual fashion, the cord being composed of deer sinew, woven
as fine and almost as strong as steel wire. The center-piece was
round and had been polished hard and smooth by the friction of
the Shawanoe's right hand, which had grasped it so many times.
The entire bow had been stained a dark cherry color, its proportions
being so symmetrical that it would have been admired by any one.</p>

<p>When picked from the ground the bow was unstrung. Hay-uta carefully
bent it over and slipped the noose in place on the notched end.
Then, after examining one of the feather-tipped arrows, he fitted
it in place and looked around for some target at which to discharge
it.</p>

<p>Jack motioned to him to wait a moment while he furnished the
mark desired. Running toward the most open part of the wood, he
broke a branch and hung his cap on the stump, the distance being
perhaps twenty yards. Jack would have made it greater, but for
the interference of the vegetation.</p>

<p>The Sauk looked at the target a minute or two, then at the bow,
and fitting the end of the arrow against the string, he slowly
raised the weapon and took aim. Jack stepped back eight or ten
feet, so as to be out of danger, and watched the result.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he can hit it, but like enough he will skewer
my cap, which I ain't anxious to have done."</p>

<p>The Sauk held the bow slanting in front of him, just as he had
seen the owner do, and he took long and careful aim. He formed
a striking figure, his pose being graceful and correct. Unlike
the Shawanoe, he was right-handed, as was Jack. His left foot
was a little in advance of the right, the toe of the moccasin
pointed in the same direction as the arrow, while the right foot
was turned slightly outward. The left hand grasped the bow in
the middle, while (as most beginners do) he clasped the end of
the arrow against the string, between the thumb and forefinger.
His body was erect and well-balanced, the head thrust a little
forward, the left eye closed, and the right ranging along the
line of the arrow as though it were the barrel of his rifle.</p>

<p>Slowly he drew back the string until his right hand was beside
his cheek. He had seen Deerfoot many a time hold his right arm
rigid, while the other pulled the string back of his head, but
Hay-uta was surprised to find the tension so great that he could
not draw it another inch. Holding it thus a second or two, he
let fly.</p>
