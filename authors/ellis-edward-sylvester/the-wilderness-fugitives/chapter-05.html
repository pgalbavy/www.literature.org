<p>On the eve of starting for their destination they were confronted
by a practical difficulty, necessary to surmount before the journey
could be made. Their enemies had coolly appropriated the boat
in which they had intended to cross the river, and, another must
be found for the use of the fugitives. Ordinarily, this would
have been a small matter, but, coming as it did, it presented
a difficulty not easily surmounted. Where was the canoe to be
secured? Lena-Wingo was the one to whom the others looked to solve
the problem, and he undertook it without delay.</p>

<p>"Stay here," said he. "Lena-Wingo find canoe."</p>

<p>"If you can manage to get back before to-morrow night," put in
Rosa, "it may save us a deal of valuable time."</p>

<p>"Lena-Wingo come back soon as can&mdash;girl don't talk much."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you speak so encouragingly," she responded,
as he moved off and instantly vanished in the deep gloom of the
night.</p>

<p>Left to themselves, the three had little to do but to wait and
hope that their dusky friend would make good the promise of returning
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"It is one of those things that could not be discounted beforehand,"
said Jo Minturn, feeling that his sister was becoming unjustly
impatient. "For no one could have dreamed that they would step
up at the moment we were ready to start, and run off with the
boat."</p>

<p>"They must have known nothing about Rosa having occupied it this
afternoon," remarked Ned Clinton, glad of the chance of saying
something that would ward off any approach to the matter that
had caused him so much pain. "Their actions showed they did not
suspect what had taken place while they were gone."</p>

<p>"Yes; some of them must have taken that boat to the place this
forenoon or early in the afternoon, with the purpose of using
it to carry the colonel to the other shore."</p>

<p>"Suppose Lena-Wingo doesn't find another canoe?" asked Rosa,
who felt anything but comfortable over the absence of the tried
and trusty scout.</p>

<p>"It may take him longer than he wants, but he will succeed, you
may be sure of that."</p>

<p>"I should like to know why you and he went off in that mysterious
fashion a short time ago?" continued the girl, addressing her
brother. "It must have been a very important errand, judging from
the way you managed it."</p>

<p>"Well, I think it was important, for it was to find something
to eat, and I notice you are pretty sure to be interested in anything
of that nature."</p>

<p>"Well, did you get any food?"</p>

<p>"We got on the track of some when Colonel Butler appeared with
his Iroquois, and we had to take a look after them."</p>

<p>"So you didn't find any, after all," she repeated. "It is about
what I expected when you went away."</p>

<p>"Don't be too quick to judge us," replied the brother, in a voice
that was meant to signify a deal more than the mere words. "You'll
be surprised before long."</p>

<p>"The only thing to surprise me will be to see something like
haste used in getting over the river to Wilkesbarre. I suspect
that Lena-Wingo will wait till daylight before making the start,
even if he finds a canoe, on the ground that we ought to have
something to eat before starting."</p>

<p>A few minutes after, while the two were in an earnest discussion,
the Mohawk appeared among them, and said, in his sententious manner:</p>

<p>"Come with me&mdash;walk still&mdash;make no noise."</p>

<p>The fugitives had been in enough danger to render this admonition
unnecessary, but it was a warning which the Mohawk seemed to consider
timely on all occasions, for he was much addicted to using it.
It was so dark in the gloom of the forest that it was a matter
of no small difficulty for the little party to keep together.</p>

<p>"Jo, you had better take my hand on one side, and you, Edward,
on the other," said Rosa, "it is hard work to get along without
help."</p>

<p>The suggestion was adopted without much perceptible increase
of speed, as it still was necessary to feel their way with great
caution to prevent collisions with trunks and limbs. But the bliss
of Ned Clinton; who shall tell it? He forgot all the misery of
a short time before when the world seemed dismal and full of despair,
and was only conscious of the sweet fact that he held the hand
of Rosa Minturn in his own! At the first touch it seemed that
a thrill like the flash of the subtle magnetic current passed
through him, and he would not have cared if the journey continued
for half a dozen miles, so long as this arrangement lasted.</p>

<p>The admonition of the red scout was not forgotten, and when they
spoke it was in whispers, while frequent pauses were made, in
answer to the faintest possible "'Sh!" of Lena-Wingo, who was
conducting matters with his proverbial caution. Minturn saw something
suggestive in the fact that their guide was leading them away
from instead of toward the river, for the depths of the wood was
not the place to look for the canoe, of which they stood in so
much need just then. He suspected there was another reason, which
would soon become apparent. Ned might have noticed the same fact
and made inquiry about it, had he been capable of appreciating
anything besides the delight of holding the hand of his beloved.
That was happiness enough to last him at least for the time in
which the journey continued, and he cared very little whither
their guide led them, so long as he did not separate him from
Rosa.</p>

<p>Where all was shrouded in such darkness, neither of the fugitives,
with the exception of the Mohawk, was able to keep anything like
a knowledge of the precise course which they were following. The
ground was familiar to all, and indeed there was not one who had
not been over it so frequently that he or she would have identified
it in the daytime. But when all was indistinguishable, in the
darkness of the night, they could only trust to the skill of the
dusky guide, who seemed able at any time to pick his way with
unerring accuracy through the trackless forest.</p>

<p>In the earlier portion of the evening there was no moon, but
after starting a faint one was observed in the sky, and enough
of its rays penetrated the branches overhead to afford considerable
assistance to the three who were threading their way as best they
could in the track of the Mohawk. A few minutes after the moon
was noticed, all were startled by hearing the discharge of a gun
at no great distance on their left&mdash;that is, away from the river.
They paused and listened, expecting something to follow that would
explain what the report meant. But the stillness remained as profound
as that of the grave, the night being so quiet that there was
scarcely a rustle among the branches overhead, while not even
the soft flow of the river reached their ears.</p>

<p>The pause was only a few minutes in length, when the cautious
journey was resumed, still heading some little distance away from
the stream which they were so anxious to cross. Rosa had observed
this fact before, but she felt that it was hardly the thing to
criticise the Mohawk when he was at work; but she was becoming
impatient, and might have said something in the way of protest,
but for the discovery that a bright light was shining ahead of
them, which light undoubtedly meant something of interest to them
all.</p>
