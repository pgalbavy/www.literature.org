<p>Superciliousness is not safe after all, because a person who
forms the habit of wearing it may some day find his lower lip
grown permanently projected beyond the upper, so that he can't
get it back, and must go through life looking like the King of
Spain. This was once foretold as a probable culmination of Florence
Atwater's still plastic profile, if Florence didn't change her
way of thinking; and upon Florence's remarking dreamily that the
King of Spain was an awf'ly han'some man, her mother retorted:
"But not for a girl!" She meant, of course, that a girl who looked
too much like the King of Spain would not be handsome, but her
daughter decided to misunderstand her.</p>

<p>"Why, mamma, he's my Very Ideal! I'd marry him to-morrow!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Atwater paused in her darning, and let the stocking collapse
flaccidly into the work-basket in her lap. "Not at barely thirteen,
would you?" she said. "It seems to me you're just a shade too
young to be marrying a man who's already got a wife and several
children. Where did you pick up that 'I'd-marry-him-to-morrow,'
Florence?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I hear that everywhere!" returned the damsel, lightly. "Everybody
says things like that. I heard Aunt Julia say it. I heard Kitty
Silver say it."</p>

<p>"About the King of Spain?" Mrs. Atwater inquired.</p>

<p>"I don't know who they were saying it about," said Florence,
"but they were saying it. I don't mean they were saying it together;
I heard one say it one time and the other say it some other time.
I think Kitty Silver was saying it about some coloured man. She
proba'ly wouldn't want to marry any white man; at least I don't
expect she would. She's <em>been</em> married to a couple of coloured
men, anyhow; and she was married twice to one of 'em, and the
other one died in between. Anyhow, that's what she told me. She
weighed over two hunderd pounds the first time she was married,
and she weighed over two hunderd-and-seventy the last time she
was married to the first one over again, but she says she don't
know how much she weighed when she was married to the one in between.
She says she never got weighed all the time she was married to
that one. Did Kitty Silver ever tell you that, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Yes, often!" Mrs. Atwater replied. "I don't think it's very
entertaining; and it's not what we were talking about. I was trying
to tell you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I know," Florence interrupted. "You said I'd get my face so's
my underlip wouldn't go back where it ought to, if I didn't quit
turning up my nose at people I think are beneath contemp'. I guess
the best thing would be to just feel that way without letting
on by my face, and then there wouldn't be any danger."</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Atwater. "That's not what I meant. You mustn't
let your feelings get <em>their</em> nose turned up, or their
underlip out, either, because feelings can grow warped just as
well as&#11834;"</p>

<p>But her remarks had already caused her daughter to follow a trail
of thought divergent from the main road along which the mother
feebly struggled to progress. "Mamma," said Florence, "do you
b'lieve it's true if a person swallows an apple-seed or a lemon-seed
or a watermelon-seed, f'r instance, do you think they'd have a
tree grow up inside of 'em? Henry Rooter said it would, yesterday."</p>

<p>Mrs. Atwater looked a little anxious. "Did you swallow some sort
of seed?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It was only some grape-seeds, mamma; and you needn't think I
got to take anything for it, because I've swallowed a million,
I guess, in my time!"</p>

<p>"In your time?" her mother repeated, seemingly mystified.</p>

<p>"Yes, and so have you and papa," Florence went on. "I've seen
you when you ate grapes. Henry said maybe not, about grapes, because
I told him all what I've just been telling you, mamma, how I must
have swallowed a million, in my time, and he said grape-seeds
weren't big enough to get a good holt, but he said if I was to
swallow an apple-seed a tree would start up, and in a year or
two, maybe, it would grow up so't I couldn't get my mouth shut
on account the branches."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Henry said another boy told <em>him</em>, but he said you could
ask anybody and they'd tell you it was true. Henry said this boy
that told him's uncle died of it when he was eleven years old,
and this boy knew a grown woman that was pretty sick from it right
now. I expect Henry wasn't telling such a falsehood about it,
mamma, but proba'ly this boy did, because I didn't believe it
for a minute! Henry Rooter says he never told a lie <em>yet</em>,
in his whole life, mamma, and he wasn't going to begin now." She
paused for a moment, then added: "I don't believe a word he says!"</p>

<p>She continued to meditate disapprovingly upon Henry Rooter. "Old
thing!" she murmured gloomily, for she had indeed known moments
of apprehension concerning the grape-seeds. "Nothing but an old
thing&mdash;what he is!" she repeated inaudibly.</p>

<p>"Florence," said Mrs. Atwater, "don't you want to slip over to
grandpa's and ask Aunt Julia if she has a very large darning needle?
And don't forget not to look supercilious when you meet people
on the way. Even your grandfather has been noticing it, and he
was the one that spoke of it to me. Don't forget!"</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>Florence went out of the house somewhat moodily, but afternoon
sunshine enlivened her; and, opening the picket gate, she stepped
forth with a fair renewal of her chosen manner toward the public,
though just at that moment no public was in sight. Miss Atwater's
underlip resumed the position for which her mother had predicted
that regal Spanish fixity, and her eyebrows and nose were all
three perceptibly elevated. At the same time, her eyelids were
half lowered, while the corners of her mouth somewhat deepened,
as by a veiled mirth, so that this well-dressed child strolled
down the shady sidewalk wearing an expression not merely of high-bred
contempt but also of mysterious derision. It was an expression
that should have put any pedestrian in his place, and it seems
a pity that the long street before her appeared to be empty of
human life. No one even so much as glanced from a window of any
of the comfortable houses, set back at the end of their "front
walks" and basking amid pleasant lawns; for, naturally, this was
the "best residence street" in the town, since all the Atwaters
and other relatives of Florence dwelt there. Happily, an old gentleman
turned a corner before she had gone a hundred yards, and, as he
turned in her direction, it became certain that they would meet.
He was a stranger&mdash;that is to say, he was unknown to Florence&mdash;and
he was well dressed; while his appearance of age (proba'ly at
least forty or sixty or something) indicated that he might have
sense enough to be interested in other interesting persons.</p>

<p>An extraordinary change took place upon the surface of Florence
Atwater: all superciliousness and derision of the world vanished;
her eyes opened wide, and into them came a look at once far-away
and intently fixed. Also, a frown of concentration appeared upon
her brow, and her lips moved silently, but with rapidity, as if
she repeated to herself something of almost tragic import. Florence
had recently read a newspaper account of the earlier struggles
of a now successful actress: As a girl, this determined genius
went about the streets repeating the lines of various roles to
herself&mdash;constantly rehearsing, in fact, upon the public thoroughfares,
so carried away was she by her intended profession and so set
upon becoming famous. This was what Florence was doing now, except
that she rehearsed no r√¥le in particular, and the words formed
by her lips were neither sequential nor consequential, being,
in fact, the following: "Oh, the darkness ... never, never, never!
... you couldn't ... he wouldn't ... Ah, mother! ... Where the
river swings so slowly ... Ah, <em>no</em>!" Nevertheless, she
was doing all she could for the elderly stranger, and as they
came closer, encountered, and passed on, she had the definite
impression that he did indeed take her to be a struggling young
actress who would some day be famous&mdash;and then he might see her
on a night of triumph and recognize her as the girl he had passed
on the street, that day, so long ago! But by this time, the episode
was concluded; the footsteps of him for whom she was performing
had become inaudible behind her, and she began to forget him;
which was as well, since he went out of her life then, and the
two never met again. The struggling young actress disappeared,
and the previous superiority was resumed. It became elaborately
emphasized as a boy of her own age emerged from the "side yard"
of a house at the next corner and came into her view.</p>

<p>The boy caught sight of Florence in plenty of time to observe
this emphasis, which was all too obviously produced by her sensations
at sight of himself; and, after staring at her for a moment, he
allowed his own expression to become one of painful fatigue. Then
he slowly swung about, as if to return into that side-yard obscurity
whence he had come; making clear by this pantomime that he reciprocally
found the sight of her insufferable. In truth, he did; for he
was not only her neighbour but her first-cousin as well, and a
short month older, though taller than she&mdash;tall beyond his years,
taller than need be, in fact, and still in knickerbockers. However,
his parents may not have been mistaken in the matter, for it was
plain that he looked as well in knickerbockers as he could have
looked in anything. He had no visible beauty, though it was possible
to hope for him that by the time he reached manhood he would be
more tightly put together than he seemed at present; and indeed
he himself appeared to have some consciousness of insecurity in
the fastenings of his members, for it was his habit (observable
even now as he turned to avoid Miss Atwater) to haul at himself,
to sag and hitch about inside his clothes, and to corkscrew his
neck against the swathing of his collar. And yet there were times,
as the most affectionate of his aunts had remarked, when, for
a moment or so, he appeared to be almost knowing; and, seeing
him walking before her, she had almost taken him for a young man;
and sometimes he said something in a settled kind of way that
was almost adult. This fondest aunt went on to add, however, that
of course, the next minute after one of these fleeting spells,
he was sure to be overtaken by his more accustomed moods, when
his eye would again fix itself with fundamental aimlessness upon
nothing. In brief, he was at the age when he spent most of his
time changing his mind about things, or, rather, when his mind
spent most of its time changing him about things; and this was
what happened now.</p>

<p>After turning his back on the hateful sight well known to him
as his cousin Florence at her freshest, he turned again, came
forth from his place of residence, and joining her upon the pavement,
walked beside her, accompanying her without greeting or inquiry.
His expression of fatigue, indicating her insufferableness, had
not abated; neither had her air of being a duchess looking at
bugs.</p>

<p>"You <em>are</em> a pretty one!" he said; but his intention was
perceived to be far indeed from his words.</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>am</em> I, Mister Herbert Atwater?" Florence responded.
"I'm <em>awf'ly</em> glad <em>you</em> think so!"</p>

<p>"I mean about what Henry Rooter said," her cousin explained.
"Henry Rooter told me he made you believe you were goin' to have
a grapevine climbin' up from inside of you because you ate some
grapes with the seeds in 'em. He says you thought you'd haf to
get a carpenter to build a little arbour so you could swallow
it for the grapevine to grow on. He says&#11834;"</p>

<p>Florence had become an angry pink. "That little Henry Rooter
is the worst falsehooder in this town; and I never believed a
word he said in his life! Anyway, what affairs is it of yours,
I'd like you to please be so kind and obliging for to tell me,
Mister Herbert Illingsworth Atwater, Exquire!"</p>

<p>"What affairs?" Herbert echoed in plaintive satire. "What affairs
is it of mine? That's just the trouble! It's <em>got</em> to be
my affairs because you're my first-cousin. My goodness <em>I</em>
didn't have anything to do with you being my cousin, did I?"</p>

<p>"Well, <em>I</em> didn't!"</p>

<p>"That's neither here nor there," said Herbert. "What <em>I</em>
want to know is, how long you goin' to keep this up?"</p>

<p>"Keep what up?"</p>

<p>"I mean, how do you think I like havin' somebody like Henry Rooter
comin' round me tellin' what they made a cousin of mine believe,
and more than thirteen years old, goin' on fourteen ever since
about a month ago!"</p>

<p>Florence shouted: "Oh, for goodness' <em>sakes</em>!" then moderated
the volume but not the intensity of her tone. "Kindly reply to
<em>this</em>. Whoever asked you to come and take a walk with
me to-day?"</p>

<p>Herbert protested to heaven. "Why, I wouldn't take a walk with
you if every policeman in this town tried to make me! I wouldn't
take a walk with you if they brought a million horses and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't take a walk with <em>you</em>," Florence interrupted,
"if they brought a million million horses and cows and camels
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you wouldn't," Herbert said. "Not if <em>I</em> could help
it!"</p>

<p>But by this time Florence had regained her derisive superciliousness.
"There's a few things you <em>could</em> help," she said; and
the incautious Herbert challenged her with the inquiry she desired.</p>

<p>"What could I help?"</p>

<p>"I should think you could help bumpin' into me every second when
I'm takin' a walk on my own affairs, and walk along on your own
side of the sidewalk, anyway, and not be so awkward a person has
to keep trippin' over you about every time I try to take a step!"</p>

<p>Herbert withdrew temporarily to his own side of the pavement.
"Who?" he demanded hotly. "<em>Who</em> says I'm awkward?"</p>

<p>"All the fam'ly," Miss Atwater returned, with a light but infuriating
laugh. "You bump into 'em sideways and keep gettin' half in front
of 'em whenever they try to take a step, and then when it looks
as if they'd pretty near fall over you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You look here!"</p>

<p>"And besides all that," Florence went on, undisturbed, "why,
you generally keep kind of snorting, or somep'n, and then making
all those noises in your neck. You were doin' it at grandpa's
last Sunday dinner because every time there wasn't anybody talking,
why, everybody could hear you plain as everything, and you ought
to've seen grandpa look at you! He looked as if you'd set him
crazy if you didn't quit that chuttering and cluckling!"</p>

<p>Herbert's expression partook of a furious astonishment. "I don't
any such thing!" he burst out. "I guess I wouldn't talk much about
last Sunday dinner, if I was <em>you</em> neither. Who got caught
eatin' off the ice cream freezer spoon out on the back porch,
if you please? Yes, and I guess you better study a little grammar,
while you're about it. There's no such words in the English language
as 'cluckling' and 'chuttering.'"</p>

<p>"I don't care what language they're in," the stubborn Florence
insisted. "It's what you do, just the same: cluckling and chuttering!"</p>

<p>Herbert's manners went to pieces. "Oh, dry up!" he bellowed.</p>

<p>"That's a <em>nice</em> way to talk! So gentlemanly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well, you try be a lady, then!"</p>

<p>"'Try!'" Florence echoed. "Well, after that, I'll just politely
thank you to dry up, yourself, Mister Herbert Atwater!"</p>

<p>At this Herbert became moody. "Oh, pfuff!" he said; and for some
moments walked in silence. Then he asked: "Where you goin', Florence?"</p>

<p>The damsel paused at a gate opening upon a broad lawn evenly
divided by a brick walk that led to the white-painted wooden veranda
of an ample and honest old brick house. "Righ' there to grandpa's,
since you haf to know!" she said. "And thank you for your delightful
comp'ny which I never asked for, if you care to hear the truth
for once in your life!"</p>

<p>Herbert meditated. "Well, I got nothin' else to do, as I know
of," he said. "Let's go around to the back door so's to see if
Kitty Silver's got anything."</p>

<p>Then, not amiably, but at least inconsequently, they passed inside
the gate together. Their brows were fairly unclouded; no special
marks of conflict remained; for they had met and conversed in
a manner customary rather than unusual.</p>

<p>They followed a branch of the brick walk and passed round the
south side of the house, where a small orchard of apple-trees
showed generous promise. Hundreds of gay little round apples among
the leaves glanced the high lights to and fro on their polished
green cheeks as a breeze hopped through the yard, while the shade
beneath trembled with coquettishly moving disks of sunshine like
golden plates. A pattern of orange light and blue shadow was laid
like a fanciful plaid over the lattice and the wide, slightly
sagging steps of the elderly "back porch"; and here, taking her
ease upon these steps, sat a middle-aged coloured woman of continental
proportions. Beyond all contest, she was the largest coloured
woman in that town, though her height was not unusual, and she
had a rather small face. That is to say, as Florence had once
explained to her, her face was small but the other parts of her
head were terribly wide. Beside her was a circular brown basket,
of a type suggesting arts-and-crafts; it was made with a cover,
and there was a bow of brown silk upon the handle.</p>

<p>"What you been up to to-day, Kitty Silver?" Herbert asked genially.
"Any thing special?" For this was the sequel to his "so's we can
see if Kitty Silver's got anything." But Mrs. Silver discouraged
him.</p>

<p>"No, I ain't," she replied. "I ain't, an' I ain't goin' to."</p>

<p>"I thought you pretty near always made cookies on Tuesday," he
said.</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't <em>this</em> Tuesday," said Kitty Silver. "I
ain't, and I ain't goin' to. You might dess well g'on home ri'
now. I ain't, an' I ain't goin' to."</p>

<p>Docility was no element of Mrs. Silver's present mood, and Herbert's
hopeful eyes became blank, as his gaze wandered from her head
to the brown basket beside her. The basket did not interest him;
the ribbon gave it a quality almost at once excluding it from
his consciousness. On the contrary, the ribbon had drawn Florence's
attention, and she stared at the basket eagerly.</p>

<p>"What you got there, Kitty Silver?" she asked.</p>

<p>"What I got where?"</p>

<p>"In that basket."</p>

<p>"Nemmine what I got 'n 'at basket," said Mrs. Silver crossly,
but added inconsistently: "I dess <em>wish</em> somebody ast me
what I got 'n 'at basket! <em>I</em> ain't no cat-washwoman fer
_no_body!"</p>

<p>"Cats!" Florence cried. "Are there cats in that basket, Kitty
Silver? Let's look at 'em!"</p>

<p>The lid of the basket, lifted by the eager, slim hand of Miss
Atwater, rose to disclose two cats of an age slightly beyond kittenhood.
They were of a breed unfamiliar to Florence, and she did not obey
the impulse that usually makes a girl seize upon any young cat
at sight and caress it. Instead, she looked at them with some
perplexity, and after a moment inquired: "Are they really cats,
Kitty Silver, do you b'lieve?"</p>

<p>"Cats what she done tole <em>me</em>," the coloured woman replied.
"You betta shet lid down, you don' wan' 'em run away, 'cause they
ain't yoosta livin' 'n 'at basket yit; an' no matter whut kine
o' cats they is or they isn't, <em>one</em> thing true: they <em>wile</em>
cats!"</p>

<p>"But what makes their hair so long?" Florence asked. "I never
saw cats with hair a couple inches long like that."</p>

<p>"Miss Julia say they Berjum cats."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I ain't tellin' no mo'n she tole me. You' aunt say they Berjum
cats."</p>

<p>"Persian," said Herbert. "That's nothing. I've seen plenty Persian
cats. My goodness, I should think you'd seen a Persian cat at
yow age. Thirteen goin' on fourteen!"</p>

<p>"Well, I <em>have</em> seen Persian cats plenty times, I guess,"
Florence said. "I thought Persian cats were white, and these are
kind of gray."</p>

<p>At this Kitty Silver permitted herself to utter an embittered
laugh. "You wrong!" she said. "These cats, they white; yes'm!"</p>

<p>"Why, they aren't either! They're gray as&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No'm," said Mrs. Silver. "They plum spang white, else you' Aunt
Julia gone out her mind; me or her, one. I say: 'Miss Julia, them
gray cats.' 'White,' she say. 'Them two cats is white cats,' she
say. 'Them cats been crated,' she say. 'They been livin' in a
crate on a dirty express train fer th'ee fo' days,' she say. 'Them
cats gone got all smoke' up thataway,' she say. 'No'm, Miss Julia,'
I say, 'No'm, Miss Julia, they ain't <em>no</em> train,' I say,
'they ain't <em>no</em> train kin take an' smoke two white cats
up like these cats so's they hair is gray clean plum up to they
hide.' You betta put the lid down, I tell you!"</p>

<p>Florence complied, just in time to prevent one of the young cats
from leaping out of the basket, but she did not fasten the cover.
Instead, she knelt, and, allowing a space of half an inch to intervene
between the basket and the rim of the cover, peered within at
the occupants. "I believe the one to this side's a he," she said.
"It's got greenisher eyes than the other one; that's the way you
can always tell. I b'lieve this one's a he and the other one's
a she."</p>

<p>"I ain't stedyin' about no he an' she!"</p>

<p>"What did Aunt Julia say?" Florence asked.</p>

<p>"Whut you' Aunt Julia say when?"</p>

<p>"When you told her these were gray cats and not white cats?"</p>

<p>"She tole me take an' clean 'em," said Kitty Silver. "She say,
she say she want 'em clean' up spick an' spang befo' Mista Sammerses
git here to call an' see 'em." And she added morosely: "I ain't
no cat-washwoman!"</p>

<p>"She wants you to bathe 'em?" Florence inquired, but Kitty Silver
did not reply immediately. She breathed audibly, with a strange
effect upon vasty outward portions of her, and then gave an incomparably
dulcet imitation of her own voice, as she interpreted her use
of it during the recent interview.</p>

<p>'Miss Julia, ma'am,' I say&mdash;'Miss Julia, ma'am, my bizniss cookin'
vittles,' I say. 'Miss Julia, ma'am,' I tole her, 'Miss Julia,
ma'am, I cook fer you' pa, an' cook fer you' fam'ly year in, year
out, an' I hope an' pursue, whiles some might make complaint,
I take whatever I find, an' I leave whatever I find. No'm, Miss
Julia, ma'am,' I say&mdash;'no'm, Miss Julia, ma'am, I ain't no cat-washwoman!'"</p>

<p>"What did Aunt Julia say then?"</p>

<p>"She say, she say: 'Di'n I tell you take them cats downstairs
an' clean 'em?' she say. I ain't _no_body's cat-washwoman!"</p>

<p>Florence was becoming more and more interested. "I should think
that would be kind of fun," she said. "To be a cat-washwoman.
<em>I</em> wouldn't mind that at all: I'd kind of like it. I expect
if you was a cat-washwoman, Kitty Silver, you'd be pretty near
the only one was in the world. I wonder if they do have 'em any
place, cat-washwomen."</p>

<p>"I don' know if they got 'em some place," said Kitty Silver,
"an' I don't know if they ain't got 'em no place; but I bet if
they do got 'em any place, it's some place else from here!"</p>

<p>Florence looked thoughtful. "Who was it you said is going to
call this evening and see 'em?"</p>

<p>"Mista Sammerses."</p>

<p>"She means Newland Sanders," Herbert explained. "Aunt Julia says
all her callers that ever came to this house in their lives, Kitty
Silver never got the name right of a single one of 'em!"</p>

<p>"Newland Sanders is the one with the little moustache," Florence
said. "Is that the one you mean by 'Sammerses,' Kitty Silver?"</p>

<p>"Mista Sammerses who you' Aunt Julia tole <em>me</em>," Mrs.
Silver responded stubbornly. "He ain't got no moustache whut you
kin look at&mdash;dess some blackish whut don' reach out mo'n halfway
todes the bofe ends of his mouf."</p>

<p>"Well," said Florence, "was Mr. Sanders the one gave her these
Persian cats, Kitty Silver?"</p>

<p>"I reckon." Mrs. Silver breathed audibly again, and her expression
was strongly resentful. "When she go fer a walk 'long with any
them callers she stop an' make a big fuss over any li'l ole dog
or cat an' I don't know whut all, an' after they done buy her
all the candy from all the candy sto's in the livin' worl', an'
all the flowers from all the greenhouses they is, it's a wonder
some of 'em ain't sen' her a mule fer a present, 'cause seem like
to me they done sen' her mos' every kine of animal they is! Firs'
come Airydale dog you' grampaw tuck an' give away to the milkman;
'n'en come two mo' pups; I don't know whut they is, 'cause they
bofe had dess sense enough to run away after you' grampaw try
learn 'em how much he ain't like no pups; an' nex' come them two
canaries hangin' in the dinin'-room now, an' nex'&mdash;di'n' I holler
so's they could a-hear me all way down town? Di'n' I walk in my
kitchen one mawnin' right slam in the face of ole warty allagatuh
three foot long a-lookin' at me over the aidge o' my kitchen sink?"</p>

<p>"It was Mr. Clairdyce gave her that," said Florence. "He'd been
to Florida; but she didn't care for it very much, and she didn't
make any fuss at all when grandpa got the florist to take it.
Grandpa hates animals."</p>

<p>"He don' hate 'em no wuss'n whut I do," said Kitty Silver. "An'
he ain't got to ketch 'em lookin' at him outen of his kitchen
sink&mdash;an' he ain't fixin' to be no cat-washwoman neither!"</p>

<p>"<em>Are</em> you fixing to?" Florence asked quickly. "You don't
need to do it, Kitty Silver. I'd be willing to, and so'd Herbert.
Wouldn't you, Herbert?"</p>

<p>Herbert deliberated within himself, then brightened. "I'd just
as soon," he said. "I'd kind of like to see how a cat acts when
it's getting bathed."</p>

<p>"I think it would be spesh'ly inter'sting to wash Persian cats,"
Florence added, with increasing enthusiasm. "I never washed a
cat in my life."</p>

<p>"Neither have I," said Herbert. "I always thought they did it
themselves."</p>

<p>Kitty Silver sniffed. "Ain't I says so to you' Aunt Julia? She
done tole me, 'No,' she say. She say, she say Berjum cats ain't
wash they self; they got to take an' git somebody else to wash
'em!"</p>

<p>"If we're goin' to bathe 'em," said Florence, "we ought to know
their names, so's we can tell 'em to hold still and everything.
You can't do much with an animal unless you know their name. Did
Aunt Julia tell you these cats' names, Kitty Silver?"</p>

<p>"She say they name Feef an' Meemuh. Yes'm! Feef an' Meemuh! Whut
kine o' name is Feef an' Meemuh fer cat name!"</p>

<p>"Oh, those are lovely names!" Florence assured her, and, turning
to Herbert, explained: "She means Fifi and Mimi."</p>

<p>"Feef an' Meemuh," said Kitty Silver. "Them name don' suit me,
an' them long-hair cats don' suit me neither." Here she lifted
the cover of the basket a little, and gazed nervously within.
