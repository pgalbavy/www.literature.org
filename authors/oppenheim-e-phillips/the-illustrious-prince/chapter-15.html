<P>
Once more Penelope found herself in the library of the great
house in Park Lane, where Mr. Blaine-Harvey presided over the
interests of his country. This time she came as an uninvited,
even an unexpected guest. The Ambassador, indeed, had been
fetched away by her urgent message from the reception rooms,
where his wife was entertaining a stream of callers. Penelope
refused to sit down.
<P>
"I have not much to say to you, Mr. Harvey," she said. "There is
just something which I have discovered and which you ought to
know. I want to tell it you as quickly as possible and get away."
<P>
"A propos of our last conversation?" he asked eagerly.
<P>
She bowed her head.
<P>
"It concerns Prince Maiyo," she admitted.
<P>
"You are sure that you will not sit down?" he persisted. "You
know how interesting this is to me."
<P>
She smiled faintly.
<P>
"To me," she said, "it is terrible. My only desire is to tell you
and have finished with it. You remember, when I was here last,
you told me that it was your firm belief that somewhere behind
the hand which murdered Hamilton Fynes and poor Dicky stood the
shadow of Prince Maiyo."
<P>
"I remember it perfectly," he answered.
<P>
"You were right," Penelope said.
<P>
The Ambassador drew a little breath. It was staggering, this,
even if expected.
<P>
"I have talked with the Prince several times since our
conversation," Penelope continued. "So far as any information
which he gave me or seemed likely to give me, I might as well
have talked in a foreign language. But in his house, the day
before yesterday, in his own library, hidden in a casket which
opened only with a secret lock, I found two things."
<P>
"What were they?" the Ambassador asked quickly.
<P>
"A roll of silken cord," Penelope said, "such as was used to
strangle poor Dicky, and a strangely shaped dagger exactly like
the picture of the one with which Hamilton Fynes was stabbed."
<P>
"Did he know that you found them?" Mr. Blaine-Harvey asked.
<P>
"He was with me," Penelope answered. "He even, at my request,
opened the casket. He must have forgotten that they were there."
<P>
"Perhaps," the Ambassador said thoughtfully, "he never knew."
<P>
"One cannot tell," Penelope answered.
<P>
"Did he say anything when you discovered them?" the Ambassador
asked.
<P>
"Nothing," Penelope declared. "It was not necessary. I saw his
face. He knows that I understand. It may have been some one else
connected with the house, of course, but the main fact is beyond
all doubt. Those murders were instigated, if they were not
committed, by the Prince."
<P>
The Ambassador walked to the window and back again.
<P>
"Penelope," he said, "you have only confirmed what I felt must be
so, but even then the certainty of it is rather a shock."
<P>
She gave him her hand.
<P>
"I have told you the truth," she said. "Make what use of it you
will. There is one other thing, perhaps, which I ought to tell
you. The Prince is going back to his own country very shortly."
<P>
Mr. Harvey nodded.
<P>
"I have just been given to understand as much," he said. "At
present he is to be met with every day. I believe that he is even
now in my drawing rooms."
<P>
"Where I ought to be," Penelope said, turning toward the door,
"only I felt that I must see you first."
<P>
"I will not come with you," Mr. Harvey said. "There is no need
for our little conference to become the subject of comment. By
the bye," he added, "let me take this opportunity of wishing you
every happiness. I haven't seen Somerfield yet, but he is a lucky
fellow. As an American, however, I cannot help grudging another
of our most popular daughters to even the best of Englishmen."
<P>
Penelope's smile was a little forced.
<P>
"Thank you very much," she said. "It is all rather in the air, at
present, you know. We are not going to be married for some time."
<P>
"When it comes off," the Ambassador said, "I am going to talk to
the Duchess and Miss Morse. I think that I ought to give you
away."
<P>
Penelope made her way into Mrs. Blaine-Harvey's reception rooms,
crowded with a stream of guests, who were sitting about, drinking
tea and listening to the music, passing in and out all the time.
Curiously enough, almost the first person whom she saw was the
Prince. He detached himself from a little group and came at once
towards her. He took her hand in his and for a moment said
nothing. Notwithstanding the hours of strenuous consideration,
the hours which she had devoted to anticipating and preparing for
this meeting, she felt her courage suddenly leaving her, a
sinking at the knees, a wild desire to escape, at any cost. The
color which had been so long denied her streamed into her cheeks.
There was something baffling, yet curiously disturbing, in the
manner of his greeting.
<P>
"Is it true?" he asked.
<P>
She did not pretend to misunderstand him. It was amazing that he
should ignore that other tragical incident, that he should think
of nothing but this! Yet, in a way, she accepted it as a natural
thing.
<P>
"Is it true that I am engaged to Sir Charles Somerfield," she
answered.
<P>
"I must wish you every happiness," he said slowly. "Indeed, that
wish comes from my heart, and I think that you know it. As for
Sir Charles Somerfield, I cannot imagine that he has anything
left in the world to wish for."
<P>
"You are a born courtier, Prince," she murmured. "Please remember
that in my democratic country one has never had a chance of
getting used to such speeches."
<P>
"Your country," he remarked, "prides itself upon being the
country where truth prevails. If so, you should have become
accustomed by now to hearing pleasant things about yourself. So
you are going to marry Sir Charles Somerfield!"
<P>
"Why do you say that over to yourself so doubtfully?" she asked.
"You know who he is, do you not? He is rich, of old family,
popular with everybody, a great sportsman, a mighty hunter. These
are the things which go to the making of a man, are they not?"
<P>
"Beyond a doubt," the Prince answered gravely. "They go to the
making of a man. It is as you say."
<P>
"You like him personally, don't you?" she asked.
<P>
"Sir Charles Somerfield and I are almost strangers," the Prince
replied. "I have not seen much of him, and he has so many tastes
which I cannot share that it is hard for us to come very near
together. But if you have chosen him, it is sufficient. I am
quite sure that he is all that a man should be."
<P>
"Tell me in what respect your tastes are so far apart?" she
asked. "You say that as though there were something in the manner
of his life of which you disapproved."
<P>
"We are sons of different countries, Miss Penelope," the Prince
said. "We look out upon life differently, and the things which
seem good to him may well seem idle to me. Before I go," he added
a little hesitatingly, "we may speak of this again. But not now."
<P>
"I shall remind you of that promise, Prince," she declared.
<P>
"I will not fail to keep it," he replied. "You have, at least,"
he added after a moment's pause, "one great claim upon happiness.
You are the son and the daughter of kindred races."
<P>
She looked at him as though not quite understanding.
<P>
"I was thinking," he continued simply, "of my own father and
mother. My father was a Japanese nobleman, with the home call of
all the centuries strong in his blood. He was an enlightened man,
but he saw nothing in the manner of living or the ideals of other
countries to compare with those of the country of his own birth.
I sometimes think that my mother and father might have been
happier had one of them been a little more disposed to yield to
the other I think, perhaps, that their union would have been a
more successful one. They were married, and they lived together,
but they lived apart."
<P>
"It was not well for you, this," she remarked.
<P>
He shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"Do not mistake me," he begged. "So far as I am concerned, I am
content. I am Japanese. The English blood that is in my veins is
but as a drop of water compared to the call of my own country.
And yet there are some things which have come to me from my
mother--things which come most to the surface when I am in this,
her own country--which make life at times a little sad. Forgive
me if I have been led on to speak too much of myself. Today one
should think of nothing but of you and of your happiness."
<P>
He turned to accept the greeting of an older woman who had
lingered for a moment, in passing, evidently anxious to speak to
him. Penelope watched his kindly air, listened to the courteous
words which flowed from his lips, the interest in his manner,
which his whole bearing denoted, notwithstanding the fact that
the woman was elderly and plain, and had outlived the friends of
her day and received but scanty consideration from the present
generation. It was typical of him, too, she realized. It was
never to the great women of the world that he unbent most
thoroughly. Gray hairs seemed to inspire his respect, to command
his attentions in a way that youth and beauty utterly failed to
do. These things seemed suddenly clear to Penelope as she stood
there watching him. A hundred little acts of graceful kindness,
which she had noticed and admired, returned to her memory. It was
this man whom she had lifted her hand to betray! It was this man
who was to be accounted guilty, even of crime! There came a
sudden revulsion of feeling. The whole mechanical outlook upon
life, as she had known it, seemed, even in those few seconds, to
become a false and meretricious thing. Whatever he had done or
countenanced was right. She had betrayed his hospitality. She had
committed an infamous breach of trust. An overwhelming desire
came over her to tell him everything. She took a quick step
forward and found herself face to face with Somerfield. The
Prince was buttonholed by some friends and led away. The moment
had passed.
<P>
"Come and talk to the Duchess," Somerfield said. "She has
something delightful to propose."
