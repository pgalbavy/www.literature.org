<p>"It's Jasper Jay!" Rusty Wren cried, as soon as he and his wife
heard the hoarse cry outside their house. "He's playing one of his
tricks on us. And I'm going out and tell him exactly what I think
of him."
</p>
<p>"Don't forget to tell him what I think of him, too!" Mrs. Rusty
said, as she let go of her husband's coat-tails.
</p><p>Then Rusty hurried through the little doorway. And there was
Jasper, sitting on a limb above the house, with a cherry in his
bill, which he let fall with a sly smile.
</p><p>The cherry struck the roof of Rusty's house with a loud <u>bang</u>! And
then came the same <u>clatter</u>, to which the Wren family had been
listening.
</p><p>"Here! Stop that!" Rusty cried.
</p><p>Jasper Jay shrieked with laughter.
</p><p>"Go away!" said Rusty.
</p><p>"Go away yourself!" retorted Jasper.
</p><p>"This is my home," Rusty Wren told him hotly. "And you've no right
to come here and frighten my wife and children like this."
</p><p>"How shall I frighten them, then?" Jasper Jay asked him. "Perhaps
you like this way better!" he shouted. And with that he flew
straight at Rusty Wren. He was so big and he looked so cruel that
Rusty turned tail and dashed back into his house again. And he was
glad that his doorway was not much bigger than a twenty-five-cent
piece, because he knew that Jasper Jay could never squeeze through
so small an opening.
</p><p>Jasper alighted on top of the house and jumped up and down on the
roof, striking it with his bill and screaming angrily.
</p><p>"Don't be afraid!" Rusty said to his wife. "He can't do any harm.
And after a while he'll grow tired of staying here and he'll go
away."
</p><p>Well, Rusty was half right, at least. For Jasper Jay went away at
last; but he didn't wait until he had grown weary of his rowdyish
sport.
</p><p>Now, Johnnie Green happened to hear Jasper's harsh cries. And,
looking out of the window, he saw Jasper's strange performance.
</p><p>"That blue jay is teasing my little wrens!" Johnnie Green cried
indignantly. And, catching up a potato from the kitchen table, he
hurried to the door and hurled it as hard as he could at the
blue-coated trouble-maker.
</p><p>The potato missed Jasper Jay by less than an inch, bringing up
_kerplunk!_ against the trunk of the old cherry tree, and breaking
into several pieces.
</p><p>And then it was Jasper Jay's turn to be alarmed. He jumped off the
roof of Rusty Wren's house as if he had been shot and dashed off as
fast as his handsome wings could carry him. He knew of no way to
tease Johnnie Green; so there was really no sense in his staying in
Farmer Green's yard any longer.
</p><p>Johnnie jeered at Jasper as the frightened bully hurried away.
</p><p>"You'd better not come skulking around here again!" he shouted.
</p><p>Although the cherries hung red and juicy upon the old tree for at
least a week longer, just begging to be picked--as one might
say--Jasper Jay did not come back to enjoy them. He told Jolly
Robin that he was entirely too busy to waste his time in an old
cherry tree.
