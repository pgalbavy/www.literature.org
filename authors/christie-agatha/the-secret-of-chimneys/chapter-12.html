<p>"Mr. Anthony Cade," announced Tredwell.</p>

<p>"Enter suspicious stranger from village inn," said Anthony.</p>

<p>He made his way toward Lord Caterham with a kind of instinct
rare in strangers. At the same time he summed up the other three
men in his own mind thus: "1, Scotland Yard. 2, Local dignitary—probably
chief constable. 3, Harassed gentleman on the verge of apoplexy—possibly
connected with the Government."</p>

<p>"I must apologize," continued Anthony, still addressing Lord
Caterham. "For forcing my way in like this, I mean. But it was
rumoured round the <em>Jolly Dog</em>, or whatever the name of
your local pub may be, that you had had a murder up here, and
as I thought I might be able to throw some light upon it I came
along."</p>

<p>For a moment or two, no one spoke. Superintendent Battle because
he was a man of ripe experience who knew how infinitely better
it was to let every one else speak if they could be persuaded
upon to do so, Colonel Melrose because he was habitually taciturn,
George because he was in the habit of having notice given him
of the question, Lord Caterham because he had not the least idea
of what to say. The silence of the other three, however, and the
fact that he had been directly addressed, finally forced speech
upon the last named.</p>

<p>"Er—quite so—quite so," he said nervously. "Won’t—you—er—sit
down?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Anthony.</p>

<p>George cleared his throat portentously.</p>

<p>"Er—when you say you can throw light upon this matter, you mean——?"</p>

<p>"I mean," said Anthony, "that I was trespassing upon Lord Caterham’s
property (for which I hope he will forgive me) last night at about
11.45, and that I actually heard the shot fired. I can at any
rate fix the time of the crime for you."</p>

<p>He looked round at the three in turn, his eyes resting longest
on Superintendent Battle, the impassivity of whose face he seemed
to appreciate.</p>

<p>"But I hardly think that that’s news to you," he added gently.</p>

<p>"Meaning by that, Mr. Cade?" asked Battle.</p>

<p>"Just this. I put on shoes when I got up this morning. Later,
when I asked for my boots, I couldn’t have them. Some nice young
constable had called round for them. So I naturally put two and
two together, and hurried up here to clear my character if possible."</p>

<p>"A very sensible move," said Battle non-committally.</p>

<p>Anthony’s eyes twinkled a little.</p>

<p>"I appreciate your reticence, inspector. It is inspector, isn’t
it?"</p>

<p>Lord Caterham interposed. He was beginning to take a fancy to
Anthony.</p>

<p>"Superintendent Battle of Scotland Yard. This is Colonel Melrose,
our Chief Constable, and Mr. Lomax."</p>

<p>Anthony looked sharply at George.</p>

<p>"Mr. George Lomax?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I think, Mr. Lomax," said Anthony, "that I had the pleasure
of receiving a letter from you yesterday."</p>

<p>George stared at him.</p>

<p>"I think not," he said coldly.</p>

<p>But he wished that Miss Oscar were here. Miss Oscar wrote all
his letters for him, and remembered who they were to and what
they were about. A great man like George could not possibly remember
all these annoying details.</p>

<p>"I think, Mr. Cade," he hinted, "that you were about to give
us some—er—explanation of what you were doing in the grounds last
night at 11.45?"</p>

<p>His tone said plainly: "And whatever it may be, we are not likely
to believe it."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Cade, what <em>were</em> you doing?" said Lord Caterham,
with lively interest.</p>

<p>"Well," said Anthony regretfully. "I’m afraid it’s rather a long
story."</p>

<p>He drew out his cigarette case.</p>

<p>"May I?"</p>

<p>Lord Caterham nodded, and Anthony lit a cigarette, and braced
himself for the ordeal.</p>

<p>He was aware, none better, of the peril in which he stood. In
the short space of twenty-four hours, he had become embroiled
in two separate crimes. His actions in connection with the first
would not bear looking into for a second. After deliberately disposing
of one body, and so defeating the aims of justice, he had arrived
upon the scene of the second crime at the exact moment when it
was being committed. For a young man looking for trouble, he could
hardly have done better.</p>

<p>"South America," thought Anthony to himself, "simply isn’t in
it with this!"</p>

<p>He had already decided upon his course of action. He was going
to tell the truth—with one trifling alteration, and one grave
suppression.</p>

<p>"The story begins," said Anthony, "about three weeks ago—in Bulawayo.
Mr. Lomax, of course, knows where that is—outpost of the Empire—‘What
do we know of England who only England know?’ all that sort of
thing. I was conversing with a friend of mine, a Mr. James McGrath—"</p>

<p>He brought out the name slowly, with a thoughtful eye on George.
George bounded in his seat and repressed an exclamation with difficulty.</p>

<p>"The upshot of our conversation was that I came to England to
carry out a little commission for Mr. McGrath, who was unable
to go himself. Since the passage was booked in his name, I travelled
as James McGrath. I don’t know what particular kind of offence
that was—the superintendent can tell me, I dare say, and run me
in for so many months’ hard if necessary."</p>

<p>"We’ll get on with the story, if you please, sir," said Battle,
but his eyes twinkled a little.</p>

<p>"On arrival in London I went to the Blitz Hotel, still as James
McGrath. My business in London was to deliver a certain manuscript
to a firm of publishers, but almost immediately I received deputations
from the representatives of two political parties of a foreign
kingdom. The methods of one were strictly constitutional, the
methods of the other were not. I dealt with them both accordingly.
But my troubles were not over. That night my room was broken into,
and an attempt at burglary was made by one of the waiters at the
hotel."</p>

<p>"That was not reported to the police, I think?" said Superintendent
Battle.</p>

<p>"You are right. It was not. Nothing was taken, you see. But I
did report the occurrence to the manager of the hotel, and he
will confirm my story, and tell you that the waiter in question
decamped rather abruptly in the middle of the night. The next
day, the publishers rang me up, and suggested that one of their
representatives would call upon me and receive the manuscript.
I agreed to this, and the arrangement was duly carried out on
the following morning. Since I have heard nothing further, I presume
the manuscript reached them safely. Yesterday, still as James
McGrath, I received a letter from Mr. Lomax——"</p>

<p>Anthony paused. He was by now beginning to enjoy himself. George
shifted uneasily.</p>

<p>"I remember," he murmured. "Such a large correspondence. The
name, of course, being different, I could not be expected to know.
And I may say," George’s voice rose a little, firm in the assurance
of moral stability, "that I consider this—this—masquerading as
another man in the highest degree improper. I have no doubt, no
doubt whatever, that you have incurred a severe legal penalty."</p>

<p>"In this letter," continued Anthony, unmoved, "Mr. Lomax made
various suggestions concerning the manuscript in my charge. He
also extended an invitation to me from Lord Caterham to join the
house party here."</p>

<p>"Delighted to see you, my dear fellow," said that nobleman. "Better
late than never—eh?"</p>

<p>George frowned at him.</p>

<p>Superintendent Battle bent an unmoved eye upon Anthony.</p>

<p>"And is that your explanation of your presence here last night,
sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Anthony warmly. "When I am asked to stay
at a country-house, I don’t scale the wall late at night, tramp
across the park, and try the downstairs windows. I drive up to
the front door, ring the bell and wipe my feet on the mat. I will
proceed. I replied to Mr. Lomax’s letter, explaining that the
manuscript had passed out of my keeping, and therefore regretfully
declining Lord Caterham’s kind invitation. But after I had done
so, I remembered something which had up till then escaped my memory."
He paused. The moment had come for skating over thin ice. "I must
tell you that in my struggle with the waiter Giuseppe, I had wrested
from him a small bit of paper with some words scribbled on it.
They had conveyed nothing to me at the time, but I still had them,
and the mention of Chimneys recalled them to me. I got the torn
scrap out and looked at it. It was as I had thought. Here is the
piece of paper, gentlemen, you can see for yourselves. The words
on it are ‘<em>Chimneys 11.45 Thursday.</em>’"</p>

<p>Battle examined the paper attentively.</p>

<p>"Of course," continued Anthony, "the word Chimneys might have
nothing whatever to do with this house. On the other hand, it
might. And undoubtedly this Giuseppe was a thieving rascal. I
made up my mind to motor down here last night, satisfy myself
that all was as it should be, put up at the inn, and call upon
Lord Caterham in the morning and put him on his guard in case
some mischief should be intended during the week-end."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Lord Caterham encouragingly. "Quite so."</p>

<p>"I was late in getting here—had not allowed enough time. Consequently
I stopped the car, climbed over the wall and ran across the park.
When I arrived on the terrace, the whole house was dark and silent.
I was just turning away when I heard a shot. I fancied that it
came from inside the house, and I ran back, crossed the terrace,
and tried the windows. But they were fastened, and there was no
sound of any kind from inside the house. I waited a while, but
the whole place was still as the grave, so I made up my mind that
I had made a mistake, and that what I had heard was a stray poacher—quite
a natural conclusion to come to under the circumstances, I think."</p>

<p>"Quite natural," said Superintendent Battle expressionlessly.</p>

<p>"I went on to the inn, put up as I said—and heard the news this
morning. I realized, of course, that I was a suspicious character—bound
to be under the circumstances, and came up here to tell my story,
hoping it wasn’t going to be handcuffs for one."</p>

<p>There was a pause. Colonel Melrose looked sideways at Superintendent
Battle.</p>

<p>"I think the story seems clear enough," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Battle. "I don’t think we’ll be handing out any handcuffs
this morning."</p>

<p>"Any questions, Battle?"</p>

<p>"There’s one thing I’d like to know. What was this manuscript?"</p>

<p>He looked across at George, and the latter replied with a trace
of unwillingness:</p>

<p>"The Memoirs of the late Count Stylptitch. You see——"</p>

<p>"You needn’t say anything more," said Battle. "I see perfectly."</p>

<p>He turned to Anthony.</p>

<p>"Do you know who it was that was shot, Mr. Cade?"</p>

<p>"At the <em>Jolly Dog</em> it was understood to be a Count Stanislaus
or some such name."</p>

<p>"Tell him," said Battle laconically to George Lomax.</p>

<p>George was clearly reluctant, but he was forced to speak:</p>

<p>"The gentleman who was staying here incognito as Count Stanislaus
was His Highness Prince Michael of Herzoslovakia."</p>

<p>Anthony whistled.</p>

<p>"That must be deuced awkward," he remarked.</p>

<p>Superintendent Battle, who had been watching Anthony closely,
gave a short grunt as though satisfied of something, and rose
abruptly to his feet.</p>

<p>"There are one or two questions I’d like to ask Mr. Cade," he
announced. "I’ll take him into the Council Chamber with me if
I may."</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly," said Lord Caterham. "Take him anywhere
you like."</p>

<p>Anthony and the detective went out together.</p>

<p>The body had been removed from the scene of the tragedy. There
was a dark stain on the floor where it had lain, but otherwise
there was nothing to suggest that a tragedy had ever occurred.
The sun poured in through the three windows, flooding the room
with light, and bringing out the mellow tone of the old panelling.
Anthony looked around him with approval.</p>

<p>"Very nice," he commented. "Nothing much to beat old England,
is there?"</p>

<p>"Did it seem to you at first it was in this room the shot was
fired?" asked the superintendent, not replying to Anthony’s eulogium.</p>

<p>"Let me see."</p>

<p>Anthony opened the window and went out on the terrace, looking
up at the house.</p>

<p>"Yes, that’s the room all right," he said. "It’s built out, and
occupies all the corner. If the shot had been fired anywhere else,
it would have sounded from the <em>left</em>, but this was from
behind me or to the right if anything. That’s why I thought of
poachers. It’s at the extremity of the wing, you see."</p>

<p>He stepped back across the threshold, and asked suddenly, as
though the idea had just struck him:</p>

<p>"But why do you ask? You know he was shot here, don’t you?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said me superintendent. "We never know as much as we’d
like to know. But, yes, he was shot here all right. Now you said
something about trying the windows, didn’t you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They were fastened from the inside."</p>

<p>"How many of them did you try?"</p>

<p>"All three of them."</p>

<p>"Sure of that, sir?"</p>

<p>"I’m in the habit of being sure. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"That’s a funny thing," said the superintendent.</p>

<p>"What’s a funny thing?"</p>

<p>"When the crime was discovered this morning, the middle one was
open—not latched, that is to say."</p>

<p>"Whew!" said Anthony, sinking down on the window seat, and taking
out his cigarette case. "That’s rather a blow. That opens up quite
a different aspect of the case. It leaves us two alternatives.
Either he was killed by some one in the house, and that some one
unlatched the window after I had gone to make it look like an
outside job—incidentally with me as Little Willie—or else, not
to mince matters, I’m lying. I dare say you incline to the second
possibility, but, upon my honour, you’re wrong."</p>

<p>"Nobody’s going to leave this house until I’m through with them,
I can tell you that," said Superintendent Battle grimly.</p>

<p>Anthony looked at him keenly.</p>

<p>"How long have you had the idea that it might be an inside job?"
he asked.</p>

<p>Battle smiled.</p>

<p>"I’ve had a notion that way all along. Your trail was a bit too—flaring,
if I may put it that way. As soon as your boots fitted the footmarks,
I began to have my doubts."</p>

<p>"I congratulate Scotland Yard," said Anthony lightly.</p>

<p>But at that moment, the moment when Battle apparently admitted
Anthony’s complete absence of complicity in the crime, Anthony
felt more than ever the need of being upon his guard. Superintendent
Battle was a very astute officer. It would not do to make any
slip with Superintendent Battle about.</p>

<p>"That’s where it happened, I suppose?" said Anthony, nodding
towards the dark patch upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What was he shot with—a revolver?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but we shan’t know what make until they get the bullet
out at the autopsy."</p>

<p>"It wasn’t found, then?"</p>

<p>"No, it wasn’t found."</p>

<p>"No clues of any kind?"</p>

<p>"Well, we’ve got this."</p>

<p>Rather after the manner of a conjurer, Superintendent Battle
produced a half-sheet of notepaper. And, as he did so, he again
watched Anthony closely without seeming to do so.</p>

<p>But Anthony recognized the design upon it without any sign of
consternation.</p>

<p>"Aha! Comrades of the Red Hand again. If they’re going to scatter
this sort of thing about, they ought to have it lithographed.
It must be a frightful nuisance doing every one separately. Where
was this found?"</p>

<p>"Underneath the body. You’ve seen it before, sir?"</p>

<p>Anthony recounted to him in detail his short encounter with that
public-spirited association.</p>

<p>"The idea is, I suppose, that the Comrades did him in."</p>

<p>"Do you think it likely, sir?"</p>

<p>"Well, it would be in keeping with their propaganda. But I’ve
always found that those who talk most about blood have never actually
seen it run. I shouldn’t have said the Comrades had the guts myself.
And they’re such picturesque people too. I don’t see one of them
disguising himself as a suitable guest for a country house. Still,
one never knows."</p>

<p>"Quite right, Mr. Cade. One never knows."</p>

<p>Anthony looked suddenly amused.</p>

<p>"I see the big idea now. Open window, trail of footprints, suspicious
stranger at village inn. But I can assure you, my dear superintendent,
that, whatever I am, I am not the local agent of the Red Hand."</p>

<p>Superintendent Battle smiled a little. Then he played his last
card.</p>

<p>"Would you have any objection to seeing the body?" he shot out
suddenly.</p>

<p>"None whatever," rejoined Anthony.</p>

<p>Battle took a key from his pocket, and preceding Anthony down
the corridor, paused at a door and unlocked it. It was one of
the smaller drawing-rooms. The body lay on a table covered with
a sheet.</p>

<p>Superintendent Battle waited until Anthony was beside him, and
then whisked away the sheet suddenly.</p>

<p>An eager light sprang into his eyes at the half-uttered exclamation
and the start of surprise which the other gave.</p>

<p>"So you <em>do</em> recognize him, Mr. Cade," he said, in a voice
that he strove to render devoid of triumph.</p>

<p>"I’ve seen him before, yes," said Anthony, recovering himself.
"But not as Prince Michael Obolovitch. He purported to come from
Messrs. Balderson and Hodgkins, and he called himself Mr. Holmes."</p>
