PRESENTLY they knew that no firing threat-
ened them.  All ways seemed once more opened
to them.  The dusty blue lines of their friends
were disclosed a short distance away.  In the
distance there were many colossal noises, but in
all this part of the field there was a sudden
stillness.
<P>
They perceived that they were free.  The
depleted band drew a long breath of relief
and gathered itself into a bunch to complete
its trip.
<P>
In this last length of journey the men began
to show strange emotions.  They hurried with
nervous fear.  Some who had been dark and un-
faltering in the grimmest moments now could not
conceal an anxiety that made them frantic.  It
was perhaps that they dreaded to be killed in
insignificant ways after the times for proper
military deaths had passed.  Or, perhaps, they
thought it would be too ironical to get killed at
<P>

the portals of safety.  With backward looks of
perturbation, they hastened.
<P>
As they approached their own lines there was
some sarcasm exhibited on the part of a gaunt
and bronzed regiment that lay resting in the
shade of trees.  Questions were wafted to them.
<P>
"Where th' hell yeh been?"
<P>
"What yeh comin' back fer?"
<P>
"Why didn't yeh stay there?"
<P>
"Was it warm out there, sonny?"
<P>
"Goin' home now, boys?"
<P>
One shouted in taunting mimicry: "Oh,
mother, come quick an' look at th' sojers!"
<P>
There was no reply from the bruised and bat-
tered regiment, save that one man made broad-
cast challenges to fist fights and the red-bearded
officer walked rather near and glared in great
swashbuckler style at a tall captain in the other
regiment.  But the lieutenant suppressed the
man who wished to fist fight, and the tall cap-
tain, flushing at the little fanfare of the red-
bearded one, was obliged to look intently at some
trees.
<P>
The youth's tender flesh was deeply stung by
these remarks.  From under his creased brows
he glowered with hate at the mockers.  He
meditated upon a few revenges.  Still, many in
the regiment hung their heads in criminal fashion,
so that it came to pass that the men trudged with
sudden heaviness, as if they bore upon their
bended shoulders the coffin of their honor.  And
the youthful lieutenant, recollecting himself, be-
gan to mutter softly in black curses.
<P>
They turned when they arrived at their old
position to regard the ground over which they
had charged.
<P>
The youth in this contemplation was smitten
with a large astonishment.  He discovered that
the distances, as compared with the brilliant
measurings of his mind, were trivial and ridicu-
lous.  The stolid trees, where much had taken
place, seemed incredibly near.  The time, too,
now that he reflected, he saw to have been short.
He wondered at the number of emotions and
events that had been crowded into such little
spaces.  Elfin thoughts must have exaggerated
and enlarged everything, he said.
<P>
It seemed, then, that there was bitter justice
in the speeches of the gaunt and bronzed vet-
erans.  He veiled a glance of disdain at his fel-
lows who strewed the ground, choking with dust,
red from perspiration, misty-eyed, disheveled.
<P>
They were gulping at their canteens, fierce to
wring every mite of water from them, and they
polished at their swollen and watery features
with coat sleeves and bunches of grass.
<P>
However, to the youth there was a consider-
able joy in musing upon his performances during
the charge.  He had had very little time pre-
viously in which to appreciate himself, so that
there was now much satisfaction in quietly think-
ing of his actions.  He recalled bits of color that
in the flurry had stamped themselves unawares
upon his engaged senses.
<P>
As the regiment lay heaving from its hot exer-
tions the officer who had named them as mule
drivers came galloping along the line.  He had
lost his cap.  His tousled hair streamed wildly,
and his face was dark with vexation and wrath.
His temper was displayed with more clearness
by the way in which he managed his horse.  He
jerked and wrenched savagely at his bridle, stop-
ping the hard-breathing animal with a furious
pull near the colonel of the regiment.  He im-
mediately exploded in reproaches which came
unbidden to the ears of the men.  They were
suddenly alert, being always curious about black
words between officers.
<P>
"Oh, thunder, MacChesnay, what an awful
bull you made of this thing!" began the officer.
He attempted low tones, but his indignation
caused certain of the men to learn the sense of
his words.  "What an awful mess you made!
Good Lord, man, you stopped about a hun-
dred feet this side of a very pretty success!  If
your men had gone a hundred feet farther you
would have made a great charge, but as it is
--what a lot of mud diggers you've got any-
way!"
<P>
The men, listening with bated breath, now
turned their curious eyes upon the colonel.
They had a ragamuffin interest in this affair.
<P>
The colonel was seen to straighten his form
and put one hand forth in oratorical fashion.
He wore an injured air; it was as if a deacon
had been accused of stealing.  The men were
wiggling in an ecstasy of excitement.
<P>
But of a sudden the colonel's manner changed
from that of a deacon to that of a Frenchman.
He shrugged his shoulders.  "Oh, well, general,
we went as far as we could," he said calmly.
<P>
"As far as you could?  Did you, b'Gawd?"
snorted the other.  "Well, that wasn't very far,
was it?" he added, with a glance of cold con-
tempt into the other's eyes.  "Not very far, I
think.  You were intended to make a diversion
in favor of Whiterside.  How well you succeeded
your own ears can now tell you."  He wheeled
his horse and rode stiffly away.
<P>
The colonel, bidden to hear the jarring noises
of an engagement in the woods to the left, broke
out in vague damnations.
<P>
The lieutenant, who had listened with an air
of impotent rage to the interview, spoke suddenly
in firm and undaunted tones.  "I don't care what
a man is--whether he is a general or what--if
he says th' boys didn't put up a good fight out
there he's a damned fool."
<P>
"Lieutenant," began the colonel, severely,
"this is my own affair, and I'll trouble you--"
<P>
The lieutenant made an obedient gesture.
"All right, colonel, all right," he said.  He sat
down with an air of being content with him-
self.
<P>
The news that the regiment had been re-
proached went along the line.  For a time the
men were bewildered by it.  "Good thunder!"
they ejaculated, staring at the vanishing form of
the general.  They conceived it to be a huge
mistake.
<P>
Presently, however, they began to believe that
in truth their efforts had been called light.  The
youth could see this conviction weigh upon the
entire regiment until the men were like cuffed
and cursed animals, but withal rebellious.
<P>
The friend, with a grievance in his eye,
went to the youth.  "I wonder what he does
want," he said.  "He must think we went out
there an' played marbles!  I never see sech a
man!"
<P>
The youth developed a tranquil philosophy
for these moments of irritation.  "Oh, well," he
rejoined, "he probably didn't see nothing of it at
all and got mad as blazes, and concluded we were
a lot of sheep, just because we didn't do what he
wanted done.  It's a pity old Grandpa Hender-
son got killed yestirday--he'd have known that
we did our best and fought good.  It's just our
awful luck, that's what."
<P>
"I should say so," replied the friend.  He
seemed to be deeply wounded at an injustice.
"I should say we did have awful luck!  There's
no fun in fightin' fer people when everything
yeh do--no matter what--ain't done right.  I
have a notion t' stay behind next time an' let
'em take their ol' charge an' go t' th' devil
with it."
<P>
The youth spoke soothingly to his comrade.
"Well, we both did good.  I'd like to see the
fool what'd say we both didn't do as good as we
could!"
<P>
"Of course we did," declared the friend
stoutly.  "An' I'd break th' feller's neck if he was
as big as a church.  But we're all right, anyhow,
for I heard one feller say that we two fit th' best
in th' reg'ment, an' they had a great argument
'bout it.  Another feller, 'a course, he had t' up
an' say it was a lie--he seen all what was goin'
on an' he never seen us from th' beginnin' t' th'
end.  An' a lot more struck in an' ses it wasn't
a lie--we did fight like thunder, an' they give
us quite a send-off.  But this is what I can't
stand--these everlastin' ol' soldiers, titterin' an'
laughin', an' then that general, he's crazy."
<P>
The youth exclaimed with sudden exaspera-
tion: "He's a lunkhead!  He makes me mad.
I wish he'd come along next time.  We'd show
'im what--"
<P>
He ceased because several men had come
hurrying up.  Their faces expressed a bringing
of great news.
<P>
"O Flem, yeh jest oughta heard!" cried one,
eagerly.
<P>
"Heard what?" said the youth.
<P>
"Yeh jest oughta heard!" repeated the other,
and he arranged himself to tell his tidings.  The
others made an excited circle.  "Well, sir, th'
colonel met your lieutenant right by us--it was
damnedest thing I ever heard--an' he ses: 'Ahem!
ahem!' he ses.  'Mr. Hasbrouck!' he ses, 'by
th' way, who was that lad what carried th' flag?'
he ses.  There, Flemin', what d' yeh think 'a
that?  'Who was th' lad what carried th' flag?'
he ses, an' th' lieutenant, he speaks up right
away: 'That's Flemin', an' he's a jimhickey,' he
ses, right away.  What?  I say he did.  'A jim-
hickey,' he ses--those 'r his words.  He did, too.
I say he did.  If you kin tell this story better
than I kin, go ahead an' tell it.  Well, then, keep
yer mouth shet.  Th' lieutenant, he ses: 'He's a
jimhickey,' an' th' colonel, he ses: 'Ahem! ahem!
he is, indeed, a very good man t' have, ahem!  He
kep' th' flag 'way t' th' front.  I saw 'im.  He's a
good un,' ses th' colonel.  'You bet,' ses th' lieu-
tenant, 'he an' a feller named Wilson was at th'
head 'a th' charge, an' howlin' like Indians all th'
time,' he ses.  'Head 'a th' charge all th' time,'
he ses.  'A feller named Wilson,' he ses.  There,
Wilson, m'boy, put that in a letter an' send it
hum t' yer mother, hay?  'A feller named Wil-
son,' he ses.  An' th' colonel, he ses: 'Were they,
indeed?  Ahem! ahem!  My sakes!' he ses.  'At
th' head 'a th' reg'ment?' he ses.  'They were,'
ses th' lieutenant.  'My sakes!' ses th' colonel.
He ses: 'Well, well, well,' he ses, 'those two
babies?'  'They were,' ses th' lieutenant.
'Well, well,' ses th' colonel, 'they deserve t' be
major generals,' he ses.  'They deserve t' be
major-generals.'
<P>
The youth and his friend had said: "Huh!"
"Yer lyin', Thompson."  "Oh, go t' blazes!"
"He never sed it."  "Oh, what a lie!"  "Huh!"
But despite these youthful scoffings and embar-
rassments, they knew that their faces were deeply
flushing from thrills of pleasure.  They ex-
changed a secret glance of joy and congratula-
tion.
<P>
They speedily forgot many things.  The past
held no pictures of error and disappointment.
They were very happy, and their hearts swelled
with grateful affection for the colonel and the
youthful lieutenant.
