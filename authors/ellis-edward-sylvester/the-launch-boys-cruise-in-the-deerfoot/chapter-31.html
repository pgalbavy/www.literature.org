<p>You know there are some people who can never keep a secret. We
have all met them, much to our disgust. George, the "chauffeur"
of the little runabout launch <em>Shark</em>, was such a person.
Possibly when he gave his promise to Alvin Landon and Chester
Haynes not to reveal what then seemed the fate of Mike Murphy,
he meant to do as he said, but somehow or other he was not equal
to the task.</p>

<p>He kept mum on the dreadful subject until he had secured his
boat and walked up the street past Hodgdon's well-known store,
when he met an acquaintance with whom he briefly chatted. By the
time they had finished, he had told him, under a solemn pledge
to mention it to no one, all about the sad death of the Irish
lad from drowning. Within the following hour this friend told
the story to three others, all of whom agreed upon their sacred
honor to say nothing about it to anyone. They kept the promise
as well as George himself, who broke it three or four times more
in the period named. One of the depositaries of the gruesome news
was the guard who stood watch over the <em>Deerfoot</em>, while
the owner and his companions went to the hotel to see that the
hunger of the marooned young gentleman was appeased. This statement
will explain the curious glances at the little group as they moved
about the town, as well as the remark of the guard upon their
return to the motor boat.</p>

<p>As night approached, George was impressed with his duty of acquainting
the parents of Mike with the dreadful blow that had befallen them.
They must hear of it sooner or later, and it was best that they
should get it straight. Accordingly he motored thither, completing
what I fear was not an unwelcome task in time to meet the <em>Deerfoot</em>
engaged on the same errand. Of course he heard the hail of Chester.
He did not reply, for he was in no mood to make explanations and
receive censure for what he had done from a high sense of duty&mdash;as
the offender always insists in similar circumstances.</p>

<p>Everything was so plain to Alvin and Chester that throughout
the conversation that followed their entrance into the home of
Pat Murphy, they did not once ask the much afflicted parents of
the source from which they had received their information.</p>

<p>The father was sitting in his chair at the side of the room bowed
and silent in grief that was too deep for him to seek solace from
his pipe. The wife sat on the other side of the room, rocking
to and fro, flinging her apron over her face, the tears flowing
down her cheeks, and her features twisted with anguish. So absorbed
were they in their sorrow that they hardly glanced at the boys
and did not address them.</p>

<p>Alvin could not restrain his sympathy at sight of the suffering
of the couple, the father's none the less than the mother's because
it was mute. The youth's promise to Mike was thrown to the winds
and he called out:</p>

<p>"Stop your mourning! Mike hasn't been drowned!"</p>

<p>"Phwat's that ye say?" demanded the father, who half rising from
his chair was staring at the lad as if doubting the words that
had reached him. The wife, grasping each side of her apron with
a hand and about to fling it upward, was equally quick in checking
herself and with her mouth wide open she hoarsely exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Phwat! Say that agin!"</p>

<p>"Mike is alive and well as he ever was in his life."</p>

<p>They still stared, dazed and unable for the moment to speak another
word. The callers sat down.</p>

<p>"I say again that Mike is well and safe. He spent last night
on a little island not many miles away and we brought him back
in the <em>Deerfoot</em>."</p>

<p>The mother still gazed and clutched her apron. Her husband showed
that he caught the meaning of what he had heard.</p>

<p>"And where is Mike?"</p>

<p>The question recalled Alvin's promise to pave the way for his
friend's return to his home.</p>

<p>"Before I tell you," said the Captain, "you must give me your
pledge that you will not punish him for what happened last night.
Will you do so?"</p>

<p>"That I will," was the unhesitating answer. "He desarves a licking,
but we'll call it square&mdash;that is," was the qualifying condition,
"so far as <em>this</em> thing is consarned."</p>

<p>"What! lick me baby Mike!" exclaimed the glad mother; "not in
a thousand years! Where is the darlint that I may kiss the hid
off him?"</p>

<p>"Remember, Pat, what you just said. Mike isn't to be blamed for
what took place and you should be as thankful&#11834;"</p>

<p>Just then a terrific crash was heard in the kitchen, the door
to which was closed. The mother, in her highly wrought state,
screamed and sprang to her feet. Her husband snatched up the candle
from the stand in the middle of the room and ran to learn what
the uproar meant, with his wife just behind him.</p>

<p>It seemed to be a night for the general breaking of promises.
It will be remembered that Mike had agreed to stay on board the
<em>Deerfoot</em> until he saw the door of his home opened by
one of his friends and heard a whistle as notice that the path
had been cleared and he might go forward. The two, however, had
hardly entered the building when Mike changed his mind. With a
refreshing forgetfulness of what he had lately passed through,
he said:</p>

<p>"It's mesilf that is in danger of catching a cowld in my hid,
as Larry McCarty said after slaaping in an ice box, and in stepping
ashore, I may as well step a little furder."</p>

<p>Thus it came about that Alvin and Chester were no more than fairly
inside the small house when Mike moved softly to the door and
listened to the voices within. He was disappointed in not being
able to distinguish everything said, though it will be recalled
that no one spoke in whispers.</p>

<p>Suddenly it occurred to the boy that he could do much better
if within the house itself. The darkness of the kitchen showed
that the door connecting that with the sitting room was closed.
He knew he could hear more plainly from the smaller room.</p>

<p>Being in darkness, he had to depend upon the sense of feeling.
It was no trouble to raise the sash without making any noise.
When lifted well up, the catch held it in place and he began crawling
stealthily through. He saw the thin line of light under the door
and heard what was being said on the other side. Knowing the room
so well he needed no illumination to guide him. He balanced himself
for a moment and then dropped lightly to the floor. More properly
he tried to do so, but unaware of the chair in his way, he tumbled
over that, which in turn tumbled over him, and caused the crash
that startled those in the sitting room and brought his parents
to learn what it all meant.</p>

<p>One glance at the sturdy figure struggling to his feet and muttering
impatient exclamations told the mother who he was. Thrusting her
husband aside, she rushed forward, straightened up the overturned
chair, and dropping into it, seized her boy with both arms:</p>

<p>"Praised be! Me own darlint! Me baby! Bliss yer heart!"</p>

<p>She was striving frantically to pull him upon her lap and would
have succeeded had Mike not been larger than she and strongly
opposed to acting the part of an infant. There was good-natured
strife between them for a minute or two, with the laughing father
and two youths looking on. Then Mike triumphed, forced his parent
upon one knee, and with an arm around her ample waist began bouncing
her up and down with a vigor that broke her words apart, though
it did not prevent her from grasping him about his neck and crying
with joy.</p>

<p>"Arrah, mither, but it's yersilf that makes a fine barrel of
jelly. Hist now! can't ye sit still," he protested, bouncing her
harder than ever.</p>

<p>Alvin and Chester held their sides, for it was the funniest spectacle
upon which they had ever looked. By and by Mike released the happy
victim, and all returned to the larger room, where they sat down.
Alvin said:</p>

<p>"It's been fixed, Mike. The slate is wiped out up to this night.
You and your father begin over again in the morning."</p>

<p>"Does he spake the thruth, dad?" asked the lad gravely.</p>

<p>"Alvin always does the same, but ye can make up yer moind ye'll
be in my debt afore the morrow's night."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it, as Barney Foord said whin he was voted the
biggest fool in siven counties. Whisht!"</p>

<p>A timid knock sounded and Mike sprang up and opened the outer
door. Mollie, one of the maids, stood smiling.</p>

<p>"There's a gintleman waiting fur ye at home," she explained.</p>

<p>"Waiting to see me?" repeated the surprised Alvin, rising to
his feet.</p>

<p>"That's what he said and he will bide till ye returns."</p>

<p>"Well, good night, folks!" called Alvin to the happy family.
"Come, Chester."</p>

<p>The two went out together, wondering who the caller could be.
The brief distance was quickly traversed, and, passing through
the front door, they turned into the handsomely furnished library.</p>

<p>As the lads entered, a man rose.</p>

<p>"You are Alvin Landon, I believe," he inquired, "and you," turning
to his companion, "are his friend, Chester Haynes."</p>

<p>If ever two youths were astonished, when they made courteous
reply to the salutation, they were our young friends, for the
caller who thus addressed them was the man in gray that had followed
them to the inlet on Barter Island and had now come to Alvin's
home at Southport.</p>

<p>"If you can spare me a few minutes I have something of importance
to say to you," he added as he took the seat to which Alvin waved
him.</p>

<p>It proved an important interview indeed, but the revelation made
by the man in gray and the events which followed there-from will
be told in the second volume of the Launch Boys Series entitled
"The Launch Boys' Adventures in Northern Waters."</p>

<p><em>THE END</em>.</p>
