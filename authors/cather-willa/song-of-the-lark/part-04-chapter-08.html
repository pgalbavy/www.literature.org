<p>ON the first day of September Fred Ottenburg and Thea Kronborg left
Flagstaff by the east-bound express. As the bright morning advanced,
they sat alone on the rear platform of the observation car, watching the
yellow miles unfold and disappear. With complete content they saw the
brilliant, empty country flash by. They were tired of the desert and the
dead races, of a world without change or ideas. Fred said he was glad to
sit back and let the Santa Fe do the work for a while.
</p><p>“And where are we going, anyhow?” he added.
</p><p>“To Chicago, I suppose. Where else would we be going?” Thea hunted for a
handkerchief in her handbag.
</p><p>“I wasn't sure, so I had the trunks checked to Albuquerque. We can
recheck there to Chicago, if you like. Why Chicago? You'll never go back
to Bowers. Why wouldn't this be a good time to make a run for it? We
could take the southern branch at Albuquerque, down to El Paso, and then
over into Mexico. We are exceptionally free. Nobody waiting for us
anywhere.”
</p><p>Thea sighted along the steel rails that quivered in the light behind
them. “I don't see why I couldn't marry you in Chicago, as well as any
place,” she brought out with some embarrassment.
</p><p>Fred took the handbag out of her nervous clasp and swung it about on his
finger. “You've no particular love for that spot, have you? Besides, as
I've told you, my family would make a row. They are an excitable lot.
They discuss and argue everlastingly. The only way I can ever put
anything through is to go ahead, and convince them afterward.”
</p><p>“Yes; I understand. I don't mind that. I don't want to marry your
family. I'm sure you wouldn't want to marry mine. But I don't see why we
have to go so far.”
</p><p>“When we get to Winslow, you look about the freight yards and you'll
probably see several yellow cars with my name on them. That's why, my
dear. When your visiting-card is on every beer bottle, you can't do
things quietly. Things get into the papers.” As he watched her troubled
expression, he grew anxious. He leaned forward on his camp-chair, and
kept twirling the handbag between his knees. “Here's a suggestion,
Thea,” he said presently. “Dismiss it if you don't like it: suppose we
go down to Mexico on the chance. You've never seen anything like Mexico
City; it will be a lark for you, anyhow. If you change your mind, and
don't want to marry me, you can go back to Chicago, and I'll take a
steamer from Vera Cruz and go up to New York. When I get to Chicago,
you'll be at work, and nobody will ever be the wiser. No reason why we
shouldn't both travel in Mexico, is there? You'll be traveling alone.
I'll merely tell you the right places to stop, and come to take you
driving. I won't put any pressure on you. Have I ever?” He swung the bag
toward her and looked up under her hat.
</p><p>“No, you haven't,” she murmured. She was thinking that her own position
might be less difficult if he had used what he called pressure. He
clearly wished her to take the responsibility.
</p><p>“You have your own future in the back of your mind all the time,” Fred
began, “and I have it in mine. I'm not going to try to carry you off, as
I might another girl. If you wanted to quit me, I couldn't hold you, no
matter how many times you had married me. I don't want to overpersuade
you. But I'd like mighty well to get you down to that jolly old city,
where everything would please you, and give myself a chance. Then, if
you thought you could have a better time with me than without me, I'd
try to grab you before you changed your mind. You are not a sentimental
person.”
</p><p>Thea drew her veil down over her face. “I think I am, a little; about
you,” she said quietly. Fred's irony somehow hurt her.
</p><p>“What's at the bottom of your mind, Thea?” he asked hurriedly. “I can't
tell. Why do you consider it at all, if you're not sure? Why are you
here with me now?”
</p><p>Her face was half-averted. He was thinking that it looked older and more
firm--almost hard--under a veil.
</p><p>“Isn't it possible to do things without having any very clear reason?”
 she asked slowly. “I have no plan in the back of my mind. Now that I'm
with you, I want to be with you; that's all. I can't settle down to
being alone again. I am here to-day because I want to be with you
to-day.” She paused. “One thing, though; if I gave you my word, I'd keep
it. And you could hold me, though you don't seem to think so. Maybe I'm
not sentimental, but I'm not very light, either. If I went off with you
like this, it wouldn't be to amuse myself.”
</p><p>Ottenburg's eyes fell. His lips worked nervously for a moment. “Do you
mean that you really care for me, Thea Kronborg?” he asked unsteadily.
</p><p>“I guess so. It's like anything else. It takes hold of you and you've
got to go through with it, even if you're afraid. I was afraid to leave
Moonstone, and afraid to leave Harsanyi. But I had to go through with
it.”
</p><p>“And are you afraid now?” Fred asked slowly.
</p><p>“Yes; more than I've ever been. But I don't think I could go back. The
past closes up behind one, somehow. One would rather have a new kind of
misery. The old kind seems like death or unconsciousness. You can't
force your life back into that mould again. No, one can't go back.” She
rose and stood by the back grating of the platform, her hand on the
brass rail.
</p><p>Fred went to her side. She pushed up her veil and turned her most
glowing face to him. Her eyes were wet and there were tears on her
lashes, but she was smiling the rare, whole-hearted smile he had seen
once or twice before. He looked at her shining eyes, her parted lips,
her chin a little lifted. It was as if they were colored by a sunrise he
could not see. He put his hand over hers and clasped it with a strength
she felt. Her eyelashes trembled, her mouth softened, but her eyes were
still brilliant.
</p><p>“Will you always be like you were down there, if I go with you?” she
asked under her breath.
</p><p>His fingers tightened on hers. “By God, I will!” he muttered.
</p><p>“That's the only promise I'll ask you for. Now go away for a while and
let me think about it. Come back at lunchtime and I'll tell you. Will
that do?”
</p><p>“Anything will do, Thea, if you'll only let me keep an eye on you. The
rest of the world doesn't interest me much. You've got me in deep.”
</p><p>Fred dropped her hand and turned away. As he glanced back from the front
end of the observation car, he saw that she was still standing there,
and any one would have known that she was brooding over something. The
earnestness of her head and shoulders had a certain nobility. He stood
looking at her for a moment.
</p><p>When he reached the forward smoking-car, Fred took a seat at the end,
where he could shut the other passengers from his sight. He put on his
traveling-cap and sat down wearily, keeping his head near the window.
“In any case, I shall help her more than I shall hurt her,” he kept
saying to himself. He admitted that this was not the only motive which
impelled him, but it was one of them. “I'll make it my business in life
to get her on. There's nothing else I care about so much as seeing her
have her chance. She hasn't touched her real force yet. She isn't even
aware of it. Lord, don't I know something about them? There isn't one of
them that has such a depth to draw from. She'll be one of the great
artists of our time. Playing accompaniments for that cheese-faced sneak!
I'll get her off to Germany this winter, or take her. She hasn't got any
time to waste now. I'll make it up to her, all right.”
</p><p>Ottenburg certainly meant to make it up to her, in so far as he could.
His feeling was as generous as strong human feelings are likely to be.
The only trouble was, that he was married already, and had been since he
was twenty.
</p><p>His older friends in Chicago, people who had been friends of his family,
knew of the unfortunate state of his personal affairs; but they were
people whom in the natural course of things Thea Kronborg would scarcely
meet. Mrs. Frederick Ottenburg lived in California, at Santa Barbara,
where her health was supposed to be better than elsewhere, and her
husband lived in Chicago. He visited his wife every winter to reinforce
her position, and his devoted mother, although her hatred for her
daughter-inlaw was scarcely approachable in words, went to Santa Barbara
every year to make things look better and to relieve her son.
</p>
<p>When Frederick Ottenburg was beginning his junior year at Harvard, he
got a letter from Dick Brisbane, a Kansas City boy he knew, telling him
that his FIANCEE, Miss Edith Beers, was going to New York to buy her
trousseau. She would be at the Holland House, with her aunt and a girl
from Kansas City who was to be a bridesmaid, for two weeks or more. If
Ottenburg happened to be going down to New York, would he call upon Miss
Beers and “show her a good time”?
</p><p>Fred did happen to be going to New York. He was going down from New
Haven, after the Thanksgiving game. He called on Miss Beers and found
her, as he that night telegraphed Brisbane, a “ripping beauty, no
mistake.” He took her and her aunt and her uninteresting friend to the
theater and to the opera, and he asked them to lunch with him at the
Waldorf. He took no little pains in arranging the luncheon with the head
waiter. Miss Beers was the sort of girl with whom a young man liked to
seem experienced. She was dark and slender and fiery. She was witty and
slangy; said daring things and carried them off with NONCHALANCE. Her
childish extravagance and contempt for all the serious facts of life
could be charged to her father's generosity and his long packing-house
purse. Freaks that would have been vulgar and ostentatious in a more
simpleminded girl, in Miss Beers seemed whimsical and picturesque. She
darted about in magnificent furs and pumps and close-clinging gowns,
though that was the day of full skirts. Her hats were large and floppy.
When she wriggled out of her moleskin coat at luncheon, she looked like
a slim black weasel. Her satin dress was a mere sheath, so conspicuous
by its severity and scantness that every one in the dining-room stared.
She ate nothing but alligator-pear salad and hothouse grapes, drank a
little champagne, and took cognac in her coffee. She ridiculed, in the
raciest slang, the singers they had heard at the opera the night before,
and when her aunt pretended to reprove her, she murmured indifferently,
“What's the matter with you, old sport?” She rattled on with a subdued
loquaciousness, always keeping her voice low and monotonous, always
looking out of the corner of her eye and speaking, as it were, in
asides, out of the corner of her mouth. She was scornful of
everything,--which became her eyebrows. Her face was mobile and
discontented, her eyes quick and black. There was a sort of smouldering
fire about her, young Ottenburg thought. She entertained him
prodigiously.
</p><p>After luncheon Miss Beers said she was going uptown to be fitted, and
that she would go alone because her aunt made her nervous. When Fred
held her coat for her, she murmured, “Thank you, Alphonse,” as if she
were addressing the waiter. As she stepped into a hansom, with a long
stretch of thin silk stocking, she said negligently, over her fur
collar, “Better let me take you along and drop you somewhere.” He sprang
in after her, and she told the driver to go to the Park.
</p><p>It was a bright winter day, and bitterly cold. Miss Beers asked Fred to
tell her about the game at New Haven, and when he did so paid no
attention to what he said. She sank back into the hansom and held her
muff before her face, lowering it occasionally to utter laconic remarks
about the people in the carriages they passed, interrupting Fred's
narrative in a disconcerting manner. As they entered the Park he
happened to glance under her wide black hat at her black eyes and
hair--the muff hid everything else--and discovered that she was crying.
To his solicitous inquiry she replied that it “was enough to make you
damp, to go and try on dresses to marry a man you weren't keen about.”
</p><p>Further explanations followed. She had thought she was “perfectly
cracked” about Brisbane, until she met Fred at the Holland House three
days ago. Then she knew she would scratch Brisbane's eyes out if she
married him. What was she going to do?
</p><p>Fred told the driver to keep going. What did she want to do? Well, she
didn't know. One had to marry somebody, after all the machinery had been
put in motion. Perhaps she might as well scratch Brisbane as anybody
else; for scratch she would, if she didn't get what she wanted.
</p><p>Of course, Fred agreed, one had to marry somebody. And certainly this
girl beat anything he had ever been up against before. Again he told the
driver to go ahead. Did she mean that she would think of marrying him,
by any chance? Of course she did, Alphonse. Hadn't he seen that all over
her face three days ago? If he hadn't, he was a snowball.
</p><p>By this time Fred was beginning to feel sorry for the driver. Miss
Beers, however, was compassionless. After a few more turns, Fred
suggested tea at the Casino. He was very cold himself, and remembering
the shining silk hose and pumps, he wondered that the girl was not
frozen. As they got out of the hansom, he slipped the driver a bill and
told him to have something hot while he waited.
</p><p>At the tea-table, in a snug glass enclosure, with the steam sputtering
in the pipes beside them and a brilliant winter sunset without, they
developed their plan. Miss Beers had with her plenty of money, destined
for tradesmen, which she was quite willing to divert into other
channels--the first excitement of buying a trousseau had worn off,
anyway. It was very much like any other shopping. Fred had his allowance
and a few hundred he had won on the game. She would meet him to-morrow
morning at the Jersey ferry. They could take one of the west-bound
Pennsylvania trains and go--anywhere, some place where the laws weren't
too fussy.--Fred had not even thought about the laws!--It would be all
right with her father; he knew Fred's family.
</p><p>Now that they were engaged, she thought she would like to drive a little
more. They were jerked about in the cab for another hour through the
deserted Park. Miss Beers, having removed her hat, reclined upon Fred's
shoulder.
</p><p>The next morning they left Jersey City by the latest fast train out.
They had some misadventures, crossed several States before they found a
justice obliging enough to marry two persons whose names automatically
instigated inquiry. The bride's family were rather pleased with her
originality; besides, any one of the Ottenburg boys was clearly a better
match than young Brisbane. With Otto Ottenburg, however, the affair went
down hard, and to his wife, the once proud Katarina Furst, such a
disappointment was almost unbearable. Her sons had always been clay in
her hands, and now the GELIEBTER SOHN had escaped her.
</p><p>Beers, the packer, gave his daughter a house in St. Louis, and Fred went
into his father's business. At the end of a year, he was mutely
appealing to his mother for sympathy. At the end of two, he was drinking
and in open rebellion. He had learned to detest his wife. Her
wastefulness and cruelty revolted him. The ignorance and the fatuous
conceit which lay behind her grimacing mask of slang and ridicule
humiliated him so deeply that he became absolutely reckless. Her grace
was only an uneasy wriggle, her audacity was the result of insolence and
envy, and her wit was restless spite. As her personal mannerisms grew
more and more odious to him, he began to dull his perceptions with
champagne. He had it for tea, he drank it with dinner, and during the
evening he took enough to insure that he would be well insulated when he
got home. This behavior spread alarm among his friends. It was
scandalous, and it did not occur among brewers. He was violating the
NOBLESSE OBLIGE of his guild. His father and his father's partners
looked alarmed.
</p><p>When Fred's mother went to him and with clasped hands entreated an
explanation, he told her that the only trouble was that he couldn't hold
enough wine to make life endurable, so he was going to get out from
under and enlist in the navy. He didn't want anything but the shirt on
his back and clean salt air. His mother could look out; he was going to
make a scandal.
</p><p>Mrs. Otto Ottenburg went to Kansas City to see Mr. Beers, and had the
satisfaction of telling him that he had brought up his daughter like a
savage, EINE UNGEBILDETE. All the Ottenburgs and all the Beers, and many
of their friends, were drawn into the quarrel. It was to public opinion,
however and not to his mother's activities, that Fred owed his partial
escape from bondage. The cosmopolitan brewing world of St. Louis had
conservative standards. The Ottenburgs' friends were not predisposed in
favor of the plunging Kansas City set, and they disliked young Fred's
wife from the day that she was brought among them. They found her
ignorant and ill-bred and insufferably impertinent. When they became
aware of how matters were going between her and Fred, they omitted no
opportunity to snub her. Young Fred had always been popular, and St.
Louis people took up his cause with warmth. Even the younger men, among
whom Mrs. Fred tried to draft a following, at first avoided and then
ignored her. Her defeat was so conspicuous, her life became such a
desert, that she at last consented to accept the house in Santa Barbara
which Mrs. Otto Ottenburg had long owned and cherished. This villa, with
its luxuriant gardens, was the price of Fred's furlough. His mother was
only too glad to offer it in his behalf. As soon as his wife was
established in California, Fred was transferred from St. Louis to
Chicago.
</p><p>A divorce was the one thing Edith would never, never, give him. She told
him so, and she told his family so, and her father stood behind her. She
would enter into no arrangement that might eventually lead to divorce.
She had insulted her husband before guests and servants, had scratched
his face, thrown hand-mirrors and hairbrushes and nail-scissors at him
often enough, but she knew that Fred was hardly the fellow who would go
into court and offer that sort of evidence. In her behavior with other
men she was discreet.
</p><p>After Fred went to Chicago, his mother visited him often, and dropped a
word to her old friends there, who were already kindly disposed toward
the young man. They gossiped as little as was compatible with the
interest they felt, undertook to make life agreeable for Fred, and told
his story only where they felt it would do good: to girls who seemed to
find the young brewer attractive. So far, he had behaved well, and had
kept out of entanglements.
</p><p>Since he was transferred to Chicago, Fred had been abroad several times,
and had fallen more and more into the way of going about among young
artists,--people with whom personal relations were incidental. With
women, and even girls, who had careers to follow, a young man might have
pleasant friendships without being regarded as a prospective suitor or
lover. Among artists his position was not irregular, because with them
his marriageableness was not an issue. His tastes, his enthusiasm, and
his agreeable personality made him welcome.
</p><p>With Thea Kronborg he had allowed himself more liberty than he usually
did in his friendships or gallantries with young artists, because she
seemed to him distinctly not the marrying kind. She impressed him as
equipped to be an artist, and to be nothing else; already directed,
concentrated, formed as to mental habit. He was generous and
sympathetic, and she was lonely and needed friendship; needed
cheerfulness. She had not much power of reaching out toward useful
people or useful experiences, did not see opportunities. She had no tact
about going after good positions or enlisting the interest of
influential persons. She antagonized people rather than conciliated
them. He discovered at once that she had a merry side, a robust humor
that was deep and hearty, like her laugh, but it slept most of the time
under her own doubts and the dullness of her life. She had not what is
called a “sense of humor.” That is, she had no intellectual humor; no
power to enjoy the absurdities of people, no relish of their
pretentiousness and inconsistencies--which only depressed her. But her
joviality, Fred felt, was an asset, and ought to be developed. He
discovered that she was more receptive and more effective under a
pleasant stimulus than she was under the gray grind which she considered
her salvation. She was still Methodist enough to believe that if a thing
were hard and irksome, it must be good for her. And yet, whatever she
did well was spontaneous. Under the least glow of excitement, as at Mrs.
Nathanmeyer's, he had seen the apprehensive, frowning drudge of Bowers's
studio flash into a resourceful and consciously beautiful woman.
</p><p>His interest in Thea was serious, almost from the first, and so sincere
that he felt no distrust of himself. He believed that he knew a great
deal more about her possibilities than Bowers knew, and he liked to
think that he had given her a stronger hold on life. She had never seen
herself or known herself as she did at Mrs. Nathanmeyer's musical
evenings. She had been a different girl ever since. He had not
anticipated that she would grow more fond of him than his immediate
usefulness warranted. He thought he knew the ways of artists, and, as he
said, she must have been “at it from her cradle.” He had imagined,
perhaps, but never really believed, that he would find her waiting for
him sometime as he found her waiting on the day he reached the Biltmer
ranch. Once he found her so--well, he did not pretend to be anything
more or less than a reasonably well-intentioned young man. A lovesick
girl or a flirtatious woman he could have handled easily enough. But a
personality like that, unconsciously revealing itself for the first time
under the exaltation of a personal feeling,--what could one do but watch
it? As he used to say to himself, in reckless moments back there in the
canyon, “You can't put out a sunrise.” He had to watch it, and then he
had to share it.
</p><p>Besides, was he really going to do her any harm? The Lord knew he would
marry her if he could! Marriage would be an incident, not an end with
her; he was sure of that. If it were not he, it would be some one else;
some one who would be a weight about her neck, probably; who would hold
her back and beat her down and divert her from the first plunge for
which he felt she was gathering all her energies. He meant to help her,
and he could not think of another man who would. He went over his
unmarried friends, East and West, and he could not think of one who
would know what she was driving at--or care. The clever ones were
selfish, the kindly ones were stupid.
</p><p>“Damn it, if she's going to fall in love with somebody, it had better be
me than any of the others--of the sort she'd find. Get her tied up with
some conceited ass who'd try to make her over, train her like a puppy!
Give one of 'em a big nature like that, and he'd be horrified. He
wouldn't show his face in the clubs until he'd gone after her and combed
her down to conform to some fool idea in his own head--put there by some
other woman, too, his first sweetheart or his grandmother or a maiden
aunt. At least, I understand her. I know what she needs and where she's
bound, and I mean to see that she has a fighting chance.”
</p><p>His own conduct looked crooked, he admitted; but he asked himself
whether, between men and women, all ways were not more or less crooked.
He believed those which are called straight were the most dangerous of
all. They seemed to him, for the most part, to lie between windowless
stone walls, and their rectitude had been achieved at the expense of
light and air. In their unquestioned regularity lurked every sort of
human cruelty and meanness, and every kind of humiliation and suffering.
He would rather have any woman he cared for wounded than crushed. He
would deceive her not once, he told himself fiercely, but a hundred
times, to keep her free.
</p>
<p>When Fred went back to the observation car at one o'clock, after the
luncheon call, it was empty, and he found Thea alone on the platform.
She put out her hand, and met his eyes.
</p><p>“It's as I said. Things have closed behind me. I can't go back, so I am
going on--to Mexico?” She lifted her face with an eager, questioning
smile.
</p><p>Fred met it with a sinking heart. Had he really hoped she would give him
another answer? He would have given pretty much anything--But there,
that did no good. He could give only what he had. Things were never
complete in this world; you had to snatch at them as they came or go
without. Nobody could look into her face and draw back, nobody who had
any courage. She had courage enough for anything--look at her mouth and
chin and eyes! Where did it come from, that light? How could a face, a
familiar face, become so the picture of hope, be painted with the very
colors of youth's exaltation? She was right; she was not one of those
who draw back. Some people get on by avoiding dangers, others by riding
through them.
</p><p>They stood by the railing looking back at the sand levels, both feeling
that the train was steaming ahead very fast. Fred's mind was a confusion
of images and ideas. Only two things were clear to him: the force of her
determination, and the belief that, handicapped as he was, he could do
better by her than another man would do. He knew he would always
remember her, standing there with that expectant, forward-looking smile,
enough to turn the future into summer.
