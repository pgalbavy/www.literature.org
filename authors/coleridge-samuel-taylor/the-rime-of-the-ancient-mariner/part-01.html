		<p>It is an ancient Mariner,<br />
			And he stoppeth one of three.<br />
			"By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,<br />
			Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?
		</p>
		<p>"The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,<br />
			And I am next of kin;<br />
			The guests are met, the feast is set:<br />
			May'st hear the merry din."
		</p>
		<p>He holds him with his skinny hand,<br />
			"There was a ship," quoth he.<br />
			"Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!"<br />
			Eftsoons his hand dropt he.
		</p>
		<p>He holds him with his glittering eye--<br />
			The Wedding-Guest stood still,<br />
			And listens like a three years child:<br />
			The Mariner hath his will.
		</p>
		<p>The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:<br />
			He cannot chuse but hear;<br />
			And thus spake on that ancient man,<br />
			The bright-eyed Mariner.
		</p>
		<p>The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,<br />
			Merrily did we drop<br />
			Below the kirk, below the hill,<br />
			Below the light-house top.
		</p>
		<p>The Sun came up upon the left,<br />
			Out of the sea came he!<br />
			And he shone bright, and on the right<br />
			Went down into the sea.
		</p>
		<p>Higher and higher every day,<br />
			Till over the mast at noon--<br />
			The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,<br />
			For he heard the loud bassoon.
		</p>
		<p>The bride hath paced into the hall,<br />
			Red as a rose is she;<br />
			Nodding their heads before her goes<br />
			The merry minstrelsy.
		</p>
		<p>The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,<br />
			Yet he cannot chuse but hear;<br />
			And thus spake on that ancient man,<br />
			The bright-eyed Mariner.
		</p>
		<p>And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he<br />
			Was tyrannous and strong:<br />
			He struck with his o'ertaking wings,<br />
			And chased south along.
		</p>
		<p>With sloping masts and dipping prow,<br />
			As who pursued with yell and blow<br />
			Still treads the shadow of his foe<br />
			And forward bends his head,<br />
			The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,<br />
			And southward aye we fled.
		</p>
		<p>And now there came both mist and snow,<br />
			And it grew wondrous cold:<br />
			And ice, mast-high, came floating by,<br />
			As green as emerald.
		</p>
		<p>And through the drifts the snowy clifts<br />
			Did send a dismal sheen:<br />
			Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken--<br />
			The ice was all between.
		</p>
		<p>The ice was here, the ice was there,<br />
			The ice was all around:<br />
			It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,<br />
			Like noises in a swound!
		</p>
		<p>At length did cross an Albatross:<br />
			Thorough the fog it came;<br />
			As if it had been a Christian soul,<br />
			We hailed it in God's name.
		</p>
		<p>It ate the food it ne'er had eat,<br />
			And round and round it flew.<br />
			The ice did split with a thunder-fit;<br />
			The helmsman steered us through!
		</p>
		<p>And a good south wind sprung up behind;<br />
			The Albatross did follow,<br />
			And every day, for food or play,<br />
			Came to the mariners' hollo!
		</p>
		<p>In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,<br />
			It perched for vespers nine;<br />
			Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,<br />
			Glimmered the white Moon-shine.
		</p>
		<p>"God save thee, ancient Mariner!<br />
			From the fiends, that plague thee thus!--<br />
			Why look'st thou so?"--With my cross-bow<br />
			I shot the ALBATROSS.
