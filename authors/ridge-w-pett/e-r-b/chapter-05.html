<p>ERB entered upon his duties with appetite.  The single office of the new
society was a spare room over a coffee tavern in Grange Road, and the
first disbursement was for the painting on the window in bold white
letters the full title of the society, with the added words, “Herbert
Barnes, secretary.”  (Young Louisa went five minutes out of her way,
morning and evening, in order to see this proclamation of her brother’s
name.)  To the office came Erb promptly every morning at an hour when the
attendants at the coffee-room were on their knees scrubbing, chairs set
high on tables, and forms on end against the walls, and the young women
were a good deal annoyed by the fact that Erb, in these circumstances,
bestowed on them none of the chaff and badinage which were as necessary
to their existence as the very air.  When he had gone through the post
letters—the more there were of these the more contented he was—and had
answered them on post-cards, he went out, fixing a notice on the door,
“Back Shortly.  Any messages leave at Bar,” and hurried to some railway
depot, or some point where railway carmen were likely to congregate,
hurrying non-members into becoming members, passing the word round in
regard to public meetings, hunting for grievances, and listening always,
even when some, with erroneous ideas of his duties, requested advice in
regard to some domestic trouble with lodgers, or insubordination on the
part of babes.  All this meant visits to Paddington, to Willesden, to
Dalston, to Poplar, to Nine Elms: it gave to him a fine sensation of
ruling London and, in some way, the thought that he was repairing errors
made by the Creator of the world.  He came in contact with the
white-haired Labour member of Parliament, and watched his manner closely;
the Labour member invited Erb one evening to the House of Commons, and
Erb found that the Labour member had for the House a style differing
entirely from that which he used in other places, measuring words with
care, speaking with deliberation, and avoiding all the colloquialisms and
the jagged sentences that made him popular when he addressed outdoor
meetings.  And as all young men starting the journey through life model
themselves on some one who has arrived, Erb determined to acquire this
admirable alternative manner.
</p>
<p>Thus it was that one Thursday evening he took courage by the hand, and
went Camberwell way to call again at the house where on his previous
visit he had made undignified departure because of a pair of rather
bright eyes.  He thought of her with some nervousness as he went down
Camberwell New Road, and, putting aside for a moment the serious matters,
gave himself the joy of reviewing his female acquaintances.  He had just
come to the sage decision that different women exacted entirely different
tributes, some demanding reverence, others admiration, and others
something more fervent, when he found himself at the gate and the uneven
path between the monumental statuary that led to the door of Professor
Danks’s house.  The street was one affecting to make a short cut to
Queen’s Road, Peckham, but it did not really make a short cut; within its
crescent form it included new model dwellings of a violent red, elderly
houses with red verandahs, a Liberal Club, and a chapel.  A part of the
road had undergone the process of being shopped, which is to say that the
long useless front gardens had been utilised, and anxious, empty,
unsuccessful young establishments came out to the pavement, expending all
their profits on gas, and making determined efforts either by placard or
minatory signs to persuade the passers-by that business was enormous, and
that it was with difficulty that customers could be checked in their
desire to patronise.  One had started with the proud boast, “Everything
at Sixpence-halfpenny,” and had later altered the six to five, and the
five to four; only necessary to allow time, and there seemed some good
prospect that the reckless shop would eventually give its contents free.
Erb pulled at the bell handle, and it came out obligingly.
</p><p>“Now you ’ave gone and done it,” said the small servant who opened the
door.  “That’s clever, that is.  I suppose you get medals for doing
tricks like that?  Well, well,” she continued fractiously, as Erb made no
reply, “don’t stand there like a great gawk with the knob in your ’and.
What d’you want?”
</p><p>“Might Professor Danks be in?” asked Erb.
</p><p>“He might and he might not,” explained the small servant.  “He’s jest
sleepin’ it off a bit on the sofa.”
</p><p>“Can I see anyone else?”
</p><p>“Come in,” said the girl with a burst of friendliness.  “Never mind about
wipin’ your boots; it’s getting to the end of the week.  You could see
<u>her</u> if you didn’t mind waiting till she’s finished giving a lesson.”
</p><p>“Shall I wait here in the passage?”
</p><p>“Don’t disturb him,” whispered the girl, “if I let you rest your weary
bones in the back room.”  She opened the door of the back room quietly.
“<u>She’s</u> as right as rain,” whispered the girl confidently, “but <u>he</u>—”
The girl gave an expressive wave of the hand, signifying that the
Professor was not indispensable to the world’s happiness.  Erb went in.
“I’d stay and chat to you,” she said through the doorway, “only there’s
my ironin’.  I’ve got the ’ole ’ouse to look after, mind you, besides
answering the front door.”
</p><p>“Takes a bit of doing, no doubt.”
</p><p>“You never said a truer word,” whispered the short servant.  “There’s
pictures in that magazine you can look at.  If you want me, ’oller
‘Lizer!’ over the banisters.”
</p><p>Professor Danks, asleep on the sofa, had the <u>Era</u> over his face for
better detachment from a wakeful world: the paper was slipping gradually,
and Erb, watching him over the top of the book, knew that the eclipse
would be over and the features fully visible in a few minutes.
Meanwhile, he noticed that the Professor was a large, heavy man, with
snowy hair at one end, and slippers which had walked along muddy
pavements at the other; not a man, apparently, of active habits.
</p><p>“I fear I shall never make anything of you,” her decided voice came from
the front room.  “You don’t pay attention.  You don’t seem to remember
what I tell you.”
</p><p>“Mustn’t be too harsh with my husband, miss,” said a voice with the South
London whine.  “We all have to make a beginning, don’t forget that.”
</p><p>“Now, sir.  Once more, please, we’ll go through this piece of poetry.
And when you say the first lines, ‘Give others the flags of foreign
states,’ show some animation; don’t say the words casually, as though you
were talking of the weather.”
</p><p>“You understand, miss,” interposed the pupil’s wife, “that he’s made up
the words out of his own head.”
</p><p>“I am sure of that,” with a touch of sarcasm.
</p><p>“But, whilst he’s very clever in putting poetry together, he is not so
good—I’m speaking, Albert dear, for your own benefit—he is not so good in
reciting of them.  And we go out into Society a great deal (there’s two
parties on at New Cross only next month that we’re asked to), and what I
thought was that it would be so nice any time when an evening began to go
a bit slow for me to say casually, ye know, ‘Albert, what about that
piece you made up yourself?’  Then for him to get up and recite it in a
gentlemanly way.”
</p><p>“Come now,” said the instructress, “‘Give others the flags of foreign
states, I care not for them a jot.’”
</p><p>“Of course,” interposed the wife again, “his high-pitched voice is
against him, but that’s his misfortune, not his fault.  Also you may
think that he’s left it rather late to take up with elocution.  If we’d
ever had any children of our own—”
</p><p>“I really think,” said the girl, “that we must get on with the lesson.
Now, sir, if you please.  ‘Give others the flags.’”
</p><p>The <u>Era</u> had slipped from the Professor’s red face, and the swollen,
poached-egg eyes moved, the heavy eyelids made one or two reluctant
efforts to unclose.  The room, Erb thought, looked as though it were
troubled by opposing forces, one anxious to keep it neat and keep it
comfortable, the other with entirely different views, and baulking these
efforts with some success.  Erb saw the household clearly and felt a
desire to range himself on the side of order.
</p><p>“Good evening,” he said, when the leaden eyelids had decided to open.
“Having your little nap, sir?”
</p><p>The Professor sat up, kneading his eyes and then rubbing his white hair
violently.
</p><p>“I have been,” he said, in a voice that would have sounded important if
it had not been hoarse, “making a brief excursion into the land of
dreams.”  He clicked his tongue.  “And a devil of a mouth I’ve got on me,
too.”  He rose heavily and went to a bamboo table where two syphons were
standing, tried them, and found they were empty.  “A curse,” he said, “on
both your houses.”
</p><p>“I’ve called about some lessons.”
</p><p>“Lessons!” repeated the Professor moodily.  “That I, Reginald Danks,
should be reduced to this!  I, who might have been at the Lyceum at the
present moment but for fate and Irving.  How many lessons,” he asked with
a change of manner, “do you require, laddie?”
</p><p>“I thought about six,” said Erb.
</p><p>“Make it a dozen.  We offer thirteen for the price of twelve.”
</p><p>“What would that number run me into?  I want them more for public
speaking than anything else.”
</p><p>“We shall do the whole bag of tricks for you,” said the Professor,
placing an enormous hand on Erb’s shoulder, “for a mere trifle.”
</p><p>“Who is ‘we?’”
</p><p>“Rather should you say, ‘To whom is it that you refer?’  In this
self-appointed task of imparting the principles of voice production and
elocution to the—to the masses,” the Professor seemed to restrain himself
forcibly from using a contumelious adjective, “I have the advantage of
valuable assistance from my daughter.  Her system is my system, her
methods are my methods, her rules are my rules.  If at any time I should
be called away on professional business,” here the Professor passed his
hand over his lip, “my daughter, Rosalind, takes my place.  What is your
age?”
</p><p>Erb gave the information.
</p><p>“Ah,” the Professor sighed deeply, “in ’74 I was with Barry Sullivan
doing the principal towns in a repertoire.  No, I’m telling you a lie.
It was not in ’74.  It was in the autumn of ’73.  I played Rosencrantz
and the First Grave-digger—an enormous success.”
</p><p>“Which?”
</p><p>“I went from Barry Sullivan to join the ‘Murderous Moment’ Company, and
that,” said the Professor, striking his waistcoat, “was perhaps one of
the biggest triumphs ever witnessed on the dramatic stage.  From that
hour, sir, from that hour I never looked back.”
</p><p>The high-voiced pupil in the front room finished his lesson, and his wife
took him off with the congratulatory remark that he promised well to make
her relatives at forthcoming parties sit up with astonishment.  The
Professor’s daughter, seeing them both to the front door, remarked that
her pupil would be able to find his way alone the next time, whereupon
the pupil’s wife answered darkly, “Do you really think I should let him
go out?”
</p><p>“Shall I settle with you?” asked Erb.
</p><p>“My daughter Rosalind,” said the Professor regretfully, “insists, as a
general rule, on taking charge of the business side, but on this
occasion—”
</p><p>“If that’s the rule,” interrupted Erb, “don’t let’s break it.  I don’t
want any misunderstanding about matters of cash.”
</p><p>“There have been times in my life, sir, when money has been as nothing to
me.  Will you believe that there was a time in my professional career
when I earnt twenty guineas—twenty of the best—per week?”
</p><p>“Since you ask me, my answer is ‘No.’”
</p><p>“You are quite right,” said the Professor, and in no way disconcerted.
“Let us be exact in our statements or perish.  Not twenty guineas, twenty
pounds.  But that,” he went on rather hurriedly, “that was at a time when
real acting, sir, was appreciated.  Nowadays they walk in from the
streets.  Ee-locution is a lost art; acting, real acting, is not to be
seen on the London boards.  If you have a cigarette about you, I can get
a light from the fireplace.”
</p><p>Erb acted upon this hint, and listened for the girl’s voice.
</p><p>“Her mother,” went on the Professor, puffing at the cigarette, and then
looking at it disparagingly, “her mother before she fell ill—mind, I’m
not complaining—was perhaps, without exception, the most diversified
arteest that ever graced the dramatic stage.  Ingénue, old woman,
soubrette, nothing came amiss to her.  That was the difference between
us—she liked work.  And when, just before the end, when I’d been out of
engagement for some time, she had an offer for the pair of us, two pounds
ten the couple, such was her indomitable spirit that she actually wanted
to accept it.  But I said ‘No.’  I put my foot down.  I admit,” said the
Professor genially, “that I lost my temper with her.  I told her pretty
definitely that I had made up my mind—”
</p><p>“Your <u>what</u>?” inquired Erb.
</p><p>“That poverty I could face, dee-privation I could endure, hunger and
thirst I could welcome with o-pen arms, but a contemptuous proposition
such as this I could not, should not, and would not tolerate.  I repeated
this,” added the Professor with a fine roll and a sweep of the left hand,
“at the inquest.”
</p><p>“You’re a nice one, I don’t think,” said Erb critically.  “How is it they
let you live on?”
</p><p>“Laddie,” said the Professor, tearfully, “my life is not an enviable one
even now.  My own daughter—Soft!—she comes.”
</p><p>It occurred to Erb later that in his anxiety to show himself a careless,
self-possessed fellow, he rather overdid it, presenting himself in the
light of one slightly demented.  He nodded his head on formal
introduction by the Professor, hummed a cheerful air, and, taking out a
packet of cigarette papers, blew at one, and recollecting, twisted the
detached slip into a butterfly shape and puffed it to the ceiling.  The
girl looked at him, at her father, then again at Erb.  She had a pencil
resting between the buttons of her pink blouse, and but for a slight
contraction of the forehead that is the public sign of private worry,
would have been a very happy-looking young person indeed.
</p><p>“A would-be student,” said her father with a proud wave of the hand
towards Erb, as though he had just made him, “a would-be student, my
love: one anxious to gain at our hands the principles of voice
pro-duction and ee-locution.”
</p><p>“When do you propose to begin, sir?” she asked, limping slightly as she
went to a desk.
</p><p>“Soon as your father’s ready, miss.”
</p><p>“I have heard you speak in the park.”
</p><p>“Most people have!” replied Erb, with a fine assumption of indifference.
</p><p>“I’ll just register your name, please.”
</p><p>“Our sys-tem,” said the Professor oracularly, as Erb bent over her and
gave the information (there was a pleasant warm scent from her hair), “is
to conduct everything in a perfectly businesslike manner.  I remember on
one occasion Mr. Phelps said to me, ‘Danks, my dear young friend, never,
never—’  My dear Rosalind, give me the word.  What was it,” the Professor
tapped his large forehead reprovingly, “what was it I was talking about?”
</p><p>“I don’t think it matters, father.  You pay in advance, please,” she said
to Erb.  “Thank you.  I’m not sure that I have sufficient change in the
house.”
</p><p>“I will step down the road,” suggested the Professor with a slight excess
of eagerness, “and obtain the necessary—”
</p><p>“No, father.”
</p><p>“Think I’ve got just enough silver,” said Erb.
</p><p>“Thank you, Mr. Barnes.”
</p><p>Good to be called Mister, better still to find it accompanied by a smile
of gratitude that somehow also intimated comradeship and a defensive
alliance against the ingenious Professor.  The Professor, affecting to
examine a pimple on his chin at the mirror, looked at his daughter’s
reflection in an appealing way; but she shook her head quickly.  The
Professor sighed and, turning back the cuffs of his shirt, put on an
elderly velvet jacket.
</p><p>“I have some work to do downstairs,” she said, with a curt little bow to
Erb.  “You will excuse me.”
</p><p>“Only too pleased, miss,” he said blunderingly.
</p><p>“Father, you will give Mr. Barnes an hour, please, in the front room.  I
will come up when the time is—”
</p><p>“Then I needn’t say good-bye,” remarked Erb gallantly.
</p><p>The Professor in the front room declaimed to the new pupil a passage from
the “Merchant of Venice,” from the centre of the carpet, and then invited
him to repeat it, which Erb did, the Professor arresting him at every
line, correcting the accent with acerbity and calling attention to the
aspirates with something like tears.  “Why don’t you speak naturally,
sir?” demanded the Professor, hitting his own chest with his fist, “as I
dew?”  At the end of twenty minutes, when the Professor had furnished
some really valuable rules in regard to the artifices of voice
production, he gave a sudden dramatic start, and begged Erb for pity’s
sake not to tell him that the day was Thursday and the hour half-past
seven.  On Erb admitting his inability to give him other information
without stepping beyond the confines of truth, the Professor strode up
and down the worn carpet in a state of great agitation, declaring that
unless he were in the Strand by eight fifteen, or, at the very latest,
eight twenty that evening, he would, in all probability, lose the chance
of a lifetime.
</p><p>“What am I to do?” he asked imploringly.  “I appeal to you, laddie?  Show
me where duty calls?”
</p><p>On Erb suggesting that perhaps Miss Rosalind would finish the lesson, the
Professor shook him warmly by both hands and ordered heaven in a
dictatorial way to rain down blessings on the head of his pupil.  One
difficulty remained.  Time pressed, and every moment was (in all
probability) golden.  Could Mr. Barnes, as an old friend, oblige with
half a—no, not half a crown, two shillings.  The Professor, in the
goodness of his heart, did not mind four sixpences, and hurrying out into
the passage, struggled into a long brown overcoat of the old Newmarket
shape, took his soft hat, and, having called over the banisters to his
daughter to favour him with a moment’s conversation, bustled through the
passage whispering to Erb, “You can explain better than I,” and going
out, closed the door quietly.  There were signs of flour on the girl’s
plump arms as she came up; she rolled down the sleeves of the pink blouse
as she entered the front room.  Her forehead contracted as she listened.
</p><p>“How much did he borrow?” she asked, checking a sigh.
</p><p>“Nothing,” replied Erb boldly.
</p><p>“Two shillings or a half a crown?”
</p><p>“But I couldn’t possibly think for a moment—” he began protestingly.
</p><p>“I wish you had,” she said.  “Take it, please.  I don’t want father to
run into debt if I can help it.”
</p><p>“Makes me feel as though I’m robbing you.”
</p><p>“Do you know,” said Miss Rosalind, with not quite half a smile, “it makes
me feel as though I were being robbed.  Let us get on with the lesson,
please; I have another pupil coming at half-past eight.”  Erb, for a hot
moment, was consumed with unreasonable jealousy of the next pupil.  “She
is always punctual,” added Rosalind, and Erb became cooler.  “Take this
book, please, and read aloud the passage I have marked.”
</p><p>There were faded photographs on the mantelpiece of ladies with exuberant
smiles, calculated to disarm any criticism in regard to their eccentric
attire, their signatures sprawled across the lower right hand corner,
“Ever yours most affectionate!”  A frame that had seen stormy days
outside provincial theatres hung on the wall with the address of its last
exhibition half rubbed off.  Erb as he listened to the girl’s serious
corrections and warning, guessed that the half-dozen portraits it
contained were all of Rosalind’s mother; they ranged from one as Robinson
Crusoe with a white muff to a more matronly representation of (judging
from her hat) a designing Frenchwoman holding a revolver in one hand, and
clearly prepared to use this.  In another she was fondling a child, whose
head and face were almost covered by a stage wig, and the child bore some
far-away resemblance to the present instructress.  On Rosalind limping
across the room to place on the fire an economical lump of coal, Erb
framed an expression of sympathy; common-sense most fortunately gagged
him.
</p><p>“You left school when you were very young?” said the girl, looking over
her shoulder from the fireplace.
</p><p>“Pawsed the sixth standard when I was—”
</p><p>“Oh, please, please!  Don’t say pawsed.”
</p><p>“I passed the sixth standard when I was twelve, because I had to.  Father
was Kentish born, mother wasn’t.  Both died in the”—Rosalind put her
hands apprehensively to her ears—“in the hospital in one week, both in
one week, and I had to set to and get shot of the Board School and go
out.”
</p><p>“As?” she asked curiously.
</p><p>“As chief of the Transport Department to the principal railway
companies,” said Erb glibly, “and personal friend, and, I may say,
adviser to his Royal—”
</p><p>“We will proceed,” said Rosalind, haughty on the receipt of sarcasm,
“with the lesson, please.  There is much to be done in the way of
eradicating errors in your speech.”
</p><p>The reliable lady pupil due at eight thirty spoilt her record by arriving
half an hour late.  Thus, when Erb’s lesson was finished and the clock on
the mantelpiece gave the hour in a hurried asthmatic way, there was still
time for polite conversation on a variety of topics; the house, Erb
discovered, was not theirs, they only occupied furnished apartments; they
had lived in many parts of London, because, said Rosalind cautiously, the
Professor liked a change now and again.  Erb backed slowly towards the
door as each subject was discussed, anxious to stay as long as possible,
but more anxious still to make his exit with some clever impressive final
remark.  He found her book of notices, and insisted politely on reading
the neatly pasted slips cut from the “Hornsey Express,” the “South London
Journal,” the “Paddington Magpie,” and other newspapers of repute, which
said “Miss Rosalind Danks in her recitals made the hit of the evening,
and the same may be said of all the other artists on the programme.”
That “Miss R. Danks, as our advertisement column shows, is to give An
Evening with the Poets and Humorists at our Town Hall on Thursday
evening.  We wish her a bumper.”  That “Miss Rosalind Danks’s _naïveté_
of manner and general <u>chic</u> enabled her in an American contribution to
score a terrific ‘succés d’estime.’  She narrowly escaped an enthusiastic
<u>encore</u>.”  That “Miss Danks lacks some of the charms necessary for a
good platform appearance—”
</p><p>“I’d like to argue the point with the man who wrote that,” said Erb.
</p><p>“They have to fill the paper with something,” remarked Miss Rosalind.
</p><p>“For a good platform appearance, but she has a remarkably distinct
enunciation, and some of her lines could be heard almost distinctly at
the back of the hall.”  That “Miss Danks comes of a theatrical stock, and
her father is none other than the celebrated Mr. Reginald Danks, whose
Antonio still remains in the memory of the few privileged to witness it.
Mr. Reginald Danks informs us that he has had several offers from West
End theatres, but that he has some idea of going in for management
himself as soon as a convenient playhouse can be secured.  Of this, more
anon.”
</p><p>It was natural when Erb had looked through these notices that he should
find in his pocket two or three copies of a small poster advertising a
lecture by him on the forthcoming Sunday evening, at a hall in Walworth
Road.  “Mr. Herbert Barnes,” said the poster loudly, adding in a lower
voice, “Organising Secretary Railway Carmen’s Union, will speak on The
Working Man: What Will Become of Him?  No collection.  Discussion
invited.”  Erb gave Miss Rosalind one of these as a present, and then
said, “Well now, I must be off,” as though he had been detained greatly
against his will.
</p><p>And here it was that Erb made one of those mistakes of commission which
the most reliable of us effect at uncertain intervals.  He took up the
photograph of a fur-coated young man, clean-shaven face, thin lips, and
not quite enough of chin.
</p><p>“And who,” asked Erb pityingly, “who might this young toff be?”
</p><p>“He is stage manager,” she said rather proudly, “to a company touring in
the provinces.  Plays too.”
</p><p>“Relation?”
</p><p>“Not yet,” said Rosalind.
</p><p>As Erb blundered through the passage Rosalind warned him to attend to the
home-work she had given him to do, and to come promptly to his next
lesson; she held the door open until Erb went out of the gate, a new
politeness which he acknowledged by lifting his hat.  He had never lifted
his hat to a lady before, and had always smiled contemptuously when he
had seen gallant youths performing this act of respect.  To atone for
this retrograde movement he ran against the tardily-arriving lady pupil,
and went on without apology.  The lady pupil ejaculated, “Clown!” and Erb
felt that he had righted himself in his own estimation.
</p><p>He looked about him as he walked up the crowded pavement towards the
Elephant and Castle, because it was always one of his duties to recognise
the railway vans.  Disappointment clouded his eyes: he blamed himself for
so far forgetting the principal duty of his life as to waste time on
unremunerative investments.  This was why he missed a Brighton goods van
standing with its pair of horses near a large shop in Newington Causeway;
the van boy reported Erb’s negligence to his mate when he returned, and
this coming on the top of other annoying circumstances, the Brighton man
said to himself, “This shall be chalked up against you, young Erb.”
</p><p>Erb reached Page’s Walk, having tried ineffectually to walk himself into
a good humour, and found Louisa with a round spot of colour high up on
either cheek, looking out of the window of the model dwellings and
hailing him excitedly.
</p><p>“Put that ’ead of yours in,” he counselled.  “You’ll go and catch cold.”
</p><p>“You won’t catch much,” retorted Louisa, “if you don’t arrange to be on
’and when wanted.  ’Urry upstairs, I’ve got something to tell you that
can’t be bawled.”
</p><p>Erb ran up the stone stairs, and Louisa met him at the door of the
sitting-room, her eyes bigger than ever with the importance.  The room
had a slight perfume of violets.
</p><p>“Who d’you think’s been ’ere?”
</p><p>“Tell us,” said Erb.
</p><p>“But guess,” begged Louisa, enjoying the power that was hers.
</p><p>“Can’t guess.”
</p><p>“Lady Frances,” said Louisa, in an impressive whisper.
</p><p>“Well,” remarked Erb curtly, “what of it?”
</p><p>“What of it?  Why, she wanted you to show her over Bermondsey, and she
waited here upwards of a hower, chatting away to me like anything.”
</p><p>“Any other news?”
</p><p>“Yes,” said Louisa reluctantly, “but nothing of much importance.  Letter
from Aunt Emma; she’s coming up soon.  Oh, and a man called to say there
was trouble brewin’ at Willer Walk, and would you see about it as soon as
possible.”
</p><p>“<u>Now</u>,” remarked Erb elatedly, “<u>now</u> you’re talking.”
