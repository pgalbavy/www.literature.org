    `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the
    moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she
    jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with
    the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads
    of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding
    her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset
    the week before.
    <P>
      `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great
      dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,
      for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and
      she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once
      and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.
    <P>
      `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave
      voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--
      ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as
      he said do.
    <P>
      Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she
      had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing
      was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable
      to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that
      it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it
      would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'
    <P>
      As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of
      being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and
      handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write
      out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed
      too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,
      gazing up into the roof of the court.
    <P>
      `What do you know about this business?' the King said to
      Alice.
    <P>
      `Nothing,' said Alice.
    <P>
      `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.
    <P>
      `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.
    <P>
      `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.
      They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when
      the White Rabbit interrupted: `UNimportant, your Majesty means,
      of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and
      making faces at him as he spoke.
    <P>
      `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and
      went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--
      unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word
      sounded best.
    <P>
      Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some
      `unimportant.' Alice could see this, as she was near enough to
      look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she
      thought to herself.
    <P>
      At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily
      writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out
      from his book, `Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE
      HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'
    <P>
      Everybody looked at Alice.
    <P>
      `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.
    <P>
      `You are,' said the King.
    <P>
      `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.
    <P>
      `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: `besides,
      that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'
    <P>
      `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.
    <P>
      `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.
    <P>
      The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.
      `Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling
      voice.
    <P>
      `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said
      the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has
      just been picked up.'
    <P>
      `What's in it?' said the Queen.
    <P>
      `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems
      to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'
    <P>
      `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was
      written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'
    <P>
      `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.
    <P>
      `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,
      there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper
      as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set
      of verses.'
    <P>
      `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of
      they jurymen.
    <P>
      `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the
      queerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)
    <P>
      `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.
      (The jury all brightened up again.)
    <P>
      `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and
      they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'
    <P>
      `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the
      matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd
      have signed your name like an honest man.'
    <P>
      There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the
      first really clever thing the King had said that day.
    <P>
      `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.
    <P>
      `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't
      even know what they're about!'
    <P>
      `Read them,' said the King.
    <P>
      The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,
      please your Majesty?' he asked.
    <P>
      `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on
      till you come to the end: then stop.'
    <P>
      These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--
    <div class="w3-container w3-margin-left poem">
      <span></span>
      <p>
      They told me you had been to her,<BR>
      And mentioned me to him:<BR>
      She gave me a good character,<BR>
      But said I could not swim.<BR>
      <P>
        He sent them word I had not gone<BR>
        (We know it to be true):<BR>
        If she should push the matter on,<BR>
        What would become of you?<BR>
      <P>
        I gave her one, they gave him two,<BR>
        You gave us three or more;<BR>
        They all returned from him to you,<BR>
        Though they were mine before.<BR>
      <P>
        If I or she should chance to be<BR>
        Involved in this affair,<BR>
        He trusts to you to set them free,<BR>
        Exactly as we were.<BR>
      <P>
        My notion was that you had been<BR>
        (Before she had this fit)<BR>
        An obstacle that came between<BR>
        Him, and ourselves, and it.<BR>
      <P>

        </div>
    `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'
    said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'
    <P>
      `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had
      grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit
      afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't
      believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'
    <P>
      The jury all wrote down on their slates, `<I>She</I> doesn't believe
      there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to
      explain the paper.
    <P>
      `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a
      world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And
      yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his
      knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some
      meaning in them, after all. "--<I>said i could not swim</I>--" you
      can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.
    <P>
      The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.
      (Which he certainly did <I>not</I>, being made entirely of cardboard.)
    <P>
      `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering
      over the verses to himself: `"<I>We know it to be true</I>--" that's
      the jury, of course-- "<I>I gave her one, they gave him two</I>--" why,
      that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'
    <P>
      `But, it goes on "<I>They all returned from him to you</I>,"' said
      Alice.
    <P>
      `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to
      the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than <I>that</I>.
      Then again--"<I>Before she had this fit</I>--" you never had fits, my
      dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.
    <P>
      `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the
      Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off
      writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no
      mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was
      trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)
    <P>
      `Then the words don't <I>fit</I> you,' said the King, looking round
      the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.
    <P>
      `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and
      everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the
      King said, for about the twentieth time that day.
    <P>
      `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'
    <P>
      `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having
      the sentence first!'
    <P>
      `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.
    <P>
      `I won't!' said Alice.
    <P>
      `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.
      Nobody moved.
    <P>
      `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full
      size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'
    <P>
      At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying
      down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half
      of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on
      the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently
      brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
      trees upon her face.
    <P>
      `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long
      sleep you've had!'
    <P>
      `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told
      her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
      Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and
      when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a
      curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's
      getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she
      ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.
    <P>
      But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her
      head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of
      little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began
      dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--
    <P>
      First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the
      tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes
      were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her
      voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back
      the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and
      still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place
      around her became alive the strange creatures of her little
      sister's dream.
    <P>
      The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried
      by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the
      neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as
      the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,
      and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate
      guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the
      Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once
      more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's
      slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
      filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
      Mock Turtle.
    <P>
      So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
      Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and
      all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only
      rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the
      reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-
      bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd
      boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and
      all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the
      confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the
      cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's
      heavy sobs.
    <P>
      Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of
      hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how
      she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and
      loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about
      her other little children, and make <I>their</I> eyes bright and eager
      with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of
      Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their
      simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
      remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
