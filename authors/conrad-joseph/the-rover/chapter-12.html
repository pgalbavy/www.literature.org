<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Upright and deliberate, Catherine left the kitchen, and in the
passage outside found Arlette waiting for her with a lighted candle
in her hand. Her heart was filled with sudden desolation by the
beauty of that young face enhaloed in the patch of light, with
the profound darkness as of a dungeon for a background. At once
her niece led the way upstairs muttering savagely through her
pretty teeth: "He thinks I could go to sleep. Old imbecile!"</p>

<p>Peyrol did not take his eyes off Catherine’s straight back till
the door had closed after her. Only then he relieved himself by
letting the air escape through his pursed lips and rolling his
eyes freely about. He picked up the lamp by the ring on the top
of the central rod and went into the salle, closing behind him
the door of the dark kitchen. He stood the lamp on the very table
on which Lieutenant Réal had had his midday meal. A small white
cloth was still spread on it, and there was his chair askew as
he had pushed it back when he got up. Another of the many chairs
in the salle was turned round conspicuously to face the table.
These things made Peyrol remark to himself bitterly: "She sat
and stared at him as if he had been gilt all over, with three
heads and seven arms on his body"&mdash;a comparison reminiscent of
certain idols he had seen in an Indian temple. Though not an iconoclast,
Peyrol felt positively sick at the recollection, and hastened
to step outside. The great cloud had broken up and the mighty
fragments were moving to the westward in stately flight before
the rising moon. Scevola, who had been lying extended full length
on the bench, swung himself up suddenly, very upright.</p>

<p>"Had a little nap in the open?" asked Peyrol, letting his eyes
roam through the luminous space under the departing rearguard
of the clouds jostling each other up there.</p>

<p>"I did not sleep," said the sans-culotte. "I haven’t closed my
eyes&mdash;not for one moment."</p>

<p>"That must be because you weren’t sleepy," suggested the deliberate
Peyrol, whose thoughts were far away with the English ship. His
mental eye contemplated her black image against the white beach
of the Salins describing a sparkling curve under the moon; and
meantime he went on slowly, "for it could not have been noise
that kept you awake." On the level of Escampobar the shadows lay
long on the ground while the side of the lookout hill remained
yet black but edged with an increasing brightness. And the amenity
of the stillness was such that it softened for a moment Peyrol’s
hard inward attitude towards all mankind, including even the captain
of the English ship. The old rover savoured a moment of serenity
in the midst of his cares.</p>

<p>"This is an accursed spot," declared Scevola suddenly.</p>

<p>Peyrol, without turning his head, looked at him sideways. Though
he had sprung up from his reclining posture smartly enough, the
citizen had gone slack all over and was sitting all in a heap.
His shoulders were hunched up, his hands reposed on his knees.
With his staring eyes he resembled a sick child in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"It’s the very spot for hatching treacheries. One feels steeped
in them up to the neck."</p>

<p>He shuddered and yawned a long irresistible nervous yawn with
the gleam of unexpected long canines in a retracted, gaping mouth
giving away the restless panther lurking in the man.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, there’s treachery about right enough. You couldn’t conceive
that, citoyen?"</p>

<p>"Of course I couldn’t," assented Peyrol with serene contempt.
"What is this treachery that you are concocting?" he added carelessly,
in a social way, while enjoying the charm of a moonlit evening.
Scevola, who did not expect that turn, managed, however, to produce
a rattling sort of laugh almost at once.</p>

<p>"That’s a good one, ha! ha! ha!... Me!... concocting!... Why
me?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Peyrol carelessly, "there are not many of us to
carry out treacheries about here. The women are gone upstairs;
Michel is down at the tartane. There’s me, and you would not dare
suspect me of treachery. Well, there remains only you."</p>

<p>Scevola roused himself. "This is not much of a jest," he said.
"I have been a treason-hunter. I...."</p>

<p>He checked that strain. He was full of purely emotional suspicions.
Peyrol was talking like this only to annoy him and to get him
out of the way; but in the particular state of his feelings Scevola
was acutely aware of every syllable of these offensive remarks.
"Aha," he thought to himself, "he doesn’t mention the lieutenant."
This omission seemed to the patriot of immense importance. If
Peyrol had not mentioned the lieutenant it was because those two
had been plotting some treachery together, all the afternoon on
board that tartane. That’s why nothing had been seen of them for
the best part of the day. As a matter of fact, Scevola too had
observed Peyrol returning to the farm in the evening, only he
had observed him from another window than Arlette. This was a
few minutes before his attempt to open the lieutenant’s door,
in order to find out whether Réal was in his room. He had tiptoed
away, uncertain, and going into the kitchen had found only Catherine
and Peyrol there. Directly Arlette joined them a sudden inspiration
made him run upstairs and try the door again. It was open now!
A clear proof that it was Arlette who had been locked up in there.
The discovery that she made herself at home like this in the lieutenant’s
room gave Scevola such a sickening shock that he thought he would
die of it. It was beyond doubt now that the lieutenant had been
conspiring with Peyrol down on board that tartane; for what else
could they have been doing there. But why had not Réal come up
in the evening with Peyrol? Scevola asked himself, sitting on
the bench with his hands clasped between his knees.... "It’s their
cunning," he concluded suddenly. "Conspirators always avoid being
seen together. Ha!"</p>

<p>It was as if somebody had let off a lot of fireworks in his brain.
He was illuminated, dazzled, confused, with a hissing in his ears
and showers of sparks before his eyes. When he raised his head
he saw he was alone. Peyrol had vanished. Scevola seemed to remember
that he had heard somebody pronounce the word "Good-night" and
the door of the salle slam. And sure enough the door of the salle
was shut now. A dim light shone in the window that was next to
it. Peyrol had extinguished three of the lamp flames, and was
now reclining on one of the long tables with that faculty of accommodating
himself to a plank an old sea-dog never loses. He had decided
to remain below simply to be handy, and he didn’t lie down on
one of the benches along the wall because they were too narrow.
He left one wick burning, so that the lieutenant should know where
to look for him, and he was tired enough to think that he would
snatch a couple of hours’ sleep before Réal could return from
Toulon. He settled himself with one arm under his head as if he
were on the deck of a privateer, and it never occurred to him
that Scevola was looking through the panes; but they were so small
and dusty that the patriot could see nothing. His movement had
been purely instinctive. He wasn’t even aware that he had looked
in. He went away from there, walked to the end of the building,
spun round and walked back again to the other end; and it was
as if he had been afraid of going beyond the wall against which
he reeled sometimes. Conspiracy, conspiracy, he thought. He was
now absolutely certain that the lieutenant was still hiding in
that tartane, and was only waiting till all was quiet to sneak
back to his room in which Scevola had proof positive that Arlette
was in the habit of making herself at home. To rob him of his
right to Arlette was part of the conspiracy, no doubt.</p>

<p>"Have I been a slave to those two women, have I waited all those
years, only to see that corrupt creature go off infamously with
a ci-devant, with a conspiring aristocrat?"</p>

<p>He became giddy with virtuous fury. There was enough evidence
there for any revolutionary tribunal to cut all their heads off.
Tribunal! There was no tribunal! No revolutionary justice! No
patriots! He hit his shoulder against the wall in his distress
with such force that he rebounded. This world was no place for
patriots.</p>

<p>"If I had betrayed myself in the kitchen they would have murdered
me in there."</p>

<p>As it was he thought that he had said too much. Too much. "Prudence!
Caution!" he repeated to himself, gesticulating with both arms.
Suddenly he stumbled, and there was an amazing metallic clatter
made by something that fell at his feet.</p>

<p>"They are trying to kill me now," he thought, shaking with fright.
He gave himself up for dead. Profound silence reigned all round.
Nothing more happened. He stooped fearfully to look and recognized
his own stable fork lying on the ground. He remembered he had
left it at noon leaning against the wall. His own foot had made
it fall. He threw himself upon it greedily. "Here’s what I need,"
he muttered feverishly. "I suppose that by now the lieutenant
would think I am gone to bed."</p>

<p>He flattened himself upright against the wall with the fork held
along his body like a grounded musket. The moon clearing the hill-top
flooded suddenly the front of the house with its cold light, but
he didn’t know it; he imagined himself still to be ambushed in
the shadow and remained motionless, glaring at the path leading
towards the cove. His teeth chattered with savage impatience.</p>

<p>He was so plainly visible in his deathlike rigidity that Michel,
coming up out of the ravine, stopped dead short, believing him
an apparition not belonging to this earth. Scevola, on his side,
noticed the moving shadow cast by a man&mdash;that man!&mdash;and charged
forward without reflection, the prongs of the fork lowered like
a bayonet. He didn’t shout. He came straight on, growling like
a dog, and lunged headlong with his weapon.</p>

<p>Michel, a primitive untroubled by anything so uncertain as intelligence,
executed an instantaneous sideways leap with the precision of
a wild animal; but he was enough of a man to become afterwards
paralysed with astonishment. The impetus of the rush carried Scevola
several yards down the hill, before he could turn round and assume
an offensive attitude. Then the two adversaries recognized each
other. The terrorist exclaimed: "Michel!" and Michel hastened
to pick up a large stone from the ground.</p>

<p>"Hey, you, Scevola," he cried, not very loud but very threatening.
"What are these tricks?... Keep away, or I will heave that piece
of rock at your head, and I am good at that."</p>

<p>Scevola grounded the fork with a thud. "I didn’t recognize you,"
he said.</p>

<p>"That’s a story. Who did you think I was? Not the other! I haven’t
got a bandaged head, have I?"</p>

<p>Scevola began to scramble up. "What’s this?" he asked. "What
head did you say?"</p>

<p>"I say that if you come near I will knock you over with that
stone," answered Michel. "You aren’t to be trusted when the moon
is full. Not recognize! There’s a silly excuse for flying at people
like this. You haven’t got anything against me, have you?"</p>

<p>"No," said the ex-terrorist in a dubious tone and keeping a watchful
eye on Michel, who was still holding the stone in his hand.</p>

<p>"People have been saying for years that you are a kind of lunatic,"
Michel criticized fearlessly, because the other’s discomfiture
was evident enough to put heart into the timid hare. "If a fellow
cannot come up now to get a snooze in the shed without being run
at with a fork, well...."</p>

<p>"I was only going to put this fork away," Scevola burst out volubly.
"I had left it leaning against the wall, and as I was passing
along I suddenly saw it, so I thought I would put it in the stable
before I went to bed. That’s all."</p>

<p>Michel’s mouth fell open a bit.</p>

<p>"Now what do you think I would want with a stable fork at this
time of night, if it wasn’t to put it away?" argued Scevola.</p>

<p>"What indeed!" mumbled Michel, who began to doubt the evidence
of his senses.</p>

<p>"You go about mooning like a fool and imagine a lot of silly
things, you great stupid imbecile. All I wanted to do was to ask
whether everything was all right down there, and you, idiot, bound
to one side like a goat and pick up a stone. The moon has affected
your head, not mine. Now drop it."</p>

<p>Michel, accustomed to do what he was told, opened his fingers
slowly, not quite convinced but thinking there might be something
in it. Scevola, perceiving his advantage, scolded on:</p>

<p>"You are dangerous. You ought to have your feet and hands tied
every full moon. What did you say about a head just now? What
head?"</p>

<p>"I said that I didn’t have a broken head."</p>

<p>"Was that all?" said Scevola. He was asking himself what on earth
could have happened down there during the afternoon to cause a
broken head. Clearly, it must have been either a fight or an accident,
but in any case he considered that it was for him a favourable
circumstance, for obviously a man with a bandaged head is at a
disadvantage. He was inclined to think it must have been some
silly accident, and he regretted profoundly that the lieutenant
had not killed himself outright. He turned sourly to Michel.</p>

<p>"Now you may go into the shed. And don’t try any of your tricks
with me any more, because next time you pick up a stone I will
shoot you like a dog."</p>

<p>He began to move towards the yard gate which stood always open,
throwing over his shoulder an order to Michel: "Go into the salle.
Somebody has left a light in there. They all seem to have gone
crazy to-day. Take the lamp into the kitchen and put it out, and
see that the door into the yard is shut. I am going to bed." He
passed through the gateway, but he did not penetrate into the
yard very far. He stopped to watch Michel obeying the order. Scevola,
advancing his head cautiously beyond the pillar of the gate, waited
till he had seen Michel open the door of the salle and then bounded
out again across the level space, and down the ravine path. It
was a matter of less than a minute. His fork was still on his
shoulder. His only desire was not to be interfered with, and for
the rest he did not care what they all did, what they would think
and how they would behave. The fixed idea had taken complete possession
of him. He had no plan, but he had a principle on which to act;
and that was to get at the lieutenant unawares, and if the fellow
died without knowing what hand had struck him, so much the better.
Scevola was going to act in the cause of virtue and justice. It
was not to be a matter of personal contest at all. Meantime, Michel,
having gone into the salle, had discovered Peyrol fast asleep
on a table. Though his reverence for Peyrol was unbounded, his
simplicity was such that he shook his master by the shoulder as
he would have done any common mortal. The rover passed from a
state of inertia into a sitting posture so quickly that Michel
stepped back a pace and waited to be addressed. But as Peyrol
only stared at him, Michel took the initiative in a concise phrase:</p>

<p>"He’s at it!"</p>

<p>Peyrol did not seem completely awake: "What is it you mean?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"He is making motions to escape."</p>

<p>Peyrol was wide awake now. He even swung his feet off the table.</p>

<p>"Is he? Haven’t you locked the cabin door?"</p>

<p>Michel, very frightened, explained that he had never been told
to do that.</p>

<p>"No?" remarked Peyrol placidly. "I must have forgotten." But
Michel remained agitated, and murmured: "He is escaping."</p>

<p>"That’s all right," said Peyrol. "What are you fussing about?
How far can he escape, do you think?"</p>

<p>A slow grin appeared on Michel’s face. "If he tries to scramble
over the top of the rocks, he will get a broken neck in no time,"
he said. "And he certainly won’t get very far, that’s a fact."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you see," said Peyrol.</p>

<p>"And he doesn’t seem strong either. He crawled out of the cabin
door and got as far as the little water cask and he dipped and
dipped into it. It must be half empty by now. After that he got
on to his legs. I cleared out ashore directly I heard him move,"
he went on in a tone of intense self-approval. "I hid myself behind
a rock and watched him."</p>

<p>"Quite right," observed Peyrol. After that word of commendation,
Michel’s face wore a constant grin.</p>

<p>"He sat on the after-deck," he went on as if relating an immense
joke, "with his feet dangling down the hold, and may the devil
take me if I don’t think he had a nap with his back against the
cask. He was nodding and catching himself up, with that big white
head of his. Well, I got tired of watching that, and as you told
me to keep out of his way, I thought I would come up here and
sleep in the shed. That was right, wasn’t it?"</p>

<p>"Quite right," repeated Peyrol. "Well, you go now into the shed.
And so you left him sitting on the after-deck?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Michel. "But he was rousing himself. I hadn’t got
away more than ten yards when I heard an awful thump on board.
I think he tried to get up and fell down the hold."</p>

<p>"Fell down the hold?" repeated Peyrol sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes, notre maître. I thought at first I would go back and see,
but you had warned me against him, hadn’t you? And I really think
that nothing can kill him."</p>

<p>Peyrol got down from the table with an air of concern which would
have astonished Michel, if he had not been utterly incapable of
observing things.</p>

<p>"This must be seen to," murmured the rover, buttoning the waistband
of his trousers. "My cudgel there, in the corner. Now you go to
the shed. What the devil are you doing at the door? Don’t you
know the way to the shed?" This last observation was caused by
Michel remaining in the doorway of the salle with his head out
and looking to right and left along the front of the house. "What’s
come to you? You don’t suppose he has been able to follow you
so quick as this up here?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, notre maître, quite impossible. I saw that sacré Scevola
promenading up and down here. I don’t want to meet him again."</p>

<p>"Was he promenading outside," asked Peyrol, with annoyance. "Well,
what do you think he can do to you? What notions have you got
in your silly head? You are getting worse and worse. Out you go."</p>

<p>Peyrol extinguished the lamp and, going out, closed the door
without the slightest noise. The intelligence about Scevola being
on the move did not please him very much, but he reflected that
probably the sans-culotte had fallen asleep again, and after waking
up was on his way to bed when Michel caught sight of him. He had
his own view of the patriot’s psychology and did not think the
women were in any danger. Nevertheless he went to the shed and
heard the rustling of straw as Michel settled himself for the
night.</p>

<p>"Debout," he cried low. "Sh, don’t make any noise. I want you
to go into the house and sleep at the bottom of the stairs. If
you hear voices, go up, and if you see Scevola about, knock him
down. You aren’t afraid of him, are you?"</p>

<p>"No, if you tell me not to be," said Michel, who, picking up
his shoes, a present from Peyrol, walked barefoot towards the
house. The rover watched him slipping noiselessly through the
salle door. Having thus, so to speak, guarded his base, Peyrol
proceeded down the ravine with a very deliberate caution. When
he got as far as the little hollow in the ground from which the
mastheads of the tartane could be seen, he squatted and waited.
He didn’t know what his prisoner had done or was doing, and he
did not want to blunder into the way of his escape. The day-old
moon was high enough to have shortened the shadows almost to nothing
and all the rocks were inundated by a yellow sheen, while the
bushes by contrast looked very black. Peyrol reflected that he
was not very well concealed. The continued silence impressed him
in the end. "He has got away," he thought. And yet he was not
sure. Nobody could be sure. He reckoned it was about an hour since
Michel had left the tartane; time enough for a man, even on all
fours, to crawl down to the shore of the cove. Peyrol wished he
had not hit so hard. His object could have been attained with
half the force. On the other hand all the proceedings of his prisoner,
as reported by Michel, seemed quite rational. Naturally the fellow
was badly shaken. Peyrol felt as though he wanted to go on board
and give him some encouragement, and even active assistance.</p>

<p>The report of a gun from seaward cut his breath short as he lay
there meditating. Within a minute there was a second report, sending
another wave of deep sound among the crags and hills of the peninsula.
The ensuing silence was so profound that it seemed to extend to
the very inside of Peyrol’s head, and lull all his thoughts for
a moment. But he had understood. He said to himself that after
this his prisoner, if he had life enough left in him to stir a
limb, would rather die than not try to make his way to the seashore.
The ship was calling to her man.</p>

<p>In fact those two guns had proceeded from the <em>Amelia</em>.
After passing beyond Cape Esterel, Captain Vincent dropped an
anchor underfoot off the beach just as Peyrol had surmised he
would do. From about six o’clock till nine the <em>Amelia</em>
lay there with her unfurled sails hanging in the gear. Just before
the moon rose the captain came up on deck and after a short conference
with his first lieutenant, directed the master to get the ship
under way and put her head again for the Petite Passe. Then he
went below, and presently word was passed on deck that the captain
wanted Mr. Bolt. When the master’s mate appeared in his cabin,
Captain Vincent motioned him to a chair.</p>

<p>"I don’t think I ought to have listened to you," he said. "Still,
the idea was fascinating, but how it would strike other people
it is hard to say. The losing of our man is the worst feature.
I have an idea that we might recover him. He may have been captured
by the peasants or have met with an accident. It’s unbearable
to think of him lying at the foot of some rock with a broken leg.
I have ordered the first and second cutters to be manned, and
I propose that you should take command of them and enter the cove
and, if necessary, advance a little inland to investigate. As
far as we know there have never been any troops on that peninsula.
The first thing you will do is to examine the coast."</p>

<p>He talked for some time, giving more minute instructions, and
then went on deck. The <em>Amelia</em>, with the two cutters towing
alongside, reached about half-way down the Passe and then the
boats were ordered to proceed. Just before they shoved off two
guns were fired in quick succession.</p>

<p>"Like this, Bolt," explained Captain Vincent, "Symons will guess
that we are looking for him; and if he is hiding anywhere near
the shore he will be sure to come down where he can be seen by
you."</p>
