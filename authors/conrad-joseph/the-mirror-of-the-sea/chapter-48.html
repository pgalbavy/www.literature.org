<p> And yet the fact remains that, had the wind failed and the fleet
lost steerage way, or, worse still, had it been taken aback from
the eastward, with its leaders within short range of the enemy’s
guns, nothing, it seems, could have saved the headmost ships from
capture or destruction. No skill of a great sea officer would
have availed in such a contingency. Lord Nelson was more than
that, and his genius would have remained undiminished by defeat. 
But obviously tactics, which are so much at the mercy of irremediable
accident, must seem to a modern seaman a poor matter of study. 
The Commander-in-Chief in the great fleet action that will take
its place next to the Battle of Trafalgar in the history of the
British navy will have no such anxiety, and will feel the weight
of no such dependence.  For a hundred years now no British fleet
has engaged the enemy in line of battle.  A hundred years is a
long time, but the difference of modern conditions is enormous. 
The gulf is great.  Had the last great fight of the English navy
been that of the First of June, for instance, had there been no
Nelson’s victories, it would have been wellnigh impassable.  The
great Admiral’s slight and passion-worn figure stands at the parting
of the ways.  He had the audacity of genius, and a prophetic inspiration.</p>

<p>The modern naval man must feel that the time has come for the
tactical practice of the great sea officers of the past to be
laid by in the temple of august memories.  The fleet tactics of
the sailing days have been governed by two points: the deadly
nature of a raking fire, and the dread, natural to a commander
dependent upon the winds, to find at some crucial moment part
of his fleet thrown hopelessly to leeward.  These two points were
of the very essence of sailing tactics, and these two points have
been eliminated from the modern tactical problem by the changes
of propulsion and armament.  Lord Nelson was the first to disregard
them with conviction and audacity sustained by an unbounded trust
in the men he led.  This conviction, this audacity and this trust
stand out from amongst the lines of the celebrated memorandum,
which is but a declaration of his faith in a crushing superiority
of fire as the only means of victory and the only aim of sound
tactics.  Under the difficulties of the then existing conditions
he strove for that, and for that alone, putting his faith into
practice against every risk.  And in that exclusive faith Lord
Nelson appears to us as the first of the moderns.</p>

<p>Against every risk, I have said; and the men of to-day, born
and bred to the use of steam, can hardly realize how much of that
risk was in the weather.  Except at the Nile, where the conditions
were ideal for engaging a fleet moored in shallow water, Lord
Nelson was not lucky in his weather.  Practically it was nothing
but a quite unusual failure of the wind which cost him his arm
during the Teneriffe expedition.  On Trafalgar Day the weather
was not so much unfavourable as extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>It was one of these covered days of fitful sunshine, of light,
unsteady winds, with a swell from the westward, and hazy in general,
but with the land about the Cape at times distinctly visible. 
It has been my lot to look with reverence upon the very spot more
than once, and for many hours together.  All but thirty years
ago, certain exceptional circumstances made me very familiar for
a time with that bight in the Spanish coast which would be enclosed
within a straight line drawn from Faro to Spartel.  My well-remembered
experience has convinced me that, in that corner of the ocean,
once the wind has got to the northward of west (as it did on the
20th, taking the British fleet aback), appearances of westerly
weather go for nothing, and that it is infinitely more likely
to veer right round to the east than to shift back again.  It
was in those conditions that, at seven on the morning of the 21st,
the signal for the fleet to bear up and steer east was made. 
Holding a clear recollection of these languid easterly sighs rippling
unexpectedly against the run of the smooth swell, with no other
warning than a ten-minutes’ calm and a queer darkening of the
coast-line, I cannot think, without a gasp of professional awe,
of that fateful moment.  Perhaps personal experience, at a time
of life when responsibility had a special freshness and importance,
has induced me to exaggerate to myself the danger of the weather. 
The great Admiral and good seaman could read aright the signs
of sea and sky, as his order to prepare to anchor at the end of
the day sufficiently proves; but, all the same, the mere idea
of these baffling easterly airs, coming on at any time within
half an hour or so, after the firing of the first shot, is enough
to take one’s breath away, with the image of the rearmost ships
of both divisions falling off, unmanageable, broadside on to the
westerly swell, and of two British Admirals in desperate jeopardy. 
To this day I cannot free myself from the impression that, for
some forty minutes, the fate of the great battle hung upon a breath
of wind such as I have felt stealing from behind, as it were,
upon my cheek while engaged in looking to the westward for the
signs of the true weather.</p>

<p>Never more shall British seamen going into action have to trust
the success of their valour to a breath of wind.  The God of gales
and battles favouring her arms to the last, has let the sun of
England’s sailing-fleet and of its greatest master set in unclouded
glory.  And now the old ships and their men are gone; the new
ships and the new men, many of them bearing the old, auspicious
names, have taken up their watch on the stern and impartial sea,
which offers no opportunities but to those who know how to grasp
them with a ready hand and an undaunted heart.</p>
