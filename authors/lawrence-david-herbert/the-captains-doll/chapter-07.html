<p>And then a dreadful thing happened: really a very dreadful thing.
Hannele read of it in the evening newspaper of the town - the
Abendblatt.  Mitchka came rushing up with the paper at ten o'clock
at night, just when Hannele was going to bed.</p>

<p>Mrs Hepburn had fallen out of her bedroom window, from the third
floor of the hotel, down on to the pavement below, and was killed.
She was dressing for dinner.  And apparently she had in the morning
washed a certain little camisole, and put it on the window-sill to
dry.  She must have stood on a chair, reaching for it when she fell
out of the window.  Her husband, who was in the dressing-room,
heard a queer little noise, a sort of choking cry, and came into
her room to see what it was.  And she wasn't there.  The window was
open, and the chair by the window.  He looked round, and thought
she had left the room for a moment, so returned to his shaving.  He
was half-shaved when one of the maids rushed in.  When he looked
out of the window down into the street he fainted, and would have
fallen too if the maid had not pulled him in in time.</p>

<p>The very next day the captain came back to his attic.  Hannele did
not know, until quite late at night when he tapped on her door.
She knew his soft tap immediately.</p>

<p>'Won't you come over for a chat?' he said.</p>

<p>She paused for some moments before she answered.  And then perhaps
surprise made her agree: surprise and curiosity.</p>

<p>'Yes, in a minute,' she said, closing her door in his face.</p>

<p>She found him sitting quite still, not even smoking, in his quiet
attic.  He did not rise, but just glanced round with a faint smile.
And she thought his face seemed different, more flexible.  But in
the half-light she could not tell.  She sat at some little distance
from him.</p>

<p>'I suppose you've heard,' he said.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>After a long pause, he resumed:</p>

<p>'Yes.  It seems an impossible thing to have happened.  Yet it HAS
happened.'</p>

<p>Hannele's ears were sharp.  But strain them as she might, she could
not catch the meaning of his voice.</p>

<p>'A terrible thing.  A VERY terrible thing,' she said.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Do you think she fell quite accidentally?' she said.</p>

<p>'Must have done.  The maid was in just a minute before, and she
seemed as happy as possible.  I suppose reaching over that broad
window-ledge, her brain must suddenly have turned.  I can't imagine
why she didn't call me.  She could never bear even to look out of a
high window.  Turned her ill instantly if she saw a space below
her.  She used to say she couldn't really look at the moon, it made
her feel as if she would fall down a dreadful height.  She never
dared to more than glance at it.  She always had the feeling, I
suppose, of the awful space beneath her, if she were on the moon.'</p>

<p>Hannele was not listening to his words, but to his voice.  There
was something a little automatic in what he said.  But then that is
always so when people have had a shock.</p>

<p>'It must have been terrible for you too,' she said.</p>

<p>'Ah, yes.  At the time it was awful.  Awful.  I felt the smash
right inside me, you know.'</p>

<p>'Awful!' she repeated.</p>

<p>'But now,' he said, 'I feel very strangely happy about it.  I feel
happy about it.  I feel happy for her sake, if you can understand
that.  I feel she has got out of some great tension.  I feel she's
free now for the first time in her life.  She was a gentle soul,
and an original soul, but she was like a fairy who is condemned to
live in houses and sit on furniture and all that, don't you know.
It was never her nature.'</p>

<p>'No?' said Hannele, herself sitting in blank amazement.</p>

<p>'I always felt she was born in the wrong period - or on the wrong
planet.  Like some sort of delicate creature you take out of a
tropical forest the moment it is born, and from the first moment
teach it to perform tricks.  You know what I mean.  All her life
she performed the tricks of life, clever little monkey she was at
it too.  Beat me into fits.  But her own poor little soul, a sort
of fairy soul, those queer Irish creatures, was cooped up inside
her all her life, tombed in.  There it was, tombed in, while she
went through all the tricks of life that you have to go through if
you are born today.'</p>

<p>'But,' stammered Hannele, 'what would she have done if she HAD been
free?'</p>

<p>'Why, don't you see, there IS nothing for her to do in the world
today.  Take her language, for instance.  She never ought to have
been speaking English.  I don't know what language she ought to
have spoken.  Because if you take the Irish language, they only
learn it back from English.  They think in English, and just put
Irish words on top.  But English was never her language.  It
bubbled off her lips, so to speak.  And she had no other language.
Like a starling that you've made talk from the very beginning, and
so it can only shout these talking noises, don't you know.  It
can't whistle its own whistling to save its life.  Couldn't do it.
It's lost it.  All its own natural mode of expressing itself has
collapsed, and it can only be artificial.'</p>

<p>There was a long pause.</p>

<p>'Would she have been wonderful, then, if she had been able to talk
in some unknown language?' said Hannele jealously.</p>

<p>'I don't say she would have been wonderful.  As a matter of fact,
we think a talking starling is much more wonderful than an ordinary
starling.  I don't myself, but most people do.  And she would have
been a sort of starling.  And she would have had her own language
and her own ways.  As it was, poor thing, she was always arranging
herself and fluttering and chattering inside a cage.  And she never
knew she was in the cage, any more than we know we are inside our
own skins.'</p>

<p>'But,' said Hannele, with a touch of mockery, 'how do you know you
haven't made it all up - just to console yourself?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I've thought it long ago,' he said.</p>

<p>'Still,' she blurted, 'you may have invented it all - as a sort of
consolation for - for - for your life.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I may,' he said.  'But I don't think so.  It was her eyes.
Did you ever notice her eyes?  I often used to catch her eyes.  And
she'd be talking away, all the language bubbling off her lips.  And
her eyes were so clear and bright and different.  Like a child's
that is listening to something, and is going to be frightened.  She
was always listening - and waiting - for something else.  I tell you
what, she was exactly like that fairy in the Scotch song, who is in
love with a mortal, and sits by the high road in terror waiting for
him to come, and hearing the plovers and the curlews.  Only
nowadays motor-lorries go along the moor roads and the poor thing
is struck unconscious, and carried into our world in a state of
unconsciousness, and when she comes round, she tries to talk our
language and behave as we behave, and she can't remember anything
else, so she goes on and on, till she falls with a crash, back to
her own world.'</p>

<p>Hannele was silent, and so was he.</p>

<p>'You loved her then?' she said at length.</p>

<p>'Yes.  But in this way.  When I was a boy I caught a bird, a black-
cap, and I put it in a cage.  And I loved that bird.  I don't know
why, but I loved it.  I simply loved that bird.  All the gorse, and
the heather, and the rock, and the hot smell of yellow gorse
blossom, and the sky that seemed to have no end to it, when I was a
boy, everything that I almost was MAD with, as boys are, seemed to
me to be in that little, fluttering black-cap.  And it would peck
its seed as if it didn't quite know what else to do; and look round
about, and begin to sing.  But in quite a few days it turned its
head aside and died.  Yes, it died.  I never had the feeling again
that I got from that black-cap when I was a boy - not until I saw
her.  And then I felt it all again.  I felt it all again.  And it
was the same feeling.  I knew, quite soon I knew, that she would
die.  She would peck her seed and look round in the cage just the
same.  But she would die in the end.  Only it would last much
longer.  But she would die in the cage, like the black-cap.'</p>

<p>'But she loved the cage.  She loved her clothes and her jewels.
She must have loved her house and her furniture and all that with a
perfect frenzy.'</p>

<p>'She did.  She did.  But like a child with playthings.  Only they
were big, marvellous playthings to her.  Oh yes, she was never away
from them.  She never forgot her things - her trinkets and her furs
and her furniture.  She never got away from them for a minute.  And
everything in her mind was mixed up with them.'</p>

<p>'Dreadful!' said Hannele.</p>

<p>'Yes, it was dreadful,' he answered.</p>

<p>'Dreadful,' repeated Hannele.</p>

<p>'Yes, quite.  Quite!  And it got worse.  And her way of talking got
worse.  As if it bubbled off her lips.  But her eyes never lost
their brightness, they never lost that faery look.  Only I used to
see fear in them.  Fear of everything - even all the things she
surrounded herself with.  Just like my black-cap used to look out
of his cage - so bright and sharp, and yet as if he didn't know that
it was just the cage that was between him and the outside.  He
thought it was inside himself, the barrier.  He thought it was part
of his own nature to be shut in.  And she thought it was part of
her own nature.  And so they both died.'</p>

<p>'What I can't see,' said Hannele, 'is what she would have done
outside her cage.  What other life could she have, except her
bibelots and her furniture, and her talk?'</p>

<p>'Why, none.  There IS no life outside for human beings.'</p>

<p>'Then there's nothing,' said Hannele.</p>

<p>'That's true.  In a great measure, there's nothing.'</p>

<p>'Thank you,' said Hannele.</p>

<p>There was a long pause.</p>

<p>'And perhaps I was to blame.  Perhaps I ought to have made some
sort of a move.  But I didn't know what to do.  For my life, I
didn't know what to do, except try to make her happy.  She had
enough money - and I didn't think it mattered if she shared it with
me.  I always had a garden - and the astronomy.  It's been an
immense relief to me watching the moon.  It's been wonderful.
Instead of looking inside the cage, as I did at my bird, or at her - 
I look right out - into freedom - into freedom.'</p>

<p>'The moon, you mean?' said Hannele.</p>

<p>'Yes, the moon.'</p>

<p>'And that's your freedom?'</p>

<p>'That's where I've found the greatest sense of freedom,' he said.</p>

<p>'Well, I'm not going to be jealous of the moon,' said Hannele at
length.</p>

<p>'Why should you?  It's not a thing to be jealous of.'</p>

<p>In a little while, she bade him good-night and left him.</p>
