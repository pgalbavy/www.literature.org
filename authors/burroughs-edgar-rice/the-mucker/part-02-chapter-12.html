<p>IT WAS nearly ten o'clock the following morning when Barbara, sitting
upon the veranda of the ranchhouse, saw her father approaching from the
direction of the office. His face wore a troubled expression which the
girl could not but note.
</p>
<p>“What's the matter, Papa?” she asked, as he sank into a chair at her
side.
</p><p>“Your self-sacrifice of last evening was all to no avail,” he replied.
“Bridge has been captured by Villistas.”
</p><p>“What?” cried the girl. “You can't mean it--how did you learn?”
</p><p>“Grayson just had a phone message from Cuivaca,” he explained. “They
only repaired the line yesterday since Pesita's men cut it last month.
This was our first message. And do you know, Barbara, I can't help
feeling sorry. I had hoped that he would get away.”
</p><p>“So had I,” said the girl.
</p><p>Her father was eyeing her closely to note the effect of his announcement
upon her; but he could see no greater concern reflected than that which
he himself felt for a fellow-man and an American who was doomed to death
at the hands of an alien race, far from his own land and his own people.
</p><p>“Can nothing be done?” she asked.
</p><p>“Absolutely,” he replied with finality. “I have talked it over with
Grayson and he assures me that an attempt at intervention upon our part
might tend to antagonize Villa, in which case we are all as good as
lost. He is none too fond of us as it is, and Grayson believes, and
not without reason, that he would welcome the slightest pretext for
withdrawing the protection of his favor. Instantly he did that we should
become the prey of every marauding band that infests the mountains. Not
only would Pesita swoop down upon us, but those companies of freebooters
which acknowledge nominal loyalty to Villa would be about our ears in no
time. No, dear, we may do nothing. The young man has made his bed, and
now I am afraid that he will have to lie in it alone.”
</p><p>For awhile the girl sat in silence, and presently her father arose and
entered the house. Shortly after she followed him, reappearing soon
in riding togs and walking rapidly to the corrals. Here she found an
American cowboy busily engaged in whittling a stick as he sat upon an
upturned cracker box and shot accurate streams of tobacco juice at a
couple of industrious tumble bugs that had had the great impudence to
roll their little ball of provender within the whittler's range.
</p><p>“O Eddie!” she cried.
</p><p>The man looked up, and was at once electrified into action. He sprang
to his feet and whipped off his sombrero. A broad smile illumined his
freckled face.
</p><p>“Yes, miss,” he answered. “What can I do for you?”
</p><p>“Saddle a pony for me, Eddie,” she explained. “I want to take a little
ride.”
</p><p>“Sure!” he assured her cheerily. “Have it ready in a jiffy,” and away
he went, uncoiling his riata, toward the little group of saddle ponies
which stood in the corral against necessity for instant use.
</p><p>In a couple of minutes he came back leading one, which he tied to the
corral bars.
</p><p>“But I can't ride that horse,” exclaimed the girl. “He bucks.”
</p><p>“Sure,” said Eddie. “I'm a-goin' to ride him.”
</p><p>“Oh, are you going somewhere?” she asked.
</p><p>“I'm goin' with you, miss,” announced Eddie, sheepishly.
</p><p>“But I didn't ask you, Eddie, and I don't want you--today,” she urged.
</p><p>“Sorry, miss,” he threw back over his shoulder as he walked back to rope
a second pony; “but them's orders. You're not to be allowed to ride no
place without a escort. 'Twouldn't be safe neither, miss,” he almost
pleaded, “an' I won't hinder you none. I'll ride behind far enough to be
there ef I'm needed.”
</p><p>Directly he came back with another pony, a sad-eyed, gentle-appearing
little beast, and commenced saddling and bridling the two.
</p><p>“Will you promise,” she asked, after watching him in silence for a time,
“that you will tell no one where I go or whom I see?”
</p><p>“Cross my heart hope to die,” he assured her.
</p><p>“All right, Eddie, then I'll let you come with me, and you can ride
beside me, instead of behind.”
</p><p>Across the flat they rode, following the windings of the river road,
one mile, two, five, ten. Eddie had long since been wondering what the
purpose of so steady a pace could be. This was no pleasure ride which
took the boss's daughter--“heifer,” Eddie would have called her--ten
miles up river at a hard trot. Eddie was worried, too. They had passed
the danger line, and were well within the stamping ground of Pesita and
his retainers. Here each little adobe dwelling, and they were scattered
at intervals of a mile or more along the river, contained a rabid
partisan of Pesita, or it contained no one--Pesita had seen to this
latter condition personally.
</p><p>At last the young lady drew rein before a squalid and dilapidated hut.
Eddie gasped. It was Jose's, and Jose was a notorious scoundrel whom old
age alone kept from the active pursuit of the only calling he ever had
known--brigandage. Why should the boss's daughter come to Jose? Jose was
hand in glove with every cutthroat in Chihuahua, or at least within a
radius of two hundred miles of his abode.
</p><p>Barbara swung herself from the saddle, and handed her bridle reins to
Eddie.
</p><p>“Hold him, please,” she said. “I'll be gone but a moment.”
</p><p>“You're not goin' in there to see old Jose alone?” gasped Eddie.
</p><p>“Why not?” she asked. “If you're afraid you can leave my horse and ride
along home.”
</p><p>Eddie colored to the roots of his sandy hair, and kept silent. The girl
approached the doorway of the mean hovel and peered within. At one end
sat a bent old man, smoking. He looked up as Barbara's figure darkened
the doorway.
</p><p>“Jose!” said the girl.
</p><p>The old man rose to his feet and came toward her.
</p><p>“Eh? Senorita, eh?” he cackled.
</p><p>“You are Jose?” she asked.
</p><p>“Si, senorita,” replied the old Indian. “What can poor old Jose do to
serve the beautiful senorita?”
</p><p>“You can carry a message to one of Pesita's officers,” replied the girl.
“I have heard much about you since I came to Mexico. I know that there
is not another man in this part of Chihuahua who may so easily reach
Pesita as you.” She raised her hand for silence as the Indian would have
protested. Then she reached into the pocket of her riding breeches and
withdrew a handful of silver which she permitted to trickle, tinklingly,
from one palm to the other. “I wish you to go to the camp of Pesita,”
 she continued, “and carry word to the man who robbed the bank at
Cuivaca--he is an American--that his friend, Senor Bridge has been
captured by Villa and is being held for execution in Cuivaca. You must
go at once--you must get word to Senor Bridge's friend so that help may
reach Senor Bridge before dawn. Do you understand?”
</p><p>The Indian nodded assent.
</p><p>“Here,” said the girl, “is a payment on account. When I know that you
delivered the message in time you shall have as much more. Will you do
it?”
</p><p>“I will try,” said the Indian, and stretched forth a clawlike hand for
the money.
</p><p>“Good!” exclaimed Barbara. “Now start at once,” and she dropped the
silver coins into the old man's palm.
</p>
<p>It was dusk when Captain Billy Byrne was summoned to the tent of Pesita.
There he found a weazened, old Indian squatting at the side of the
outlaw.
</p><p>“Jose,” said Pesita, “has word for you.”
</p><p>Billy Byrne turned questioningly toward the Indian.
</p><p>“I have been sent, Senor Capitan,” explained Jose, “by the beautiful
senorita of El Orobo Rancho to tell you that your friend, Senor Bridge,
has been captured by General Villa, and is being held at Cuivaca, where
he will doubtless be shot--if help does not reach him before tomorrow
morning.”
</p><p>Pesita was looking questioningly at Byrne. Since the gringo had returned
from Cuivaca with the loot of the bank and turned the last penny of it
over to him the outlaw had looked upon his new captain as something just
short of superhuman. To have robbed the bank thus easily while Villa's
soldiers paced back and forth before the doorway seemed little short of
an indication of miraculous powers, while to have turned the loot
over intact to his chief, not asking for so much as a peso of it, was
absolutely incredible.
</p><p>Pesita could not understand this man; but he admired him greatly and
feared him, too. Such a man was worth a hundred of the ordinary run of
humanity that enlisted beneath Pesita's banners. Byrne had but to ask a
favor to have it granted, and now, when he called upon Pesita to
furnish him with a suitable force for the rescue of Bridge the brigand
enthusiastically acceded to his demands.
</p><p>“I will come,” he exclaimed, “and all my men shall ride with me. We will
take Cuivaca by storm. We may even capture Villa himself.”
</p><p>“Wait a minute, bo,” interrupted Billy Byrne. “Don't get excited. I'm
lookin' to get my pal outen' Cuivaca. After that I don't care who
you capture; but I'm goin' to get Bridgie out first. I ken do it with
twenty-five men--if it ain't too late. Then, if you want to, you can
shoot up the town. Lemme have the twenty-five, an' you hang around the
edges with the rest of 'em 'til I'm done. Whaddaya say?”
</p><p>Pesita was willing to agree to anything, and so it came that half an
hour later Billy Byrne was leading a choice selection of some two dozen
cutthroats down through the hills toward Cuivaca. While a couple of
miles in the rear followed Pesita with the balance of his band.
</p><p>Billy rode until the few remaining lights of Cuivaca shone but a short
distance ahead and they could hear plainly the strains of a grating
graphophone from beyond the open windows of a dance hall, and the voices
of the sentries as they called the hour.
</p><p>“Stay here,” said Billy to a sergeant at his side, “until you hear
a hoot owl cry three times from the direction of the barracks and
guardhouse, then charge the opposite end of the town, firing off your
carbines like hell an' yellin' yer heads off. Make all the racket you
can, an' keep it up 'til you get 'em comin' in your direction, see? Then
turn an' drop back slowly, eggin' 'em on, but holdin' 'em to it as long
as you can. Do you get me, bo?”
</p><p>From the mixture of Spanish and English and Granavenooish the sergeant
gleaned enough of the intent of his commander to permit him to salute
and admit that he understood what was required of him.
</p><p>Having given his instructions Billy Byrne rode off to the west, circled
Cuivaca and came close up upon the southern edge of the little village.
Here he dismounted and left his horse hidden behind an outbuilding,
while he crept cautiously forward to reconnoiter.
</p><p>He knew that the force within the village had no reason to fear attack.
Villa knew where the main bodies of his enemies lay, and that no force
could approach Cuivaca without word of its coming reaching the garrison
many hours in advance of the foe. That Pesita, or another of the several
bandit chiefs in the neighborhood would dare descend upon a garrisoned
town never for a moment entered the calculations of the rebel leader.
</p><p>For these reasons Billy argued that Cuivaca would be poorly guarded. On
the night he had spent there he had seen sentries before the bank, the
guardhouse, and the barracks in addition to one who paced to and fro in
front of the house in which the commander of the garrison maintained his
headquarters. Aside from these the town was unguarded.
</p><p>Nor were conditions different tonight. Billy came within a hundred yards
of the guardhouse before he discovered a sentinel. The fellow lolled
upon his gun in front of the building--an adobe structure in the rear
of the barracks. The other three sides of the guardhouse appeared to be
unwatched.
</p><p>Billy threw himself upon his stomach and crawled slowly forward stopping
often. The sentry seemed asleep. He did not move. Billy reached the
shadow at the side of the structure and some fifty feet from the soldier
without detection. Then he rose to his feet directly beneath a barred
window.
</p><p>Within Bridge paced back and forth the length of the little building. He
could not sleep. Tomorrow he was to be shot! Bridge did not wish to die.
That very morning General Villa in person had examined him. The general
had been exceedingly wroth--the sting of the theft of his funds still
irritated him; but he had given Bridge no inkling as to his fate. It had
remained for a fellow-prisoner to do that. This man, a deserter, was to
be shot, so he said, with Bridge, a fact which gave him an additional
twenty-four hours of life, since, he asserted, General Villa wished
to be elsewhere than in Cuivaca when an American was executed. Thus he
could disclaim responsibility for the act.
</p><p>The general was to depart in the morning. Shortly after, Bridge and the
deserter would be led out and blindfolded before a stone wall--if there
was such a thing, or a brick wall, or an adobe wall. It made little
difference to the deserter, or to Bridge either. The wall was but a
trivial factor. It might go far to add romance to whomever should read
of the affair later; but in so far as Bridge and the deserter were
concerned it meant nothing. A billboard, thought Bridge, bearing
the slogan: “Eventually! Why not now?” would have been equally as
efficacious and far more appropriate.
</p><p>The room in which he was confined was stuffy with the odor of
accumulated filth. Two small barred windows alone gave means of
ventilation. He and the deserter were the only prisoners. The latter
slept as soundly as though the morrow held nothing more momentous in his
destiny than any of the days that had preceded it. Bridge was moved to
kick the fellow into consciousness of his impending fate. Instead he
walked to the south window to fill his lungs with the free air beyond
his prison pen, and gaze sorrowfully at the star-lit sky which he should
never again behold.
</p><p>In a low tone Bridge crooned a snatch of the poem that he and Billy
liked best:
</p><p>  And you, my sweet Penelope, out there somewhere you wait for me,
  With buds of roses in your hair and kisses on your mouth.
</p><p>Bridge's mental vision was concentrated upon the veranda of a
white-walled ranchhouse to the east. He shook his head angrily.
</p><p>“It's just as well,” he thought. “She's not for me.”
</p><p>Something moved upon the ground beyond the window. Bridge became
suddenly intent upon the thing. He saw it rise and resolve itself into
the figure of a man, and then, in a low whisper, came a familiar voice:
</p>
<p>“There ain't no roses in my hair, but there's a barker in my shirt,
an' another at me side. Here's one of 'em. They got kisses beat a city
block. How's the door o' this thing fastened?” The speaker was quite
close to the window now, his face but a few inches from Bridge's.
</p><p>“Billy!” ejaculated the condemned man.
</p><p>“Surest thing you know; but about the door?”
</p><p>“Just a heavy bar on the outside,” replied Bridge.
</p><p>“Easy,” commented Billy, relieved. “Get ready to beat it when I open
the door. I got a pony south o' town that'll have to carry double for a
little way tonight.”
</p><p>“God bless you, Billy!” whispered Bridge, fervently.
</p><p>“Lay low a few minutes,” said Billy, and moved away toward the rear of
the guardhouse.
</p><p>A few minutes later there broke upon the night air the dismal hoot of
an owl. At intervals of a few seconds it was repeated twice. The sentry
before the guardhouse shifted his position and looked about, then he
settled back, transferring his weight to the other foot, and resumed his
bovine meditations.
</p><p>The man at the rear of the guardhouse moved silently along the side
of the structure until he stood within a few feet of the unsuspecting
sentinel, hidden from him by the corner of the building. A heavy
revolver dangled from his right hand. He held it loosely by the barrel,
and waited.
</p><p>For five minutes the silence of the night was unbroken, then from the
east came a single shot, followed immediately by a scattering fusillade
and a chorus of hoarse cries.
</p><p>Billy Byrne smiled. The sentry resumed indications of quickness. From
the barracks beyond the guardhouse came sharp commands and the sounds
of men running. From the opposite end of the town the noise of battle
welled up to ominous proportions.
</p><p>Billy heard the soldiers stream from their quarters and a moment later
saw them trot up the street at the double. Everyone was moving toward
the opposite end of the town except the lone sentinel before the
guardhouse. The moment seemed propitious for his attempt.
</p><p>Billy peered around the corner of the guardhouse. Conditions were
just as he had pictured they would be. The sentry stood gazing in the
direction of the firing, his back toward the guardhouse door and Billy.
</p><p>With a bound the American cleared the space between himself and the
unsuspecting and unfortunate soldier. The butt of the heavy revolver
fell, almost noiselessly, upon the back of the sentry's head, and the
man sank to the ground without even a moan.
</p><p>Turning to the door Billy knocked the bar from its place, the door swung
in and Bridge slipped through to liberty.
</p><p>“Quick!” said Billy. “Follow me,” and turned at a rapid run toward the
south edge of the town. He made no effort now to conceal his movements.
Speed was the only essential, and the two covered the ground swiftly and
openly without any attempt to take advantage of cover.
</p><p>They reached Billy's horse unnoticed, and a moment later were trotting
toward the west to circle the town and regain the trail to the north and
safety.
</p><p>To the east they heard the diminishing rifle fire of the combatants as
Pesita's men fell steadily back before the defenders, and drew them away
from Cuivaca in accordance with Billy's plan.
</p><p>“Like takin' candy from a baby,” said Billy, when the flickering lights
of Cuivaca shone to the south of them, and the road ahead lay clear to
the rendezvous of the brigands.
</p><p>“Yes,” agreed Bridge; “but what I'd like to know, Billy, is how you
found out I was there.”
</p><p>“Penelope,” said Byrne, laughing.
</p><p>“Penelope!” queried Bridge. “I'm not at all sure that I follow you,
Billy.”
</p><p>“Well, seein' as you're sittin' on behind you can't be leadin' me,”
 returned Billy; “but cuttin' the kid it was a skirt tipped it off to me
where you was--the beautiful senorita of El Orobo Rancho, I think Jose
called her. Now are you hep?”
</p><p>Bridge gave an exclamation of astonishment. “God bless her!” he said.
“She did that for me?”
</p><p>“She sure did,” Billy assured him, “an' I'll bet an iron case she's
a-waitin' for you there with buds o' roses in her hair an' kisses on her
mouth, you old son-of-a-gun, you.” Billy laughed happily. He was happy
anyway at having rescued Bridge, and the knowledge that his friend was
in love and that the girl reciprocated his affection--all of which Billy
assumed as the only explanation of her interest in Bridge--only added to
his joy. “She ain't a greaser is she?” he asked presently.
</p><p>“I should say not,” replied Bridge. “She's a perfect queen from New
York City; but, Billy, she's not for me. What she did was prompted by a
generous heart. She couldn't care for me, Billy. Her father is a wealthy
man--he could have the pick of the land--of many lands--if she cared to
marry. You don't think for a minute she'd want a hobo, do you?”
</p><p>“You can't most always tell,” replied Billy, a trifle sadly. “I knew
such a queen once who would have chosen a mucker, if he'd a-let her.
You're stuck on her, ol' man?”
</p><p>“I'm afraid I am, Billy,” Bridge admitted; “but what's the use? Let's
forget it. Oh, say, is this the horse I let you take the night you
robbed the bank?”
</p><p>“Yes,” said Billy; “same little pony, an' a mighty well-behaved one,
too. Why?”
</p><p>“It's hers,” said Bridge.
</p><p>“An' she wants it back?”
</p><p>“She didn't say so; but I'd like to get it to her some way,” said
Bridge.
</p><p>“You ride it back when you go,” suggested Billy.
</p><p>“But I can't go back,” said Bridge; “it was Grayson, the foreman, who
made it so hot for me I had to leave. He tried to arrest me and send me
to Villa.”
</p><p>“What for?” asked Billy.
</p><p>“He didn't like me, and wanted to get rid of me.” Bridge wouldn't say
that his relations with Billy had brought him into trouble.
</p><p>“Oh, well, I'll take it back myself then, and at the same time I'll tell
Penelope what a regular fellow you are, and punch in the foreman's face
for good luck.”
</p><p>“No, you mustn't go there. They know you now. It was some of El Orobo's
men you shot up day before yesterday when you took their steers from
them. They recognized the pony, and one of them had seen you in Cuivaca
the night of the robbery. They would be sure to get you, Billy.”
</p><p>Shortly the two came in touch with the retreating Pesitistas who were
riding slowly toward their mountain camp. Their pursuers had long since
given up the chase, fearing that they might be being lured into the
midst of a greatly superior force, and had returned to Cuivaca.
</p><p>It was nearly morning when Bridge and Billy threw themselves down upon
the latter's blankets, fagged.
</p><p>“Well, well,” murmured Billy Byrne; “li'l ol' Bridgie's found his
Penelope,” and fell asleep.
