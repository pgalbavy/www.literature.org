<p>They danced. Mr. Dowling should have found other forms of exercise
and pastime.</p>

<p>Nature has not designed everyone for dancing, though sometimes
those she has denied are the last to discover her niggardliness.
But the round young man was at least vigorous enough&mdash;too much
so, when his knees collided with Alice's&mdash;and he was too sturdy
to be thrown off his feet, himself, or to allow his partner to
fall when he tripped her. He held her up valiantly, and continued
to beat a path through the crowd of other dancers by main force.</p>

<p>He paid no attention to anything suggested by the efforts of
the musicians, and appeared to be unaware that there should have
been some connection between what they were doing and what he
was doing; but he may have listened to other music of his own,
for his expression was of high content; he seemed to feel no doubt
whatever that he was dancing. Alice kept as far away from him
as under the circumstances she could; and when they stopped she
glanced down, and found the execution of unseen manoeuvres, within
the protection of her skirt, helpful to one of her insteps and
to the toes of both of her slippers.</p>

<p>Her cheery partner was paddling his rosy brows with a fine handkerchief.
"That was great!" he said. "Let's go out and sit in the corridor;
they've got some comfortable chairs out there."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;let's not," she returned. "I believe I'd rather stay in
here and look at the crowd."</p>

<p>"No; that isn't it," he said, chiding her with a waggish forefinger.
"You think if you go out there you'll miss a chance of someone
else asking you for the next dance, and so you'll have to give
it to me."</p>

<p>"How absurd!" Then, after a look about her that revealed nothing
encouraging, she added graciously, "You can have the next if you
want it."</p>

<p>"Great!" he exclaimed, mechanically. "Now let's get out of here&mdash;out
of <em>THIS </em>room, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Why? What's the matter with&#11834;"</p>

<p>"My mother," Mr. Dowling explained. "But don't look at her. She
keeps motioning me to come and see after Ella, and I'm simply
<em>NOT </em>going to do it, you see!"</p>

<p>Alice laughed. "I don't believe it's so much that," she said,
and consented to walk with him to a point in the next room from
which Mrs. Dowling's continuous signalling could not be seen.
"Your mother hates me."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I wouldn't say that. No, she don't," he protested, innocently.
"She don't know you more than just to speak to, you see. So how
could she?"</p>

<p>"Well, she does. I can tell."</p>

<p>A frown appeared upon his rounded brow. "No; I'll tell you the
way she feels. It's like this: Ella isn't <em>TOO </em>popular,
you know&mdash;it's hard to see why, because she's a right nice girl,
in her way&mdash;and mother thinks I ought to look after her, you see.
She thinks I ought to dance a whole lot with her myself, and stir
up other fellows to dance with her&mdash;it's simply impossible to
make mother understand you <em>CAN'T </em>do that, you see. And
then about me, you see, if she had her way I wouldn't get to dance
with anybody at all except girls like Mildred Palmer and Henrietta
Lamb. Mother wants to run my whole programme for me, you understand,
but the trouble of it is&mdash;about girls like that, you see well,
I couldn't do what she wants, even if I wanted to myself, because
you take those girls, and by the time I get Ella off my hands
for a minute, why, their dances are always every last one taken,
and where do I come in?"</p>

<p>Alice nodded, her amiability undamaged. "I see. So that's why
you dance with me."</p>

<p>"No, I like to," he protested. "I rather dance with you than
I do with those girls." And he added with a retrospective determination
which showed that he had been through quite an experience with
Mrs. Dowling in this matter. "I <em>TOLD </em>mother I would,
too!"</p>

<p>"Did it take all your courage, Frank?"</p>

<p>He looked at her shrewdly. "Now you're trying to tease me," he
said. "I don't care; I <em>WOULD </em>rather dance with you! In
the first place, you're a perfectly beautiful dancer, you see,
and in the second, a man feels a lot more comfortable with you
than he does with them. Of course I know almost all the other
fellows get along with those girls all right; but I don't waste
any time on 'em I don't have to. <em>I</em> like people that are
always cordial to everybody, you see&mdash;the way you are."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, I <em>MEAN </em>it," he insisted. "There goes the band again.
Shall we?"</p>

<p>"Suppose we sit it out?" she suggested. "I believe I'd like to
go out in the corridor, after all&mdash;it's pretty warm in here."</p>

<p>Assenting cheerfully, Dowling conducted her to a pair of easy-chairs
within a secluding grove of box-trees, and when they came to this
retreat they found Mildred Palmer just departing, under escort
of a well-favoured gentleman about thirty. As these two walked
slowly away, in the direction of the dancing-floor, they left
it not to be doubted that they were on excellent terms with each
other; Mildred was evidently willing to make their progress even
slower, for she halted momentarily, once or twice; and her upward
glances to her tall companion's face were of a gentle, almost
blushing deference. Never before had Alice seen anything like
this in her friend's manner.</p>

<p>"How queer!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"What's queer?" Dowling inquired as they sat down.</p>

<p>"Who was that man?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you met him?"</p>

<p>"I never saw him before. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Why, it's this Arthur Russell."</p>

<p>"What Arthur Russell? I never heard of him." Mr. Dowling was
puzzled. "Why, <em>THAT'S </em>funny! Only the last time I saw
you, you were telling me how awfully well you knew Mildred Palmer."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly I do," Alice informed him. "She's my most intimate
friend."</p>

<p>"That's what makes it seem so funny you haven't heard anything
about this Russell, because everybody says even if she isn't engaged
to him right now, she most likely will be before very long. I
must say it looks a good deal that way to me, myself."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" Alice exclaimed. "She's never even mentioned
him to me."</p>

<p>The young man glanced at her dubiously and passed a finger over
the tiny prong that dashingly composed the whole substance of
his moustache.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Mildred IS pretty reserved," he remarked. "This
Russell is some kind of cousin of the Palmer family, I understand."</p>

<p>"He is?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;second or third or something, the girls say. You see, my
sister Ella hasn't got much to do at home, and don't read anything,
or sew, or play solitaire, you see; and she hears about pretty
much everything that goes on, you see. Well, Ella says a lot of
the girls have been talking about Mildred and this Arthur Russell
for quite a while back, you see. They were all wondering what
he was going to look like, you see; because he only got here yesterday;
and that proves she must have been talking to some of 'em, or
else how&#11834;"</p>

<p>Alice laughed airily, but the pretty sound ended abruptly with
an audible intake of breath. "Of course, while Mildred IS my most
intimate friend," she said, "I don't mean she tells me everything&mdash;and
naturally she has other friends besides. What else did your sister
say she told them about this Mr. Russell?"</p>

<p>"Well, it seems he's <em>VERY </em>well off; at least Henrietta
Lamb told Ella he was. Ella says&#11834;"</p>

<p>Alice interrupted again, with an increased irritability. "Oh,
never mind what Ella says! Let's find something better to talk
about than Mr. Russell!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'M willing," Mr. Dowling assented, ruefully. "What you
want to talk about?"</p>

<p>But this liberal offer found her unresponsive; she sat leaning
back, silent, her arms along the arms of her chair, and her eyes,
moist and bright, fixed upon a wide doorway where the dancers
fluctuated. She was disquieted by more than Mildred's reserve,
though reserve so marked had certainly the significance of a warning
that Alice's definition, "my most intimate friend," lacked sanction.
Indirect notice to this effect could not well have been more emphatic,
but the sting of it was left for a later moment. Something else
preoccupied Alice: she had just been surprised by an odd experience.
At first sight of this Mr. Arthur Russell, she had said to herself
instantly, in words as definite as if she spoke them aloud, though
they seemed more like words spoken to her by some unknown person
within her: "There! That's exactly the kind of looking man I'd
like to marry!"</p>

<p>In the eyes of the restless and the longing, Providence often
appears to be worse than inscrutable: an unreliable Omnipotence
given to haphazard whimsies in dealing with its own creatures,
choosing at random some among them to be rent with tragic deprivations
and others to be petted with blessing upon blessing.</p>

<p>In Alice's eyes, Mildred had been blessed enough; something ought
to be left over, by this time, for another girl. The final touch
to the heaping perfection of Christmas-in-everything for Mildred
was that this Mr. Arthur Russell, good-looking, kind-looking,
graceful, the perfect fiance, should be also "<em>VERY </em>well
off." Of course! These rich always married one another. And while
the Mildreds danced with their Arthur Russells the best an outsider
could do for herself was to sit with Frank Dowling&mdash;the one last
course left her that was better than dancing with him.</p>

<p>"Well, what DO you want to talk about?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Nothing," she said. "Suppose we just sit, Frank." But a moment
later she remembered something, and, with a sudden animation,
began to prattle. She pointed to the musicians down the corridor.
"Oh, look at them! Look at the leader! Aren't they <em>FUNNY?
</em>Someone told me they're called 'Jazz Louie and his half-breed
bunch.' Isn't that just crazy? Don't you love it? Do watch them,
Frank."</p>

<p>She continued to chatter, and, while thus keeping his glance
away from herself, she detached the forlorn bouquet of dead violets
from her dress and laid it gently beside the one she had carried.</p>

<p>The latter already reposed in the obscurity selected for it at
the base of one of the box-trees.</p>

<p>Then she was abruptly silent.</p>

<p>"You certainly are a funny girl," Dowling remarked. "You say
you don't want to talk about anything at all, and all of a sudden
you break out and talk a blue streak; and just about the time
I begin to get interested in what you're saying you shut off!
What's the matter with girls, anyhow, when they do things like
that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; we're just queer, I guess."</p>

<p>"I say so! Well, what'll we do <em>NOW? </em>Talk, or just sit?"</p>

<p>"Suppose we just sit some more."</p>

<p>"Anything to oblige," he assented. "I'm willing to sit as long
as you like."</p>

<p>But even as he made his amiability clear in this matter, the
peace was threatened&mdash;his mother came down the corridor like a
rolling, ominous cloud. She was looking about her on all sides,
in a fidget of annoyance, searching for him, and to his dismay
she saw him. She immediately made a horrible face at his companion,
beckoned to him imperiously with a dumpy arm, and shook her head
reprovingly. The unfortunate young man tried to repulse her with
an icy stare, but this effort having obtained little to encourage
his feeble hope of driving her away, he shifted his chair so that
his back was toward her discomfiting pantomime. He should have
known better, the instant result was Mrs. Dowling in motion at
an impetuous waddle.</p>

<p>She entered the box-tree seclusion with the lower rotundities
of her face hastily modelled into the resemblance of an over-benevolent
smile a contortion which neglected to spread its intended geniality
upward to the exasperated eyes and anxious forehead.</p>

<p>"I think your mother wants to speak to you, Frank," Alice said,
upon this advent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dowling nodded to her. "Good evening, Miss Adams," she said.
"I just thought as you and Frank weren't dancing you wouldn't
mind my disturbing you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Not at all," Alice murmured.</p>

<p>Mr. Dowling seemed of a different mind. "Well, what DO you want?"
he inquired, whereupon his mother struck him roguishly with her
fan.</p>

<p>"Bad fellow!" She turned to Alice. "I'm sure you won't mind excusing
him to let him do something for his old mother, Miss Adams."</p>

<p>"What DO you want?" the son repeated.</p>

<p>"Two very nice things," Mrs. Dowling informed him. "Everybody
is so anxious for Henrietta Lamb to have a pleasant evening, because
it's the very first time she's been anywhere since her father's
death, and of course her dear grandfather's an old friend of ours,
and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well, well!" her son interrupted. "Miss Adams isn't interested
in all this, mother."</p>

<p>"But Henrietta came to speak to Ella and me, and I told her you
were so anxious to dance with her&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Here!" he cried. "Look here! I'd rather do my own&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes; that's just it," Mrs. Dowling explained. "I just thought
it was such a good opportunity; and Henrietta said she had most
of her dances taken, but she'd give you one if you asked her before
they were all gone. So I thought you'd better see her as soon
as possible."</p>

<p>Dowling's face had become rosy. "I refuse to do anything of the
kind."</p>

<p>"Bad fellow!" said his mother, gaily. "I thought this would be
the best time for you to see Henrietta, because it won't be long
till all her dances are gone, and you've promised on your <em>WORD
</em>to dance the next with Ella, and you mightn't have a chance
to do it then. I'm sure Miss Adams won't mind if you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Not at all," Alice said.</p>

<p>"Well, <em>I</em> mind!" he said. "I wish you <em>COULD </em>understand
that when I want to dance with any girl I don't need my mother
to ask her for me. I really AM more than six years old!"</p>

<p>He spoke with too much vehemence, and Mrs. Dowling at once saw
how to have her way. As with husbands and wives, so with many
fathers and daughters, and so with some sons and mothers: the
man will himself be cross in public and think nothing of it, nor
will he greatly mind a little crossness on the part of the woman;
but let her show agitation before any spectator, he is instantly
reduced to a coward's slavery. Women understand that ancient weakness,
of course; for it is one of their most important means of defense,
but can be used ignobly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dowling permitted a tremulousness to become audible in her
voice. "It isn't very&mdash;very pleasant&mdash;to be talked to like that
by your own son&mdash;before strangers!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my! Look here!" the stricken Dowling protested. "<em>I</em>
didn't say anything, mother. I was just joking about how you never
get over thinking I'm a little boy. I only&#11834;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Dowling continued: "I just thought I was doing you a little
favour. I didn't think it would make you so angry."</p>

<p>"Mother, for goodness' sake! Miss Adams'll think&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I suppose," Mrs. Dowling interrupted, piteously, "I suppose
it doesn't matter what <em>I</em> think!"</p>

<p>"Oh, gracious!"</p>

<p>Alice interfered; she perceived that the ruthless Mrs. Dowling
meant to have her way. "I think you'd better go, Frank. Really."</p>

<p>"There!" his mother cried. "Miss Adams says so, herself! What
more do you want?"</p>

<p>"Oh, gracious!" he lamented again, and, with a sick look over
his shoulder at Alice, permitted his mother to take his arm and
propel him away. Mrs. Dowling's spirits had strikingly recovered
even before the pair passed from the corridor: she moved almost
bouncingly beside her embittered son, and her eyes and all the
convolutions of her abundant face were blithe.</p>

<p>Alice went in search of Walter, but without much hope of finding
him. What he did with himself at frozen-face dances was one of
his most successful mysteries, and her present excursion gave
her no clue leading to its solution. When the musicians again
lowered their instruments for an interval she had returned, alone,
to her former seat within the partial shelter of the box-trees.</p>

<p>She had now to practice an art that affords but a limited variety
of methods, even to the expert: the art of seeming to have an
escort or partner when there is none. The practitioner must imply,
merely by expression and attitude, that the supposed companion
has left her for only a few moments, that she herself has sent
him upon an errand; and, if possible, the minds of observers must
be directed toward a conclusion that this errand of her devising
is an amusing one; at all events, she is alone temporarily and
of choice, not deserted. She awaits a devoted man who may return
at any instant.</p>

<p>Other people desired to sit in Alice's nook, but discovered her
in occupancy. She had moved the vacant chair closer to her own,
and she sat with her arm extended so that her hand, holding her
lace kerchief, rested upon the back of this second chair, claiming
it. Such a preemption, like that of a traveller's bag in the rack,
was unquestionable; and, for additional evidence, sitting with
her knees crossed, she kept one foot continuously moving a little,
in cadence with the other, which tapped the floor. Moreover, she
added a fine detail: her half-smile, with the under lip caught,
seemed to struggle against repression, as if she found the service
engaging her absent companion even more amusing than she would
let him see when he returned: there was jovial intrigue of some
sort afoot, evidently. Her eyes, beaming with secret fun, were
averted from intruders, but sometimes, when couples approached,
seeking possession of the nook, her thoughts about the absentee
appeared to threaten her with outright laughter; and though one
or two girls looked at her skeptically, as they turned away, their
escorts felt no such doubts, and merely wondered what importantly
funny affair Alice Adams was engaged in. She had learned to do
it perfectly.</p>

<p>She had learned it during the last two years; she was twenty
when for the first time she had the shock of finding herself without
an applicant for one of her dances. When she was sixteen "all
the nice boys in town,"  as her mother said, crowded the Adamses'
small veranda and steps, or sat near by, cross-legged on the lawn,
on summer evenings; and at eighteen she had replaced the boys
with "the older men." By this time most of "the other girls,"
her contemporaries, were away at school or college, and when they
came home to stay, they "came out"&mdash;that feeble revival of an
ancient custom offering the maiden to the ceremonial inspection
of the tribe. Alice neither went away nor "came out," and, in
contrast with those who did, she may have seemed to lack freshness
of lustre&mdash;jewels are richest when revealed all new in a white
velvet box. And Alice may have been too eager to secure new retainers,
too kind in her efforts to keep the old ones. She had been a belle
too soon.</p>
