<p>Up the narrow valley, over the unbroken sweep of treetops, arose
tumbled peaks; and above the Golden Dome, pushing straight upward
into the flawless blue of heaven, towered a cloud, its inky convolutions
edged with silver.</p>

<p>Jones inspected the thunderhead with disapproval; Ellis offered
his rod, and, being refused, began some clever casting, the artistic
beauty of which was lost upon Jones.</p>

<p>One trout only investigated the red-and-white fly; and, that
fish safely creeled, Ellis turned to his companion:</p>

<p>"Three years ago, when I last came here, this reach was more
prolific. But there's a pool above that I'll warrant. Shall we
move?"</p>

<p>As they passed on upstream Jones said: "There's no pool above,
only a rapid."</p>

<p>"You're in error," said Ellis, confidently. "I've known every
pool on the Caranay for years."</p>

<p>"But there is no pool above&mdash;unless you mean to trespass."</p>

<p>"Trespass!" repeated Ellis, aghast. "<em>Trespass</em> in the
free Caranay forests! You&mdash;you don't mean to say that any preserve
has been established on the Caranay! I haven't been here for three
years.... <em>Do</em> you?"</p>

<p>"Look there," said Jones, pointing to a high fence of netted
wire which rose above the undergrowth and cut the banks of the
stream in two with a barrier eight feet high; "that's what stopped
me. There's their home-designed trespass notice hanging to the
fence. Read it; it's worth perusal."</p>

<p>Speechless, but still incredulous, Ellis strode to the barrier
and looked up. And this is what he read printed in mincing "Art
Nouveau" type upon a swinging zinc sign fashioned to imitate something
or other which was no doubt very precious:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
<em>OYEZ</em>!

</p>
<p>
Ye simple livers of ye simpler life have raised thys barrier<br/>
against ye World, ye Flesh and ye Devyl. Turn back in Peace and<br/>
leave us to our Nunnery.

</p>
</div>
<p>  YE <em>MAIDS AND DAMES OF VASSAR</em>.</p>

<p>"What the devil is that nonsense?" demanded Ellis hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Explained on our next tree," remarked Jones, wiping his eyeglasses
indifferently.</p>

<p>An ordinary trespass notice printed on white linen was nailed
to the flank of a great pine; and, below this, a special warning,
done in red on a white board:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
<em>NOTICE</em>!

</p>
<p>
This property belongs to the Vassar College Summer School.<br/>
Fishing, shooting, trapping, the felling of trees, the picking of<br/>
wild flowers, and every form of trespass, being strictly<br/>
forbidden, all violators of this ordinance under the law will be<br/>
prosecuted. One hundred dollars reward is offered for evidence<br/>
leading to the detection and conviction of any trespasser upon<br/>
this property.

</div>
<p>  <em>THE DIRECTORS OF THE VASSAR SUMMER SCHOOL</em>.</p>

<p>"Well?" inquired Jones, as Ellis stood motionless, staring at
the sign. The latter slowly turned an enraged visage toward his
companion.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" repeated Jones, curiously.</p>

<p>"Do? I'm going to fish the Caranay. Come on."</p>

<p>"Trespass on Vassar?" asked Jones.</p>

<p>"I'm going to fish the Caranay, my old and favorite and beloved
stream," retorted Ellis, doggedly. "Do you suppose a dinky zinc
sign in this forest can stop me? Come on, Jones. I'll show you
a trout worth tossing this Caranay Belle to." And he looped on
a silver-and-salmon-tinted fly and waded out into the rapids.</p>

<p>Jones lighted his pipe and followed him, giving his views of
several matters in a voice pitched above the whispering rush of
the ripples:</p>

<p>"That's all very well, Ellis, but suppose we are pinched and
fined? A nice place, these forests, for a simple liver to lead
a simple life in! Simple life! What? And some of these writers
define the 'simple life' as merely a 'state of mind.' That's right,
too; I was in a state of mind until I met you, let me tell you!
They're perfectly correct; it is a state of mind."</p>

<p>He muttered to himself, casting an anxious eye on the thundercloud
which stretched almost to the zenith over the Golden Dome and
shadowed Lynx Peak like a pall.</p>

<p>"Rain, too," he commented, wading in Ellis's wake. "There's a
most devilish look about that cloud. I wish I were a woodchuck&mdash;or
a shiner, or an earnest young thing from Vassar. What are we to
do if pinched with the goods on us, Ellis?"</p>

<p>The other laughed a disagreeable laugh and splashed forward.</p>

<p>"Because," continued Jones, wiping the spray from his glasses,
"the woods yonder may be teeming with these same young things
from Vassar. Old 'uns, too&mdash;there's a faculty for that Summer
School. You can never tell what a member of a ladies' Summer School
faculty would do to you. I dare say they might run after you and
frisk you for a kiss&mdash;out here in the backwoods."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about this absurd Summer School?" asked
Ellis, halting to wait for his companion.</p>

<p>"Only what the newspapers print."</p>

<p>"And what's that? I've not noticed anything about it."</p>

<p>"Why, they all tell about the scope of the Vassar Summer School.
It's founded"&mdash;and he grinned maliciously&mdash;"on the simple life."</p>

<p>"How?" snapped Ellis, clambering up out of the water to the flat,
sandy shore of an exquisite pool some forty rods in length.</p>

<p>"Why, this way: The Vassar undergraduates, who formerly, after
commencement, scattered into all the complexities of a silly,
unprofitable, good old summer time, now have a chance to acquire
simplicity and a taste for the rudimentary pleasures and pursuits
they have overlooked in their twentieth-century gallop after the
complex."</p>

<p>Ellis sullenly freed his line and glanced up at the clouds. It
was already raining on the Golden Dome.</p>

<p>"So," continued Jones, "the Summer School took to the woods along
with the rest of the simple-minded. I hear they have a library;
doubtless it contains the <em>Outlook</em> and the Rollo books.
They have courses in the earlier and simpler languages&mdash;the dead
'uns &mdash;Sanskrit, Greek, Latin; English, too, before it grew
pin-feathers. They have a grand-stand built of logs out yonder
where the mosquito hummeth; and some trees and a pond which they
call a theatre devoted to the portrayal of the great primitive
and simple passions and emotions. They have also dammed up the
stream to make a real lake when they give tank-dramas like Lohengrin
and the Rheingold; and the papers say they have a pair of live
swans hitched to a boat&mdash;that is, a yellow reporter swears they
have, but he was discovered taking snapshots at some Rhine-wine
daughters, and hustled out of the woods&#11834;"</p>

<p>He paused to watch Ellis hook and play and presently land a splendid
trout weighing close to two pounds.</p>

<p>"It's an outrage, an infernal outrage, for such people to dam
the Caranay and invade this God-given forest with their unspeakable
tin signs!" said Ellis, casting again.</p>

<p>"But they're only looking for a simpler life&mdash;just like you."</p>

<p>Ellis said something.</p>

<p>"That," replied Jones, "is a simple and ancient word expressing
tersely one of the simplest and most primitive passions. You know,
the simple life is merely a "state of mind"; you're acquiring
it; I recognize the symptoms."</p>

<p>Ellis made another observation, more or less mandatory.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is a locality purely mythical, according to our later
exponents of theology; therefore I cannot accept the suggestion
to go there&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Confound it!" exclaimed Ellis, laughing, as he landed a trout,
"let up on your joking. I'm mad all through, and it's beginning
to rain. When that thunder comes nearer it will end the fishing,
too. Look at Lynx Peak! Did you see that play of lightning? There's
a corker of a storm brewing. I hope," he added, savagely, "it
will carry away their confounded dam and their ridiculous lake.
The nerve of women to dam a trout stream like the Caranay....
What was that you said?"</p>

<p>"I said," hissed Jones in a weird whisper, "that there are two
girls standing behind us and taking our pictures with a kodak!
Don't look around, man! They'll snap-shoot us for evidence!"</p>

<p>But the caution was too late; Ellis had turned. There came a
click of a kodak shutter; Jones turned in spite of himself; another
click sounded.</p>

<p>"Stang!" breathed Jones as two young girls stepped from the shelter
of a juniper brush and calmly confronted the astonished trespassers.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to trouble you," said the taller one severely,
"but this is private property."</p>

<p>Ellis took off his cap; Jones did the same.</p>

<p>"I saw your signs," said Ellis, pleasantly. Jones whispered to
him: "The taller one is a corker!" and Ellis replied under his
breath: "The other is attractive, too."</p>

<p>"You admit that you deliberately trespassed?" inquired the shorter
girl very gravely.</p>

<p>"Not upon you&mdash;only upon what you call your property," said Ellis,
gaily. "You see, we really need the trout in our business&mdash;which
is to keep soul and body on friendly terms."</p>

<p>No answering smile touched the pretty grey eyes fixed on his.
She said gravely: "I am very sorry that this has happened."</p>

<p>"We're sorry, too," smiled Jones, "although we can scarcely regret
the charming accident which permits us&#11834;"</p>

<p>But it wouldn't do; the taller girl stared at him coldly from
a pair of ornamental brown eyes.</p>

<p>Presently she said: "We students are supposed to report cases
like this. If you have deliberately chosen to test the law governing
the protection of private property no doubt our Summer School
authorities will be willing to gratify you before a proper tribunal....
May I ask your names?" She drew a notebook from the pocket of
her kilted skirt, standing gracefully with pencil poised, dark
eyes focused upon Jones. And, as she waited, the thunder boomed
behind the Golden Dome.</p>

<p>"It's going to rain cats and dogs," said Jones, anxiously "and
you haven't an umbrella&#11834;"</p>

<p>The dark-eyed girl gazed at him scornfully. "Do you refuse your
name?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;oh, not at all!" said Jones hastily; "my name is Jones&#11834;"</p>

<p>The scorn deepened. "And&mdash;is this Mr. Smith?" she inquired, looking
at Ellis.</p>

<p>"My name <em>is</em> Jones," said Jones so earnestly that his
glasses fell off. "And what's worse, it's John Jones."</p>

<p>Something in his eye engaged her attention&mdash;perhaps the unwinking
innocence of it. She wrote "John Jones" on her pad, noted his
town address, and turned to Ellis, who was looking fixedly, but
not offensively, at the girl with the expressive grey eyes.</p>

<p>"If you have a pad I'll surrender to you," he said, amiably.
"There is glory enough for all here, as our admiral once remarked."</p>

<p>The grey eyes glimmered; a quiver touched the scarlet mouth.
But a crash of nearer thunder whitened the smile on her lips.</p>

<p>"Helen, I'm going!" she said hastily to her of the brown eyes.</p>

<p>"That storm," said Ellis calmly, "has a long way to travel before
it strikes the Caranay valley." He pointed with his rod, tracing
in the sky the route of the crowding clouds. "Every storm that
hatches behind the Golden Dome swings south along the Black Water
first, then curves and comes around by the west and sweeps the
Caranay. You have plenty of time to take my name."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but the play? I was thinking of the play," she said, looking
anxiously at the brown eyes, which were raised to the sky in silent
misgiving.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind my saying so," said Ellis, "there is ample
time for your outdoor theatricals&mdash;if you mean that. You need
not look for that storm on the upper Caranay before late this
afternoon. Even then it may break behind the mountains and you
may see no rain&mdash;only a flood in the river."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I do; I can almost answer for it. You see, the Caranay has been
my haunt for many years, and I know almost to a certainty what
is likely to happen here."</p>

<p>"That is jolly!" she exclaimed, greatly relieved. "Helen, I really
think we should be starting&#11834;"</p>

<p>But Helen, pencil poised, gazed obdurately at Ellis out of brown
eyes which were scarcely fashioned for such impartial and inexorable
work.</p>

<p>"If your name is not Smith I should be very glad to note it,"
she said.</p>

<p>So he laughed and told her who he was and where he lived; and
she wrote it down, somewhat shakily.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said, "you cannot be the <em>artist</em> &mdash;James
Lowell Ellis, <em>the</em> artist&mdash;the great&#11834;"</p>

<p>She hesitated; brown eyes and grey eyes, very wide now, were
concentrated on him. Jones, too, stared, and Ellis laughed.</p>

<p>"<em>Are</em> you?" blurted out Jones. "Great Heaven! I never
supposed&#11834;"</p>

<p>Ellis joined in a quartet of silence, then laughed again, a short,
embarrassed laugh.</p>

<p>"You <em>don't</em> look like anything famous, you know," said
Jones reproachfully. "Why didn't you tell me who you are? Why,
man, I own two of your pictures!"</p>

<p>To brown-eyes, known so far as "Helen," Ellis said: "We painters
are a bad lot, you see&mdash;but don't let that prejudice you against
Mr. Jones; he really doesn't know me very well. Besides, I dragged
him into this villainy; didn't I, Jones? You didn't want to trespass,
you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, come!" said Jones; "I own two of your pictures&mdash;the Amourette
and the Corrida. That ought to convict me of almost anything."</p>

<p>Grey-eyes said: "We&mdash;my father&mdash;has the Espagnolita, Mr. Ellis."
She blushed when she finished.</p>

<p>"Why, then, you must be Miss Sandys!" said Ellis quickly. "Mr.
Kenneth Sandys owns that picture."</p>

<p>The brown eyes, which had widened, then sparkled, then softened
as matters developed, now became uncompromisingly beautiful.</p>

<p>"I am dreadfully sorry," she said, looking at her notebook. "I
trust that the school authorities may not press matters." Then
she raised her eyes to see what Jones's expression might resemble.
It resembled absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>After a silence Miss Sandys said: "Do you think Helen, that we
are&mdash;that we ought to report this&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Molly, I do."</p>

<p>"I'm only an architect; fine me, but spare my friend, Ellis,"
said Jones far too playfully to placate the brown-eyed Helen.
She returned his glance with a scrutiny devoid of expression.
The thunder boomed along the flanks of Lynx Peak.</p>

<p>"We&mdash;we are very sorry," whispered Miss Sandys.</p>

<p>"I am, too," replied Ellis&mdash;not meaning anything concerning his
legal predicament.</p>

<p>Brown-eyes looked at Jones; there was a little inclination of
her pretty head as she passed them. A moment later the two young
men stood alone, caps in hand, gazing fixedly into the gathering
dimness of Caranay forest.</p>
