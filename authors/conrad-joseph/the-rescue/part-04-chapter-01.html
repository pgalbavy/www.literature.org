<p>Lingard brought Mrs. Travers away from the yacht, going alone
with her in the little boat. During the bustle of the embarkment,
and till the last of the crew had left the schooner, he had remained
towering and silent by her side. It was only when the murmuring
and uneasy voices of the sailors going away in the boats had been
completely lost in the distance that his voice was heard, grave
in the silence, pronouncing the words&mdash;"Follow me." She followed
him; their footsteps rang hollow and loud on the empty deck. At
the bottom of the steps he turned round and said very low:</p>

<p>"Take care."</p>

<p>He got into the boat and held on. It seemed to him that she was
intimidated by the darkness. She felt her arm gripped firmly&mdash;"I've
got you," he said. She stepped in, headlong, trusting herself
blindly to his grip, and sank on the stern seat catching her breath
a little. She heard a slight splash, and the indistinct side of
the deserted yacht melted suddenly into the body of the night.</p>

<p>Rowing, he faced her, a hooded and cloaked shape, and above her
head he had before his eyes the gleam of the stern lantern expiring
slowly on the abandoned vessel. When it went out without a warning
flicker he could see nothing of the stranded yacht's outline.
She had vanished utterly like a dream; and the occurrences of
the last twenty-four hours seemed also to be a part of a vanished
dream. The hooded and cloaked figure was part of it, too. It spoke
not; it moved not; it would vanish presently. Lingard tried to
remember Mrs. Travers' features, even as she sat within two feet
of him in the boat. He seemed to have taken from that vanished
schooner not a woman but a memory&mdash;the tormenting recollection
of a human being he would see no more.</p>

<p>At every stroke of the short sculls Mrs. Travers felt the boat
leap forward with her. Lingard, to keep his direction, had to
look over his shoulder frequently&mdash;"You will be safe in the brig,"
he said. She was silent. A dream! A dream! He lay back vigorously;
the water slapped loudly against the blunt bows. The ruddy glow
thrown afar by the flares was reflected deep within the hood.
The dream had a pale visage, the memory had living eyes.</p>

<p>"I had to come for you myself," he said.</p>

<p>"I expected it of you." These were the first words he had heard
her say since they had met for the third time.</p>

<p>"And I swore&mdash;before you, too&mdash;that I would never put my foot
on board your craft."</p>

<p>"It was good of you to&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"I forgot somehow," he said, simply.</p>

<p>"I expected it of you," she repeated. He gave three quick strokes
before he asked very gently:</p>

<p>"What more do you expect?"</p>

<p>"Everything," she said. He was rounding then the stern of the
brig and had to look away. Then he turned to her.</p>

<p>"And you trust me to&mdash;" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I would like to trust you," she interrupted, "because&mdash;"</p>

<p>Above them a startled voice cried in Malay, "Captain coming."
The strange sound silenced her. Lingard laid in his sculls and
she saw herself gliding under the high side of the brig. A dark,
staring face appeared very near her eyes, black fingers caught
the gunwale of the boat. She stood up swaying. "Take care," said
Lingard again, but this time, in the light, did not offer to help
her. She went up alone and he followed her over the rail.</p>

<p>The quarter-deck was thronged by men of two races. Lingard and
Mrs. Travers crossed it rapidly between the groups that moved
out of the way on their passage. Lingard threw open the cabin
door for her, but remained on deck to inquire about his boats.
They had returned while he was on board the yacht, and the two
men in charge of them came aft to make their reports. The boat
sent north had seen nothing. The boat which had been directed
to explore the banks and islets to the south had actually been
in sight of Daman's praus. The man in charge reported that several
fires were burning on the shore, the crews of the two praus being
encamped on a sandbank. Cooking was going on. They had been near
enough to hear the voices. There was a man keeping watch on the
ridge; they knew this because they heard him shouting to the people
below, by the fires. Lingard wanted to know how they had managed
to remain unseen. "The night was our hiding place," answered the
man in his deep growling voice. He knew nothing of any white men
being in Daman's camp. Why should there be? Rajah Hassim and the
Lady, his sister, appeared unexpectedly near his boat in their
canoe. Rajah Hassim had ordered him then in whispers to go back
to the brig at once, and tell Tuan what he had observed. Rajah
Hassim said also that he would return to the brig with more news
very soon. He obeyed because the Rajah was to him a person of
authority, "having the perfect knowledge of Tuan's mind as we
all know."&mdash;"Enough," cried Lingard, suddenly.</p>

<p>The man looked up heavily for a moment, and retreated forward
without another word. Lingard followed him with irritated eyes.
A new power had come into the world, had possessed itself of human
speech, had imparted to it a sinister irony of allusion. To be
told that someone had "a perfect knowledge of his mind" startled
him and made him wince. It made him aware that now he did not
know his mind himself&mdash;that it seemed impossible for him ever
to regain that knowledge. And the new power not only had cast
its spell upon the words he had to hear, but also upon the facts
that assailed him, upon the people he saw, upon the thoughts he
had to guide, upon the feelings he had to bear. They remained
what they had ever been&mdash;the visible surface of life open in the
sun to the conquering tread of an unfettered will. Yesterday they
could have been discerned clearly, mastered and despised; but
now another power had come into the world, and had cast over them
all the wavering gloom of a dark and inscrutable purpose.</p>
