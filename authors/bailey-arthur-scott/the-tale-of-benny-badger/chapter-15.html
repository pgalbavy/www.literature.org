<p>Benny Badger smiled at the owl. He thought he must be fooling.
</p>
<p>"You're a joker, aren't you?" said Benny. "But I never should have
thought it--you look so glum."
</p><p>The owl seemed somewhat displeased.
</p><p>"I've never made a joke yet," he declared, "though I've no doubt I
could, if I should ever want to."
</p><p>Benny Badger glanced from the owl to the hole, and then back again at
the strange fellow.
</p><p>"You don't mean to say you live here, in this hole?" Benny exclaimed.
</p><p>[Illustration: Benny Seized Mr. Coyote's Paw.]
</p><p>"Certainly; I do," the owl replied sharply.
</p><p>Benny Badger couldn't understand how that could be.
</p><p>"But this is a prairie dog house," he protested. . . . "Where's the
chap that built it? He must be around here somewhere."
</p><p>"I don't know where he is, and I don't care where he is," the owl
answered. "I drove him out of this house because I wanted to live here
myself. And I didn't trouble myself to see where he went."
</p><p>Benny Badger could hardly believe what the owl told him. But he noticed
that the fellow had a sharp beak, and sharp claws too.
</p><p>"I should think you played a joke on the prairie dog," he remarked at
last.
</p><p>"Should you?" said the owl. "If it <u>was</u> a joke, it wasn't nearly as
big a one as I'll play on anybody that tries to drive <u>me</u> away from
here. . . . I drove a snake away yesterday," he added. And he looked
very thoughtfully at Benny Badger, as if he were picking out a soft
place in which to sink his cruel beak.
</p><p>"You needn't be so touchy," said Benny. "I'm not going to disturb you.
I'm sure I shouldn't care to live in your house."
</p><p>The owl was a peppery fellow. He grew angry at once.
</p><p>"Why not?" he demanded. "What's the matter with my house?"
</p><p>"I'll tell you," Benny replied. "It's a second-hand one. And that's bad
enough. But it would be still worse if I took it away from you, because
then it would be third-hand."
</p><p>The owl looked daggers at him.
</p><p>"You've insulted me!" he cried loudly, swelling himself up--or so it
seemed.
</p><p>"Have I?" Benny Badger inquired. "Don't mention it! I'm sure you're
quite welcome." To tell the truth, he had not the least idea what the
owl meant.
</p><p>Naturally, Benny's words only made the owl angrier than ever. And he
became actually rude.
</p><p>"If I were you," he spluttered, "until I learned better manners I would
dig a hole somewhere, crawl inside it, and pull it in after me."
</p><p>Now, that was a new idea--for Benny Badger. And he liked it.
</p><p>"What fun that would be!" he exclaimed. "Then when I wanted to go out
I'd have to dig my way again!"
</p><p>The owl gave a queer cry. And looking quite discouraged, he flew off and
left Benny Badger sitting there in the grass.
