<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>"Stop! It looks so bright that there must be something going
on. Surely the yeomanry can never have come on here already?"</p>

<p>Tom laid his hand on the bridle, and they halted on the road
opposite the public-house, which lay a little back, with an open
space of ground before it. The sign-post, and a long water-trough
for the horses of guests to drink at, were pushed forward to the
side of road to intimate the whereabouts of the house, and the
hack which Harry led was already drinking eagerly.</p>

<p>"Stay here for a minute, and I'll go to the window, and see what's
up inside. It's very unlucky, but it will never do for us to go
in if there are any people there."</p>

<p>Tom stole softly up to the window out of which the light came.
A little scrap of a curtain was drawn across a portion of it,
but he could see easily into the room on either side of the curtain.
The first glance comforted him, for he saw at once that there
was only one person in the kitchen; but who and what he might
be was a puzzle. The only thing which was clear at a first glance
was, that he was making himself at home.</p>

<p>The room was a moderate-sized kitchen, with a sanded floor, and
a large fire-place; a high wooden screen, with a narrow seat in
front of it, ran along the side on which the door from the entrance-passage
opened. In the middle there was a long rough walnut table, on
which stood a large loaf, some cold bacon and cheese, and a yellow
jug; a few heavy rush-bottomed chairs and a settle composed the
rest of the furniture. On the wall were a few samplers, a warming
pan, and shelves with some common delf plates, and cups and saucers.
But though the furniture was meagre enough, the kitchen had a
look of wondrous comfort for a drenched mortal outside. Tom felt
this keenly, and, after a glance round, fixed his attention on
the happy occupant, with the view of ascertaining whether he would
be a safe person to intrude on under the circumstances. He was
seated on a low, three-cornered oak seat, with his back to the
window, steadying a furze fagot on the fire with the poker. The
fagot blazed and crackled, and roared up the chimney, sending
out the bright flickering light which had attracted them, and
forming a glorious top to the glowing clear fire of wood embers
beneath, into which was inserted a long, funnel-shaped tin, out
of which the figure helped himself to some warm compound, when
he had settled the fagot to his satisfaction. He was enveloped
as to his shoulders in a heavy, dirty-white coat, with huge cape
and high collar, which hid the back of his head, such as was then
in use by country carriers; but the garment was much too short
for him, and his bare arms came out a foot beyond the end of the
sleeves. The rest of his costume was even more eccentric, being
nothing more or less than a coarse flannel petticoat, and his
bare feet rested on the mat in front of the fire.</p>

<p>Tom felt a sudden doubt as to his sanity, which doubt was apparently
shared by the widow woman, who kept the house, and her maid-of-all-work,
one or other of whom might be seen constantly keeping an eye on
their guest from behind the end of the wooden screen. However,
it was no time to be over particular; they must rest before going
further, and, after all, it was only one man. So Tom thought,
and was just on the point of calling Harry to come on, when the
figure turned round towards the window, and the face of the lieutenant
disclosed itself between the high-peaked gills of the carrier's
coat. Tom burst out into a loud laugh, and called out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's all right, come along."</p>

<p>"I'll just look to the hosses, Master Tom."</p>

<p>"Very well, and then come into the kitchen;" saying which, he
hurried into the house, and after tumbling against the maid-of-all-work
in the passage, emerged from behind the screen.</p>

<p>"Well, here we are at last, old fellow," he said, slapping East
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, is it? I thought you were in the lock-up by this
time."</p>

<p>East's costume, as he sat looking up, with a hand on each knee,
was even more ridiculous on a close inspection, and Tom roared
with laughter again.</p>

<p>"I don't see the joke," said East without moving a muscle.</p>

<p>"You would, though, if you could see yourself. You wonderful
old Guy, where did you pick up that toggery?"</p>

<p>"The late lamented husband of the widow Higgs, our landlady,
was the owner of the coat. He also bequeathed to her several pairs
of breeches, which I have vainly endeavored to get into. The late
lamented Higgs was an abominably small man. He must have been
very much her worse half. So, in default of other clothing, the
widow has kindly obliged me by the loan of one of her own garments."</p>

<p>"Where are your own clothes?"</p>

<p>"There," said East, pointing to a clothes' horse, which Tom had
not hitherto remarked, which stood well into the chimney corner;
"and they are dry, too," he went on, feeling them; "at least the
flannel shirt and trousers are, so I'll get into them again."</p>

<p>"I say, ma'am," he called out, addressing the screen, "I'm going
to change my things. So you had better not look in just now. In
fact, we can call now, if we want anything."</p>

<p>At this strong hint the widow Higgs was heard bustling away behind
the screen, and after her departure East got into some of his
own clothes again, offering the cast-off garments of the Higgs
family to Tom, who, however, declined, contenting himself with
taking off his coat and waistcoat, and hanging them upon the horse.
He had been blown comparatively dry in the last half-hour of his
walk.</p>

<p>While East was making his toilet, Tom turned to the table, and
made an assault on the bread and bacon, and then poured himself
out a glass of beer and began to drink it, but was pulled up half
way, and put it down with a face all drawn up into puckers by
its sharpness.</p>

<p>"I thought you wouldn't appreciate the widow's tap," said East,
watching him with a grin. "Regular whistle-belly vengeance, and
no mistake! Here, I don't mind giving you some of my compound,
though you don't deserve it."</p>

<p>So Tom drew his chair to the fire, and smacked his lips over
the long-necked glass, which East handed to him.</p>

<p>"Ah! that's not bad tipple after such a ducking as we've had.
Dog's-nose, isn't it?"</p>

<p>East nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, old fellow, I will say you are the best hand I know at
making the most of your opportunities. I don't know of anyone
else who could have made such a good brew out of that stuff and
a drop of gin."</p>

<p>East was not to be mollified by any such compliment. "Have you
got many more such jobs as to-day's on hand? I should think they
must interfere with reading."</p>

<p>"No. But I call to-day's a real good job."</p>

<p>"Do you? I don't agree. Of course it's a matter of taste. I have
the honor of holding Her Majesty's commission; so I may be prejudiced,
perhaps."</p>

<p>"What difference does it make whose commission you hold? You
wouldn't hold any commission, I know, which would bind you to
be a tyrant and oppress the weak and the poor."</p>

<p>"Humbug about your oppressing! Who is the tyrant, I should like
to know, the farmer, or the mob that destroys his property? I
don't call Swing's mob the weak and the poor."</p>

<p>"That's all very well; but I should like to know how you'd feel
if you had no work and a starving family. You don't know what
people have to suffer. The only wonder is that all the country
isn't in a blaze; and it will be if things last as they are much
longer. It must be a bad time which makes such men as Harry Winburn
into rioters."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about Harry Winburn. But I know there's
a good deal to be said on the yeomanry side of the question."</p>

<p>"Well, now, East, just consider this-"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not in the humour for considering. I don't want to argue
with you."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's always the way. You won't hear what a fellow's got
to say, and then set him down for a mischievous fool, because
he won't give up beliefs founded on the evidence of his own eyes,
and ears, and reason."</p>

<p>"I don't quarrel with any of your beliefs. You've got 'em &mdash;I
haven't&mdash;that's just the difference between us. You've got some
sort of faith to fall back upon, in equality, and brotherhood,
and a lot of cursed nonsense of that kind. So, I daresay, you
could drop down into a navigator, or a shoeblack, or something
in that way, to-morrow, and think it pleasant. You might rather
enjoy a trip across the water at the expense of your country,
like your friend the convict here."</p>

<p>"Don't talk such rot, man. In the first place, he isn't a convict;
you know that well enough."</p>

<p>"He is just out of prison, at any rate. However, this sort of
thing isn't my line of country at all. So the next time you want
to do a bit of gaol delivery on your own hook, don't ask me to
help you."</p>

<p>"Well, if I had known all that was going to happen, I wouldn't
have asked you to come, old fellow. Come, give us another glass
of your dog's-nose, and no more of your sermon, which isn't edifying."</p>

<p>The lieutenant filled the long-necked glass which Tom held out,
with the creaming mixture, which he was nursing in the funnel-shaped
tin. But he was not prepared to waive his right to lecture, and
so continued, while Tom sipped his liquor with much relish, and
looked comically across at his old schoolfellow.</p>

<p>"Some fellows have a call to set the world right &mdash;I haven't.
My gracious sovereign pays me seven and sixpence a day; for which
sum I undertake to be shot at on certain occasions and by proper
persons, and I hope when the time comes I shall take it as well
as another. But that doesn't include turning out to be potted
at like a woodcock on your confounded Berkshire wilds by a turnip-headed
yeoman. It isn't to be done at the figure."</p>

<p>"What in the world do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean just what I say."</p>

<p>"That one of those unspeakable yeomanry has been shooting at
you?"</p>

<p>"Just so."</p>

<p>"No, you don't really mean it? Wh-e-e-w! Then that shot we heard
was fired at you. 'Pon my honor, I'm very sorry."</p>

<p>"Much good your sorrow would have done me if your precious countryman
had held straight."</p>

<p>"Well, what can I say more, East? If there's anything I can do
to show you that I really am very sorry and ashamed at having
brought you into such a scrape, only tell me what it is."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose your word would go for much at the Horse Guards,
or I'd ask you to give me a character for coolness under fire."</p>

<p>"Come, I see you're joking now, old fellow. Do tell us how it
happened."</p>

<p>"Well, when you turned off across the common, I pulled up for
half a minute, and then held on at a steady slow trot. If I had
pushed on ahead, my friend behind would have been just as likely
to turn after you as after me. Presently I heard Number One coming
tearing along behind; and as soon as he got from between the banks,
he saw me and came straight after me down the road. You were well
away to the left, so now I just clapped on a bit, to lead him
further away from the right scent, and on he came, whooping and
hallooing to me to pull up. I didn't see why I hadn't just as
good a right to ride along the road at my own pace as he; so the
more he shouted, the more I didn't stop. But the beggar had the
legs of me. He was mounted on something deuced like a thoroughbred,
and gained on me hand over hand. At last when I judged he must
be about twenty yards behind, I thought I might as well have a
look at him, so I just turned for a moment, when, by Jove, there
was my lord, lugging a pistol out of his right holster. He shouted
again to me to stop. I turned, ducked my head, and the next moment
he pulled trigger, and missed me."</p>

<p>"And what happened then," said Tom, eagerly drawing a long breath.</p>

<p>"Why, I flatter myself I showed considerable generalship. If
I had given him time to get at his other pistol, or his toasting
fork, it was all up. I dived into my pocket, where by good luck
there was some loose powder, and copper caps, and a snuff-box;
upset the snuff, grabbed a handful of the mixture, and pulled
hard at my horse. Next moment he was by my side, lifting his pistol
to knock me over. So I gave him the mixture right in the face,
and let him go by. Up went both his hands, and away went he and
his horse, somewhere over the common out of sight. I just turned
round, and walked quietly back. I didn't see the fun of accepting
any more attacks in the rear. Then up rides Number Two, a broad-faced
young farmer on a big gray horse, blowing like a grampus. He pulled
up short when we met, and stared, and I walked past him. You never
saw a fellow look more puzzled. I had regularly stale-mated him.
However, he took heart, and shouted, 'had I met the Captain?'
I said, 'A gentleman had ridden by on a bright bay.' 'That was
he; which way had he gone?' So I pointed generally over the common,
and Number Two departed; and then down came the storm, and I turned
again, and came on here."</p>

<p>"The Captain! It must have been Wurley, then, who fired at you."</p>

<p>"I don't know who it was. I only hope he won't be blinded."</p>

<p>"It's a strange business altogether," said Tom, looking into
the fire; "I scarcely know what to think of it. We should never
have pulled through but for you, that's certain."</p>

<p>"I know what to think of it well enough," said East. "But now
let's hear what happened to you. They didn't catch you, of course?"</p>

<p>"No, but it was touch and go. I thought it was all up at one
time, for Harry would turn right across their line. But he knew
what he was about; there was a bog between us, and they came on
right into it, and we left them floundering."</p>

<p>"The convict seems to have his head about him, then. Where is
he, by the way? I'm curious to have a look at him."</p>

<p>"Looking after the horses. I'll call him in. He ought have something
to drink."</p>

<p>Tom went to the door and called Harry, who came out from the
rough shed which served as a stable, in his shirt, with a wisp
of hay in his hand. He had stripped off coat, and waistcoat, and
braces, and had been warming himself by giving the horses a good
dressing.</p>

<p>"Why, Harry, you haven't had anything," said Tom; "come across
and have a glass of something hot."</p>

<p>Harry followed into the kitchen, and stood by the end of the
screen, looking rather uncomfortable, while Tom poured him out
a glass of the hot mixture, and the lieutenant looked him over
with keen eyes.</p>

<p>"There, take that off. How are the horses?"</p>

<p>"Pretty fresh, Master Tom; but they'd be the better of a bran
mash, or somethin' cumfable. I've spoke to the missus about it,
and 'tis ready to put on the fire."</p>

<p>"That's right then. Let them have it as quick as you can."</p>

<p>"Then I med fetch it and warm it up here, sir?" said Harry.</p>

<p>"To be sure; the sooner the better."</p>

<p>Harry took off his glass, making a shy sort of duck with his
head, accompanied by "your health, sir," to each of his entertainers,
and then disappeared into the back kitchen, returned with the
mash, which he put on the fire, and went off to the stable again.</p>

<p>"What do you think of him?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"I like to see a fellow let his braces down when he goes to work,"
said East.</p>

<p>"It's not every fellow who would be strapping away at those horses,
instead of making himself at home in the back kitchen."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," said East.</p>

<p>"Don't you like his looks now?"</p>

<p>"He's not a bad sort, your convict."</p>

<p>"I say, I wish you wouldn't call him names."</p>

<p>"Very good; your unfortunate friend, then. What are you going
to do with him?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I've been puzzling about all the way here.
What do you think?" And then they drew to the fire again, and
began to talk over Harry's prospects. In some ten minutes he returned
to the kitchen for the mash, and this time drew a complimentary
remark from the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Harry was passionately fond of animals, and especially of horses,
and they found it out quickly enough as they always do. The two
hacks were by this time almost fresh again, with dry coats, and
feet well washed and cleansed; and while working at them, Harry
had been thinking over all he had heard that evening, and what
with the work and what with his thoughts, found himself getting
more hopeful every minute. No one who had seen his face an hour
before on the heath would have believed it was the same man who
was now patting and fondling the two hacks as they disposed of
the mash he had prepared for them. He leant back against the manger,
rubbing the ears of Tom's hack&mdash;the one which had carried double
so well in their first flight&mdash;gently with his two hands, while
the delighted beast bent down its head, and pressed it against
him, and stretched its neck, expressing in all manner of silent
ways its equine astonishment and satisfaction. By the light of
the single dip, Harry's face grew shorter and shorter, until at
last, a quiet humorous look began to creep back into it.</p>

<p>As we have already taken the liberty of putting the thoughts
of his betters into words, we must now do so for him; and, if
he had expressed his thoughts in his own vernacular as he rubbed
the hack's ears in the stable, his speech would have been much
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"How cums it as I be all changed like, as tho' sum un had tuk
and rubbed all the downheartedness out o' me? Here I be, two days
out o' gaol, wi' nothin' in the world but the things I stands
in,&mdash;for in course I med just give up the bits o' things as is
left at Daddy Collins's&mdash;and they all draggled wi' the wet&mdash;and
I med be tuk in the mornin' and sent across the water; and yet
I feels sum how as peert as a yukkel. So fur as I can see, 'tis
jest nothin' but talkin' wi' our Master Tom. What a fine thing
'tis to be a schollard. And yet seemin'ly 'tis nothin' but talk
arter all's said and done. But 'tis allus the same; whenever I
gets talkin' wi' he, it all cums out as smooth as crame. Fust
time as ever I seen him since we wur bwys he talked just as a
do now; and then my poor mother died. Then he come in arter the
funeral, and talked me up agen, till I thought as I wur to hev
our cottage and all the land as I could do good by. But our cottage
wur tuk away, and my 'lotment besides. Then cum last summer, and
'twur just the same agen arter his talk, but I got dree months
auver that job. And now 'ere I be wi un agen, a-runnin' from the
constable; and like to be tuk up and transpworted, and 'tis just
the same; and I s'pose 'twill be just the same if ever I gets
back, and sees un, and talks wi' un, if I be gwine to be hung.
'Tis a wunnerful thing to be a schollard, to be able to make things
look all straight when they be ever so akkerd and unked."</p>

<p>And then Harry left off rubbing the horse's ears; and, pulling
the damp piece of paper, which Tom had given him, out of his breeches'
pocket, proceeded to flatten it out tenderly on the palm of his
hand, and read it by the light of the dip, when the landlady came
to inform him that the gentlefolk wanted him in the kitchen. So
he folded his treasure up again, and went off to the kitchen.
He found Tom standing with his back to the fire, while the lieutenant
was sitting at the table, writing on a scrap of paper, which the
landlady had produced after much hunting over of drawers. Tom
began, with some little hesitation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry, I've been talking matters over with my friend here,
and I've changed my mind. It won't do after all for you to stay
about at railway work, or anything of that sort. You see you wouldn't
be safe. They'd be sure to trace you, and you'd get into trouble
about this day's work. And then, after all, it's a very poor opening
for a young fellow like you. Now, why shouldn't you enlist into
Mr. East's regiment? You'll be in his company, and it's a splendid
profession. What do you say now?"</p>

<p>East looked up at poor Harry, who was quite taken aback at this
change in his prospects, and could only mutter, that he had never
turned his mind to "sodgerin."</p>

<p>"It's just the thing for you," Tom went on. "You can write and
keep accounts, and you'll get on famously. Ask Mr. East if you
won't. And don't you fear about matters at home. You'll see that'll
all come right. I'll pledge you my word it will, and I'll take
care that you shall hear everything that goes on there; and, depend
upon it, it's your best chance. You'll be back at Englebourn as
a sergeant in no time, and be able to snap your fingers at them
all. You'll come with us to Steventon station, and take the night
train to London, and then in the morning go to Whitehall, and
find Mr. East's sergeant. He'll give you a note to him, and they'll
send you on to Chatham, where the regiment is. You think it's
the best thing for him, don't you?" said Tom, turning to East.</p>

<p>"Yes; I think you'll do very well if you only keep steady. Here's
a note to the sergeant, and I shall be back at Chatham in a day
or two myself."</p>

<p>Harry took the note mechanically; he was quite unable yet to
make any resistance.</p>

<p>"And now get something to eat as quick as you can, for we ought
to be off. The horses are all right, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Master Tom," said Harry, with an appealing look.</p>

<p>"Where are your coat and waistcoat, Harry?"</p>

<p>"They be in the stable, sir."</p>

<p>"In the stable! Why, they're all wet, then, still?"</p>

<p>"Oh, 'tis no odds about that, Master Tom."</p>

<p>"No odds! Get them in directly, and put them to dry here."</p>

<p>So Harry Winburn went off to the stable to fetch his clothes.</p>

<p>"He's a fine fellow," said East, getting up and coming to the
fire; "I've taken quite a fancy to him, but he doesn't fancy enlisting."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! he has to leave his sweetheart. It's a sad business,
but it's the best thing for him, and you'll see he'll go."</p>

<p>Tom was right. Poor Harry came in and dried his clothes, and
got his supper; and while he was eating it, and all along the
road afterwards, till they reached the station at about eleven
o'clock, pleaded in his plain way with Tom against leaving his
own country side. And East listened silently, and liked him better
and better.</p>

<p>Tom argued with him gently, and turned the matter round on all
sides, putting the most hopeful face upon it; and, in the end,
talked first himself and then Harry into the belief that it was
the best thing that could have happened to him, and more likely
than any other course of action to bring everything right between
him and all the folk at Englebourn.</p>

<p>So they got into the train at Steventon in pretty good heart,
with his fare paid, and half-a-sovereign in his pocket, more and
more impressed in his mind with what a wonderful thing it was
to be "a schollard."</p>

<p>The two friends rode back to Oxford at a good pace. They had
both of them quite enough to think about, and were not in the
humour for talk, had place and time served, so that scarce a word
passed between them till they had left their horses at the livery
stables, and were walking through the silent streets, a few minutes
before midnight. Then East broke silence.</p>

<p>"I can't make out how you do it. I'd give half-a-year's pay to
get the way of it."</p>

<p>"The way of what? What an you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Why, your way of shutting your eyes, and going in blind."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a queer wish for a fighting man," said Tom, laughing.
"We always thought a rusher no good at school, and that the thing
to learn was, to go in with your own eyes open, and shut up other
people's."</p>

<p>"Ah but we hadn't cut our eye-teeth then. I look at these things
from a professional point of view. My business is to get fellows
to shut their eyes tight, and I begin to think you can't do it
as it should be done, without shutting your own first."</p>

<p>"I don't take."</p>

<p>"Why, look at the way you talked your convict &mdash;I beg your
pardon&mdash;your unfortunate friend&mdash;into enlisting tonight. You talked
as if you believed every word you were saying to him."</p>

<p>"So I did."</p>

<p>"Well, I should like to have you for a recruiting sergeant, if
you could only drop that radical bosh. If I had had to do it,
instead of enlisting, he would have gone straight off and hung
himself in the stable."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you didn't try your hand at it then."</p>

<p>"Look again at me. Do you think anyone but such a&mdash;well I don't
want to say anything uncivil&mdash;a headlong dog like you could have
got me into such a business as to-day's? Now I want to be able
to get other fellows to make just such fools of themselves as
I've made of myself to-day. How do you do it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, unless it is that I can't help always looking
at the best side of things myself, and so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Most things haven't got a best side."</p>

<p>"Well, at the pretty good side, then."</p>

<p>"Nor a pretty good one."</p>

<p>"If they haven't got a pretty good one, it don't matter how you
look at them, I should think."</p>

<p>"No, I don't believe it does&mdash;much. Still, I should like to be
able to make a fool of myself, too, when I want, with the view
of getting others to do ditto, of course."</p>

<p>"I wish I could help you, old fellow; but I don't see my way
to it."</p>

<p>"I shall talk to our regimental doctor about it, and get put
through a course of fool's-diet before we start for India."</p>

<p>"Flap-doodle, they call it, what fools are fed on. But it's odd
that you should have broken out in this place, when all the way
home I've been doing nothing but envying you your special talent."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Just the opposite one&mdash;the art of falling on your feet. I should
like to exchange with you."</p>

<p>"You'd make a precious bad bargain of it, then."</p>

<p>"There's twelve striking. I must knock in. Good night. You'll
be round to breakfast at nine."</p>

<p>"All right. I believe in your breakfasts, rather," said East,
as they shook hands at the gate of St. Ambrose, into which Tom
disappeared, while the lieutenant strolled back to the "Mitre."</p>
