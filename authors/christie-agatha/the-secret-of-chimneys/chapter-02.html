<p>"So that’s that," said Anthony, finishing off his glass and replacing
it on the table. "What boat were you going on?"</p>

<p>"<em>Granarth Castle.</em>"</p>

<p>"Passage booked in your name, I suppose, so I’d better travel
as James McGrath. We’ve outgrown the passport business, haven’t
we?"</p>

<p>"No odds either way. You and I are totally unlike, but we’d probably
have the same description on one of those blinking things. Height
6 feet, hair brown, eyes blue, nose, ordinary, chin ordinary——"</p>

<p>"Not so much of this ‘ordinary’ stunt. Let me tell you that Castle’s
selected me out of several applicants solely on account of my
pleasing appearance and nice manners."</p>

<p>Jimmy grinned.</p>

<p>"I noticed your manners this morning."</p>

<p>"The devil you did."</p>

<p>Anthony rose and paced up and down the room. His brow was slightly
wrinkled, and it was some minutes before he spoke.</p>

<p>"Jimmy," he said at last. "Stylptitch died in Paris. What’s the
point of sending a manuscript from Paris to London via Africa?"</p>

<p>Jimmy shook his head helplessly.</p>

<p>"I don’t know."</p>

<p>"Why not do it up in a nice little parcel and send it by post?"</p>

<p>"Sounds a damn sight more sensible, I agree."</p>

<p>"Of course," continued Anthony, "I know that Kings and Queens
and Government officials are prevented by etiquette from doing
anything in a simple, straightforward fashion. Hence King’s Messengers
and all that. In medieval days you gave a fellow a signet ring
as a sort of Open Sesame. ‘The King’s Ring! Pass, my Lord!’ And
usually it was the other fellow who had stolen it. I always wonder
why some bright lad never hit on the expedient of copying the
ring—making a dozen or so, and selling them at a hundred ducats
apiece. They seem to have had no initiative in the Middle Ages."</p>

<p>Jimmy yawned.</p>

<p>"My remarks on the Middle Ages don’t seem to amuse you. Let us
get back to Count Stylptitch. From France to England via Africa
seems a bit thick even for a diplomatic personage. If he merely
wanted to ensure that you should get a thousand pounds he could
have left it you in his will. Thank God neither you nor I are
too proud to accept a legacy! Stylptitch must have been balmy."</p>

<p>"You’d think so, wouldn’t you?"</p>

<p>Anthony frowned and continued his pacing.</p>

<p>"Have you read the thing at all?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Read what?"</p>

<p>"The manuscript."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, no. What do you think I want to read a thing of that
kind for?"</p>

<p>Anthony smiled.</p>

<p>"I just wondered, that’s all. You know a lot of trouble has been
caused by Memoirs. Indiscreet revelations, that sort of thing.
People who have been closed as an oyster all their lives seem
positively to relish causing trouble when they themselves shall
be comfortably dead. It gives them a kind of malicious glee. Jimmy,
what sort of a man was Count Stylptitch? You met him and talked
to him, and you’re a pretty good judge of raw human nature. Could
you imagine him being a vindictive old devil?"</p>

<p>Jimmy shook his head.</p>

<p>"It’s difficult to tell. You see, that first night he was distinctly
canned, and the next day he was just a high-toned old boy with
the most beautiful manners overwhelming me with compliments till
I didn’t know where to look."</p>

<p>"And he didn’t say anything interesting when he was drunk?"</p>

<p>Jimmy cast his mind back, wrinkling his brows as he did so.</p>

<p>"He said he knew where the Koh-i-noor was," he volunteered doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Anthony, "we all know that. They keep it in
the Tower, don’t they? Behind thick plate glass and iron bars,
with a lot of gentlemen in fancy dress standing round to see you
don’t pinch anything."</p>

<p>"That’s right," agreed Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Did Stylptitch say anything else of the same kind? That he knew
which city the Wallace Collection was in, for instance?"</p>

<p>Jimmy shook his head.</p>

<p>"H’m!" said Anthony.</p>

<p>He lit another cigarette, and once more began pacing up and down
the room.</p>

<p>"You never read the papers, I suppose, you heathen?" he threw
out presently.</p>

<p>"Not very often," said McGrath simply. "They’re not about anything
that interests me as a rule."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven I’m more civilized. There have been several mentions
of Herzoslovakia lately. Hints at a Royalist restoration."</p>

<p>"Nicholas IV didn’t leave a son," said Jimmy. "But I don’t suppose
for a minute that the Obolovitch dynasty is extinct. There are
probably shoals of young ’uns knocking about, cousins and second
cousins and third cousins once removed."</p>

<p>"So that there wouldn’t be any difficulty in finding a King?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least, I should say," replied Jimmy. "You know, I
don’t wonder at their getting tired of Republican institutions.
A full-blooded, virile people like that must find it awfully tame
to pot at Presidents after being used to Kings. And talking of
Kings, that reminds me of something else old Stylptitch let out
that night. He said he knew the gang that was after him. They
were King Victor’s people, he said."</p>

<p>"What?" Anthony wheeled round suddenly.</p>

<p>A slow grin widened on McGrath’s face.</p>

<p>"Just a mite excited, aren’t you, Gentleman Joe?" he drawled.</p>

<p>"Don’t be an ass, Jimmy. You’ve just said something rather important."</p>

<p>He went over to the window and stood there looking out.</p>

<p>"Who is this King Victor, anyway?" demanded Jimmy. "Another Balkan
Monarch?"</p>

<p>"No," said Anthony slowly. "He isn’t that kind of a King."</p>

<p>"What is he, then?"</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then Anthony spoke.</p>

<p>"He’s a crook, Jimmy. The most notorious jewel thief in the world.
A fantastic, daring fellow, not to be daunted by anything. King
Victor was the nickname he was known by in Paris. Paris was the
headquarters of his gang. They caught him there and put him away
for seven years on a minor charge. They couldn’t prove the more
important things against him. He’ll be out soon—or he may be out
already."</p>

<p>"Do you think Count Stylptitch had anything to do with putting
him away? Was that why the gang went for him? Out of revenge?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know," said Anthony. "It doesn’t seem likely on the
face of it. King Victor never stole the Crown jewels of Herzoslovakia
as far as I’ve heard. But the whole thing seems rather suggestive,
doesn’t it? The death of Stylptitch, the Memoirs, and the rumours
in the papers—all vague but interesting. And there’s a further
rumour to the effect that they’ve found oil in Herzoslovakia.
I’ve a feeling in my bones, James, that people are getting ready
to be interested in that unimportant little country."</p>

<p>"What sort of people?"</p>

<p>"Financiers in City offices."</p>

<p>"What are you driving at with all this?"</p>

<p>"Trying to make an easy job difficult, that’s all."</p>

<p>"You can’t pretend there’s going to be any difficulty in handing
over a simple manuscript at a publisher’s office?"</p>

<p>"No," said Anthony regretfully. "I don’t suppose there’ll be
anything difficult about that. But shall I tell you, James, where
I propose to go with my £250?"</p>

<p>"South America?"</p>

<p>"No, my lad, Herzoslovakia. I shall stand in with the Republic,
I think. Very probably I shall end up as President."</p>

<p>"Why not announce yourself as the principal Obolovitch and be
a King whilst you’re about it?"</p>

<p>"No, Jimmy. Kings are for life. Presidents only take on the job
for four years or so. It would quite amuse me to govern a kingdom
like Herzoslovakia for four years."</p>

<p>"The average for Kings is even less, I should say," interpolated
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"It will probably be a serious temptation to me to embezzle your
share of the thousand pounds. You won’t want it, you know, when
you get back weighed down with nuggets. I’ll invest it for you
in Herzoslovakian oil shares. You know, James, the more I think
of it, the more pleased I am with this idea of yours. I should
never have thought of Herzoslovakia if you hadn’t mentioned it.
I shall spend one day in London, collecting the booty, and then
away by the Balkan express!"</p>

<p>"You won’t get off quite as fast as that. I didn’t mention it
before, but I’ve got another little commission for you."</p>

<p>Anthony sank into a chair and eyed him severely.</p>

<p>"I knew all along that you were keeping something dark. This
is where the catch comes in."</p>

<p>"Not a bit. It’s just something that’s got to be done to help
a lady."</p>

<p>"Once and for all, James, I refuse to be mixed up in your beastly
love affairs."</p>

<p>"It’s not a love affair. I’ve never seen the woman. I’ll tell
you the whole story."</p>

<p>"If I’ve got to listen to more of your long, rambling stories,
I shall have to have another drink."</p>

<p>His host complied hospitably with this demand, then began the
tale.</p>

<p>"It was when I was up in Uganda. There was a Dago there whose
life I had saved——"</p>

<p>"If I were you, Jimmy, I should write a short book entitled ‘Lives
I have Saved.’ This is the second I’ve heard of this evening."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I didn’t really do anything this time. Just pulled
the Dago out of the river. Like all Dagos, he couldn’t swim."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, has this story anything to do with the other
business?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever, though, oddly enough, now I remember it, the
man was a Herzoslovakian. We always called him Dutch Pedro though."</p>

<p>Anthony nodded indifferently.</p>

<p>"Any name’s good enough for a Dago," he remarked. "Get on with
the good work, James."</p>

<p>"Well, the fellow was sort of grateful about it. Hung around
like a dog. About six months later he died of fever. I was with
him. Last thing, just as he was pegging out, he beckoned me and
whispered some excited jargon about a secret—a gold mine, I thought
he said. Shoved an oilskin packet into my hand which he’d always
worn next his skin. Well, I didn’t think much of it at the time.
It wasn’t until a week afterwards that I opened the packet. Then
I was curious, I must confess. I shouldn’t have thought that Dutch
Pedro would have had the sense to know a gold mine when he saw
it—but there’s no accounting for luck——"</p>

<p>"And at the mere thought of gold, your heart beat pitter-pat
as always," interrupted Anthony.</p>

<p>"I was never so disgusted in my life. Gold mine, indeed! I daresay
it may have been a gold mine to him, the dirty dog. Do you know
what it was? A woman’s letters—yes, a woman’s letters, and an
Englishwoman at that. The skunk had been blackmailing her—and
he had the impudence to pass on his dirty bag of tricks to me."</p>

<p>"I like to see your righteous heat, James, but let me point out
to you that Dagos will be Dagos. He meant well. You had saved
his life, he bequeathed to you a profitable source of raising
money—your high-minded British ideals did not enter his horizon."</p>

<p>"Well, what the hell was I to do with the things? Burn ’em, that’s
what I thought at first. And then it occurred to me that there
would be that poor dame, not knowing they’d be destroyed, and
always living in a quake and a dread lest that Dago should turn
up again one day."</p>

<p>"You’ve more imagination than I gave you credit for, Jimmy,"
observed Anthony, lighting a cigarette. "I admit that the case
presented more difficulties than were at first apparent. What
about just sending them to her by post?"</p>

<p>"Like all women, she’d put no date and no address on most of
the letters. There was a kind of address on one—just one word.
Chimneys."</p>

<p>Anthony paused in the act of blowing out his match, and he dropped
it with a quick jerk of the wrist as it burned his finger.</p>

<p>"Chimneys?" he said. "That’s rather extraordinary."</p>

<p>"Why, do you know it?"</p>

<p>"It’s one of the stately homes of England, my dear James. A place
where Kings and Queens go for weekends, and diplomatists forgather
and diplome."</p>

<p>"That’s one of the reasons why I’m so glad that you’re going
to England instead of me. You know all these things," said Jimmy
simply. "A josser like myself from the backwoods of Canada would
be making all sorts of bloomers. But some one like you who’s been
to Eton and Harrow——"</p>

<p>"Only one of them," said Anthony modestly.</p>

<p>"Will be able to carry it through. Why didn’t I send them to
her, you say? Well, it seemed to me dangerous. From what I could
make out, she seemed to have a jealous husband. Suppose he opened
the letter by mistake. Where would the poor dame be then? Or she
might be dead—the letters looked as though they’d been written
some time. As I figured it out, the only thing was for some one
to take them to England and put them into her own hands."</p>

<p>Anthony threw away his cigarette, and coming across to his friend
clapped him affectionately on the back.</p>

<p>"You’re a real knight-errant, Jimmy," he said. "And the backwoods
of Canada should be proud of you. I shan’t do the job half as
prettily as you would."</p>

<p>"You’ll take it on then?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>McGrath rose, and going across to a drawer took out a bundle
of letters and threw them on the table.</p>

<p>"Here you are. You’d better have a look at them."</p>

<p>"Is it necessary? On the whole, I’d rather not."</p>

<p>"Well, from what you say about this Chimneys place, she may have
been staying there only. We’d better look through the letters
and see if there’s any clue as to where she really hangs out."</p>

<p>"I suppose you’re right."</p>

<p>They went through the letters carefully, but without finding
what they had hoped to find. Anthony gathered them up again thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Poor little devil," he remarked. "She was scared stiff."</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded.</p>

<p>"Do you think you’ll be able to find her all right?" he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>"I won’t leave England till I have. You’re very concerned about
this unknown lady, James?"</p>

<p>Jimmy ran his finger thoughtfully over the signature.</p>

<p>"It’s a pretty name," he said apologetically. "<em>Virginia Revel.</em>"</p>
