As I look back on those days in which we built up the great
Tono-Bungay property out of human hope and credit for bottles and
rent and printing, I see my life as it were arranged in two
parallel columns of unequal width, a wider, more diffused,
eventful and various one which continually broadens out, the
business side of my life, and a narrow, darker and darkling one
shot ever and again with a gleam of happiness, my home-life with
Marion.  For, of course, I married Marion.
<P>
I didn't, as a matter of fact, marry her until a year after
Tono-Bungay was thoroughly afloat, and then only after conflicts
and discussions of a quite strenuous sort.  By that time I was
twenty-four.  It seems the next thing to childhood now.  We were
both in certain directions unusually ignorant and simple; we
were temperamentally antagonistic, and we hadn't--I don't think
we were capable of--an idea in common.  She was young and
extraordinarily conventional--she seemed never to have an idea of
her own but always the idea of her class--and I was young and
sceptical, enterprising and passionate; the two links that held
us together were the intense appeal her physical beauty had for
me, and her appreciation of her importance in my thoughts. 
There can be no doubt of my passion for her.  In her I had
discovered woman desired.  The nights I have lain awake on
account of her, writhing, biting my wrists in a fever of longing!
...
<P>
I have told how I got myself a silk hat and black coat to please
her on Sunday--to the derision of some of my fellow-students who
charged to meet me, and how we became engaged.  But that was only
the beginning of our difference.  To her that meant the beginning
of a not unpleasant little secrecy, an occasional use of verbal
endearments, perhaps even kisses.  It was something to go on
indefinitely, interfering in no way with her gossiping spells of
work at Smithie's.  To me it was a pledge to come together into
the utmost intimacy of soul and body so soon as we could contrive
it....
<P>
I don't know if it will strike the reader that I am setting out
to discuss the queer, unwise love relationship and my bungle of a
marriage with excessive solemnity.  But to me it seems to reach
out to vastly wider issues than our little personal affair.  I've
thought over my life.  In these last few years I've tried to get
at least a little wisdom out of it.  And in particular I've
thought over this part of my life.  I'm enormously impressed  by
the ignorant, unguided way in which we two entangled ourselves
with each other.  It seems to me the queerest thing in all this
network of misunderstandings and misstatements and faulty and
ramshackle conventions which makes up our social order as the
individual  meets it, that we should have come together so
accidentally and so blindly.  Because we were no more than
samples of the common fate.  Love is not only the cardinal fact
in the individual life, but the most important concern of the
community; after all, the way in which the young people of this
generation pair off determines the fate of the nation; all the
other affairs of the State are subsidiary to that.  And we leave
it to flushed and blundering youth to stumble on its own
significance, with nothing to guide in but shocked looks and
sentimental twaddle and base whisperings and cant-smeared
examples.
<P>
I have tried to indicate something of my own sexual development
in the preceding chapter.  Nobody was ever frank and decent with
me in this relation; nobody, no book, ever came and said to me
thus and thus is the world made, and so and so is necessary. 
Everything came obscurely, indefinitely, perplexingly; and all I
knew of law or convention in the matter had the form of
threatenings and prohibitions.  Except through the furtive,
shameful talk of my coevals at Goudhurst and Wimblehurst, I was
not even warned against quite horrible dangers. My ideas were
made partly of instinct, partly of a romantic imagination, partly
woven out of a medley of scraps of suggestion that came to me
haphazard.  I had read widely and confusedly "Vathek," Shelley,
Tom Paine, Plutarch, Carlyle, Haeckel, William Morris, the Bible,
the Freethinker, the Clarion, "The Woman Who Did,"--I
mention the ingredients that come first to mind.  All sorts of
ideas were jumbled up in me and never a lucid explanation.  But
it was evident to me that the world regarded Shelley, for
example, as a very heroic as well as beautiful person; and that
to defy convention and succumb magnificently to passion was the
proper thing to do to gain the respect and affection of all
decent people.
<P>
And the make-up of Marion's mind in the matter was an equally
irrational affair.  Her training had been one, not simply of
silences, but suppressions.  An enormous force of suggestion had
so shaped her that the intense natural fastidiousness of girlhood
had developed into an absolute perversion of instinct.  For all
that is cardinal in this essential business of life she had one
inseparable epithet--"horrid."  Without any such training she
would have been a shy lover, but now she was an impossible one. 
For the rest she had derived, I suppose, partly from the sort of
fiction she got from the Public Library, and partly from the
workroom talk at Smithie's.  So far as the former origin went,
she had an idea of love as a state of worship and service on the
part of the man and of condescension on the part of the woman. 
There was nothing "horrid" about it in any fiction she had read. 
The man gave presents, did services, sought to be in every way
delightful.  The woman "went out" with him, smiled at him, was
kissed by him in decorous secrecy, and if he chanced to offend,
denied her countenance and presence.  Usually she did something
"for his good" to him, made him go to church, made him give up
smoking or gambling, smartened him up.  Quite at the end of the
story came a marriage, and after that the interest ceased.
<P>
That was the tenor of Marion's fiction; but I think the
work-table conversation at Smithie's did something to modify
that.  At Smithie's it was recognised, I think, that a "fellow"
was a possession to be desired; that it was better to be engaged
to a fellow than not; that fellows had to be kept--they might be
mislaid, they might even be stolen.  There was a case of stealing
at Smithie's, and many tears.
<P>
Smithie I met before we were married, and afterwards she became a
frequent visitor to our house at Ealing. She was a thin,
bright-eyed, hawk-nosed girl of thirtyodd, with prominent
teeth, a high-pitched, eager voice and a disposition to be
urgently smart in her dress.  Her hats were startling and
various, but invariably disconcerting,  and she talked in a
rapid, nervous flow that was hilarious rather than witty, and
broken by little screams of "Oh, my dear!" and "you never did!"
She was the first woman I ever met who used scent.  Poor old
Smithie!  What a harmless, kindly soul she really was, and how
heartily I detested her!  Out of the profits on the Persian robes
she supported a sister's family of three children, she "helped" a
worthless brother, and overflowed in help even to her workgirls,
but that didn't weigh with me in those youthfully-narrow times. 
It was one of the intense minor irritations of my married life
that Smithie's whirlwind chatter seemed to me to have far more
influence with Marion than anything I had to say.  Before all
things I coveted her grip upon Marion's inaccessible mind.
<P>
In the workroom at Smithie's, I gathered, they always spoke of me
demurely as "A Certain Person."  I was rumoured to be dreadfully
"clever," and there were doubts--not altogether without
justification--of the sweetness of my temper.
<P>
II
<P>
Well, these general explanations will enable the reader to
understand the distressful times we two had together when
presently I began to feel on a footing with Marion and to fumble
conversationally for the mind and the wonderful passion I felt,
obstinately and stupidity, must be in her.  I think she thought
me the maddest of sane men; "clever," in fact, which at Smithie's
was, I suppose, the next thing to insanity, a word intimating
incomprehensible and incalculable motives.... She could be
shocked at anything, she misunderstood everything, and her weapon
was a sulky silence that knitted her brows, spoilt her mouth and
robbed her face of beauty.  "Well, if we can't agree, I don't see
why you should go on talking," she used to say.  That would
always enrage me beyond measure.  Or, "I'm afraid I'm not clever
enough to understand that."
<P>
Silly little people!  I see it all now, but then I was no older
than she and I couldn't see anything but that Marion, for some
inexplicable reason, wouldn't come alive.
<P>
We would contrive semi-surreptitious walks on Sunday, and part
speechless with the anger of indefinable offences.  Poor Marion!
The things I tried to put before her, my fermenting ideas about
theology, about Socialism, about aesthetics--the very words
appalled her, gave her the faint chill of approaching
impropriety, the terror of a very present intellectual
impossibility.  Then by an enormous effort I would suppress
myself for a time and continue a talk that made her happy, about
Smithie's brother, about the new girl who had come to the
workroom, about the house we would presently live in.  But
there we differed a little.  I wanted to be accessible to St. 
Paul's or Cannon Street Station, and she had set her mind quite
resolutely upon Eating.... It wasn't by any means quarreling all
the time, you understand.  She liked me to play the lover
"nicely"; she liked the effect of going about--we had lunches, we
went to Earl's Court, to Kew, to theatres and concerts, but not
often to concerts, because, though Marion "liked" music, she
didn't like "too much of it," to picture shows--and there was a
nonsensical sort of babytalk I picked up--I forget where
now--that became a mighty peacemaker.
<P>
Her worst offence for me was an occasional excursion into the
Smithie style of dressing, debased West Kensington. For she had
no sense at all of her own beauty. She had no comprehension
whatever of beauty of the body, and she could slash her beautiful
lines to rags with hat-brims and trimmings.  Thank Heaven! a
natural refinement,  a natural timidity, and her extremely
slender purse kept her from the real Smithie efflorescence! 
Poor, simple, beautiful, kindly limited Marion!  Now that I am
forty-five, I can look back at her with all my old admiration
and none of my old bitterness with a new affection and not a
scrap of passion, and take her part against the equally stupid,
drivingly-energetic, sensuous, intellectual sprawl I used to be. 
I was a young beast for her to have married--a hound beast.  With
her it was my business to understand and control--and I exacted 
fellowship, passion....
<P>
We became engaged, as I have told; we broke it off and joined
again.  We went through a succession of such phases.  We had no
sort of idea what was wrong with us.  Presently we were formally
engaged.  I had a wonderful interview with her father, in which
he was stupendously grave and H--less, wanted to know about my
origins and was tolerant (exasperatingly tolerant) because  my
mother was a servant, and afterwards her mother took to kissing
me, and I bought a ring.  But the speechless aunt, I gathered,
didn't approve--having doubts of my religiosity.  Whenever we
were estranged we could keep apart for days; and to begin with,
every such separation was a relief.  And then I would want her; a
restless longing would come upon me.  I would think of the flow
of her arms, of the soft, gracious bend of her body.  I would lie
awake or dream of a transfigured Marion of light and fire.  It
was indeed Dame Nature driving me on to womankind in her stupid,
inexorable way; but I thought it was the need of Marion that
troubled me.  So I always went back to Marion at last and made it
up and more or less conceded or ignored whatever thing had parted
us, and more and more I urged her to marry me....
<P>
In the long run that became a fixed idea.  It entangled my will
and my pride; I told myself I was not going to be beaten.  I
hardened to the business.  I think, as a matter of fact, my real
passion for Marion had waned enormously long before we were
married, that she had lived it down by sheer irresponsiveness.
When I felt sure of my three hundred a year she stipulated for
delay, twelve months' delay, "to see how things would turn out." 
There were times when she seemed simply an antagonist holding out
irritatingly against something I had to settle.  Moreover, I
began to be greatly distracted by the interest and excitement of
Tono-Bungay's success, by the change and movement in things, the
going to and fro.  I would forget her for days together, and then
desire her with an irritating intensity at last, one Saturday
afternoon, after a brooding morning, I determined almost savagely
that these delays must end.
<P>
I went off to the little home at Walham Green, and made Marion
come with me to Putney Common.  Marion wasn't at home when I got
there and I had to fret for a time and talk to her father, who
was just back from his office, he explained, and enjoying himself
in his own way in the greenhouse.
<P>
"I'm going to ask your daughter to marry me!" I said.  "I think
we've been waiting long enough."  
<P>
"I don't approve of long engagements either," said her father. 
"But Marion will have her own way about it, anyhow.  Seen this
new powdered fertiliser?" 
<P>
I went in to talk to Mrs. Ramboat.  "She'll want time to get her
things," said Mrs. Ramboat....
<P>
I and Marion sat down together on a little seat under some trees
at the top of Putney Hill, and I came to my point abruptly.
<P>
"Look here, Marion," I said, "are you going to marry me or are
you not?" 
<P>
She smiled at me.  "Well," she said, "we're engaged--aren't we?"
<P>
"That can't go on for ever.  Will you marry me next week?" 
<P>
She looked me in the face.  "We can't," she said.
<P>
"You promised to marry me when I had three hundred a year."
<P>
She was silent for a space.  "Can't we go on for a time as we
are?  We COULD marry on three hundred a year.  But it means a
very little house.  There's Smithie's brother.  They manage on
two hundred and fifty, but that's very little.  She says they
have a semi-detached house almost on the road, and hardly a bit
of garden.  And the wall to next-door is so thin they hear
everything.  When her baby cries--they rap.  And people stand
against the railings and talk.... Can't we wait?  You're doing so
well."  
<P>
An extraordinary bitterness possessed me at this invasion of the
stupendous beautiful business of love by sordid necessity.  I
answered her with immense restraint.
<P>
"If," I said, "we could have a double-fronted, detached
house--at Ealing, say--with a square patch of lawn in front and a
garden behind--and--and a tiled bathroom"
<P>
"That would be sixty pounds a year at least."  
<P>
"Which means five hundred a year.... Yes, well, you see, I told
my uncle I wanted that, and I've got it."  
<P>
"Got what?" 
<P>
"Five hundred pounds a year."  
<P>
"Five hundred pounds!" 
<P>
I burst into laughter that had more than a taste of bitterness.
<P>
"Yes," I said, "really! and NOW what do you think?" 
<P>
"Yes," she said, a little flushed; "but be sensible!  Do you
really mean you've got a Rise, all at once, of two hundred a
year?" 
<P>
"To marry on--yes."  
<P>
She scrutinised me a moment.  "You've done this as a surprise!"
she said, and laughed at my laughter.  She had become radiant,
and that made me radiant, too.
<P>
"Yes," I said, "yes," and laughed no longer bitterly.
<P>
She clasped her hands and looked me in the eyes.
<P>
She was so pleased that I forgot absolutely my disgust of a
moment before.  I forgot that she had raised her price two
hundred pounds a year and that I had bought her at that.
<P>
"Come!" I said, standing up; "let's go towards the sunset, dear,
and talk about it all.  Do you know--this is a most beautiful
world, an amazingly beautiful world, and when the sunset falls
upon you it makes you into shining gold.  No, not gold--into
golden glass.... Into something better that either glass or
gold."...
<P>
And for all that evening I wooed her and kept her glad.  She made
me repeat my assurances over again and still doubted a little.
<P>
We furnished that double-fronted house from attic--it ran to an
attic--to cellar, and created a garden.
<P>
"Do you know Pampas Grass?" said Marion. "I love Pampas Grass...
if there is room."  
<P>
"You shall have Pampas Grass," I declared.  And there were
moments as we went in imagination about that house together, when
my whole being cried out to take her in my arms--now.  But I
refrained.  On that aspect of life I touched very lightly in that
talk, very lightly because I had had my lessons.  She promised to
marry me within two months' time.  Shyly, reluctantly, she named
a day, and next afternoon, in heat and wrath, we "broke it off"
again for the last time.  We split upon procedure.  I refused
flatly to have a normal wedding with wedding cake, in  white
favours, carriages and the rest of it.  It dawned upon me
suddenly in conversation with her and her mother, that this was
implied.  I blurted out my objection forthwith, and this time it
wasn't any ordinary difference of opinion; it was a "row."  I
don't remember a quarter of the things we flung out in that
dispute.  I remember her mother reiterating in tones of gentle
remonstrance: "But, George dear, you must have a cake--to send
home."  I think we all reiterated things.  I seem to remember a
refrain of my own: "A marriage is too sacred a thing, too private
a thing, for this display.  Her father came in and stood behind
me against the wall, and her aunt appeared beside the sideboard
and stood with arms, looking from speaker to speaker, a sternly
gratified prophetess.  It didn't occur to me  then!  How painful
it was to Marion for these people to witness my rebellion.
<P>
"But, George," said her father, "what sort of marriage do you
want?  You don't want to go to one of those there registry
offices?" 
<P>
"That's exactly what I'd like to do.  Marriage is too private a
thing--"
<P>
"I shouldn't feel married," said Mrs. Ramboat.
<P>
"Look here, Marion," I said; "we are going to be married at a
registry office.  I don't believe in all these fripperies and
superstitions, and I won't submit to them.  I've agreed to all
sorts of things to please you."  
<P>
"What's he agreed to?" said her father--unheeded.
<P>
"I can't marry at a registry office," said Marion, sallow-white.
<P>
"Very well," I said.  "I'll marry nowhere else."  
<P>
"I can't marry at a registry office."  
<P>
"Very well," I said, standing up, white and tense and it amazed
me, but I was also exultant; "then we won't marry at all."  
<P>
She leant forward over the table, staring blankly.  But presently
her half-averted face began to haunt me as she had sat at the
table, and her arm and the long droop of her shoulder.
<P>
III
<P>
The next day I did an unexampled thing.  I sent a telegram to my
uncle, "Bad temper not coming to business," and set off for
Highgate and Ewart.  He was actually at work--on a bust of
Millie, and seemed very glad for any interruption.
<P>
"Ewart, you old Fool," I said, "knock off and come for a day's
gossip.  I'm rotten.  There's a sympathetic sort of lunacy about
you.  Let's go to Staines and paddle up to Windsor."  
<P>
"Girl?" said Ewart, putting down a chisel.
<P>
"Yes."  
<P>
That was all I told him of my affair.
<P>
"I've got no money," he remarked, to clear up ambiguity in my
invitation.
<P>
We got a jar of shandy-gaff, some food, and, on Ewart's
suggestion, two Japanese sunshades in Staines; we demanded extra
cushions at the boathouse and we spent an enormously soothing day
in discourse and meditation, our boat moored in a shady place
this side of Windsor.  I seem to remember Ewart with a cushion
forward, only his heels and sunshade and some black ends of hair
showing, a voice and no more, against the shining,
smoothly-streaming mirror of the trees and bushes.
<P>
"It's not worth it," was the burthen of the voice. "You'd better
get yourself a Millie, Ponderevo, and then you wouldn't feel so
upset."
<P>
"No," I said decidedly, "that's not my way."
<P>
A thread of smoke ascended from Ewart for a while, like smoke
from an altar.
<P>
"Everything's a muddle, and you think it isn't.  Nobody  knows
where we are--because, as a matter of fact we aren't anywhere. 
Are women property--or are they fellow-creatures?  Or a sort of
proprietary goddesses?  They're so obviously fellow-creatures. 
You believe in the goddess?" 
<P>
"No," I said, "that's not my idea."  
<P>
"What is your idea?" 
<P>
"Well"
<P>
"H'm," said Ewart, in my pause.
<P>
"My idea," I said, "is to meet one person who will belong to
me--to whom I shall belong--body and soul. No half-gods!  Wait
till she comes.  If she comes at all.... We must come to each
other young and pure."  
<P>
"There's no such thing as a pure person or an impure person.... 
Mixed to begin with."  
<P>
This was so manifestly true that it silenced me altogether.
<P>
"And if you belong to her and she to you, Ponderevo--which end's
the head?" 
<P>
I made no answer except an impatient "oh!" 
<P>
For a time we smoked in silence....
<P>
"Did I tell you, Ponderevo, of a wonderful discovery I've made?"
Ewart began presently.
<P>
"No," I said, "what is it?" 
<P>
"There's no Mrs. Grundy."  
<P>
"No?" 
<P>
"No!  Practically not.  I've just thought all that business out. 
She's merely an instrument, Ponderevo.  She's borne the blame. 
Grundy's a man.  Grundy unmasked.  Rather lean and out of sorts. 
Early middle age.  With bunchy black whiskers and a worried eye.
Been good so far, and it's fretting him!  Moods!  There's Grundy
in a state of sexual panic, for example,--'For God's sake cover
it up!  They get together--they get together!  It's too exciting!
The most dreadful things are happening!'  Rushing about--long
arms going like a windmill.  'They must be kept apart!'  Starts
out for an absolute obliteration of everything absolute
separations.  One side of the road for men, and the other for
women, and a hoarding--without posters between them.  Every boy
and girl to be sewed up in a sack and sealed, just the head and
hands and feet out until twenty-one.  Music abolished, calico
garments for the lower animals!  Sparrows to be
suppressed--ab-so-lutely."  
<P>
I laughed abruptly.
<P>
"Well, that's Mr. Grundy in one mood--and it puts Mrs.
Grundy--She's a much-maligned person, Ponderevo--a rake at
heart--and it puts her in a most painful state of fluster--most
painful!  She's an amenable creature.  When Grundy tells her
things are shocking, she's shocked--pink and breathless.  She
goes about trying to conceal her profound sense of guilt behind a
haughty expression....
<P>
"Grundy, meanwhile, is in a state of complete whirlabout.  Long
lean knuckly hands pointing and gesticulating!  'They're still
thinking of things--thinking of things! It's dreadful.  They get
it out of books.  I can't imagine where they get it!  I must
watch!  There're people over there whispering!  Nobody ought to
whisper!--There's something suggestive in the mere act!  Then,
pictures!  In the museum--things too dreadful for words.   Why
can't we have pure art--with the anatomy all wrong and pure and
nice--and pure fiction pure poetry, instead of all this stuff
with allusions--allusions?... Excuse me!  There's something up
behind that locked door!  The keyhole!  In the interests of
public morality--yes, Sir, as a pure good man--I insist--I'LL
look--it won't hurt me--I insist on looking my  duty--M'm'm--the
keyhole!'"
<P>
He kicked his legs about extravagantly, and I laughed again.
<P>
"That's Grundy in one mood, Ponderevo.  It isn't Mrs. Grundy. 
That's one of the lies we tell about women.  They're too simple. 
Simple!  Woman ARE simple!  They take on just what men tell 'em."
<P>
Ewart meditated for a space.  "Just exactly as it's put to them,"
he said, and resumed the moods of Mr. Grundy.                  
<P>
"Then you get old Grundy in another mood.  Ever caught him
nosing, Ponderevo?  Mad with the idea of mysterious, unknown,
wicked, delicious things.  Things that aren't respectable.  Wow!
Things he mustn't do!... Any one who knows about these things,
knows there's just as much mystery and deliciousness about
Grundy's forbidden things as there is about eating ham.  Jolly
nice if it's a bright morning and you're well and hungry and
having breakfast in the open air.  Jolly unattractive if you're
off colour.  But Grundy's covered it all up and hidden it and put
mucky shades and covers over it until he's forgotten it.  Begins
to fester round it in his mind.  Has dreadful struggles--with
himself about impure thoughts.... Then you set Grundy with hot
ears,--curious in undertones.  Grundy on the loose, Grundy in a
hoarse whisper and with furtive eyes and convulsive
movements--making things indecent.  Evolving--in dense
vapours--indecency!
<P>
"Grundy sins.  Oh, yes, he's a hypocrite.  Sneaks round a corner
and sins ugly.  It's Grundy and his dark corners that make vice,
vice! We artists--we have no vices.
<P>
"And then he's frantic with repentance.  And wants to be cruel to
fallen women and decent harmless sculptors  of the simple
nude--like me--and so back to his panic again."  
<P>
"Mrs. Grundy, I suppose, doesn't know he sins," I remarked.
<P>
"No? I'm not so sure.... But, bless her heart she's a woman.... 
She's a woman.  Then again you get Grundy with a large greasy
smile--like an accident to a butter tub--all over his face, being
Liberal Minded--Grundy in his Anti-Puritan moments, 'trying not
to see Harm in it'--Grundy the friend of innocent pleasure.  He
makes you sick with the Harm he's trying not to see in it...
<P>
"And that's why everything's wrong, Ponderevo.  Grundy, damn him!
stands in the light, and we young people can't see.  His moods
affect us.  We catch his gusts of panic, his disease of nosing,
his greasiness.  We don't know what we may think, what we may
say, he does his silly utmost to prevent our reading and seeing
the one thing, the one sort of discussion we find--quite
naturally and properly--supremely interesting. So we don't
adolescence; we blunder up to sex.  Dare--dare to look--and he
may dirt you for ever! The girls are terror-stricken to silence
by his significant whiskers, by the bleary something in his
eyes."  
<P>
Suddenly Ewart, with an almost Jack-in-the-box effect, sat up.
<P>
"He's about us everywhere, Ponderevo," he said, very solemnly. 
"Sometimes--sometimes I think he is--in our blood.  In MINE."  
<P>
He regarded me for my opinion very earnestly, with his pipe in
the corner of his mouth.
<P>
"You're the remotest cousin he ever had," I said.
<P>
I reflected.  "Look here, Ewart," I asked, "how would you have
things different?"
<P>
He wrinkled up his queer face, regarded the wait and made his
pipe gurgle for a space, thinking deeply.
<P>
"There are complications, I admit.  We've grown up under the
terror of Grundy and that innocent but docile
and--yes--formidable lady, his wife.  I don't know how far the
complications aren't a disease, a sort of bleaching under the
Grundy shadow.... It is possible there are things I have still
to learn about women.... Man has eaten of the Tree of Knowledge. 
His innocence is gone.  You can't have your cake and eat it. 
We're in for knowledge; let's have it plain and straight.  I
should begin, I think, by abolishing the ideas of decency and
indecency...."  
<P>
"Grundy would have fits!" I injected.
<P>
"Grundy, Ponderevo, would have cold douches--publicly--if the
sight was not too painful--three times a day.... But I don't
think, mind you, that I should let the sexes run about together. 
No.  The fact behind the sexes--is sex.  It's no good humbugging.
It trails about--even in the best mixed company.  Tugs at your
ankle.  The men get showing off and quarrelling--and the women. 
Or they're bored.  I suppose the ancestral  males have competed
for the ancestral females ever since they were both some sort of
grubby little reptile.  You aren't going to alter that in a
thousand years or so.... Never should you have a mixed company,
never--except with only one man or only one woman.  How would
that be?...
<P>
"Or duets only?...
<P>
"How to manage it?  Some rule of etiquette, perhaps."... He
became portentously grave.
<P>
Then his long hand went out in weird gestures.
<P>
"I seem to see--I seem to see--a sort of City of Women,
Ponderevo.  Yes.... A walled enclosure--good stone-mason's
work--a city wall, high as the walls of Rome, going about a
garden.  Dozens of square miles of garden--trees--fountains--
arbours--lakes.  Lawns on which the women play, avenues in which
they gossip, boats.... Women like that sort of thing.  Any woman
who's been to a good eventful girls' school lives on the memory
of it for the rest of her life.  It's one of the pathetic things
about women--the superiority of school and college--to anything
they get afterwards.  And this city-garden of women will have
beautiful places for music, places for beautiful dresses, places
for beautiful work.  Everything a woman can want.  Nurseries.
Kindergartens.  Schools.  And no man--except to do rough work,
perhaps--ever comes in.  The men live in a world where they can
hunt and engineer, invent and mine and manufacture, sail ships,
drink deep and practice the arts, and fight--"
<P>
"Yes," I said, "but--"
<P>
He stilled me with a gesture.
<P>
"I'm coming to that.  The homes of the women, Ponderevo, will be
set in the wall of their city; each woman will have her own
particular house and home, furnished after her own heart in her
own manner--with a little balcony on the outside wall.  Built
into the wall--and a little balcony.  And there she will go and
look out, when the mood takes her, and all round the city there
will be a broad road and seats and great shady trees.  And men
will stroll up and down there when they feel the need of feminine
company; when, for instance, they want to talk about their souls
or their characters or any of the things that only women will
stand.... The women will lean over and look at the men and smile
and talk to them as they fancy.  And each woman will have this;
she will have a little silken ladder she can let down if she
chooses--if she "wants to talk closer..."  
<P>
"The men would still be competing."  
<P>
"There perhaps--yes.  But they'd have to abide by the women's
decisions."  
<P>
I raised one or two difficulties, and for a while we played  with
this idea.
<P>
"Ewart," I said, "this is like Doll's Island.
<P>
"Suppose," I reflected, "an unsuccessful man laid siege to a
balcony and wouldn't let his rival come near it?" 
<P>
"Move him on," said Ewart, "by a special regulation.  As one does
organ-grinders.  No difficulty about that.  And you could forbid
it--make it against the etiquette. No life is decent without
etiquette.... And people obey etiquette sooner than laws..."  
<P>
"H'm," I said, and was struck by an idea that is remote in the
world of a young man.  "How about children?" I asked; "in the
City?  Girls are all very well.  But boys, for example--grow up."
<P>
"Ah!" said Ewart.  "Yes.  I forgot.  They mustn't grow up
inside.... They'd turn out the boys when they were seven.  The
father must come with a little pony and a little gun and manly
wear, and take the boy away.  Then one could come afterwards to
one's mother's balcony.... It must be fine to have a mother. 
The father and the son..."  
<P>
"This is all very pretty in its way," I said at last, "but it's a
dream.  Let's come back to reality.  What I want to know is, what
are you going to do in Brompton, let us say, or Walham Green
NOW?" 
<P>
"Oh! damn it!" he remarked, "Walham Green!  What a chap you are,
Ponderevo!" and he made an abrupt end to his discourse.  He
wouldn't even reply to my tentatives for a time.
<P>
"While I was talking just now," he remarked presently,
<P>
"I had a quite different idea."  
<P>
"What?" 
<P>
"For a masterpiece.  A series.  Like the busts of the Caesars. 
Only not heads, you know.  We don't see the people who do things
to us nowadays..."  
<P>
"How will you do it, then?" 
<P>
"Hands--a series of hands! The hands of the Twentieth  Century. 
I'll do it.  Some day some one will discover it--go there--see
what I have done, and what is meant by it."  
<P>
"See it where?" 
<P>
"On the tombs.  Why not?  The Unknown Master of the Highgate
Slope!  All the little, soft feminine hands, the nervous ugly
males, the hands of the flops, and the hands of the snatchers!
And Grundy's loose, lean, knuckly affair--Grundy the terror!--the
little wrinkles and the thumb!  Only it ought to hold all the
others together--in a slightly disturbing squeeze....Like
Rodin's great Hand--you know the thing!" 
<P>
IV
<P>
I forget how many days intervened between that last breaking off
of our engagement and Marion's surrender.  But I recall now the
sharpness of my emotion, the concentrated  spirit of tears and
laughter in my throat as I read the words of her unexpected
letter--"I have thought over everything, and I was selfish...."  
I rushed off to Walham Green that evening to give back all she
had given me, to beat her altogether at giving.  She was
extraordinarily gentle and generous that time, I remember, and
when at last I left her, she kissed me very sweetly.
<P>
So we were married.
<P>
We were married with all the customary incongruity.  I
gave--perhaps after a while not altogether ungrudgingly--and 
what I gave, Marion took, with a manifest satisfaction.  After
all, I was being sensible.  So that we had three livery carriages
to the church (one of the pairs of horses matched) and
coachmen--with improvised flavour and very shabby silk
hats--bearing white favours on their whips, and my uncle
intervened with splendour and insisted upon having a wedding
breakfast sent in from a caterer's in Hammersmith.  The table had
a great display of chrysanthemums, and there was orange blossom
in the significant place and a wonderful cake.  We also
circulated upwards of a score of wedges of that accompanied by
silver-printed cards in which Marion's name of Ramboat was
stricken out by an arrow in favour of Ponderevo.  We had a little
rally of Marion's relations, and several friends and friends'
friends from Smithie's appeared in the church and drifted
vestry-ward.  I produced my aunt and uncle a select group of
two.  The effect in that shabby little house was one of
exhilarating congestion.  The side-board, in which lived the
table-cloth and the "Apartments" card, was used for a display of
the presents, eked out by the unused balance of the
silver-printed cards.
<P>
Marion wore the white raiment of a bride, white silk and satin,
that did not suit her, that made her seem large and strange to
me; she obtruded bows and unfamiliar contours.  She went through
all this strange ritual of an English wedding with a sacramental
gravity that I was altogether too young and egotistical to
comprehend.  It was all extraordinarily central and important to
her; it was no more than an offensive, complicated, and
disconcerting intrusion of a world I was already beginning to
criticise very bitterly, to me.  What was all this fuss for?  The
mere indecent advertisement that I had been passionately in love
with Marion!  I think, however, that Marion was only very
remotely aware of my smouldering exasperation at having in the
end behaved "nicely."  I had played--up to the extent of dressing
my part; I had an admirably cut frock--coat, a new silk hat,
trousers as light as I could endure them--lighter, in fact--a
white waistcoat, night tie, light gloves.  Marion, seeing me
despondent had the unusual enterprise to whisper to me that I
looked lovely; I knew too well I didn't look myself.  I looked
like a special coloured supplement to Men's Wear, or The Tailor
and Cutter, Full Dress For Ceremonial Occasions.  I had even the
disconcerting sensations of an unfamiliar collar.  I felt
lost--in a strange body, and when I glanced down myself for
reassurance, the straight white abdomen, the alien legs confirmed
that impression.
<P>
My uncle was my best man, and looked like a banker--a little
banker--in flower.  He wore a white rose in his buttonhole.  He
wasn't, I think, particularly talkative.  At least I recall very
little from him.
<P>
"George" he said once or twice, "this is a great occasion for
you--a very great occasion."  He spoke a little doubtfully.
<P>
You see I had told him nothing about Marion until about a week
before the wedding; both he and my aunt had been taken altogether
by surprise.  They couldn't, as people say, "make it out."   My
aunt was intensely interested, much more than my uncle; it was
then, I think, for the first time that I really saw that she
cared for me.  She got me alone, I remember, after I had made my
announcement.  "Now, George," she said, "tell me everything about
her.  Why didn't you tell--ME at least--before?" 
<P>
I was surprised to find how difficult it was to tell her about
Marion.  I perplexed her.
<P>
"Then is she beautiful?" she asked at last.
<P>
"I don't know what you'll think of her," I parried. "I think--"
<P>
"Yes?" 
<P>
"I think she might be the most beautiful person in the world."  
<P>
"And isn't she?  To you?" 
<P>
"Of course," I said, nodding my head.  "Yes.  She IS..."  
<P>
And while I don't remember anything my uncle said or did at the
wedding, I do remember very distinctly certain little things,
scrutiny, solicitude, a curious rare flash of intimacy in my
aunt's eyes.  It dawned on me that I wasn't hiding anything from
her at all.  She was dressed very smartly, wearing a big-plumed
hat that made her neck seem longer and slenderer than ever, and
when she walked up the aisle with that rolling stride of hers and
her eye all on Marion, perplexed into self-forgetfulness, it
wasn't somehow funny.  She was, I do believe, giving my marriage
more thought than I had done, she was concerned beyond measure at
my black rage and Marion's blindness, she was looking with eyes
that knew what loving is--for love.
<P>
In the vestry she turned away as we signed, and I verily believe
she was crying, though to this day I can't say why she should
have cried, and she was near crying too when she squeezed my hand
at parting--and she never said a word or looked at me, but just
squeezed my hand....
<P>
If I had not been so grim in spirit, I think I should have found
much of my wedding amusing.  I remember a lot of ridiculous
detail that still declines to be funny in my memory.  The
officiating clergyman had a cold, and turned his "n's" to "d's,"
and he made the most mechanical compliment conceivable about the
bride's age when the register was signed.  Every bride he had
ever married had had it, one knew.  And two middle-aged
spinsters, cousins of Marion's and dressmakers at Barking, stand
out.  They wore marvellously bright and gay blouses and dim old
skirts, and had an immense respect for Mr. Ramboat.  They threw
rice; they brought a whole bag with them and gave handfuls away
to unknown little boys at the church door and so created a
Lilliputian riot; and one had meant to throw a slipper. It was a
very warm old silk slipper, I know, because she dropped it out of
a pocket in the aisle--there was a sort of jumble in the
aisle--and I picked it up for her.  I don't think she actually
threw it, for as we drove away from the church I saw her in a
dreadful, and, it seemed to me, hopeless, struggle with her
pocket; and afterwards my eye caught the missile of good fortune
lying, it or its fellow, most obviously mislaid, behind the
umbrella-stand in the hall....
<P>
The whole business was much more absurd, more incoherent, more
human than I had anticipated, but I was far too young and serious
to let the latter quality atone for its shortcomings.  I am so
remote from this phase of my youth that I can look back at it all
as dispassionately as one looks at a picture--at some wonderful,
perfect sort of picture that is inexhaustible; but at the time
these things filled me with unspeakable resentment.  Now I go
round it all, look into its details, generalise about its
aspects.  I'm interested, for example, to square it with my
Bladesover theory of the British social scheme.  Under stress of
tradition we were all of us trying in the fermenting chaos of
London to carry out the marriage ceremonies of a Bladesover
tenant or one of the chubby middling sort of people in some
dependent country town.  There a marriage is a public function
with a public significance.  There the church is to a large
extent the gathering-place of the community, and your going to
be married a thing of importance to every one you pass on the
road.  It is a change of status that quite legitimately interests
the whole neighbourhood.  But in London there are no neighbours,
nobody knows, nobody cares.  An absolute stranger in an office
took my notice, and our banns were proclaimed to ears that had
never previously heard our names.  The clergyman, even, who
married us had never seen us before, and didn't in any degree
intimate that he wanted to see us again.
<P>
Neighbours in London! The Ramboats did not know the names of the
people on either side of them.  As I waited for Marion before we
started off upon our honeymoon flight, Mr. Ramboat, I remember,
came and stood beside me and stared out of the window.
<P>
"There was a funeral over there yesterday," he said, by way of
making conversation, and moved his head at the house opposite. 
"Quite a smart affair it was with a glass 'earse...."  
<P>
And our little procession of three carriages with
white-favour-adorned horses and drivers, went through all the
huge, noisy, indifferent traffic like a lost china image in the
coal-chute of an ironclad.  Nobody made way for us, nobody cared
for us; the driver of an omnibus jeered; for a long time we
crawled behind an unamiable dust-cart.  The irrelevant clatter
and tumult gave a queer flavour of indecency to this public
coming  together of lovers.  We seemed to have obtruded ourselves
<P>
shamelessly.  The crowd that gathered outside the church would
have gathered in the same spirit and with greater alacrity for a
street accident....
<P>
At Charing Cross--we were going to Hastings--the experienced eye
of the guard detected the significance of our unusual costume
and he secured us a compartment.
<P>
"Well," said I, as the train moved out of the station, "That's
all over!" And I turned to Marion--a little unfamiliar still, in
her unfamiliar clothes--and smiled.
<P>
She regarded me gravely, timidly.
<P>
"You're not cross?" she asked.
<P>
"Cross!  Why?" 
<P>
"At having it all proper."  
<P>
"My dear Marion!" said I, and by way of answer took and kissed
her white-gloved, leather-scented hand....
<P>
I don't remember much else about the journey, an hour or so it
was of undistinguished time--for we were both confused and a
little fatigued and Marion had a slight headache and did not want
caresses.  I fell into a reverie about my aunt, and realised as
if it were a new discovery, that I cared for her very greatly.  I
was acutely sorry I had not told her earlier of my marriage.
<P>
But you will not want to hear the history of my honeymoon.  I
have told all that was needed to serve my present purpose.  Thus
and thus it was the Will in things had its way with me.  Driven
by forces I did not understand, diverted altogether from the
science, the curiosities and work to which I had once given
myself, I fought my way through a tangle of traditions, customs,
obstacles and absurdities, enraged myself, limited myself, gave
myself to occupations I saw with the clearest vision were
dishonourable and vain, and at last achieved the end of purblind
Nature, the relentless immediacy of her desire, and held, far
short of happiness, Marion weeping and reluctant in my arms.
<P>
V
<P>
Who can tell the story of the slow estrangement of two married
people, the weakening of first this bond and then that of that
complex contact?  Least of all can one of the two participants. 
Even now, with an interval of fifteen years to clear it up for
me, I still find a mass of impressions of Marion as confused, as
discordant, as unsystematic and self-contradictory as life.  I
think of this thing and love her, of that and hate her--of a
hundred aspects in which I can now see her with an unimpassioned
sympathy.  As I sit here trying to render some vision of this
infinitely confused process, I recall moments of hard and fierce
estrangement, moments of clouded intimacy, the passage of
transition all forgotten. We talked a little language together
whence were "friends," and I was "Mutney" and she was "Ming," and
we kept up such an outward show that till the very end Smithie
thought our household the most amiable in the world.
<P>
I cannot tell to the full how Marion thwarted me and failed in
that life of intimate emotions which is the kernel of love.  That
life of intimate emotions is made up of little things.  A
beautiful face differs from an ugly one by a difference of
surfaces and proportions that are sometimes almost
infinitesimally small.  I find myself setting down little things
and little things; none of them do more than demonstrate those
essential temperamental discords I have already sought to make
clear.  Some readers will understand--to others I shall seem no
more than an unfeeling brute who couldn't make allowances.... 
It's easy to make allowances now; but to be young and ardent and
to make allowances, to see one's married life open before one,
the life that seemed in its dawn a glory, a garden of roses, a
place of deep sweet mysteries and heart throbs and wonderful
silences, and to see it a vista of tolerations and baby-talk; a
compromise, the least effectual thing in all one's life.
<P>
Every love romance I read seemed to mock our dull intercourse,
every poem, every beautiful picture reflected upon the uneventful
succession of grey hours we had together.  I think our real
difference was one of aesthetic sensibility.
<P>
I do still recall as the worst and most disastrous aspect of all
that time, her absolute disregard of her own beauty.  It's the
pettiest thing to record, I know, but she could wear curl-papers
in my presence.  It was her idea, too, to "wear out" her old
clothes and her failures at home when "no one was likely to see
her"--"no one" being myself.  She allowed me to accumulate
a store of ungracious and slovenly memories....
<P>
All our conceptions of life differed.  I remember how we differed
about furniture.  We spent three or four days in Tottenham Court
Road, and she chose the things she fancied with an inexorable
resolution,--sweeping aside my suggestions with--"Oh, YOU want
such queer things."  She pursued some limited, clearly seen and
experienced ideal--that excluded all other possibilities. Over
every mantel was a mirror that was draped, our sideboard was
wonderfully good and splendid with beveled glass, we had lamps on
long metal stalks and cozy corners and plants in grog-tubs. 
Smithie approved it all.  There wasn't a place where one could
sit and read in the whole house.  My books went upon shelves in
the dining-room recess.  And we had a piano though Marion's
playing was at an elementary level.
<P>
You know, it was the cruelest luck for Marion that I, with my
restlessness, my scepticism, my constantly developing ideas, had
insisted on marriage with her.  She had no faculty of growth or
change; she had taken her mould, she had set in the limited ideas
of her peculiar  class.  She preserved her conception of what was
right in drawing-room chairs and in marriage ceremonial and in
every relation of life with a simple and luminous honesty and
conviction, with an immense unimaginative inflexibility--as a
tailor-bird builds its nest or a beaver makes its dam.
<P>
Let me hasten over this history of disappointments and
separation.  I might tell of waxings and waning of love between
us, but the whole was waning.  Sometimes she would do things for
me, make me a tie or a pair of slippers, and fill me with none
the less gratitude because the things were absurd.  She ran our
home and our one servant with a hard, bright efficiency.  She was
inordinately proud of house and garden.  Always, by her lights,
she did her duty by me.
<P>
Presently the rapid development of Tono-Bungay began to take me
into the provinces, and I would be away sometimes for a week
together.  This she did not like; it left her "dull," she said,
but after a time she began to go to Smithie's again and to
develop an independence of me.  At Smithie's she was now a woman
with a position;  she had money to spend.  She would take Smithie
to theatres and out to lunch and talk interminably of the
business, and Smithie became a sort of permanent weekender with
us.  Also Marion got a spaniel and began to dabble with the minor
arts, with poker-work and a Kodak and hyacinths in glasses.  She
called once on a neighbour.  Her parents left Walham Green--her
father severed his connection with the gas-works--and came to
live in a small house I took for them near us, and they were much
with us.
<P>
Odd the littleness of the things that exasperate when the
fountains of life are embittered!  My father-in-law was
perpetually catching me in moody moments and urging me to take to
gardening.  He irritated me beyond measure.
<P>
"You think too much," he would say.  "If you was to let in a bit
with a spade, you might soon 'ave that garden of yours a Vision
of Flowers.  That's better than thinking, George."  
<P>
Or in a torrent of exasperation, "I CARN'T think, George, why you
don't get a bit of glass 'ere.  This sunny corner you c'd do
wonders with a bit of glass."  
<P>
And in the summer time he never came in without performing a sort
of conjuring trick in the hall, and taking cucumbers and tomatoes
from unexpected points of his person.  "All out o' MY little
bit," he'd say in exemplary tones.  He left a trail of vegetable
produce in the most unusual places, on mantel boards, sideboards,
the tops of pictures.  Heavens! how the sudden unexpected tomato
could annoy me!...
<P>
It did much to widen our estrangement that Marion and my aunt
failed to make friends, became, by a sort of instinct,
antagonistic.
<P>
My aunt, to begin with, called rather frequently, for she was
really anxious to know Marion.  At first she would arrive like a
whirlwind and pervade the house with an atmosphere of hello!  She
dressed already with that cheerfully extravagant abandon that
signalised her accession to fortune, and dressed her best for
these visits.
<P>
She wanted to play the mother to me, I fancy, to tell Marion
occult secrets about the way I wore out my boots and how I never
could think to put on thicker things in cold weather.  But Marion
received her with that defensive suspiciousness of the shy
person, thinking only of the possible criticism of herself; and
my aunt, perceiving this, became nervous and slangy...
<P>
"She says such queer things," said Marion once, discussing her. 
"But I suppose it's witty."  
<P>
"Yes," I said; "it IS witty."  
<P>
"If I said things like she does--"
<P>
The queer things my aunt said were nothing to the queer things
she didn't say.  I remember her in our drawing-room one day, and
how she cocked her eye--it's the only expression--at the
India-rubber plant in a Doulton-ware pot which Marion had
placed on the corner of the piano.
<P>
She was on the very verge of speech.  Then suddenly she caught my
expression, and shrank up like a cat that has been discovered
looking at the milk.
<P>
Then a wicked impulse took her.
<P>
"Didn't say an old word, George," she insisted, looking me full
in the eye.
<P>
I smiled.  "You're a dear," I said, "not to," as Marion came
lowering into the room to welcome her. But I felt extraordinarily
like a traitor--to the India-rubber plant, I suppose--for all
that nothing had been said...
<P>
"Your aunt makes Game of people," was Marion's verdict, and,
open-mindedly:  "I suppose it's all right... for her."  
<P>
Several times we went to the house in Beckenham for lunch, and
once or twice to dinner.  My aunt did her peculiar best to be
friends, but Marion was implacable.  She was also, I know,
intensely uncomfortable, and she adopted as her social method, an
exhausting silence, replying compactly and without giving
openings to anything that was said to her.
<P>
The gaps between my aunt's visits grew wider and wider.
<P>
My married existence became at last like a narrow deep groove in
the broad expanse of interests in which I was living.  I went
about the world; I met a great number of varied personalities; I
read endless books in trains as I went to and fro.  I developed
social relationships at my uncle's house that Marion did not
share.  The seeds of new ideas poured in upon me and grew in me. 
Those early and middle years of one's third decade are, I
suppose, for a man the years of greatest mental growth.  They are
restless years and full of vague enterprise.
<P>
Each time I returned to Ealing, life there seemed more alien,
narrow, and unattractive--and Marion less beautiful and more
limited and difficult--until at last she was robbed of every
particle of her magic.  She gave me always a cooler welcome, I
think, until she seemed entirely apathetic.  I never asked myself
then what heartaches she might hide or what her discontents might
be.
<P>
I would come home hoping nothing, expecting nothing.
<P>
This was my fated life, and I had chosen it.  I became more
sensitive to the defects I had once disregarded  altogether; I
began to associate her sallow complexion with her temperamental
insufficiency, and the heavier lines of her mouth and nostril
with her moods of discontent.  We drifted apart; wider and wider
the gap opened.  I tired of baby-talk and stereotyped little
fondlings; I tired of the latest intelligence from those
wonderful workrooms, and showed it all too plainly; we hardly
spoke when we were alone together.  The mere unreciprocated
physical residue of my passion remained--an exasperation between
us.
<P>
No children came to save us.  Marion had acquired at Smithie's a
disgust and dread of maternity.  All that was the fruition and
quintessence of the "horrid" elements in life, a disgusting
thing, a last indignity that overtook unwary women.  I doubt
indeed a little if children would have saved us; we should have
differed so fatally about their upbringing.
<P>
Altogether, I remember my life with Marion as a long distress,
now hard, now tender.  It was in those days that I first became
critical of my life and burdened with a sense of error and
maladjustment.  I would lie awake in the night, asking myself the
purpose of things, reviewing my unsatisfying, ungainly home-life,
my days spent in rascal enterprise and rubbish-selling,
contrasting all I was being and doing with my adolescent
ambitions, my Wimblehurst dreams.  My circumstances had an air
of finality, and I asked myself in vain why I had forced myself
into them.
<P>
VI
<P>
The end of our intolerable situation came suddenly and
unexpectedly, but in a way that I suppose was almost inevitable.
<P>
My alienated affections wandered, and I was unfaithful to Marion.
<P>
I won't pretend to extenuate the quality of my conduct.   I was a
young and fairly vigorous male; all my appetite for love had been
roused and whetted and none of it had been satisfied by my love
affair and my marriage.  I had pursued an elusive gleam of beauty
to the disregard of all else, and it had failed me.  It had faded
when I had hoped it would grow brighter. I despaired of life and
was embittered.  And things happened as I am telling.  I don't
draw any moral at all in the matter, and as for social remedies,
I leave them to the social reformer.  I've got to a time of life
when the only theories that interest me are generalisations about
realities.
<P>
To go to our inner office in Raggett Street I had to walk through
a room in which the typists worked.  They were the correspondence
typists; our books and invoicing had long since overflowed into
the premises we had had the luck to secure on either side of us. 
I was, I must confess, always in a faintly cloudily-emotional
way aware of that collection of for the most part
round-shouldered femininity, but presently one of the girls
detached herself from the others and got a real hold upon my
attention.  I appreciated her at first as a straight little back,
a neater back than any of the others; as a softly rounded neck
with a smiling necklace of sham pearls; as chestnut hair very
neatly done--and as a side-long glance; presently as a quickly
turned face that looked for me.
<P>
My eye would seek her as I went through on business things--I
dictated some letters to her and so discovered she had pretty,
soft-looking hands with pink nails.  Once or twice, meeting
casually, we looked one another for the flash of a second in the
eyes.
<P>
That was all.  But it was enough in the mysterious free-masonry
of sex to say essential things.  We had a secret between us.
<P>
One day I came into Raggett Street at lunch time and she was
alone, sitting at her desk.  She glanced up as I entered, and
then became very still, with a downcast face and her hands
clenched on the table.  I walked right by her to the door of the
inner office, stopped, came back and stood over her.
<P>
We neither of us spoke for quite a perceptible time. I was
trembling violently.
<P>
"Is that one of the new typewriters?" I asked at last for the
sake of speaking.
<P>
She looked up at me without a word, with her face flushed and her
eyes alight, and I bent down and kissed her lips.  She leant back
to put an arm about me, drew my face to her and kissed me
again and again.  I lifted her and held her in my arms.  She gave
a little smothered cry to feel herself so held.
<P>
Never before had I known the quality of passionate kisses.
<P>
Somebody became audible in the shop outside.
<P>
We started back from one another with flushed faces and bright
and burning eyes.
<P>
"We can't talk here," I whispered with a confident intimacy. 
"Where do you go at five?" 
<P>
"Along the Embankment to Charing Cross," she answered as
intimately.  "None of the others go that way..."  
<P>
"About half-past five?" 
<P>
"Yes, half-past five..."  
<P>
The door from the shop opened, and she sat down very quickly.
<P>
"I'm glad," I said in a commonplace voice, "that these new
typewriters are all right."  
<P>
I went into the inner office and routed out the paysheet in
order to find her name--Effie Rink.  And did no work at all that
afternoon.  I fretted about that dingy little den like a beast in
a cage.
<P>
When presently I went out, Effie was working with an
extraordinary appearance of calm--and there was no look for me at
all....
<P>
We met and had our talk that evening, a talk in whispers when
there was none to overhear; we came to an understanding.  It was
strangely unlike any dream of romance I had ever entertained.
<P>
VII
<P>
I came back after a week's absence to my home again--a changed
man.  I had lived out my first rush of passion for Effie, had
come to a contemplation of my position.  I had gauged Effie's
place in the scheme of things, and parted from her for a time. 
She was back in her place at Raggett Street after a temporary
indisposition.  I did not feel in any way penitent or ashamed, I
know, as I opened the little cast-iron gate that kept Marion's
front grader and Pampas Grass from the wandering dog.  Indeed, if
anything, I felt as if I had vindicated some right that had been
in question.  I came back to Marion with no sense of wrong-doing
at all with, indeed, a new friendliness towards her.  I don't
know how it may be proper to feel on such occasions; that is how
I felt.
<P>
I followed her in our drawing-room, standing beside the tall
lamp-stand that half filled the bay as though she had just
turned from watching for me at the window.  There was something
in her pale face that arrested me.  She looked as if she had not
been sleeping. She did not come forward to greet me.
<P>
"You've come home," she said.
<P>
"As I wrote to you."  
<P>
She stood very still, a dusky figure against the bright window.
<P>
"Where have you been?" she asked.
<P>
"East Coast," I said easily.
<P>
She paused for a moment.  "I KNOW," she said.
<P>
I stared at her.  It was the most amazing moment in any life....
<P>
"By Jove!" I said at last, "I believe you do!" 
<P>
"And then you come home to me!" 
<P>
I walked to the hearthrug and stood quite still there regarding
this new situation.
<P>
"I didn't dream," she began.  "How could you do such a thing?" 
<P>
It seemed a long interval before either of us spoke another word.
<P>
"Who knows about it?" I asked at last.
<P>
"Smithie's brother.  They were at Cromer."  
<P>
"Confound Cromer! Yes!" 
<P>
"How could you bring yourself"
<P>
I felt a spasm of petulant annoyance at this unexpected
catastrophe.
<P>
"I should like to wring Smithie's brother's neck,"  I said....
<P>
Marion spoke in dry, broken fragments of sentences. "You... I'd
always thought that anyhow you couldn't deceive me... I suppose
all men are horrid--about this."  
<P>
"It doesn't strike me as horrid.  It seems to me the most
necessary consequence--and natural thing in the world."  
<P>
I became aware of some one moving about in the passage, and went
and shut the door of the room, then I walked back to the
hearthrug and turned.
<P>
"It's rough on you," I said.  "But I didn't mean you to know. 
You've never cared for me.  I've had the devil of a time.  Why
should you mind?" 
<P>
She sat down in a draped armchair.  "I HAVE cared for you," she
said.
<P>
I shrugged my shoulders.
<P>
"I suppose," she said, "SHE cares for you?" 
<P>
I had no answer.
<P>
"Where is she now?" 
<P>
"Oh! does it matter to you?... Look here, Marion!  This--this I
didn't anticipate.  I didn't mean this thing to smash down on you
like this.  But, you know, something had to happen.  I'm
sorry--sorry to the bottom of my heart that things have come to
this between us.  But indeed, I'm taken by surprise.  I don't
know where I am--I don't know how we got here.  Things took me by
surprise.  I found myself alone with her one day.  I kissed her. 
I went on.  It seemed stupid to go back.  And besides--why should
I have gone back?  Why should I?  From first to last, I've hardly
thought of it as touching you.... Damn!" 
<P>
She scrutinised my face, and pulled at the ball-fringe of the
little table beside her.
<P>
"To think of it," she said.  "I don't believe I can ever touch
you again."  
<P>
We kept a long silence.  I was only beginning to realise in the
most superficial way the immense catastrophe that had happened
between us.  Enormous issues had rushed upon us.  I felt
unprepared and altogether inadequate.  I was unreasonably angry. 
There came a rush of stupid expressions to my mind that my rising
sense of the supreme importance of the moment saved me from
saying.  The gap of silence widened until it threatened to become
the vast memorable margin of some one among a thousand trivial
possibilities of speech that would vex our relations for ever.
<P>
Our little general servant tapped at the door--Marion always
liked the servant to tap--and appeared.
<P>
"Tea, M'm," she said--and vanished, leaving the door open.
<P>
"I will go upstairs," said I, and stopped.  "I will go upstairs" 
I repeated, "and put my bag in the spare room."  
<P>
We remained motionless and silent for a few seconds.
<P>
"Mother is having tea with us to-day," Marion remarked at last,
and dropped the worried end of ball-fringe and stood up
slowly....
<P>
And so, with this immense discussion of our changed relations
hanging over us, we presently had tea with the unsuspecting Mrs.
Ramboat and the spaniel.  Mrs. Ramboat was too well trained in
her position to remark upon our somber preoccupation.  She kept a
thin trickle of talk going, and told us, I remember, that Mr.
Ramboat was "troubled" about his cannas.
<P>
"They don't come up and they won't come up.  He's been round and
had an explanation with the man who sold him the bulbs--and he's
very heated and upset."  
<P>
The spaniel was a great bore, begging and doing small tricks
first at one and then at the other of us.  Neither of us used his
name.  You see we had called him Miggles, and made a sort of trio
in the baby-talk of Mutney and Miggles and Ming.
<P>
VIII
<P>
<P>
Then presently we resumed our monstrous, momentous dialogue.  I
can't now make out how long that dialogue went on.  It spread
itself, I know, in heavy fragments over either three days or
four.  I remember myself grouped with Marion, talking sitting on
our bed in her room, talking standing in our dining-room, saving
this thing or that.  Twice we went for long walks.  And we had a
long evening alone together, with jaded nerves and hearts that
fluctuated between a hard and dreary recognition of facts and, on
my part at least, a strange unwonted tenderness; because in some
extraordinary way this crisis had destroyed our mutual apathy and
made us feel one another again.
<P>
It was a dialogue that had discrepant parts that fell into lumps
of talk that failed to join on to their predecessors, that began
again at a different level, higher or lower, that assumed new
aspects in the intervals and assimilated new considerations.  We
discussed the fact that we two were no longer lovers; never
before had we faced that.  It seems a strange thing to write, but
as I look back, I see clearly that those several days were the
time when Marion and I were closest together, looked for the
first and last time faithfully and steadfastly into each other's
soul.  For those days only, there were no pretences, I made no
concessions to her nor she to me; we concealed nothing,
exaggerated nothing.  We had done with pretending.  We had it out
plainly and soberly with each other.  Mood followed mood and got
its stark expression.
<P>
Of course there was quarreling between us, bitter quarreling, and
we said things to one another--long pent-up things that bruised
and crushed and cut.  But over it all in my memory now is an
effect of deliberate confrontation, and the figure of Marion
stands up, pale, melancholy, tear-stained, injured, implacable
and dignified.
<P>
"You love her?" she asked once, and jerked that doubt into my
mind.
<P>
I struggled with tangled ideas and emotions.  "I don't know what
love is.  It's all sorts of things--it's made of a dozen strands
twisted in a thousand ways."  
<P>
"But you want her?  You want her now--when you think of her?" 
<P>
"Yes," I reflected.  "I want her--right enough."  
<P>
"And me?  Where do I come in?" 
<P>
"I suppose you come in here."  
<P>
"Well, but what are you going to do?" 
<P>
"Do!" I said with the exasperation of the situation growing upon
me.  "What do you want me to do?" 
<P>
As I look back upon all that time--across a gulf of fifteen
active years--I find I see it with an understanding judgment.  I
see it as if it were the business of some one else--indeed of two
other people--intimately known yet judged without passion.  I see
now that this shock, this sudden immense disillusionment, did in
real fact bring out a mind and soul in Marion; that for the first
time she emerged from habits, timidities, imitations, phrases and
a certain narrow will-impulse, and became a personality.
<P>
Her ruling motive at first was, I think, an indignant and
outraged pride.  This situation must end.  She asked me
categorically to give up Effie, and I, full of fresh and glowing
memories, absolutely refused.
<P>
"It's too late, Marion," I said.  "It can't be done like that."  
<P>
"Then we can't very well go on living together," she said.  "Can
we?" 
<P>
"Very well," I deliberated "if you must have it so."  
<P>
"Well, can we?" 
<P>
"Can you stay in this house?  I mean--if I go away?" 
<P>
"I don't know.... I don't think I could."  
<P>
"Then--what do you want?" 
<P>
Slowly we worked our way from point to point, until at last the
word "divorce" was before us.
<P>
"If we can't live together we ought to be free," said Marion.
<P>
"I don't know anything of divorce," I said--"if you mean that. 
I don't know how it is done.  I shall have to ask somebody--or
look it up....  Perhaps, after all, it is the thing to do.  We
may as well face it."  
<P>
We began to talk ourselves into a realisation of what our
divergent futures might be.  I came back on the evening of that
day with my questions answered by a solicitor.
<P>
"We can't as a matter of fact," I said, "get divorced as things
are.  Apparently, so far as the law goes you've got to stand this
sort of thing.  It's silly but that is the law.  However, it's
easy to arrange a divorce.  In addition to adultery there must be
desertion or cruelty.  To establish cruelty I should have to
strike you, or something of that sort, before witnesses. That's
impossible--but it's simple to desert you legally.  I have to go
away from you; that's all.  I can go on sending you money--and
you bring a suit, what is it?--for Restitution of Conjugal
Rights.  The Court orders me to return.  I disobey.  Then you can
go on to divorce me.  You get a Decree Nisi, and once more the
Court tries to make me come back.  If we don't make it up within
six months and if you don't behave scandalously the Decree is
made absolute.  That's the end of the fuss.  That's how one gets
unmarried.  It's easier, you see, to marry than unmarry."  
<P>
"And then--how do I live?  What becomes of me?" 
<P>
"You'll have an income.  They call it alimony.  From a third to a
half of my present income--more if you like--I don't mind--three
hundred a year, say.  You've got your old people to keep and
you'll need all that."  
<P>
"And then--then you'll be free?" 
<P>
"Both of us."  
<P>
"And all this life you've hated"
<P>
I looked up at her wrung and bitter face.  "I haven't hated it,"
I lied, my voice near breaking with the pain of it all.  "Have
you?" 
<P>
IX
<P>
The perplexing thing about life is the irresolvable complexity of
reality, of things and relations alike.  Nothing is simple. 
Every wrong done has a certain justice in it, and every good deed
has dregs of evil. As for us, young still, and still without
self-knowledge, resounded a hundred discordant notes in the
harsh angle of that shock.  We were furiously angry with each
other, tender with each other, callously selfish, generously
self-sacrificing.
<P>
I remember Marion saying innumerable detached things that didn't
hang together one with another, that contradicted one another,
that were, nevertheless, all in their places profoundly true and
sincere.  I see them now as so many vain experiments in her
effort to apprehend the crumpled confusions of our complex moral
landslide.  Some I found irritating beyond measure.  I answered
her--sometimes quite abominably.
<P>
"Of course," she would say again and again, "my life has been a
failure."  
<P>
"I've besieged you for three years," I would retort "asking it
not to be.  You've done as you pleased.  If I've turned away at
last--"
<P>
Or again she would revive all the stresses before our marriage.
<P>
"How you must hate me!  I made you wait.  Well now--I suppose you
have your revenge."  
<P>
"REVENGE!" I echoed.
<P>
Then she would try over the aspects of our new separated lives.
<P>
"I ought to earn my own living," she would insist.
<P>
"I want to be quite independent.  I've always hated London. 
Perhaps I shall try a poultry farm and bees. You won't mind at
first my being a burden.  Afterwards--"
<P>
"We've settled all that," I said.
<P>
"I suppose you will hate me anyhow..."  
<P>
There were times when she seemed to regard our separation with
absolute complacency, when she would plan all sorts of freedoms
and characteristic interests.
<P>
"I shall go out a lot with Smithie," she said.
<P>
And once she said an ugly thing that I did indeed hate her for. 
that I cannot even now quite forgive her.
<P>
"Your aunt will rejoice at all this.  She never cared for me..." 
<P>
Into my memory of these pains and stresses comes the figure of
Smithie, full-charged with emotion, so breathless in the
presence of the horrid villain of the piece that she could make
no articulate sounds.  She had long tearful confidences with
Marion, I know, sympathetic close clingings.  There were moments
when only absolute speechlessness prevented her giving me a
stupendous "talking-to"--I could see it in her eye.  The wrong
things she would have said!  And I recall, too, Mrs. Ramboat's
slow awakening to something in, the air, the growing expression
of solicitude in her eye, only her well-trained fear of Marion
keeping her from speech.
<P>
And at last through all this welter, like a thing fated and
altogether beyond our control, parting came to Marion and me.
<P>
I hardened my heart, or I could not have gone.  For at the last
it came to Marion that she was parting from me for ever.  That
overbore all other things, had turned our last hour to anguish. 
She forgot for a time the prospect of moving into a new house,
she forgot the outrage on her proprietorship and pride.  For
the first time in her life she really showed strong emotions in
regard to me, for the first time, perhaps, they really came to
her.  She began to weep slow, reluctant tears.  I came into her
room, and found her asprawl on the bed, weeping.
<P>
"I didn't know," she cried.  "Oh! I didn't understand!"
<P>
"I've been a fool.  All my life is a wreck!
<P>
"I shall be alone!...MUTNEY!  Mutney, don't leave me!  Oh! 
Mutney!  I didn't understand."  
<P>
I had to harden my heart indeed, for it seemed to me at moments
in those last hours together that at last, too late, the
longed-for thing had happened and Marion had come alive.  A
new-born hunger for me lit her eyes.
<P>
"Don't leave me!" she said, "don't leave me!"  She clung to me;
she kissed me with tear-salt lips.
<P>
I was promised now and pledged, and I hardened my heart against
this impossible dawn.  Yet it seems to me that there were moments
when it needed but a cry, but one word to have united us again
for all our lives.  Could we have united again?  Would that
passage have enlightened us for ever or should we have fallen
back in a week or so into the old estrangement, the old
temperamental opposition?
<P>
Of that there is now no telling.  Our own resolve carried us on
our predestined way.  We behaved more and more like separating
lovers, parting inexorably, but all the preparations we had set
going worked on like a machine, and we made no attempt to stop
them.  My trunks and boxes went to the station.  I packed my bag
with Marion standing before me.  We were like children who had
hurt each other horribly in sheer stupidity, who didn't know now
how to remedy it.  We belonged to each other
immensely--immensely.  The cab came to the little iron gate.
<P>
"Good-bye!" I said.
<P>
"Good-bye."  
<P>
For a moment we held one another in each other's arms and
kissed--incredibly without malice.  We heard our little servant
in the passage going to open the door.  For the last time we
pressed ourselves to one another.  We were not lovers nor
enemies, but two human souls in a frank community of pain.  I
tore myself from her.
<P>
"Go away," I said to the servant, seeing that Marion had followed
me down.
<P>
I felt her standing behind me as I spoke to the cab man.
<P>
I got into the cab, resolutely not looking back, and then as it
started jumped up, craned out and looked at the door.
<P>
It was wide open, but she had disappeared....
<P>
I wonder--I suppose she ran upstairs.
<P>
X
<P>
So I parted from Marion at an extremity of perturbation  and
regret, and went, as I had promised and arranged, to Effie, who
was waiting for me in apartments near Orpington.  I remember her
upon the station platform, a bright, flitting figure looking
along the train for me, and our walk over the fields in the
twilight.  I had expected an immense sense of relief where at
last the stresses of separation were over, but now I found I was
beyond measure wretched and perplexed, full of the profoundest
persuasion of irreparable error.  The dusk and somber Marion were
so alike, her sorrow seemed to be all about me.  I had to hold
myself to my own plans, to remember that I must keep faith with
Effie, with Effie who had made no terms, exacted no guarantees,
but flung herself into my hands.
<P>
We went across the evening fields in silence, towards a sky of
deepening gold and purple, and Effie was close beside me always,
very close, glancing up ever and again at my face.
<P>
Certainly she knew I grieved for Marion, that ours was now no
joyful reunion.  But she showed no resentment and no jealousy. 
Extraordinarily, she did not compete against Marion.  Never once
in all our time together did she say an adverse word of
Marion....
<P>
She set herself presently to dispel the shadow that brooded over
me with the same instinctive skill that some women will show with
the trouble of a child.  She made herself my glad and pretty
slave and handmaid; she forced me at last to rejoice in her.  Yet
at the back of it all Marion remained, stupid and tearful and
infinitely distressful, so that I was almost intolerably unhappy
for her--for her and the dead body of my married love.
<P>
It is all, as I tell it now, unaccountable to me.  I go back into
these remote parts, these rarely visited uplands and lonely tares
of memory, and it seems to me still a strange country.  I had
thought I might be going to some sensuous paradise with Effie,
but desire which fills the universe before its satisfaction,
vanishes utterly like the going of daylight--with achievement. 
All the facts and forms of life remain darkling and cold.  It was
an upland of melancholy questionings, a region from which I saw
all the world at new angles and in new aspects; I had outflanked
passion and romance.
<P>
I had come into a condition of vast perplexities.  For the first
time in my life, at least so it seems to me now in this
retrospect, I looked at my existence as a whole.
<P>
Since this was nothing, what was I doing?  What was I for?
<P>
I was going to and fro about Tono-Bungay--the business I had
taken up to secure Marion and which held me now in spite of our
intimate separation--and snatching odd week-ends and nights for
Orpington, and all the while I struggled with these obstinate
interrogations. I used to fall into musing in the trains, I
became even a little inaccurate and forgetful about business
things.  I have the clearest memory of myself sitting thoughtful
in the evening sunlight on a grassy hillside that looked toward
Seven Oaks and commanded a wide sweep of country,  and that I was
thinking out my destiny.  I could almost write my thought down
now, I believe, as they came to me that afternoon.  Effie,
restless little cockney that she was, rustled and struggled in a
hedgerow below, gathering flowers, discovering flowers she had
never seen before.  I had.  I remember, a letter from Marion in
my pocket.  I had even made some tentatives for return, for a
reconciliation; Heaven knows now how I had put it! but her cold,
ill-written letter repelled me.  I perceived I could never face
that old inconclusive dullness of life again, that stagnant
disappointment.  That, anyhow, wasn't possible.  But what was
possible?  I could see no way of honour or fine living before me
at all.
<P>
"What am I to do with life?" that was the question that besieged
me.
<P>
I wondered if all the world was even as I, urged to this by one
motive and to that by another, creatures of chance and impulse
and unmeaning traditions.  Had I indeed to abide by what I had
said and done and chosen?  Was there nothing for me in honour but
to provide for Effie, go back penitent to Marion and keep to my
trade in rubbish--or find some fresh one--and so work out the
residue of my days?  I didn't accept that for a moment.  But what
else was I to do?  I wondered if my case was the case of many
men, whether in former ages, too, men had been so guideless, so
uncharted, so haphazard in their journey into life.  In the
Middle Ages, in the old Catholic days, one went to a priest, and
he said with all the finality of natural law, this you are and
this you must do.  I wondered whether even in the Middle Ages I
should have accepted that ruling without question.
<P>
I remember too very distinctly how Effie came and sat beside me
on a little box: that was before the casement window of our room.
<P>
"Gloomkins," said she.
<P>
I smiled and remained head on hand, looking out of the window
forgetful of her.
<P>
"Did you love your wife so well?" she whispered softly.
<P>
"Oh!" I cried, recalled again; "I don't know.  I don't understand
these things.  Life is a thing that hurts, my dear!  It hurts
without logic or reason.  I've blundered!  I didn't understand. 
Anyhow--there is no need to go hurting you, is there?" 
<P>
And I turned about and drew her to me, and kissed her ear....
<P>
Yes, I had a very bad time--I still recall.  I suffered, I
suppose, from a sort of ennui of the imagination.  I found
myself without an object to hold my will together.  I sought.  I
read restlessly and discursively.  I tried Ewart and got no help
from him.  As I regard it all now in this retrospect, it seems to
me as if in those days of disgust and abandoned aims I discovered
myself for the first time.  Before that I had seen only the world
and things in it, had sought them self-forgetful of all but my
impulse.  Now I found myself GROUPED with a system  of
appetites and satisfactions, with much work to do--and no desire,
it seemed, left in me.
<P>
There were moments when I thought of suicide.  At times my life
appeared before me in bleak, relentless light, a series of
ignorances, crude blunderings, degradation and cruelty.  I had
what the old theologians call a "conviction of sin."  I sought
salvation--not perhaps in the formula a Methodist preacher would
recognise but salvation nevertheless.
<P>
Men find their salvation nowadays in many ways.  Names and forms
don't, I think, matter very much; the real need is something that
we can hold and that holds one.  I have known a man find that
determining factor in a dry-plate factory, and another in
writing a history of the Manor.  So long as it holds one, it does
not matter.  Many men and women nowadays take up some concrete 
aspect of Socialism or social reform.  But Socialism for me has
always been a little bit too human, too set about with
personalities and foolishness.  It isn't my line.  I don't like
things so human.  I don't think I'm blind to the fun, the
surprises, the jolly little coarsenesses and insufficiency of
life, to the "humour of it," as people say, and to adventure, but
that isn't the root of the matter with me.  There's no humour in
my blood.  I'm in earnest in warp and woof.  I stumble and
flounder, but I know that over all these merry immediate things,
there are other things that are great and serene, very high,
beautiful things--the reality.  I haven't got it, but it's there
nevertheless.  I'm a spiritual guttersnipe in love with
unimaginable goddesses.  I've never seen the goddesses nor ever
shall--but it takes all the fun out of the mud--and at times I
fear it takes all the kindliness, too.
<P>
But I'm talking of things I can't expect the reader to
understand, because I don't half understand them myself. There is
something links things for me, a sunset or so, a mood or so, the
high air, something there was in Marion's form and colour,
something I find and lose in Mantegna's pictures, something in
the lines of these boats I make.  (You should see X2, my last and
best!)
<P>
I can't explain myself, I perceive.  Perhaps it all comes to
this, that I am a hard and morally limited cad with a mind beyond
my merits.  Naturally I resist that as a complete solution. 
Anyhow, I had a sense of inexorable need, of distress and
insufficiency that was unendurable, and for a time this
aeronautical engineering allayed it....
<P>
In the end of this particular crisis of which I tell so badly, I
idealised Science.  I decided that in power and knowledge lay the
salvation of my life, the secret that would fill my need; that to
these things I would give myself.
<P>
I emerged at last like a man who has been diving in darkness,
clutching at a new resolve for which he had groped desperately
and long.
<P>
I came into the inner office suddenly one day--it must have been
just before the time of Marion's suit for restitution--and  sat
down before my uncle.
<P>
"Look here," I said, "I'm sick of this."  
<P>
"HulLO!" he answered, and put some papers aside.
<P>
"What's up, George?" 
<P>
"Things are wrong."  
<P>
"As how?" 
<P>
"My life," I said, "it's a mess, an infinite mess."  
<P>
"She's been a stupid girl, George," he said; "I partly
understand.  But you're quit of her now, practically, and there's
just as good fish in the sea--"
<P>
"Oh! it's not that!" I cried.  "That's only the part that shows. 
I'm sick--I'm sick of all this damned rascality."  
<P>
"Eh?  Eh?" said my uncle.  "WHAT--rascality?" 
<P>
"Oh, YOU know.  I want some STUFF, man.  I want something to
hold on to.  I shall go amok if I don't get it.  I'm a different
sort of beast from you.  You float in all this bunkum.  _I_ feel
like a man floundering in a universe of soapsuds, up and downs,
east and west.  I can't stand it.  I must get my foot on
something solid or--I don't know what."  
<P>
I laughed at the consternation in his face.
<P>
"I mean it," I said.  "I've been thinking it over. I've made up
my mind.  It's no good arguing.  I shall go in for work--real
work.  No! this isn't work; it's only laborious cheating.  But
I've got an idea!  It's an old idea--I thought of years ago, but
it came back to me.  Look here!  Why should I fence about with
you?  I believe the time has come for flying to be possible. 
Real flying!" 
<P>
"Flying!" 
<P>
I stuck to that, and it helped me through the worst time in my
life.  My uncle, after some half-hearted resistance and a talk
with my aunt, behaved like the father of a spoilt son.  He fixed
up an arrangement that gave me capital to play with, released me
from too constant a solicitude for the newer business
developments--this was in what I may call the later Moggs period
of our enterprises--and I went to work at once with grim
intensity.
<P>
But I will tell of my soaring and flying machines in the proper
place.  I've been leaving the story of my uncle altogether too
long.  I wanted merely to tell how it was I took to this work.  I
took to these experiments after I had sought something that
Marion in some indefinable way had seemed to promise.  I toiled
and forgot  myself for a time, and did many things.  Science too
has been something of an irresponsive mistress since, though I've
served her better than I served Marion.  But at the time Science,
with her order, her inhuman distance, yet steely certainties,
saved me from despair.
<P>
Well, I have still to fly; but incidentally I have invented the
lightest engines in the world.
<P>
I am trying to tell of all the things that happened to me.  It's
hard enough simply to get it put down in the remotest degree
right.  But this is a novel, not a treatise. Don't imagine that I
am coming presently to any sort of solution of my difficulties. 
Here among my drawings and hammerings NOW, I still question
unanswering problems.  All my life has been at bottom, SEEKING,
disbelieving always, dissatisfied always with the thing seen and
the thing believed, seeking something in toil, in force, in
danger, something whose name and nature I do not clearly
understand, something beautiful, worshipful, enduring, mine
profoundly and fundamentally, and the utter redemption of myself;
I don't know--all I can tell is that it is something I have ever
failed to find.
<P>
XI
<P>
But before I finish this chapter and book altogether and go on
with the great adventure of my uncle's career. I may perhaps tell
what else remains to tell of Marion and Effie, and then for a
time set my private life behind me.
<P>
For a time Marion and I corresponded with some regularity,
writing friendly but rather uninforming letters about small
business things.  The clumsy process of divorce completed itself.
<P>
She left the house at Ealing and went into the country with her
aunt and parents, taking a small farm near Lewes in Sussex.  She
put up glass, she put in heat for her father, happy man! and
spoke of figs and peaches.  The thing seemed to promise well
throughout a spring and summer, but the Sussex winter after
London was too much for the Ramboats.  They got very muddy and
dull; Mr. Ramboat killed a cow by improper feeding, and that
disheartened them all.  A twelvemonth saw the enterprise in
difficulties. I had to help her out of this, and then they
returned to London and she went into partnership with Smithie at
Streatham, and ran a business that was intimated on the firm's
stationery as "Robes."  The parents and aunt were stowed away in
a cottage somewhere.  After that the letters became infrequent. 
But in one I remember a postscript that had a little stab of our
old intimacy: "Poor old Miggles is dead."  
<P>
Nearly eight years slipped by.  I grew up.  I grew in experience,
in capacity, until I was fully a man, but with many new
interests, living on a larger scale in a wider world than I could
have dreamt of in my Marion days.  Her letters become rare and
insignificant.  At last came a gap of silence that made me
curious.  For eighteen months or more I had nothing from Marion
save her quarterly receipts through the bank.  Then I damned at
Smithie, and wrote a card to Marion.
<P>
"Dear Marion," I said, "how goes it?"
<P>
She astonished me tremendously by telling me she had married
again--"a Mr. Wachorn, a leading agent in the paper-pattern
trade."  But she still wrote on the Ponderevo and Smith (Robes)
notepaper, from the Ponderevo and Smith address.
<P>
And that, except for a little difference of opinion about the
continuance of alimony which gave me some passages of anger, and
the use of my name by the firm, which also annoyed me, is the end
of Marion's history for me, and she vanishes out of this story. 
I do not know where she is or what she is doing.  I do not know
whether she is alive or dead.  It seems to me utterly grotesque
that two people who have stood so close to one another as she and
I should be so separated, but so it is between us.
<P>
Effie, too, I have parted from, though I still see her at times. 
Between us there was never any intention of marriage nor intimacy
of soul.  She had a sudden, fierce, hot-blooded passion for me
and I for her, but I was not her first lover nor her last.  She
was in another world from Marion.  She had a queer, delightful
nature; I've no memory of ever seeing her sullen or malicious.
She was--indeed she was magnificently--eupeptic.  That, I think,
was the central secret of her agreeableness, and, moreover, that
she was infinitely kind-hearted.  I helped her at last into an
opening she coveted, and she amazed me by a sudden display of
business capacity.  She has now a typewriting bureau in Riffle's
Inn, and she runs it with a brisk vigour and considerable
success, albeit a certain plumpness has overtaken her.  And she
still loves her kind.  She married a year or so ago a boy half
her age--a wretch of a poet, a wretched poet, and given to drugs,
a thing with lank fair hair always getting into his blue eyes,
and limp legs.  She did it, she said, because he needed
nursing....
<P>
But enough of this disaster of my marriage and of my early love
affairs; I have told all that is needed for my picture to explain
how I came to take up aeroplane experiments and engineering
science; let me get back to my essential story, to Tono-Bungay
and my uncle's promotions and to the vision of the world these
things have given me.
