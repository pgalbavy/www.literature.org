<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>DADDY LONGLEGS had such pleasant manners that it was no time at all
before his neighbors agreed that he was a good old soul. And everybody
was glad to claim him as a friend.
</p>
<p>At least, everybody but Mr. Crow! Mr. Crow soon found that people were
asking Daddy's advice on all sorts of questions (because they thought he
was very old--and therefore very wise). And Mr. Crow at once became so
jealous that he didn't know what to do. He began making unkind remarks
about his new rival, saying that no matter how old a person might be,
if he had a small head and eight long legs it was not reasonable to
believe that he could have much of a brain. Whenever anybody mentioned
Daddy's name, Mr. Crow would <u>haw-haw</u> loudly and mutter something about
"old Spindley Legs!"
</p><p>Mr. Crow had spent many summers in Pleasant Valley. And during that time
he had advised thousands of his neighbors. Indeed, he often boasted that
if he had a kernel of corn for every bit of advice he had given away, he
never would have to wonder where he was going to get his next meal.
</p><p>When some friend of Mr. Crow's repeated that speech to Daddy Longlegs,
he observed that Mr. Crow must be very wise.
</p><p>"No doubt----" he added in his thin, quavering voice--"no doubt Mr.
Crow's help would be worth a kernel of corn to anybody who was in
trouble. If his advice was good, no one would object to paying for it.
And if it proved to be bad, no one would miss a kernel of corn."
</p><p>It happened that Daddy Longlegs' comment soon reached the ears of old
Mr. Crow. And it made that gentleman furious.
</p><p>"This is the first time anybody has suggested that my advice is not
always first-class!" he croaked. "Here's this long-legged upstart
interfering in my affairs. I must teach him a lesson!" Mr. Crow
declared.
</p><p>Well, that very afternoon he challenged Daddy Longlegs to a contest.
</p><p>"I intend to prove," said Mr. Crow, "that my advice is always good; and
that yours is always bad."
</p><p>"Very well!" Daddy Longlegs answered. "But I advise you to go home at
once, Mr. Crow. You're very hoarse. And I'm sure you ought to be in
bed."
</p><p>Now, the old gentleman was always hoarse. And since he disliked to have
anyone mention his infirmity, his eyes snapped angrily.
</p><p>"I advise you----" he roared----"I advise you to keep your advice to
yourself."
</p><p>Of course that was a rude speech. But Daddy Longlegs did not take
offense at it. He straightway told Mr. Crow that he ought to wear
rubbers. And Mr. Crow was so enraged that he couldn't speak for as much
as half an hour.
</p><p>It was understood that the contest between Daddy and Mr. Crow would take
place the following morning. And when that time came a big crowd had
gathered upon the stone wall to see the fun.
