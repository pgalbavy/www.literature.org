<p>There came a day when he did not see Maryette as he left for
the corral in the morning.</p>

<p>Her father, very stiff with rheumatism, sat in the sun outside
the arched entrance to the inn.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "she is going to be gone all day today. She has
set and wound the drum in the belfry so that the carillon shall
play every hour while she is absent."</p>

<p>"Where has she gone?" inquired Burley.</p>

<p>"To play the carillon at Nivelle."</p>

<p>"Nivelle!" he exclaimed sharply.</p>

<p>"<em>Oui, monsieur.</em> The Mayor has asked for her. She is
to play for an hour to entertain the wounded." He rested his withered
cheek on his hand and looked out through the window at the sunshine
with aged and tragic eyes. "It is very little to do for our wounded,"
he added aloud to himself.</p>

<p>Burley had sent twenty mules to Nivelle the night before, and
had heard some disquieting rumours concerning that town.</p>

<p>Now he walked out past the dusky, arched passageway into the
sunny street and continued northward under the trees to the barracks
of the Gendarmerie.</p>

<p>"<em>Bon jour l’ami Gargantua!</em>" exclaimed the fat, jovial
brigadier who had just emerged with boots shining, pipe-clay very
apparent, and all rosy from a fresh shave.</p>

<p>"Bong joor, mon vieux copain!" replied Burley, preoccupied with
some papers he was sorting. "Be good enough to look over my papers."</p>

<p>The brigadier took them and examined them.</p>

<p>"Are they <em>en règle</em>?" demanded Burley.</p>

<p>"<em>Parfaitement, mon ami.</em>"</p>

<p>"Will they take me as far as Nivelle?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. But your mules went forward last night with the Remount&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I know. I wish to inspect them again before the veterinary sees
them. Telephone to the corral for a saddle mule."</p>

<p>The brigadier went inside to telephone and Burley started for
the corral at the same time.</p>

<p>His cream-coloured, wall-eyed mule was saddled and waiting when
he arrived; he stuffed his papers into the breast of his tunic
and climbed into the saddle.</p>

<p>"Allongs!" he exclaimed. "Hoop!"</p>

<p>Half way to Nivelle, on an overgrown, bushy, circuitous path
which was the only road open between Nivelle and Sainte Lesse,
he overtook Maryette, driving her donkey and ancient market cart.</p>

<p>"Carillonnette!" he called out joyously. "Maryette! C’est je!"</p>

<p>The girl, astonished, turned her head, and he spurred forward
on his wall-eyed mount, evincing cordial symptoms of pleasure
in the encounter.</p>

<p>"Wee, wee!" he cried. "Je voolay veneer avec voo!" And ere the
girl could protest, he had dismounted, turning the wall-eyed one’s
nose southward, and had delivered a resounding whack upon the
rump of that temperamental animal.</p>

<p>"Allez! Go home! Beat it!" he cried.</p>

<p>The mule lost no time but headed for the distant corral at a
canter; and Burley, grinning like a great, splendid, intelligent
dog who has just done something to be proud of, stepped into the
market cart and seated himself beside Maryette.</p>

<p>"Who told you where I am going?" she asked, scarcely knowing
whether to laugh or let loose her indignation.</p>

<p>"Your father, Carillonnette."</p>

<p>"Why did you follow me?"</p>

<p>"I had nothing else to do&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Is that the reason?"</p>

<p>"I like to be with you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Really, monsieur! And you think it was not necessary to consult
my wishes?"</p>

<p>"Don’t you like to be with me?" he asked, so naïvely that the
girl blushed and bit her lip and shook the reins without replying.</p>

<p>They jogged on through the disused byway, the filbert bushes
brushing axle and traces; but presently the little donkey relapsed
into a walk again, and the girl, who had counted on that procedure
when she started from Sainte Lesse, did not urge him.</p>

<p>"Also," she said in a low voice, "I have been wondering who permits
you to address me as Carillonnette. Also as Maryette. You have
been, heretofore, quite correct in assuming that mademoiselle
is the proper form of address."</p>

<p>"I was so glad to see you," he said, so simply that she flushed
again and offered no further comment.</p>

<p>For a long while she let him do the talking, which was perfectly
agreeable to him. He talked on every subject he could think of,
frankly practicing idioms on her, pleased with his own fluency
and his progress in French.</p>

<p>After a while she said, looking around at him with a curiosity
quite friendly:</p>

<p>"Tell me, Monsieur Burley, <em>why</em> did you desire to come
with me today?"</p>

<p>He started to reply, but checked himself, looking into the dark
blue and engaging eyes. After a moment the engaging eyes became
brilliantly serious.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she repeated. "Is it because there were some rumours
last evening concerning Nivelle?"</p>

<p>"Wee!"</p>

<p>"Oh," she nodded, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>After driving for a little while in silence she looked around
at him with an expression on her face which altered it exquisitely.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my friend," she murmured.... "And if you wish to
call me Carillonnette&mdash;do so."</p>

<p>"I do want to. And my name’s Jack.... If you don’t mind."</p>

<p>Her eyes were fixed on her donkey’s ears.</p>

<p>"Djack," she repeated, musingly. "Jacques &mdash;Djack&mdash;it’s
the same, isn’t it &mdash;Djack?"</p>

<p>He turned red and she laughed at him, no longer afraid.</p>

<p>"Listen, my friend," she said, "it is <em>très beau</em>&mdash;what
have you done."</p>

<p>"Vooz êtes tray belle&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Non!</em> Please stop! It is not a question of me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Vooz êtes tray chick&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Stop, Djack! That is not good manners! No! I was merely saying
that&mdash;you have done something very nice. Which is quite true.
You heard rumours that Nivelle had become unsafe. People whispered
last evening&mdash;something about the danger of a salient being cut
at its base.... I heard the gossip in the street. Was that why
you came after me?"</p>

<p>"Wee."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Djack."</p>

<p>She leaned a trifle forward in the cart, her dimpled elbows on
her knees, the reins sagging.</p>

<p>Blue and rosy jays flew up before them, fluttering away through
the thickets; a bullfinch whistled sweetly from a thorn bush,
watching them pass under him, unafraid.</p>

<p>"You see," she said, half to herself, "I <em>had</em> to come.
Who could refuse our wounded? There is no bell-master in our department;
and only one bell-mistress.... To find anyone else to play the
Nivelle carillon one would have to pierce the barbarians’ lines
and search the ruins of Flanders for a <em>Beiaardier</em>&mdash;a
<em>Klokkenist</em>, as they call a carillonneur in the low countries....
But the Mayor asked it, and our wounded are waiting. You understand,
<em>mon ami</em> Djack, I had to come."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>She added, naïvely:</p>

<p>"God watches over our trenches. We shall be quite safe in Nivelle."</p>

<p>A dull boom shook the sunlit air. Even in the cart they could
feel the vibration.</p>

<p>An hour later, everywhere ahead of them, a vast, confused thundering
was steadily increasing, deepening with every ominous reverberation.</p>

<p>Where two sandy wood roads crossed, a mounted gendarme halted
them and examined their papers.</p>

<p>"My poor child," he said to the girl, shaking his head, "the
wounded at Nivelle were taken away during the night. They are
fighting there now in the streets."</p>

<p>"In Nivelle streets!" faltered the girl.</p>

<p>"<em>Oui, mademoiselle.</em> Of the carillon little remains.
The Boches have been shelling it since daylight. Turn again. And
it is better that you turn quickly, because it is not known to
us what is going on in that wooded district over there. For if
they get a foothold in Nivelle on this drive they might cross
this road before evening."</p>

<p>The girl sat grief-stricken and silent in the cart, staring at
the woods ahead where the road ran through taller saplings and
where, here and there, mature trees towered.</p>

<p>All around them now the increasing thunder rolled and echoed
and shook the ground under them. Half a dozen gendarmes came up
at a gallop. Their officer drew bridle, seized the donkey’s head
and turned animal and cart southward.</p>

<p>"Go back," he said briefly, recognizing Burley and returning
his salute. "You may have to take your mules out of Sainte Lesse!"
he added, as he wheeled his horse. "We are getting into trouble
out here, <em>nom de Dieu</em>!"</p>

<p>Maryette’s head hung as the donkey jogged along, trotting willingly
because his nose was now pointed homeward.</p>

<p>The girl drove with loose and careless rein and in silence; and
beside her sat Burley, his troubled gaze always reverting to the
despondent form beside him.</p>

<p>"Too bad, little girl," he said. "But another time our wounded
shall listen to your carillon."</p>

<p>"Never at Nivelle.... The belfry is being destroyed.... The sweetest
carillon in France&mdash;the oldest, the most beautiful.... Fifty-six
bells, Djack&mdash;a wondrous wilderness of bells rising above where
one stands in the belfry, tier on tier, tier on tier, until one’s
gaze is lost amid the heavenly company aloft.... Oh, Djack! And
the great bell, Clovis! He hangs there&mdash;through hundreds of years
he has spoken with his great voice of God!&mdash;so that they heard
him for miles and miles across the land&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Maryette &mdash;I am so sorry for you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! My carillon of Nivelle! My beloved carillon!"</p>

<p>"Maryette, dear! My little Carillonnette&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;my heart is broken&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Vooz ates tray, tray belle&#11834;"</p>

<p>The sudden crashing of heavy feet in the bushes checked him;
but it was too late to heed it now&mdash;too late to reach for his
holster. For all around them swarmed the men in sea-grey, jerking
the donkey off his forelegs, blocking the little wheels with great,
dirty fists, seizing Burley from behind and dragging him violently
out of the cart.</p>

<p>A near-sighted officer, thin and spare as Death, was talking
in a loud, nasal voice and squinting at Burley where he still
struggled, red and exasperated, in the clutches of four soldiers:</p>

<p>"Also! That is no uniform known to us or to any nation at war
with us. That is not regulation in England&mdash;that collar insignia.
This is a case of a franc-tireur! Now, then, you there in your
costume de fantasie! What have you to say, eh?"</p>

<p>There was a silence; Burley ceased struggling.</p>

<p>"Answer, do you hear? What are you?"</p>

<p>"American."</p>

<p>"Pig-dog!" shouted the gaunt officer. "So you are one of those
Yankee muleteers in your uniform, and armed! It is sufficient
that you are American. If it had not been for America this war
would be ended! But it is not enough, apparently, that you come
here with munitions and food, that you insult us at sea, that
you lie about us and slander us and send your shells and cartridges
to England to slay our people! No! Also you must come to insult
us in your clown’s uniform and with your pistol&mdash;" The man began
to choke with fury, unable to continue, except by gesture.</p>

<p>But the jerky gestures were terribly significant: soldiers were
already pushing Burley across the road toward a great oak tree;
six men fell out and lined up.</p>

<p>"M-my Government&mdash;" stammered the young fellow&mdash;but was given
no opportunity to speak. Very white, the chill sweat standing
on his forehead and under his eyes, he stood against the oak,
lips compressed, grey eyes watching what was happening to him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he understood it was all over.</p>

<p>"Djack!"</p>

<p>He turned his gaze toward Maryette, where she struggled toward
him, held by two soldiers.</p>

<p>"Maryette &mdash;Carillonnette&mdash;" His voice suddenly became steady,
perfectly clear. "<em>Je vous aime</em>, Carillonnette."</p>

<p>"Oh, Djack! Djack!" she cried in terror.</p>

<p>He heard the orders; was aware of the levelled rifles; but his
reckless greyish eyes were now fixed on her, and he began to laugh
almost mischievously.</p>

<p>"Vooz êtes tray belle," he said, "&mdash;tray, tray chick&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Djack!"</p>

<p>But the clang of the volley precluded any response from him except
the half tender, half reckless smile that remained on his youthful
face where he lay looking up at the sky with pleasant, sightless
eyes, and a sunbeam touching the metal mule on his blood-wet collar.</p>
