<p>Everybody knows that Sammy Jay has sharp eyes. In fact, there
are very few of the little forest people whose eyes are as sharp
as Sammy's. That is because he uses them so much. A long time
ago he found out that the more he used his eyes, the sharper they
became, and so there are very few minutes when Sammy is awake
that he isn't trying to see something. He is always looking. That
is the reason he always knows so much about what is going on in
the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows.</p>

<p>Now of course Chatterer the Red Squirrel couldn't disappear without
being missed, particularly by Sammy Jay. And of course Sammy couldn't
miss Chatterer and not wonder what had become of him. At first,
Sammy thought that Chatterer was hiding, but after peeking and
peering and watching in the Old Orchard for a few days, he was
forced to think that either Chatterer had once more moved or else
that something had happened to him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Shadow the Weasel has caught him, after all," thought
Sammy, and straightway flew to a certain place in the Green Forest
where he might find Shadow the Weasel. Sure enough, Shadow was
there. Now of course it wouldn't do to ask right out if Shadow
had caught Chatterer, and Sammy was smart enough to know it.</p>

<p>Illustration: "You tell Chatterer that I'll get him yet!" snarled
Shadow.</p>

<p>"Chatterer the Red Squirrel sends his respects and hopes you
are enjoying your hunt for him," called Sammy.</p>

<p>Shadow looked up at Sammy, and anger blazed in his little, red
eyes. "You tell Chatterer that I'll get him yet!" snarled Shadow.</p>

<p>Sammy's eyes sparkled with mischief. He had made Shadow angry,
and he had found out what he wanted to know. He was sure that
Shadow had not caught Chatterer.</p>

<p>"But what can have become of him?" thought Sammy. "I've got no
love for him, but just the same I miss him. I really must find
out. Yes, Sir, I really must."</p>

<p>So every minute that he could spare, Sammy Jay spent trying to
find Chatterer. He asked every one he met if they had seen Chatterer.
He peeked and peered into every hollow and hiding place he could
think of. But look as he would and ask as he would, he could find
no trace of Chatterer. At last he happened to think of Farmer
Brown's corn-crib. Could it be that Chatterer had moved over there
or had come to some dreadful end there? Very early the next morning,
Sammy flew over to the corn-crib. He looked it all over with his
sharp eyes and listened for sounds of Chatterer inside. But not
a sound could he hear. Then he remembered the hole under the edge
of the roof through which Chatterer used to go in and out. Sammy
hurried to look at it. It was closed by a stout board nailed across
it. Then Sammy knew that Farmer Brown's boy had found it.</p>

<p>"He's killed Chatterer, that's what he's done!" cried Sammy,
and flew over to the Old Orchard filled with sad thoughts. He
meant to wait until Farmer Brown's boy came out and then tell
him what he thought of him. After that, he would fly through the
Green Forest and over the Green Meadows to spread the sad news.</p>

<p>After a while, the door of the farmhouse opened, and Farmer Brown's
boy stepped out. Sammy had his mouth open to scream, when his
sharp eyes saw something queer. Farmer Brown's boy had a queer
looking box in his arms which he put on a shelf where the sun
would shine on it. It looked to Sammy as if something moved inside
that box. He forgot to scream and say the bad things he had planned
to say. He waited until Farmer Brown's boy had gone to the barn.
Then Sammy flew where he could look right into the queer box.
There was Chatterer the Red Squirrel!</p>
