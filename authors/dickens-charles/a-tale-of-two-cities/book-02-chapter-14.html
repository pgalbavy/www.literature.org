<P>To THE EYES of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in
Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and
variety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit
upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and
not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending
westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun,
both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple
where the sun goes down!
<P>With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two
streams, like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on
duty watching one stream- saving that Jerry had no expectation of
their ever running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a
hopeful kind, since a small part of his income was derived from the
pilotage of timid women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle
term of life) from Tellson's side of the tides to the opposite
shore. Brief as such companionship was in every separate instance, Mr.
Cruncher never failed to become so interested in the lady as to
express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very good
health. And it was from the gifts bestowed upon him towards the
execution of this benevolent purpose, that he recruited his
finances, as just now observed.
<P>Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and
mused in the sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a
public place, but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and
looked about him.
<P>It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were
few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so
unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.
Cruncher must have been "flopping" in some pointed manner, when an
unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his
attention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of
funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this
funeral, which engendered uproar.
<P>"Young Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, "it's
a buryin'."
<P>"Hooroar, father!" cried Young Jerry.
<P>The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious
significance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched
his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.
<P>"What d'ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to
convey to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting too
many for me!" said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. "Him and his hooroars!
Don't let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me.
D'ye hear?"
<P>"I warn't doing no harm," Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.
<P>"Drop it then," said Mr. Cruncher; "I won't have none of Your no
harms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.
<P>His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and
hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which
mourning coach there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy
trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the
position. The position appeared by no means to please him, however,
with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach, deriding him,
making grimaces at him, and incessantly groaning and calling out:
"Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!" with many compliments too numerous and
forcible to repeat.
<P>Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr.
Cruncher; he always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when
a funeral passed Tellson's. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with
this uncommon attendance excited him greatly, and he asked of the
first man who ran against him:
<P>"What is it, brother? What's it about?"
<P>"I don't know," said the man. "Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!"
<P>He asked another man. "Who is it?"
<P>"I don't know," returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth
nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the
greatest ardour, "Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi-ies!"
<P>At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case,
tumbled against him, and from this person he learned that the
funeral was the funeral of one Roger Cly.
<P>"Was He a spy?" asked Mr. Cruncher.
<P>"Old Bailey spy," returned his informant. "Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old
Bailey Spi-i-ies!"
<P>"Why, to be sure!" exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which
he had assisted. "I've seen him. Dead, is he?"
<P>"Dead as mutton," returned the other, "and can't be too dead. Have
'em out, there! Spies! Pull 'em out, there! Spies!"
<P>The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea,
that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the
suggestion to have 'em out, and to pull 'em out, mobbed the two
vehicles so closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd's opening
the coach doors, the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in
their hands for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good
use of his time, that in another moment he was scouring away up a
bye-street, after shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white
pocket-handkerchief, and other symbolical tears.
<P>These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with
great enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops;
for a crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster
much dreaded. They had already got the length of opening the hearse to
take the coffin out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its
being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing.
Practical suggestions being much needed, this suggestion, too, was
received with acclamation, and the coach was immediately filled with
eight inside and a dozen out, while as many people got on the roof
of the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it.
Among the first of these volunteers was Jerry Cruncher himself, who
modestly concealed his spiky head from the observation of Tellson's,
in the further corner of the mourning coach.
<P>The officiating undertakers made some protest against these
changes in the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near. and
several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing
refractory members of the profession to reason, the protest was
faint and brief. The remodelled procession started, with a
chimney-sweep driving the hearse- advised by the regular driver, who
was perched beside him, under close inspection, for the purpose- and
with a pieman, also attended by his cabinet minister, driving the
mourning coach. A bear-leader, a popular street character of the time,
was impressed as an additional ornament, before the cavalcade had gone
far down the Strand; and his bear, who was black and very mangy,
gave quite an Undertaking air to that part of the procession in
which he walked.
<P>Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite
caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way,
recruiting at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its
destination was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the
fields. It got there in course of time; insisted on pouring into the
burial-ground; finally, accomplished the interment of the deceased
Roger Cly in its own way, and highly to its own satisfaction.
<P>The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of
providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter genius
(or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual
passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase
was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been
near the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this
fancy, and they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to
the sport of window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of
public-houses, was easy and natural. At last, after several hours,
when sundry summer houses had been pulled down, and some area-railings
had been torn up, to arm the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got
about that the Guards were coming. Before this rumour, the crowd
gradually melted away, and perhaps the Guards came, and perhaps they
never came, and this was the usual progress of a mob.
<P>Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had
remained behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the
undertakers. The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured
a pipe from a neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in
at the railings and maturely considering the spot.
<P>"Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,
"you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes
that he was a young 'un and a straight made 'un."
<P>Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned
himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on
his station at Tellson's. Whether his meditations on mortality had
touched his liver, or whether his general health had been previously
at all amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an
eminent man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short
call upon his medical adviser- a distinguished surgeon- on his way
back.
<P>Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and
reported No job in his absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks
came out, the usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went
home to tea.
<P>"Now, I tell you where it is!" said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on
entering. "If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong
to-night, I shall make sure that you've been praying again me, and I
shall work you for it just the same as if I seen you do it."
<P>The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.
<P>"Why, you're at it afore my face!" said Mr. Cruncher, with signs
of angry apprehension.
<P>"I am saying nothing."
<P>"Well, then; don't meditate nothing. You might as well flop as
meditate. You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it
altogether."
<P>"Yes, Jerry."
<P>"Yes, Jerry," repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. "Ah! It
is yes, Jerry. That's about it. You may say yes, Jerry."
<P>Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky
corroborations, but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do,
to express general ironical dissatisfaction.
<P>"You and your yes, Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of
his bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large
invisible oyster out of his saucer. "Ah! I think so. I believe you."
<P>"You are going out to-night?" asked his decent wife, when he took
another bite.
<P>"Yes, I am."
<P>"May I go with you, father?" asked his son, briskly.
<P>"No, you mayn't. I'm a going- as your mother knows- a fishing.
That's where I'm going to. Going a fishing."
<P>"Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don't it, father?"
<P>"Never you mind."
<P>"Shall you bring any fish home, father?"
<P>"If I don't, you'll have short commons, to-morrow," returned that
gentleman, shaking his head; "that's questions enough for you; I ain't
a going out, till you've been long abed."
<P>He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping
a most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in
conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions
to his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in
conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by
dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather
than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The
devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy
of an honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. It was
as if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost
story.
<P>"And mind you!" said Mr. Cruncher. "No games to-morrow! If I, as a
honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none of
your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest
tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring on
water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly
customer to you, if you don't. I'm your Rome, you know."
<P>Then he began grumbling again:
<P>"With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink! I
don't know how scarce you mayn't make the wittles and drink here, by
your flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy:
he is your'n, ain't he? He's as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a
mother, and not know that a mother's first duty is to blow her boy
out?"
<P>This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother
to perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected,
above all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that
maternal function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other
parent.
<P>Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young
Jerry was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar
injunctions, obeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of
the night with solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion
until nearly one o'clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose
up from his chair, took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked
cupboard, and brought forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a
rope and chain, and other fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing
these articles about him in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting
defiance on Mrs. Cruncher, extinguished the light, and went out.
<P>Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to
bed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he
followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down
the court, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness
concerning his getting into the house again, for it was full of
lodgers, and the door stood ajar all night.
<P>Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of
his father's honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house
fronts, walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another,
held his honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering
Northward, had not gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of
Izaak Walton, and the two trudged on together.
<P>Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the
winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a
lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here- and that so
silently, that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have
supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a
sudden, split himself into two.
<P>The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three
stopped under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank
was a low brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow
of bank and wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind
lane, of which the wall- there, risen to some eight or ten feet
high- formed one side. Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the
lane, the next object that Young Jerry saw, was the form of his
honoured parent, pretty well defined against a watery and clouded
moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate. He was soon over, and then the
second fisherman got over, and then the third. They all dropped softly
on the ground within the gate, and lay there a little- listening
perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands and knees.
<P>It was now Young Jerry's turn to approach the gate: which he did,
holding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and
looking in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank
grass! and all the gravestones in the churchyard- it was a large
churchyard that they were in- looking on like ghosts in white, while
the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant.
They did not creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And
then they began to fish.
<P>They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent
appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew.
Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful
striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made
off, with his hair as stiff as his father's.
<P>But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not
only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They
were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for
the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was
a screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures
were strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke
away the earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well
knew what it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured
parent about to wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the
sight, that he made off again, and never stopped until he had run a
mile or more.
<P>He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than
breath, it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly
desirable to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin
he had seen was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on
behind him, bolt upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point
of overtaking him and hopping on at his side- perhaps taking his
arm- it was a pursuer to shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous
fiend too, for, while it was making the whole night behind him
dreadful, he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful
of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy's-Kite
without tail and wings. It hid in doorways too, rubbing its horrible
shoulders against doors, and drawing them up to its ears, as if it
were laughing. It got into shadows on the road, and lay cunningly on
its back to trip him up. All this time it was incessantly hopping on
behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy got to his own door he
had reason for being half dead. And even then it would not leave
him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair, scrambled
into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on his breast when
he fell asleep.
<P>From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened
after daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in
the family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young
Jerry inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher
by the ears, and knocking the back of her head against the
head-board of the bed.
<P>"I told you I would," said Mr. Cruncher, "and I did."
<P>"Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!" his wife implored.
<P>"You oppose yourself to the profit of the business," said Jerry,
"and me and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the
devil don't you?"
<P>"I try to be a good wife, Jerry," the poor woman protested, with
tears.
<P>"Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business? Is it
honouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your
husband to disobey him on the vital subject of his business?"
<P>"You hadn't taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry."
<P>"It's enough for you," retorted Mr. Cruncher, "to be the wife of a
honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations
when he took to his trade or when he didn't. A honouring and obeying
wife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious
woman? If you're a religious woman, give me a irreligious one! You
have no more nat'ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames
river has of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you."
<P>The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated
in the honest tradesman's kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying
down at his length on the floor. After taking a timid peep at him
lying on his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow,
his son lay down too, and fell asleep again.
<P>There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else.
Mr. Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron
pot-lid by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher. in
case he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was
brushed and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to
pursue his ostensible calling.
<P>Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father's
side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different
Young Jerry from him of the previous night, running home through
darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh
with the day, and his qualms were gone with the night- in which
particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in
Fleet-street and the City of London, that fine morning.
<P>"Father," said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to
keep at arm's length and to have the stool well between them:
"what's a Resurrection-Man?"
<P>Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, "How
should I know?"
<P>"I thought you knowed everything, father," said the artless boy.
<P>"Hem! Well," returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting of
his hat to give his spikes free play, "he's a tradesman."
<P>"What's his goods, father?" asked the brisk Young Jerry.
<P>"His goods," said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind,
"is a branch of Scientific goods."
<P>"Persons' bodies, ain't it, father?" asked the lively boy.
<P>"I believe it is something of that sort," said Mr. Cruncher.
<P>"Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm
quite growed up!"
<P>Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and
moral way. "It depends upon how you develop your talents. Be careful
to develop your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to
nobody, and there's no telling at the present time what you may not
come to be fit for." As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few
yards in advance, to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr.
Cruncher added to himself: "Jerry, you honest tradesman, there's hopes
wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you
for his mother!"
