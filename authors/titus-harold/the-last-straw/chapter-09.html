<p>While the men were eating that night another rider had come to H.C. He
entered slowly, tied his horse to the fence and walked down along the
cottonwoods toward the house. He stood outside a time, looking through
the window at Jane whose golden head was bowed in the mellow glow of
the student lamp as she worked at her desk.
</p><p>He stepped lightly across the veranda and rapped; at her bidding he
entered.
</p><p>"Dick!" she exclaimed.
</p><p>"Undoubtedly," he said, with forced attempt at lightness.
</p><p>"How did you get here? Why come at this time of day?"--rising and
walking toward him.
</p><p>"I rode a horse, and I came because I couldn't stay away from you any
longer."
</p><p>She looked at him, head tilted a bit to one side, and genuine regret
was in her slow smile.
</p><p>"Oh, Dick, don't look or feel like that! I'm glad to see you, but I
<u>wish</u> you'd stop thinking and talking and looking like that. I
don't like to have you so dreadfully determined ... when it's no use.
</p><p>"All this way to see me! And did you eat? Of course you didn't!"
</p><p>"I don't want anything," he protested glumly.
</p><p>"But you must."
</p><p>She seized on his need as welcome distraction from the love making,
which undoubtedly was his purpose. She took his coat and hat, placed
cigarettes for him and went to the kitchen to help Carlotta prepare a
quick meal. She served it herself, going to pains to make it
attractive, and finally seated herself across the table from Hilton,
who made a pretense of eating.
</p><p>She talked, a bit feverishly, perhaps, but compelled him to stick to
matters far from personal and after he had finished his scant meal and
lighted a cigarette he leaned back in his chair and smiled easily at
her. It was a good smile, open and frank and gentle, but when it died
that nasty light came back; as though the smile showed the man Jane
Hunter had tolerated for long, masking the man she now tried to put
from her.
</p><p>"If your enthusiasm were for anything else, I'd like it," he said.
</p><p>"But it isn't. Why can't you like it as it is?"
</p><p>He ignored the question.
</p><p>"Busy, Jane?"
</p><p>"As the devil on Forty-Second street."
</p><p>"And still think it's worth while?"
</p><p>"The only worth-while thing I've ever done; more worth while every day.
So much worth while that I'm made over from the heart out and I've been
here less than a month!"
</p><p>"After taking a bottle of your bitters I am now able to support my
husband and children," he quoted ironically.
</p><p>"Laugh if you must,"--with a lift of her shoulders. "I mean it."
</p><p>"You get along with the men, Jane?"
</p><p>"Very well so far. They're fine, real, honest men. I like them all.
There are some things I don't quite understand yet," examining a finger
nail closely. "I haven't made up my mind that my foreman can be trusted
or that he's as honest as he seems to be."
</p><p>"The fellow who was with you yesterday?"
</p><p>"No; Dad Hepburn. An older man. He.... He seems to evade me some times."
</p><p>Hilton watched her closely. She was one of the few women he knew who
had been able to judge men; he made a mental note of the name she had
mentioned.
</p><p>The talk became desultory and Dick's eyes clung more closely to Jane's
face, their hard, bright light accentuated. It began to rain and Jane,
hearing, looked out.
</p><p>"Raining! You can't go back tonight. You'll have to stay here. Mr.
Hepburn can fix you up with the rest of the men."
</p><p>He smiled peculiarly at that, for it cut. He made no comment beyond
expressing the belief that a wetting, since it was not cold, would do
no harm. She knew that he did not mean that and contrasted his evasion
with Beck's quiet candor.
</p><p>"What's the idea of the locket?" he asked and Jane looked down at the
trinket with which she had been toying. "You never were much addicted
to ornaments."
</p><p>She laughed with an expression which he did not understand.
</p><p>"Something is in there which is very dear to me," she said. "I don't
wear it as an ornament; as a talisman, rather. I'm getting to be quite
dependent on it." Her manner was outwardly light but at bottom was a
seriousness which she did not wholly cover.
</p><p>"Excuse me ... for intruding on privacies," he said bitterly. Then,
after a moment: "The picture of some cow-puncher lover, perhaps?"
</p><p>"No, though that wouldn't be unreasonable," she replied. "Such things
have happened in--"
</p><p>"Let's cut this!" he said savagely, breaking in on her and sitting
forward. "Let's quit these absurd banalities.
</p><p>"You know why I came here. You know what's in my mind. There's a job
before me that gets bigger every day; the least you can do is to help
me."
</p><p>"In what?"
</p><p>"Tell me what I must do to make you understand that I love you."
</p><p>He leaned across the table intently. The girl laughed.
</p><p>"Prove to me first that two and two make six!"
</p><p>"Meaning?"
</p><p>"That it can't be done."
</p><p>"It's the first time you've ever been that certain."
</p><p>"The first time I've ever expressed the certainty, perhaps. Things
happen, Dick. I progress."
</p><p>"Do you mean such an impossible thing as that there is someone else?"
</p><p>"Another question which you have no right to ask."
</p><p>"Jane, look at me! Are you wholly insane?"
</p><p>"No, but as I look back I think I have been a little off, perhaps."
</p><p>"But you're putting behind you everything that is of you,"--his color
rising with his voice as her secure conviction maddened him. "The life
that is yours by nature and training. You're going blindly ahead into
something you don't know, among people who are not yours!"
</p><p>He became suddenly tense, as though the passion which he had repressed
until that moment swept through him with a mighty urge. His breath
slipped out in a long sigh.
</p><p>"You are repeatedly mistaken, Dick. I have just found my people."
</p><p>"<u>Your</u> people!" he scoffed.
</p><p>She nodded.
</p><p>"'East is East and West is West,' you know, and the two shall never
meet. It must be true, and, if so, I have never been of the east. I
never felt comfortable there, with the lies and the shams and the
hypocrisies that were all about us. Out here, I do.
</p><p>"Perhaps that is why you and I...." She shrugged her shoulders again.
"You see, Dick, I have cast my lot here. The East is gone, for me; it
never can pass for you. I have found my people; they are my people,
their Gods are my Gods. I have a strength, a peace of mind, self
respect, ambitions and natural, real impulses that I never knew before.
I feel that I have come home!"
</p><p>He laughed dryly, but she went on as though she had not heard:
</p><p>"You have never understood me; you never can hope to now. There's a
gulf between us, Dick, that will never be bridged. I am sorry, in a
way. I never can love you and I hate to see you wasting your desires on
me.
</p><p>"I have thought about you a great deal lately. You are missing all that
is fine in life and because of that I am sorry for you. We used to have
one thing in common: the lack of worthy ideals. I have wiped out that
lack and I wish you might; I truly wish that, Dick! And it seems
possible to me that you may, just because you are here where realities
count. There's an incentive in the atmosphere and I do hope it gets
into your blood.
</p><p>"It is all so nonsensical, the thing you are doing, so foolish. I
suppose I am the only thing you have ever wanted that you couldn't get
and that's what stimulates your want. It's not love, Dick."
</p><p>"How do you know?"
</p><p>"I have learned things in these weeks," with a wistful smile. "I have
learned about ... men, for one thing. I have found an honesty, an
honor, a simple directness, which I have never known before."
</p><p>He rose and leaned his fists on the table.
</p><p>"You mean you've found a lover?"
</p><p>She met his eyes frankly.
</p><p>"Again I say, you have no right to ask that question. In the second
place, I am not yet sure."
</p><p>His mouth drew down in a leer.
</p><p>"So that's it, eh? So you would turn me away for some rough-neck who
murders the English language and smells of horse. You'd let a thing
like that overwhelm you in a few days when a civilized human has failed
after years of trying!
</p><p>"I've tried to treat you with respect. I've tried to be gentle and
honorable. Now if you don't want that, if you want this he-man sort of
wooing, by God you'll get it!"
</p><p>He kicked his chair back angrily and advanced about the table. A big
blue vein which ran down over his forehead stood out in knots. Jane
rose.
</p><p>"Dick!" she cried and in the one word was disappointment, anger,
appeal, reproach, query.
</p><p>"Oh, I'm through," he muttered. "I used to think you were a different
sort; used to think you were fine and finished. But if you're a woman
in the raw ... then I'll treat you as such. You've got me, either way;
I can't get you out of my mind an hour.
</p><p>"I'm through holding myself back, now. You've driven me mad and you
prove by your own insinuations that the lover you want is not the one
who will dally with you. You want the primitive, go-and-get-it kind,
the kind that takes and keeps. Well, mine can be that kind!"
</p><p>She backed from him slowly and he kept on advancing with a menacing
assurance, his face contorted with jealousy and desire.
</p><p>"The other day,"--stopping a moment, "when I took your hands and felt
your body here in this room I was almost beside myself. You haven't
been out of my thoughts an hour since then! I tried to kill it with
reason and then with drink. I've tried to be patient and wait among the
 ... the cattle in that little town." He walked on toward
her.
</p><p>"Dick, are you mad?" she challenged, trying to summon her assurance
through the fright which he had given her. "It's not what you think....
It's none of your affair--
</p><p>"Dick!"
</p><p>He grasped her wrists roughly.
</p><p>"Am I mad?" he repeated, looking down at her, his jaw clenched. "Yes,
I'm mad. Mad from want of you ... your eyes, your lips, your hair,
your very breath drives me mad and when I hear you tell me that you've
found the flesh that calls to your flesh among these men it drives me
wild! I can offer you more than any of them can a thousand times
over....
</p><p>"Great God, I love you!"
</p><p>But his snarl was not the snarl of devotion, of affection. It was the
lust cry of the destroyer, he who would possess hungrily, unthinkingly,
without sympathy or understanding ... even without respect.
</p><p>He drew her to him roughly and she struggled, too frightened to cry
out, face white and lips closed. He imprisoned both her hands in his
one and with the other arm about her body crushed it against his, her
breast to his breast, her limbs to his limbs. He lowered his lips
toward her face and she bent backward, crying out lowly, but the touch
of her lithe torso, tense in the struggle to be free, made his strength
greater, swept away the last barrier of caution and his body was aflame
with desire.
</p><p>"Dick ... stop...." she panted and managed to free one hand.
</p><p>She struck him on the mouth and struck again, blindly. He gave her
efforts no notice but, releasing her hands, crushed her to him with
both arms and she could feel the quick come and go of his breath
through her hair as he buried his face in it.
</p><p>And at that she became possessed of fresh strength. She turned and half
slipped, half fought her way through his clutch, running down the room
to the fireplace where she stood with the davenport between them
breathing irregularly, a hand clenched at her breast.
</p><p>"You ... you beast!" she said, slowly, unsteadily as he came toward her
again.
</p><p>"Yes, beast!" he echoed. "We're all beasts, every one of us who sees
and feels and I've seen you and I've felt you and the beast is hungry!"
</p><p>"And you call that love!" She spoke rapidly, breathlessly. "An hour ago
if anyone would have said that Dick Hilton, sober, would have displayed
this, this <u>thing</u> which is his true self, I'd have come to your
defense! But now ... you ... you!"
</p><p>Her face was flaming, her voice shook with outraged pride.
</p><p>"Stop!" she cried, drawing herself up, no longer afraid. She emerged
from fear commanding, impressive, and Hilton hesitated, putting one
hand to a chair back and eyeing her calculatingly as though scheming.
The vein on his forehead still stood out like an uneven seam.
</p><p>"For shame!" she cried again. "Shame on you, Dick Hilton, and shame on
me for having tolerated, for having believed in you ... little as I
did! Oh, I loathe it all, you and myself--that was--because if it had
not been for that other self which tolerated you, which gave you the
opening, this ... this insult would never have been. You, who failing
to buy a woman's love, would take it by strength! You would do this,
and talk of your desire as love. You, who scoff at men whose respect
for women is as real as the lives they lead. You ... you beast!"
</p><p>She hissed the word.
</p><p>"Yes, beast!" he repeated again. "Like all these other beasts, these
others who are blinding you as you say I have blinded you, who have--"
</p><p>"Stop it!" she demanded again. "There is nothing more to be said ...
ever. We understand one another now and there is but one thing left for
you to do."
</p><p>"And that?"
</p><p>"Go."
</p><p>He laughed bitterly and ran a hand over his sleek hair.
</p><p>"If I go, you go with me," he said evenly.
</p><p>"Leave this house," the girl commanded, but instead of obeying he moved
toward her again menacingly, a disgusting smile on his lips.
</p><p>He passed the end of the davenport and she, in turn, retreated to the
far side.
</p><p>"When I go, two of--"
</p><p>"I take it that you heard what was said to you, sir."
</p><p>At the sound of the intruding voice Hilton wheeled sharply. He faced
Tom Beck, who stood in the doorway, framed against the black night,
arms limp and rather awkwardly hanging at his sides, eyes dangerously
luminous; still, playing across them was that half amused look, as
though this were not in reality so serious a matter.
</p><p>For an interval there was no sound except Hilton's breathing: a sort of
hoarse gasp. The two men eyed each other and Jane, supporting her
suddenly weakened limbs by a hand on the table, looked from one to the
other.
</p><p>"What the devil are you doing here?" Dick asked heavily.
</p><p>"Just standin' quiet, waiting to open the gate for you when you ride
out."
</p><p>The Easterner braced his shoulders backward and sniffed.
</p><p>"And if I don't choose to ride out? What will you do then?"
</p><p>Beck looked at Jane slowly and his eyes danced.
</p><p>"It ain't necessary to talk about things that won't happen. You're
going to go."
</p><p>"Who the hell are you to be so certain?"
</p><p>"My name's Beck, sir. I'm just workin' here."
</p><p>"And playing the role of a protector?"
</p><p>"Well, nothing much ever comes up that I don't <u>try</u> to do."
</p><p>Hilton made as if to speak again but checked himself, walked down the
room in long strides, seized his coat, thrust his arms into the sleeves
viciously and stood buttoning the garment. Beck looked away into the
night as though nothing within interested him and Jane stood clutching
the locket at her throat, caressing it with her slim, nervous fingers.
</p><p>"Under the circumstances, making my farewells must be to the point,"
Hilton said. He spoke sharply, belligerently. "I have just this to say:
I am not through."
</p><p>"Oh, go!" moaned Jane, dropping into a chair and covering her face with
her hands.
</p><p>She heard the men leave the veranda, heard a gruff, low word from
Hilton and knew that he went on alone. After the outer gate had closed
she heard Tom walk slowly up the path toward the bunk house. He had
left her without comment, without any attempt at an expression of
concern or sympathy. She knew it was no oversight, but only a delicacy
which would not have been shown by many men.
</p><p>Her loathing was gone, her anger dead; the near past was a numb memory
and she looked up and about the room as though it were a strange place.
There, within those walls, she had experienced the rebirth, she had
felt ambition to stand alone come into full being, she had shaken off
the fetters with which the past had sought to hamper her....
</p><p>And now she was free, wholly free. The tentacle that had been reached
out to draw her back had been cast away. Tonight's renunciation had
burned the last bridge to that which had been; Dick Hilton, she
believed, would never again be an active influence in her life.
</p><p>She could not--perhaps fortunately--foretell how mistaken this belief
actually would prove to be. She did not know the intensity of a man's
jealousy, particularly when Fate has tricked him of his most valued
prize. Nor could she foresee those events which would impell her to
send for Hilton, to call him back, and the wells of misery which that
action would tap!
</p><p>To-night he was gone, and she was even strong enough to rise above
loathing and pity him for the failure he was. Just one fact of him
remained. Again she heard his ominous prediction, pronounced on his
first visit there: You cannot stand alone! You will fail! You will come
back to me!
</p><p>She knew, now, that she would never return to him, but there were other
possibilities as disastrous. Could she meet this new life and beat it
and make in it a place for herself? Was her faith in herself strong
enough to outride the defeat which very possibly confronted her?
</p><p>She did not know....
</p><p>Outside the rain drummed and the cottonwoods, now in full leaf, sighed
as the wind bowed their water weighted branches. She went to the window
and looked out, searching the darkness for movement. There was none but
he was not far away she knew....
</p><p>Her fingers again sought the locket and she lifted it quickly, holding
it pressed tightly against her mouth.
</p><p>"It's all there, locked up in a little gold disc!"
