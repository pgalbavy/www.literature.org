<p> The sailing-ship, when I knew her in her days of perfection,
was a sensible creature.  When I say her days of perfection, I
mean perfection of build, gear, seaworthy qualities and ease of
handling, not the perfection of speed.  That quality has departed
with the change of building material.  No iron ship of yesterday
ever attained the marvels of speed which the seamanship of men
famous in their time had obtained from their wooden, copper-sheeted
predecessors.  Everything had been done to make the iron ship
perfect, but no wit of man had managed to devise an efficient
coating composition to keep her bottom clean with the smooth cleanness
of yellow metal sheeting.  After a spell of a few weeks at sea,
an iron ship begins to lag as if she had grown tired too soon. 
It is only her bottom that is getting foul.  A very little affects
the speed of an iron ship which is not driven on by a merciless
propeller.  Often it is impossible to tell what inconsiderate
trifle puts her off her stride. A certain mysteriousness hangs
around the quality of speed as it was displayed by the old sailing-ships
commanded by a competent seaman.  In those days the speed depended
upon the seaman; therefore, apart from the laws, rules, and regulations
for the good preservation of his cargo, he was careful of his
loading,—or what is technically called the trim of his ship. 
Some ships sailed fast on an even keel, others had to be trimmed
quite one foot by the stern, and I have heard of a ship that gave
her best speed on a wind when so loaded as to float a couple of
inches by the head.</p>

<p>I call to mind a winter landscape in Amsterdam—a flat foreground
of waste land, with here and there stacks of timber, like the
huts of a camp of some very miserable tribe; the long stretch
of the Handelskade; cold, stone-faced quays, with the snow-sprinkled
ground and the hard, frozen water of the canal, in which were
set ships one behind another with their frosty mooring-ropes hanging
slack and their decks idle and deserted, because, as the master
stevedore (a gentle, pale person, with a few golden hairs on his
chin and a reddened nose) informed me, their cargoes were frozen-in
up-country on barges and schuyts.  In the distance, beyond the
waste ground, and running parallel with the line of ships, a line
of brown, warm-toned houses seemed bowed under snow-laden roofs. 
From afar at the end of Tsar Peter Straat, issued in the frosty
air the tinkle of bells of the horse tramcars, appearing and disappearing
in the opening between the buildings, like little toy carriages
harnessed with toy horses and played with by people that appeared
no bigger than children.</p>

<p>I was, as the French say, biting my fists with impatience for
that cargo frozen up-country; with rage at that canal set fast,
at the wintry and deserted aspect of all those ships that seemed
to decay in grim depression for want of the open water.  I was
chief mate, and very much alone.  Directly I had joined I received
from my owners instructions to send all the ship’s apprentices
away on leave together, because in such weather there was nothing
for anybody to do, unless to keep up a fire in the cabin stove. 
That was attended to by a snuffy and mop-headed, inconceivably
dirty, and weirdly toothless Dutch ship-keeper, who could hardly
speak three words of English, but who must have had some considerable
knowledge of the language, since he managed invariably to interpret
in the contrary sense everything that was said to him.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the little iron stove, the ink froze on the swing-table
in the cabin, and I found it more convenient to go ashore stumbling
over the arctic waste-land and shivering in glazed tramcars in
order to write my evening letter to my owners in a gorgeous café
in the centre of the town.  It was an immense place, lofty and
gilt, upholstered in red plush, full of electric lights and so
thoroughly warmed that even the marble tables felt tepid to the
touch.  The waiter who brought me my cup of coffee bore, by comparison
with my utter isolation, the dear aspect of an intimate friend. 
There, alone in a noisy crowd, I would write slowly a letter addressed
to Glasgow, of which the gist would be: There is no cargo, and
no prospect of any coming till late spring apparently.  And all
the time I sat there the necessity of getting back to the ship
bore heavily on my already half-congealed spirits—the shivering
in glazed tramcars, the stumbling over the snow-sprinkled waste
ground, the vision of ships frozen in a row, appearing vaguely
like corpses of black vessels in a white world, so silent, so
lifeless, so soulless they seemed to be.</p>

<p>With precaution I would go up the side of my own particular corpse,
and would feel her as cold as ice itself and as slippery under
my feet.  My cold berth would swallow up like a chilly burial
niche my bodily shivers and my mental excitement.  It was a cruel
winter.  The very air seemed as hard and trenchant as steel; but
it would have taken much more than this to extinguish my sacred
fire for the exercise of my craft.  No young man of twenty-four
appointed chief mate for the first time in his life would have
let that Dutch tenacious winter penetrate into his heart.  I think
that in those days I never forgot the fact of my elevation for
five consecutive minutes.  I fancy it kept me warm, even in my
slumbers, better than the high pile of blankets, which positively
crackled with frost as I threw them off in the morning.  And I
would get up early for no reason whatever except that I was in
sole charge.  The new captain had not been appointed yet.</p>

<p>Almost each morning a letter from my owners would arrive, directing
me to go to the charterers and clamour for the ship’s cargo; to
threaten them with the heaviest penalties of demurrage; to demand
that this assortment of varied merchandise, set fast in a landscape
of ice and windmills somewhere up-country, should be put on rail
instantly, and fed up to the ship in regular quantities every
day.  After drinking some hot coffee, like an Arctic explorer
setting off on a sledge journey towards the North Pole, I would
go ashore and roll shivering in a tramcar into the very heart
of the town, past clean-faced houses, past thousands of brass
knockers upon a thousand painted doors glimmering behind rows
of trees of the pavement species, leafless, gaunt, seemingly dead
for ever.</p>

<p>That part of the expedition was easy enough, though the horses
were painfully glistening with icicles, and the aspect of the
tram-conductors’ faces presented a repulsive blending of crimson
and purple.  But as to frightening or bullying, or even wheedling
some sort of answer out of Mr. Hudig, that was another matter
altogether.  He was a big, swarthy Netherlander, with black moustaches
and a bold glance.  He always began by shoving me into a chair
before I had time to open my mouth, gave me cordially a large
cigar, and in excellent English would start to talk everlastingly
about the phenomenal severity of the weather.  It was impossible
to threaten a man who, though he possessed the language perfectly,
seemed incapable of understanding any phrase pronounced in a tone
of remonstrance or discontent.  As to quarrelling with him, it
would have been stupid.  The weather was too bitter for that. 
His office was so warm, his fire so bright, his sides shook so
heartily with laughter, that I experienced always a great difficulty
in making up my mind to reach for my hat.</p>

<p>At last the cargo did come.  At first it came dribbling in by
rail in trucks, till the thaw set in; and then fast, in a multitude
of barges, with a great rush of unbound waters.  The gentle master
stevedore had his hands very full at last; and the chief mate
became worried in his mind as to the proper distribution of the
weight of his first cargo in a ship he did not personally know
before.</p>

<p>Ships do want humouring.  They want humouring in handling; and
if you mean to handle them well, they must have been humoured
in the distribution of the weight which you ask them to carry
through the good and evil fortune of a passage.  Your ship is
a tender creature, whose idiosyncrasies must be attended to if
you mean her to come with credit to herself and you through the
rough-and-tumble of her life.</p>
