<p><strong>TRANSLATOR'S NOTE</strong>
</p><pre>
      A zealous reader, collating the translation of this
      book with the original, would hit upon certain
      differences. These are due to alterations made, in
      most case, by the author himself, and, in all cases,
      with his full approval.
      A. T. DE M.
      CHELSEA, England, August, 1910.</pre>
