I could not have been unconscious more than a few seconds,
and yet I know that I was unconscious, for the next thing
I realized was that a growing radiance was illuminating
the corridor about me and the eyes were gone.
<P>
I was unharmed except for a slight bruise upon my forehead
where it had struck the stone flagging as I fell.
<P>
I sprang to my feet to ascertain the cause of the light.  It
came from a torch in the hand of one of a party of four green
warriors, who were coming rapidly down the corridor toward me.
They had not yet seen me, and so I lost no time in slipping
into the first intersecting corridor that I could find.
This time, however, I did not advance so far away from the
main corridor as on the other occasion that had resulted in
my losing Tars Tarkas and his guards.
<P>
The party came rapidly toward the opening of the passageway
in which I crouched against the wall.  As they passed by
I breathed a sigh of relief.  I had not been discovered, and,
best of all, the party was the same that I had followed into
the pits.  It consisted of Tars Tarkas and his three guards.
<P>
I fell in behind them and soon we were at the cell in which
the great Thark had been chained.  Two of the warriors remained
without while the man with the keys entered with the Thark
to fasten his irons upon him once more.  The two outside
started to stroll slowly in the direction of the spiral
runway which led to the floors above, and in a moment were
lost to view beyond a turn in the corridor.
<P>
The torch had been stuck in a socket beside the door, so
that its rays illuminated both the corridor and the cell at the
same time.  As I saw the two warriors disappear I approached the
entrance to the cell, with a well-defined plan already formulated.
<P>
While I disliked the thought of carrying out the thing that I
had decided upon, there seemed no alternative if Tars Tarkas
and I were to go back together to my little camp in the hills.
<P>
Keeping near the wall, I came quite close to the door to
Tars Tarkas' cell, and there I stood with my longsword above
my head, grasped with both hands, that I might bring it down
in one quick cut upon the skull of the jailer as he emerged.
<P>
I dislike to dwell upon what followed after I heard the
footsteps of the man as he approached the doorway.  It is
enough that within another minute or two, Tars Tarkas,
wearing the metal of a Warhoon chief, was hurrying down
the corridor toward the spiral runway, bearing the Warhoon's
torch to light his way.  A dozen paces behind him followed
John Carter, Prince of Helium.
<P>
The two companions of the man who lay now beside the
door of the cell that had been Tars Tarkas' had just started
to ascend the runway as the Thark came in view.
<P>
"Why so long, Tan Gama?" cried one of the men.
<P>
"I had trouble with a lock," replied Tars Tarkas.
"And now I find that I have left my short-sword in
the Thark's cell.  Go you on, I'll return and fetch it."
<P>
"As you will, Tan Gama," replied he who had before spoken.
"We shall see you above directly."
<P>
"Yes," replied Tars Tarkas, and turned as though to retrace
his steps to the cell, but he only waited until the two
had disappeared at the floor above.  Then I joined him, we
extinguished the torch, and together we crept toward the
spiral incline that led to the upper floors of the building.
<P>
At the first floor we found that the hallway ran but halfway
through, necessitating the crossing of a rear room full of
green folk, ere we could reach the inner courtyard, so there
was but one thing left for us to do, and that was to gain the
second floor and the hallway through which I had traversed
the length of the building.
<P>
Cautiously we ascended.  We could hear the sounds of
conversation coming from the room above, but the hall still
was unlighted, nor was any one in sight as we gained the top
of the runway.  Together we threaded the long hall and reached
the balcony overlooking the courtyard, without being detected.
<P>
At our right was the window letting into the room in which I
had seen Tan Gama and the other warriors as they started to
Tars Tarkas' cell earlier in the evening.  His companions had
returned here, and we now overheard a portion of their conversation.
<P>
"What can be detaining Tan Gama?" asked one.
<P>
"He certainly could not be all this time fetching his shortsword
from the Thark's cell," spoke another.
<P>
"His short-sword?" asked a woman.  "What mean you?"
<P>
"Tan Gama left his short-sword in the Thark's cell," explained the
first speaker, "and left us at the runway, to return and get it."
<P>
"Tan Gama wore no short-sword this night," said the
woman.  "It was broken in to-day's battle with the Thark,
and Tan Gama gave it to me to repair.  See, I have it here,"
and as she spoke she drew Tan Gama's short-sword from
beneath her sleeping silks and furs.
<P>
The warriors sprang to their feet.
<P>
"There is something amiss here," cried one.
<P>
"'Tis even what I myself thought when Tan Gama left
us at the runway," said another.  "Methought then that his
voice sounded strangely."
<P>
"Come! let us hasten to the pits."
<P>
We waited to hear no more.  Slinging my harness into a
long single strap, I lowered Tars Tarkas to the courtyard
beneath, and an instant later dropped to his side.
<P>
We had spoken scarcely a dozen words since I had felled
Tan Gama at the cell door and seen in the torch's light the
expression of utter bewilderment upon the great Thark's face.
<P>
"By this time," he had said, "I should have learned to wonder
at nothing which John Carter accomplishes."  That was all.
He did not need to tell me that he appreciated the friendship
which had prompted me to risk my life to rescue him, nor did
he need to say that he was glad to see me.
<P>
This fierce green warrior had been the first to greet me
that day, now twenty years gone, which had witnessed my
first advent upon Mars.  He had met me with levelled spear
and cruel hatred in his heart as he charged down upon me,
bending low at the side of his mighty thoat as I stood beside
the incubator of his horde upon the dead sea bottom beyond Korad.
And now among the inhabitants of two worlds I counted none a
better friend than Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of the Tharks.
<P>
As we reached the courtyard we stood in the shadows beneath
the balcony for a moment to discuss our plans.
<P>
"There be five now in the party, Tars Tarkas," I said;
"Thuvia, Xodar, Carthoris, and ourselves.  We shall need five
thoats to bear us."
<P>
"Carthoris!" he cried.  "Your son?"
<P>
"Yes.  I found him in the prison of Shador, on the Sea of
Omean, in the land of the First Born."
<P>
"I know not any of these places, John Carter.  Be they
upon Barsoom?"
<P>
"Upon and below, my friend; but wait until we shall have made
good our escape, and you shall hear the strangest narrative
that ever a Barsoomian of the outer world gave ear to.
Now we must steal our thoats and be well away to the north
before these fellows discover how we have tricked them."
<P>
In safety we reached the great gates at the far end of the
courtyard, through which it was necessary to take our
thoats to the avenue beyond.  It is no easy matter to handle
five of these great, fierce beasts, which by nature are as wild
and ferocious as their masters and held in subjection by
cruelty and brute force alone.
<P>
As we approached them they sniffed our unfamiliar scent
and with squeals of rage circled about us.  Their long,
massive necks upreared raised their great, gaping mouths
high above our heads.  They are fearsome appearing brutes at
best, but when they are aroused they are fully as dangerous
as they look.  The thoat stands a good ten feet at the shoulder. 
His hide is sleek and hairless, and of a dark slate colour
on back and sides, shading down his eight legs to a vivid
yellow at the huge, padded, nailless feet; the belly is pure
white.  A broad, flat tail, larger at the tip than at the root,
completes the picture of this ferocious green Martian mount
--a fit war steed for these warlike people.
<P>
As the thoats are guided by telepathic means alone, there
is no need for rein or bridle, and so our object now was to
find two that would obey our unspoken commands.  As they
charged about us we succeeded in mastering them sufficiently
to prevent any concerted attack upon us, but the din of
their squealing was certain to bring investigating warriors
into the courtyard were it to continue much longer.
<P>
At length I was successful in reaching the side of one
great brute, and ere he knew what I was about I was firmly
seated astride his glossy back.  A moment later Tars Tarkas
had caught and mounted another, and then between us we
herded three or four more toward the great gates.
<P>
Tars Tarkas rode ahead and, leaning down to the latch,
threw the barriers open, while I held the loose thoats from
breaking back to the herd.  Then together we rode through
into the avenue with our stolen mounts and, without waiting
to close the gates, hurried off toward the southern boundary
of the city.
<P>
Thus far our escape had been little short of marvellous,
nor did our good fortune desert us, for we passed the outer
purlieus of the dead city and came to our camp without hearing
even the faintest sound of pursuit.
<P>
Here a low whistle, the prearranged signal, apprised the balance
of our party that I was returning, and we were met by the three
with every manifestation of enthusiastic rejoicing.
<P>
But little time was wasted in narration of our adventure.
Tars Tarkas and Carthoris exchanged the dignified and
formal greetings common upon Barsoom, but I could tell
intuitively that the Thark loved my boy and that Carthoris
reciprocated his affection.
<P>
Xodar and the green Jeddak were formally presented to
each other.  Then Thuvia was lifted to the least fractious
thoat, Xodar and Carthoris mounted two others, and we set
out at a rapid pace toward the east.  At the far extremity
of the city we circled toward the north, and under the
glorious rays of the two moons we sped noiselessly across
the dead sea bottom, away from the Warhoons and the First
Born, but to what new dangers and adventures we knew not.
<P>
Toward noon of the following day we halted to rest our
mounts and ourselves.  The beasts we hobbled, that they
might move slowly about cropping the ochre moss-like
vegetation which constitutes both food and drink for them
on the march.  Thuvia volunteered to remain on watch while
the balance of the party slept for an hour.
<P>
It seemed to me that I had but closed my eyes when I
felt her hand upon my shoulder and heard her soft voice
warning me of a new danger.
<P>
"Arise, O Prince," she whispered.  "There be that behind
us which has the appearance of a great body of pursuers."
<P>
The girl stood pointing in the direction from whence we
had come, and as I arose and looked, I, too, thought that
I could detect a thin dark line on the far horizon.  I awoke
the others.  Tars Tarkas, whose giant stature towered high
above the rest of us, could see the farthest.
<P>
"It is a great body of mounted men," he said, "and they
are travelling at high speed."
<P>
There was no time to be lost.  We sprang to our hobbled
thoats, freed them, and mounted.  Then we turned our faces
once more toward the north and took our flight again at the
highest speed of our slowest beast.
<P>
For the balance of the day and all the following night we
raced across that ochre wilderness with the pursuers at
our back ever gaining upon us.  Slowly but surely they were
lessening the distance between us.  Just before dark they had
been close enough for us to plainly distinguish that they were
green Martians, and all during the long night we distinctly
heard the clanking of their accoutrements behind us.
<P>
As the sun rose on the second day of our flight it disclosed
the pursuing horde not a half-mile in our rear.  As they saw
us a fiendish shout of triumph rose from their ranks.
<P>
Several miles in advance lay a range of hills--the farther
shore of the dead sea we had been crossing.  Could we but
reach these hills our chances of escape would be greatly
enhanced, but Thuvia's mount, although carrying the lightest
burden, already was showing signs of exhaustion.  I was
riding beside her when suddenly her animal staggered and
lurched against mine.  I saw that he was going down, but
ere he fell I snatched the girl from his back and swung her
to a place upon my own thoat, behind me, where she clung
with her arms about me.
<P>
This double burden soon proved too much for my already
overtaxed beast, and thus our speed was terribly diminished,
for the others would proceed no faster than the slowest of
us could go.  In that little party there was not one who would
desert another; yet we were of different countries, different
colours, different races, different religions--and one of us
was of a different world.
<P>
We were quite close to the hills, but the Warhoons were
gaining so rapidly that we had given up all hope of reaching
them in time.  Thuvia and I were in the rear, for our beast
was lagging more and more.  Suddenly I felt the girl's warm
lips press a kiss upon my shoulder.  "For thy sake, O my
Prince," she murmured.  Then her arms slipped from about
my waist and she was gone.
<P>
I turned and saw that she had deliberately slipped to the
ground in the very path of the cruel demons who pursued
us, thinking that by lightening the burden of my mount it
might thus be enabled to bear me to the safety of the hills.
Poor child!  She should have known John Carter better than that.
<P>
Turning my thoat, I urged him after her, hoping to reach
her side and bear her on again in our hopeless flight. 
Carthoris must have glanced behind him at about the same time
and taken in the situation, for by the time I had reached
Thuvia's side he was there also, and, springing from his
mount, he threw her upon its back and, turning the animal's
head toward the hills, gave the beast a sharp crack across
the rump with the flat of his sword.  Then he attempted to
do the same with mine.
<P>
The brave boy's act of chivalrous self-sacrifice filled me
with pride, nor did I care that it had wrested from us our
last frail chance for escape.  The Warhoons were now close
upon us.  Tars Tarkas and Xodar had discovered our absence
and were charging rapidly to our support.  Everything pointed
toward a splendid ending of my second journey to Barsoom.
I hated to go out without having seen my divine Princess, and
held her in my arms once again; but if it were not writ upon
the book of Fate that such was to be, then would I take the
most that was coming to me, and in these last few moments
that were to be vouchsafed me before I passed over into that
unguessed future I could at least give such an account of
myself in my chosen vocation as would leave the Warhoons of
the South food for discourse for the next twenty generations.
<P>
As Carthoris was not mounted, I slipped from the back of
my own mount and took my place at his side to meet the
charge of the howling devils bearing down upon us.  A
moment later Tars Tarkas and Xodar ranged themselves on
either hand, turning their thoats loose that we might all
be on an equal footing.
<P>
The Warhoons were perhaps a hundred yards from us when a
loud explosion sounded from above and behind us, and almost
at the same instant a shell burst in their advancing ranks.
At once all was confusion.  A hundred warriors toppled
to the ground.  Riderless thoats plunged hither and
thither among the dead and dying.  Dismounted warriors were
trampled underfoot in the stampede which followed.  All
semblance of order had left the ranks of the green men, and
as they looked far above our heads to trace the origin of this
unexpected attack, disorder turned to retreat and retreat to a
wild panic.  In another moment they were racing as madly
away from us as they had before been charging down upon us.
<P>
We turned to look in the direction from whence the first
report had come, and there we saw, just clearing the tops of
the nearer hills, a great battleship swinging majestically
through the air.  Her bow gun spoke again even as we looked,
and another shell burst among the fleeing Warhoons.
<P>
As she drew nearer I could not repress a wild cry of elation,
for upon her bows I saw the device of Helium.
