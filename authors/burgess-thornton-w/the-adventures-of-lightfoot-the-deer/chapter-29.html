<p>It was the evening of the day after the closing of the hunting
season for Lightfoot the Deer. Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had gone
to bed behind the Purple Hills, and the Black Shadows had crept
out across the Big River. Mr. and Mrs. Quack were getting their
evening meal among the brown stalks of the wild rice along the
edge of the Big River. They took turns in searching for the rice
grains in the mud. While Mrs. Quack tipped up and seemed to stand
on her head as she searched in the mud for rice, Mr. Quack kept
watch for possible danger. Then Mrs. Quack took her turn at keeping
watch, while Mr. Quack stood on his head and hunted for rice.</p>

<p>It was wonderfully quiet and peaceful. There was not even a ripple
on the Big River. It was so quiet that they could hear the barking
of a dog at a farmhouse a mile away. They were far enough out
from the bank to have nothing to fear from Reddy Fox or Old Man
Coyote. So they had nothing to fear from any one save Hooty the
Owl. It was for Hooty that they took turns in watching. It was
just the hour when Hooty likes best to hunt.</p>

<p>By and by they heard Hooty's hunting call. It was far away in
the Green Forest. Then Mr. and Mrs. Quack felt easier, and they
talked in low, contented voices. They felt that for a while at
least there was nothing to fear.</p>

<p>Suddenly a little splash out in the Big River caught Mr. Quack's
quick ear. As Mrs. Quack brought her head up out of the water,
Mr. Quack warned her to keep quiet. Noiselessly they swam among
the brown stalks until they could see out across the Big River.
There was another little splash out there in the middle. It wasn't
the splash made by a fish; it was a splash made by something much
bigger than any fish. Presently they made out a silver line moving
towards them from the Black Shadows. They knew exactly what it
meant. It meant that some one was out there in the Big River moving
towards them. Could it be a boat containing a hunter?</p>

<p>With their necks stretched high, Mr. and Mrs. Quack watched.
They were ready to take to their strong wings the instant they
discovered danger. But they did not want to fly until they were
sure that it <em>was</em> danger approaching. They were startled,
very much startled.</p>

<p>Presently they made out what looked like the branch of a tree
moving over the water towards them. That was queer, very queer.
Mr. Quack said so. Mrs. Quack said so. Both were growing more
and more suspicious. They couldn't understand it at all, and it
is always best to be suspicious of things you cannot understand.
Mr. and Mrs. Quack half lifted their wings to fly.</p>
