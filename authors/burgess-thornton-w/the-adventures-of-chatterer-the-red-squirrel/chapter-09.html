<p>Everybody knows how curious Peter Rabbit is. He is forever poking
his wobbly little nose in where it has no business to be, and
as a result Peter is forever getting into trouble. Whenever Chatterer
the Red Squirrel has heard a new story about Peter and the scrapes
his curiosity has got him into, Chatterer has said that Peter
got no more than he deserved. As for himself, he might be curious
about a thing he saw for the first time, but he had too much sense
to meddle with it until he knew all about it. So Chatterer has
come to be thought very smart, quite too smart to be caught in
a trap&mdash;at least to be caught in an ordinary trap.</p>

<p>Now a great many people manage to make their neighbors think
they are a great deal smarter than they really are, and Chatterer
is one of this kind. If some of his neighbors could have peeped
into Farmer Brown's corn-crib the morning after Farmer Brown's
boy found the telltale corn-cob so carelessly dropped by Chatterer,
they would have been surprised. Yes, Sir, they would have been
surprised. They would have seen Chatterer the Red Squirrel, the
boaster, he of the sharp wits, showing quite as much curiosity
as ever possessed Peter Rabbit.</p>

<p>Chatterer had come over to the corn-crib as usual to get his
daily supply of corn. As usual, he had raced about over the great
pile of yellow corn. Quite suddenly his sharp eyes spied something
that they hadn't seen before. It was down on the floor of the
corn-crib quite near the door. Chatterer was sure that it hadn't
been there the day before. It was a very queer looking thing,
very queer indeed. And then he spied another queer looking thing
near it, only this was very much smaller. What could they be?
He looked at them suspiciously. They looked harmless enough. They
didn't move. He ran a few steps towards them and scolded, just
as he scolds at anything new he finds out of doors. Still they
didn't move. He ran around on a little ledge where he could look
right down on the queer things. He was sure now that they were
not alive. The biggest one he could see all through. Inside was
something to eat. The littlest thing was round and flat with funny
bits of wire on top. It looked as if it were made of wood, and
in the sides were little round holes too small for him to put
his head through.</p>

<p>"Leave them alone," said a small voice inside of Chatterer.</p>

<p>"But I want to see what they are and find out all about them,"
said Chatterer.</p>

<p>"No good ever comes of meddling with things you don't know about,"
said the small voice.</p>

<p>"But they are such queer looking things, and they're not alive.
They can't hurt me," said Chatterer.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he ran back to the pile of corn and tried to eat.
Somehow he had lost his appetite. He couldn't take his eyes off
those two queer things down on the floor.</p>

<p>"Better keep away," warned the small voice inside.</p>

<p>"It won't do any harm to have a closer look at them," said Chatterer.</p>

<p>So once more he scrambled down from the pile of corn and little
by little drew nearer to the two queer things. The nearer he got,
the more harmless they looked. Finally he reached out and smelled
of the smallest. Then he turned up his nose.</p>

<p>"Smells of mice," muttered Chatterer, "just common barn mice."
Then he reached out a paw and touched it. "Pooh!" said he, "it's
nothing to be afraid of." Just then he touched one of the little
wires, and there was a sudden snap. It frightened Chatterer so
that he scurried away. But he couldn't stay away. That snap was
such a funny thing, and it hadn't done any harm. You see, he hadn't
put his paw in at one of the little holes, or it might have done
some harm.</p>

<p>Pretty soon he was back again, meddling with those little wires
on top. Every once in a while there would be a snap, and he would
scamper away. It was very scary and great fun. By and by the thing
wouldn't snap any more, and then Chatterer grew tired of his queer
plaything and began to wonder about the other queer thing. No
harm had come from the first one, and so he was sure no harm could
come from the other.</p>
