<p>At seven o'clock on the last morning of that month, Sheridan,
passing through the upper hall on his way to descend the stairs
for breakfast, found a couple of scribbled sheets of note-paper
lying on the floor. A window had been open in Bibbs's room the
evening before; he had left his note-book on the sill&mdash;and the
sheets were loose. The door was open, and when Bibbs came in and
closed it, he did not notice that the two sheets had blown out
into the hall. Sheridan recognized the handwriting and put the
sheets in his coat pocket, intending to give them to George or
Jackson for return to the owner, but he forgot and carried them
down-town with him. At noon he found himself alone in his office,
and, having a little leisure, remembered the bits of manuscript,
took them out, and glanced at them. A glance was enough to reveal
that they were not epistolary. Sheridan would not have read a
"private letter" that came into his possession in that way, though
in a "matter of business"  he might have felt it his duty to take
advantage of an opportunity afforded in any manner whatsoever.
Having satisfied himself that Bibbs's scribblings were only a
sample of the kind of writing his son preferred to the machine-shop,
he decided, innocently enough, that he would be justified in reading
them.</p>

<p>  It appears that a lady will nod pleasantly upon some windy  
generalization of a companion, and will wear the most agreeable  
expression of accepting it as the law, and then&mdash;days afterward,  
when the thing is a mummy to its promulgator&mdash;she will inquire
out   of a clear sky:  "<em>WHY </em>did you say that the people
down-town have   nothing in life that a chicken hasn't?  What
did you mean?"  And she   may say it in a manner that makes a
sensible reply very difficult   &mdash;you will be so full of wonder
that she remembered so seriously.</p>

<p>  Yet, what does the rooster lack?  He has food and shelter;
he is   warm in winter; his wives raise not one fine family for
him, but   dozens.  He has a clear sky over him; he breathes sweet
air; he   walks in his April orchard under a roof of flowers. 
He must die,   violently perhaps, but quickly.  Is Midas's cancer
a better way?   The rooster's wives and children must die.  Are
those of Midas   immortal?  His life is shorter than the life
of Midas, but Midas's   life is only a sixth as long as that of
the Galapagos tortoise.</p>

<p>  The worthy money-worker takes his vacation so that he may refresh  
himself anew for the hard work of getting nothing that the rooster  
doesn't get.  The office-building has an elevator, the rooster  
flies up to the bough.  Midas has a machine to take him to his
work;   the rooster finds his worm underfoot.  The "business man"
feels   a pressure sometimes, without knowing why, and sits late
at wine   after the day's labor; next morning he curses his head
because it   interferes with the work&mdash;he swears never to relieve
that pressure   again.  The rooster has no pressure and no wine;
this difference is   in his favor.</p>

<p>  The rooster is a dependent; he depends upon the farmer and
the   weather.  Midas is a dependent; he depends upon the farmer
and the   weather.  The rooster thinks only of the moment; Midas
provides for   to-morrow.  What does he provide for to-morrow? 
Nothing that the   rooster will not have without providing.</p>

<p>  The rooster and the prosperous worker:  they are born, they
grub,   they love; they grub and love grubbing; they grub and
they die.   Neither knows beauty; neither knows knowledge.  And
after all, when   Midas dies and the rooster dies, there is one
thing Midas has had   and rooster has not.  Midas has had the
excitement of accumulating   what he has grubbed, and that has
been his life and his love and   his god.  He cannot take that
god with him when he dies.  I wonder   if the worthy gods are
those we can take with us.</p>

<p>  Midas must teach all to be as Midas; the young must be raised
in   his religion&mdash;</p>

<p>The manuscript ended there, and Sheridan was not anxious for
more. He crumpled the sheets into a ball, depositing it (with
vigor) in a waste-basket beside him; then, rising, he consulted
a Cyclopedia of Names, which a book-agent had somehow sold to
him years before; a volume now first put to use for the location
of "Midas." Having read the legend, Sheridan walked up and down
the spacious office, exhaling the breath of contempt. "Dam' fool!"
he mumbled. But this was no new thought, nor was the contrariness
of Bibbs's notes a surpise to him; and presently he dismissed
the matter from his mind.</p>

<p>He felt very lonely, and this was, daily, his hardest hour. For
a long time he and Jim had lunched together habitually. Roscoe
preferred a club luncheon, but Jim and his father almost always
went to a small restaurant near the Sheridan Building, where they
spent twenty minutes in the consumption of food, and twenty in
talk, with cigars. Jim came for his father every day, at five
minutes after twelve, and Sheridan was again in his office at
five minutes before one. But now that Jim no longer came, Sheridan
remained alone in his office; he had not gone out to lunch since
Jim's death, nor did he have anything sent to him&mdash;he fasted until
evening.</p>

<p>It was the time he missed Jim personally the most&mdash;the voice
and eyes and handshake, all brisk and alert, all business-like.
But these things were not the keenest in Sheridan's grief; his
sense of loss went far deeper. Roscoe was dependable, a steady
old wheel-horse, and that was a great comfort; but it was in Jim
that Sheridan had most happily perceived his own likeness. Jim
was the one who would have been surest to keep the great property
growing greater, year by year. Sheridan had fallen asleep, night
after night, picturing what the growth would be under Jim. He
had believed that Jim was absolutely certain to be one of the
biggest men in the country. Well, it was all up to Roscoe now!</p>

<p>That reminded him of a question he had in mind to ask Roscoe.
It was a question Sheridan considered of no present importance,
but his wife had suggested it&mdash;though vaguely&mdash;and he had meant
to speak to Roscoe about it. However, Roscoe had not come into
his father's office for several days, and when Sheridan had seen
his son at home there had been no opportunity.</p>

<p>He waited until the greater part of his day's work was over,
toward four o'clock, and then went down to Roscoe's office, which
was on a lower floor. He found several men waiting for business
interviews in an outer room of the series Roscoe occupied; and
he supposed that he would find his son busy with others, and that
his question would have to be postponed, but when he entered the
door marked "R. C. Sheridan. Private," Roscoe was there alone.</p>

<p>He was sitting with his back to the door, his feet on a window-sill,
and he did not turn as his father opened the door.</p>

<p>"Some pretty good men out there waitin' to see you, my boy,"
said Sheridan. "What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," Roscoe answered indistinctly, not moving.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess that's all right, too. I let 'em wait sometimes
myself! I just wanted to ask you a question, but I expect it'll
keep, if you're workin' something out in your mind!"</p>

<p>Roscoe made no reply; and his father, who had turned to the door,
paused with his hand on the knob, staring curiously at the motionless
figure in the chair. Usually the son seemed pleased and eager
when he came to the office. "You're all right, ain't you?" said
Sheridan. "Not sick, are you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Sheridan was puzzled; then, abruptly, he decided to ask his question.
"I wanted to talk to you about that young Lamhorn," he said. "I
guess your mother thinks he's comin' to see Edith pretty often,
and you known him longer'n any of us, so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't," said Roscoe, thickly&mdash;"I won't say a dam' thing about
him!"</p>

<p>Sheridan uttered an exclamation and walked quickly to a position
near the window where he could see his son's face. Roscoe's eyes
were bloodshot and vacuous; his hair was disordered, his mouth
was distorted, and he was deathly pale. The father stood aghast.</p>

<p>"By George!" he muttered. "<em>ROSCOE</em>!"</p>

<p>"My name," said Roscoe. "Can' help that."</p>

<p>"<em>ROSCOE!" </em>Blank astonishment was Sheridan's first sensation.
Probably nothing in the world could have more amazed his than
to find Roscoe&mdash;the steady old wheel-horse&mdash;in this condition.
"How'd you <em>GET </em>this way?" he demanded. "You caught cold
and took too much for it?"</p>

<p>For reply Roscoe laughed hoarsely. "Yeuh! Cold! I been drinkun
all time, lately. Firs' you notice it?"</p>

<p>"By George!" cried Sheridan. "I <em>THOUGHT I'</em>d smelt it
on you a good deal lately, but I wouldn't 'a' believed you'd take
more'n was good for you. Boh! To see you like a common hog!"</p>

<p>Roscoe chuckled and threw out his right arm in a meaningless
gesture. "Hog!" he repeated, chuckling.</p>

<p>"Yes, a hog!" said Sheridan, angrily. "In business hours! I don't
object to anybody's takin' a drink if you wants to, out o' business
hours; nor, if a man keeps his work right up to the scratch, I
wouldn't be the one to baste him if he got good an' drunk once
in two, three years, maybe. It ain't MY way. I let it alone, but
I never believed in forcin' my way on a grown-up son in moral
matters. I guess I was wrong! You think them men out there are
waitin' to talk business with a drunkard? You think you can come
to your office and do business drunk? By George! I wonder how
often this has been happening and me not on to it! I'll have a
look over your books to-morrow, and I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>Roscoe stumbled to his feet, laughing wildly, and stood swaying,
contriving to hold himself in position by clutching the back of
the heavy chair in which he had been sitting.</p>

<p>"Hoo&mdash;hoorah!" he cried. "'S my principles, too. Be drunkard
all you want to&mdash;outside business hours. Don' for Gossake le'n'thing
innerfere business hours! Business! Thassit! You're right, father.
Drink! Die! L'everything go to hell, but <em>DON' </em>let innerfere
business!"</p>

<p>Sheridan had seized the telephone upon Roscoe's desk, and was
calling his own office, overhead. "Abercrombie? Come down to my
son Roscoe's suite and get rid of some gentlemen that are waitin'
there to see him in room two-fourteen. There's Maples and Schirmer
and a couple o' fellows on the Kinsey business. Tell 'em something's
come up I have to go over with Roscoe, and tell 'em to come back
day after to-morrow at two. You needn't come in to let me know
they're gone; we don't want to be disturbed. Tell Pauly to call
my house and send Claus down here with a closed car. We may have
to go out. Tell him to hustle, and call me at Roscoe's room as
soon as the car gets here. 'T's all!"</p>

<p>Roscoe had laughed bitterly throughout this monologue. "Drunk
in business hours! Thass awf'l! Mus'n' do such thing! Mus'n' get
drunk, mus'n' gamble, mus'n' kill 'nybody&mdash;not in business hours!
All right any other time. Kill 'nybody you want to&mdash;'s long 'tain't
in business hours! Fine! Mus'n' have any trouble 't'll innerfere
business. Keep your trouble 't home. Don' bring it to th' office.
Might innerfere business! Have funerals on Sunday&mdash;might innerfere
business! Don' let your wife innerfere business! Keep all, all,
<em>ALL </em>your trouble an' your meanness, an' your trad&mdash;your
tradegy&mdash;keep 'em <em>ALL </em>for home use! If you got die, go
on die 't home&mdash;don' die round th' office! Might innerfere business!"</p>

<p>Sheridan picked up a newspaper from Roscoe's desk, and sat down
with his back to his son, affecting to read. Roscoe seemed to
be unaware of his father's significant posture.</p>

<p>"You know wh' I think?" he went on. "I think Bibbs only one the
fam'ly any 'telligence at all. Won' work, an' di'n' get married.
Jim worked, an' he got killed. I worked, an' I got married. Look
at me! Jus' look at me, I ask you. Fine 'dustriss young business
man. Look whass happen' to me! Fine!" He lifted his hand from
the sustaining chair in a deplorable gesture, and, immediately
losing his balance, fell across the chair and caromed to the floor
with a crash, remaining prostrate for several minutes, during
which Sheridan did not relax his apparent attention to the newspaper.
He did not even look round at the sound of Roscoe's fall.</p>

<p>Roscoe slowly climbed to an upright position, pulling himself
up by holding to the chair. He was slightly sobered outwardly,
having progressed in the prostrate interval to a state of befuddlement
less volatile. He rubbed his dazed eyes with the back of his left
hand.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what you ask me while ago?" he said.</p>

<p>"Nothin'."</p>

<p>"Yes, you did. What&mdash;what was it?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'. You better sit down."</p>

<p>"You ask' me what I thought about Lamhorn. You did ask me that.
Well, I won't tell you. I won't say dam' word 'bout him!"</p>

<p>The telephone-bell tinkled. Sheridan placed the receiver to his
ear and said, "Right down." Then he got Roscoe's coat and hat
from a closet and brought them to his son. "Get into this coat,"
he said. "You're goin' home."</p>

<p>"All ri'," Roscoe murmured, obediently.</p>

<p>They went out into the main hall by a side door, not passing
through the outer office; and Sheridan waited for an empty elevator,
stopped it, and told the operator to take on no more passengers
until they reached the ground floor. Roscoe walked out of the
building and got into the automobile without lurching, and twenty
minutes later walked into his own house in the same manner, neither
he nor his father having spoken a word in the interval.</p>

<p>Sheridan did not go in with him; he went home, and to his own
room without meeting any of his family. But as he passed Bibbs's
door he heard from within the sound of a cheerful young voice
humming jubilant fragments of song:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>WHO </em>looks a mustang in the eye?...<br/>
With a leap from the ground<br/>
To the saddle in a bound.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And away&mdash;and away!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi-yay!

</p>
</div>
<p>It was the first time in Sheridan's life that he had ever detected
any musical symptom whatever in Bibbs&mdash;he had never even heard
him whistle&mdash;and it seemed the last touch of irony that the useless
fool should be merry to-day.</p>

<p>To Sheridan it was Tom o' Bedlam singing while the house burned;
and he did not tarry to enjoy the melody, but went into his own
room and locked the door.</p>
