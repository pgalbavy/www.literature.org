<P>Whilst the wax-lights were burning in the castle of Blois,
around the inanimate body of Gaston of Orleans, that last
representative of the past; whilst the bourgeois of the city
were thinking out his epitaph, which was far from being a
panegyric; whilst madame the dowager, no longer remembering
that in her young days she had loved that senseless corpse
to such a degree as to fly the paternal palace for his sake,
was making, within twenty paces of the funeral apartment,
her little calculations of interest and her little
sacrifices of pride; other interests and other prides were
in agitation in all the parts of the castle into which a
living soul could penetrate. Neither the lugubrious sounds
of the bells, nor the voices of the chanters, nor the
splendor of the waxlights through the windows, nor the
preparations for the funeral, had power to divert the
attention of two persons, placed at a window of the interior
court  - -a window that we are acquainted with, and which
lighted a chamber forming part of what were called the
little apartments. For the rest, a joyous beam of the sun,
for the sun appeared to care little for the loss France had
just suffered; a sunbeam, we say, descended upon them,
drawing perfumes from the neighboring flowers, and animating
the walls themselves. These two persons, so occupied, not by
the death of the duke, but by the conversation which was the
consequence of that death, were a young woman and a young
man. The latter personage, a man of from twenty-five to
twenty-six years of age, with a mien sometimes lively and
sometimes dull, making good use of two large eyes, shaded
with long eye-lashes, was short of stature and swart of
skin; he smiled with an enormous, but well-furnished mouth,
and his pointed chin, which appeared to enjoy a mobility
nature does not ordinarily grant to that portion of the
countenance, leant from time to time very lovingly towards
his interlocutrix, who, we must say did not always draw back
so rapidly as strict propriety had a right to require. The
young girl  -  we know her, for we have already seen her, at
that very same window by the light of that same sun  -  the
young girl presented a singular mixture of shyness and
reflection; she was charming when she laughed, beautiful
when she became serious; but, let us hasten to say, she was
more frequently charming than beautiful. These two appeared
to have attained the culminating point of a discussion  - 
half-bantering, half-serious.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, Monsieur Malicorne,&quot; said the young girl, &quot;does it, at
length, please you that we should talk reasonably?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You believe that that is very easy, Mademoiselle Aure,&quot;
replied the young man. &quot;To do what we like, when we can only
do what we are able  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good! there he is bewildered in his phrases.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who, I?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, you quit that lawyer's logic, my dear.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Another impossibility. Clerk I am, Mademoiselle de
Montalais.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Demoiselle I am, Monsieur Malicorne.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Alas, I know it well, and you overwhelm me by your rank; so
I will say no more to you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, no, I don't overwhelm you; say what you have to tell
me  -  say- it, I insist upon it.&quot;</P>
<P>Well, I obey you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is truly fortunate.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur is dead.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, peste! there's news! And where do you come from, to be
able to tell us that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I come from Orleans, mademoiselle.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And is that all the news you bring?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, no; I am come to tell you that Madame Henrietta of
England is coming to marry the king's brother.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed, Malicorne, you are insupportable with your news of
the last century. Now, mind, if you persist in this bad
habit of laughing at people, I will have you turned out.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; for really you exasperate me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There, there. Patience, mademoiselle.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You want to make yourself of consequence; I know well
enough why. Go!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tell me, and I will answer you frankly, yes, if the thing
be true.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You know that I am anxious to have that commission of lady
of honor, which I have been foolish enough to ask of you,
and you do not use your credit.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who, I?&quot; Malicorne cast down his eyes, joined his hands,
and assumed his sullen air. &quot;And what credit can the poor
clerk of a procurer have, pray?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your father has not twenty thousand livres a year for
nothing, M. Malicorne.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A provincial fortune, Mademoiselle de Montalais.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your father is not in the secrets of monsieur le prince for
nothing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;An advantage which is confined to lending monseigneur
money.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In a word, you are not the most cunning young fellow in the
province for nothing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You flatter me &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who, I?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Since I maintain that I have no credit, and you maintain I
have.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then,  -  my commission?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well,  -  your commission?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Shall I have it, or shall I not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You shall have it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ay, but when?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When you like.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Where is it, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In my pocket.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How  -  in your pocket?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>And, with a smile, Malicorne drew from his pocket a letter,
upon which mademoiselle seized as a prey, and which she read
eagerly. As she read, her face brightened.</P>
<P>&quot;Malicorne,&quot; cried she, after having read it, &quot;in truth, you
are a good lad.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What for, mademoiselle?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because you might have been paid for this commission, and
you have not.&quot; And she burst into a loud laugh, thinking to
put the clerk out of countenance; but Malicorne sustained
the attack bravely.</P>
<P>&quot;I do not understand you,&quot; said he. It was now Montalais who
was disconcerted in her turn. &quot;I have declared my sentiments
to you,&quot; continued Malicorne. &quot;You have told me three times,
laughing all the while, that you did not love me; you have
embraced me once without laughing, and that is all I want.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All?&quot; said the proud and coquettish Montalais, in a tone
through which wounded pride was visible.</P>
<P>&quot;Absolutely all, mademoiselle,&quot; replied Malicorne.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah!&quot;  -  And this monosyllable indicated as much anger as
the young man might have expected gratitude. He shook his
head quietly.</P>
<P>&quot;Listen, Montalais,&quot; said he, without heeding whether that
familiarity pleased his mistress or not; &quot;let us not dispute
about it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And why not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because during the year which I have known you, you might
have had me turned out of doors twenty times if I did not
please you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed; and on what account should I have had you turned
out?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because I had been sufficiently impertinent for that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, that,  -  yes, that's true.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You see plainly that you are forced to avow it,&quot; said
Malicorne.</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur Malicorne!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't let us be angry; if you have retained me, then it has
not been without cause.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is not, at least, because I love you,&quot; cried Montalais.</P>
<P>&quot;Granted. I will even say that, at this moment, I am certain
that you hate me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, you have never spoken so truly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, on my part I detest you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! I take the act.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Take it. You find me brutal and foolish; on my part I find
you have a harsh voice, and your face is too often distorted
with anger. At this moment you would allow yourself to be
thrown out of that window rather than allow me to kiss the
tip of your finger; I would precipitate myself from the top
of the balcony rather than touch the hem of your robe. But,
in five minutes, you will love me, and I shall adore you.
Oh, it is just so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I doubt it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And I swear it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Coxcomb!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And then, that is not the true reason. You stand in need of
me, Aure, and I of you. When it pleases you to be gay, I
make you laugh; when it suits me to be loving, I look at
you. I have given you a commission of lady of honor which
you wished for; you will give me, presently, something I
wish for.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, you will; but, at this moment, my dear Aure, I declare
to you that I wish for absolutely nothing, so be at ease.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are a frightful man, Malicorne; I was going to rejoice
at getting this commission, and thus you quench my joy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good; there is no time lost,  -  you will rejoice when I am
gone.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Go, then; and after  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So be it; but in the first place, a piece of advice.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Resume your good-humor,  -  you are ugly when you pout.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Coarse!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Come, let us tell the truth to each other, while we are
about it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, Malicorne! Bad-hearted man!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, Montalais! Ungrateful girl!&quot;</P>
<P>The young man leant with his elbow upon the window-frame;
Montalais took a book and opened it. Malicorne stood up,
brushed his hat with his sleeve; smoothed down his black
doublet,  -  Montalais, though pretending to read, looked at
him out of the corner of her eye.</P>
<P>&quot;Good!&quot; cried she, furious, &quot;he has assumed his respectful
air  -  and he will pout for a week.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A fortnight, mademoiselle,&quot; said Malicorne, bowing.</P>
<P>Montalais lifted up her little doubled fist. &quot;Monster!&quot; said
she; &quot;oh! that I were a man!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What would you do to me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I would strangle you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! very well, then,&quot; said Malicorne; &quot;I believe I begin to
desire something.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And what do you desire, Monsieur Demon? That I should lose
my soul from anger?&quot;</P>
<P>Malicorne was rolling his hat respectfully between his
fingers; but, all at once, he let fall his hat, seized the
young girl by the shoulders, pulled her towards him and
sealed her mouth with two lips that were very warm, for a
man pretending to so much indifference. Aure would have
cried out, but the cry was stifled in the kiss. Nervous and,
apparently, angry, the young girl pushed Malicorne against
the wall.</P>
<P>&quot;Good!&quot; said Malicorne, philosophically, &quot;that's enough for
six weeks. Adieu, mademoiselle, accept my very humble
salutation.&quot; And he made three steps towards the door.</P>
<P>&quot;Well! no,  -  you shall not go!&quot; cried, Montalais, stamping
with her little foot. &quot;Stay where you are! I order you!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You order me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; am I not mistress?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of my heart and soul, without doubt.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A pretty property! ma foi! The soul is silly and the heart
dry.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Beware, Montalais, I know you,&quot; said Malicorne; &quot;you are
going to fall in love with your humble servant.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, yes!&quot; said she, hanging round his neck with childish
indolence, rather than with loving abandonment. &quot;Well, yes!
for I must thank you at least.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And for what?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For the commission, is it not my whole future?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And mine.&quot;</P>
<P>Montalais looked at him.</P>
<P>&quot;It is frightful,&quot; said she, &quot;that one can never guess
whether you are speaking seriously or not.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I cannot speak more seriously. I was going to Paris,  -  you
are going there,  -  we are going there.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And so it was for that motive only you have served me,
selfish fellow!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What would you have me say, Aure? I cannot live without
you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well! in truth, it is just so with me; you are,
nevertheless, it must be confessed, a very bad-hearted young
man.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Aure, my dear Aure, take care! if you take to calling names
again, you know the effect they produce upon me, and I shall
adore you.&quot; And so saying, Malicorne drew the young girl a
second time towards him. But at that instant a step
resounded on the staircase. The young people were so close,
that they would have been surprised in the arms of each
other, if Montalais had not violently pushed Malicorne, with
his back against the door, just then opening. A loud cry,
followed by angry reproaches, immediately resounded. It was
Madame de Saint-Remy who uttered the cry and the angry
words. The unlucky Malicorne almost crushed her between the
wall and the door she was coming in at.</P>
<P>&quot;It is again that good-for-nothing!&quot; cried the old lady.
&quot;Always here!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, madame!&quot; replied Malicorne, in a respectful tone; &quot;it
is eight long days since I was here.&quot;</P></article>
