<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>China is as yet only slightly industrialized, but the industrial
possibilities of the country are very great, and it may be taken
as nearly certain that there will be a rapid development throughout
the next few decades. China's future depends as much upon the
manner of this development as upon any other single factor; and
China's difficulties are very largely connected with the present
industrial situation. I will therefore first briefly describe
this situation, and then consider the possibilities of the near
future.</p>

<p>We may take railways and mines as the foundation of a nation's
industrial life. Let us therefore consider first the railways
and then the mines, before going on to other matters.</p>

<p>When railways were new, the Manchu Government, like the universities
of Oxford and Cambridge (which it resembled in many ways), objected
to them, and did all it could to keep them at a distance.[99]
In 1875 a short line was built by foreigners from Shanghai to
Woosung, but the Central Government was so shocked that it caused
it to be destroyed. In 1881 the first permanent railway was constructed,
but not very much was accomplished until after the Japanese War
of 1894-5. The Powers then thought that China was breaking up,
and entered upon a scramble for concessions and spheres of influence.
The Belgians built the important line from Peking to Hankow; the
Americans obtained a concession for a Hankow-Canton railway, which,
however, has only been constructed as far as Changsha. Russia
built the Manchurian Railway, connecting Peking with the Siberian
Railway and with Europe. Germany built the Shantung Railway, from
Tsingtau to Tsinanfu. The French built a railway in the south.
England sought to obtain a monopoly of the railways in the Yangtze
valley. All these railways were to be owned by foreigners and
managed by foreign officials of the respective countries which
had obtained the concessions. The Boxer rising, however, made
Europe aware that some caution was needed if the Chinese were
not to be exasperated beyond endurance. After this, ownership
of new railways was left to the Chinese Government, but with so
much foreign control as to rob it of most of its value. By this
time, Chinese public opinion had come to realize that there must
be railways in China, and that the real problem was how to keep
them under Chinese control. In 1908, the Tientsin-Pukow line and
the Shanghai-Hangchow line were sanctioned, to be built by the
help of foreign loans, but with all the administrative control
in the hands of the Chinese Government. At the same time, the
Peking-Hankow line was bought back by the Government, and the
Peking-Kalgan line was constructed by the Chinese without foreign
financial assistance. Of the big main lines of China, this left
not much foreign control outside the Manchurian Railway (Chinese
Eastern Railway) and the Shantung Railway. The first of these
is mainly under foreign control and must now be regarded as permanently
lost, until such time as China becomes strong enough to defeat
Japan in war; and the whole of Manchuria has come more or less
under Japanese control. But the Shantung Railway, by the agreement
reached at Washington, is to be bought back by China&mdash;five years
hence, if all goes well. Thus, except in regions practically lost
to China, the Chinese now have control of all their more important
railways, or will have before long. This is a very hopeful feature
of the situation, and a distinct credit to Chinese sagacity.</p>

<p>Putnam Weale (Mr. Lennox Simpson) strongly urges&mdash;quite rightly,
as I think&mdash;the great importance of nationalizing <em>all</em>
Chinese railways. At Washington recently, he helped to secure
the Shantung Railway award, and to concentrate attention on the
railway as the main issue. Writing early in 1919, he said[100]:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>The key to the proper control of China and the building-up of<br/>
the new Republican State is the railway key</em>.... The revolution<br/>
of 1911, and the acceptance in principle of Western ideas of<br/>
popular government, removed the danger of foreign provinces being<br/>
carved out of the old Manchu Empire. There was, however, left<br/>
behind a more subtle weapon. <em>This weapon is the railway</em>. Russia<br/>
with her Manchurian Railway scheme taught Japan the new method.<br/>
Japan, by the Treaty of Portsmouth in 1905, not only inherited<br/>
the richer half of the Manchurian railways, but was able to put<br/>
into practice a new technique, based on a mixture of twisted<br/>
economics, police control, and military garrisons. Out of this<br/>
grew the latter-day highly developed railway-zone which, to all<br/>
intents and purposes, creates a new type of foreign <em>enclave</em>,<br/>
subversive of the Chinese State. <em>The especial evil to-day is<br/>
that Japan has transferred from Manchuria to Shantung this new<br/>
technique,</em> which ... she will eventually extend into the very<br/>
heart of intramural China ... and also into extramural Chihli and<br/>
Inner Mongolia (thus outflanking Peking) unless she is summarily<br/>
arrested. <em>At all costs this must be stopped.</em> The method of<br/>
doing so is easy: <em>It is to have it laid down categorically, and<br/>
accepted by all the Powers, that henceforth all railways on<br/>
Chinese soil are a vital portion of Chinese sovereignty and must<br/>
be controlled directly from Peking by a National Railway Board;<br/>
that stationmasters, personnel and police, must be Chinese<br/>
citizens, technical foreign help being limited to a set standard;<br/>
and that all railway concessions are henceforth to be considered<br/>
simply as building concessions which must be handed over, section<br/>
by section, as they are built, to the National Railway Board</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>If the Shantung Railway Agreement is loyally carried out, this
reform&mdash;as to whose importance I quite agree with Putnam Weale&mdash;will
have been practically completed five years hence. But we must
expect Japan to adopt every possible means of avoiding the carrying
out of her promises, from instigating Chinese civil war to the
murdering of Japanese employees by Japanese secret agents masquerading
as Chinese. Therefore, until the Chinese actually have complete
control of the Shantung Railway, we cannot feel confident that
they will ever get it.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the Chinese run railways badly.
The Kalgan Railway, which they built, is just as well built as
those constructed by foreigners; and the lines under Chinese administration
are admirably managed. I quote from Mr. Tyau[101] the following
statistics, which refer to the year 1919: Government railways,
in operation, 6027 kilometres; under construction, 383 kilometres;
private and provincial railways, 773 kilometres; concessioned
railways, 3,780 kilometres. Total, 10,963 kilometres, or 6,852
miles. (The concessioned railways are mainly those in Manchuria
and Shantung, of which the first must be regarded as definitely
lost to China, while the second is probably recovered. The problem
of concessioned railways has therefore no longer the importance
that it had, though, by detaching Manchuria, the foreign railway
has shown its power for evil). As regards financial results, Mr.
Tyau gives the following figures for the principal State railways
in 1918:&mdash;</p>

6.2 Peking-Suiyuan     490          1915           5.6</p>

<p>Subsequent years, for which I have not the exact figures, have
been less prosperous.</p>

<p>I cannot discover any evidence of incompetence in Chinese railway
administration. On the contrary, much has been done to overcome
the evils due to the fact that the various lines were originally
constructed by different Powers, each following its own customs,
so that there was no uniformity, and goods trucks could not be
moved from one line on to another. There is, however, urgent need
of further railways, especially to open up the west and to connect
Canton with Hankow, the profit of which would probably be enormous.</p>

<p>Mines are perhaps as important as railways, for if a country
allows foreign control of its mineral resources it cannot build
up either its industries or its munitions to the point where they
will be independent of foreign favour. But the situation as regards
mining is at present far from satisfactory. Mr. Julean Arnold,
American Commercial Attach√© at Peking, writing early in 1919,
made the following statement as regards China's mineral resources:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
China is favoured with a wonderful wealth in coal and in a good<br/>
supply of iron ore, two essentials to modern industrial<br/>
development. To indicate how little China has developed its<br/>
marvellous wealth in coal, this country imported, during 1917,<br/>
14,000,000 tons. It is estimated that China produces now<br/>
20,000,000 tons annually, but it is supposed to have richer<br/>
resources in coal than has the United States which, in 1918,<br/>
produced 650,000,000 tons. In iron ore it has been estimated that<br/>
China has 400,000,000 tons suitable for furnace reaction, and an<br/>
additional 300,000,000 tons which might be worked by native<br/>
methods. During 1917, it is estimated that China's production of<br/>
pig iron was 500,000 tons. The developments in the iron and steel<br/>
industry in China are making rapid strides, and a few years hence<br/>
it is expected that the production of pig iron and of finished<br/>
steel will be several millions of tons annually.... In antimony<br/>
and tin China is also particularly rich, and considerable<br/>
progress has taken place in the mining and smelting of these ores<br/>
during the past few years. China should jealously safeguard its<br/>
mineral wealth, so as to preserve it for the country's<br/>
welfare.[102]

</p>
</div>
<p>The <em>China Year Book</em> for 1919 gives the total Chinese
production of coal for 1914 as 6,315,735 tons, and of iron ore
at 468,938 tons.[103] Comparing these with Mr. Arnold's figures
for 1917, namely 20,000,000 tons of coal and 500,000 tons of pig
iron (not iron ore), it is evident that great progress was made
during those three years, and there is every reason to think that
at least the same rate of progress has been maintained. The main
problem for China, however, is not <em>rapid</em> development,
but <em>national</em> development. Japan is poor in minerals,
and has set to work to acquire as much as possible of the mineral
wealth of China. This is important to Japan, for two different
reasons: first, that only industrial development can support the
growing population, which cannot be induced to emigrate to Japanese
possessions on the mainland; secondly, that steel is an indispensable
requisite for imperialism.</p>

<p>The Chinese are proud of the Kiangnan dock and engineering works
at Shanghai, which is a Government concern, and has proved its
capacity for shipbuilding on modern lines. It built four ships
of 10,000 tons each for the American Government. Mr. <em>S.G.
</em>Cheng[104] says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
For the construction of these ships, materials were mostly<br/>
supplied by China, except steel, which had to be shipped from<br/>
America and Europe (the steel produced in China being so limited<br/>
in quantity, that after a certain amount is exported to Japan by<br/>
virtue of a previous contract, little is left for home<br/>
consumption).

</p>
</div>
<p>Considering how rich China is in iron ore, this state of affairs
needs explanation. The explanation is valuable to anyone who wishes
to understand modern politics.</p>

<p>The <em>China Year Book</em> for 1919[105] (a work as little
concerned with politics as <em>Whitaker's Almanack</em>) gives
a list of the five principal iron mines in China, with some information
about each. The first and most important are the Tayeh mines,
worked by the Hanyehping Iron and Coal Co., Ltd., which, as the
reader may remember, was the subject of the third group in the
Twenty-one Demands. The total amount of ore in sight is estimated
by the <em>China Year Book</em> at 50,000,000 tons, derived chiefly
from two mines, in one of which the ore yields 65 per cent. of
iron, in the other 58 to 63 per cent. The output for 1916 is given
as 603,732 tons (it has been greatly increased since then). The
<em>Year Book</em> proceeds: "Japanese capital is invested in
the Company, and by the agreement between China and Japan of May
1915 [after the ultimatum which enforced the revised Twenty-one
Demands], the Chinese Government undertook not to convert the
Company into a State-owned concern nor to compel it to borrow
money from other than Japanese sources." It should be added that
there is a Japanese accountant and a Japanese technical adviser,
and that pig-iron and ore, up to a specified value, must be sold
to the Imperial Japanese works at much below the market price,
leaving a paltry residue for sale in the open market.[106]</p>

<p>The second item in the <em>China Year Book's</em> list is the
Tungkuan Shan mines. All that is said about these is as follows:
"Tungling district on the Yangtze, 55 miles above Wuhu, Anhui
province. A concession to work these mines, granted to the London
and China Syndicate (British) in 1904, was surrendered in 1910
for the sum of ¬£52,000, and the mines were transferred to a Chinese
Company to be formed for their exploitation." These mines, therefore,
are in Chinese hands. I do not know what their capacity is supposed
to be, and in view of the price at which they were sold, it cannot
be very great. The capital of the Hanyehping Co. is $20,000,000,
which is considerably more than ¬£52,000. This was the only one
of the five iron mines mentioned in the <em>Year Book</em> which
was not in Japanese hands at the time when the <em>Year Book</em>
was published.</p>

<p>Next comes the Taochung Iron Mine, Anhui province. "The concession
which was granted to the Sino-Japanese Industrial Development
Co. will be worked by the Orient Steel Manufacturing Co. The mine
is said to contain 60,000,000 tons of ore, containing 65 per cent.
of pure iron. The plan of operations provides for the production
of pig iron at the rate of 170,000 tons a year, a steel mill with
a capacity of 100,000 tons of steel ingots a year, and a casting
and forging mill to produce 75,000 tons a year."</p>

<p>The fourth mine is at Chinlingchen, in Shantung, "worked in conjunction
with the Hengshan Colliery by the railway." I presume it is to
be sold back to China along with the railway.</p>

<p>The fifth and last mine mentioned is the Penhsihu Mine, "one
of the most promising mines in the nine mining areas in South
Manchuria, where the Japanese are permitted by an exchange of
Notes between the Chinese and Japanese Governments (May 25, 1915)
to prospect for and operate mines. The seam of this mine extends
from near Liaoyang to the neighbourhood of Penhsihu, and in size
is pronounced equal to the Tayeh mine." It will be observed that
this mine, also, was acquired by the Japanese as a result of the
ultimatum enforcing the Twenty-one Demands. The <em>Year Book</em>
adds: "The Japanese Navy is purchasing some of the Penhsihu output.
Osaka ironworks placed an order for 15,000 tons in 1915 and the
arsenal at Osaka in the same year accepted a tender for Penhsihu
iron."</p>

<p>It will be seen from these facts that, as regards iron, the Chinese
have allowed the Japanese to acquire a position of vantage from
which they can only be ousted with great difficulty. Nevertheless,
it is absolutely imperative that the Chinese should develop an
iron and steel industry of their own on a large scale. If they
do not, they cannot preserve their national independence, their
own civilization, or any of the things that make them potentially
of value to the world. It should be observed that the chief reason
for which the Japanese desire Chinese iron is in order to be able
to exploit and tyrannize over China. Confucius, I understand,
says nothing about iron mines;[107] therefore the old-fashioned
Chinese did not realize the importance of preserving them. Now
that they are awake to the situation, it is almost too late. I
shall come back later to the question of what can be done. For
the present, let us continue our survey of facts.</p>

<p>It may be presumed that the population of China will always be
mainly agricultural. Tea, silk, raw cotton, grain, the soya bean,
etc., are crops in which China excels. In production of raw cotton,
China is the third country in the world, India being the first
and the United States the second. There is, of course, room for
great progress in agriculture, but industry is vital if China
is to preserve her national independence, and it is industry that
is our present topic.</p>

<p>To quote Mr. Tyau: "At the end of 1916 the number of factory
hands was officially estimated at 560,000 and that of mine workers
406,000. Since then no official returns for the whole country
have been published ... but perhaps a million each would be an
approximate figure for the present number of factory operatives
and mine workers."[108] Of course, the hours are very long and
the wages very low; Mr. Tyau mentions as specially modern and
praiseworthy certain textile factories where the wages range from
15 to 45 cents a day.[109] (The cent varies in value, but is always
somewhere between a farthing and a halfpenny.) No doubt as industry
develops Socialism and labour unrest will also develop. If Mr.
Tyau is to be taken as a sample of the modern Chinese governing
classes, the policy of the Government towards Labour will be very
illiberal. Mr. Tyau's outlook is that of an American capitalist,
and shows the extent to which he has come under American influence,
as well as that of conservative England (he is an <em>LL.D. </em>of
London). Most of the Young Chinese I came across, however, were
Socialists, and it may be hoped that the traditional Chinese dislike
of uncompromising fierceness will make the Government less savage
against Labour than the Governments of America and Japan.</p>

<p>There is room for the development of a great textile industry
in China. There are a certain number of modern mills, and nothing
but enterprise is needed to make the industry as great as that
of Lancashire.</p>

<p>Shipbuilding has made a good beginning in Shanghai, and would
probably develop rapidly if China had a flourishing iron and steel
industry in native hands.</p>

<p>The total exports of native produce in 1919 were just under ¬£200,000,000
(630,000,000 taels), and the total imports slightly larger. It
is better, however, to consider such statistics in taels, because
currency fluctuations make the results deceptive when reckoned
in sterling. The tael is not a coin, but a certain weight of silver,
and therefore its value fluctuates with the value of silver. The
<em>China Year Book</em> gives imports and exports of Chinese
produce for 1902 as 325 million taels and 214 million taels respectively;
for 1911, as 482 and 377; for 1917, as 577 and 462; for 1920,
as 762 and 541. (The corresponding figures in pounds sterling
for 1911 are 64 millions and 50 millions; for 1917, 124 millions
and 99,900,000.) It will thus be seen that, although the foreign
trade of China is still small in proportion to population, it
is increasing very fast. To a European it is always surprising
to find how little the economic life of China is affected by such
incidents as revolutions and civil wars.</p>

<p>Certain principles seem to emerge from a study of the Chinese
railways and mines as needing to be adopted by the Chinese Government
if national independence is to be preserved. As regards railways,
nationalization is obviously desirable, even if it somewhat retards
the building of new lines. Railways not in the hands of the Government
will be controlled, in the end if not in the beginning, by foreigners,
who will thus acquire a power over China which will be fatal to
freedom. I think we may hope that the Chinese authorities now
realize this, and will henceforth act upon it.</p>

<p>In regard to mines, development by the Chinese themselves is
urgent, since undeveloped resources tempt the greed of the Great
Powers, and development by foreigners makes it possible to keep
China enslaved. It should therefore be enacted that, in future,
no sale of mines or of any interest in mines to foreigners, and
no loan from foreigners on the security of mines, will be recognized
as legally valid. In view of extra-territoriality, it will be
difficult to induce foreigners to accept such legislation, and
Consular Courts will not readily admit its validity. But, as the
example of extra-territoriality in Japan shows, such matters depend
upon the national strength; if the Powers fear China, they will
recognize the validity of Chinese legislation, but if not, not.
In view of the need of rapid development of mining by Chinese,
it would probably be unwise to nationalize all mines here and
now. It would be better to provide every possible encouragement
to genuinely Chinese private enterprise, and to offer the assistance
of geological and mining experts, etc. The Government should,
however, retain the right (<em>a</em>) to buy out any mining concern
at a fair valuation; (<em>b</em>) to work minerals itself in cases
where the private owners fail to do so, in spite of expert opinion
in favour of their being worked. These powers should be widely
exercised, and as soon as mining has reached the point compatible
with national security, the mines should be all nationalized,
except where, as at Tayeh, diplomatic agreements stand in the
way. It is clear that the Tayeh mines must be recovered by China
as soon as opportunity offers, but when or how that will be it
is as yet impossible to say. Of course I have been assuming an
orderly government established in China, but without that nothing
vigorous can be done to repel foreign aggression. This is a point
to which, along with other general questions connected with the
industrializing of China, I shall return in my last chapter.</p>

<p>It is said by Europeans who have business experience in China
that the Chinese are not good at managing large joint-stock companies,
such as modern industry requires. As everyone knows, they are
proverbially honest in business, in spite of the corruption of
their politics. But their successful businesses&mdash;so one gathers&mdash;do
not usually extend beyond a single family; and even they are apt
to come to grief sooner or later through nepotism. This is what
Europeans say; I cannot speak from my own knowledge. But I am
convinced that modern education is very quickly changing this
state of affairs, which was connected with Confucianism and the
family ethic. Many Chinese have been trained in business methods
in America; there are Colleges of Commerce at Woosung and other
places; and the patriotism of Young China has led men of the highest
education to devote themselves to industrial development. The
Chinese are no doubt, by temperament and tradition, more suited
to commerce than to industry, but contact with the West is rapidly
introducing new aptitudes and a new mentality. There is, therefore,
every reason to expect, if political conditions are not too adverse,
that the industrial development of China will proceed rapidly
throughout the next few decades. It is of vital importance that
that development should be controlled by the Chinese rather than
by foreign nations. But that is part of the larger problem of
the recovery of Chinese independence, with which I shall deal
in my last chapter.</p>
