<p><em>THEOPHRASTE’S </em>bones were not broken, and it only took
six weeks to heal, although he was obliged to keep to his bed
for two months, when he regained the use of his legs. During all
this time he did not make a single allusion to the past. Cartouche
was dead—quite dead. The operation had been successful, although
very painful. So much so, that every one dreaded that he would
remain a cripple to the end of his life; but he had recovered
marvelously. He had obtained a new set of teeth, and was able
to speak quite plainly, but it was a more difficult thing to rid
himself of the effects of the boiling water in his ears, and at
times he was perfectly deaf.</p>

<p>After a while Théophraste thought of occupying his mind by going
back into business. He had retired when young, being able to live
on the income derived from several inventions which he had made
for the use of rubber stamps.</p>

<p>However, they were all very thankful for the result, and this
slight inconvenience did not worry them.</p>

<p>It was his habit to rise early, and after breakfast he would
go out for a little walk to strengthen his legs. He soon found
their old elasticity, and regained their full use. On these occasions
Adolphe used to follow a short distance behind in order to watch
his movements and report to M. Eliphaste.</p>

<p>At first he noticed nothing abnormal in his behavior, and in
his report contented himself with stating this unimportant fact,
that he stopped quite a while before a butcher’s stall. If this
had occurred only once, it would have passed the watchful Adolphe
unnoticed. However, it became a regular thing for Théophraste
to stand looking at the bloody meat, and spend some time talking
to the butcher, a square-shouldered, florid fellow, always ready
with a jest.</p>

<p>One day, when M. Lecamus had decided that Théophraste had spent
too much time at the butcher’s shop, he came up to him, as if
by chance, and found him, with the butcher, decorating all the
fresh meat with curl papers. This was innocent enough. Thus judged
M. Eliphaste, although he wrote in the margin of the report:</p>

<p>"He may look at the meat in the butcher’s shop. It is good to
let him see blood sometimes. It is the end of the crisis, and
can do no harm."</p>

<p>This butchery was a small one, and had its specialty. M. Houdry
sold among other ordinary meats a special quality of veal. The
secret of this quality lay in the way it was killed. The majority
of Paris butchers obtain their meat from the abattoirs, but M.
Houdry always bought his alive, and killed it himself, in his
own way. He was not satisfied to knock the calf in the head, as
they did at the abattoirs. He bled it after the Jewish manner,
with a large knife which he called the bleeder, and so dexterous
had he become in this art that he never had to cut the same wound
twice. He had gained some reputation as a good butcher.</p>

<p>M. Houdry had explained the case about his veal to M. Longuet,
with the greatest mystery, and he had evidently taken great pleasure
in it— so much so that Théophraste, after having listened to the
theory, had shown the desire to assist at a practical lesson.
In a small court adjacent to the store, M. Houdry had a secret
abattoir. On a certain morning, Théophraste, who happened there
at a much earlier hour than was his custom, found his man at the
abattoir with a calf. The butcher begged him to come in, and to
close the doors behind him. "I shut myself up every day thus with
a live calf," said M. Houdry, "and when the doors of the abattoir
are opened again, the calf is dead. I lose no time; I have operated
in twenty-five minutes."</p>

<p>Théophraste congratulated him. He asked him many questions, interesting
himself in all the objects which struck his attention. The bellows
with its large arms drew his attention. He also saw a windlass.
He learned that that strong oak cross-bar, with pegs in it, supported
the windlass and the bucket. He admired the solid oak hand-barrow
also. A chopper which was drawn up was called a "leaf." But that
which interested him more was a set of tools hung on the walls
in the shop. In this "shop," which was sort of saddle-bags for
cutlass, he saw first of all the bleeder, and was pleased to pass
his finger over the long, strong and sharpened edge. Then there
was a much smaller knife, called the "Moutoniner," used ordinarily
to cut up mutton, as the name indicates, but which was used there
to cut certain parts of veal. Then some other small knives, among
which was the canut, used in "flowering" the veal. "Flowering"
the veal consists in making light, artistic designs on the shin
of the veal, as soon as it is bleached.</p>

<p>The first day M. Longuet received instructions about the tools.
But in the following days he learned the art of the whole operation,
and entered into each detail with little repugnance. He used to
say, some days, in going away, jestingly: "You kill a calf every
day; you must be careful, my dear M. Houdry, you see it will end
by its becoming known to the other calves."</p>

<p>Théophraste was not idle, either. Whenever he had an opportunity
he would help M. Houdry in these killings. One day the assistant
did not come, and Théophraste helped rope up the calf for killing.
As he was doing this, M. Houdry remarked on the evil of killing
the calf by striking him on the head, as they did at the abattoir.</p>

<p>Théophraste declared it was a crime, and most inhuman. "It is
much finer to do it with the bleeder. One blow is sufficient,
and the head is off. What a fine death. How the blood flows, and
with what dispatch does he die."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Théophraste, who had killed the calf, "see the calf’s
eyes, as the blood flows. How they stare at you. They are dead,
but they look at you!"</p>

<p>"What is the matter with the calf’s eyes?" demanded M. Houdry.
"They are like the rest. Ah, you think it is a joke? Well, well,
you are not so used to it as I."</p>

<p>M. Houdry then prepared the meat for selling, and while he was
doing so Théophraste took the head, cleaned it and cut out the
eyes. The sight of the blood had excited him beyond control, and
M. Houdry was amused when he desired to take the head and feet
home with him.</p>

<p>In parting he said: "Au revoir, M. Houdry, au revoir. I will
take the head away with me, but I leave you the eyes. I do not
like eyes to stare at me. You must not laugh at me, though. You
do not understand me. However, it is my affair, and you must be
glad that you are not afraid of dead eyes staring at you."</p>

<p>And so he returned home, and when he appeared at the door of
his house with the calf’s head under his arm, Adolphe and Marceline
smiled, saying: "He is amusing himself with some innocent prank."</p>
