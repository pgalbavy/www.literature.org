<p>Avon Burnet was in the act of lifting his Winchester from across
the front of his saddle, when he made the discovery that, although
the strange mustang in front of him bore no rider, yet a man was
on the ground directly beyond and evidently watching every movement
made by himself.</p>

<p>This discovery could mean but one thing: the individual was an
enemy, and was on the point of making a hostile movement against
him. He had undoubtedly dismounted on learning of Burnet's approach
and interposed his steed between them. Despite the gloom on every
hand, Avon read aright the meaning of the almost imperceptible
movement on the other side of the saddle, and he slipped from
the back of his mustang with a celerity which, being displayed
almost at the instant of the discharge of the other weapon, looked
as if it was the result of a fatal shot.</p>

<p>But, although the bullet so treacherously fired came near its
mark, the youth was not touched. His action was in the nick of
time: a second later could not have availed him.</p>

<p>He was incensed, as he had the best cause for being, and he resolved
that the miscreant should not escape him. His rifle was snatched
from its resting-place, and, stepping from behind Thunderbolt,
he drew the best bead possible on his foe.</p>

<p>The dexterity of the latter was marvellous. It was as if, at
the very instant of discharging his weapon, he had vaulted into
the saddle, and, wheeling the head of his horse away, sent him
scurrying straight from his intended victim.</p>

<p>Not only that, but, in accordance with the fashion of the frontier
in such emergencies, he flung himself forward on the neck of his
animal, so as to offer the least possible target to the other,
who, if not hit hard, was certain to return the shot.</p>

<p>The curious feature of the proceeding was that the man, having
seen the youth vanish from the back of his steed at the instant
the gun was discharged, did not assume that he was killed. Possibly
such was his supposition, and his hasty flight was partly due
to his anxiety to place himself beyond reach of his friends, who
were likely to be drawn thither by the sound of firing. His act
in throwing himself upon the neck of his mustang was simply in
obedience to the rule which requires the frontiersman to avail
himself of every possible means of safety, even when there is
seemingly no call for it.</p>

<p>Despite the quickness of young Burnet, he was able to bring his
Winchester to a level only at the moment the steed was thundering
out of sight in the darkness, but he let fly three times in rapid
succession, reckless whether he struck rider or animal; but since
the sound of the hoofs still came to him, he was chagrined at
the conviction that he had missed both.</p>

<p>"But you haven't escaped me yet," he muttered, swinging himself
into the saddle; "there is no horse in Texas or the Indian Nation
that can leave me behind; now, Thunderbolt, run him down!"</p>

<p>But, while the fates had been kind to Avon, in that he escaped
death by the narrowest conceivable chance, they seemed equally
well disposed toward the object of his wrath. The boast of the
pursuer as to the fleetness of his mustang was warranted, and
had the circumstances continued favorable for only a few minutes,
he would have brought his young rider beside the fleeing steed,
where the account between the two men must have been quickly settled.</p>

<p>But at the very moment of starting, the forelegs of Thunderbolt
sank into a hole above the knees. His activity saved him from
harm, but his rider took a header over his ears, sprawling on
the wet grass in front with a shock that stunned him.</p>

<p>By the time he could rally and remount his mustang, the other
was not only beyond sight, but his listening ear could not detect
the slightest sound of the flying hoofs.</p>

<p>"He has escaped this time," thought Avon, as he once more resumed
his place in the saddle, "but the account is still open and must
be settled very soon."</p>

<p>He was right, except that the account was closed not only sooner
than he suspected, but in a manner of which he never dreamed.</p>

<p>Despite his alarming experience he had not lost his reckoning,
and, facing toward the bed-ground of the herd, he had ridden but
a short way, when the familiar sounds told him he was near the
animals from which he was lost only a short time before.</p>

<p>"They are here, Baby, just as I thought." The remark was made
by Gleeson, who loomed up in the gloom as he spoke, with his mustang
on a deliberate walk.</p>

<p>"I am glad of that, and, since no one beside you and me knows
of our slip last night, we'll keep it to ourselves."</p>

<p>"I've no objection; but didn't I hear a gun go off a few minutes
ago? What was you shooting at?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't <em>I</em>&mdash;someone shot at <em>me</em>."</p>

<p>And thereupon Avon related the particulars of his encounter with
the treacherous horseman. Gleeson listened and said nothing until
he had finished. Then, with a characteristic exclamation, he expressed
his regret that Thunderbolt should have stumbled as he did.</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes open," he added. "I'll do the same, and we'll
get the drop on him soon."</p>

<p>"Why does he want to hurt <em>me</em>?" asked Avon, "when there
has never been a word between us?"</p>

<p>"It's the nature of the animal," was the reply. "It wouldn't
have made any difference whether it was you or me, so he thought
he had a sure thing of it. That's what he's here for."</p>

<p>It was evident from these words that each of the speakers was
satisfied as to the identity of the one that had fired the well-nigh
fatal shot. Gleeson named him immediately.</p>

<p>"I warned the cap, when he hired that Comanche, that we would
have trouble with him. We left Texas a little short-handed, but
we could have got through well enough without him. Howsumever,
Shackaye, as you remember, rode into camp one day and asked the
cap to give him a job, and the cap done it."</p>

<p>"I recall your words about him, and I thought they were not justified;
but what made you so suspicious?"</p>

<p>The Texan uttered an impatient exclamation.</p>

<p>"In the first place he's an Injin, and <em>that</em> ought to
be enough. I never seen one of his race that it's safe to trust;
they'll shoot the man that gives them a cup of water or a piece
of bread. Talk about Injin gratitude! There aint any such thing."</p>

<p>"What did my uncle say to your sentiments?"</p>

<p>"He laughed in that quiet way of his, and said maybe as I was
right, but he didn't see what we had to fear from one Injin that
was in camp with us; he reckoned we could pull his teeth before
he could bite enough to hurt."</p>

<p>"I am sure he will think differently when he hears my story."</p>

<p>"Don't tell him or anyone else a word about it. Promise me that."</p>

<p>"And why?" asked the surprised Avon.</p>

<p>"Well," was the hesitating answer, "I've several reasons: one
of them is that though you and me have fixed on the Comanche as
the chap, we aint sure of it. It looks very much that way, but
it may be someone else after all. We mustn't make any mistake,
and above all, don't let Shackaye think we suspect him."</p>

<p>The youth gave his promise, though in his mind there was no doubt
of the identity of the man that had come so near shooting him
from his mustang. He saw the wisdom of not allowing Shackaye to
know that he was suspected.</p>

<p>The cattle having been located, the couple had little to do but
to hold them where they were. This proved less difficult than
at other times. They had the help of Burrell, or Old Bronze, in
the work, and the three did little but ride back and forth, timing
their course in such a way that they skirted the large body of
animals, often meeting and exchanging greetings, but more often
passing without seeming to see each other.</p>

<p>Sometimes one of the cattle would show a determination to dash
away from the main body, but before he went far, a horseman was
in front of him and he was forced back. The night was too chilly
for sleeping, else one or more of the herders would have stretched
out on the damp earth, with his bridle reins so interlocked with
his arm that his horse could not wander off, or he would have
fallen asleep in his saddle. When worn out with fatigue and loss
of slumber, a cowboy often rides for miles totally unconscious
of what is going on around him.</p>
