<p>Denham had no conscious intention of following Katharine, but,
seeing her depart, he took his hat and ran rather more quickly
down the stairs than he would have done if Katharine had not been
in front of him. He overtook a friend of his, by name Harry Sandys,
who was going the same way, and they walked together a few paces
behind Katharine and Rodney.</p>

<p>The night was very still, and on such nights, when the traffic
thins away, the walker becomes conscious of the moon in the street,
as if the curtains of the sky had been drawn apart, and the heaven
lay bare, as it does in the country. The air was softly cool,
so that people who had been sitting talking in a crowd found it
pleasant to walk a little before deciding to stop an omnibus or
encounter light again in an underground railway. Sandys, who was
a barrister with a philosophic tendency, took out his pipe, lit
it, murmured "hum" and "ha," and was silent. The couple in front
of them kept their distance accurately, and appeared, so far as
Denham could judge by the way they turned towards each other,
to be talking very constantly. He observed that when a pedestrian
going the opposite way forced them to part they came together
again directly afterwards. Without intending to watch them he
never quite lost sight of the yellow scarf twisted round Katharine’s
head, or the light overcoat which made Rodney look fashionable
among the crowd. At the Strand he supposed that they would separate,
but instead they crossed the road, and took their way down one
of the narrow passages which lead through ancient courts to the
river. Among the crowd of people in the big thoroughfares Rodney
seemed merely to be lending Katharine his escort, but now, when
passengers were rare and the footsteps of the couple were distinctly
heard in the silence, Denham could not help picturing to himself
some change in their conversation. The effect of the light and
shadow, which seemed to increase their height, was to make them
mysterious and significant, so that Denham had no feeling of irritation
with Katharine, but rather a half-dreamy acquiescence in the course
of the world. Yes, she did very well to dream about&mdash;but Sandys
had suddenly begun to talk. He was a solitary man who had made
his friends at college and always addressed them as if they were
still undergraduates arguing in his room, though many months or
even years had passed in some cases between the last sentence
and the present one. The method was a little singular, but very
restful, for it seemed to ignore completely all accidents of human
life, and to span very deep abysses with a few simple words.</p>

<p>On this occasion he began, while they waited for a minute on
the edge of the Strand:</p>

<p>"I hear that Bennett has given up his theory of truth."</p>

<p>Denham returned a suitable answer, and he proceeded to explain
how this decision had been arrived at, and what changes it involved
in the philosophy which they both accepted. Meanwhile Katharine
and Rodney drew further ahead, and Denham kept, if that is the
right expression for an involuntary action, one filament of his
mind upon them, while with the rest of his intelligence he sought
to understand what Sandys was saying.</p>

<p>As they passed through the courts thus talking, Sandys laid the
tip of his stick upon one of the stones forming a time-worn arch,
and struck it meditatively two or three times in order to illustrate
something very obscure about the complex nature of one’s apprehension
of facts. During the pause which this necessitated, Katharine
and Rodney turned the corner and disappeared. For a moment Denham
stopped involuntarily in his sentence, and continued it with a
sense of having lost something.</p>

<p>Unconscious that they were observed, Katharine and Rodney had
come out on the Embankment. When they had crossed the road, Rodney
slapped his hand upon the stone parapet above the river and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I promise I won’t say another word about it, Katharine! But
do stop a minute and look at the moon upon the water."</p>

<p>Katharine paused, looked up and down the river, and snuffed the
air.</p>

<p>"I’m sure one can smell the sea, with the wind blowing this way,"
she said.</p>

<p>They stood silent for a few moments while the river shifted in
its bed, and the silver and red lights which were laid upon it
were torn by the current and joined together again. Very far off
up the river a steamer hooted with its hollow voice of unspeakable
melancholy, as if from the heart of lonely mist-shrouded voyagings.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Rodney cried, striking his hand once more upon the balustrade,
"why can’t one say how beautiful it all is? Why am I condemned
for ever, Katharine, to feel what I can’t express? And the things
I can give there’s no use in my giving. Trust me, Katharine,"
he added hastily, "I won’t speak of it again. But in the presence
of beauty&mdash;look at the iridescence round the moon!&mdash;one feels&mdash;one
feels &mdash;Perhaps if you married me &mdash;I’m half a poet,
you see, and I can’t pretend not to feel what I do feel. If I
could write&mdash;ah, that would be another matter. I shouldn’t bother
you to marry me then, Katharine."</p>

<p>He spoke these disconnected sentences rather abruptly, with his
eyes alternately upon the moon and upon the stream.</p>

<p>"But for me I suppose you would recommend marriage?" said Katharine,
with her eyes fixed on the moon.</p>

<p>"Certainly I should. Not for you only, but for all women. Why,
you’re nothing at all without it; you’re only half alive; using
only half your faculties; you must feel that for yourself. That
is why&mdash;" Here he stopped himself, and they began to walk slowly
along the Embankment, the moon fronting them.</p>

"With how sad steps she climbs the sky,<br/>
How silently and with how wan a face,"

</p>
</div>
<p>Rodney quoted.</p>

<p>"I’ve been told a great many unpleasant things about myself to-night," 
Katharine stated, without attending to him. "Mr. Denham seems
to think it his mission to lecture me, though I hardly know him.
By the way, William, you know him; tell me, what is he like?"</p>

<p>William drew a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"We may lecture you till we’re blue in the face&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but what’s he like?"</p>

<p>"And we write sonnets to your eyebrows, you cruel practical creature.
Denham?" he added, as Katharine remained silent. "A good fellow,
I should think. He cares, naturally, for the right sort of things,
I expect. But you mustn’t marry him, though. He scolded you, did
he&mdash;what did he say?"</p>

<p>"What happens with Mr. Denham is this: He comes to tea. I do
all I can to put him at his ease. He merely sits and scowls at
me. Then I show him our manuscripts. At this he becomes really
angry, and tells me I’ve no business to call myself a middle-class
woman. So we part in a huff; and next time we meet, which was
to-night, he walks straight up to me, and says, ‘Go to the Devil!’
That’s the sort of behavior my mother complains of. I want to
know, what does it mean?"</p>

<p>She paused and, slackening her steps, looked at the lighted train
drawing itself smoothly over Hungerford Bridge.</p>

<p>"It means, I should say, that he finds you chilly and unsympathetic."</p>

<p>Katharine laughed with round, separate notes of genuine amusement.</p>

<p>"It’s time I jumped into a cab and hid myself in my own house,"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Would your mother object to my being seen with you? No one could
possibly recognize us, could they?" Rodney inquired, with some
solicitude.</p>

<p>Katharine looked at him, and perceiving that his solicitude was
genuine, she laughed again, but with an ironical note in her laughter.</p>

<p>"You may laugh, Katharine, but I can tell you that if any of
your friends saw us together at this time of night they would
talk about it, and I should find that very disagreeable. But why
do you laugh?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know. Because you’re such a queer mixture, I think.
You’re half poet and half old maid."</p>

<p>"I know I always seem to you highly ridiculous. But I can’t help
having inherited certain traditions and trying to put them into
practice."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, William. You may come of the oldest family in Devonshire,
but that’s no reason why you should mind being seen alone with
me on the Embankment."</p>

<p>"I’m ten years older than you are, Katharine, and I know more
of the world than you do."</p>

<p>"Very well. Leave me and go home."</p>

<p>Rodney looked back over his shoulder and perceived that they
were being followed at a short distance by a taxicab, which evidently
awaited his summons. Katharine saw it, too, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Don’t call that cab for me, William. I shall walk."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Katharine; you’ll do nothing of the kind. It’s nearly
twelve o’clock, and we’ve walked too far as it is."</p>

<p>Katharine laughed and walked on so quickly that both Rodney and
the taxicab had to increase their pace to keep up with her.</p>

<p>"Now, William," she said, "if people see me racing along the
Embankment like this they <em>WILL </em>talk. You had far better
say good-night, if you don’t want people to talk."</p>

<p>At this William beckoned, with a despotic gesture, to the cab
with one hand, and with the other he brought Katharine to a standstill.</p>

<p>"Don’t let the man see us struggling, for God’s sake!" he murmured.
Katharine stood for a moment quite still.</p>

<p>"There’s more of the old maid in you than the poet," she observed
briefly.</p>

<p>William shut the door sharply, gave the address to the driver,
and turned away, lifting his hat punctiliously high in farewell
to the invisible lady.</p>

<p>He looked back after the cab twice, suspiciously, half expecting
that she would stop it and dismount; but it bore her swiftly on,
and was soon out of sight. William felt in the mood for a short
soliloquy of indignation, for Katharine had contrived to exasperate
him in more ways than one.</p>

<p>"Of all the unreasonable, inconsiderate creatures I’ve ever known,
she’s the worst!" he exclaimed to himself, striding back along
the Embankment. "Heaven forbid that I should ever make a fool
of myself with her again. Why, I’d sooner marry the daughter of
my landlady than Katharine Hilbery! She’d leave me not a moment’s
peace&mdash;and she’d never understand me&mdash;never, never, never!"</p>

<p>Uttered aloud and with vehemence so that the stars of Heaven
might hear, for there was no human being at hand, these sentiments
sounded satisfactorily irrefutable. Rodney quieted down, and walked
on in silence, until he perceived some one approaching him, who
had something, either in his walk or his dress, which proclaimed
that he was one of William’s acquaintances before it was possible
to tell which of them he was. It was Denham who, having parted
from Sandys at the bottom of his staircase, was now walking to
the Tube at Charing Cross, deep in the thoughts which his talk
with Sandys had suggested. He had forgotten the meeting at Mary
Datchet’s rooms, he had forgotten Rodney, and metaphors and Elizabethan
drama, and could have sworn that he had forgotten Katharine Hilbery,
too, although that was more disputable. His mind was scaling the
highest pinnacles of its alps, where there was only starlight
and the untrodden snow. He cast strange eyes upon Rodney, as they
encountered each other beneath a lamp-post.</p>

<p>"Ha!" Rodney exclaimed.</p>

<p>If he had been in full possession of his mind, Denham would probably
have passed on with a salutation. But the shock of the interruption
made him stand still, and before he knew what he was doing, he
had turned and was walking with Rodney in obedience to Rodney’s
invitation to come to his rooms and have something to drink. Denham
had no wish to drink with Rodney, but he followed him passively
enough. Rodney was gratified by this obedience. He felt inclined
to be communicative with this silent man, who possessed so obviously
all the good masculine qualities in which Katharine now seemed
lamentably deficient.</p>

<p>"You do well, Denham," he began impulsively, "to have nothing
to do with young women. I offer you my experience&mdash;if one trusts
them one invariably has cause to repent. Not that I have any reason
at this moment," he added hastily, "to complain of them. It’s
a subject that crops up now and again for no particular reason.
Miss Datchet, I dare say, is one of the exceptions. Do you like
Miss Datchet?"</p>

<p>These remarks indicated clearly enough that Rodney’s nerves were
in a state of irritation, and Denham speedily woke to the situation
of the world as it had been one hour ago. He had last seen Rodney
walking with Katharine. He could not help regretting the eagerness
with which his mind returned to these interests, and fretted him
with the old trivial anxieties. He sank in his own esteem. Reason
bade him break from Rodney, who clearly tended to become confidential,
before he had utterly lost touch with the problems of high philosophy.
He looked along the road, and marked a lamp-post at a distance
of some hundred yards, and decided that he would part from Rodney
when they reached this point.</p>

<p>"Yes, I like Mary; I don’t see how one could help liking her,"
he remarked cautiously, with his eye on the lamp-post.</p>

<p>"Ah, Denham, you’re so different from me. You never give yourself
away. I watched you this evening with Katharine Hilbery. My instinct
is to trust the person I’m talking to. That’s why I’m always being
taken in, I suppose."</p>

<p>Denham seemed to be pondering this statement of Rodney’s, but,
as a matter of fact, he was hardly conscious of Rodney and his
revelations, and was only concerned to make him mention Katharine
again before they reached the lamp-post.</p>

<p>"Who’s taken you in now?" he asked. "Katharine Hilbery?"</p>

<p>Rodney stopped and once more began beating a kind of rhythm,
as if he were marking a phrase in a symphony, upon the smooth
stone balustrade of the Embankment.</p>

<p>"Katharine Hilbery," he repeated, with a curious little chuckle.
"No, Denham, I have no illusions about that young woman. I think
I made that plain to her to-night. But don’t run away with a false
impression,"  he continued eagerly, turning and linking his arm
through Denham’s, as though to prevent him from escaping; and,
thus compelled, Denham passed the monitory lamp-post, to which,
in passing, he breathed an excuse, for how could he break away
when Rodney’s arm was actually linked in his? "You must not think
that I have any bitterness against her&mdash;far from it. It’s not
altogether her fault, poor girl. She lives, you know, one of those
odious, self-centered lives&mdash;at least, I think them odious for
a woman&mdash;feeding her wits upon everything, having control of everything,
getting far too much her own way at home&mdash;spoilt, in a sense,
feeling that every one is at her feet, and so not realizing how
she hurts&mdash;that is, how rudely she behaves to people who haven’t
all her advantages. Still, to do her justice, she’s no fool,"
he added, as if to warn Denham not to take any liberties. "She
has taste. She has sense. She can understand you when you talk
to her. But she’s a woman, and there’s an end of it," he added,
with another little chuckle, and dropped Denham’s arm.</p>

<p>"And did you tell her all this to-night?" Denham asked.</p>

<p>"Oh dear me, no. I should never think of telling Katharine the
truth about herself. That wouldn’t do at all. One has to be in
an attitude of adoration in order to get on with Katharine.</p>

<p>"Now I’ve learnt that she’s refused to marry him why don’t I
go home?"  Denham thought to himself. But he went on walking beside
Rodney, and for a time they did not speak, though Rodney hummed
snatches of a tune out of an opera by Mozart. A feeling of contempt
and liking combine very naturally in the mind of one to whom another
has just spoken unpremeditatedly, revealing rather more of his
private feelings than he intended to reveal. Denham began to wonder
what sort of person Rodney was, and at the same time Rodney began
to think about Denham.</p>

<p>"You’re a slave like me, I suppose?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A solicitor, yes."</p>

<p>"I sometimes wonder why we don’t chuck it. Why don’t you emigrate,
Denham? I should have thought that would suit you."</p>

<p>"I’ve a family."</p>

<p>"I’m often on the point of going myself. And then I know I couldn’t
live without this"&mdash;and he waved his hand towards the City of
London, which wore, at this moment, the appearance of a town cut
out of gray-blue cardboard, and pasted flat against the sky, which
was of a deeper blue.</p>

<p>"There are one or two people I’m fond of, and there’s a little
good music, and a few pictures, now and then&mdash;just enough to keep
one dangling about here. Ah, but I couldn’t live with savages!
Are you fond of books? Music? Pictures? D’you care at all for
first editions? I’ve got a few nice things up here, things I pick
up cheap, for I can’t afford to give what they ask."</p>

<p>They had reached a small court of high eighteenth-century houses,
in one of which Rodney had his rooms. They climbed a very steep
staircase, through whose uncurtained windows the moonlight fell,
illuminating the banisters with their twisted pillars, and the
piles of plates set on the window-sills, and jars half-full of
milk. Rodney’s rooms were small, but the sitting-room window looked
out into a courtyard, with its flagged pavement, and its single
tree, and across to the flat red-brick fronts of the opposite
houses, which would not have surprised Dr. Johnson, if he had
come out of his grave for a turn in the moonlight. Rodney lit
his lamp, pulled his curtains, offered Denham a chair, and, flinging
the manuscript of his paper on the Elizabethan use of Metaphor
on to the table, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh dear me, what a waste of time! But it’s over now, and so
we may think no more about it."</p>

<p>He then busied himself very dexterously in lighting a fire, producing
glasses, whisky, a cake, and cups and saucers. He put on a faded
crimson dressing-gown, and a pair of red slippers, and advanced
to Denham with a tumbler in one hand and a well-burnished book
in the other.</p>

<p>"The Baskerville Congreve," said Rodney, offering it to his guest.
"I couldn’t read him in a cheap edition."</p>

<p>When he was seen thus among his books and his valuables, amiably
anxious to make his visitor comfortable, and moving about with
something of the dexterity and grace of a Persian cat, Denham
relaxed his critical attitude, and felt more at home with Rodney
than he would have done with many men better known to him. Rodney’s
room was the room of a person who cherishes a great many personal
tastes, guarding them from the rough blasts of the public with
scrupulous attention. His papers and his books rose in jagged
mounds on table and floor, round which he skirted with nervous
care lest his dressing-gown might disarrange them ever so slightly.
On a chair stood a stack of photographs of statues and pictures,
which it was his habit to exhibit, one by one, for the space of
a day or two. The books on his shelves were as orderly as regiments
of soldiers, and the backs of them shone like so many bronze beetle-wings;
though, if you took one from its place you saw a shabbier volume
behind it, since space was limited. An oval Venetian mirror stood
above the fireplace, and reflected duskily in its spotted depths
the faint yellow and crimson of a jarful of tulips which stood
among the letters and pipes and cigarettes upon the mantelpiece.
A small piano occupied a corner of the room, with the score of
"Don Giovanni" open upon the bracket.</p>

<p>"Well, Rodney," said Denham, as he filled his pipe and looked
about him, "this is all very nice and comfortable."</p>

<p>Rodney turned his head half round and smiled, with the pride
of a proprietor, and then prevented himself from smiling.</p>

<p>"Tolerable," he muttered.</p>

<p>"But I dare say it’s just as well that you have to earn your
own living."</p>

<p>"If you mean that I shouldn’t do anything good with leisure if
I had it, I dare say you’re right. But I should be ten times as
happy with my whole day to spend as I liked."</p>

<p>"I doubt that," Denham replied.</p>

<p>They sat silent, and the smoke from their pipes joined amicably
in a blue vapor above their heads.</p>

<p>"I could spend three hours every day reading Shakespeare," Rodney
remarked. "And there’s music and pictures, let alone the society
of the people one likes."</p>

<p>"You’d be bored to death in a year’s time."</p>

<p>"Oh, I grant you I should be bored if I did nothing. But I should
write plays."</p>

<p>"H’m!"</p>

<p>"I should write plays," he repeated. "I’ve written three-quarters
of one already, and I’m only waiting for a holiday to finish it.
And it’s not bad&mdash;no, some of it’s really rather nice."</p>

<p>The question arose in Denham’s mind whether he should ask to
see this play, as, no doubt, he was expected to do. He looked
rather stealthily at Rodney, who was tapping the coal nervously
with a poker, and quivering almost physically, so Denham thought,
with desire to talk about this play of his, and vanity unrequited
and urgent. He seemed very much at Denham’s mercy, and Denham
could not help liking him, partly on that account.</p>

<p>"Well,... will you let me see the play?" Denham asked, and Rodney
looked immediately appeased, but, nevertheless, he sat silent
for a moment, holding the poker perfectly upright in the air,
regarding it with his rather prominent eyes, and opening his lips
and shutting them again.</p>

<p>"Do you really care for this kind of thing?" he asked at length,
in a different tone of voice from that in which he had been speaking.
And, without waiting for an answer, he went on, rather querulously:
"Very few people care for poetry. I dare say it bores you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Denham remarked.</p>

<p>"Well, I’ll lend it you," Rodney announced, putting down the
poker.</p>

<p>As he moved to fetch the play, Denham stretched a hand to the
bookcase beside him, and took down the first volume which his
fingers touched. It happened to be a small and very lovely edition
of Sir Thomas Browne, containing the "Urn Burial," the "Hydriotaphia,"
and the "Garden of Cyrus," and, opening it at a passage which
he knew very nearly by heart, Denham began to read and, for some
time, continued to read.</p>

<p>Rodney resumed his seat, with his manuscript on his knee, and
from time to time he glanced at Denham, and then joined his finger-tips
and crossed his thin legs over the fender, as if he experienced
a good deal of pleasure. At length Denham shut the book, and stood,
with his back to the fireplace, occasionally making an inarticulate
humming sound which seemed to refer to Sir Thomas Browne. He put
his hat on his head, and stood over Rodney, who still lay stretched
back in his chair, with his toes within the fender.</p>

<p>"I shall look in again some time," Denham remarked, upon which
Rodney held up his hand, containing his manuscript, without saying
anything except&mdash;"If you like."</p>

<p>Denham took the manuscript and went. Two days later he was much
surprised to find a thin parcel on his breakfast-plate, which,
on being opened, revealed the very copy of Sir Thomas Browne which
he had studied so intently in Rodney’s rooms. From sheer laziness
he returned no thanks, but he thought of Rodney from time to time
with interest, disconnecting him from Katharine, and meant to
go round one evening and smoke a pipe with him. It pleased Rodney
thus to give away whatever his friends genuinely admired. His
library was constantly being diminished.</p>
