<p>There were hopes until the following morning that Bob Budd might
have escaped the flood. The fact that one of the Piketon Rangers
had managed with help to extricate himself gave slight grounds
for belief that a second had been equally fortunate.</p>

<p>This hope grew less and less as the night passed, and the people
wandering up and down the valley, hallooing and calling the name
of Bob, received no response. Only a few retained the slightest
expectation of ever seeing him again.</p>

<p>Long before morning broke the flood had spent its force. Such
a vast outlet as the sweeping away of most of the bank was like
the sliding doors which admit passengers to the ferryboat. It
was of such extent that the supply quickly ran out.</p>

<p>In the middle of the valley, where the whole force of the torrent
was felt, large trees had been uprooted and hurled forward with
a momentum which helped to uproot others in turn.</p>

<p>The prodigious power rapidly diminished as the ground rose on
either side, until it was seen that the trunks were able to hold
their own. There was considerable dislocation of vegetation, so
to speak, but nothing to be compared to that in the middle of
the valley.</p>

<p>The sheet of water had been plentifully stocked with fish, which
were now scattered everywhere along the valley, napping in little
pools of water as they did on the muddy bottom of the pond itself.
It was a veritable picnic for the small boys.</p>

<p>Captain Jim Budd was on the ground as soon after he heard of
the loss of Bob as he could reach the place. He was thoughtful
enough to arrange matters so that his wife should learn nothing
of the occurrence until his return. He placed a trusted friend
on guard to keep busy mongers from her.</p>

<p>Captain Jim was the contrast of Mr. Wagstaff as regarded the
youth in whom he was interested. He proclaimed to every one that
Bob was not only the brightest, but the best principled boy in
Piketon and the neighborhood. Had he lived he would have made
his mark in the law or ministry or whatever profession he chose
to honor with his attention. He had always been truthful, honest,
and obedient, and his loss was in the nature of a general calamity.</p>

<p>It seems incredible that a man of sense should talk in this fashion,
and not only utter such words, but believe them. The reader, however,
who has heard other parents talk, can credit the statement that
such was the fact.</p>

<p>The first thing that Captain Jim did, after learning the facts,
was to offer a reward of one thousand dollars for the recovery
of the body of his nephew. No doubt, he said, the whole neighborhood
would insist on attending his remains to the grave, that they
might render a fitting tribute to one thus cut off in the prime
of his promising young manhood. The Captain, therefore, felt it
his duty to defer to so proper a desire. He would erect a monument
over the remains, to which parents might impressively point, as
they urged their offspring to emulate the virtues of Robert Budd.</p>

<p>The large reward offered for the recovery of the body resulted
in the employment of fully a hundred and sometimes more people,
who roamed up and down the narrow valley through which the flood
had swept from early morning until darkness forced a cessation
of the search.</p>

<p>Some three miles below the bursted dam the valley widened to
fully double its width. There naturally the current expanded and
lost the tremendous power displayed above. Most of this portion,
like the rest, was covered with trees, so that places innumerable
existed where a body might be hidden, thus making it almost impossible
to find it unless by a fortunate accident.</p>

<p>The surprise was general that the search should be prosecuted
so long and so thoroughly without result. It seemed that every
foot of ground had been covered and no spot left unvisited. The
bushy tops of trees, prostrate trunks, timbers, undergrowth, shrubbery,
rifts of leaves, and, indeed, everything that looked as if it
could hide a body as large as a dog were examined again and again,
but without the slightest success.</p>

<p>An excitement was roused by the report, the second day after
the search had been instituted, that the body had been recovered,
but it proved to be the remains of a heifer that was unfortunately
caught in the swirl and was unable to save herself.</p>

<p>Gradually the belief spread that Bob Budd’s remains would never
be found, and most of the searchers gave up the task. A few, prompted
by the promise of a still larger reward, kept at it, hoping that
some lucky chance might give them the opportunity to earn more
money than they could do otherwise in several years.</p>

<p>The disappointment was a sorrowful one to Captain Jim Budd and
his wife Ruth, the news having been broken to the latter. They
could not reconcile themselves to the thought that their beloved
nephew should be denied the last rites that were paid to the humblest
individual; and while all knew the character of the missing young
man, they deeply pitied his relatives.</p>

<p>Dick Halliard returned to his duties in the store of Mr. Hunter
more thoughtful than ever before. He was grateful that McGovern
had shown so strong a resolution of reforming his life and turning
from his evil ways, but it was shocking to recall that Wagstaff
and Bob Budd were placed beyond the power of undoing the evil
they had committed.</p>

<p>Bob, as we have shown, was a native of Piketon, and had spent
most of his life there. He was an only son, who was left a considerable
fortune by his father, who appointed Uncle Jim Budd his guardian.
This old gentleman, though he sometimes flared up and threatened
Bob because of his extravagance and waywardness, was foolishly
indulgent. Whatever firmness he might have shown at times in dealing
with his nephew was spoiled by his wife, who refused the young
man nothing that was in her power to grant. Bob was not naturally
vicious, and his relatives were largely responsible for his going
wrong.</p>

<p>One cause for deep satisfaction on the part of Dick was the wonderful
proof of the truth of the words spoken by Dr. Armstrong, when
the youth summoned him hastily to the bedside of his parent. From
that evening there was a marked improvement in his condition,
and his convalescence was steady until, in the course of a few
months, he was completely restored to health and vigor.</p>

<p>After thinking over the question for a day or two, Dick decided
to tell his parents everything. They had learned of what had occurred,
and he believed it would be a pleasure to them to be told that
one result of the blow was the reformation of McGovern.</p>

<p>Such was the fact, but the greatest happiness that could come
to the father and mother was that of learning the nobility of
their boy, who had conducted himself so admirably through more
than one crisis, more trying than most youths older than he are
ever called upon to face.</p>

<p>Matters stood thus at the end of a week after the flood, when
Dick Halliard was surprised by the reception of a letter from
New York. He did not recognize the handwriting, and broke the
seal with no little curiosity. A glance at the bottom of the page
showed the name of Jim McGovern as the writer.</p>

<p>"My dear Dick," he said, after giving the particulars of the
funeral over the remains of Wagstaff, "I can never tell you how
deeply grateful I am to you; I am not one of those who gush, and
will not say more except to repeat a remark which my father made
when I had told him all. ‘There is no earthly honor,’ said he,
‘which could be given me, that I would not surrender for the sake
of having a son like Richard Halliard.’ Considered strictly as
a compliment, I think you will admit, Dick, that <em>that</em>
has some weight. I know your modesty, but I must beg you as a
favor to me to read all my letter up to this point, when you must
stop, for here comes something which is a secret for the present
between you and me. You will not give a hint of it to any one.</p>

<p>"Come to think, however, there is no secret that I’m going to
reveal in the letter, but I will tell you the next time we meet
that will make your hair lift your hat. I want you to get permission
right away from Mr. Hunter to come to New York for a couple of
days. Telegraph me what time you will reach here, and I will meet
you at the station and take you home. If anything should happen
to prevent my being there on time come to No. — Madison Avenue,
give your name, and wait for me. My folks will be delighted to
receive you, and you will not be kept long waiting.</p>

<p>"I have arranged to enter Yale at the next term. I shall need
to brush up in my studies, but I’m confident I’ll get there all
the same, if you’ll excuse a little slang which still clings to
me. But above all things, come to New York <em>as soon as you
can</em>. I promise you will not regret it."</p>

<p>As may be supposed, Dick Halliard found more than one cause for
surprise in this letter. The first was the fact that the writer
possessed a much better education than he suspected. The composition
was not only correct as regards grammar, punctuation, and spelling,
but the statement of his decision to enter Yale College showed
the advantages the youth had received, and which were far superior
to what would be supposed by one who heard McGovern discourse
when a member of the Piketon Rangers.</p>

<p>But Dick was shrewd, and, although he respected the request of
the writer that nothing should be revealed about the letter, he
suspected the nature of the "secret" to which he referred in such
strong language.</p>

<p>"Jim is in the flush of a mistaken sense of gratitude to me,"
he said to himself, "and he has persuaded his father to feel very
much the same way. They want to get me down there to their home,
that they may all see and tell me how thankful they are, and perhaps
they mean to make me a present of some kind. I don’t think I’ll
go."</p>

<p>Nothing could be more distasteful to young Halliard than a proceeding
of the kind he had in mind. It is no misstatement to say that
he would have preferred to receive personal chastisement to that
of being made a lion of by any one.</p>

<p>And yet he disliked to disappoint Jim, who was so strenuous in
his invitation. He would be grieved and repeat it more urgently
than before until further refusal would offend him.</p>

<p>"I’ll go!" finally concluded the youth, "but I will give Jim
to understand from the beginning that, if he attempts to show
me off or to tell others anything about me, or tries to force
a testimonial on me, I will take the next train home and forever
afterward keep him at arm’s length."</p>

<p>With this resolution in his mind, he went to Mr. Hunter’s private
office and asked him whether he could be spared from the store
a couple of days.</p>

<p>"We should miss you at <em>any</em> time," said the genial merchant,
resting his hand affectionately on his shoulder; "but there is
no request that Richard Halliard can make of me which I will not
cheerfully grant if it is in my power to do so. Yes, take a couple
of days off, and a week if you wish, and may you have as good
a time as you deserve, young man."</p>

<p>Dick blushed under this warm compliment, and, thanking his employer,
went home, where he told his parents of McGovern’s request, and
secured their consent to his departure.</p>

<p>Jim met him at the station with a carriage, and drove him hurriedly
homeward. After the warm greeting Dick wanted to warn him about
the lion and testimonial business, but reflected that it would
be in bad taste, since it was possible that Jim held no such intentions.
In that event he would resemble the politician who declines the
honor that has never been offered him.</p>

<p>McGovern seemed restless and uneasy on the way, often forcing
an unnatural gayety, which did not deceive his friend, of whom
he showed such extreme fondness.</p>

<p>Dick admired the handsome residence before which the carriage
halted, and it was with considerable awe that he followed Jim
up the broad stone steps, and was ushered into his father’s library.
McGovern showed commendable taste in not presenting his visitor
to the members of the household immediately on his arrival.</p>

<p>"But I have a friend in the library," he said, as he led the
way thither, "that I think you will be glad to meet."</p>

<p>A young man rose to his feet, and came briskly forward.</p>

<p>"How are you, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Heaven save me!" gasped Dick Halliard, in amazement, recognizing
the smiling youth as no other than Bob Budd himself!</p>
