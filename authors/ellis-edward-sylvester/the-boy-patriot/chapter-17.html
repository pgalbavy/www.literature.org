Each kind affection nature gives<br/>

As sunshine on the landscape falls,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And beautifies with light.

<p>The patriot had hitherto been sleeping in the heart of Derry
Duck; but now he was to awake like a "strong man armed." There
is not one kindly, pleasant, honorable feeling, but is strengthened
and ennobled by the touch of divine grace. Nor only so: he who
finds himself suddenly alive to his allegiance to God, has at
the same time his vision cleared to see around him a thousand
hitherto unknown or neglected ties, which bind him to his fellow-men.
In a whisper of conscience, he is taught that</p>

<p>  He is the faithful patriot,    Who keeps his Maker's laws;  
Nor will the servant of his Lord    Forsake his country's cause.</p>

<p>Among the sins of which Derry Duck was called deeply to repent,
was the dishonor which he had brought on his own Christian land,
in many a port where his wild deeds had left their guilty trace.
What had he done for the glory of Christian America? Bravely he
had fought under her flag; but it had been through reckless daring,
or a thirst for gold. Not for a noble principle, not for the defence
of home and kindred, altar and hearth-stone, had he raised his
strong right arm.</p>

<p>Blair Robertson rejoiced to see the spirit of true patriotism
awaking in the bosom of the hardy sailor. The high-souled boy
had now a sharer in his enthusiastic love of his country, and
devotion to her cause. They joined their labors at once to improve
the defenders of the flag, who were their shipmates, and yet a
disgrace to their native land. Blair went on in his own peculiar
way; while Derry at once announced his position as a Christian
mate, who would suffer no profanity in his hearing, and would
see the crew of the Molly engage in no deeds on the high seas,
not sanctioned by the letters of marque which were their warrant
for their blows struck against the common foe.</p>

<p>Some outward change had been produced in the men of the privateer,
when all thoughts were suddenly turned into a new channel. A fast
sailing American merchant ship informed Captain Knox that the
expected East Indiaman was not more than half a day behind her.</p>

<p>All was at once stir and bustle from stem to stern of the Molly.
The sturdy little craft was like the bristling porcupine, ready
and impatient for action, when the masts of the East Indiaman
slowly rose above the horizon. The privateer gave chase at once,
and rapidly neared its prey. The guns of the Molly gave the signal
for surrender. The British flag went down, and Derry Duck, with
a strong party of boarders was sent at once to seize the valuable
prize.</p>

<p>Ready to pounce on their defenceless victims, the eager sailors
climbed the sides of the huge vessel and stood upon its deck,
cutlass and pistol in hand. Suddenly the hatchways were thrown
open, and a band of British soldiers sprang forth with a fierce
battle-cry. Derry Duck rushed among them with desperate valor,
and was heartily seconded by his fearless followers.</p>

<p>From the deck of the Molly, Captain Knox could see the trap into
which he had fallen. He could not use his well-loaded guns without
destruction to his own men. He could only send reinforcements
to their small band, and quietly see the battle fought hand to
hand, which a few cannon balls would have settled in a moment.</p>

<p>Several skilful British marksmen were firing at the few who remained
on the approaching privateer, when Captain Knox ordered Blair
aloft.</p>

<p>Blair obeyed without a moment's hesitation, and sped upward as
if in the glee of boyhood's play. Yet in the heart of the young
patriot there was prayer for his soul, should it be set free in
that hour of danger; there was burning love for his country's
cause. The eye of Derry Duck fell on the isolated group who had
been firing at the privateer. He saw a well-known form climbing
to the dizzy masthead, while the shot were flying around him.
Derry rushed in among them with his axe in his hand, and waving
it around his head scattered them like leaves before the wind.
He stayed long enough to see that Blair had not dropped like a
wounded bird among the rigging of the Molly.</p>

<p>Slowly, very slowly, the boy made his way to the deck, then sank
down faint and bleeding. A bullet had entered his side; yet he
had been so ready for the stroke that it had not thrown him off
his guard. Although weak and giddy, he had made his way down his
narrow pathway, and reported his duty done. Even the hardy captain
gave a pitying glance at the brave boy as he was borne below by
the sailors. Yet this was no time for such thoughts in the mind
of Captain Knox. The reinforcement from the Molly were on the
deck of the East Indiaman. He could hear the hearty cheer of Derry
Duck as he placed himself at their head, and rushed upon the brave
Britons.</p>

<p>Derry's impetuous charge was too much for the soldiers, many
of them enfeebled by the climate of India, and going home to recruit
in their native breezes. Over the deck swept Derry and his band
like a fierce hurricane, which naught can stay or withstand. A
shout of victory went up from the Molly, a shout which Derry's
excited men sent back over the water in a deafening reply. The
East Indiaman was won; her crew were prisoners; her cargo the
prize of the Molly.</p>

<p>Where was Blair Robertson amid the general triumph? This was
Derry Duck's first question, as his returning footsteps again
trod the deck of the privateer.</p>

<p>Alone in the deserted cabin, Derry found what was more precious
to him now than his share in the glory or the spoils of the recent
fight.</p>

<p>The rough sailor asked no questions of the fainting lad. Tearing
open Blair's garments, he found at once the wound, and with ready
skill and unwavering firmness his sharp knife did the surgeon's
duty. The bullet was forced out by Derry's hard fingers, and his
rough hands tied the bandage with a touching attempt at tenderness.
Blair uttered no murmur. His lips moved gently, but they whispered
only words befitting the sinner passing into the presence of his
God.</p>

<p>Derry caught the low whisper, and understood its meaning. "I
can't let you go. What! going? Oh my lad!" and Derry Duck's hard,
blood-marked face was suddenly wet with tears.</p>
