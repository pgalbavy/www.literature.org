<p>She awoke tired; she had scarcely closed her eyes that night.
The fresh odour of roses filled her room when her maid arrived
with morning gifts from Kathleen and Scott.</p>

<p>She lay abed until noon. They started dressing her about three.
After that the day became unreal to her.</p>

<p>Manhattan was conventionally affable to Geraldine Seagrave, also
somewhat curious to see what she looked like. Fifth Avenue and
the neighbouring side streets were jammed with motors and carriages
on the bright January afternoon that Geraldine made her bow, and
the red and silver drawing-rooms, so famous a generation ago,
were packed continually.</p>

<p>What people saw was a big, clumsy house expensively overdecorated
in the appalling taste of forty years ago, now screened by forests
of palms and vast banks of flowers; and they saw a number of people
popularly identified with the sort of society which newspapers
delight to revere; and a few people of real distinction; and a
young girl, noticeably pale, standing beside Kathleen Severn and
receiving the patronage of dowagers and beaux, and the impulsive
clasp of fellowship from fresh-faced young girls and nice-looking,
well-mannered young fellows.</p>

<p>The general opinion seemed to be that Geraldine Seagrave possessed
all the beauty which rumour had attributed to her as her right
by inheritance, but the animation of her clever mother was lacking.
Also, some said that her manners still smacked of the nursery;
and that, unless it had been temporarily frightened out of her,
she had little personality and less charm.</p>

<p>Nothing, as a matter of fact, had been frightened out of her;
for weeks she had lived in imagination so vividly through that
day that when the day really arrived it found her physically and
mentally unresponsive; the endless reiteration of names sounded
meaninglessly in her ears, the crowding faces blurred. She was
passively satisfied to be there, and content with the touch of
hands and the pleasant-voiced formalities of people pressing toward
her from every side.</p>

<p>Afterward few impressions remained; she remembered the roses'
perfume, and a very fat woman with a confusing similarity of contour
fore and aft who blocked the lines and rattled on like a machine-gun
saying dreadfully frank things about herself, her family, and
everybody she mentioned.</p>

<p>Naïda Mallett, whom she had not seen in many years, she had known
immediately, and now remembered. And Naïda had taken her white-gloved
hand shyly, whispering constrained formalities, then had disappeared
into the unreality of it all.</p>

<p>Duane, her old playmate, may have been there, but she could not
remember having seen him. There were so many, many youths of the
New York sort, all dressed alike, all resembling one another&mdash;many,
many people flowing past her where she stood submerged in the
silken ebb eddying around her.</p>

<p>These were the few hazy impressions remaining&mdash;she was recalling
them now while dressing for her first dinner dance. Later, when
her maid released her with a grunt of Gallic disapproval, she,
distraite, glanced at her gown in the mirror, still striving to
recall something definite of the day before.</p>

<p>"<em>Was</em> Duane there?" she asked Kathleen, who had just
entered.</p>

<p>"No, dear.... Why did you happen to think of Duane Mallett?"</p>

<p>"Naïda came.... Duane was such a splendid little boy.... I had
hoped&#11834;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Severn said coolly:</p>

<p>"Duane isn't a very splendid man. I might as well tell you now
as later."</p>

<p>"What in the world do you mean, Kathleen?"</p>

<p>"I mean that people say he was rather horrid abroad. Some women
don't mind that sort of thing, but I do."</p>

<p>"Horrid? How?"</p>

<p>"He went about Europe with unpleasant people. He had too much
money&mdash;and that is ruinous for a boy. I hate to disillusion you,
but for several years people have been gossipping about Duane
Mallett's exploits abroad; and they are not savoury."</p>

<p>"What were they? I am old enough to know."</p>

<p>"I don't propose to tell you. He was notoriously wild. There
were scandals. Hush! here comes Scott."</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, pinch some colour into your cheeks!" exclaimed
her brother; "we're not going to a wake!"</p>

<p>And Kathleen said anxiously: "Your gown is perfection, dear;
are you a trifle tired? You do look pale."</p>

<p>"Tired?" repeated Geraldine&mdash;"not in the least, dearest.... If
I seem not to be excited, I really am, internally; but perhaps
I haven't learned how to show it.... Don't I look well? I was
so preoccupied with my gown in the mirror that I forgot to examine
my face."</p>

<p>Mrs. Severn kissed her. "You and your gown are charming. Come,
we are late, and that isn't permitted to débutantes."</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Magnelius Grandcourt who was giving the first dinner
and dance for Geraldine Seagrave. In the cloak-room she encountered
some very animated women of the younger married set, who spoke
to her amiably, particularly a Mrs. Dysart, who said she knew
Duane Mallett, and who was so friendly that a bit of colour warmed
Geraldine's pallid cheeks and still remained there when, a few
minutes later, she saluted her heavily jewelled hostess and recognised
in her the fat fore-and-aft lady of the day before.</p>

<p>Mrs. Magnelius Grandcourt, glittering like a South American scarab,
detained her with the smallest and chubbiest hands she had ever
seen inside of gloves.</p>

<p>"My dear, you look ghastly," said her hostess. "You're probably
scared to death. This is my son, Delancy, who is going to take
you in, and I'm wondering about you, because Delancy doesn't get
on with débutantes, but that can't be helped. If he's pig enough
not to talk to you, it wouldn't surprise me&mdash;and it's just as
well, too, for if he likes anybody he compromises them, but it's
no use your ever liking a Grandcourt, for all the men make rotten
husbands &mdash;I'm glad Rosalie Dysart threw him over for poor
Jack Dysart; it saved her a divorce! I'd get one if I could; so
would Magnelius. My husband was a judge once, but he resigned
because he couldn't send people up for the things he was doing
himself."</p>

<p>Mrs. Grandcourt, still gabbling away, turned to greet new arrivals,
merely switching to another subject without interrupting her steady
stream of outrageous talk. She was celebrated for it&mdash;and for
nothing else.</p>

<p>Geraldine, bewildered and a little horrified, looked at her billowy,
bediamonded hostess, then at young Delancy Grandcourt, who, not
perceptibly abashed by his mother's left-handed compliments, lounged
beside her, apparently on the verge of a yawn.</p>

<p>"My mother says things," he explained patiently; "nobody minds
'em.... Shall we exchange nonsense&mdash;or would you rather save yourself
until dinner?"</p>

<p>"Save myself what?" she asked nervously.</p>

<p>"The nuisance of talking to me about nothing. I'm not clever."</p>

<p>Geraldine reddened.</p>

<p>"I don't usually talk about nothing."</p>

<p>"I do," he said. "I never have much to say."</p>

<p>"Is that because you don't like débutantes?" she asked coldly.</p>

<p>"It's because they don't care about me.... If you would talk
to me, I'd really be grateful."</p>

<p>He flushed and stepped back awkwardly to allow room for a slim,
handsome man to pass between them. The very ornamental man did
not pass, however, but calmly turned toward Geraldine, and began
to talk to her.</p>

<p>She presently discovered his name to be Dysart; and she also
discovered that Mr. Dysart didn't know her name; and, for a moment
after she had told him, surprise and a confused sense of resentment
silenced her, because she was quite certain now that they had
never been properly presented.</p>

<p>That negligence of conventions was not unusual in this new world
she was entering, she had already noticed; and this incident was
evidently another example of custom smilingly ignored. She looked
up questioningly, and Dysart, instantly divining the trouble,
laughed in his easy, attractive fashion&mdash;the fashion he usually
affected with women.</p>

<p>"You seemed so fresh and cool and sweet all alone in this hot
corner that I simply couldn't help coming over to hear whether
your voice matched the ensemble. And it surpasses it. Are you
going to be resentful?"</p>

<p>"I'm too ignorant to be&mdash;or to laugh about it as you do.... Is
it because I look a simpleton that you come to see if I really
am?"</p>

<p>"Are you planning to punish me, Miss Seagrave?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't know how."</p>

<p>"Fate will, anyway, unless I am placed next you at dinner," he
said with his most reassuring smile, and rose gracefully.</p>

<p>"I'm going to fix it," he added, and, pushing his way toward
his hostess, disappeared in the crush.</p>

<p>Later young Grandcourt reappeared from the crush to take her
in. Every table seated eight, and, sure enough, as she turned
involuntarily to glance at her neighbour on the right, it was
Dysart's pale face, cleanly cut as a cameo, that met her gaze.
He nodded back to her with unfeigned satisfaction at his own success.</p>

<p>"That's the way to manage," he said, "when you want a thing very
much. Isn't it, Miss Seagrave?"</p>

<p>"You did not ask me whether I wanted it," she said.</p>

<p>"Don't you want me here? If you don't&mdash;" His features fell and
he made a pretence of rising. His pale, beautifully sculptured
face had become so fearfully serious that she coloured up quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you <em>wouldn't</em> do such a thing&mdash;now! to embarrass
me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I would &mdash;I'd do anything desperate."</p>

<p>But she had already caught the flash of mischief, and realising
that he had been taking more or less for granted in tormenting
her, looked down at her plate and presently tasted what was on
it.</p>

<p>"I know you are not offended," he murmured. "Are you?"</p>

<p>She knew she was not, too; but she merely shrugged. "Then why
do you ask me, Mr. Dysart?"</p>

<p>"Because you have such pretty shoulders," he replied seriously.</p>

<p>"What an idiotic reply to make!"</p>

<p>"Why? Don't you think you have?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Pretty shoulders."</p>

<p>"I don't think anything about my shoulders!"</p>

<p>"You would if there was anything the matter with them," he insisted.</p>

<p>Once or twice he turned his handsome dark gaze on her while she
was dissecting her terrapin.</p>

<p>"They tip up a little&mdash;at the corners, don't they?" he inquired
anxiously. "Does it hurt?"</p>

<p>"Tip up? What tips up?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Your eyes."</p>

<p>She swung around toward him, confused and exasperated; but no
seriousness was proof against the delighted malice in Dysart's
face; and she laughed a little, and laughed again when he did.
And she thought that he was, perhaps, the handsomest man she had
ever seen. All débutantes did.</p>

<p>Young Grandcourt turned from the pretty, over-painted woman who,
until that moment, had apparently held him interested when his
food failed to monopolise his attention, and glanced heavily around
at Geraldine.</p>

<p>All he saw was the back of her head and shoulders. Evidently
she was not missing him. Evidently, too, she was having a very
good time with Dysart.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing about?" he asked wistfully, leaning forward
to see her face.</p>

<p>Geraldine glanced back across her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dysart is trying to be impertinent," she replied carelessly;
and returned again to the impertinent one, quite ready for more
torment now that she began to understand how agreeable it was.</p>

<p>But Dysart's expression had changed; there was something vaguely
caressing in voice and manner as he murmured:</p>

<p>"Do you know there is something almost divine in your face."</p>

<p>"What did you say?" asked Geraldine, looking up from her ice
in its nest of spun sugar.</p>

<p>"You so strenuously reject the truthful compliments I pay you,
that perhaps I'd better not repeat this one."</p>

<p>"Was it really more absurd flattery?"</p>

<p>"No, never mind...." He leaned back in his chair, absently turning
the curious, heavily chiselled ring on his little finger, but
every few moments his expressive eyes reverted to her. She was
eating her ice with all the frank enjoyment of a schoolgirl.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Miss Seagrave, that you and I are really equipped
for better things than talking nonsense."</p>

<p>"I know that I am," she observed.... "Isn't this spun sugar delicious!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and so are you."</p>

<p>But she pretended not to hear.</p>

<p>He laughed, then fell silent; his dreamy gaze shifted from vacancy
to her&mdash;and, casually, across the room, where it settled lightly
as a butterfly on his wife, and there it poised for a moment's
inexpressive examination. Scott Seagrave was talking to Rosalie;
she did not notice her husband.</p>

<p>After that, with easy nonchalance approaching impudence, he turned
to his own neglected dinner partner, Sylvia Quest, who received
his tardy attentions with childish irritation. She didn't know
any better. And there was now no time to patch up matters, for
the signal to rise had been given and Dysart took Sylvia to the
door with genuine relief. She bored him dreadfully since she had
become sentimental over him. They always did.</p>

<p>Lounging back through the rising haze of tobacco-smoke he encountered
Peter Tappan and stopped to exchange a word.</p>

<p>"Dancing?" he inquired, lighting his cigarette.</p>

<p>Tappan nodded. "You, too, of course." For Dysart was one of those
types known in society as a "dancing man." He also led cotillions,
and a morally blameless life as far as the more virile Commandments
were concerned.</p>

<p>He said: "That little Seagrave girl is rather fetching."</p>

<p>Tappan answered indifferently:</p>

<p>"She resembles the general run of this year's output. She's weedy.
They all ought to marry before they go about to dinners, anyway."</p>

<p>"Marry whom?"</p>

<p>"Anybody &mdash;Delancy, here, for instance. You know as well
as I do that no woman is possible unless she's married," yawned
Tappan. "Isn't that so, Delancy?" clapping Grandcourt on the shoulder.</p>

<p>Grandcourt said "yes," to be rid of him; but Dysart turned around
with his usual smile of amused contempt.</p>

<p>"You think so, too, Delancy," he said, "because what is obvious
and ready-made appeals to you. You think as you eat&mdash;heavily&mdash;and
you miss a few things. That little Seagrave girl is charming.
But you'd never discover it."</p>

<p>Grandcourt slowly removed the fat cigar from his lips, rolled
it meditatively between thick forefinger and thumb:</p>

<p>"Do you know, Jack, that you've been saying that sort of thing
to me for a number of years?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and it's just as true now as it ever was, old fellow."</p>

<p>"That may be; but did it ever occur to you that I might get tired
hearing it.... And might, possibly, resent it some day?"</p>

<p>For a long time Dysart had been uncomfortably conscious that
Grandcourt had had nearly enough of his half-sneering, half-humourous
frankness. His liking for Grandcourt, even as a schoolboy, had
invariably been tinged with tolerance and good-humoured contempt.
Dysart had always led in everything; taken what he chose without
considering Grandcourt&mdash;sometimes out of sheer perversity, he
had taken what Grandcourt wanted&mdash;not really wanting it himself&mdash;as
in the case of Rosalie Dene.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about resenting?&mdash;my monopolising your
dinner partner?" asked Dysart, smiling. "Take her; amuse yourself.
I don't want her."</p>

<p>Grandcourt inspected his cigar again. "I'm tired of that sort
of thing, too," he said.</p>

<p>"What sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"Contenting myself with what you don't want."</p>

<p>Dysart lit a cigarette, still smiling, then shrugged and turned
as though to go. Around them through the smoke rose the laughing
clamour of young men gathering at the exit.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you something," said Grandcourt heavily. "I'm
an ass to do it, but I want to tell you."</p>

<p>Dysart halted patiently.</p>

<p>"It's this," went on Grandcourt: "between you and my mother,
I've never had a chance; she makes me out a fool and you have
always assumed it to be true."</p>

<p>Dysart glanced at him with amused contempt.</p>

<p>A heavy flush rose to Grandcourt's cheek-bones. He said slowly:</p>

<p>"I want my chance. You had better let me have it when it comes."</p>

<p>"What chance do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;a woman. All my life you've been at my elbow to step
in. You took what you wanted&mdash;your shadow always falls between
me and anybody I'm inclined to like.... It happened to-night&mdash;as
usual.... And I tell you now, at last, I'm tired of it."</p>

<p>"What a ridiculous idea you seem to have of me," began Dysart,
laughing.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid of you. I always was. Now&mdash;let me alone!"</p>

<p>"Have you ever known me, since I've been married&mdash;" He caught
Grandcourt's eye, stammered, and stopped short. Then: "You certainly
are absurd. Delancy! I wouldn't deliberately interfere with you
or disturb a young girl's peace of mind. The trouble with you
is&#11834;"</p>

<p>"The trouble with <em>you</em> is that women take to you very
quickly, and you are always trying to see how far you can arouse
their interest. What's the use of risking heartaches to satisfy
curiosity?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't have heartaches!" said Dysart, intensely amused.</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of you. I suppose that's the reason you find
it amusing.... Not that I think there's any real harm in you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Thanks," laughed Dysart; "it only needed that remark to damn
me utterly. Now go and dance with little Miss Seagrave, and don't
worry about my trying to interfere."</p>

<p>Grandcourt looked sullenly at him. "I'm sorry I spoke, now,"
he said. "I never know enough to hold my tongue to you."</p>

<p>He turned bulkily on his heel and left the dining-hall. There
were others, in throngs, leaving&mdash;young, eager-faced fellows,
with a scattering of the usual "dancing" men on whom everybody
could always count, and a few middle-aged gentlemen and women
of the younger married set to give stability to what was, otherwise,
a débutante's affair.</p>

<p>Dysart, strolling about, booked a dance or two, performed creditably,
made his peace, for the sake of peace, with Sylvia Quest, whose
ignorant heart had been partly awakened under his idle investigations.
But this was Sylvia's second season, and she would no doubt learn
several things of which she heretofore had been unaware. Just
at present, however, her heart was very full, and life's outlook
was indeed tragic to a young girl who believed herself wildly
in love with a married man, and who employed all her unhappy wits
in the task of concealing it.</p>

<p>A load of guilt lay upon her soul; the awful fact that she adored
him frightened her terribly; that she could not keep away from
him terrified her still more. But most of all she dreaded that
he might guess her secret.</p>

<p>"I don't know why you thought I minded your not&mdash;not talking
to me during dinner," she faltered. "I was having a perfectly
heavenly time with Peter Tappan."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that?" murmured Dysart. He could not help playing
his part, even when it no longer interested him. To murmur was
as natural to him as to breathe.</p>

<p>She looked up piteously. "I would rather have talked to you,"
she said. "Peter Tappan is only an overgrown boy. If you had really
cared to talk to me&mdash;" She checked herself, flushing deeply.</p>

<p>O Lord! he thought, contemplating in the girl's lifted eyes the
damage he had not really expected to do. For it had, as usual,
surprised him to realise, too late, how dangerous it is to say
too much, and look too long, and how easy it is to awaken hearts
asleep.</p>

<p>Dancing was to be general before the cotillion. Sylvia would
have given him as many dances as he asked for; he danced once
with her as a great treat, resolving never to experiment any more
with anybody.... True, it might have been amusing to see how far
he could have interested the little Seagrave girl&mdash;but he would
renounce that; he'd keep away from everybody.</p>

<p>But Dysart could no more avoid making eyes at anything in petticoats
than he could help the tenderness of his own smile or the caressing
cadence of his voice, or the subtle, indefinite something in him
which irritated men but left few women indifferent and some greatly
perturbed as he strolled along on his amusing journey through
the world.</p>

<p>He was strolling on now, having managed to leave Sylvia planted;
and presently, without taking any particular trouble to find Geraldine,
discovered her eventually as the centre of a promising circle
of men, very young men and very old men&mdash;nothing medium and desirable
as yet.</p>

<p>For a while, amused, Dysart watched her at her first party. Clearly
she was inexperienced; she let these men have their own way and
their own say; she was not handling them skilfully; yet there
seemed to be a charm about this young girl that detached man after
man from the passing throng and added them to her circle&mdash;which
had now become a half circle, completely cornering her.</p>

<p>Animated, shyly confident, brilliant-eyed, and flushed with the
excitement of attracting so much attention, she was beginning
to lose her head a little&mdash;just a little. Dysart noticed it in
her nervous laughter; in a slight exaggeration of gesture with
fan and flowers; in the quick movement of her restless little
head, as though it were incumbent upon her to give to every man
confronting her his own particular modicum of attention&mdash;which
was not like a débutante, either; and Dysart realised that she
was getting on.</p>

<p>So he sauntered up, breaking through the circle, and reminded
Geraldine of a dance she had not promised him.</p>

<p>She knew she had not promised, but she was quite ready to give
it&mdash;had already opened her lips to assent&mdash;when a young man, passing,
swung around abruptly as though to speak to her, hesitating as
Geraldine's glance encountered his without recognition.</p>

<p>But, as he started to move on, she suddenly knew him; and at
the same moment Kathleen's admonition rang in her ears. Her own
voice drowned it.</p>

<p>"Oh, Duane!" she exclaimed, stretching out her hand across Dysart's
line of advance.</p>

<p>"You <em>are</em> Geraldine Seagrave, are you not?" he asked
smilingly, retaining her hand in such a manner as practically
to compel her to step past Dysart toward him.</p>

<p>"Of course I am. You might have known me had you been amiable
enough to appear at my coming out."</p>

<p>He laughed easily, still retaining her hand and looking down
at her from his inch or two of advantage. Then he casually inspected
Dysart, who, not at all pleased, returned his gaze with a careless
unconcern verging on offence. Few men cared for Dysart on first
inspection&mdash;or on later acquaintance; Mallett was no exception.</p>

<p>Geraldine said, with smiling constraint:</p>

<p>"It has been so very jolly to see you again." And withdrew her
hand, adding: "I hope&mdash;some time&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Won't you let me talk to you now for a moment or two? You are
not going to dismiss me with that sort of come-back&mdash;after all
these years&mdash;are you?"</p>

<p>He seemed so serious about it that the girl coloured up.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>that is, Mr. Dysart was going to&mdash;to&mdash;" She turned
and looked at Dysart, who remained planted where she had left
him, exceedingly wroth at experiencing the sort of casual treatment
he had so often meted out to others. His expression was peevish.
Geraldine, confused, began hurriedly:</p>

<p>"I thought Mr. Dysart meant to ask me to dance."</p>

<p>"<em>Meant</em> to?" interrupted Mallett, laughing; "<em>I</em>
mean to ask for this dance, and I do."</p>

<p>Once more she turned and encountered Dysart's darkening gaze,
hesitated, then with a nervous, gay little gesture to him, partly
promise, partly adieu, she took Mallett's arm.</p>

<p>It was the first glimmer of coquetry she had ever deliberately
displayed; and at the same instant she became aware that something
new had been suddenly awakened in her&mdash;something which stole like
a glow through her veins, exciting her with its novelty.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she said, "that you have taken me forcibly away
from an exceedingly nice man?"</p>

<p>"I don't care."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;but might I not at least have been consulted?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you want to come?" he asked, stopping short. There was
something overbearing in his voice and his straight, unwavering
gaze.</p>

<p>She didn't know how to take it, how to meet it. Voice and manner
required some proper response which seemed to be beyond her experience.</p>

<p>She did not answer; but a slight pressure of her bare arm set
him in motion again.</p>

<p>The phenomenon interested her; to see what control over this
abrupt young man she really had she ventured a very slight retrograde
arm-pressure, then a delicate touch to right, to left, and forward
once more. It was most interesting; he backed up, guided right
and left, and started forward or halted under perfect control.
What had she been afraid of in him? She ventured to glance around,
and, encountering a warmly personal interest in his gaze, instantly
assumed that cold, blank, virginal mask which the majority of
young girls discard at her age.</p>

<p>However, her long-checked growth in the arts of womanhood had
already recommenced. She had been growing fast, feverishly, and
was just now passing that period where the desire for masculine
admiration innocently rules all else, but where the discovery
of it chills and constrains.</p>

<p>She passed it at that moment. The next time their glances met
she smiled a little. A new epoch in her life had begun.</p>

<p>"Where are you taking me?" she asked. "Are we not going to dance?"</p>

<p>"I thought we might sit out a dance or two in the conservatory&mdash;one
or two&#11834;"</p>

<p>"One," she said decidedly. "Here are some palms. Why not sit
here?"</p>

<p>There were a number of people about; she saw them, too, noted
his hesitation, understood it.</p>

<p>"We'll sit here," she said, and stood smilingly regarding him
while he lugged up two chairs to the most retired corner.</p>

<p>Slowly waving her fan, she seated herself and surveyed the room.</p>

<p>It is quite true that reunion after many years usually ends in
constraint and indifference. If she felt slightly bored, she certainly
looked it. Neither of them resembled the childish recollections
or preconceived notions of the other. They found themselves inspecting
one another askance, as though furtively attempting to surprise
some familiar feature, some resemblance to a cherished memory.</p>

<p>But the changes were too radical; their eyes, looking for old
comrades, encountered the unremembered eyes of strangers&mdash;for
they were strangers&mdash;this tall young man, with his gray eyes,
pleasantly fashioned mouth, and cleanly moulded cheeks; and this
long-limbed girl, who sat, knees crossed, one long, slim foot
nervously swinging above its shadow on the floor.</p>

<p>In spite of his youth there was in his manner, if not in his
voice, something tinged with fatigue. She thought of what Kathleen
had said about him; looked up, instinctively questioning him with
curious, uncomprehending eyes; then her gaze wandered, became
lost in smiling retrospection as she thought of Dysart, peevish;
and she frankly regretted him and his dance.</p>

<p>Young Mallett stirred, passed a rather bony hand over his shaven
upper lip, and said abruptly: "I never expected you'd grow up
like this. You've turned into a different kind of girl. Once you
were chubby of cheek and limb. Do you remember how you used to
fight?"</p>

<p>"Did I?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. You hit me twice in the eye because I lost my temper
sparring with Scott. Your hands were small but heavy in those
days.... I imagine they're heavier now."</p>

<p>She laughed, clasped both pretty hands over her knee, and tilted
back against the palm, regarding him from dark, velvety eyes.</p>

<p>"You were a curiously fascinating child," he said. "I remember
how fast you could run, and how your hair flew&mdash;it was thick and
dark, with rather sunny high lights; and you were always running&mdash;always
on the go.... You were a remarkably just girl; that I remember.
You were absolutely fair to everybody."</p>

<p>"I was a very horrid little scrub," she said, watching him over
her gently waving fan, "with a dreadful temper," she added.</p>

<p>"Have you it now?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I get over it quickly. Do you find Scott very much changed?"</p>

<p>"Well, not as much as you. Do you find Naïda changed?"</p>

<p>"Not nearly as much as you."</p>

<p>They smiled. The slight embarrassment born of polite indifference
brightened into amiable interest, tinctured by curiosity.</p>

<p>"Duane, have you been studying painting all these years?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What have you been doing all these years?"</p>

<p>"Nothing." A shadow fell across her face. "It has been lonely&mdash;until
recently. I began to live yesterday."</p>

<p>"You used to tell me you were lonely," he nodded.</p>

<p>"I was. You and Naïda were godsends." Something of the old thrill
stirred her recollection. She leaned forward, looking at him curiously;
the old memory of him was already lending him something of the
forgotten glamour.</p>

<p>"How tall you are!" she said; "how much thinner and&mdash;how very
impressively grown-up you are, Duane. I didn't expect you to be
entirely a man so soon&mdash;with such a&mdash;an odd&mdash;expression&#11834;"</p>

<p>He asked, smiling: "What kind of an expression have I, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"Not a boyish one; entirely a man's eyes and mouth and voice&mdash;a
little too wise, as though, deep inside, you were tired of something;
no, not exactly that, but as though you had seen many things and
had lived some of them&#11834;"</p>

<p>She checked herself, lips softly apart; and the memory of what
she had heard concerning him returned to her.</p>

<p>Confused, she continued to laugh lightly, adding: "I believe
I was afraid of you at first. Ought I to be, still? You know more
than I do&mdash;you know different kinds of things: your face and voice
and manner show it. I feel humble and ignorant in the presence
of so distinguished a European artist."</p>

<p>They were laughing together now without a trace of constraint;
and she was aware that his interest in her was unfeigned and unmistakably
the interest of a man for a woman, that he was looking at her
as other men had now begun to look at her, speaking as other men
spoke, frankly interested in her as a woman, finding her agreeable
to look at and talk to.</p>

<p>In the unawakened depths of her a conviction grew that her old
playmate must be classed with other men&mdash;man in the abstract&mdash;that
indefinite and interesting term, hinting of pleasures to come
and possibilities unimagined.</p>

<p>"Did you paint pictures all the time you were abroad?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Not every minute. I travelled a lot, went about, was asked to
shoot in England and Austria.... I had a good time."</p>

<p>"Didn't you work hard?"</p>

<p>"No. Isn't it disgraceful!"</p>

<p>"But you exhibited in three salons. What were your pictures?"</p>

<p>"I did a portrait of Lady Bylow and her ten children."</p>

<p>"Was it a success?"</p>

<p>He coloured. "They gave me a second medal."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad!" she exclaimed warmly. "And what were your
others?"</p>

<p>"A thing called 'The Witch.' Rather painful."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"Life size. A young girl arrested in bed. Her frightened beauty
is playing the deuce with the people around. I don't know why
I did it&mdash;the painting of textures&mdash;her flesh, and the armour
of the Puritan guard, the fur of the black cat&mdash;and&mdash;well, it
was academic and I was young."</p>

<p>"Did they reward you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What was the third picture?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just a girl," he said carelessly.</p>

<p>"Did they give you a prize for it?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes. Only a mention."</p>

<p>"Was it a portrait?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in a way."</p>

<p>"What was it? Just a girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Who was she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just a girl&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Was she pretty?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Shall we dance this next&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No. Was she a model?"</p>

<p>"She posed&#11834;"</p>

<p>Geraldine, lips on the edge of her spread fan, regarded him curiously.</p>

<p>"That is a very romantic life, isn't it?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Yours. I don't know much about it; Kathleen took me to hear
'La Bohême'; and I found Murger's story in the library. I have
also read 'Trilby.' Did <em>you</em>&mdash;were you&mdash;was life like
that when you studied in the Latin Quarter?"</p>

<p>He laughed. "Not a bit. I never saw that species of life off
the stage."</p>

<p>"Oh, wasn't there any romance?" she asked forlornly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;as much as you find in New York or anywhere."</p>

<p>"Is there any romance in New York?"</p>

<p>"There is anywhere, isn't there? If only one has the instinct
to recognise it and a capacity to comprehend it."</p>

<p>"Of course," she murmured, "there are artists and studios and
models and poverty everywhere.... I suppose that without poverty
real romance is scarcely possible."</p>

<p>He was still laughing when he answered:</p>

<p>"Financial conditions make no difference. Romance is in one's
self&mdash;or it is nowhere."</p>

<p>"Is it in&mdash;you?" she asked audaciously.</p>

<p>He made no pretence of restraining his mirth.</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know, Geraldine. Lots of people have the capacity
for it. Poverty, art, a studio, a velvet jacket, and models are
not essentials.... You ask if it is in <em>me</em>. I think it
is. I think it exists in anybody who can glorify the commonplace.
To make people look with astonished interest at something which
has always been too familiar to arrest their attention&mdash;only your
romancer can accomplish this."</p>

<p>"Please go on," she said as he ended. "I'm listening very hard.
You <em>are</em> glorifying commonplaces, you know."</p>

<p>They both laughed; he, a little red, disconcerted, piqued, and
withal charmed at her dainty thrust at himself.</p>

<p>"I <em>was</em> talking commonplaces," he admitted, "but how
was I to know enough not to? Women are usually soulfully receptive
when a painter opens a tin of mouldy axioms.... I didn't realise
I was encountering my peer&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You may be encountering more than that," she said, the excitement
of her success with him flushing her adorably.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've heard how terribly educated you and Scott are. No doubt
you can floor me on anything intellectual. See here, Geraldine,
it's simply wicked!&mdash;you are so soft and pretty, and nobody could
suspect you of knowing such a lot and pouncing out on a fellow
for trying a few predigested platitudes on you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I <em>don't</em> know <em>anything</em>, Duane! How perfectly
horrid of you!"</p>

<p>"Well, you've scared me!"</p>

<p>"I haven't. You're laughing at me. You know well enough that
I don't know the things you know."</p>

<p>"What are they, in Heaven's name?"</p>

<p>"Things&mdash;experiences&mdash;matters that concern life&mdash;the world, men,
everything!"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't be interesting if you knew such things," he said.
She thought there was the same curious hint of indifference, something
of listlessness, almost fatigue in the expression of his eyes.
And again, apparently apropos of nothing, she found herself thinking
of what Kathleen had said about this man.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," she said, looking at him.</p>

<p>He smiled, and the ghost of a shadow passed from his eyes.</p>

<p>"I was talking at random."</p>

<p>"I don't think you were."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, drawing a long, quiet breath. Silent, lips
resting in softly troubled curves, she thought of what Kathleen
had said about this man. <em>What</em> had he done to disgrace
himself?</p>

<p>A few moments later she rose with decision.</p>

<p>"Come," she said, unconsciously imperious.</p>

<p>He looked across the room and saw Dysart.</p>

<p>"But I haven't begun to tell you&mdash;" he began; and she interrupted
smilingly:</p>

<p>"I know enough about you for a while; I have learned that you
are a very wonderful young man and that I'm inclined to like you.
You will come to see me, won't you?... No, I can't remain here
another second. I want to go to Kathleen. I want you to ask her
to dance, too.... Please don't urge me, Duane. <em>I&mdash;</em>this
is my first dinner dance&mdash;yes, my very first. And I <em>don't</em>
intend to sit in corners &mdash;I wish to dance; I desire to be
happy. I want to see lots and lots of men, not just one.... You
don't know all the lonely years I must make up for every minute
now, or you wouldn't look at me in such a sulky, bullying way....
Besides&mdash;do you think I find you a compensation for all those
delightful people out yonder?"</p>

<p>He glanced up and saw Dysart still watching them. Suddenly he
dropped his hand over hers.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you may find that compensation in me some day," he said.
"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"What a silly thing to say! Don't paw me, Duane; you hurt my
hand. Look at what you've done to my fan!"</p>

<p>"It came between us. I'm sorry for anything that comes between
us."</p>

<p>Both were smiling fixedly; he said nothing for a moment; their
gaze endured until she flinched.</p>

<p>"Silly," she said, "you are trying to tyrannise over me as you
did when we were children. I remember now&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> did the bullying then."</p>

<p>"Did I? Then I'll continue."</p>

<p>"No, you won't; it's my turn."</p>

<p>"I will if I care to!"</p>

<p>"Try it."</p>

<p>"Very well. Take me to Kathleen."</p>

<p>"Not until I have the dances I want!"</p>

<p>Again their eyes met in silence. Dark little lights glimmered
in hers; his narrowed. The fixed smile died out.</p>

<p>"The dances <em>you</em> want!" she repeated. "How do you propose
to secure them? By crushing my fingers or dragging me about by
my hair? I want to tell you something, Duane: these blunt, masterful
men are very amusing on the stage and in fiction, but they're
not suitable to have tagging at heel&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I won't do any tagging at heel," he said; "don't count on it."</p>

<p>"I have no inclination to count on you at all," she retorted,
thoroughly irritated.</p>

<p>"You will have it some day."</p>

<p>"Oh! Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... I didn't mean to speak the way I did. Won't you give
me a dance or two?"</p>

<p>"No. I had no idea how horrid you could be.... I was told you
were.... Now I can believe it. Take me to Kathleen; do you hear
me?"</p>

<p>After a step or two he said, not looking at her:</p>

<p>"I'm really sorry, Geraldine. I'm not a brute. Something about
that fellow Dysart upset me."</p>

<p>"Please don't talk about it any more."</p>

<p>"No.... Only I <em>am</em> glad to see you again, and I do care
for your regard."</p>

<p>"Then earn it," she said unevenly, as her anger subsided. "I
don't know very much about men in the world, but I know enough
to understand when they're offensive."</p>

<p>"Was I?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... Because you carried me away with a high hand, you thought
it the easiest way to take with me on every occasion.... Duane,
do you know, in some ways, we are somewhat alike? And that is
why we used to fight so."</p>

<p>"I believe we are," he said slowly. "But &mdash;I was never able
to keep away from you."</p>

<p>"Which makes our outlook rather stormy, doesn't it?" she said,
turning to him with all of her old sweet friendly manner. "<em>Do</em>
let us agree, Duane. Mercy on us! we ought to adore each other&mdash;unless
we have forgotten the quarrelsome but adorable friendship of our
childhood. <em>I</em> thought you were the perfection of all boys."</p>

<p>"I thought there was no girl to equal you, Geraldine."</p>

<p>She turned audaciously, not quite knowing what she was saying:</p>

<p>"Think so now, Duane! It will be good for us both."</p>

<p>"Do you mean it?"</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;seriously," she said.... "And, Duane, please don't be too
serious with me. I am&mdash;you make me uncertain&mdash;you make me uncomfortable.
I don't know just what to say to you or just how it will be taken.
You mustn't be&mdash;that way&mdash;with <em>me</em>; you won't, will you?"</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment; then his face lighted up. "No," he
said, laughing; "I'll open another can of platitudes.... You're
a dear to forgive me."</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Dancing had been general before the cotillion; débutantes continued
to arrive in shoals from other dinners, a gay, rosy, eager throng,
filling drawing-rooms, conservatory, and library with birdlike
flutter and chatter, overflowing into the breakfast-room, banked
up on the stairs in bright-eyed battalions.</p>

<p>The cotillion, led by Jack Dysart dancing alone, was one of those
carefully thought out intellectual affairs which shakes New York
society to its intellectual foundations.</p>

<p>In one figure Geraldine came whizzing into the room in a Palm
Beach tricycle-chair trimmed with orchids and propelled by Peter
Tappan; and from her seat amid the flowers she distributed favours&mdash;live
white cockatoos, clinging, flapping, screeching on gilded wands;
fans spangled with tiny electric jewels; parasols of pink silk
set with incandescent lights; crystal cages containing great,
pale-green Luna moths alive and fluttering; circus hoops of gilt
filled with white tissue paper, through which the men jumped.</p>

<p>There was also a Totem-pole figure&mdash;and other things, including
supper and champagne, and the semi-obscurity of conservatory and
stairs; and there was the usual laughter to cover heart-aches,
and the inevitable torn gowns and crushed flowers; and a number
of young men talking too loud and too much in the cloak-room,
and Rosalie Dysart admitting to Scott Seagrave in the conservatory
that nobody really understood her; and Delancy Grandcourt edging
about the outer borders of the flowery, perfumed vortex, following
Geraldine and losing her a hundred times.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions she was captured by Duane Mallett and
convoyed to the supper-room, where later she became utterly transfigured
into a laughing, blushing, sparkling, delicious creature, small
ears singing with her first venturesome glass of champagne.</p>

<p>All the world seemed laughing with her; life itself was only
an endless bubble of laughter, swelling the gay, unending chorus;
life was the hot breeze from scented fans stirring a thousand
roses; life was the silken throng and its whirling and its feverish
voices crying out to her to live!</p>

<p>Her childhood's playmate had come back a stranger, but already
he was being transformed, through the magic of laughter, into
the boy she remembered; awkwardness of readjusting her relations
with him had entirely vanished; she called him dear Duane, laughed
at him, chatted with him, appealed, contradicted, rebuked, tyrannised,
until the young fellow was clean swept off his feet.</p>

<p>Then Dysart came, and for the second time the note of coquetry
was struck, clearly, unmistakably, through the tension of a moment's
preliminary silence; and Duane, dumb, furious, yielded her only
when she took Dysart's arm with a finality that became almost
insolent as she turned and looked back at her childhood's comrade,
who followed, scowling at Dysart's graceful back.</p>

<p>Confused by his hurt and his anger, which seemed out of all logical
proportion to the cause of it, he turned abruptly and collided
with Grandcourt, who had edged up that far, waiting for the opportunity
of which Dysart, as usual, robbed him.</p>

<p>Grandcourt apologised, muttering something about Mrs. Severn
wishing him to find Miss Seagrave. He stood, awkwardly, looking
after Geraldine and Dysart, but not offering to follow them.</p>

<p>"Lot of débutantes here&mdash;the whole year's output," he said vaguely.
"What a noisy supper-room&mdash;eh, Mallett? I'm rather afraid champagne
is responsible for some of it."</p>

<p>Duane started forward, halted.</p>

<p>"Did you say Mrs. Severn wants Miss Seagrave?"</p>

<p>"<em>Y&mdash;</em>yes.... I'd better go and tell her, hadn't I?"</p>

<p>He flushed heavily, but made no movement to follow Geraldine
and Dysart, who had now entered the conservatory and disappeared.</p>

<p>For a full minute, uncomfortably silent, the two men stood side
by side; then Duane said in a constrained voice:</p>

<p>"I'll speak to Miss Seagrave, if you'll find her brother and
Mrs. Severn"; and walked slowly toward the palm-set rotunda.</p>

<p>When he found them&mdash;and he found them easily, for Geraldine's
overexcited laughter warned and guided him &mdash;Dysart, her
fan in his hands, looked up at Duane intensely annoyed, and the
young girl tossed away a half-destroyed rose and glanced up, the
laughter dying out from lips and eyes.</p>

<p>"Kathleen sent for you," said Duane drily.</p>

<p>"I'll come in a minute, Duane."</p>

<p>"In a moment," repeated Dysart insolently, and turned his back.</p>

<p>The colour surged into Mallett's face; he turned sharply on his
heel.</p>

<p>"Wait!" said Geraldine; "Duane&mdash;do you hear me?"</p>

<p>"I'll take you back," began Dysart, but she passed in front of
him and laid her hand on Mallett's arm.</p>

<p>"Won't you wait for me, Duane?"</p>

<p>And suddenly things seemed to be as they had been in their childhood,
the resurgence swept them both back to the old and stormy footing
again.</p>

<p>"Duane!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I tell you to wait for me&mdash;<em>here</em>!" She stamped her foot.</p>

<p>He scowled&mdash;but waited. She turned on Dysart:</p>

<p>"Good-night!"&mdash;offering her hand with decision.</p>

<p>Dysart began: "But I had expected&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Good-night!</em>"</p>

<p>Dysart stared, took the offered hand, hesitated, started to speak,
thought better of it, made a characteristically graceful obeisance,
and an excellent exit, all things considered.</p>

<p>Geraldine drew a deep breath, moved forward through the flower-set
dimness a step or two, halted, and, as Mallett came up, passed
her arm through his.</p>

<p>"Duane," she said, "the champagne has gone to my head."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"It <em>has</em>! My cheeks are queer&mdash;the skin fits too tight.
My legs don't belong to me&mdash;but they'll do."</p>

<p>She laughed and turned toward him; her feverish breath touched
his cheek.</p>

<p>"My first dinner! Isn't it disgraceful? But how could I know?"</p>

<p>"You mustn't let it scare you."</p>

<p>"It doesn't. I don't care. I knew something would go wrong. <em>I&mdash;</em>the
truth is, that I don't know how to act&mdash;how to accept my liberty.
I don't know how to use it. I'm a perfect fool.... Do you think
Kathleen will notice this? Isn't it terrible! She never dreamed
I would touch any wine. Do I look&mdash;queer?"</p>

<p>"No. It isn't so, anyway&mdash;and you'll simply lean on me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, my knees are perfectly steady. It's only that they don't
seem to belong to me. I'm&mdash;I'm excited &mdash;I've laughed too
much&mdash;more than I have ever laughed in all the years of my life
put together. You don't know what I mean, do you, Duane? But it's
true; I've talked to-night more than I ever have in any one week....
And it's gone to my head&mdash;all this&mdash;all these people who laugh
with me over nothing&mdash;follow me, tell me I am pretty, ask me for
dances, favours, beg me for a word with them&mdash;as though I would
need asking or urging!&mdash;as though my impulse is not to open my
heart to every one of them&mdash;open my arms to them&mdash;thank them on
my knees for being here&mdash;for being nice to me&mdash;all these boys
who make little circles around me&mdash;so funny, so quaint in their
formality&#11834;"</p>

<p>She pressed his arm tighter.</p>

<p>"<em>Let</em> me rattle on&mdash;let me babble, Duane. I've years
of silence to make up for. Let me talk like a fool; <em>you</em>
know I'm not one.... Oh, the happiness of this one night!&mdash;the
happiness of it! I never shall have enough dancing, never enough
of pleasure.... I &mdash;I'm perfectly mad over pleasure; I like
men.... I suppose the champagne makes me frank about it&mdash;but I
don't care &mdash;I do like men&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>That</em> one?" demanded Mallett, halting her on the edge
of the palms which screened the conservatory doors.</p>

<p>"You mean Mr. Dysart? Yes &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>do like him."</p>

<p>"Well, he's married, and you'd better not," he snapped.</p>

<p>"C-can't I <em>like</em> him?" in piteous astonishment which
set the colour flying into his face.</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;of course &mdash;I didn't mean&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> did you mean? Isn't it&mdash;shouldn't he be&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right, Geraldine. Only he's a sort of a pig to
keep you away from&mdash;others&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Other&mdash;<em>pigs</em>?"</p>

<p>He turned sharply, seized her, and forcibly turned her toward
the light. She made no effort to control her laughter, excusing
it between breaths:</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to turn what you said into ridicule; it came out
before I meant it.... Do let me laugh a little, Duane. I simply
cannot care about anything serious for a while &mdash;I want to
be frivolous&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't laugh so loud," he whispered.</p>

<p>She released his arm and sank down on a marble seat behind the
flowering oleanders.</p>

<p>"Why are you so disagreeable?" she pouted. "I know I'm a perfect
fool, and the champagne has gone to my silly head&mdash;and you'll
never catch me this way again.... Don't scowl at me. Why don't
you act like other men? Don't you know how?"</p>

<p>"Know how?" he repeated, looking down into the adorably flushed
face uplifted. "Know how to do what?"</p>

<p>"To flirt. I don't. Everybody has tried to teach me to-night&mdash;everybody
except you ... Duane.... I'm ready to go home; I'll go. Only my
head is whirling so &mdash;Tell me&mdash;<em>are</em> you glad to see
me again?... Really?... And you don't mind my folly? And my tormenting
you?... And my&mdash;my turning <em>your</em> head a little?"</p>

<p>"You've done <em>that</em>," he said, forcing a laugh.</p>

<p>"Have I?... I knew it.... You see, I am horridly truthful to-night.
<em>In vino veritas!</em> ... Tell me&mdash;did I, all by myself, turn
that too-experienced head of yours?"</p>

<p>"You're doing it now," he said.</p>

<p>She laughed deliciously. "Now? Am I? Yes, I know I am. I've made
a lot of men think hard to-night.... I didn't know I could; I
never before thought of it.... And&mdash;even <em>you</em>, too?...
You're not very serious, are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. I tell you, Geraldine, I'm about as much in love
with you as&#11834;"</p>

<p>"In <em>love</em>!"</p>

<p>"Yes&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am&#11834;"</p>

<p>But she would not have it put so crudely.</p>

<p>"You dear boy," she said, "we'll both be quite sane to-morrow....
No, I don't mind your kissing my hand &mdash;I'm dreadfully tired,
anyway.... We'll find Kathleen, shall we? My head doesn't buzz
much."</p>

<p>"Geraldine," he said, deliberately encircling her waist, "you
are only the same small girl I used to know, after all."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Duane!' she gasped&mdash;'why did you?'"]</p>

<p>"Y-yes, I'm afraid so."</p>

<p>"And you're not really old enough to really care for anybody,
are you?"</p>

<p>"Care?"</p>

<p>"Love."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not. Don't talk to me that way, Duane."</p>

<p>He drew her suddenly into his arms and kissed her on the cheek
twice, and again on the mouth, as, crimson, breathless, she strained
away from him.</p>

<p>"Duane!" she gasped&mdash;"why did you?" Then the throbbing of her
body and crushed lips made her furious. "Why did you do that?"
she cried fiercely&mdash;but her voice ended in a dry sob; she covered
her head and face with bare arms; her hands tightened convulsively
and clenched.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "how could you!&mdash;when I came to you&mdash;feeling&mdash;afraid
of myself! I know you now. You are what they say you are."</p>

<p>"What do they say I am?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"Horrid&mdash;I don't know&mdash;wild!&mdash;whatever that implies.... I didn't
care &mdash;I didn't care even to understand, because I thought
you generous and nice to me&mdash;and I was so confident of you that
I came with you and told you I had had some champagne which made
my head swim.... And you&mdash;did this! It&mdash;it was contemptible."</p>

<p>He bit his lip, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Why did you do it?" she demanded, dropping her arms from her
face and staring at him. "Is that the sort of thing you did abroad?"</p>

<p>"Can't you see I'm in love with you?" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh! Is <em>that</em> love? Then keep it for your models and&mdash;and
Bohemian grisettes! A decent man couldn't have done such a thing
to me. I &mdash;I loathe myself for being silly and weak enough
to have touched that wine, but I have more contempt for you than
I have for myself. What you did was cowardly!"</p>

<p>Much of the colour had fled from her face; her eyes, bluish underneath
the lower lids, turned wearily, helplessly in search of Kathleen.</p>

<p>"I knew I was unfit for liberty," she said, half to herself.
"What an ending to my first pleasure!"</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, Geraldine," he broke out, "don't take an
accident so tragically&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Very well; I'll find her.... And, whatever you say or think,
I <em>am</em> in love with you," he added fiercely.</p>

of the heavy pulse in throat and temple, of the desire for her
room and darkness. Lights, music, the scent of dying flowers,
laughter, men, all had become abhorrent. Something within her
lay bruised and stunned; and, as never before, the vast and terrible
phantom of her loneliness rose like a nightmare to menace her.</p>

<p>Later Kathleen came and took her away.</p>
