<p><em>Part 1 - The Lord Advocate</em></p>
<p>The 25th day of August, 1751, about two in the afternoon, I,
David Balfour, came forth of the British Linen Company, a porter
attending me with a bag of money, and some of the chief of these
merchants bowing me from their doors. Two days before, and even
so late as yestermorning, I was like a beggar-man by the wayside,
clad in rags, brought down to my last shillings, my companion
a condemned traitor, a price set on my own head for a crime with
the news of which the country rang. To-day I was served heir to
my position in life, a landed laird, a bank porter by me carrying
my gold, recommendations in my pocket, and (in the words of the
saying) the ball directly at my foot.</p>

<p>There were two circumstances that served me as ballast to so
much sail. The first was the very difficult and deadly business
I had still to handle; the second, the place that I was in. The
tall, black city, and the numbers and movement and noise of so
many folk, made a new world for me, after the moorland braes,
the sea-sands and the still country-sides that I had frequented
up to then. The throng of the citizens in particular abashed me.
Rankeillor’s son was short and small in the girth; his clothes
scarce held on me; and it was plain I was ill qualified to strut
in the front of a bank-porter. It was plain, if I did so, I should
but set folk laughing, and (what was worse in my case) set them
asking questions. So that I behooved to come by some clothes of
my own, and in the meanwhile to walk by the porter’s side, and
put my hand on his arm as though we were a pair of friends.</p>

<p>At a merchant’s in the Luckenbooths I had myself fitted out:
none too fine, for I had no idea to appear like a beggar on horseback;
but comely and responsible, so that servants should respect me.
Thence to an armourer’s, where I got a plain sword, to suit with
my degree in life. I felt safer with the weapon, though (for one
so ignorant of defence) it might be called an added danger. The
porter, who was naturally a man of some experience, judged my
accoutrement to be well chosen.</p>

<p>"Naething kenspeckle,"[1] said he; "plain, dacent claes. As for
the rapier, nae doubt it sits wi’ your degree; but an I had been
you, I would has waired my siller better-gates than that." And
he proposed I should buy winter-hosen from a wife in the Cowgate-back,
that was a cousin of his own, and made them "extraordinar endurable."</p>

<p>But I had other matters on my hand more pressing. Here I was
in this old, black city, which was for all the world like a rabbit-warren,
not only by the number of its indwellers, but the complication
of its passages and holes. It was, indeed, a place where no stranger
had a chance to find a friend, let be another stranger. Suppose
him even to hit on the right close, people dwelt so thronged in
these tall houses, he might very well seek a day before he chanced
on the right door. The ordinary course was to hire a lad they
called a <em>caddie</em>, who was like a guide or pilot, led you
where you had occasion, and (your errands being done) brought
you again where you were lodging. But these caddies, being always
employed in the same sort of services, and having it for obligation
to be well informed of every house and person in the city, had
grown to form a brotherhood of spies; and I knew from tales of
Mr. Campbell’s how they communicated one with another, what a
rage of curiosity they conceived as to their employer’s business,
and how they were like eyes and fingers to the police. It would
be a piece of little wisdom, the way I was now placed, to take
such a ferret to my tails. I had three visits to make, all immediately
needful: to my kinsman Mr. Balfour of Pilrig, to Stewart the Writer
that was Appin’s agent, and to William Grant Esquire of Prestongrange,
Lord Advocate of Scotland. Mr. Balfour’s was a non-committal visit;
and besides (Pilrig being in the country) I made bold to find
the way to it myself, with the help of my two legs and a Scots
tongue. But the rest were in a different case. Not only was the
visit to Appin’s agent, in the midst of the cry about the Appin
murder, dangerous in itself, but it was highly inconsistent with
the other. I was like to have a bad enough time of it with my
Lord Advocate Grant, the best of ways; but to go to him hot-foot
from Appin’s agent, was little likely to mend my own affairs,
and might prove the mere ruin of friend Alan’s. The whole thing,
besides, gave me a look of running with the hare and hunting with
the hounds that was little to my fancy. I determined, therefore,
to be done at once with Mr. Stewart and the whole Jacobitical
side of my business, and to profit for that purpose by the guidance
of the porter at my side. But it chanced I had scarce given him
the address, when there came a sprinkle of rain—nothing to hurt,
only for my new clothes—and we took shelter under a pend at the
head of a close or alley.</p>

<p>Being strange to what I saw, I stepped a little farther in. The
narrow paved way descended swiftly. Prodigious tall houses sprang
upon each side and bulged out, one storey beyond another, as they
rose. At the top only a ribbon of sky showed in. By what I could
spy in the windows, and by the respectable persons that passed
out and in, I saw the houses to be very well occupied; and the
whole appearance of the place interested me like a tale.</p>

<p>I was still gazing, when there came a sudden brisk tramp of feet
in time and clash of steel behind me. Turning quickly, I was aware
of a party of armed soldiers, and, in their midst, a tall man
in a great coat. He walked with a stoop that was like a piece
of courtesy, genteel and insinuating: he waved his hands plausibly
as he went, and his face was sly and handsome. I thought his eye
took me in, but could not meet it. This procession went by to
a door in the close, which a serving-man in a fine livery set
open; and two of the soldier-lads carried the prisoner within,
the rest lingering with their firelocks by the door.</p>

<p>There can nothing pass in the streets of a city without some
following of idle folk and children. It was so now; but the more
part melted away incontinent until but three were left. One was
a girl; she was dressed like a lady, and had a screen of the Drummond
colours on her head; but her comrades or (I should say) followers
were ragged gillies, such as I had seen the matches of by the
dozen in my Highland journey. They all spoke together earnestly
in Gaelic, the sound of which was pleasant in my ears for the
sake of Alan; and, though the rain was by again, and my porter
plucked at me to be going, I even drew nearer where they were,
to listen. The lady scolded sharply, the others making apologies
and cringeing before her, so that I made sure she was come of
a chief’s house. All the while the three of them sought in their
pockets, and by what I could make out, they had the matter of
half a farthing among the party; which made me smile a little
to see all Highland folk alike for fine obeisances and empty sporrans.</p>

<p>It chanced the girl turned suddenly about, so that I saw her
face for the first time. There is no greater wonder than the way
the face of a young woman fits in a man’s mind, and stays there,
and he could never tell you why; it just seems it was the thing
he wanted. She had wonderful bright eyes like stars, and I daresay
the eyes had a part in it; but what I remember the most clearly
was the way her lips were a trifle open as she turned. And, whatever
was the cause, I stood there staring like a fool. On her side,
as she had not known there was anyone so near, she looked at me
a little longer, and perhaps with more surprise, than was entirely
civil.</p>

<p>It went through my country head she might be wondering at my
new clothes; with that, I blushed to my hair, and at the sight
of my colouring it is to be supposed she drew her own conclusions,
for she moved her gillies farther down the close, and they fell
again to this dispute, where I could hear no more of it.</p>

<p>I had often admired a lassie before then, if scarce so sudden
and strong; and it was rather my disposition to withdraw than
to come forward, for I was much in fear of mockery from the womenkind.
You would have thought I had now all the more reason to pursue
my common practice, since I had met this young lady in the city
street, seemingly following a prisoner, and accompanied with two
very ragged indecent-like Highlandmen. But there was here a different
ingredient; it was plain the girl thought I had been prying in
her secrets; and with my new clothes and sword, and at the top
of my new fortunes, this was more than I could swallow. The beggar
on horseback could not bear to be thrust down so low, or, at least
of it, not by this young lady.</p>

<p>I followed, accordingly, and took off my new hat to her the best
that I was able.</p>

<p>"Madam," said I, "I think it only fair to myself to let you understand
I have no Gaelic. It is true I was listening, for I have friends
of my own across the Highland line, and the sound of that tongue
comes friendly; but for your private affairs, if you had spoken
Greek, I might have had more guess at them."</p>

<p>She made me a little, distant curtsey. "There is no harm done,"
said she, with a pretty accent, most like the English (but more
agreeable). "A cat may look at a king."</p>

<p>"I do not mean to offend," said I. "I have no skill of city manners;
I never before this day set foot inside the doors of Edinburgh.
Take me for a country lad—it’s what I am; and I would rather I
told you than you found it out."</p>

<p>"Indeed, it will be a very unusual thing for strangers to be
speaking to each other on the causeway," she replied. "But if
you are landward [2] bred it will be different. I am as landward
as yourself; I am Highland, as you see, and think myself the farther
from my home."</p>

<p>"It is not yet a week since I passed the line," said I. "Less
than a week ago I was on the braes of Balwhidder."</p>

<p>"Balwhither?" she cries. "Come ye from Balwhither! The name of
it makes all there is of me rejoice. You will not have been long
there, and not known some of our friends or family?"</p>

<p>"I lived with a very honest, kind man called Duncan Dhu Maclaren,"
I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, I know Duncan, and you give him the true name!" she said;
"and if he is an honest man, his wife is honest indeed."</p>

<p>"Ay," said I, "they are fine people, and the place is a bonny
place."</p>

<p>"Where in the great world is such another!" she cries; "I am
loving the smell of that place and the roots that grow there."</p>

<p>I was infinitely taken with the spirit of the maid. "I could
be wishing I had brought you a spray of that heather," says I.
"And, though I did ill to speak with you at the first, now it
seems we have common acquaintance, I make it my petition you will
not forget me. David Balfour is the name I am known by. This is
my lucky day, when I have just come into a landed estate, and
am not very long out of a deadly peril. I wish you would keep
my name in mind for the sake of Balwhidder," said I, "and I will
yours for the sake of my lucky day."</p>

<p>"My name is not spoken," she replied, with a great deal of haughtiness.
"More than a hundred years it has not gone upon men’s tongues,
save for a blink. I am nameless, like the Folk of Peace. [3] Catriona
Drummond is the one I use."</p>

<p>Now indeed I knew where I was standing. In all broad Scotland
there was but the one name proscribed, and that was the name of
the Macgregors. Yet so far from fleeing this undesirable acquaintancy,
I plunged the deeper in.</p>

<p>"I have been sitting with one who was in the same case with yourself,"
said I, "and I think he will be one of your friends. They called
him Robin Oig."</p>

<p>"Did ye so?" cries she. "Ye met Rob?"</p>

<p>"I passed the night with him," said I.</p>

<p>"He is a fowl of the night," said she.</p>

<p>"There was a set of pipes there," I went on, "so you may judge
if the time passed."</p>

<p>"You should be no enemy, at all events," said she. "That was
his brother there a moment since, with the red soldiers round
him. It is him that I call father."</p>

<p>"Is it so?" cried I. "Are you a daughter of James More’s?"</p>

<p>"All the daughter that he has," says she: "the daughter of a
prisoner; that I should forget it so, even for one hour, to talk
with strangers!"</p>

<p>Here one of the gillies addressed her in what he had of English,
to know what "she" (meaning by that himself) was to do about "ta
sneeshin." I took some note of him for a short, bandy-legged,
red-haired, big-headed man, that I was to know more of to my cost.</p>

<p>"There can be none the day, Neil," she replied. "How will you
get ‘sneeshin,’ wanting siller! It will teach you another time
to be more careful; and I think James More will not be very well
pleased with Neil of the Tom."</p>

<p>"Miss Drummond," I said, "I told you I was in my lucky day. Here
I am, and a bank-porter at my tail. And remember I have had the
hospitality of your own country of Balwhidder."</p>

<p>"It was not one of my people gave it," said she.</p>

<p>"Ah, well," said I, "but I am owing your uncle at least for some
springs upon the pipes. Besides which, I have offered myself to
be your friend, and you have been so forgetful that you did not
refuse me in the proper time."</p>

<p>"If it had been a great sum, it might have done you honour,"
said she; "but I will tell you what this is. James More lies shackled
in prison; but this time past they will be bringing him down here
daily to the Advocate’s. . . ."</p>

<p>"The Advocate’s!" I cried. "Is that . . . ?"</p>

<p>"It is the house of the Lord Advocate Grant of Prestongrange,"
said she. "There they bring my father one time and another, for
what purpose I have no thought in my mind; but it seems there
is some hope dawned for him. All this same time they will not
let me be seeing him, nor yet him write; and we wait upon the
King’s street to catch him; and now we give him his snuff as he
goes by, and now something else. And here is this son of trouble,
Neil, son of Duncan, has lost my four-penny piece that was to
buy that snuff, and James More must go wanting, and will think
his daughter has forgotten him."</p>

<p>I took sixpence from my pocket, gave it to Neil, and bade him
go about his errand. Then to her, "That sixpence came with me
by Balwhidder," said I.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said, "you are a friend to the Gregara!"</p>

<p>"I would not like to deceive you, either," said I. "I know very
little of the Gregara and less of James More and his doings, but
since the while I have been standing in this close, I seem to
know something of yourself; and if you will just say ‘a friend
to Miss Catriona’ I will see you are the less cheated."</p>

<p>"The one cannot be without the other," said she.</p>

<p>"I will even try," said I.</p>

<p>"And what will you be thinking of myself!" she cried, "to be
holding my hand to the first stranger!"</p>

<p>"I am thinking nothing but that you are a good daughter," said
I.</p>

<p>"I must not be without repaying it," she said; "where is it you
stop!"</p>

<p>"To tell the truth, I am stopping nowhere yet," said I, "being
not full three hours in the city; but if you will give me your
direction, I will be so bold as come seeking my sixpence for myself."</p>

<p>"Will I can trust you for that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You need have little fear," said I.</p>

<p>"James More could not bear it else," said she. "I stop beyond
the village of Dean, on the north side of the water, with Mrs.
Drummond-Ogilvy of Allardyce, who is my near friend and will be
glad to thank you."</p>

<p>"You are to see me, then, so soon as what I have to do permits,"
said I; and, the remembrance of Alan rolling in again upon my
mind, I made haste to say farewell.</p>

<p>I could not but think, even as I did so, that we had made extraordinary
free upon short acquaintance, and that a really wise young lady
would have shown herself more backward. I think it was the bank-porter
that put me from this ungallant train of thought.</p>

<p>"I thoucht ye had been a lad of some kind o’ sense," he began,
shooting out his lips. "Ye’re no likely to gang far this gate.
A fule and his siller’s shune parted. Eh, but ye’re a green callant!"
he cried, "an’ a veecious, tae! Cleikin’ up wi’ baubeejoes!"</p>

<p>"If you dare to speak of the young lady. . . " I began.</p>

<p>"Leddy!" he cried. "Haud us and safe us, whatten leddy? Ca’ <em>thon</em>
a leddy? The toun’s fu’ o’ them. Leddies! Man, its weel seen ye’re
no very acquant in Embro!"</p>

<p>A clap of anger took me.</p>

<p>"Here," said I, "lead me where I told you, and keep your foul
mouth shut!"</p>

<p>He did not wholly obey me, for, though he no more addressed me
directly, he very impudent sang at me as he went in a manner of
innuendo, and with an exceedingly ill voice and ear—</p>

<p>"As Mally Lee cam doun the street, her capuchin did flee, She
cuist a look ahint her to see her negligee. And we’re a’ gaun
east and wast, we’re a’ gann ajee, We’re a’ gaun east and wast
courtin’ Mally Lee."</p>
