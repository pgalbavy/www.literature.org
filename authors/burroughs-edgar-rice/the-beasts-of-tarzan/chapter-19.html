Shortly after the break of day Tarzan was on deck noting
the condition of the weather.  The wind had abated.  
The sky was cloudless.  Every condition seemed ideal for
the commencement of the return voyage to Jungle Island,
where the beasts were to be left.  And then--home!
<P>
The ape-man aroused the mate and gave instructions that
the Kincaid sail at the earliest possible moment.  
The remaining members of the crew, safe in Lord Greystoke's
assurance that they would not be prosecuted for their share in
the villainies of the two Russians, hastened with cheerful
alacrity to their several duties.
<P>
The beasts, liberated from the confinement of the hold,
wandered about the deck, not a little to the discomfiture of
the crew in whose minds there remained a still vivid picture
of the savagery of the beasts in conflict with those who had
gone to their deaths beneath the fangs and talons which even
now seemed itching for the soft flesh of further prey.
<P>
Beneath the watchful eyes of Tarzan and Mugambi, however,
Sheeta and the apes of Akut curbed their desires, so that
the men worked about the deck amongst them in far greater
security than they imagined.
<P>
At last the Kincaid slipped down the Ugambi and ran out
upon the shimmering waters of the Atlantic.  Tarzan and Jane
Clayton watched the verdure-clad shore-line receding in the
ship's wake, and for once the ape-man left his native soil
without one single pang of regret.
<P>
No ship that sailed the seven seas could have borne him
away from Africa to resume his search for his lost boy with
half the speed that the Englishman would have desired, and
the slow-moving Kincaid seemed scarce to move at all to the
impatient mind of the bereaved father.
<P>
Yet the vessel made progress even when she seemed to be
standing still, and presently the low hills of Jungle Island
became distinctly visible upon the western horizon ahead.
<P>
In the cabin of Alexander Paulvitch the thing within the
black box ticked, ticked, ticked, with apparently unending
monotony; but yet, second by second, a little arm which
protruded from the periphery of one of its wheels came nearer
and nearer to another little arm which projected from the
hand which Paulvitch had set at a certain point upon the dial
beside the clockwork.  When those two arms touched one
another the ticking of the mechanism would cease--for ever.
<P>
Jane and Tarzan stood upon the bridge looking out toward
Jungle Island.  The men were forward, also watching the land
grow upward out of the ocean.  The beasts had sought the
shade of the galley, where they were curled up in sleep.  
All was quiet and peace upon the ship, and upon the waters.
<P>
Suddenly, without warning, the cabin roof shot up into the air,
a cloud of dense smoke puffed far above the Kincaid,
there was a terrific explosion which shook the vessel
from stem to stern.
<P>
Instantly pandemonium broke loose upon the deck.  The apes
of Akut, terrified by the sound, ran hither and thither,
snarling and growling.  Sheeta leaped here and there,
screaming out his startled terror in hideous cries that sent
the ice of fear straight to the hearts of the Kincaid's crew.
<P>
Mugambi, too, was trembling.  Only Tarzan of the Apes and
his wife retained their composure.  Scarce had the debris
settled than the ape-man was among the beasts, quieting their
fears, talking to them in low, pacific tones, stroking their
shaggy bodies, and assuring them, as only he could, that the
immediate danger was over.
<P>
An examination of the wreckage showed that their greatest danger,
now, lay in fire, for the flames were licking hungrily at the
splintered wood of the wrecked cabin, and had already found
a foothold upon the lower deck through a great jagged hole
which the explosion had opened.
<P>
By a miracle no member of the ship's company had been injured
by the blast, the origin of which remained for ever a total
mystery to all but one--the sailor who knew that Paulvitch had
been aboard the Kincaid and in his cabin the previous night.  
He guessed the truth; but discretion sealed his lips.  It would,
doubtless, fare none too well for the man who had permitted
the arch enemy of them all aboard the ship in the watches
of the night, where later he might set an infernal machine
to blow them all to kingdom come.  No, the man decided that
he would keep this knowledge to himself.
<P>
As the flames gained headway it became apparent to Tarzan
that whatever had caused the explosion had scattered
some highly inflammable substance upon the surrounding
woodwork, for the water which they poured in from the pump
seemed rather to spread than to extinguish the blaze.
<P>
Fifteen minutes after the explosion great, black clouds of
smoke were rising from the hold of the doomed vessel.  
The flames had reached the engine-room, and the ship no longer
moved toward the shore.  Her fate was as certain as though the
waters had already closed above her charred and smoking remains.
<P>
"It is useless to remain aboard her longer," remarked the
ape-man to the mate.  "There is no telling but there may be
other explosions, and as we cannot hope to save her, the
safest thing which we can do is to take to the boats without
further loss of time and make land."
<P>
Nor was there other alternative.  Only the sailors could
bring away any belongings, for the fire, which had not yet
reached the forecastle, had consumed all in the vicinity of
the cabin which the explosion had not destroyed.
<P>
Two boats were lowered, and as there was no sea the landing
was made with infinite ease.  Eager and anxious, the beasts
of Tarzan sniffed the familiar air of their native island as
the small boats drew in toward the beach, and scarce had their
keels grated upon the sand than Sheeta and the apes of Akut
were over the bows and racing swiftly toward the jungle.  
A half-sad smile curved the lips of the ape-man as he
watched them go.
<P>
"Good-bye, my friends," he murmured.  "You have been
good and faithful allies, and I shall miss you."
<P>
"They will return, will they not, dear?" asked Jane Clayton, at his side.
<P>
"They may and they may not," replied the ape-man.
"They have been ill at ease since they were forced to accept
so many human beings into their confidence.  Mugambi and
I alone affected them less, for he and I are, at best,
but half human.  You, however, and the members of the crew are
far too civilized for my beasts--it is you whom they are fleeing.  
Doubtless they feel that they cannot trust themselves in the
close vicinity of so much perfectly good food without the
danger that they may help themselves to a mouthful some
time by mistake."
<P>
Jane laughed.  "I think they are just trying to escape you,"
she retorted.  "You are always making them stop something
which they see no reason why they should not do.  Like little
children they are doubtless delighted at this opportunity to
flee from the zone of parental discipline.  If they come back,
though, I hope they won't come by night."
<P>
"Or come hungry, eh?" laughed Tarzan.
<P>
For two hours after landing the little party stood watching the
burning ship which they had abandoned.  Then there came faintly
to them from across the water the sound of a second explosion.  
The Kincaid settled rapidly almost immediatel thereafter,
and sank within a few minutes.
<P>
The cause of the second explosion was less a mystery than
that of the first, the mate attributing it to the bursting of the
boilers when the flames had finally reached them; but what
had caused the first explosion was a subject of considerable
speculation among the stranded company.
