<p>It has been a curious evening.
</p>
<p>The only costume that fitted me in the barber’s emporium was that
of a Teddy Bear. I don’t mind playing bears with some nice young
girls on a winter’s evening in England—but it’s hardly an ideal
costume for the equator. However, I created a good deal of
merriment, and won first prize for “brought on board”—an absurd
term for a costume hired for the evening. Still as nobody seemed
to have the least idea whether they were made or brought, it didn’t
matter.
</p><p>Mrs. Blair refused to dress up. Apparently she is at one with
Pagett on the matter. Colonel Race followed her example. Anne
Beddingfeld had concocted a gipsy costume for herself, and looked
extraordinarily well. Pagett said he had a headache and didn’t
appear. To replace him I asked a quaint little fellow called
Reeves. He’s a prominent member of the South African Labour party.
Horrible little man, but I want to keep in with him, as he gives
me information that I need. I want to understand this Rand business
from both sides.
</p><p>Dancing was a hot affair. I danced twice with Anne Beddingfeld and
she had to pretend she liked it. I danced once with Mrs. Blair,
who didn’t trouble to pretend, and I victimized various other
damsels whose appearance struck me favourably.
</p><p>Then we went down to supper. I had ordered champagne; the steward
suggested Clicquot 1911 as being the best they had on the boat and
I fell in with his suggestion. I seemed to have hit on the one
thing that would loosen Colonel Race’s tongue. Far from being
taciturn, the man became actually talkative. For a while this
amused me, then it occurred to me that Colonel Race, and not
myself, was becoming the life and soul of the party. He chaffed me
at length about keeping a diary.
</p><p>“It will reveal all your indiscretions one of these days, Pedler.”
</p><p>“My dear Race,” I said, “I venture to suggest that I am not quite
the fool you think me. I may commit indiscretions, but I don’t
write them down in black and white. After my death, my executors
will know my opinion of a great many people, but I doubt if they
will find anything to add or detract from their opinion of <u>me.</u>
A diary is useful for recording the idiosyncrasies of other
people—but not one’s own.”
</p><p>“There is such a thing as unconscious self-revelation, though.”
</p><p>“In the eyes of the psycho-analyst, all things are vile,” I replied
sententiously.
</p><p>“You must have had a very interesting life, Colonel Race?” said
Miss Beddingfeld, gazing at him with wide, starry eyes.
</p><p>That’s how they do it, these girls! Othello charmed Desdemona by
telling her stories, but, oh, didn’t Desdemona charm Othello by
the way she listened?
</p><p>Anyway, the girl set Race off all right. He began to tell lion
stories. A man who has shot lions in large quantities has an unfair
advantage over other men. It seemed to me that it was time I, too,
told a lion story. One of a more sprightly character.
</p><p>“By the way,” I remarked, “that reminds me of a rather exciting
tale I heard. A friend of mine was out on a shooting trip somewhere
in East Africa. One night he came out of his tent for some reason,
and was startled by a low growl. He turned sharply and saw a lion
crouching to spring. He had left his rifle in the tent. Quick as
thought, he ducked, and the lion sprang right over his head.
Annoyed at having missed him, the animal growled and prepared to
spring again. Again he ducked, and again the lion sprang right over
him. This happened a third time, but by now he was close to the
entrance of the tent, and he darted in and seized his rifle. When
he emerged, rifle in hand, the lion had disappeared. That puzzled
him greatly. He crept round the back of the tent, where there was
a little clearing. There, sure enough, was the lion, busily
practising low jumps.”
</p><p>This was received with a roar of applause. I drank some champagne.
</p><p>“On another occasion,” I remarked, “this friend of mine had a
second curious experience. He was trekking across country, and
being anxious to arrive at his destination before the heat of the
day he ordered his boys to inspan whilst it was still dark. They
had some trouble in doing so, as the mules were very restive, but
at last they managed it, and a start was made. The mules raced
along like the wind, and when daylight came they saw why. In the
darkness, the boys had inspanned a lion as the near wheeler.”
</p><p>This, too, was well received, a ripple of merriment going round
the table, but I am not sure that the greatest tribute did not come
from my friend, the Labour Member, who remained pale and serious.
</p><p>“My God!” he said anxiously. “Who un’arnessed them?”
</p><p>“I must go to Rhodesia,” said Mrs. Blair. “After what you have told
us, Colonel Race, I simply must. It’s a horrible journey though,
five days in the train.”
</p><p>“You must join me on my private car,” I said gallantly. “Oh, Sir
Eustace, how sweet of you, do you really mean it?”
</p><p>“Do I mean it!” I exclaimed reproachfully, and drank another glass
of champagne.
</p><p>“Just about another week, and we shall be in South Africa,” sighed
Mrs. Blair.
</p><p>“Ah, South Africa,” I said sentimentally, and began to quote from
a recent speech of mine at the Colonial Institute. “What has South
Africa to show the world? What indeed? Her fruit and her farms,
her wool and her wattles, her herds and her hides, her gold and
her diamonds——”
</p><p>I was hurrying on, because I knew that as soon as I paused Reeves
would butt in and inform me that the hides were worthless because
the animals hung themselves up on barbed wire or something of that
sort, would crab everything else, and end up with the hardships of
the miners on the Rand. And I was not in the mood to be abused as
a Capitalist. However, the interruption came from another source
at the magic word diamonds.
</p><p>“Diamonds!” said Mrs. Blair ecstatically.
</p><p>“Diamonds!” breathed Miss Beddingfeld.
</p><p>They both addressed Colonel Race.
</p><p>“I suppose you’ve been to Kimberley?”
</p><p>I had been to Kimberley too, but I didn’t manage to say so in time.
Race was being inundated with questions. What were mines like? Was
it true that the natives were kept shut up in compounds? And so
on.
</p><p>Race answered their questions and showed a good knowledge of his
subject. He described the methods of housing the natives, the
searches instituted, and the various precautions that De Beers
took.
</p><p>“Then it’s practically impossible to steal any diamonds?” asked
Mrs. Blair with as keen an air of disappointment as though she had
been journeying there for the express purpose.
</p><p>“Nothing’s impossible, Mrs. Blair. Thefts do occur—like the case
I told you of where the Kafir hid the stone in his wound.”
</p><p>“Yes, but on a large scale?”
</p><p>“Once, in recent years. Just before the War in fact. You must
remember the case, Pedler. You were in South Africa at the time?”
</p><p>I nodded.
</p><p>“Tell us,” cried Miss Beddingfeld. “Oh, do tell us!”
</p><p>Race smiled.
</p><p>“Very well, you shall have the story. I suppose most of you have
heard of Sir Laurence Eardsley, the great South African mining
magnate? His mines were gold mines, but he comes into the story
through his son. You may remember that just before the War rumours
were afield of a new potential Kimberley hidden somewhere in the
rocky floor of the British Guiana jungles. Two young explorers, so
it was reported, had returned from that part of South America
bringing with them a remarkable collection of rough diamonds, some
of them of considerable size. Diamonds of small size had been found
before in the neighbourhood of the Essequibo and Mazaruni rivers,
but these two young men, John Eardsley and his friend Lucas,
claimed to have discovered beds of great carbon deposits at the
common head of two streams. The diamonds were of every colour,
pink, blue, yellow, green, black, and the purest white. Eardsley
and Lucas came to Kimberley where they were to submit their gems
to inspection. At the same time a sensational robbery was found to
have taken place at De Beers. When sending diamonds to England they
are made up into a packet. This remains in the big safe, of which
the two keys are held by two different men whilst a third man knows
the combination. They are handed to the Bank, and the Bank send
them to England. Each package is worth, roughly, about £100,000.
</p><p>“On this occasion, the Bank were struck by something a little
unusual about the sealing of the packet. It was opened, and found
to contain knobs of sugar!
</p><p>“Exactly how suspicion came to fasten on John Eardsley I do not
know. It was remembered that he had been very wild at Cambridge
and that his father had paid his debts more than once. Anyhow, it
soon got about that this story of South American diamond fields
was all a fantasy. John Eardsley was arrested. In his possession
was found a portion of the De Beer diamonds.
</p><p>“But the case never came to court. Sir Laurence Eardsley paid over
a sum equal to the missing diamonds and De Beers did not prosecute.
Exactly how the robbery was committed has never been known. But
the knowledge that his son was a thief broke the old man’s heart.
He had a stroke shortly afterwards. As for John, his Fate was in
a way merciful. He enlisted, went to the War, fought there bravely,
and was killed, thus wiping out the stain on his name. Sir Laurence
himself had a third stroke and died about a month ago. He died
intestate and his vast fortune passed to his next of kin, a man
whom he hardly knew.”
</p><p>The Colonel paused. A babel of ejaculations and questions broke
out. Something seemed to attract Miss Beddingfeld’s attention, and
she turned in her chair. At the little gasp she gave, I, too,
turned.
</p><p>My new secretary, Rayburn, was standing in the doorway. Under his
tan, his face had the pallor of one who has seen a ghost. Evidently
Race’s story had moved him profoundly.
</p><p>Suddenly conscious of our scrutiny, he turned abruptly and
disappeared.
</p><p>“Do you know who that is?” asked Anne Beddingfeld abruptly.
</p><p>“That’s my other secretary,” I explained. “Mr. Rayburn. He’s been
seedy up to now.”
</p><p>She toyed with the bread by her plate.
</p><p>“Has he been your secretary long?”
</p><p>“Not very long,” I said cautiously.
</p><p>But caution is useless with a woman, the more you hold back, the
more she presses forward. Anne Beddingfeld made no bones about it.
</p><p>“How long?” she asked bluntly.
</p><p>“Well—er—I engaged him just before I sailed. Old friend of mine
recommended him.”
</p><p>She said nothing more, but relapsed into a thoughtful silence. I
turned to Race with the feeling that it was my turn to display an
interest in his story.
</p><p>“Who is Sir Laurence’s next of kin, Race? Do you know?”
</p><p>“I should say so,” he replied, with a smile. “I am!”
