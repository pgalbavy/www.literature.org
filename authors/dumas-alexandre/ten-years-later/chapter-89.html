<P>Madame's marriage was celebrated in the chapel of the
Palais-Royal, in the presence of a crowd of courtiers, who
had been most scrupulously selected. However,
notwithstanding the marked favor which an invitation
indicated, Raoul, faithful to his promise to Malicorne, who
was so anxious to witness the ceremony, obtained admission
for him. After he had fulfilled this engagement, Raoul
approached De Guiche, who, as if in contrast with his
magnificent costume, exhibited a countenance so utterly
dejected, that the Duke of Buckingham was the only one
present who could contend with him as far as pallor and
discomfiture were concerned.</P>
<P>&quot;Take care, count,&quot; said Raoul, approaching his friend, and
preparing to support him at the moment the archbishop
blessed the married couple. In fact, the Prince of Conde was
attentively scrutinizing these two images of desolation,
standing like caryatides on either side of the nave of the
church. The count, after that, kept a more careful watch
over himself.</P>
<P>At the termination of the ceremony, the king and queen
passed onward towards the grand reception-room, where Madame
and her suite were to be presented to them. It was remarked
that the king, who had seemed more than surprised at his
sister-in-law's appearance was most flattering in his
compliments to her. Again, it was remarked that the
queen-mother, fixing a long and thoughtful gaze upon
Buckingham, leaned towards Madame de Motteville as though to
ask her, &quot;Do you not see how much he resembles his father?&quot;
and finally it was remarked that Monsieur watched everybody,
and seemed quite discontented. After the reception of the
princess and ambassadors, Monsieur solicited the king's
permission to present to him as well as to Madame the
persons belonging to their new household.</P>
<P>&quot;Are you aware, vicomte,&quot; inquired the Prince de Conde of
Raoul, &quot;whether the household has been selected by a person
of taste, and whether there are any faces worth looking at?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have not the slightest idea, monseigneur,&quot; replied Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;You affect ignorance, surely.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In what way, monseigneur?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are a friend of De Guiche, who is one of the friends of
the prince.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That may be so, monseigneur; but the matter having no
interest whatever for me, I never questioned De Guiche on
the subject; and De Guiche on his part, never having been
questioned, did not communicate any particulars to me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But Manicamp?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is true I saw Manicamp at Havre, and during the journey
here, but I was no more inquisitive with him than I had been
towards De Guiche. Besides, is it likely that Manicamp
should know anything of such matters? for he is a person of
only secondary importance.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My dear vicomte, do you not know better than that?&quot; said
the prince; &quot;why, it is these persons of secondary
importance who, on such occasions, have all the influence;
and the truth is, that nearly everything has been done
through Manicamp's presentations to De Guiche, and through
De Guiche to Monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I assure you, monseigneur, I was ignorant of that,&quot; said
Raoul, &quot;and what your highness does me the honor to impart
is perfectly new to me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will most readily believe you, although it seems
incredible; besides, we shall not have long to wait. See,
the flying squadron is advancing, as good Queen Catherine
used to say. Ah! ah! what pretty faces!&quot;</P>
<P>A bevy of young girls at this moment entered the salon,
conducted by Madame de Navailles, and to Manicamp's credit
be it said, if indeed he had taken that part in their
selection which the Prince de Conde assigned him, it was a
display calculated to dazzle those who, like the prince,
could appreciate every character and style of beauty. A
young, fair-complexioned girl, from twenty to one-and-twenty
years of age, and whose large blue eyes flashed, as she
opened them, in the most dazzling manner, walked at the head
of the band and was the first presented.</P>
<P>&quot;Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente,&quot; said Madame de Navailles
to Monsieur, who, as he saluted his wife, repeated
&quot;Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! ah!&quot; said the Prince de Conde to Raoul, &quot;she is
presentable enough.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Raoul, &quot;but has she not a somewhat haughty
style?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Bah! we know these airs very well, vicomte; three months
hence she will be tame enough. But look, there, indeed, is a
pretty face.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Raoul, &quot;and one I am acquainted with.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais,&quot; said Madame de Navailles.
The name and Christian name were carefully repeated by
Monsieur.</P>
<P>&quot;Great heavens!&quot; exclaimed Raoul, fixing his bewildered gaze
upon the entrance doorway.</P>
<P>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; inquired the prince; &quot;was it
Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais who made you utter such a
`Great heavens'?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, monseigneur, no,&quot; replied Raoul, pale and trembling.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, if it be not Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais, it
is that pretty blonde who follows her. What beautiful eyes!
She is rather thin, but has fascinations without number.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mademoiselle de la Baume le Blanc de la Valliere!&quot; said
Madame de Navailles; and, as this name resounded through his
whole being, a cloud seemed to rise from his breast to his
eyes, so that he neither saw nor heard anything more; and
the prince, finding him nothing more than a mere echo which
remained silent under his railleries, moved forward to
inspect somewhat closer the beautiful girls whom his first
glance had already particularized.</P>
<P>&quot;Louise here! Louise a maid of honor to Madame!&quot; murmured
Raoul, and his eyes, which did not suffice to satisfy his
reason, wandered from Louise to Montalais. The latter had
already emancipated herself from her assumed timidity, which
she only needed for the presentation and for her reverences.</P>
<P>Mademoiselle de Montalais, from the corner of the room to
which she had retired, was looking with no slight confidence
at the different persons present; and, having discovered
Raoul, she amused herself with the profound astonishment
which her own and her friend's presence there caused the
unhappy lover. Her waggish and malicious look, which Raoul
tried to avoid meeting, and which yet he sought inquiringly
from time to time, placed him on the rack. As for Louise,
whether from natural timidity, or some other reason for
which Raoul could not account, she kept her eyes constantly
cast down; intimidated, dazzled, and with impeded
respiration, she withdrew herself as much as possible aside,
unaffected even by the nudges Montalais gave her with her
elbow. The whole scene was a perfect enigma for Raoul, the
key to which he would have given anything to obtain. But no
one was there who could assist him, not even Malicorne; who,
a little uneasy at finding himself in the presence of so
many persons of good birth, and not a little discouraged by
Montalais's bantering glances, had described a circle, and
by degrees succeeded in getting a few paces from the prince,
behind the group of maids of honor, and nearly within reach
of Mademoiselle Aure's voice, she being the planet around
which he, as her attendant satellite, seemed constrained to
gravitate. As he recovered his self-possession, Raoul
fancied he recognized voices on his right hand that were
familiar to him, and he perceived De Wardes, De Guiche, and
the Chevalier de Lorraine, conversing together. It is true
they were talking in tones so low, that the sound of their
words could hardly be heard in the vast apartment. To speak
in that manner from any particular place without bending
down, or turning round, or looking at the person with whom
one may be engaged in conversation, is a talent that cannot
be immediately acquired by newcomers. Long study is needed
for such conversations, which, without a look, gesture, or
movement of the head, seem like the conversation of a group
of statues. In fact, in the king's and queen's grand
assemblies, while their majesties were speaking, and while
every one present seemed to be listening in the midst of the
most profound silence, some of these noiseless conversations
took place, in which adulation was not the prevailing
feature. But Raoul was one among others exceedingly clever
in this art, so much a matter of etiquette, that from the
movement of the lips he was often able to guess the sense of
the words.</P>
<P>&quot;Who is that Montalais?&quot; inquired De Wardes, &quot;and that La
Valliere? What country-town have we had sent here?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Montalais?&quot; said the chevalier,  -  &quot;oh, I know her; she is
a good sort of a girl, whom we shall find amusing enough. La
Valliere is a charming girl, slightly lame.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! bah!&quot; said De Wardes.</P>
<P>&quot;Do not be absurd, De Wardes, there are some very
characteristic and ingenious Latin axioms about lame
ladies.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Gentlemen, gentlemen,&quot; said De Guiche, looking at Raoul
with uneasiness, &quot;be a little careful, I entreat you.&quot;</P>
<P>But the uneasiness of the count, in appearance at least, was
not needed. Raoul had preserved the firmest and most
indifferent countenance, although he had not lost a word
that passed. He seemed to keep an account of the insolence
and license of the two speakers in order to settle matters
with them at the earliest opportunity.</P>
<P>De Wardes seemed to guess what was passing in his mind, and
continued:</P>
<P>&quot;Who are these young ladies' lovers?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Montalais's lover?&quot; said the chevalier.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, Montalais first.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You, I, or De Guiche,  -  whoever likes, in fact.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And the other?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mademoiselle de la Valliere?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Take care, gentlemen,&quot; exclaimed De Guiche, anxious to put
a stop to De Wardes's reply; &quot;take care, Madame is listening
to us.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul thrust his hand up to the wrist into his justaucorps
in great agitation. But the very malignity which he saw was
excited against these poor girls made him take a serious
resolution. &quot;Poor Louise,&quot; he thought, &quot;has come here only
with an honorable object in view and under honorable
protection; and I must learn what that object is which she
has in view, and who it is that protects her.&quot; And following
Malicorne's maneuver, he made his way toward the group of
the maids of honor. The presentations were soon over. The
king, who had done nothing but look at and admire Madame,
shortly afterwards left the reception-room, accompanied by
the two queens. The Chevalier de Lorraine resumed his place
beside Monsieur, and, as he accompanied him, insinuated a
few drops of the venom he had collected during the last
hour, while looking at some of the faces in the court, and
suspecting that some of their hearts might be happy. A few
of the persons present followed the king as he quitted the
apartment; but such of the courtiers as assumed an
independence of character, and professed a gallantry of
disposition, began to approach the ladies of the court. The
prince paid his compliments to Mademoiselle de
Tonnay-Charente, Buckingham devoted himself to Madame
Chalais and Mademoiselle de Lafayette, whom Madame already
distinguished by her notice, and whom she held in high
regard. As for the Comte de Guiche, who had abandoned
Monsieur as soon as he could approach Madame alone, he
conversed, with great animation, with Madame de Valentinois,
and with Mesdemoiselles de Crequy and de Chatillon.</P>
<P>Amid these varied political and amorous interests, Malicorne
was anxious to gain Montalais's attention; but the latter
preferred talking with Raoul, even if it were only to amuse
herself with his innumerable questions and his astonishment.
Raoul had gone direct to Mademoiselle de la Valliere, and
had saluted her with the profoundest respect, at which
Louise blushed, and could not say a word. Montalais,
however, hurried to her assistance.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, monsieur le vicomte, here we are, you see.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do, indeed, see you,&quot; said Raoul, smiling, &quot;and it is
exactly because you are here that I wish to ask for some
explanation.&quot;</P>
<P>Malicorne approached the group with his most fascinating
smile.</P>
<P>&quot;Go away, Malicorne; really, you are exceedingly
indiscreet.&quot; At this remark Malicorne bit his lips and
retired a few steps, without making any reply. His smile,
however, changed its expression, and from its former
frankness, became mocking in its expression.</P>
<P>&quot;You wished for an explanation, M. Raoul?&quot; inquired
Montalais.</P>
<P>&quot;It is surely worth one, I think; Mademoiselle de la
Valliere a maid of honor to Madame!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why should not she be a maid of honor, as well as myself?&quot;
inquired Montalais.</P>
<P>&quot;Pray accept my compliments, young ladies,&quot; said Raoul, who
fancied he perceived they were not disposed to answer him in
a direct manner.</P>
<P>&quot;Your remark was not made in a very complimentary manner,
vicomte.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mine?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly; I appeal to Louise.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;M. de Bragelonne probably thinks the position is above my
condition,&quot; said Louise, hesitatingly.</P>
<P>&quot;Assuredly not,&quot; replied Raoul, eagerly; &quot;you know very well
that such is not my feeling; were you called upon to occupy
a queen's throne, I should not be surprised; how much
greater reason, then, such a position as this? The only
circumstance that amazes me is that I should have learned it
only to-day, and that by the merest accident.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is true,&quot; replied Montalais, with her usual giddiness;
&quot;you know nothing about it, and there is no reason you
should. M. de Bragelonne had written several letters to you,
but your mother was the only person who remained behind at
Blois, and it was necessary to prevent these letters falling
into her hands; I intercepted them, and returned them to M.
Raoul, so that he believed you were still at Blois while you
were here in Paris, and had no idea whatever, indeed, how
high you had risen in rank.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did you not inform M. Raoul, as I begged you to do?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why should I? to give him an opportunity or making some of
his severe remarks and moral reflections, and to undo what
we had so much trouble in effecting? Certainly not.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Am I so very severe, then?&quot; said Raoul, inquiringly.</P>
<P>&quot;Besides,&quot; said Montalais, &quot;it is sufficient to say that it
suited me. I was about setting off for Paris  -  you were
away; Louise was weeping her eyes out; interpret that as you
please; I begged a friend, a protector of mine, who had
obtained the appointment for me, to solicit one for Louise;
the appointment arrived. Louise left in order to get her
costume prepared; as I had my own ready, I remained behind;
I received your letters, and returned them to you, adding a
few words, promising you a surprise. Your surprise is before
you, monsieur, and seems to be a fair one enough; you have
nothing more to ask. Come, M. Malicorne, it is now time to
leave these young people together: they have many things to
talk about; give me your hand; I trust that you appreciate
the honor conferred upon you, M. Malicorne.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Forgive me,&quot; said Raoul, arresting the giddy girl, and
giving to his voice an intonation, the gravity of which
contrasted with that of Montalais; &quot;forgive me, but may I
inquire the name of the protector you speak of; for if
protection be extended towards you, Mademoiselle Montalais,
 -  for which, indeed, so many reasons exist,&quot; added Raoul,
bowing, &quot;I do not see that the same reasons exist why
Mademoiselle de la Valliere should be similarly cared for.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But, M. Raoul,&quot; said Louise, innocently, &quot;there is no
difference in the matter, and I do not see why I should not
tell it you myself; it was M. Malicorne who obtained it for
me.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul remained for a moment almost stupefied, asking himself
if they were trifling with him; he then turned round to
interrogate Malicorne, but he had been hurried away by
Montalais, and was already at some distance from them.
Mademoiselle de la Valliere attempted to follow her friend,
but Raoul, with gentle authority, detained her.</P>
<P>&quot;Louise, one word, I beg.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But, M. Raoul,&quot; said Louise, blushing, &quot;we are alone. Every
one has left. They will become anxious, and will be looking
for us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Fear nothing,&quot; said the young man, smiling, &quot;we are neither
of us of sufficient importance for our absence to be
remarked.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But I have my duty to perform, M. Raoul.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do not be alarmed, I am acquainted with these usages of the
court; you will not be on duty until to-morrow; a few
minutes are at your disposal, which will enable you to give
me the information I am about to have the honor to ask you
for.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How serious you are, M. Raoul!&quot; said Louise.</P>
<P>&quot;Because the circumstances are serious. Are you listening?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am listening; I would only repeat, monsieur, that we are
quite alone.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are right,&quot; said Raoul, and, offering her his hand, he
led the young girl into the gallery adjoining the
reception-room, the windows of which looked out upon the
courtyard. Every one hurried towards the middle window,
which had a balcony outside, from which all the details of
the slow and formal preparations for departure could be
seen. Raoul opened one of the side windows, and then, being
alone with Louise, said to her: &quot;You know, Louise, that from
my childhood I have regarded you as my sister, as one who
has been the confidante of all my troubles, to whom I have
entrusted all my hopes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, M. Raoul,&quot; she answered softly; &quot;yes, M. Raoul, I know
that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You used, on your side, to show the same friendship towards
me, and had the same confidence in me; why have you not, on
this occasion, been my friend  -  why have you shown
suspicion of me?&quot;</P>
<P>Mademoiselle de la Valliere did not answer. &quot;I fondly
thought you loved me,&quot; said Raoul, whose voice became more
and more agitated; &quot;I fondly thought you consented to all
the plans we had, together, laid down for our own happiness,
at the time when we wandered up and down the walks of
Cour-Cheverny, under the avenue of poplar trees leading to
Blois. You do not answer me, Louise. Is it possible,&quot; he
inquired, breathing with difficulty, &quot;that you no longer
love me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I did not say so,&quot; replied Louise, softly.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! tell me the truth, I implore you. All my hopes in life
are centered in you. I chose you for your gentle and simple
tastes. Do not suffer yourself to be dazzled, Louise, now
that you are in the midst of a court where all that is pure
too soon becomes corrupt  -  where all that is young too soon
grows old. Louise, close your ears, so as not to hear what
may be said; shut your eyes, so as not to see the examples
before you; shut your lips, that you may not inhale the
corrupting influences about you. Without falsehood or
subterfuge, Louise, am I to believe what Mademoiselle de
Montalais stated? Louise, did you come to Paris because I
was no longer at Blois?&quot;</P>
<P>La Valliere blushed and concealed her face in her hands.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, it was so, then!&quot; exclaimed Raoul, delightedly; &quot;that
was, then, your reason for coming here. I love you as I
never yet loved you. Thanks, Louise, for this devotion; but
measures must be taken to place you beyond all insult, to
shield you from every lure. Louise, a maid of honor in the
court of a young princess in these days of free manners and
inconstant affections  - -a maid of honor is placed as an
object of attack without having any means of defence
afforded her; this state of things cannot continue, you must
be married in order to be respected.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Married?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, here is my hand, Louise; will you place yours within
it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But your father?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My father leaves me perfectly free.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yet  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I understand your scruples, Louise; I will consult my
father.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Reflect, M. Raoul; wait.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Wait! it is impossible. Reflect, Louise, when you are
concerned! it would be insulting,  -  give me your hand, dear
Louise; I am my own master. My father will consent, I know;
give me your hand, do not keep me waiting thus. One word in
answer, one word only; if not, I shall begin to think that,
in order to change you forever, nothing more was needed than
a single step in the palace, a single breath of favor, a
smile from the queen, a look from the king.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul had no sooner pronounced this latter word, than La
Valliere became as pale as death, no doubt from fear at
seeing the young man excite himself. With a movement as
rapid as thought, she placed both her hands in those of
Raoul, and then fled without adding a syllable; disappearing
without casting a look behind her. Raoul felt his whole
frame tremble at the contact of her hand; he received the
compact as a solemn bargain wrung by affection from her
child-like timidity.</P></div>
