<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The rain of two nights and two days had freshened the woods,
deepening the green of the tree-trunks and washing the dust from
the leaves, and now, under the splendid sun of the third morning,
we sat painting in a sylvan aisle that was like a hall of Aladdin's
palace, the filigreed arches of foliage above us glittering with
pendulous rain-drops. But Arabian Nights' palaces are not to my
fancy for painting; the air, rinsed of its colour, was too sparklingly
clean; the interstices of sky and the roughly framed distances
I prized, were brought too close. It was one of those days when
Nature throws herself straight in your face and you are at a loss
to know whether she has kissed you or slapped you, though you
are conscious of the tingle;&mdash;a day, in brief, more for laughing
than for painting, and the truth is that I suited its mood only
too well, and laughed more than I painted, though I sat with my
easel before me and a picture ready upon my palette to be painted.</p>

<p>No one could have understood better than I that this was setting
a bad example to the acolyte who sat, likewise facing an easel,
ten paces to my left; a very sportsmanlike figure of a painter
indeed, in her short skirt and long coat of woodland brown, the
fine brown of dead oak-leaves; a "devastating" selection of colour
that!&mdash;being much the same shade as her hair&mdash;with brown for her
hat too, and the veil encircling the small crown thereof, and
brown again for the stout, high, laced boots which protected her
from the wet tangle underfoot. Who could have expected so dashing
a young person as this to do any real work at painting? Yet she
did, narrowing her eyes to the finest point of concentration,
and applying herself to the task in hand with a persistence which
I found, on that particular morning, far beyond my own powers.</p>

<p>As she leaned back critically, at the imminent risk of capsizing
her camp-stool, and herself with it, in her absorption, some ill-suppressed
token of amusement most have caught her ear, for she turned upon
me with suspicion, and was instantly moved to moralize upon the
reluctance I had shown to accept her as a companion for my excursions;
taking as her theme, in contrast, her own present display of ambition;
all in all a warm, if over-coloured, sketch of the idle master
and the industrious apprentice. It made me laugh again, upon which
she changed the subject.</p>

<p>"An indefinable something tells me," she announced coldly, "that
henceforth you needn't be so <em>DRASTICALLY </em>fearful of being
dragged to the chateau for dinner, nor dejeuner either!"</p>

<p>"Did anything ever tell you that I had cause to fear it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, but too simply. "Jean Ferret."</p>

<p>"Anglicise that ruffian's name," I muttered, mirth immediately
withering upon me, "and you'll know him better. To save time:
will you mention anything you can think of that he <em>HASN'T
</em>told you?"</p>

<p>Miss Elliott cocked her head upon one side to examine the work
of art she was producing, while a slight smile, playing about
her lips, seemed to indicate that she was appeased. "You and Miss
Ward are old and dear friends, aren't you?" she asked absently.</p>

<p>"We are!" I answered between my teeth. "For years I have sent
her costly jewels&mdash;"</p>

<p>She interrupted me by breaking outright into a peal of laughter,
which rang with such childish delight that I retorted by offering
several malevolent observations upon the babbling of French servants
and the order of mind attributable to those who listened to them.
Her defence was to affect inattention and paint busily until some
time after I had concluded.</p>

<p>"I think she's going to take Cressie Ingle," she said dreamily,
with the air of one whose thoughts have been far, far away. "It
looks preponderously like it. She's been teetertottering these
<em>AGES </em>and <em>AGES </em>between you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Between whom?"</p>

<p>"You and Mr. Ingle," she replied, not altering her tone in the
slightest. "But she's all for her brother, of course, and though
you're his friend, Ingle is a personage in the world they court,
and among the <em>MULTITUDINOUS </em>things his father left him
is an art magazine, or one that's long on art or something of
that sort &mdash;I don't know just what&mdash;so altogether it will
be a good thing for <em>DEAREST </em>Mr. Ward. She likes Cressie,
of course, though I think she likes you better&mdash;"</p>

<p>I managed to find my voice and interrupt the thistle-brained
creature. "What put these fantasias into your head?"</p>

<p>"Not Jean Ferret," she responded promptly.</p>

<p>"It's cruel of me to break it to you so coarsely &mdash;I know&mdash;but
if you are ever going to make up your mind to her building as
glaring a success of you as she has of her brother, I think you
must do it now. She's on the point of accepting Mr. Ingle, and
what becomes of <em>YOU </em>will depend on your conduct in the
most immediate future. She won't ask you to Quesnay again, so
you'd better go up there on your own accord. &mdash;And on your
bended knees, too!" she added as an afterthought.</p>

<p>I sought for something to say which might have a chance of impressing
her&mdash;a desperate task on the face of it&mdash;and I mentioned that
Miss Ward was her hostess.</p>

<p>One might as well have tried to impress Amedee. She "made a little
mouth" and went on dabbling with her brushes. "Hostess? Pooh!"
she said cheerfully. "My <em>INFANTILE </em>father sent me here
to be in her charge while he ran home to America. Mr. Ward's to
paint my portrait, when he comes. Give and take&mdash;it's simple enough,
you see!"</p>

<p>Here was frankness with a vengeance, and I fell back upon silence,
whereupon a pause ensued, to my share of which I imparted the
deepest shadow of disapproval within my power. Unfortunately,
she did not look at me; my effort passed with no other effect
than to make some of my facial muscles ache.</p>

<p>"'Portrait of Miss E., by George Ward, H. C.,'" this painfully
plain-speaking young lady continued presently. "On the line at
next spring's Salon, then packed up for the dear ones at home.
I'd as soon own an 'Art Bronze,' myself&mdash;or a nice, clean porcelain
Arab."</p>

<p>"No doubt you've forgotten for the moment," I said, "that Mr.
Ward is my friend."</p>

<p>"Not in painting, he isn't," she returned quickly,</p>

<p>"I consider his work altogether creditable; it's carefully done,
conscientious, effective&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Isn't that true of the ladies in the hairdressers' windows?"
she asked with assumed artlessness. "Can't you say a kind word
for them, good gentleman, and heaven bless you?"</p>

<p>"Why sha'n't I be asked to Quesnay again?"</p>

<p>She laughed. "You haven't seemed <em>FANATICALLY </em>appreciative
of your opportunities when you have been there; you might have
carried her off from Cresson Ingle instead of vice versa. But
after all, you <em>AREN'T"&mdash;</em>here she paused and looked at
me appraisingly for a moment-"you <em>AREN'T </em>the most piratical
dash-in-and-dash-out and leave-everything-upside-down-behind-you
sort of man, are you?"</p>

<p>"No, I believe I'm not."</p>

<p>"However, that's only a <em>SMALL </em>half of the reason," Miss
Elliott went on. "She's furious on account of this."</p>

<p>These were vague words, and I said so.</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>THIS," </em>she explained, "my being here; your letting
me come. Impropriety&mdash;all of that!" A sharp whistle issued from
her lips. "Oh! the <em>EXCORIATING </em>things she's said of my
pursuing you!"</p>

<p>"But doesn't she know that it's only part of your siege of Madame
Brossard's; that it's a subterfuge in the hope of catching a glimpse
of Oliver Saffren?"</p>

<p>"No!" she cried, her eyes dancing; "I told her that, but she
thinks it's only a subterfuge in the hope of catching more than
a glimpse of you!"</p>

<p>I joined laughter with her then. She was the first to stop, and,
looking at me somewhat doubtfully, she said:</p>

<p>"Whereas, the truth is that it's neither. You know very well
that I want to paint."</p>

<p>"Certainly," I agreed at once. "Your devotion to 'your art' and
your hope of spending half an hour at Madame Brossard's now and
then are separable;&mdash;which reminds me: Wouldn't you like me to
look at your sketch?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet." She jumped up and brought her camp-stool over
to mine. "I feel that I could better bear what you'll say of it
after I've had some lunch. Not a <em>SYLLABLE </em>of food has
crossed my lips since coffee at dawn!"</p>

<p>I spread before her what Amedee had prepared; not sandwiches
for the pocket to-day, but a wicker hamper, one end of which we
let rest upon her knees, the other upon mine, and at sight of
the foie gras, the delicate, devilled partridge, the truffled
salad, the fine yellow cheese, and the long bottle of good red
Beaune, revealed when the cover was off, I could almost have forgiven
the old rascal for his scandal-mongering. As for my vis-a-vis,
she pronounced it a "maddening sight."</p>

<p>"Fall to, my merry man," she added, "and eat your fill of this
fair pasty, under the greenwood tree." Obeying her instructions
with right good-will, and the lady likewise evincing no hatred
of the viands, we made a cheerful meal of it, topping it with
peaches and bunches of grapes.</p>

<p>"It is unfair to let you do all the catering," said Miss Elliott,
after carefully selecting the largest and best peach.</p>

<p>"Jean Ferret's friend does that," I returned, watching her rather
intently as she dexterously peeled the peach. She did it very
daintily, I had to admit that&mdash;though I regretted to observe indications
of the gourmet in one so young. But when it was peeled clean,
she set it on a fresh green leaf, and, to my surprise, gave it
to me.</p>

<p>"You see," she continued, not observing my remorseful confusion,
"I couldn't destroy Elizabeth's peace of mind and then raid her
larder to boot. That poor lady! I make her trouble enough, but
it's nothing to what she's going to have when she finds out some
things that she must find out."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"About Mrs. Harman," was the serious reply. "Elizabeth hasn't
a clue."</p>

<p>"'Clue'?" I echoed.</p>

<p>"To Louise's strange affair." Miss Elliott's expression had grown
as serious as her tone. "It is strange; the strangest thing I
ever knew."</p>

<p>"But there's your own case," I urged. "Why should you think it
strange of her to take an interest in Saffren?"</p>

<p>"I adore him, of course," she said. "He is the most glorious-looking
person I've ever seen, but on my <em>WORD&mdash;" </em>She paused,
and as her gaze met mine I saw real earnestness in her eyes. "I'm
afraid &mdash;I was half joking the other day&mdash;but now I'm really
afraid Louise is beginning to be in love with him."</p>

<p>"Oh, mightn't it be only interest, so far?" I said.</p>

<p>"No, it's much more. And I've grown so fond of her!" the girl
went on, her voice unexpectedly verging upon tremulousness. "She's
quite wonderful in her way&mdash;such an understanding sort of woman,
and generous and kind; there are so many things turning up in
a party like ours at Quesnay that show what people are really
made of, and she's a rare, fine spirit. It seems a pity, with
such a miserable first experience as she had, that this should
happen. Oh I know," she continued rapidly, cutting off a half-formed
protest of mine. "He isn't mad&mdash;and I'm sorry I tried to be amusing
about it the night you dined at the chateau. I know perfectly
well he's not insane; but I'm absolutely sure, from one thing
and another, that&mdash;well&mdash;he isn't <em>ALL THERE! </em>He's as
beautiful as a seraph and probably as good as one, but something
is <em>MISSING </em>about him&mdash;and it begins to look like a second
tragedy for her."</p>

<p>"You mean, she really&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," she returned, with a catch in her throat. "She conies
to my room when the others are asleep. Not that she tells me a
great deal, but it's in the air, somehow; she told me with such
a strained sort of gaiety of their meeting and his first joining
her; and there was something underneath as if she thought <em>I</em>
might be really serious in my ravings about him, and&mdash;yes, as
if she meant to warn me off. And the other night, when I saw her
after their lunching together at Dives, I asked her teasingly
if she'd had a happy day, and she laughed the prettiest laugh
I ever heard and put her arms around me&mdash;then suddenly broke out
crying and ran out of the room."</p>

<p>"But that may have been no more than over-strained nerves," I
feebly suggested.</p>

<p>"Of course it was!" she cried, regarding me with justifiable
astonishment. "It's the <em>CAUSE </em>of their being overstrained
that interests me! It's all so strange and distressing," she continued
more gently, "that I wish I weren't there to see it. And there's
poor George Ward coming&mdash;ah! and when Elizabeth learns of it!"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Harman had her way once, in spite of everything," I said
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, she was a headstrong girl of nineteen, then. But let's
not think it could go as far as that! There!" She threw a peach-stone
over her shoulder and sprang up gaily. "Let's not talk of it;
I <em>THINK </em>of it enough! It's time for you to give me a
<em>RACKING </em>criticism on my morning's work."</p>

<p>Taking off her coat as she spoke, she unbuttoned the cuffs of
her manly blouse and rolled up her sleeves as far as they would
go, preparations which I observed with some perplexity.</p>

<p>"If you intend any violence," said I, "in case my views of your
work shouldn't meet your own, I think I'll be leaving."</p>

<p>"Wait," she responded, and kneeling upon one knee beside a bush
near by, thrust her arms elbow-deep under the outer mantle of
leaves, shaking the stems vigorously, and sending down a shower
of sparkling drops. Never lived sane man, or madman, since time
began, who, seeing her then, could or would have denied that she
made the very prettiest picture ever seen by any person or persons
whatsoever&mdash;but her purpose was difficult to fathom. Pursuing
it, I remarked that it was improbable that birds would be nesting
so low.</p>

<p>"It's for a finger bowl," she said briskly. And rising, this
most practical of her sex dried her hands upon a fresh serviette
from the hamper. "Last night's rain is worth two birds in the
bush."</p>

<p>With that, she readjusted her sleeves, lightly donned her coat,
and preceded me to her easel. "Now," she commanded, "slaughter!
It's what I let you come with me for."</p>

<p>I looked at her sketch with much more attention than I had given
the small board she had used as a bait in the courtyard of Les
Trois Pigeons. Today she showed a larger ambition, and a larger
canvas as well&mdash;or, perhaps I should say a larger burlap, for
she had chosen to paint upon something strongly resembling a square
of coffee-sacking. But there was no doubt she had "found colour"
in a swash-buckling, bullying style of forcing it to be there,
whether it was or not, and to "vibrate," whether it did or not.
There was not much to be said, for the violent kind of thing she
had done always hushes me; and even when it is well done I am
never sure whether its right place is the "Salon des Independants"
or the Luxembourg. It <em>SEEMS </em>dreadful, and yet sometimes
I fear in secret that it may be a real transition, or even an
awakening, and that the men I began with, and I, are standing
still. The older men called US lunatics once, and the critics
said we were "daring," but that was long ago.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said.</p>

<p>I had to speak, so I paraphrased a mot of Degas (I think it was
Degas) and said:</p>

<p>"If Rousseau could come to life and see this sketch of yours,
I imagine he would be very much interested, but if he saw mine
he might say, 'That is my fault!'"</p>

<p>"OH!" she cried, her colour rising quickly; she looked troubled
for a second, then her eyes twinkled. "You're not going to let
my work make a difference between us, are you?"</p>

<p>"I'll even try to look at it from your own point of view," I
answered, stepping back several yards to see it better, though
I should have had to retire about a quarter of the length of a
city block to see it quite from her own point of view.</p>

<p>She moved with me, both of us walking backward. I began:</p>

<p>"For a day like this, with all the colour in the trees themselves
and so very little in the air&mdash;"</p>

<p>There came an interruption, a voice of unpleasant and wiry nasality,
speaking from behind us.</p>

<p>"<em>WELL, WELL!" </em>it said. "So here we are again!"</p>

<p>I faced about and beheld, just emerged from a by-path, a fox-faced
young man whose light, well-poised figure was jauntily clad in
gray serge, with scarlet waistcoat and tie, white shoes upon his
feet, and a white hat, gaily beribboned, upon his head. A recollection
of the dusky road and a group of people about Pere Baudry's lamplit
door flickered across my mind.</p>

<p>"The historical tourist!" I exclaimed. "The highly pedestrian
tripper from Trouville!"</p>

<p>"You got me right, m'dear friend," he replied with condescension;
"I rec'leck meetin' you perfect."</p>

<p>"And I was interested to learn," said I, carefully observing
the effect of my words upon him, "that you had been to Les Trois
Pigeons after all. Perhaps I might put it, you had been through
Les Trois Pigeons, for the maitre d'hotel informed me you had
investigated every corner&mdash;that wasn't locked."</p>

<p>"Sure," he returned, with rather less embarrassment than a brazen
Vishnu would have exhibited under the same circumstances. "He
showed me what pitchers they was in your studio. I'll luk 'em
over again fer ye one of these days. Some of 'em was right gud."</p>

<p>"You will be visiting near enough for me to avail myself of the
opportunity?"</p>

<p>"Right in the Pigeon House, m'friend. I've just come down t'putt
in a few days there," he responded coolly. "They's a young feller
in this neighbourhood I take a kind o' fam'ly interest in."</p>

<p>"Who is that?" I asked quickly.</p>

<p>For answer he produced the effect of a laugh by widening and
lifting one side of his mouth, leaving the other, meantime, rigid.</p>

<p>"Don' lemme int'rup' the conv'sation with yer lady-friend," he
said winningly. "What they call 'talkin' High Arts,' wasn't it?
I'd like to hear some."</p>
