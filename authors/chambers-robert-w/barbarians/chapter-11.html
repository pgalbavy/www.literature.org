<p>It was Dr. Vail whose identification secured burial for Neeland,
not in the American cemetery, but in Aulnes Wood.</p>

<p>When the raid into Finistère ended, and the unclean birds took
flight, Vail, at Quimper, ordered north with his unit, heard of
the tragedy, and went to Aulnes. And so Neeland was properly buried
beside the youthful châtelaine. Which was, no doubt, what his
severed soul desired. And perhaps hers desired it, too.</p>

<p>Vail continued on to Paris, to Flanders, got gassed, and came
back to New York.</p>

<p>He had aged ten years in as many months.</p>

<p>Gray, the younger surgeon, kept glancing from time to time at
Vail’s pallid face, and the latter understood the professional
interest of the younger man.</p>

<p>"You think I look ill?" he asked, finally.</p>

<p>"You don’t look very fit, Doctor."</p>

<p>"No.... I’m <em>going West</em>."</p>

<p>"You mean it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why do you think that you are&mdash;<em>going West</em>?"</p>

<p>"There’s a thing over there, born of gas. It’s a living thing,
animal or vegetable. I don’t know which. It’s only recently been
recognized. We call it the ’Seed of Death.’"</p>

<p>Gray gazed at the haggard face of the older man in silence.</p>

<p>Vail went on, slowly: "It’s properly named. It is always fatal.
A man may live for a few months. But, once gassed, even in the
slightest degree, if that germ is inhaled, death is certain."</p>

<p>After a silence Gray began: "Do you have any apprehension&mdash;"
And did not finish the sentence.</p>

<p>Vail shrugged. "It’s interesting, isn’t it?" he said with pleasant
impersonality.</p>

<p>After a silence Gray said: "Are you doing anything about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. It’s working in the dark, of course. I’m feeling rottener
every day."</p>

<p>He rested his handsome head on one thin hand:</p>

<p>"I don’t want to die, Gray, but I don’t know how to keep alive.
It’s odd, isn’t it? I don’t wish to die. It’s an interesting world.
I want to see how the local elections turn out in New York."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Certainly. That is what worries me more than anything. We Allies
are sure to win. I’m not worrying about that. But I’d like to
live to see Tammany a dead cock in the pit!"</p>

<p>Gray forced a laugh; Vail laughed unfeignedly, and then, solemn
again, said:</p>

<p>"I’d like to live to see this country aspire to something really
noble."</p>

<p>"After all," said Gray, "there is really nothing to stifle aspiration."</p>

<p>It was not only because Vail had been gazing upon death in every
phase, every degree&mdash;on brutal destruction wholesale and in detail;
but also he had been standing on the outer escarpment of Civilization
and had watched the mounting sea of barbarism battering, thundering,
undermining, gradually engulfing the world itself and all its
ancient liberties.</p>

<p>He and the young surgeon, Gray, who was to sail to France next
day were alone together on the loggia of the club; dusk mitigated
the infernal heat of a summer day in town.</p>

<p>On the avenue below motor cars moved north and south, hansoms
crept slowly along the curb, and on the hot sidewalks people passed
listlessly under the electric lights&mdash;the nine&mdash;and&mdash;seventy sweating
tribes.</p>

<p>For, on such summer nights, under the red moon, an exodus from
the East Side peoples the noble avenue with dingy spectres who
shuffle along the gilded grilles and still façades of stone, up
and down, to and fro, in quest of God knows what&mdash;of air perhaps,
perhaps of happiness, or of something even vaguer. But whatever
it may be that starts them into painful motion, one thing seems
certain: aspiration is a part of their unrest.</p>

<p>"There is liberty here," replied Dr. Vail&mdash;"also her inevitable
shadow, tyranny."</p>

<p>"We need more light; that’s all," said Gray.</p>

<p>"When light streams in from every angle no shadow is possible."</p>

<p>"The millennium? I get you.... In this country the main thing
is that there is <em>some</em> light. A single ray, however feeble,
and even coming from one fixed angle only, means aspiration, life...."</p>

<p>He lighted a cigar.</p>

<p>"As you know," he remarked, "there is a flower called <em>Aconitum</em>.
It is also known by the ominous names of Monks-Hood and Helmet-Flower.
Direct sunlight kills it. It flourishes only in shadow. Like the
Kaiser-Flower it also is blue; and," he added, "it is deadly poison....
As you say, the necessary thing in this world is light from every
angle."</p>

<p>His cigar glimmered dully through the silence. Presently he went
on; "Speaking of tyranny, I think it may be classed as a recognized
and tolerated business carried on successfully by those born with
a genius for it. It flourishes in the shade&mdash;like the Helmet-Flower....
But the sun in this Western Hemisphere of ours is devilish hot.
It’s gradually killing off our local tyrants&mdash;slowly, almost imperceptibly
but inexorably, killing ’em off.... Of course, there are plenty
still alive&mdash;tyrants of every degree born to the business of tyranny
and making a success at it."</p>

<p>He smoked tranquilly for a while, then:</p>

<p>"There are our tyrants of industry," he said; "tyrants of politics,
tyrants of religion&mdash;great and small we still harbor plenty of
tyrants, all scheming to keep their roots from shriveling under
this fierce western sun of ours&#11834;"</p>

<p>He laughed without mirth, turning his worn and saddened eyes
on Gray:</p>

<p>"Tyranny is a business," he repeated; "also it is a state of
mind&mdash;a delusion, a ruling passion&mdash;strong even in death.... The
odd part of it is that a tyrant never knows he’s one.... He invariably
mistakes himself for a local Moses. I can tell you a sort of story
if you care to listen.... Or, we can go to some cheerful show
or roof-garden&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Go on with your story," said Gray.</p>
