<p>
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They pursued it with forks and hope;<br/>
They threatened its life with a railway-share;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They charmed it with smiles and soap.

</p>
<p>
Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For making a separate sally;<br/>
And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dismal and desolate valley.

</p>
<p>
But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had chosen the very same place:<br/>
Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disgust that appeared in his face.

</p>
<p>
Each thought he was thinking of nothing but "Snark"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the glorious work of the day;<br/>
And each tried to pretend that he did not remark<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the other was going that way.

</p>
<p>
But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the evening got darker and colder,<br/>
Till (merely from nervousness, not from goodwill)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They marched along shoulder to shoulder.

</p>
<p>
Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they knew that some danger was near:<br/>
The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even the Butcher felt queer.

</p>
<p>
He thought of his childhood, left far far behind&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That blissful and innocent state&mdash;<br/>
The sound so exactly recalled to his mind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pencil that squeaks on a slate!

</p>
<p>
"‘Tis the voice of the Jubjub!" he suddenly cried.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(This man, that they used to call "Dunce.")<br/>
"As the Bellman would tell you," he added with pride,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have uttered that sentiment once.

</p>
<p>
"‘Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will find I have told it you twice.<br/>
‘Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only I’ve stated it thrice."

</p>
<p>
The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attending to every word:<br/>
But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the third repetition occurred.

</p>
<p>
It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had somehow contrived to lose count,<br/>
And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By reckoning up the amount.

</p>
<p>
"Two added to one&mdash;if that could but be done,"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It said, "with one’s fingers and thumbs!"<br/>
&nbsp;Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had taken no pains with its sums.

</p>
<p>
"The thing can be done," said the Butcher, "I think.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing must be done, I am sure.<br/>
The thing shall be done!  Bring me paper and ink,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best there is time to procure."

</p>
<p>
The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ink in unfailing supplies:<br/>
While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watched them with wondering eyes.

</p>
<p>
So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he wrote with a pen in each hand,<br/>
And explained all the while in a popular style<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which the Beaver could well understand.

</p>
<p>
"Taking Three as the subject to reason about&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A convenient number to state&mdash;<br/>
We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By One Thousand diminished by Eight.

</p>
<p>
"The result we proceed to divide, as you see,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Nine Hundred and Ninety Two:<br/>
Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly and perfectly true.

</p>
<p>
"The method employed I would gladly explain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I have it so clear in my head,<br/>
If I had but the time and you had but the brain&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But much yet remains to be said.

</p>
<p>
"In one moment I’ve seen what has hitherto been<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enveloped in absolute mystery,<br/>
And without extra charge I will give you at large<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Lesson in Natural History."

</p>
<p>
In his genial way he proceeded to say<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Forgetting all laws of propriety,<br/>
And that giving instruction, without introduction,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),

</p>
<p>
"As to temper the Jubjub’s a desperate bird,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it lives in perpetual passion:<br/>
Its taste in costume is entirely absurd&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ages ahead of the fashion:

</p>
<p>
"But it knows any friend it has met once before:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It never will look at a bribe:<br/>
And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And collects&mdash;though it does not subscribe.

</p>
<p>
"Its’ flavour when cooked is more exquisite far<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:<br/>
(Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some, in mahogany kegs:)

</p>
<p>
"You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You condense it with locusts and tape:<br/>
Still keeping one principal object in view&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To preserve its symmetrical shape."

</p>
<p>
The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he felt that the lesson must end,<br/>
And he wept with delight in attempting to say<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He considered the Beaver his friend.

</p>
<p>
While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More eloquent even than tears,<br/>
It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would have taught it in seventy years.

</p>
<p>
They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For a moment) with noble emotion,<br/>
Said "This amply repays all the wearisome days<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have spent on the billowy ocean!"

</p>
<p>
Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have seldom if ever been known;<br/>
In winter or summer, ‘twas always the same&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could never meet either alone.

</p>
<p>
And when quarrels arose&mdash;as one frequently finds<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quarrels will, spite of every endeavour&mdash;<br/>
The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cemented their friendship for ever!<br/>
