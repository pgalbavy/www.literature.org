<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Julia, like Herbert, had been a little puzzled by Florence's
expression of a partiality for the young man, Noble Dill; it was
not customary for anybody to confess a weakness for him. However,
the aunt dismissed the subject from her mind, as other matters
pressed sharply upon her attention; she had more worries than
most people guessed.</p>

<p>The responsibilities of a lady who is almost officially the prettiest
person in a town persistently claiming sixty-five thousand inhabitants
are often heavier than the world suspects, and there were moments
when Julia found the position so trying that she would have preferred
to resign. She was a warm-hearted, appreciative girl, naturally
unable to close her eyes to sterling merit wherever it appeared:
and it was not without warrant that she complained of her relatives.
The whole family, including the children, she said, regaled themselves
with her private affairs as a substitute for theatre-going. But
one day, a week after the irretrievable disappearance of Fifi
and Mimi, she went so far as to admit a note of unconscious confession
into her protest that she was getting pretty tired of being mistaken
for a three-ring circus! Such was her despairing expression, and
the confession lies in her use of the word "three."</p>

<p>The misleading moderation of "three" was pointed out to her by
her niece, whose mind at once violently seized upon the word and
divested it of context&mdash;a process both feminine and instinctive,
for this child was already beginning to be feminine. "Three!"
she said. "Why, Aunt Julia, you must be crazy! There's Newland
Sanders and Noble Dill and that old widower, Ridgley, that grandpa
hates so, and Mister Clairdyce and George Plum and the two new
ones from out of town that Aunt Fanny Patterson said you had at
church Sunday morning &mdash;Herbert said he didn't like one of
'em's looks much, Aunt Julia. And there's Parker Kent Usher and
that funny-lookin' one with the little piece of whiskers under
his underlip that Noble Dill got so mad at when they were calling,
and Uncle Joe laughed about, and I don't know who all! Anyhow,
there's an awful lot more than three, Aunt Julia."</p>

<p>Julia looked down with little favour upon the talkative caller.
Florence was seated upon the shady steps of the veranda, and Julia,
dressed for a walk, occupied a wicker chair above her. "Julia,
dressed for a walk"&mdash;how scant the words! It was a summer walk
that Julia had dressed for: and she was all too dashingly a picture
of coolness on a hot day: a brunette in murmurous white, though
her little hat was a film of blackest blue, and thus also in belt
and parasol she had almost matched the colour of her eyes. Probably
no human-made fabric could have come nearer to matching them,
though she had once met a great traveller&mdash;at least he went far
enough in his search for comparisons&mdash;who told her that the Czarina
of Russia had owned a deep sapphire of precisely the colour, but
the Czarina's was the only sapphire yet discovered that had it.
One of Newland Sanders's longest Poems-to-Julia was entitled "Black
Sapphires."</p>

<p>Julia's harmonies in black sapphire were uncalled for. If she
really had been as kind as she was too often capable of looking,
she would have fastened patches over both eyes&mdash;one patch would
have been useless&mdash;and she would have worn flat shoes and patronized
a dressmaker with genius enough to misrepresent her. But Julia
was not great enough for such generosities: she should have been
locked up till she passed sixty; her sufferings deserve no pity.</p>

<p>And yet an attack of the mumps during the winter had brought
Julia more sympathy than the epidemic of typhoid fever in the
Old Ladies' Infirmary brought all of the nine old ladies who were
under treatment there. Julia was confined to her room for almost
a month, during which a florist's wagon seemed permanent before
the house: and a confectioner's frequently stood beside the florist's.
Young Florence, an immune who had known the mumps in infancy,
became an almost constant attendant upon the patient, with the
result that the niece contracted an illness briefer than the aunt's,
but more than equalling it in poignancy, caused by the poor child's
economic struggle against waste. Florence's convalescence took
place in her own home without any inquiries whatever from the
outer world, but Julia's was spent in great part at the telephone.
Even a poem was repeated to her by the instrument:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
How the world blooms anew<br/>
To think that you<br/>
Can speak again,<br/>
Can hear<br/>
The words of men<br/>
And the dear<br/>
Own voice of you.

</p>
</div>
<p>This was Newland Sanders. He was just out of college, a reviewer,
a poet, and once, momentarily, an atheist. It was Newland who
was present and said such a remarkable thing when Julia had the
accident to her thumb-nail in closing the double doors between
the living-room and the library, where her peculiar old father
sat reading. "To see you suffer," Newland said passionately as
she nursed her injury:&mdash;"to see you in pain, that is the one thing
in the universe which I feel beyond all my capacities. Do you
know, when you are made to suffer pain, then I feel that there
is no God!"</p>

<p>This strong declaration struck Herbert as one of the most impressive
things he had ever heard, though he could not account for its
being said to any aunt of his. Herbert had just dropped in without
the formality of ringing the bell, and had paused in the hall,
outside the open door of the living-room. He considered the matter,
after Newland had spoken, and concluded to return to his own place
of residence without disturbing anybody at his grandfather's.
At home he found his mother and father entertaining one of his
uncles, one of his aunts, two of his great-uncles, one of his
great-aunts, and one of his grown-up cousins, at cards: and he
proved to be warranted in believing that they would all like to
know what he had heard. Newland's statement became quite celebrated
throughout the family: and Julia, who had perceived almost a sacred
something in his original fervour, changed her mind after hearing
the words musingly repeated, over and over, by her fat old Uncle
Joe.</p>

<p>Florence thought proper to remind her of this to-day, after Julia's
protest containing the too moderately confessional word "three."</p>

<p>"If you don't want to be such a circus," the niece continued,
reasoning perfectly, "I don't see what you always keep leadin'
all of 'em on all the time just the same for."</p>

<p>"Who've you heard saying that, Florence?" her aunt demanded.</p>

<p>"Aunt Fanny Patterson," Florence replied absently. "F'r instance,
Aunt Julia, I don't see what you want to go walking with Newland
Sanders for, when you said yourself you wished he was dead, or
somep'n, after there got to be so muck talk in the family and
everywhere about his sayin' all that about the Bible when you
hurt your thumb. All the family&#11834;"</p>

<p>Julia sighed profoundly. "I wish 'all the family' would try to
think about themselves for just a little while! There's entirely
too little self-centredness among my relatives to suit me!"</p>

<p>"Why, it's only because you're related to me that <em>I</em>
pay the very <em>slightest</em> attention to what goes on here,"
Florence protested. "It's my own grandfather's house, isn't it?
Well, if you didn't live here, and if you wasn't my own grandfather's
daughter, Aunt Julia, I wouldn't ever pay the <em>very</em> slightest
attention to you! Anyway, I don't <em>much</em> criticize all
these people that keep calling on you&mdash;anyway not half as much
as Herbert does. Herbert thinks he always hass to act so critical,
now his voice is changing."</p>

<p>"At your age," said Julia, "my mind was on my schoolbooks."</p>

<p>"Why, Aunt Julia!" Florence exclaimed in frank surprise. "Grandpa
says just the opposite from that. I've heard him say, time and
time and time again, you always <em>were</em> this way, ever since
you were four years old."</p>

<p>"What way?" asked her aunt.</p>

<p>"Like you are now, Aunt Julia. Grandpa says by the time you were
fourteen it got so bad he had to get a new front gate, the way
they leaned on it. He says he hoped when you grew up he'd get
a little peace in his own house, but he says it's worse, and never
for one minute the livelong day can he&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I know," Julia interrupted. "He talks like a Christian Martyr
and behaves like Nero. I might warn you to keep away from him,
by the way, Florence. He says that either you or Herbert was over
here yesterday and used his spectacles to cut a magazine with,
and broke them. I wouldn't be around here much if I were you until
he's got over it."</p>

<p>"It must have been Herbert broke 'em," said Florence promptly.</p>

<p>"Papa thinks it was you. Kitty Silver told him it was."</p>

<p>"Mean ole reptile!" said Florence, alluding to Mrs. Silver; then
she added serenely, "Well, grandpa don't get home till five o'clock,
and it's only about a quarter of two now. Aunt Julia, what are
you waitin' around here for?"</p>

<p>"I told you; I'm going walking."</p>

<p>"I mean: Who with?"</p>

<p>Miss Atwater permitted herself a light moan. "With Mr. Sanders
and Mr. Ridgely, Florence."</p>

<p>Florence's eyes grew large and eager. "Why, Aunt Julia, I thought
those two didn't speak to each other any more!"</p>

<p>"They don't," Julia assented in a lifeless voice. "It just happened
that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Ridgley and Mr. Dill, all three, asked
me to take a walk this afternoon at two o'clock."</p>

<p>"But Noble Dill isn't going?"</p>

<p>"No," said Julia. "I was fortunate enough to remember that I'd
already promised someone else when he asked me. That's what I
didn't remember when Mr. Ridgely asked me."</p>

<p>"I'd have gone with Noble Dill," Florence said firmly. "Noble
Dill is my Very Ideal! I'd marry him to-morrow."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," her aunt remarked, "I heard your mother telling
somebody the other day that you had said the same thing about
the King of Spain."</p>

<p>Florence laughed. "Oh, that was only a passing fancy," she said
lightly. "Aunt Julia, what's Newland Sanders supposed to do?"</p>

<p>"I think he hasn't entered any business or profession yet."</p>

<p>"I bet he couldn't," her niece declared. "What's that old Ridgely
supposed to be? Just a widower?"</p>

<p>"Never mind!"</p>

<p>"And that George Plum's supposed to do something or other around
Uncle Joe's ole bank, isn't he?" Florence continued.</p>

<p>"'Supposed'!" Julia protested. "What is all this 'supposed to
be'? Where did you catch that horrible habit? You know the whole
family worries over your superciliousness, Florence; but until
now I've always thought it was just the way your face felt easiest.
If it's going to break out in your talk, too, it's time you began
to cure yourself of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't hurt anything!" Florence made careless response,
and, as she saw the thin figure of young Mr. Sanders approaching
in the distance, "Look!" she cried, pointing. "Why, he doesn't
even <em>compare</em> to Noble Dill!"</p>

<p>"Don't point at people!"</p>

<p>"Well, he's nothing much to point at!" She lowered her finger.
"It's no depredation to me, Aunt Julia, to give up pointing at
Newland Sanders. Atch'ly, I wouldn't give Noble Dill's little
finger for a hunderd and fifty Newland Sanderses!"</p>

<p>Julia smiled faintly as she watched Mr. Sanders, who seemed not
yet to be aware of her, because he thought it would be better
to reach the gate and lift his hat just there. "What <em>has</em>
brought on all this tenderness in favour of Mr. Dill, Florence?"</p>

<p>Her niece's eyes, concentrated in thought, then became dreamy.
"I like him because he's so uncouth," she said. "I think he's
the uncouthest of any person I ever saw."</p>

<p>"'Uncouth'?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Florence. "Herbert said I was uncouth, and I looked
it up in the ditchanary. It said, 'Rare, exquisite, elegant, unknown,
obs, unfamiliar, strange,' and a whole lot else. I never did know
a word that means so much, I guess. What's 'obs' mean, Aunt Julia?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Julia, rising, for Mr. Sanders had made a little
startled movement as he reached the gate and caught sight of her;
and now, straw hat in hand, he was coming up the brick walk that
led to the veranda. His eyes were fixed upon Julia with an intensity
that seemed to affect his breathing; there was a hushedness about
him. And Florence, in fascination, watched Julia's expression
and posture take on those little changes that always seemed demanded
of her by the approach of a young or youngish man, or a nicely
dressed old one. By almost imperceptible processes the commonplace
moment became dramatic at once.</p>

<p>"You!" said Newland in a low voice.</p>

<p>And Julia, with an implication as flattering as the gesture was
graceful, did not wait till he was within reach, but suddenly
extended her welcoming hand at arm's length. He sprang forward
convulsively and grasped it, as if forever.</p>

<p>"You see my little niece?" Julia said. "I think you know her."</p>

<p>"Know her?" Mr. Sanders repeated; then roused his faculties and
gave Florence a few fingers dangling coldly after their recent
emotion. "Florence. Oh, yes, Florence."</p>

<p>Florence had not risen, but remained seated upon the steps, her
look and air committed to that mood of which so much complaint
had been made. "How do you do," she said. "There's Mr. Ridgely."</p>

<p>"Where?" Newland asked loudly.</p>

<p>"Comin' in at the gate," said Florence. "He's goin' walkin' with
you, too."</p>

<p>In this crisis, Mr. Sanders's feeling was obviously one of startled
anguish. He turned to Julia.</p>

<p>"Why, this is terrible!" he said. "You told me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Sh!" she warned him; and whispered hastily, all in a breath:
"<em>Couldn't-be-helped-explain-next-time-I-see-you.</em>" Then
she advanced a gracious step to meet the newcomer.</p>

<p>But the superciliousness of Florence visibly increased with this
advent: Mr. Ridgely was easily old enough to be her grandfather,
yet she seemed to wish it evident that she would not have cared
for him even in that capacity. He was, in truth, one of those
widowers who feel younger than ever, and behave as they feel.
Since his loss he had shown the greatest willingness to forego
whatever advantages age and experience had given him over the
descendants of his old friends and colleagues, and his cheerfulness
as well as his susceptibility to all that was charming had begun
to make him so famous in the town that some of his contemporaries
seemed to know scarce another topic. And Julia had a kinder heart,
as her father bitterly complained, than most girls.</p>

<p>The widower came, holding out to her a votive cluster of violets,
a pink rose among them, their stems wrapped in purple; and upon
the lapel of his jovial flannel coat were other violets about
a pink rosebud.</p>

<p>"How pretty of you!" said Julia, taking the offering; and as
she pinned it at her waist, she added rather nervously, "I believe
you know Mr. Sanders; he is going with us."</p>

<p>She was warranted in believing the gentlemen to be acquainted,
because no longer ago than the previous week they both had stated,
in her presence and simultaneously, that any further communication
between them would be omitted for life. Julia realized, of course,
that Mr. Ridgely must find the present meeting as trying as Newland
did, and, to help him bear it, she contrived to make him hear
the hurried whisper: "<em>Couldn't-be-helped-explain-some-day.</em>"</p>

<p>Then with a laugh not altogether assured, she took up her parasol.
"Shall we be starting?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Here's Noble Dill," said Florence, "I guess he's goin' to try
to go walkin' with you, too, Aunt Julia."</p>

<p>Julia turned, for in fact the gate at that moment clicked behind
the nervously advancing form of Noble Dill. He came with, a bravado
that was merely pitiable and he tried to snap his Orduma cigarette
away with thumb and forefinger in a careless fashion, only to
see it publicly disappear through an open cellar window of the
house.</p>

<p>"I hope there's no excelsior down there," said Newland Sanders.
"A good many houses have burned to the ground just that way."</p>

<p>"It fell on the cement floor," Florence reported, peering into
the window. "It'll go out pretty soon."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose we might as well do the same thing," said Newland,
addressing Julia first and Mr. Dill second. "Miss Atwater and
I are just starting for a walk."</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgely also addressed the new arrival. "Miss Atwater and
I are just starting for a walk."</p>

<p>"You see, Noble," said the kind-hearted Julia, "I did tell you
I had another engagement."</p>

<p>"I came by here," Mr. Dill began in a tone commingling timidity,
love, and a fatal stubbornness; "I came by here &mdash;I mean
I just happened to be passing&mdash;and I thought if it was a walking-<em>party</em>,
well, why not go along? That's the way it struck me." He paused,
coughing for courage and trying to look easily genial, but not
succeeding; then he added, "Well, as I say, that's the way it
struck me&mdash;as it were. I suppose we might as well be starting."</p>

<p>"Yes, we might," Newland Sanders said quickly; and he placed
himself at Julia's left, seizing upon her parasol and opening
it with determination.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgely had kept himself closely at the lady's right. "You
were mistaken, my boy," he said, falsely benevolent. "It isn't
a party&mdash;though there's Miss Florence, Noble. Nobody's asked her
to go walking to-day!"</p>

<p>Now, Florence took this satire literally. She jumped up and said
brightly: "I just as soon! Let's <em>do</em> have a walking-party.
I just as soon walk with Mr. Dill as anybody, and we can all keep
together, kind of." With that, she stepped confidently to the
side of her selected escort, who appeared to be at a loss how
to avert her kindness.</p>

<p>There was a moment of hesitation, during which a malevolent pleasure
slightly disfigured the countenances of the two gentlemen with
Julia; but when Florence pointed to a house across the street
and remarked, "There's Great-Uncle Milford and Aunt C'nelia; they
been lookin' out of their second guestroom window about half an
hour," Julia uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Murder!" she said, and moved with decision toward the gate.
"Let's go!"</p>

<p>Thus the little procession started, Mr. Sanders and the sprightly
widower at Beauty's side, with Florence and Mr. Dill so close
behind that, before they had gone a block, Newland found it necessary
to warn this rear rank that the heels of his new shoes were not
part of the pavement. After that the rear rank, a little abashed,
consented to fall back some paces. Julia's heightened colour,
meanwhile, was little abated by some slight episodes attending
the progress of the walking-party. Her Aunt Fanny Patterson, rocking
upon a veranda, rose and evidently called to someone within the
house, whereupon she was joined by her invalid sister, Aunt Harriet,
with a trained nurse and two elderly domestics, a solemnly whispering
audience. And in the front yard of "the Henry Atwater house,"
at the next corner, Herbert underwent a genuine bedazzlement,
but he affected more. His violent gaze dwelt upon Florence, and
he permitted his legs slowly to crumple under him, until, just
as the party came nearest him, he lay prostrate upon his back
in a swoon. Afterward he rose and for a time followed in a burlesque
manner; then decided to return home.</p>

<p>"Old heathen!" said Florence, glancing back over her shoulder
as he disappeared from view.</p>

<p>Mr. Dill was startled from a reverie inspired by the back of
Julia's head. "'Heathen'?" he said, in plaintive inquiry.</p>

<p>"I meant Herbert," Florence informed him. "Cousin Herbert Atwater.
He was following us, walking Dutch."</p>

<p>"'Cousin Herbert Atwater'?" said Noble dreamily. "'Dutch'?"</p>

<p>"He won't any more," said Florence. "He always hass to show off,
now his voice is changing." She spoke, and she also walked, with
dignity&mdash;a rather dashing kind of dignity, which was what Herbert's
eccentricity of gait intended to point out injuriously. In fact,
never before had Florence been so impressed with herself; never
before, indeed, had she been a member of a grown-up non-family
party; never before had she gone walking with an actual adult
young man for her escort; and she felt that she owed it to her
position to appear in as brilliant an aspect as possible. She
managed to give herself a rhythmical, switching motion, causing
her kneelength skirt to swing from side to side&mdash;a pomp that brought
her a great deal of satisfaction as she now and then caught the
effect by twisting her neck enough to see down behind, over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>But her poise was temporarily threatened when the walking-party
passed her own house. Her mother happened to be sitting near an
open window upstairs, and, after gazing forth with warm interest
at Julia and her two outwalkers, Mrs. Atwater's astonished eyes
fell upon Florence taking care of the overflow. Florence bowed
graciously.</p>

<p>"Florence!" her mother called down from the window: whereupon
both Florence and her Aunt Julia were instantly apprehensive,
for Mrs. George Atwater's lack of tact was a legend in the family.
"Florence! Where on earth are you going?"</p>

<p>"Never mind!" Florence thought best to respond. "Never mind!"</p>

<p>"You'd better come <em>in</em>," Mrs. Atwater called, her voice
necessarily louder as the party moved onward.</p>

<p>"Never mind!" Florence called back.</p>

<p>Mrs. Atwater leaned out of the window. "Where are you going?
Come back and get your <em>hat</em>. You'll get a <em>sunstroke</em>!"</p>

<p>Florence was able to conceal her indignation, and merely waved
a hand in airy dismissal as they passed from Mrs. Atwater's sight,
leaving her still shouting.</p>

<p>The daughter smiled negligently and shrugged her shoulders. "She'll
get over it!" she said.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"My mother. She was the one makin' all that noise," said Florence.
"Sometimes I do what she says: sometimes I don't. It's all accordings
to the way I feel." She looked up in her companion's face, and
her expression became politely fond as she thought how uncouth
he was, for in Florence's eye Noble Dill was truly rare, exquisite,
and unfamiliar; and she believed that he was obs, too, whatever
that meant. She often thought about him, and no longer ago than
yesterday she had told Kitty Silver that she couldn't see "how
Aunt Julia could <em>look</em> at anybody else!"</p>

<p>Florence's selection of Noble Dill for the bright favourite of
her dreams was one of her own mysteries. Noble was not beautiful,
neither did he present to the ordinary eye of man anything especially
rare, exquisite, unfamiliar, or even so distinguished as to be
obsolete. He was about twenty-two, but not one of those book-read
sportsmen of that age, confident in clothes and manner, easy travellers
and debonair; that is to say, Noble was not of the worldly type
twenty-two. True, he had graduated from the High-school before
entering his father's Real Estate and Insurance office, but his
geographical experiences (in particular) had been limited to three
or four railway excursions, at special rates, to such points of
interest as Mammoth Cave and Petoskey, Michigan. His other experiences
were not more sparkling, and except for the emotions within him,
he was in all the qualities of his mind as well as in his bodily
contours and the apparel sheltering the latter, the most commonplace
person in Florence's visible world. The inner areas of the first
and second fingers of his left hand bore cigarette stains, seemingly
indelible: the first and second fingers of his right hand were
strongly ornamented in a like manner; tokens proving him ambidextrous
to but a limited extent, however. Moreover, his garments and garnitures
were not comparable to those of either Newland Sanders or that
dapper antique, Mr. Ridgely. Noble's straw hat might have brightened
under the treatment of lemon juice or other restorative; his scarf
was folded to hide a spot that worked steadily toward a complete
visibility, and some recent efforts upon his trousers with a tepid
iron, in his bedchamber at home, counteracted but feebly that
tendency of cloth to sculpture itself in hummocks upon repeated
pressure of the human knee.</p>

<p>All in all, nothing except the expression of Noble's face and
the somewhat ill-chosen pansy in his buttonhole hinted of the
remarkable. Yet even here was a thing for which he was not responsible
himself; it was altogether the work of Julia. What her work was,
in the case of Noble Dill, may be expressed in a word&mdash;a word
used not only by the whole Atwater family connection, in completely
expressing Noble's condition, but by Noble's own family connection
as well. This complete word was "awful."</p>

<p>Florence was the one exception on the Atwater side: she was far,
far from thinking or speaking of Noble Dill in that way, although,
until she looked up "uncouth" in Webster's Collegiate Dictionary,
she had not found suitable means to describe him. And now, as
she walked at his side, she found her sensations to be nothing
short of thrilling. For it must be borne in mind that this was
her first and wholly unexpected outburst into society; the experience
was that of an obscure aerolite suddenly become a noble meteor.
She longed to say or do something magnificent&mdash;something strange
and exhilarating, in keeping with her new station in life.</p>

<p>It was this longing, and by no means a confirmed unveracity,
that prompted her to amplify her comments upon her own filial
independence. "Oh, I guess I pretty near never do anything I don't
want to," she said. "I kind of run the house to suit myself. I
guess if the truth had to be told, I just about run the whole
Atwater family, when it comes to that!"</p>

<p>The statement was so noticeable that it succeeded in turning
Noble's attention from the back of Julia's head. "You do?" he
said. "Well, that seems queer," he added absently.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know!" she laughed. In her increasing exaltation
things appeared actually to be as she wished them to be; an atmosphere
both queenly and adventurous seemed to invest her, and any remnants
of human caution in her were assuaged by the circumstance that
her Aunt Julia's attention was subject to the strong demands necessarily
imposed upon anybody taking a walk between two gentlemen who do
not "speak" to each other. "Oh, I don't know," said Florence.
"The family's used to it by this time, I guess. The way I do things,
they haf to be, I guess. When they don't like it I don't say much
for a while, then I just&#11834;" She paused, waiting for her imagination
to supply a sequel to the drama just sketched. "Well, I guess
they kind of find out they better step around pretty lively,"
she concluded darkly. "They don't bother around <em>too</em> much!"</p>

<p>"I suppose not," said Noble, his vacancy and credulity continuing
to dovetail perfectly.</p>

<p>"You bet not!" the exuberant Florence thought proper to suggest
as a preferable expression. And then she had an inspiration to
enliven his dreamy interest in her conversation. "Grandpa, he's
the one I kind of run most of all of 'em. He's about fifty or
sixty, and so he hasn't got too much sense. What I mean, he hasn't
got too much sense <em>left</em>, you know. So I haf to sort of
take holt every now and then." She lowered her voice a little,
some faint whisper of discretion reaching her inward ear. "Aunt
Julia can't do a thing with him. I guess that's maybe the reason
she kind of depen's on me so much; or anyway somep'n like that.
You know, f'r instance, I had to help talk grandpa into lettin'
her send to New York for her things. Aunt Julia gets all her things
in New York."</p>

<p>Undeniably, Mr. Dill's interest flickered up. "<em>Things</em>?"
he repeated inquiringly. "Her things?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Everything she wears, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"What I was goin' to tell you," Florence continued, "you know
grandpa just about hates everybody. Anyhow, he'd like to have
some peace and quiet once in a while in his own house, he says,
instead of all this moil and turmoil, and because the doctor said
all the matter with her was she eats too much candy, and they
keep sendin' more all the time&mdash;and there's somep'n the trouble
with grandpa: it makes him sick to smell violets: he had it ever
since he was a little boy, and he can't help it; and he hates
animals, and they keep sendin' her Airedales and Persian kittens,
and then there was that alligator came from Florida and upset
Kitty Silver terribly&mdash;and so, you see, grandpa just hates the
whole everlasting business."</p>

<p>Mr. Dill nodded and spoke with conviction: "He's absolutely right;
absolutely!"</p>

<p>"Well, some ways he is," said Florence; and she added confidentially:
"The trouble is, he seems to think you're about as bad as any
of 'em."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"<em>Well</em>!" Florence exclaimed, with upward gestures both
of eye and of hand, to signify what she left untold of Mr. Atwater's
orations upon his favourite subject: Noble Dill. "It's torrable!"
she added.</p>

<p>Noble breathed heavily, but a thought struggled in him and a
brightening appeared upon him. "You mean&#11834;" he began. "Do you
mean it's terrible for your Aunt Julia? Do you mean his injustice
about me makes her feel terribly?"</p>

<p>"No," said Florence. "No: I mean the way he goes on about everybody.
But Aunt Julia's kind of used to it. And anyhow you needn't worry
about him 'long as I'm on your side. He won't do anything much
to you if I say not to. Hardly anything at all." And then, with
almost a tenderness, as she marked the visibly insufficient reassurance
of her companion, she said handsomely: "He won't say a word. I'll
tell him not to."</p>

<p>Noble was dazed; no novelty, for he had been dazed almost continually
during the past seven months, since a night when dancing with
Julia, whom he had known all his life, he "noticed for the first
time what she looked like." (This was his mother's description.)
Somewhere, he vaguely recalled, he had read of the extraordinary
influence possessed by certain angelic kinds of children; he knew,
too, what favourite grandchildren can do with grandfathers. The
effect upon him was altogether base; he immediately sought by
flattery to increase and retain Florence's kindness. "I always
<em>thought</em> you seemed to know more than most girls of your
age," he began.</p>

<p>It was a great afternoon for Florence. From time to time she
glanced over her shoulder at the switching skirt, and increased
its radius of action, though this probably required more exercise,
compared to the extent of ground covered, than any lady member
of a walking-party had ever before taken, merely as a pedestrian.
Meanwhile, she chattered on, but found time to listen to the pleasant
things said to her by her companion; and though most of these
were, in truth, rather vague, she was won to him more than he
knew. Henceforth she was to be his champion indeed, sometimes
with greater energy than he would need.</p>

<p>... The two were left alone together by Julia's gate when the
walk (as short as Julia dared to make it) was over.</p>

<p>"Well," Florence said, "I've had quite a nice time. I hope you
enjoyed yourself nicely, too, Mr. Dill." Then her eye rose to
the overhanging branch of a shade-tree near them. "Would you like
to see me chin myself?" she asked, stepping beneath the branch.
"I bet I could skin-the-cat on that limb! Would you like to see
me do it?"</p>

<p>"I would <em>so</em>!" the flatterer enthused.</p>

<p>She became thoughtful, remembering that she was now a lady who
took walks with grown gentlemen. "I can, but I won't," she said.
"I used to do lots of things like that. I used to whenever I felt
like it. I could chin myself four times and Herbert only three.
I was lots better than Herbert when I used to do all kinds of
things like that."</p>

<p>"Were you?"</p>

<p>She laughed as in a musing retrospect of times gone by. "I guess
I used to be a pretty queer kind of a girl in those days," she
said. "Well &mdash;I s'pose we ought to say good-bye for the present,
so to speak, Mr. Dill."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so."</p>

<p>"Well&#11834;" She stood looking at him expectantly, but he said
nothing more. "Well, good-bye for the present, Mr. Dill," she
said again, and, turning, walked away with dignity. But a moment
later she forgot all about her skirt and scampered.</p>
