<p>Meanwhile, the families of the settlers and their escorts were
not idle.</p>

<p>Turned back, when on the threshold as it were of success, they
bore their hard lot with the fortitude and uncomplaining courage
which was one of the most marked characteristics of the pioneers
of the West.</p>

<p>They had entered the "promised land," as may be said, for all
of the Ashbridges and Altmans had passed through the door of the
cabin in the clearing; they had deposited their household goods
and worldly possessions in the structure erected with so much
care and labor; then, being warned of the imminent peril of staying,
had set out for the block-house, ten miles distant, there to remain
until it was safe for them to venture once more into the wilderness.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone was in advance of the company, scouting in the neighborhood
of Rattlesnake Gulch, for it was indispensable that he should
keep watch of the main war party of Shawanoes there, and learn,
as far as possible, their intentions towards the whites.</p>

<p>Kenton had turned back to the clearing in quest of the canoe
with which he hoped to carry the families across the Ohio during
the favoring darkness of the night without discovery by the dusky
enemies. We left him pushing his way up stream, after his deadly
encounter with the Shawanoe who had withdrawn the craft from where
it was left by the ranger during his temporary absence.</p>

<p>It may be said, that every man and woman, threading their way
through the wilderness to the block-house, understood the scheme
which it was hoped could be carried through to completion, and
each, of course, was eager to lend his aid to its success.</p>

<p>Within ten minutes, therefore, of the departure of Kenton and
Jethro Juggens, those whom they left behind took up the journey
eastward&mdash;that is, toward dreaded Rattlesnake Gulch, which intervened
between them and the post under the command of Captain Bushwick.</p>

<p>The line of march was simple. Weber Hastings acted as guide,
or rather avant-courier, since all knew the route that was to
be followed. He kept a hundred yards, or so, in advance of the
company, which timed their gait to his, so that the intervening
space was neither increased nor diminished.</p>

<p>A second scout kept pace with his chief, but so far removed to
the right, and deeper in the forest, that only rarely did they
catch sight of each other. There were no guards on the left or
at the rear, the two named being considered sufficient to give
timely notice of the approach of danger.</p>

<p>There was no attempt at anything like military order on the part
of the others. The pioneer scouts were impatient of discipline,
preferring to "fight fire with fire"&mdash;that is, to combat the Indian
by methods peculiar to the Indians themselves.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the rest of the rangers straggled along, inclosing,
so far as possible, the members of the families whom they hoped
to deliver from their great peril. Mr. Ashbridge and his wife
sauntered in front of their old friends, with little Mabel most
of the time between them and holding a hand of each. Her disposition,
however, to dart aside and pluck every brilliant flower that flashed
among the green vegetation could not be restrained at all times,
and was the cause of much anxiety on the part of her parents.</p>

<p>Next in order walked Mr. Altman and his wife, while of Agnes,
the daughter, and George, it may be said they brought up the rear.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Agnes, in her low, sweet voice, "whether, when
we reach the block-house, we shall be safe, or whether we shall
have to keep on going east until we arrive at our old home in
Virginia before we can feel beyond the power of these dreadful
red men."</p>

<p>"Why do you express that doubt, when it has been a good many
years since the people in our old homes have suffered from the
Indians?"</p>

<p>"Not so long ago that I cannot remember it."</p>

<p>"But don't forget that you are seventeen years old&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Several months more, please to remember, sir."</p>

<p>"And you can remember, I suppose, a dozen years; that is a good
while. But it is not so bad as all that. Kenton explained matters
yesterday when I was talking with him. There is what is called
a flurry among the Indians, and as long as it lasts we must keep
under the wing of some block-house or in some settlement."</p>

<p>"But how long is it to last?"</p>

<p>"There is only One who can answer that question. It may be in
a few weeks, or months, or possibly a year or two. You know that
such expeditions as Crawford's and St. Clair's make matters worse
than before."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Colonel Crawford, as you remember, was not only defeated, but
he was made prisoner and burned to death at the stake. Then President
Washington sent General St. Clair, and the combined tribes smote
him hip and thigh. All this makes the Indians bolder and more
open in their hostility, until I have no doubt that hundreds of
them believe they are strong enough to drive every white man out
of Ohio and Kentucky."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't General Washington send some one who knows how to
fight the Indians, and with men enough to whip them?"</p>

<p>"St. Clair had enough men to whip the enemy, but the general
didn't know how to handle them when he got into the Indian country.
You have learned of the dreadful mistake that Braddock and his
regulars made more than thirty years ago, during the French and
Indian war, when all of the British soldiers would have been killed
if it had not been for Washington and his Virginians."</p>

<p>"I should think General Washington himself would take command
of a force. I know he would end all this trouble," added Agnes,
with a glow of pride in the illustrious Father of his Country.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt he would if he wasn't President; but he has
to stay in Philadelphia and make the other officers do their duty.
But if he can't come himself, he knows enough now to send the
right men. The next battle will see the Indians so badly whipped
that they will stay so for many, many years to come."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Hundreds and thousands of people will come from the East and
settle in the West. The land will be cleared off and planted;
cities and towns will spring up, and that clearing of ours, with
the other acres we shall add, will make you and I wealthy, Agnes."</p>

<p>"It may make you wealthy, George; but how can it help me?"</p>

<p>He gave the dainty hand a warmer pressure than before and lowered
his voice, so that only the shell-like ear, so close to his own,
could catch his words.</p>

<p>"If it benefits me it must benefit you; for, God willing, long
before that time we shall be one. Am I wrong in that hope, dearest?"</p>

<p>"George," said Agnes, when they had walked a little further in
silence, "there is one prospect which causes me some discomfort."</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"Of all our people being cooped up in the block-house for weeks,
and perhaps months, until the trouble with the Indians is over.
We stopped there the other day when we were coming down the river.
It is a large, roomy structure, but there is nothing beside the
single building. A good many men make their homes there at different
times, and though they are all as kind as they can be, it will
be anything but pleasant when your folks and ours are added to
them."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder that you feel thus. The same thought has occurred
to me and Kenton, and I guess every one else. Some other arrangement
will have to be made. Captain Bushwick will have several strong
cabins put up, if it looks as though you will have to stay more
than a few days, or he may do better than that."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Send us all to Boonesboro. That's where the great Daniel Boone,
that's helping us just now, makes his home. It was named for him.
It is a regular stockade, with a number of cabins inside, and
abundant room for twenty families or more."</p>

<p>"How far off is it?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure, but less than fifty miles."</p>

<p>"Why not go there at once, without stopping at the block-house?"</p>

<p>"The trouble is that, if it would be safe to make the journey
there now, it would be just as safe to stay in our own house at
the clearing. The route leads through one of the most dangerous
regions in Kentucky."</p>

<p>"If that is the case, how can we reach it from the block-house?"</p>

<p>"It will have to be done by awaiting some favorable chance; that
chance, as you know, isn't now, but it may come in a short time.
Kenton or Boone, or some of their men, will be quick to learn
it."</p>

<p>Agnes was about to reply, when one of the rangers, who had wandered
somewhat ahead or to one side, emitted a cry that must have penetrated
a goodly part of a mile. His terrified friends stopped short,
grasped their rifles more tightly, and stared wonderingly at the
man, who was acting like a crazy person.</p>

<p>He had flung his gun aside, and caught up a heavy stick, with
which he was threshing something on the ground.</p>

<p>It required hardly a second glance from those who ran toward
him to recognize the writhing object as an immense rattlesnake.
The man seemed to be in a frenzy, and continued belaboring the
reptile even after all saw it was as dead as dead could be.</p>

<p>"What's the use, Jim?" called Hastings, who had hastened to return
upon hearing his wild shout; "he's gone under; did he bite you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the other, in a husky voice staggering backward
and sinking to the ground; "he bit me twice before I seed him;
I'm done for."</p>
