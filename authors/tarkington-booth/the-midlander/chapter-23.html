<p>‟<em>HOW </em>in the world did that cunning little wife of his
ever fall in love with him?" Frederic’s companion inquired, watching
the emerging procession of the dining party. "He always looks
as if he had something else on his mind when he’s with women—as
if he didn’t think they’re worth talkin’ to. She looks about half
his age. Of course you can’t tell, though; everybody uses so much
makeup nowadays. They say she belongs to awf’ly important people
in New York and never liked it here because she couldn’t get enough
music. You didn’t answer my question: Aren’t they ever goin’ to
get married? I mean your cousin Harlan and that big Miss Shelby.
How in the world do they find anything to <em>say</em> to each
other? Gosh, if I kept a man hangin’ on that long I’d certainly
be talked out! How in the world can two people <em>stand</em>
seein’ each other all the time like that?"</p>

<p>"I can comprehend the gentleman’s half of it," said the gallant
Frederic. "I believe Miss Shelby goes abroad for a few months
now and then to make her own share of the association more endurable."</p>

<p>Martha had been at home only a week, in fact, after one of these
excursions; though she did not make them for the reason set forth
by Frederic Oliphant, who was now much given to the reading of
eighteenth-century French memoirs and the polishing of his diction.
She went, she airily explained to Harlan, to gather materials
that would enable her to defend the Renaissance; but as he drove
home with her from the dinner at the Country Club, this evening,
he observed that the materials she had gathered impressed him
as "about as deep into the twentieth century as mechanics and
upholsterers were able to go." His allusion was to the expensive
closed car she had brought from Paris;—her old bit of hickory,
impossible to be bent an atom’s width in business, yielded with
no more than a faint squeak when his daughter was lavish with
herself. "Spend what you plague-taken want to," he said, "so long
as you don’t ask <em>me</em> to ride in the devilish contrapshun!"</p>

<p>"He says he’ll stick to his horses and our old carriage until
they’re ‘chased off the road,’" Martha told Harlan, on this homeward
drive. "It doesn’t seem to me that’s so far ahead. Why hasn’t
Dan ever done anything about the motor-car factory he was going
to build?"</p>

<p>"He has," Harlan said, and laughed. "In talk he has, that is!
He’s been talking about it for years, almost as much as he has
about Ornaby."</p>

<p>"Then why doesn’t he——"</p>

<p>"Still dancing on the tight-rope!" Harlan laughed. "He’s got
his car line through the Addition—I understand your father explodes
completely whenever it’s mentioned to him—but Dan’s spending fortunes
on new streets and sewers and what not. He’s actually trying to
open a big tract still farther out, north of Ornaby; and I don’t
believe he’s able to keep money in his hands long enough to go
into building cars. You’d <em>think</em> he’s building them though,
if you’d listen to him! He talks about the ‘Ornaby Car’ to everybody;
I suppose he believes it’s a lucky name. He <em>has</em> got his
Addition booming though—no question. He’s making the countryside
more and more horrible every day. It’s much worse than it was
last year."</p>

<p>"How is it horrible?"</p>

<p>"I could tell you, but it’s ten to one that if I merely told
you, you’d become Ornaby’s defender—you’re so everlastingly its
defender! I’d rather show you, if you’d take me as a passenger
in this jewelled palanquin of yours to-morrow."</p>

<p>Martha assented, and the next afternoon her neat young mechanic
drove them northward over the road once travelled on a hot and
threatening morning by a "rubber-tired runabout" in which sat
a disappointed little bride and a perplexed bridegroom. On that
dusty morning, already of the long ago, the way had soon become
rustic; the cedar-block paving, itself worn and jolty, had stopped
short not much more than a mile from its beginning; then came
macadam, but not for long; and then the rough country road, leading
north between the great flat fields of corn and wheat to where
it became a slough in winter, and tall grass and even ironweed
grew between the ruts in summer—for there it reached the soggy
and tangled groves of Ornaby.</p>

<p>But on this brisk autumn afternoon, the crystal and enamel of
the silent French car went glistening serenely along a level white
way of asphalt. The fields, above which the troubled bride and
groom had seen rising the clouds of the summer storm, were fields
no longer; for here was bungalow-land, acres and acres of bungalows,
with brick groceries and drug stores at some of the street corners,
and two or three wooden church spires slenderly asserting their
right to look down on all the rest. Cross streets gave glimpses
of trolley cars on other north-and-south thoroughfares; great
brick schoolhouses, unbearably plain, were to be seen, and a few
apartment buildings, not made more beautiful by pinchbeck torturing
of their façades.</p>

<p>"Of course Dan has no responsibility for this particular awfulness,"
Harlan explained. "Without rime or reason the town just decided
to grow, and luckily for him it’s grown faster out this northern
way than it has in any other direction. Some people seem to think
he performed an enchantment to make it do it, but it just happened."</p>

<p>"It seems to happen faster and faster," Martha observed. "The
last time I drove out this far was in our old carriage with papa,
not quite a year ago, I think; and there were dozens of vacant
lots; but now there are hardly any. The asphalt wasn’t finished
clear into Ornaby then, though Dan had built a fine road through.
I suppose now——"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; now he’s got asphalt on his cross streets, too; and
the southern part of Ornaby is so like this you couldn’t tell
when you get into it, if it weren’t for the disasters he calls
his signboards. Look at that!"</p>

<p>As they spoke the swift car had brought them into a region where
there was more vacant ground; and the little houses, nearly all
of wood, were not so closely crowded. On a stretch of weedy land,
rising slightly above new cement sidewalks, there smote the eye
a painted wooden wall two hundred feet long. With enormous yellow
words on a black background the thing not only staggered the vision
of a passer-by, but seemed to bellow in his ear: "You Are Now
Entering Ornaby Addition! Build a Home in Ornaby the Beautiful!
Every Ornaby Buyer is an Ornaby Booster."</p>

<p>Beyond came a region of more bungalows: "Homes Beautiful of Ornaby
the Beautiful" another bellowing signboard declared them to be;
and, not blushing in the very presence of the dwellings and dwellers
it thus made proclamation for, went on to insist once more upon
the enthusiasm necessarily a consequence in the bosom of any one
who became an "Ornaby Buyer." There was a briskness about the
place: children went busily roller-skating over the new sidewalks;
clotheslines were flying their Monday white pennants on the breeze;
other bungalows were noisily getting themselves built, and farther
on were some white cottages;—"quite pretty," Martha said they
were. Beyond them the open spaces were broader, and the little
houses more infrequent; but the asphalt street went on, with numbered
white posts marking the building lots, paved cross streets running
to right and left into thicket-bordered distances, and Dan’s great
signboards shouting along the front of untouched acres of old
forest.</p>

<p>"You see for yourself," Harlan said. "This <em>was</em> beautiful
before ‘Ornaby the Beautiful’ insulted the landscape. But now,
with all these flimsy and dreadful bungalows and the signboards
screeching at the trees——"</p>

<p>"Yes," she interrupted, "but he’s spared all the trees he could,
even back there where the bungalows and little houses were so
thick. And I noticed the people were planting shrubberies and
trying to make little gardens grow. It might be really very pretty
some day. And just here——"</p>

<p>"Oh, here," Harlan said, "where he hasn’t touched it yet, it’s
well enough, of course. But you’ll find it’s only a question of
time till he spoils it, though I understand he intends this to
be what he calls a ’restricted residence district.’"</p>

<p>The paved street ran between tall woods now; the numbered lots
were broad, and the car passed a few proudly marked "Sold." Then
Martha noticed one that was several hundred feet wide, and in
depth extended indefinitely into a grove of magnificent beech
trees. Stone pillars gave entrance upon a partly completed driveway
that disappeared round an evergreen thicket, not long planted.
"What a pleasant place to live! It’s getting so smoky in town
it seems to me people will have to be moving out even this far
some day. Whose place is that?"</p>

<p>"Dan’s," Harlan said, with his dry laugh. "At least he says he
plans to build there sometime. I don’t think Lena cares about
it much! I heard her speaking of it as ‘out at the end of Nowhere.’
One of the interesting things about my sister-in-law, to me, is
the fact that she’s really never wanted a house of her own. She’s
never once proposed such a thing in all this time, I believe,
but goes on living with father and mother; and year after year
passes without altering that air of hers of being only temporarily
marooned in what she still calls ‘the West.’"</p>

<p>Martha looked serious, but said nothing, and he spoke to the
chauffeur, who turned westward at the next cross street. At the
end of a block it ceased to be a street and became a newly gravelled
road, a transformation that interested Harlan. "Funny!" he said.
"I was out this way a couple of months ago and this was a dirt
road with a good deal of grass on it. Now he’s had it gravelled.
It leads over to the west side of his land, where he laid out
the site for his factory, years ago. I thought you might like
to see that."</p>

<p>But before they approached the site of Dan’s factory, they passed
a long line of trucks and wagons bound their way; wagon after
wagon laden with bricks, and truck loads of lumber, of drainage
tile, of steel girders and of cement, and there were great-wheeled
carriers of stone. As they came closer they saw that many two-story
double houses for workmen and their families were being built
on both sides of the road; and, beyond these, long lines of brick
walls were rising, broken into regular open oblongs where the
ample glass of a modern factory building was to be set.</p>

<p>"By George!" Harlan exclaimed, surprised almost to the point
of dismay. "He <em>is</em> going it! Why, he’s got the thing half
up!" And he said, "By George!" again, seeing the figure of his
brother on a section of roof and outlined against the sky. "There
he is—and in his element!"</p>

<p>"You mean in the sky?" Martha asked, her eyes brightening.</p>

<p>"No; I mean hustling. Keeping everybody on the jump while he
defaces the landscape some more! That’s his element, isn’t it?"</p>

<p>Dan was indeed in that element and it was truly his. He could
be seen waving his arms at the workmen; shouting to foremen; running
along the roof and calling to teamsters, instructing them where
to dump their loads. His voice was audible to the occupants of
the French car that stopped for a few moments in the road; and
they became aware that he addressed the workmen, both white and
coloured, by their first names or their nicknames exclusively;
his shoutings were all to "Jim" or "Mike" or "Shorty" or "Tony"
or "Gumbo."</p>

<p>A moment after the car stopped, a smaller figure climbed up the
slope of the low roof and joined the towering and bulky one on
the ridge. "He’s got my charming-mannered nephew with him," Harlan
said. "What time he can spare from spoiling the landscape he puts
into spoiling Henry!"</p>

<p>"Is that Henry?" Martha asked incredulously; then, as she saw
Dan put his right arm about the boy’s shoulder, guarding him carefully
from a misstep, she replied to herself. "Yes, it really is. Gracious,
how time runs away from us!"</p>

<p>Turning to shout at some one in their direction, Dan saw them,
and waved his free arm cordially in greeting; but he made no motion
as if to descend, and went on immediately with his shouting to
the men. Martha said, "We’ll go now," to the chauffeur; and the
car instantly moved forward.</p>

<p>She leaned back, smiling. "He’s in his glory," she said. "It
all goes on arriving, Harlan. His great days have come!" </p>
