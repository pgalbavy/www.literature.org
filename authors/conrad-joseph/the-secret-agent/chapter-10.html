<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The Assistant Commissioner, driven rapidly in a hansom from the
neighbourhood of Soho in the direction of Westminster, got out
at the very centre of the Empire on which the sun never sets. 
Some stalwart constables, who did not seem particularly impressed
by the duty of watching the august spot, saluted him.  Penetrating
through a portal by no means lofty into the precincts of the House
which is <em>the</em> House, <em>par excellence</em> in the minds
of many millions of men, he was met at last by the volatile and
revolutionary Toodles.</p>

<p>That neat and nice young man concealed his astonishment at the
early appearance of the Assistant Commissioner, whom he had been
told to look out for some time about midnight.  His turning up
so early he concluded to be the sign that things, whatever they
were, had gone wrong.  With an extremely ready sympathy, which
in nice youngsters goes often with a joyous temperament, he felt
sorry for the great Presence he called "The Chief," and also for
the Assistant Commissioner, whose face appeared to him more ominously
wooden than ever before, and quite wonderfully long. "What a queer,
foreign-looking chap he is," he thought to himself, smiling from
a distance with friendly buoyancy.  And directly they came together
he began to talk with the kind intention of burying the awkwardness
of failure under a heap of words.  It looked as if the great assault
threatened for that night were going to fizzle out.  An inferior
henchman of "that brute Cheeseman" was up boring mercilessly a
very thin House with some shamelessly cooked statistics.  He,
Toodles, hoped he would bore them into a count out every minute. 
But then he might be only marking time to let that guzzling Cheeseman
dine at his leisure.  Anyway, the Chief could not be persuaded
to go home.</p>

<p>"He will see you at once, I think.  He’s sitting all alone in
his room thinking of all the fishes of the sea," concluded Toodles
airily.  "Come along."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the kindness of his disposition, the young private
secretary (unpaid) was accessible to the common failings of humanity. 
He did not wish to harrow the feelings of the Assistant Commissioner,
who looked to him uncommonly like a man who has made a mess of
his job.  But his curiosity was too strong to be restrained by
mere compassion.  He could not help, as they went along, to throw
over his shoulder lightly:</p>

<p>"And your sprat?"</p>

<p>"Got him," answered the Assistant Commissioner with a concision
which did not mean to be repellent in the least.</p>

<p>"Good.  You’ve no idea how these great men dislike to be disappointed
in small things."</p>

<p>After this profound observation the experienced Toodles seemed
to reflect.  At any rate he said nothing for quite two seconds. 
Then:</p>

<p>"I’m glad.  But—I say—is it really such a very small thing as
you make it out?"</p>

<p>"Do you know what may be done with a sprat?" the Assistant Commissioner
asked in his turn.</p>

<p>"He’s sometimes put into a sardine box," chuckled Toodles, whose
erudition on the subject of the fishing industry was fresh and,
in comparison with his ignorance of all other industrial matters,
immense. "There are sardine canneries on the Spanish coast which—"</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner interrupted the apprentice statesman.</p>

<p>"Yes.  Yes.  But a sprat is also thrown away sometimes in order
to catch a whale."</p>

<p>"A whale.  Phew!" exclaimed Toodles, with bated breath.  "You’re
after a whale, then?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly.  What I am after is more like a dog-fish.  You
don’t know perhaps what a dog-fish is like."</p>

<p>"Yes; I do.  We’re buried in special books up to our necks—whole
shelves full of them—with plates. . . . It’s a noxious, rascally-looking,
altogether detestable beast, with a sort of smooth face and moustaches."</p>

<p>"Described to a T," commended the Assistant Commissioner.  "Only
mine is clean-shaven altogether.  You’ve seen him.  It’s a witty
fish."</p>

<p>"I have seen him!" said Toodles incredulously.  "I can’t conceive
where I could have seen him."</p>

<p>"At the Explorers, I should say," dropped the Assistant Commissioner
calmly.  At the name of that extremely exclusive club Toodles
looked scared, and stopped short.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he protested, but in an awe-struck tone.  "What do
you mean? A member?"</p>

<p>"Honorary," muttered the Assistant Commissioner through his teeth.</p>

<p>"Heavens!"</p>

<p>Toodles looked so thunderstruck that the Assistant Commissioner
smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"That’s between ourselves strictly," he said.</p>

<p>"That’s the beastliest thing I’ve ever heard in my life," declared
Toodles feebly, as if astonishment had robbed him of all his buoyant
strength in a second.</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner gave him an unsmiling glance.  Till
they came to the door of the great man’s room, Toodles preserved
a scandalised and solemn silence, as though he were offended with
the Assistant Commissioner for exposing such an unsavoury and
disturbing fact.  It revolutionised his idea of the Explorers’
Club’s extreme selectness, of its social purity.  Toodles was
revolutionary only in politics; his social beliefs and personal
feelings he wished to preserve unchanged through all the years
allotted to him on this earth which, upon the whole, he believed
to be a nice place to live on.</p>

<p>He stood aside.</p>

<p>"Go in without knocking," he said.</p>

<p>Shades of green silk fitted low over all the lights imparted
to the room something of a forest’s deep gloom.  The haughty eyes
were physically the great man’s weak point.  This point was wrapped
up in secrecy.  When an opportunity offered, he rested them conscientiously.</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner entering saw at first only a big pale
hand supporting a big head, and concealing the upper part of a
big pale face. An open despatch-box stood on the writing-table
near a few oblong sheets of paper and a scattered handful of quill
pens.  There was absolutely nothing else on the large flat surface
except a little bronze statuette draped in a toga, mysteriously
watchful in its shadowy immobility.  The Assistant Commissioner,
invited to take a chair, sat down.  In the dim light, the salient
points of his personality, the long face, the black hair, his
lankness, made him look more foreign than ever.</p>

<p>The great man manifested no surprise, no eagerness, no sentiment
whatever.  The attitude in which he rested his menaced eyes was
profoundly meditative.  He did not alter it the least bit.  But
his tone was not dreamy.</p>

<p>"Well!  What is it that you’ve found out already?  You came upon
something unexpected on the first step."</p>

<p>"Not exactly unexpected, Sir Ethelred.  What I mainly came upon
was a psychological state."</p>

<p>The Great Presence made a slight movement.  "You must be lucid,
please."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir Ethelred.  You know no doubt that most criminals at
some time or other feel an irresistible need of confessing—of
making a clean breast of it to somebody—to anybody.  And they
do it often to the police.  In that Verloc whom Heat wished so
much to screen I’ve found a man in that particular psychological
state.  The man, figuratively speaking, flung himself on my breast. 
It was enough on my part to whisper to him who I was and to add
‘I know that you are at the bottom of this affair.’  It must have
seemed miraculous to him that we should know already, but he took
it all in the stride.  The wonderfulness of it never checked him
for a moment.  There remained for me only to put to him the two
questions: Who put you up to it? and Who was the man who did it? 
He answered the first with remarkable emphasis.  As to the second
question, I gather that the fellow with the bomb was his brother-in-law—quite
a lad—a weak-minded creature. . . . It is rather a curious affair—too
long perhaps to state fully just now."</p>

<p>"What then have you learned?" asked the great man.</p>

<p>"First, I’ve learned that the ex-convict Michaelis had nothing
to do with it, though indeed the lad had been living with him
temporarily in the country up to eight o’clock this morning. 
It is more than likely that Michaelis knows nothing of it to this
moment."</p>

<p>"You are positive as to that?" asked the great man.</p>

<p>"Quite certain, Sir Ethelred.  This fellow Verloc went there
this morning, and took away the lad on the pretence of going out
for a walk in the lanes.  As it was not the first time that he
did this, Michaelis could not have the slightest suspicion of
anything unusual.  For the rest, Sir Ethelred, the indignation
of this man Verloc had left nothing in doubt—nothing whatever. 
He had been driven out of his mind almost by an extraordinary
performance, which for you or me it would be difficult to take
as seriously meant, but which produced a great impression obviously
on him."</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner then imparted briefly to the great
man, who sat still, resting his eyes under the screen of his hand,
Mr Verloc’s appreciation of Mr Vladimir’s proceedings and character. 
The Assistant Commissioner did not seem to refuse it a certain
amount of competency. But the great personage remarked:</p>

<p>"All this seems very fantastic."</p>

<p>"Doesn’t it?  One would think a ferocious joke.  But our man
took it seriously, it appears.  He felt himself threatened.  In
the time, you know, he was in direct communication with old Stott-Wartenheim
himself, and had come to regard his services as indispensable. 
It was an extremely rude awakening.  I imagine that he lost his
head.  He became angry and frightened.  Upon my word, my impression
is that he thought these Embassy people quite capable not only
to throw him out but, to give him away too in some manner or other—"</p>

<p>"How long were you with him," interrupted the Presence from behind
his big hand.</p>

<p>"Some forty minutes, Sir Ethelred, in a house of bad repute called
Continental Hotel, closeted in a room which by-the-by I took for
the night.  I found him under the influence of that reaction which
follows the effort of crime.  The man cannot be defined as a hardened
criminal. It is obvious that he did not plan the death of that
wretched lad—his brother-in-law.  That was a shock to him—I could
see that.  Perhaps he is a man of strong sensibilities.  Perhaps
he was even fond of the lad—who knows?  He might have hoped that
the fellow would get clear away; in which case it would have been
almost impossible to bring this thing home to anyone.  At any
rate he risked consciously nothing more but arrest for him."</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner paused in his speculations to reflect
for a moment.</p>

<p>"Though how, in that last case, he could hope to have his own
share in the business concealed is more than I can tell," he continued,
in his ignorance of poor Stevie’s devotion to Mr Verloc (who was
<em>good</em>), and of his truly peculiar dumbness, which in the
old affair of fireworks on the stairs had for many years resisted
entreaties, coaxing, anger, and other means of investigation used
by his beloved sister.  For Stevie was loyal. . . .  "No, I can’t
imagine.  It’s possible that he never thought of that at all. 
It sounds an extravagant way of putting it, Sir Ethelred, but
his state of dismay suggested to me an impulsive man who, after
committing suicide with the notion that it would end all his troubles,
had discovered that it did nothing of the kind."</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner gave this definition in an apologetic
voice. But in truth there is a sort of lucidity proper to extravagant
language, and the great man was not offended.  A slight jerky
movement of the big body half lost in the gloom of the green silk
shades, of the big head leaning on the big hand, accompanied an
intermittent stifled but powerful sound.  The great man had laughed.</p>

<p>"What have you done with him?"</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner answered very readily:</p>

<p>"As he seemed very anxious to get back to his wife in the shop
I let him go, Sir Ethelred."</p>

<p>"You did?  But the fellow will disappear."</p>

<p>"Pardon me.  I don’t think so.  Where could he go to?  Moreover,
you must remember that he has got to think of the danger from
his comrades too. He’s there at his post.  How could he explain
leaving it?  But even if there were no obstacles to his freedom
of action he would do nothing.  At present he hasn’t enough moral
energy to take a resolution of any sort. Permit me also to point
out that if I had detained him we would have been committed to
a course of action on which I wished to know your precise intentions
first."</p>

<p>The great personage rose heavily, an imposing shadowy form in
the greenish gloom of the room.</p>

<p>"I’ll see the Attorney-General to-night, and will send for you
to-morrow morning.  Is there anything more you’d wish to tell
me now?"</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner had stood up also, slender and flexible.</p>

<p>"I think not, Sir Ethelred, unless I were to enter into details
which—"</p>

<p>"No.  No details, please."</p>

<p>The great shadowy form seemed to shrink away as if in physical
dread of details; then came forward, expanded, enormous, and weighty,
offering a large hand.  "And you say that this man has got a wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir Ethelred," said the Assistant Commissioner, pressing
deferentially the extended hand.  "A genuine wife and a genuinely,
respectably, marital relation.  He told me that after his interview
at the Embassy he would have thrown everything up, would have
tried to sell his shop, and leave the country, only he felt certain
that his wife would not even hear of going abroad.  Nothing could
be more characteristic of the respectable bond than that," went
on, with a touch of grimness, the Assistant Commissioner, whose
own wife too had refused to hear of going abroad.  "Yes, a genuine
wife.  And the victim was a genuine brother-in-law.  From a certain
point of view we are here in the presence of a domestic drama."</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner laughed a little; but the great man’s
thoughts seemed to have wandered far away, perhaps to the questions
of his country’s domestic policy, the battle-ground of his crusading
valour against the paynim Cheeseman.  The Assistant Commissioner
withdrew quietly, unnoticed, as if already forgotten.</p>

<p>He had his own crusading instincts.  This affair, which, in one
way or another, disgusted Chief Inspector Heat, seemed to him
a providentially given starting-point for a crusade.  He had it
much at heart to begin. He walked slowly home, meditating that
enterprise on the way, and thinking over Mr Verloc’s psychology
in a composite mood of repugnance and satisfaction.  He walked
all the way home.  Finding the drawing-room dark, he went upstairs,
and spent some time between the bedroom and the dressing-room,
changing his clothes, going to and fro with the air of a thoughtful
somnambulist.  But he shook it off before going out again to join
his wife at the house of the great lady patroness of Michaelis.</p>

<p>He knew he would be welcomed there.  On entering the smaller
of the two drawing-rooms he saw his wife in a small group near
the piano.  A youngish composer in pass of becoming famous was
discoursing from a music stool to two thick men whose backs looked
old, and three slender women whose backs looked young.  Behind
the screen the great lady had only two persons with her: a man
and a woman, who sat side by side on arm-chairs at the foot of
her couch.  She extended her hand to the Assistant Commissioner.</p>

<p>"I never hoped to see you here to-night.  Annie told me—"</p>

<p>"Yes.  I had no idea myself that my work would be over so soon."</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner added in a low tone: "I am glad to
tell you that Michaelis is altogether clear of this—"</p>

<p>The patroness of the ex-convict received this assurance indignantly.</p>

<p>"Why?  Were your people stupid enough to connect him with—"</p>

<p>"Not stupid," interrupted the Assistant Commissioner, contradicting
deferentially.  "Clever enough—quite clever enough for that."</p>

<p>A silence fell.  The man at the foot of the couch had stopped
speaking to the lady, and looked on with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"I don’t know whether you ever met before," said the great lady.</p>

<p>Mr Vladimir and the Assistant Commissioner, introduced, acknowledged
each other’s existence with punctilious and guarded courtesy.</p>

<p>"He’s been frightening me," declared suddenly the lady who sat
by the side of Mr Vladimir, with an inclination of the head towards
that gentleman.  The Assistant Commissioner knew the lady.</p>

<p>"You do not look frightened," he pronounced, after surveying
her conscientiously with his tired and equable gaze.  He was thinking
meantime to himself that in this house one met everybody sooner
or later. Mr Vladimir’s rosy countenance was wreathed in smiles,
because he was witty, but his eyes remained serious, like the
eyes of convinced man.</p>

<p>"Well, he tried to at least," amended the lady.</p>

<p>"Force of habit perhaps," said the Assistant Commissioner, moved
by an irresistible inspiration.</p>

<p>"He has been threatening society with all sorts of horrors,"
continued the lady, whose enunciation was caressing and slow,
"apropos of this explosion in Greenwich Park.  It appears we all
ought to quake in our shoes at what’s coming if those people are
not suppressed all over the world.  I had no idea this was such
a grave affair."</p>

<p>Mr Vladimir, affecting not to listen, leaned towards the couch,
talking amiably in subdued tones, but he heard the Assistant Commissioner
say:</p>

<p>"I’ve no doubt that Mr Vladimir has a very precise notion of
the true importance of this affair."</p>

<p>Mr Vladimir asked himself what that confounded and intrusive
policeman was driving at.  Descended from generations victimised
by the instruments of an arbitrary power, he was racially, nationally,
and individually afraid of the police.  It was an inherited weakness,
altogether independent of his judgment, of his reason, of his
experience.  He was born to it.  But that sentiment, which resembled
the irrational horror some people have of cats, did not stand
in the way of his immense contempt for the English police.  He
finished the sentence addressed to the great lady, and turned
slightly in his chair.</p>

<p>"You mean that we have a great experience of these people.  Yes;
indeed, we suffer greatly from their activity, while you"—Mr Vladimir
hesitated for a moment, in smiling perplexity—"while you suffer
their presence gladly in your midst," he finished, displaying
a dimple on each clean-shaven cheek.  Then he added more gravely:
"I may even say—because you do."</p>

<p>When Mr Vladimir ceased speaking the Assistant Commissioner lowered
his glance, and the conversation dropped.  Almost immediately
afterwards Mr Vladimir took leave.</p>

<p>Directly his back was turned on the couch the Assistant Commissioner
rose too.</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to stay and take Annie home," said
the lady patroness of Michaelis.</p>

<p>"I find that I’ve yet a little work to do to-night."</p>

<p>"In connection—?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes—in a way."</p>

<p>"Tell me, what is it really—this horror?"</p>

<p>"It’s difficult to say what it is, but it may yet be a <em>cause
célèbre</em>," said the Assistant Commissioner.</p>

<p>He left the drawing-room hurriedly, and found Mr Vladimir still
in the hall, wrapping up his throat carefully in a large silk
handkerchief. Behind him a footman waited, holding his overcoat. 
Another stood ready to open the door.  The Assistant Commissioner
was duly helped into his coat, and let out at once.  After descending
the front steps he stopped, as if to consider the way he should
take.  On seeing this through the door held open, Mr Vladimir
lingered in the hall to get out a cigar and asked for a light. 
It was furnished to him by an elderly man out of livery with an
air of calm solicitude.  But the match went out; the footman then
closed the door, and Mr Vladimir lighted his large Havana with
leisurely care.</p>

<p>When at last he got out of the house, he saw with disgust the
"confounded policeman" still standing on the pavement.</p>

<p>"Can he be waiting for me," thought Mr Vladimir, looking up and
down for some signs of a hansom.  He saw none.  A couple of carriages
waited by the curbstone, their lamps blazing steadily, the horses
standing perfectly still, as if carved in stone, the coachmen
sitting motionless under the big fur capes, without as much as
a quiver stirring the white thongs of their big whips.  Mr Vladimir
walked on, and the "confounded policeman" fell into step at his
elbow.  He said nothing.  At the end of the fourth stride Mr Vladimir
felt infuriated and uneasy.  This could not last.</p>

<p>"Rotten weather," he growled savagely.</p>

<p>"Mild," said the Assistant Commissioner without passion.  He
remained silent for a little while.  "We’ve got hold of a man
called Verloc," he announced casually.</p>

<p>Mr Vladimir did not stumble, did not stagger back, did not change
his stride.  But he could not prevent himself from exclaiming:
"What?"  The Assistant Commissioner did not repeat his statement. 
"You know him," he went on in the same tone.</p>

<p>Mr Vladimir stopped, and became guttural.  "What makes you say
that?"</p>

<p>"I don’t.  It’s Verloc who says that."</p>

<p>"A lying dog of some sort," said Mr Vladimir in somewhat Oriental
phraseology.  But in his heart he was almost awed by the miraculous
cleverness of the English police.  The change of his opinion on
the subject was so violent that it made him for a moment feel
slightly sick. He threw away his cigar, and moved on.</p>

<p>"What pleased me most in this affair," the Assistant went on,
talking slowly, "is that it makes such an excellent starting-point
for a piece of work which I’ve felt must be taken in hand—that
is, the clearing out of this country of all the foreign political
spies, police, and that sort of—of—dogs.  In my opinion they are
a ghastly nuisance; also an element of danger.  But we can’t very
well seek them out individually.  The only way is to make their
employment unpleasant to their employers.  The thing’s becoming
indecent.  And dangerous too, for us, here."</p>

<p>Mr Vladimir stopped again for a moment.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"The prosecution of this Verloc will demonstrate to the public
both the danger and the indecency."</p>

<p>"Nobody will believe what a man of that sort says," said Mr Vladimir
contemptuously.</p>

<p>"The wealth and precision of detail will carry conviction to
the great mass of the public," advanced the Assistant Commissioner
gently.</p>

<p>"So that is seriously what you mean to do."</p>

<p>"We’ve got the man; we have no choice."</p>

<p>"You will be only feeding up the lying spirit of these revolutionary
scoundrels," Mr Vladimir protested.  "What do you want to make
a scandal for?—from morality—or what?"</p>

<p>Mr Vladimir’s anxiety was obvious.  The Assistant Commissioner
having ascertained in this way that there must be some truth in
the summary statements of Mr Verloc, said indifferently:</p>

<p>"There’s a practical side too.  We have really enough to do to
look after the genuine article.  You can’t say we are not effective. 
But we don’t intend to let ourselves be bothered by shams under
any pretext whatever."</p>

<p>Mr Vladimir’s tone became lofty.</p>

<p>"For my part, I can’t share your view.  It is selfish.  My sentiments
for my own country cannot be doubted; but I’ve always felt that
we ought to be good Europeans besides—I mean governments and men."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Assistant Commissioner simply.  "Only you look
at Europe from its other end.  But," he went on in a good-natured
tone, "the foreign governments cannot complain of the inefficiency
of our police. Look at this outrage; a case specially difficult
to trace inasmuch as it was a sham.  In less than twelve hours
we have established the identity of a man literally blown to shreds,
have found the organiser of the attempt, and have had a glimpse
of the inciter behind him.  And we could have gone further; only
we stopped at the limits of our territory."</p>

<p>"So this instructive crime was planned abroad," Mr Vladimir said
quickly. "You admit it was planned abroad?"</p>

<p>"Theoretically.  Theoretically only, on foreign territory; abroad
only by a fiction," said the Assistant Commissioner, alluding
to the character of Embassies, which are supposed to be part and
parcel of the country to which they belong.  "But that’s a detail. 
I talked to you of this business because it’s your government
that grumbles most at our police. You see that we are not so bad. 
I wanted particularly to tell you of our success."</p>

<p>"I’m sure I’m very grateful," muttered Mr Vladimir through his
teeth.</p>

<p>"We can put our finger on every anarchist here," went on the
Assistant Commissioner, as though he were quoting Chief Inspector
Heat.  "All that’s wanted now is to do away with the agent provocateur
to make everything safe."</p>

<p>Mr Vladimir held up his hand to a passing hansom.</p>

<p>"You’re not going in here," remarked the Assistant Commissioner,
looking at a building of noble proportions and hospitable aspect,
with the light of a great hall falling through its glass doors
on a broad flight of steps.</p>

<p>But Mr Vladimir, sitting, stony-eyed, inside the hansom, drove
off without a word.</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner himself did not turn into the noble
building. It was the Explorers’ Club.  The thought passed through
his mind that Mr Vladimir, honorary member, would not be seen
very often there in the future.  He looked at his watch.  It was
only half-past ten.  He had had a very full evening.</p>
