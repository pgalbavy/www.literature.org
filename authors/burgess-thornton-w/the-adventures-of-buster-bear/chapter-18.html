<p>It isn't very often that Chatterer the Red Squirrel knows fear.
That is one reason that he is so often impudent and saucy. But
once in a while a great fear takes possession of him, as when
he knows that Shadow the Weasel is looking for him. You see, he
knows that Shadow can go wherever he can go. There are very few
of the little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows
who do not know fear at some time or other, but it comes to Chatterer
as seldom as to any one, because he is very sure of himself and
his ability to hide or run away from danger.</p>

<p>But now as he clung to a little branch near the top of a tall
pine-tree in the Green Forest and looked down at the big sharp
teeth of Buster Bear drawing nearer and nearer, and listened to
the deep, angry growls that made his hair stand on end, Chatterer
was too frightened to think. If only he had kept his tongue still
instead of saying hateful things to Buster Bear! If only he had
known that Buster could climb a tree! If only he had chosen a
tree near enough to other trees for him to jump across! But he
<em>had</em> said hateful things, he <em>had</em> chosen to sit
in a tree which stood quite by itself, and Buster Bear <em>could</em>
climb! Chatterer was in the worst kind of trouble, and there was
no one to blame but himself. That is usually the case with those
who get into trouble.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came Buster Bear, and deeper and angrier sounded
his voice. Chatterer gave a little frightened gasp and looked
this way and looked that way. What should he do? What <em>could</em>
he do! The ground seemed a terrible distance below. If only he
had wings like Sammy Jay! But he hadn't.</p>

<p>"Gr-r-r-r!" growled Buster Bear. "I'll teach you manners! I'll
teach you to treat your betters with respect! I'll swallow you
whole, that's what I'll do. Gr-r-r-r!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Chatterer.</p>

<p>"Gr-r-r-r! I'll eat you all up to the last hair on your tail!"
growled Buster, scrambling a little nearer.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" cried Chatterer, and ran out to the very tip of the
little branch to which he had been clinging. Now if Chatterer
had only known it, Buster Bear couldn't reach him way up there,
because the tree was too small at the top for such a big fellow
as Buster. But Chatterer didn't think of that. He gave one more
frightened look down at those big teeth, then he shut his eyes
and jumped&mdash;jumped straight out for the far-away ground.</p>

<p>It was a long, long, long way down to the ground, and it certainly
looked as if such a little fellow as Chatterer must be killed.
But Chatterer had learned from Old Mother Nature that she had
given him certain things to help him at just such times, and one
of them is the power to spread himself very flat. He did it now.
He spread his arms and legs out just as far as he could, and that
kept him from falling as fast and as hard as he otherwise would
have done, because being spread out so flat that way, the air
held him up a little. And then there was his tail, that funny
little tail he is so fond of jerking when he scolds. This helped
him too. It helped him keep his balance and keep from turning
over and over.</p>

<p>Down, down, down he sailed and landed on his feet. Of course,
he hit the ground pretty hard, and for just a second he quite
lost his breath. But it was only for a second, and then he was
scurrying off as fast as a frightened Squirrel could. Buster Bear
watched him and grinned.</p>

<p>"I didn't catch him that time," he growled, "but I guess I gave
him a good fright and taught him a lesson."</p>
