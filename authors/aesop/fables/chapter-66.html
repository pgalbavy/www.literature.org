TWO GAME COCKS were fiercely fighting for the mastery of the
farmyard.  One at last put the other to flight.  The vanquished
Cock skulked away and hid himself in a quiet corner, while the
conqueror, flying up to a high wall, flapped his wings and crowed
exultingly with all his might.  An Eagle sailing through the air
pounced upon him and carried him off in his talons.  The
vanquished Cock immediately came out of his corner, and ruled
henceforth with undisputed mastery.  
 
Pride goes before destruction.
