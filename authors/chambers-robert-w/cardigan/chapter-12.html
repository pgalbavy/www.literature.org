<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>How I managed to reach the fort, I never knew. I do not remember
that the savages carried me; I have no recollection of walking.
When the gate lanthorn was set that night, a sentry noticed me
creeping in the weeds at the moat's edge. He shot at me and gave
the alarm. Fortunately, he missed me.</p>

<p>All that evening I lay in a hot sickness on a cot in the casemates.
They say I babbled and whimpered till the doctor had finished
cupping me, but after that I rambled little, and, towards sunrise,
was sleeping.</p>

<p>My own memories begin with an explosion, which shook my cot and
brought me stumbling blindly out of bed, to find Jack Mount firing
through a loophole and watching me, while he reloaded, with curious
satisfaction.</p>

<p>He guided me back to my cot, and summoned the regiment's surgeon;
between them they bathed me and fed me and got my shirt and leggings
on me.</p>

<p>At first I could scarcely make out to stand on my legs. From
crown to sole I ached and throbbed; my vision was strangely blurred,
so that I saw things falling in all directions.</p>

<p>I think the regiment's surgeon, who appeared to be very young,
was laying his plans to bleed me again, but I threatened him if
he laid a finger on me, and Mount protested that I was fit to
fight or feast with any man in Tryon County.</p>

<p>The surgeon, saying I should lie abed, mixed me a most filthy
draught, which I swallowed. Had I been able, I should have chased
him into the forest for that dose. As it was, I made towards him
on wavering legs, to do him a harm, whereupon he went out hastily,
calling me an ass. Mount linked his great arm in mine, and helped
me up to the parapet, where the Virginia militia were firing by
platoons into the forest.</p>

<p>The freshening morning was lovely and sweet; the west winds poured
into me like wine. I lay on the platform for a while, peering
up at the flag flapping above me on its pine staff, then raised
up on my knees and looked about.</p>

<p>Bands of shadow and sunlight lay across the quiet forests; the
calm hills sparkled. But the blackened clearing around the fort
was alive with crawling forms, moving towards the woods, darting
from cover to cover, yet always advancing. They were Cresap's
Maryland riflemen, reconnoitring the pines along the river, into
which the soldiers beside me on the parapet were showering bullets.</p>

<p>It was pretty to watch these Virginia militia fire by platoon
under instructions of a tall, young captain, who lectured them
as jealously as though they were training on the parade below.</p>

<p>"Too slow!" he said. "Try it again, lads, smartly! smartly! 'Tention!
Handle&mdash;cartridge! Too slow, again! As you were&mdash;ho! When I say
'cartridge!' bring your right hand short 'round to your pouch,
slapping it hard; seize the cartridge and bring it with a quick
motion to your mouth; bite off the top down to the powder, covering
it instantly with your thumb. Now! 'Tention! Handle&mdash;cartridge!
Prime! Shut&mdash;pan! Charge with cartridge&mdash;ho! Draw&mdash;rammer! Ram&mdash;cartridge!
Return&mdash;rammer! Shoulder&mdash;arms! Front rank&mdash;make ready! Take aim&mdash;fire!"</p>

<p>Bang! bang! went the rifles; the parapet swam in smoke. Bang!
The second rank fired as one man, and the crash was echoed by
the calm, clear voice: "Half-cock arms&mdash;ho! Handle&mdash;cartridge!
Prime!"</p>

<p>And so it went on; volley after volley swept the still pines
until a thundering report from the brass cannon ended the fusillade,
and we leaned out on the epaulement, watching the riflemen who
were now close to the lead-sprayed woods.</p>

<p>The banked cannon-smoke came driving back into our faces; all
was a choking blank for a moment. Presently, through the whirling
rifts, we caught glimpses of blue sky and tree-tops, and finally
of the earth. But what was that?&mdash;what men were those running
towards us?&mdash;what meant that distant crackle of rifles?&mdash;those
silvery puffs of smoke fringing the entire amphitheatre of green,
north, east, west&mdash;ay, and south, too, behind our very backs?</p>

<p>"Down with your drawbridge!" thundered the officer commanding
the gun-squad. I saw Cresap come running along the parapet, signalling
violently to the soldiers below at the sallyport. Clank! clank!
went the chain-pulleys, and the bridge fell with a rush and a
hollow report, raising a cloud of amber dust.</p>

<p>"My God!" shouted an officer. "See the savages!"</p>

<p>"See the riflemen," mimicked Mount, at my elbow. "I told Cresap
to wait till dark."</p>

<p>Along the parapets the soldiers were firing frenziedly; the quick
cannon-shots shook the fort, smothering us with smutty smoke.
I had a glimpse, below me, of Cresap leading out a company of
soldiers to cover the flight of his riflemen, and at intervals
I saw single Indians, kneeling to fire, then springing forward,
yelping and capering.</p>

<p>A tumult arose below. Back came the riflemen pell-mell, into
the fort, followed by the militia company at quick time. The chains
and pulleys clanked; the bridge rose, groaning on its hinges.</p>

<p>It was now almost impossible to perceive a single savage, not
only because of the rifle-smoke, but also because they had taken
cover like quail in a ploughed field. Every charred tree-root
sheltered an Indian; the young oats were alive with them; they
lay among the wheat, the bean-poles; they crouched behind manure-piles;
they crawled in the beds of ditches.</p>

<p>"Are all the settlers in the fort?" I asked Mount, who was leaning
over the epaulement, waiting patiently for a mark.</p>

<p>"Every man, woman, and child came in last night," he said. "If
any have gone out it's against orders, and their own faults. Ho!
Look yonder, lad! Oh, the devils! the devils!" And he fired, with
an oath on his lips.</p>

<p>A house and barn were suddenly buried in a cloud of pitchy vapour;
a yoke of oxen ran heavily across a field; puffs of smoke from
every rut and gully and bush showed where the Indians were firing
at the terrified beasts.</p>

<p>One ox went down, legs shot to pieces; the other stood bellowing
pitifully. Then the tragedy darkened; a white man crept out of
the burning barn and started running towards the fort.</p>

<p>"The fool!" said Mount. "He went back for his oxen! Oh, the fool!"</p>

<p>I could see him distinctly now; he was a short, fat man, bare-legged
and bare-headed. As he ran he looked back over his shoulder frequently.
Once, when he was climbing a fence, he fell, but got on his legs
again and ran on, limping.</p>

<p>"They've hit him," said Mount, reloading hastily; "look! He's
down! He's done for! God! They've got him!"</p>

<p>I turned my head aside; when I looked for the poor fellow again,
I could only see a white patch lying in the field, and an Indian
slinking away from it, shaking something at the fort, while the
soldiers shot at him and cursed bitterly at every shot.</p>

<p>"It's Nathan Giles's brother," said a soldier, driving his cartridge
down viciously. "Can't some o' you riflemen reach him with old
Brown Bess?"</p>

<p>The report of Mount's rifle answered; the Indian staggered, turned
to run, reeled off sideways, and fell across a manure-heap. After
a moment he rose again and crawled behind it.</p>

<p>And now, house after house burst into black smoke and spouts
of flame. Through the spreading haze we caught fleeting glimpses
of dark figures running, and our firelocks banged out briskly,
but could neither hinder nor stay the doom of those poor, rough
homes. Fire leaped like lightning along the pine walls, twisting
in an instant into a column of pitchy smoke tufted with tongues
of flame. Over the whirling cinders distracted pigeons circled;
fowls fluttered out of burning barns and ran headlong into the
woods. Somewhere a frightened cow bellowed.</p>

<p>Under cover of the haze and smoke, unseen, the Indians had advanced
near enough to send arrows into the parade below us, where the
women and children and the cattle were packed together. One arrow
struck a little girl in the head, killing her instantly; another
buried itself in the neck of a bull, and a terrible panic followed,
women and children fleeing to the casemates, while the maddened
bull dashed about, knocking down horses, goring sheep and oxen,
trampling through bundles of household goods until a rifleman
shot him through the eye and cut his throat.</p>

<p>Soldiers and farmers were now hastening to the parapets, carrying
buckets and jars of water, for Cresap feared the sparks from the
burning village might fall even here. But there was worse danger
than that: an arrow, tipped with blazing birch-bark, fell on the
parapet between me and Mount, and, ere I could pick it up, another
whizzed into the epaulement, setting fire to the logs. Faster
and faster fell the flaming arrows; a farmer and three soldiers
were wounded; a little boy was pierced in his mother's arms. No
sooner did we soak out the fire in one spot than down rushed another
arrow whistling with flames, and we all ran to extinguish the
sparks which the breeze instantly blew into a glow.</p>

<p>I had forgotten my bruises, my weakness, and fatigue; aches and
pains I no longer felt. The excitement cured me as no blood-letting
popinjay of a surgeon could, and I found myself nimbly speeding
after the fiery arrows and knocking out the sparks with an empty
bucket.</p>

<p>Save for the occasional rifle-shots and the timorous whinny of
horses, the fort was strangely quiet. If the women and children
were weeping in the casemates, we on the ramparts could not hear
them. And I do not think they uttered a complaint. We hurried
silently about our work; no officers shouted; there was small
need to urge us, and each man knew what to do when an arrow fell.</p>

<p>All at once the fiery shower ceased. A soldier climbed the flag-pole
to look out over the smoke, and presently he called down to us
that the savages were falling back to the forest. Then our cannon
began to flash and thunder, and the militia fell in for volley-firing
again, while, below, the drawbridge dropped once more, and our
riflemen stole out into the haze.</p>

<p>I was sitting on the parapet, looking at Boyd's inn, "The Leather
Bottle," which was on fire, when Mount and Cade Renard came up
to me, carrying a sheaf of charred arrows which they had gathered
on the parade.</p>

<p>"I just want you to look at these," began Mount, dumping the
arrows into my lap. "The Weasel, he says you know more about Indians
than we do, and I don't deny it, seeing you lived at Johnstown
and seem so fond of the cursed hell-hounds&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He wants you to read these arrows," interrupted the Weasel,
dryly; "no, not the totem signs. What tribes are they?"</p>

<p>"Cayuga," I replied, wondering. "Cayuga, of course&mdash;wait!&mdash;why,
this is a Seneca war-arrow!&mdash;you can see by the shaft and nock
and the quills set inside the fibres!"</p>

<p>"I told you!" observed the Weasel, grimly nudging Mount.</p>

<p>Mount stood silent and serious, watching me picking up arrow
after arrow from the charred sheaf on my knees.</p>

<p>"Here is a Shawanese hunting-shaft," I said, startled, "and&mdash;and
this&mdash;this is a strange arrow to me!"</p>

<p>I held up a slender, delicate arrow, beautifully made and tipped
with steel.</p>

<p>"That," said Mount, gravely, "is a Delaware arrow."</p>

<p>"The Lenape!" I cried, astonished. Suddenly the terrible significance
of these blackened arrows came to me like a blow. The Lenni-Lenape
had risen, the Senecas and Shawanese had joined the Cayugas. The
Long House was in revolt.</p>

<p>"Mount," I said, quietly, "does Colonel Cresap know this?"</p>

<p>The Weasel nodded.</p>

<p>"We abandon the fort to-night," he said. "We can't face the Six
Nations&mdash;here."</p>

<p>"We make for Pittsburg," added Mount. "It will be a job to get
the women and children through. Cresap wishes to see you, Mr.
Cardigan. You will find him laying fuses to the magazine."</p>

<p>They piloted me to the casemates and around the barracks to the
angle of the fort, where a stockade barred the passage to the
magazine. The sentry refused us admittance, but Corporal Cloud
heard us and opened the stockade gate, where we saw Cresap on
his hands and knees, heaping up loose powder into a long train.
He glanced up at us quietly; his thin, grave face was very pale.</p>

<p>"Am I right about those arrows?" he asked Mount.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cardigan says there's a Seneca war-arrow among 'em, too,"
replied Mount.</p>

<p>Cresap's keen eyes questioned me.</p>

<p>"It's true," I said. "The Senecas guard the western door of the
Long House, and they have made the Cayugas' cause their own."</p>

<p>"And the eastern door?" demanded Cresap, quickly.</p>

<p>"The eastern door of the Long House is held by our Mohawks and
Sir William Johnson," I said, proudly. "And, by God's grace! they
will hold it in peace."</p>

<p>"Not while Walter Butler lives," said Cresap, bitterly, rising
to his feet and turning the key of the magazine. "Throw that key
into the moat, corporal," he said. "Mount, get some riflemen and
roll these kegs of powder into the casemates."</p>

<p>"You know," he observed, turning to me, "that we abandon the
fort to-night. It means the end of all for me. I shall receive
all the blame for this war; the disgrace will be laid on me. But
let Dunmore beware if he thinks to deprive me of command over
my riflemen! I've made them what they are&mdash;not for my Lord Dunmore,
but for my country, when the call to arms peals out of every steeple
from Maine to Virginia."</p>

<p>Cloud lifted his hat. "Please God, those same bells will ring
before I die," he said, serenely.</p>

<p>"They'll ring when the British fleet sights Boston," observed
the Weasel.</p>

<p>"They'll ring loud enough for Harrod and Dan Boone to hear 'em
on the Kentucky," added Mount.</p>

<p>I said nothing, but looked down at the powder trail, which led
into the magazine through a hole under the heavy double door.
Cresap pushed the heap of powder with his foot.</p>

<p>"Ah, well," he said, "it's liberty or death for all save human
cattle&mdash;liberty or death, sure enough, as the Virginian puts it."</p>

<p>"Patrick Henry is in Pittsburg," began Mount; but Cresap went
on without heeding him: "Patrick Henry has given my riflemen their
watchword; and the day that sees them marching north will find
that watchword lettered on the breast of every hunting-shirt &mdash;Liberty
or Death."</p>

<p>Turning his clear eyes on me, he said, "You will be with us,
will you not, sir?"</p>

<p>"My father fought at Quebec," I answered, slowly.</p>

<p>"And my father yonder at Fort Pitt, when it was Fort Duquesne,
not under Braddock, but in '58, when the British razed the French
works and built Fortress Pitt on the ruins. What of it? Your father
and my father fought for England. They were Englishmen. Let us,
who are Americans, imitate our fathers by fighting for America.
We could do their memory no truer honour."</p>

<p>"I have not made up my mind to fight our King," I answered, slowly.
"But I have determined to fight his deputy, Lord Dunmore."</p>

<p>"And all his agents?" added Mount, promptly.</p>

<p>"You mean Dunmore's?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The King's," said Cloud.</p>

<p>"Yes, the King's, too, if they interfere with my people!" I blurted
out.</p>

<p>"Oh, I think you will march with us when the time comes," said
Cresap, with one of his rare smiles; and he led the way out of
the stockade, cautioning us to step clear of the powder.</p>

<p>"Cut a time-fuse for the train and bring it to me at the barracks,"
he said to Cloud; and, saluting us thoughtfully, he entered the
casemates, where the women and children were gathered in tearful
silence.</p>

<p>I heard him tell the poor creatures that their homes had gone
up in smoke; that, for the moment, it was necessary to retire
to Fort Pitt, and that each family might take only such household
implements and extra clothing as they could carry in their arms.</p>

<p>There was not a whimper from the women, only quiet tears. Even
the children, looking up solemnly at Cresap, bravely stifled the
sobs of fear that crowded into every little throat.</p>

<p>The day wore away in preparation for the march. I had nothing
to prepare; I had lost my rifle and ammunition when a prisoner
among the Cayugas, and my spare clothing and provisions when Boyd's
Inn was burned. Fortunately, Boyd had buckled on my money-belt
for safe keeping, and the honest old man delivered it to me, condoling
with me for the loss of my clothing and food; and never a word
of complaint for his own loss of home and bed and everything he
owned in the world, nor would he accept a shilling from me to
aid him towards a new beginning in life.</p>

<p>"I am only seventy-three," he said, coolly; "when these arms
of mine cannot build me a home, let them fashion my coffin!"</p>

<p>And he picked up his long rifle and walked away to help load
the ox-teams with powder, ball, and provisions.</p>

<p>One thing that Mount told me aroused my anger and contempt: there
was now not a Tory left among Cresap's people; all had fled when
Greathouse fled, proving clearly that, if all had not aided in
the slaughter of Logan's children, they at least had been informed
of the plot and had probably been warned that the murderous deed
would be laid at Tory doors.</p>

<p>Towards dusk our scouts began to come in, one by one, with sad
stories concerning the outlying settlements and lonely farms.
One had seen a charred doorway choked with dead children, all
scalped; another, lying hid, saw a small war-party pass with eighteen
fresh scalps, three of them taken from women and little girls;
a third vowed that the Oneidas had joined in, and he exhibited
a moccasin that he had found, as proof. But when I saw the moccasin,
I knew it to be Mohawk, and it troubled me greatly, yet I did
not inform Cresap, because I could not believe our Mohawks had
risen.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock the postern was opened quietly, and the first
detachment of riflemen left the fort, stealing out into the starlight,
weapons at a trail. When the scouts returned to say that the coast
was clear, the column started in perfect silence. First marched
a company of Maryland riflemen; after them filed the ox-teams,
loaded with old women and very small children, the wagons rolling
on muffled wheels; then followed a company of Virginia militia,
and after them came more ox-teams piled with ammunition and stores,
and accompanied by young women and grown children. The rear was
covered by the bulk of the militia and riflemen, with our brass
cannon dragged by the only horse in the ill-fated town.</p>

<p>When the rear-guard had disappeared in the darkness, Cresap,
Mount, Cade Renard, and I bolted the gates, drew up the drawbridge,
locked it, and dropped the keys into the moat. Then Cresap and
Mount ran across the parade towards the magazine, while we tied
a knotted rope to the southern parapet and shook it free so that
it hung to the edge of the counter-scarp below.</p>

<p>Presently Mount came hurrying back across the parade and up the
scarp to where we stood, bidding us hasten, for the fuse was afire
and might burn more quickly than we expected.</p>

<p>Down the rope, hand over hand, tumbled the Weasel, and then Mount
motioned me to go. But just as I started, up above my head in
the darkness I heard the flag flapping; I paused, then stepped
towards the pole.</p>

<p>"The flag," I said. "You have forgotten it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's only the damned British flag!" said Mount. "Down the rope
with you, lad! Do you want to keep us till the fort blows up?"</p>

<p>"I can't leave the flag," I said, doggedly.</p>

<p>"To hell with it!" retorted Mount, fiercely, and pushed me towards
the rope.</p>

<p>"Let me alone!" I flashed out, backing towards the flag-pole.</p>

<p>"Oh, go to the devil your own way," growled Mount, but I saw
he did not leave the rampart while I was lowering the flag and
ripping it from the halyards.</p>

<p>Cresap came rushing up the scarp as I stuffed the flag into the
breast of my hunting-shirt.</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" he cried. "Down the rope there, Cardigan! Follow
him for your life, Jack Mount!"</p>

<p>And down I scrambled, followed by Mount and Cresap, and we all
ran as though the Six Nations were at our heels.</p>

<p>In the dark we passed a rifleman who scampered on ahead to pilot
us, and after ten minutes at top speed we joined the rear-guard
and fell in with the major, panting.</p>

<p>"A slick trick you played," grunted Mount, "with that bloody
British flag."</p>

<p>"It was mine, once," I retorted, hotly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you would blow us all up for it, eh?" asked the big fellow,
pettishly. "Well, you be damned, and your flag, too!"</p>

<p>His voice was blotted out in a roar which shook the solid forest;
a crimson flame shot up to the stars; then thunderous darkness
buried us.</p>

<p>Half-smothered cries and shrieks came from the long convoy ahead,
but these were quickly silenced, the frightened oxen subdued,
and the column hastened on into the night.</p>

<p>"Now that the fort's exploded, look out for the Iroquois," said
Mount, steadying his voice with an effort.</p>

<p>Cresap had given me a rifle. I halted to load it, then ran on
to join Mount and Renard. We plodded on in silence for a while.
Presently Mount asked me what I meant to do in Pittsburg.</p>

<p>"I mean to see Lord Dunmore," I replied, quietly.</p>

<p>Mount pretended to fear for his Lordship's scalp, but I was in
no humour for jesting, and I said no more.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do to old Dunmore?" urged the big fellow,
curiously.</p>

<p>"See here, my good man," said I, "you are impertinent. I am an
accredited deputy of Sir William Johnson, and my business is his."</p>

<p>"You need not be so surly," grumbled Mount.</p>

<p>"You've hurt his feelings," observed the Weasel, trotting at
my heels.</p>

<p>"Whose? Mount's?" I asked. "Well, I am sorry. I did not mean
to hurt you, Mount."</p>

<p>"That's all very well, but you did," said Mount. "I've got feelings,
too, just as much as the Weasel has."</p>

<p>"No, you haven't," said the Weasel, hastily. "I'm a ruined man,
and you know it. Haven't I been through enough to give me sensitive
feelings?"</p>

<p>Mount nudged me. "He's thinking of his wife and baby," he said.
"Talk to him about them. He likes it. It harrows him, doesn't
it, Cade?"</p>

<p>"It hurts fearful," replied the Weasel, looking up at me hopefully.</p>

<p>"You had a lovely wife, didn't you, Cade?" inquired Mount, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;oh yes. And a baby girl, Jack&mdash;don't forget the baby girl,"
sniffed the Weasel, trotting beside me.</p>

<p>"The baby must be nigh fifteen years old now, eh, Cade?" suggested
Mount.</p>

<p>"Sixteen, nigh sixteen, Jack. The cunning little thing."</p>

<p>"What became of her?" I asked, gently.</p>

<p>"Nobody knows, nobody knows," murmured the Weasel. "My wife left
me and took my baby girl. Some say she went with one of Sir Peter
Warren's captains, some say it was an admiral who charmed her.
I don't know. She was gone and the fleet was gone when they told
me."</p>

<p>He laid his hard little hand on my arm and looked up with bright
eyes.</p>

<p>"Since that," he said, "I've been a little queer in my head.
You may have noticed it. Oh yes, I've been a little mad, haven't
I, Jack?"</p>

<p>"A little," said Mount, tenderly.</p>

<p>"I have not noticed it," said I.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I have," he insisted. "I talk with my baby in the woods;
don't I, Jack? And I see her, too," he added, triumphantly. "That
proves me a little mad; doesn't it, Jack?"</p>

<p>"The Weasel was once a gentleman," said Mount, in my ear. "He
had a fine mansion near Boston."</p>

<p>"I hear you!" piped the Weasel. "I hear you, Jack. You are quite
right, too. I was a gentleman. I have ridden to hounds, Mr. Cardigan,
many a covert I've drawn, many a brush fell to me. I was master
of fox-hounds, Mr. Cardigan. None rode harder than I. I kept a
good cellar, too, and an open house&mdash;ah, yes, an open house, sir.
And that was where ruin came in, finding the door open&mdash;and the
fleet in the downs."</p>

<p>"And you came home and your dear wife had run away with an officer
from Sir Peter Warren's ships&mdash;eh, Cade, old friend?" said Mount,
affectionately.</p>

<p>"And took our baby&mdash;don't forget the baby, Jack," piped the Weasel.</p>

<p>"And if you could only find the man you'd slit his gullet, wouldn't
you, Cade?" inquired Mount, dropping one great arm over the Weasel's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, yes," replied the Weasel, amiably.</p>

<p>I had been looking ahead along the line of wagons, where a lanthorn
was glimmering. The convoy had halted, and presently Mount, Cade
Renard, and I walked on along the ranks of resting troops and
loaded wains until we came to where the light shone on a group
of militia officers and riflemen. Cresap was there, wrapped in
his heavy cloak; and when he perceived me he called me.</p>

<p>As I approached, followed naïvely by Mount and Renard, I was
surprised to see a tall Indian standing beside Cresap, muffled
to the chin in a dark blanket.</p>

<p>"Cardigan," said Cresap, "my scouts found this Indian walking
ahead in the trail all alone. He made no resistance, and they
brought him in. He seems to be foolish or simple-minded. I can't
make him out. You see he is unarmed. What is he?"</p>

<p>I glanced at the tall, silent Indian; a glance was enough.</p>

<p>"This man is a Cayuga and a chief," I said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Speak to him," said Cresap; "he appears not to understand me.
I speak only Tuscarora, and that badly."</p>

<p>I looked at the silent Cayuga and made the sign of brotherhood.
His dull eyes regarded me steadily.</p>

<p>"Brother," I said, "by the cinders on your brow you mourn for
the dead."</p>

<p>"I mourn," he replied, simply.</p>

<p>"A son?"</p>

<p>"A family. I am Logan."</p>

<p>Shocked, I gazed in pity on the stern, noble visage. So this
was Logan, the wretched man bereft of all his loved ones by Greathouse!</p>

<p>I turned quietly to Cresap.</p>

<p>"This is the great Cayuga chief, Logan, whose children were murdered,"
I said.</p>

<p>Cresap turned a troubled face on the mute savage.</p>

<p>"Ask him where he journeys."</p>

<p>"Where do you journey, brother?" I asked, gently.</p>

<p>"I go to Fort Pitt," he answered, without emotion.</p>

<p>"To ask justice?"</p>

<p>"To ask it."</p>

<p>"God grant you justice," I said, gravely.</p>

<p>To Cresap I said, "He seeks justice at Fort Pitt from Lord Dunmore."</p>

<p>"Bid him come with us," replied Cresap, soberly. "He may not
get justice at Fort Pitt, but there is a higher Judge than the
Earl of Dunmore. To Him I also look for the justice that men shall
deny me on earth."</p>

<p>I took Logan by the hand and led him into a space behind the
wagons. Here we waited in silence until the slow convoy moved,
and then we followed as mourners follow a casket to the grave
of all their hopes.</p>

<p>Hour after hour we journeyed unmolested; the stars faded, but
it was not yet dawn when a far voice cried in the darkness and
a light moved, and we knew that the warders of the fortress were
hailing our vanguard at the gates of Pittsburg.</p>
