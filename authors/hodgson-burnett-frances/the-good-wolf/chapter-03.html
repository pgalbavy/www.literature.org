<p>BARTY'S eyes grew round and big with excitement. A wonderful
procession was entering the hall. First came a band of tiny jet
black monkeys playing on golden trumpet's--the Drum Major walking
backward before them and twirling his staff; then came two black
and two white rabbits, and they were carrying a throne on which sat
two old, old, old, white rabbits. They were so old that their hair
had grown long enough to hang down below their feet, and their eyes
were large and strange and had an ancient, solemn look in them, as
if they had been gazing at the rabbit world for thousands of years.
Barty thought their large, strange eyes looked nice, and he said so
to the Good Wolf.
</p>
<p>"They look kind," he whispered.
</p><p>"They were the two rabbits who went into the Ark with Noah," the
Good Wolf whispered back. "And they have lived so long and grown so
wise that they have found out that the best thing in the world is
to be kind. They never find fault with any one. They know too
much."
</p><p>"But I thought they died long ago," said Barty.
</p><p>"Everybody thought so," answered his friend. "But they didn't. They
are the great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather and
grandmother of all the rabbits in the world."
</p><p>"How int'resting," said Barty, jumping up and down a little. "How
'normously interesting!"
</p><p>The procession behind them was made up of their courtiers, and they
were all either black or white rabbits--a black one and a white
one--a black one and a white one. They all wore gold collars and
gold stars on their breasts. These were the Order of the Ancient
Rabbit.
</p><p>The black monkey musicians took their places on a little band
stand, and as soon as the bearers of the throne set it down at the
end of the hall, a grand blast of golden trumpets was heard, and
every one of the animals made a profound bow.
</p><p>Then the gentleman Noah's Ark Rabbit waved his long-haired front
foot gracefully.
</p><p>"Greeting, brothers and sisters," he said. "Welcome to the Snow
Feast. What is first to be done?"
</p><p>The Good Wolf whispered to a very grand Court Rabbit who was
standing near. He carried a wand and was black all over, except for
a white place on his breast, which made him look as if he were in
evening dress, and gave him a very fashionable air. The Court
Rabbit waved his wand.
</p><p>"Your Majesty, I have a new guest to present to you," he said, and
he made a sign to Barty.
</p><p>"Walk forward and make a bow," the Good Wolf said. "You are going
to be introduced."
</p><p>Barty did as he was told, and made a very nice bow indeed. His
Majesty, the Noah's Ark Rabbit, pointed to him with a benevolent,
puzzled look.
</p><p>"What kind of little animal is that?" he inquired. "I seem to
remember seeing some like him when I was in the Ark, but I cannot
remember what they were called."
</p><p>The Good Wolf answered him.
</p><p>"He is a boy, your Majesty," he said. "There are a good many of
them on the top." (He meant on the top of the earth, outside rabbit
burrows.)
</p><p>"Turn round, Boy," said the Noah's Ark Rabbit, "and let me look at
you." And when Barty very politely turned round and round, his
Majesty scratched himself behind his long ear and repeated,
"Boy-Boy-Boy?" as if he were trying to remember something, and at last
he turned to his wife and said, "My dear, do you remember anything
about a Boy?"
</p><p>The Queen Noah's Ark Rabbit had an ivory cane which she leaned on
when she walked, and she lifted it and began to poke Barty gently
all over, as if she were trying to find out what he was made of.
She was a kind looking old thing, and suddenly she began to smile.
</p><p>"Of course I remember," she said, "and so will you if you think a
moment. Who saved us from the Flood by taking us into the Ark? He
would take us. And he cried like anything when his grandfather
chose another pair. Who was it?"
</p><p>His Majesty slapped his knee and rocked with laughter.
</p><p>"It was a Boy!" he said. "It was a Boy as sure as I am a Noah's Ark
Rabbit.
</p><p>"It was a little Boy of Shem's, and he had made pets of us," said
her Majesty. "He kept us in a hutch, and when the animals were
picked out in pairs he huddled us in his arms and ran to his
grandfather, and said, "Grandfather, you must take these--you must.
If they are left behind I shall stay with them and let the Flood
drown me! And though his grandfather had picked out a much bigger
pair, he was obliged to take us or let the Boy be drowned."
</p><p>His Majesty slapped his knee again. "And that is why we are here
to-day!" he exclaimed. "How did we forget about Boys!"
</p><p>"It was because the Flood frightened us so much, that as soon as we
were let out of the Ark we ran away as fast as we could, and
burrowed deep into the earth, and we never have been on top since,
so we never have seen any until this minute. Dear! Dear! Dear!"
said her Majesty. "Deary, deary me!"
</p><p>Barty quite blushed with pleasure. They were such nice, old,
long-haired, aged, aged benevolent things.
</p><p>"I am very glad that I am a boy," he said, "if it was a boy who
saved you."
</p><p>"He is the nicest little animal I ever saw," said his Majesty
enthusiastically. "I am perfectly delighted to see him. He must be
led to the feasting table and given everything he likes to eat. He
must enjoy himself. He must stuff his pockets full of good things
to carry home. What can I give you for a Christmas present, Boy? Is
there anything in all the wide world I can do for you? Goodness
gracious, mercy me! You are the preserver of all our race. You are
a Boy!"
</p><p>He was so delighted that he spoke as fast as lightning, and his
words tumbled one over the other; seeing which, the Good Wolf spoke
again.
</p><p>"Your Majesty, he is not only a boy," he said, "but he is a
blessing and a privilege, which all boys are not."
</p><p>"Then he ought to have a Christmas present. He ought to have a
hundred thousand million Christmas presents," said the Noah's Ark
Rabbit, looking round, and growing so excited that all his long,
white fur fluffed up and stood out all over him. "Are there any
about here--are there any about? Goodness gracious, mercy me! There
ought to be Christmas presents on every side."
</p><p>Her dear old Majesty, his wife, began to look about her too, waving
her fore-paws in her inexpressible agitation. (Inexpressible
agitation means that she was so excited that she did not know what
to say.) "I don't see any! I don't see any! I don't see any!" she
exclaimed. "Oh my! Oh my! Oh my! Oh my!"
</p><p>"Never since I came out of the Ark," said his Majesty, "have I
known such a dreadful situation. A Boy--a Boy like this, and no
presents! The place ought to be strewn with them--it ought to be
piled up with them--it ought to be stuffed--and crammed and bulging
with them!"
</p><p>(I wish you knew how Tim used to chuckle when this part was told.)
</p><p>Then the Good Wolf spoke aloud with a most agreeable smile, and
unless you have seen a Good Wolf you can never know how agreeable
his smile can be.
</p><p>"I know what he would like, your Majesty," he said.
</p><p>"Do you! Do you?" said the Noah's Ark Rabbit, his fur fluffing up
and standing out still more because he was so interested. "Then
speak up--speak up--speak up! Don't hang back, for goodness mercy's
sake!"
</p><p>"What he would like most of all would be that your Majesty should
allow some of your subjects to be his friends and play with him,"
answered the Good Wolf.
</p><p>"Would he--would he really?" said the Noah's Ark Rabbit. "Why, that
seems a trifle."
</p><p>"Oh!" cried Barty, "if they only might, if they only would. I
should never want any toys again as long as I lived!" and he
clasped his hands.
</p><p>"Well, I can do that for you in the shake of a rabbit's tail," said
his Majesty. "How many would you like?"
</p><p>"Enough," answered Barty, rather timidly, because he was so afraid
he might be asking too much, "enough to play circus, so that I
could be the ring-master. I've so often wanted to be a ring-master,
and once I dreamed I was one."
</p><p>The Noah's Ark Rabbit put his hand into a pocket under his long
white fur, and he drew out a tiny whip.
</p><p>"Take that and crack it as loud as ever you can, and see what will
happen," he commanded.
</p><p>Barty took it and swung it as he had seen ring-masters do, and he
made it crack beautifully. What happened was that all the little
animals, every one of them, turned their heads to look at him.
</p><p>"Crack it again," said the Noah's Ark Rabbit.
</p><p>When Barty cracked it again the little animals began to crowd into
a circle all round him.
</p><p>"Now, my dear," said the Queen Noah's Ark Rabbit, "you just walk
out and choose the ones you would like best, and ask them if they
will come and play with you when they hear your whip crack."
</p><p>"I think I must be in a dream now," said Barty, as he began to go
round the circle.
</p><p>"Will you be my friend and come and play with me?" he said to the
little lion, and the little lion frisked and said: "Yes! Yes! Yes!"
</p><p>And then he went to some little horses and to some more little
lions, and to four elephants and a rhinoceros and a hippopotamus,
and a little tiger and two tiny polar bears, and they all cried
out: "Yes! Yes!" until at last he had enough animals to make a most
splendid circus. There was so much shouting of "Yes! Yes! Yes!"
that he began to rub his eyes.
</p><p>"Are you sure I am not dreaming?" he asked the Good Wolf.
</p><p>"Take him to the feasting tables," said the Noah's Ark Rabbit, "and
fill him to the brim. He will know then that he is not dreaming."
</p><p>Barty's eyes sparkled, because by this time he was very hungry, and
when the Good Wolf led him into another illuminated hall where all
the nice things to eat that are in the world seemed spread before
him on tables, you can imagine what he did. He ate just as much as
a little boy could eat after getting up early on a frosty morning
and forgetting all about his breakfast. But at last a sweet smile
spread over his rosy face, and he drew a long, long breath and
said:
</p><p>"My belt is very tight by now. Thank you ever so much, Good Wolf. I
never saw anything as beautiful as the Snow Feast is, and I should
like to stay until it is quite over; but if I do not go home my
mother will be frightened. Do you think there is time for me to
play a little with my circus before I go?"
</p><p>"Yes, there is," the Good Wolf answered. "I'll look after the time.
Come along. I see four little elephants and three lions looking
over here this minute, as if they wanted to talk to you."
</p><p>All the games Barty played and all the things he did that day, it
would take chapters and chapters to tell about. When the Good Wolf
told him it was time to go, he was being ring-master, and he was
laughing and shouting with glee. And all the little animals were
crowding round watching the elephants stand on their heads, and the
horses read things written on black boards. The Noah's Ark Rabbits
themselves were perfectly delighted, and said they had never
enjoyed a Snow Feast as much before.
</p><p>"You must come next year," they said, "and the next, and the next,
and the next, and the next--" They were even going on murmuring
"the next and the next," when Barty went away.
</p><p>"Now," said the Good Wolf, "trot along--trot along--trot along."
</p><p>And they did trot along, down corridors and round corners, and
through galleries, and in and out, and faster and faster, until at
last they came to the hole they had crept in through; and they
crept out through it, and found themselves once more standing in
the sparkling snow with the circle of tall trees round them.
</p><p>Barty clapped his hands.
</p><p>"I never had such a splendid time in my life," he said. "I never
had such beautiful things to eat. I never even dreamed of anything
as nice as the Snow Feast."
</p><p>"Neither did I," answered the Good Wolf. "I have nothing like it
even in the pink ear or the blue one. Now we must shake ourselves."
</p><p>So they shook themselves--once they shook themselves--twice they
shook themselves--three times and there they stood just the right
size again. And the Good Wolf slipped into his harness, and Barty
jumped on the red sled, and the bells jingled and jingled; and off
they went, gliding over the sparkling snow, home through the deep
forest where things built nests, and things burrowed under the
earth, and made long passages and little warm caves to hide in; and
where there were wonderful Snow Feasts, which only one little boy
in all the world had seen or heard of, and his name was Barty.
