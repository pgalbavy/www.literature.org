<p>The blackamoors had left the platform at the end of the hall.
The curtains looped up at either side had slid down, cutting it
off from the rest of the room—"making two worlds," Gumbril elegantly
and allusively put it, "where only one grew before—and one of
them a better world," he added too philosophically, "because unreal."
There was the theatrical silence, the suspense. The curtains parted
again.</p>

<p>  On a narrow bed—on a bier perhaps—the corpse of a woman. The
husband   kneels beside it. At the foot stands the doctor, putting
away his   instruments. In a beribboned pink cradle reposes a
monstrous baby.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>Margaret! Margaret!</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>She is dead.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>Margaret!</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>Of septicæmia, I tell you.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: I </em>wish that I too were dead!</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>But you won’t to-morrow.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>To-morrow! But I don’t want to live to
see to-morrow.</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>You will to-morrow.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>Margaret! Margaret! Wait for me there;
I shall not fail   to meet you in that hollow vale.</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>You will not be slow to survive her.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>Christ have mercy upon us!</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>You would do better to think of the child.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND (</em><em>rising and standing menacingly over
the cradle</em>): Is   that the monster?</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>No worse than others.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>Begotten in a night of immaculate pleasure,
monster,   may you live loveless, in dirt and impurity!</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>Conceived in lust and darkness, may your
own impurity   always seem heavenly, monster, in your own eyes!</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>Murderer, slowly die all your life long!</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>The child must be fed.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>Fed? With what?</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>With milk.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>Her milk is cold in her breasts.</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>There are still cows.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>Tubercular shorthorns. (<em>Calling.</em>)
Let   Short-i’-the-horn be brought!</p>

<p>  <em>VOICES (</em><em>off</em>): Short-i’-the-horn! Short-i’-the-horn!
(<em>Fadingly</em>)   Short-i’-the....</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>In nineteen hundred and twenty-one, twenty-seven  
thousand nine hundred and thirteen women died in childbirth.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>But none of them belonged to my harem.</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>Each of them was somebody’s wife.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>Doubtless. But the people we don’t know
are only   characters in the human comedy. We are the tragedians.</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>Not in the spectator’s eyes.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>Do I think of the spectators? Ah, Margaret!  
Margaret!...</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>The twenty-seven thousand nine hundred
and fourteenth.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>The only one!</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>But here comes the cow.</p>

<p>  (<em>Short-i’-the-horn is led in by a Yokel.</em>)</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>Ah, good Short-i’-the-horn! (<em>He pats
the animal.</em>) She   was tested last week, was she not?</p>

<p>  <em>THE YOKEL: </em>Ay, sir.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>And found tubercular. No?</p>

<p>  <em>THE YOKEL: </em>Even in the udders, may it please you.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>Excellent! Milk me the cow, sir, into
this dirty   wash-pot.</p>

<p>  <em>THE YOKEL: I </em>will, sir. (<em>He milks the cow.</em>)</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>Her milk—her milk is cold already. All
the woman in her   chilled and curdled within her breasts. Ah,
Jesus! what miraculous   galactagogue will make it flow again?</p>

<p>  <em>THE YOKEL: </em>The wash-pot is full, sir.</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND: </em>Then take the cow away.</p>

<p>  <em>THE YOKEL: </em>Come, Short-i’-the-horn; come up, good
Short-i’-the-horn.   (<em>He goes out with the cow.</em>)</p>

<p>  <em>THE HUSBAND (</em><em>pouring the milk into a long-tubed
feeding-bottle</em>):   Here’s for you, monster, to drink your
own health in. (<em>He gives the   bottle to the child.</em>)</p>

<p>  <em>CURTAIN</em>.</p>

<p>"A little ponderous, perhaps," said Gumbril, as the curtain came
down.</p>

<p>"But I liked the cow." Mrs. Viveash opened her cigarette-case
and found it empty. Gumbril offered her one of his. She shook
her head. "I don’t want it in the least," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, the cow was in the best pantomime tradition," Gumbril agreed.
Ah! but it was a long time since he had been to a Christmas pantomime.
Not since Dan Leno’s days. All the little cousins, the uncles
and aunts on both sides of the family, dozens and dozens of them—every
year they filled the best part of a row in the dress circle at
Drury Lane. And buns were stickily passed from hand to hand, chocolates
circulated; the grown-ups drank tea. And the pantomime went on
and on, glory after glory, under the shining arch of the stage.
Hours and hours; and the grown-ups always wanted to go away before
the harlequinade. And the children felt sick from eating too much
chocolate, or wanted with such extreme urgency to go to the w.c.
that they had to be led out, trampling and stumbling over everybody
else’s feet—and every stumble making the need more agonizingly
great—in the middle of the transformation scene. And there was
Dan Leno, inimitable Dan Leno, dead now as poor Yorick, no more
than a mere skull like anybody else’s skull. And his mother, he
remembered, used to laugh at him sometimes till the tears ran
down her cheeks. She used to enjoy things thoroughly, with a whole
heart.</p>

<p>"I wish they’d hurry up with the second scene," said Mrs. Viveash.
"If there’s anything that bores me, it’s <em>entr’actes</em>."</p>

<p>"Most of one’s life is an <em>entr’acte</em>," said Gumbril,
whose present mood of hilarious depression seemed favourable to
the enunciation of apophthegms.</p>

<p>"None of your cracker mottoes, please," protested Mrs. Viveash.
All the same, she reflected, what was she doing now but waiting
for the curtain to go up again, waiting, with what unspeakable
weariness of spirit, for the curtain that had rung down, ten centuries
ago, on those blue eyes, that bright strawy hair and the weathered
face?</p>

<p>"Thank God," she said with an expiring earnestness, "here’s the
second scene!"</p>

<p>  The curtain went up. In a bald room stood the Monster, grown
now   from an infant into a frail and bent young man with bandy
legs. At   the back of the stage a large window giving on to a
street along   which people pass.</p>

<p>  <em>THE MONSTER (</em><em>solus</em>): The young girls of Sparta,
they say, used to   wrestle naked with naked Spartan boys. The
sun caressed their skins   till they were brown and transparent
like amber or a flask of olive   oil. Their breasts were hard,
their bellies flat. They were pure   with the chastity of beautiful
animals. Their thoughts were clear,   their minds cool and untroubled.
I spit blood into my handkerchief   and sometimes I feel in my
mouth something slimy, soft and   disgusting, like a slug—and
I have coughed up a shred of my lung.   The rickets from which
I suffered in childhood have bent my bones   and made them old
and brittle. All my life I have lived in this huge   town, whose
domes and spires are wrapped in a cloud of stink that   hides
the sun. The slug-dank tatters of lung that I spit out are   black
with the soot I have been breathing all these years. I am now  
come of age. Long-expected one-and-twenty has made me a fully  
privileged citizen of this great realm of which the owners of
the   <em>Daily Mirror</em>, the <em>News of the World</em> and
the <em>Daily Express</em> are   noble peers. Somewhere, I must
logically infer, there must be other   cities, built by men for
men to live in. Somewhere, in the past, in   the future, a very
long way off.... But perhaps the only street   improvement schemes
that ever really improve the streets are schemes   in the minds
of those who live in them: schemes of love mostly. Ah!   here
she comes.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
(<em>The</em> <em>YOUNG LADY </em><em>enters. She stands outside the window, in the<br/>
street, paying no attention to the</em> <em>MONSTER; </em><em>she seems to be<br/>
waiting for somebody.</em>)

</p>
</div>
<p>  She is like a pear tree in flower. When she smiles, it is as
though   there were stars. Her hair is like the harvest in an
eclogue, her   cheeks are all the fruits of summer. Her arms and
thighs are as   beautiful as the soul of St. Catherine of Siena.
And her eyes, her   eyes are plumbless with thought and limpidly
pure like the water of   the mountains.</p>

<p>  <em>THE YOUNG LADY: </em>If I wait till the summer sale, the
crêpe de Chine   will be reduced by at least two shillings a yard,
and on six   camisoles that will mean a lot of money. But the
question is: can I   go from May till the end of July with the
underclothing I have now?</p>

<p>  <em>THE MONSTER: </em>If I knew her, I should know the universe!</p>

<p>  <em>THE YOUNG LADY: </em>My present ones are so dreadfully
middle-class. And   if Roger should ... by any chance....</p>

<p>  <em>THE MONSTER: </em>Or, rather, I should be able to ignore
it, having a   private universe of my own.</p>

<p>  <em>THE YOUNG LADY: </em>If—if he did—well, it might be rather
humiliating   with these I have ... like a servant’s almost....</p>

<p>  <em>THE MONSTER: </em>Love makes you accept the world; it puts
an end to   criticism.</p>

<p>  <em>THE YOUNG LADY: </em>His hand already....</p>

<p>  <em>THE MONSTER: </em>Dare I, dare I tell her how beautiful
she is?</p>

<p>  <em>THE YOUNG LADY: </em>On the whole, I think I’d better get
it now, though   it will cost more.</p>

<p>  <em>THE MONSTER (</em><em>desperately advancing to the window
as though to   assault a battery</em>): Beautiful! beautiful!</p>

<p>  <em>THE YOUNG LADY (</em><em>looking at him</em>): Ha, ha,
ha!</p>

<p>  <em>THE MONSTER: </em>But I love you, flowering pear tree;
I love you, golden   harvest; I love you, fruitage of summer;
I love you, body and limbs,   with the shape of a saint’s thought.</p>

<p>  <em>THE YOUNG LADY (</em><em>redoubles her laughter</em>):
Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>  <em>THE MONSTER (</em><em>taking her hand</em>): You cannot
be cruel! (<em>He is seized   with a violent paroxysm of coughing
which doubles him up, which   shakes and torments him. The handkerchief
he holds to his mouth is   spotted with blood.</em>)</p>

<p>  <em>THE YOUNG LADY: </em>You disgust me! (<em>She draws away
her skirts so that   they shall not come in contact with him.</em>)</p>

<p>  <em>THE MONSTER: </em>But I swear to you, I love—I—— (<em>He
is once more   interrupted by his cough.</em>)</p>

<p>  <em>THE YOUNG LADY: </em>Please go away. (<em>In a different
voice</em>) Ah, Roger!   (<em>She advances to meet a snub-nosed
lubber with curly hair and a   face like a groom’s, who passes
along the street at this moment.</em>)</p>

<p>  <em>ROGER: I’</em>ve got the motor-bike waiting at the corner.</p>

<p>  <em>THE YOUNG LADY: </em>Let’s go, then.</p>

<p>  <em>ROGER (</em><em>pointing to the</em> <em>MONSTER): </em>What’s
that?</p>

<p>  <em>THE YOUNG LADY: </em>Oh, it’s nothing in particular.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
(<em>Both roar with laughter.</em> <em>ROGER </em><em>escorts her out, patting her<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;familiarly on the back as they walk along.</em>)

</p>
</div>
<p>  <em>THE MONSTER (</em><em>looking after her</em>): There is
a wound under my left   pap. She has deflowered all women. I cannot....</p>

<p>"Lord!" whispered Mrs. Viveash, "how this young man bores me!"</p>

<p>"I confess," replied Gumbril, "I have rather a taste for moralities.
There is a pleasant uplifting vagueness about these symbolical
generalized figures which pleases me."</p>

<p>"You were always charmingly simple-minded," said Mrs. Viveash.
"But who’s this? As long as the young man isn’t left alone on
the stage, I don’t mind."</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

Another female figure has appeared in the street beyond the window. It<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is the Prostitute. Her face, painted in two tones of red, white,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;green, blue and black, is the most tasteful of <em>nature-mortes</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>  <em>THE PROSTITUTE: </em>Hullo, duckie!</p>

<p>  <em>THE MONSTER: </em>Hullo!</p>

<p>  <em>THE PROSTITUTE: </em>Are you lonely?</p>

<p>  <em>THE MONSTER: </em>Yes.</p>

<p>  <em>THE PROSTITUTE: </em>Would you like me to come in to see
you?</p>

<p>  <em>THE MONSTER: </em>Very well.</p>

<p>  <em>THE PROSTITUTE: </em>Shall we say thirty bob?</p>

<p>  <em>THE MONSTER: </em>As you like.</p>

<p>  <em>THE PROSTITUTE: </em>Come along then.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

(<em>She climbs through the window and they go off together through<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the door on the left of the stage. The curtains descend for a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;moment, then rise again. The</em> <em>MONSTER </em><em>and the</em> <em>PROSTITUTE </em><em>are<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;seen issuing from the door at which they went out.</em>)

</p>
<p>
<em>THE MONSTER (</em><em>taking out a cheque-book and a fountain pen</em>):<br/>
Thirty shillings....

</p>
<p>
<em>THE PROSTITUTE: </em>Thank you. Not a cheque. I don’t want any cheques.<br/>
How do I know it isn’t a dud one that they’ll refuse payment for<br/>
at the bank? Ready money for me, thanks.

</p>
<p>
<em>THE MONSTER: </em>But I haven’t got any cash on me at the moment.

</p>
<p>
<em>THE PROSTITUTE: </em>Well, I won’t take a cheque. Once bitten, twice<br/>
shy, I can tell you.

</p>
<p>
<em>THE MONSTER: </em>But I tell you I haven’t got any cash.

</p>
<p>
<em>THE PROSTITUTE: </em>Well, all I can say is, here I stay till I get it.<br/>
And, what’s more, if I don’t get it quick, I’ll make a row.

</p>
<p>
<em>THE MONSTER: </em>But this is absurd. I offer you a perfectly good<br/>
cheque....

</p>
<p>
<em>THE PROSTITUTE: </em>And I won’t take it. So there!

</p>
<p>
<em>THE MONSTER: </em>Well then, take my watch. It’s worth more than thirty<br/>
bob. (<em>He pulls out his gold half-hunter.</em>)

</p>
<p>
<em>THE PROSTITUTE: </em>Thank you, and get myself arrested as soon as I<br/>
take it to the pop-shop! No, I want cash, I tell you.

</p>
<p>
<em>THE MONSTER: </em>But where the devil do you expect me to get it at<br/>
this time of night?

</p>
<p>
<em>THE PROSTITUTE: I </em>don’t know. But you’ve got to get it pretty<br/>
quick.

</p>
<p>
<em>THE MONSTER: </em>You’re unreasonable.

</p>
<p>
<em>THE PROSTITUTE: </em>Aren’t there any servants in this house?

</p>
<p>
<em>THE MONSTER: </em>Yes.

</p>
<p>
<em>THE PROSTITUTE: </em>Well, go and borrow it from one of them.

</p>
<p>
<em>THE MONSTER: </em>But really, that would be too low, too humiliating.

</p>
<p>
<em>THE PROSTITUTE: </em>All right, I’ll begin kicking up a noise. I’ll go<br/>
to the window and yell till all the neighbours are woken up and<br/>
the police come to see what’s up. You can borrow it from the<br/>
copper then.

</p>
<p>
<em>THE MONSTER: </em>You really won’t take my cheque? I swear to you it’s<br/>
perfectly all right. There’s plenty of money to meet it.

</p>
<p>
<em>THE PROSTITUTE: </em>Oh, shut up! No more dilly-dallying. Get me my<br/>
money at once, or I’ll start the row. One, two, three.... (<em>She<br/>
opens her mouth wide as if to yell.</em>)

</p>
<p>
<em>THE MONSTER: </em>All right. (<em>He goes out.</em>)

</p>
<p>
<em>THE PROSTITUTE: </em>Nice state of things we’re coming to, when young<br/>
rips try and swindle us poor girls out of our money! Mean,<br/>
stinking skunks! I’d like to slit the throats of some of them.

</p>
<p>
<em>THE MONSTER (</em><em>coming back again</em>): Here you are. (<em>He hands her<br/>
money.</em>)

</p>
<p>
<em>THE PROSTITUTE (</em><em>examining it</em>): Thank you, dearie. Any other time<br/>
you’re lonely....

</p>
<p>
<em>THE MONSTER: </em>No, no!

</p>
<p>
<em>THE PROSTITUTE: </em>Where did you get it finally?

</p>
<p>
<em>THE MONSTER: I </em>woke the cook.

</p>
<p>
<em>THE PROSTITUTE (</em><em>goes off into a peal of laughter</em>): Well, so<br/>
long, duckie. (<em>She goes out.</em>)

</p>
<p>
<em>THE MONSTER (</em><em>solus</em>): Somewhere there must be love like music.<br/>
Love harmonious and ordered: two spirits, two bodies moving<br/>
contrapuntally together. Somewhere, the stupid brutish act must be<br/>
made to make sense, must be enriched, must be made significant.<br/>
Lust, like Diabelli’s waltz, a stupid air, turned by a genius into<br/>
three-and-thirty fabulous variations. Somewhere....

</p>
</div>
<p>"Oh dear!" sighed Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"Charming!" Gumbril protested.</p>

<p>  ... love like sheets of silky flame; like landscapes brilliant
in   the sunlight against a background of purple thunder; like
the   solution of a cosmic problem; like faith....</p>

<p>"Crikey!" said Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>  ... Somewhere, somewhere. But in my veins creep the maggots
of the   pox....</p>

<p>"Really, really!" Mrs. Viveash shook her head. "Too medical!"</p>

<p>  ... crawling towards the brain, crawling into the mouth, burrowing  
into the bones. Insatiably.</p>

<p>  The Monster threw himself to the ground, and the curtain came
down.</p>

<p>"And about time too!" declared Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"Charming!" Gumbril stuck to his guns. "Charming! charming!"</p>

<p>There was a disturbance near the door. Mrs. Viveash looked round
to see what was happening. "And now on top of it all," she said,
"here comes Coleman, raving, with an unknown drunk."</p>

<p>"Have we missed it?" Coleman was shouting. "Have we missed all
the lovely bloody farce?"</p>

<p>"Lovely bloody!" his companion repeated with drunken raptures,
and he went into fits of uncontrollable laughter. He was a very
young boy with straight dark hair and a face of Hellenic beauty,
now distorted with tipsiness.</p>

<p>Coleman greeted his acquaintances in the hall, shouting a jovial
obscenity to each. "And Bumbril-Gumbril," he exclaimed, catching
sight of him at last in the front row. "And Hetaira-Myra!" He
pushed his way through the crowd, followed unsteadily by his young
disciple. "So you’re here," he said, standing over them and looking
down with an enigmatic malice in his bright blue eyes. "Where’s
the physiologue?"</p>

<p>"Am I the physiologue’s keeper?" asked Gumbril. "He’s with his
glands and his hormones, I suppose. Not to mention his wife."
He smiled to himself.</p>

<p>"Where the hormones, there moan I," said Coleman, skidding off
sideways along the slippery word. "I hear, by the way, that there’s
a lovely prostitute in this play."</p>

<p>"You’ve missed her," said Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"What a misfortune," said Coleman. "We’ve missed the delicious
trull," he said, turning to the young man.</p>

<p>The young man only laughed.</p>

<p>"Let me introduce, by the way," said Coleman. "This is Dante,"
he pointed to the dark-haired boy; "and I am Virgil. We’re making
a round tour—or, rather, a descending spiral tour of hell. But
we’re only at the first circle so far. These, Alighieri, are two
damned souls, though not, as you might suppose, Paolo and Francesca."</p>

<p>The boy continued to laugh, happily and uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p>"Another of these interminable <em>entr’actes</em>," complained
Mrs. Viveash. "I was just saying to Theodore here that if there’s
one thing I dislike more than another, it’s a long <em>entr’acte</em>."
Would hers ever come to an end?</p>

<p>"And if there’s one thing <em>I</em> dislike more than another,"
said the boy, breaking silence for the first time, with an air
of the greatest earnestness, "it’s ... it’s one thing more than
another."</p>

<p>"And you’re perfectly right in doing so," said Coleman. "Perfectly
right."</p>

<p>"I know," the boy replied modestly.</p>

<p>  When the curtain rose again it was on an aged Monster, with
a black   patch over the left side of his nose, no hair, no teeth,
and sitting   harmlessly behind the bars of an asylum.</p>

<p>  <em>THE MONSTER: </em>Asses, apes and dogs! Milton called them
that; he   should have known. Somewhere there must be men, however.
The   variations on Diabelli prove it. Brunelleschi’s dome is
more than   the magnification of Cléo de Mérode’s breast. Somewhere
there are   men with power, living reasonably. Like our mythical
Greeks and   Romans. Living cleanly. The images of the gods are
their portraits.   They walk under their own protection. (<em>The</em>
<em>MONSTER </em><em>climbs on to a   chair and stands in the
posture of a statue</em>.) Jupiter, father of   gods, a man, I
bless myself, I throw bolts at my own disobedience, I   answer
my own prayers, I pronounce oracles to satisfy the questions  
I myself propound. I abolish all tetters, poxes, blood-spitting,  
rotting of bones. With love I recreate the world from within.
Europa   puts an end to squalor, Leda does away with tyranny,
Danae tempers   stupidity. After establishing these reforms in
the social sewer, I   climb, I climb, up through the manhole,
out of the manhole, beyond   humanity. For the manhole, even the
manhole, is dark; though not so   dingy as the doghole it was
before I altered it. Up through the   manhole, towards the air.
Up, up! (<em>And the</em> <em>MONSTER, </em><em>suiting the  
action to his words, climbs up the runged back of his chair and  
stands, by a miraculous feat of acrobacy, on the topmost bar</em>.)
I   begin to see the stars through other eyes than my own. More
than dog   already, I become more than man. I begin to have inklings
of the   shape and sense of things. Upwards, upwards I strain,
I peer, I   reach aloft. (<em>The balanced</em> <em>MONSTER </em><em>reaches,
strains and peers</em>.)   And I seize, I seize! (<em>As he shouts
these words, the</em> <em>MONSTER   </em><em>falls heavily, head
foremost, to the floor. He lies there quite   still. After a little
time the door opens and the</em> <em>DOCTOR </em><em>of the  
first scene enters with a</em> <em>WARDER</em>.)</p>

<p>  <em>THE WARDER: I </em>heard a crash.</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR (</em><em>who has by this time become immensely
old and has a   beard like Father Thames</em>): It looks as though
you were right. (<em>He   examines the</em> <em>MONSTER</em>.)</p>

<p>  <em>THE WARDER: </em>He was for ever climbing on to his chair.</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>Well, he won’t any more. His neck’s broken.</p>

<p>  <em>THE WARDER: </em>You don’t say so?</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: I </em>do.</p>

<p>  <em>THE WARDER: </em>Well, I never!</p>

<p>  <em>THE DOCTOR: </em>Have it carried down to the dissecting-room.</p>

<p>  <em>THE WARDER: I’</em>ll send for the porters at once.</p>

<p>  (<em>Exeunt severally, and</em> <em>CURTAIN</em>.)</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Viveash, "I’m glad that’s over."</p>

<p>The music struck up again, saxophone and ’cello, with the thin
draught of the violin to cool their ecstasies and the thumping
piano to remind them of business. Gumbril and Mrs. Viveash slid
out into the dancing crowd, revolving as though by force of habit.</p>

<p>"These substitutes for the genuine copulative article," said
Coleman to his disciple, "are beneath the dignity of hell-hounds
like you and me."</p>

<p>Charmed, the young man laughed; he was attentive as though at
the feet of Socrates. Coleman had found him in a night club, where
he had gone in search of Zoe, found him very drunk in the company
of two formidable women fifteen or twenty years his senior, who
were looking after him, half maternally out of pure kindness of
heart, half professionally; for he seemed to be carrying a good
deal of money. He was incapable of looking after himself. Coleman
had pounced on him at once, claimed an old friendship which the
youth was too tipsy to be able to deny, and carried him off. There
was something, he always thought, peculiarly interesting about
the spectacle of children tobogganing down into the cesspools.</p>

<p>"I like this place," said the young man.</p>

<p>"Tastes differ!" Coleman shrugged his shoulders. "The German
professors have catalogued thousands of people whose whole pleasure
consists in eating dung."</p>

<p>The young man smiled and nodded, rather vaguely. "Is there anything
to drink here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Too respectable," Coleman answered, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"I think this is a bloody place," said the young man.</p>

<p>"Ah! but some people like blood. And some like boots. And some
like long gloves and corsets. And some like birch-rods. And some
like sliding down slopes and can’t look at Michelangelo’s ‘Night’
on the Medici Tombs without dying the little death, because the
statue seems to be sliding. And some...."</p>

<p>"But I want something to drink," insisted the young man.</p>

<p>Coleman stamped his feet, waved his arms. "<em>À boire! à boire!</em>"
he shouted, like the newborn Gargantua. Nobody paid any attention.</p>

<p>The music came to an end. Gumbril and Mrs. Viveash reappeared.</p>

<p>"Dante," said Coleman, "calls for drink. We must leave the building."</p>

<p>"Yes. Anything to get out of this," said Mrs. Viveash. "What’s
the time?"</p>

<p>Gumbril looked at his watch. "Half-past one."</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash sighed. "Can’t possibly go to bed," she said, "for
another hour at least."</p>

<p>They walked out into the street. The stars were large and brilliant
overhead. There was a little wind that almost seemed to come from
the country. Gumbril thought so, at any rate; he thought of the
country.</p>

<p>"The question is, where?" said Coleman. "You can come to my bordello,
if you like; but it’s a long way off and Zoe hates us all so much,
she’ll probably set on us with the meat-chopper. If she’s back
again, that is. Though she may be out all night. <em>Zoe mou,
sas agapo.</em> Shall we risk it?"</p>

<p>"To me it’s quite indifferent," said Mrs. Viveash faintly, as
though wholly preoccupied with expiring.</p>

<p>"Or there’s my place," Gumbril said abruptly, as though shaking
himself awake out of some dream.</p>

<p>"But you live still farther, don’t you?" said Coleman. "With
venerable parents, and so forth. One foot in the grave and all
that. Shall we mingle hornpipes with funerals?" He began to hum
Chopin’s ‘Funeral March’ at three times its proper speed, and
seizing the young stranger in his arms, two-stepped two or three
turns on the pavement, then released his hold and let him go reeling
against the area railings.</p>

<p>"No, I don’t mean the family mansion," said Gumbril. "I mean
my own rooms. They’re quite near. In Great Russell Street."</p>

<p>"I never knew you had any rooms, Theodore," said Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"Nobody did." Why should they know now? Because the wind seemed
almost a country wind? "There’s drink there," he said.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" cried the young man. They were all splendid people.</p>

<p>"There’s some gin," said Gumbril.</p>

<p>"Capital aphrodisiac!" Coleman commented.</p>

<p>"Some light white wine."</p>

<p>"Diuretic."</p>

<p>"And some whisky."</p>

<p>"The great emetic," said Coleman. "Come on." And he struck up
the March of the Fascisti. "<em>Giovinezza, giovinezza, primavera
di bellezza</em>...." The noise went fading down the dark, empty
streets.</p>

<p>The gin, the white wine, and even, for the sake of the young
stranger, who wanted to sample everything, the emetic whisky,
were produced.</p>

<p>"I like your rooms," said Mrs. Viveash, looking round her. "And
I resent your secrecy about them, Theodore."</p>

<p>"Drink, puppy!" Coleman refilled the boy’s glass.</p>

<p>"Here’s to secrecy," Gumbril proposed. Shut it tightly, keep
it dark, cover it up. Be silent, prevaricate, lie outright. He
laughed and drank. "Do you remember," he went on, "those instructive
advertisements of Eno’s Fruit Salt they used to have when we were
young? There was one little anecdote about a doctor who advised
the hypochondriacal patient who had come to consult him, to go
and see Grimaldi, the clown; and the patient answered, ‘I am Grimaldi.’
Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Viveash. "And why do you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don’t know. Or rather, I do know," Gumbril corrected himself,
and laughed again.</p>

<p>The young man suddenly began to boast. "I lost two hundred pounds
yesterday playing <em>chemin de fer</em>," he said, and looked
round for applause.</p>

<p>Coleman patted his curly head. "Delicious child!" he said. "You’re
positively Hogarthian."</p>

<p>Angrily, the boy pushed him away. "What are you doing?" he shouted;
then turned and addressed himself once more to the others. "I
couldn’t afford it, you know—not a bloody penny of it. Not my
money, either." He seemed to find it exquisitely humorous. "And
that two hundred wasn’t all," he added, almost expiring with mirth.</p>

<p>"Tell Coleman how you borrowed his beard, Theodore."</p>

<p>Gumbril was looking intently into his glass, as though he hoped
to see in its pale mixture of gin and Sauterne visions, as in
a crystal, of the future. Mrs. Viveash touched him on the arm
and repeated her injunction.</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" said Gumbril rather irritably. "No. It isn’t an interesting
story."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, it is! I insist," said Mrs. Viveash, commanding peremptorily
from her death-bed.</p>

<p>Gumbril drank his gin and Sauterne. "Very well then," he said
reluctantly, and began.</p>

<p>"I don’t know what my governor will say," the young man put in
once or twice. But nobody paid any attention to him. He relapsed
into a sulky and, it seemed to him, very dignified silence. Under
the warm, jolly tipsiness he felt a chill of foreboding. He poured
out some more whisky.</p>

<p>Gumbril warmed to his anecdote. Expiringly Mrs. Viveash laughed
from time to time, or smiled her agonizing smile. Coleman whooped
like a Redskin.</p>

<p>"And after the concert to these rooms," said Gumbril.</p>

<p>Well, let everything go. Into the mud. Leave it there, and let
the dogs lift their hind legs over it as they pass.</p>

<p>"Ah! the genuine platonic fumblers," commented Coleman.</p>

<p>"I am Grimaldi," Gumbril laughed. Further than this it was difficult
to see where the joke could go. There, on the couch, where Mrs.
Viveash and Coleman were now sitting, she had lain sleeping in
his arms.</p>

<p>"Towsing, in Elizabethan," said Coleman.</p>

<p>Unreal, eternal in the secret darkness. A night that was an eternal
parenthesis among the other nights and days.</p>

<p>"I feel I’m going to be sick," said the young man suddenly. He
had wanted to go on silently and haughtily sulking; but his stomach
declined to take part in the dignified game.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" said Gumbril, and jumped up. But before he could
do anything effective, the young man had fulfilled his own prophecy.</p>

<p>"The real charm about debauchery," said Coleman philosophically,
"is its total pointlessness, futility, and above all its incredible
tediousness. If it really were all roses and exhilaration, as
these poor children seem to imagine, it would be no better than
going to church or studying the higher mathematics. I should never
touch a drop of wine or another harlot again. It would be against
my principles. I told you it was emetic," he called to the young
man.</p>

<p>"And what are your principles?" asked Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"Oh, strictly ethical," said Coleman.</p>

<p>"You’re responsible for this creature," said Gumbril, pointing
to the young man, who was sitting on the floor near the fireplace,
cooling his forehead against the marble of the mantelpiece. "You
must take him away. Really, what a bore!" His nose and mouth were
all wrinkled up with disgust.</p>

<p>"I’m sorry," the young man whispered. He kept his eyes shut and
his face was exceedingly pale.</p>

<p>"But with pleasure," said Coleman. "What’s your name?" he asked
the young man, "and where do you live?"</p>

<p>"My name is Porteous," murmured the young man.</p>

<p>"Good lord!" cried Gumbril, letting himself fall on to the couch
beside Mrs. Viveash. "That’s the last straw!" </p>
