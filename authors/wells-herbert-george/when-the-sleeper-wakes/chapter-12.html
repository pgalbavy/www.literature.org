<P>
Graham could now take a clearer view of his position. 
For a long time yet he wandered, but after the
talk of the old man his discovery of this Ostrog was
clear in his mind as the final inevitable decision. One
thing was evident, those who were at the headquarters
of the revolt had succeeded very admirably in
suppressing the fact of his disappearance. But every
moment he expected to hear the report of his death
or of his recapture by the Council.
<P>
Presently a man stopped before him. "Have you
heard? " he said.
<P>
"No!" said Graham starting.
<P>
" Near a dozand," said the man, "a dozand men!"
and hurried on.
<P>
A number of men and a girl passed in the darkness,
gesticulating and shouting: "Capitulated! Given
up!"  A dozand of men." "Two dozand of men."
"Ostrog, Hurrah! Ostrog, Hurrah!" These cries
receded, became indistinct.
<P>
Other shouting men followed. For a time his attention 
was absorbed in the fragments of speech he heard.
He had a doubt whether all were speaking English.
Scraps floated to him, scraps like Pigeon English, like
'nigger' dialect, blurred and mangled distortions. He
dared accost no one with questions. The
impression the people gave him jarred altogether with his
preconceptions of the struggle and confirmed the old
man's faith in Ostrog. It was only slowly he could
bring himself to believe that all these people were
rejoicing at the defeat of the Council, that the Council
which had pursued him with such power and vigour 
was after all the weaker of the two sides in conflict.
And if that was so, how did it affect him? Several
times he hesitated on the verge of fundamental questions. 
Once he turned and walked for a long way
after a little man of rotund inviting outline, but he
was unable to master confidence to address him.
<P>
It was only slowly that it came to him that he might
ask for the "wind-vane offices," whatever the "wind-
vane offices" might be. His first enquiry simply
resulted in a direction to go on towards Westminster.
His second led to the discovery of a short cut in which
he was speedily lost. He was told to leave the ways
to which he had hitherto confined himself knowing
no other means of transit--and to plunge down one
of the middle staircases into the blackness of a 
crossway. Thereupon came some trivial adventures; chief
of these an ambiguous encounter with a gruff-voiced
invisible creature speaking in a strange dialect that
seemed at first a strange tongue, a thick flow of speech
with the drifting corpses of English words therein,
the dialect of the latter-day vile. Then another voice
drew near, a girl's voice singing, "tralala tralala."
She spoke to Graham, her English touched with something 
of the same quality. She professed to have lost
her sister, she blundered needlessly into him he
thought, caught hold of him and laughed. But a
word of vague remonstrance sent her into the unseen
again.
<P>
The sounds about him increased. Stumbling people
passed him, speaking excitedly. "They have surrendered!" 
"The Council! Surely not the Council!"
"They are saying so in the Ways." The passage
seemed wider. Suddenly the wall fell away. He was
in a great space and people were stirring remotely.
He inquired his way of an indistinct figure. "Strike
straight across," said a woman's voice. He left his
guiding wall, and in a moment had stumbled against
a little table on which were utensils of glass. Graham's 
eyes, now attuned to darkness, made out a
long vista with pallid tables on either side. He went
down this. At one or two of the tables he heard a
clang of glass and a sound of eating. There were people 
then cool enough to dine, or daring enough to
steal a meal in spite of social convulsion and darkness. 
Far off and high up he presently saw a pallid
light of a semi-circular shape. As he approached this,
a black edge came up and hid it. He stumbled at
steps and found himself in a gallery. He heard a
sobbing, and found two scared little girls crouched
by a railing. These children became silent at the
near sound of feet. He tried to console them, but
they were very still until he left them. Then as he
receded he could hear them sobbing again.
<P>
Presently he found himself at the foot of a staircase
and near a wide opening. He saw a dim twilight
above this and ascended out of the blackness into a
street of moving Ways again. Along this a disorderly
swarm of people marched shouting. They were singing 
snatches of the song of the revolt, most of them
out of tune. Here and there torches flared creating
brief hysterical shadows. He asked his way and was
twice puzzled by that same thick dialect. His third
attempt won an answer he could understand. He was
two miles from the wind-vane offices in Westminster,
but the way was easy to follow.
<P>
When at last he did approach the district of the
wind-vane offices it seemed to him, from the cheering
processions that came marching along the Ways, from
the tumult of rejoicing, and finally from the restoration
of the lighting of the city, that the overthrow of the
Council must already be accomplished. And still no
news of his absence came to his ears.
<P>
The re-illumination of the city came with startling
abruptness. Suddenly he stood blinking, all about
him men halted dazzled, and the world was incandescent. 
The light found him already upon the outskirts 
of the excited crowds that choked the Ways near
the wind-vane offices, and the sense of visibility and
exposure that came with it turned his colourless 
intention of joining Ostrog to a keen anxiety.
<P>
For a time he was jostled, obstructed, and endangered 
by men hoarse and weary with cheering his
name, some of them bandaged and bloody in his
cause. The frontage of the wind-vane offices was 
illuminated by some moving picture, but what it was he
could not see, because in spite of his strenuous attempts
the density of the crowd prevented his approaching it.
From the fragments of speech he caught, he judged
it conveyed news of the fighting about the Council
House. Ignorance and indecision made him slow and
ineffective in his movements. For a time he could
not conceive how he was to get within the unbroken
facade of this place. He made his way slowly into
the midst of this mass of people, until he realised that
the descending staircase of the central Way led to the
interior of the buildings. This gave him a goal, but
the crowding in the central path was so dense that it
was long before he could reach it. And even then
he encountered intricate obstruction, and had an hour
of vivid argument first in this guard room and then
in that before he could get a note taken to the one
man of all men who was most eager to see him. His
story was laughed to scorn at one place, and wiser for
that, when at last he reached a second stairway he professed 
simply to have news of extraordinary importance 
for Ostrog. What it was he would not say.
They sent his note reluctantly. For a long time he
waited in a little room at the foot of the lift shaft, and
thither at last came Lincoln, eager, apologetic, 
astonished. He stopped in the doorway scrutinising 
Graham, then rushed forward effusively.
<P>
"Yes," he cried. "It is you. And you are not
dead!"
<P>
Graham made a brief explanation.
<P>
"My brother is waiting," explained Lincoln. "He
is alone in the wind-vane offices. We feared you had
been killed in the theatre. He doubted--and things
are very urgent still in spite of what we are telling
them __there__--or he would have come to you."
<P>
They ascended a lift, passed along a narrow passage,
crossed a great hall, empty save for two hurrying 
messengers, and entered a comparatively little room, whose
only furniture was a long settee and a large oval disc
of cloudy, shifting grey, hung by cables from the wall.
There Lincoln left Graham for a space, and he 
remained alone without understanding the shifting
smoky shapes that drove slowly across this disc.
<P>
His attention was arrested by a sound that began
abruptly. It was cheering, the frantic cheering of a
vast but very remote crowd, a roaring exultation.
This ended as sharply as it had begun, like a sound
heard between the opening and shutting of a door.
In the outer room was a noise of hurrying steps and
a melodious clinking as if a loose chain was running
over the teeth of a wheel.
<P>
Then he heard the voice of a woman, the rustle of
unseen garments. "It is Ostrog!" he heard her say.
A little bell rang fitfully, and then everything was still
again.
<P>
Presently came voices, footsteps and movement
without. The footsteps of some one person detached
itself from the other sounds and drew near, firm,
evenly measured steps. The curtain lifted slowly. A
tall, white-haired man, clad in garments of cream
coloured silk, appeared, regarding Graham from under
his raised arm.
<P>
For a moment the white form remained holding the
curtain, then dropped it and stood before it. Graham's
first impression was of a very broad forehead, very
pale blue eyes deep sunken under white brows, an
aquiline nose, and a heavily-lined resolute mouth. The
folds of flesh over the eyes, the drooping of the 
corners of the mouth contradicted the upright bearing,
and said the man was old. Graham rose to his feet
instinctively, and for a moment the two men stood
in silence, regarding each other.
<P>
"You are Ostrog?" said Graham.
<P>
"I am Ostrog."
<P>
"The Boss?"
<P>
"So I am called."
<P>
Graham felt the inconvenience of the silence. "I
have to thank you chiefly, I understand, for my safety,"
he said presently.
<P>
"We were afraid you were killed," said Ostrog.
<P>
"Or sent to sleep again--for ever. We have been
doing everything to keep our secret--the secret of
your disappearance. Where have you been? How
did you get here? "
<P>
Graham told him briefly.
<P>
Ostrog listened in silence.
<P>
He smiled faintly. "Do you know what I was
doing when they came to tell me you had come? "
<P>
"How can I guess?"
<P>
"Preparing your double."
<P>
"My double?"
<P>
"A man as like you as we could find. We were
going to hypnotise him, to save him the difficulty of
acting. It was imperative. The whole of this revolt
depends on the idea that you are awake, alive, and with
us. Even now a great multitude of people has gathered 
in the theatre clamouring to see you. They do
not trust . . . You know, of course--something
of your position? "
<P>
"Very little," said Graham.
<P>
"It is like this." Ostrog walked a pace or two
into the room and turned. "You are absolute owner,"
he said, "of more than half the world. As a result
of that you are practically King. Your powers are
limited in many intricate ways, but you are the figure
head, the popular symbol of government. This White
Council, the Council of Trustees as it is called "
<P>
"I have heard the vague outline of these things."
<P>
"I wondered."
<P>
"I came upon a garrulous old man."
<P>
"I see . . . Our masses--the word comes
from your days--you know of course, that we still
have masses--regard you as our actual ruler. Just
as a great number of people in your days regarded the
Crown as the ruler. They are discontented--the
masses all over the earth--with the rule of your
Trustees. For the most part it is the old discontent,
the old quarrel of the common man with his 
commonness--the misery of work and discipline and unfitness. 
But your Trustees have ruled ill. In certain
matters, in the administration of the Labour Companies, 
for example, they have been unwise. They
have given endless opportunities. Already we of the
popular party were agitating for reforms--when your
waking came. Came! If it had been contrived it
could not have come more opportunity." He smiled.
"The public mind, making no allowance for your
years of quiescence, had already hit on the thought
of waking you and appealing to you, and--Flash!"
<P>
He indicated the outbreak by a gesture, and Graham
moved his head to show that he understood.
<P>
"The Council muddled--quarreled. They always
do. They could not decide what to do with you.
You know how they imprisoned you?"
<P>
"I see. I see. And now--we win?"
<P>
"We win. Indeed we win. Tonight, in five swift
hours. Suddenly we struck everywhere. The windvane 
people, the Labour Company and its millions,
burst the bonds. We got the pull of the aeropiles."
<P>
He paused. "Yes," said Graham, guessing that
aeropile meant flying machine.
<P>
"That was, of course, essential. Or they could
have got away. All the city rose, every third man
almost was in it! All the blue, all the public services,
save only just a few aeronauts and about half the red
police. You were rescued, and their own police of
the Ways--not half of them could be massed at the
Council House--have been broken up, disarmed or
killed. All London is ours--now. Only the Council 
House remains.
<P>
"Half of those who remain to them of the red
police were lost in that foolish attempt to recapture
you. They lost their heads when they lost you. They
flung all they had at the theatre. We cut them off
from the Council House there. Truly tonight has
been a night of victory. Everywhere your star has
blazed. A day ago--the White Council ruled as it
has ruled for a gross of years, for a century and a half
of years, and then, with only a little whispering, a
covert arming here and there, suddenly--So!"
<P>
"I am very ignorant," said Graham. "I suppose--. 
I do not clearly understand the conditions
of this fighting. If you could explain. Where is the
Council? Where is the fight? "
<P>
Ostrog stepped across the room, something clicked,
and suddenly, save for an oval glow, they were in
darkness. For a moment Graham was puzzled.
<P>
Then he saw that the cloudy grey disc had taken
depth and colour, had assumed the appearance of an
oval window looking out upon a strange unfamiliar
scene.
<P>
At the first glance he was unable to guess what this
scene might be. It was a daylight scene, the daylight
of a wintry day, grey and clear. Across the picture
and halfway as it seemed between him and the remoter
view, a stout cable of twisted white wire stretched
vertically. Then he perceived that the rows of great
windwheels he saw, the wide intervals, the occasional
gulfs of darkness, were akin to those through which
he had fled from the Council House. He distinguished
an orderly file of red figures marching across an open
space between files of men in black, and realised before
Ostrog spoke that he was looking down on the upper
surface of latter-day London. The overnight snows
had gone. He judged that this mirror was some modern 
replacement of the camera obscura, but that
matter was not explained to him. He saw that though
the file of red figures was trotting from left to right,
yet they were passing out of the picture to the left.
He wondered momentarily, and then saw that the
picture was passing slowly, panorama fashion, across
the oval.
<P>
"In a moment you will see the fighting," said
Ostrog at his elbow. "Those fellows in red you
notice are prisoners. This is the roof space of 
London--all the houses are practically continuous now.
The streets and public squares are covered in. The
gaps and chasms of your time have disappeared."
<P>
Something out of focus obliterated half the picture.
Its form suggested a man. There was a gleam of
metal, a flash, something that swept across the oval,
as the eyelid of a bird sweeps across its eye, and the
picture was clear again. And now Graham beheld
men running down among the wind-wheels, pointing
weapons from which jetted out little smoky flashes.
They swarmed thicker and thicker to the right, 
gesticulating--it might be they were shouting, but of
that the picture told nothing. They and the 
windwheels passed slowly and steadily across the field of
the mirror.
<P>
"Now," said Ostrog, "comes the Council House,"
and slowly a black edge crept into view and gathered
Graham's attention. Soon it was no longer an edge
but a cavity, a huge blackened space amidst the 
clustering edifices, and from it thin spires of smoke rose
into the pallid winter sky. Gaunt ruinous masses of
the building, mighty truncated piers and girders, rose
dismally out of this cavernous darkness. And over
these vestiges of some splendid place, countless 
minute men were clambering, leaping, swarming.
<P>
"This is the Council House," said Ostrog. "Their
last stronghold. And the fools wasted enough 
ammunition to hold out for a month in blowing up the
buildings all about them--to stop our attack. You
heard the smash? It shattered half the brittle glass
in the city."
<P>
And while he spoke, Graham saw that beyond this
sea of ruins, overhanging it and rising to a great
height, was a ragged mass of white building. This
mass had been isolated by the ruthless destruction of
its surroundings. Black gaps marked the passages
the disaster had torn apart; big halls had been slashed
open and the decoration of their interiors showed 
dismally in the wintry dawn, and down the jagged wall
hung festoons of divided cables and twisted ends of
lines and metallic rods. And amidst all the vast
details moved little red specks, the red-clothed 
defenders of the Council. Every now and then faint flashes
illuminated the bleak shadows. At the first sight it
seemed to Graham that an attack upon this isolated
white building was in progress, but then he perceived
that the party of the revolt was not advancing, but
sheltered amidst the colossal wreckage that encircled
this last ragged stronghold of the red-garbed men, was
keeping up a fitful firing.
<P>
And not ten hours ago he had stood beneath the
ventilating fans in a little chamber within that remote
building wondering what was happening in the world!
<P>
Looking more attentively as this warlike episode
moved silently across the centre of the mirror, Graham 
saw that the white building was surrounded on
every side by ruins, and Ostrog proceeded to describe
in concise phrases how its defenders had sought by
such destruction to isolate themselves from a storm.
He spoke of the loss of men that huge downfall had
entailed in an indifferent tone. He indicated an 
improvised mortuary among the wreckage showed
ambulances swarming like cheese-mites along a 
ruinous groove that had once been a street of moving ways.
He was more interested in pointing out the parts of
the Council House, the distribution of the besiegers.
In a little while the civil contest that had convulsed
London was no longer a mystery to Graham. It was
no tumultuous revolt had occurred that night, no
equal warfare, but a splendidly organised __coup d'etat__.
Ostrog's grasp of details was astonishing; he seemed
to know the business of even the smallest knot of
black and red specks that crawled amidst these places.
<P>
He stretched a huge black arm across the luminous
picture, and showed the room whence Graham had
escaped, and across the chasm of ruins the course of
his flight. Graham recognised the gulf across which
the gutter ran, and the wind-wheels where he had
crouched from the flying machine. The rest of his
path had succumbed to the explosion. He looked
again at the Council House, and it was already half
hidden, and on the right a hillside with a cluster of
domes and pinnacles, hazy, dim and distant, was
gliding into view.
<P>
"And the Council is really overthrown?" he said.
<P>
"Overthrown," said Ostrog.
<P>
"And I--. Is it indeed true that I?"
<P>
"You are Master of the World."
<P>
"But that white flag--"
<P>
"That is the flag of the Council--the flag of the
Rule of the World. It will fall. The fight is over.
Their attack on the theatre was their last frantic 
struggle. They have only a thousand men or so, and some
of these men will be disloyal. They have little 
ammunition. And we are reviving the ancient arts. We are
casting guns."
<P>
"But--help. Is this city the world?"
<P>
" Practically this is all they have left to them of
their empire. Abroad the cities have either revolted
with us or wait the issue. Your awakening has 
perplexed them, paralysed them."
<P>
"But haven't the Council flying machines? Why
is there no fighting with them? "
<P>
"They had. But the greater part of the aeronauts
were in the revolt with us. They wouldn't take the
risk of fighting on our side, but they would not stir
against us. We had to get a pull with the aeronauts.
Quite half were with us, and the others knew it.
Directly they knew you had got away, those looking
for you dropped. We killed the man who shot at
you--an hour ago. And we occupied the flying
stages at the outset in every city we could, and so
stopped and captured the airplanes, and as for the
little flying machines that turned out--for some did--
we kept up too straight and steady a fire for them to
get near the Council House. If they dropped they
couldn't rise again, because there's no clear space
about there for them to get up. Several we have
smashed, several others have dropped and surrendered,
the rest have gone off to the Continent to find a
friendly city if they can before their fuel runs out.
Most of these men were only too glad to be taken 
prisoner and kept out of harm's way. Upsetting in a 
flying machine isn't a very attractive prospect. There's
no chance for the Council that way. Its days are
done."
<P>
He laughed and turned to the oval reflection again
to show Graham what he meant by flying stages.
Even the four nearer ones were remote and obscured
by a thin morning haze. But Graham could perceive
they were very vast structures, judged even by the
standard of the things about them.
<P>
And then as these dim shapes passed to the left
there came again the sight of the expanse across which
the disarmed men in red had been marching. And
then the black ruins, and then again the beleaguered
white fastness of the Council. It appeared no longer
a ghostly pile, but glowing amber in the sunlight, for
a cloud shadow had passed. About it the pigmy
struggle still hung in suspense, but now the red 
defenders were no longer firing.
<P>
So, in a dusky stillness, the man from the nineteenth 
century saw the closing scene of the great
revolt, the forcible establishment of his rule. With a
quality of startling discovery it came to him that this
was his world, and not that other he had left behind;
that this was no spectacle to culminate and cease; that
in this world lay whatever life was still before him, lay
all his duties and dangers and responsibilities. He
turned with fresh questions. Ostrog began to answer
them, and then broke off abruptly. "But these things
I must explain more fully later. At present there are
--duties. The people are coming by the moving
ways towards this ward from every part of the city--
the markets and theatres are densely crowded. You
are just in time for them. They are clamouring to
see you. And abroad they want to see you. Paris,
New York, Chicago, Denver, Capri--thousands of
cities are up and in a tumult, undecided, and 
clamouring to see you. They have clamoured that you should
be awakened for years, and now it is done they will
scarcely believe--"
<P>
But surely--I can't go . . ." 
<P>
Ostrog answered from the other side of the room, 1.
and the picture on the oval disc paled and vanished '
as the light jerked back again." There are 
kinetotele-photographs," he said. "As you bow to the 
people here--all over the world myriads of myriads of
people, packed and still in darkened halls, will see you
also. In black and white, of course--not like this.
And you will hear their shouts reinforcing the shouting
in the hall.
<P>
"And there is an optical contrivance we shall use,"
said Ostrog, "used by some of the posturers and
women dancers. It may be novel to you. You stand
in a very bright light, and they see not you but a
magnified image of you thrown on a screen--so that
even the furtherest man in the remotest gallery can,
if he chooses, count your eyelashes."
<P>
Graham clutched desperately at one of the questions
in his mind. "What is the population of London?"
<P>
"Eight and twaindy myriads."
<P>
"Eight and what? "
<P>
"More than thirty-three millions."        
<P>
These figures went beyond Graham's imagination
"You will be expected to say something," said
Ostrog. "Not what you used to call a Speech, but
what our people call a Word--just one sentence, six
or seven words. Something formal. If I might 
suggest--' I have awakened and my heart is with you.'
That is the sort of thing they want."
<P>
" What was that? " asked Graham.
<P>
"'I am awakened and my heart is with you.' And
bow--bow royally. But first we must get you black
robes--for black is your colour. Do you mind?
And then they will disperse to their homes."
<P>
Graham hesitated. "I am in your hands," he said.
<P>
Ostrog was clearly of that opinion. He thought
for a moment, turned to the curtain and called brief
directions to some unseen attendants. Almost immediately 
a black robe, the very fellow of the black robe
Graham had worn in the theatre, was brought. And
as he threw it about his shoulders there came from
the room without the shrilling of a high-pitched bell.
Ostrog turned in interrogation to the attendant, then
suddenly seemed to change his mind, pulled the 
curtain aside and disappeared.
<P>
For a moment Graham stood with the deferential
attendant listening to Ostrog's retreating steps.
There was a sound of quick question and answer and
of men running. The curtain was snatched back and
Ostrog reappeared, his massive face glowing with
excitement. He crossed the room in a stride, clicked
the room into darkness, gripped Grahams arm and
pointed to the mirror.
<P>
"Even as we turned away," he said.
<P>
Graham saw his index finger, black and colossal,
above the mirrored Council House. For a moment
he did not understand. And then he perceived that
the flagstaff that had carried the white banner was
bare.
<P>
"Do you mean--?" he began.
<P>
"The Council has surrendered. Its rule is at an
end for evermore."
<P>
"Look!" and Ostrog pointed to a coil of black that
crept in little jerks up the vacant flagstaff, unfolding
as it rose.
<P>
The oval picture paled as Lincoln pulled the curtain
aside and entered.
<P>
"They are clamourous," he said.
<P>
Ostrog kept his grip of Graham's arm.
<P>
"We have raised the people," he said. "We have
given them arms. For today at least their wishes
must be law."
<P>
Lincoln held the Curtain open for Graham and
Ostrog to pass through.
<P>
On his way to the markets Graham had a transitory
glance of a long narrow white-walled room in which
men in the universal blue canvas were carrying 
covered things like biers, and about which men in medical
purple hurried to and fro. From this room came
groans and wailing. He had an impression of an
empty blood-stained couch, of men on other couches,
bandaged and blood-stained. It was just a glimpse
from a railed footway and then a buttress hid the place
and they were going on towards the markets.
<P>
The roar of the multitude was near now: it leapt to
thunder. And, arresting his attention, a fluttering of
black banners, the waving of blue canvas and brown
rags, and the swarming vastness of the theatre near
the public markets came into view down a long 
passage. The picture opened out. He perceived they
were entering the great theatre of his first appearance,
the Freat theatre he had last seen as a chequer-work
of glare and blackness in his flight from the red police.
This time he entered it along a gallery at a level high
above the stage. The place was now brilliantly
lit again. He sought the gangway up which he had
fled, but he could not tell it from among its dozens of
fellows; nor could he see anything of the smashed
seats, deflated cushions, and such like traces of
the fight because of the density of the people. Except
the stage the whole place was closely packed. Looking 
down the effect was a vast area of stippled pink,
each dot a still upturned face regarding him. At his
appearance with Ostrog the cheering died away, the
singing died away, a common interest stilled and 
unified the disorder. It seemed as though every 
individual of those myriads was watching him.
