<p>The faces of the Sauk and Jack Carleton lightened up, when Deerfoot
appeared, and warningly raised his finger for them to remain quiet.
That he did not mean they were in imminent peril was shown when
he said, as he took each hand in turn:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is glad to look upon his brothers."</p>

<p>"And we needn't tell you how glad we are to see you, old fellow,"
responded Jack, modulating his voice to the same low key as that
of the Shawanoe; "you were gone so long that we began to think
we would have to hunt you up. Here, take these blamed things,"
he added, passing the bow and quiver to their owner; "I never
was so glad so get rid of any thing."</p>

<p>The lad had shoved the hat of Otto Relstaub under his coat, where
he meant to keep it from the sight of the Shawanoe until after
hearing his story. The young warrior, convinced that no Indians
were near, and that it would require an hour and probably more
for the Pawnees to trace the little party, conversed freely.</p>

<p>The narrative, as may well be supposed, was one of transcendent
interest to Jack Carleton, for it was the first definite knowledge
obtained of his missing friend. The heart of the listener was
filled with pitying sorrow when he learned how Otto had been left
to die alone in the wilderness. Tears filled his eyes, his voice
trembled, and he said:</p>

<p>"We know now that he was living a few days ago, but what hope
is there that he has lasted this long? I am afraid that the most
we can do is to give him burial&mdash;and we haven't the means to do
even that very well."</p>

<p>The three seated themselves on the fallen tree near which the
hat was found, and talked as freely as though no hostile was within
a hundred leagues of them. The Sauk had little to say, a few words
between him and Deerfoot being sufficient. Then, as if to allow
them to talk unreservedly (though, of course, he could not understand
any thing said), he walked a short distance away. He was just
far enough removed to be visible to the two friends. His purpose
was to mount guard while they conversed, though there was little
need, for Deerfoot could never forget his vigilance.</p>

<p>When the touching story was ended, Jack looked at his friend
and asked:</p>

<p>"Do you think he is dead?"</p>

<p>The young Shawanoe nodded his head.</p>

<p>"The Pawnees saw he was very ill; his face was like snow; he
was weak; they laid his gun beside him and covered him with leaves."</p>

<p>"Why didn't they take the gun? It was worth a good deal, and
the Indians hold such things in high value."</p>

<p>"When the Pawnees bury a warrior, they bury his weapons with
him; they were afraid to take the gun; they covered his face with
his hat&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that?" broke in Jack.</p>

<p>"Such were the words of Lone Bear, who spoke with a single tongue."</p>

<p>"If they left Otto three days' journey away, with his hat lying
on his face, I should like to know how it comes to be <em>here</em>."</p>

<p>And Jack drew the article from under his coat, and handed it
to Deerfoot. The latter did not conceal his astonishment, for
he identified Otto's property at once. He asked his friend for
the particulars, and received them.</p>

<p>Deerfoot's theory was overturned by this discovery, and it was
beyond his power to explain the presence of the hat so far away
from where the owner had been abandoned. It would be supposed
that the discovery would throw discredit on the story told by
Lone Bear, inasmuch as the two seemed irreconcilable; but such
was not the case. Deerfoot did not doubt Lone Bear's words, and
I make free to say just here, that subsequent discoveries proved
that the vanquished Pawnee had not deviated from the truth in
the first particular.</p>

<p>The active brain of the young Shawanoe grappled with the puzzling
problem, and he was still unable to solve it, when the faint report
of a gun was borne to the ears of himself and friends. It was
so faint, indeed, that Jack Carleton just caught the sound, but
it was as distinct to the warrior as if fired within a hundred
yards.</p>

<p>I am aware that it sounds incredible when I state that the single
report of the rifle, far away in the wilderness, as it was softly
borne through the miles of intervening space, told the whole story
to Deerfoot the Shawanoe; it solved the mystery; it made clear
that which was hidden; he no longer saw through a glass darkly;
the history of Otto Relstaub was as plain as if it had fallen
from his own lips.</p>

<p>I repeat that it will seem incredible to the reader that such
a thing could be true, but I shall soon make plain how it all
came about.</p>

<p>The sound of the gun was from a point due south. Deerfoot having
fixed it clearly in his mind, said something in a low voice to
the Sauk, who had turned his head and was looking as if he expected
some summons. Then, rising to his feet, he addressed Jack:</p>

<p>"The night will soon come; we must make haste."</p>

<p>"Ain't you going to search the ground for Otto's trail?" asked
Jack, who had hoped that the powerful eyes of Deerfoot would reveal
to him that which was hidden from the Sauk.</p>

<p>"There is no trail here," replied the Shawanoe, glancing at the
ground, and walking away with a stride which seemed reckless,
when it is remembered that the Pawnees were not far off. In fact,
the course of the three took them close to the war party who were
so clamorous for their scalps; but the task of flanking a company
of hostiles was not difficult to Deerfoot. He let his friends
know when the situation was delicate, and each used the utmost
circumspection; but the young leader deviated so far to one side
that he soon placed them in the rear.</p>

<p>Nearly half the day remained, and there was time to cover a great
deal of ground. Deerfoot did not break into that loping trot which
he could maintain from sunrise to sunset, but his strides were
so long and rapid that Jack was on the point more than once of
being forced into a run.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe so shaped his course that he passed the tree near
which he had placed the rifle, tomahawk, and knife of Lone Bear.
A glance showed him they were still there, and he smiled in his
shadowy way, but held his peace. He did not tell his friends the
story, knowing the panic-stricken Pawnee would not reclaim his
weapons until the hour fixed&mdash;sunset.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton was well aware, from the manner of Deerfoot, that
he was carrying out some theory of his own, though the boy failed
to connect it with that far-away report of a rifle. He was far
from suspecting the surprising truth. Nothing would have pleased
him more than to have had the Shawanoe explain what line of policy
he had adopted, but I have shown long ago that Deerfoot was inclined
to keep such matters to himself until their truth or falsity was
established. Jack knew better than to seek to draw any thing from
him, and, since he was equally reserved toward Hay-uta, the young
Kentuckian could not feel that he had any ground for impatience.</p>

<p>As they advanced, the ground became broken and rocky. Traveling
was difficult&mdash;that is, to Jack Carleton&mdash;who bruised himself
several times in his efforts to hold his own. He was on the point
of protesting, when Deerfoot halted.</p>

<p>Hay-uta showed some signs of the severe strain to which he had
been subjected. His chest rose and sank faster than usual, and
his dusky countenance was slightly flushed. Jack's face was aglow;
he breathed hard and fast, and felt as though he would like to
sit down and rest a few hours. But Deerfoot was as unruffled as
if he had walked only a mile or two at a leisurely pace.</p>

<p>And yet a crisis was at hand. There was something in the eyes
and face of the Shawanoe which showed a consciousness that they
were near the end: within the following few hours it would come.</p>

<p>Deerfoot pointed to a ridge a short distance to the south. The
top was rocky and precipitous, and the trees and vegetation were
so scarce that the rugged baldness could be seen a long ways through
the woods.</p>

<p>"The Sauk will hunt from <em>there to there</em>," said the Shawanoe,
indicating a spot a quarter of a mile to the south, and pointing
by the sweep of his arm to another almost opposite where they
stood. "Deerfoot will hunt from <em>there to there</em>," he added,
marking out a similar, though more extensive field, in the other
direction.</p>

<p>"And what am <em>I</em> to do?" asked Jack, half amused and just
a little provoked at what he knew was coming.</p>

<p>"My brother's legs are weary; they want rest; let him sit down
and wait till Deerfoot and Hay-uta come back to him."</p>

<p>"The same old dodge!" exclaimed the lad. "I would give a good
deal if some one would explain why in the mischief I was brought
along with this party anyhow."</p>

<p>"My brother is gentle-hearted; his voice is soft as that of the
pappoose when it laughs in its mother's eyes; his face is beautiful;
the hearts of Hay-uta and Deerfoot are sad, but when they look
into the face of their brother their hearts become light and they
feel strong."</p>

<p>This was the most extensive joke in the way of a remark that
Deerfoot had ever been known to originate. Jack Carleton saw his
slight smile and the twinkle of his black eyes, and knew he was
quizzing him. Assuming a seriousness which deceived no one, the
doughty Kentuckian deliberately leaned his gun against the nearest
tree, pretended to roll up his sleeves, spat on his hands, rubbed
them together and clenched them and advanced threateningly upon
the Shawanoe. The latter feigned alarm, and, ducking his head,
as if to dodge the threatened blow, ran away so swiftly that before
Jack could take more than half a dozen steps in pursuit, he was
out of sight.</p>

<p>Hay-uta could not be considered handsome, but the smile which
lighted up his features made them interesting, to say the least.
When he grinned, he did so to the extent of his ability, which
was considerable in that direction.</p>

<p>But the Sauk had been assigned to an important duty, and the
Shawanoe having departed, he did not linger. He waved a parting
salute to Jack Carleton, who, a few minutes later, found himself
alone, much the same as he had been left when Shawanoe and Sauk
crossed the river to reconnoiter the Pawnee camp.</p>

<p>"There's one thing certain," he said to himself, recalling the
parallelism, "whatever happens, I won't be caught as I was then;
I'm not going to climb a tree, and I mean to hold fast to my gun;
but we have come so far from the river that we must be a long
ways from that party of Pawnees, unless," he reflected, glancing
to the rear, "they have struck our trail and have followed hard
after us."</p>

<p>The possibility of such danger was not great, but Jack Carleton
changed his position to one where he could keep a better lookout,
with less danger of discovery. He was sure his friends would not
be absent a long time, and he meant to avoid embarrassing their
action.</p>

<p>"It was the sound of that gun which led Deerfoot to come all
this way. I wonder what it can mean."</p>

<p>Jack had got this far in his meditation, when he heard a footfall
near him, and, just as he turned his head, a familiar voice called
out:</p>

<p>"<em>Helloa, Shack, ish dot you?</em>"</p>
