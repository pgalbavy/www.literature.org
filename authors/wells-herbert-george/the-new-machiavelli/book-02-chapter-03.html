There comes into my mind a confused memory of conversations with 
Margaret; we must have had dozens altogether, and they mix in now 
for the most part inextricably not only with one another, but with 
later talks and with things we discussed at Pangbourne.  We had the 
immensest anticipations of the years and opportunities that lay 
before us.  I was now very deeply in love with her indeed.  I felt 
not that I had cleaned up my life but that she had.  We called each 
other "confederate" I remember, and made during our brief engagement 
a series of visits to the various legislative bodies in London, the 
County Council, the House of Commons, where we dined with Villiers, 
and the St. Pancras Vestry, where we heard Shaw speaking.  I was 
full of plans and so was she of the way in which we were to live and 
work.  We were to pay back in public service whatever excess of 
wealth beyond his merits old Seddon's economic advantage had won for 
him from the toiling people in the potteries.  The end of the Boer 
War was so recent that that blessed word "efficiency" echoed still 
in people's minds and thoughts.  Lord Roseberry in a memorable 
oration had put it into the heads of the big outer public, but the 
Baileys with a certain show of justice claimed to have set it going 
in the channels that took it to him--if as a matter of fact it was 
taken to him.  But then it was their habit to make claims of that 
sort.  They certainly did their share to keep "efficient" going.  
Altiora's highest praise was "thoroughly efficient."  We were to be 
a "thoroughly efficient" political couple of the "new type."  She 
explained us to herself and Oscar, she explained us to ourselves, 
she explained us to the people who came to her dinners and 
afternoons until the world was highly charged with explanation and 
expectation, and the proposal that I should be the Liberal candidate 
for the Kinghamstead Division seemed the most natural development in 
the world.
<P>
I was full of the ideal of hard restrained living and relentless 
activity, and throughout a beautiful November at Venice, where 
chiefly we spent our honeymoon, we turned over and over again and 
discussed in every aspect our conception of a life tremendously 
focussed upon the ideal of social service.
<P>
Most clearly there stands out a picture of ourselves talking in a 
gondola on our way to Torcella.  Far away behind us the smoke of 
Murano forms a black stain upon an immense shining prospect of 
smooth water, water as unruffled and luminous as the sky above, a 
mirror on which rows of posts and distant black high-stemmed, swan-
necked boats with their minutely clear swinging gondoliers, float 
aerially.  Remote and low before us rises the little tower of our 
destination.  Our men swing together and their oars swirl leisurely 
through the water, hump back in the rowlocks, splash sharply and go 
swishing back again.  Margaret lies back on cushions, with her face 
shaded by a holland parasol, and I sit up beside her.
<P>
"You see," I say, and in spite of Margaret's note of perfect 
acquiescence I feel myself reasoning against an indefinable 
antagonism, "it is so easy to fall into a slack way with life.  
There may seem to be something priggish in a meticulous discipline, 
but otherwise it is so easy to slip into indolent habits--and to be 
distracted from one's purpose.  The country, the world, wants men to 
serve its constructive needs, to work out and carry out plans.  For 
a man who has to make a living the enemy is immediate necessity; for 
people like ourselves it's--it's the constant small opportunity of 
agreeable things."
<P>
"Frittering away," she says, "time and strength."
<P>
"That is what I feel.  It's so pleasant to pretend one is simply 
modest, it looks so foolish at times to take one's self too 
seriously.  We've GOT to take ourselves seriously."
<P>
She endorses my words with her eyes.
<P>
"I feel I can do great things with life."
<P>
"I KNOW you can."
<P>
"But that's only to be done by concentrating one's life upon one 
main end.  We have to plan our days, to make everything subserve our 
scheme."
<P>
"I feel," she answers softly, "we ought to give--every hour."
<P>
Her face becomes dreamy.  "I WANT to give every hour," she adds.

That holiday in Venice is set in my memory like a little artificial 
lake in uneven confused country, as something very bright and 
skylike, and discontinuous with all about it.  The faded quality of 
the very sunshine of that season, the mellow discoloured palaces and 
places, the huge, time-ripened paintings of departed splendours, the 
whispering, nearly noiseless passage of hearse-black gondolas, for 
the horrible steam launch had not yet ruined Venice, the stilled 
magnificences of the depopulated lagoons, the universal autumn, made 
me feel altogether in recess from the teeming uproars of reality.  
There was not a dozen people all told, no Americans and scarcely any 
English, to dine in the big cavern of a dining-room, with its vistas 
of separate tables, its distempered walls and its swathed 
chandeliers.  We went about seeing beautiful things, accepting 
beauty on every hand, and taking it for granted that all was well 
with ourselves and the world.  It was ten days or a fortnight before 
I became fretful and anxious for action; a long tranquillity for 
such a temperament as mine.
<P>
Our pleasures were curiously impersonal, a succession of shared 
aesthetic appreciation threads all that time.  Our honeymoon was no 
exultant coming together, no mutual shout of "YOU!"  We were almost 
shy with one another, and felt the relief of even a picture to help 
us out.  It was entirely in my conception of things that I should be 
very watchful not to shock or distress Margaret or press the 
sensuous note.  Our love-making had much of the tepid smoothness of 
the lagoons.  We talked in delicate innuendo of what should be 
glorious freedoms.  Margaret had missed Verona and Venice in her 
previous Italian journey--fear of the mosquito had driven her mother 
across Italy to the westward route--and now she could fill up her 
gaps and see the Titians and Paul Veroneses she already knew in 
colourless photographs, the Carpaccios, (the St. George series 
delighted her beyond measure,) the Basaitis and that great statue of 
Bartolomeo Colleoni that Ruskin praised.
<P>
But since I am not a man to look at pictures and architectural 
effects day after day, I did watch Margaret very closely and store a 
thousand memories of her.  I can see her now, her long body drooping 
a little forward, her sweet face upraised to some discovered 
familiar masterpiece and shining with a delicate enthusiasm.  I can 
hear again the soft cadences of her voice murmuring commonplace 
comments, for she had no gift of expressing the shapeless 
satisfaction these things gave her.
<P>
Margaret, I perceived, was a cultivated person, the first cultivated 
person with whom I had ever come into close contact.  She was 
cultivated and moral, and I, I now realise, was never either of 
these things.  She was passive, and I am active.  She did not simply 
and naturally look for beauty but she had been incited to look for 
it at school, and took perhaps a keener interest in books and 
lectures and all the organisation of beautiful things than she did 
in beauty itself; she found much of her delight in being guided to 
it.  Now a thing ceases to be beautiful to me when some finger points 
me out its merits.  Beauty is the salt of life, but I take my beauty 
as a wild beast gets its salt, as a constituent of the meal. . . .
<P>
And besides, there was that between us that should have seemed more 
beautiful than any picture. . . .
<P>
So we went about Venice tracking down pictures and spiral staircases 
and such-like things, and my brains were busy all the time with such 
things as a comparison of Venice and its nearest modern equivalent, 
New York, with the elaboration of schemes of action when we returned 
to London, with the development of a theory of Margaret.
<P>
Our marriage had done this much at least, that it had fused and 
destroyed those two independent ways of thinking about her that had 
gone on in my mind hitherto.  Suddenly she had become very near to 
me, and a very big thing, a sort of comprehensive generalisation 
behind a thousand questions, like the sky or England.  The judgments 
and understandings that had worked when she was, so to speak, miles 
away from my life, had now to be altogether revised.  Trifling 
things began to matter enormously, that she had a weak and easily 
fatigued back, for example, or that when she knitted her brows and 
stammered a little in talking, it didn't really mean that an 
exquisite significance struggled for utterance.
<P>
We visited pictures in the mornings chiefly.  In the afternoon, 
unless we were making a day-long excursion in a gondola, Margaret 
would rest for an hour while I prowled about in search of English 
newspapers, and then we would go to tea in the Piazza San Marco and 
watch the drift of people feeding the pigeons and going into the 
little doors beneath the sunlit arches and domes of Saint Mark's.  
Then perhaps we would stroll on the Piazzetta, or go out into the 
sunset in a gondola.  Margaret became very interested in the shops 
that abound under the colonnades and decided at last to make an 
extensive purchase of table glass.  "These things," she said, are 
quite beautiful, and far cheaper than anything but the most ordinary 
looking English ware."  I was interested in her idea, and a good 
deal charmed by the delightful qualities of tinted shape, slender 
handle and twisted stem.  I suggested we should get not simply 
tumblers and wineglasses but bedroom waterbottles, fruit- and sweet-
dishes, water-jugs, and in the end we made quite a business-like 
afternoon of it.
<P>
I was beginning now to long quite definitely for events.  Energy was 
accumulating in me, and worrying me for an outlet.  I found the 
TIMES and the DAILY TELEGRAPH and the other papers I managed to get 
hold of, more and more stimulating.  I nearly wrote to the former 
paper one day in answer to a letter by Lord Grimthorpe--I forget now 
upon what point.  I chafed secretly against this life of tranquil 
appreciations more and more.  I found my attitudes of restrained and 
delicate affection for Margaret increasingly difficult to sustain.  
I surprised myself and her by little gusts of irritability, gusts 
like the catspaws before a gale.  I was alarmed at these symptoms.
<P>
One night when Margaret had gone up to her room, I put on a light 
overcoat, went out into the night and prowled for a long time 
through the narrow streets, smoking and thinking.  I returned and 
went and sat on the edge of her bed to talk to her.
<P>
"Look here, Margaret," I said; "this is all very well, but I'm 
restless."
<P>
"Restless! " she said with a faint surprise in her voice.
<P>
"Yes.  I think I want exercise.  I've got a sort of feeling--I've 
never had it before--as though I was getting fat."
<P>
"My dear!" she cried.
<P>
"I want to do things;--ride horses, climb mountains, take the devil 
out of myself."
<P>
She watched me thoughtfully.
<P>
"Couldn't we DO something?" she said.
<P>
Do what?
<P>
"I don't know.  Couldn't we perhaps go away from here soon--and walk 
in the mountains--on our way home."
<P>
I thought.  "There seems to be no exercise at all in this place."
<P>
"Isn't there some walk?"
<P>
"I wonder," I answered.  "We might walk to Chioggia perhaps, along 
the Lido."  And we tried that, but the long stretch of beach 
fatigued Margaret's back, and gave her blisters, and we never got 
beyond Malamocco. . . .
<P>
A day or so after we went out to those pleasant black-robed, bearded 
Armenians in their monastery at Saint Lazzaro, and returned towards 
sundown.  We fell into silence.  "PIU LENTO," said Margaret to the 
gondolier, and released my accumulated resolution.
<P>
"Let us go back to London," I said abruptly.
<P>
Margaret looked at me with surprised blue eyes.
<P>
"This is beautiful beyond measure, you know," I said, sticking to my 
point, "but I have work to do."
<P>
She was silent for some seconds.  "I had forgotten," she said.
<P>
"So had I," I sympathised, and took her hand.  "Suddenly I have 
remembered."
<P>
She remained quite still.  "There is so much to be done," I said, 
almost apologetically.
<P>
She looked long away from me across the lagoon and at last sighed, 
like one who has drunk deeply, and turned to me.
<P>
"I suppose one ought not to be so happy," she said.  "Everything has 
been so beautiful and so simple and splendid.  And clean.  It has 
been just With You--the time of my life.  It's a pity such things 
must end.  But the world is calling you, dear. . . .  I ought not to 
have forgotten it.  I thought you were resting--and thinking.  But 
if you are rested.--Would you like us to start to-morrow?"
<P>
She looked at once so fragile and so devoted that on the spur of the 
moment I relented, and we stayed in Venice four more days.
