<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>BILLY BYRNE and Eddie Shorter rode steadily in the direction of the
hills. Upon either side and at intervals of a mile or more stretched the
others of their party, occasionally visible; but for the most part not.
Once in the hills the two could no longer see their friends or be seen
by them.
</p>
<p>Both Byrne and Eddie felt that chance had placed them upon the right
trail for a well-marked and long-used path wound upward through a canyon
along which they rode. It was an excellent location for an ambush, and
both men breathed more freely when they had passed out of it into more
open country upon a narrow tableland between the first foothills and the
main range of mountains.
</p><p>Here again was the trail well marked, and when Eddie, looking ahead, saw
that it appeared to lead in the direction of a vivid green spot close to
the base of the gray brown hills he gave an exclamation of assurance.
</p><p>“We're on the right trail all right, old man,” he said. “They's water
there,” and he pointed ahead at the green splotch upon the gray. “That's
where they'd be havin' their village. I ain't never been up here so I
ain't familiar with the country. You see we don't run no cattle this
side the river--the Pimans won't let us. They don't care to have no
white men pokin' round in their country; but I'll bet a hat we find a
camp there.”
</p><p>Onward they rode toward the little spot of green. Sometimes it was
in sight and again as they approached higher ground, or wound through
gullies and ravines it was lost to their sight; but always they kept it
as their goal. The trail they were upon led to it--of that there
could be no longer the slightest doubt. And as they rode with their
destination in view black, beady eyes looked down upon them from the
very green oasis toward which they urged their ponies--tiring now from
the climb.
</p><p>A lithe, brown body lay stretched comfortably upon a bed of grasses at
the edge of a little rise of ground beneath which the riders must pass
before they came to the cluster of huts which squatted in a tiny natural
park at the foot of the main peak. Far above the watcher a spring of
clear, pure water bubbled out of the mountain-side, and running downward
formed little pools among the rocks which held it. And with this water
the Pimans irrigated their small fields before it sank from sight again
into the earth just below their village. Beside the brown body lay a
long rifle. The man's eyes watched, unblinking, the two specks far below
him whom he knew and had known for an hour were gringos.
</p><p>Another brown body wormed itself forward to his side and peered over the
edge of the declivity down upon the white men. He spoke a few words in
a whisper to him who watched with the rifle, and then crawled back again
and disappeared. And all the while, onward and upward came Billy Byrne
and Eddie Shorter, each knowing in his heart that if not already, then
at any moment a watcher would discover them and a little later a bullet
would fly that would find one of them, and they took the chance for the
sake of the American girl who lay hidden somewhere in these hills, for
in no other way could they locate her hiding place more quickly. Any one
of the other eight Americans who rode in pairs into the hills at other
points to the left and right of Billy Byrne and his companion would
have and was even then cheerfully taking the same chances that Eddie and
Billy took, only the latter were now assured that to one of them would
fall the sacrifice, for as they had come closer Eddie had seen a thin
wreath of smoke rising from among the trees of the oasis. Now, indeed,
were they sure that they had chanced upon the trail to the Piman
village.
</p><p>“We gotta keep our eyes peeled,” said Eddie, as they wound into a ravine
which from its location evidently led directly up to the village. “We
ain't far from 'em now, an' if they get us they'll get us about here.”
</p><p>As though to punctuate his speech with the final period a rifle cracked
above them. Eddie jumped spasmodically and clutched his breast.
</p><p>“I'm hit,” he said, quite unemotionally.
</p><p>Billy Byrne's revolver had answered the shot from above them, the bullet
striking where Billy had seen a puff of smoke following the rifle shot.
Then Billy turned toward Eddie.
</p><p>“Hit bad?” he asked.
</p><p>“Yep, I guess so,” said Eddie. “What'll we do? Hide up here, or ride
back after the others?”
</p><p>Another shot rang out above them, although Billy had been watching for
a target at which to shoot again--a target which he had been positive he
would get when the man rose to fire again. And Billy did see the fellow
at last--a few paces from where he had first fired; but not until the
other had dropped Eddie's horse beneath him. Byrne fired again, and this
time he had the satisfaction of seeing a brown body rise, struggle a
moment, and then roll over once upon the grass before it came to rest.
</p><p>“I reckon we'll stay here,” said Billy, looking ruefully at Eddie's
horse.
</p><p>Eddie rose and as he did so he staggered and grew very white. Billy
dismounted and ran forward, putting an arm about him. Another shot came
from above and Billy Byrne's pony grunted and collapsed.
</p><p>“Hell!” exclaimed Byrne. “We gotta get out of this,” and lifting his
wounded comrade in his arms he ran for the shelter of the bluff from the
summit of which the snipers had fired upon them. Close in, hugging the
face of the perpendicular wall of tumbled rock and earth, they were
out of range of the Indians; but Billy did not stop when he had reached
temporary safety. Farther up toward the direction in which lay the
village, and halfway up the side of the bluff Billy saw what he took to
be excellent shelter. Here the face of the bluff was less steep and
upon it lay a number of large bowlders, while others protruded from the
ground about them.
</p><p>Toward these Billy made his way. The wounded man across his shoulder
was suffering indescribable agonies; but he bit his lip and stifled the
cries that each step his comrade took seemed to wrench from him, lest he
attract the enemy to their position.
</p><p>Above them all was silence, yet Billy knew that alert, red foemen were
creeping to the edge of the bluff in search of their prey. If he could
but reach the shelter of the bowlders before the Pimans discovered them!
</p><p>The minutes that were consumed in covering the hundred yards seemed as
many hours to Billy Byrne; but at last he dragged the fainting cowboy
between two large bowlders close under the edge of the bluff and found
himself in a little, natural fortress, well adapted to defense.
</p><p>From above they were protected from the fire of the Indians upon the
bluff by the height of the bowlder at the foot of which they lay, while
another just in front hid them from possible marksmen across the canyon.
Smaller rocks scattered about gave promise of shelter from flank fire,
and as soon as he had deposited Eddie in the comparative safety of their
retreat Byrne commenced forming a low breastwork upon the side facing
the village--the direction from which they might naturally expect
attack. This done he turned his attention to the opening upon the
opposite side and soon had a similar defense constructed there, then he
turned his attention to Eddie, though keeping a watchful eye upon both
approaches to their stronghold.
</p><p>The Kansan lay upon his side, moaning. Blood stained his lips and
nostrils, and when Billy Byrne opened his shirt and found a gaping wound
in his right breast he knew how serious was his companion's injury. As
he felt Billy working over him the boy opened his eyes.
</p><p>“Do you think I'm done for?” he asked in a tortured whisper.
</p><p>“Nothin' doin',” lied Billy cheerfully. “Just a scratch. You'll be all
right in a day or two.”
</p><p>Eddie shook his head wearily. “I wish I could believe you,” he said. “I
ben figgerin' on goin' back to see maw. I ain't thought o' nothin' else
since you told me 'bout how she missed me. I ken see her right now just
like I was there. I'll bet she's scrubbin' the kitchen floor. Maw was
always a-scrubbin' somethin'. Gee! but it's tough to cash in like this
just when I was figgerin' on goin' home.”
</p><p>Billy couldn't think of anything to say. He turned to look up and down
the canyon in search of the enemy.
</p><p>“Home!” whispered Eddie. “Home!”
</p><p>“Aw, shucks!” said Billy kindly. “You'll get home all right, kid. The
boys must a-heard the shootin' an' they'll be along in no time now. Then
we'll clean up this bunch o' coons an' have you back to El Orobo an'
nursed into shape in no time.”
</p><p>Eddie tried to smile as he looked up into the other's face. He reached a
hand out and laid it on Billy's arm.
</p><p>“You're all right, old man,” he whispered. “I know you're lyin' an' so
do you; but it makes me feel better anyway to have you say them things.”
</p><p>Billy felt as one who has been caught stealing from a blind man. The
only adequate reply of which he could think was, “Aw, shucks!”
</p><p>“Say,” said Eddie after a moment's silence, “if you get out o' here an'
ever go back to the States promise me you'll look up maw and paw an'
tell 'em I was comin' home--to stay. Tell 'em I died decent, too, will
you--died like paw was always a-tellin' me my granddad died, fightin'
Injuns 'round Fort Dodge somewheres.”
</p><p>“Sure,” said Billy; “I'll tell 'em. Gee! Look who's comin' here,” and
as he spoke he flattened himself to the ground just as a bullet pinged
against the rock above his head and the report of a rifle sounded
from up the canyon. “That guy most got me. I'll have to be 'tendin' to
business better'n this.”
</p><p>He drew himself slowly up upon his elbows, his carbine ready in his
hand, and peered through a small aperture between two of the rocks which
composed his breastwork. Then he stuck the muzzle of the weapon through,
took aim and pulled the trigger.
</p><p>“Didje get him?” asked Eddie.
</p><p>“Yep,” said Billy, and fired again. “Got that one too. Say, they're
tough-lookin' guys; but I guess they won't come so fast next time. Those
two were right in the open, workin' up to us on their bellies. They must
a-thought we was sleepin'.”
</p><p>For an hour Billy neither saw nor heard any sign of the enemy, though
several times he raised his hat above the breastwork upon the muzzle of
his carbine to draw their fire.
</p><p>It was midafternoon when the sound of distant rifle fire came faintly to
the ears of the two men from somewhere far below them.
</p><p>“The boys must be comin',” whispered Eddie Shorter hopefully.
</p><p>For half an hour the firing continued and then silence again fell upon
the mountains. Eddie began to wander mentally. He talked much of Kansas
and his old home, and many times he begged for water.
</p><p>“Buck up, kid,” said Billy; “the boys'll be along in a minute now an'
then we'll get you all the water you want.”
</p><p>But the boys did not come. Billy was standing up now, stretching his
legs, and searching up and down the canyon for Indians. He was wondering
if he could chance making a break for the valley where they stood
some slight chance of meeting with their companions, and even as he
considered the matter seriously there came a staccato report and Billy
Byrne fell forward in a heap.
</p><p>“God!” cried Eddie. “They got him now, they got him.”
</p><p>Byrne stirred and struggled to rise.
</p><p>“Like'll they got me,” he said, and staggered to his knees.
</p><p>Over the breastwork he saw a half-dozen Indians running rapidly toward
the shelter--he saw them in a haze of red that was caused not by blood
but by anger. With an oath Billy Byrne leaped to his feet. From his
knees up his whole body was exposed to the enemy; but Billy cared not.
He was in a berserker rage. Whipping his carbine to his shoulder he let
drive at the advancing Indians who were now beyond hope of cover. They
must come on or be shot down where they were, so they came on, yelling
like devils and stopping momentarily to fire upon the rash white man who
stood so perfect a target before them.
</p><p>But their haste spoiled their marksmanship. The bullets zinged and
zipped against the rocky little fortress, they nicked Billy's shirt and
trousers and hat, and all the while he stood there pumping lead into
his assailants--not hysterically; but with the cool deliberation of a
butcher slaughtering beeves.
</p><p>One by one the Pimans dropped until but a single Indian rushed
frantically upon the white man, and then the last of the assailants
lunged forward across the breastwork with a bullet from Billy's carbine
through his forehead.
</p><p>Eddie Shorter had raised himself painfully upon an elbow that he might
witness the battle, and when it was over he sank back, the blood welling
from between his set teeth.
</p><p>Billy turned to look at him when the last of the Pimans was disposed
of, and seeing his condition kneeled beside him and took his head in the
hollow of an arm.
</p><p>“You orter lie still,” he cautioned the Kansan. “Tain't good for you to
move around much.”
</p><p>“It was worth it,” whispered Eddie. “Say, but that was some scrap. You
got your nerve standin' up there against the bunch of 'em; but if you
hadn't they'd have rushed us and some of 'em would a-got in.”
</p><p>“Funny the boys don't come,” said Billy.
</p><p>“Yes,” replied Eddie, with a sigh; “it's milkin' time now, an' I
figgered on goin' to Shawnee this evenin'. Them's nice cookies, maw.
I--”
</p><p>Billy Byrne was bending low to catch his feeble words, and when the
voice trailed out into nothingness he lowered the tousled red head to
the hard earth and turned away.
</p><p>Could it be that the thing which glistened on the eyelid of the toughest
guy on the West Side was a tear?
</p><p>The afternoon waned and night came, but it brought to Billy Byrne
neither renewed attack nor succor. The bullet which had dropped him
momentarily had but creased his forehead. Aside from the fact that he
was blood covered from the wound it had inconvenienced him in no way,
and now that darkness had fallen he commenced to plan upon leaving the
shelter.
</p><p>First he transferred Eddie's ammunition to his own person, and such
valuables and trinkets as he thought “maw” might be glad to have, then
he removed the breechblock from Eddie's carbine and stuck it in his
pocket that the weapon might be valueless to the Indians when they found
it.
</p><p>“Sorry I can't bury you old man,” was Billy's parting comment, as he
climbed over the breastwork and melted into the night.
</p><p>Billy Byrne moved cautiously through the darkness, and he moved not in
the direction of escape and safety but directly up the canyon in the way
that the village of the Pimans lay.
</p><p>Soon he heard the sound of voices and shortly after saw the light of
cook fires playing upon bronzed faces and upon the fronts of low huts.
Some women were moaning and wailing. Billy guessed that they mourned for
those whom his bullets had found earlier in the day. In the darkness of
the night, far up among the rough, forbidding mountains it was all very
weird and uncanny.
</p><p>Billy crept closer to the village. Shelter was abundant. He saw no sign
of sentry and wondered why they should be so lax in the face of almost
certain attack. Then it occurred to him that possibly the firing he and
Eddie had heard earlier in the day far down among the foothills might
have meant the extermination of the Americans from El Orobo.
</p><p>“Well, I'll be next then,” mused Billy, and wormed closer to the huts.
His eyes were on the alert every instant, as were his ears; but no sign
of that which he sought rewarded his keenest observation.
</p><p>Until midnight he lay in concealment and all that time the mourners
continued their dismal wailing. Then, one by one, they entered their
huts, and silence reigned within the village.
</p><p>Billy crept closer. He eyed each hut with longing, wondering gaze. Which
could it be? How could he determine? One seemed little more promising
than the others. He had noted those to which Indians had retired. There
were three into which he had seen none go. These, then, should be the
first to undergo his scrutiny.
</p><p>The night was dark. The moon had not yet risen. Only a few dying fires
cast a wavering and uncertain light upon the scene. Through the shadows
Billy Byrne crept closer and closer. At last he lay close beside one of
the huts which was to be the first to claim his attention.
</p><p>For several moments he lay listening intently for any sound which might
come from within; but there was none. He crawled to the doorway and
peered within. Utter darkness shrouded and hid the interior.
</p><p>Billy rose and walked boldly inside. If he could see no one within, then
no one could see him once he was inside the door. Therefore, so reasoned
Billy Byrne, he would have as good a chance as the occupants of the hut,
should they prove to be enemies.
</p><p>He crossed the floor carefully, stopping often to listen. At last he
heard a rustling sound just ahead of him. His fingers tightened upon the
revolver he carried in his right hand, by the barrel, clublike. Billy
had no intention of making any more noise than necessary.
</p><p>Again he heard a sound from the same direction. It was not at all unlike
the frightened gasp of a woman. Billy emitted a low growl, in fair
imitation of a prowling dog that has been disturbed.
</p><p>Again the gasp, and a low: “Go away!” in liquid feminine tones--and in
English!
</p><p>Billy uttered a low: “S-s-sh!” and tiptoed closer. Extending his hands
they presently came in contact with a human body which shrank from him
with another smothered cry.
</p><p>“Barbara!” whispered Billy, bending closer.
</p><p>A hand reached out through the darkness, found him, and closed upon his
sleeve.
</p><p>“Who are you?” asked a low voice.
</p><p>“Billy,” he replied. “Are you alone in here?”
</p><p>“No, an old woman guards me,” replied the girl, and at the same time
they both heard a movement close at hand, and something scurried
past them to be silhouetted for an instant against the path of lesser
darkness which marked the location of the doorway.
</p><p>“There she goes!” cried Barbara. “She heard you and she has gone for
help.”
</p><p>“Then come!” said Billy, seizing the girl's arm and dragging her to her
feet; but they had scarce crossed half the distance to the doorway when
the cries of the old woman without warned them that the camp was being
aroused.
</p><p>Billy thrust a revolver into Barbara's hand. “We gotta make a fight of
it, little girl,” he said. “But you'd better die than be here alone.”
</p><p>As they emerged from the hut they saw warriors running from every
doorway. The old woman stood screaming in Piman at the top of her lungs.
Billy, keeping Barbara in front of him that he might shield her body
with his own, turned directly out of the village. He did not fire at
first hoping that they might elude detection and thus not draw the fire
of the Indians upon them; but he was doomed to disappointment, and they
had taken scarcely a dozen steps when a rifle spoke above the noise of
human voices and a bullet whizzed past them.
</p><p>Then Billy replied, and Barbara, too, from just behind his shoulder.
Together they backed away toward the shadow of the trees beyond the
village and as they went they poured shot after shot into the village.
</p><p>The Indians, but just awakened and still half stupid from sleep, did not
know but that they were attacked by a vastly superior force, and this
fear held them in check for several minutes--long enough for Billy and
Barbara to reach the summit of the bluff from which Billy and Eddie had
first been fired upon.
</p><p>Here they were hidden from the view of the Indians, and Billy broke
at once into a run, half carrying the girl with a strong arm about her
waist.
</p><p>“If we can reach the foothills,” he said, “I think we can dodge 'em, an'
by goin' all night we may reach the river and El Orobo by morning. It's
a long hike, Barbara, but we gotta make it--we gotta, for if daylight
finds us in the Piman country we won't never make it. Anyway,” he
concluded optimistically, “it's all down hill.”
</p><p>“We'll make it, Billy,” she replied, “if we can get past the sentry.”
</p><p>“What sentry?” asked Billy. “I didn't see no sentry when I come in.”
</p><p>“They keep a sentry way down the trail all night,” replied the girl. “In
the daytime he is nearer the village--on the top of this bluff, for from
here he can see the whole valley; but at night they station him farther
away in a narrow part of the trail.”
</p><p>“It's a mighty good thing you tipped me off,” said Billy; “for I'd a-run
right into him. I thought they was all behind us now.”
</p><p>After that they went more cautiously, and when they reached the part of
the trail where the sentry might be expected to be found, Barbara warned
Billy of the fact. Like two thieves they crept along in the shadow of
the canyon wall. Inwardly Billy cursed the darkness of the night which
hid from view everything more than a few paces from them; yet it may
have been this very darkness which saved them, since it hid them as
effectually from an enemy as it hid the enemy from them. They had
reached the point where Barbara was positive the sentry should be.
The girl was clinging tightly to Billy's left arm. He could feel the
pressure of her fingers as they sunk into his muscles, sending little
tremors and thrills through his giant frame. Even in the face of death
Billy Byrne could sense the ecstasies of personal contact with this
girl--the only woman he ever had loved or ever would.
</p><p>And then a black shadow loomed before them, and a rifle flashed in their
faces without a word or a sign of warning.
