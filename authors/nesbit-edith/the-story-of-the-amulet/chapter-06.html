   'How many miles to Babylon?
   Three score and ten!
   Can I get there by candle light?
   Yes, and back again!'</p>

<p>Jane was singing to her doll, rocking it to and fro in the house
which she had made for herself and it.  The roof of the house was
the dining-table, and the walls were tablecloths and
antimacassars hanging all round, and kept in their places by
books laid on their top ends at the table edge.</p>

<p>The others were tasting the fearful joys of domestic tobogganing. 
You know how it is done - with the largest and best tea-tray and
the surface of the stair carpet.  It is best to do it on the days
when the stair rods are being cleaned, and the carpet is only
held by the nails at the top.  Of course, it is one of the five
or six thoroughly tip-top games that grown-up people are so
unjust to - and old Nurse, though a brick in many respects, was
quite enough of a standard grown-up to put her foot down on the
tobogganing long before any of the performers had had half enough
of it.  The tea- tray was taken away, and the baffled party
entered the sitting-room, in exactly the mood not to be pleased
if they could help it.</p>

<p>So Cyril said, 'What a beastly mess!'</p>

<p>And Robert added, 'Do shut up, Jane!'</p>

<p>Even Anthea, who was almost always kind, advised Jane to try
another song.  'I'm sick to death of that,' said she.</p>

<p>It was a wet day, so none of the plans for seeing all the sights
of London that can be seen for nothing could be carried out. 
Everyone had been thinking all the morning about the wonderful
adventures of the day before, when Jane had held up the charm and
it had turned into an arch, through which they had walked
straight out of the present time and the Regent's Park into the
land of Egypt eight thousand years ago.  The memory of
yesterday's happenings was still extremely fresh and frightening,
so that everyone hoped that no one would suggest another
excursion into the past, for it seemed to all that yesterday's
adventures were quite enough to last for at least a week.  Yet
each felt a little anxious that the others should not think it
was afraid, and presently Cyril, who really was not a coward,
began to see that it would not be at all nice if he should have
to think himself one.  So he said - </p>

<p>'I say - about that charm - Jane - come out.  We ought to talk about
it, anyhow.'</p>

<p>'Oh, if that's all,' said Robert.</p>

<p>Jane obediently wriggled to the front of her house and sat there.</p>

<p>She felt for the charm, to make sure that it was still round her
neck.</p>

<p>'It ISN'T all,' said Cyril, saying much more than he meant
because he thought Robert's tone had been rude - as indeed it had.</p>

<p>'We ought to go and look for that Amulet.  What's the good of
having a first-class charm and keeping it idle, just eating its
head off in the stable.'</p>

<p>'I'M game for anything, of course,' said Robert; but he added,
with a fine air of chivalry, 'only I don't think the girls are
keen today somehow.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes; I am,' said Anthea hurriedly.  'If you think I'm
afraid, I'm not.'</p>

<p>'I am though,' said Jane heavily; 'I didn't like it, and I won't
go there again - not for anything I won't.'</p>

<p>'We shouldn't go THERE again, silly,' said Cyril; 'it would be
some other place.'</p>

<p>'I daresay; a place with lions and tigers in it as likely as
not.'</p>

<p>Seeing Jane so frightened, made the others feel quite brave. 
They said they were certain they ought to go.</p>

<p>'It's so ungrateful to the Psammead not to,' Anthea added, a
little primly.</p>

<p>Jane stood up.  She was desperate.</p>

<p>'I won't!' she cried; 'I won't, I won't, I won't!  If you make me
I'll scream and I'll scream, and I'll tell old Nurse, and I'll
get her to burn the charm in the kitchen fire.  So now, then!'</p>

<p>You can imagine how furious everyone was with Jane for feeling
what each of them had felt all the morning.  In each breast the
same thought arose, 'No one can say it's OUR fault.'  And they at
once began to show Jane how angry they all felt that all the
fault was hers.  This made them feel quite brave.</p>

<blockquote><div>'Tell-tale tit, its tongue shall be split,<br />
And all the dogs in our town shall have a little bit,'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>sang Robert.</p>

<p>'It's always the way if you have girls in anything.'  Cyril spoke
in a cold displeasure that was worse than Robert's cruel
quotation, and even Anthea said, 'Well, I'M not afraid if I AM a
girl,' which of course, was the most cutting thing of all.</p>

<p>Jane picked up her doll and faced the others with what is
sometimes called the courage of despair.</p>

<p>'I don't care,' she said; 'I won't, so there!  It's just silly
going to places when you don't want to, and when you don't know
what they're going to be like!  You can laugh at me as much as
you like.  You're beasts - and I hate you all!'</p>

<p>With these awful words she went out and banged the door.</p>

<p>Then the others would not look at each other, and they did not
feel so brave as they had done.</p>

<p>Cyril took up a book, but it was not interesting to read.  Robert
kicked a chair-leg absently.  His feet were always eloquent in
moments of emotion.  Anthea stood pleating the end of the
tablecloth into folds - she seemed earnestly anxious to get all
the pleats the same size.  The sound of Jane's sobs had died
away.</p>

<p>Suddenly Anthea said, 'Oh! let it be &quot;pax&quot; - poor little
Pussy - you know she's the youngest.'</p>

<p>'She called us beasts,' said Robert, kicking the chair suddenly.</p>

<p>'Well, said Cyril, who was subject to passing fits of justice,
'we began, you know.  At least you did.'  Cyril's justice was
always uncompromising.</p>

<p>'I'm not going to say I'm sorry if you mean that,' said Robert,
and the chair-leg cracked to the kick he gave as he said it.</p>

<p>'Oh, do let's,' said Anthea, 'we're three to one, and Mother does
so hate it if we row.  Come on.  I'll say I'm sorry first, though
I didn't say anything, hardly.'</p>

<p>'All right, let's get it over,' said Cyril, opening the
door.'Hi - you - Pussy!'</p>

<p>Far away up the stairs a voice could be heard singing brokenly,
but still defiantly - </p>

<blockquote><div>'How many miles (sniff) to Babylon?<br />
Three score and ten! (sniff)<br />
Can I get there by candle light?<br />
Yes (sniff), and back again!'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>It was trying, for this was plainly meant to annoy.  But Anthea
would not give herself time to think this.  She led the way up
the stairs, taking three at a time, and bounded to the level of
Jane, who sat on the top step of all, thumping her doll to the
tune of the song she was trying to sing.</p>

<p>'I say, Pussy, let it be pax!  We're sorry if you are - '</p>

<p>It was enough.  The kiss of peace was given by all.  Jane being
the youngest was entitled to this ceremonial.  Anthea added a
special apology of her own.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry if I was a pig, Pussy dear,' she said - 'especially
because in my really and truly inside mind I've been feeling a
little as if I'd rather not go into the Past again either.  But
then, do think.  If we don't go we shan't get the Amulet, and oh,
Pussy, think if we could only get Father and Mother and The Lamb
safe back!  We MUST go, but we'll wait a day or two if you like
and then perhaps you'll feel braver.'</p>

<p>'Raw meat makes you brave, however cowardly you are,' said
Robert, to show that there was now no ill-feeling, 'and
cranberries - that's what Tartars eat, and they're so brave it's
simply awful.  I suppose cranberries are only for Christmas time,
but I'll ask old Nurse to let you have your chop very raw if you
like.'</p>

<p>'I think I could be brave without that,' said Jane hastily; she
hated underdone meat.  'I'll try.'</p>

<p>At this moment the door of the learned gentleman's room opened,
and he looked out.</p>

<p>'Excuse me,' he said, in that gentle, polite weary voice of his,
'but was I mistaken in thinking that I caught a familiar word
just now?  Were you not singing some old ballad of Babylon?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Robert, 'at least Jane was singing &quot;How many miles,&quot;
but I shouldn't have thought you could have heard the words
for - '</p>

<p>He would have said, 'for the sniffing,' but Anthea pinched him
just in time.</p>

<p>'I did not hear ALL the words,' said the learned gentleman.  'I
wonder would you recite them to me?'</p>

<p>So they all said together - </p>

<blockquote><div>'How many miles to Babylon?<br />
Three score and ten!<br />
Can I get there by candle light?<br />
Yes, and back again!'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>'I wish one could,' the learned gentleman said with a sigh.</p>

<p>'Can't you?' asked Jane.</p>

<p>'Babylon has fallen,' he answered with a sigh.  'You know it was
once a great and beautiful city, and the centre of learning and
Art, and now it is only ruins, and so covered up with earth that
people are not even agreed as to where it once stood.'</p>

<p>He was leaning on the banisters, and his eyes had a far-away look
in them, as though he could see through the staircase window the
splendour and glory of ancient Babylon.</p>

<p>'I say,' Cyril remarked abruptly.  'You know that charm we showed
you, and you told us how to say the name that's on it?'</p>

<p>'Yes!'</p>

<p>'Well, do you think that charm was ever in Babylon?'</p>

<p>'It's quite possible,' the learned gentleman replied.  'Such
charms have been found in very early Egyptian tombs, yet their
origin has not been accurately determined as Egyptian.  They may
have been brought from Asia.  Or, supposing the charm to have
been fashioned in Egypt, it might very well have been carried to
Babylon by some friendly embassy, or brought back by the
Babylonish army from some Egyptian campaign as part of the spoils
of war.  The inscription may be much later than the charm.  Oh
yes! it is a pleasant fancy, that that splendid specimen of yours
was once used amid Babylonish surroundings.' The others looked at
each other, but it was Jane who spoke.</p>

<p>'Were the Babylon people savages, were they always fighting and
throwing things about?'  For she had read the thoughts of the
others by the unerring light of her own fears.</p>

<p>'The Babylonians were certainly more gentle than the Assyrians,'
said the learned gentleman.  'And they were not savages by any
means.  A very high level of culture,' he looked doubtfully at
his audience and went on, 'I mean that they made beautiful
statues and jewellery, and built splendid palaces.  And they were
very learned- they had glorious libraries and high towers for the
purpose of astrological and astronomical observation.'</p>

<p>'Er?' said Robert.</p>

<p>'I mean for - star-gazing and fortune-telling,' said the learned
gentleman, 'and there were temples and beautiful hanging
gardens - '</p>

<p>'I'll go to Babylon if you like,' said Jane abruptly, and the
others hastened to say 'Done!' before she should have time to
change her mind.</p>

<p>'Ah,' said the learned gentleman, smiling rather sadly, 'one can
go so far in dreams, when one is young.'  He sighed again, and
then adding with a laboured briskness, 'I hope you'll have
a - a - jolly game,' he went into his room and shut the door.</p>

<p>'He said &quot;jolly&quot; as if it was a foreign language,' said Cyril. 
'Come on, let's get the Psammead and go now.  I think Babylon
seems a most frightfully jolly place to go to.'</p>

<p>So they woke the Psammead and put it in its bass-bag with the
waterproof sheet, in case of inclement weather in Babylon.  It
was very cross, but it said it would as soon go to Babylon as
anywhere else.  'The sand is good thereabouts,' it added.</p>

<p>Then Jane held up the charm, and Cyril said - </p>

<p>'We want to go to Babylon to look for the part of you that was
lost.  Will you please let us go there through you?'</p>

<p>'Please put us down just outside,' said Jane hastily; 'and then
if we don't like it we needn't go inside.'</p>

<p>'Don't be all day,' said the Psammead.</p>

<p>So Anthea hastily uttered the word of power, without which the
charm could do nothing.</p>

<p>'Ur - Hekau - Setcheh!' she said softly, and as she spoke the charm
grew into an arch so tall that the top of it was close against
the bedroom ceiling.  Outside the arch was the bedroom painted
chest-of-drawers and the Kidderminster carpet, and the
washhand-stand with the riveted willow-pattern jug, and the faded
curtains, and the dull light of indoors on a wet day.  Through
the arch showed the gleam of soft green leaves and white
blossoms.  They stepped forward quite happily.  Even Jane felt
that this did not look like lions, and her hand hardly trembled
at all as she held the charm for the others to go through, and
last, slipped through herself, and hung the charm, now grown
small again, round her neck.</p>

<p>The children found themselves under a white-blossomed,
green-leafed fruit-tree, in what seemed to be an orchard of such
trees, all white-flowered and green-foliaged.  Among the long
green grass under their feet grew crocuses and lilies, and
strange blue flowers.  In the branches overhead thrushes and
blackbirds were singing, and the coo of a pigeon came softly to
them in the green quietness of the orchard.</p>

<p>'Oh, how perfectly lovely!' cried Anthea.</p>

<p>'Why, it's like home exactly - I mean England - only everything's
bluer, and whiter, and greener, and the flowers are bigger.'</p>

<p>The boys owned that it certainly was fairly decent, and even Jane
admitted that it was all very pretty.</p>

<p>'I'm certain there's nothing to be frightened of here,' said
Anthea.</p>

<p>'I don't know,' said Jane.  'I suppose the fruit-trees go on just
the same even when people are killing each other.  I didn't half
like what the learned gentleman said about the hanging gardens. 
I suppose they have gardens on purpose to hang people in.  I do
hope this isn't one.'</p>

<p>'Of course it isn't,' said Cyril.  'The hanging gardens are just
gardens hung up - <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> think on chains between houses, don't you
know, like trays.  Come on; let's get somewhere.'</p>

<p>They began to walk through the cool grass.  As far as they could
see was nothing but trees, and trees and more trees.  At the end
of their orchard was another one, only separated from theirs by a
little stream of clear water.  They jumped this, and went on. 
Cyril, who was fond of gardening - which meant that he liked to
watch the gardener at work - was able to command the respect of
the others by telling them the names of a good many trees.  There
were nut-trees and almond-trees, and apricots, and fig-trees with
their big five-fingered leaves.  And every now and then the
children had to cross another brook.</p>

<p>'It's like between the squares in Through the Looking-glass,'
said Anthea.</p>

<p>At last they came to an orchard which was quite different from
the other orchards.  It had a low building in one corner.</p>

<p>'These are vines,' said Cyril superiorly, 'and I know this is a
vineyard.  I shouldn't wonder if there was a wine-press inside
that place over there.'</p>

<p>At last they got out of the orchards and on to a sort of road,
very rough, and not at all like the roads you are used to.  It
had cypress trees and acacia trees along it, and a sort of hedge
of tamarisks, like those you see on the road between Nice and
Cannes, or near Littlehampton, if you've only been as far as
that.</p>

<p>And now in front of them they could see a great mass of
buildings.  There were scattered houses of wood and stone here
and there among green orchards, and beyond these a great wall
that shone red in the early morning sun.  The wall was enormously
high - more than half the height of St Paul's - and in the wall
were set enormous gates that shone like gold as the rising sun
beat on them.  Each gate had a solid square tower on each side of
it that stood out from the wall and rose above it.  Beyond the
wall were more towers and houses, gleaming with gold and bright
colours.  Away to the left ran the steel-blue swirl of a great
river.  And the children could see, through a gap in the trees,
that the river flowed out from the town under a great arch in the
wall.</p>

<p>'Those feathery things along by the water are palms,' said Cyril
instructively.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes; you know everything,' Robert replied.  'What's all that
grey-green stuff you see away over there, where it's all flat and
sandy?'</p>

<p>'All right,' said Cyril loftily, '<span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> don't want to tell you
anything.  I only thought you'd like to know a palm-tree when you
saw it again.'</p>

<p>'Look!' cried Anthea; 'they're opening the gates.'</p>

<p>And indeed the great gates swung back with a brazen clang, and
instantly a little crowd of a dozen or more people came out and
along the road towards them.</p>

<p>The children, with one accord, crouched behind the tamarisk
hedge.</p>

<p>'I don't like the sound of those gates,' said Jane.  'Fancy being
inside when they shut.  You'd never get out.'</p>

<p>'You've got an arch of your own to go out by,' the Psammead put
its head out of the basket to remind her.  'Don't behave so like
a girl.  If I were you I should just march right into the town
and ask to see the king.'</p>

<p>There was something at once simple and grand about this idea, and
it pleased everyone.</p>

<p>So when the work-people had passed (they WERE work-people, the
children felt sure, because they were dressed so plainly - just
one long blue shirt thing - of blue or yellow) the four children
marched boldly up to the brazen gate between the towers.  The
arch above the gate was quite a tunnel, the walls were so thick.</p>

<p>'Courage,' said Cyril.  'Step out.  It's no use trying to sneak
past.  Be bold!'</p>

<p>Robert answered this appeal by unexpectedly bursting into 'The
British Grenadiers', and to its quick-step they approached the
gates of Babylon.</p>

<blockquote><div>'Some talk of Alexander,<br />
And some of Hercules,<br />
Of Hector and Lysander,<br />
And such great names as these.<br />
But of all the gallant heroes ...'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>This brought them to the threshold of the gate, and two men in
bright armour suddenly barred their way with crossed spears.</p>

<p>'Who goes there?' they said.</p>

<p>(I think I must have explained to you before how it was that the
children were always able to understand the language of any place
they might happen to be in, and to be themselves understood.  If
not, I have no time to explain it now.)</p>

<p>'We come from very far,' said Cyril mechanically.  'From the
Empire where the sun never sets, and we want to see your King.'</p>

<p>'If it's quite convenient,' amended Anthea. 'The King (may he
live for ever!),' said the gatekeeper, 'is gone to fetch home his
fourteenth wife.  Where on earth have you come from not to know
that?'</p>

<p>'The Queen then,' said Anthea hurriedly, and not taking any
notice of the question as to where they had come from.</p>

<p>'The Queen,' said the gatekeeper, '(may she live for ever!) gives
audience today three hours after sunrising.'</p>

<p>'But what are we to do till the end of the three hours?' asked
Cyril.</p>

<p>The gatekeeper seemed neither to know nor to care.  He appeared
less interested in them than they could have thought possible. 
But the man who had crossed spears with him to bar the children's
way was more human.</p>

<p>'Let them go in and look about them,' he said.  'I'll wager my
best sword they've never seen anything to come near our
little - village.' He said it in the tone people use for when they
call the Atlantic Ocean the 'herring pond'.</p>

<p>The gatekeeper hesitated.</p>

<p>'They're only children, after all,' said the other, who had
children of his own.  'Let me off for a few minutes, Captain, and
I'll take them to my place and see if my good woman can't fit
them up in something a little less outlandish than their present
rig.  Then they can have a look round without being mobbed.  May
I go?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, if you like,' said the Captain, 'but don't be all day.'</p>

<p>The man led them through the dark arch into the town.  And it was
very different from London.  For one thing, everything in London
seems to be patched up out of odds and ends, but these houses
seemed to have been built by people who liked the same sort of
things.  Not that they were all alike, for though all were
squarish, they were of different sizes, and decorated in all
sorts of different ways, some with paintings in bright colours,
some with black and silver designs.  There were terraces, and
gardens, and balconies, and open spaces with trees.  Their guide
took them to a little house in a back street, where a kind-faced
woman sat spinning at the door of a very dark room.</p>

<p>'Here,' he said, 'just lend these children a mantle each, so that
they can go about and see the place till the Queen's audience
begins.  You leave that wool for a bit, and show them round if
you like.  I must be off now.'</p>

<p>The woman did as she was told, and the four children, wrapped in
fringed mantles, went with her all about the town, and oh! how I
wish I had time to tell you all that they saw.  It was all so
wonderfully different from anything you have ever seen.  For one
thing, all the houses were dazzlingly bright, and many of them
covered with pictures.  Some had great creatures carved in stone
at each side of the door.  Then the people - there were no black
frock-coats and tall hats; no dingy coats and skirts of good,
useful, ugly stuffs warranted to wear.  Everyone's clothes were
bright and beautiful with blue and scarlet and green and gold.</p>

<p>The market was brighter than you would think anything could be. 
There were stalls for everything you could possibly want - and for
a great many things that if you wanted here and now, want would
be your master.  There were pineapples and peaches in heaps - and
stalls of crockery and glass things, beautiful shapes and
glorious colours, there were stalls for necklaces, and clasps,
and bracelets, and brooches, for woven stuffs, and furs, and
embroidered linen.  The children had never seen half so many
beautiful things together, even at Liberty's.  It seemed no time
at all before the woman said - </p>

<p>'It's nearly time now.  We ought to be getting on towards the
palace.  It's as well to be early.' So they went to the palace,
and when they got there it was more splendid than anything they
had seen yet.</p>

<p>For it was glowing with colours, and with gold and silver and
black and white - like some magnificent embroidery.  Flight after
flight of broad marble steps led up to it, and at the edges of
the stairs stood great images, twenty times as big as a
man - images of men with wings like chain armour, and hawks'
heads, and winged men with the heads of dogs.  And there were the
statues of great kings.</p>

<p>Between the flights of steps were terraces where fountains
played, and the Queen's Guard in white and scarlet, and armour
that shone like gold, stood by twos lining the way up the stairs;
and a great body of them was massed by the vast door of the
palace itself, where it stood glittering like an impossibly
radiant peacock in the noon-day sun.</p>

<p>All sorts of people were passing up the steps to seek audience of
the Queen.  Ladies in richly-embroidered dresses with fringy
flounces, poor folks in plain and simple clothes, dandies with
beards oiled and curled.</p>

<p>And Cyril, Robert, Anthea and Jane, went with the crowd.</p>

<p>At the gate of the palace the Psammead put one eye cautiously out
of the basket and whispered - </p>

<p>'I can't be bothered with queens.  I'll go home with this lady. 
I'm sure she'll get me some sand if you ask her to.'</p>

<p>'Oh! don't leave us,' said Jane. The woman was giving some last
instructions in Court etiquette to Anthea, and did not hear Jane.</p>

<p>'Don't be a little muff,' said the Psammead quite fiercely. 
'It's not a bit of good your having a charm.  You never use it. 
If you want me you've only got to say the name of power and ask
the charm to bring me to you.'</p>

<p>'I'd rather go with you,' said Jane.  And it was the most
surprising thing she had ever said in her life.</p>

<p>Everyone opened its mouth without thinking of manners, and
Anthea, who was peeping into the Psammead's basket, saw that its
mouth opened wider than anybody's.</p>

<p>'You needn't gawp like that,' Jane went on.  'I'm not going to be
bothered with queens any more than IT is.  And I know, wherever
it is, it'll take jolly good care that it's safe.'</p>

<p>'She's right there,' said everyone, for they had observed that
the Psammead had a way of knowing which side its bread was
buttered.</p>

<p>She turned to the woman and said, 'You'll take me home with you,
won't you?  And let me play with your little girls till the
others have done with the Queen.'</p>

<p>'Surely I will, little heart!' said the woman.</p>

<p>And then Anthea hurriedly stroked the Psammead and embraced Jane,
who took the woman's hand, and trotted contentedly away with the
Psammead's bag under the other arm.</p>

<p>The others stood looking after her till she, the woman, and the
basket were lost in the many-coloured crowd.  Then Anthea turned
once more to the palace's magnificent doorway and said - </p>

<p>'Let's ask the porter to take care of our Babylonian overcoats.'</p>

<p>So they took off the garments that the woman had lent them and
stood amid the jostling petitioners of the Queen in their own
English frocks and coats and hats and boots.</p>

<p>'We want to see the Queen,' said Cyril; 'we come from the far
Empire where the sun never sets!'</p>

<p>A murmur of surprise and a thrill of excitement ran through the
crowd.  The door-porter spoke to a black man, he spoke to someone
else.  There was a whispering, waiting pause.  Then a big man,
with a cleanly-shaven face, beckoned them from the top of a
flight of red marble steps.</p>

<p>They went up; the boots of Robert clattering more than usual
because he was so nervous.  A door swung open, a curtain was
drawn back.  A double line of bowing forms in gorgeous raiment
formed a lane that led to the steps of the throne, and as the
children advanced hurriedly there came from the throne a voice
very sweet and kind.</p>

<p>'Three children from the land where the sun never sets!  Let them
draw hither without fear.'</p>

<p>In another minute they were kneeling at the throne's foot,
saying, 'O Queen, live for ever!' exactly as the woman had taught
them.  And a splendid dream-lady, all gold and silver and jewels
and snowy drift of veils, was raising Anthea, and saying - </p>

<p>'Don't be frightened, I really am SO glad you came!  The land
where the sun never sets!  I am delighted to see you!  I was
getting quite too dreadfully bored for anything!'</p>

<p>And behind Anthea the kneeling Cyril whispered in the ears of the
respectful Robert - </p>

<p>'Bobs, don't say anything to Panther.  It's no use upsetting her,
but we didn't ask for Jane's address, and the Psammead's with
her.'</p>

<p>'Well,' whispered Robert, 'the charm can bring them to us at any
moment.  IT said so.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' whispered Cyril, in miserable derision, 'WE'RE all
right, of course.  So we are!  Oh, yes!  If we'd only GOT the
