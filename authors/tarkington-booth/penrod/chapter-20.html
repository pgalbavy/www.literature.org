<p>"Indeed, doctor," said Mrs. Schofield, with agitation and profound
conviction, just after eight o'clock that evening, "I shall <em>ALWAYS
</em>believe in mustard plasters&mdash;mustard plasters and hot&mdash;water
bags. If it hadn't been for them I don't believed he'd have <em>LIVED
</em>till you got here &mdash;I do <em>NOT</em>!"</p>

<p>"Margaret," called Mr. Schofield from the open door of a bedroom,
"Margaret, where did you put that aromatic ammonia? Where's Margaret?"</p>

<p>But he had to find the aromatic spirits of ammonia himself, for
Margaret was not in the house. She stood in the shadow beneath
a maple tree near the street corner, a guitar-case in her hand;
and she scanned with anxiety a briskly approaching figure. The
arc light, swinging above, revealed this figure as that of him
she awaited. He was passing toward the gate without seeing her,
when she arrested him with a fateful whisper.</p>

<p>"<em>BOB</em>!"</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Williams swung about hastily. "Why, Margaret!"</p>

<p>"Here, take your guitar," she whispered hurriedly. "I was afraid
if father happened to find it he'd break it all to pieces!"</p>

<p>"What for?" asked the startled Robert.</p>

<p>"Because I'm sure he knows it's yours." "But what&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Bob," she moaned, "I was waiting here to tell you. I was
so afraid you'd try to come in&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>TRY!" </em>exclaimed the unfortunate young man, quite dumfounded.
"<em>TRY </em>to come&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, before I warned you. I've been waiting here to tell you,
Bob, you mustn't come near the house if I were you I'd stay away
from even this neighbourhood&mdash;far away! For a while I don't think
it would be actually <em>SAFE </em>for&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Margaret, will you please&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It's all on account of that dollar you gave Penrod this morning,"
she walled. "First, he bought that horrible concertina that made
papa so furious&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But Penrod didn't tell that I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, wait!" she cried lamentably. "Listen! He didn't tell at
lunch, but he got home about dinner-time in the most&mdash;well! I've
seen pale people before, but nothing like Penrod. Nobody could
<em>IMAGINE </em>it&mdash;not unless they'd seen him! And he looked,
so <em>STRANGE, </em>and kept making such unnatural faces, and
at first all he would say was that he'd eaten a little piece of
apple and thought it must have some microbes on it. But he got
sicker and sicker, and we put him to bed&mdash;and then we all thought
he was going to die&mdash;and, of <em>COURSE, </em>no little piece
of apple would have&mdash;well, and he kept getting worse and then
he said he'd had a dollar. He said he'd spent it for the concertina,
and watermelon, and chocolate-creams, and licorice sticks, and
lemon-drops, and peanuts, and jaw-breakers, and sardines, and
raspberry lemonade, and pickles, and popcorn, and ice-cream, and
cider, and sausage&mdash;there was sausage in his pocket, and mamma
says his jacket is ruined&mdash;and cinnamon drops&mdash;and waffles&mdash;and
he ate four or five lobster croquettes at lunch&mdash;and papa said,
'Who gave you that dollar?' Only he didn't say '<em>WHO'&mdash;</em>he
said something horrible, Bob! And Penrod thought he was going
to die, and he said you gave it to him, and oh! it was just pitiful
to hear the poor child, Bob, because he thought he was dying,
you see, and he blamed you for the whole thing. He said if you'd
only let him alone and not given it to him, he'd have grown up
to be a good man&mdash;and now he couldn't! I never heard anything
so heart-rending&mdash;he was so weak he could hardly whisper, but
he kept trying to talk, telling us over and over it was all your
fault."</p>

<p>In the darkness Mr. Williams' facial expression could not be
seen, but his voice sounded hopeful.</p>

<p>"Is he&mdash;is he still in a great deal of pain?"</p>

<p>"They say the crisis is past," said Margaret, "but the doctor's
still up there. He said it was the acutest case of indigestion
he had ever treated in the whole course of his professional practice."</p>

<p>"Of course <em>I</em> didn't know what he'd do with the dollar,"
said Robert.</p>

<p>She did not reply.</p>

<p>He began plaintively, "Margaret, you don't&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I've never seen papa and mamma so upset about anything," she
said, rather primly.</p>

<p>"You mean they're upset about ME?"</p>

<p>"We <em>ARE </em>all very much upset," returned Margaret, more
starch in her tone as she remembered not only Penrod's sufferings
but a duty she had vowed herself to perform.</p>

<p>"Margaret! <em>YOU </em>don't&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Robert," she said firmly and, also, with a rhetorical complexity
which breeds a suspicion of pre-rehearsal&mdash;"Robert, for the present
I can only look at it in one way: when you gave that money to
Penrod you put into the hands of an unthinking little child a
weapon which might be, and, indeed was, the means of his undoing.
Boys are not respon&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But you saw me give him the dollar, and you didn't&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Robert!" she checked him with increasing severity. "I am only
a woman and not accustomed to thinking everything out on the spur
of the moment; but I cannot change my mind. Not now, at least."</p>

<p>"And you think I'd better not come in to-night?"</p>

<p>"To-night!" she gasped. "Not for <em>WEEKS! </em>Papa would&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But Margaret," he urged plaintively, "how can you blame me for&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I have not used the word 'blame,'" she interrupted. "But I must
insist that for your carelessness to&mdash;to wreak such havoc&mdash;cannot
fail to&mdash;to lessen my confidence in your powers of judgment. I
cannot change my convictions in this matter&mdash;not to-night&mdash;and
I cannot remain here another instant. The poor child may need
me. Robert, good-night."</p>

<p>With chill dignity she withdrew, entered the house, and returned
to the sick-room, leaving the young man in outer darkness to brood
upon his crime&mdash;and upon Penrod.</p>

<p>That sincere invalid became convalescent upon the third day;
and a week elapsed, then, before he found an opportunity to leave
the house unaccompanied&mdash;save by Duke. But at last he set forth
and approached the Jones neighbourhood in high spirits, pleasantly
conscious of his pallor, hollow cheeks, and other perquisites
of illness provocative of interest.</p>

<p>One thought troubled him a little because it gave him a sense
of inferiority to a rival. He believed, against his will, that
Maurice Levy could have successfully eaten chocolate-creams, licorice
sticks, lemon-drops, jaw-breakers, peanuts, waffles, lobster croquettes,
sardines, cinnamon-drops, watermelon, pickles, popcorn, ice-cream
and sausage with raspberry lemonade and cider. Penrod had admitted
to himself that Maurice could do it and afterward attend to business,
or pleasure, without the slightest discomfort; and this was probably
no more than a fair estimate of one of the great constitutions
of all time. As a digester, Maurice Levy would have disappointed
a Borgia.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Maurice was still at Atlantic City&mdash;and now the
convalescent's heart leaped. In the distance he saw Marjorie coming&mdash;in
pink again, with a ravishing little parasol over her head. And
alone! No Mitchy-Mitch was to mar this meeting.</p>

<p>Penrod increased the feebleness of his steps, now and then leaning
upon the fence as if for support.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Marjorie?" he said, in his best sick-room voice,
as she came near.</p>

<p>To his pained amazement, she proceeded on her way, her nose at
a celebrated elevation&mdash;an icy nose.</p>

<p>She cut him dead.</p>

<p>He threw his invalid's airs to the winds, and hastened after
her.</p>

<p>"Marjorie," he pleaded, "what's the matter? Are you mad? Honest,
that day you said to come back next morning, and you'd be on the
corner, I was sick. Honest, I was <em>AWFUL </em>sick, Marjorie!
I had to have the doctor&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>DOCTOR!" </em>She whirled upon him, her lovely eyes blazing.</p>

<p>"I guess WE'VE had to have the doctor enough at <em>OUR </em>house,
thanks to you, Mister Penrod Schofield. Papa says you haven't
got <em>NEAR </em>sense enough to come in out of the rain, after
what you did to poor little Mitchy-Mitch&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and he's sick in bed <em>YET!" </em>Marjorie went on, with
unabated fury. "And papa says if he ever catches you in this part
of town&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>WHAT'D I </em>do to Mitchy-Mitch?" gasped Penrod.</p>

<p>"You know well enough what you did to Mitchy-Mitch!" she cried.
"You gave him that great, big, nasty two-cent piece!"</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?"</p>

<p>"Mitchy-Mitch swallowed it!"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"And papa says if he ever just lays eyes on you, once, in this
neighbourhood&#11834;"</p>

<p>But Penrod had started for home.</p>

<p>In his embittered heart there was increasing a critical disapproval
of the Creator's methods. When He made pretty girls, thought Penrod,
why couldn't He have left out their little brothers!</p>
