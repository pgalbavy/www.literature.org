<P>
IN the great emergencies of life we feel, or we act, as our
dispositions incline us. But we never think. Mercy's mind was a
blank as she descended the stairs. On her way down she was
conscious of nothing but the one headlong impulse to get to the
library in the shortest possible space of time. Arrived at the
door, the impulse capriciously left her. She stopped on the mat,
wondering why she had hurried herself, with time to spare. Her
heart sank; the fever of her excitement changed suddenly to a
chill as she faced the closed door, and asked herself the
question, Dare I go in?
<P>
Her own hand answered her. She lifted it to turn the handle of
the lock. It dropped again helplessly at her side.
<P>
The sense of her own irresolution wrung from her a low
exclamation of despair. Faint as it was, it had apparently not
passed unheard. The door was opened from within--and Horace stood
before her.
<P>
He drew aside to let her pass into the room. But he never
followed her in. He stood in the doorway, and spoke to her,
keeping the door open with his hand.
<P>
"Do you mind waiting here for me?" he asked.
<P>
She looked at him, in vacant surprise, doubting whether she had
heard him aright.
<P>
"It will not be for long," he went on. "I am far too anxious to
hear what you have to tell me to submit to any needless delays.
The truth is, I have had a message from Lady Janet."
<P>
(From Lady Janet! What could Lady Janet want with him, at a time
when she was bent on composing herself in the retirement of her
own room?)
<P>
"I ought to have said two messages," Horace proceeded. "The first
was given to me on my way downstairs. Lady Janet wished to see me
immediately. I sent an excuse. A second message followed. Lady
Janet would accept no excuse. If I refused to go to her I should
be merely obliging her to come to me. It is impossible to risk
being interrupted in that way; my only alternative is to get the
thing over as soon as possible. Do you mind waiting?"
<P>
"Certainly not. Have you any idea of what Lady Janet wants with
you?"
<P>
"No. Whatever it is, she shall not keep me long away from you.
You will be quite alone here; I have warned the servants not to
show any one in." With those words he left her.
<P>
Mercy's first sensation was a sensation of relief--soon lost in a
feeling of shame at the weakness which could welcome any
temporary relief in such a position as hers. The emotion thus
roused merged, in its turn, into a sense of impatient regret.
"But for Lady Janet's message," she thought to herself, "I might
have known my fate by this time!"
<P>
The slow minutes followed each other drearily. She paced to and
fro in the library, faster and faster, under the intolerable
irritation, the maddening uncertainty, of her own suspense. Ere
long, even the spacious room seemed to be too small for her. The
sober monotony of the long book-lined shelves oppressed and
offended her. She threw open the door which led into the
dining-room, and dashed in, eager for a change of objects,
athirst for more space and more air.
<P>
At the first step she checked herself; rooted to the spot, under
a sudden revulsion of feeling which quieted her in an instant.
<P>
The room was only illuminated by the waning fire-light. A man was
obscurely visible, seated on the sofa, with his elbows on his
knees and his head resting on his hands. He looked up as the open
door let in the light from the library lamps. The mellow glow
reached his face and revealed Julian Gray.
<P>
Mercy was standing with her back to the light; her face being
necessarily hidden in deep shadow. He recognized her by her
figure, and by the attitude into which it unconsciously fell.
That unsought grace, that lithe long beauty of line, belonged to
but one woman in the house. He rose, and approached her.
<P>
"I have been wishing to see you," he said, "and hoping that
accident might bring about some such meeting as this."
<P>
He offered her a chair. Mercy hesitated before she took her seat.
This was their first meeting alone since Lady Janet had
interrupted her at the moment when she was about to confide to
Julian the melancholy story of the past. Was he anxious  to seize
the opportunity of returni ng to her confession? The terms in
which he had addressed her seemed to imply it. She put the
question to him in plain words
<P>
"I feel the deepest interest in hearing all that you have still
to confide to me," he answered. "But anxious as I may be, I will
not hurry you. I will wait, if you wish it."
<P>
"I am afraid I must own that I do wish it," Mercy rejoined. "Not
on my account--but because my time is at the disposal of Horace
Holmcroft. I expect to see him in a few minutes."
<P>
"Could you give me those few minutes?" Julian asked. "I have
something on my side to say to you which I think you ought to
know before you see any one--Horace himself included."
<P>
He spoke with a certain depression of tone which was not
associated with her previous experience of him. His face looked
prematurely old and careworn in the red light of the fire.
Something had plainly happened to sadden and to disappoint him
since they had last met.
<P>
"I willingly offer you all the time that I have at my own
command," Mercy replied. "Does what you have to tell me relate to
Lady Janet?"
<P>
He gave her no direct reply. "What I have to tell you of Lady
Janet," he said, gravely, "is soon told. So far as she is
concerned you have nothing more to dread. Lady Janet knows all."
<P>
Even the heavy weight of oppression caused by the impending
interview with Horace failed to hold its place in Mercy's mind
when Julian answered her in those words.
<P>
"Come into the lighted room," she said, faintly. "It is too
terrible to hear you say that in the dark."
<P>
Julian followed her into the library. Her limbs trembled under
her. She dropped into a chair, and shrank under his great bright
eyes, as he stood by her side looking sadly down on her.
<P>
"Lady Janet knows all!" she repeated, with her head on her
breast, and the tears falling slowly over her cheeks. "Have you
told her?"
<P>
"I have said nothing to Lady Janet or to any one. Your confidence
is a sacred confidence to me, until you have spoken first."
<P>
"Has Lady Janet said anything to you?"
<P>
"Not a word. She has looked at you with the vigilant eyes of
love; she has listened to you with the quick hearing of love--and
she has found her own way to the truth. She will not speak of it
to me-- she will not speak of it to any living creature. I only
know now how dearly she loved you. In spite of herself she clings
to you still. Her life, poor soul, has been a barren one;
unworthy, miserably unworthy, of such a nature as hers. Her
marriage was loveless and childless. She has had admirers, but
never, in the higher sense of the word, a friend. All the best
years of her life have been wasted in the unsatisfied longing for
something to love. At the end of her life You have filled the
void. Her heart has found its youth again, through You. At her
age--at any age--is such a tie as this to be rudely broken at the
mere bidding of circumstances? No! She will suffer anything, risk
anything, forgive anything, rather than own, even to herself,
that she has been deceived in you. There is more than her
happiness at stake; there is pride, a noble pride, in such love
as hers, which will ignore the plainest discovery and deny the
most unanswerable truth. I am firmly convinced--from my own
knowledge of her character, and from what I have observed in her
to-day--that she will find some excuse for refusing to hear your
confession. And more than that, I believe (if the exertion of her
influence can do it) that she will leave no means untried of
preventing you from acknowledging your true position here to any
living creature. I take a serious responsibility on myself in
telling you this--and I don't shrink from it. You ought to know,
and you shall know, what trials and what temptations may yet lie
before you."
<P>
He paused--leaving Mercy time to compose herself, if she wished
to speak to him.
<P>
She felt that there was a necessity for her speaking to him. He
was plainly not aware that Lady Janet had already written to her
to defer her promised explanation. This circumstance was in
itself a confirmation of the opinion which he had expressed. She
ought to mention it to him; she tried to mention it to him. But
she was not equal to the effort. The few simple words in which he
had touched on the tie that bound Lady Janet to her had wrung her
heart. Her tears choked her. She could only sign to him to go on.
<P>
"You may wonder at my speaking so positively," he continued,
"with nothing better than my own conviction to justify me. I can
only say that I have watched Lady Janet too closely to feel any
doubt. I saw the moment in which the truth flashed on her, as
plainly as I now see you. It did not disclose itself
gradually--it burst on her, as it burst on me. She suspected
nothing--she was frankly indignant at your sudden interference
and your strange language--until the time came in which you
pledged yourself to produce Mercy Merrick. Then (and then only)
the truth broke on her mind, trebly revealed to her in your
words, your voice, and your look. Then (and then only) I saw a
marked change come over her, and remain in her while she remained
in the room. I dread to think of what she may do in the first
reckless despair of the discovery that she has made. I
distrust--though God knows I am not naturally a suspicious
man--the most apparently trifling events that are now taking
place about us. You have held nobly to your resolution to own the
truth. Prepare yourself, before the evening is over, to be tried
and tempted again."
<P>
Mercy lifted her head. Fear took the place of grief in her eyes,
as they rested in startled inquiry on Julian's face.
<P>
"How is it possible that temptation can come to me now?" she
asked.
<P>
"I will leave it to events to answer that question," he said.
"You will not have long to wait. In the meantime I have put you
on your guard." He stooped, and spoke his next words earnestly,
close at her ear. "Hold fast by the admirable courage which you
have shown thus far," he went on. "Suffer anything rather than
suffer the degradation of yourself. Be the woman whom I once
spoke of--the woman I still have in my mind--who can nobly reveal
the noble nature that is in her. And never forget this-- my faith
in you is as firm as ever!"
<P>
She looked at him proudly and gratefully.
<P>
"I am pledged to justify your faith in me," she said. "I have put
it out of my own power to yield. Horace has my promise that I
will explain everything to him, in this room."
<P>
Julian started.
<P>
"Has Horace himself asked it of you?" he inquired. "_He_, at
least, has no suspicion of the truth."
<P>
"Horace has appealed to my duty to him as his betrothed wife,"
she answered. "He has the first claim to my confidence--he
resents my silence, and he has a right to resent it. Terrible as
it will be to open _his_ eyes to the truth, I must do it if he
asks me."
<P>
She was looking at Julian while she spoke. The old longing to
associate with the hard trial of the confession the one man who
had felt for her, and believed in her, revived under another
form. If she could only know, while she was saying the fatal
words to Horace, that Julian was listening too, she would be
encouraged to meet the worst that could happen! As the idea
crossed her mind, she observed that Julian was looking toward the
door through which they had lately passed. In an instant she saw
the means to her end. Hardly waiting to hear the few kind
expressions of sympathy and approval which he addressed to her,
she hinted timidly at the proposal which she had now to make to
him.
<P>
"Are you going back into the next room?" she asked.
<P>
"Not if you object to it," he replied.
<P>
"I don't object. I want you to be there."
<P>
"After Horace has joined you?"
<P>
"Yes. After Horace has joined me."
<P>
"Do you wish to see me when it is over?"
<P>
She summoned her resolution, and told him frankly what she had in
her mind.
<P>
"I want you to be near me while I am speaking to Horace," she
said. "It will give me courage if I can feel that I am speaking
to you as well as to him. I can count on _your_ sympathy--and
sympathy is so precious to me now! Am I asking too much, if I ask
you to leave the door unclosed when you go back to the
dining-room? Think of the dreadful trial--to him as well as to
me! I am only a
 woman; I am afraid I may sink under it, if I have no friend near
me. And I have no friend but you."
<P>
In those simple words she tried her powers of persuasion on him
for the first time.
<P>
Between perplexity and distress Julian was, for the moment, at a
loss how to answer her. The love for Mercy which he dared not
acknowledge was as vital a feeling in him as the faith in her
which he had been free to avow. To refuse anything that she asked
of him in her sore need--and, more even than that, to refuse to
hear the confession which it had been her first impulse to make
to _him_--these were cruel sacrifices to his sense of what was
due to Horace and of what was due to himself. But shrink as he
might, even from the appearance of deserting her, it was
impossible for him (except under a reserve which was almost
equivalent to a denial) to grant her request.
<P>
"All that I can do I will do," he said. "The doors shall be left
unclosed, and I will remain in the next room, on this condition,
that Horace knows of it as well as you. I should be unworthy of
your confidence in me if I consented to be a listener on any
other terms. You understand that, I am sure, as well as I do."
<P>
She had never thought of her proposal to him in this light.
Woman-like, she had thought of nothing but the comfort of having
him near her. She understood him now. A faint flush of shame rose
on her pale cheeks as she thanked him. He delicately relieved her
from her embarrassment by putting a question which naturally
occurred under the circumstances.
<P>
"Where is Horace all this time?" he asked. "Why is he not here?"
<P>
"He has been called away," she answered, "by a message from Lady
Janet."
<P>
The reply more than astonished Julian; it seemed almost to alarm
him. He returned to Mercy's chair; he said to her, eagerly, "Are
you sure?"
<P>
"Horace himself told me that Lady Janet had insisted on seeing
him."
<P>
"When?"
<P>
"Not long ago. He asked me to wait for him here while he went
upstairs."
<P>
Julian's face darkened ominously.
<P>
"This confirms my worst fears," he said. "Have _you_ had any
communication with Lady Janet?"
<P>
Mercy replied by showing him his aunt's note. He read it
carefully through.
<P>
"Did I not tell you," he said, "that she would find some excuse
for refusing to hear your confession? She begins by delaying it,
simply to gain time for something else which she has it in her
mind to do. When did you receive this note? Soon after you went
upstairs?"
<P>
"About a quarter of an hour after, as well as I can guess."
<P>
"Do you know what happened down here after you left us?"
<P>
"Horace told me that Lady Janet had offered Miss Roseberry the
use of her boudoir."
<P>
"Any more?"
<P>
"He said that you had shown her the way to the room."
<P>
"Did he tell you what happened after that?"
<P>
"No."
<P>
"Then I must tell you. If I can do nothing more in this serious
state of things, I can at least prevent your being taken by
surprise. In the first place, it is right you should know that I
had a motive for accompanying Miss Roseberry to the boudoir. I
was anxious (for your sake) to make some appeal to her better
self--if she had any better self to address. I own I had doubts
of my success--judging by what I had already seen of her. My
doubts were confirmed. In the ordinary intercourse of life I
should merely have thought her a commonplace, uninteresting
woman. Seeing her as I saw her while we were alone--in other
words, penetrating below the surface--I have never, in all my sad
experience, met with such a hopelessly narrow, mean, and low
nature as hers. Understanding, as she could not fail to do, what
the sudden change in Lady Janet's behavior toward her really
meant, her one idea was to take the cruelest possible advantage
of it. So far from feeling any consideration for _you_, she was
only additionally imbittered toward you. She protested against
your being permitted to claim the merit of placing her in her
right position here by your own voluntary avowal of the truth.
She insisted on publicly denouncing you, and on forcing Lady
Janet to dismiss you, unheard, before the whole household! 'Now I
can have my revenge! At last Lady Janet is afraid of me!' Those
were her own words--I am almost ashamed to repeat them--those, on
my honor, were her own words! Every possible humiliation to be
heaped on you; no consideration to be shown for Lady Janet's age
and Lady Janet's position; nothing, absolutely nothing, to be
allowed to interfere with Miss Roseberry's vengeance and Miss
Roseberry's triumph! There is this woman's shameless view of what
is due to her, as stated by herself in the plainest terms. I kept
my temper; I did all I could to bring her to a better frame of
mind. I might as well have pleaded--I won't say with a savage;
savages are sometimes accessible to remonstrance, if you know how
to reach them--I might as well have pleaded with a hungry animal
to abstain from eating while food was within its reach. I had
just given up the hopeless effort in disgust, when Lady Janet's
maid appeared with a message for Miss Roseberry from her
mistress: 'My lady's compliments, ma'am, and she will be glad to
see you at your earliest convenience, in her room.'"
<P>
Another surprise! Grace Roseberry invited to an interview with
Lady Janet! It would have been impossible to believe it, if
Julian had not heard the invitation given with his own ears.
<P>
"She instantly rose," Julian proceeded. "'I won't keep her
ladyship waiting a moment,' she said; 'show me the way.' She
signed to the maid to go out of the room first, and then turned
round and spoke to me from the door. I despair of describing the
insolent exultation of her manner. I can only repeat her words:
'This is exactly what I wanted! I had intended to insist on
seeing Lady Janet: she saves me the trouble. I am infinitely
obliged to her.' With that she nodded to me, and closed the door.
I have not seen her, I have not heard of her, since. For all I
know, she may be still with my aunt, and Horace may have found
her there when he entered the room."
<P>
"What can Lady Janet have to say to her?" Mercy asked, eagerly.
<P>
"It is impossible even to guess. When you found me in the
dining-room I was considering that very question. I cannot
imagine that any neutral ground can exist on which it is possible
for Lady Janet and this woman to meet. In her present frame of
mind she will in all probability insult Lady Janet before she has
been five minutes in the room. I own I am completely puzzled. The
one conclusion I can arrive at is that the note which my aunt
sent to you, the private interview with Miss Roseberry which has
followed, and the summons to Horace which has succeeded in its
turn, are all links in the same chain of events, and are all
tending to that renewed temptation against which I have already
warned you."
<P>
Mercy held up her hand for silence. She looked toward the door
that opened on the hall; had she heard a footstep outside? No.
All was still. Not a sign yet of Horace's return.
<P>
"Oh!" she exclaimed, "what would I not give to know what is going
on upstairs!"
<P>
"You will soon know it now," said Julian. "It is impossible that
our present uncertainty can last much longer."
<P>
He turned away, intending to go back to the room in which she had
found him. Looking at her situation from a man's point of view,
he naturally assumed that the best service he could now render to
Mercy would be to leave her to prepare herself for the interview
with Horace. Before he had taken three steps away from her she
showed him the difference between the woman's point of view and
the man's. The idea of considering beforehand what she should say
never entered her mind. In her horror of being left by herself at
that critical moment, she forgot every other consideration. Even
the warning remembrance of Horace's jealous distrust of Julian
passed away from her, for the moment, as completely as if it
never had a place in her memory. "Don't leave me!" she cried. "I
can't wait here alone. Come back--come back!"
<P>
She rose impulsively while she spoke, as if to follow him into
the dining-room, if he persisted in leaving her.
<P>
A momentary expression of doubt crossed Julian's face as he
retraced his steps and signed to her to be seated a gain. Could
she be depended on (he asked himself) to sustain the coming test
of her resolution, when she had not courage enough to wait for
events in a room by herself? Julian had yet to learn that a
woman's courage rises with the greatness of the emergency. Ask
her to accompany you through a field in which some harmless
cattle happen to be grazing, and it is doubtful, in nine cases
out of ten, if she will do it. Ask her, as one of the passengers
in a ship on fire, to help in setting an example of composure to
the rest, and it is certain, in nine cases out of ten, that she
will do it. As soon as Julian had taken a chair near her, Mercy
was calm again.
<P>
"Are you sure of your resolution?" he asked.
<P>
"I am certain of it," she answered, "as long as you don't leave
me by myself."
<P>
The talk between them dropped there. They sat together in
silence, with their eyes fixed on the door, waiting for Horace to
come in.
<P>
After the lapse of a few minutes their attention was attracted by
a sound outside in the grounds. A carriage of some sort was
plainly audible approaching the house.
<P>
The carriage stopped; the bell rang; the front door was opened.
Had a visitor arrived? No voice could be heard making inquiries.
No footsteps but the servant's footsteps crossed the hall. Along
pause followed, the carriage remaining at the door. Instead of
bringing some one to the house, it had apparently arrived to take
some one away.
<P>
The next event was the return of the servant to the front door.
They listened again. Again no second footstep was audible. The
door was closed; the servant recrossed the hall; the carriage was
driven away. Judging by sounds alone, no one had arrived at the
house, and no one had left the house.
<P>
Julian looked at Mercy. "Do you understand this?" he asked.
<P>
She silently shook her head.
<P>
"If any person has gone away in the carriage," Julian went on,
"that person can hardly have been a man, or we must have heard
him in the hall."
<P>
The conclusion which her companion had just drawn from the
noiseless departure of the supposed visitor raised a sudden doubt
in Mercy's mind.
<P>
"Go and inquire!" she said, eagerly.
<P>
Julian left the room, and returned again, after a brief absence,
with signs of grave anxiety in his face and manner.
<P>
"I told you I dreaded the most trifling events that were passing
about us," he said. "An event, which is far from being trifling,
has just happened. The carriage which we heard approaching along
the drive turns out to have been a cab sent for from the house.
The person who has gone away in it--"
<P>
"Is a woman, as you supposed?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
Mercy rose excitedly from her chair.
<P>
"It can't be Grace Roseberry?" she exclaimed.
<P>
"It _is_ Grace Roseberry."
<P>
"Has she gone away alone?"
<P>
"Alone--after an interview with Lady Janet."
<P>
"Did she go willingly?"
<P>
"She herself sent the servant for the cab."
<P>
"What does it mean?"
<P>
"It is useless to inquire. We shall soon know."
<P>
They resumed their seats, waiting, as they had waited already,
with their eyes on the library door.
