<p>One thing attracted the notice and pleased our friends, and gave
them a hope of being able to supply a want they had felt every
moment since landing upon the California coast. Each of the miners
had two rifles, and were abundantly supplied with ammunition and
mining tools. The wonder was how they could carry so heavy a load
for such a distance. It could not be understood until Ned Trimble
stated that they had two good, tough mules pasturing in a secluded
place about a half-mile distant.</p>

<p>"That 'ere Injin blanket you're carryin' is rather pretty!" remarked
Ned as he rubbed his greasy fingers through his hair.</p>

<p>"Yes, we got it of an Indian girl, and take great pride in it."</p>

<p>"You did, eh? What did you give her for it?"</p>

<p>"A gold watch."</p>

<p>"Ah! Well, if the watch was a first-rate one maybe she got her
pay; but what did she want with a watch? That's just the way with
all women. They'll give ten times the value for some little gewgaw
to wear about 'em. I was engaged to a fine-looking girl in North
Carolina, but I seen she was getting so extravagant that I couldn't
understand it, so I left before it was too late."</p>

<p>"A very wise plan."</p>

<p>"Yes, she was very extravagant."</p>

<p>"In what respect?" asked Elwood, who was quite amused at their
newly-found friend.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, she would persist in wearing shoes on Sunday
instead of going barefoot like the rest of the young ladies. I
warned her two or three times, but I catched her at church one
day with them on, and so I went over to the house that night and
told her I couldn't trust her any longer, and we exchanged presents
and parted."</p>

<p>"Exchanged presents?" laughed Wakeman. "What sort of presents
were they?"</p>

<p>"I wish no trifling insinuations, sir," replied Ned, with a grandiloquent
air. "She returned to me a tooth brush that I had presented her
some months before, and I gave back to her a tin button that she
had bought of a traveling peddler, and that I had been wearing
on Sundays for my breastpin. 'Tis not the intrinsic worth you
know, but the associations connected with such things that makes
'em dear. But it is a painful subject, gentlemen, and let us,
therefore, dismiss it."</p>

<p>Howard and Lawrence thought it best to introduce the matter upon
which they had been so long meditating.</p>

<p>"I notice that each of you have two guns apiece. Did you leave
San Francisco with that supply?"</p>

<p>"No; we've got 'em of the redskins we've run agin on the way."</p>

<p>"Would you be willing to sell us a couple? You observe we have
but one between us, and it makes it rather dangerous, as none
of us are very skillful in the use of the rifle."</p>

<p>"You needn't take the trouble to tell us that," replied Ned,
with a quizzical look. "I'd like to accommodate you, but we had
begun to think that we needed three or four guns apiece; for,
you see, we intend to stay in these parts some time, and we are
sure to have trouble with the redskins."</p>

<p>"If you really wish them," remarked Elwood, "of course we cannot
ask you to part with them."</p>

<p>"What'll you give?" abruptly asked Ned.</p>

<p>"What will you take?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't sell you both of mine, as I wouldn't have one; but,
Wakeman, if I part with one of mine will you do the same?"</p>

<p>"Yes; for I know they'll need the arms before they get back to
San Francisco."</p>

<p>"Then the question is, what will you ask us for the two guns?"</p>

<p>"Can you give us a hundred dollars?"</p>

<p>"Apiece?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no; for both of 'em."</p>

<p>"Yes; we will gladly do that."</p>

<p>Now came the crisis. The party had not a dozen dollars among
them. Howard and Elwood had left their money in the berth of the
steamer, and of course it was irrevocably gone. But Elwood's watch
remained, and that at the least calculation was worth one hundred
and fifty; but whether the miners would accept it at a fair valuation
for their pieces, was in their minds very doubtful.</p>

<p>"We have no money," said Howard, "but my cousin has a watch that
is worth more than that sum, which he will give you for the two
guns."</p>

<p>"Let's see it."</p>

<p>It was produced and passed around the company. Ned opened and
shut it, and shook it and placed it to his ear.</p>

<p>"It ain't running," he suddenly said.</p>

<p>"No; the salt water has stopped it, but I do not think it is
really injured. A little cleaning will speedily set it going."</p>

<p>Ned passed the time-piece back again.</p>

<p>"Don't want it; it won't do us no good."</p>

<p>"But you are hunting for gold, and there is enough in it to make
it worth your while to take it."</p>

<p>"We expect to find all the gold we can carry back with us without
loading our mules down with gold watches."</p>

<p>Elwood replaced the watch in his pocket, disheartened at the
failure of his offer.</p>

<p>"We have no money; if you will call at my father's the next time
you go to San Francisco, he will gladly give you your price."</p>

<p>"Don't know as we shall go to San Francisco for the next five
years; shan't go any way until we are loaded down with gold, and
then we won't care about calling on your father&mdash;more likely he'll
want to call on us."</p>

<p>An idea struck Howard.</p>

<p>"You are pleased with our blanket. Will you exchange your guns
for that?"</p>

<p>Ned shook his head.</p>

<p>"Got all the blankets we want; don't want it; keep it yourself."</p>

<p>"Will you not give us one gun for both the blanket and watch?"</p>

<p>The miner now laughed, and shook his head again.</p>

<p>"Don't want either; can't do it."</p>

<p>The boys now despaired.</p>

<p>"Well, we may as well give up. We can't get any guns of you."</p>

<p>"What is the reason you can't?"</p>

<p>"You seem unwilling to trade, and we can not buy them."</p>

<p>"Of course you can't; but&#11834;"</p>

<p>And thereupon the miner rose to his feet and handed one gun to
Elwood and the other to Howard.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" asked the latter, not comprehending him.</p>

<p>"You don't suppose we would be <em>mean</em> enough to <em>sell</em>
you anything you needed so bad, do you? No; take them both, and
here's a lot of lead, gun-caps and ammunition."</p>

<p>"But&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No <em>buts</em> about it. Take 'em, you're welcome, for you
need 'em. I was only joking with you."</p>
