<p>It can scarcely be said that either of the fugitives had any
definite hope of escape, for neither was able to see how the thing
was possible. Mickey knew that occasionally, in the affairs of
the world, seemingly providential interferences had occurred,
but he looked for nothing of the kind. He considered that there
would be a siege, lasting perhaps several days, then a desperate
hand-to-hand struggle, and then.</p>

<p>The summary manner in which the Irishman disposed of the first
Apache who showed himself brought matters to a standstill. In
this condition they probably would have remained but for the Irishman
himself, who saw nothing to be gained by inaction. Turning his
head, he whispered to Fred:</p>

<p>"Do ye kape quiet, me laddy, till my return. I am going to take
a look around."</p>

<p>The boy offered no objection, for he knew it would not be heeded,
and Mickey moved away. It required the greatest care to pick his
way down the fissure, as the stones and gravel were liable to
turn under his feet and betray his approach, and it was much easier
to go forward than backward.</p>

<p>The fissure which had afforded this temporary refuge was about
fifty feet in length, and the vegetation was so thick that at
almost any portion the view was no greater than three or four
yards. Mickey was in constant expectation of encountering some
of the Apaches at every step he took, and, in accordance with
his principle of hitting a head wherever he saw it, he held his
rifle so as to fire on the very instant the coppery face presented
itself to view. But he saw none, and as he advanced he began to
believe that the place was entirely free of the Apaches, who,
if prudent, would quietly wait on the outside until their prey
dropped into their hands.</p>

<p>It was not to be supposed that they would leave any opening on
the outside by which the most forlorn chance could be obtained,
and Mickey had no thought of any such thing. If he had, it would
have been dissipated by the evidence of his own ears. He could
hear distinctly their peculiar grunting voices, the tramp of their
mustangs, and the evidence which a score of Indian warriors might
be expected to give of their presence, when they had no reason
for concealment.</p>

<p>"It may be that the spalpeens mean to make a rush upon me," he
muttered, as he halted near the end of the fissure, "in which
case I shall have a delightful employment in cracking their pates
as they come up and take their turn."</p>

<p>He remained where he was a few minutes longer, and, seeing no
prospect of learning anything additional, he resumed his advance
until he reached a point where it was only necessary to draw the
branches slightly apart to gain a view of the main ravine. And
this he proceeded to do in the gentlest and most cautious manner
possible.</p>

<p>The view was satisfactory, as it showed him that the Apaches
were gathered at the entrance to the fissure and were taking matters
very coolly and philosophically. Several were on horses, and a
number on foot. Among the mustangs moving about, the Irishman
recognized his own, astride of which was a dirty-looking Apache,
with a wide mouth and broken nose.</p>

<p>"Ye ould spalpeen," muttered the indignant Irishman, "if it wasn't
for fear of spoiling your wonderful booty, I'd turn you somersets
off that hoss of mine, which I shall have to whitewash after getting
him back, on account of your contact wid the same."</p>

<p>Mickey was strongly tempted to send a bullet after the tantalizing
horse-thief, but he thought he could wait awhile. He was extremely
cautious in making his stealthy view, only moving enough leaves
to permit the service of his eyes and he had not enjoyed this
prospect long before he believed that he had been detected.</p>

<p>Of the twenty-odd members comprising the Apache party, about
a dozen were constantly in view, the others being too far to the
right or left to be seen. The group was an irregular and straggling
one, the most interesting portion being five or six, who stood
close together, exactly at the base of the fissure, talking with
each other. It was impossible that there should be more than one
subject of discussion; and the dispute, as Mickey suspected, was
as to the precise method of disposing of the job which had been
placed in their hands.</p>

<p>Some, evidently, favored a daring charge directly up the narrow
ravine, with its short, fierce encounter and sure victory. Others
had a different plan, and their gestures led the eavesdropper
to suspect that they advocated reaching them from the roof, while
it was apparent that there were those who insisted upon waiting
until the fruit should become ripe enough to fall into their laps
without shaking. There could be little doubt that the Apaches
preferred to take both prisoners, instead of shooting or tomahawking
them in a fight. They were under the inspiration of Lone Wolf,
who believed that a live man was much more valuable than a dead
one.</p>

<p>While Mickey was watching this group with an interest which may
be imagined, he noticed that a short, thick, greasy, filthy warrior
was looking directly toward him, with a steadiness which caused
the Irishman to suspect that his presence was known. The Indian,
like all of them, was as homely as he could be. He, too, had gone
through an attack of smallpox, which had left his broad face so
deeply pitted that it could be noticed through the vari-colored
paint which was daubed thereon. There was scarcely any forehead,
the black, piercing eyes were far apart, and when Mickey saw them
turned toward him, he felt anything but comfortable under their
fire.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether he would keep mum if I should tip him the wink?"
thought Mickey, who suffered the leaves in front of his face to
close until there was just the smallest space through which he
could watch his man.</p>

<p>The latter acted very much as if he suspected the proximity of
the Irishman, even if he was not assured of it. He continued looking
directly at the point where the eyes of the white man peered out
upon him, and by-and-by he raised his arm and pointed in the same
direction, saying something at the same time to a couple of the
warriors near him.</p>

<p>"Be the powers, if that doesn't mane <em>me</em>, as me friend
Larry O'Toole said when the judge axed for the biggest rascal
in coort. I'll have to retire."</p>

<p>At this juncture a strange occurrence took place. Mickey O'Rooney
was looking straight at the man, when he saw him fling up his
arms, yell and pitch forward to the ground, while the group instantly
scattered, as if a bombshell had dropped at their feet.</p>

<p>Just a second previous to this strange death, Mickey heard the
report of a rifle, showing that the warrior had been shot by some
one at quite a distance from the spot, which shot, at the game
time, caused a temporary panic among the others.</p>

<p>"Well, well, now, if that doesn't bate everything!" exclaimed
the amazed Irishman. "Just as I was thinking of raising my gun
to give that spalpeen his walking-papers, up steps some gintleman
and saves me the trouble; <em>but who was the gintleman</em>?
is the question."</p>

<p>The inexplicable occurrence naturally recalled Fred Munson's
adventure with the grizzly bear. When he needed assistance most
sorely, the shot was fired that saved his life. Could it be that
the same party had interfered in the present instance? There was
plenty of ground for speculation, and the Irishman was disposed
to believe that the diversion came from some small party of Kiowas
or Comanches, who had a special enmity against this company of
Apaches, and who, being too weak to attack them, took this means
of revenging themselves.</p>

<p>It was unsafe, however, to count upon the well-aimed shot as
meant in the interest of the whites, although the one that brought
down the grizzly bear could not have been meant for anything else
than a direct help to the imperiled lad. The Southwest has been
noted for what are termed "triangular fights." A party of Americans
have been driven at bay by an overwhelming number of Mexicans
or greasers, who have suddenly found themselves attacked by a
party of howling Comanches. The latter have scattered the Mexicans
like chaff, the Americans acting the part of spectators until
the rout was complete, when the Comanches turned about and sailed
into the Americans. The Kiowas, Comanches, Apaches, Mexicans and
Americans afforded just the elements for a complication of guerilla
warfare, in which matters frequently became mixed to a wonderful
degree.</p>

<p>The hand that had fired this shot against a mortal foe of Mickey
O'Rooney might be turned against him the next hour. Who could
tell?</p>

<p>"If that gintleman begins the serenade from the other side, it's
me bounden duty to kaap it up from this," concluded the Irishman,
as he cocked his rifle and awaited his chance.</p>

<p>It was not long in coming. Only a few minutes had passed after
the shot, when a couple of Apaches walked rapidly to view, and,
approaching the remains of their comrade, stooped down to carry
him away.</p>

<p>Mickey allowed them to get fairly started, when he blazed away
at the foremost, and had the satisfaction of seeing the rear Apache
not only deprived of his assistance, but his duty suddenly doubled.
The warrior, however, stuck pluckily to the work, and dragged
both out of view without any assistance from those who were ready
to rush to his help.</p>

<p>These two, or rather three, rifle shots produced the strongest
kind of effect upon the Apaches. They could not well fail to do
so, for they were not only fired with unerring aim, but they came
from such diverse points as to show the redskins that instead
of having their enemies cooped up in this narrow ravine, they
had, in one sense, placed themselves between two fires.</p>

<p>Hurriedly reloading his rifle, Mickey waited several minutes,
determined to fire the instant he got the chance, with the purpose
of enhancing the demoralization of the wretches. But they had
received enough to teach them caution, and as the minutes passed,
they failed to expose themselves. They had taken to shelter somewhere,
and were not yet ready to uncover.</p>

<p>"When Mickey had waited a considerable time, he concluded to
rejoin Fred Munson, who, no doubt, was anxious over the result
of his reconnoissance. When he returned he found him seated upon
the boulder, instead of behind it. The Irishman hastily explained
what had taken place, and added:</p>

<p>"I don't know what they will do next, but we've give the spalpeens
a dose that will kaap them in the background for a while."</p>

<p>"No, it won't, either," was the significant response.</p>

<p>"What do you maan, me laddy?"</p>

<p>"I mean that the Apaches, or some of them, anyway, have changed
their base. I've heard something overhead that makes me sure they're
up there, getting up some kind of deviltry."</p>
