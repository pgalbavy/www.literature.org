<p>The Indian was doing his best. Had the whole tribe been assembled
on that clearing, with eyes fixed on him and urging him on, he
could have done no better. He had run many a race, and, since
his manhood, had won them all. Most were gained by no more than
half trying, just as he expected to gain this one when he ordered
his companions to remain behind in the wood, and leave to him
the task of bringing back the white youth who had the effrontery
to appear as a contestant in a trial against him.</p>

<p>The expectation of Blazing Arrow was that of running down Wharton
Edwards just before or at the time he entered the wood on the
opposite side of the clearing. Stretching forward his massive
hand, he meant to hurl him from his feet, and then drive him back
to where the other warriors were waiting to subject him to their
whimsical torture.</p>

<p>Yes, Wharton Edwards was destined, in Blazing Arrow's mind, for
the torture. This had been the fierce savage's purpose from the
outset, and it remained as such for a few moments after the two
had burst into the opening. Then a doubt arose, and by the time
half the clearing was thrown behind him the despised youth in
front was running faster than he was.</p>

<p>The soul of Blazing Arrow must have been humiliated beyond expression
when, despite the most strenuous exertions he could put forth,
and the knowledge that never in all his life had he run with greater
speed, that lithe, graceful youth in front began steadily drawing
away from him.</p>

<p>It was an astounding truth. Wharton Edwards could outrun the
champion of the Shawanoes, and he was doing it with such certainty
that neither he nor his pursuer could fail to see the fact.</p>

<p>The youth waited till a fourth of the distance was passed, so
there could be no mistake as to the actual test. He had gone that
far with all the strength of which he was capable. He knew that
his pursuer had done the same, so that when he glanced around,
the truth as to their relative speed must be established.</p>

<p>The result was more striking than he had dared to hope. He had
widened perceptibly the space between them, and was still doing
so, even though his venomous enemy was putting forth the utmost
exertions of which he was capable.</p>

<p>It can be understood how the discovery thrilled the fugitive,
and he can be pardoned if, even in that trying moment, he felt
a touch of regret that the race between him and the Indian did
not take place, as it was arranged, at the settlement. What a
triumph he would have won!</p>

<p>Nor can he be blamed because in the flush of victory, and with
the belief that the real danger was past, he deliberately snatched
off his cap, swung it above his head, and uttered a shout of exultation.
It was only human nature, and you or I would have done the same
had we been in his place.</p>

<p>The cry was wormwood and gall to Blazing Arrow, and deep must
have been his regret that at the time when, seized with drunken
frenzy, he made for the lad, he did not finish him. Had he done
so, the Shawanoe would have been saved this humiliation.</p>

<p>Why did not the pursuer stop short and bring his rifle into play?
He was a good marksman, and the distance was not enough to require
any special skill on his part. Doubtless the dusky miscreant was
influenced by several reasons, one of which was the loss of ground
he would sustain. Then, too, a man who has been using his muscles
so fiercely is not in the best condition to aim a rifle accurately.
Furthermore, it is not impossible that the Shawanoe believed that
the youth was unable to maintain his astounding speed. He must
soon slacken it, and then the Indian champion would take revenge
for this temporary defeat. Wharton feared an attempt to shoot
him, and he continued his prodigious exertion, since there was
every inducement to increase the gain he had made, and the sheltering
wood was now but a short way in advance. He glanced back a couple
of times, and then threw his thoughts forward, for he recalled
that he was confronted by a peculiar condition of things.</p>

<p>Immediately after entering the forest again, the trail made what
may be described as a horseshoe curve. A deep, wooded ravine interposing
in front necessitated a looping of the path. The circuit was a
furlong in length, the trail coming back to within a few rods
of the first turn. Standing at this point, one could see the slightly
ascending course on the side of the narrow ravine, and a man or
animal walking up the gentle incline was in view of any one at
the beginning of the curve.</p>

<p>It will be understood, therefore, that if Blazing Arrow should
halt at this point the instant he reached it, and the youth should
keep to the trail, the latter would come directly under the muzzle
of his own rifle, in the hands of his implacable enemy.</p>

<p>But Wharton Edwards was not the one to throw away an advantage
gained by a display of speed such as it is safe to say no other
living person could have made. It would have been idiotic to do
so when no necessity existed.</p>

<p>Several ways of escape presented themselves. He could leave the
trail at the lower point of the loop, not returning to it until
well beyond sight of his enemy, or possibly he could leap across
the gorge, as he had done in the case of the torrent, and thus
not sacrifice any ground.</p>

<p>It was this step which he revolved in his mind while dashing
across the last fourth of the narrow plain, but a single fact
restrained him; he doubted his ability to make a successful leap.
Although he had been over the path several times, and might be
considered familiar with it, he had never studied it closely enough
to settle the question without another inspection, and there was
not a minute to spare for making that.</p>

<p>If he could make the leap it would be a great gain; if he should
fail, the disaster would be irreparable, for among the wood, brush
and undergrowth he could neither conceal himself nor travel as
fast as the Shawanoe, who would quickly have him at his mercy.
The risk was too great to incur, and he decided not to take it.
He did a thing, on the contrary, which was like an inspiration.
Making the short turn, he ran a few rods, when he glanced toward
the plain. Blazing Arrow was invisible, and would remain so for
several minutes, despite the speed with which he was approaching.</p>

<p>The youth made a powerful leap aside from the path, and dodged
behind the trunk of an oak large enough to shelter his body. Then
he stood panting, alert and watchful, awaiting the coming of his
enemy. He saw him a minute later, through the trees, running with
undiminished speed, and like an engine that was absolutely tireless.
The Shawanoe was more familiar with the course of the trail than
the youth, and therefore knew of its looping, which had puzzled
the latter for a few brief moments. The course adopted by the
Shawanoe was peculiar, and for a time assumed an almost ludicrous
phase.</p>

<p>The quick glance which he cast down the path failed to show him
the fugitive, who he must have supposed was still running over
it and would speedily reappear as he rushed up the incline. By
leaping the ravine he would head him off and have him at his mercy.</p>

<p>The pursuer decided to adopt this course, and with only a slight
slackening of pace he dashed toward the gorge; but when almost
on the brink he must have concluded the chances of success were
against him, and he changed his mind. But he did not succeed in
changing the course of his body, as he meant to do. He would not
have failed had the bank of the ravine been as firm as he supposed
it was. He checked himself with the skill of an experienced runner;
but the ground gave way, and despite everything he could do he
went floundering, scrambling and struggling to the bottom of the
ravine, which was almost perpendicular and fully thirty feet deep.</p>

<p>Had he given less attention to the effort to save himself and
looked where he was going it would have been better; for, as it
was, although the fall was considerable, it was so broken that
it would have amounted to little had not his head come in collision
with the base of one of the trees growing in the bottom of the
gorge. The impact was violent, and must have jarred the tree.
It jarred Blazing Arrow to that extent that he tumbled over on
his back senseless.</p>

<p>Wharton Edwards was watching matters like a cat waiting for a
mouse. When he saw the Shawanoe disappearing he ran cautiously
forward from his hiding-place, and, not forgetting to screen himself,
peeped over the edge of the ravine.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he hasn't broken his neck," he muttered, as he noted
the shock the other had received, "though that crack against the
trunk of the tree was enough to kill anyone."</p>

<p>This unlooked-for incident insured the safety of the fugitive,
who, if he chose, could have continued his flight to the block-house;
but two considerations led him to take a different course. He
could not desert Larry Murphy, who, beyond all question, was in
imminent peril, and he disliked beyond expression to lose his
rifle, which was a birthday gift from his father, and a superior
piece of workmanship. It was this act that led him to attempt
a feat worthy of Simon Kenton himself.</p>

<p>Leaping lightly from the edge of the ravine, he grasped the branches
of a tree near at hand. It bent low with his weight and broke;
but he seized another, and that also, after dipping downward,
gave way and let him fall. By that time he was so near the ground
that he dropped lightly to his feet. He paused and glanced at
Blazing Arrow lying outstretched on his back, with his face upturned,
as if he were dead. But he was not; he was only senseless.</p>

<p>"If he will only stay that way for a few minutes I shall be all
right; but if he awakes&#11834;"</p>

<p>Aye, if he awoke, what vengeance he would take on the youth who
dared not only to beat him at running, but to steal like a beast
of prey upon him!</p>

<p>But young Edwards had determined upon his line of action, and
it was now too late to turn back.</p>
