<p>A long, low bridge connects the western projection of Westport
with Woolwich on the opposite bank, beyond which spreads Montsweag
Bay, narrowing to Back River, which, as has been explained, joins
the Sheepscot.</p>

<p>The draw had just been swung open when our friends came in sight
of the bridge, and saw the <em>Water Witch</em> passing through.
The bridge tender immediately began turning his lever with which
he closed the draw. Alvin whistled to signify that he wished to
follow the other, but seemingly the man did not hear him. His
back steadily rose and fell, as he worked the handle of his contrivance,
and the movable section of the structure slowly swung back in
response.</p>

<p>"Isn't that lucky now!" was the sarcastic exclamation of Mike.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Chester.</p>

<p>"He wants to hilp ye fall back further behind the ither boat."</p>

<p>"There may be something in that," the Captain replied.</p>

<p>None the less, Alvin continued his tooting, without abating his
speed. The tender, however, did not mean to tantalize them, and
all quickly saw the cause of his action. A heavily loaded wagon
had come upon the bridge from the Woolwich side, and waited while
the draw was held open. The driver must have had a "pull" with
the attendant, who immediately closed the draw so he could cross
before the second boat passed through.</p>

<p>At this juncture fate showed how perverse she can be when in
the mood. Directly over the draw, something connected with the
wagon or the harness of the team got askew and the driver paused
to set it right. Possibly it was pretence on his part, for many
men will do such things, but, all the same, he took ten minutes
before he climbed back on his seat and started his horses forward
again. Alvin reversed the screw, so that the launch became motionless
when a few yards from the bridge.</p>

<p>I am afraid the driver purposely delayed the <em>Deerfoot</em>,
for when Mike shouted an angry reproach, he looked around, put
his thumb to his nose, twiddled his fingers, and then moved slowly
over the rattling planks toward Westport.</p>

<p>"I suggist that ye turn about, Captain, and scoot for home,"
was the ironical advice of the Irish youth.</p>

<p>"For what reason?"</p>

<p>"I'm afeard that man is real mad and he might take it into his
head to git down off his wagon and saize aich of us by the nape
of the neck as the boat goes through, and slam us down so hard
he'd jar us."</p>

<p>"Better wait, Captain, till he's a little farther off," advised
Calvert; "there may be something in what Michael says."</p>

<p>As for Mike, feeling he could not do justice to the subject,
he held his peace for the moment.</p>

<p>Gliding through the draw and entering Montsweag Bay, the occupants
of the <em>Deerfoot</em> were surprised to see nothing of the
other launch. She was as invisible as if she had been scuttled
and sunk in fifty feet of water.</p>

<p>The right shore above the structure, belonging to Westport, slopes
to the right, and something like a half mile above, this course
is at right angles to the stream. It is really a peninsula, there
being an inlet more than a mile long which divides it from the
rest of Westport. This little bay is spanned by a bridge which
forms a part of the highway that passes over the longer structure
already referred to.</p>

<p>When Mike found the <em>Water Witch</em> had vanished, he pretended
to be vastly relieved. He had dropped into his chair and now straightened
up.</p>

<p>"But ain't we lucky?"</p>

<p>"Why so?" asked Calvert.</p>

<p>"If we hadn't been stopped at the bridge the ither boat might
have broke down and we'd come up wid the same, and those chaps
would have give us all a good spanking."</p>

<p>"I am glad you are becoming so prudent," said Calvert, with an
approving nod. "We must take Michael with us whenever we are likely
to run into danger. Captain, if you don't mind, you might tune
up your boat a bit."</p>

<p>"Better wait," suggested Mike, "fur ye might gain on t'other
one."</p>

<p>Alvin now put on the highest speed of which the <em>Deerfoot</em>
was capable. The bow rose, the stern settled down in the water,
and the spray was flung high and splashed against the wind-shield.
The exhaust deepened to a steady roar, and the broadening wake
was churned into a mass of tumbling soapy foam. The whole boat
shivered with the vibration of the powerful engine. She was going
more than twenty miles an hour&mdash;in fact, must have approached
her limit, which was four miles faster. Alvin had attained such
a tremendous pace only a few times in his practice and did not
like it. Though his instructor had assured him that the launch
was capable of holding it indefinitely without injury, he feared
a breakdown or the unnecessary wear upon many parts of the engine.</p>

<p>He kept up the furious speed until they curved around the upper
part of the peninsula and saw the expansion above, all the way
to Long Ledge, where Back River begins. He had been confident
of catching sight of the <em>Water Witch</em>, but she was nowhere
in sight.</p>

<p>The natural conclusion was that the launch had taken on a higher
burst of speed&mdash;probably the limit&mdash;and gone so far that by still
keeping near the shore she had placed several miles behind her&mdash;enough
to carry her out of the field of vision.</p>

<p>"Keep it up till we catch sight of her again," suggested Calvert.
"I believe there are no more bridges between us and Wiscasset."</p>

<p>Some three or four miles were passed at high speed, when they
reached a portion of the river which opened a view of still greater
extent. They saw two small sailboats at a distance, and a little
steamer puffing northward, but nothing of the <em>Water Witch</em>.</p>

<p>"You may as well slow down," remarked the detective, who, guarding
a match with his hands behind the wind-shield, proceeded to light
another cigar.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?" asked Alvin, turning his head, as the
pace became slower than before.</p>

<p>"We have passed the other boat; she is behind us instead of in
front."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"For hiven's sake don't go back," protested Mike. "Ye might find
her&mdash;and then what would become of ye?"</p>

<p>The detective now gave his view of the situation.</p>

<p>"If we should turn round and find that boat, those on board would
know we were looking for them. We don't wish to give that impression,
at least for some time to come. While we were going in one direction
and they in another, they challenged us to a race. Any two boats
might have done the same in the circumstances. We have to accept
defeat and that's all there is to it."</p>

<p>Calvert looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"It is near noon; if you all feel as I do you would welcome a
good dinner."</p>

<p>"That's the most sensible sense that I've heerd since we started,"
remarked Mike, who was as hungry as his companions.</p>

<p>"It is not a long run to Wiscasset," said Alvin; "and there's
more than one good hotel there."</p>

<p>"I'm thinking that at the speed ye're going, we'll hardly arrive
in time for supper. There must be some place betwixt here and
the town where we can git enough to stay the pangs of starvation
till we raich Wiscasset."</p>

<p>"We shall pass several landings, and there are farmhouses along
shore where I'm sure the folks will be glad to accommodate us."</p>

<p>The others were not much impressed with Mike's plan, but since
there was plenty of time at their command, they fell in with it.
Alvin suggested that all should keep a lookout for an inviting
dwelling, when, if a good landing could be made, they would stop
and investigate.</p>

<p>Chester offered to relieve his chum at the wheel, and Alvin was
quite willing to exchange places with him. The occurrences of
the last hour or more, together with what was said by Detective
Calvert, had increased the confidence of the youths in him. True,
they could not understand the full object of this cruise up the
river, after gaining sight of the launch and the occupants for
whom he had been searching. They were content to await explanation
on that point, but Alvin determined that one or two things which
puzzled him and Chester should be cleared up.</p>

<p>"Accepting what you said last night at my home, Mr. Calvert,
I must say for myself and friend that we do not understand some
of your actions. Perhaps you won't mind explaining them."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to do so, if it is prudent at this time."</p>

<p>"You will pardon me for saying that in our opinion you acted
foolishly when you followed us off the steamer the other day at
Sawyer Island, pretended you had made a mistake in landing there,
and then dogged us to that little inlet. We saw you several times,
but you either wished or pretended you wished to keep out of our
sight, as, for instance, after crossing that long bridge from
Hodgdon to Barter Island. You followed us, but when we stopped
at the side of the road to wait for you, you slipped among the
trees and made a circuit round the spot. Why did you do that?"</p>

<p>The detective smiled, and smoked a minute or two before replying.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was undignified, though a man in my profession has
to do a good many things in which he casts dignity to the winds.
The truth is, I formed the intention of getting off at Sawyer
as soon as I heard your friend Mr. Richards say he thought he
had caught sight of your launch in that cove. I was trying to
get track of the same parties, but prudence whispered to me that
the time had not yet come in which you and I should hitch up together.
I suspected it might soon be advisable, but not just then. My
pretence of having left at the wrong landing was a piece of foolishness
meant only to afford you and the agent a little amusement, but
I feared you would run into trouble with those criminals and I
decided to keep you under my eye. Until I concluded to trust you,
it was just as well that you should distrust me. For several reasons,
which I won't explain at this point, I came to the belief last
night that it was time we made common cause."</p>
