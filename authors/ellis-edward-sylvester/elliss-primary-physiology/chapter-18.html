<p>Alcohol does not exist in nature. It is a fluid made by fermentation,
or the rotting of vegetables and their juices. Beer, cider, and
wine are produced by the decay of a sweet liquid taken from grain
or fruits. Alcohol is that element in malt and spirituous liquors
which produces intoxication.</p>

<p>
<em>ITS DANGER</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Alcohol is indigestible and lessens the muscular power. No person
training for any severe contest would dare swallow a drop of it.
Its great danger lies in its attractiveness. It makes one at first
feel in high spirits, reckless of right and wrong, and it destroys
his judgment and sense. You all know that an intoxicated person
talks like an idiot.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
<em>EFFECT UPON THE ORGANS OF THE BODY</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Alcohol destroys the nerves, ruins the stomach, weakens the muscles,
affects the heart, bloats the body, kills the liver, causes insanity,
and makes men descend lower than the beast of the field. It turns
wise men into fools; peaceable persons into brawlers; good citizens
into wicked and dangerous ones; and is the direct cause of more
than three fourths of all the crimes in the country.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
<em>COST OF ALCOHOL</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>The total cost of alcoholic drinks each year is eight times that
spent for education. The saloon-keepers outnumber the ministers
of the gospel four to one. Sixty thousand people die annually
from alcohol.</p>

<p>Those who use alcohol are very liable to disease. In Russia the
cholera swept off one year every drinking person in a certain
town before it affected a single temperate one. In New Orleans,
five thousand drinking men died one season from yellow fever before
it touched a sober one. In 1832, in Park Hospital, New York, out
of 204 cases of cholera, only six were men of temperate habits;
these all recovered, while 122 of the others died.</p>

<p>Sir John Ross, the famous Arctic explorer, never used alcohol
or tobacco. On one of his voyages, when a youth, every one of
the crew that was a drinker, died; but he himself was not sick
a single hour. When exploring the frozen regions, he was an old
man, the oldest of his crew being twenty years younger than he.
His men used tobacco and spirits, but he went without either;
and with his advanced years, stood the rigors and hardships better
than any of them.</p>

<p>At a recent meeting of surgeons and officers of the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company to arrange for medical and surgical supplies
to be placed on trains and at each station on the road, the question
of adding alcoholic stimulants to the supplies was at once rejected;
some of the surgeons claiming that in case of shock from injury,
it was worthless.</p>

<p>
<em>INTOXICATION</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Intoxication leads a person to do that which he would not do
when sober if he dared. It therefore takes away the self-restraint
that is the safeguard of society.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
A <em>GRAVE ERROR</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>One of the greatest mistakes of the young is the belief that
a person can drink a little beer, cider, wine or liquor now and
then, without danger to himself. No one ever began drinking with
the belief that he would die a drunkard; he meant to drink when
he felt like it with his friends, but was sure he could stop when
he chose.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>TOTAL ABSTINENCE A SAFEGUARD</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Even if a person were able to keep to a moderate use of alcohol
all his life, his brain and nervous system would become diseased.
When epidemics visit any place, the first persons to die, as I
have shown, are those accustomed to drink liquor.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>EFFECT UPON THE MIND AND SOUL</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Poisonous as is alcohol to the body, it is more fatal to the
mind and heart. It clouds the brain, dwarfs and blots out the
good impulses, and increases the power of the passions and the
baser side of our nature.</p>

<p>The world is full of moral and mental wrecks caused by alcohol.
You see them about you; the most wretched drunkard on which you
ever looked was once a bright, hopeful boy like you. He could
not have been made to believe he would ever fall so low.</p>

<p>Your only safety is to resolve never to touch alcohol in any
form. Not only that, but it is your duty to do all you can to
keep others from injuring themselves by its use.</p>

<p>  Does alcohol exist in nature? What is alcohol? How are beer,
cider,   and wine produced? What element is alcohol?</p>

<p>  What is said of alcohol? In what lies its great danger? What
are its   effects at first?</p>

<p>  Show some of the evil effects of alcohol. Of what is it the
direct   cause?</p>

<p>  Compare the cost of alcoholic drinks and the sums spent for  
education. How do the number of saloon-keepers compare with that
of   the ministers of the gospel? How many people does it kill
annually?</p>

<p>  To what are drinkers of alcohol liable? Illustrate this statement
by   what occurred in Russia. In New Orleans. In New York.</p>

<p>  Prove the advantages of leaving tobacco and spirits alone by
some   facts respecting Sir John Ross.</p>

<p>  What action was taken recently by the surgeons and officers
of the   Pennsylvania Railroad Company?</p>

<p>  What does intoxication lead a person to do? What does it therefore  
take away?</p>

<p>  What is one of the greatest mistakes of the young?</p>

<p>  Suppose a person really could restrain himself to a moderate
use of   alcohol?</p>

<p>  How does alcohol affect the mind and heart?</p>

<p>  What is said of the most wretched drunkard in the land?</p>

<p>  What is the only safety? What is the duty of every one?</p>
