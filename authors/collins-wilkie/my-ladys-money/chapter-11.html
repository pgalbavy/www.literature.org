<P>
THE trim little maid-servant ran upstairs from her modest little
kitchen, trembling at the terrible prospect of having to open the
door. Miss Pink, deafened by the barking, had just time to say,
"What a very ill-behaved dog!" when a sound of small objects
overthrown in the hall, and a scurrying of furious claws across
the oil-cloth, announced that Tommie had invaded the house. As
the servant appeared, introducing Lady Lydiard, the dog ran in.
He made one frantic leap at Isabel, which would certainly have
knocked her down but for the chair that happened to be standing
behind her. Received on her lap, the faithful creature half
smothered her with his caresses. He barked, he shrieked, in his
joy at seeing her again. He jumped off her lap and tore round and
round the room at the top of his speed; and every time he passed
Miss Pink he showed the whole range of his teeth and snarled
ferociously at her ankles. Having at last exhausted his
superfluous energy, he leaped back again on Isabel's lap, with
his tongue quivering in his open mouth--his tail wagging softly,
and his eye on Miss Pink, inquiring how she liked a dog in her
drawing-room!
<P>
"I hope my dog has not disturbed you, ma'am?" said Lady Lydiard,
advancing from the mat at the doorway, on which she had patiently
waited until the raptures of Tommie subsided into repose.
<P>
Miss Pink, trembling between terror and indignation, acknowledged
Lady Lydiard's polite inquiry by a ceremonious bow, and an answer
which administered by implication a dignified reproof. "Your
Ladyship's dog does not appear to be a very well-trained animal,"
the ex-schoolmistress remarked.
<P>
"Well trained?" Lady Lydiard repeated, as if the expression was
perfectly unintelligible to her. "I don't think you have had much
experience of dogs, ma'am." She turned to Isabel, and embraced
her tenderly. "Give me a kiss, my dear--you don't know how
wretched I have been since you left me." She looked back again at
Miss Pink. "You are not, perhaps, aware, ma'am, that my dog is
devotedly attached to your niece. A dog's love has been
considered by many great men (whose names at the moment escape
me) as the most touching and disinterested of all earthly
affections." She looked the other way, and discovered the lawyer.
"How do you do, Mr. Troy? It's a pleasant surprise to find you
here The house was so dull without Isabel that I really couldn't
put off seeing her any longer. When you are more used to Tommie,
Miss Pink, you will understand and admire him. _You_ understand
and admire him, Isabel--don't you? My child! you are not looking
well. I shall take you back with me, when the horses have had
their rest. We shall never be happy away from each other."
<P>
Having expressed her sentiments, distributed her greetings, and
defended her dog--all, as it were, in one breath--Lady Lydiard
sat down by Isabel's side, and opened a large green fan that hung
at her girdle. "You have no idea, Miss Pink, how fat people
suffer in hot weather," said the old lady, using her fan
vigorously.
<P>
Miss Pink's eyes dropped modestly to the ground--"fat" was such a
coarse word to use, if a lady _must_ speak of her own superfluous
flesh! "May I offer some refreshment?" Miss Pink asked,
mincingly. "A cup of tea?"
<P>
Lady Lydiard shook her head.
<P>
"A glass of water?"
<P>
Lady Lydiard declined this last hospitable proposal with an
exclamation of disgust. "Have you got any beer?" she inquired.
<P>
"I beg your Ladyship's pardon," said Miss Pink, doubting the
evidence of her own ears. "Did you say--beer?"
<P>
Lady Lydiard gesticulated vehemently with her fan. "Yes, to be
sure! Beer! beer!"
<P>
Miss Pink rose, with a countenance expressive of genteel disgust,
and rang the bell. "I think you have beer downstairs, Susan?" she
said, when the maid appeared at the door.
<P>
"Yes, miss."
<P>
"A glass of beer for Lady Lydiard," said Miss Pink--under
protest.
<P>
"Bring it in a jug," shouted her Ladyship, as the maid left the
room. "I like to froth it up for myself," she continued,
addressing Miss Pink. "Isabel sometimes does it for me, when she
is at home--don't you, my dear?"
<P>
Miss Pink had been waiting her opportunity to assert her own
claim to the possession of her own niece, from the time when Lady
Lydiard had coolly declared her intention of taking Isabel back
with her. The opportunity now presented itself.
<P>
"Your Ladyship will pardon me," she said, "if I remark that my
niece's home is under my humble roof. I am properly sensible, I
hope, of your kindness to Isabel, but while she remains the
object of a disgraceful suspicion she remains with me."
<P>
Lady Lydiard closed her fan with an angry snap.
<P>
"You are completely mistaken, Miss Pink. You may not mean it--but
you speak most unjustly if you say that your niece is an object
of suspicion to me, or to anybody in my house."
<P>
Mr. Troy, quietly listening up to this point now interposed to
stop the discussion before it could degenerate into a personal
quarrel. His keen observation, aided by his accurate knowledge of
his client's character, had plainly revealed to him what was
passing in Lady Lydiard's mind. She had entered the house,
feeling (perhaps unconsciously) a jealousy of Miss Pink, as her
predecessor in Isabel's affections, and as the natural
protectress of the girl under existing circumstances. Miss Pink's
reception of her dog had additionally irritated the old lady. She
had taken a malicious pleasure in shocking the schoolmistress's
sense of propriety--and she was now only too ready to proceed to
further extremities on the delicate question of Isabel's
justification for leaving her house. For Isabel's own sake,
therefore--to say nothing of other reasons--it was urgently
desirable to keep the peace between the two ladies. With this
excellent object in view, Mr. Troy seized his opportunity of
striking into the conversation for the first time.
<P>
"Pardon me, Lady Lydiard," he said, "you are speaking of a
subject which has been already sufficiently discussed between
Miss Pink and myself. I think we shall do better not to dwell
uselessly on past events, but to direct our attention to the
future. We are all equally satisfied of the complete rectitude of
Miss Isabel's conduct, and we are all equally interested in the
vindication of her good name."
<P>
Whether these temperate words would of themselves have exercised
the pacifying influence at which Mr. Troy aimed may be doubtful.
But, as he ceased speaking, a powerful auxiliary appeared in the
shape of the beer. Lady Lydiard seized on  the jug, a nd filled
the tumbler for herself with an unsteady hand. Miss Pink,
trembling for the integrity of her carpet, and scandalized at
seeing a peeress drinking beer like a washer-woman, forgot the
sharp answer that was just rising to her lips when the lawyer
interfered. "Small!" said Lady Lydiard, setting down the empty
tumbler, and referring to the quality of the beer. "But very
pleasant and refreshing. What's the servant's name? Susan? Well,
Susan, I was dying of thirst and you have saved my life. You can
leave the jug--I dare say I shall empty it before I go."
<P>
Mr. Troy, watching Miss Pink's face, saw that it was time to
change the subject again.
<P>
"Did you notice the old village, Lady Lydiard, on your way here?"
he asked. "The artists consider it one of the most picturesque
places in England."
<P>
"I noticed that it was a very dirty village," Lady Lydiard
answered, still bent on making herself disagreeable to Miss Pink.
The artists may say what they please; I see nothing to admire in
rotten cottages, and bad drainage, and ignorant people. I suppose
the neighborhood has its advantages. It looks dull enough, to my
mind."
<P>
Isabel had hitherto modestly restricted her exertions to keeping
Tommie quiet on her lap. Like Mr. Troy, she occasionally looked
at her aunt--and she now made a timid attempt to defend the
neighborhood as a duty that she owed to Miss Pink.
<P>
"Oh, my Lady! don't say it's a dull neighborhood," she pleaded.
"There are such pretty walks all round us. And, when you get to
the hills, the view is beautiful."
<P>
Lady Lydiard's answer to this was a little masterpiece of
good-humored contempt. She patted Isabel's cheek, and said,
"Pooh! Pooh!"
<P>
"Your Ladyship does not admire the beauties of Nature," Miss Pink
remarked, with a compassionate smile. "As we get older, no doubt
our sight begins to fail--"
<P>
"And we leave off canting about the beauties of Nature," added
Lady Lydiard. "I hate the country. Give me London, and the
pleasures of society."
<P>
"Come! come! Do the country justice, Lady Lydiard!" put in
peace-making Mr. Troy. "There is plenty of society to be found
out of London--as good society as the world can show."
<P>
"The sort of society," added Miss Pink, "which is to be found,
for example, in this neighborhood. Her Ladyship is evidently not
aware that persons of distinction surround us, whichever way we
turn. I may instance among others, the Honorable Mr. Hardyman--"
<P>
Lady Lydiard, in the act of pouring out a second glassful of
beer, suddenly set down the jug.
<P>
"Who is that you're talking of, Miss Pink?"
<P>
"I am talking of our neighbor, Lady Lydiard--the Honorable Mr.
Hardyman."
<P>
"Do you mean Alfred Hardyman--the man who breeds the horses?"
<P>
"The distinguished gentleman who owns the famous stud-farm," said
Miss Pink, correcting the bluntly-direct form in which Lady
Lydiard had put her question.
<P>
"Is he in the habit of visiting here?" the old lady inquired,
with a sudden appearance of anxiety. "Do you know him?"
<P>
"I had the honor of being introduced to Mr. Hardyman at our last
flower show," Miss Pink replied. "He has not yet favored me with
a visit."
<P>
Lady Lydiard's anxiety appeared to be to some extent relieved.
<P>
"I knew that Hardyman's farm was in this county," she said; "but
I had no notion that it was in the neighborhood of South Morden.
How far away is he--ten or a dozen miles, eh?"
<P>
"Not more than three miles," answered Miss Pink. "We consider him
quite a near neighbor of ours."
<P>
Renewed anxiety showed itself in Lady Lydiard. She looked round
sharply at Isabel. The girl's head was bent so low over the rough
head of the dog that her face was almost entirely concealed from
view. So far as appearances went, she seemed to be entirely
absorbed in fondling Tommie. Lady Lydiard roused her with a tap
of the green fan.
<P>
"Take Tommie out, Isabel, for a run in the garden," she said. "He
won't sit still much longer--and he may annoy Miss Pink. Mr.
Troy, will you kindly help Isabel to keep my ill-trained dog in
order?"
<P>
Mr. Troy got on his feet, and, not very willingly, followed
Isabel out of the room. "They will quarrel now, to a dead
certainty!" he thought to himself, as he closed the door. "Have
you any idea of what this means?" he said to his companion, as he
joined her in the hall. "What has Mr. Hardyman done to excite all
this interest in him?"
<P>
Isabel's guilty color rose. She knew perfectly well that
Hardyman's unconcealed admiration of her was the guiding motive
of Lady Lydiard's inquiries. If she had told the truth, Mr. Troy
would have unquestionably returned to the drawing-room, with or
without an acceptable excuse for intruding himself. But Isabel
was a woman; and her answer, it is needless to say, was "I don't
know, I'm sure."
<P>
In the mean time, the interview between the two ladies began in a
manner which would have astonished Mr. Troy--they were both
silent. For once in her life Lady Lydiard was considering what
she should say, before she said it. Miss Pink, on her side,
naturally waited to hear what object her Ladyship had in
view--waited, until her small reserve of patience gave way. Urged
by irresistible curiosity, she spoke first.
<P>
"Have you anything to say to me in private?" she asked.
<P>
Lady Lydiard had not got to the end of her reflections. She said
"Yes!" --and she said no more.
<P>
"Is it anything relating to my niece?" persisted Miss Pink.
<P>
Still immersed in her reflections, Lady Lydiard suddenly rose to
the surface, and spoke her mind, as usual.
<P>
"About your niece, ma'am. The other day Mr. Hardyman called at my
house, and saw Isabel."
<P>
"Yes," said Miss Pink, politely attentive, but not in the least
interested, so far.
<P>
"That's not all ma'am. Mr. Hardyman admires Isabel; he owned it
to me himself in so many words."
<P>
Miss Pink listened, with a courteous inclination of her head. She
looked mildly gratified, nothing more. Lady Lydiard proceeded:
<P>
"You and I think differently on many matters," she said. "But we
are both agreed, I am sure, in feeling the sincerest interest in
Isabel's welfare. I beg to suggest to you, Miss Pink, that Mr.
Hardyman, as a near neighbor of yours, is a very undesirable
neighbor while Isabel remains in your house."
<P>
Saying those words, under a strong conviction of the serious
importance of the subject, Lady Lydiard insensibly recovered the
manner and resumed the language which befitted a lady of her
rank. Miss Pink, noticing the change, set it down to an
expression of pride on the part of her visitor which, in
referring to Isabel, assailed indirectly the social position of
Isabel's aunt.
<P>
"I fail entirely to understand what your Ladyship means," she
said coldly.
<P>
Lady Lydiard, on her side, looked in undisguised amazement at
Miss Pink.
<P>
"Haven't I told you already that Mr. Hardyman admires your
niece?" she asked.
<P>
"Naturally," said Miss Pink. "Isabel inherits her lamented
mother's personal advantages. If Mr. Hardyman admires her, Mr.
Hardyman shows his good taste."
<P>
Lady Lydiard's eyes opened wider and wider in wonder. "My good
lady!" she exclaimed, "is it possible you don't know that when a
man admires a women he doesn't stop there? He falls in love with
her (as the saying is) next."
<P>
"So I have heard," said Miss Pink.
<P>
"So you have _heard?_" repeated Lady Lydiard. "If Mr. Hardyman
finds his way to Isabel I can tell you what you will _see_. Catch
the two together, ma'am--and you will see Mr. Hardyman making
love to your niece."
<P>
"Under due restrictions, Lady Lydiard, and with my permission
first obtained, of course, I see no objection to Mr. Hardyman
paying his addresses to Isabel."
<P>
"The woman is mad!" cried Lady Lydiard. "Do you actually suppose,
Miss Pink, that Alfred Hardyman could, by any earthly
possibility, marry your niece!"
<P>
Not even Miss Pink's politeness could submit to such a question
as this. She rose indignantly from her chair. "As you aware, Lady
Lydiard, that the doubt you have just expressed is an insult to
my niece, and a insult to Me?"
<P>
"Are _you_ aware of who Mr. Hardyman really is?" retorted her
Ladyship. "Or do you judge of his position by the vocation in
life which he has perversely chosen to adopt? I can tell you, if
you do, that Alfred Hardyman is the younger son of one of the
 oldest barons in the English Peerage, and that his mother is
related by marriage to the Royal family of Wurtemberg."
<P>
Miss Pink received the full shock of this information without
receding from her position by a hair-breadth.
<P>
"An English gentlewoman offers a fit alliance to any man living
who seeks her hand in marriage," said Miss Pink. "Isabel's mother
(you may not be aware of it) was the daughter of an English
clergyman--"
<P>
"And Isabel's father was a chemist in a country town," added Lady
Lydiard.
<P>
"Isabel's father," rejoined Miss Pink, "was attached in a most
responsible capacity to the useful and honorable profession of
Medicine. Isabel is, in the strictest sense of the word, a young
gentlewoman. If you contradict that for a single instant, Lady
Lydiard, you will oblige me to leave the room."
<P>
Those last words produced a result which Miss Pink had not
anticipated--they roused Lady Lydiard to assert herself. As usual
in such cases, she rose superior to her own eccentricity.
Confronting Miss Pink, she now spoke and looked with the gracious
courtesy and the unpresuming self-confidence of the order to
which she belonged.
<P>
"For Isabel's own sake, and for the quieting of my conscience,"
she answered, "I will say one word more, Miss Pink, before I
relieve you of my presence. Considering my age and my
opportunities, I may claim to know quite as much as you do of the
laws and customs which regulate society in our time. Without
contesting your niece's social position--and without the
slightest intention of insulting you--I repeat that the rank
which Mr. Hardyman inherits makes it simply impossible for him
even to think of marrying Isabel. You will do well not to give
him any opportunities of meeting with her alone. And you will do
better still (seeing that he is so near a neighbor of yours) if
you permit Isabel to return to my protection, for a time at
least. I will wait to hear from you when you have thought the
matter over at your leisure. In the mean time, if I have
inadvertently offended you, I ask your pardon--and I wish you
good-evening."
<P>
She bowed, and walked to the door. Miss Pink, as resolute as ever
in maintaining her pretensions, made an effort to match the great
lady on her own ground.
<P>
"Before you go, Lady Lydiard, I beg to apologize if I have spoken
too warmly on my side," she said. "Permit me to send for your
carriage."
<P>
"Thank you, Miss Pink. My carriage is only at the village inn. I
shall enjoy a little walk in the cool evening air. Mr. Troy, I
have no doubt, will give me his arm." She bowed once more, and
quietly left the room.
<P>
Reaching the little back garden of the villa, through an open
door at the further end of the hall, Lady Lydiard found Tommie
rolling luxuriously on Miss Pink's flower-beds, and Isabel and
Mr. Troy in close consultation on the gravel walk.
<P>
She spoke to the lawyer first.
<P>
"They are baiting the horses at the inn," she said. "I want your
arm, Mr. Troy, as far as the village--and, in return, I will take
you back to London with me. I have to ask your advice about one
or two little matters, and this is a good opportunity."
<P>
"With the greatest pleasure, Lady Lydiard. I suppose I must say
good-by to Miss Pink?"
<P>
"A word of advice to you, Mr. Troy. Take care how you ruffle Miss
Pink's sense of her own importance. Another word for your private
ear. Miss Pink is a fool."
<P>
On the lawyer's withdrawal, Lady Lydiard put her arm fondly round
Isabel's waist. "What were you and Mr. Troy so busy in talking
about?" she asked.
<P>
"We were talking, my Lady, about tracing the person who stole the
money," Isabel answered, rather sadly. "It seems a far more
difficult matter than I supposed it to be. I try not to lose
patience and hope--but it is a little hard to feel that
appearances are against me, and to wait day after day in vain for
the discovery that is to set me right."
<P>
"You are a dear good child," said Lady Lydiard; "and you are more
precious to me than ever. Don't despair, Isabel. With Mr. Troy's
means of inquiring, and with my means of paying, the discovery of
the thief cannot be much longer delayed. If you don't return to
me soon, I shall come back and see you again. Your aunt hates the
sight of me--but I don't care two straws for that," remarked Lady
Lydiard, showing the undignified side of her character once more.
"Listen to me, Isabel! I have no wish to lower your aunt in your
estimation, but I feel far more confidence in your good sense
than in hers. Mr. Hardyman's business has taken him to France for
the present. It is at least possible that you may meet with him
on his return. If you do, keep him at a distance, my
dear--politely, of course. There! there! you needn't turn red; I
am not blaming you; I am only giving you a little good advice. In
your position you cannot possibly be too careful. Here is Mr.
Troy! You must come to the gate with us, Isabel, or we shall
never get Tommie away from you; I am only his second favorite;
you have the first place in his affections. God bless and prosper
you, my child!--I wish to heaven you were going back to London
with me! Well, Mr. Troy, how have you done with Miss Pink? Have
you offended that terrible 'gentlewoman' (hateful word!); or has
it been all the other way, and has she given you a kiss at
parting?"
<P>
Mr. Troy smiled mysteriously, and changed the subject. His brief
parting interview with the lady of the house was not of a nature
to be rashly related. Miss Pink had not only positively assured
him that her visitor was the most ill-bred woman she had ever met
with, but had further accused Lady Lydiard of shaking her
confidence in the aristocracy of her native country. "For the
first time in my life," said Miss Pink, "I feel that something is
to be said for the Republican point of view; and I am not
indisposed to admit that the constitution of the United States
_has_ its advantages!"
