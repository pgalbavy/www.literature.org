<p><em>FOR </em>the first time since joining the Texans in the pursuit
of Bell Rickard and his captive, Herbert Watrous found himself
entirely alone. He was lying on his face in the grass, at the
top of the elevation, peering out in the night, and watching and
listening for signs of friends and enemies.</p>

<p>It was not until the Texans had been gone several minutes that
he began to fancy his own situation was threatened with the same
peril that had overtaken Eph Bozeman, the trapper.</p>

<p>"They were never certain the Apaches didn’t find out we were
here," he thought, "and they may have been wrong in thinking that
warrior did not observe us. If those people are as cunning as
I have been told, who can say that their actions were not meant
to throw two such experienced hunters as Strubell and Lattin off
their guard?"</p>

<p>This was figuring matters to a fine point, and the result was
that Herbert reasoned himself into a most uncomfortable frame
of mind before his friends had been absent a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>"I have half a mind to go out and mount Jill," he added, "and
move off somewhere else; I would do it if the chances were not
that I would ride into a worse place than this—my gracious!"</p>

<p>He was looking in the direction of the mission building, when
something assumed form in the darkness immediately in front. Like
the figure that caught the notice of Lattin at about the same
time, the outlines were so indistinct that he could not identify
it at first, but, with amazement and alarm, he speedily saw that
a horseman had halted at the foot of the slope, with the face
of himself and steed turned toward him. They were as motionless
as if carved in stone, and their approach had been accompanied
with no sound that reached the ear of Herbert.</p>

<p>There was something so uncanny in the apparition that, after
first identifying it, the youth suspected it was a mistake, and
that something affected his vision. He turned his gaze away, and
even looked behind him. The result was similar to that which is
noticeable when we gaze at the Pleiades on a clear night. Keen
scrutiny shows but six stars, one modestly withdrawing before
our ardent gaze, to reappear when we glance carelessly in the
direction again.</p>

<p>Bringing back his eyes from their groping, Herbert saw the horseman
so plainly that no room for doubt remained. He was there at the
foot of the slope, apparently staring upward in the darkness with
the same intensity that the lad was studying him.</p>

<p>There was no room for hoping that this stranger was a friend,
for none of them had left the spot with his animal. It followed,
therefore, that he was an Apache out for mischief, since that
was the only errand that ever took those miscreants abroad.</p>

<p>"I believe it is the same one that rode to the top of the elevation
just before night," thought Herbert; "he saw enough to know something
is wrong, and is now seeking to find out for himself. He mustn’t
interfere with me," added the youth, compressing his lips, as
he brought his rifle round in front.</p>

<p>Had the Apache made a charge upon him, Herbert would have let
fly without an instant’s hesitation. He was inclined to fire as
it was; but, like the manly boy that he had become, he shrank
from doing that which looked so much like a crime. Villainous
as were the red men, he could not force himself to shoot one down
in so heartless a fashion.</p>

<p>Besides, there was the possibility that the Indian did not know
that anyone was on the elevation. Indeed, it might be said that
the very appearance as described was evidence that he lacked such
knowledge, for he had placed himself in a peril which one of his
tribe would be sure to avoid. Herbert therefore decided to await
more positive evidence of wrong intent before making any movement
against the fellow.</p>

<p>His heart gave a quick throb when he discovered that the horseman
was advancing. He heard the sound of his pony’s hoofs, followed
by a more distinct outlining of both.</p>

<p>"I do believe I shall have to drop him," thought Herbert, "and
I wouldn’t wait any longer if I wasn’t afraid that it would bring
the rest to the spot."</p>

<p>It was this fear that restrained him. There were likely to be
others near who would swarm thither at the report of his gun,
and more than likely make him prisoner, or slay him before he
could leap into the saddle and dash off.</p>

<p>Self-interest urged him to wait until the last moment.</p>

<p>He reasoned that it was impossible for the sharp-eyed warrior
to see him, since he was still flat in the grass; he must have
possessed wonderful acumen to make his way to the spot in the
darkness.</p>

<p>"It all depends on <em>you</em>," was Herbert’s decision; "if
you keep your distance no one will be hurt, but one step more
and there will be a missing Apache."</p>

<p>The action of the latter was singular, for, after advancing a
brief space, he again checked his pony and stood as motionless
as before.</p>

<p>Nothing was clearer than that something was suspected at least
by the red man to cause him to act in this manner. It may have
been that his pony was the suspicious one, and the rider was debating
with himself whether to explore further or give it up.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it was fortunate for himself as well as for Herbert
that he did not take long to reach a conclusion. At the moment
the youth believed a meeting was certain, his steed wheeled and
was off like a shot in the darkness—gone before Herbert could
have taken any aim.</p>

<p>He drew a sigh of relief at being left alone once more and so
unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"I believe that warrior will be back," was his conclusion, "and
if he is he won’t find <em>me</em> here."</p>

<p>Recalling the advice of Strubell, he hurried to where the horses
had been left. They seemed to have concluded that the coming of
night released them from the command of their masters to remain
on the ground, for the whole four were on their feet, cropping
the grass. Their saddles were in place, but their bits had been
shifted to allow them to eat, and each one was improving his time.</p>

<p>Jill gave a faint whinny on recognizing his master, and seemed
pleased to feel him in the saddle again.</p>

<p>"I don’t know which way to go now that I’m ready," thought Herbert,
"but it won’t do to ride far, or Strubell and Lattin will have
another young man’s ransom to arrange for."</p>

<p>Manifestly the counsel of his friends was meant that he should
hold himself ready to flee the instant it became necessary, but
until then, the chances were even that he would not decrease his
peril by a change of quarters.</p>

<p>A creditable motive led Herbert to adopt what might be called
a compromise, and which was not lacking in a certain acuteness.</p>

<p>If he remained until detected by the Apaches, and should then
dash off, they were sure to discover the other horses, and would
shoot or stampede them, leaving the three men in a hapless plight;
but if Herbert were charged upon at some other point, even if
not far removed, the animals might be overlooked in the flurry
of pursuit.</p>

<p>He therefore rode his pony parallel with the elevation and in
a southern direction, until he had gone a hundred yards or more,
when he drew up, and awaited the development of events.</p>

<p>He did not go to the top of the slight ridge, but near enough
to peer over without showing anything more than the head of himself
and Jill.</p>

<p>All this time he did not forget the risk that would be run by
getting too far from his friends. If they were to be troubled
by trying to reunite with him, the complication was likely to
affect Nick Ribsam as well. To prevent himself going astray, he
therefore held along the ridge. That could not fail to be a sure
guide to him whenever he wished to retrace his steps, for he had
only to follow its course in reverse to reach the former place
in a brief space of time.</p>

<p>His position now was quite similar to that of the Apache a short
while before, for he was motionless on his steed, facing the top
of the ridge, and waiting, watching and listening for whatever
might come.</p>

<p>"The whole party of Apaches," he said to himself, "may be stealing
toward this spot, thinking to find us all within their reach."</p>
