<p>There is a certain kind of man over whom all other men smile inwardly.
The tone of voice in which they speak of him has an affectionate growl,
which, once heard, cannot be mistaken. Such a man is apt to cherish what
other men call "impossible ideals about women," and it behooves his
masculine friends to watch out for him carefully lest he come a cropper.
Mr. Dennis Farraday was such a man among men, and Mr. Godfrey Vandeford
loved him deeply. They had met when they were both twenty-three, on
board a tramp steamer, bound for adventure in South Africa, and in the
seven years that had elapsed since then they had spent periods of time
together, in various kinds of sports. Killing time on Broadway was about
the only sport that they had not tried together. By very solid banking
and brokering Mr. Vandeford enjoyed and increased for himself and an
aristocratic, Knickerbocker-descended mother a few ancestral millions.
Incidentally, he took care of the sole hundred thousand dollars of which
Mr. Vandeford's high financiering on Broadway had left him possessed.
Mr. Farraday and Mrs. Justus Farraday represented the sole family ties
possessed by Mr. Vandeford, and he considered them both most valuable.
In fact, the maternal regard of Mrs. Justus Farraday was looked upon by
Mr. Vandeford as his chief treasure and sheet-anchor in times of the
high winds of life.
</p>
<p>"What makes you do it, Van?" questioned Mr. Farraday, as he sat with Mr.
Vandeford in the early morning in the latter's rooms after the tumult of
the first night of the unsuccessful "Miss Cut-up."
</p><p>"Excitement," answered Mr. Vandeford, as he put his bare heels,
protruding from his Chinese slippers, up on the edge of the mahogany
reading-table in his living-room, and began to pull at a long,
evil-smelling, briar pipe. "Nothing like it."
</p><p>"Do you really care for all that noise, those explosions of chorus
girls, sweating stage hands, cursing director and cursing star, paint,
powder, electricity, paper walls and furniture, call-bells and
hand-clapping from boozy critics in front?"
</p><p>"I do," answered Mr. Godfrey Vandeford, with a glint in his eyes deep
back in his head. "And so would you if you had bet about twenty thousand
on that combination and could see the people begin to eat it up right
before your eyes as you sat in a box and watched 'em. When you've backed
your own combination of inferno on riot, it gives you a thrill to stand
before the box-office and watch a line of people that stretches to the
next block plunk down dollars that they have earned at their own
particular combinations of life to see the combination you have made of
yours. Why, tears come into my eyes when I see some little, old,
dried-up seamstress pay a dollar to sit in the roost to see Gerald
Height love the powder off of Violet while she is cursing him under her
breath for so doing, and it tickles me under my ribs to see some fat,
jolly, lonely, old party buy a front seat two days hand-running to sit
and watch Mazie Villines dance over her own head and take the child out
to supper afterward in all propriety. It does him good all over after
selling white goods in Squeedunck, Illinois, eleven and three-quarter
months of every year. It's all to the good, Denny, and I wish you could
get the drag of it."
</p><p>"Perhaps it would be well if I could," agreed Mr. Farraday, as he rose
and shook his big, lithe body with the agility of a frolicsome puppy who
knows he is going into mischief, and looked cautiously at Godfrey. "Is
backing the life of the Violet sport, too?" he ventured.
</p><p>"Best I know. Took nothing and made it into something in five years. If
it bites my hand that's all in the game."
</p><p>"Same force could beget and train about eleven small Vandefords into
pretty good American citizens," Mr. Farraday snapped out, and then
backed away.
</p><p>"Absinthe cocktails ruin the taste for sweet milk. Don't talk about
things you know nothing about; thank God for that same ignorance," Mr.
Vandeford commanded. "Go to bed and sleep like the cherub you are, while
I expiate here with my pipe."
</p><p>From that conversation it was natural to man nature that the demand for
a half-interest in the next Hawtry show would have been made by Mr.
Dennis Farraday of Mr. Godfrey Vandeford, and acceded to with the
brotherly reservations already related. The eye-teeth of Mr. Dennis
Farraday were very precious to Mr. Godfrey Vandeford, and he had the
intention of taking great care that their edges should not be dulled. It
was well that he did not know that the eleven-fifteen train he had taken
in his flight to New York passed the huge, eight-cylinder Surreness of
his beloved Jonathan in its race up the beach for the home of the
Violet.
</p><p>Now, when all is said and considered, a large admiration is due and much
should be forgiven Miss Violet Hawtry, who, as half-starved Maggie
Murphy, had darted out of the gutter into the back stage-door at the age
of fifteen, snapped her huge violet eyes with their fringes of black,
trilled a vulgar, Irish street song in accompaniment to sundry
provocative swayings of her lissome, maturing young body, and thus had
made enough impression on her world to hang on by the tips of her
fingers until she dropped into the outstretched arms of Mr. Godfrey
Vandeford, who was prowling around Weehawken and the vicinity for just
such ripe fruit as she when he was casting his first musical girl-show
for the purpose of some violent excitement after a snowed-in winter in
the Klondike.
</p><p>He had taken her to an old stage-mother he knew, had her thoroughly
washed, combed, manicured, dressed, schooled, and had given her the
benefit of his respect for five years while she worked up into the star
of "Dear Geraldine" with all the might of the Irish eyes and lissome
figure and cooing, creamy voice. He had then built Highcliff in the
artist's colony of the Beach for the joint domicile of mother and
daughter. However, it is easier to bathe, comb, manicure, and
luxuriously clothe a body than it is to renovate a soul, and within the
Violet Maggie dwelt in all her gutter vigor. It is also safe to say that
perhaps it was no little part of the Maggie that the beautiful and
haughty Violet threw across the footlights to draw to her the primitive
in the hearts of her vast audiences. It was to some extent the wisdom of
Maggie that the Violet was using as she prepared for her first encounter
alone with Mr. Dennis Farraday as he raced down the moonlit beach to
her.
</p><p>"Not the violet and jet, Susette, but that white embroidered lisle, and
take time to sew three inches of tulle around the top of the bodice in
front and put folds five inches deep across the back. Let it come just
below the shoulder," she commanded, as she commenced the whirlwind of a
toilette with which, she had assured the hurrying Dennis, she was
already adorned.
</p><p>"<u>Mais</u>, Mademoiselle--" Susette began.
</p><p>"He'd shy at too much omitted clothing when we are alone. I'll have to
introduce him to myself gradually," she answered the protest, laughing
as she tossed her pale, yellow mane high on her head, and dabbed a
little curl against her cheek with the rose oil, and made a skilful use
of the lip-stick brought by Mr. Godfrey Vandeford from the famed
Celeste's.
</p><p>"He will behold that Mademoiselle Simone dance with very few garments
<u>alors</u>," Susette pouted as she laid in the folds of modest tulle.
</p><p>"But he won't be alone in the moonlight with her, that is, if I can help
it," answered the mistress, as she further perfumed and painted the lily
of her beauty. "Don't worry, Susette; I'm going to give monsieur the
time of his life."
</p><p>"That is without saying, Mademoiselle," answered Susette, as she slipped
the silky fluff over the Violet's head, and fastened the one or two
hooks that held it in place over the filmy undergarments in which the
Violet stood waiting for its veiling. "<u>Mon Dieu</u>, what a beauty it
gives you, and that placing of the tulle is <u>ravissant</u>."
</p><p>"That is what I meant it to be," laughed the Violet. "There's his car!
Bring me that orchid wrap when I ring for it." And leaving the
admiration of Susette, the Violet hurried down to drink from the cup of
the same vintage she was sure would be offered her by Mr. Dennis
Farraday. It was offered.
</p><p>"It's awfully good of you people to help a poor lonely dub to a pleasant
evening," were the words with which the victim greeted the Violet, while
his eyes offered the expected portion of admiration as he beheld her
bathed in the radiance of the moon.
</p><p>"Sure the pleasure is ours--or rather mine, poor old Van," she answered,
with not a little trepidation well hidden under her rich voice.
</p><p>"Couldn't you wake him up, the old scout? Let me get to him. I have a
way with him I learned in the Nova Scotia woods." Mr. Farraday laughed a
big laugh, which had in it the tang of the breeze in the tops of
pine-trees. But the Violet was ready for him.
</p><p>"He's not there for your torture. The poor darling got a telephone
message just twenty minutes ago to come back to New York to-night. I've
just motored him up the beach to catch the eleven-fifteen train. Some
day that tiresome Dolph will follow Van about some play snarl into--into
Paradise."
</p><p>"He did that to-night, didn't he?" asked Mr. Farraday, with a merry
laugh as he ruffled his red forelock up off his broad brow, and made
himself look like a huge, tame lion.
</p><p>"Away with your blarney, boy!" laughed the Violet, in return, using her
Maggie Murphy form of speech with telling effect, as she often did. "He
left a thousand apologies for you," she added, slipping back into her
veneer of the--for Maggie--upper world. "And you've had your race down
for nothing; poor Simone!"
</p><p>"Oh, I say, can't we just go on over to supper at the Beach Inn? The
Clyde Trevors asked me, and we can have supper with them. Wouldn't you
like that? We can tell them about poor Van." He was as eager as a boy in
his friendly efforts to mend what he thought must be a broken evening
for her.
</p><p>"I'd love it," answered the Violet, with a flash of her white teeth and
violet eyes at him.
</p><p>After a summons Susette appeared with the alluring orchid garment, and a
white film of seed-pearls for her mistress's hair. She assisted the
Violet's discreet Japanese butler to put them into the big car, which
Mr. Farraday was driving himself, and then stood for a minute watching
them hurl themselves away across the white sand.
</p><p>"_Quelle vie!_" she muttered to herself as she turned back into the
darkened house.
</p><p>The Beach Inn was aglow and atwinkle and in full laugh as they ascended
the steps of the wide veranda hung out over the ocean, where members and
guests were having supper at small tables lit with shaded lamps. Men and
girls, in bathing suits that were lineal descendants of the scant
fig-leaf, were eating and drinking together sparsely because of their
intention of taking a midnight plunge in the breakers under the hot
moon, while other women in radiant evening garb were almost as scantily
attired, though attended by stuffily garbed men. Most of the parties
turned and called a laughing greeting to the Violet, for they were the
men and women of her world disporting themselves away from Broadway, and
Clyde Trevor, who had written the book for "Miss Cut-up," rose and came
over to claim his guests.
</p><p>"Lost Van?" he questioned, as he led them to their seats beside Mrs.
Trevor, who had danced fifty thousand dollars out of New York the winter
just ended. His voice held a hint of irony, which the Violet got and Mr.
Dennis Farraday missed.
</p><p>"Not quite yet," she said, with a coo at which Trevor smiled, and under
his breath he gave her the word, "Good hunting!"
</p><p>"Thanks."
</p><p>"Old Van had to hop back to New York on the eleven-fifteen, but we came
on to glad with you anyway," Mr. Farraday was saying to Mrs. Trevor,
with an ingenuous smile.
</p><p>"Go to it, baby," commanded Trevor to his wife, as a rich negro melody
began to fling its invitation against the roaring call of the ocean, and
at his word Simone rose from the seat of Mrs. Trevor and slid out into
the cleared space at the head of the steps.
</p><p>"Just in time," commented Mr. Farraday under his breath, as he turned
his chair to watch her drop her silk coat, and float out on the waves of
sound just as she would later float on the waves of the ocean after she
had plunged from the steps to lead the midnight bathing in the surf, for
which the management of the inn paid her the sum of two hundred dollars
per plunge.
</p><p>All of this gaiety and amusement was just a prelude to the ride home in
the moonlight, which the Violet took with good Dennis Farraday and
during which she discovered that there is such a thing as honor among
men about poaching on other men's preserves, and during which, also, the
fate of Major Adair, Patricia, Roger, and old black Jeff hung in the
balance.
</p><p>"Just what are we racing?" she questioned as they flew along the beach
with rubber tires that just skimmed the hard, white sand.
</p><p>"A bit fast?" asked Mr. Farraday, with a protective laugh, as he slowed
down the flight.
</p><p>"Let's loaf and talk a while," the Violet answered, with a tentative
note of invitation in her voice.
</p><p>"I had thought you and Van and I would have a great powwow over the
play this evening, and it's fierce that he had to get back to that
furnace a night like this, but we can limp along on a few ideas without
him, maybe. What do you think of 'The Purple Slipper'?" As he set the
car at an easy pace he turned and looked down at the lovely face so near
his shoulder with a great and extremely boyish enthusiasm, which was
very delightful and very irritating to the Violet.
</p><p>"What do you think about it? You tell first," she said with a smile that
answered his enthusiasm adequately and which served to cover with
agility the fact that she had not read the play.
</p><p>"Well, at first it seemed a queer kind of vehicle for you, but as I read
on I could see you queening it in all those furbelows of dress as well
as adventure and sentiment. It's a little serious in situation, but it
is full of comedy adventure in line, and I can just see the audience eat
you up in it. I told Van so, and I bought in before I had read more
than half the second act. I don't feel as though I could wait to see you
in that dinner scene while you hold the enemies of your spouse
confounded. I agree with Van that your emotional qualities may exceed
your comedy."
</p><p>"Does Van back my emotional acting against my comedy?" the Violet asked,
with barely concealed surprise in her voice.
</p><p>"He does. He says that 'The Purple Slipper' is going to be the sensation
of Broadway for the early fall, and I agree with him. Do you feel as
sure of it as he says you are?"
</p><p>"Yes," answered the Violet, and by her assent in premeditated ignorance
of the contents of the play manuscript she put the second cross on the
production which made it a double on the fate of Mr. Dennis Farraday as
a theatrical producer. However, that fact may have been balanced by the
fact that it was the third cross on the fate of Miss Patricia Adair.
Crosses on fates in the world of Broadway go in singles, doubles, and
threes, and no man can tell their exact significance.
</p><p>"Good!" answered Mr. Dennis Farraday, with another and still broader
smile of gratification and admiration of the Violet as an artist--a
smile which further infuriated, but equally inspired her. "And what a
grand time we'll all have putting it across! I'm going to help Van see
actors for the cast on Friday, and I'm going to sit in on rehearsals
straight through. I'm due a month's vacation, and I'm going to have my
mail from the office relayed back to New York from the yacht off
Nantucket so that bunch of money grubbers can't find me. Think of having
the honor of being co-producer for Violet Hawtry for my first shot!"
</p><p>All of which enthusiasm and admiration went like wine to the head of the
Violet, though it left her heart uncomfortably cold; and beautiful, cool
moonlight heats the heart of a fair woman when it is not more than two
feet away from that of a brave and fair man.
</p><p>"Sure I'll make it a success for you, man dear!" Maggie Murphy in the
Violet made an attempt to put a glow into the situation, using the
brogue that was like rich cream poured over peaches, as she snuggled her
bare shoulder, from which the orchid wrap had slipped, with a natural
little shiver against good Dennis's wheel arm.
</p><p>"You and Van are trumps to take me in for the fun, and I'm no end
grateful to you both," was all she got for her manoeuver.
</p><p>"Yes--Van is a dear," she hedged in a matter-of-fact voice.
</p><p>"Yes, and I suppose after my co-first night with him the old scout will
stop baiting me about blinking the white lights. I always have been
obliged to beat Van at any game before I could rest in peace." And at
the thought of getting in at his David big Jonathan laughed heartily
just as he began to slow up the car for the turn along the sea-wall that
led under the porch of Highcliff.
</p><p>"Have you ever competed with him in the biggest game of all?" the
Violet asked softly, as the car swept into the shadow and stopped by the
broad stone steps.
</p><p>"What do you mean?" demanded Mr. Farraday, with a countenance so open
and a voice so hearty that the Violet, used to artifice from everybody,
suspected that they could not be real, and this suspicion made her give
up the game for the time being. She laughed with a mocking sweetness as
she sprang out of the car and to the top of the steps before he could
help her.
</p><p>"Some day I'll tell you what I mean," she mocked from the dark doorway.
"Good-night!" And while he stood at the bottom step looking up at her,
she vanished into the darkness of the house, leaving him out in the cool
moonlight, a fate very different from what she had been planning for him
for several hours.
</p><p>"Just as old Van said, they are nothing but children, and I blame him
about trifling with her more than I thought I did; she's a dear thing
and a little pathetic in her anxiety to make good for him. Scout has
just got to do something about it all. She's a fine and devoted woman.
And beautiful--whee-ugh!" The big thirty-year-old boy ended his
soliloquy with a whistle, which showed that in a measure he had
appreciated the dangers of the last hours. One of the eternal questions
is how can a mere man be so wicked--or so good as he is often discovered
by temptation to be?
</p><p>"I'll have to be publicly and finally severed from Van before I annex
him, the boob," was the soliloquy of the Violet as she prepared for her
slumber of beauty. Another question is how thin a veneer of feminine
beauty weathers indefinitely the wash of circumstances.
</p><p>Then after that moonlit night in August Fate spun her web, which she
called "The Purple Slipper," rapidly, and for a number of the people
involved life became very hectic. The center of the whirl was Mr. Adolph
Meyers, though he was safely functioning with power behind the throne
occupied by Mr. Godfrey Vandeford's nonchalant and elegantly clad
figure.
</p><p>"But Mr. Vandeford, sir, it is never before that you have produced a
play without a reading," he remonstrated on the morning of the day set
for the picking of the cast from those probably suitable chosen by
Chambers, the invaluable agent of the great army of those theatrically
employed. "Actors will be here from twelve o'clock even to six. How will
a choice be made?"
</p><p>"I'm trusting to your hunch about the purple manuscript falling on the
day of the Violet letter, Pops," answered Mr. Godfrey Vandeford. "Make
out a little memorandum against each name that tells me what to pick. I
like the idea of going it blind that way: it may be lucky. And, Pops,
split that five-thousand-dollar check of Mr. Farraday's in three ways.
Pay Lindenberg two-fifty as his advance on the scenery for 'The Rosie
Posie Girl,' provided he furbishes up something that will do for the
little road sally of Violet's spanking-machine, to be emblazoned as
'The Purple Slipper' on the cheapest black bills ever run off in New
York. Give Hugh Willings a thousand advance for the music of 'The Rosie
Posie Girl,' but make him write as many as six waltz songs even if you
are sure the first is a hit; it is good to make people, specially any
kind of artists, work for the money you pay 'em. The other fifteen
hundred you had better put off by itself as a starter on the Violet's
gowns. She likes to pay an Irish woman with a French name three hundred
dollars for six dollars' worth of chiffon sewed with seventy-five cents'
worth of silk."
</p><p>"What is for costumes for the 'Purple Slipper'?"
</p><p>"Oh, any old dolling up will do for that. The women can wear what
they've got and the men borrow or rent." With a wave of the cigarette in
his hand, Mr. Vandeford dismissed the scenic effects of the play for
whose début Miss Elvira Henderson was concocting a dream costume to
adorn the author for receiving triumphal plaudits.
</p><p>"But, Mr. Vandeford, sir, it is a costume play of a period," the humble
power behind the throne pleaded.
</p><p>"Oh, is it? Then rent the nearest layout to its date that Grossmidt has
for all of 'em in a lump, and make him give you a bargain. Tell him they
won't be worn more than two weeks. I guess Violet will be in line by
that time." With which significant order Mr. Godfrey Vandeford turned
from the anxious Mr. Meyers to answer the tinkling telephone at his
elbow. In a second he was speaking to the most eminent stage director on
Broadway.
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Yes, this is Godfrey Vandeford, Bill."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Yes. Called to know if you would like to stage a little show for me
right away."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Yes. I'm going to give Hawtry a little canter before 'The Rosie Posie
Girl.' New line for her, and doubtful. Like to take hold for a
pittance?"
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Oh, yes, that three hundred a week for the 'Posie Girl' goes, of
course, but this play is just a Hawtry whim that I have got to let her
get out of her system. One hundred a week is my limit, and you ought to
do it for seventy-five. You can sit in your chair all the time for all I
care."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Now you get me--a hundred it is. Let her have her head and work off
steam before we start 'The Rosie Posie.' Yes, Willings is doing the
Rosie songs for us. They'll be hot stuff."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Yes, Corbett's making sketches for 'The Rosie Posie' scenery now. We'll
start 'The Purple Slipper' on Monday. Yes, that's its blooming name.
By!"
</p><hr/>
<p>"Is it William Rooney to stage 'The Purple Slipper'?" asked Mr. Meyers,
with a shrug of his narrow shoulders as he began pecking out on his
machine the notes that were to guide his chief in picking the artists
who were to embody the characters in the play founded on the life
romance of that old grandame Madam Patricia Adair of colonial Kentucky.
</p><p>"Why do you reckon Samuel Goldstein likes to build up a reputation for
himself on Broadway by the name of William Rooney, Pops?" inquired Mr.
Vandeford, with the idle curiosity of a free and untroubled mind.
</p><p>"It is the prejudice against Hebrews for a reason," answered Mr. Meyers,
with a glint in his gem-like eyes and a wave of color flushing across
his high, scholarly forehead.
</p><p>"Well, the top crust of the whole show business is Hebrew, and I should
think the bunch of you would be proud of the fact. I'm even proud that a
man named Adolph Meyers runs this whole company, and me included," said
Mr. Vandeford, without taking the trouble to note the wave of gratified
pride, devotion, and embarrassment that swept over the countenance of
his faithful henchman. "Now I'll get a little booking for your 'Purple
Slipper,' and that is all you need expect me to do, except shoulder all
the loss I haven't shunted on Denny."
</p><p>"It is to be a win, not a loss," murmured the loyal Adolph under his
breath, with a glance of affection at the absorbed Mr. Godfrey
Vandeford.
</p><p>This vow of Mr. Adolph Meyers shows that it is as dangerous to arouse
the affection and loyalty of one genius as it is to incur the anger of
another.
</p><p>The casting of "The Purple Slipper" was a joy to Mr. Dennis Farraday. He
was to pay well for it in the future, but it was conducted in pure glee.
He sat beside Mr. Godfrey Vandeford in the latter's long, Persian
carpeted, soft-tinted, and famous-actor-photograph-bedecked, private
office beside that eminent producer, and watched the strong light from
over their shoulders reveal the points of the men and women who came in
to exhibit themselves. From the moment they entered the door, through
the walk or waddle or lope or saunter with which they approached their
fate to the expressions of joy or disappointment which their emotions
showed under Mr. Godfrey Vandeford's grilling, Mr. Farraday was deeply
interested.
</p><p>"You know, Bébé, it is not necessary to put on more than a hundred extra
pounds when in training for the heavy mother," he genially admonished a
very large lady of uncertain age--an age artfully covered with rouge,
powder, pencil, and lip-stick--who sank into the chair facing him with a
pathetic remnant of the former lissome grace which had got her as far as
being a dependable leading woman to any star who could go her a few
points better.
</p><p>"Well, it's not from living on large salaries from you that I have put
on the pounds, Mr. Godfrey Vandeford!" she answered with a jovial laugh.
</p><p>"Still eating half of old Wallace Kent's salary checks?" Mr. Vandeford
demanded. This seemed a lack of delicacy to Mr. Dennis Farraday, who
blushed with a color equal to that which rose in the cheeks of the old
beauty as her eyes snapped and she rose to her feet.
</p><p>"As you know, he's feeding a squab chicken at Rector's to get her into
the broiler class. Good-day, sir," and she prepared to sweep out of the
office with all the fire she had used in many a queenly situation.
</p><p>"Good old Bébé," Mr. Vandeford said, as he rose and put a restraining
arm around her broad waist. "I was just teasing to see what was
smouldering. How'll seventy-five a week, with costumes of frills and
powdered hair, do you? Thirty sides and the center of the stage four
times." "Sides," meaning single sheets of dialogue, puzzled Mr.
Farraday, but he made a mental note to seek enlightenment.
</p><p>"I haven't had a part this winter, Godfrey," she laughed, and sobbed on
Mr. Vandeford's shoulder. "I'm living in a suitcase at Mrs. Pinkham's."
</p><p>"Stop and get a twenty-five check from Dolph, and be on the job Monday
at the Barrett Theatre. Now run!" Mr. Vandeford gave Miss Bébé Herne's
two hundred pounds of avoirdupois a gentle shove toward the door, which
hint she took with an alacrity that had in it a great deal of left-over
grace.
</p><p>"Supported a lot of big guns for years. Knows her business better than
any actress on Broadway," said Mr. Godfrey Vandeford to his horrified
confrère as the door closed behind the old beauty. "Picked up Wallace
Kent when he was a piffling, faded juvenile, and taught him to be a good
elderly support worth his hundred to any director. He's left her flat
for a pony in the Big Show, old hound!"
</p><p>"Pretty raw," observed Mr. Dennis Farraday, with a great deal of emotion
very poorly concealed in his sympathetic voice.
</p><p>"Oh, she's had her fling in life! Dopes a bit, but can be depended upon.
Next!"
</p><p>This time there entered a husky, young brute of a boy with shoulders
broad enough to run a double-decker plough. His hair was long and
sleeked close to his well-shaped head, but his fine mouth and chin
sagged, and his eyes were bold and sophisticated. In costume he was the
glass and mould of Broadway fashion.
</p><p>"Reginald Leigh," he announced himself in a nice voice, and, as he
spoke, took from a case a card and laid it on the edge of Mr.
Vandeford's desk.
</p><p>"Experience, Mr. Leigh?" asked Mr. Vandeford, still standing and with
not an atom of encouragement in his whole body from head to toe.
</p><p>"College dramatics and last summer in stock at Buffalo. I've worked in
two pictures for the Universal."
</p><p>"Heavy juvenile at fifty a week," offered Mr. Vandeford, with an
indifferent glance up from the paper in his hand prepared for his
guidance by the indefatigable Mr. Meyers. The word "handsome" was typed
in the offer from which Mr. Vandeford made to Mr. Leigh.
</p><p>"My price is a hundred, Mr. Vandeford," answered Mr. Leigh, very
pleasantly, and he took a grip on his hat and stick that was meant to
convey the idea of immediate departure.
</p><p>"Sorry," answered Mr. Vandeford, with a finality that staggered Mr.
Dennis Farraday; for the youngster's looks and charm were so evident
that it pained him to see "The Purple Slipper" lose them. "Costumes
historical, furnished," added Mr. Vandeford, with increased
indifference.
</p><p>"Oh, in that case--" murmured the boy, almost, but not quite, unleashing
his eagerness.
</p><p>"Just leave your telephone number with Mr. Meyers in the outer office,
please. Good-morning, Mr. Leigh," was the answer his concession got
along with the dismissal in the "good-morning," which was spoken in such
a tone that it was obeyed in short order.
</p><p>"That is a find," said Mr. Godfrey Vandeford to the gasping Mr. Dennis
Farraday. "Handsome young chaps who have any kind of manliness are hard
to find these days. Too busy to be actors."
</p><p>"Why didn't you engage him?" further gasped his partner in the adventure
of "The Purple Slipper."
</p><p>"I'll let him cool his heels, to get some of the know-it out of his
system. Dolph will make him come around and beg in less than twenty-four
hours."
</p><p>"See here, Van, these people are artists to whom you are trusting your
money and reputation as a producer, and you treat them like--"
</p><p>"The foolish children that they are," interrupted Mr. Vandeford. "Next!"
and he pressed a button under his desk that buzzed for Mr. Meyers's ears
alone.
</p><p>The next three applicants were girls, who respectively giggled,
glowered, and simpered. Mr. Godfrey Vandeford chose the two who glowered
and simpered and got rid of the giggler by referring her telephone
number to Mr. Adolph Meyers.
</p><p>"That second that you sent away was the prettiest of the bunch,"
commented Mr. Dennis Farraday, with interest that had survived to that
point with undiminished intensity.
</p><p>"Not at home under that little cocked hat. That giggle was the whole bag
of tricks," instructed Mr. Vandeford. "Got any men out there, Pops?" he
asked through the telephone to Mr. Adolph Meyers.
</p><p>Immediately there entered a debonair, very handsome, and sleek gentleman
of uncertain age.
</p><p>"Hello, Kent, want to support Bébé in a costume play for a hundred a
week?" asked Mr. Vandeford, with not an instant's greeting in answer to
that gentleman's cordial good-morning.
</p><p>"In New York or on the road?" questioned Mr. Kent, with an assurance
that he tried to make bold.
</p><p>"To the devil if I send you there," was the answer he got straight off
the bat.
</p><p>"A hundred with costumes?"
</p><p>"With costumes."
</p><p>"Done."
</p><p>"See Dolph; but not over ten-dollar advance to save your hide."
</p><p>"He's giving fifty."
</p><p>"To whom?"
</p><p>"Bébé."
</p><p>"He did that because he knew that you'd get half of what he gave her.
Ten's your limit."
</p><p>"All right. Good-morning!"
</p><p>"Barrett on Monday morning."
</p><p>"All right!"
</p><p>With which Mr. Kent rapidly made his exit.
</p><p>"Old reprobate! But he does feed the lines to his opposite, and Bébé
happy is worth twice Bébé in a grouch. You see what the whole blamed
thing is like and--" Mr. Vandeford was interrupted by the tinkle of the
telephone at his elbow.
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Godfrey Vandeford speaking."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"When did you get in?"
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Not busy at all."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"The Claridge?"
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Right away."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Haven't seen or heard from him in two days."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Right over. By!"
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>From overhearing, as he was forced to do, this one-sided conversation,
how could Mr. Dennis Farraday imagine that Violet Hawtry had come into
sultry New York seeking him to devour and that his keeper was rushing
away from his presence to his defense?
</p><p>"You and Pops engage the rest, Denny. You see the trick now. Nothing
left important but what Dolph puts down on this paper as 'woman support
for character parts with looks.' Try your hand, old man, and if you pick
a flivver there are plenty more to cast in and her out. By!" And before
Mr. Farraday could protest he was left alone in the inquisition-room.
And as Mr. Godfrey Vandeford went down in an elevator on his way to the
Claridge to deliver the next instalment of the spanking of Miss Violet
Hawtry, he passed a live wire going up opposite him and met one walking
down Forty-second Street, neither of which he could be expected to
recognize, as he had never seen either.
</p><p>The first of the two dynamos walked into the office of the Vandeford
Producing Company and failed to thrill Mr. Adolph Meyers in the least, a
fact for which he could never afterward account. He motioned her into
the inner office, and left her to her fate and Mr. Dennis Farraday.
</p><p>"Good-morning, Mr. Vandeford," she said in a queer, throaty kind of
voice that had in it a "come hither" of unusual quality, which
suggested that in her production a Romney woman might have loved a Greek
dancer well. She stood at ease before the long desk with a grace that
was unmistakably that of complete assurance.
</p><p>"I'm not Mr. Vandeford, but his--his partner, Dennis Farraday. Er--er,
won't you be seated?" and with the happy, considerate manner of his that
he had always used to all women, he offered her his own chair and
appropriated the one of authority that Mr. Vandeford always occupied.
</p><p>"Thank you," answered the young woman, with an ease equal to his own.
And then they both waited while regarding each other seriously. Finally
the tension relaxed and Dennis Farraday gave a big, jovial laugh while
he made his admission:
</p><p>"I don't know a thing about the play business. I'm just sitting in with
Mr. Vandeford for the fun of it."
</p><p>"An angel?" asked the girl, with a laugh that somehow accorded with
his.
</p><p>"That's it. He's gone out and left me to--to cut my eye teeth."
</p><p>"On me?"
</p><p>"Looks that way," and again they both laughed.
</p><p>"Maybe I can help you," volunteered the girl, after the laugh. "I am
Mildred Lindsey, and Mr. Chambers sent me in to see if I could support
Miss Hawtry."
</p><p>"Er--er, what experience?" Mr. Dennis Farraday managed to ask by fishing
into his impressions of the last two hours.
</p><p>"Five years in stock on the Pacific coast, two years in towns between,
and two weeks in a flivver here on Broadway early in the spring. Dead
broke, hungry, and about ready to make good for some manager." As the
answer was fired point-blank at him, Mr. Dennis Farraday seemed to see a
fire of psychic hunger blaze as high as that of wolfish, physical agony
in the girl's eyes.
</p><p>Mr. Dennis Farraday eagerly searched on the paper of guidance in casting
made out by Mr. Adolph Meyers for the benefit of Mr. Vandeford and
found "woman support," and opposite the item of salary, seventy-five
dollars. He doubled.
</p><p>"How would a hundred and fifty a week with costumes do for salary? You
can have a couple of weeks advance right now if you like," he said in an
easy, nonchalant manner as much like that of Mr. Vandeford as he could
muster, for those fires of hunger in the girl's eyes were searching
holes in Mr. Dennis Farraday's pocket.
</p><p>"It would save my life--but--but could you tell me a little about the
part? I might not be able to play it." There were both hope and fear in
her compelling voice.
</p><p>The question found Mr. Dennis Farraday unprepared by any precedent
established in the two foregoing hours, for between the artists and Mr.
Vandeford there had been alone the matter of salary to be settled and
not one of them had inquired whether they were being engaged to play a
Billy Sunday or an Ethiopian slave. But in another way it found him
better prepared than would have been Mr. Godfrey Vandeford. He had read
the manuscript of "The Purple Slipper" and Mr. Vandeford had not.
</p><p>"Well, to my uninitiated way of thinking, the supporting part is about
as good as the leading one," said Mr. Dennis Farraday, and forthwith he
launched out on an eager, enthusiastic resumé of the plot and
atmosphere, even quoting lines of "The Purple Slipper." And as he talked
Mildred Lindsey leaned across the table toward him and fairly drank in
his words.
</p><p>"I see--it's wonderful how she keeps his enemies at bay during the first
half of the banquet--while she waits. It's great!" Her enthusiasm
expressed in her wonderful voice urged Mr. Dennis Farraday on and on to
a fuller exposition of the play and its beauties.
</p><p>"You see, the sister is really the one to carry the plot. It is on her
that Rosalind leans, and she has to be all there in her quiet way."
</p><p>"Yes, I see, and it can be made--" At this juncture the eye of Mr.
Adolph Meyer was inserted to a crack of the door and then removed as he
shook his head in puzzled doubt. He had intended to intrude to the
rescue of his co-employer's inexperience, but he decided that the time
was not ripe by one glance at Mr. Farraday's eager face, surmounted by
its rampant, red leonine locks.
</p><p>"I have pity for Mr. Farraday," Mr. Meyers remarked to himself as he
seated himself at his machine, not knowing that in a very few minutes
the second live wire would arrive in the office and this time he would
get a shock himself.
</p><p>For a half-hour he wrote on, while the animated voices boomed and purled
and bubbled in the office beyond the crack of the door he had left open
to observe the first lull that might call for relief. Then he got his
shock.
</p><p>The office door opened timidly, and somebody entered so quietly that she
stood beside Mr. Adolph Meyers before he had lifted his head.
</p><p>It was the author of "The Renunciation of Rosalind," now "The Purple
Slipper," and she looked every inch of it! Miss Elvira, the genius
guided by "The Feminist Review," had done her best with the blue-silk
suit, and Fifth Avenue could have done no better.
</p><p>"May I see Mr. Vandeford? I am Miss Patricia Adair," she announced in a
rich and calm Southern voice and manner.
</p><p>Mr. Adolph Meyers sprang to his feet with the impact of the shock.
</p><p>"Mr. Vandeford is not in the office, Madam, at present," he managed to
gasp. Then he followed her big, gray eyes as they rested on the crack of
the door through which the boom of Mr. Dennis Farraday's voice mingled
with the excited chime of Miss Lindsey's laughter, and noticed as though
for the first time that it had emblazoned upon it in large, gilt
letters, "Mr. Vandeford. Private."
</p><p>"It is Mr. Dennis Farraday, the partner of Mr. Vandeford, engaging
actors, Miss, in his absence. Will you walk in?" and in almost the first
panic in which he had ever indulged Mr. Adolph Meyers showed the proud
young author into the sanctum sanctorum from which he had barricaded
many an enraged virago who had threatened his life if he kept her from
an appeal to the manager.
</p><p>"It is Miss Adair, the author of your play, Mr. Farraday, would speak
with you," he announced across the long room, bowed in a way he had
never done in his life, and shut the door behind Miss Adair.
</p><p>It is interesting to wonder how it would have affected the end of the
whole matter if Patricia Adair had walked in behind the giggler when Mr.
Godfrey Vandeford, with all his experience with authors, was seated on
the throne instead of poor inexperienced Dennis Farraday, enjoying "The
Purple Slipper" with his newly engaged, supporting lady.
</p><p>"By jove, Miss Adair, it is little bit of all right that you should come
in and catch Miss Lindsey and me chewing joy-rags over our--your play.
Let me introduce Miss Lindsey, who is to support Miss Hawtry in the part
of Harriet." And bonnie Dennis, the angel, beamed with pure joy at the
good time he was having as a producer. At the very sight and sound of
him poor Patricia, who for half an hour had been wandering up and down
Forty-second Street, looking for the tallest building on it, took both
comfort and delight, and her sea-gray eyes with stars in their depths
returned the beam of his eyes.
</p><p>"It's so wonderful that you like my play and are going to produce
it--and you to act in it, Miss Lindsey," she said as she seated herself
in the chair Mr. Farraday had drawn up for her. She looked at them both
with respectful awe in her eyes and in her cheeks a flush of color that
came and went as she spoke, in a way that at first puzzled Miss Lindsey
as to its brand and then in turn awed her as she decided it was the real
thing. The blue-silk triumph of Miss Elvira and "The Review" also
puzzled her for a moment, but she put it down to some little Fifth
Avenue shop that only débutantes and authors of plays could afford, and
took it in with delight at its exquisite detail.
</p><p>"I think it is a dandy play, as Mr. Farraday has been telling it to me.
Crooks and--and cut-ups are about done for," said Miss Lindsey. She gave
a quick glance at Mr. Farraday, to see if he resented the allusion to
Mr. Vandeford's recent failure.
</p><p>"Right-o!" agreed Mr. Farraday, with a sympathetic smile at her
allusion, which passed over the head of the lady from Adairville,
Kentucky.
</p><p>Then ensued more than a half-hour of the most enthusiastic discussion of
plays in general, and Miss Adair's in particular. Both Mr. Dennis
Farraday and Miss Mildred Lindsey were impressed with the fact that the
author of "The Renunciation of Rosalind" had learned her business from
the most erudite sources, and they talked Shakespeare and Fielding
until they at last wound themselves up into a complete pause.
</p><p>Miss Adair broke the strain.
</p><p>"I'm awfully hungry, and I don't know where to go to get something to
eat," she said, with exactly the same tone of confidence she had used in
asking old Jeff for a cold muffin in between the meals of her eighth
summer.
</p><p>"By Jove, we are all hungry! You girls come with me," exclaimed Mr.
Dennis Farraday, as he jumped to his feet and looked around for his hat.
</p><p>"Thank you, but I think I had better go home to--to see about--" Miss
Lindsey was faltering with the embarrassment of those who are both proud
and hungry, when food is offered them socially.
</p><p>"Nonsense! You are coming over to the Claridge with Miss Adair and me
for a bite. Then you can come back by here and see Dolph.--Dolph, make
out a check for Miss Lindsey's advance. Shall we say one or two hundred,
Miss Lindsey?" Dennis Farraday was in his element when doing the breezy
protective to two girls at once.
</p><p>"One hundred, please," answered Miss Lindsey, with color mounting to her
cheeks that underpainted that already there. She smiled with amusement
at the surprise that manifested itself for an instant on the round face
of Mr. Meyers that an actress should not "grab" all offered her and then
plead for more. "But I really do feel that I had better not--go to
luncheon, for I am--"
</p><p>"Please do! I'd rather you would," the eminent author urged, and she
clung to the show girl in a way that showed Dennis Farraday, accustomed
to the women of her world, that vague proprieties were hovering beside
the gates that were opening for Patricia from her old world into her
new.
</p><p>"You'll have to come, Miss Lindsey, to celebrate, or we shall think you
are not all for the play," Mr. Farraday said with a finality in his
voice that settled the matter.
</p><p>And the three of them scudded along a few blocks of the sun-steamed
streets into the coolness of the Claridge, also into the heart of a
situation that had been seething for an hour between Mr. Godfrey
Vandeford and Miss Violet Hawtry.
</p><p>"How wonderful of you, Van dear, to find me such a play at the eleventh
and three-quarters hour!" had been the volley that Violet had fired at
him.
</p><p>"Glad you like it," he had parried, feeling sure that she was jockeying
with him for position for the clinch.
</p><p>"Dennis Farraday told me that you were backing my emotional handling
even more than my comedy scenes. Could you for once be playing square
with me and really looking forward to my development in getting
this--this rather remarkable kind of a play for me?"
</p><p>"I've done my best for you for five years, Violet," he quietly answered
the insult, as he looked across the empty white tables that stretched
away from Violet's favorite and reserved seat in the black and gold
dining-room.
</p><p>"'Miss Cut-up,' for instance?"
</p><p>"There were several ways to put that play across. You had your way in
every particular. Mine might have succeeded," was his calm answer.
</p><p>"The really amusing thing about you is that you don't at all know how
little brains you have," was the polite broadside delivered him as
Violet began to sip the clear coffee from her cup.
</p><p>"Same to you," was the reply she received. Godfrey spoke in a
good-natured tone of voice. "Now, what did you come to town to talk
about--'The Purple Slipper'?"
</p><p>"Why did you leave Highcliff like a thief in the night?"
</p><p>"Did you read the deeds Dolph gave you when he went up to pack my
personal effects?"
</p><p>"Yes, thanks! I suppose you consider Highcliff the price of your
freedom?"
</p><p>"And cheap at that."
</p><p>"Then why not turn me over to Weiner?" Violet asked in a dangerous tone
of voice that made Mr. Vandeford glance around with apprehension to see
who would witness the explosion if it occurred.
</p><p>"I tried to buy Denny off yesterday, but you fastened 'The Purple
Slipper' firmly in his head, maybe his heart, the other evening, and it
would be like taking candy from a child. Maybe you can--can influence
him to let go--if I give you the chance." There was something coolly
insulting in his voice that told Violet he had surmised her intentions
and the failure of her assault on his big Jonathan.
</p><p>"Your usual impertinence! I'll get him yet, just to spite you. I'll go
in and play that 'Purple Slipper' to win, and--"
</p><p>"Again Miss Adair breaks in on enthusiasm for her play." Dennis
Farraday's big voice boomed right at the elbows of the embattled pair.
"Look who's here, Van!"
</p><p>Mr. Godfrey Vandeford looked up quickly, and as quickly rose to his
feet. And with one glance into slate-gray eyes behind long black
lashes--eyes filled with awed, worshipful gratitude to him--his heart
rose in his breast and all but flitted out upon his sleeve.
</p><p>"Miss Adair, Mr. Vandeford, the producer of your play," good Dennis
flourished. "And Miss Violet Hawtry! In fact, the whole happy family!"
