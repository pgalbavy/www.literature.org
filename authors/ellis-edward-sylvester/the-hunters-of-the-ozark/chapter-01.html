<p>One day in the autumn Terence Clark came to the house of Frederick
Linden and urged him to join in a hunt for a cow that had been
missing since the night before. The latter got the consent of
his mother and the two lads started on a search that proved to
be the most eventful one they had ever known.</p>

<p>A few words in the way of explanation must be given at this point.
The date of the events I have set out to tell was toward the close
of the last century, and the scene the south-western part of the
present State of Missouri, but which was then a part of the vast
territory known as Louisiana. Though the town of St. Louis had
been settled a good many years before, there were only a few pioneers
scattered through the almost limitless region that stretched in
every direction from the Mississippi. Here and there the hunters
and trappers were often absent from their homes for months at
a time, during which they suffered much exposure and hardship.
They slept for weeks in the open woods, or when the severity of
the weather would not allow this, they found refuge in caves or
hollow trees. Then, when enough skins had been gathered to load
their pack-horses they started on the long tramps to the French
trading post on the Mississippi. They followed faintly marked
paths or trails that converged from a score or hundred different
points until they reached the Father of Waters, where the peltries
were soon sold and the proceeds, too often, squandered within
the succeeding few hours.</p>

<p>At the date of which I am speaking, a small settlement known
as Greville stood in the south-western section of the large State
of Missouri, as it is now known. The first cabins were put up
only a few years before, and the settlers, including men, women
and children, numbered about two hundred. Near the center of the
straggling settlement stood a rude but strong blockhouse to be
used for refuge in the event of an attack by Indians. As yet this
emergency had not arisen, for the red men in that section were
far less warlike and hostile than those in Ohio and Kentucky.</p>

<p>The father of Fred Linden was one of the hunters and trappers
who made regular visits to the wild section near the Ozark Mountains
for the purpose of gathering furs. He never had less than two
companions, and sometimes the number was half a dozen. As you
are well aware, the furs of all animals are in the finest condition
in wintry weather, since nature does her best to guard their bodies
from the effects of cold. Thus it came about that the party of
hunters, of whom I shall have more to say further on, left Greville
in the autumn of the year, and as a rule were not seen again until
spring. Since they entered a fine, fur-bearing country, these
trips generally paid well. One convenience was that the hunters
were not obliged to go to St. Louis to sell them. An agent of
the great fur company that made its headquarters at that post,
came regularly to Greville with his pack-horses and gave the same
price for the peltries that he would have given had they been
brought to the factory, hundreds of miles away. He was glad to
do this, for the furs that George Linden and his brother hunters
brought in were not surpassed in glossiness and fineness by any
of the thousands gathered from the four points of the compass.</p>

<p>Among the daring little band that made these regular visits to
the Ozark region was an Irishman named Michael Clark, who had
had considerable experience in gathering furs along the Mississippi.
It was at his suggestion that Greville was founded, and one-half
of their periodical journeys thus cut off. On the year following,
Clark was shot and killed by a prowling Indian. Since his wife
had been dead a long time, the only child, Terence, was thus left
an orphan. The lad was a bright, good-natured fellow, liked by
every one, and he made his home with the family of one of the
other hunters named Rufus MacClaskey. The boy was fifteen years
old on the very day that he walked over to the cabin of Fred Linden
and asked him to help him hunt for the missing cow.</p>

<p>The family of George Linden, while he was away, consisted of
his wife, his daughter Edith, fourteen, and his son Fred, sixteen
years old. All were ruddy cheeked, strong and vigorous, and among
the best to do of the thirty-odd families that made up the population
of Greville.</p>

<p>"Has the cow ever been lost before?" asked Fred, as he and the
Irish lad swung along beside each other, neither thinking it worth
while to burden himself with a rifle.</p>

<p>"Niver that I knows of, and I would know the same if she had
been lost; we're onaisy about the cow, for you see that if this
kaaps on and she doesn't come back I'll have to live on something
else than bread and milk and praties."</p>

<p>"Our cow came back just at sunset last night."</p>

<p>"And so did them all, exciptin' our own, which makes me more
onwillin' to accipt any excuse she may have to give."</p>

<p>"Let me see, Terry; Brindle wore a bell round her neck, didn't
she?"</p>

<p>"That she did, and she seemed quite proud of the same."</p>

<p>"Did you make hunt for her last night?"</p>

<p>"I hunted as long as I could see to hunt; she wasn't missed,
that is till after they got home. Whin I found that I didn't find
her I started to find her; but I hadn't time to hunt very long
whin it got dark and I had to give it up."</p>

<p>"And didn't you hear any thing of the bell?"</p>

<p>"Do ye think that if I heard the bell I wouldn't have found the
cow? Why was the bell put round her neck if it wasn't to guide
friends? I listened many a time after it got dark, but niver a
tinkle did I hear."</p>

<p>"That is queer," said Fred half to himself; "for, when no wind
is blowing and it is calm, you can hear that bell a long ways;
father has caught the sound in the woods, when the Brindle was
all of a mile off. I wonder whether she could have lost the bell."</p>

<p>"I've thought of that, and said to meself that it might be also
that she had become lost herself in trying to find it."</p>

<p>Fred laughed.</p>

<p>"She hardly knows enough for <em>that</em>; and, if she found
the bell she wouldn't know what to do with it; but if that leathern
string around her neck had broken, it may be that she is close
by. A cow after losing one milking is apt to feel so uncomfortable
that she hurries home to be relieved; but what's the use of talking?"
added Fred, throwing up his head and stepping off at a more lively
pace; "we've started out to find her and that's all we have to
do."</p>

<p>Perhaps a dozen acres had been cleared around the little town
of Greville. This had been planted with corn, potatoes and grain,
though scores of unsightly stumps were left and interfered with
the cultivation of the soil. Beyond this clearing or open space
extended the immense forests which at one time covered almost
the entire face of our country. On the south side of the town
and distant a furlong wound a creek, which after many shiftings
and turnings found its way into the Mississippi and so at last
into the Gulf of Mexico. The course of this stream was so winding
that it extended on two sides of the town and ran in a westerly
direction, exactly the opposite of that it finally had to take
in order to reach its outlet.</p>

<p>As a rule, it was about twenty feet wide with a depth of from
one or two to six feet. It was subject to tremendous overflows
which sometimes tripled its volume and increased its width to
that of a river. At such times a series of enormous rocks through
which the creek at "low tide" lazily wound its way, lashed the
turbid current into a fury somewhat like that seen in the "whirlpool"
below Niagara. Could you have stood on the shore and looked at
the furiously struggling waters, you would have been sure that
even if a man were headed up in a barrel, he could not have lived
to pass through the hundred yards of rapids, though there was
reason to believe that more than one Indian had shot them in his
canoe.</p>

<p>Terry Clark told his friend that his search of the night before
and of the morning following had been to the north and west of
the settlement, so that it was hardly worth while to continue
the hunt in that direction. The cows sometimes stood in the water,
where so much switching of their tails was not needed to keep
away the flies, and, though there was quite a growth of succulent
grass on the clearing, the animals often crossed the creek and
browsed through the woods and undergrowth on the other side.</p>

<p>The boys were inclined to think that the brindle had taken that
course during the afternoon and had actually gone astray,&mdash;something
which a quadruped is less likely to do than a biped, though the
former will sometimes make the blunder. There was nothing unreasonable
in the theory that the bell had fallen from her neck and that
the owner therefore might be not far away.</p>

<p>At intervals, Terry shouted "<em>Bos! bos! bos!</em>" the Latin
call which the cow sometimes recognized, though she generally
paid no attention to it. It was the same now, possibly due to
the fact that she did not hear the call.</p>

<p>Reaching the edge of the stream, the boys began walking along
the bank toward the left and scrutinizing the spongy earth close
to the water. If the missing animal had crossed the creek she
could not have failed to leave distinct footprints.</p>
