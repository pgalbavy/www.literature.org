<p>On we flew, drawn by the mighty current, till at last I noticed that
the sound of the water was not half so deafening as it had been, and
concluded that this must be because there was more room for the echoes
to disperse in. I could now hear Alphonse’s howls much more distinctly;
they were made up of the oddest mixture of invocations to the Supreme
Power and the name of his beloved Annette that it is possible to
conceive; and, in short, though their evident earnestness saved them
from profanity, were, to say the least, very remarkable. Taking up a
paddle I managed to drive it into his ribs, whereon he, thinking that
the end had come, howled louder than ever. Then I slowly and cautiously
raised myself on my knees and stretched my hand upwards, but could touch
no roof. Next I took the paddle and lifted it above my head as high as
I could, but with the same result. I also thrust it out laterally to the
right and left, but could touch nothing except water. Then I bethought
me that there was in the boat, amongst our other remaining possessions,
a bull’s-eye lantern and a tin of oil. I groped about and found it, and
having a match on me carefully lit it, and as soon as the flame had got
a hold of the wick I turned it on down the boat. As it happened, the
first thing the light lit on was the white and scared face of Alphonse,
who, thinking that it was all over at last, and that he was witnessing
a preliminary celestial phenomenon, gave a terrific yell and was with
difficulty reassured with the paddle. As for the other three, Good was
lying on the flat of his back, his eyeglass still fixed in his eye, and
gazing blankly into the upper darkness. Sir Henry had his head resting
on the thwarts of the canoe, and with his hand was trying to test the
speed of the water. But when the beam of light fell upon old Umslopogaas
I could really have laughed. I think I have said that we had put a roast
quarter of water-buck into the canoe. Well, it so happened that when we
all prostrated ourselves to avoid being swept out of the boat and into
the water by the rock roof, Umslopogaas’s head had come down uncommonly
near this roast buck, and so soon as he had recovered a little from
the first shock of our position it occurred to him that he was hungry.
Thereupon he coolly cut off a chop with Inkosi-kaas, and was now
employed in eating it with every appearance of satisfaction. As he
afterwards explained, he thought that he was going ‘on a long journey’,
and preferred to start on a full stomach. It reminded me of the people
who are going to be hanged, and who are generally reported in the
English daily papers to have made ‘an excellent breakfast’.
</p>
<p>As soon as the others saw that I had managed to light the lamp, we
bundled Alphonse into the farther end of the canoe with a threat which
calmed him down wonderfully, that if he would insist upon making the
darkness hideous with his cries we would put him out of suspense by
sending him to join the Wakwafi and wait for Annette in another sphere,
and began to discuss the situation as well as we could. First, however,
at Good’s suggestion, we bound two paddles mast-fashion in the bows so
that they might give us warning against any sudden lowering of the
roof of the cave or waterway. It was clear to us that we were in an
underground river or, as Alphonse defined it, ‘main drain’, which
carried off the superfluous waters of the lake. Such rivers are well
known to exist in many parts of the world, but it has not often been the
evil fortune of explorers to travel by them. That the river was wide we
could clearly see, for the light from the bull’s-eye lantern failed to
reach from shore to shore, although occasionally, when the current swept
us either to one side or the other, we could distinguish the rock wall
of the tunnel, which, as far as we could make out, appeared to arch
about twenty-five feet above our heads. As for the current itself, it
ran, Good estimated, at least eight knots, and, fortunately for us, was,
as is usual, fiercest in the middle of the stream. Still, our first act
was to arrange that one of us, with the lantern and a pole there was in
the canoe, should always be in the bows ready, if possible, to prevent
us from being stove in against the side of the cave or any projecting
rock. Umslopogaas, having already dined, took the first turn. This was
absolutely, with one exception, all that we could do towards preserving
our safety. The exception was that another of us took up a position in
the stern with a paddle by means of which it was possible to steer the
canoe more or less and to keep her from the sides of the cave. These
matters attended to, we made a somewhat sparing meal off the cold buck’s
meat (for we did not know how long it might have to last us), and then
feeling in rather better spirits I gave my opinion that, serious as
it undoubtedly was, I did not consider our position altogether without
hope, unless, indeed, the natives were right, and the river plunged
straight down into the bowels of the earth. If not, it was clear that it
must emerge somewhere, probably on the other side of the mountains, and
in that case all we had to think of was to keep ourselves alive till
we got there, wherever ‘there’ might be. But, of course, as Good
lugubriously pointed out, on the other hand we might fall victims to
a hundred unsuspected horrors--or the river might go on winding away
inside the earth till it dried up, in which case our fate would indeed
be an awful one.
</p><p>‘Well, let us hope for the best and prepare ourselves for the worst,’
said Sir Henry, who is always cheerful and even spirited--a very tower
of strength in the time of trouble. ‘We have come out of so many queer
scrapes together, that somehow I almost fancy we shall come out of
this,’ he added.
</p><p>This was excellent advice, and we proceeded to take it each in our
separate way--that is, except Alphonse, who had by now sunk into a sort
of terrified stupor. Good was at the helm and Umslopogaas in the bows,
so there was nothing left for Sir Henry and myself to do except to lie
down in the canoe and think. It certainly was a curious, and indeed
almost a weird, position to be placed in--rushing along, as we were,
through the bowels of the earth, borne on the bosom of a Stygian river,
something after the fashion of souls being ferried by Charon, as Curtis
said. And how dark it was! The feeble ray from our little lamp did but
serve to show the darkness. There in the bows sat old Umslopogaas, like
Pleasure in the poem, {Endnote 9} watchful and untiring, the pole ready
to his hand, and behind in the shadow I could just make out the form
of Good peering forward at the ray of light in order to make out how
to steer with the paddle that he held and now and again dipped into the
water.
</p><p>‘Well, well,’ thought I, ‘you have come in search of adventures, Allan
my boy, and you have certainly got them. At your time of life, too! You
ought to be ashamed of yourself; but somehow you are not, and, awful as
it all is, perhaps you will pull through after all; and if you don’t,
why, you cannot help it, you see! And when all’s said and done an
underground river will make a very appropriate burying-place.’
</p><p>At first, however, I am bound to say that the strain upon the nerves was
very great. It is trying to the coolest and most experienced person not
to know from one hour to another if he has five minutes more to live,
but there is nothing in this world that one cannot get accustomed to,
and in time we began to get accustomed even to that. And, after all,
our anxiety, though no doubt natural, was, strictly speaking, illogical,
seeing that we never know what is going to happen to us the next minute,
even when we sit in a well-drained house with two policemen patrolling
under the window--nor how long we have to live. It is all arranged for
us, my sons, so what is the use of bothering?
</p><p>It was nearly midday when we made our dive into darkness, and we had set
our watch (Good and Umslopogaas) at two, having agreed that it should
be of a duration of five hours. At seven o’clock, accordingly, Sir Henry
and I went on, Sir Henry at the bow and I at the stern, and the other
two lay down and went to sleep. For three hours all went well, Sir Henry
only finding it necessary once to push us off from the side; and I that
but little steering was required to keep us straight, as the violent
current did all that was needed, though occasionally the canoe showed
a tendency which had to be guarded against to veer and travel broadside
on. What struck me as the most curious thing about this wonderful river
was: how did the air keep fresh? It was muggy and thick, no doubt,
but still not sufficiently so to render it bad or even remarkably
unpleasant. The only explanation that I can suggest is that the water of
the lake had sufficient air in it to keep the atmosphere of the tunnel
from absolute stagnation, this air being given out as it proceeded on
its headlong way. Of course I only give the solution of the mystery for
what it is worth, which perhaps is not much.
</p><p>When I had been for three hours or so at the helm, I began to notice a
decided change in the temperature, which was getting warmer. At first I
took no notice of it, but when, at the expiration of another half-hour,
I found that it was getting hotter and hotter, I called to Sir Henry and
asked him if he noticed it, or if it was only my imagination. ‘Noticed
it!’ he answered; ‘I should think so. I am in a sort of Turkish bath.’
Just about then the others woke up gasping, and were obliged to begin
to discard their clothes. Here Umslopogaas had the advantage, for he did
not wear any to speak of, except a moocha.
</p><p>Hotter it grew, and hotter yet, till at last we could scarcely breathe,
and the perspiration poured out of us. Half an hour more, and though we
were all now stark naked, we could hardly bear it. The place was like
an antechamber of the infernal regions proper. I dipped my hand into
the water and drew it out almost with a cry; it was nearly boiling. We
consulted a little thermometer we had--the mercury stood at 123 degrees.
From the surface of the water rose a dense cloud of steam. Alphonse
groaned out that we were already in purgatory, which indeed we were,
though not in the sense that he meant it. Sir Henry suggested that we
must be passing near the seat of some underground volcanic fire, and
I am inclined to think, especially in the light of what subsequently
occurred, that he was right. Our sufferings for some time after this
really pass my powers of description. We no longer perspired, for all
the perspiration had been sweated out of us. We simply lay in the
bottom of the boat, which we were now physically incapable of directing,
feeling like hot embers, and I fancy undergoing very much the same
sensations that the poor fish do when they are dying on land--namely,
that of slow suffocation. Our skins began to crack, and the blood to
throb in our heads like the beating of a steam-engine.
</p><p>This had been going on for some time, when suddenly the river turned
a little, and I heard Sir Henry call out from the bows in a hoarse,
startled voice, and, looking up, saw a most wonderful and awful thing.
About half a mile ahead of us, and a little to the left of the centre of
the stream--which we could now see was about ninety feet broad--a huge
pillar-like jet of almost white flame rose from the surface of the water
and sprang fifty feet into the air, when it struck the roof and spread
out some forty feet in diameter, falling back in curved sheets of fire
shaped like the petals of a full-blown rose. Indeed this awful gas jet
resembled nothing so much as a great flaming flower rising out of the
black water. Below was the straight stalk, a foot or more thick, and
above the dreadful bloom. And as for the fearfulness of it and its
fierce and awesome beauty, who can describe it? Certainly I cannot.
Although we were now some five hundred yards away, it, notwithstanding
the steam, lit up the whole cavern as clear as day, and we could see
that the roof was here about forty feet above us, and washed perfectly
smooth with water. The rock was black, and here and there I could make
out long shining lines of ore running through it like great veins, but
of what metal they were I know not.
</p><p>On we rushed towards this pillar of fire, which gleamed fiercer than any
furnace ever lit by man.
</p><p>‘Keep the boat to the right, Quatermain--to the right,’ shouted Sir
Henry, and a minute afterwards I saw him fall forward senseless.
Alphonse had already gone. Good was the next to go. There they lay as
though dead; only Umslopogaas and I kept our senses. We were within
fifty yards of it now, and I saw the Zulu’s head fall forward on his
hands. He had gone too, and I was alone. I could not breathe; the fierce
heat dried me up. For yards and yards round the great rose of fire the
rock-roof was red-hot. The wood of the boat was almost burning. I saw
the feathers on one of the dead swans begin to twist and shrivel up; but
I would not give in. I knew that if I did we should pass within three or
four yards of the gas jet and perish miserably. I set the paddle so as
to turn the canoe as far from it as possible, and held on grimly.
</p><p>My eyes seemed to be bursting from my head, and through my closed lids I
could see the fierce light. We were nearly opposite now; it roared like
all the fires of hell, and the water boiled furiously around it. Five
seconds more. We were past; I heard the roar behind me.
</p><p>Then I too fell senseless. The next thing that I recollect is feeling
a breath of air upon my face. My eyes opened with great difficulty. I
looked up. Far, far above me there was light, though around me was great
gloom. Then I remembered and looked. The canoe still floated down the
river, and in the bottom of it lay the naked forms of my companions.
‘Were they dead?’ I wondered. ‘Was I left alone in this awful place?’
I knew not. Next I became conscious of a burning thirst. I put my hand
over the edge of the boat into the water and drew it up again with a
cry. No wonder: nearly all the skin was burnt off the back of it. The
water, however, was cold, or nearly so, and I drank pints and splashed
myself all over. My body seemed to suck up the fluid as one may see a
brick wall suck up rain after a drought; but where I was burnt the touch
of it caused intense pain. Then I bethought myself of the others, and,
dragging myself towards them with difficulty, I sprinkled them with
water, and to my joy they began to recover--Umslopogaas first, then the
others. Next they drank, absorbing water like so many sponges. Then,
feeling chilly--a queer contrast to our recent sensations--we began as
best we could to get into our clothes. As we did so Good pointed to the
port side of the canoe: it was all blistered with heat, and in places
actually charred. Had it been built like our civilized boats, Good said
that the planks would certainly have warped and let in enough water to
sink us; but fortunately it was dug out of the soft, willowy wood of a
single great tree, and had sides nearly three inches and a bottom four
inches thick. What that awful flame was we never discovered, but I
suppose that there was at this spot a crack or hole in the bed of
the river through which a vast volume of gas forced its way from its
volcanic home in the bowels of the earth towards the upper air. How
it first became ignited is, of course, impossible to say--probably, I
should think, from some spontaneous explosion of mephitic gases.
</p><p>As soon as we had got some things together and shaken ourselves together
a little, we set to work to make out where we were now. I have said that
there was light above, and on examination we found that it came from the
sky. Our river that was, Sir Henry said, a literal realization of the
wild vision of the poet {Endnote 10}, was no longer underground, but
was running on its darksome way, not now through ‘caverns measureless to
man’, but between two frightful cliffs which cannot have been less than
two thousand feet high. So high were they, indeed, that though the sky
was above us, where we were was dense gloom--not darkness indeed, but
the gloom of a room closely shuttered in the daytime. Up on either side
rose the great straight cliffs, grim and forbidding, till the eye grew
dizzy with trying to measure their sheer height. The little space of
sky that marked where they ended lay like a thread of blue upon their
soaring blackness, which was unrelieved by any tree or creeper. Here
and there, however, grew ghostly patches of a long grey lichen, hanging
motionless to the rock as the white beard to the chin of a dead man. It
seemed as though only the dregs or heavier part of the light had sunk to
the bottom of this awful place. No bright-winged sunbeam could fall so
low: they died far, far above our heads.
</p><p>By the river’s edge was a little shore formed of round fragments of rock
washed into this shape by the constant action of water, and giving the
place the appearance of being strewn with thousands of fossil cannon
balls. Evidently when the water of the underground river is high there
is no beach at all, or very little, between the border of the stream
and the precipitous cliffs; but now there was a space of seven or eight
yards. And here, on this beach, we determined to land, in order to rest
ourselves a little after all that we had gone through and to stretch our
limbs. It was a dreadful place, but it would give an hour’s respite from
the terrors of the river, and also allow of our repacking and arranging
the canoe. Accordingly we selected what looked like a favourable spot,
and with some little difficulty managed to beach the canoe and scramble
out on to the round, inhospitable pebbles.
</p><p>‘My word,’ called out Good, who was on shore the first, ‘what an awful
place! It’s enough to give one a fit.’ And he laughed.
</p><p>Instantly a thundering voice took up his words, magnifying them a
hundred times. ‘_Give one a fit--Ho! ho! ho!’--‘A fit, Ho! ho! ho!_’
answered another voice in wild accents from far up the cliff--_a fit! a
fit! a fit!_ chimed in voice after voice--each flinging the words to
and fro with shouts of awful laughter to the invisible lips of the other
till the whole place echoed with the words and with shrieks of fiendish
merriment, which at last ceased as suddenly as they had begun.
</p><p>‘Oh, mon Dieu!’ yelled Alphonse, startled quite out of such self-command
as he possessed.
</p><p>‘_Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!_’ the Titanic echoes thundered,
shrieked, and wailed in every conceivable tone.
</p><p>‘Ah,’ said Umslopogaas calmly, ‘I clearly perceive that devils live
here. Well, the place looks like it.’
</p><p>I tried to explain to him that the cause of all the hubbub was a very
remarkable and interesting echo, but he would not believe it.
</p><p>‘Ah,’ he said, ‘I know an echo when I hear one. There was one lived
opposite my kraal in Zululand, and the Intombis [maidens] used to talk
with it. But if what we hear is a full-grown echo, mine at home can only
have been a baby. No, no--they are devils up there. But I don’t think
much of them, though,’ he added, taking a pinch of snuff. ‘They can
copy what one says, but they don’t seem to be able to talk on their
own account, and they dare not show their faces,’ and he relapsed into
silence, and apparently paid no further attention to such contemptible
fiends.
</p><p>After this we found it necessary to keep our conversation down to a
whisper--for it was really unbearable to have every word one uttered
tossed to and fro like a tennis-ball, as precipice called to precipice.
</p><p>But even our whispers ran up the rocks in mysterious murmurs till at
last they died away in long-drawn sighs of sound. Echoes are delightful
and romantic things, but we had more than enough of them in that
dreadful gulf.
</p><p>As soon as we had settled ourselves a little on the round stones, we
went on to wash and dress our burns as well as we could. As we had but a
little oil for the lantern, we could not spare any for this purpose,
so we skinned one of the swans, and used the fat off its breast, which
proved an excellent substitute. Then we repacked the canoe, and finally
began to take some food, of which I need scarcely say we were in need,
for our insensibility had endured for many hours, and it was, as our
watches showed, midday. Accordingly we seated ourselves in a circle, and
were soon engaged in discussing our cold meat with such appetite as we
could muster, which, in my case at any rate, was not much, as I felt
sick and faint after my sufferings of the previous night, and had
besides a racking headache. It was a curious meal. The gloom was so
intense that we could scarcely see the way to cut our food and convey
it to our mouths. Still we got on pretty well, till I happened to look
behind me--my attention being attracted by a noise of something crawling
over the stones, and perceived sitting upon a rock in my immediate rear
a huge species of black freshwater crab, only it was five times the size
of any crab I ever saw. This hideous and loathsome-looking animal had
projecting eyes that seemed to glare at one, very long and flexible
antennae or feelers, and gigantic claws. Nor was I especially favoured
with its company. From every quarter dozens of these horrid brutes were
creeping up, drawn, I suppose, by the smell of the food, from between
the round stones and out of holes in the precipice. Some were already
quite close to us. I stared quite fascinated by the unusual sight, and
as I did so I saw one of the beasts stretch out its huge claw and give
the unsuspecting Good such a nip behind that he jumped up with a howl,
and set the ‘wild echoes flying’ in sober earnest. Just then, too,
another, a very large one, got hold of Alphonse’s leg, and declined
to part with it, and, as may be imagined, a considerable scene ensued.
Umslopogaas took his axe and cracked the shell of one with the flat of
it, whereon it set up a horrid screaming which the echoes multiplied
a thousandfold, and began to foam at the mouth, a proceeding that drew
hundreds more of its friends out of unsuspected holes and corners.
Those on the spot perceiving that the animal was hurt fell upon it like
creditors on a bankrupt, and literally rent it limb from limb with their
huge pincers and devoured it, using their claws to convey the fragments
to their mouths. Seizing whatever weapons were handy, such as stones
or paddles, we commenced a war upon the monsters--whose numbers were
increasing by leaps and bounds, and whose stench was overpowering.
So fast as we cracked their armour others seized the injured ones and
devoured them, foaming at the mouth, and screaming as they did so. Nor
did the brutes stop at that. When they could they nipped hold of us--and
awful nips they were--or tried to steal the meat. One enormous fellow
got hold of the swan we had skinned and began to drag it off. Instantly
a score of others flung themselves upon the prey, and then began a
ghastly and disgusting scene. How the monsters foamed and screamed, and
rent the flesh, and each other! It was a sickening and unnatural sight,
and one that will haunt all who saw it till their dying day--enacted as
it was in the deep, oppressive gloom, and set to the unceasing music of
the many-toned nerve-shaking echoes. Strange as it may seem to say
so, there was something so shockingly human about these fiendish
creatures--it was as though all the most evil passions and desires of
man had got into the shell of a magnified crab and gone mad. They were
so dreadfully courageous and intelligent, and they looked as if they
<u>understood</u>. The whole scene might have furnished material for another
canto of Dante’s ‘Inferno’, as Curtis said.
</p>
<p>‘I say, you fellows, let’s get out of this or we shall all go off our
heads,’ sung out Good; and we were not slow to take the hint. Pushing
the canoe, around which the animals were now crawling by hundreds and
making vain attempts to climb, off the rocks, we bundled into it and got
out into mid-stream, leaving behind us the fragments of our meal and the
screaming, foaming, stinking mass of monsters in full possession of the
ground.
</p><p>‘Those are the devils of the place,’ said Umslopogaas with the air of
one who has solved a problem, and upon my word I felt almost inclined to
agree with him.
</p><p>Umslopogaas’ remarks were like his axe--very much to the point.
</p><p>‘What’s to be done next?’ said Sir Henry blankly.
</p><p>‘Drift, I suppose,’ I answered, and we drifted accordingly. All the
afternoon and well into the evening we floated on in the gloom beneath
the far-off line of blue sky, scarcely knowing when day ended and night
began, for down in that vast gulf the difference was not marked, till
at length Good pointed out a star hanging right above us, which, having
nothing better to do, we observed with great interest. Suddenly it
vanished, the darkness became intense, and a familiar murmuring sound
filled the air. ‘Underground again,’ I said with a groan, holding up the
lamp. Yes, there was no doubt about it. I could just make out the roof.
The chasm had come to an end and the tunnel had recommenced. And then
there began another long, long night of danger and horror. To describe
all its incidents would be too wearisome, so I will simply say that
about midnight we struck on a flat projecting rock in mid-stream and
were as nearly as possible overturned and drowned. However, at last we
got off, and went upon the uneven tenor of our way. And so the hours
passed till it was nearly three o’clock. Sir Henry, Good, and Alphonse
were asleep, utterly worn out; Umslopogaas was at the bow with the pole,
and I was steering, when I perceived that the rate at which we
were travelling had perceptibly increased. Then, suddenly, I heard
Umslopogaas make an exclamation, and next second came a sound as of
parting branches, and I became aware that the canoe was being forced
through hanging bushes or creepers. Another minute, and the breath of
sweet open air fanned my face, and I felt that we had emerged from the
tunnel and were floating upon clear water. I say felt, for I could
see nothing, the darkness being absolutely pitchy, as it often is just
before the dawn. But even this could scarcely damp my joy. We were out
of that dreadful river, and wherever we might have got to this at least
was something to be thankful for. And so I sat down and inhaled the
sweet night air and waited for the dawn with such patience as I could
command.
