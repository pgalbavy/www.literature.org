TO<br>
THE MEMORY OF<br>
Aunt Mary Lawson<br>
WHO TOLD ME MANY OF THE TALES<br>
REPEATED BY THE<br>
STORY GIRL
<P>

Once upon a time we all walked on the golden road.  It was a fair
highway, through the Land of Lost Delight; shadow and sunshine
were blessedly mingled, and every turn and dip revealed a fresh
charm and a new loveliness to eager hearts and unspoiled eyes.
<P>
On that road we heard the song of morning stars; we drank in
fragrances aerial and sweet as a May mist; we were rich in
gossamer fancies and iris hopes; our hearts sought and found the
boon of dreams; the years waited beyond and they were very fair;
life was a rose-lipped comrade with purple flowers dripping from
her fingers.
<P>
We may long have left the golden road behind, but its memories are
the dearest of our eternal possessions; and those who cherish them
as such may haply find a pleasure in the pages of this book, whose
people are pilgrims on the golden road of youth.
