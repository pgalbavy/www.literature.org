<p><em>JULIUS </em>sprang up.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I thought you were aware of that."</p>

<p>"When did she leave?"</p>

<p>"Let me see. To-day is Monday, is it not? It must have been last
Wednesday&mdash;why, surely&mdash;yes, it was the same evening that you&mdash;er&mdash;fell
out of my tree."</p>

<p>"That evening? Before, or after?"</p>

<p>"Let me see&mdash;oh yes, afterwards. A very urgent message arrived
from Mrs. Vandemeyer. The young lady and the nurse who was in
charge of her left by the night train."</p>

<p>Julius sank back again into his chair.</p>

<p>"Nurse Edith&mdash;left with a patient &mdash;I remember," he muttered.
"My God, to have been so near!"</p>

<p>Dr. Hall looked bewildered.</p>

<p>"I don’t understand. Is the young lady not with her aunt, after
all?"</p>

<p>Tuppence shook her head. She was about to speak when a warning
glance from Sir James made her hold her tongue. The lawyer rose.</p>

<p>"I’m much obliged to you, Hall. We’re very grateful for all you’ve
told us. I’m afraid we’re now in the position of having to track
Miss Vandemeyer anew. What about the nurse who accompanied her;
I suppose you don’t know where she is?"</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>"We’ve not heard from her, as it happens. I understood she was
to remain with Miss Vandemeyer for a while. But what can have
happened? Surely the girl has not been kidnapped."</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen," said Sir James gravely.</p>

<p>The other hesitated.</p>

<p>"You do not think I ought to go to the police?"</p>

<p>"No, no. In all probability the young lady is with other relations."</p>

<p>The doctor was not completely satisfied, but he saw that Sir
James was determined to say no more, and realized that to try
and extract more information from the famous <em>K.C. </em>would
be mere waste of labour. Accordingly, he wished them goodbye,
and they left the hotel. For a few minutes they stood by the car
talking.</p>

<p>"How maddening," cried Tuppence. "To think that Julius must have
been actually under the same roof with her for a few hours."</p>

<p>"I was a darned idiot," muttered Julius gloomily.</p>

<p>"You couldn’t know," Tuppence consoled him. "Could he?" She appealed
to Sir James.</p>

<p>"I should advise you not to worry," said the latter kindly. "No
use crying over spilt milk, you know."</p>

<p>"The great thing is what to do next," added Tuppence the practical.</p>

<p>Sir James shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"You might advertise for the nurse who accompanied the girl.
That is the only course I can suggest, and I must confess I do
not hope for much result. Otherwise there is nothing to be done."</p>

<p>"Nothing?" said Tuppence blankly. "And &mdash;Tommy?"</p>

<p>"We must hope for the best," said Sir James. "Oh yes, we must
go on hoping."</p>

<p>But over her downcast head his eyes met Julius’s, and almost
imperceptibly he shook his head. Julius understood. The lawyer
considered the case hopeless. The young American’s face grew grave.
Sir James took Tuppence’s hand.</p>

<p>"You must let me know if anything further comes to light. Letters
will always be forwarded."</p>

<p>Tuppence stared at him blankly.</p>

<p>"You are going away?"</p>

<p>"I told you. Don’t you remember? To Scotland."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I thought&#11834;" The girl hesitated.</p>

<p>Sir James shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"My dear young lady, I can do nothing more, I fear. Our clues
have all ended in thin air. You can take my word for it that there
is nothing more to be done. If anything should arise, I shall
be glad to advise you in any way I can."</p>

<p>His words gave Tuppence an extraordinarily desolate feeling.</p>

<p>"I suppose you’re right," she said. "Anyway, thank you very much
for trying to help us. Good-bye."</p>

<p>Julius was bending over the car. A momentary pity came into Sir
James’s keen eyes, as he gazed into the girl’s downcast face.</p>

<p>"Don’t be too disconsolate, Miss Tuppence," he said in a low
voice. "Remember, holiday-time isn’t always all playtime. One
sometimes manages to put in some work as well."</p>

<p>Something in his tone made Tuppence glance up sharply. He shook
his head with a smile.</p>

<p>"No, I shan’t say any more. Great mistake to say too much. Remember
that. Never tell all you know&mdash;not even to the person you know
best. Understand? Good-bye."</p>

<p>He strode away. Tuppence stared after him. She was beginning
to understand Sir James’s methods. Once before he had thrown her
a hint in the same careless fashion. Was this a hint? What exactly
lay behind those last brief words? Did he mean that, after all,
he had not abandoned the case; that, secretly, he would be working
on it still while&#11834;</p>

<p>Her meditations were interrupted by Julius, who adjured her to
"get right in."</p>

<p>"You’re looking kind of thoughtful," he remarked as they started
off. "Did the old guy say anything more?"</p>

<p>Tuppence opened her mouth impulsively, and then shut it again.
Sir James’s words sounded in her ears: "Never tell all you know&mdash;not
even to the person you know best." And like a flash there came
into her mind another memory. Julius before the safe in the flat,
her own question and the pause before his reply, "Nothing." Was
there really nothing? Or had he found something he wished to keep
to himself? If he could make a reservation, so could she.</p>

<p>"Nothing particular," she replied.</p>

<p>She felt rather than saw Julius throw a sideways glance at her.</p>

<p>"Say, shall we go for a spin in the park?"</p>

<p>"If you like."</p>

<p>For a while they ran on under the trees in silence. It was a
beautiful day. The keen rush through the air brought a new exhilaration
to Tuppence.</p>

<p>"Say, Miss Tuppence, do you think I’m ever going to find Jane?"</p>

<p>Julius spoke in a discouraged voice. The mood was so alien to
him that Tuppence turned and stared at him in surprise. He nodded.</p>

<p>"That’s so. I’m getting down and out over the business. Sir James
to-day hadn’t got any hope at all, I could see that. I don’t like
him&mdash;we don’t gee together somehow&mdash;but he’s pretty cute, and
I guess he wouldn’t quit if there was any chance of success&mdash;now,
would he?"</p>

<p>Tuppence felt rather uncomfortable, but clinging to her belief
that Julius also had withheld something from her, she remained
firm.</p>

<p>"He suggested advertising for the nurse," she reminded him.</p>

<p>"Yes, with a ‘forlorn hope’ flavour to his voice! No &mdash;I’m
about fed up. I’ve half a mind to go back to the States right
away."</p>

<p>"Oh no!" cried Tuppence. "We’ve got to find Tommy."</p>

<p>"I sure forgot Beresford," said Julius contritely. "That’s so.
We must find him. But after&mdash;well, I’ve been day-dreaming ever
since I started on this trip&mdash;and these dreams are rotten poor
business. I’m quit of them. Say, Miss Tuppence, there’s something
I’d like to ask you."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"You and Beresford. What about it?"</p>

<p>"I don’t understand you," replied Tuppence with dignity, adding
rather inconsequently: "And, anyway, you’re wrong!"</p>

<p>"Not got a sort of kindly feeling for one another?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Tuppence with warmth. "Tommy and I are
friends&mdash;nothing more."</p>

<p>"I guess every pair of lovers has said that sometime or another," 
observed Julius.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" snapped Tuppence. "Do I look the sort of girl that’s
always falling in love with every man she meets?"</p>

<p>"You do not. You look the sort of girl that’s mighty often getting
fallen in love with!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Tuppence, rather taken aback. "That’s a compliment,
I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Now let’s get down to this. Supposing we never find Beresford
and&mdash;and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;say it! I can face facts. Supposing he’s&mdash;dead! Well?"</p>

<p>"And all this business fiddles out. What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know," said Tuppence forlornly.</p>

<p>"You’ll be darned lonesome, you poor kid."</p>

<p>"I shall be all right," snapped Tuppence with her usual resentment
of any kind of pity.</p>

<p>"What about marriage?" inquired Julius. "Got any views on the
subject?"</p>

<p>"I intend to marry, of course," replied Tuppence. "That is, if"&mdash;she
paused, knew a momentary longing to draw back, and then stuck
to her guns bravely&mdash;"I can find some one rich enough to make
it worth my while. That’s frank, isn’t it? I dare say you despise
me for it."</p>

<p>"I never despise business instinct," said Julius. "What particular
figure have you in mind?"</p>

<p>"Figure?" asked Tuppence, puzzled. "Do you mean tall or short?"</p>

<p>"No. Sum&mdash;income."</p>

<p>"Oh, I &mdash;I haven’t quite worked that out."</p>

<p>"What about me?"</p>

<p><em>"You?"</em></p>

<p>"Sure thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn’t!"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I tell you I couldn’t."</p>

<p>"Again, why not?"</p>

<p>"It would seem so unfair."</p>

<p>"I don’t see anything unfair about it. I call your bluff, that’s
all. I admire you immensely, Miss Tuppence, more than any girl
I’ve ever met. You’re so darned plucky. I’d just love to give
you a real, rattling good time. Say the word, and we’ll run round
right away to some high-class jeweller, and fix up the ring business."</p>

<p>"I can’t," gasped Tuppence.</p>

<p>"Because of Beresford?"</p>

<p>"No, no, <em>no!</em>"</p>

<p>"Well then?"</p>

<p>Tuppence merely continued to shake her head violently.</p>

<p>"You can’t reasonably expect more dollars than I’ve got."</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn’t that," gasped Tuppence with an almost hysterical
laugh. "But thanking you very much, and all that, I think I’d
better say no."</p>

<p>"I’d be obliged if you’d do me the favour to think it over until
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"It’s no use."</p>

<p>"Still, I guess we’ll leave it like that."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Tuppence meekly.</p>

<p>Neither of them spoke again until they reached the <em>Ritz</em>.</p>

<p>Tuppence went upstairs to her room. She felt morally battered
to the ground after her conflict with Julius’s vigorous personality.
Sitting down in front of the glass, she stared at her own reflection
for some minutes.</p>

<p>"Fool," murmured Tuppence at length, making a grimace. "Little
fool. Everything you want&mdash;everything you’ve ever hoped for, and
you go and bleat out ‘no’ like an idiotic little sheep. It’s your
one chance. Why don’t you take it? Grab it? Snatch at it? What
more do you want?"</p>

<p>As if in answer to her own question, her eyes fell on a small
snapshot of Tommy that stood on her dressing-table in a shabby
frame. For a moment she struggled for self-control, and then abandoning
all presence, she held it to her lips and burst into a fit of
sobbing.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tommy, Tommy," she cried, "I do love you so&mdash;and I may never
see you again...."</p>

<p>At the end of five minutes Tuppence sat up, blew her nose, and
pushed back her hair.</p>

<p>"That’s that," she observed sternly. "Let’s look facts in the
face. I seem to have fallen in love&mdash;with an idiot of a boy who
probably doesn’t care two straws about me." Here she paused. "Anyway,"
she resumed, as though arguing with an unseen opponent, "I don’t
<em>know</em> that he does. He’d never have dared to say so. I’ve
always jumped on sentiment&mdash;and here I am being more sentimental
than anybody. What idiots girls are! I’ve always thought so. I
suppose I shall sleep with his photograph under my pillow, and
dream about him all night. It’s dreadful to feel you’ve been false
to your principles."</p>

<p>Tuppence shook her head sadly, as she reviewed her backsliding.</p>

<p>"I don’t know what to say to Julius, I’m sure. Oh, what a fool
I feel! I’ll have to say <em>something</em>&mdash;he’s so American
and thorough, he’ll insist upon having a reason. I wonder if he
did find anything in that safe&#11834;"</p>

<p>Tuppence’s meditations went off on another tack. She reviewed
the events of last night carefully and persistently. Somehow,
they seemed bound up with Sir James’s enigmatical words....</p>

<p>Suddenly she gave a great start&mdash;the colour faded out of her
face. Her eyes, fascinated, gazed in front of her, the pupils
dilated.</p>

<p>"Impossible," she murmured. "Impossible! I must be going mad
even to think of such a thing...."</p>

<p>Monstrous&mdash;yet it explained everything....</p>

<p>After a moment’s reflection she sat down and wrote a note, weighing
each word as she did so. Finally she nodded her head as though
satisfied, and slipped it into an envelope which she addressed
to Julius. She went down the passage to his sitting-room and knocked
at the door. As she had expected, the room was empty. She left
the note on the table.</p>

<p>A small page-boy was waiting outside her own door when she returned
to it.</p>

<p>"Telegram for you, miss."</p>

<p>Tuppence took it from the salver, and tore it open carelessly.
Then she gave a cry. The telegram was from Tommy!</p>
