<p>It was not yet dawn, though a few birds sang in the darkness
around us, as Sir William and I set off for the Cayuga's lodge,
which stood beyond the town on a rocky knoll, partly cleared of
trees.</p>

<p>The air was cold and without fragrance, for in our country it
is the sun that draws the earth's sweetness in early spring.</p>

<p>The stars lighted us through the streets of Johnstown, empty
of life save for the muffled watchman dozing in his own lanthorn
glow, who roused as he heard us, and shook his damp cloak. And
far behind us we heard his sing-song:</p>

<p>"Four o'clock! A cold, fair morn, and all well!"</p>

<p>One inn there was, where the dim bush swung wet and sleek as
a clinging bat, and where stale embers of the night's revelry
still flickered; for, behind the lighted windows, men were singing,
and we heard them as we passed:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Oh, we're all dry<br/>
Wi' drinking on't&mdash;<br/>
We're all dry<br/>
Wi' drinking on't.<br/>
The piper kissed<br/>
The fiddler's wife;<br/>
And I can't sleep<br/>
For thinking on't!"

</p>
</div>
<p>"Starbuck's Inn," muttered Sir William, grimly. "He's a Boston
man; they drink no tea there."</p>

<p>And, as we strode on in the darkness, behind us, from the lighted
hostelry, came a husky echo of that foolish catch:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Diddle diddle dumpling,<br/>
My son John&mdash;"

</p>
</div>
<p>So I knew that my buckskin birds were still chirping among us.</p>

<p>But now we were on the stony way and the town sank below us as
we climbed towards Quider's lodge, knee-deep in dewy thistles.</p>

<p>The spark of a tiny council fire guided us. Coming nearer we
smelled black birch burning, and we saw the long thread of aromatic
smoke mounting steadily to the paling stars.</p>

<p>We passed a young basswood-tree from which hung a flint, symbol
of the Mohawks. From another chestnut-sapling dangled the symbol
of the Cayugas, a pipe. All at once we saw Quider, standing motionless
before his lodge.</p>

<p>Sir William drew flint and tinder from his pouch, and sent a
spark flying into the dry tobacco of his pipe. He drew it to a
long glow, twice, and passed it, through the smoke of the fire,
to Quider.</p>

<p>I saw the Cayuga's face then. It was a strange red, yet it was
not painted. He seemed ill; his eyes glittered like the eyes of
a lynx.</p>

<p>And now, as the Indian sank down into his blanket before the
fire, Sir William produced a belt from the folds of his cloak
and held it out. The belt was black with two figures woven in
white on it. The hands of the figures were clasped together. It
was a chain-belt.</p>

<p>"<em>Brother</em>," he said, slowly: "The clouds which hang over
us prevent us from seeing the sun. It is, therefore, our business,
with this belt, to clear the sky. And we also, with this belt,
set the sun in its proper course, so that we may be enabled to
see the narrow path of peace."</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
(<em>Gives the belt.</em>)

</p>
</div>
<p>"<em>Brother</em>: We have heard what you have said about Colonel
Cresap; we believe he has been misled, and we have rekindled the
council fire at Johnstown with embers from Onondaga, with embers
from the Ohio, with coals from our proper fireplace at Mount Johnson.</p>

<p>"We uncover these fires to summon our wisest men so that they
shall judge what word shall be sent to Colonel Cresap, to secure
you in your treaty rights which I have sworn to protect by these
strings!"</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

(<em>A bunch of strings.</em>)

</p>
</div>
<p>"<em>Brother</em>: By this third and last belt I send peace and
love to my brethren of the Cayuga; and by this belt I bid them
be patient, and remember that I have never broken my word to those
within the Long House, nor yet to those who dwell without the
doors."</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

(<em>A large black belt of seven rows.</em>)

</p>
</div>
<p>Then Sir William drew from his girdle a belt of wampum, so white
that, in the starlight, it shimmered like virgin silver.</p>

<p>"Who mourns?" asked Sir William, gently, and the Indian rose
and answered: "We mourn&mdash;we of the Cayuga&mdash;we of three clans."</p>

<p>"What clans shall be raised up?" asked Sir William.</p>

<p>"Three clans lie stricken: the Wolf, the Plover, the Eel. Who
shall raise them?"</p>

<p>"<em>Brother</em>," said Sir William, gravely. "With this belt
I raise three clans; I cleanse their eyes, their ears, their mouths,
their bodies with clean water. With this belt I clear their path
so that no longer shall the dead stand in your way or in ours."</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

(<em>A great white belt.</em>)

</p>
</div>
<p>In the dead stillness that followed the northern hill-tops slowly
turned to pink and ashes. The day had dawned.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>When again we reached the village cocks were crowing in every
yard; the painted weather-vanes glowed in the sun; legions of
birds sang.</p>

<p>From Starbuck's Inn stumbled forth a blinking, soiled, and tipsy
company, linking arms, sidling, shoving, lurching, and bawling:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Oh, we're all dry<br/>
Wi' drinkin' on't!"

</p>
</div>
<p>And I plainly saw my two coureurs-de-bois, boozy as owls, a-bussing
the landlord's greasy wench while mine host pummelled them lustily,
foot and fist.</p>

<p>So on through the cold shadowy street and out into the sun-warmed
road again, and at last to the Hall where, on the sunny porch,
stood Silver Heels, hair in her eyes, her naked white feet in
moccasins, washing her cheeks in the dew.</p>

<p>"Tut! tut!" cried Sir William, sharply. "What foolishness is
this, Felicity? Off to bed! with your bare legs!"</p>

<p>"Betty said that beauty grew with dew-baths at dawn," said Silver
Heels, coolly. "I have bathed my limbs and my body in the grass
and I'm all over leaves."</p>

<p>"Betty's a fool! Be off to bed!&mdash;you little baggage!" cried Sir
William. And away up-stairs scampered Silver Heels, dropping both
moccasins in her flight.</p>

<p>"Betty! Betty!" fumed Sir William. "I'll Betty her, the black
witch!" And he stamped off to the nursery, muttering threats which
I knew would never be fulfilled.</p>

<p>That day Sir William sat in his library writing with Mr. Butler,
so there was no school, and Peter, Esk, Silver Heels, and I went
a-fishing in the river. And I did not wear my uniform, for fear
of soiling.</p>

<p>All day long, as we sat in the grass to watch our poles a-quiver,
horsemen from our stables passed us, galloping east and south,
doubtless bearing letters from Sir William to Albany and New York&mdash;and
farther south, perchance&mdash;for there came one rider with six soldiers
in escort, and two led horses well packed, all trotting and clattering
away towards the Fort Pitt trail.</p>

<p>That day was the last of the old days for us; but how could we
suspect that, as we waded in the shallows there, laughing, chattering,
splashing each other, and quarrelling to our hearts' content.
The familiar river, which every freshet changed just enough to
sharpen our eyes for new pools, slipped over its smooth golden
stones, inviting our dusty feet. Up to our knees we moved in the
ice-cold stream, climbing out on the banks at times to warm our
legs in the sun, and lie deep in the daisies, winking at the swallows
in the sky.</p>

<p>We played all our old games again&mdash;but that we played them for
the last time, none of us suspected. I held a buttercup under
Silver Heels's snowy chin to prove her love for cheese; I played
buzzing bee-songs on grass-blades; I whittled whistles for Peter
and Esk; I skipped flat stones; I coloured Silver Heels's toes
yellow with dandelion juice so she should ever afterwards wade
in gold&mdash;this at her own desire.</p>

<p>Twice those tiny spotted lady-beetles perched on my hand, and
Silver Heels, to ward off threatening evil, took them on the pink
tip of her little finger, repeating:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Lady-bird, Lady-bird, fly away home!<br/>
Thy lodge is afire! thy babies will burn!"

</p>
</div>
<p>Which she said would save me from torture at the stake some day.</p>

<p>The late sun settled in the blue ashes of the western forests
as we pulled on our stockings and moccasins and gathered up our
strings of silvery fish.</p>

<p>For a whole day I had carefully forgotten that I was anything
but a comrade to these children; but I did not know how wise I
had been to lay by, in my memory, one more perfect day ere the
evil days came and the years drew nigh wherein, God wot! I found
no pleasure.</p>

<p>Silver Heels and I walked back together through the evening glow,
and I remember that the windows of our house were all on fire
from the sun as we climbed the hill under the splendour of the
western sky.</p>

<p>As we came through the orchard I saw Sir William sitting on the
stone seat near the bee-hives. His chin had fallen on his chest,
both hands rested on his cane, and over his body fell the glory
of the red sky.</p>

<p>He heard us as we came through the orchard, and he raised his
head to smile a welcome. But there was that in his eyes which
told me to stay there with him after the others had trooped in
to be fed, and I waited.</p>

<p>Presently he said: "Quider is sick. Did you discover anything
in his face that might betoken&mdash;a&mdash;a fever?"</p>

<p>"His eyes," I said.</p>

<p>"Was he blotched? My sight is dim these years."</p>

<p>"His face was over-red," I answered, wondering.</p>

<p>Sir William said nothing more. After a little while he rose,
leaning on his cane, and passed heavily under the fruit-trees
towards the house.</p>

<p>That night came our doctor, Pierson, galloping from the village
with an urgent message for Sir William. Later I saw soldiers set
out with bayonets on their muskets, and, with them, the doctor,
leading his horse.</p>

<p>In the morning we knew that the small-pox had seized the Cayuga,
and that our soldiers patrolled Quider's lodge to warn all men
of the black pest.</p>

<p>The days which followed were busy days for us all&mdash;days fraught
with bustle and perplexity&mdash;hours which hurried on, crowding one
on another like pages turning in a book&mdash;turning too swiftly for
me to cipher the ominous text.</p>

<p>All Sir William's hopes of averting war were now centred in the
stricken Cayuga. He and I haunted the neighbourhood of Quider's
lodge, staring for hours at the silent hut in the clearing, or,
rambling by starlight, we watched the candle burning in the lodge
door as though it were the flame of life, now flaring, now sinking
in its socket.</p>

<p>On such rambles he seldom spoke, but sometimes he leaned on my
shoulder as we walked, and his very hand seemed burdened with
the weight of his cares.</p>

<p>Once, however, when from the sentinels we learned that Quider
might live, Sir William appeared almost gay, and we walked to
a little hill, all silvery in the light of the young moon, and
rested on a rock.</p>

<p>"Black Care rides behind the horseman, but &mdash;I have dismounted,"
he said, lightly. "Quider will live, I warrant you, barring those
arrows of outrageous fortune of which you have doubtless heard,
Michael."</p>

<p>"What may those same arrows be marked with?" I asked, innocently.</p>

<p>"With the totem of Kismet, my boy."</p>

<p>I did not know that totem, and said so, whereupon he fell a-laughing
and pinched my cheek, saying, "Are there no people in the world
but the Six Nations of the Long House?"</p>

<p>I answered cautiously: "Oe-yen-de-hit Sar-a-ta-ke," meaning,
"there are favourable signs (of people) where the tracks of (their)
heels may be seen. I have not travelled; there may be other tracks
in the world."</p>

<p>"Ten-ca-re Ne-go-ni," replied Sir William, gravely. "He scatters
His people everywhere, Michael. The world lies outside of the
Long House!"</p>

<p>"I shall say to the world I come from Ko-lan-e-ka, and that I
am kin to you, sir," said I, dropping easily into that intimate
dialect we children often used together, or in the family circle.</p>

<p>"The world will say: 'He comes from Da-o-sa-no-geh, the place
without a name; let him return to The-ya-o-guin, the Gray-Haired,
who sent him out so ignorant.'"</p>

<p>"Do you say that, sir, because I am ignorant of the poets?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Even women know the poets in these days," he said, smiling.
"You would not wish to know less than your own wife, would you?"</p>

<p>"My wife!" I exclaimed, scornfully.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Sir William, much amused; "you will marry one
day, I suppose."</p>

<p>After a moment I said:</p>

<p>"Is Silver Heels going to marry Mr. Butler?"</p>

<p>"I hope so," replied Sir William, a little surprised. "Mr. Butler
is a gentleman of culture and wealth. Felicity has no large dower,
and I can leave but little if I provide for all my children. I
deem it most fortunate that Captain Butler has spoken to me."</p>

<p>"If," said I, slowly, "Silver Heels and I are obliged to marry
somebody, why can we not marry each other?"</p>

<p>Sir William stared at me.</p>

<p>"Are you in love with Felicity?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir!" I cried, resentfully.</p>

<p>"Is she&mdash;does she fancy she is in love with you?" insisted Sir
William, in growing astonishment.</p>

<p>"No! no!" I said, hastily, for his question annoyed and irritated
me. "But I only don't want her to marry Mr. Butler; I'd even be
willing to marry her myself, though I once saw a maid in Albany&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What the devil is all this damned nonsense?" cried Sir William,
testily. "What d'ye mean by this idiot's babble? Eh?"</p>

<p>The expression of my face at this outburst first disconcerted,
then sent him into a roar of laughter. Such startled and injured
innocence softened his impatience; he carefully explained to me
that, as Felicity had no fortune, and I barely sufficient to sustain
me, such a match could but prove a sorry and foolish one for Silver
Heels and for me.</p>

<p>"If you were older," he said, "and if you loved each other, I
should, perhaps, be weak enough not to interfere, though wisdom
prompted. But it is best that Felicity should wed Mr. Butler,
and that as soon as may be, for I am growing old very fast, older
than I care to confess, older than I dare believe. This I say
to you, for I have come to trust you and to lean on you, Michael;
but you must never hint to others that I complain of age or feebleness.
Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I answered, soberly.</p>

<p>"Besides," said Sir William, with a forced smile, "I have much
to do yet; I mean to accomplish a deal of labour before <em>I&mdash;</em>well,
before many weeks. Come, lad; we must not grope out here seeking
unhappiness under these pretty stars. We are much to each other;
we shall be much more&mdash;eh? Come, then; Quider will live, spite
of those same slings and arrows of which you know not the totem
marks."</p>

<p>As we descended the hill through shadowy drifts of spice-fern,
Sir William looked long and hopefully at the candle burning in
Quider's hut.</p>

<p>"Ho-no-we-eh-to," he murmured; "I have given him white belts&mdash;ho-way-ha-tah-koo!&mdash;they
shall disinter him, though he lie dead. He came, bearing wampum;
shall his spirit go out bearing a quiver&mdash;o-tat-sheh-te?&mdash;hoo-sah-ha-ho?"</p>

<p>"So-yone-wes; sa-tea-na-wat; he has a long wampum belt; he holds
it fast, sir," I said, cheerfully mixing the tongues of the Six
Nations to piece out my symbol.</p>

<p>So we went home, comforted and hopeful; but the morrow brought
gravest tidings from Quider's lodge, for the Cayuga had fallen
a-raving in his fever, and it was necessary to tie him down lest
he break away.</p>

<p>Weighed down with anxiety concerning what Colonel Cresap might
be doing on the Ohio, dreading an outbreak which must surely come
if the Cayuga belts remained unanswered, Sir William, in his sore
perplexity, turned once more to me and opened his brave heart.</p>

<p>"I know not what intrigues may be afoot, what double intrigues
revolve within, what triple motives urge the men who have despatched
Colonel Cresap on this adventure. But I know this, that should
Cresap's colonials in their blindness attack my Cayugas, a thousand
hatchets will sparkle in these hills, and the people of the Long
House will never sit idle when these colonies and England draw
the sword!"</p>

<p>Again that cold, despairing amazement crept into my heart, for
I could no longer misunderstand Sir William that his sympathies
were not with our King, but with the provinces.</p>

<p>He appeared to divine my troubled thoughts; I knew it by the
painful smile which passed like a pale light from his eyes, fading
in the shadowy hollows which care and grief had dug in his good,
kind face.</p>

<p>"Learn from others, not from me, what acid chemistry is changing
the heart of this broad land to stone," he said.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand, sir," I broke out, "why we should warn
Colonel Cresap. Is it loyalty for us to do so?"</p>

<p>Sir William turned his sunken eyes on me.</p>

<p>"It is loyalty to God," he said.</p>

<p>The solemn peace in his eyes awed me; the ravage which care had
left in his visage frightened me.</p>

<p>He spoke again:</p>

<p>"I may have to answer to Him soon, my boy. I have searched my
heart; there is no dishonour in it."</p>

<p>We had been sitting on the bed in my little chamber. The window
was open, the breeze fluttered the cotton curtains, a spicy breeze,
laden with essence of the fern which covers our fields, and smells
like bay-leaves crushed in one's palm.</p>

<p>The peace of Sabbath brooded over all, a cow-bell tinkled from
the pasture, birds chirped. Sir William rose to stand by the window,
and his gaze softened towards the sunlit meadows where buttercups
swayed with daisies, and blue flower-de-luce quivered in the wind.</p>

<p>"God!" he muttered, under his breath. "That this sweet peace
on earth should be assailed by men!"</p>

<p>Again into my breast came that strange uneasiness which this
month of May had brought to us along with the robins and the new
leaves, and which I began to breathe in with the summer wind itself&mdash;a
vague unrest, a breathless waiting&mdash;for what? &mdash;I did not
know.</p>

<p>And so it went on, Sir William and I walking sometimes alone
together on the hill-sides, speaking soberly of that future which
concerned our land and kin, I listening in silence with apprehension
ever growing.</p>

<p>Often during that week came Mohawk sachems and chiefs of the
Senecas and Onondagas to the Hall, pestering Sir William with
petty disputes to judge between them. Sometimes it was complaint
against drunken soldiers who annoyed them, sometimes a demand
for justice, touching the old matters of the moonlight survey,
in which one, Collins, did shamefully wrong the Mohawks by stealing
land; and William Alexander, who is now Lord Sterling, and William
Livingston did profit thereby&mdash;guiltily or innocently, I know
not.</p>

<p>But these troubles Sir William settled impartially and with that
simple justice which made fraud loathsome, even to frauds.</p>

<p>I do remember how he scourged and scored that villain German,
Klock, for making the Mohawks drunk to rob them of their lands
by cunning; and I recall how he summoned Counsellor John Chambers
to witness justice between Mr. Livingston and the Mohawks:</p>

<p>"Billy Livingston," said Sir William, "bear this message to Billy
Alexander, that the land belongs not to him or to you, but to
my Mohawks! It is enough that I say this to you, for you are my
old comrades and honoured friends, and I am assured you will relinquish
all title to what is not your own. But, by God! Billy, if you
do not, I shall spend every penny of my own on lawyers to drive
you out&mdash;every farthing, though it beggars me!"</p>

<p>This was but one of many scenes at which I was present. Why Sir
William always called me to bear him company in such private matters,
I could not at once comprehend. Little by little, however, I saw
that it was because of his trust in me, and his desire that I
should know of such affairs; and his love and confidence made
me proud. Was I not the only person in the world who knew his
sentiments and his desire to stop Colonel Cresap on the Ohio,
lest, in ignorance, he should turn the entire Six Nations against
the colonies?</p>

<p>Had he not told me, sadly, that he could not speak of this plan
even to his own son, Sir John Johnson, lest his son, placing loyalty
to the King before obedience to his father, should thwart Sir
William, and even aid Colonel Cresap to anger the Cayugas, and
so injure the cause of the colonies?</p>

<p>He told me, too, that he could not confide in Mr. Butler or in
his father, Colonel John Butler; neither dared he trust his sons-in-law,
Colonel Claus or Colonel Guy Johnson, although they served as
his deputies in Indian affairs.</p>

<p>All of these gentlemen were, first of all, loyal to our King,
and all of them, clearly foreseeing a struggle between King and
colonies, would not raise a finger to prevent Colonel Cresap from
driving the Six Nations as allies into the King's arms.</p>

<p>"What I am striving for," said Sir William to me, again and again,
"is to so conduct that these Indians on our frontiers shall take
neither one side nor the other, but remain passive while the storm
rages. To work openly for this is not possible. If it were possible
to work openly, and if Quider should die, I would send such a
message to my Lord Dunmore of Virginia as would make his bloodless
ears burn! And they may burn yet!"</p>

<p>At my expression of horrified surprise Sir William hesitated,
then struck his fist into the open palm of his left hand.</p>

<p>"Why should you not know it?" he cried. "You are the only one
of all I can trust!"</p>

<p>He paused, eying me intently.</p>

<p>"Can I not trust you, dear lad?" he said, gently.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I cried, in an overwhelming rush of pity and love.
"You are first in my heart, sir&mdash;and then the King."</p>

<p>Sir William smiled and thought awhile. Then he continued:</p>

<p>"You are to know, Michael, that Lord Dunmore, Governor of Virginia,
is, in my opinion, at the bottom of this. He it is who, foreseeing
the future, as do all thinking men, has sent the deluded Cresap
to pick a quarrel with my Cayugas, knowing that he is making future
allies for England. It is vile! It is a monstrous thing! It is
not loyalty, it is treason!"</p>

<p>He struck his pinched forehead and strode up and down.</p>

<p>"Can Dunmore know what he is doing? God! The horror of it!&mdash;the
horror of border war! Has Dunmore ever seen how savages fight?
Has he seen raw scalps ripped from babies? Has he seen naked prisoners
writhing at the stake, drenched in blood, eyeless sockets raised
to the skies?"</p>

<p>He stood still in the middle of the room. There was a sweat on
his cheek-bones.</p>

<p>"If we must fight, let us fight like men," he muttered, "without
fear or favour, without treachery! But, Michael, woe to the side
that calls on these savages for aid! Woe to them! Woe! Woe! For
the first scalp taken will turn this border into such a hell of
blood and flame as the devil himself in his old hell never dreamed
of!"</p>

<p>This outburst left me stunned. Save for Sir William, I knew not
where now to anchor my faith. Our King already in these few days
had become to my youthful mind a distant wavering shadow, no longer
the rock to which loyal hearts must cling&mdash;unquestioning. And
it is ever so; old faiths fall when hearts question, and I know
not whether hearts be right or wrong to strive so hard for the
answer which is their own undoing.</p>

<p>Still, however, in that distant England which I had never seen,
the King, though fading to a phantom in my heart, yet loomed up
still a vast and mighty shape, awful as the threatening majesty
of a dim cloud on the world's edge, behind which lightning glimmers.</p>
