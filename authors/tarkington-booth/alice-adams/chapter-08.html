<p>The device of the absentee partner has the defect that it cannot
be employed for longer than ten or fifteen minutes at a time,
and it may not be repeated more than twice in one evening: a single
repetition, indeed, is weak, and may prove a betrayal. Alice knew
that her present performance could be effective during only this
interval between dances; and though her eyes were guarded, she
anxiously counted over the partnerless young men who lounged together
in the doorways within her view. Every one of them ought to have
asked her for dances, she thought, and although she might have
been put to it to give a reason why any of them "ought," her heart
was hot with resentment against them.</p>

<p>For a girl who has been a belle, it is harder to live through
these bad times than it is for one who has never known anything
better. Like a figure of painted and brightly varnished wood,
Ella Dowling sat against the wall through dance after dance with
glassy imperturbability; it was easier to be wooden, Alice thought,
if you had your mother with you, as Ella had. You were left with
at least the shred of a pretense that you came to sit with your
mother as a spectator, and not to offer yourself to be danced
with by men who looked you over and rejected you&mdash;not for the
first time. "Not for the first time": there lay a sting! Why had
you thought this time might be different from the other times?
Why had you broken your back picking those hundreds of violets?</p>

<p>Hating the fatuous young men in the doorways more bitterly for
every instant that she had to maintain her tableau, the smiling
Alice knew fierce impulses to spring to her feet and shout at
them, "You <em>IDIOTS!"  </em>Hands in pockets, they lounged against
the pilasters, or faced one another, laughing vaguely, each one
of them seeming to Alice no more than so much mean beef in clothes.
She wanted to tell them they were no better than that; and it
seemed a cruel thing of heaven to let them go on believing themselves
young lords. They were doing nothing, killing time. Wasn't she
at her lowest value at least a means of killing time? Evidently
the mean beeves thought not. And when one of them finally lounged
across the corridor and spoke to her, he was the very one to whom
she preferred her loneliness.</p>

<p>"Waiting for somebody, Lady Alicia?" he asked, negligently; and
his easy burlesque of her name was like the familiarity of the
rest of him. He was one of those full-bodied, grossly handsome
men who are powerful and active, but never submit themselves to
the rigour of becoming athletes, though they shoot and fish from
expensive camps. Gloss is the most shining outward mark of the
type. Nowadays these men no longer use brilliantine on their moustaches,
but they have gloss bought from manicure-girls, from masseurs,
and from automobile-makers; and their eyes, usually large, are
glossy. None of this is allowed to interfere with business; these
are "good business men," and often make large fortunes. They are
men of imagination about two things&mdash;women and money, and, combining
their imaginings about both, usually make a wise first marriage.
Later, however, they are apt to imagine too much about some little
woman without whom life seems duller than need be. They run away,
leaving the first wife well enough dowered. They are never intentionally
unkind to women, and in the end they usually make the mistake
of thinking they have had their money's worth of life. Here was
Mr. Harvey Malone, a young specimen in an earlier stage of development,
trying to marry Henrietta Lamb, and now sauntering over to speak
to Alice, as a time-killer before his next dance with Henrietta.</p>

<p>Alice made no response to his question, and he dropped lazily
into the vacant chair, from which she sharply withdrew her hand.
"I might as well use his chair till he comes, don't you think?
You don't <em>MIND, </em>do you, old girl?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Alice said. "It doesn't matter one way or the other.
Please don't call me that."</p>

<p>"So that's how you feel?" Mr. Malone laughed indulgently, without
much interest. "I've been meaning to come to see you for a long
time honestly I have&mdash;because I wanted to have a good talk with
you about old times. I know you think it was funny, after the
way I used to come to your house two or three times a week, and
sometimes oftener&mdash;well, I don't blame you for being hurt, the
way I stopped without explaining or anything. The truth is there
wasn't any reason: I just happened to have a lot of important
things to do and couldn't find the time. But I AM going to call
on you some evening&mdash;honestly I am. I don't wonder you think&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You're mistaken," Alice said. "I've never thought anything about
it at all."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" he said, and looked at her languidly. "What's the
use of being cross with this old man? He always means well." And,
extending his arm, he would have given her a friendly pat upon
the shoulder but she evaded it. "Well, well!" he said. "Seems
to me you're getting awful tetchy! Don't you like your old friends
any more?"</p>

<p>"Not all of them."</p>

<p>"Who's the new one?" he asked, teasingly. "Come on and tell us,
Alice. Who is it you were holding this chair for?"</p>

<p>"Never mind."</p>

<p>"Well, all I've got to do is to sit here till he comes back;
then I'll see who it is."</p>

<p>"He may not come back before you have to go."</p>

<p>"Guess you got me <em>THAT </em>time," Malone admitted, laughing
as he rose. "They're tuning up, and I've got this dance. I AM
coming around to see you some evening." He moved away, calling
back over his shoulder, "Honestly, I am!"</p>

<p>Alice did not look at him.</p>

<p>She had held her tableau as long as she could; it was time for
her to abandon the box-trees; and she stepped forth frowning,
as if a little annoyed with the absentee for being such a time
upon her errand; whereupon the two chairs were instantly seized
by a coquetting pair who intended to "sit out" the dance. She
walked quickly down the broad corridor, turned into the broader
hall, and hurriedly entered the dressing-room where she had left
her wraps.</p>

<p>She stayed here as long as she could, pretending to arrange her
hair at a mirror, then fidgeting with one of her slipper-buckles;
but the intelligent elderly woman in charge of the room made an
indefinite sojourn impracticable. "Perhaps I could help you with
that buckle, Miss," she suggested, approaching. "Has it come loose?"
Alice wrenched desperately; then it was loose. The competent woman,
producing needle and thread, deftly made the buckle fast; and
there was nothing for Alice to do but to express her gratitude
and go.</p>

<p>She went to the door of the cloak-room opposite, where a coloured
man stood watchfully in the doorway. "I wonder if you know which
of the gentlemen is my brother, Mr. Walter Adams," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes'm; I know him."</p>

<p>"Could you tell me where he is?"</p>

<p>"No'm; I couldn't say."</p>

<p>"Well, if you see him, would you please tell him that his sister,
Miss Adams, is looking for him and very anxious to speak to him?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm. Sho'ly, sho'ly!"</p>

<p>As she went away he stared after her and seemed to swell with
some bursting emotion. In fact, it was too much for him, and he
suddenly retired within the room, releasing strangulated laughter.</p>

<p>Walter remonstrated. Behind an excellent screen of coats and
hats, in a remote part of the room, he was kneeling on the floor,
engaged in a game of chance with a second coloured attendant;
and the laughter became so vehement that it not only interfered
with the pastime in hand, but threatened to attract frozen-face
attention.</p>

<p>"I cain' he'p it, man," the laughter explained. "I cain' he'p
it! You sut'n'y the beatin'es' white boy 'n 'is city!"</p>

<p>The dancers were swinging into an "encore" as Alice halted for
an irresolute moment in a doorway. Across the room, a cluster
of matrons sat chatting absently, their eyes on their dancing
daughters; and Alice, finding a refugee's courage, dodged through
the scurrying couples, seated herself in a chair on the outskirts
of this colony of elders, and began to talk eagerly to the matron
nearest her. The matron seemed unaccustomed to so much vivacity,
and responded but dryly, whereupon Alice was more vivacious than
ever; for she meant now to present the picture of a jolly girl
too much interested in these wise older women to bother about
every foolish young man who asked her for a dance.</p>

<p>Her matron was constrained to go so far as to supply a tolerant
nod, now and then, in complement to the girl's animation, and
Alice was grateful for the nods. In this fashion she supplemented
the exhausted resources of the dressing-room and the box-tree
nook; and lived through two more dances, when again Mr. Frank
Dowling presented himself as a partner.</p>

<p>She needed no pretense to seek the dressing-room for repairs
after that number; this time they were necessary and genuine.
Dowling waited for her, and when she came out he explained for
the fourth or fifth time how the accident had happened. "It was
entirely those other people's fault,"  he said. "They got me in
a kind of a corner, because neither of those fellows knows the
least thing about guiding; they just jam ahead and expect everybody
to get out of their way. It was Charlotte Thom's diamond crescent
pin that got caught on your dress in the back and made such a&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Never mind," Alice said in a tired voice. "The maid fixed it
so that she says it isn't very noticeable."</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't," he returned. "You could hardly tell there'd
been anything the matter. Where do you want to go? Mother's been
interfering in my affairs some more and I've got the next taken."</p>

<p>"I was sitting with Mrs. George Dresser. You might take me back
there."</p>

<p>He left her with the matron, and Alice returned to her picture-making,
so that once more, while two numbers passed, whoever cared to
look was offered the sketch of a jolly, clever girl preoccupied
with her elders. Then she found her friend Mildred standing before
her, presenting Mr. Arthur Russell, who asked her to dance with
him.</p>

<p>Alice looked uncertain, as though not sure what her engagements
were; but her perplexity cleared; she nodded, and swung rhythmically
away with the tall applicant. She was not grateful to her hostess
for this alms. What a young hostess does with a fiance, Alice
thought, is to make him dance with the unpopular girls. She supposed
that Mr. Arthur Russell had already danced with Ella Dowling.</p>

<p>The loan of a lover, under these circumstances, may be painful
to the lessee, and Alice, smiling never more brightly, found nothing
to say to Mr. Russell, though she thought he might have found
something to say to her. "I wonder what Mildred told him," she
thought. "Probably she said, 'Dearest, there's one more girl you've
got to help me out with. You wouldn't like her much, but she dances
well enough and she's having a rotten time. Nobody ever goes near
her any more.'"</p>

<p>When the music stopped, Russell added his applause to the hand-clapping
that encouraged the uproarious instruments to continue, and as
they renewed the tumult, he said heartily, "That's splendid!"</p>

<p>Alice gave him a glance, necessarily at short range, and found
his eyes kindly and pleased. Here was a friendly soul, it appeared,
who probably "liked everybody." No doubt he had applauded for
an "encore" when he danced with Ella Dowling, gave Ella the same
genial look, and said, "That's splendid!"</p>

<p>When the "encore" was over, Alice spoke to him for the first
time.</p>

<p>"Mildred will be looking for you," she said. "I think you'd better
take me back to where you found me."</p>

<p>He looked surprised. "Oh, if you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I'm sure Mildred will be needing you," Alice said, and as she
took his arm and they walked toward Mrs. Dresser, she thought
it might be just possible to make a further use of the loan. "Oh,
I wonder if you&#11834;"  she began.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said, quickly.</p>

<p>"You don't know my brother, Walter Adams," she said. "But he's
somewhere I think possibly he's in a smoking-room or some place
where girls aren't expected, and if you wouldn't think it too
much trouble to inquire&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I'll find him," Russell said, promptly. "Thank you so much for
that dance. I'll bring your brother in a moment."</p>

<p>It was to be a long moment, Alice decided, presently. Mrs. Dresser
had grown restive; and her nods and vague responses to her young
dependent's gaieties were as meager as they could well be. Evidently
the matron had no intention of appearing to her world in the light
of a chaperone for Alice Adams; and she finally made this clear.
With a word or two of excuse, breaking into something Alice was
saying, she rose and went to sit next to Mildred's mother, who
had become the nucleus of the cluster. So Alice was left very
much against the wall, with short stretches of vacant chairs on
each side of her. She had come to the end of her picture-making,
and could only pretend that there was something amusing the matter
with the arm of her chair.</p>

<p>She supposed that Mildred's Mr. Russell had forgotten Walter
by this time. "I'm not even an intimate enough friend of Mildred's
for him to have thought he ought to bother to tell me he couldn't
find him," she thought. And then she saw Russell coming across
the room toward her, with Walter beside him. She jumped up gaily.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you!" she cried. "I know this naughty boy must have
been terribly hard to find. Mildred'll <em>NEVER </em>forgive
me! I've put you to so much&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Not at all," he said, amiably, and went away, leaving the brother
and sister together.</p>

<p>"Walter, let's dance just once more," Alice said, touching his
arm placatively. "I thought&mdash;well, perhaps we might go home then."</p>

<p>But Walter's expression was that of a person upon whom an outrage
has just been perpetrated. "No," he said. "We've stayed <em>THIS
</em>long, I'm goin' to wait and see what they got to eat. And
you look here!" He turned upon her angrily. "Don't you ever do
that again!"</p>

<p>"Do what?"</p>

<p>"Send somebody after me that pokes his nose into every corner
of the house till he finds me! 'Are you Mr. Walter Adams?' he
says. I guess he must asked everybody in the place if they were
Mr. Walter Adams! Well, I'll bet a few iron men you wouldn't send
anybody to hunt for me again if you knew where he found me!"</p>

<p>"Where was it?"</p>

<p>Walter decided that her fit punishment was to know. "I was shootin'
dice with those coons in the cloak-room."</p>

<p>"And he saw you?"</p>

<p>"Unless he was blind!" said Walter. "Come on, I'll dance this
one more dance with you. Supper comes after that, and <em>THEN
</em>we'll go home."</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams heard Alice's key turning in the front door and hurried
down the stairs to meet her.</p>

<p>"Did you get wet coming in, darling?" she asked. "Did you have
a good time?"</p>

<p>"Just lovely!" Alice said, cheerily, and after she had arranged
the latch for Walter, who had gone to return the little car, she
followed her mother upstairs and hummed a dance-tune on the way.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad you had a nice time," Mrs. Adams said, as they
reached the door of her daughter's room together. "You <em>DESERVED
</em>to, and it's lovely to think&#11834;"</p>

<p>But at this, without warning, Alice threw herself into her mother's
arms, sobbing so loudly that in his room, close by, her father,
half drowsing through the night, started to full wakefulness.</p>
