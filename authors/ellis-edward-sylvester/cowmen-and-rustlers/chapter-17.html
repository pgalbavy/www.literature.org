<p>Few men possessed more courage than Fred Whitney, and he was
thoroughly aroused.</p>

<p>Sitting in front of his own home during the evening, it naturally
happened that he was without any weapon at immediate command.
His Winchester and revolvers, his inseparable companions, during
those stirring times, whenever away from home, were inside. It
need not be said that every one of the rustlers had his "guns"
in his possession, so he was a single, defenceless man against
four armed ones.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he strode forward in front of the open door, determined
to make good his threat.</p>

<p>"You talk of cowards," he said; "you are four, and each has his
pistols and rifle; I have none and one arm is wounded, but I defy
you!"</p>

<p>"Come, come," said the leader, "this will do you no good; we're
bound to have that man, and if he won't come out we must go after
him. If you stand in the way we'll pitch you aside. We don't want
to hurt you."</p>

<p>"Advance at your peril&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fred, move a little to the left&mdash;that will do. I've got a bead
on him now."</p>

<p>It was the voice of Mont Sterry, a few feet away, in the darkness
of the room. The muzzle of his rifle, however, projected just
enough to reflect the moonlight, and it was leveled at the breast
of Larch Cadmus.</p>

<p>"One step," added Sterry, "and you're a dead man."</p>

<p>"Larch Cadmus," said Fred, thrilled by the occurrence, "for we
recognize you despite those whiskers, I never knew Mont Sterry
to break his word!"</p>

<p>Language cannot do justice to the situation. At the very moment
the miscreant was about to advance to hurl Whitney from his path
he was confronted by the muzzle of a loaded rifle, held by a man
who was in deadly earnest, and who realized he was at bay.</p>

<p>The startled ruffian recoiled a step and stared into the darkened
room, as if he failed to grasp the situation.</p>

<p>"Not a step in any direction," said Sterry, warningly; "if you
attempt to retreat, advance, or move aside, I'll fire."</p>

<p>It would be a rash thing for any one to deny that the young inspector
had secured the "drop" on Larch Cadmus.</p>

<p>But the man was accustomed to violence, and it took him but a
minute to rally.</p>

<p>"Pretty well done, I'll own," he said, with a forced laugh; "but
what good is it going to do you? There are three more of us here
and a half-dozen hardly a hundred yards away."</p>

<p>"And what good will they do you?"</p>

<p>"Spark," said Cadmus, "slip back to the boys and give 'em the
tip; we'll see about this thing."</p>

<p>"The moment Spark or either of the other two stirs I'll let the
moonlight through <em>you!</em> I'm going to keep my gun pointed
right at you, Mr. Cadmus. If those fellows think I'm worth more
than you, they have a chance to prove it, for only one of them
has to take the first step to leave, when I'll press this trigger
just a little harder than now. More than that, if one of them
shouts, whistles, or makes any kind of a signal, I'll do as I
threaten. If any man doesn't think so, let him make the trial."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be hanged!" muttered Larch Cadmus; "this <em>is</em>
a go!"</p>

<p>Judging from the new turn of affairs, it looked as if a single
individual had the "drop" on four others.</p>

<p>It struck Larch Cadmus that this was a good occasion for something
in the nature of a compromise.</p>

<p>"See here, Sterry," he said, assuming an affected jocularity
which deceived no one, "I'll own you've played it on me mighty
fine. But you can't stand there all night with your Winchester
p'inted at me, and bime-by I'll git tired; can't we fix the matter
up some way?"</p>

<p>"Fred," said Sterry, with the same coolness shown from the first,
"slip through the door; you know where your gun is; stoop a little,
so I won't have to shift my aim; when that is done we'll talk
about compromise."</p>

<p>Fred Whitney, as quick as his companion to "catch on," did instantly
what was requested. He dodged into the darkened apartment, with
which, of course, he was so familiar that he needed the help of
no light to find his weapon.</p>

<p>Had Larch Cadmus been as subtle as his master, perhaps he might
have prevented this by ordering one of his men to cover Whitney
with his gun, though it is more than probable that Sterry still
would have forced the leading rustler to his own terms.</p>

<p>But there was one among the four with the cunning of a fox; he
was Spark Holly, who had located the inspector when in front of
the house.</p>

<p>At the moment Cadmus was brought up all standing, as may be said,
Holly stood so far to one side that he was not in the young man's
field of vision. He, like his two companions, could have slipped
off at any moment without danger to himself, but it would have
been at the cost of their leader's life; nor could they shift
their position and raise a weapon to fire into the room, where
there was a prospect of hitting the daring youth at bay, without
precipitating that catastrophe.</p>

<p>The instant, however, Fred Whitney turned his back on the rustlers,
Holly saw his opportunity. He vanished.</p>

<p>The others, more sluggish than he, held their places, dazed,
wondering, stupefied, and of no more account than so many logs
of wood.</p>

<p>Shrewd enough to do this clever thing, Spark Holly was too cautious
to spoil it by allowing his movement to be observed. Had he darted
over the plain in front of the house, Mont Sterry would have seen
the fleeing figure, understood what it meant, and, carrying out
his threat, shot down Larch Cadmus.</p>

<p>Holly lost no time in dodging behind the structure, moving with
the stealth of an Indian in the stillness of the night. Then he
made a circuit so wide that, as he gradually described a half-circle
and came round to the point whence he had first advanced to the
dwelling, he was so far off that the keenest vision from the interior
could not catch a glimpse of him.</p>

<p>Certain of this, he ran only a short distance, when he came up
with the half-dozen mounted rustlers of whom Cadmus had spoken,
and who were wondering at the unaccountable delay.</p>

<p>The messenger quickly made everything plain, and they straightway
proceeded to take a hand in the business.</p>
