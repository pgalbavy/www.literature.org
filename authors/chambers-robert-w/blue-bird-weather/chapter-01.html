<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was now almost too dark to distinguish objects; duskier and
vaguer became the flat world of marshes, set here and there with
cypress and bounded only by far horizons; and at last land and
water disappeared behind the gathered curtains of the night. There
was no sound from the waste except the wind among the withered
reeds and the furrowing splash of wheel and hoof over the submerged
causeway.</p>

<p>The boy who was driving had scarcely spoken since he strapped
Marche's gun cases and valise to the rear of the rickety wagon
at the railroad station. Marche, too, remained silent, preoccupied
with his own reflections. Wrapped in his fur-lined coat, arms
folded, he sat doubled forward, feeling the Southern swamp-chill
busy with his bones. Now and then he was obliged to relight his
pipe, but the cold bit at his fingers, and he hurried to protect
himself again with heavy gloves.</p>

<p>The small, rough hands of the boy who was driving were naked,
and finally Marche mentioned it, asking the child if he were not
cold.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he said, with a colorless brevity that might have
been shyness or merely the dull indifference of the very poor,
accustomed to discomfort.</p>

<p>"Don't you feel cold at all?" persisted Marche kindly.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are hardened to this sort of weather?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>By the light of a flaming match, Marche glanced sideways at him
as he drew his pipe into a glow once more, and for an instant
the boy's gray eyes flickered toward his in the flaring light.
Then darkness masked them both again.</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Herold's son?" inquired the young man.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," almost sullenly.</p>

<p>"How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Eleven."</p>

<p>"You're a big boy, all right. I have never seen your father.
He is at the clubhouse, no doubt."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," scarcely audible.</p>

<p>"And you and he live there all alone, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." A moment later the boy added jerkily, "And my sister,"
as though truth had given him a sudden nudge.</p>

<p>"Oh, you have a sister, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"That makes it very jolly for you, I fancy," said Marche pleasantly.
There was no reply to the indirect question.</p>

<p>His pipe had gone out again, and he knocked the ashes from it
and pocketed it. For a while they drove on in silence, then Marche
peered impatiently through the darkness, right and left, in an
effort to see; and gave it up.</p>

<p>"You must know this road pretty well to be able to keep it,"
he said. "As for me, I can't see anything except a dirty little
gray star up aloft."</p>

<p>"The horse knows the road."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that. Have you any idea how near we are to the house?"</p>

<p>"Half a mile. That's Rattler Creek, yonder."</p>

<p>"How the dickens can you tell?" asked Marche curiously. "You
can't see anything in the dark, can you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how I can tell," said the boy indifferently.</p>

<p>Marche smiled. "A sixth sense, probably. What did you say your
name is?"</p>

<p>"Jim."</p>

<p>"And you're eleven? You'll be old enough to have a gun very soon,
Jim. How would you like to shoot a real, live wild duck?"</p>

<p>"I <em>have</em> shot plenty."</p>

<p>Marche laughed. "Good for you, Jimmy. What did the gun do to
you? Kick you flat on your back?"</p>

<p>The boy said gravely: "Father's gun is too big for me. I have
to rest it on the edge of the blind when I fire."</p>

<p>"Do you shoot from the blinds?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Marche relapsed into smiling silence. In a few moments he was
thinking of other things&mdash;of this muddy island which had once
been the property of a club consisting of five carefully selected
and wealthy members, and which, through death and resignation,
had now reverted to him. Why he had ever bought in the shares,
as one by one the other members either died or dropped out, he
did not exactly know. He didn't care very much for duck shooting.
In five years he had not visited the club; and why he had come
here this year for a week's sport he scarcely knew, except that
he had either to go somewhere for a rest or ultimately be carried,
kicking, into what his slangy doctor called the "funny house."</p>

<p>So here he was, on a cold February night, and already nearly
at his destination; for now he could make out a light across the
marsh, and from dark and infinite distances the east wind bore
the solemn rumor of the sea, muttering of wrecks and death along
the Atlantic sands beyond the inland sounds.</p>

<p>"Well, Jim," he said, "I never thought I'd survive this drive,
but here we are, and still alive. Are you frozen solid, you poor
boy?"</p>

<p>The boy smiled, shyly, in negation, as they drove into the bar
of light from the kitchen window and stopped. Marche got down
very stiffly. The kitchen door opened at the same moment, and
a woman's figure appeared in the lamplight&mdash;a young girl, slender,
bare armed, drying her fingers as she came down the steps to offer
a small, weather-roughened hand to Marche.</p>

<p>"My brother will show you to your room," she said. "Supper will
be ready in a few minutes."</p>

<p>So he thanked her and went away with Jim, relieving the boy of
the valise and one gun-case, and presently came to the quarters
prepared for him. The room was rough, with its unceiled walls
of yellow pine, a chair, washstand, bed, and a nail or two for
his wardrobe. It had been the affectation of the wealthy men composing
the Foam Island Duck Club to exist almost primitively when on
the business of duck shooting, in contradistinction to the overfed
luxury of other millionaires inhabiting other more luxuriously
appointed shooting-boxes along the Chesapeake.</p>

<p>The Foam Island Club went in heavily for simplicity, as far as
the two-story shanty of a clubhouse was concerned; but their island
was one of the most desirable in the entire region, and their
live decoys the most perfectly trained and cared for.</p>

<p>Marche, washing his tingling fingers and visage in icy water,
rather wished, for a moment, that the club had installed modern
plumbing; but delectable odors from the kitchen put him into better
humor, and presently he went off down the creaking and unpainted
stairs to warm himself at a big stove until summoned to the table.</p>

<p>He was summoned in a few moments by the same girl who had greeted
him; and she also waited on him at table, placing before him in
turn his steaming soup, a platter of fried bass and smoking sweet
potatoes, then the inevitable broiled canvas-back duck with rice,
and finally home-made preserves&mdash;wild grapes, exquisitely fragrant
in their thin, golden syrup.</p>

<p>Marche was that kind of a friendly young man who is naturally
gay-hearted and also a little curious&mdash;sometimes to the verge
of indiscretion. For his curiosity and inquiring interest in his
fellow-men was easily aroused&mdash;particularly when they were less
fortunately situated than he in a world where it is a favorite
fiction that all are created equal. He was, in fact, that particular
species of human nuisance known as a humanitarian; but he never
dreamed he was a nuisance, and certainly never meant to be.</p>

<p>Warmth and food and the prospects of to-morrow's shooting, and
a slender, low-voiced young girl, made cheerful his recently frost-nipped
soul, and he was inclined to expand and become talkative there
in the lamplight.</p>

<p>"Has the shooting been pretty good?" he asked pleasantly, plying
knife and fork in the service of a raging appetite.</p>

<p>"It <em>has</em> been."</p>

<p>"What do you think of the prospects for to-morrow?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "She said gravely: 'I am afraid it will be blue-bird
weather.'"]</p>

<p>She said gravely: "I am afraid it will be blue-bird weather."</p>

<p>It was a new, but graphic, expression to him; and he often remembered
it afterward, and how quaintly it fell from her lips as she stood
there in the light of the kerosene lamp, slim, self-possessed,
in her faded gingham gown and apron, the shapely middle finger
of one little weather-tanned hand resting on the edge of the cloth.</p>

<p>"You are Miss Herold, I suppose?" he said, looking up at her
with his pleasant smile.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You are not Southern?"</p>

<p>"No," she said briefly. And he then remembered that the Hon.
Cicero W. Gilkins, when he was president of the now defunct club,
had installed a Northern man as resident chief game-protector
and superintendent at the Foam Island Club House.</p>

<p>Marche had never even seen Herold; but, through lack of personal
interest, and also because he needed somebody to look out for
the property, he had continued to pay this man Herold his inconsiderable
salary every year, scarcely knowing, himself, why he did not put
the Foam Island shooting on the market and close up the matter
for good.</p>

<p>"It's been five years since I was here, Miss Herold," he said,
smiling. "That was in the old days of the club, when Judge Gilkins
and Colonel Vyse used to come here shooting every season. But
you don't remember them, I fancy."</p>

<p>"I remember them."</p>

<p>"Really! You must have been quite a child."</p>

<p>"I was thirteen."</p>

<p>"Oh, then you are eighteen, now," he said humorously.</p>

<p>Her grave, young lips were only slightly responsive to his smile.</p>

<p>"You have been here a long time," he said. "Do you find it lonely?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes," she admitted.</p>

<p>"What do you do for recreation?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I know what you mean, Mr. Marche."</p>

<p>"I mean for pleasure."</p>

<p>She looked at him out of her clear, gray eyes, then turned her
gaze on the window. But she could not see through it; the pane
only reflected her face darkly; and to her, for a moment, it seemed
that way with her whole pent-up life, here in the Virginia marshes&mdash;no
outlet, no outlook, and wherever she turned her wistful eyes only
her own imprisoned self to confront her out of the dull obscurity.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, watching her, "that you sometimes go to
Norfolk for a holiday?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Or to Old Point, or Baltimore, perhaps?"</p>

<p>She had her under lip between her teeth, now, and was looking
so fixedly at the window that he thought she had not heard him.</p>

<p>He rose from the table, and as she turned to meet his pleasant
eyes he smilingly thanked her for waiting on him.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, "if you will say to your father that I'd
like to have a little talk with him&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Father is ill in bed," she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry. I hope it isn't anything serious."</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>think not."</p>

<p>"Will he be able to see me to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid not, Mr. Marche. He&mdash;he asked me to say to you that
you might safely transact any business with me. I know all about
it," she said, speaking a little hurriedly. "I keep the accounts,
and I have every item and every bill ready for your inspection;
and I can tell you exactly what condition the property is in and
what lumber has been cut and what repairs have been necessary.
Whenever you are ready for me, I will come into the sitting room,"
she added, "because Jim and I have had our supper."</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, smiling, "I am ready now, if you are."</p>

<p>So she went away to rinse her hands and lay aside her apron,
and in a few minutes she entered the sitting room. He rose and
placed a chair for her, and she thanked him, flushing a little,
and then he resumed his seat, watching her sorting over the papers
in her lap.</p>

<p>Presently she crossed one knee over the other, and one slim,
prettily shaped foot, in its shabby shoe, swung clear of its shadow
on the floor. Then she handed him a sheaf of bills for his inspection,
and, pencil in hand, followed the totals as he read them off aloud.</p>

<p>For half an hour they compared and checked off items, and he
found her accounts accurate to a penny.</p>

<p>"Father bought three geese and a gander from Ike Helm," she said.
"They were rather expensive, but two were mated, and they call
very well when tied out separated. Do you think it was too expensive?"
she added timidly, showing him the bill.</p>

<p>"No," he said, smiling. "I think it's all right. Mated decoys
are what we need, and you can wing-tip a dozen before you get
one that will talk at the right time."</p>

<p>"That is true," she said eagerly. "We try our best to keep up
the decoys and have nothing but talkers. Our geese are nearly
all right, and our ducks are good, but our swans are <em>so</em>
vexing! They seem to be such fools, and they usually behave like
silly cygnets. You will see to-morrow."</p>

<p>While she was speaking, her brother came quietly into the room
with an open book in his hands, and Marche, glancing at it curiously,
saw that it was a Latin grammar.</p>

<p>"Where do you go to school, Jim?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Father teaches me."</p>

<p>Marche, rather astonished at the calibre of his superintendent,
glanced from the boy to his sister in silence. The girl's head
remained steadily lowered over the papers on her knee, but he
saw her foot swinging in nervous rhythm, and he was conscious
of her silent impatience at something or other, perhaps at the
interruption in their business discussion.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Well,' he said pleasantly, 'what comes next,
Miss Herold?'"]</p>

<p>"Well," he said pleasantly, "what comes next, Miss Herold?"</p>

<p>She handed him a list of the decoys. He read it gravely, nodded,
and returned it.</p>

<p>"You may count them for yourself to-morrow," she said.</p>

<p>"Not at all. I trust you entirely," he replied laughingly.</p>

<p>Then they went over the remaining matters, the condition of the
pine timber, the repairs to the boats and blinds and stools, items
for snaps, swivels, paint, cement, wire, none of which interested
Marche as much as the silent boy reading his Latin grammar by
the smoky lamp interested him, or the boy's sister bending over
the papers on her knee, pencil poised in her pretty, weather-roughened
hand.</p>

<p>"I sent the shells from New York by express," he said. "Did they
arrive?"</p>

<p>"I left two hundred in your room," said the boy, looking up.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, Jim." And, turning to his sister, who had raised
her head, inquiringly, "I suppose somebody will call me at the
screech of dawn, won't they?"</p>

<p>"Do you know the new law?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No. I don't like laws, anyway," he said smilingly.</p>

<p>She smiled, too, gathering up her papers preparatory to departure.
"Nobody is allowed," she said, "to put off from shore until the
sun is above the horizon line. And the wardens are very strict."
Then she rose. "Will you excuse me? I have the dishes to do."</p>

<p>The boy laid aside his book and stood up, but his sister said:</p>

<p>"Stay and study, Jim. I don't need any help."</p>

<p>And Jim resumed his seat with heightened color. A moment later,
however, he went out to the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Look here, Molly," he said, "wha'd' you want to give me away
for? He'll think I'm a sissy, helping you do dishes and things."</p>

<p>"My dear, my dear!" she exclaimed contritely, "I didn't think
of it. Please forgive me, Jim. Anyway, you don't really care what
this man thinks about any of us&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do! Anyway, a fellow doesn't want another fellow to think
he washes dishes."</p>

<p>"You darling! Forgive me. I wasn't thinking. It was too stupid
of me."</p>

<p>"It really was," said the boy, in his sweet, dignified voice,
"and I'd been telling him that I'd shot ducks, too."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'I'm <em>so</em> sorry, Jim.'"]</p>

<p>His sister caught him around the neck and kissed his blonde head.
"I'm <em>so</em> sorry, Jim. He won't think of it again. If he
does, he'll only respect a boy who is so good to his sister. And,"
she added, cautioning him with lifted finger, "don't talk too
much to him, Jim, no matter how nice and kind he is. I know how
lonely you are and how pleasant it is to talk to a man like Mr.
Marche; but remember that father doesn't wish us to say anything
about ourselves or about him, so we must be careful."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't father want us to speak about him or ourselves to
Mr. Marche?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>His sister had gone back to her dishes. Now, looking around over
her shoulder, she said seriously, "That is father's affair, dear,
not ours."</p>

<p>"But don't you know why?"</p>

<p>"Shame on you, Jim! What father cares to tell us he will tell
us; but it's exceedingly bad manners to ask."</p>

<p>"Is father really very ill?"</p>

<p>"I told you that to ask me such things is improper," said the
girl, coloring. "He has told us that he does not feel well, and
that he prefers to remain in his room for a few days. That is
enough for us, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the boy thoughtfully.</p>
