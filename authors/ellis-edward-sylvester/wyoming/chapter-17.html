<p>There was no attempt to use caution or care in hurrying forward.
Somehow or other Jake Golcher had gotten on the track of the little
party, and, with a number of Seneca warriors, almost as keen of
eye and scent as bloodhounds, was following them.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the distance to the cave was not great, and the
fugitives were walking fast, and in the right direction.</p>

<p>The heavy figure of Gravity Gimp kept its place at the front,
and with a coolness scarcely to be expected, he looked to the
right and left as he advanced, with the sole purpose of preventing
any precious moments being lost by going astray.</p>

<p>All heard the bird-calls, whistling, and faint whoops uttered
with very little intermission, from different portions of the
wood, so that it was certain the Tories and Indians knew of the
flight, and were in sharp pursuit.</p>

<p>The African, as we have said, maintained his place well in advance,
though at times it looked as if Habakkuk would take the lead.
But both scrambled along, sometimes half falling over the stones
which turned beneath their tread, or the briers and vines that
almost threw them on their faces.</p>

<p>Gravity could not afford time to look to his feet, to see where
he placed the rather unwilling members, for it required all his
training, as a hunter, to keep his reckoning and to make sure
he was taking the most direct route to the sheltering cave, upon
which all hopes were now fixed.</p>

<p>Although McEwen had come a long distance to help repel the invasion
of the Wyoming Valley, he was accustomed to fight where there
was plenty of support, and he knew enough of aboriginal ferocity
to dread the collision that now impended.</p>

<p>Had he known, therefore, the right course to follow, he would
have been in advance of the others; but as it was, he fretted
because he was forced to keep on the flank of the negro, whom
he was continually urging to greater speed.</p>

<p>"As sure as a gun," he said, "those fleet-footed redskins will
gobble us up in five minutes, if you don't get up more speed than
that, Gravity."</p>

<p>"I can't conwerse while I'm tumbling over rocks and splitting
'em to pieces wid my head," was the reply. "Don't bodder me, but
look out for Injuns, and if you see one, just run up to him and
lamm him."</p>

<p>"Lamm him!" muttered Habakkuk, more to himself than his companion.
"That shows the intelligence of his race. He's so dumb at times
that he crosses the line, and does smart things."</p>

<p>Aunt Peggy was not far in the rear of the two, for she was much
lighter of foot than they. She got along very well, but she held
her lips compressed, and her small eyes flashed, when she reflected
that the whole party were fleeing from the wrath of a man who
had lived in the valley before the war, who had sat at Mr. Brainerd's
table many a time, and had presumed, even, to pay court to pretty
Maggie.</p>

<p>It was an exasperating thought, indeed, that all this persecution
was for no cause at all, excepting the depravity of the Tories,
who, being renegades, were more revengeful than they would have
been against a foreign enemy.</p>

<p>Mr. Brainerd compelled his two daughters to continue in advance
of him, though only for a short distance. He expected the appearance
of the pursuers, and he could not leave the fugitives unguarded
in that fashion.</p>

<p>He felt that it was the place of Habakkuk McEwen to keep him
company, and he called to him in a guarded voice. But the fleeing
New Englander either did not, or would not, hear him.</p>

<p>It was impossible for such a flight and pursuit as this to last
for any length of time. The advantage was all on the side of the
fleet-footed Indians, who were so familiar with the woods that
they were sure to come up with the patriots in a brief while.</p>

<p>The fugitives were hurrying forward, as we have described, when
they were startled by the whoop of an Indian directly behind them,
and so close that every one glanced over his shoulder.</p>

<p>As they did so they saw the figure of a Seneca warrior in full
view and on a rapid run.</p>

<p>It was seen, too, that he grasped a gun in one hand and his tomahawk
in the other. There could be little doubt that he meant to use
one of them on the old gentleman at the rear, who could not hold
his own against such a swift pursuer.</p>

<p>"S'render! s'render! s'render!" called the savage, as he gained
rapidly, uttering the command in such good English that no one
could misunderstand him.</p>

<p>"S'render! s'render!&mdash;me shoot&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Brainerd halted, turned quickly, raising his rifle while
in the very act of doing so, and when the affrighted but bewildered
Indian ran almost against the muzzle of his gun, the trigger was
pressed.</p>

<p>The red man, with an ear-splitting shriek, bounded in the air
and stopped pursuing the patriots, while Mr. Brainerd, as he hurriedly
resumed his flight, was so overcome with excitement as to mutter:</p>

<p>"Now you can shoot and be&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"The accusing spirit flew up to heaven's chancery with the oath,
and as she wrote it down, dropped a tear on the word, and blotted
it out forever."</p>
