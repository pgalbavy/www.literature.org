<p>AT the moment of reining up their mustangs, the fugitives were
about equidistant between the two fires, and it was just as dangerous
to advance as to retreat. For one second the Irishman meditated
a desperate charge, in the hope of breaking through the company
that first appeared in his path, and, had he been alone, or accompanied
by a man, he would have done so. But, slight as was his own prospect
of escape, he knew there was absolutely none for the boy in such
a desperate effort, and he determined that it should not be made.</p>

<p>"Can't we make a dash straight through them?" asked Fred, reading
the thought of Mickey, as he glanced from one to the other, and
noted the fearfully rapid approach of the redskins.</p>

<p>"It can't be done," replied the Irishman. "There is only one
thing left for us."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Do as I do. Yonder is an opening that may serve us for awhile."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he slipped off his steed, leaving him to work his
own will. Fred did not hesitate a moment, for there was not a
moment to spare.</p>

<p>As he sprang to the ground, he pulled the beautiful Apache blanket
from the back of the mustang that had served him so well. Dragging
that with him, the two hurried to the right, making for a wooded
crevice between the rocks, which seemingly offered a chance for
them to climb to the surface above, if, in the order of things,
they should gain the opportunity to do so. Mickey O'Rooney, as
a matter of course, took the lead and in a twinkling he was among
the gnarled and twisted saplings, the interlacing vines, and the
rolling stones and rattling gravel. As soon as he had secured
a foothold, he reached out his hand to help his young friend.</p>

<p>"Never mind me. I can keep along behind you. Go as fast as you
can."</p>

<p>"Let me have the blanket," said Mickey, drawing it from his grasp.
"Now come ahead, for we have got to go it like monkeys."</p>

<p>He turned and bent to his task with the recklessness of despair,
for, even in that dreadful crisis, he thought more of the little
fellow than he did of himself. If he could have been assured of
his safety, he would have been ready to wheel about and meet his
score or more of foes, and fight them single-handed, as Leonidas
and his band did at Thermopylae. But the fate of the two was linked
together, and, sink or swim, it must be fulfilled in company.</p>

<p>The narrow, wooded ravine, in which they had taken enforced refuge,
was only three or four feet in width, the bottom sloping irregularly
upward, at an angle of forty five degrees. So long as this continued,
so long could they maintain their laboring ascent to the top.
Mickey had strong hopes that, with the advantage of the start,
they might reach that point far enough in advance of their pursuers
to secure some other concealment that would serve them till nightfall,
when they could steal out and try their chances again.</p>

<p>The saplings growing at every inclination afforded them much
assistance, as they were able to seize hold with one or both hands,
and thus help themselves along. But the vines in many places were
of a peculiar running nature and they frequently caught their
feet and stumbled; but they were instantly up and at it again.
All at once Mickey, who was scarcely an arm's length in advance,
halted so abruptly that Fred ran plump against him.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go on?" asked the panting lad.</p>

<p>"I can't. Here's the end."</p>

<p>So it was, indeed. While pressing forward with undiminished effort,
the Irishman found himself suddenly confronted with a solid, perpendicular
wall of rock. The narrow chasm, or fissure, terminated.</p>

<p>It was like a fugitive, his heart beating high with hope, checked
in his flight by the obtrusion of the Great Chinese Wall across
his path. Mickey looked upward. As he stood, he could, with outstretched
arms, touch the wall on his right and left, and kick the one in
front&mdash;the only open route being in the rear, which was commanded
by the Apache party. As he did so, he saw, through the interstices
of the interweaving, straggling branches, the clear, blue sky,
with the edge of the fissure fully forty feet above his head.
His first hope was that some of the saplings around him were lofty
enough to permit him to use them as a ladder; but the tallest
did not approach within a half dozen yards of the top. They were
shut in on every hand.</p>

<p>"We can't run any further," said the Irishman, after a hasty
glance at the situation. "We are cotched as fairly as ever was
a mouse in a trap, and it now remains for us to peg away, and
go under doing the best we can. Have ye your pistol?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I picked it up again, after throwing it in the face of
the grizzly, but it isn't loaded."</p>

<p>"Then it ain't of much account, as me mither used to say in her
affectionate references to me father; but if one of the spalpeens
happen to come onto ye too suddent like, ye might scare him by
shoving that into his eyes. I've got the powder for the same,
but the bullets won't fit it, so I'll have to do the shooting."</p>

<p>They were at bay and the Irishman was right in his declaration
that they could do nothing but fight it out as best they might.
The question of further flight was settled by the trap in which
they were caught.</p>

<p>They paused, expecting to hear the tramp of the Indians behind
them, but, as it continued quiet, Mickey ventured upon a more
critical inspection of their fortress, as it may be termed. He
found little which has not already been mentioned, except the
fact that the wall on their left sloped inward, as it ascended,
to such a degree that the width at the top was several feet less
than at the bottom. This was an important advantage, for, in case
they were attacked from above, it was in their power to place
themselves beyond the immediate reach of a whole war party by
any means at their command.</p>

<p>"Do ye hear anything?" asked Mickey, bending his head to listen.</p>

<p>They were silent a few minutes, during which the occasional tramp
of a horse's hoof was noted. Beyond a doubt, the entire war-party
of Apaches were at the mouth of the fissure and probably a number
had already entered it.</p>

<p>"They haven't tried to rush in pell-mell, head-over-heels," added
Mickey, after they had stood thus a short time; but they are sneaking
along, just as they always do when they're on the thrack of a
gintleman."</p>

<p>"How soon do you think they will be here?" asked Fred, who had
recovered his breath, and who began to feel something like a renewal
of hope, faint though it might be, at the continued silence of
their foes.</p>

<p>"Can't say, me laddy; but they may come any minute, and we must
keep eyes and ears open, and be ready to do the last act in style.
Don't ye mind that we're very much in the same fix that we was
when cotched in the cave, barring that we're worse off here than
we were there? If some one should let a lasso down from the top,
we might climb up just as we did there; but that's one of the
things that ain't likely to happen."</p>

<p>"Suppose we creep back a ways to see what the Indians are doing,"
ventured Fred, who was puzzled at the silence of their enemies,
which had now continued for some time.</p>

<p>"No need of doing that just yet. They'll let us know what they're
at and what they mane&mdash;whisht!"</p>

<p>At that juncture the Irishman detected a movement among the wood
and undergrowth of the ravine, and his rifle was at his shoulder
like a flash. Fred understood, or, rather, suspected, the cause
of the trouble, though he saw nothing. Only a few seconds elapsed
when the trigger was pulled. The sharp crack of the weapon had
scarcely broke the stillness when the shriek of a warrior was
heard only a few feet away, followed by a threshing of the vines
and vegetation, as the comrades of the slain brave caught and
hurriedly dragged him back toward the greater ravine beyond.</p>

<p>"That'll taich 'em to be more respictful in the traitment of
gintlemen," remarked Mickey, who had recovered something of his
natural recklessness, and was reloading his gun with as much <em>sangfroid</em>
as though he had just dropped an antelope, and wished to be ready
for another that was expected along the same path.</p>

<p>Fred had detected the rustling movement among the shrubbery made
by the redskin in stealing upon them, but he saw nothing of the
savage himself, and was not a little startled when his friend
fired so quickly, and the result was so manifest.</p>

<p>If the victim of this rather hastily fired shot was unable to
appreciate the lesson from its having a too personal application
to himself, his companions appreciated it fully. It taught them
that the way of pursuit was not open and undisputed by any means,
and the few who were hurrying forward rather rashly were not only
checked, but forced backward. Matters, for the moment, were brought
to a stand still.</p>

<p>"They'll be back again," added Mickey, after reloading his piece,
"and, as they mean to have our topknots, as the hunters say, we'll
wipe out as many as we kin before they git them. And now, me laddy,
will ye allow me to make a suggestion?"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"That ye kaap a little more out of raich. If one of the spalpeens
craap up, and shoots ye dead, ye'll be sorry ye didn't take me
advice, when ye come to think the matter over coolly. Here's a
sort of boulder which seems to have cared in from above. Do ye
squaze in behind that."</p>

<p>"And what will you do?" asked Fred, acting upon his advice.</p>

<p>"Being as there isn't room to squaze in wid ye, I'll take my
stand a little out here, where I can secure the protection of
a similar piece of masonry, and where the spalpeens can't git
by me without giving the countersign and showing a pass."</p>

<p>The lad did not specially like this arrangement, as it really
retired him, but their quarters were so cramped that they had
to dispose of themselves as best they could. He was obliged to
feel that practically he was of no account, as his only pistol
had become useless hours before. Accordingly, he forced himself
in behind the boulder pointed out, and found that his position
was safe against any treacherous shot from the front.</p>

<p>He was uneasy, however, about the open space above him, for it
struck him that it would be so easy for any of their foes to roll
the rocks down upon their heads. When he came to examine the situation
more critically, he was not a little relieved to find that he
was protected by the sloping wall, already mentioned. A heavy
stone heaved over the opening above might really weigh a ton,
and come crashing downward with terrific force, but no skill could,
at the start, cause its course to be such as to injure the lad.
He therefore concluded that his friend Mickey was not unwise in
placing him in such a refuge.</p>
