<p>Many toasts were uproariously honored, the health of each member
of the party in turn, then the country of each: France and England
first, out of courtesy to the ladies, Italy next, since this beautiful
and extraordinary meeting of distinguished people (as Mellin remarked
in a short speech he felt called upon to make) took place in that
wonderful land, then the United States. This last toast the gentlemen
felt it necessary to honor by standing in their chairs.</p>

<p>[<em>Song: The Star-Spangled Banner&mdash;without words&mdash;by Mr. Cooley
and chorus.</em>]</p>

<p>When the cigars were brought, the ladies graciously remained,
adding tiny spirals of smoke from their cigarettes to the layers
of blue haze which soon overhung the table. Through this haze,
in the gentle light (which seemed to grow softer and softer) Mellin
saw the face of Helene de Vaurigard, luminous as an angel's. She
<em>was</em> an angel&mdash;and the others were gods. What could be
more appropriate in Rome? Lady Mount-Rhyswicke was Juno, but more
beautiful. For himself, he felt like a god too, Olympic in serenity.</p>

<p>He longed for mysterious dangers. How debonair he would stroll
among them! He wished to explore the unknown; felt the need of
a splendid adventure, and had a happy premonition that one was
coming nearer and nearer. He favored himself with a hopeful vision
of the apartment on fire, Robert Russ Mellin smiling negligently
among the flames and Madame de Vaurigard kneeling before him in
adoration. Immersed in delight, he puffed his cigar and let his
eyes rest dreamily upon the face of Helene. He was quite undisturbed
by an argument, more a commotion than a debate, between Mr. Pedlow
and young Cooley. It ended by their rising, the latter overturning
a chair in his haste.</p>

<p>"I don't know the rudiments, don't I!" cried the boy. "You wait!
Ole Sneydie and I'll trim you down! Corni says he'll play, too.
Come on, Mellin."</p>

<p>"I won't go unless Helene goes," said Mellin. "What are you going
to do when you get there?"</p>

<p>"Alas, my frien'!" exclaimed Madame de Vaurigard, rising, "is
it not what I tol' you? Always you are never content wizout your
play. You come to dinner an' when it is finish' you play, play,
play!"</p>

<p>"<em>Play</em>?" He sprang to his feet. "Bravo! That's the very
thing I've been wanting to do. I knew there was something I wanted
to do, but I couldn't think what it was."</p>

<p>Lady Mount-Rhyswicke followed the others into the salon, but
Madame de Vaurigard waited just inside the doorway for Mellin.</p>

<p>"<em>High</em> play!" he cried. "We must play high! I won't play
any other way. &mdash;I want to play <em>high</em>!"</p>

<p>"Ah, wicked one! What did I tell you?"</p>

<p>He caught her hand. "And you must play too, Helene."</p>

<p>"No, no," she laughed breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Then you'll watch. Promise you'll watch me. I won't let you
go till you promise to watch me."</p>

<p>"I shall adore it, my frien'!"</p>

<p>"Mellin," called Cooley from the other room. "You comin' or not?"</p>

<p>"Can't you see me?" answered Mellin hilariously, entering with
Madame de Vaurigard, who was rosy with laughter. "Peculiar thing
to look at a man and not see him."</p>

<p>Candles were lit in many sconces on the walls, and the card-table
had been pushed to the centre of the room, little towers of blue,
white and scarlet counters arranged upon it in orderly rows like
miniature castles.</p>

<p>"Now, then," demanded Cooley, "are the ladies goin' to play?"</p>

<p>"Never!" cried Madame de Vaurigard.</p>

<p>"All right," said the youth cheerfully; "you can look on. Come
and sit by me for a mascot."</p>

<p>"You'll need a mascot, my boy!" shouted Pedlow. "That's right,
though; take her."</p>

<p>He pushed a chair close to that in which Cooley had already seated
himself, and Madame de Vaurigard dropped into it, laughing. "Mellin,
you set there," he continued, pushing the young man into a seat
opposite Cooley. "We'll give both you young fellers a mascot."
He turned to Lady Mount-Rhyswicke, who had gone to the settee
by the fire. "Madge, you come and set by Mellin," he commanded
jovially. "Maybe he'll forget you ain't a widow again."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I care much about bein' anybody's mascot to-night,"
she answered. There was a hint of anger in her tired monotone.</p>

<p>"What?" He turned from the table and walked over to the fireplace.
"I reckon I didn't understand you," he said quietly, almost gently.
"You better come, hadn't you?"</p>

<p>She met his inscrutable little eyes steadily. A faint redness
slowly revealed itself on her powdered cheeks; then she followed
him back to the table and took the place he had assigned to her
at Mellin's elbow.</p>

<p>"I'll bank," said Pedlow, taking a chair between Cooley and the
Italian, "unless somebody wants to take it off my hands. Now,
what are we playing?"</p>

<p>"Pokah," responded Sneyd with mild sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried Mellin. "That's <em>my</em> game. Ber-<em>ravo!</em>"</p>

<p>This was so far true: it was the only game upon which he had
ever ventured money; he had played several times when the wagers
were allowed to reach a limit of twenty-five cents.</p>

<p>"You know what I mean, I reckon," said Pedlow. "I mean what we
are playin' <em>fer</em>?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five franc limit," responded Cooley authoritatively.
"Double for jacks. Play two hours and settle when we quit."</p>

<p>Mellin leaned back in his chair. "You call that high?" he asked,
with a sniff of contempt. "Why not double it?"</p>

<p>The fat man hammered the table with his fist delightedly. "'He's
game,' she says. 'He's the gamest little Indian ever come down
the big road!' she says. Was she right? What? Maybe she wasn't!
We'll double it before very long, my boy; this'll do to start
on. There." He distributed some of the small towers of ivory counters
and made a memorandum in a notebook. "There's four hundred apiece."</p>

<p>"That all?" inquired Mellin, whereupon Mr. Pedlow uproariously
repeated Madame de Vaurigard's alleged tribute.</p>

<p>As the game began, the intelligent-looking maid appeared from
the dining-room, bearing bottles of whisky and soda, and these
she deposited upon small tables at the convenience of the players,
so that at the conclusion of the first encounter in the gentle
tournament there was material for a toast to the gallant who had
won it.</p>

<p>"Here's to the gamest Indian of us all," proposed the fat man.
"Did you notice him call me with a pair of tens? And me queen-high!"</p>

<p>Mellin drained a deep glass in honor of himself. "On my soul,
Chan' Pedlow, I think you're the bes' fellow in the whole world,"
he said gratefully. "Only trouble with you&mdash;you don't want to
play high enough."</p>

<p>He won again and again, adding other towers of counters to his
original allotment, so that he had the semblance of a tiny castle.
When the cards had been dealt for the fifth time he felt the light
contact of a slipper touching his foot under the table.</p>

<p>That slipper, he decided (from the nature of things) could belong
to none other than his Helene, and even as he came to this conclusion
the slight pressure against his foot was gently but distinctly
increased thrice. He pressed the slipper in return with his shoe,
at the same time giving Madame de Vaurigard a look of grateful
surprise and tenderness, which threw her into a confusion so evidently
genuine that for an unworthy moment he had a jealous suspicion
she had meant the little caress for some other.</p>

<p>It was a disagreeable thought, and, in the hope of banishing
it, he refilled his glass; but his mood had begun to change. It
seemed to him that Helene was watching Cooley a great deal too
devotedly. Why had she consented to sit by Cooley, when she had
promised to watch Robert Russ Mellin? He observed the pair stealthily.</p>

<p>Cooley consulted her in laughing whispers upon every discard,
upon every bet. Now and then, in their whisperings, Cooley's hair
touched hers; sometimes she laid her hand on his the more conveniently
to look at his cards. Mellin began to be enraged. Did she think
that puling milksop had as much as a shadow of the daring, the
devilry, the carelessness of consequences which lay within Robert
Russ Mellin? "Consequences?" What were they? There were no such
things! She would not look at him&mdash;well, he would make her! Thenceforward
he raised every bet by another to the extent of the limit agreed
upon.</p>

<p>Mr. Cooley was thoroughly happy. He did not resemble Ulysses;
he would never have had himself bound to the mast; and there were
already sounds of unearthly sweetness in his ears. His conferences
with his lovely hostess easily consoled him for his losses. In
addition, he was triumphing over the boaster, for Mr. Pedlow,
with a very ill grace and swearing (not under his breath), was
losing too. The Countess, reiterating for the hundredth time that
Cooley was a "wicked one,"  sweetly constituted herself his cup-bearer;
kept his glass full and brought him fresh cigars.</p>

<p>Mellin dealt her furious glances, and filled his own glass, for
Lady Mount-Rhyswicke plainly had no conception of herself in the
role of a Hebe. The hospitable Pedlow, observing this neglect,
was moved to chide her.</p>

<p>"Look at them two cooing doves over there," he said reproachfully,
a jerk of his bulbous thumb indicating Madame de Vaurigard and
her young protege. "Madge, can't you do nothin' fer our friend
the Indian? Can't you even help him to sody?"</p>

<p>"Oh, perhaps," she answered with the slightest flash from her
tired eyes. Then she nonchalantly lifted Mellin's replenished
glass from the table and drained it. This amused Cooley.</p>

<p>"I like that!" he chuckled. "That's one way of helpin' a feller!
Helene, can you do any better than that?"</p>

<p>"Ah, this dear, droll Cooley!"</p>

<p>The tantalizing witch lifted the youth's glass to his lips and
let him drink, as a mother helps a thirsty child. "<em>Bebe!</em>"
she laughed endearingly.</p>

<p>As the lovely Helene pronounced that word, Lady Mount-Rhyswicke
was leaning forward to replace Mellin's empty glass upon the table.</p>

<p>"I don't care whether you're a widow or not!" he shouted furiously.
And he resoundingly kissed her massive shoulder.</p>

<p>There was a wild shout of laughter; even the imperturbable Sneyd
(who had continued to win steadily) wiped tears from his eyes,
and Madame de Vaurigard gave way to intermittent hysteria throughout
the ensuing half-hour.</p>

<p>For a time Mellin sat grimly observing this inexplicable merriment
with a cold smile.</p>

<p>"Laugh on!" he commanded with bitter satire, some ten minutes
after play had been resumed&mdash;and was instantly obeyed.</p>

<p>Whereupon his mood underwent another change, and he became convinced
that the world was a warm and kindly place, where it was good
to live. He forgot that he was jealous of Cooley and angry with
the Countess; he liked everybody again, especially Lady Mount-Rhyswicke.
"Won't you sit farther forward?" he begged her earnestly; "so
that I can see your beautiful golden hair?"</p>

<p>He heard but dimly the spasmodic uproar that followed. "Laugh
on!" he repeated with a swoop of his arm. "I don't care! Don't
you care either, Mrs. Mount-Rhyswicke. Please sit where I can
see your beautiful golden hair. Don't be afraid I'll kiss you
again. I wouldn't do it for the whole world. You're one of the
noblest women I ever knew. I feel that's true. I don't know how
I know it, but I know it. Let 'em laugh!"</p>

<p>After this everything grew more and more hazy to him. For a time
there was, in the centre of the haze, a nimbus of light which
revealed his cards to him and the towers of chips which he constantly
called for and which as constantly disappeared&mdash;like the towers
of a castle in Spain. Then the haze thickened, and the one thing
clear to him was a phrase from an old-time novel he had read long
ago:</p>

<p>"Debt of honor."</p>

<p>The three words appeared to be written in flames against a background
of dense fog. A debt of honor was as promissory note which had
to be paid on Monday, and the appeal to the obdurate grandfather&mdash;a
peer of England, the Earl of Mount-Rhyswicke, in fact&mdash;was made
at midnight, Sunday. The fog grew still denser, lifted for a moment
while he wrote his name many times on slips of blue paper; closed
down once more, and again lifted&mdash;out-of-doors this time&mdash;to show
him a lunatic ballet of moons dancing streakily upon the horizon.</p>

<p>He heard himself say quite clearly, "All right, old man, thank
you; but don't bother about me," to a pallid but humorous Cooley
in evening clothes; the fog thickened; oblivion closed upon him
for a seeming second....</p>
