<p>As in similar cases of the same disease Hamil's progress toward
recovery was scarcely appreciable for a fortnight or so, then,
danger of reinfection practically over, convalescence began with
the new moon of May.</p>

<p>Other things also began about that time, including a lawsuit
against Portlaw, the lilacs, jonquils, and appleblossoms in Shiela's
garden, and Malcourt's capricious journeys to New York on business
concerning which he offered no explanation to anybody.</p>

<p>The summons bidding William Van Beuren Portlaw of Camp Chickadee,
town of Pride's Fall, Horican County, New York, to defend a suit
for damages arising from trespass, tree-felling, the malicious
diversion of the waters of Painted Creek, the wilful and deliberate
killing of game, the flooding of wild meadow lands in contemptuous
disregard of riparian rights and the drowning of certain sheep
thereby, had been impending since the return from Florida to her
pretty residence at Pride's Fall of Mrs. Alida Ascott.</p>

<p>Trouble had begun the previous autumn with a lively exchange
of notes between them concerning the shooting of woodcock on Mrs.
Ascott's side of the boundary. Then Portlaw stupidly built a dam
and diverted the waters of Painted Creek. Having been planned,
designed, and constructed according to Portlaw's own calculations,
the dam presently burst and the escaping flood drowned some of
Mrs. Ascott's sheep. Then somebody cut some pine timber on her
side of the line and Mrs. Ascott's smouldering indignation flamed.</p>

<p>Personally she and Portlaw had been rather fond of one another;
and to avoid trouble incident on hot temper Alida Ascott decamped,
intending to cool off in the Palm Beach surf and think it over;
but she met Portlaw at Palm Beach that winter, and Portlaw dodged
the olive branch and neglected her so selfishly that she determined
then and there upon his punishment, now long overdue.</p>

<p>"My Lord!" said Portlaw plaintively to Malcourt, "I had no idea
she'd do such a thing to me; had you?"</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you she would?" said Malcourt. "I know women better
than you do, though you don't believe it."</p>

<p>"But I thought she was rather fond of me!" protested Portlaw
indignantly.</p>

<p>"That may be the reason she's going to chasten you, friend. Don't
come bleating to me; I advised you to be attentive to her at Palm
Beach, but you sulked and stood about like a baby-hippopotamus
and pouted and shot your cuffs. I warned you to be agreeable to
her, but you preferred the Beach Club and pigeon shooting. It's
easy enough to amuse yourself and be decent to a nice woman too.
Even I can combine those things."</p>

<p>"Didn't I go to that lawn party?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and scarcely spoke to her. And never went near her afterward.
Now she's mad all through."</p>

<p>"Well, I can get mad, too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you're too plump to ever become angry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think I'm going to submit to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll submit all right when they've dragged you twenty-eight
miles to the county court house once or twice."</p>

<p>"Louis! Are you against me too?"&mdash;in a voice vibrating with reproach
and self-pity.</p>

<p>"Now, look here, William Van Beuren; your guests <em>did</em>
shoot woodcock on Mrs. Ascott's land&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're migratory birds, confound it!"</p>

<p>" &mdash;And," continued Malcourt, paying no attention to the
interruption, "you did build that fool dam regardless of my advice;
and you first left her cattle waterless, then drowned her sheep&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was a cloud-burst&mdash;an act of God&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was a dam-burst, and the act of an obstinate chump!"</p>

<p>"Louis, I won't let anybody talk to me like that!"</p>

<p>"But you've just <em>done</em> it, William."</p>

<p>Portlaw, in a miniature fury, began to run around in little circles,
puffing threats which, however, he was cautious enough to make
obscure; winding up with:</p>

<p>"And I might as well take this opportunity to ask you what you
mean by calmly going off to town every ten days or so and absenting
yourself without a word of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, bosh," said Malcourt; "if you don't want me here, Billy,
say so and be done with it."</p>

<p>"I didn't say I didn't want you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, then, let me alone. I don't neglect your business and
I don't intend to neglect my own. If the time comes when I can't
attend to both I'll let you know soon enough&mdash;perhaps sooner than
you expect."</p>

<p>"You're perfectly welcome to go to town," insisted Portlaw, alarmed.</p>

<p>"I know it," nodded Malcourt coolly. "Now, if you'll take my
advice you'll behave less like a pig in this Ascott matter."</p>

<p>"I'm going to fight that suit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly fight it. But not the way you're planning."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;how, then?"</p>

<p>"Go and see the little lady."</p>

<p>"See <em>her</em>? She wouldn't receive me."</p>

<p>"Probably not. That's unimportant. For heaven's sake, Portlaw,
you're becoming chuckle-headed with all your feeding and inertia
and pampered self-indulgence. You're the limit!&mdash;with your thirty-eight-inch
girth and your twin chins and baby wrists! You know, it's pitiable
when I think what a clean-cut, decent-looking, decently set-up
fellow you were only two years ago!&mdash;it's enough to make a cat
sick!"</p>

<p>"Can I help what I look like!" bellowed Portlaw wrathfully.</p>

<p>"What an idiot question!" said Malcourt with weary patience.
"All you've got to do is to cuddle yourself less, and go out into
the fresh air on your ridiculous legs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ridiculous!" gasped the other. "Well, I'm damned if I stand
<em>that</em>&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"You won't be able to stand at all if you continue eating and
sitting in arm-chairs. You don't like what I say, do you?" with
easy impudence. "Well, I said it to sting you&mdash;if there's any
sensation left under your hide. And I'll say something else: if
you'd care for somebody beside yourself for a change and give
the overworked Ego a vacation, you'd get along with your pretty
neighbour yonder. Oh, yes, you would; she was quite inclined to
like you before you began to turn, physically, into a stall-fed
prize winner. You're only thirty-seven or eight; you've a reasonable
chance yet to exchange obesity for perspicacity before it smothers
what intellect remains. And if you're anything except what you're
beginning to resemble you'll stop sharp, behave yourself, go to
see your neighbour, and"&mdash;with a shrug&mdash;"marry her. Marriage&mdash;as
easy a way out of trouble as it is in."</p>

<p>He swung carelessly on his heel, supple, erect, graceful as always.</p>

<p>"But," he threw back over his shoulder, "you'd better acquire
the rudiments of a figure before you go a-courting Alida Ascott."
And left Portlaw sitting petrified in his wadded chair.</p>

<p>Malcourt strolled on, a humorously malicious smile hovering near
his eyes, but his face grew serious as he glanced up at Hamil's
window. He had not seen Hamil during his illness or his convalescence&mdash;had
made no attempt to, evading lightly the casual suggestions of
Portlaw that he and his young wife pay Hamil a visit; nor did
he appear to take anything more than a politely perfunctory interest
in the sick man's progress; yet Constance Palliser had often seen
him pacing the lawn under Hamil's window long after midnight during
those desperate hours when the life-flame scarcely flickered&mdash;those
ominous moments when so many souls go out to meet the impending
dawn.</p>

<p>But now, in the later stages of Hamil's rapid convalescence which
is characteristic of a healthy recovery from that unpleasant malady,
Malcourt avoided the cottage, even ceased to inquire; and Hamil
had never asked to see him, although, for appearance' sake, he
knew that he must do so very soon.</p>

<p>Wayward and Constance Palliser were visiting Mrs. Ascott at Pride's
Fall; young Mrs. Malcourt had been there for a few days, but was
returning to prepare for the series of house-parties arranged
by Portlaw who had included Cecile Cardross and Philip Gatewood
in the first relay.</p>

<p>As for Malcourt there was no counting on him; he was likely to
remain for several days at any of the five distant gate-keepers'
lodges across the mountains or to be mousing about the woods with
wardens and foresters, camping where convenient; or to start for
New York without explanation. All of which activity annoyed Portlaw,
who missed his manager at table and at cards&mdash;missed his nimble
humour, his impudence, his casual malice&mdash;missed even the paternal
toleration which this younger man bestowed upon him&mdash;a sort of
half-tolerant, half-contemptuous supervision.</p>

<p>And now that Malcourt was so often absent Portlaw was surprised
to find how much he missed the veiled authority exercised&mdash;how
dependent on it he had become, how secretly agreeable had been
the half-mocking discipline which relieved him of any responsibility
except as over-lord of the culinary régime.</p>

<p>Like a spoiled school-lad, badly brought up, he sometimes defied
Malcourt's authority&mdash;as in the matter of the dam&mdash;enjoying his
own perversity. But he always got into hot water and was glad
enough to return to safety.</p>

<p>Even now, though his truancy had landed him in a very lively
lawsuit, he was glad enough to slink back through the stinging
comments to the security of authority; and his bellows of exasperation
under reproof were half pretence. He expected Malcourt to get
him out of it if he could not extract himself; he had no idea
of defending the suit. Besides there was sufficient vanity in
him to rely on a personal meeting with Mrs. Ascott. But he laughed
in his sleeve at the idea of the necessity of making love to her.</p>

<p>And one day when Hamil was out for the third or fourth time,
walking about the drives and lawns in the sunshine, and Malcourt
was not in sight, Portlaw called for his riding-breeches and boots.</p>

<p>He had not been on a horse in years and it seemed as though only
faith and a shoe-horn could get him into his riding-breeches;
but with the aid of Heaven and a powerful valet he stood before
his mirror arrayed at last; and presently went out across the
lawn and through the grove to Malcourt's house.</p>

<p>Young Mrs. Malcourt in pink gingham apron and sun-bonnet was
digging with a trowel in her garden when he appeared upon the
landscape.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to tell Louis," he cautioned her with a very
knowing and subtle smile, "but I'm just going to ride over to
Pride's this morning and settle this lawsuit matter, and surprise
him."</p>

<p>Shiela had straightened up, trowel in her gloved hand, and now
stood looking at him in amused surprise.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you rode," she said. "I should think it would
be very good for you."</p>

<p>"Well," he admitted, turning red, "I suppose I ought to ride
now and then. Louis has been at me rather viciously. But you won't
tell him, will you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Shiela.</p>

<p>"Because, you see, he doesn't think me capable of settling this
thing; and so I'm just going to gallop over and have a little
friendly chat with Mrs. Ascott&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Friendly?" very gravely.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, alarmed; "why not?"</p>

<p>"Do you think Mrs. Ascott will receive you?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;now &mdash;Louis said something of that sort. And then
he added that it didn't matter&mdash;but he didn't explain what I was
to do when she refused to see me.... Ah&mdash;could&mdash;would you mind
telling me what to do in that case, Mrs. Malcourt?"</p>

<p>"What <em>is</em> there to do, Mr. Portlaw, if a woman refuses
to receive you?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;<em>I</em> don't know," he admitted vacantly. "What would
<em>you</em> do?"</p>

<p>Young Mrs. Malcourt, frankly amused, shook her head:</p>

<p>"If Mrs. Ascott won't see you, she <em>won't</em>! You don't
intend to carry Pride's Fall by assault, do you?"</p>

<p>"But Louis said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Malcourt knows quite well that Mrs. Ascott won't see you."</p>

<p>"W-why?"</p>

<p>"Ask yourself. Besides, her lawyers have forbidden her."</p>

<p>But Portlaw's simple faith in Malcourt never wavered; he stood
his ground and quoted him naïvely, adding: "You see Louis must
have meant <em>something</em>. Couldn't you tell me what he meant?
I'll promise to do it."</p>

<p>"I suppose," she answered, laughing, "that he meant me to write
a note to Alida Ascott, making a personal appeal for your reception.
He spoke of it; but, Mr. Portlaw, I am scarcely on such a footing
with her."</p>

<p>Portlaw was so innocently delighted with the idea which bore
Malcourt's stamp of authority, that young Mrs. Malcourt found
it difficult to refuse; and a few moments later, armed with a
friendly but cautious note, he climbed laboriously aboard a huge
chestnut hack, sat there doubtfully while a groom made all fast
and tight for heavy weather, then, with a groan, set spurs to
his mount, and went pounding away through the forest, upon diplomacy
intent.</p>

<p>Hamil, walking about the lawns in the sunshine, saw him come
careering past, making heavy weather of it, and smiled in salute;
Shiela on a rustic ladder, pruning-knife in hand, gazed over her
garden wall until the woods swallowed rotund rider and steed.
As she turned to descend, her glance fell upon Hamil who was crossing
the lawn directly below. For a moment they looked at each other
without sign of recognition; then scarcely aware of what she did
she made him a carelessly gay salute with her pruning-knife, clinging
to the ladder with the other hand in sheer fear of falling, so
suddenly unsteady her limbs and body.</p>

<p>He went directly toward her; and she, her knees scarcely supporting
her, mounted the last rung of the ladder and seated herself sidewise
on the top of the wall, looking down at him, leaning on one arm.</p>

<p>"It is nice to see you out," she said, as he came to the foot
of the sunny wall.... "Do you really feel as thin as you look?...
I had a letter from your aunt to-day asking an outsider's opinion
of your condition, and now I'll be able to give it.... You do
look pathetically thin&mdash;but I shan't tell her that.... If you
are tired standing up you may come into my garden where there
are some very agreeable benches.... I would like to have you come
if you care to."</p>

<p>She herself scarcely knew what she was saying; smile, voice,
animation were forced; the havoc of his illness stared at her
from his sharp cheek-bones, thin, bloodless hands, eyes still
slow in turning, dull, heavy-lidded.</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps you would come to call," he said listlessly.</p>

<p>She flushed.</p>

<p>"You <em>did</em> come, once?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You did not come again while I was conscious, did you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He passed his thin hand across eyes and forehead.</p>

<p>She folded her arms under her breast and hung far over the shadow-dappled
wall half-screened in young vine-leaves. Over her pink sun-bonnet
and shoulders the hot spring sunshine fell; her face was in shadow;
his, under the full glare of the unclouded sky, every ravage starkly
revealed. And she could not turn her fascinated gaze or crush
out the swelling tenderness that closed her throat to speech and
set her eyes glimmering.</p>

<p>The lids closed, slowly; she leaned there without a word, living
through in the space of a dozen pulse-beats, the agony and sweetness
of the past; then laid her flushed cheek on her arms and opened
her eyes, looking at him in silence.</p>

<p>But he dared not sustain her gaze and took refuge from it in
a forced gaiety, comparing his reappearance to the return of Ulysses,
where Dame Art, that respectable old Haus-Frau, awaited him in
a rocking-chair, chastely preoccupied with her tatting, while
rival architects squatted anxiously around her, urging their claims
to a dead man's shoes.</p>

<p>She strove to smile at him and to speak coolly: "Will you come
in? I have finished the vines and presently I'm going to dig.
Wait a moment"&mdash;looking behind her and searching with one tentative
foot for the ladder&mdash;"I will have to let you in&mdash;"</p>

<p>A moment later she met him at the grille and flung it wide, holding
out her hand in welcome with a careless frankness not quite natural&mdash;nor
was the nervously vigorous handshake, nor the laughter, light
as a breeze, leaving her breathing fast and unevenly with the
hue of excitement deepening on lip and cheek.</p>

<p>So, the handshaking safely over, and chatting together in a tone
louder and more animated than usual, they walked down the moist
gravel path together&mdash;the extreme width of the path apart.</p>

<p>"I think," she said, considering the question, with small head
tipped sideways, "that you had better sit on this bench because
the paint is dry and besides I can talk to you here and dig up
these seedling larkspurs at the same time."</p>

<p>"Don't you want me to do some weeding?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure when you are a little stronger&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm all right now&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stood looking seriously at the bare flower-bed along the wall
where amber shoots of peonies were feathering out into palmate
grace, and older larkspurs had pushed up into fringed mounds of
green foliage.</p>

<p>She had knelt down on the bed's edge, trowel in hand, pink sun-bonnet
fallen back neglected; and with blade and gloved fingers she began
transferring the irresponsible larkspur seedlings to the confines
of their proper spheres, patting each frail little plant into
place caressingly.</p>

<p>And he was thinking of her as he had last seen her&mdash;on her knees
at the edge of another bed, her hair fallen unheeded as her sun-bonnet
hung now, and the small hands clasping, twisting, very busy with
their agony&mdash;as busy as her gloved fingers were now, restlessly
in motion among the thickets of living green.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she said, not looking back over her shoulder, "it
must be heavenly to be out of doors again."</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> rather pleasant," he assented.</p>

<p>"Did you&mdash;they said you had dreadful visions. Did you?"</p>

<p>He laughed. "Some of them were absurd, Shiela; the most abominably
grotesque creatures came swarming and crowding around the bed&mdash;faces
without bodies&mdash;creatures that grew while I looked at them, swelling
to gigantic proportions &mdash;Oh, it was a merry carnival&mdash;"</p>

<p>Neither spoke. Her back was toward him as she knelt there very
much occupied with her straying seedlings in the cool shade of
the wall.</p>

<p>Jonquils in heavy golden patches stretched away into sun-flecked
perspective broken by the cool silver-green of iris thickets and
the white star-clusters of narcissus nodding under sprays of bleeding-heart.</p>

<p>The air was sweet with the scent of late apple-bloom and lilac&mdash;and
Hamil, brooding there on his bench in the sun, clasped his thin
hands over his walking-stick and bent his head to the fragrant
memories of Calypso's own perfume&mdash;the lilac-odour of China-berry
in bloom, under the Southern stars.</p>

<p>He drew his breath sharply, raising his head&mdash;because this sort
of thing would not do to begin life with again.</p>

<p>"How is Louis?" he asked in a pleasantly deliberate voice.</p>

<p>The thing had to be said sooner or later. They both knew that.
It was over now, with no sign of effort, nothing in his voice
or manner to betray him. Fortunately for him her face was turned
away&mdash;fortunately for her, too.</p>

<p>There was a few moments' silence; the trowel, driven abruptly
into the earth to the hilt, served as a prop for her clinched
hand.</p>

<p>"I think &mdash;Louis&mdash;is very well," she said.</p>

<p>"He is remaining permanently with Mr. Portlaw?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"I hope it will be agreeable for you&mdash;both."</p>

<p>"It is a very beautiful country." She rose to her slender, graceful
height and surveyed her work: "A pretty country, a pretty house
and garden," she said steadily. "After all, you know, that is
the main thing in this world."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Why, an agreeable environment; isn't it?"</p>

<p>She turned smilingly, walked to the bench and seated herself.</p>

<p>"Your environment promises to be a little lonely at times," he
ventured.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. But I rather like it, when it's not over-populated.
There will be a great deal for me to do in my garden&mdash;teaching
young plants self-control."</p>

<p>"Gardens freeze up, Shiela."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true."</p>

<p>"But you'll have good shooting&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will never again draw trigger on any living thing!"</p>

<p>"What? The girl who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No girl, now&mdash;a woman who can never again bring herself to inflict
death."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I know better now."</p>

<p>"You rather astonish me?" he said, pretending amusement.</p>

<p>She sat very still, thoughtful eyes roaming, then rested her
chin on her hand, dropping one knee over the other to support
her elbow. And he saw the sensitive mouth droop a little, and
the white lids drooping too until the lashes rested on the bloom
of the curved cheek. So he had seen her, often, silent, absent-minded,
thoughts astray amid some blessed day-dream in that golden fable
they had lived&mdash;and died in.</p>

<p>She said, as though to herself: "How can a woman slay?... I think
those who have ever been victims of pain never desire to inflict
it again on any living thing."</p>

<p>She looked up humbly, searching his face.</p>

<p>"You know it has become such a dreadful thing to me&mdash;the responsibility
for pain and death.... It is horrible for humanity to usurp such
a power&mdash;to dare interfere with life&mdash;to mar it, end it!... Children
do not understand. I was nothing more a few months ago. To my
intelligence the shallow arguments of those takers of life called
sportsmen was sufficient. I supposed that because almost all the
little children of the wild were doomed to die by violence, sooner
or later, that the quicker death I offered was pardonable on the
score of mercy." ... She shook her head. "Why death and pain exist,
I do not know; He who deals them must know why."</p>

<p>He said, surprised at her seriousness: "Right or wrong, a matter
of taste cannot be argued&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A matter of taste! Every fibre of me rebels at the thought of
death&mdash;of inflicting it on anything. God knows how I could have
done it when I had so much of happiness myself!" She swung around
toward him:</p>

<p>"Sooner or later what remains to say between us must be said,
Garry. I think the time is now&mdash;here in my garden&mdash;in the clear
daylight of the young summer.... You have that last letter of
my girlhood?"</p>

<p>"I burned it."</p>

<p>"I have every letter you ever wrote me. They are in my desk upstairs.
The desk is not locked."</p>

<p>"Had you not better destroy them?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"As you wish," he said, looking at the ground.</p>

<p>"One keeps the letters of the dead," she said; "your youth and
mine"&mdash;she made a little gesture downward as though smoothing
a grave&mdash;daintily.</p>

<p>They were very unwise, sitting there in the sunshine side by
side, tremendously impressed with the catastrophe of life and
with each other&mdash;still young enough to be in earnest, to take
life and each other with that awesome finality which is the dread
privilege of youth.</p>

<p>She spoke with conviction of the mockery of life, of wisdom and
its sadness; he looked upon the world in all the serious disillusion
of youth, and saw it strewn with the fragments of their wrecked
happiness.</p>

<p>They were very emotional, very unhappy, very, very much in love;
but the truly pathetic part of it all lay in her innocent conviction
that a marriage witnessed by the world was a sanctuary within
the circle of which neither she nor he had any reason to fear
each other or themselves.</p>

<p>The thing was done; hope slain. They, the mourners, might now
meet in safety to talk together over the dead&mdash;suffer together
among the graves of common memories, sadly tracing, reverently
marking with epitaphs appropriate the tombs which held the dead
days of their youth.</p>

<p>Youth believes; Age is the sceptic. So they did not know that,
as nature abhors a vacuum, youth cannot long tolerate the vacuity
of grief. Rose vines, cut to the roots, climb the higher. No checking
ever killed a passion. Just now her inexperience was driving her
into platitudes.</p>

<p>"Dear Garry," she said gently, "it is such happiness to talk
to you like this; to know that you understand."</p>

<p>There is a regulation forbidding prisoners to converse upon the
subject of their misdemeanours, but neither he nor she seemed
to be aware of it.</p>

<p>Moreover, she was truly convinced that no nun in cloister was
as hopelessly certain of safety from world and flesh and devil
as was her heart and its meditations, under the aegis of admitted
wedlock.</p>

<p>She looked down at the ring she wore, and a faint shiver passed
over her.</p>

<p>"You are going to Mrs. Ascott?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to make her a Trianon and a smirking little park. I can't
quarrel with my bread and butter, but I wish people would let
these woods alone."</p>

<p>She sat very still and thoughtful, hands clasped on her knee.</p>

<p>"So you are going to Mrs. Ascott," she repeated. And, still thoughtful:
"I am so fond of Alida Ascott.... She is very pretty, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Very," he said absently.</p>

<p>"Don't you think so?"&mdash;warmly.</p>

<p>"I never met her but once."</p>

<p>She was considering him, the knuckle of one forefinger resting
against her chin in an almost childish attitude of thoughtful
perplexity.</p>

<p>"How long are you to remain there, Garry?"</p>

<p>"Where?"&mdash;coming out of abstraction.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;at Mrs. Ascott's?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know&mdash;a month, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Not longer?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell, Shiela."</p>

<p>Young Mrs. Malcourt fell silent, eyes on the ground, one knee
loosely crossed over the other, and her small foot swinging gently
above its blue shadow on the gravel.</p>

<p>Some details in the eternal scheme of things were troubling her
already; for one, the liberty of this man to come and go at will;
and the dawning perception of her own chaining.</p>

<p>It was curious, too, to be sitting here so idly beside him, and
realise that she had belonged to him so absolutely&mdash;remembering
the thousand thrilling intimacies that bound them immortally together&mdash;and
now to be actually so isolated, so beyond his reach, so alone,
so miserably certain of her soul's safety!... And now, for the
first time, she missed the pleasures of fear&mdash;the exquisite trepidation
that lay in unsafety&mdash;the blessed thrill of peril warning her
to avoid his eyes, his touch, his&mdash;lips.</p>

<p>She glanced uneasily at him, a slow side gaze; and met his eyes.</p>

<p>Her heart had begun beating faster; a glow grew in her veins;
she closed her eyes, sitting there surprised&mdash;not yet frightened.</p>

<p>Time throbbed on; rigid, motionless, she endured the pulsing
silence while the blood quickened till body and limbs seemed burning;
and suddenly, from heart to throat the tension tightened as though
a cry, echoing within her, was being strangled.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had better&mdash;go&mdash;" she managed to say.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>She looked down at her restless fingers interlacing, too confused
to be actually afraid of herself or him.</p>

<p>What was there to fear? What occult uneasiness was haunting them?
Where might lie any peril, now? How could the battle begin again
when all was quiet along the firing line&mdash;quiet with the quiet
of death? Do dead memories surge up into furies? Can dead hopes
burn again? Is there any resurrection for the insurgent passions
of the past laid for ever under the ban of wedlock? The fear within
her turned to impatience&mdash;to a proud incredulity.</p>

<p>And now she felt the calm reaction as though, unbidden, an ugly
