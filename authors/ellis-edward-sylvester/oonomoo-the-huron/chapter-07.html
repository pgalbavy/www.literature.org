Oft did he stoop a listening ear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweep round an anxious eye,<br/>
No bark or ax-blow could he hear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No human trace descry.<br/>
His sinuous path, by blazes, wound<br/>
Among trunks grouped in myriads round;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through naked boughs, between<br/>
Whose tangled architecture fraught<br/>
With many a shape grotesquely wrought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hemlock's spire was seen.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;A. B. <em>STREET</em>.

<p>By this time, daylight was at hand.  A thin mist, rising from
the river, was passing off through the woods; for the half-hour
preceding the appearance of the sun, the darkness was more palpable
than it had been at any time through the night.  The air, too,
had a disagreeable chilliness in it, which, however little it
affected the Huron, made the soldier, for the time being, exceedingly
uncomfortable and impatient for the full light of day.</p>

<p>The Shawnee village was about a mile distant, on the same bank
of the stream with that upon which our friends found themselves. 
As there was not the least probability of Hans Vanderbum being
astir for several hours yet, they proceeded at a moderate walk
through the wood.  One of the peculiar effects of this chilly
morning air was to keep Lieutenant Canfield constantly gaping;
his movements were so languid and his mind listless even to antipathy
for conversation.  He maintained his place in silence beside Oonomoo. 
The Indian was as watchful and keen as ever.</p>

<p>As the young Lieutenant was yawning, and gazing around listlessly,
he caught a glimpse of some body, as it threw itself prostrate
behind a clump of bushes.  He looked at the Huron and was startled
to observe upon his countenance no indication of having noticed
this singular occurrence.</p>

<p>"Oonomoo," he whispered, placing his hand upon his arm, "there's
a person behind the bush, and we are in danger.  I saw him this
very minute."</p>

<p>"Me see'd 'em," said the Indian, walking straight toward the
spot where he was concealed.</p>

<p>This was too much for the young man.  When he reflected that,
in all probability a rifle-barrel was leveled through those bushes,
ready to do its deadly work, he was not ashamed to halt and allow
the Huron to proceed alone.  But, no fear seemed to enter the
head of the Indian. He strode straight forward, as if he had discovered
something which he was about to pick, and, reaching the bushes,
he parted and stepped among them.  The astonished soldier saw
him stoop and lift some dark object, and then throw it down upon
the ground again.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Canfield now came forward.  Great was his amazement
to recognize, in this dark object, the negro, Cato!  He lay upon
his face, as lax and motionless as a piece of inanimate matter.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with him?" asked the soldier.  "Is he dead?"</p>

<p>"Scart near to def'&mdash;make b'lieve dead."</p>

<p>Such undoubtedly was the case.  The negro, frightened at the
appearance of two strangers, the foremost of whom he recognized
as an Indian, had prostrated himself behind the bushes and feigned
death in the hope that they would pass him by unnoticed.  The
Lieutenant, now that they were so close to the Shawnees, where
so much caution and skill were required, felt provoked to see
the negro, and had little patience with his fooleries.</p>

<p>"Get up, Cato," said he, rolling him over with his foot.  "You
are not hurt, and we don't want to see any of your nonsense."</p>

<p>One of the negro's eyes partially opened, and then he commenced
yawning, stretching and shoving his feet over the leaves, as though
he was just awaking.</p>

<p>"Hebens, golly! but dis nigger is sleepy," said he.  "Hello!
dat you, Oonomoo?  And bress my soul, if dar ain't Massa Canfield,"
he added, rising to his feet.</p>

<p>"How came you here?" asked Canfield.</p>

<p>"Come here my pussonal self&mdash;walked and runn'd most ob de way."</p>

<p>"But, we sent you to the settlement.  Why did you not go?"</p>

<p>"Bress your soul, Massa Canfield, I'll bet dar's ten fousand
million Injines in de wood, atween us and de settlement.  I tried
to butt my way trough dem, but dar was a few too many, and I had
to gub it up."</p>

<p>"How came you to wander so far out of your way as to get here?"</p>

<p>"Dunno; t'ought I'd take a near cut home, and s'pose I got here
widout knowing anyt'ing about it.".</p>

<p>"Well, Oonomoo, what's to be done with him?"</p>

<p>"Take him 'long&mdash;kill him if don't do what want to."</p>

<p>"You understand, Cato?  We don't want you with us, but, there
seems no help for it now; so we shall have to take you.  You must
follow in our steps, and in no case make any outcry."</p>

<p>The negro promised obedience, and, taking his position behind,
they continued their journey, the Huron leading the way.  He proceeded
some distance until he reached a dense portion of the wood, when
he halted and turned around.</p>

<p>"Plenty time&mdash;sleep some."</p>

<p>These were pleasant words to the Lieutenant, who, in spite of
his impatience, felt the need of sleep and rest before proceeding
further. All stretched themselves upon the ground, where, in a
few minutes, they were wrapped in slumber.  The negro, Cato, lay
some distance from the other two, and was the first to awake. 
Carefully raising his head and discovering that the dreaded Huron
was still unconscious, he silently arose to his feet, and, retreating
some distance with great care and caution, he suddenly turned
and ran at the top of his speed.  His motive for so doing will
soon appear.</p>

<p>While our two friends are thus preparing themselves for the perilous
duty before them, we will return to our old acquaintance, Hans
Vanderbum, and his fair charge, in whom the reader, doubtless,
feels a lively interest.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Miss Prescott was consigned to the
care of the amiable Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock, wife of Hans
Vanderbum.  The reasons for this were several.  In the first place,
the Shawnees were actuated in a small degree by their desire to
lessen the sufferings of their captive.  This squaw had learned
enough of the English language from her husband to hold almost
an intelligible conversation in it; and; as quite an acquaintance
had already been established between him and the maiden, she would
certainly feel more at home in their company than among the others,
who could not speak a word of her tongue.  What might be done
with Miss Prescott in case she remained among the Shawnees for
several years, of course it would be impossible to say; but it
was certain they meditated no violence for the present, only wishing
to hold her simply as a prisoner.  Was there danger of her escape
they would not have hesitated to kill her, it being considered
one of the greatest reproaches that can be cast in a Shawnee face
to accuse him of having lost a prisoner.</p>

<p>Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock was too thoroughly loyal for her
to be suspected of any disposition to aid the prisoner in escape;
and whatever might be the wishes of Hans Vanderbum, he was too
stupid and lazy to be taken into account.</p>

<p>Miss Prescott, accordingly, was installed in their lodge, where
the first day was passed without anything of note occurring, save
the discovery, on her part, of the total hopelessness of escape,
without the assistance of friends.  There was but one entrance
to the lodge, of barely sufficient width to afford the passage
of Hans Vanderbum's body, and the sides of the wigwam were too
strong and firm for her to think either of piercing or breaking
them.  Added to this, Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock at night laid
herself directly before this entrance, compelling Hans Vanderbum
to lie down beside her, so that their united width was some four
or five feet&mdash;rather too long a step to be taken by the girl without
danger of awaking her jailers. When we add that Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock's
slumbers were so light that the least noise awakened her, and
that Miss Prescott never lay down to sleep without having her
ankles bound together, no more need be said to convince the reader
that the ingenuity of her captors could not have made her situation
more secure.  Nevertheless, Hans Vanderbum managed to convey enough
to her to keep hope alive in her breast, and to convince her that
it would not be long before some enterprise for her freedom would
be attempted by her friends.</p>

<p>On the second morning of her captivity, Hans Vanderbum awoke
at an unusually early hour, and the first thought that entered
his mind was that he had an appointment with Oonomoo, the Huron;
for it is a fact, to which all will bear witness, that, by fixing
our thoughts upon any particular time in the night, with a determined
intensity, we are sure to awaken at that moment.  Thus it was
that he arose before his spouse; but his step awakened her.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Hans?  Are you sick?" she asked, with considerable
solicitude.</p>

<p>"No, my dear, good Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock, I feels so
goot as, ever, but I t'inks te mornin' air does me goot, so I
goes out to got a little."</p>

<p>No objection being interposed, he sauntered carelessly forth,
taking a direction that would lead him to the spot where he had
held the interview with the Huron upon the previous day.  He walked
slowly, for it lacked considerable of the hour which had been
fixed upon for the meeting, and, knowing the mathematical exactitude
with which his friend kept his appointments, he had no desire
to reach the spot in advance.</p>

<p>"I doeshn't wish to hurry, so I t'inks I will rest myself here,
and den when&#11834;"</p>

<p>Hans was prevented any further utterance, by some heavy body
striking his shoulders with such force that he was thrown forward
upon his face, and his hat smashed over his eyes.</p>

<p>"Mine Gott! vot made tat tree fall on me?" he exclaimed, endeavoring
to crawl from beneath what he supposed to be the trunk of an immense
oak which he had noticed towering above him.  This belief was
further strengthened by a glimpse which he caught of a heavy branch
upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Hebens, golly! dat you, ole swill-barrel?" greeted his ears;
and he picked his hat and himself up at the same time, to see
the negro, Cato, lying on the ground, with his heels high up in
the air.</p>

<p>"Dunder and blixen! who are you?" inquired Hans, more astonished
than ever.  "Did you drop down out te clouds?"</p>

<p>"Yah! yah! yah! what makes you fink so, old hogsit, eh?  No,
sir-ee! I's Mr. Cato, a nigger gentleman of Mr. Capting Prescott."</p>

<p>The large eyes of the Dutchman grew larger as he proceeded. 
"Vot makes you falls on mine head, eh?"</p>

<p>"I's up in de tree a-takin' ob obserwashuns, when jis' as you
got down hyar, de limb broke, and down I comes.  Much obleege
fur yer bein' so kind fur to stand under and breaks my fall."</p>

<p>"And breaks mine own neck, too, eh?"</p>

<p>"Who might be you wid your big bread-basket?" inquired Cato,
still lying upon his back and kicking up his heels.</p>

<p>"Me?  I's Hans Vanderbum, dat pelongs to Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock."</p>

<p>Cato grew sober in an instant.  He had heard Lieutenant Canfield
mention this man's name in conversation with the Huron, and suspected
at once that he was to perform a part in the day's work.</p>

<p>"You're Hans Vanderbum, eh?  I've heerd Massa Canfield and Mister
Oonymoo speak of you."</p>

<p>"Yaw, I'm him.  Where am dey?"</p>

<p>"Ain't fur off.  I lef 'em sleepin'; and come out for to see
whedder dar war any Injines crawlin' round in de woods, and I
didn't see none but you, and you ain't an Injine."</p>

<p>The appointed hour for the meeting between Hans Vanderbum and
Oonomoo having arrived, the Dutchman added:</p>

<p>"He ish to meet me 'bout dis time or leetles sooner, and, so
we both goes togedder mit each oder, so dat we won't bees alone."</p>

<p>"All right; go ahead, Mr. Hansderbumvan; I'm behind you," said
Cato, taking his favorite position in the rear.</p>

<p>Several hundred yards further and Hans recognized the wished-for
spot. He had hardly reached it, when a light step was heard, and
the next moment Lieutenant Canfield and the Huron stood in his
presence.</p>

<p>"Brudder comes in good time," said the latter, extending his
hand.</p>

<p>"Yaw; Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock showed me de way to do dat,"
replied Hans, shaking hands with the young Lieutenant also.  The
latter expressed some surprise at seeing Cato present, saying
that he had congratulated himself upon being well rid of him. 
The negro explained his departure upon the grounds of his extreme
solicitude for the safety of his friends.  The conversation between
Hans and the Huron was now carried on in the Shawnee tongue.</p>

<p>"How does matters progress with my brother?"</p>

<p>"Very good; the gal is in my wigwam."</p>

<p>"What does she there?"</p>

<p>"Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock has charge of her."</p>

<p>"That is good."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that, Oonomoo; I think it couldn't be much
worse; for Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock has got a bad temper,
if she is the same shape all the way down."</p>

<p>"It is good, my brother.  We will have the captive when the sun
comes up again in the sky."</p>

<p>"How are you going to get her?"</p>

<p>"Give Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock this drug," said the Huron,
handing him a dark, waxy substance.</p>

<p>"Dunder! ish it pizen?" asked Hans, in English. "Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock
will kill me deat if I pizen her."</p>

<p>"It will not kill her; it will only put her in a sleep from which
she will awake after a few hours."</p>

<p>"Quanonshet and Madokawandock will have to take it too, for they
don't sleep any more than she does."</p>

<p>"There is enough for all.  To-day mix this with that which the
squaw and Quanonshet and Madokawandock shall eat, and when it
grows dark they will sleep and not awaken till the morrow's sun."</p>

<p>"And what of the gal?"</p>

<p>"When the moon rises above that tree-top yonder, cut the bonds
that bind her, and lead her through the woods to this place. 
Here Oonomoo will take her and conduct her to her friends in the
settlement."</p>

<p>From this point the Indian dialect was dropped for intelligible
English.</p>

<p>"And vot will become of me?" asked Hans Vanderbum, in considerable
alarm.  "When Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock wakes up and finds
te gal gone, she will t'inks I done it, and den&mdash;den&mdash;den&mdash;" 
The awful expression of his countenance spoke more eloquently
than any words, of the consequences of such a discovery and suspicion
upon the part of his spouse.</p>

<p>"Take some self when git back&mdash;go to sleep&mdash;squaw wake up first."</p>

<p>Hans' eyes sparkled as he took in the beauty of the scheme prepared
by the Huron.  The arrangement was now explained to Lieutenant
Canfield, who could but admire the sagacity and foresight of his
Indian friend, that seemed to understand and provide against every
emergency.  It was further explained to Hans that he was to manage
to give the drug to his wife and children several hours before
sunset, as its effects would not be perceptible for fully four
hours, and that he was to take a small quantity himself about
dusk, to avert the consequences of his philanthrophy.  Lieutenant
Canfield admonished him to be cautious in his movements, and to
take especial pains with his charge after leaving his lodge, in
order to avoid discovery from the sleepless Shawnees. The situation
of Hans' wigwam was fortunate indeed, as he ran little risk of
discovery if he used ordinary discretion after leaving it.</p>

<p>Everything being arranged, Hans Vanderbum took his departure,
and Oonomoo, the soldier and negro commenced the long, weary hours
of waiting.</p>
