<p><em>WHEN </em>Théophraste was brought up to M. Mifroid, he was
in a pitiful condition. He had given himself up to the worst debauchery,
and was still under the influence of his excesses.</p>

<p>However, M. Mifroid explained to him what was required of him.
He had to demonstrate to the Talfa people the duties of a police
commissioner, and Théophraste was to act the robber and be arrested.
However, owing to Théophraste’s condition, M. Mifroid had his
misgivings as to the result of this practical demonstration.</p>

<p>The crowd by this time had assumed enormous proportions, and
by special permission an electric lamp was lit. All present held
their noses as if the lamp smelled.</p>

<p>Then M. Mifroid instructed Théophraste. He told him to run into
a store and take some things, and run out. This was an easy matter,
as none of the stores had doors, and Théophraste commenced to
act the robber. He ran into a hatter’s and seized all sorts of
rat-skin caps. He instinctively put them under his coat, and hid
them about his person, looking furtively around him in a most
natural way.</p>

<p>All this time the people around the store looked on noiselessly.
No one said anything and not the least sign of surprise was shown.
One man at length said: "Look at that fellow providing himself
with hats for a year. It was then that M. Mifroid came upon the
scene, and seizing Théophraste by the arm, said in his most official
tone: "In the name of the law, I arrest you!"</p>

<p>This did not produce the desired effect, as the people still
preserved their dumbness, and did not appear at all impressed.</p>

<p>Mlle. de Coucy asked M. Mifroid what he meant by "In the name
of the law." But as the Talfa people had no law, he found it difficult
to explain.</p>

<p>He told her how the police was an institution to protect the
person and property of peaceable citizens. They were the guardians
of the law. He, however, could not make them understand, as they
thought Théophraste had a right to the hats.</p>

<p>Lady de Montfort explained that they had no need of laws to protect
the state, as they had no state, nor the property, as they had
no property, and as individuals never conflicted no law was necessary
to protect persons. All the Talfa people did was to hunt for their
food and make clothing from the skins of rats. Marriage to them
was a prehistoric institution which appeared unworthy of the human
state. They only half believed its existence as a sacred legend.
Their unions were of a very liberal nature, and did not require
any ceremony or oath. Consequently they lived together peacefully
and happily.</p>

<p>A curious feature of these Talfa people was the entire absence
of any code of morals. There was no difference made between a
virtuous woman and one of loose habits. Everybody lived on the
same footing and enjoyed the same privileges. Things happened
according to taste and temperament, and nobody thought anything
about it. Thus conflicts of passion were reduced to a minimum.
No one had rights, as no one possessed anything.</p>

<p>Thus lived the Talfa people. No laws, no trouble, and no police
commissioners.</p>
