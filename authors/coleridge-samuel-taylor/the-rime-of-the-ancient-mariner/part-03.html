		<p>There passed a weary time. Each throat<br />
			Was parched, and glazed each eye.<br />
			A weary time! a weary time!<br />
			How glazed each weary eye,<br />
			When looking westward, I beheld<br />
			A something in the sky.
		</p>
		<p>At first it seemed a little speck,<br />
			And then it seemed a mist:<br />
			It moved and moved, and took at last<br />
			A certain shape, I wist.
		</p>
		<p>A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!<br />
			And still it neared and neared:<br />
			As if it dodged a water-sprite,<br />
			It plunged and tacked and veered.
		</p>
		<p>With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,<br />
			We could not laugh nor wail;<br />
			Through utter drought all dumb we stood!<br />
			I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,<br />
			And cried, A sail! a sail!
		</p>
		<p>With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,<br />
			Agape they heard me call:<br />
			Gramercy! they for joy did grin,<br />
			And all at once their breath drew in,<br />
			As they were drinking all.
		</p>
		<p>See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!<br />
			Hither to work us weal;<br />
			Without a breeze, without a tide,<br />
			She steadies with upright keel!
		</p>
		<p>The western wave was all a-flame<br />
			The day was well nigh done!<br />
			Almost upon the western wave<br />
			Rested the broad bright Sun;<br />
			When that strange shape drove suddenly<br />
			Betwixt us and the Sun.
		</p>
		<p>And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,<br />
			(Heaven's Mother send us grace!)<br />
			As if through a dungeon-grate he peered,<br />
			With broad and burning face.
		</p>
		<p>Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)<br />
			How fast she nears and nears!<br />
			Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,<br />
			Like restless gossameres!
		</p>
		<p>Are those her ribs through which the Sun<br />
			Did peer, as through a grate?<br />
			And is that Woman all her crew?<br />
			Is that a DEATH? and are there two?<br />
			Is DEATH that woman's mate?
		</p>
		<p>Her lips were red, her looks were free,<br />
			Her locks were yellow as gold:<br />
			Her skin was as white as leprosy,<br />
			The Night-Mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she,<br />
			Who thicks man's blood with cold.
		</p>
		<p>The naked hulk alongside came,<br />
			And the twain were casting dice;<br />
			"The game is done! I've won! I've won!"<br />
			Quoth she, and whistles thrice.
		</p>
		<p>The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:<br />
			At one stride comes the dark;<br />
			With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea.<br />
			Off shot the spectre-bark.
		</p>
		<p>We listened and looked sideways up!<br />
			Fear at my heart, as at a cup,<br />
			My life-blood seemed to sip!
		</p>
		<p>The stars were dim, and thick the night,<br />
			The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;<br />
			From the sails the dew did drip--<br />
			Till clombe above the eastern bar<br />
			The horned Moon, with one bright star<br />
			Within the nether tip.
		</p>
		<p>One after one, by the star-dogged Moon<br />
			Too quick for groan or sigh,<br />
			Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,<br />
			And cursed me with his eye.
		</p>
		<p>Four times fifty living men,<br />
			(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)<br />
			With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,<br />
			They dropped down one by one.
		</p>
		<p>The souls did from their bodies fly,--<br />
			They fled to bliss or woe!<br />
			And every soul, it passed me by,<br />
			Like the whizz of my CROSS-BOW!
