<P>
When Norman of Torn regained his senses, he found himself in a small tower
room in a strange castle.  His head ached horribly, and he felt sick and
sore; but he managed to crawl from the cot on which he lay, and by
steadying his swaying body with hands pressed against the wall, he was able
to reach the door.  To his disappointment, he found this locked from
without and, in his weakened condition, he made no attempt to force it.
<P>
He was fully dressed and in armor, as he had been when struck down, but his
helmet was gone, as were also his sword and dagger.
<P>
The day was drawing to a close and, as dusk fell and the room darkened, he
became more and more impatient.  Repeated pounding upon the door brought no
response and finally he gave up in despair.  Going to the window, he saw
that his room was some thirty feet above the stone-flagged courtyard, and
also that it looked at an angle upon other windows in the old castle where
lights were beginning to show.  He saw men-at-arms moving about, and once
he thought he caught a glimpse of a woman's figure, but he was not sure.
<P>
He wondered what had become of Joan de Tany and Mary de Stutevill.  He
hoped that they had escaped, and yet -- no, Joan certainly had not, for now
he distinctly remembered that his eyes had met hers for an instant just
before the blow fell upon him, and he thought of the faith and confidence
that he had read in that quick glance.  Such a look would nerve a jackal to
attack a drove of lions, thought the outlaw.  What a beautiful creature she
was; and she had stayed there with him during the fight.  He remembered
now.  Mary de Stutevill had not been with her as he had caught that glimpse
of her, no, she had been all alone.  Ah !  That was friendship indeed !
<P>
What else was it that tried to force its way above the threshold of his
bruised and wavering memory ?  Words ?  Words of love ?  And lips pressed
to his ?  No, it must be but a figment of his wounded brain.
<P>
What was that which clicked against his breastplate ?  He felt, and found a
metal bauble linked to a mesh of his steel armor by a strand of silken
hair.  He carried the little thing to the window, and in the waning light
made it out to be a golden hair ornament set with precious stones, but he
could not tell if the little strand of silken hair were black or brown.
Carefully he detached the little thing, and, winding the filmy tress about
it, placed it within the breast of his tunic.  He was vaguely troubled by
it, yet why he could scarcely have told, himself.
<P>
Again turning to the window, he watched the lighted rooms within his
vision, and presently his view was rewarded by the sight of a knight coming
within the scope of the narrow casement of a nearby chamber.
<P>
From his apparel, he was a man of position, and he was evidently in heated
discussion with some one whom Norman of Torn could not see.  The man, a
great, tall black-haired and mustached nobleman, was pounding upon a table
to emphasize his words, and presently he sprang up as though rushing toward
the one to whom he had been speaking.  He disappeared from the watcher's
view for a moment and then, at the far side of the apartment, Norman of
Torn saw him again just as he roughly grasped the figure of a woman who
evidently was attempting to escape him.  As she turned to face her
tormentor, all the devil in the Devil of Torn surged in his aching head,
for the face he saw was that of Joan de Tany.
<P>
With a muttered oath, the imprisoned man turned to hurl himself against the
bolted door, but ere he had taken a single step, the sound of heavy feet
without brought him to a stop, and the jingle of keys as one was fitted to
the lock of the door sent him gliding stealthily to the wall beside the
doorway, where the inswinging door would conceal him.
<P>
As the door was pushed back, a flickering torch lighted up, but dimly, the
interior, so that until he had reached the center of the room, the visitor
did not see that the cot was empty.
<P>
He was a man-at-arms, and at his side hung a sword.  That was enough for
the Devil of Torn -- it was a sword he craved most; and, ere the fellow
could assure his slow wits that the cot was empty, steel fingers closed
upon his throat, and he went down beneath the giant form of the outlaw.
<P>
Without other sound than the scuffing of their bodies on the floor, and the
clanking of their armor, they fought, the one to reach the dagger at his
side, the other to close forever the windpipe of his adversary.
<P>
Presently, the man-at-arms found what he sought, and, after tugging with
ever diminishing strength, he felt the blade slip from its sheath.  Slowly
and feebly he raised it high above the back of the man on top of him; with
a last supreme effort he drove the point downward, but ere it reached its
goal, there was a sharp snapping sound as of a broken bone, the dagger fell
harmlessly from his dead hand, and his head rolled backward upon his broken
neck.
<P>
Snatching the sword from the body of his dead antagonist, Norman of Torn
rushed from the tower room.
<P>
As John de Fulm, Earl of Buckingham, laid his vandal hands upon Joan de
Tany, she turned upon him like a tigress.  Blow after blow she rained upon
his head and face until, in mortification and rage, he struck her full upon
the mouth with his clenched fist; but even this did not subdue her and,
with ever weakening strength, she continued to strike him.  And then the
great royalist Earl, the chosen friend of the King, took the fair white
throat between his great fingers, and the lust of blood supplanted the lust
of love, for he would have killed her in his rage.
<P>
It was upon this scene that the Outlaw of Torn burst with naked sword.
They were at the far end of the apartment, and his cry of anger at the
sight caused the Earl to drop his prey, and turn with drawn sword to meet
him.
<P>
There were no words, for there was no need of words here.  The two men were
upon each other, and fighting to the death, before the girl had regained
her feet.  It would have been short shrift for John de Fulm had not some of
his men heard the fracas, and rushed to his aid.
<P>
Four of them there were, and they tumbled pell-mell into the room, fairly
falling upon Norman of Torn in their anxiety to get their swords into him;
but once they met that master hand, they went more slowly, and in a moment,
two of them went no more at all, and the others, with the Earl, were but
circling warily in search of a chance opening -- an opening which never
came.
<P>
Norman of Torn stood with his back against a table in an angle of the room,
and behind him stood Joan de Tany.
<P>
"Move toward the left," she whispered.  "I know this old pile.  When you
reach the table that bears the lamp, there will be a small doorway directly
behind you.  Strike the lamp out with your sword, as you feel my hand in
your left, and then I will lead you through that doorway, which you must
turn and quickly bolt after us.  Do you understand ?"
<P>
He nodded.
<P>
Slowly he worked his way toward the table, the men-at-arms in the meantime
keeping up an infernal howling for help.  The Earl was careful to keep out
of reach of the point of De Conde's sword, and the men-at-arms were nothing
loath to emulate their master's example.
<P>
Just as he reached his goal, a dozen more men burst into the room, and
emboldened by this reinforcement, one of the men engaging De Conde came too
close.  As he jerked his blade from the fellow's throat, Norman of Torn
felt a firm, warm hand slipped into his from behind, and his sword swung
with a resounding blow against the lamp.
<P>
As darkness enveloped the chamber, Joan de Tany led him through the little
door, which he immediately closed and bolted as she had instructed.
<P>
"This way," she whispered, again slipping her hand into his and, in
silence, she led him through several dim chambers, and finally stopped
before a blank wall in a great oak-panelled room.
<P>
Here the girl felt with swift fingers the edge of the molding.  More and
more rapidly she moved as the sound of hurrying footsteps resounded through
the castle.
<P>
"What is wrong ?" asked Norman of Torn, noticing her increasing
perturbation.
<P>
"Mon Dieu !" she cried.  "Can I be wrong !  Surely this is the room.  Oh,
my friend, that I should have brought you to all this by my willfulness and
vanity; and now when I might save you, my wits leave me and I forget the
way."
<P>
"Do not worry about me," laughed the Devil of Torn.  "Methought that it was
I who was trying to save you, and may heaven forgive me else, for surely,
that be my only excuse for running away from a handful of swords.  I could
not take chances when thou wert at stake, Joan," he added more gravely.
<P>
 The sound of pursuit was now quite close, in fact the reflection from
flickering torches could be seen in nearby chambers.
<P>
At last the girl, with a little cry of "stupid," seized De Conde and rushed
him to the far side of the room.
<P>
"Here it is," she whispered joyously, "here it has been all the time."
Running her fingers along the molding until she found a little hidden
spring, she pushed it, and one of the great panels swung slowly in,
revealing the yawning mouth of a black opening behind.
<P>
Quickly the girl entered, pulling De Conde after her, and as the panel
swung quietly into place, the Earl of Buckingham with a dozen men entered
the apartment.
<P>
"The devil take them," cried De Fulm.  "Where can they have gone ?  Surely
we were right behind them."
<P>
"It is passing strange, My Lord," replied one of the men.  "Let us try the
floor above, and the towers; for of a surety they have not come this way."
And the party retraced its steps, leaving the apartment empty.
<P>
Behind the panel, the girl stood shrinking close to De Conde, her hand
still in his.
<P>
"Where now ?" he asked.  "Or do we stay hidden here like frightened chicks
until the war is over and the Baron returns to let us out of this musty
hole ?"
<P>
"Wait," she answered, "until I quiet my nerves a little.  I am all
unstrung." He felt her body tremble as it pressed against his.
<P>
With the spirit of protection strong within him, what wonder that his arm
fell about her shoulder as though to say, fear not, for I be brave and
powerful; naught can harm you while I am here.
<P>
Presently she reached her hands up to his face, made brave to do it by the
sheltering darkness.
<P>
"Roger," she whispered, her tongue halting over the familiar name.  "I
thought that they had killed you, and all for me, for my foolish
stubbornness.  Canst forgive me ?"
<P>
"Forgive ?" he asked, smiling to himself.  "Forgive being given an
opportunity to fight ?  There be nothing to forgive, Joan, unless it be
that I should ask forgiveness for protecting thee so poorly."
<P>
"Do not say that," she commanded.  "Never was such bravery or such
swordsmanship in all the world before; never such a man."
<P>
He did not answer.  His mind was a chaos of conflicting thoughts.  The feel
of her hands as they had lingered momentarily, and with a vague caress upon
his cheek, and the pressure of her body as she leaned against him sent the
hot blood coursing through his veins.  He was puzzled, for he had not
dreamed that friendship was so sweet.  That she did not shrink from his
encircling arms should have told him much, but Norman of Torn was slow to
realize that a woman might look upon him with love.  Nor had he a thought
of any other sentiment toward her than that of friend and protector.
<P>
And then there came to him as in a vision another fair and beautiful
face -- Bertrade de Montfort's -- and Norman of Torn was still more
puzzled; for at heart he was clean, and love of loyalty was strong within
him.  Love of women was a new thing to him, and, robbed as he had been all
his starved life of the affection and kindly fellowship, of either men or
women, it is little to be wondered at that he was easily impressionable and
responsive to the feeling his strong personality had awakened in two of
England's fairest daughters.
<P>
But with the vision of that other face, there came to him a faint
realization that mayhap it was a stronger power than either friendship or
fear which caused that lithe, warm body to cling so tightly to him.  That
the responsibility for the critical stage their young acquaintance had so
quickly reached was not his had never for a moment entered his head.  To
him, the fault was all his; and perhaps it was this quality of chivalry
that was the finest of the many noble characteristics of his sterling
character.  So his next words were typical of the man; and did Joan de Tany
love him, or did she not, she learned that night to respect and trust him
as she respected and trusted few men of her acquaintance.
<P>
"My Lady," said Norman of Torn, "we have been through much, and we are as
little children in a dark attic, and so if I have presumed upon our
acquaintance," and he lowered his arm from about her shoulder, "I ask you
to forgive it for I scarce know what to do, from weakness and from the pain
of the blow upon my head."
<P>
Joan de Tany drew slowly away from him, and without reply, took his hand
and led him forward through a dark, cold corridor.
<P>
"We must go carefully now," she said at last, "for there be stairs near."
<P>
He held her hand pressed very tightly in his, tighter perhaps than
conditions required, but she let it lie there as she led him forward, very
slowly down a flight of rough stone steps.
<P>
Norman of Torn wondered if she were angry with him and then, being new at
love, he blundered.
<P>
"Joan de Tany," he said.
<P>
"Yes, Roger de Conde; what would you ?"
<P>
"You be silent, and I fear that you be angry with me.  Tell me that you
forgive what I have done, an it offended you.  I have so few friends," he
added sadly, "that I cannot afford to lose such as you."
<P>
"You will never lose the friendship of Joan de Tany," she answered.  "You
have won her respect and -- and -- " But she could not say it and so she
trailed off lamely -- "and undying gratitude."
<P>
But Norman of Torn knew the word that she would have spoken had he dared to
let her.  He did not, for there was always the vision of Bertrade de
Montfort before him; and now another vision arose that would effectually
have sealed his lips had not the other -- he saw the Outlaw of Torn
dangling by his neck from a wooden gibbet.
<P>
Before, he had only feared that Joan de Tany loved him, now he knew it, and
while he marvelled that so wondrous a creature could feel love for him,
again he blamed himself, and felt sorrow for them both; for he did not
return her love nor could he imagine a love strong enough to survive the
knowledge that it was possessed by the Devil of Torn.
<P>
Presently they reached the bottom of the stairway, and Joan de Tany led
him, gropingly, across what seemed, from their echoing footsteps, a large
chamber.  The air was chill and dank, smelling of mold, and no ray of light
penetrated this subterranean vault, and no sound broke the stillness.
<P>
"This be the castle's crypt," whispered Joan; "and they do say that strange
happenings occur here in the still watches of the night, and that when the
castle sleeps, the castle's dead rise from their coffins and shake their
dry bones.
<P>
"Sh !  What was that ?" as a rustling noise broke upon their ears close
upon their right; and then there came a distinct moan, and Joan de Tany
fled to the refuge of Norman of Torn's arms.
<P>
"There is nothing to fear, Joan," reassured Norman of Torn.  "Dead men
wield not swords, nor do they move, or moan.  The wind, I think, and rats
are our only companions here."
<P>
"I am afraid," she whispered.  "If you can make a light, I am sure you will
find an old lamp here in the crypt, and then will it be less fearsome.  As
a child I visited this castle often, and in search of adventure, we passed
through these corridors an hundred times, but always by day and with
lights."
<P>
Norman of Torn did as she bid, and finding the lamp, lighted it.  The
chamber was quite empty save for the coffins in their niches, and some
effigies in marble set at intervals about the walls.
<P>
"Not such a fearsome place after all," he said, laughing lightly.
<P>
"No place would seem fearsome now," she answered simply, "were there a
light to show me that the brave face of Roger de Conde were by my side."
<P>
"Hush, child," replied the outlaw.  "You know not what you say.  When you
know me better, you will be sorry for your words, for Roger de Conde is not
what you think him.  So say no more of praise until we be out of this hole,
and you safe in your father's halls."
<P>
The fright of the noises in the dark chamber had but served to again bring
the girl's face close to his so that he felt her hot, sweet breath upon his
cheek, and thus another link was forged to bind him to her.
<P>
With the aid of the lamp, they made more rapid progress, and in a few
moments, reached a low door at the end of the arched passageway.
<P>
"This is the doorway which opens upon the ravine below the castle.  We have
passed beneath the walls and the moat.  What may we do now, Roger, without
horses ?"
<P>
"Let us get out of this place, and as far away as possible under the cover
of darkness, and I doubt not I may find a way to bring you to your father's
castle," replied Norman of Torn.
<P>
Putting out the light, lest it should attract the notice of the watch upon
the castle walls, Norman of Torn pushed open the little door and stepped
forth into the fresh night air.
<P>
The ravine was so overgrown with tangled vines and wildwood that, had there
ever been a pathway, it was now completely obliterated; and it was with
difficulty that the man forced his way through the entangling creepers and
tendrils.  The girl stumbled after him and twice fell before they had taken
a score of steps.
<P>
"I fear I am not strong enough," she said finally.  "The way is much more
difficult than I had thought."
<P>
So Norman of Torn lifted her in his strong arms, and stumbled on through
the darkness and the shrubbery down the center of the ravine.  It required
the better part of an hour to traverse the little distance to the roadway;
and all the time her head nestled upon his shoulder and her hair brushed
his cheek.  Once when she lifted her head to speak to him, he bent toward
her, and in the darkness, by chance, his lips brushed hers.  He felt her
little form tremble in his arms, and a faint sigh breathed from her lips.
<P>
They were upon the highroad now, but he did not put her down.  A mist was
before his eyes, and he could have crushed her to him and smothered those
warm lips with his own.  Slowly, his face inclined toward hers, closer and
closer his iron muscles pressed her to him, and then, clear cut and
distinct before his eyes, he saw the corpse of the Outlaw of Torn swinging
by the neck from the arm of a wooden gibbet, and beside it knelt a woman
gowned in rich cloth of gold and many jewels.  Her face was averted and her
arms were outstretched toward the dangling form that swung and twisted from
the grim, gaunt arm.  Her figure was racked with choking sobs of
horror-stricken grief.  Presently she staggered to her feet and turned
away, burying her face in her hands; but he saw her features for an instant
then -- the woman who openly and alone mourned the dead Outlaw of Torn was
Bertrade de Montfort.
<P>
Slowly his arms relaxed, and gently and reverently he lowered Joan de Tany
to the ground.  In that instant Norman of Torn had learned the difference
between friendship and love, and love and passion.
<P>
The moon was shining brightly upon them, and the girl turned, wide-eyed and
wondering, toward him.  She had felt the wild call of love and she could
not understand his seeming coldness now, for she had seen no vision beyond
a life of happiness within those strong arms.
<P>
"Joan," he said, "I would but now have wronged thee.  Forgive me.  Forget
what has passed between us until I can come to you in my rightful colors,
when the spell of the moonlight and adventure be no longer upon us, and
then," -- he paused -- "and then I shall tell you who I be and you shall
say if you still care to call me friend -- no more than that shall I ask."
<P>
He had not the heart to tell her that he loved only Bertrade de Montfort,
but it had been a thousand times better had he done so.
<P>
She was about to reply when a dozen armed men sprang from the surrounding
shadows, calling upon them to surrender.  The moonlight falling upon the
leader revealed a great giant of a fellow with an enormous, bristling
mustache -- it was Shandy.
<P>
Norman of Torn lowered his raised sword.
<P>
"It is I, Shandy," he said.  "Keep a still tongue in thy head until I speak
with thee apart.  Wait here, My Lady Joan; these be friends."
<P>
Drawing Shandy to one side, he learned that the faithful fellow had become
alarmed at his chief's continued absence, and had set out with a small
party to search for him.  They had come upon the riderless Sir Mortimer
grazing by the roadside, and a short distance beyond, had discovered
evidences of the conflict at the cross-roads.  There they had found Norman
of Torn's helmet, confirming their worst fears.  A peasant in a nearby hut
had told them of the encounter, and had set them upon the road taken by the
Earl and his prisoners.
<P>
"And here we be, My Lord," concluded the great fellow.
<P>
"How many are you ?" asked the outlaw.
<P>
"Fifty, all told, with those who lie farther back in the bushes."
<P>
"Give us horses, and let two of the men ride behind us," said the chief.
"And, Shandy, let not the lady know that she rides this night with the
Outlaw of Torn."
<P>
"Yes, My Lord."
<P>
They were soon mounted, and clattering down the road, back toward the
castle of Richard de Tany.
<P>
Joan de Tany looked in silent wonder upon this grim force that sprang out
of the shadows of the night to do the bidding of Roger de Conde, a
gentleman of France.
<P>
There was something familiar in the great bulk of Red Shandy; where had she
seen that mighty frame before ?  And now she looked closely at the figure
of Roger de Conde.  Yes, somewhere else had she seen these two men
together; but where and when ?
<P>
And then the strangeness of another incident came to her mind.  Roger de
Conde spoke no English, and yet she had plainly heard English words upon
this man's lips as he addressed the red giant.
<P>
Norman of Torn had recovered his helmet from one of his men who had picked
it up at the crossroads, and now he rode in silence with lowered visor, as
was his custom.
<P>
There was something sinister now in his appearance, and as the moonlight
touched the hard, cruel faces of the grim and silent men who rode behind
him, a little shudder crept over the frame of Joan de Tany.
<P>
Shortly before daylight they reached the castle of Richard de Tany, and a
great shout went up from the watch as Norman of Torn cried:
<P>
"Open !  Open for My Lady Joan."
<P>
Together they rode into the courtyard, where all was bustle and
excitement.  A dozen voices asked a dozen questions only to cry out still
others without waiting for replies.
<P>
Richard de Tany with his family and Mary de Stutevill were still fully
clothed, having not lain down during the whole night.  They fairly fell
upon Joan and Roger de Conde in their joyous welcome and relief.
<P>
"Come, come," said the Baron, "let us go within.  You must be fair famished
for good food and drink."
<P>
"I will ride, My Lord," replied Norman of Torn.  "I have a little matter of
business with my friend, the Earl of Buckingham.  Business which I fear
will not wait."
<P>
Joan de Tany looked on in silence.  Nor did she urge him to remain, as he
raised her hand to his lips in farewell.  So Norman of Torn rode out of the
courtyard; and as his men fell in behind him under the first rays of the
drawing day, the daughter of De Tany watched them through the gate, and a
great light broke upon her, for what she saw was the same as she had seen a
few days since when she had turned in her saddle to watch the retreating
forms of the cut-throats of Torn as they rode on after halting her father's
party.
