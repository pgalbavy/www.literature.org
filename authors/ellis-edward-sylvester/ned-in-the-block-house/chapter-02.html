<p>Before proceeding further it is proper to give the information
the reader needs in order to understand the incidents that follow.</p>

<p>Macaiah Preston and his wife were among the original settlers
of Wild Oaks, a small town on the Kentucky side of the Ohio, during
the latter portion of the last century, their only child being
Ned, who has already been introduced to the reader. Beside him
they had the bound boy Wildblossom Brown, a heavy-set, good-natured
and sturdy negro lad, whom they took with them at the time they
removed from Western Pennsylvania. He was faithful and devoted,
and he received the best of treatment from his master and mistress.</p>

<p>Ned was taller and more graceful than the African, and the instruction
from his father had endowed him with more book learning than generally
falls to the lot of boys placed in his circumstances. Besides
this, Mr. Preston was one of the most noted hunters and marksmen
in the settlement, and he gave Ned thorough training in the art
which is always such a delight for a boy to acquire.</p>

<p>When Ned was thirteen years old he fired one day at a squirrel
on the topmost branch of a mountain ash, and brought it down,
with its body shattered by the bullet of his rifle. The father
quietly contemplated the work for a minute or so, and then, without
a word, cut a hickory stick, and proceeded to trim it. While he
was thus employed Ned was looking sideways at him, gouging his
eyes with his knuckles and muttering,</p>

<p>"You might excuse me this time &mdash;I didn't think."</p>

<p>When the hickory was properly trimmed, the father deliberately
took his son by his coat collar with one hand and applied the
stick with the other, during which the lad danced and shouted
like a wild Miami Indian. The trouncing completed, the only remark
made by the father was&mdash;</p>

<p>"After this I reckon when you shoot a squirrel you will hit him
in the <em>head</em>."</p>

<p>"I reckon I will," sniffled Ned, who was certain never to forget
the instructions of his parent on <em>that</em> point.</p>

<p>Such was the training of Ned Preston; and at the age of sixteen,
when we introduce him to the reader, there were none of his years
who was his superior in backwoods "lore" and woodcraft.</p>

<p>In those times a hunter differed in his make-up from those of
to-day. The gun which he carried was a long, single-barreled rifle,
heavy, costly of manufacture, and scarcely less unerring in the
hands of a veteran than is the modern weapon. It was a flint-lock,
and of course a muzzle-loader. The owner carried his powder-horn,
bullet-pouch, and sometimes an extra flint. Lucifer matches were
unknown for nearly a half century later, the flint and tinder
answering for them.</p>

<p>Ned Preston wore a warm cap made of coonskin; thick, homespun
trowsers, coat and vest; strong cowhide shoes, and woollen stockings,
knit by the same deft hands that had made the linen for his shirt.
The coat was rather short, and it was buttoned from top to bottom
with the old style horn button, over the short waistcoat beneath.
The string of the powder-horn passed over one shoulder, and that
of the game-bag over the other. Neither Ned nor Blossom carried
a hunting-bag, for they had not started out for game, and the
majority shot in Kentucky or Ohio in those days were altogether
too bulky for a single hunter to take home on his back.</p>

<p>Some thirty miles in the interior from the settlement stood Fort
Bridgman, a block-house on the eastern bank of the Licking River.
It was erected six years before the time of which we are speaking,
and was intended as a protection to a settlement begun at the
same period; but, just as the fortification was finished, and
before the settlers had all their dwellings in good form, the
Shawanoes and Wyandots swooped down on them, and left nothing
but the block-house and the smoking ruins of the log dwellings.</p>

<p>This effectually checked the settlers for the time; but one or
two courageous pioneers, who liked the locality, began erecting
other cabins close to the massive block-house, which had resisted
the fierce attack of the red men. The man who had charge of the
fortification was Colonel Hugh Preston, a brother of Macaiah,
and of course the uncle of Ned, the hero of this story. He maintained
his foothold, with several others as daring as he, and his wife
and two daughters kept him company.</p>

<p>There was a warm affection between the brothers, and they occasionally
exchanged visits. When this was inconvenient, Ned Preston acted
as messenger. He often carried papers sent down the Ohio to his
father for the uncle, together with the letters forwarded to the
settlement from their friends in the East.</p>

<p>On the day of which we are speaking he had, in the inner pocket
of his coat, a letter for his uncle, one for his aunt, and one
each for two of the garrison; so that his visit to the post was
sure to be a most welcome one.</p>

<p>Between the settlement on the Ohio and the block-house on the
Licking lay the thirty miles of unbroken forest. Ned and Blossom
had made this journey in one day in the month of June, but their
custom was to encamp one night on the way so as to give themselves
abundance of time; and the trip was generally a most enjoyable
one to them.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed they forgot the danger most to be dreaded
was from the Indians who roamed over the Dark and Bloody Ground,
and who held almost undisputed possession of hundreds of square
miles of Kentucky at the opening of the present century.</p>

<p>There were scouts and runners threading their way through the
trackless forests north and south of the Ohio, or coursing up
and down the rivers, or spying out the actions of the war parties
when they gathered near their villages and threw the tomahawk,
daubed their faces with paint, and danced the war dance. These
intrepid runners kept the frontier well informed of any formidable
movements contemplated by the red men, so that no effective demonstration
against the whites was feared.</p>

<p>Weeks and months passed, during which Ned Preston was not permitted
to cross the intervening space between the block-house and the
settlement, for the runners who came in reported great danger
in doing so. Then again it looked almost as if the dawn of peace
had come, and men were not afraid to move to and fro many furlongs
distant from their homes.</p>

<p>Nearly twenty years had passed since the great pioneer, Daniel
Boone, had explored a portion of the wonderful territory, and
the numerous scenes of violence that had taken place on its soil
made the name of the Dark and Bloody Ground characteristic and
well-merited.</p>

<p>The several military expeditions which the Government had sent
into the West had either been overwhelmingly defeated by the combined
forces of Indians, or had accomplished nothing toward subduing
the red men. The decisive campaign was yet to come.</p>

<p>But without dwelling on this portion of our story, we may say
that in the autumn of 1788 comparative peace reigned over the
portion of Kentucky of which we are speaking. When, therefore,
the letters came down the Ohio in a flat-boat for Colonel Hugh
Preston and several of those with him, and Ned asked permission
to take them to his uncle, there was scarcely any hesitation in
giving consent.</p>

<p>With this explanation the reader will understand how it came
about that Ned and Blossom were in the depths of the Kentucky
forest when the autumn day was closing, and while fully a dozen
miles remained to pass before they could reach the block-house.</p>

<p>They had made a later start than usual from home, and rather
singularly, although they had passed over the route so many times,
they went astray, and lost several hours from that cause.</p>

<p>Soon after their departure from the settlement a friendly Shawanoe
visited the place and warned the pioneers that trouble was coming,
and it was wise to take more than usual precautions against surprise.
When this Indian runner added that he was quite sure an assault
was intended on the block-house, it can be understood that the
parents of Ned were extremely alarmed for the safety of himself
and Blossom.</p>

<p>If they should get through the stretch of forest to the block-house,
their danger would not be removed; for an attack on that post
was contemplated, and knowing its precise defensive power, as
the Indians did, they would be likely to render the battle decisive.</p>

<p>"I hope the boys will reach the Colonel," said the father of
Ned to his wife, "for they will have a chance to make a good fight
for themselves."</p>

<p>"But the Colonel may know nothing of the attack intended, and
he and the rest will be taken by surprise."</p>

<p>This doubt so disturbed the husband that he hurriedly sought
the Shawanoe, who was still in the settlement, and asked him whether
Colonel Preston had been apprised of the danger which threatened
him. When informed that he had not, Mr. Preston insisted that
Deerfoot, as the young Shawanoe was called, should make his way
to the block-house without delay. The Indian, known to be one
of the fleetest of warriors, said that he was on the eve of starting
on that errand, and he left at once.</p>

<p>Before going, he was told that the two boys were threading their
way through the forest toward the station, and the anxious father
asked him to bring the lads back, if he deemed it the safer course.
Ned was a great favorite with the Shawanoe youth, and the latter
promised to use every effort to befriend him.</p>

<p>The question left to Deerfoot was whether it was his duty to
hasten forward and apprise Colonel Preston of the peril impending
over the garrison, or whether it would be safe to let him wait
until the lads were conducted back to Wild Oaks. Deerfoot was
disposed to hurry to the Licking; but when a few miles from the
settlement he struck the trail of the lads, which he followed
with as much ease as the bloodhound would have displayed under
similar circumstances.</p>

<p>As both parties had started in the same direction, the prospect
was that a junction would speedily take place, and the three could
make the rest of the journey together; but before long Deerfoot
was surprised to discover that Ned and Blossom had strayed from
the true course. He could not understand why this happened, and
his misgiving for Ned, whom he liked so well, led him to resolve
to follow up the boy, and find out the cause.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was pushing forward on his loping trot, which he was
able to maintain hour after hour without fatigue, when his wonderful
instinct or reason told him he was in the vicinity of a large
war party of Wyandots, the natural allies of his own tribe in
their wars upon the settlements.</p>

<p>His belief was that the boys had been captured by them, in which
event little hope remained; but it required no special maneuvering
on his part to learn that his fears were baseless. The trail of
the lads made an abrupt turn, showing that Ned Preston had suddenly
"located" himself, and had returned to the right course. Although
the footprints of the Wyandots actually approached within a hundred
yards of those of the boys, yet singularly enough they came no
nearer, and diverged from that point; so that, in all probability,
the war party never suspected how close they were to the prize
that would have been so welcome to them.</p>

<p>Accustomed as Deerfoot was to all species of danger in the woods,
his dusky face flushed when he looked to the ground and saw how
narrowly the boys had missed a frightful fate.</p>

<p>Such being the case, it became the duty of the Shawanoe to acquaint
himself with the purpose of the Wyandot party. He therefore went
directly among them to make his inquiries. This was a delicate
and dangerous proceeding, for although the subtle Indian had done
his utmost to keep secret from his own people his friendship and
services for the whites (inasmuch as such a knowledge on the part
of his race would have ended his usefulness and life), he knew
well enough that his double-dealing must become known sooner or
later to the Indians, and for a year or more he had never appeared
among his people without misgiving as to the result.</p>

<p>All the wonderful cunning of his nature was brought into play
when he advanced to meet the Wyandots, who were in their war-paint.
He saw there were twenty-three, and that they numbered the bravest
and most daring of their tribe. The leader was the chief Waughtauk,
a fierce foe of the whites, whose tomahawk and scalping-knife
had been reddened with innocent blood many a time.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was received with every appearance of cordiality by
the chief and his men, for all knew what a splendid warrior the
young Shawanoe was, and some of them had witnessed the extraordinary
speed which had saved his life more than once.</p>

<p>It is as easy for the American to play a part as for the Caucasian,
and Deerfoot was not entirely satisfied. He kept his wits about
him, and used extreme care in not placing himself at any disadvantage
which it was possible to avoid; but all the friendship seemed
genuine, and when Waughtauk told him it was his intention to attack
the exposed cabins of the settlers, Deerfoot believed him. When
he added that he meant also to take a survey of the settlements
along the Ohio, with the object of seeing which offered the most
favorable opening for a sudden assault by a large war party, the
Shawanoe was quite certain he spoke the truth.</p>

<p>Deerfoot then asked why they did not assail the block-house on
the Licking, whose exposed situation seemed to invite such attack.
Waughtauk answered that Colonel Preston had proved a good friend
to the Indians who visited him, and it was decided to spare him.</p>

<p>This answer excited the suspicion of the youthful Shawanoe that
the Wyandot chieftain had been deceiving him from the first; but
Deerfoot was too cunning to reveal anything of his thoughts. When
he bade his friends good-by, they at least were misled into the
belief that he held no suspicion of the "double tongue" with which
they had spoken.</p>

<p>It was no difficult matter for Deerfoot, when fairly away from
the Wyandots, to shadow them until he learned whether they had
falsified or not.</p>

<p>They kept to the northward several miles, until they had every
reason to believe a long distance separated them from the Shawanoe,
when they changed to the left, turning again a short distance
further on, until their faces were directly toward Fort Bridgman,
the block-house on the Licking.</p>

<p>That settled the question beyond dispute; they had told untruths
to Deerfoot, and their purpose was to descend upon the station
defended by Colonel Preston and only three able-bodied men.</p>

<p>After this discovery, the Shawanoe stood a moment leaning thoughtfully
on his bow; an important truth impressed him:</p>

<p>"They suspect that Deerfoot is a friend of the white man, and
therefore an enemy of his own race," was the thought of the Indian,
who realized the fearful meaning to him of such a suspicion.</p>
