<p>Master George slipped away from me somehow, after the pig-race,
so I strolled up into the Castle again. The sports were all over,
so the theatres and shows were making a greater noise than ever,
but I didn’t feel inclined to go to any of them, and kept walking
slowly round the bank on the opposite side, and looking down at
the fair. In a minute or two I heard cheering, and saw an open
carriage, with postilions, driving out of the Castle, and three
or four young ladies and a gentleman or two cantering along with
it. I watched them for some way across the downs, and thought
how nice it must be to be able to ride well, and to have nice
horses to go galloping over the springy downs, into the golden
sunset, putting up the larks and beautiful little wheatears; and,
besides all that, to have all the people cheering one too! So
down I went into the crowd, to find out who they were. It was
Lord Craven and his party, the first man I came across told me;
and then I quite understood why this carriage should be the only
one to come inside the Castle, and why the people should cheer;
because, you see, the White Horse, and Dragon’s Hill, and the
Manger, all belong to him, and he is very good-natured in letting
everybody go there and do pretty much what they please. There
were other carriages going off now from the row outside, and coachmen
bringing up their horses to harness, and a few of the foot people
who came from the longest distances, starting along the Ridgeway,
or down the Uffington Road. I was standing watching all this,
and thinking how I was to find my party, and whether I should
go behind in the four-wheel (which I began to feel very much inclined
to do, for I was getting tired, and it would be dark), when I
saw Joe bustling about amongst the crowd, and looking out for
some one; so I made across to him.</p>

<p>"Ah, there you are," said he, as soon as he caught sight of me,
"I’ve been hunting for you; it’s all over for to-day. Lu sent
me after you to come and have some tea. If you like, you can go
home directly afterwards with her and Mr. Warton."</p>

<p>I was much pleased to hear that Miss Lucy had sent after me,
but I didn’t want to show it.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" said I.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Joe, "I shan’t leave till all the Committee go; I
must be at the giving away of the prizes in the tent; and then,
if any thing should happen afterwards&mdash;any row, you know, or that
sort o’ thing &mdash;I shouldn’t like to be gone."</p>

<p>I didn’t say any thing more, as I thought I might just as well
leave it open; so I followed him to the west side of the Castle,
where the police tent stood, and it was quite quiet.</p>

<p>"Here they are," said Joe, "over in the ditch;" and he scrambled
up the bank, and I after him, and in the ditch below sure enough
was a most cozy tea-party. Miss Lucy, with her bonnet off, was
sitting cutting up a cake, and generally directing. Two other
young women, nice fresh-looking girls, but not to be named with
her, were setting out a few cups and saucers and plates, which
they had borrowed from some of the stalls. Mr. Warton was on his
knees with his hat off, blowing away till he was red in the face
at a little fire made of chips and pieces of old hampers, over
which the kettle, also borrowed, hung from three sticks driven
into the ground so that their tops met above the fire. Two or
three young farmers sat about looking on, or handing things as
they were wanted, except one impudent young fellow of about eighteen,
with scarcely a hair on his chin, who was almost in Miss Lucy’s
pocket, and was meddling with every thing she was doing.</p>

<p>"Well, here you are, at last," said she, looking up at us; "why,
where have you been all day?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I have been hunting after you very often," said I,
which, perhaps, was rather more than I ought to have said; "but
it isn’t easy for one who is a stranger to find people in such
a crowd."</p>

<p>"I don’t know that," said she, with a pretty little toss of her
head; "where there’s a will there’s a way. If I hadn’t found friends,
I might have been alone all day&mdash;and there are three or four of
the shows I have never seen, now."</p>

<p>I began to look as sorry as I could, while I thought what to
answer, when the young man who was close to her tried to steal
some of the cake; she turned round quickly, and rapped his fingers
with the back of her knife, and he pretended to be hurt. She only
laughed, and went on cutting up the cake, but she called him Jack,
and seemed so intimate with him that it put me out, and I sat
down on the other side of the circle, some way off.</p>

<p>"It’s all right," said the Parson, looking up from the fire;
"boils splendidly&mdash;give me the tea."</p>

<p>Miss Lucy handed him a little parcel of tea from her bag, and
he put it into the kettle.</p>

<p>"I declare we have forgotten the milk," said she; "do run and
fetch it, Jack&mdash;it’s in a bottle under the back seat of the four-wheel."</p>

<p>I jumped up before Jack, who hardly moved, and ran off to fetch
the milk; for which she gave me a pleasant smile when I came back,
and I felt better pleased, and enjoyed the tea and cake and bread
and butter, and all the talk over it, very much; except that I
couldn’t stand this Jack, who was forcing her to notice him every
minute, by stealing her teaspoon or her cake, or making some of
his foolish remarks.</p>

<p>The sun set splendidly before we had finished, and it began to
get a little chilly.</p>

<p>"Well," said Joe, jumping up, "I’m off to get the horse put to.
You’d better be starting, Lu; you won’t be down hill much before
dark, now, and there’s no moon&mdash;worse luck."</p>

<p>"Very well," said she, taking up her bonnet, and putting it on;
"we shall be ready in five minutes."</p>

<p>"You’ll go behind with them, I suppose," said Joe to me.</p>

<p>"I’m to have a seat, mind," struck in that odious Jack; "Lucy
promised me that an hour ago." I could have given him a good kick;
however, I don’t think I showed that I was put out.</p>

<p>"How can you tell such fibs, Jack?" said she; but I didn’t take
any notice of that.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I wish to stay on the hill," said I. "Besides, the
four-wheel will be full without me."</p>

<p>She didn’t seem to hear; and began talking to one of the other
girls.</p>

<p>"But how are you to get down?" said Joe.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can walk," said I, "or ride behind you."</p>

<p>"Very good, if you like," said he; "the chestnut would carry
six, if her back was long enough;" and away he went to get the
four-wheel ready.</p>

<p>We followed; Miss Lucy sticking close to her friend, and never
saying a word to any of us. I walked with Mr. Warton, who was
in the highest spirits, looking over his shoulder, and raving
about the green tints in the sunset.</p>

<p>When we got to the carriages, there was kissing and shaking of
hands, and the rest went off, while the parson and Miss Lucy packed
into the front seat, and Jack and Jem the carter-boy into the
hind seat of the four-wheel; and away they drove, wishing us "good
night." I watched them for some time, and could see Jack leaning
forward close to her ear; and turned back with Joe into the Castle,
more out of sorts than I had been since I left London.</p>

<p>Joe hurried off to the police tent, where the Committee were
giving away the prizes, saying I should find him there when I
wanted him; and I loitered away to see whatever was to be seen.
At first nothing seemed to please me. I watched the men and boys
playing at three sticks a penny, and thought I might as well have
been on Primrose Hill. Then I went and looked at the shows; and
there was the fellow in flesh-coloured tights, turning over and
over on the slack rope, and the clarionet and French horn and
drum, played by the three men in corduroys, all out of tune and
louder than ever, as if they had only just begun, instead of having
been screaming and rumbling away all day; and the man outside
the pink-eyed lady’s caravan was shouting away for the hundredth
time all about her, and then playing the pan-pipes, as if no other
woman in the world had pink eyes.</p>

<p>I was determined they shouldn’t have any of my money at any rate,
so I strolled further down the line, and looked into a low booth
where a fiddle was going. Here several couples were dancing, with
their arms a-kimbo, on some planks which had been put down on
the grass, and all the rest of the booth was crowded with others
looking on. This pleased me better, for the dancers seemed to
enjoy themselves wonderfully, and made a sort of clattering accompaniment
to the music with their hob-nailed shoes, which was merry and
pleasant.</p>

<p>When I was tired of watching them, I thought I would go and find
Joe; so I went over to the tent, and there I got all right, and
began to enjoy myself again.</p>

<p>In the further corner of the tent, the Squire and another justice
were sitting, and hearing a charge of pocket-picking, of which
there were only two during the whole day, the police told me.
Opposite the door, the rest of the Committee were sitting at a
table and giving away the prizes.</p>

<p>Joe beckoned me in, and I went round to the back of the table
and looked on. As the men came up from the group round the door,
when their names were called out, the umpires said a few words
to each of them, and then gave them their prizes, and most of
them made some sort of speech in answer; for they were much less
shy than in the morning, I suppose from the sense of having earned
their right to hold up their heads by winning. The owner of the
successful donkey was just carrying out the flitch of bacon when
I arrived; after him the Somersetshire backsword players were
called in to take the first three prizes for that sport, they
having beaten all the Wiltshire men; while old Seeley, the only
Berkshire man entered, to everybody’s surprise had not played
out his tie, but had given his head (as they said) to his second
opponent. Therefore, although entitled to the last prize for having
won his first bout, he had not done all his duty in the eyes of
the umpires, who gently complained, while handing him over his
four half-crowns, and wondered that so gallant an old gamester,
and a Yale man, should not have played out his ties for the honour
of the county.</p>

<p>"Well, gen’l’men," said old Seeley, giving a hitch with his shoulders,
"I’ll just tell you how it was. You see, ther wur six Somersetshire
old gamesters come up to play, and ther wur six of our side to
play ’em; dree Wiltshire and dree Barkshire, if so be as we could
have made a party. But the dree from Wiltshire they wouldn’t go
in along wi’ we, and turned their backs on me and my two mates;
so my two mates wouldn’t go in at all, and wanted me to give out
too. But you see, gen’l’men, I’d a spent a matter of a pound over
getting myself a little better food, and making myself lissom;
so thinks I, I must go up and have a bout, let it be how t’wool.
And you saw, gen’l’men, as I played a good stick. When it cum’
to playing off the ties, there wur dree Somersetshire tiers, and
two of our side, that’s Slade and me. But when a man turns his
back on me, gen’l’men, why I turns my back on him; so I guv my
head to young Mapstone, and left Slade to win if he could. Though
I thinks, if thay Wiltshire chaps had behaved theirselves as thay
should, we might ha’ had the prize, for I knows as I never played
freer in my life. And I hopes, gen’l’men, as you don’t think I
wur afeard of any man as ever got on that stage. Bless you!" said
old Seeley, warming up, "I be that fond o’ thay sticks, I assure
you, gen’l’men, I’d as lief meet a man as is a man for a bout
wi’ thay sticks, as I would&mdash;a joint of roast beef."</p>

<p>Old Seeley’s speech carried conviction, for there could be no
mistake about the tone in which he drew his last comparison, after
a moment’s pause to think of the thing he liked best, and he retired
from the tent in high favour, as I think he deserved to be.</p>

<p>After watching these doings for some time, I began to feel very
hungry, for I had eaten hardly any thing at tea, so I told Joe
that he would find me over in the great booth getting some supper,
and went out. It was getting quite dark, and the stage and poles
looked black and melancholy as I passed by them. But the publicans’
booths were all lighted up inside, and looked very cheerful, and
were full of holiday folk, fortifying themselves with all sorts
of meat and drink before starting for the descent of the hill,
and the walk home in the dark.</p>

<p>I pushed my way through the crowd round the door, and reached
the bar, where the landlord recognized me directly, and handed
me over to Peter, who soon landed me at the table in the recess,
which was still well supplied with cold joints and bread and cheese.
While he went off to get my plate and ale, I had time to look
round. The booth was much gayer than the day before; every post
was decked more or less with flowers and evergreens, and the flags
had been brought inside. The whole place was lighted with dips
and flickering oil lamps, which gave light enough to let one see
all parts of the tent pretty clearly.</p>

<p>There were a good many tables ranged about; the one nearest to
ours wasn’t yet occupied, but at all the others were groups of
men drinking beer, and some smoking, and talking eagerly over
the events of the day. Those nearest the high table seemed under
some little restraint, and spoke low; but from the farther tables
rose a loud hum of the broadest Berkshire, and an occasional scrap
of a song. A few women were scattered here and there&mdash;mostly middle-aged,
hard-working housewives&mdash;watching their good men, and anxious
to carry them off in good time, and before too much of the harvest-savings
had found its way to the landlord’s till. About the entrance was
a continually-changing crowd, and the atmosphere of the whole
was somewhat close, and redolent of not very fragrant tobacco.</p>

<p>At the supper-table where I was, were seven or eight men. The
one just opposite me was a strong-built, middle-aged man, in a
pepper-and-salt riding-coat and waistcoat, with an open, weather-beaten
face, and keen, deep-set, gray eyes, who seemed bent on making
a good supper. Next above him were the two Oxford scholars, but
they didn’t take the least notice of me, which I thought they
might have done, after our morning’s ride together. They had finished
supper, and were smoking cigars, and chatting with one another,
and with the pepper-and-salt man, whom they called Doctor. But
my observations were soon cut short by Peter, who came back with
my plate and knife and fork, and a foaming pewter of ale, and
I set to work as heartily as the Doctor himself.</p>

<p>"You’ll find some of this lettuce and watercress eat well with
your beef, Sir," said he, pushing across a dish.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sir," said I; "I find that watching the games makes
one very hungry."</p>

<p>"The air, Sir, all the downs air," said the Doctor; "I call them
Doctor Downs. Do more for the appetite in six hours than I can
in a week. Here, Peter, get this gentleman some of your mistress’s
walnut pickles."</p>

<p>And then the good-natured Doctor fell to upon his beef again,
and chatted away with the scholars and me, and soon made me feel
myself quite at home. I own that I had done my neighbours a little
injustice; for they were pleasant enough when the ice was once
broken, and I daresay didn’t mean to be rude after all.</p>

<p>As soon as I had finished my supper, the shorter of the scholars
handed me a large cigar, the first whiff of which gave me a high
idea of the taste of my contemporaries of the upper classes in
the matter of tobacco.</p>

<p>Just then the verse of a song, in which two or three men were
joining, rose from the other end of the tent, from amidst the
hum of voices.</p>

<p>"I wish those fellows would sing out," said the short scholar;
"I can’t make out more than a word or two."</p>

<p>"You wouldn’t be any the wiser if you could," said the other;
"we have ceased to be a singing nation. The people have lost the
good old ballads, and have got nothing in their place."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" said the short scholar; "I should like to
hear for myself, at any rate."</p>

<p>"What sort of ballads do you mean, Sir?" said I to the long scholar.</p>

<p>"Why, those in the Robin Hood Garland, for instance," said he.
"Songs written for the people, about their heroes, and, I believe,
by the people. There’s nothing of the sort now."</p>

<p>"What do you say to ‘There’s a Good Time Coming’?" asked the
short scholar.</p>

<p>"Well, it’s the best of them, I believe," said the other; "but
you know it was written by Mackay, an <em>LL.D. </em>Besides,
it’s essentially a town song."</p>

<p>"It’s a tip-top one, at any rate," said the short scholar; "I
wish I could write such another."</p>

<p>"What I say, is, that the popular songs now are written by <em>litterateurs</em>
in London, Is there any life or go in ‘Woodman spare that Tree,’
or ‘The Old Arm-Chair’? and they are better than the slip-slop
sentimental stuff most in vogue."</p>

<p>"What a discontented old bird you are!" said the short scholar;
"you’re never pleased with any product of this enlightened century."</p>

<p>"Let the century get a character, then; when it does, we shall
get some good staves. I’m not particular; a brave story, or a
quaint story, or a funny story, in good rough verse, that’s all
I ask for. But, where to find one? Here’s the Doctor for umpire.
I say, Doctor, don’t you agree with me, now?"</p>

<p>"Not quite," said the Doctor, looking up from his cold beef.
"I dare say you wouldn’t think them worth much; but there are
plenty of ballads sung about which you never hear."</p>

<p>"What! real modern ballads, written by some of the masses, in
this century, for instance? Where did you ever hear one, Doctor?
What are they like, now?"</p>

<p>"Well, my work takes me a good deal about in queer places, and
at queer times, amongst the country folk, and I hear plenty of
them. Will one about Lord Nelson suit you? There’s an old patient
of mine at the next table who owns a little coal wharf on the
canal; he fell into the lock one night, broke his arm, and was
nearly drowned, and I attended him. He takes a trip in the barges
now and then, which makes him fancy himself half a sailor. I dare
say I can set him off, if he hasn’t had too much beer."</p>

<p>So the Doctor walked over to a lower table, and spoke to a grisly-headed
old man in a velveteen coat and waistcoat, and a blue birdseye-neckerchief,
who seemed pleased, and drew his sleeve across his mouth, and
cleared his throat. Then there was a rapping on the table, and
the old bargee began in a rumbling bass voice:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>THE DEATH OF LORD NELSON</em>.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Come all you gallant seamen as unites a meeting,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Attend to these lines I be going to relate,<br/>
And when you have heard them ’twill move you with pity<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To think how Lord Nelson he met with his fate.<br/>
For he was a bold and undaunted commander<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As ever did sail on the ocean so wide;<br/>
He made both the French and the Spaniard surrender<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By always a-pouring into them a broadside.

</p>
<p>
One hundred engagements ’twas he had been into,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ne’er in his life was he known to be beat,<br/>
Though he’d lost an arm, likewise a right eye, boys,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No power upon earth ever could him defeat.<br/>
His age at his death it was forty and seven;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And as long as I breathe, his great praises I’ll sing;<br/>
The whole navigation was given up to him,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he was loyal and true to his king.

</p>
<p>
Then up steps the doctor in a very great hurry,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And unto Lord Nelson these words did he say:<br/>
"Indeed, then, my Lord, it is I’m very sorry,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see you here lying and bleeding this way."<br/>
"No matter, no matter whatever about me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My time it is come, I’m almost at the worst;<br/>
But here’s my gallant seamen a-fighting so boldly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Discharge off your duty to all of them first."

</p>
<p>
Then with a loud voice he calls out to his captain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray let me, sir, hear how the battle does go,<br/>
For I think our great guns do continue to rattle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though death is approaching I firmly do know."<br/>
"The antagonist’s ship has gone down to the bottom,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighteen we have captive and brought them on board,<br/>
Four more we have blown quite out of the ocean,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is the news I have brought you, my Lord."

</p>
<p>
Come all you gallant seamen as unites a meeting,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Always let Lord Nelson’s memory go round,<br/>
For it is your duty, when you unites a meeting,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he was loyal and true to the crownd.<br/>
And now to conclude and finish these verses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"My time it is come; kiss me, Hardy," he cried.<br/>
Now thousands go with you, and ten thousand blessings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For gallant Lord Nelson in battle who died.

</p>
<p>
Mourn, England, mourn, mourn and complain,<br/>
For the loss of Lord Nelson, who died on the main.

</p>
</div>
<p>The short scholar was in raptures; he shouted in the chorus;
he banged the table till he upset and broke his tumbler, which
the vigilant landlady from behind the casks duly noted, and scored
up to him.</p>

<p>I worked away at my note-book, and managed to get all the song,
except one verse between the second and third, which I couldn’t
catch.</p>

<p>"Bravo, Doctor! Here, waiter, get me another tumbler, and some
more gin-punch. What a stunning call. Couldn’t the old bird give
us another bit of history? It’s as good as reading ‘Southey’s
Life,’ and much funnier," rattled away the short scholar.</p>

<p>"What a quaint old grisly party it is!" said the long scholar;
"I shall stand him a pot of beer."</p>

<p>"Well, he won’t object to that," said the Doctor, working away
at the beef and pickles.</p>

<p>"Here, waiter, take a pot of beer, with my compliments, over
to that gentleman," said the long scholar, pointing to the old
bargeman, "and say how much obliged we are to him for his song."</p>

<p>So Peter trotted across with the liquor, and the old man telegraphed
his acknowledgments.</p>

<p>"By the way, Doctor," said the short scholar, "as you seem to
know a good deal about these things, can you tell me what ‘Vicar
of Bray’ means? I saw two men quarrelling just after the games,
and it was all their wives could do to keep them from fighting,
and I heard it was because one had called the other ‘Vicar of
Bray.’"</p>

<p>"It means ‘turn-coat’ in Berkshire," answered the Doctor. "I
didn’t think they used the name now; but I remember the time when
it was the common term of reproach. I dare say you know Bray,
gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"I should think so," said the short scholar; "pretty village
just below Maidenhead. I pulled by it on my way to town last June."</p>

<p>"Yes, and it’s hard on such a pretty village to have had such
a bad parson," said the Doctor.</p>

<p>"I say, Doctor, give us the ‘Vicar of Bray,’ now, it will set
off some of the singing birds at the other end of the booth; I
can see they’re getting into prime piping order."</p>

<p>"Very good, if you like it," said the Doctor, pushing away his
plate, and taking a finishing pull at his pewter, "only the song
is in print, I know, somewhere; so you mustn’t think you’ve found
much of a prize, Sir," added he to me, for my use of pencil and
note-book hadn’t escaped him.</p>

<p>"No, Sir," said I; "but I should like to hear it, of all things."</p>

<p>So the Doctor, without further preface, began in his jolly clear
voice&mdash;</p>

<p><em>THE VICAR OF BRAY</em>.</p>

In good King Charles’s golden days,<br/>

Passive obedience was a joke,<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Except the times do alter.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this is law, &amp;c.

<p>The short scholar was right as to the effect of the Doctor’s
song. It was hailed with rapturous applause by the lower tables,
though you would have said, to look at them, that scarcely a man
of the audience, except those close round the singer, could have
appreciated it. People don’t always like best what they fully
understand; and I don’t know which is the greatest mistake, to
fancy yourself above your audience, or to try to come down to
them. The little stiffness which the presence of strangers belonging
to the broad-cloth classes had at first created amongst the pastime
folk was wearing off, and several songs were started at once from
the distant parts of the booth, all of which, save one, came to
untimely ends in the course of the first verse or so, leaving
the field clear to a ruddy-faced, smock-frocked man, who, with
his eyes cast up to the tent-top, droned through his nose the
following mournful ditty:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>THE BARKSHIRE TRAGEDY</em>.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
A varmer he lived in the West Countree,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey-down, bow-down,<br/>
A varmer he lived in the West Countree,<br/>
And he had daughters one, two, and dree.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I’ll be true to my love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my love’ll be true to me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey-down, bow-down,<br/>
As thay wur walking by the river’s brim,<br/>
The eldest pushed the youngest in.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I’ll be true, &amp;c.

<p>
"Oh sister, oh sister, pray gee me thy hand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey-down, &amp;c.<br/>
And I’ll gee thee both house and land."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I’ll, &amp;c.

So down she sank and away she swam,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey-down, &amp;c.<br/>
Until she came to the miller’s dam.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I’ll, &amp;c.

<p>
The miller’s daughter stood by the door,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey-down, &amp;c.<br/>
As fair as any gilly-flow-èr.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey-down, &amp;c.<br/>
Very much like a drownded gentlewomàn."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I’ll, &amp;c.

<p>
The miller he fot his pole and hook,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey-down, &amp;c.<br/>
And he fished the fair maid out of the brook.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I’ll, &amp;c.

<p>
"Oh miller, I’ll gee thee guineas ten,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey-down, &amp;c.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey-down, &amp;c.<br/>

But the Crowner he cum, and the Justice too,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey-down, &amp;c.<br/>
With a hue and a cry and a hulla-balloo.<br/>

They hanged the miller beside his own gate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey-down, &amp;c.<br/>
For drowning the varmer’s daughter, Kate.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I’ll, &amp;c.

<p>
The sister she fled beyond the seas,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey-down, &amp;c.<br/>
And died an old maid among black savageès.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I’ll, &amp;c.

</p>
<p>
So I’ve ended my tale of the West Countree,<br/>
And they calls it the Barkshire Trage-dèe.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I’ll, &amp;c.

</p>
</div>
<p>"The Barkshire Tragedy, indeed! Now, Doctor, what have you to
tell us about this? When did it happen? Who was the lady? Was
she drowned in the Thames, the Kennet, or where?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don’t know. All I can say is, she was drowned before my
time; for I remember hearing the song when I was a little chap
in petticoats. But the story seems a common one. There’s a north-country
ballad founded on it, I know, but I don’t remember the name just
now."</p>

<p>"‘The Bonny Mill-dams of Binnorie,’ is not it?" said the long
scholar.</p>

<p>"Aye, that’s the name, I think."</p>

<p>"Well, it’s very odd, for we’ve got the same story, all but the
miller, and his daughter as fair as any gilly-flower (why are
millers’ daughters always pretty, by the way?), on the Welsh marshes,"
said the long scholar.</p>

<p>"Then, Sir, I must call on you to sing it. The call is with me
at our end of the booth," said the Doctor. "And, Peter, bring
me a little cold gin-and-water, and a pipe. If I must breathe
smoke-poison, I may as well make it myself, at any rate."</p>

<p>"Well, singing’s rather more than I bargained for. However, I
suppose I mustn’t spoil sport; so here goes."</p>

<p><em>THE DROWNED LADY</em>.</p>

<p><em>Qy. another version of the Barkshire Tragedy?</em></p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Oh, it was not a pheasant cock,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet a pheasant hen,<br/>
But oh it was a lady fair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came swimming down the stream.

</p>
<p>
An ancient harper passing by<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found this poor lady’s body,<br/>
To which his pains he did apply<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a sweet melòdy.

</p>
<p>
To cat-gut dried he her inside,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drew out her back-bone,<br/>
And made thereof a fiddle sweet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All for to play upon.

</p>
<p>
And all her hair so long and fair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That down her back did flow,<br/>
Oh he did lay it up with care,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To string his fiddle bow.

</p>
<p>
And what did he with her fingers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which were so straight and small?<br/>
Oh, he did cut them into pegs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To screw up his fid-dòll.

</p>
<p>
Then forth went he, as it might be,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a summer’s day,<br/>
And met a goodly company,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who asked him in to play.

</p>
<p>
Then from her bones he drew such tones<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As made their bones to ache,<br/>
They sounded so like human groans,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their hearts began to quake.

</p>
<p>
They ordered him in ale to swim,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sorrow’s mighty dry,<br/>
And he to share their wassail fare<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essayd right willingly.

</p>
<p>
He laid his fiddle on a shelf<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that old manor-hall,<br/>
It played and sung all by itself,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus sung this fid-dòll:&mdash;

</p>
<p>
"There sits the squire, my worthy sire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-drinking hisself drunk,<br/>
And so did he, ah woe is me!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day my body sunk.

</p>
<p>
"There sits my mother, half asleep,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-taking of her ease,<br/>
Her mind is deep, if one might peep,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her preserves and keys.

</p>
<p>
"There sits my sister, cruel Joan,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who last week drownded me;<br/>
And there’s my love, with heart of stone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sits making love to she.

</p>
<p>
"There sits the Crowner, Uncle Joe,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which comforteth poor me;<br/>
He’ll hold his Crowner’s quest, I know,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get his Crowner’s fee."

</p>
<p>
Now when this fiddle thus had spoke<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It fell upon the floor,<br/>
And into little pieces broke,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No word spoke never more.

</p>
</div>
<p>"Thank you, Sir," said the Doctor; "that’s a queer tune though.
I don’t know that I ever heard one at all like it. But I shouldn’t
say all that song was old now."</p>

<p>"Well, I believe you’re right. But I can say, as you said of
the Barkshire Tragedy, it’s all older than my time, for I remember
my father singing it just as I’ve sung it to you as long as I
can remember any thing."</p>

<p>"And what did he say of it?"</p>

<p>"Well, he said that five out of the first six verses were very
old indeed. He had heard them often when he was a child, and always
the same words. The rest was all patch-work, he said, by different
hands, and he hardly knew which were the old lines, and which
new."</p>

<p>"I say," remarked the short scholar, "the Doctor don’t seem to
be a bad hand at making the smoke-poison."</p>

<p>The Doctor blew out a long white cloud, and was about to reply,
when a brawny young carter, at a distant table, took his pipe
from his lips, and, in answer to the urgings of his neighbours,
trolled out the following little piece of sentiment:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>CUPID’S GARDEN</em>.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
As I wur in Cu-bit’s gardin<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not mwoar nor haf an hour,<br/>
’Twur ther I zeed two may-dens<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Zittin under Cu-bit’s bower,<br/>
A-gatherin of sweet jassa-mine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The lilly and the rose.<br/>
These be the fairest flowers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the gardin grows.

</p>
<p>
I vondly stepped to one o’ them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These words to her I zays,<br/>
"Be you engaged to arra young man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come tell to me, I prays."<br/>
"I beant engaged to narra young man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I solemnly declare;<br/>
I aims to live a may-den,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And still the lau-rel wear."

</p>
<p>
Zays I, "My stars and gar-ters!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This here’s a pretty go,<br/>
Vor a vine young mayd as never wos<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To sar’ all mankind zo."<br/>
But the t’other young may-den looked sly at me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And vrom her zeat she risn,<br/>
Zays she, "Let thee and I go our own waay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And we’ll let she go shis’n."

</p>
</div>
<p>"Oh, I say, that beats all!" said the short scholar, with a shout
of laughter. "I must have the words somehow. Let’s see, how did
he begin? something about Cubit. What a rum notion to call Cupid,
Cubit. What was it, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"You shouldn’t laugh, really, Sir, at our west-country sentiment,"
said the Doctor, with astounding gravity. "I don’t think I can
conscientiously help you to the words, when I know you’ll only
be making fun of them at some wine-party. They are meant for malt
drinkers, not for wine drinkers."</p>

<p>"Fudge, Doctor. Come, now, give us the words, or I shall have
to go over and ask the performer for them."</p>

<p>"I think I can give you them," said I, looking up from my note-book.</p>

<p>"What a thing it is to write shorthand!" said the Doctor, glancing
at my hieroglyphics; "we don’t learn that sort of thing down in
these parts."</p>

<p>"I wonder we haven’t had more sentimental songs," said the long
scholar; "I suppose there are plenty of love-stories going about?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, plenty," said the Doctor; "mostly ballads telling how
rich young heiresses disdained all good matches, for the sake
of a sailor boy with tarry trousers, or a seductive fogger, thereby
provoking their cruel match-making parents. For instance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Says the daughter to the mother, "Your art is all in vain,<br/>
For Dukes and Lords and Earls alike their riches I disdain;<br/>
I’d rather live a humble life, and my time I would employ<br/>
Increasing nature’s prospects, with my bonny labouring boy.""

</p>
</div>
<p>"What on earth can ‘increasing nature’s prospects’ mean?" asked
the long scholar.</p>

<p>"How can I tell?" said the Doctor, laughing; "I don’t pretend
to construe; I only give you the words. But you must allow the
moral to be good. It runs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Success to every labouring boy that ploughs and hoes the ground,<br/>
For when his work is over, his home he will enjoy;<br/>
So happy is the girl that gets a bonny labouring boy."

</p>
</div>
<p>"Let’s see," said the short scholar, "we’ve had specimens of
patriotic, legendary, and sentimental ditties; but how about drinking
songs? All tuneful nations, since the world began, have sung the
praises of good liquor."</p>

<p>"I don’t know that we have many drinking songs," said the Doctor;
"I suppose it takes wine, or spirits at any rate, to make a man
write such stuff as ‘the glasses sparkle,’ or ‘a bumper of Burgundy.’
The bucolic muse only gets smallish beer. But we must see what
we can do for you." So the Doctor beckoned to Peter, and sent
him off to the lower tables with a pot of beer, the speedy result
of which mission was the following song:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>TOVEY’S TAP. &</em>mdash;<em>AIR, "</em><em>Derry down</em>."</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>"A good cast, Doctor;" said the long scholar; "but you’ve raised
the wrong fish. That isn’t what my friend here meant by a drinking
song. He expects a bucolic rendering of one of Moore’s songs,
and you serve him out a queer pot-house tale. Is there no enthusiasm
for good drink amongst you?"</p>

<p>"I wish there were less," said the Doctor, with a sigh; "at any
rate, less consumption of bad drink. Tippling is our great curse,
as it is that of all England; but there’s less of it than there
used to be. But for a drinking song such as you mean, I’m at fault.
The nearest approach to it that I know of is a song of which I
only remember two lines. They run&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Sartinly the sixpenny’s the very best I’ve see’d yet,<br/>
I do not like the fourpenny, nor yet the intermediate.

</p>
</div>
<p>"But even here you see, though the poet was meditating on drink,
it was in a practical rather than an enthusiastic spirit."</p>

<p>Just then, a stout old yeoman entered the booth, dressed in a
broad straight-cut brown coat with metal buttons, drab breeches,
and mahogany tops; and, marching up to the bar, ordered a glass
of brandy and water; while his drink was being prepared, he stood
with his back to our table, talking to the landlord.</p>

<p>"We’re in luck," said the Doctor in a low voice, pointing to
the new-comer with the end of his pipe; "if he stays, we shall
have the best old song in all the west country, sung as it should
be."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked the short scholar.</p>

<p>"An old Gloucestershire farmer from Sutherup way, famous for
his breed of sheep. He must be near seventy, and has twelve miles
to ride home to-night, and won’t think so much of it as you or
I would."</p>

<p>"He looks a tough old blade."</p>

<p>"You may say that. But he isn’t the man he was, for he has lived
pretty hard. He used to be a famous wrestler; and one day, many
years ago, an Ilsley dealer came down to buy his flock of two-year
olds. They drank six bottles of port over the deal, and got it
all straight out except the odd sheep, but they couldn’t make
out, cipher it how they would, who the odd sheep belonged to;
so they agreed to wrestle for the odd sheep in the farmer’s kitchen,
and somehow both of them got hurt, and the old boy has never gone
quite right since."</p>

<p>"What an old sponge! six bottles of port between two of them!
no wonder they couldn’t do their sum."</p>

<p>"Ah, we mustn’t judge of the men of his time by our rules," said
the Doctor; "it was part of a yeoman’s creed in those days to
send his friends off drunk, and to be carried to bed himself by
his fogger and carter, or else to sleep under his kitchen-table.
They lived hard enough, and misused a deal of good liquor meant
to strengthen man’s heart, following the example of their betters;
but they had their good points. That old man, now, is the best
master in all his neighbourhood; and he and the parson keep up
the wages in the winter, and never let a man go to the house who
will work."</p>

<p>The old farmer turned round, glass in hand, and came and sat
down at the table. "Your sarvant, gen’l’men," said be, taking
off his broad-brimmed beaver. "Why, Doctor," he went on, recognizing
our friend, and holding out his great bony hand, "be main glad
to zee ’ee."</p>

<p>"Thank you, farmer," said the Doctor, returning the grip; "we
haven’t met this long while; I’m glad to see you wearing so well."</p>

<p>"Yes, I be pretty-feteish, thank God," said the farmer. "Your
health, sir, and gen’l’men."</p>

<p>After a little judicious talk on the day’s sport, the Doctor
suddenly began, "Now, farmer, you must do us a favour, and give
us your famous old Gloucestershire song. I’ve been telling all
our friends here about it, and they’re keen to hear it."</p>

<p>"’Spose you means Gaarge Ridler?" said the farmer.</p>

<p>"Of course," said the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Well, I don’t know as I’ve zung these score o’ months," said
the farmer, "but hows’mever, if you wants it, here goes." So the
farmer finished his brandy and water, cleared his throat, balanced
himself on the hind legs of his chair, cast up his eyes and began&mdash;</p>

<p>"What’s he saying&mdash;what language?" whispered the tall scholar.</p>

<p>"Mad old party," murmured the short scholar.</p>

<p>"Hush," whispered the Doctor; "that’s the orthodox way to begin;
don’t put him out."</p>

<p>I couldn’t tell what in the world to write, but the farmer went
on with growing emphasis&mdash;</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause, during which the Doctor had much
difficulty in keeping order; then the farmer got fairly under
weigh, and went on&mdash;</p>

<p>Just as the farmer was finishing the song, Master George, with
Joe and one or two more behind him, came in. He took up the last
verse, and rolled it out as he came up towards our table, and
a lot of the rest joined in with him; even the over-worked Peter,
I could see stopping for a moment to shout that he would be buried
under the tap; I dare say he meant it, only I think he would like
it to be always running.</p>

<p>Master George knew most of the people, and made us all merrier
even than we were before; and in the next half-hour or so, for
which time we stayed in the booth, I should think there must have
been a dozen more songs sung. However, I shall only give the one
which seemed to be the greatest favourite, for I find that this
chapter is running very long. This song was sung by a queer little
man, with a twisted face, and a lurcher dog between his knees,
who I believe was an earth stopper. He called it</p>

<p><em>BUTTERMILK JACK</em>.</p>

Ther wur an owld ’oman as had but one son,<br/>
And thay lived together as you med zee;<br/>
And they’d nought but an owld hen as wanted to sett,<br/>
Yet somehow a landlord he fain would be.

</p>
<p>
"Oh, I’ve been and begged me some buttermilk, mother,<br/>
Off of an owld ’oman as has girt store;<br/>
And I shall well rewarded be,<br/>
Vor she’s g’in me haf a gallon or mwore.

</p>
<p>
"Oh mother, my buttermilk I will sell,<br/>
And all for a penny as you med zee;<br/>
And with my penny then I will buy eggs,<br/>
Vor I shall have seven for my pennèy.

</p>
<p>
"Oh mother, I’ll set them all under our hen,<br/>
And seven cock chickens might chance for to be;<br/>
But seven cock chickens or seven cap hens,<br/>
There’ll be seven half-crownds for me.

</p>
<p>
"Oh, I’ll go carry them to market, mother,<br/>
And nothing but vine volk shall I zee;<br/>
And with my money then I will buy land,<br/>
Zo as a landlord I med be."

</p>
<p>
"Oh my dear zon, wilt thee know me,<br/>
When thee hast gotten great store of wealth?"<br/>
"Oh, my dear mother, how shall I know thee,<br/>
When I shall hardly know my own self?"

</p>
<p>
With that the owld ’oman she flew in a passion,<br/>
And dashed her son Jack up agin the wall,<br/>
And his head caught the shelf where the buttermilk stood,<br/>
So down came the buttermilk, pitcher and all.

</p>
<p>
Zo aal you as has got an old hen for to sett,<br/>
Both by night and by day mind you has her well watched,<br/>
Lest you should be like unto Buttermilk Jack,<br/>
To reckon your chickens before thay are hatched.

<p>"Well, I must be moving," said the Doctor at last, looking at
his watch; "how do you get home, Mr. Hurst?"</p>

<p>"Bless us! near nine o’clock," said Joe, following the Doctor’s
example; "oh, I ride myself, and my friend here talks of going
behind."</p>

<p>"Better not ride double, the night’s dark," said the Doctor,
hoisting on his overcoat with Peter’s help. "If he likes to take
his luck in my gig, I can put him down at your gate. What do you
say, Sir?"</p>

<p>I thankfully accepted; for I didn’t at all like the notion of
riding behind Joe on the chestnut, and I can’t think how I could
ever have been such a fool as to say I would do it. The Doctor
had two bright lamps to his gig, which gave us glimpses of the
closed booths and camping places of the people who were going
to stay on the hill all night, as we drove out of the Castle.
I suggested that it must be very bad for the people sleeping out
up there.</p>

<p>"For their health?" said he, "not a bit of it, on a fine night
like this&mdash;do ’em good; I wish they always slept so healthily."</p>

<p>"I didn’t quite mean that, Sir!"</p>

<p>"Oh, for their morals? Well, I don’t know that there’s much harm
done. I’m sorry to say they’re used to crowding&mdash;and, after all,
very few but the owners of the booths, and the regular tramps,
stay up here. Didn’t you see how quiet every thing was?"</p>

<p>I said I had noticed this; and then he began asking me about
the sports, for he had only got on to the hill late in the afternoon;
and when we came to the wrestling and backsword play, I asked
him whether he thought they did any harm.</p>

<p>"No," said he, "there are very few serious accidents&mdash;in fact
none&mdash;now that drink is not allowed on the stage. There used to
be some very brutal play in out-of-the-way places, where the revels
were got up by publicans. But that is all over, at least about
this part of the country."</p>

<p>"Then you wouldn’t stop them, Sir?"</p>

<p>"Stop them! not I &mdash;I would encourage them, and make the
parish clerk and constable perpetual umpires." And then he went
on to say how he should like to see the young fellows in every
parish drilled in a company, and taught all sorts of manly exercises,
and shooting especially; so that they would make good light troops
at a day’s notice, in case of invasion. But he was afraid the
great game preservers would never allow this. And in the middle
of his talk, which seemed very sensible, we came to Joe’s gate,
and I got down, and wished him good night.</p>

<p>I found the family gone to bed, and only Joe and the Parson in
the kitchen, and there, over a last pipe, we chatted about the
sports.</p>

<p>At last the Parson turned to me, and said, "You saw a good deal
of the play on the stage; now, would you stop it if you could?"</p>

<p>I thought a minute over what I had seen, and what the Doctor
had said.</p>

<p>"No, Sir," said I, "I can’t say that I would."</p>

<p>"That’s candid," said he. "And now I’ll make an admission. There’s
a good deal of the play that wants very close watching. The umpires
should be resolute, quick men, and stand no nonsense. I saw one
or two bouts to-day that should have been stopped."</p>

<p>"You see," said Joe, taking his pipe out of his mouth, "there
allus must be."</p>

<p>"We don’t admit your evidence, Joseph," interrupted the Parson,
"you are a prejudiced witness."</p>

<p>"But you haven’t changed your mind, Sir," said I.</p>

<p>"No," said he, "I should be sorry to hear that these sports had
died out, but I should like to hear that people took an interest
in them who could manage the men thoroughly."</p>

<p>"The Doctor," said I, "as we drove home, said he would have the
parish clerk and constable for perpetual umpires."</p>

<p>"They wouldn’t be so good as the parson or the squire," said
he; "if I were rector of one of the parishes where they are still
kept up, I would give prizes for them, but I would always be umpire
myself."</p>

<p>"I wish to goodness you was then," said Joe, as we lighted our
candles.</p>

<p>"You remember, Sir," said I, "that you promised to write a sermon
about the pastime."</p>

<p>"What! <em>after</em> the fair?" said he.</p>

<p>"’Twill do just as well," said Joe, "I should mortally like to
hear it."</p>

<p>"Well, it might keep you awake perhaps. He has an hereditary
weakness for slumber in church, you must know," said the Parson,
turning to me; "when we wanted to alter the sittings in the church
six or seven years ago, his father stood out for his old high
box so sturdily, that I took some pains to argue with him, and
to find out what it was which made it so dear to him. I found
out at last that it was a snug corner, which just fitted his shoulders,
where nobody could see him, and where, as soon as the text was
given out, in his own words, "I just watches my missus wipe her
spectacles, and fix herself to listen, and then I vaulds my arms
and thenks o’ nothin’."</p>

<p>I looked at Joe to see how he would take it, but he only chuckled,
and said, "Well, ’tis the parson’s business to keep us awake.
But a sermon on our sports, just showing folk about the rights
on it, is just what I should amazingly like to have by me."</p>

<p>The Parson looked at Joe for a moment very curiously, and then
said, "Very well, I will write you one. Good night."</p>

<p>And so we went off to bed.</p>

<p>[36] "Spend"&mdash;to consume.</p>

<p>[37] "Scrow"&mdash;angry.</p>

<p>[38] "Purly"&mdash;purblind.</p>

<p>[39] "Stabble"&mdash;to tread dirt about.</p>
