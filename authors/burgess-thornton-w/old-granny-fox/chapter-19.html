Investigate and for yourself find out<br/>
Those things which most you want to know about.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Old Granny Fox.

</div>
<p>Never in all his life had Reddy Fox enjoyed a dinner more than
that one he and Granny had stolen from Bowser the Hound. Of course
it would have tasted delicious anyway, because they were so dreadfully
hungry, but to Reddy it tasted better still because it had been
intended for Bowser. Bowser has hunted Reddy so often that Reddy
has no love for him at all, and it tickled him almost to death
to think that they had taken his dinner from almost under his
nose.</p>

<p>With that good dinner in their stomachs, Reddy and Granny Fox
felt so much better that the Great World no longer seemed such
a cold and cruel place. Funny how differently things look when
your stomach is full from the way those same things look when
it is empty. Best of all they knew they could play the same sharp
trick again and steal another dinner from Bowser if need be. It
is a comforting feeling, a very comforting feeling, to know for
a certainty where you can get another meal. It is a feeling that
Granny and Reddy Fox and many other little people of the Green
Meadows and the Green Forest seldom have in winter. As a rule,
when they have eaten one meal, they haven't the least idea where
the next one is coming from. How would you like to live that way?</p>

<p>The very next day Granny and Reddy went up to Farmer Brown's
at Bowser's dinner hour. But this time Farmer Brown's boy was
at work near the barn, and Bowser was not chained. Granny and
Reddy stole away as silently as they had come. On the day following
they found Bowser chained and stole another dinner from him; then
they went away laughing until their sides ached as they heard
Bowser's whines of surprise and disappointment when he discovered
that his dinner had vanished. They knew by the sound of his voice
that he hadn't the least idea what had become of that dinner.</p>

<p>Now there was some one else roaming over the snow-covered meadows
and through the Green Forest and the Old Pasture these days with
a stomach so lean and empty that he couldn't think of anything
else. It was Old Man Coyote. You know he is very clever, is Old
Man Coyote, and he managed to find enough food of one kind and
another to keep him alive, but never enough to give him that comfortable
feeling of a full stomach. While he wasn't actually starving,
he was always hungry. So he spent all the time when he wasn't
sleeping in hunting for something to eat.</p>

<p>Of course he often ran across the tracks of Granny and Reddy
Fox, and once in a while he would meet them. It struck Old Man
Coyote that they didn't seem as thin as he was. That set him to
thinking. Neither of them was a smarter hunter than he. In fact,
he prided himself on being smarter than either of them. Yet when
he met them, they seemed to be in the best of spirits and not
at all worried because food was so scarce. Why? There must be
a reason. They must be getting food of which he knew nothing.</p>

<p>"I'll just keep an eye on them," muttered Old Man Coyote.</p>

<p>So very slyly and cleverly Old Man Coyote followed Granny and
Reddy Fox, taking the greatest care that they should not suspect
that he was doing it. All one night he followed them through the
Green Forest and over the Green Meadows, and when at last he saw
them go home, appearing not at all worried because they had caught
nothing, he trotted off to his own home to do some more thinking.</p>

<p>"They are getting food somewhere, that is sure," he muttered,
as he scratched first one ear and then the other. Somehow he could
think better when he was scratching his ears. "If they don't get
it in the night, and they certainly didn't get anything this night,
they must get it in the daytime. I've done considerable hunting
myself in the daytime, and I haven't once met them in the Green
Forest or seen them on the Green Meadows or up in the Old Pasture.
I wonder if they are stealing Farmer Brown's hens and haven't
been found out yet. I've kept away from there myself, but if they
can steal hens and not be caught, I certainly can. There never
was a Fox yet smart enough to do a thing that a Coyote cannot
do if he tries. I think I'll slip up where I can watch Farmer
Brown's and see what is going on up there. Yes, Sir, that's what
I'll do."</p>

<p>With this, Old Man Coyote grinned and then curled himself up
for a short nap, for he was tired.</p>
