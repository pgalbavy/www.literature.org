<p>One of the Most Memorable Sea Fights Ever Known &mdash;The Wonderful
Exploit of Captain Paul Jones.</p>

<p>I have taken Paul Jones as the highest type of the infant American
navy. There were others who fought with great bravery and did
much to aid in the struggle for American independence, but none
combined in such perfection the qualities of perfect seamanship,
cool but dauntless courage and skill in fighting.</p>

<p>Of course, no matter how daring our cruisers, they did not always
escape disaster. At the close of the Revolution there had been
twenty-four vessels lost, carrying 470 guns. Several of these
met their fate through shipwreck. Contrast with this the loss
of Great Britain, which was 102 war vessels, carrying in all 2,624
guns. The total vessels of all kinds captured from the English
by our cruisers and privateers was about 800.</p>

<p>Captain Jones had made so successful a cruise with the <em>Ranger</em>
that he felt, upon returning to Brest, in France, he was entitled
to a better ship. He wrote to Benjamin Franklin, expressing himself
plainly on that point, and the American commissioner, after several
months' delay, had a ship of 40 guns placed under the command
of Jones. Her original name was the <em>Duras</em>, but at Jones's
request it was changed to the <em>Bonhomme Richard</em>. This
was in compliment to Franklin, who was often called "Poor Richard"
by his admiring countrymen, because for many years he had published
"Poor Richard's Almanac," filled with wise and witty sayings.</p>

<p>This ship was an old Indiaman, in which 42 guns were placed,
and the final number of her crew was 304. The 32-gun frigate <em>Alliance</em>,
Captain Landais, was put under the orders of Captain Jones and
a third, the <em>Pallas</em>, was bought and armed with thirty
guns. A merchant brig and a cutter were also added to the squadron.
It was found very hard to man these vessels and any other captain
than Jones would have given up the task as an impossible one.
It seemed as if about every known nation in the world was represented
and some of the men of the most desperate character. Maclay says
in his "History of the American Navy" that the muster roll of
the <em>Bonhomme Richard</em> showed that the men hailed from
America, France, Italy, Ireland, Germany, Scotland, Sweden, Switzerland,
England, Spain, India, Norway, Portugal, Fayal and Malasia, while
there were seven Maltese and the knight of the ship's galley was
from Africa. The majority of the officers, however, were American.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</em>.]</p>

<p>This squadron sailed from L'Orient on June 19, 1779. Almost immediately
trouble occurred. Captain Landais, without any show of reason,
claimed that the command, by right of seniority of commission,
belonged to him. On the first night out the <em>Alliance</em>
and <em>Bonhomme Richard</em> collided and were obliged to return
to port for repairs. Vexatious delays prevented the sailing of
the squadron until August 14.</p>

<p>One of the consorts captured an English war vessel in the latter
part of June, but was compelled to abandon her on the appearance
of a superior force of the enemy, and the squadron put into L'Orient
for repairs. A piece of good fortune came to the <em>Bonhomme
Richard</em> while in this port. About a hundred exchanged American
prisoners volunteered and did a great deal to improve the discipline
and strengthen the crew of Jones's ship.</p>

<p>The valiant American, however, met with difficulties that were
of the most exasperating nature. A boat's crew deserted and spread
the news of the arrival of the squadron off the English coast.
Captain Landais, commander of the <em>Alliance</em>, refused to
obey the signals of the flagship, and conducted himself so outrageously
that Jones more than suspected his brain was askew. The <em>Bonhomme
Richard</em> was old and in bad condition, but Jones told Benjamin
Franklin in a letter that he meant to do something with her that
would induce his Government to provide him with a better ship.
He sailed almost completely around Great Britain, during which
he captured seventeen vessels, most of which were destroyed though
the more valuable were sent into port in charge of prize crews.</p>

<p>This depletion of his crew so weakened it that Captain Jones
wisely refrained from remaining long in one place. Doubling Flamborough
Head, he came up with his companions, the <em>Pallas</em> and
the <em>Alliance</em>, the latter having been out of his company
for a fortnight.</p>

<p>This was on September 23, 1779. It was near noon, while the American
squadron was chasing a British brigantine and was approaching
Flamborough Head from the south, that a large sail was discovered,
rounding that promontory from the south. Another and another followed,
the astonished Americans counting them until the number had mounted
up to forty-two.</p>

<p>It was a startling sight, for if these vessels were ships of
war nothing could save the American squadron, or, if most of them
were merchantmen, under a strong escort, the peril of Captain
Jones and his crews would be almost as great. The commander studied
the fleet through his glass, allowing it to come closer and closer
and holding himself ready to flee, should it be necessary to do
so. Finally, after a long scrutiny, Jones's face lit up with exultation.
There were only two vessels of war in the fleet, and he immediately
gave the signal for pursuit.</p>

<p>The <em>Serapis</em>, commanded by Captain Pearson, knew that
he was confronted by the redoubtable Paul Jones, and he welcomed
a fight with him, for the British captain was one of the bravest
of men. He signalled for the merchantmen to scatter, and they
did so with the utmost haste, while the frigate with her consort,
the <em>Countess of Scarborough</em>, boldly advanced to engage
the American squadron.</p>

<p>It was at this critical moment that the captain of the <em>Alliance</em>
once more showed his insubordination. He refused to obey Jones's
signal to fall to the rear of the <em>Bonhomme Richard</em> and
the <em>Pallas</em> for a time was equally disobedient. Soon,
however, she changed her conduct and gallantly advanced to engage
the <em>Countess of Scarborough</em>. Captain Landais, however,
sullenly kept out of the battle, and, as we shall presently learn,
did even worse than that.</p>

<p>Captain Pearson, of the <em>Serapis</em>, waited until his convoy
was beyond danger, when he tacked inshore. Fearing he would get
away, Jones ran in between him and the land. It was now growing
dark, and it was hard for the American commander to follow the
movements of his enemy. But the latter was not fleeing, and, although
dimly visible to each other, the two antagonists began cautiously
approaching, both on the alert for any advantage that might present
itself. Nothing but the rippling of water made by the vessels
broke the profound, expectant hush that rested upon both.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the gloom came the voice of the captain of the
<em>Serapis</em>:</p>

<p>"What ship is that?"</p>

<p>Jones wished to get nearer before opening fire and replied:</p>

<p>"I do not understand you; speak louder."</p>

<p>"What ship is that?" repeated the other in a louder voice through
his trumpet. "Answer or I shall fire into you."</p>

<p>Jones made no reply, knowing that it was useless, but continued
to edge near his antagonist. A minute later both ships discharged
a broadside at the same moment, the gloom being lit up by spouts
of crimson flame, while the thunder "shook the mighty deep" and
the sulphurous smoke rolled slowly upward and drifted through
the rigging. Then again came a minute or so of impressive stillness,
while the crews of both looked around to learn the results of
the awful tempest of round shot, grape and canister of which they
had been the targets.</p>

<p>Sad work, indeed, had been done, for from each vessel rose the
cries of the wounded and dying&mdash;cries that inspired their companions
to revenge and caused them to hasten the reloading and firing
of the cannon. But unfortunately the <em>Bonhomme Richard</em>
suffered from her own guns as well as from those of the enemy.
On the lower gun deck was an improvised battery of six 18-pounders,
two of which burst, killing most of the men at work there and
tearing away the deck above them. The remainder of the men refused
to serve the other guns, and thus the <em>Bonhomme Richard</em>
was deprived of the services of her heaviest battery, in addition
to the serious loss in dead and wounded.</p>

<p>Captain Jones forged ahead, crossing his enemy's bow, while the
latter came up on his port quarter. They were within a biscuit's
toss of each other, wrapped in dense smoke, lit up by the jets
of flame which were continuous. Mingled with the terrific booming
was the spiteful rattle of musketry from the tops and yells and
cries of the wounded. The decks of the <em>Bonhomme Richard</em>
were slippery with blood, which increased until the men, as they
ran to and fro, splashed in it, like children playing in a mud
puddle, and it was the same on the <em>Serapis</em>. It found
its outlet through the scuppers and crimsoned the deep blue of
the ocean.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>FIGHT BETWEEN "BONHOMME RICHARD" AND "SERAPIS</em>."]</p>

<p>Some of the shots from the <em>Serapis</em> pierced the <em>Bonhomme
Richard</em> under the water line, causing her to leak badly.
Deprived of his 18-pound guns by reason of the accident mentioned,
Jones was forced to rely upon his 12-pounders. They were worked
for all that was in them, but the whole fourteen were silenced
in little more than half an hour and seven of the quarter deck
and forecastle guns were dismounted. She was left with three 9-pounders,
which, being loaded and aimed under the eye of Jones himself,
did frightful execution on the deck of the enemy.</p>

<p>An hour had passed and the men were fighting furiously, when
the full moon appeared above the horizon and lit up the fearful
scene. The <em>Serapis</em> attempted to cross the bow of the
<em>Bonhomme Richard</em>, but miscalculated and the <em>Bonhomme
Richard</em> shoved her bowsprit over the other's stern. In the
lull that followed, when each expected his antagonist to board,
Captain Pearson called out:</p>

<p>"Have you struck?"</p>

<p>"Struck!" shouted back Jones; "I am just beginning to fight!"</p>

<p>The <em>Serapis</em> made another effort to get into position
to rake the American, but in the blinding smoke she ran her jibboom
afoul of the starboard mizzen shrouds of the <em>Bonhomme Richard</em>.
Captain Jones himself lashed the spar to the rigging, knowing
that his only chance was in fighting at close quarters, but the
swaying of the ships broke them apart. At that instant, however,
the spare anchor of the <em>Serapis</em> caught on the American's
quarter and held the two vessels, as may be said, locked in each
other's arms.</p>

<p>They were so close, indeed, that the English gunners could not
raise the lower port lids, and they blew them off by firing their
cannon through them. The men on each ship in loading were forced
to push their rammers into the ports of the other vessel. The
<em>Bonhomme Richard</em> was set on fire by burning wads, but
the flames were speedily extinguished.</p>

<p>The explosion of the American's lower guns at the opening of
the battle had made her helpless against the corresponding battery
of the enemy, which pounded away until a huge, yawning gap was
opened. Some of the shots went clean through the battered hull
and splashed into the water, hundreds of feet distant. The disadvantage
was more than offset by the concentration of the Americans on
the upper deck and in the rigging. The fire of the <em>Bonhomme
Richard</em> became so terrible that every officer and man of
the enemy kept out of sight, observing which an American seaman
crawled out on the main yard, carrying a bucket of hand grenades
which he threw wherever he saw a man. He did this with such excellent
aim that he dropped one through the main hatchway and into the
gunroom. It fell into a heap of powder and produced an explosion
that was awful beyond description, for it killed and wounded thirty-eight
men and really decided the battle.</p>

<p>At that moment, when it all seemed over, Captain Landais fired
a broadside from the <em>Alliance</em> into the <em>Bonhomme Richard</em>.
Captain Jones called to him in God's name to desist, but he circled
about the two ships and fired again and again into his ally, killing
and wounding a number of men and officers. It was believed that
the <em>Alliance</em> had been captured by the enemy and had joined
in the attack on the <em>Bonhomme Richard</em>, which was so injured
that she began slowly to sink. Having wrought this irreparable
damage, the <em>Alliance</em> drew off and ceased her murderous
work.</p>

<p>Jones incited his prisoners to desperate pumping by the report
that the <em>Serapis</em> must soon go down and that the only
way to save themselves from drowning was to keep the <em>Bonhomme</em>
afloat. An officer ran to the quarter deck to haul down the colors,
but they had been shot away. He then hurried to the taffrail and
shouted for quarter. Jones, being in another part of the ship,
did not hear him. The British commander mustered his men to board
the American, but they were driven back by the firing from the
rigging of the <em>Bonhomme Richard</em>. The condition of the
latter could not have been more desperate. She was so mangled
that she began to settle, most of her guns had been disabled,
a fire that could not be checked was already close to her magazine
and several hundred prisoners were stealing here and there, waiting
for a chance to strike from behind.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>OLD-TIME BATTLESHIPS</em>.]</p>

<p>A deserter had slipped on board of the <em>Serapis</em> in the
confusion and acquainted the commander with the frightful plight
of the American. After firing with renewed ardor for several minutes
Captain Pearson again called to know whether Jones had surrendered.
He shouted back a defiant negative, and, pistol in hand, ordered
his men to the guns, threatening to kill the first one who refused.
All knew his temper too well to hesitate, and the battle was renewed
with greater fury than before. Captain Pearson could not believe
the condition of the <em>Bonhomme Richard</em> as bad as was represented
by the deserter. He had lost a great many men, all his guns were
silenced, and, being utterly unable to make any further defence,
he hauled down his flag with his own hands.</p>

<p>The surrender was just in time to save the <em>Bonhomme Richard</em>,
which was in danger of going down and blowing up. The united efforts
of both crews were necessary to extinguish the flames before they
reached the magazine. She was kept afloat through the night, while
the wounded and prisoners were transferred to the <em>Serapis</em>.
Then the battered and riddled old hulk plunged downward bow foremost
into the depths of the German Ocean.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>MEDAL PRESENTED BY CONGRESS TO CAPTAIN JOHN
PAUL JONES</em>.]</p>

<p>This battle has never been surpassed in heroism. Both sides fought
with a bravery that has given the conflict a place by itself in
naval annals, and it will always stand as a proof of the dauntless
courage of the Anglo-Saxon beyond the reach of those of the Latin
race. The <em>Bonhomme Richard</em> had 42 guns and the <em>Serapis</em>
50; the American crew numbered 304 and the English 320. The killed
on each side was 49; the wounded on the <em>Bonhomme Richard</em>
was 116 and on the <em>Serapis</em> 117, there being a difference
of only one in the total of killed and wounded. The battle lasted
three hours and a half.</p>

<p>The <em>Countess of Scarborough</em> made a gallant resistance
for two hours, when she was so crippled that she was compelled
to surrender to the Frenchman. An investigation into the treacherous
conduct of Captain Landais caused many to believe him insane,
though others were convinced that he was inspired by intense jealousy
of Captain Jones. He was discharged from both the French and American
navy. Benjamin Franklin was among those who believed he deserved
punishment for his perfidy.</p>

<p>The <em>Serapis</em> and <em>Countess of Scarborough</em> were
refitted and given to France, while Captain Jones was placed in
command of the <em>Alliance</em>. He was loaded with honors in
France, the king presenting him with a gold sword, and when he
sailed for the United States he gave another exhibition of his
superb seamanship by eluding the blockaders that were waiting
for him outside of Texel, running through the Straits of Dover
and then defiantly standing down the English Channel in full view
of more than one of the largest British fleets. He reached the
United States in June, 1780, without mishap.</p>

<p>Congress gave Captain Jones a vote of thanks, and, had the war
continued, no doubt he would have rendered more brilliant service
for the country he loved so well, but before he could be given
a fitting command hostilities ceased. He had won a world-wide
reputation and accepted the appointment of rear-admiral in the
Russian navy, but gained no opportunity to display his marvelous
prowess. He died in Paris in 1792.</p>
