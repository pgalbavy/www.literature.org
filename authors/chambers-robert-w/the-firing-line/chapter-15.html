<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Meanwhile Constance dressed hastily, abetted by the clever maid;
for Wayward was below, invited to dine with them. Malcourt also
was due for dinner, and, as usual, late.</p>

<p>In fact, he was at that moment leisurely tying his white neckwear
in his bed-chamber at Villa Cardross. And sometimes he whistled,
tentatively, as though absorbed in mentally following an elusive
air; sometimes he resumed a lighted cigarette which lay across
the gilded stomach of a Chinese joss, sending a thin, high thread
of smoke to the ceiling. He had begun his collection with one
small idol; there were now nineteen, and all hideous.</p>

<p>"The deuce! the deuce!" he murmured, rejecting the tie and trying
another one; "and all the things I've got to do this blessed night!...
Console the afflicted&mdash;three of them; dine with one, get to "The
Breakers" and spoon with another&mdash;get to the Club and sup with
another!&mdash;the deuce! the deuce! the&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hummed a bar or two of a new waltz, took a puff at his cigarette,
winked affably at the idol, put on his coat, and without a second
glance at the glass went out whistling a lively tune.</p>

<p>Hamil, dressed for dinner, but looking rather worn and fatigued,
passed him in the hall.</p>

<p>"You've evidently had a hard day," said Malcourt; "you resemble
the last run of sea-weed. Is everybody dining at this hour?"</p>

<p>"I dined early with Mrs. Cardross. Mrs. Carrick has taken Shiela
and Cecile to that dinner dance at the O'Haras'. It's the last
of the season. I thought you might be going later."</p>

<p>"Are you?"</p>

<p>"No; I'm rather tired."</p>

<p>"I'm tired, too. Hang it! I'm always tired&mdash;but only of Bibi.
Quand mÃªme! Good night.... I'll probably reappear with the dicky-birds.
Leave your key under that yellow rose-bush, will you? I can't
stop to hunt up mine. And tell them not to bar and chain the door;
that's a good fellow."</p>

<p>Hamil nodded and resumed his journey to his bedroom. There he
transferred a disorderly heap of letters, plans, contracts, and
blue-prints from his bed to a table, threw a travelling rug over
the bed, lay down on it, and lighted a cigar, closing his eyes
for a moment. Then he opened them wearily.</p>

<p>He did not intend to sleep; there was work waiting for him; that
was why he left the electric bulbs burning as safeguard against
slumber.</p>

<p>For a while he smoked, flat on his back; his cigar went out twice
and he relighted it. The third time he was deciding whether or
not to set fire to it again&mdash;he remembered that&mdash;and remembered
nothing more, except the haunted dreams in which he followed <em>her</em>,
through sad and endless forests, gray in deepening twilight, where
he could neither see her face nor reach her side, nor utter the
cry which strained in his throat.... On, on, endlessly struggling
onward in the thickening darkness, year after year, the sky a
lowering horror, the forest, no longer silent, a twisting, stupefying
confusion of sound, growing, increasing, breaking into a hellish
clamour!&mdash;</p>

<p>Upright on his bed he realised that somebody was knocking; and
he slid to the floor, still stupid and scarcely convinced.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Carrick's compliments, and is Mr. Hamil quite well bein'
as the lights is burnin' an' past two o'clock, sir?" said the
maid at the door.</p>

<p>"Past <em>two</em>! O Lord! Please thank Mrs. Carrick, and say
that I am going to do a little work, and that I am perfectly well."</p>

<p>He closed the door and looked around him in despair: "All that
stuff to verify and <em>O.K.! </em>What an infernal ass I am!
By the nineteen little josses in Malcourt's bedroom I'm so many
kinds of a fool that I hate to count up beyond the dozen!"</p>

<p>Stretching and yawning alternately he eyed the mass of papers
with increasing repugnance; but later a cold sponge across his
eyes revived him sufficiently to sit down and inspect the first
document. Then he opened the ink-well, picked up a pen, and began.</p>

<p>For half an hour he sat there, now refreshed and keenly absorbed
in his work. Once the stairs outside creaked, and he raised his
head, listening absently, then returned to the task before him
with a sigh.</p>

<p>All his windows were open; the warm night air was saturated with
the odour of Bermuda lilies. Once or twice he laid down his pen
and stared out into the darkness as a subtler perfume grew on
the breeze&mdash;the far fragrance of china-berry in bloom; Calypso's
breath!</p>

<p>Then, in the silence, the heavy throb of his heart unnerved his
hand, rendering his pen unsteady as he signed each rendered bill:
"<em>O.K. </em>for $&#11834;," and affixed his signature, "John Garret
Hamil, Architect."</p>

<p>The aroma of the lilies hung heavy in the room, penetrating as
the scent of Malcourt's spiced Chinese gums afire and bubbling.
And he thought again of Malcourt's nineteen little josses which
he lugged about with him everywhere from some occult whim, and
in whose gilt-bronze laps he sometimes burned cigarettes, sometimes
a tiny globule of aromatic gum, pretending it propitiated the
malice-brooding gods.</p>

<p>And, thinking of Malcourt, suddenly he remembered the door-key.
Malcourt could not get in without it. And the doors were barred
and chained.</p>

<p>Slipping the key into his pocket he opened his door, and, treading
quietly through the silent house, descended to the great hall.
With infinite precaution he fumbled for the chains; they were
dangling loose. Somebody, too, had drawn the heavy bars, but the
door itself was locked.</p>

<p>So he cautiously unlocked it, and holding the key in his hand,
let himself out on the terrace.</p>

<p>And at the same moment a shadowy figure turned in the starlight
to confront him.</p>

<p>"Shiela!"</p>

<p>"Is that you, Mr. Hamil?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What on earth are you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! What are <em>you</em> doing down here?"</p>

<p>"Louis Malcourt is out. I forgot to leave a key for him under
the yellow rose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Under the rose&mdash;and yellow at that! The mysteries of the Rosicrucians
pale into insignificance beside the lurid rites of Mr. Malcourt
and Mr. Hamil&mdash;under the yellow rose! Proceed, my fearsome adept,
and perform the occult deed!"</p>

<p>Hamil descended the terrace to the new garden, hung the key to
a brier under the fragrant mass of flowers, and glanced up at
Shiela, who, arms on the balustrade above him, was looking down
at the proceedings.</p>

<p>"Is the dread deed done?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"If you don't believe it come down and see."</p>

<p>"I? Come down? At <em>two</em> in the morning?"</p>

<p>"It's half-past two."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "if it's half-past two I might think of coming
down for a moment&mdash;to look at my roses.... Thank you, Mr. Hamil,
I can see my way very clearly. I can usually see my own way clearly&mdash;without
the aid of your too readily offered hand.... Did you ever dream
of such an exquisitely hot night! That means rain, doesn't it?&mdash;with
so many fragrances mingling? The odour of lilies predominates,
and I think some jasmine is in the inland wind, but my roses are
very sweet if you only bend down to them. A rose is always worth
stooping for."</p>

<p>She leaned over the yellow blossoms, slender, spirit-white in
the starlight, and brushed her fresh young face with the silken
petals.</p>

<p>"So sweet," she said; "lean down and worship my young roses,
you unappreciative man!"</p>

<p>For a few minutes she strolled along the paths of the new garden
he had built, bending capriciously here and there to savour some
perfect blossom. The night was growing warmer; the sea breeze
had died out, and a hot wind blew languidly from the west.</p>

<p>"You know," she said, looking back at him over her shoulder,
"I don't want to go to bed."</p>

<p>"Neither do I, and I'm not going."</p>

<p>"But I'm going.... I wonder why I don't want to? Listen! Once&mdash;after
I was a protoplasm and a micro-organism, and a mollusc, and other
things, I probably was a predatory animal&mdash;nice and sleek with
velvet feet and shining incandescent eyes&mdash;and very, very predatory....
That's doubtless why I often feel so deliciously awake at night&mdash;with
a tameless longing to prowl under the moon.... And I think I'd
better go in, now."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he said, "I'm not going to bed yet."</p>

<p>"Oh! And what difference might that make to me? You are horridly
conceited; do you know it?"</p>

<p>"Please stay, Calypso. It's too hot to sleep."</p>

<p>"No; star-prowling is contrary to civilized custom."</p>

<p>"But every soul in the house is sound asleep&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should hope so! And you and I have no business to be out here."</p>

<p>"Do little observances of that sort count with you and me?"</p>

<p>"They don't," she said, shaking her head, "but they ought to.
I <em>want</em> to stay. There is no real reason why I shouldn't&mdash;except
the absurd fear of being caught unawares. Perhaps, perhaps I might
stay for ten more minutes.... Oh, the divine beauty of it all!
How hot it is!&mdash;the splash of the fountains seems to cool things
a little&mdash;and those jagged, silvery reflections of the stars,
deep, deep in the pool there.... Did you see that fish swirl to
the surface? Hark! What was that queer sound?"</p>

<p>"Some night bird crying in the marshes. It will rain to-morrow;
the wind is blowing from the hammock; that's why it's hot to-night;
can you detect the odour of wild sweet-bay?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;at moments. And I can just hear the surf&mdash;calling, calling
'Calypso!' as you called me once.... I <em>must</em> go, now."</p>

<p>"To the sea or the house?" he asked, laughing.</p>

<p>She walked a few paces toward the house, halted, and looked back
audaciously.</p>

<p>"I'd go to the sea&mdash;only I'm afraid I'd be found out.... Isn't
it all too stupid! Where convention is needless and one's wish
is so harmless why should a girl turn coward at the fear of somebody
discovering how innocently happy she is trying to be with a man!...
It makes me very impatient at times." ... She turned, hesitated,
stepped nearer and looked him in the face, daringly perverse.</p>

<p>"I want to go with you!... Have we not passed through enough
together to deserve this little unconventional happiness?" She
was breathing more quickly. "I <em>will</em> go with you if you
wish."</p>

<p>"To the sea?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It is only a half mile by the hammock path. The servants
are awake at six. Really, the night is too superb to waste&mdash;alone.
But we must get back in time, if I go with you."</p>

<p>"Have you a key?"</p>

<p>"Yes, here in my gloves"&mdash;stripping them from her bare arms.
"Can you put them into your pocket with the key?... And I'll pin
up my skirt to get it out of the way.... What? Do you think it's
a pretty gown? I did not think you noticed it. I've danced it
to rags.... And will you take this fan, please? No, I'll wear
the wrap&mdash;it's only cobweb weight."</p>

<p>She had now pinned up her gown to walking-skirt length; her slim
feet were sheathed in silken dancing gear; and she bent over to
survey them, then glanced doubtfully at Hamil, who shook his head.</p>

<p>"Never mind," she said resolutely; "only we can't walk far on
the beach; I could never keep them on in the dune sands. Are you
ready, O my tempter?"</p>

<p>Like a pair of guilty ghosts they crossed the shadowy garden,
skirted the dark orange groves, and instead of entering the broad
palm-lined way that led straight east for two miles to the sea,
they turned into the sinuous hammock path which, curving south,
cut off nearly a mile and a half.</p>

<p>"It's rather dark," she said.</p>

<p>They walked for a few minutes in silence; and, at first, she
could not understand why he insisted on leading, because the path
was wide enough for both.</p>

<p>"I <em>will</em> not proceed in this absurd manner," she said
at last&mdash;"like an Indian and his faithful squaw. Why on earth
do you&mdash;"</p>

<p>And it flashed across her at the same instant.</p>

<p>"Is <em>that</em> why?"&mdash;imperiously abrupt.</p>

<p>"What?" he asked, halting.</p>

<p>She passed her arm through his, not gently, but her laughing
voice was very friendly:</p>

<p>"If we jump a snake in the dark, my friend, we jump him <em>together</em>!
It's like you, but your friend Shiela won't permit it."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's only a conventional precaution&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes? Well, we'll take chances together.... Suppose&mdash;by the wildest
and weirdest stretch of a highly coloured imagination you jumped
a rattler?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>Suppose</em> you did?"</p>

<p>He said, sobered: "It would be horribly awkward for you to explain.
I forgot about&mdash;"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "She walked a few paces toward the house, halted,
and looked back audaciously."]</p>

<p>"Do you think I meant <em>that</em>! Do you think I'd care what
people might say about our being here together? I &mdash;I'd <em>want</em>
them to know it! What would I care&mdash;about&mdash;anything&mdash;then!"</p>

<p>Through the scorn in her voice he detected the awakened emotion;
and, responsive, his pulse quickened, beating hard and heavy in
throat and breast.</p>

<p>"I had almost forgotten," he said, "that we might dare look at
things that way.... It all has been so&mdash;hopeless&mdash;lately&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?... Yes, I understand."</p>

<p>"Do you?&mdash;my trying to let you alone&mdash;trying to think differently&mdash;to
ignore all that has been said?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... This is no time to bring up such things." Her uneven
breathing was perceptible to him as she moved by his side through
the darkness, her arm resting on his.</p>

<p>No, this was no time to bring up such things. They knew it. And
she, who in the confidence of her youth had dared to trust her
unknown self, listened now to the startled beating of her heart
at the first hint of peril.</p>

<p>"I wish I had not come," she said.</p>

<p>He did not ask her why.</p>

<p>"You are very silent&mdash;you have been so for days," she added;
then, too late, knew that once more her tongue had betrayed her.
"Don't answer me," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because what I say is folly.... I &mdash;I must ask you to release
my hands.... You know it is only because I think it safer for&mdash;us;
don't you?"</p>

<p>"What threatens <em>you</em>. Calypso?"</p>

<p>"Nothing.... I told you once that I am afraid&mdash;even in daylight.
Ask yourself what I fear here under the stars with you."</p>

<p>"You fear <em>me</em>?"&mdash;managing to laugh.</p>

<p>"No; I dread your ally&mdash;my unknown self&mdash;in arms eternally to
fight for you," she answered with forced gaiety. "Shall we kill
her to-night? She deserves no consideration at our hands."</p>

<p>"Dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! That is not the countersign on the firing line. Besides
it is treachery, because to say that word is aiding, abetting,
and giving information and comfort to our enemies. Our enemies,
remember, are our other and stealthy selves." Her voice broke
unsteadily. "I am trying so hard," she breathed, "but I cannot
think clearly unless you help me. There is mutiny threatening
somewhere."</p>

<p>"I have tried, too," he said.</p>

<p>"I know you have. Do you suppose I have been untouched by your
consideration for me all these long days&mdash;your quiet cheerfulness&mdash;your
dear unselfishness&mdash;the forbidden word!&mdash;but what synonym am I
to use?... Oh, I know, I know what you are doing, thinking, feeling&mdash;believe
me&mdash;believe me, I know! And&mdash;it is what you must do, of course.
But&mdash;if you only did not show it so plainly&mdash;the effort&mdash;the strain&mdash;the
hurt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do I show it?" he asked, chagrined. "I did not know that."</p>

<p>"Only to me&mdash;because I know. And I remember how young you were&mdash;that
first day. Your whole expression has changed.... And I know why....
At times it scarcely seems that I can bear it&mdash;when I see your
mouth laughing at the world and your eyes without mirth&mdash;dead&mdash;and
the youth in you so altered, so quenched, so&mdash;forgive me!&mdash;so
useless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To what better use could I devote it, Shiela?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't know!&mdash;you don't know! &mdash;You are free; there
are other women, other hopes&mdash;try to understand what freedom means!"</p>

<p>"It means&mdash;<em>you,</em>, Shiela."</p>

<p>She fell silent; then:</p>

<p>"Wherever I turn, whatever I say&mdash;all paths and words lead back
again to you and me. I should not have come."</p>

<p>The hard, hammering pulse in his throat made it difficult for
him to speak; but he managed to force an unsteady laugh; "Shiela,
there is only one way for me, now&mdash;to fire and fall back. I've
got to go up to Portlaw's camp anyhow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And after that?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ascott wants a miniature Versailles. I'll show you the
rough sketches&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And after that?"</p>

<p>"I've one or two promises&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And afterward?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"You will never&mdash;see me&mdash;again. Is that what 'nothing' means?"</p>

<p>They walked on in silence. The path had now become palely illumined;
the sound of the surf was very near. Another step or two and they
stood on the forest's edge.</p>

<p>A spectral ocean stretched away under the stars; ghostly rollers
thundered along the sands. North and south dunes glimmered; and
the hot fragrance of sweet-bay mingled with the mounting savour
of the sea.</p>

<p>She looked at the sea, the stars, blindly, lips apart, teeth
closed, her arm still resting on his.</p>

<p>"Nothing," she repeated under her breath; "that was the best
answer.... Don't touch my hand!... I was mad to come here....
How close and hot it is! What is that new odour&mdash;so fresh and
sweet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"China-berry in bloom&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is it?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure; once I thought it was&mdash;you; the fragrance of your
hair and breath &mdash;Calypso."</p>

<p>"When did you think that?"</p>

<p>"Our first night together."</p>

<p>She said: "I think this is our last."</p>

<p>He stood for a while, motionless; slowly raised his head and
looked straight into her eyes; took her in his arms; holding her
loosely.</p>

<p>White of cheek and lip, rigid, her eyes met his in breathless
suspense. Fear widened them; her hands tightened on his wrists
behind her.</p>

<p>"Will you love me?"</p>

<p>"No!" she gasped.</p>

<p>"Is there no chance?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>Her heart was running riot; every pulse in rebellion. A cloud
possessed her senses, through which her eyes fought desperately
for sight.</p>

<p>"Give me a memory&mdash;to carry through the years," he said unsteadily.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Not one?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"To help us endure?"</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned in his arms, covering her eyes with both
hands.</p>

<p>"Take&mdash;what&mdash;you wish&mdash;" she panted.</p>

<p>He touched one slim rigid finger after another, but they clung
fast to the pallid face. Time and space reeled through silence.
Then slowly, lids still sealed with desperate white hands, her
head sank backward.</p>

<p>Untaught, her lips yielded coldly; but the body, stunned, swayed
toward him as he released her; and, his arm supporting her, they
turned blindly toward the path. Without power, without will, passive,
dependent on his strength, her trembling knees almost failed her.
She seemed unconscious of his lips on her cheek, on her hair&mdash;of
her cold hands crushed in his, of the words he uttered&mdash;senseless,
broken phrases, questions to which her silence answered and her
closed lids acquiesced. If love was what he was asking for, why
did he ask? He had his will of her lips, her hair, her slim fragrant
hands; and now of her tears&mdash;for the lashes were wet and the mouth
trembled. Her mind was slowly awaking to pain.</p>

<p>With it, far within her in unknown depths, something else stirred,
stilling her swelling heart. Then every vein in her grew warm;
and the quick tears sprang to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Dearest&mdash;dearest&mdash;" he whispered. Through the dim star-pallor
she turned toward him, halted, passing her finger-tips across
her lashes.</p>

<p>"After all," she said, "it was too late. If there is any sin
in loving you it happened long ago&mdash;not to-night.... It began
from the&mdash;the beginning. Does the touch of your lips make me any
worse?... But I am not afraid&mdash;if you wish it&mdash;now that I know
I always loved you."</p>

<p>"Shiela! Shiela, little sweetheart&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I love you so &mdash;I love you so," she said. "I cannot help
it any more than I could in dreams&mdash;any more than I could when
we met in the sea and the fog.... Should I lie to myself and you?
I know I can never have you for mine; I know &mdash;I know. But
if you will be near me when you can&mdash;if you will only be near&mdash;sometimes&mdash;"</p>

<p>She pressed both his hands close between hers.</p>

<p>"Dear&mdash;can you give up your freedom for a girl you cannot have?"</p>

<p>"I did so long since."</p>

<p>She bent and laid her lips on his hands, gravely.</p>

<p>"I must say something&mdash;that disturbs me a little. May I? Then,
there are perils&mdash;warnings&mdash;veiled hints.... They mean nothing
definite to me.... Should I be wiser?... It is difficult to say&mdash;senseless&mdash;showing
my ignorance, but I thought if there were perils that I should
know about&mdash;that could possibly concern me, now, you would tell
me, somehow&mdash;in time&mdash;"</p>

<p>For a moment the revelation of her faith and innocence&mdash;the disclosure
of how strange and lost she felt in the overwhelming catastrophe
of forbidden love&mdash;how ignorant, how alone, left him without a
word to utter.</p>

<p>She said, still looking down at his hands held between her own:</p>

<p>"A girl who has done what I have done, loses her bearings....
I don't know yet how desperately bad I am. However, one thing
remains clear&mdash;only one&mdash;that no harm could come to&mdash;my family&mdash;even
if I have given myself to you. And when I did it, only the cowardly
idea that I was wronging myself persisted. If that is my only
sin&mdash;you are worth it. And if I committed worse &mdash;I am not
repentant. But&mdash;dear, what you have done to me has so utterly
changed me that&mdash;things that I never before heeded or comprehended
trouble me. Yesterday I could not have understood what to-night
I have done. So, if there lies any unknown peril in to-morrow,
or the days to come&mdash;if you love me you will tell me.... Yet I
cannot believe in it. Dearly as I love you I would not raise one
finger to comfort you at <em>their</em> expense. I would not go
away with you; I would not seek my freedom for your sake. If there
is in my love anything base or selfish I am not conscious of it.
I cannot marry you; I can only live on, loving you. What danger
can there be in that for you and me?"</p>

<p>"None," he said.</p>

<p>She sighed happily, lifted her eyes, yielded to his arms, sighing
her heart out, lips against his.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the forest a bird awoke singing like a soul in Paradise.</p>
