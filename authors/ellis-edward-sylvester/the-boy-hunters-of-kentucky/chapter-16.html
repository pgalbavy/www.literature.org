<p>I have told you what befell Will and George Burton when they
made their attempt to find out who had kindled the camp fire in
the valley below the ridge on which they halted.  But the experience
of Jack Gedney was the strangest of all.</p>

<p>You have learned enough about this boy to admit that he was bright
and alert, and that when he moved through the woods he always
kept his senses about him.  Like his friend Will, he thought it
best to pass slightly beyond the camp before approaching it, though
for myself I cannot see the reason for such a course.</p>

<p>Instead, therefore, of taking the most direct route, he moved
to the left, so that, when opposite to the Wyandots, he was really
farther away from them than while on the ridge.  The distance
was such indeed that he failed to hear the signal of Will, who
supposed it was loud enough to travel a long way through the wilderness.</p>

<p>Pausing for a moment, Jack carefully looked about him, and even
among the tops of the trees.  The only living thing which he saw
was a huge rattlesnake, that was crawling by a stump a few yards
away. Like the majority of mankind, the first prompting of the
lad was to rush forward and kill the reptile.  In fact, he started
to do so.</p>

<p>Instantly the serpent twisted itself into a coil, and with its
head rearing from the centre, shook its rattle as an invitation
to attack. Jack could have easily shot off its head, and he would
have been glad to do so, for it was an unusually large and repulsive
pest, but to fire his gun at such a time would have been an imprudence
for which there could be no excuse.</p>

<p>"I’ll let you go," he said, looking steadily at it for a few
seconds; "but it’s well for you that I didn’t meet you before
I knew anything about this camp."</p>

<p>The <em>crotalus</em> species is easily killed, but this specimen,
finding its invitation to a fight not accepted, unwound, and crawled
off.</p>

<p>Seeing and hearing nothing, Jack began moving towards the camp,
though, like his friends, he was unable to see anything of the
smoke that was their guide when they halted on the crest of the
ridge. He had travelled through the forest long enough, however,
to keep his bearings, and he was sure that he was going in a straight
line for the camp, which, he was almost equally sure, belonged
to the Wyandot tribe of Indians.</p>

<p>"It will be odd if I find Hua-awa-oma there," he said to himself,
while stealthily picking his way.  "I wonder what he would say
if I should walk up to him and offer my hand?  I am afraid he
wouldn’t be so kind as he was a while ago."</p>

<p>The boy was stepping in this guarded manner, as wide awake as
ever, when, like Will, his toe caught in one of the running vines
close to the ground, and he stumbled forward.  He did not fall,
though he came very near doing so.  His head was thrown forward
and downward in his effort to check himself.</p>

<p>No accident could have been more fortunate for it saved Jack’s
life.  At the very instant of stumbling he heard the twang of
a bow-string, and the missile which was aimed at him, whizzed
over his shoulder and was buried in the trunk of a tree beyond.</p>

<p>In obedience to a thought that came like an inspiration to him,
the boy allowed himself to fall forward on his hands and knees,
where he remained motionless for several seconds.  Turning his
head he saw the arrow that had missed him by a hair’s-breadth
with its head buried deep in the bark, while the feathered shaft
was still quivering from the force of the impact.</p>

<p>The missile was fired by Arowaka, who, in returning to camp,
caught sight of his enemy in front of him.  Seeing him fall at
the moment the arrow left his hand, and failing to note where
it went, the young savage thought the lad had been fatally pierced
by the shaft.  Whipping out his knife, he ran forward with the
intention of taking the scalp from his victim.</p>

<p>He had but a short distance to go when he caught sight of the
white boy, who, instead of lying on the ground in his death struggles,
was kneeling on one knee, with his cocked rifle levelled at the
head of the young Wyandot.</p>

<p>The latter, with a terrified "Hoof!" stopped as if shot, and
stood transfixed, absolutely unable to stir. He saw he was at
the mercy of his foe, who he did not believe would spare his life
for a dozen seconds.</p>

<p>"<em>Arowaka, you’re mine!</em>" said Jack, slowly rising to
his feet, but keeping his gun levelled.</p>

<p>The words seemed to rouse the senses of the Indian youth, who
dropped his bow, folded his arms, and, throwing his shoulders
back as he faced his conqueror, said in a low, firm voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arowaka ready!  He die like warrior!"</p>

<p>There was a heroism in the pose and words of the youthful Wyandot
which thrilled Jack Gedney. Almost any one would have started
to run, or, seeing there was no hope in doing so, would have begged
for mercy.  The Indian did neither, but, the son of a sachem as
he was, he proved that he could die like the bravest of his people.</p>

<p>But, bless your heart, Jack had not the least wish to harm him. 
The law of the border would have told him to shoot him, since
the action of the Indian proved him to be a mortal enemy, and
one who, unwilling to show mercy himself, did not deserve that
any should be shown to him.</p>

<p>Jack would have done his utmost to slay the young savage had
they met in mortal combat, but the check came before that point
was reached.  And, again, he was touched by the cool daring of
Arowaka.</p>

<p>Hardly were the words spoken by the Indian when Jack lowered
his gun, softly letting down the hammer, and said, with a smile&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arowaka, let us be friends."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he stepped forward and offered his hand to the young
Wyandot.</p>

<p>You would have been entertained could you have seen the face
of Arowaka when he grasped the meaning of the words and actions
of his conqueror. The paint smeared over his countenance could
not hide the expressions of bewilderment, of wonder, and then
of delight, that succeeded each other so quickly that he extended
his own hand, and shook that of Jack with a warmth of pressure
which made him wince.</p>

<p>"Arowaka love Jack."</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the depth of feeling that prompted these
words, spoken in a low voice, in which there was a quaver that
was not there when he declared himself ready to die.</p>

<p>The Indian felt that the youth who had overthrown him in the
wrestling bout, and whose death he had treacherously attempted,
had now given back his own life to him.  That stratum of gratitude
which, though hidden deeper in some hearts than others, nevertheless
<em>is there</em>, and <em>can be reached</em>, had been found
by Jack.  The burning hatred of Arowaka for the youth was now
turned to love.</p>

<p>The American might feel an enmity for ever toward the Caucasian,
but against this single member of that race he could never know
aught but deep affection.</p>

<p>I tell you, boys and girls, there is nothing like kindness and
charity in winning the hearts of your enemies.  Make the test,
and prove it for yourselves.</p>

<p>At the moment the two youths of different blood stood with hands
clasped and looking in each other’s face, a third party silently
pressed forward into sight.</p>

<p>He was Hua-awa-oma, the chieftain, and father of Arowaka.</p>

<p>He must have been surprised by the sight, knowing how resentful
his son felt towards the white youth for overthrowing him, but
the explanation was quickly made.</p>

<p>It seemed that Hua-awa-oma and his son had started out on a scout
together (a number of warriors being similarly employed), when
the former decided to return to camp.  He directed his son to
take a different route from his own, and thus it came about that
they met as they did in the vicinity of the war party.</p>

<p>Arowaka dropped the hand of his new friend, and turning to his
father, told him the story.</p>

<p>Of course, Jack did not understand a word spoken, but the language
of the American Indian is largely made up of gesture, and our
young friend was sure of the general run of the story.</p>

<p>He-who-Fights-Without-Falling (which, you know, was the meaning
in English of the name of Hua-awa-oma) looked straight in the
face of the narrator while he was speaking, but did not utter
a word.  Jack, however, noted the gleam of his eye, and he knew
that whatever it might mean, it signified no harm to him.</p>

<p>The story was a brief one; but as the Christian kindness of Jack
went home to the heart of the son, so did the touching narrative
thereof stir the deepest feelings of the swarthy heathen who had
wrenched the hair from the head of more than one quivering victim,
and sunk his tomahawk into the brain of more than one poor wretch
pleading for mercy.</p>

<p>When Arowaka ceased, his parent turned towards Jack and reached
out his hand.</p>

<p>"Brave Yenghese&mdash;great warrior &mdash;Hua-awa-oma love him; no
Wyandot hurt Jack&mdash;<em>no hurt people of Jack</em>!"</p>

<p>The meaning of the last remark was not fully understood by the
lad until years afterwards.  I will tell you about it later on.</p>

<p>"I am glad that Hua-awa-oma is a friend to me. I love Arowaka,
and we shall never try to hurt each other.  I will do anything
I can for Hua-awa-oma or for Arowaka."</p>

<p>And now followed such a singular proceeding, that I must take
another chapter to tell you about it. </p>
