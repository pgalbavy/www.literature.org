<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The young man shut the door with a sharper slam than any visitor
had used that afternoon, and walked up the street at a great pace,
cutting the air with his walking-stick. He was glad to find himself
outside that drawing-room, breathing raw fog, and in contact with
unpolished people who only wanted their share of the pavement
allowed them. He thought that if he had had Mr. or Mrs. or Miss
Hilbery out here he would have made them, somehow, feel his superiority,
for he was chafed by the memory of halting awkward sentences which
had failed to give even the young woman with the sad, but inwardly
ironical eyes a hint of his force. He tried to recall the actual
words of his little outburst, and unconsciously supplemented them
by so many words of greater expressiveness that the irritation
of his failure was somewhat assuaged. Sudden stabs of the unmitigated
truth assailed him now and then, for he was not inclined by nature
to take a rosy view of his conduct, but what with the beat of
his foot upon the pavement, and the glimpse which half-drawn curtains
offered him of kitchens, dining-rooms, and drawing-rooms, illustrating
with mute power different scenes from different lives, his own
experience lost its sharpness.</p>

<p>His own experience underwent a curious change. His speed slackened,
his head sank a little towards his breast, and the lamplight shone
now and again upon a face grown strangely tranquil. His thought
was so absorbing that when it became necessary to verify the name
of a street, he looked at it for a time before he read it; when
he came to a crossing, he seemed to have to reassure himself by
two or three taps, such as a blind man gives, upon the curb; and,
reaching the Underground station, he blinked in the bright circle
of light, glanced at his watch, decided that he might still indulge
himself in darkness, and walked straight on.</p>

<p>And yet the thought was the thought with which he had started.
He was still thinking about the people in the house which he had
left; but instead of remembering, with whatever accuracy he could,
their looks and sayings, he had consciously taken leave of the
literal truth. A turn of the street, a firelit room, something
monumental in the procession of the lamp-posts, who shall say
what accident of light or shape had suddenly changed the prospect
within his mind, and led him to murmur aloud:</p>

<p>"She’ll do.... Yes, Katharine Hilbery’ll do.... I’ll take Katharine
Hilbery."</p>

<p>As soon as he had said this, his pace slackened, his head fell,
his eyes became fixed. The desire to justify himself, which had
been so urgent, ceased to torment him, and, as if released from
constraint, so that they worked without friction or bidding, his
faculties leapt forward and fixed, as a matter of course, upon
the form of Katharine Hilbery. It was marvellous how much they
found to feed upon, considering the destructive nature of Denham’s
criticism in her presence. The charm, which he had tried to disown,
when under the effect of it, the beauty, the character, the aloofness,
which he had been determined not to feel, now possessed him wholly;
and when, as happened by the nature of things, he had exhausted
his memory, he went on with his imagination. He was conscious
of what he was about, for in thus dwelling upon Miss Hilbery’s
qualities, he showed a kind of method, as if he required this
vision of her for a particular purpose. He increased her height,
he darkened her hair; but physically there was not much to change
in her. His most daring liberty was taken with her mind, which,
for reasons of his own, he desired to be exalted and infallible,
and of such independence that it was only in the case of Ralph
Denham that it swerved from its high, swift flight, but where
he was concerned, though fastidious at first, she finally swooped
from her eminence to crown him with her approval. These delicious
details, however, were to be worked out in all their ramifications
at his leisure; the main point was that Katharine Hilbery would
do; she would do for weeks, perhaps for months. In taking her
he had provided himself with something the lack of which had left
a bare place in his mind for a considerable time. He gave a sigh
of satisfaction; his consciousness of his actual position somewhere
in the neighborhood of Knightsbridge returned to him, and he was
soon speeding in the train towards Highgate.</p>

<p>Although thus supported by the knowledge of his new possession
of considerable value, he was not proof against the familiar thoughts
which the suburban streets and the damp shrubs growing in front
gardens and the absurd names painted in white upon the gates of
those gardens suggested to him. His walk was uphill, and his mind
dwelt gloomily upon the house which he approached, where he would
find six or seven brothers and sisters, a widowed mother, and,
probably, some aunt or uncle sitting down to an unpleasant meal
under a very bright light. Should he put in force the threat which,
two weeks ago, some such gathering had wrung from him&mdash;the terrible
threat that if visitors came on Sunday he should dine alone in
his room? A glance in the direction of Miss Hilbery determined
him to make his stand this very night, and accordingly, having
let himself in, having verified the presence of Uncle Joseph by
means of a bowler hat and a very large umbrella, he gave his orders
to the maid, and went upstairs to his room.</p>

<p>He went up a great many flights of stairs, and he noticed, as
he had very seldom noticed, how the carpet became steadily shabbier,
until it ceased altogether, how the walls were discolored, sometimes
by cascades of damp, and sometimes by the outlines of picture-frames
since removed, how the paper flapped loose at the corners, and
a great flake of plaster had fallen from the ceiling. The room
itself was a cheerless one to return to at this inauspicious hour.
A flattened sofa would, later in the evening, become a bed; one
of the tables concealed a washing apparatus; his clothes and boots
were disagreeably mixed with books which bore the gilt of college
arms; and, for decoration, there hung upon the wall photographs
of bridges and cathedrals and large, unprepossessing groups of
insufficiently clothed young men, sitting in rows one above another
upon stone steps. There was a look of meanness and shabbiness
in the furniture and curtains, and nowhere any sign of luxury
or even of a cultivated taste, unless the cheap classics in the
book-case were a sign of an effort in that direction. The only
object that threw any light upon the character of the room’s owner
was a large perch, placed in the window to catch the air and sun,
upon which a tame and, apparently, decrepit rook hopped dryly
from side to side. The bird, encouraged by a scratch behind the
ear, settled upon Denham’s shoulder. He lit his gas-fire and settled
down in gloomy patience to await his dinner. After sitting thus
for some minutes a small girl popped her head in to say,</p>

<p>"Mother says, aren’t you coming down, Ralph? Uncle Joseph&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They’re to bring my dinner up here," said Ralph, peremptorily;
whereupon she vanished, leaving the door ajar in her haste to
be gone. After Denham had waited some minutes, in the course of
which neither he nor the rook took their eyes off the fire, he
muttered a curse, ran downstairs, intercepted the parlor-maid,
and cut himself a slice of bread and cold meat. As he did so,
the dining-room door sprang open, a voice exclaimed "Ralph!" but
Ralph paid no attention to the voice, and made off upstairs with
his plate. He set it down in a chair opposite him, and ate with
a ferocity that was due partly to anger and partly to hunger.
His mother, then, was determined not to respect his wishes; he
was a person of no importance in his own family; he was sent for
and treated as a child. He reflected, with a growing sense of
injury, that almost every one of his actions since opening the
door of his room had been won from the grasp of the family system.
By rights, he should have been sitting downstairs in the drawing-room
describing his afternoon’s adventures, or listening to the afternoon’s
adventures of other people; the room itself, the gas-fire, the
arm-chair&mdash;all had been fought for; the wretched bird, with half
its feathers out and one leg lamed by a cat, had been rescued
under protest; but what his family most resented, he reflected,
was his wish for privacy. To dine alone, or to sit alone after
dinner, was flat rebellion, to be fought with every weapon of
underhand stealth or of open appeal. Which did he dislike most&mdash;deception
or tears? But, at any rate, they could not rob him of his thoughts;
they could not make him say where he had been or whom he had seen.
That was his own affair; that, indeed, was a step entirely in
the right direction, and, lighting his pipe, and cutting up the
remains of his meal for the benefit of the rook, Ralph calmed
his rather excessive irritation and settled down to think over
his prospects.</p>

<p>This particular afternoon was a step in the right direction,
because it was part of his plan to get to know people beyond the
family circuit, just as it was part of his plan to learn German
this autumn, and to review legal books for Mr. Hilbery’s "Critical
Review." He had always made plans since he was a small boy; for
poverty, and the fact that he was the eldest son of a large family,
had given him the habit of thinking of spring and summer, autumn
and winter, as so many stages in a prolonged campaign. Although
he was still under thirty, this forecasting habit had marked two
semicircular lines above his eyebrows, which threatened, at this
moment, to crease into their wonted shapes. But instead of settling
down to think, he rose, took a small piece of cardboard marked
in large letters with the word <em>OUT, </em>and hung it upon
the handle of his door. This done, he sharpened a pencil, lit
a reading-lamp and opened his book. But still he hesitated to
take his seat. He scratched the rook, he walked to the window;
he parted the curtains, and looked down upon the city which lay,
hazily luminous, beneath him. He looked across the vapors in the
direction of Chelsea; looked fixedly for a moment, and then returned
to his chair. But the whole thickness of some learned counsel’s
treatise upon Torts did not screen him satisfactorily. Through
the pages he saw a drawing-room, very empty and spacious; he heard
low voices, he saw women’s figures, he could even smell the scent
of the cedar log which flamed in the grate. His mind relaxed its
tension, and seemed to be giving out now what it had taken in
unconsciously at the time. He could remember Mr. Fortescue’s exact
words, and the rolling emphasis with which he delivered them,
and he began to repeat what Mr. Fortescue had said, in Mr. Fortescue’s
own manner, about Manchester. His mind then began to wander about
the house, and he wondered whether there were other rooms like
the drawing-room, and he thought, inconsequently, how beautiful
the bathroom must be, and how leisurely it was&mdash;the life of these
well-kept people, who were, no doubt, still sitting in the same
room, only they had changed their clothes, and little Mr. Anning
was there, and the aunt who would mind if the glass of her father’s
picture was broken. Miss Hilbery had changed her dress ("although
she’s wearing such a pretty one," he heard her mother say), and
she was talking to Mr. Anning, who was well over forty, and bald
into the bargain, about books. How peaceful and spacious it was;
and the peace possessed him so completely that his muscles slackened,
his book drooped from his hand, and he forgot that the hour of
work was wasting minute by minute.</p>

<p>He was roused by a creak upon the stair. With a guilty start
he composed himself, frowned and looked intently at the fifty-sixth
page of his volume. A step paused outside his door, and he knew
that the person, whoever it might be, was considering the placard,
and debating whether to honor its decree or not. Certainly, policy
advised him to sit still in autocratic silence, for no custom
can take root in a family unless every breach of it is punished
severely for the first six months or so. But Ralph was conscious
of a distinct wish to be interrupted, and his disappointment was
perceptible when he heard the creaking sound rather farther down
the stairs, as if his visitor had decided to withdraw. He rose,
opened the door with unnecessary abruptness, and waited on the
landing. The person stopped simultaneously half a flight downstairs.</p>

<p>"Ralph?" said a voice, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Joan?"</p>

<p>"I was coming up, but I saw your notice."</p>

<p>"Well, come along in, then." He concealed his desire beneath
a tone as grudging as he could make it.</p>

<p>Joan came in, but she was careful to show, by standing upright
with one hand upon the mantelpiece, that she was only there for
a definite purpose, which discharged, she would go.</p>

<p>She was older than Ralph by some three or four years. Her face
was round but worn, and expressed that tolerant but anxious good
humor which is the special attribute of elder sisters in large
families. Her pleasant brown eyes resembled Ralph’s, save in expression,
for whereas he seemed to look straightly and keenly at one object,
she appeared to be in the habit of considering everything from
many different points of view. This made her appear his elder
by more years than existed in fact between them. Her gaze rested
for a moment or two upon the rook. She then said, without any
preface:</p>

<p>"It’s about Charles and Uncle John’s offer.... Mother’s been
talking to me. She says she can’t afford to pay for him after
this term. She says she’ll have to ask for an overdraft as it
is."</p>

<p>"That’s simply not true," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"No. I thought not. But she won’t believe me when I say it."</p>

<p>Ralph, as if he could foresee the length of this familiar argument,
drew up a chair for his sister and sat down himself.</p>

<p>"I’m not interrupting?" she inquired.</p>

<p>Ralph shook his head, and for a time they sat silent. The lines
curved themselves in semicircles above their eyes.</p>

<p>"She doesn’t understand that one’s got to take risks," he observed,
finally.</p>

<p>"I believe mother would take risks if she knew that Charles was
the sort of boy to profit by it."</p>

<p>"He’s got brains, hasn’t he?" said Ralph. His tone had taken
on that shade of pugnacity which suggested to his sister that
some personal grievance drove him to take the line he did. She
wondered what it might be, but at once recalled her mind, and
assented.</p>

<p>"In some ways he’s fearfully backward, though, compared with
what you were at his age. And he’s difficult at home, too. He
makes Molly slave for him."</p>

<p>Ralph made a sound which belittled this particular argument.
It was plain to Joan that she had struck one of her brother’s
perverse moods, and he was going to oppose whatever his mother
said. He called her "she," which was a proof of it. She sighed
involuntarily, and the sigh annoyed Ralph, and he exclaimed with
irritation:</p>

<p>"It’s pretty hard lines to stick a boy into an office at seventeen!"</p>

<p>"Nobody <em>WANTS </em>to stick him into an office," she said.</p>

<p>She, too, was becoming annoyed. She had spent the whole of the
afternoon discussing wearisome details of education and expense
with her mother, and she had come to her brother for help, encouraged,
rather irrationally, to expect help by the fact that he had been
out somewhere, she didn’t know and didn’t mean to ask where, all
the afternoon.</p>

<p>Ralph was fond of his sister, and her irritation made him think
how unfair it was that all these burdens should be laid on her
shoulders.</p>

<p>"The truth is," he observed gloomily, "that I ought to have accepted
Uncle John’s offer. I should have been making six hundred a year
by this time."</p>

<p>"I don’t think that for a moment," Joan replied quickly, repenting
of her annoyance. "The question, to my mind, is, whether we couldn’t
cut down our expenses in some way."</p>

<p>"A smaller house?"</p>

<p>"Fewer servants, perhaps."</p>

<p>Neither brother nor sister spoke with much conviction, and after
reflecting for a moment what these proposed reforms in a strictly
economical household meant, Ralph announced very decidedly:</p>

<p>"It’s out of the question."</p>

<p>It was out of the question that she should put any more household
work upon herself. No, the hardship must fall on him, for he was
determined that his family should have as many chances of distinguishing
themselves as other families had&mdash;as the Hilberys had, for example.
He believed secretly and rather defiantly, for it was a fact not
capable of proof, that there was something very remarkable about
his family.</p>

<p>"If mother won’t run risks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You really can’t expect her to sell out again."</p>

<p>"She ought to look upon it as an investment; but if she won’t,
we must find some other way, that’s all."</p>

<p>A threat was contained in this sentence, and Joan knew, without
asking, what the threat was. In the course of his professional
life, which now extended over six or seven years, Ralph had saved,
perhaps, three or four hundred pounds. Considering the sacrifices
he had made in order to put by this sum it always amazed Joan
to find that he used it to gamble with, buying shares and selling
them again, increasing it sometimes, sometimes diminishing it,
and always running the risk of losing every penny of it in a day’s
disaster. But although she wondered, she could not help loving
him the better for his odd combination of Spartan self-control
and what appeared to her romantic and childish folly. Ralph interested
her more than any one else in the world, and she often broke off
in the middle of one of these economic discussions, in spite of
their gravity, to consider some fresh aspect of his character.</p>

<p>"I think you’d be foolish to risk your money on poor old Charles," 
she observed. "Fond as I am of him, he doesn’t seem to me exactly
brilliant.... Besides, why should you be sacrificed?"</p>

<p>"My dear Joan," Ralph exclaimed, stretching himself out with
a gesture of impatience, "don’t you see that we’ve all got to
be sacrificed? What’s the use of denying it? What’s the use of
struggling against it? So it always has been, so it always will
be. We’ve got no money and we never shall have any money. We shall
just turn round in the mill every day of our lives until we drop
and die, worn out, as most people do, when one comes to think
of it."</p>

<p>Joan looked at him, opened her lips as if to speak, and closed
them again. Then she said, very tentatively:</p>

<p>"Aren’t you happy, Ralph?"</p>

<p>"No. Are you? Perhaps I’m as happy as most people, though. God
knows whether I’m happy or not. What is happiness?"</p>

<p>He glanced with half a smile, in spite of his gloomy irritation,
at his sister. She looked, as usual, as if she were weighing one
thing with another, and balancing them together before she made
up her mind.</p>

<p>"Happiness," she remarked at length enigmatically, rather as
if she were sampling the word, and then she paused. She paused
for a considerable space, as if she were considering happiness
in all its bearings. "Hilda was here to-day," she suddenly resumed,
as if they had never mentioned happiness. "She brought Bobbie&mdash;he’s
a fine boy now." Ralph observed, with an amusement that had a
tinge of irony in it, that she was now going to sidle away quickly
from this dangerous approach to intimacy on to topics of general
and family interest. Nevertheless, he reflected, she was the only
one of his family with whom he found it possible to discuss happiness,
although he might very well have discussed happiness with Miss
Hilbery at their first meeting. He looked critically at Joan,
and wished that she did not look so provincial or suburban in
her high green dress with the faded trimming, so patient, and
almost resigned. He began to wish to tell her about the Hilberys
in order to abuse them, for in the miniature battle which so often
rages between two quickly following impressions of life, the life
of the Hilberys was getting the better of the life of the Denhams
in his mind, and he wanted to assure himself that there was some
quality in which Joan infinitely surpassed Miss Hilbery. He should
have felt that his own sister was more original, and had greater
vitality than Miss Hilbery had; but his main impression of Katharine
now was of a person of great vitality and composure; and at the
moment he could not perceive what poor dear Joan had gained from
the fact that she was the granddaughter of a man who kept a shop,
and herself earned her own living. The infinite dreariness and
sordidness of their life oppressed him in spite of his fundamental
belief that, as a family, they were somehow remarkable.</p>

<p>"Shall you talk to mother?" Joan inquired. "Because, you see,
the thing’s got to be settled, one way or another. Charles must
write to Uncle John if he’s going there."</p>

<p>Ralph sighed impatiently.</p>

<p>"I suppose it doesn’t much matter either way," he exclaimed.
"He’s doomed to misery in the long run."</p>

<p>A slight flush came into Joan’s cheek.</p>

<p>"You know you’re talking nonsense," she said. "It doesn’t hurt
any one to have to earn their own living. I’m very glad I have
to earn mine."</p>

<p>Ralph was pleased that she should feel this, and wished her to
continue, but he went on, perversely enough.</p>

<p>"Isn’t that only because you’ve forgotten how to enjoy yourself?
You never have time for anything decent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As for instance?"</p>

<p>"Well, going for walks, or music, or books, or seeing interesting
people. You never do anything that’s really worth doing any more
than I do."</p>

<p>"I always think you could make this room much nicer, if you liked,"
she observed.</p>

<p>"What does it matter what sort of room I have when I’m forced
to spend all the best years of my life drawing up deeds in an
office?"</p>

<p>"You said two days ago that you found the law so interesting."</p>

<p>"So it is if one could afford to know anything about it."</p>

<p>("That’s Herbert only just going to bed now," Joan interposed,
as a door on the landing slammed vigorously. "And then he won’t
get up in the morning.")</p>

<p>Ralph looked at the ceiling, and shut his lips closely together.
Why, he wondered, could Joan never for one moment detach her mind
from the details of domestic life? It seemed to him that she was
getting more and more enmeshed in them, and capable of shorter
and less frequent flights into the outer world, and yet she was
only thirty-three.</p>

<p>"D’you ever pay calls now?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"I don’t often have the time. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"It might be a good thing, to get to know new people, that’s
all."</p>

<p>"Poor Ralph!" said Joan suddenly, with a smile. "You think your
sister’s getting very old and very dull&mdash;that’s it, isn’t it?"</p>

<p>"I don’t think anything of the kind," he said stoutly, but he
flushed. "But you lead a dog’s life, Joan. When you’re not working
in an office, you’re worrying over the rest of us. And I’m not
much good to you, I’m afraid."</p>

<p>Joan rose, and stood for a moment warming her hands, and, apparently,
meditating as to whether she should say anything more or not.
A feeling of great intimacy united the brother and sister, and
the semicircular lines above their eyebrows disappeared. No, there
was nothing more to be said on either side. Joan brushed her brother’s
head with her hand as she passed him, murmured good night, and
left the room. For some minutes after she had gone Ralph lay quiescent,
resting his head on his hand, but gradually his eyes filled with
thought, and the line reappeared on his brow, as the pleasant
impression of companionship and ancient sympathy waned, and he
was left to think on alone.</p>

<p>After a time he opened his book, and read on steadily, glancing
once or twice at his watch, as if he had set himself a task to
be accomplished in a certain measure of time. Now and then he
heard voices in the house, and the closing of bedroom doors, which
showed that the building, at the top of which he sat, was inhabited
in every one of its cells. When midnight struck, Ralph shut his
book, and with a candle in his hand, descended to the ground floor,
to ascertain that all lights were extinct and all doors locked.
It was a threadbare, well-worn house that he thus examined, as
if the inmates had grazed down all luxuriance and plenty to the
verge of decency; and in the night, bereft of life, bare places
and ancient blemishes were unpleasantly visible. Katharine Hilbery,
he thought, would condemn it off-hand.</p>
