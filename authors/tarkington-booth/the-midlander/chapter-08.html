<p><em>BUT </em>Lena did not respond right away. Instead, she allowed
a fortnight to elapse, during which her state of mind was one
of indecision and her continuous emotion a sharp irritation; both
of these symptoms being manifest in an interview she had with
her brother George, one day, when she finally decided to consult
him. "It’s so indecently unfair!" she complained. "It <em>is</em>
forcing me; and his letter was a perfectly abject confession of
it. He admits himself he’s compelling me to go out to that awful
place and live with him."</p>

<p>"How do you know it’s awful?" George inquired mildly. "He’s the
most likable chap I ever knew, and <em>he</em> comes from there.
Doesn’t that look as if——"</p>

<p>"No, it doesn’t. Just think of being compelled to listen to everybody
speaking with that awful Western accent! I can stand it in him
because I like his voice, and he’s only one; but imagine hearing
nothing <em>else</em>!" Lena shivered, flinging out her beautiful
little hands in a despairing gesture, illuminated by tiny stars
of fire from her rings. "Just imagine having hundreds of ’em talking
about ‘wat_urr_’ and ‘butt_urr_’ all day long!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I dare say they speak of other matters at intervals," George
said. "If that’s the supremest agony you have to face, Lena, I
don’t see why you’re kicking up such a row with yourself. I’d
rather like to go out there, myself."</p>

<p>"What in the world for?"</p>

<p>"Well, for one reason," he answered seriously, "because I like
Dan, but principally because I’d do well to get away from New
York."</p>

<p>"To live?" she cried incredulously. "I could understand that,
if you meant you’d like to get away in order to live in Paris,
but to want to go out and bury yourself in one of those awful
Western——"</p>

<p>"Paris!" George exclaimed. "For me? I suppose your idea is a
short life but a merry one!"</p>

<p>"Why not? It might be better than living to a hundred on ‘watt_urr_’
and ‘butt_urr_!’ What’s the matter with you and New York?"</p>

<p>"Nothing’s the matter with New York except that it’s got so many
sides it can be whatever one chooses to make it, so that a weak
character like me gets too many chances to increase his weaknesses
here. There’s no question about it, Lena; I’m a weak character.
I’ve proved it to myself too many times to doubt it. A smaller
city is pretty much one thing, but New York is anything because
it’s everything. The trouble is with me I’ve slid into making
a New York for myself that I can’t break away from unless I emigrate.
My New York is Uncle Nick’s offices for as few hours a day as
I can fool ’em with; and after that it’s three clubs and the Waldorf,
the Holland House, Martin’s, Jack’s, two or three roulette holes,
incidental bars, and sometimes the stage door of the Casino. The
rest of the time I live in a hansom cab. A pretty thing, isn’t
it!"</p>

<p>"Then why don’t you change it?"</p>

<p>"Because I can’t. I can’t get myself away from the crowd I’ve
picked up, and that’s the life they lead. Funny, too, I don’t
really like one of ’em, yet I can’t keep away from ’em because
I’m in the same ruts and talk the same lingo and drink the same
drinks. That’s the real trouble, I suppose, and there’s a certain
future ahead of me—a pleasant one to look forward to!"</p>

<p>"What is?"</p>

<p>"Drunken stockbroker," George replied with laconic despondency.
"That’s me, if I live to forty."</p>

<p>"I’d rather be one than buried in a mudhole on the prairie,"
said Lena. "I’d rather be anything than that; yet it’s precisely
what my thoughtful fiancé informs me I have no choice about. I
think perhaps he’ll <em>learn</em> whether I have or not, though!"</p>

<p>"Better think it over," George advised, with a thoughtful glance
at his sister’s flushed and petulant face. "It might be the best
thing for you."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"It might," he insisted. "You’ve made a pretty quick-stepping
New York of your own, Lena. Tea at Sherry’s means mighty little
tea for you, my dear. A man told me the other day he’d never met
a human being who could survive as many Benedictines in the afternoon
as you can. Besides that, you get too much music."</p>

<p>"You’re crazy!" Lena cried. "I <em>live</em> on music!"</p>

<p>"No, you don’t," he said. "You keep yourself woozy with it. You
go on music debauches, Lena. You don’t take it as an art; you
take it as an excitement. You keep your emotions frothing with
it, and that’s why you can’t get along without it. If you hadn’t
been in the habit of getting yourself woozy with music, that Venable
affair would never have happened."</p>

<p>"George!" she said sharply, and her eyes, already angry, grew
more brilliant with increased emotion. "Shame on you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well——" he said placatively.</p>

<p>"It’s a thing you have no right to make me remember."</p>

<p>"Other people remember it," he said, with a brother’s grimness.
"You needn’t think because nobody outside the family ever speaks
of it to you it isn’t thought of and referred to when you’re spoken
<em>of</em>."</p>

<p>She looked pathetic at this, and reproached him in a broken voice.
"Unmanly! One would think my own—my own brother——"</p>

<p>"Your own brother is about the only person that <em>could</em>
speak of it to you in a friendly way, Lena. You know how the rest
of the family speak of it to you—when they do."</p>

<p>"It’s so unfair!" she moaned. "Nobody ever understood——"</p>

<p>"We needn’t to go into that," George said gently. "I think myself
it was your musical emotions on top of a constitutional lack of
discretion. Oh, I don’t blame you! I’ve spent too much time trying
to cover my own indiscretions from the family. I’m really more
the family black sheep than you are, only you had worse luck;
that’s all. I only mention it to get you to think a little before
you talk of throwing Dan Oliphant over rather than to go and live
in the town he’s so proud of."</p>

<p>She wiped her eyes, choked a little, and protested feebly: "But
the two things haven’t any connection. What—what’s Venable got
to do with——"</p>

<p>"Well, you make me say it," George remarked as she paused. "I
think you understand as well as I do; but if you want me to be
definite, I will."</p>

<p>"Not <em>too</em> definite, please, George!"</p>

<p>"How can I be anything else? There isn’t any tactful way to say
some things, Lena. You may get proposals from some of these men
you meet at parties and father don’t know about——"</p>

<p>"Never mind, please, George. Do you have to be quite so——"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said decisively. "Quite. The family have made it clear
what they’ll do, if you ever try again to marry one of the wrong
sort, like Venable."</p>

<p>"‘The wrong sort!’" she echoed pathetically, though with some
bitterness toward her brother. "He was the most interesting man
I ever knew, and a great artist. He was——"</p>

<p>"Unfortunate in his domestic experiences," George interrupted,
concluding the sentence for her dryly. "And you were unfortunate
in overlooking—well, to put it tactlessly, in seeming to have
no objection to what I’m afraid I must call his somewhat bigamous
tendencies, Lena."</p>

<p>"George!"</p>

<p>"My dear, I’m trying to say something helpful. Eligibles of our
own walk in life enjoy dancing with you or buying Benedictines
for you, but after Venable, none of ’em would be likely to——"</p>

<p>"That’s enough, please, George!"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I’m explaining that Dan’s the best thing in sight.
The family weren’t too pleased about him, I admit; but they couldn’t
help seeing that. For my part, I think it might be the making
of you."</p>

<p>"I don’t care to be made, thanks."</p>

<p>"I mean you might have a chance to improve, living somewhere
else," he explained calmly. "But more than that, Dan Oliphant
looks up to you so worshipfully—he pictures you as such spotless
perfection—it seems to me you’d just have to live up to his idea
of you. If you want to know the truth, I took such a fancy to
him I wasn’t too delighted on his account when I saw he was getting
serious about you; but when he seemed to be so much so, I thought
maybe it might turn out pretty well for both of you. It’s good
sometimes for a man to have such ideals, and it’s always good
for a woman to live up to ’em. Besides, you do care about him,
don’t you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "I wouldn’t have said I’d marry him if I didn’t.
I really did fall a lot in love with him, but that’s not being
in love with spending my life in some terrible <em>place</em>,
is it? And besides I’m not going to live up to his ideals; nothing
bores me more than pretending to be somebody I’m not. I get enough
of that with the family, thanks!"</p>

<p>"You think you won’t try to be the girl he believes you are?"
George asked gravely.</p>

<p>"Don’t be silly! Why on earth should I pretend to be anybody
but myself?"</p>

<p>"In that case," George said, "I hope you’ll write poor Dan that
you refuse to be compelled and have decided to break your engagement.
He’ll be pretty sick over it, I’m afraid, but I think you’d both
live happier—and longer!"</p>

<p>With this brotherly tribute, spoken in a rueful humour, he departed,
leaving her at her small French desk, where the sheet of blue-tinted
note paper before her remained blank, except for a few teardrops.
In spite of his parting advice, George had relieved neither her
indecision nor her conviction that she was being ill-treated by
her lover. Nevertheless, except for one thing, she was inclined
to accept that advice.</p>

<p>The one deterrent was the group of people defined by George and
herself, in tones never enthusiastic, as "the family." Aunts,
uncles, and cousins were included, all of them persons of weight,
and some of them of such prodigious substance in wealth as to
figure as personages in the metropolis; though all McMillans were
personages to themselves, on the score of what they believed to
be clan greatness due to historical descent and hereditary merit.
To their view, New York was a conglomerate background for the
McMillans and a not extensive additional gentry, principally English
and Dutch in origin. Beyond the conglomerate background, the McMillans
permitted themselves to be aware of certain foreigners as gentry,
and also of some flavourings of gentry, similar to their own,
in Philadelphia, Boston, and one or two smaller cities, but there
perfected civilization ended. All else they believed to be a kind
of climbing barbarism, able to show forth talent or power, perhaps,
in a spasmodic way, or even isolated greatness, as in Abraham
Lincoln, but never gentry, except in imitations laughably pinchbeck.</p>

<p>To the McMillan view, Lena’s adventure with that dashing sculpture,
half genius and half Grecian-shaped meat, Perry Venable, had placed
her gentryship in jeopardy, damaged her as a McMillan;—in fact,
her infatuation for so conspicuous a baritone could not avoid
being itself conspicuous; it "made talk," and in answer to the
talk she had announced her engagement to him. Then, in the face
of the family’s formidable opposition, she made preparations for
a clandestine wedding, which Mr. Venable was unable to attend
on account of his wife’s arrival from Poland. Thereupon, standing
alone against the shock of heavy McMillan explosives, Lena’s impulsive
loyalty in defending the godlike baritone led her to make an unfortunate
statement: great artists were not to be bound by the ordinary
fetters upon conduct, she said;—and this prelude not being accepted
as of any great force and originality, she followed it hotly with
the declaration that she had long been aware of the Polish lady’s
existence.</p>

<p>It was in great part to this admission of hers that the unwitting
Dan Oliphant owed the family’s consent to his suit for the hand
of a McMillan. A McMillan who got herself talked about, and then
confessed, not in the manner of confession but with anger, that
she had not been deceived—such a McMillan would conceivably do
such a thing again, and a respectable barbarian bridegroom might
be the best substitute for those unfortunately obsolete family
resources in times of youthful revolt, <em>lettres de cachet</em>
and the enforced taking of veils. But, in good truth, Dan may
have owed to Lena’s celebrated admission more than the family’s
consent, for the family’s austerity of manner toward Lena became
so protracted an oppression that she was the readier to be pleased
with anything as cheerfully different from that family as Dan
was.</p>

<p>Without doubt, too, he owed it to this McMillan austerity that
she did not write to him now and break her engagement with him.
The Venable affair was two years past, but the austerity went
on, unabated. Dan was at least an avenue of escape, and, as Lena
had said to her brother, she was "a lot in love" with him. Yet
she hesitated, angry with him because he could not offer what
she wanted, and half convinced that escape from what she hated
might be an escape into what she would hate more. So she wrote
to him finally:</p>

<p>
You said you loved me! That isn’t quite easy to believe just<br/>
now. Why did you let me go on counting upon our having a year<br/>
abroad? I’m afraid I’ll never be able to understand it. I don’t<br/>
know what to say or what to do. I think the best thing you could<br/>
do would be to come East at once. Maybe I could understand<br/>
better if we talked it over together. It seems to me that you<br/>
couldn’t have cared for me with any depth or you wouldn’t have<br/>
allowed things to be as you say they are. A man can always do<br/>
anything he really wants to, and if you had <em>really</em> wanted—oh,<br/>
I know it’s futile to be writing of <em>that</em>! You simply didn’t<br/>
care enough, and I thought you did! The only thing for you to do<br/>
is to come at once. We must settle what’s to be done, because I<br/>
can’t go on in the state of unhappiness I’ve suffered since your<br/>
last letter. Maybe you can convince me that you do care a little<br/>
in spite of having forced me to give up what I counted on. If<br/>
you do convince me, I suppose there’s no use putting off<br/>
things—I don’t want a large, fussy wedding. If we <em>are</em> going<br/>
ahead with it, we might as well get it over. I don’t know what<br/>
to do, I admit that; but I’m still
