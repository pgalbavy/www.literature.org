"<em>My Friend:__</em><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will know all when you get this. Nothing that I can say will<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move Bella. She has gone out to give herself up. I am tired out<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with struggling.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will know now that I deceived you, that where you gave me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trust I repaid you with lies. It will seem, perhaps, indefensible<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to you, but I should like, before I go out of your life for ever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to show you just how it all came about. If I knew that you forgave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, it would make life easier for me. It wasn’t for myself I did<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it—that’s the only thing I can put forward to say for myself.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I’ll begin from the day I met you in the boat train from Paris. I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was uneasy then about Bella. She was just desperate about Jack<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renauld, she’d have lain down on the ground for him to walk on, and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he began to change, and to stop writing so often, she began<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;getting in a state. She got it into her head that he was keen on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another girl—and of course, as it turned out afterwards, she was<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quite right there. She’d made up her mind to go to their Villa at<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlinville, and try and see Jack. She knew I was against it, and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tried to give me the slip. I found she was not on the train at<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calais, and determined I would not go on to England without her.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’d an uneasy feeling that something awful was going to happen if I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;couldn’t prevent it.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I met the next train from Paris. She was on it, and set upon going<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out then and there to Merlinville. I argued with her for all I was<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worth, but it wasn’t any good. She was all strung up and set upon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having her own way. Well, I washed my hands of it. I’d done all I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could! It was getting late. I went to an hotel, and Bella started<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Merlinville. I still couldn’t shake off my feeling of what the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;books call ‘impending disaster.’<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next day came—but no Bella. She’d made a date with me to meet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the hotel, but she didn’t keep it. No sign of her all day. I got<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more and more anxious. Then came an evening paper with the news.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was awful! I couldn’t be sure, of course—but I was terribly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afraid. I figured it out that Bella had met Papa Renauld and told<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him about her and Jack, and that he’d insulted her or something<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like that. We’ve both got terribly quick tempers.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then all the masked foreigner business came out, and I began to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feel more at ease. But it still worried me that Bella hadn’t kept<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her date with me.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By the next morning, I was so rattled that I’d just got to go and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see what I could. First thing, I ran up against you. You know all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that … When I saw the dead man, looking so like Jack, and wearing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack’s fancy overcoat, I knew! And there was the identical<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paper-knife—wicked little thing!—that Jack had given Bella! Ten to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one it had her finger-marks on it. I can’t hope to explain to you<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sort of helpless horror of that moment. I only saw one thing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clearly—I must get hold of that dagger, and get right away with it<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before they found out it was gone. I pretended to faint, and whilst<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you were away getting water I took the thing and hid it away in my<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dress.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I told you that I was staying at the Hôtel du Phare, but of course<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;really I made a bee line back to Calais, and then on to England by<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the first boat. When we were in mid-Channel, I dropped that little<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devil of a dagger into the sea. Then I felt I could breathe again.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bella was at our digs in London. She looked like nothing on God’s<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth. I told her what I’d done, and that she was pretty safe for<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the time being. She stared at me, and then began laughing …<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laughing … laughing … it was horrible to hear her! I felt that the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;best thing to do was to keep busy. She’d go mad if she had time to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brood on what she’d done. Luckily we got an engagement at once.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then, I saw you and your friend, watching us that night … I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was frantic. You must suspect, or you wouldn’t have tracked us<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down. I had to know the worst, so I followed you. I was desperate.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, before I’d had time to say anything, I tumbled to it that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it was <em>me__</em> you suspected, not Bella! Or at least that you<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thought I <em>was__</em> Bella since I’d stolen the dagger.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish, honey, that you could see back into my mind at that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moment … you’d forgive me, perhaps … I was so frightened, and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;muddled, and desperate. … All I could get clearly was that you<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would try and save me. I didn’t know whether you’d be willing to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save her … I thought very likely not—it wasn’t the same thing! And<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn’t risk it! Bella’s my twin—I’d got to do the best for her.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I went on lying. … I felt mean—I feel mean still. … That’s<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all—enough too, you’ll say, I expect. I ought to have trusted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you. … If I had—<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As soon as the news was in the paper that Jack Renauld had been<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arrested, it was all up. Bella wouldn’t even wait to see how things<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went. …<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I’m very tired. … I can’t write any more. …"

<p>She had begun to sign herself Cinderella, but had crossed that
out and written instead "Dulcie Duveen."</p>

<p>It was an ill-written, blurred epistle but I have kept it to
this day.</p>

<p>Poirot was with me when I read it. The sheets fell from my hand,
and I looked across at him.</p>

<p>"Did you know all the time that it was—the other?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my friend."</p>

<p>"Why did you not tell me?"</p>

<p>"To begin with, I could hardly believe it conceivable that you
could make such a mistake. You had seen the photograph. The sisters
are very alike, but by no means incapable of distinguishment."</p>

<p>"But the fair hair?"</p>

<p>"A wig, worn for the sake of a piquant contrast on the stage.
Is it conceivable that with twins one should be fair and one dark?"</p>

<p>"Why didn’t you tell me that night at the hotel in Coventry?"</p>

<p>"You were rather high-handed in your methods, <em>mon ami__</em>,"
said Poirot dryly. "You did not give me a chance."</p>

<p>"But afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Ah, afterwards! Well, to begin with, I was hurt at your want
of faith in me. And then, I wanted to see whether your—feelings
would stand the test of time. In fact, whether it was love, or
a flash in the pan, with you. I should not have left you long
in your error."</p>

<p>I nodded. His tone was too affectionate for me to bear resentment.
I looked down on the sheets of the letter. Suddenly I picked them
up from the floor, and pushed them across to him.</p>

<p>"Read that," I said. "I’d like you to."</p>

<p>He read it through in silence, then he looked up at me.</p>

<p>"What is it that worries you, Hastings?"</p>

<p>This was quite a new mood in Poirot. His mocking manner seemed
laid quite aside. I was able to say what I wanted without too
much difficulty.</p>

<p>"She doesn’t say—she doesn’t say—well, not whether she cares
for me or not!"</p>

<p>Poirot turned back the pages.</p>

<p>"I think you are mistaken, Hastings."</p>

<p>"Where?" I cried, leaning forward eagerly.</p>

<p>Poirot smiled.</p>

<p>"She tells you that in every line of the letter, <em>mon ami__</em>."</p>

<p>"But where am I to find her? There’s no address on the letter.
There’s a French stamp, that’s all."</p>

<p>"Excite yourself not! Leave it to Papa Poirot. I can find her
for you as soon as I have five little minutes!"</p>
