<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>They went together in a double chair, spinning noiselessly over
the shell road which wound through oleander and hibiscus hedges.
Great orange and sulphur-tinted butterflies kept pace with them
as they travelled swiftly southward; the long, slim shadows of
palms gridironed the sunny road, for the sun was in the west,
and already a bird here and there had ventured on a note or two
as prelude to the evening song, and over the ocean wild ducks
were rising in clouds, swinging and drifting and settling again
as though in short rehearsal for their sunset flight.</p>

<p>"Your hostess is Mrs. Tom O'Hara," said the girl; "when you have
enough of it look at me and I'll understand. And if you try to
hide in a corner with some soulful girl I'll look at you&mdash;if it
bores me too much. So don't sit still with an infatuated smile,
as Cecile does, when she sees that I wish to make my adieux."</p>

<p>"I'm so likely to," he said, "when escape means that I'll have
you to myself again."</p>

<p>There was a trifle more significance in the unconsidered speech
than he had intended. The girl looked absently straight in front
of her; he sat motionless, uncomfortable at his own words, but
too wise to attempt to modify them by more words.</p>

<p>Other chairs passed them now along the road&mdash;there were nods
of recognition, gay salutes, an intimate word or two as the light-wheeled
vehicles flashed past; and in a moment more the tall coquina gate
posts and iron grille of Mrs. Tom O'Hara's villa, Tsana Lahni,
glimmered under an avenue of superb royal palms.</p>

<p>The avenue was crowded with the slender-wheeled basket-bodied
chairs gay with the plumage of pretty women; the scene on the
lawns beyond was charming where an orange and white pavilion was
pitched against the intense green of the foliage, and the pelouse
was all dotted and streaked with vivid colours of sunshades and
gowns.</p>

<p>"Ulysses among the sirens," she whispered as they made their
way toward their hostess, exchanging recognition with people everywhere
in the throngs. "Here they are&mdash;all of them&mdash;and there's Miss
Suydam,&mdash;too unconscious of us. How hath the House of Hamil fallen!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you talk that way I won't leave you for one second while
we're here!" he said under his breath.</p>

<p>"Nonsense; it only hurts me, not my pride. And half a cup of
unforbidden tea will drown the memory of that insolence&mdash;"</p>

<p>She bent forward with smiling composure to shake hands with Mrs.
Tom O'Hara, a tall, olive-tinted, black-haired beauty; presented
Hamil to his hostess, and left him planted, to exchange impulsive
amenities with little Mrs. Ascott.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tom O'Hara, a delicate living Gainsborough in black and
white, was probably the handsomest woman in the South. She dressed
with that perfection of simplicity which only a few can afford;
she wore only a single jewel at a time, but the gem was always
matchless.</p>

<p>Warm-hearted, generous, and restless, she loved the character
of Lady Bountiful; and, naïvely convinced of her own unassailable
supremacy, played very picturesquely the rôle of graciousness
and patronage to the tenants of her great estates and of her social
and intellectual world alike. Hence, although she went where many
of her less fashionable guests might not have been asked to go,
she herself paid self-confident homage to intellect as she understood
it, and in her own house her entourage was as mixed as her notions
of a "salon" permitted.</p>

<p>She was gracious to Hamil on account of his aunt, his profession,
and himself. Also her instinct was to be nice to everybody. As
hostess she had but a moment to accord him, but during that moment
she contrived to speak reassuringly of the Suydam genealogy, the
art of landscape architecture, and impart a little special knowledge
from her inexhaustible reserve, informing him that the name of
her villa, Tsa-na Lah-ni, was Seminole, and meant "Yellow Butterfly."
And then she passed him sweetly along into a crush of bright-eyed
young things who attempted to pour tea into him and be agreeable
in various artless ways; and presently he found himself in a back-water
where fashion and intellect were conscientiously doing their best
to mix. But the mixture was a thin solution&mdash;thinner than Swizzles
and Caravan, and the experience of the very young girl beside
him who talked herself out in thirty seconds from pure nervousness
and remained eternally grateful to him for giving her a kindly
opportunity to escape to cover among the feather-brained and frivolous.</p>

<p>Then, close to him, a girl spoke of the "purple perfume of petunias,"
and a man used the phrases, "body politic," and "the gaiety of
nations."</p>

<p>So he knew he was among the elect, redundant, and truly precious.
A chinless young man turned to him and said:</p>

<p>"There is nobody to-day who writes as Bernard Haw writes."</p>

<p>"Does anybody want to?" asked Hamil pleasantly.</p>

<p>"You mean that this is an age of trumpery romance?" demanded
a heavy gentleman in dull disdain. "William Dean has erased all
romance from modern life with one smear of his honest thumb!"</p>

<p>"The honest thumb that persistently and patiently rubs the scales
from sapphire and golden wings in order to be certain that the
vination of the Ornithoptera is still underneath, is not the digit
of inspiration," suggested Hamil.</p>

<p>The disciple turned a dull brick-colour; but he betrayed neither
his master nor himself.</p>

<p>"What, in God's name," he asked heavily, "is an ornithoptera?"</p>

<p>A very thin author, who had been listening and twisting himself
into a number of shapes, thrust his neck forward into the arena
and considered Hamil with the pale grimace of challenge.</p>

<p>"Henry Haynes?" he inquired&mdash;"your appreciation in one phrase,
Mr. Hamil."</p>

<p>"In a Henry Haynes phrase?" asked Hamil good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"The same old calumny?" said the thin author, writhing almost
off his chair.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so; and the remedy a daily dose of verbifuge&mdash;until
he gets back to the suffocated fount of inspiration. I am very
sorry if I seem to differ from everybody, but everybody seems
to differ from me, so I can't help it."</p>

<p>A Swami, unctuous and fat, and furious at the lack of feminine
attention, said something suavely outrageous about modern women.
He was immediately surrounded by several mature examples who adored
to be safely smitten by the gelatinous and esoteric.</p>

<p>A little flabby, featureless, but very fashionable portrait painter
muttered to Hamil: "Orient and Occident! the molluskular and the
muscular. Mr. Hamil, do you realise <em>what</em> the Occident
is?"</p>

<p>"Geographically?" inquired Hamil wearily.</p>

<p>"No, symbolically. It is that!" explained the painter, doubling
his meagre biceps and punching at the infinite, with a flattened
thumb. "That," he repeated, "is America. Do you comprehend?"</p>

<p>The wan young girl who had spoken of the purple perfume of petunias
said that <em>she</em> understood. It may be that she did; she
reviewed literature for the <em>Tribune</em>.</p>

<p>Harried and restless, Hamil looked for Shiela and saw Portlaw,
very hot and uncomfortable in his best raiment, shooting his cuffs
and looking dully about for some avenue of escape; and Hamil,
exasperated with purple perfumes and thumbs, meanly snared him
and left him to confront a rather ample and demonstrative young
girl who believed that all human thought was precious&mdash;even sinful
thought&mdash;of which she knew as much as a newly hatched caterpillar.
However, Portlaw was able to enlighten her if he cared to.</p>

<p>Again and again Hamil, wandering in circles, looked across the
wilderness of women's hats at Shiela Cardross, but a dozen men
surrounded her, and among them he noticed the graceful figure
of Malcourt directly in front of her, blocking any signal he might
have given.</p>

<p>Somebody was saying something about Mrs. Ascott. He recollected
that he hadn't met her; so he found somebody to present him.</p>

<p>"And <em>you</em> are the man?" exclaimed Mrs. Ascott softly,
considering him with her head on one side. "Shiela Cardross wrote
to me in New York about you, but I've wanted to inspect you for
my own information."</p>

<p>"Are you doing it now?" he asked, amused.</p>

<p>"It's done! Do you imagine you are complex? I've heard various
tales about you from three sources, to-day; from an old friend,
Louis Malcourt&mdash;from another, Virginia Suydam&mdash;and steadily during
the last month&mdash;including to-day&mdash;from Shiela Cardross. But I
couldn't find a true verdict until the accused appeared personally
before me. Tell me, Mr. Hamil, do you plead guilty to being as
amiable as the somewhat contradictory evidence indicates?"</p>

<p>"Parole me in custody of this court and let me convince your
Honor," said Hamil, looking into the captivatingly cool and humourous
face upturned to his.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ascott was small, and finely moulded; something of the miniature
grande dame in porcelain. The poise of her head, the lifted chin,
every detail in the polished and delicately tinted surface reflected
cool experience of the world and of men. Yet the eyes were young,
and there was no hardness in them, and the mouth seemed curiously
unfashioned for worldly badinage&mdash;a very wistful, full-lipped
mouth that must have been disciplined in some sad school to lose
its cheerfulness in repose.</p>

<p>"I am wondering," she said, "why Mr. Portlaw does not come and
talk to me. We are neighbors in the country, you know; I live
at Pride's Fall. I don't think it's particularly civil of him
to avoid me."</p>

<p>"I can't imagine anybody, including Portlaw, avoiding you," he
said.</p>

<p>"We were such good friends &mdash;I don't know&mdash;he behaved very
badly to me last autumn."</p>

<p>They chatted together for a moment or two in the same inconsequential
vein, then, other people being presented, she nodded an amiable
dismissal; and, as he stepped aside, held out her hand.</p>

<p>"There are a lot of things I'd like to ask you some day; one
is about a park for me at Pride's Fall&mdash;oh, the tiniest sort of
a park, only it should be quite formal in all its miniature details.
Will you let Shiela bring you for a little conference? <em>Soon</em>?"</p>

<p>He promised and took his leave, elated at the chances of a new
commission, hunting through the constantly arriving and departing
throngs for Shiela. And presently he encountered his aunt.</p>

<p>"You certainly do neglect me," she said with her engaging and
care-free laugh. "Where have you been for a week?"</p>

<p>"In the flat-woods. And, by the way, don't worry about any snakes.
Virginia said you were anxious."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said his aunt, amused, "Virginia is trying to plague
you! I said nothing about snakes to her."</p>

<p>"Didn't you say there were snakes in my district?"</p>

<p>"No. I <em>did</em> say there were <em>girls</em> in your district,
but it didn't worry me."</p>

<p>His face was so serious that the smile died out on her own.</p>

<p>"Why, Garret," she said, "surely you are not offended, are you?"</p>

<p>"Not with you &mdash;Virginia has apparently taken her cue from
that unspeakable Mrs. Van Dieman, and is acting like the deuce
toward Shiela Cardross. Couldn't you find an opportunity to discourage
that sort of behaviour? It's astonishingly underbred."</p>

<p>His aunt's eyelids flickered as she regarded him.</p>

<p>"Come to see me to-night and explain a little more fully what
Virginia has done, dear. Colonel Vetchen is hunting for me and
I'm going to let him find me now. Why don't you come back with
us if you are not looking for anybody in particular."</p>

<p>"I'm looking for Shiela Cardross," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's over there on the terrace holding her fascinating
court&mdash;with Louis Malcourt at her heels as usual."</p>

<p>"I didn't know that Malcourt was usually at her heels," he said
almost irritably. It was the second time he had heard that comment,
and he found it unaccountably distasteful.</p>

<p>His aunt looked up, smiling.</p>

<p>"Can't we dine together, Garry?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear"&mdash;faintly ironical. "So now if you'll go I'll
reveal myself to Gussie Vetchen. Stand aside, my condescending
friend."</p>

<p>He said, smiling: "You're the prettiest revelation here. I'll
be at the hotel at eight."</p>

<p>And with that they parted just as the happy little Vetchen, catching
sight of them, came bustling up with all the fuss and demonstration
of a long-lost terrier.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Hamil found Shiela Cardross surrounded by
her inevitable entourage&mdash;a jolly, animated circle hemming her
in with Malcourt at her left and Van Tassel Cuyp on her right;
and he halted on the circle's edge to look and listen, glancing
askance at Malcourt with a curiosity unaccustomed.</p>

<p>That young man with his well-made graceful figure, his dark hair
and vivid tints, had never particularly impressed Hamil. He had
accepted him at his face value, lacking the interest to appraise
him; and the acquaintance had always been as casual and agreeable
as mutual good-humour permitted. But now Malcourt, as a type,
attracted his attention; and for a moment he contrasted this rather
florid example with the specimens of young men around him. Then
he looked at Shiela Cardross. Her delicately noble head was bent
a trifle as she listened with the others to Malcourt's fluent
humour; and it remained so, though at moments she lifted her eyes
in that straight, questioning gaze which left the brows level.</p>

<p>And now she was replying to Malcourt; and Hamil watched her and
listened to her with newer interest, noting the poise, the subtle
reserve under the gayest provocation of badinage&mdash;the melody of
her rare laughter, the unaffected sweetness of her voice, and
its satisfying sincerity&mdash;satisfying as the clear regard from
her lifted eyes.</p>

<p>Small wonder men were attracted; Hamil could understand what
drew them&mdash;the instinctive recognition of a fibre finer and a
metal purer than was often found under the surface of such loveliness.</p>

<p>And now, as he watched her, the merriment broke out again around
her, and she laughed, lifting her face to his in all its youthfully
bewildering beauty, and saw him standing near her for the first
time.</p>

<p>Without apparent reason a dull colour rose to his face; and,
as though answering fire with fire, her fainter signal in response
tinted lip and cheek.</p>

<p>It was scarcely the signal agreed upon for their departure; and
for a moment longer, amid the laughing tumult, she sat looking
at him as though confused. Malcourt bent forward saying something
to her, but she rose while he was speaking, as though she had
not heard him; and Hamil walked through the circle to where she
stood. A number of very young men looked around at him with hostile
eyes; Malcourt's brows lifted a trifle; then he shot an ironical
glance at Shiela and, as the circle about her disintegrated, sauntered
up, bland, debonair, to accept his congé.</p>

<p>His bow, a shade exaggerated, and the narrowed mockery of his
eyes escaped her; and even what he said made no impression as
she stood, brightly inattentive, looking across the little throng
at Hamil. And Malcourt's smile became flickering and uncertain
when she left the terrace with Hamil, moving very slowly side
by side across the lawn.</p>

<p>"Such lots of pretty women," commented Shiela. "Have you been
passably amused?"</p>

<p>"Passably," he replied in a slightly sullen tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, only passably? I rather hoped that unawakened heart of yours
might be aroused to-day."</p>

<p>"It has been."</p>

<p>"<em>Not</em> Mrs. Ascott!" she exclaimed, halting.</p>

<p>"Not Mrs. Ascott."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tom O'Hara! Is it? Every man promptly goes to smash when
Mrs. Tom looks sideways."</p>

<p>"O Lord!" he said with a shrug.</p>

<p>"That is not nice of you, Mr. Hamil. If it is not with her you
have fallen in love there is a more civil way of denying it."</p>

<p>"Did you take what I said seriously?" he asked&mdash;"about falling
in love?"</p>

<p>"Were you not serious?"</p>

<p>"I could be if you were," he said in a tone which slightly startled
her. She looked up at him questioningly; he said:</p>

<p>"I've had a stupid time without you. The little I've seen of
you has spoiled other women for me. And I've just found it out.
Do you mind my saying so?"</p>

<p>"Are you not a little over-emphatic in your loyalty to me? I
like it, but not at the expense of others, please."</p>

<p>They moved on together, slowly and in step. His head was bent,
face sullen and uncomfortably flushed. Again she felt the curiously
unaccountable glow in her own cheeks responding in pink fire once
more; and annoyed and confused she halted and looked up at him
with that frank confidence characteristic of her.</p>

<p>"Something has gone wrong," she said. "Tell me."</p>

<p>"I will. I'm telling myself now." She laughed, stole a glance
at him, then her face fell.</p>

<p>"I certainly don't know what you mean, and I'm not very sure
that you know."</p>

<p>She was right; he did not yet know. Strange, swift pulses were
beating in temple and throat; strange tumults and confusion were
threatening his common sense, paralyzing will-power. A slow, resistless
intoxication had enveloped him, through which instinctively persisted
one warning ray of reason. In the light of that single ray he
strove to think clearly. They walked to the pavilion together,
he silent, sombre-eyed, taking a mechanical leave of his hostess,
fulfilling conventions while scarcely aware of the routine or
of the people around him; she composed, sweet, conventionally
faultless&mdash;and a trifle pale as they turned away together across
the lawn.</p>

<p>When they took their places side by side in the chair she was
saying something perfunctory concerning the fête and Mrs. Ascott.
And as he offered no comment: "Don't you think her very charming
and sincere.... Are you listening to me, Mr. Hamil?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Everybody was very jolly. Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;the girl who adores the purple perfume of petunias?" she
asked mischievously. "I think that same purple perfume has made
you drowsy, my uncivil friend."</p>

<p>He turned. "Oh, you heard <em>that</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I thought it best to keep a sisterly eye on you."</p>

<p>He forced a smile.</p>

<p>"You were very much amused, I suppose&mdash;to see me sitting bras-dessus-bras-dessous
with the high-browed and precious."</p>

<p>"Not amused; no. I was worried; you appeared to be so hopelessly
captivated by her of the purple perfumery. Still, knowing you
to be a man normally innocent of sentiment, I hoped for Mrs. Ascott
and the best."</p>

<p>"Did I once tell you that there was no sentiment in me, Calypso?
I believe I did."</p>

<p>"You certainly did, brother," she replied with cheerful satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Well, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>" &mdash;And," she interrupted calmly, "I believed you. I am
particularly happy now in believing you." A pause&mdash;and she glanced
at him. "In fact, speaking seriously, it is the nicest thing about
you&mdash;the most attractive to me, I think." She looked sideways
at him, "Because, there is no more sentiment in me than there
is in you.... Which is, of course, very agreeable&mdash;to us both."</p>

<p>He said nothing more; the chair sped on homeward. Above them
the sky was salmon-colour; patches of late sunlight burned red
on the tree trunks; over the lagoon against the slowly kindling
west clouds of wild-fowl whirled, swung, and spread out into endless
lengthening streaks like drifting bands of smoke.</p>

<p>From time to time the girl cast a furtive glance toward him;
but he was looking straight ahead with a darkly set face; and
an ache, dull, scarcely perceptible, grew in her heart as they
flew on along the glimmering road.</p>

<p>"Of what are you thinking, brother?" she asked persuasively.</p>

<p>"Of something I am going to do; as soon as I reach home; I mean
<em>your</em> home."</p>

<p>"I wish it were yours, too," she said, smiling frankly; "you
are such a safe, sound, satisfactory substitute for another brother."
... And as he made no response: "What is this thing which you
are going to do when you reach home?"</p>

<p>"I am going to ask your mother a question."</p>

<p>Unquiet she turned toward him, but his face was doggedly set
forward as the chair circled through the gates and swept up to
the terrace.</p>

<p>He sprang out; and as he aided her to descend she felt his hand
trembling under hers. A blind thrill of premonition halted her;
then she bit her lip, turned, and mounted the steps with him.
At the door he stood aside for her to pass; but again she paused
and turned to Hamil, irresolute, confused, not even daring to
analyse what sheer instinct was clamouring; what intuition was
reading even now in his face, what her ears divined in his unsteady
voice uttering some commonplace to thank her for the day spent
with him.</p>

<p>"What is it that you are going to say to my mother?" she asked
again.</p>

<p>And at the same instant she knew from his eyes&mdash;gazing into them
in dread and dismay.</p>

<p>"Don't!" she said breathlessly; "I cannot let&mdash;" The mounting
wave of colour swept her: "Don't go to her!&mdash;don't ask such a&mdash;a
thing. I am&mdash;"</p>

<p>She faltered, looking up at him with terrified eyes, and laid
one hand on his arm.</p>

<p>The frightened wordless appeal stunned him as they stood there,
confronting one another. Suddenly hope came surging up within
her; her hand fell from his arm; she lifted her eyes in flushed
silence&mdash;only to find hopeless confirmation of all she dreaded
in his set and colourless face.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hamil," she said tremulously, "I never dreamed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you didn't. I did. It is all right, Shiela."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I &mdash;I never, never dreamed of it!"&mdash;shocked and pitifully
incredulous still.</p>

<p>"I know you didn't. Don't worry." His voice was very gentle,
but he was not looking at her.</p>

<p>"Is it my&mdash;fault, Mr. Hamil?"</p>

<p>"Your fault?" he repeated, surprised. "What have <em>you</em>
done?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't know."</p>

<p>He stood gazing absently out into the flaming west; and, speaking
as though unaware: "From the first &mdash;I realise it now&mdash;even
from the first moment when you sprang into my life out of the
fog and the sea &mdash;Shiela! Shiela! &mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't!" she whispered, "don't say it." She swayed back against
the wall; her hand covered her eyes an instant&mdash;and dropped helpless,
hopeless.</p>

<p>They faced each other.</p>

<p>"Believe that I am&mdash;sorry," she whispered. "Will you believe
it? I did not know; I did not dream of it."</p>

<p>His face changed as though something within him was being darkly
aroused.</p>

<p>"After all," he said, "no man ever lived who could kill hope."</p>

<p>"There is no hope to kill&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No chance, Shiela?"</p>

<p>"There has never been any chance&mdash;" She was trembling; he took
both her hands. They were ice cold.</p>

<p>He straightened up, squaring his shoulders. "This won't do,"
he said. "I'm not going to distress you&mdash;frighten you again."
The smile he forced was certainly a credit to him.</p>

<p>"Shiela, you'd love me if you could, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes," with a shiver.</p>

<p>"Then it's all right and you mustn't worry.... Can't we get back
to the old footing again?"</p>

<p>"N-no; it's gone."</p>

<p>"Then we'll find even firmer ground."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;firmer ground, Mr. Hamil."</p>

<p>He released her chilled hands, swung around, and took a thoughtful
step or two.</p>

<p>"Firmer, safer ground," he repeated. "Once you said to me, 'Let
us each enjoy our own griefs unmolested.'" He laughed. "Didn't
you say that&mdash;years ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And I replied&mdash;years ago&mdash;that I had no griefs to enjoy. Didn't
I? Well, then, if this is grief, Shiela, I wouldn't exchange it
for another man's happiness. So, if you please, I'll follow your
advice and enjoy it in my own fashion.... Shiela, you don't smile
very often, but I wish you would now."</p>

<p>But the ghost of a smile left her pallor unchanged. She moved
toward the stairs, wearily, stopped and turned.</p>

<p>"It cannot end this way," she said; "I want you to know how&mdash;to
know&mdash;to know that <em>I&mdash;</em>am&mdash;sensible of w-what honour you
have done me. Wait! I &mdash;I can't let you think that <em>I&mdash;</em>do
not&mdash;care, Mr. Hamil. Believe that I do!&mdash;oh, deeply. And forgive
me&mdash;" She stretched out one hand. He took it, holding it between
both of his for a moment, lightly.</p>

<p>"Is all clear between us, Calypso dear?"</p>

<p>"It will be&mdash;when I have courage to tell you."</p>

<p>"Then all's well with the world&mdash;if it's still under-foot&mdash;or
somewhere in the vicinity. I'll find it again; you'll be good
enough to point it out to me, Shiela.... I've an engagement to
improve a few square miles of it.... That's what I need&mdash;plenty
of work&mdash;don't I, Shiela?"</p>

<p>The clear mellow horn of a motor sounded from the twilit lawn;
the others were arriving. He dropped her hand; she gathered her
filmy skirts and swiftly mounted the great stairs, leaving him
to greet her father and Gray on the terrace.</p>

<p>"Hello, Hamil!" called out Cardross, senior, from the lawn, "are
you game for a crack at the ducks to-morrow? My men report Ruffle
Lake full of coots and blue-bills, and there'll be bigger duck
in the West Lagoons."</p>

<p>"I'm going too," said Gray, "also Shiela if she wants to&mdash;and
four guides and that Seminole, Little Tiger."</p>

<p>Hamil glanced restlessly at the forest where his work lay. And
he needed it now. But he said pleasantly, "I'll go if you say
so."</p>

<p>"Of course I say so," exclaimed Cardross heartily. "Gray, does
Louis Malcourt still wish to go?"</p>

<p>"He spoke of it last week."</p>

<p>"Well, if he hasn't changed his rather volatile mind telephone
for Adams, We'll require a guide apiece. And he can have that
buckskin horse; and tell him to pick out his own gun." And to
Hamil, cordially: "Shiela and Louis and Gray will probably wander
about together and you and I will do the real shooting. But Shiela
is a shot&mdash;if she chooses. Gray would rather capture a scarce
jungle butterfly. Hello, here's Louis now! Are you glad we're
going at last?"</p>

<p>"Very," replied Hamil as Malcourt strolled up and airily signified
his intention of making one of the party. But as soon as he learned
that they might remain away three days or more he laughingly demurred.</p>

<p>The four men lingered for a few minutes in the hall discussing
guns, dogs, and guides; then Hamil mounted the stairs, and Malcourt
went with him, talking all the while in that easy, fluent, amusing
manner which, if he chose, could be as agreeably graceful as every
attitude and movement of his lithe body. His voice, too, had that
engagingly caressing quality characteristic of him when in good-humour;
he really had little to say to Hamil, but being on such excellent
terms with himself he said a great deal about nothing in particular;
and as he persistently lingered by Hamil's door the latter invited
him in.</p>

<p>There Malcourt lit a cigarette, seated lazily astride a chair,
arms folded across the back, aimlessly humourous in recounting
his adventures at the Ascott function, while Hamil stood with
his back to the darkening window, twisting his unlighted cigarette
into minute shreds and waiting for him to go.</p>

<p>"Rather jolly to meet Miss Suydam again," observed Malcourt.
"We were great friends at Portlaw's camp together two years ago.
I believe that you and Miss Suydam are cousins after a fashion."</p>

<p>"After a fashion, I believe."</p>

<p>"She's tremendously attractive, Hamil."</p>

<p>"What? Oh, yes, very."</p>

<p>"Evidently no sentiment lost between you," laughed the other.</p>

<p>"No, of course not; no sentiment."</p>

<p>Malcourt said carelessly: "I'm riding with Miss Suydam to-morrow.
That's one reason I'm not going on this duck-hunt."</p>

<p>Hamil nodded.</p>

<p>"Another reason," he continued, intent on the glowing end of
his cigarette, "is that I'm rather fortunate at the Club just
now&mdash;and I don't care to disturb any run of luck that seems inclined
to drift my way. Would you give your luck the double cross?"</p>

<p>"I suppose not," said Hamil vaguely&mdash;"if I ever had any."</p>

<p>"That's the way I feel. And it's all kinds of luck that's chasing
me. <em>All</em> kinds, Hamil. One kind, for example, wears hair
that matches my cuff-links. Odd, isn't it?" he added, examining
the golden links with a smile.</p>

<p>Hamil nodded inattentively.</p>

<p>"I am about seven thousand dollars ahead on the other sort of
luck," observed Malcourt. "If it holds to-night I'll inaugurate
a killing that will astonish the brothers B. yonder. By the way,
now that you have your club ticket why don't you use it?&mdash;one
way or another."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," replied Hamil listlessly.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Malcourt, becoming bored, genially took his
leave; and Hamil turned on an electric jet and began to undo his
collar and tie.</p>

<p>He was in no hurry; at times he suspended operations to pace
aimlessly to and fro; and after a while, half undressed, he dropped
into an arm-chair, clinched hands supporting his temples.</p>

<p>Presently he said aloud to himself: "It's absolutely impossible.
It can't happen this way. How can it?"</p>

<p>His heavy pulse answered the question; a tense strain, irksome
as an ache, dragged steadily at something within him which resisted;
dulling reason and thought.</p>

<p>For a long time he sat there inert, listening for the sound of
her voice which echoed at moments through the stunned silence
within him. And at last he stumbled to his feet like a stricken
man on the firing line, stupefied that the thing had happened
to <em>him</em>; and stood unsteadily, looking around. Then he
went heavily about his dressing.</p>

<p>Later, when he was ready to leave his room, he heard Malcourt
walking through the corridor outside&mdash;a leisurely and lightly
stepping Malcourt, whistling a lively air. And, when Malcourt
had passed came Cecile rustling from the western corridor, gay,
quick-stepping, her enchanting laughter passing through the corridor
like a fresh breeze as she joined Mrs. Carrick on the stairs.
Then silence; and he opened his door. And Shiela Cardross, passing
noiselessly, turned at the sound.</p>

<p>His face must have been easy to read for her own promptly lost
its colour, and with an involuntary recoil she stepped back against
the wall, staring at him in pallid silence.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" he asked, scarcely recognising his own
voice. And striving to shake off the unreality of it all with
a laugh: "You look like some pretty ghost from dreamland&mdash;with
your white gown and arms and face. Shall we descend into the waking
world together?"</p>

<p>They stood for a moment motionless, looking straight at one another;
then the smile died out on his face, but he still strove to speak
lightly, using effort, like a man with a dream dark upon him:
"I am waiting for your pretty ghostship."</p>

<p>Her lips moved in reply; no sound came from them.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of me?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Of <em>me</em>, Shiela?"</p>

<p>"Of us both. You don't know&mdash;you don't know!"</p>

<p>"Know what, Shiela?"</p>

<p>"What I am&mdash;what I have done. And I've got to tell you." Her
mouth quivered suddenly, and she faced him fighting for self-control.
"I've got to tell you. Things cannot be left in this way between
us. I thought they could, but they can't."</p>

<p>He crossed the corridor, slowly; she straightened up at his approach,
white, rigid, breathless.</p>

<p>"What is it that has frightened you?" he said.</p>

<p>"What you&mdash;said&mdash;to me."</p>

<p>"That I love you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that."</p>

<p>"Why should it frighten you?"</p>

<p>"Must I tell you?"</p>

<p>"If it will help you."</p>

<p>"I am past help. But it will end you're caring for me. And from
making me&mdash;care&mdash;for you. I must do it; this cannot go on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shiela!"</p>

<p>She faced him, white as death, looking at him blindly.</p>

<p>"I am trying to think of you&mdash;because you love me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fright chilled her blood, killing pulse and colour. "I am trying
to be kind&mdash;because I care for you&mdash;and we must end this before
it ends us.... Listen to my miserable, pitiful, little secret,
Mr. Hamil. <em>I&mdash;I </em>have &mdash;I am not&mdash;free."</p>

<p>"Not <em>free</em>!"</p>

<p>"I was married two years ago&mdash;when I was eighteen years old.
Three people in the world know it: you, I, and&mdash;the man I married."</p>

<p>"Married!" he repeated, stupefied.</p>

<p>She looked at him steadily a moment.</p>

<p>"I think your love has been done to death, Mr. Hamil. My own
danger was greater than you knew; but it was for your sake&mdash;because
you loved me. Good night."</p>

<p>Stunned, he saw her pass him and descend the stairs, stood for
a space alone, then scarce knowing what he did he went down into
the great living-room to take his leave of the family gathered
there before dinner had been announced. They all seemed to be
there; he was indifferently conscious of hearing his own words
like a man who listens to an unfamiliar voice in a distant room.</p>

<p>The rapid soundless night ride to the hotel seemed unreal; the
lights in the café, the noise and movement, the pretty face of
his aunt with the pink reflection from the candle shades on her
cheeks&mdash;all seemed as unconvincing as himself and this thing that
he could not grasp&mdash;could not understand&mdash;could not realise had
befallen him&mdash;and her.</p>

<p>If Miss Palliser was sensible of any change in him or his voice
or manner she did not betray it. Wayward came over to speak to
them, limping very slightly, tall, straight, ruddy, the gray silvering
his temples and edging his moustache.</p>

<p>And after a while Hamil found himself sitting silent, a partly
burnt cigar between his fingers, watching Wayward and his youthful
aunt in half-intimate, half-formal badinage, elbow to elbow on
the cloth. For they had known one another a long time, and through
many phases of Fate and Destiny.</p>

<p>"That little Cardross girl is playing the devil with the callow
hereabout," Wayward said; "Malcourt, house-broken, runs to heel
with the rest. And when I see her I feel like joining the pack.
Only &mdash;I was never broken, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She is a real beauty," said Miss Palliser warmly; "I don't see
why you don't enlist, James."</p>

<p>"I may at that. Garry, are you also involved?"</p>

<p>Hamil said, "Yes&mdash;yes, of course," and smiled meaninglessly at
Wayward.</p>

<p>For a fraction of a second his aunt hesitated, then said: "Garry
is naturally among the devoted&mdash;when he's not dog-tired from a
day in the cypress-swamps. Have you been out to see the work,
James? Oh, you should go; everybody goes; it's one of the things
to do here. And I'm very proud when I hear people say, 'There's
that brilliant young fellow, Hamil,' or, in a tone which expresses
profound respect, 'Hamil designed it, you know'; and I smile and
think, 'That's my boy Garry!' James, it is a very comfortable
sensation for an old lady to experience." And she looked at Wayward
out of her lovely golden eyes, sweet as a maid of twenty.</p>

<p>Wayward smiled, then absently bent his gaze on his wine-glass,
lying back in his chair. Through his spectacles his eyes seemed
very intent on the frail crystal stem of his glass.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do for the rest of the winter?" she asked,
watching him.</p>

<p>"What I am doing," he replied with smiling bitterness. "The <em>Ariani</em>
is yonder when I can't stand the shore.... What else is there
for me to do&mdash;until I snuff out!"</p>

<p>"Build that house you were going to build&mdash;when we were rather
younger, Jim."</p>

<p>"I did; and it fell," he said quietly; but, as though she had
not heard. " &mdash;Build that house," she repeated, "and line
it with books&mdash;the kind of books that were written and read before
the machine-made sort supplanted them. One picture to a room&mdash;do
you remember, Jim?&mdash;or two if you find it better; the kind men
painted before Rembrandt died.... Do you remember your plan?&mdash;the
plans you drew for me to look at in our front parlour&mdash;when New
York houses had parlours? You were twenty and I fourteen.... Garry,
yonder, was not.... And the rugs, you recollect?&mdash;one or two in
a room, Shiraz, Ispahan&mdash;nothing as obvious as Sehna and Saraband&mdash;nothing
but Moresque and pure Persian&mdash;and one agedly perfect gem of Asia
Minor, and one Tekke, so old and flawless that only the pigeon-blood
fire remained under the violet bloom.... Do you remember?"</p>

<p>Wayward's shoulders straightened with a jerk. For twenty years
he had not remembered these things; and she had not only remembered
but was now reciting the strange, quaint, resurrected words in
their forgotten sequence; the words he had uttered as he&mdash;or what
he had once been&mdash;sat in the old-time parlour in the mellow half
light of faded brocades and rosewood, repeating to a child the
programme of his future. Lofty aim and high ideal, the cultivated
endeavour of good citizenship, loyalty to aspiration, courage,
self-respect, and the noble living of life; they had also spoken
of these things together&mdash;there in the golden gloom of the old-time
parlour when she was fourteen and he master of his fate and twenty.</p>

<p>But there came into his life a brilliant woman who stayed a year
and left his name a mockery: Malcourt's only sister, now Lady
Tressilvain, doubtfully conspicuous with her loutish British husband,
among those continentals where titles serve rather to obscure
than enlighten inquiry.</p>

<p>The wretched affair dragged its full offensive length through
the international press; leaving him with his divorce signed and
a future endurable only when his senses had been sufficiently
drugged. In sober intervals he now had neuritis and a limp to
distract his mind; also his former brother-in-law with professions
of esteem and respect and a tendency to borrow. And drunk or sober
he had the <em>Ariani</em>. But the house that Youth had built
in the tinted obscurity of an old New York parlour&mdash;no, he didn't
have that; and even memory of it were wellnigh gone had not Constance
Palliser spoken from the shadows of the past.</p>

<p>He lifted his glass unsteadily and replaced it. Then slowly he
raised his head and looked full at Constance Palliser.</p>

<p>"It's too late," he said; "but I wish I had known that you remembered."</p>

<p>"Would you have built it, Jim?"</p>

<p>He looked at her again, then shook his head: "For whom am I to
build, Constance?"</p>

<p>She leaned forward, glancing at the unconscious Hamil, then dropped
her voice: "Build it for the Boy that Was, Jim."</p>

<p>"A headstone would be fitter&mdash;and less expensive."</p>

<p>"I am not asking you to build in memory of the dead. The Boy
who Was is only asleep. If you could let him wake, suddenly, in
that house&mdash;"</p>

<p>A clear flush of surprise stained his skin to the hair. It had
been many years since a woman had hinted at any belief in him.</p>

<p>"Don't you know that I couldn't endure the four walls of a house,
Constance?"</p>

<p>"You have not tried this house."</p>

<p>"Men&mdash;such men as <em>I&mdash;</em>cannot go back to the House of
Youth."</p>

<p>"Try, Jim."</p>

<p>His hand was shaking as he lifted it to adjust his spectacles;
and impulsively she laid her hand on his twitching arm:</p>

<p>"Jim, build it!&mdash;and see what happens."</p>

<p>"I cannot."</p>

<p>"Build it. You will not be alone and sad in it if you remember
the boy and the child in the parlour. They&mdash;they will be good
company&mdash;if you wish."</p>

<p>He rested his elbows on the table, head bent between his sea-burned
hands.</p>

<p>"If I could only, only do something," she whispered. "The boy
has merely been asleep, Jim. I have always known it. But it has
taken many years for me to bring myself to this moment."</p>

<p>"Do you think a man can come back through such wreckage and mire&mdash;do
you think he wants to come back? What do you know about it?&mdash;with
your white skin and bright hair&mdash;and that child's mouth of yours
&mdash;What do you know about it?"</p>

<p>"Once you were the oracle, Jim. May I not have my turn?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but what in God's name do you care?"</p>

<p>"Will you build?"</p>

<p>He looked at her dumbly, hopelessly; then his arm twitched and
he relieved the wrist from the weight of his head, sitting upright,
his eyes still bent on her.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;in that old parlour&mdash;the child expected it of the boy,"
she said. "And expects it yet."</p>

<p>Hamil, who, chair pushed back, had been listlessly watching the
orchestra, roused himself and turned to his aunt and Wayward.</p>

<p>"You want to go, Garry?" said Constance calmly. "I'll walk a
little with James before I compose my aged bones to slumber....
Good night, dear. Will you come again soon?"</p>

<p>He said he would and took his leave of them in the long corridor,
traversing it without noticing which direction he took until,
awaking from abstraction, he found himself at the head of a flight
of steps and saw the portico of the railroad station below him
and the signal lamps, green and red and white, burning between
the glistening rails.</p>

<p>Without much caring where he went, but not desiring to retrace
his steps over half a mile or so of carpet, he went out into the
open air and along the picket fence toward the lake front.</p>

<p>As he came to the track crossing he glanced across at the Beach
Club where lights sparkled discreetly amid a tropical thicket
and flowers lay in pale carpets under the stars.</p>

<p>Portlaw had sent him a member's card; he took it out now and
scanned it with faint curiosity. His name was written on the round-cornered
brown card signed by a "vice-president" and a "secretary," under
the engraved notice: "To be shown when requested."</p>

<p>But when he ascended the winding walk among the palms and orange
blossoms, this "suicide's tag," as Malcourt called it, was not
demanded of him at the door.</p>

<p>The restaurant seemed to be gay and rather noisy, the women vivacious,
sometimes beautiful, and often respectable. A reek of cigarette
smoke, wine, and orange blossoms hung about the corridors; the
tiny glittering rotunda with its gaming-tables in a circle was
thronged.</p>

<p>He watched them lose and win and lose again. Under the soft tumult
of voices the cool tones of the house attachés sounded monotonously,
the ball rattled, the wheels spun. But curiosity had already died
out within him; gain, loss, chance, Fate&mdash;and the tense white
concentration of the man beside him no longer interested him;
nor did a sweet-faced young girl in the corridor who looked a
second too long at him; nor the handsome over-flushed youth who
was with her and who cried out in loud recognition: "Gad, Hamil;
why didn't you tell me you were coming? There's somebody here
who wants to meet you, but Portlaw's got her&mdash;somewhere. You'll
take supper with us anyway! We'll find you a fair impenitent."</p>

<p>Hamil stared at him coolly. He was on no such terms with Malcourt,
drunk or sober. But everybody was Malcourt's friend just then,
and he went on recklessly:</p>

<p>"You've got to stay; hasn't he, Dolly?&mdash;Oh, I forgot &mdash;Miss
Wilming, Mr. Hamil, who's doing the new park, you know. All kinds
of genius buzzes in his head&mdash;roulette wheels buzz in mine. Hamil,
you remember Miss Wilming in the 'Motor Girl.' She was one of
the acetylenes. Come on; we'll all light up later. Make him come,
Dolly."</p>

<p>Hamil turned to speak to her. She seemed to be, at a casual glance,
the sort of young girl who usually has a mother somewhere within
ear-shot. Upon inspection, however, her bright hair was a little
too perfectly rippled, and her mouth a trifle fuller and redder
than a normal circulation might account for. But there remained
in the eyes something as yet unquenched. And looking at her, he
felt a sense of impatience and regret that the delicate youth
of her should be wasted in the flare and shadow of the lesser
world&mdash;burning to a spectre here on the crumbling edge of things&mdash;here
with Malcourt leering at her through the disordered brilliancy
of that false dawn which heralds only night.</p>

<p>They spoke together, smilingly formal. He had quietly turned
his back on Malcourt.</p>

<p>She hoped he would remain and join them; and her as yet unspoiled
voice clashed with her tinted lips and hair.</p>

<p>He was sorry&mdash;politely so&mdash;thanking her with the natural and
unconscious gentleness so agreeable to all women. And as in his
manner there was not the slightest hint of that half-amused, half-cynical
freedom characteristic of the worldly wise whom she was now accustoming
herself to meet, she looked up at him with a faint flush of appreciation.</p>

<p>Malcourt all the while was pulling Hamil by the elbow and talking
on at random almost boisterously, checking himself at intervals
to exchange familiar greetings with new-comers passing the crowded
corridor. His face was puffy and red; so were his lips; and there
seemed to be a shiny quality to hair and skin prophetic of future
coarsening toward a type, individuals of which swarmed like sleek
flies around the gaming-tables beyond.</p>

<p>As Hamil glanced from the young girl to Malcourt, who was still
noisily importuning him, a sudden contempt for the man arose within
him. So unreasoningly abrupt was the sensation of absolute distrust
and dislike that it cut his leave-taking to a curt word of refusal,
and he turned on his heel.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you? Aren't you coming with us?" asked
Malcourt, reddening.</p>

<p>"No," said Hamil. "Good-bye, Miss Wilming. Thank you for asking
me."</p>

<p>She held out her hand, uncertainly; he took it with a manner
so gentle and considerate that she ventured, hesitatingly, something
about seeing him again. To which he replied, pleasantly conventional,
and started toward the door.</p>

<p>"See here, Hamil," said Malcourt sharply, "is there any reason
for your sudden and deliberate rudeness to me?"</p>

<p>"Is there any reason for your sudden and deliberate familiarity
with me?" retorted Hamil in a low voice. "You're drunk!"</p>

<p>Malcourt's visage crimsoned: "O hell!" he said, "if your morals
are as lofty as your mincing manners&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hamil stared him into silence, hesitated, then passed in front
of him and out of the door.</p>

<p>Vicious with irritation, Malcourt laid his hand on the girl's
arm: "Take it from me, Dolly, that's the sort of citizen who'll
sneak around to call on your sort Saturday evenings."</p>

<p>She flushed painfully, but said nothing. "As for me," added Malcourt,
"I don't think I've quite finished with this nice young man."</p>

<p>But Dolly Wilming stood silent, head bent, slender fingers worrying
her lips, which seemed inclined to quiver.</p>
