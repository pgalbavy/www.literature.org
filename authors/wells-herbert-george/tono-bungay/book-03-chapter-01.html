I 
<P>
But now that I resume the main line of my story it may be well to
describe the personal appearance of my uncle as I remember him
during those magnificent years that followed his passage from
trade to finance.  The little man plumped up very considerably
during the creation of the Tono-Bungay property, but with the
increasing excitements that followed that first flotation came
dyspepsia and a certain flabbiness and falling away.  His
abdomen--if the reader will pardon my taking his features in the
order of their value--had at first a nice full roundness, but
afterwards it lost tone without, however, losing size.  He always
went as though he was proud of it and would make as much of it as
possible.  To the last his movements remained quick and sudden,
his short firm legs, as he walked, seemed to twinkle rather than
display the scissors-stride of common humanity, and he never
seemed to have knees, but instead, a dispersed flexibility of
limb.
<P>
There was, I seem to remember, a secular intensification of his
features; his nose developed character, became aggressive, stuck
out at the world more and more; the obliquity of his mouth, I
think, increased. From the face that returns to my memory
projects a long cigar that is sometimes cocked jauntily up from
the higher corner, that sometimes droops from the lower;--it was
as eloquent as a dog's tail, and he removed it only for the more
emphatic modes of speech.  He assumed  a broad black ribbon for
his glasses, and wore them more and more askew as time went on. 
His hair seemed to stiffen with success, but towards the climax
it thinned greatly over the crown, and he brushed it hard back
over his ears where, however, it stuck out fiercely.  It always
stuck out fiercely over his forehead, up and forward.
<P>
He adopted an urban style of dressing with the onset of
Tono-Bungay and rarely abandoned it.  He preferred silk hats with
ample rich brims, often a trifle large for him by modern ideas,
and he wore them at various angles to his axis; his taste in
trouserings was towards fairly emphatic stripes and his trouser
cut was neat; he liked his frock-coat long and full, although
that seemed to shorten him.  He displayed a number of valuable
rings, and I remember one upon his left little finger with a
large red stone bearing Gnostic symbols. "Clever chaps, those
Gnostics, George," he told me. "Means a lot.  Lucky!"  He never
had any but a black mohair watch-chair.  In the country he
affected grey and a large grey cloth top-hat, except when
motoring;  then he would have a brown deer-stalker cap and a fur
suit of esquimaux cut with a sort of boot-end to the trousers. 
Of an evening he would wear white waistcoats and plain gold
studs.  He hated diamonds. "Flashy," he said they were.  "Might
as well wear--an income tax-receipt.  All very well for Park
Lane.  Unsold stock.  Not my style.  Sober financier, George."  
<P>
So much for his visible presence.  For a time it was very
familiar to the world, for at the crest of the boom he allowed
quite a number of photographs and at least one pencil sketch to
be published in the sixpenny papers.
<P>
His voice declined during those years from his early tenor to a
flat rich quality of sound that my knowledge  of music is
inadequate to describe.  His Zzz-ing inrush of air became less
frequent as he ripened, but returned in moments of excitement. 
Throughout his career, in spite of his increasing and at last
astounding opulence, his more intimate habits remained as simple
as they had been at Wimblehurst.  He would never avail himself of
the services of a valet; at the very climax of his greatness his
trousers were folded by a housemaid and his shoulders brushed as
he left his house or hotel.  He became wary about breakfast as
life advanced, and at one time talked much of Dr. Haig and uric
acid.  But for other meals he remained reasonably omnivorous.  He
was something of a gastronome, and would eat anything he
particularly liked in an audible manner, and perspire upon his
forehead.  He was a studiously moderate drinker--except when the
spirit of some public banquet or some great occasion caught him
and bore him beyond his wariness--there he would, as it were,
drink inadvertently and become flushed and talkative--about
everything but his business projects.
<P>
To make the portrait complete one wants to convey an effect of
sudden, quick bursts of movement like the jumps of a
Chinese-cracker to indicate that his pose whatever it is, has
been preceded and will be followed by a rush.  If I were painting
him, I should certainly give him for a background that
distressed, uneasy sky that was popular in the eighteenth
century, and at a convenient distance a throbbing motor-car,
very big and contemporary, a secretary hurrying with papers, and
an alert chauffeur.
<P>
Such was the figure that created and directed the great property
of Tono-Bungay, and from the successful reconstruction of that
company passed on to a slow crescendo of magnificent creations
and promotions until the whole world of investors marveled.  I
have already I think, mentioned how, long before we offered Tono
Bungay to the public, we took over the English agency of certain
American specialties.  To this was presently added our
exploitation of Moggs' Domestic Soap, and so he took up the
Domestic Convenience Campaign that, coupled with his equatorial
rotundity and a certain resolute convexity in his bearings won my
uncle his Napoleonic title.
<P>
II
<P>
It illustrates the romantic element in modern commerce that my
uncle met young Moggs at a city dinner--I think it was the
Bottle-makers' Company--when both were some way advanced beyond
the initial sobriety of the occasion.  This was the grandson of
the original Moggs, and a very typical instance of an educated,
cultivated, degenerate plutocrat.  His people had taken him about
in his youth as the Ruskins took their John and fostered a
passion for history in him, and the actual management of the
Moggs' industry had devolved  upon a cousin and a junior partner.
<P>
Mr. Moggs, being of a studious and refined disposition, had just
decided--after a careful search for a congenial subject in which
he would not be constant]y reminded of soap--to devote himself
to the History of the Thebaid, when this cousin died suddenly and
precipitated responsibilities upon him.  In the frankness of
conviviality, Moggs bewailed the uncongenial task thus thrust
into his hands, and my uncle offered to lighten his burden by a
partnership then and there.  They even got to terms--extremely
muzzy terms, but terms nevertheless.
<P>
Each gentleman wrote the name and address of the other on his
cuff, and they separated in a mood of brotherly carelessness, and
next morning neither seems to have thought to rescue his shirt
from the wash until it was too late.  My uncle made a painful
struggle--it was one of my business mornings--to recall name and
particulars.
<P>
"He was an aquarium-faced, long, blond sort of chap, George, with
glasses and a genteel accent," he said.
<P>
I was puzzled.  "Aquarium-faced?" 
<P>
"You know how they look at you.  His stuff was soap, I'm pretty
nearly certain.  And he had a name--And the thing was the
straightest Bit-of-All-right you ever.  I was clear enough to
spot that..."  
<P>
We went out at last with knitted brows, and wandered up into
Finsbury seeking a good, well-stocked looking grocer.  We called
first on a chemist for a pick-me-up for my uncle, and then we
found the shop we needed.
<P>
"I want," said my uncle, "half a pound of every sort of soap you
got.  Yes, I want to take them now.  Wait a moment, George.... 
Now what sort of soap d'you call THAT?" 
<P>
At the third repetition of that question the young man said,
"Moggs' Domestic."  
<P>
"Right," said my uncle.  "You needn't guess again.  Come along,
George, let's go to a telephone and get on to Moggs.  Oh--the
order?  Certainly.  I confirm it.  Send it all--send it all to
the Bishop of London; he'll have some good use for
it--(First-rate man, George, he is--charities and all that)--and
put it down to me, here's a card--Ponderevo--Tono-Bungay."  
<P>
Then we went on to Moggs and found him in a camel-hair
dressing-jacket in a luxurious bed, drinking China tea, and got
the shape of everything but the figures fixed by lunch time.
<P>
Young Moggs enlarged my mind considerably; he was a sort of thing
I hadn't met before; he seemed quite clean and well-informed and
he assured me to never read newspapers nor used soap in any form
at all, "Delicate skin," he said.
<P>
"No objection to our advertising you wide and free?"  said my
uncle.
<P>
"I draw the line at railway stations," said Moggs, "south-coast
cliffs, theatre programmes, books by me and poetry
generally--scenery--oh!--and the Mercure de France." 
<P>
"We'll get along," said my uncle.
<P>
"So long as you don't annoy me," said Moggs, lighting a
cigarette, "you can make me as rich as you like."  
<P>
We certainly made him no poorer.  His was the first firm that was
advertised by a circumstantial history; we even got to
illustrated magazine articles telling of the quaint past of
Moggs.  We concocted Moggsiana. Trusting to our partner's
preoccupation with the uncommercial aspects of life, we gave
graceful history--of Moggs the First, Moggs the Second, Moggs
the Third, and Moggs the Fourth.  You must, unless you are very
young, remember some of them and our admirable block of a
Georgian shop window.  My uncle brought early nineteenth-century
memoirs, soaked himself in the style, and devised stories about
old Moggs the First and the Duke of Wellington, George the Third
and the soap dealer ("almost certainly old Moggs").  Very soon we
had added to the original Moggs' Primrose several varieties  of
scented and superfatted, a "special nurseries used in the
household of the Duke of Kent and for the old Queen in Infancy,"
a plate powder, "the Paragon,"  and a knife powder.  We roped in
a good little second-rate black-lead firm, and carried their
origins back into the mists of antiquity.  It was my uncle's own
unaided idea that we should associate that commodity with the
Black Prince.  He became industriously curious about the past of
black-lead.  I remember his button-holing the president of the
Pepys Society.
<P>
"I say, is there any black-lead in Pepys?  You know
--black-lead--for grates!  OR DOES HE PASS IT OVER AS A MATTER
OF COURSE?"
<P>
He became in those days the terror of eminent historians.  
"Don't want your drum and trumpet history--no fear," he used to
say.  "Don't want to know who was who's mistress, and why
so-and-so devastated such a province; that's bound to be all
lies and upsy-down anyhow.  Not my affair.  Nobody's affair now. 
Chaps who did it didn't clearly know.... What I want to know is,
in the Middle Ages, did they do anything for Housemaid's Knee?
What did they put in their hot baths after jousting, and was the
Black Prince--you know the Black Prince--was he enameled or
painted, or what?  I think myself, black-leaded--very
likely--like pipe-clay--but DID they use blacking so early?" 
<P>
So it came about that in designing and writing those Moggs' Soap
Advertisements, that wrought a revolution in that department of
literature, my uncle was brought to realise not only the lost
history, but also the enormous field for invention and enterprise
that lurked among the little articles, the dustpans and mincers,
the mousetraps and carpet-sweepers that fringe the shops of the
oilman and domestic ironmonger.  He was recalled to one of the
dreams of his youth, to his conception of the Ponderevo Patent
Flat that had been in his mind so early as the days before I went
to serve him at Wimblehurst.  "The Home, George," he said,
"wants straightening up.  Silly muddle! Things that get in the
way.  Got to organise it."  
<P>
For a time he displayed something like the zeal of a genuine
social reformer in relation to these matters.
<P>
"We've got to bring the Home Up to Date?  That's my idee, George.
We got to make a civilised domestic machine out of these relics
of barbarism.   I'm going to hunt up inventors, make a corner in
d'mestic ideas. Everything.  Balls of string that won't dissolve
into a tangle, and gum that won't dry into horn.  See?  Then
after conveniences--beauty.  Beauty, George!  All these few
things ought to be made fit to look at; it's your aunt's idea,
that.   Beautiful jam-pots!  Get one of those new art chaps to
design all the things they make ugly now.  Patent carpet-sweepers
by these greenwood chaps, housemaid's boxes it'll be a pleasure
to fall over--rich coloured house-flannels.  Zzzz.  Pails,
f'rinstance.  Hang 'em up on the walls like warming-pans.  All
the polishes and things in such tins--you'll want to cuddle 'em,
George!  See the notion?  'Sted of all the silly ugly things we
got."...
<P>
We had some magnificent visions; they so affected me that when I
passed ironmongers and oil-shops they seemed to me as full of
promise as trees in late winter, flushed with the effort to burst
into leaf and flower.... And really we did do much towards that
very brightness these shops display.  They were dingy things in
the eighties compared to what our efforts have made them now,
grey quiet displays.
<P>
Well, I don't intend to write down here the tortuous financial
history of Moggs' Limited, which was our first development of
Moggs and Sons; nor will I tell very much of how from that we
spread ourselves with a larger and larger conception throughout
the chandlery and minor ironmongery, how we became agents for
this little commodity, partners in that, got a tentacle round the
neck of a specialised manufacturer or so, secured a pull upon
this or that supply of raw material, and so prepared the way for
our second flotation, Domestic Utilities; "Do it," they reordered
it in the city.  And then came the reconstruction of Tono-Bungay,
and then "Household services" and the Boom!
<P>
That sort of development is not to he told in detail in a novel. 
I have, indeed, told much of it elsewhere. It is to be found set
out at length, painfully at length, in my uncle's examination and
mine in the bankruptcy proceedings, and in my own various
statements after his death.  Some people know everything in that
story, some know it all too well, most do not want the details.
it is the story of a man of imagination among figures, and unless
you are prepared to collate columns of pounds, shillings and
pence, compare dates and check additions, you will find it very
unmeaning and perplexing.   And after all, you wouldn't find the
early figures so much wrong as STRAINED.  In the matter of
Moggs and Do Ut, as in the first Tono-Bungay promotion and in its
reconstruction, we left the court by city standards without a
stain on our characters.  The great amalgamation of Household
Services was my uncle's first really big-scale enterprise and
his first display of bolder methods: for this we bought back Do
Ut, Moggs (going strong with a seven per cent. dividend) and
acquired Skinnerton's polishes, the Riffleshaw properties and the
Runcorn's mincer and coffee-mill business.  To that Amalgamation
I was really not a party; I left it to my uncle because I was
then beginning to get keen upon the soaring experiments I had
taken on from the results then to hand of Lilienthal, Pilcher and
the Wright brothers.  I was developing a glider into a flyer.  I
meant to apply power to this glider as soon as I could work out
one or two residual problems affecting the longitudinal
stability.  I knew that I had a sufficiently light motor in my
own modification of Bridger's light turbine, but I knew too that
until I had cured my aeroplane of a tendency demanding constant
alertness from me, a tendency to jerk up its nose at unexpected
moments and slide back upon me, the application of an engine
would be little short of suicide.
<P>
But that I will tell about later.  The point I was coming to was
that I did not realise until after the crash how recklessly my
uncle had kept his promise of paying a dividend of over eight per
cent. on the ordinary shares of that hugely over-capitalised
enterprise, Household Services.
<P>
I drifted out of business affairs into my research much more than
either I or my uncle had contemplated.  Finance was much less to
my taste than the organisation of the Tono-Bungay factory.  In
the new field of enterprise there was a great deal of bluffing
and gambling, of taking chances and concealing material
facts--and these are hateful things to the scientific type of
mind.  It wasn't fear I felt so much as an uneasy inaccuracy.  I
didn't realise dangers, I simply disliked the sloppy, relaxing
quality of this new sort of work.  I was at last constantly
making excuses not to come up to him in London.  The latter part
of his business career recedes therefore beyond the circle of any
particular life.  I lived more or less with him; I talked, I
advised, I helped him at times to fight his Sunday crowd at Crest
Hill, but I did not follow nor guide him.  From the Do Ut time
onward he rushed up the financial world like a bubble in water
and left me like some busy water-thing down below in the deeps.
<P>
Anyhow, he was an immense success.  The public was, I think,
particularly attracted by the homely familiarity of his field of
work--you never lost sight of your investment they felt, with
the name on the house-flannel and shaving-strop--and its
allegiance was secured by the Egyptian solidity of his apparent
results.  Tono-Bungay,  after its reconstruction, paid thirteen,
Moggs seven, Domestic Utilities had been a safe-looking nine;
here was Household Services with eight; on such a showing he had
merely to buy and sell Roeburn's Antiseptic fluid, Razor soaks
and Bath crystals in three weeks to clear twenty thousand pounds.
<P>
I do think that as a matter of fact Roeburn's was good value at
the price at which he gave it to the public, at least until it
was strained by ill-conserved advertisement.  It was a period of
expansion and confidence; much money was seeking investment and
"Industrials" were the fashion. Prices were rising all round. 
There remained little more for my uncle to do therefore, in his
climb to the high unstable crest of Financial Greatness but, as
he said, to "grasp the cosmic oyster, George, while it gaped," 
which, being translated, meant for him to buy respectable 
businesses confidently and courageously at the vendor's 
estimate, add thirty or forty thousand to the price and sell them
again.  His sole difficulty indeed was the tactful management of
the load of shares that each of these transactions left upon his
hands.  But I thought so little of these later things that I
never fully appreciated the peculiar inconveniences of that until
it was too late to help him.
<P>
III
<P>
When I think of my uncle near the days of his Great Boom and in
connection with the actualities of his enterprises, I think of
him as I used to see him in the suite of rooms he occupied in the
Hardingham Hotel, seated at a great old oak writing-table,
smoking, drinking, and incoherently busy; that was his typical
financial aspect--our evenings, our mornings, our holidays, our
motor-car expeditions, Lady Grove and Crest Hill belong to an
altogether different set of memories.
<P>
These rooms in the Hardingham were a string of apartments along
one handsome thick-carpeted corridor.  All the doors upon the
corridor were locked except the first; and my uncle's bedroom,
breakfast-room and private  sanctum were the least accessible
and served by an entrance from the adjacent passage, which he
also used at times as a means of escape from importunate callers.
The most eternal room was a general waiting-room and very
business-like in quality; it had one or two uneasy sofas, a
number of chairs, a green baize table, and a collection of the
very best Moggs and Tone posters: and the plush carpets normal to
the Hardingham had been replaced by a grey-green cork linoleum;
Here I would always find a remarkable miscellany of people
presided over by a peculiarly faithful and ferocious looking
commissioner, Ropper, who guarded the door that led a step nearer
my uncle.  Usually there would be a parson or so, and one or two
widows; hairy, eyeglassy, middle-aged gentlemen, some of them
looking singularly like Edward Ponderevos who hadn't come off, a
variety of young and youngish men more or less attractively
dressed, some with papers protruding from their pockets, others
with their papers decently concealed. And wonderful, incidental,
frowsy people.
<P>
All these persons maintained a practically hopeless
siege--sometimes for weeks together; they had better have stayed
at home.  Next came a room full of people who had some sort of
appointment, and here one would find smart-looking people,
brilliantly dressed, nervous women hiding behind magazines,
nonconformist divines, clergy in gaiters, real business men,
these latter for the most part gentlemen in admirable morning
dress who stood up and scrutinised my uncle's taste in water
colours manfully and sometimes by the hour together. Young men
again were here of various social origins, young Americans,
treasonable clerks from other concerns,  university young men,
keen-looking, most of them, resolute, reserved, but on a sort of
hair trigger, ready at any moment to be most voluble, most
persuasive.
<P>
This room had a window, too, looking out into the hotel courtyard
with its fern-set fountains and mosaic pavement, and the young
men would stand against this and sometimes even mutter.  One day
I heard one repeating in all urgent whisper as I passed "But you
don't quite see, Mr. Ponderevo, the full advantages, the FULL
advantages--" I met his eye and he was embarrassed.
<P>
Then came a room with a couple of secretaries--no typewriters,
because my uncle hated the clatter--and a casual person or two
sitting about, projectors whose projects were being entertained. 
Here and in a further room nearer the private apartments, my
uncle's correspondence underwent an exhaustive process of pruning
and digestion before it reached him.  Then the two little rooms
in which my uncle talked; my magic uncle who had got the
investing public--to whom all things were possible.   As one came
in we would find him squatting with his cigar up and an
expression of dubious beatitude upon his face, while some one
urged him to grow still richer by this or that.
<P>
"That'ju, George?" he used to say.  "Come in.  Here's a thing. 
Tell him--Mister--over again.  Have a drink, George?  No!  Wise
man!  Liss'n."  
<P>
I was always ready to listen.  All sorts of financial marvels
came out of the Hardingham, more particularly during my uncle's
last great flurry, but they were nothing to the projects that
passed in.  It was the little brown and gold room he sat in
usually.  He had had it redecorated by Bordingly and half a dozen
Sussex pictures by Webster hung about it.  Latterly he wore a
velveteen jacket of a golden-brown colour in this apartment that
I think over-emphasised its esthetic intention, and he also
added some gross Chinese bronzes.
<P>
He was, on the whole, a very happy man throughout all that wildly
enterprising time.  He made and, as I shall tell in its place,
spent great sums of money.  He was constantly in violent motion,
constantly stimulated mentally and physically and rarely tired. 
About him was an atmosphere of immense deference much of his
waking life was triumphal and all his dreams.  I doubt if he had
any dissatisfaction with himself at all until the crash bore him
down.  Things must have gone very rapidly with him.... I think
he must have been very happy.
<P>
As I sit here writing about all these things, jerking down notes
and throwing them aside in my attempt to give some literary form
to the tale of our promotions, the marvel of it all comes to me
as if it came for the first time the supreme unreason of it.  At
the climax of his Boom, my uncle at the most sparing estimate 
must have possessed in substance and credit about two million
pounds'-worth of property to set off against his vague colossal
liabilities, and from first to last he must have had a
controlling influence in the direction of nearly thirty millions.
<P>
This irrational muddle of a community in which we live gave him
that, paid him at that rate for sitting in a room and scheming
and telling it lies.  For he created nothing, he invented
nothing, he economised nothing.  I cannot claim that a single one
of the great businesses we organised added any real value to
human life at all.  Several like Tono-Bungay were unmitigated
frauds by any honest standard, the giving of nothing coated in
advertisements for money.  And the things the Hardingham gave
out, I repeat, were nothing to the things that came in.  I think
of the long procession of people who sat down before us and
propounded this and that.  Now it was a device for selling bread
under a fancy name and so escaping the laws as to weight--this
was afterwards floated as the Decorticated Health-Bread Company
and bumped against the law--now it was a new scheme for still
more strident advertisement, now it was a story of unsuspected
deposits of minerals, now a cheap and nasty substitute for this
or that common necessity, now the treachery of a too
well-informed employee, anxious to become our partner.  It was
all put to us tentatively, persuasively.  Sometimes one had a
large pink blusterous person trying to carry us off our feet by
his pseudo-boyish frankness, now some dyspeptically yellow
whisperer, now some earnest, specially dressed youth with an
eye-glass and a buttonhole, now some homely-speaking, shrewd
Manchester man or some Scotchman eager to be very clear and full.
<P>
Many came in couples or trios, often in tow of an explanatory
solicitor.  Some were white and earnest, some flustered beyond
measure at their opportunity.  Some of them begged and prayed to
be taken up.  My uncle chose what he wanted and left the rest. 
He became very autocratic to these applicants.
<P>
He felt he could make them, and they felt so too.  He had but to
say "No!" and they faded out of existence.... He had become a
sort of vortex to which wealth flowed of its own accord.  His
possessions increased by heaps; his shares, his leaseholds and
mortgages and debentures.
<P>
Behind his first-line things he found it necessary at last, and
sanctioned by all the precincts, to set up three general trading
companies, the London and African Investment Company, the British
Traders' Loan Company, and Business Organisations Limited.  This
was in the culminating time when I had least to do with affairs. 
I don't say that with any desire to exculpate myself; I admit I
was a director of all three, and I will confess I was willfully
incurious in that capacity.  Each of these companies ended its
financial year solvent by selling great holdings of shares to one
or other of its sisters, and paying a dividend out of the
proceeds.  I sat at the table and agreed.  That was our method of
equilibrium at the iridescent climax of the bubble.
<P>
You perceive now, however, the nature of the services for which
this fantastic community have him unmanageable  wealth and power
and real respect.  It was all a monstrous payment for courageous
fiction, a gratuity in return for the one reality of human
life--illusion.  We gave them a feeling of hope and profit; we
sent a tidal wave of water and confidence into their stranded
affairs.  "We mint Faith, George," said my uncle one day. 
"That's what we do.  And by Jove we got to keep minting!  We been
making human confidence ever since I drove the first cork of
Tono-Bungay."  
<P>
"Coining" would have been a better word than minting!  And yet,
you know, in a sense he was right.  Civilisation is possible only
through confidence, so that we can bank our money and go unarmed
about the streets.  The bank reserve or a policeman keeping order
in a jostling multitude of people, are only slightly less
impudent bluffs than my uncle's prospectuses.  They couldn't for
a moment "make good" if the quarter of what they guarantee was
demanded of them.  The whole of this modern mercantile investing
civilisation is indeed such stuff as dreams are made of.  A
mass of people swelters and toils, great railway systems grow,
cities arise to the skies and spread wide and far, mines are
opened, factories hum, foundries roar, ships plough the seas,
countries are settled; about this busy striving world the rich
owners go, controlling all, enjoying all, confident and creating
the confidence that draws us all together into a reluctant,
nearly unconscious brotherhood.  I wonder and plan my engines. 
The flags flutter, the crowds cheer, the legislatures meet.  Yet
it seems to me indeed at times that all this present commercial
civilisation is no more than my poor uncle's career writ large, a
swelling, thinning bubble of assurances; that its arithmetic is
just as unsound, its dividends as ill-advised, its ultimate aim
as vague and forgotten; that it all drifts on perhaps to some
tremendous parallel to his individual disaster...
<P>
Well, so it was we Boomed, and for four years and a half we lived
a life of mingled substance and moonshine.  Until our particular
unsoundness overtook us we went about in the most magnificent of
motor-cars upon tangible high roads, made ourselves conspicuous
and stately in splendid houses, ate sumptuously and had a
perpetual stream of notes and money trickling into our pockets;
hundreds of thousands of men and women respected us,  saluted us
and gave us toil and honour; I asked, and my worksheets rose, my
aeroplanes swooped out of nothingness to scare the downland
pe-wits; my uncle waved his hand and Lady Grove and all its
associations  of chivalry and ancient peace were his; waved
again, and architects were busy planning the great palace he
never finished at Crest Hill and an army of folkmen gathered to
do his bidding, blue marble came from Canada, and timber from New
Zealand; and beneath  it all, you know, there was nothing but
fictitious values as evanescent as rainbow gold.
<P>
IV
<P>
I pass the Hardingham ever and again and glance aside through the
great archway at the fountain and the ferns, and think of those
receding days when I was so near the centre of our eddy of greed
and enterprise. I see again my uncle's face, white and intent,
and hear him discourse, hear him make consciously Napoleonic
decisions, "grip" his nettles, put his "finger on the spot,"
"bluff," say "snap."  He became particularly addicted to the last
idiom.  Towards the end every conceivable act took the form of
saying "snap!" 
<P>
The odd fish that came to us!  And among others came
Gordon-Nasmyth, that queer blend of romance and illegality who
was destined to drag me into the most irrelevant adventure in my
life the Mordet Island affair; and leave me, as they say, with
blood upon my hands.  It is remarkable how little it troubles my
conscience and how much it stirs my imagination, that particular
memory of the life I took.  The story of Mordet Island has been
told in a government report and told all wrong; there are still
excellent reasons for leaving it wrong in places, but the
liveliest appeals of discretion forbid my leaving it out
altogether.
<P>
I've still the vividest memory of Gordon-Nasmyth's appearance in
the inner sanctum, a lank, sunburnt person in tweeds with a
yellow-brown hatchet face and one faded blue eye--the other was
a closed and sunken lid--and how he told us with a stiff
affectation of ease his incredible story of this great heap of
quap that lay abandoned or undiscovered on the beach behind
Mordet's Island among white dead mangroves and the black ooze of
brackish water.
<P>
"What's quap?" said my uncle on the fourth repetition of the
word.
<P>
"They call it quap, or quab, or quabb," said Gordon-Nasmyth; "but
our relations weren't friendly enough to get the accent right....
<P>
But there the stuff is for the taking.  They don't know about it.
<P>
Nobody knows about it.  I got down to the damned place in a canoe
alone.  The boys wouldn't come.  I pretended to be botanising."
...
<P>
To begin with, Gordon-Nasmyth was inclined to be dramatic.
<P>
"Look here," he said when he first came in, shutting the door
rather carefully behind him as he spoke, "do you two men--yes
or no--want to put up six thousand--for--a clear good chance of
fifteen hundred per cent. on your money in a year?" 
<P>
"We're always getting chances like that," said my uncle, cocking
his cigar offensively, wiping his glasses and tilting his chair
back.  "We stick to a safe twenty."  
<P>
Gordon-Nasmyth's quick temper showed in a slight stiffening of
his attitude.
<P>
"Don't you believe him," said I, getting up before he could
reply.  "You're different, and I know your books.  We're very
glad you've come to us.  Confound it, uncle! Its Gordon-Nasmyth!
Sit down.  What is it?  Minerals?" 
<P>
"Quap," said Gordon-Nasmyth, fixing his eye on me, "in heaps."  
<P>
"In heaps," said my uncle softly, with his glasses very oblique.
<P>
"You're only fit for the grocery," said Gordon-Nasmyth
scornfully, sitting down and helping himself to one of my uncle's
cigars.  "I'm sorry I came.  But, still, now I'm here.... And
first as to quap; quap, sir, is the most radio-active stuff in
the world.  That's quap! It's a festering mass of earths and
heavy metals, polonium, radium, ythorium, thorium, carium, and
new things, too.  There's a stuff called Xk--provisionally. 
There they are, mucked up together in a sort of rotting sand. 
What it is, how it got made, I don't know.  It's like as if some
young creator had been playing about there.  There it lies in two
heaps, one small, one great, and the world for miles about it is
blasted and scorched and dead.  You can have it for the getting. 
You've got to take it--that's all!" 
<P>
"That sounds all right," said I.  "Have you samples?" 
<P>
"Well--should I?  You can have anything--up to two ounces."  
<P>
"Where is it?"...
<P>
His blue eye smiled at me and scrutinised me.  He smoked and was
fragmentary for a time, fending off my questions; then his story
began to piece itself together.  He conjured up a vision of this
strange forgotten kink in the world's littoral, of the long
meandering channels that spread and divaricate and spend their
burden of mud and silt within the thunderbelt of Atlantic surf,
of the dense tangled vegetation that creeps into the shimmering
water with root and sucker.  He gave a sense of heat and a
perpetual reek of vegetable decay, and told how at last comes a
break among these things, an arena fringed with bone-white dead
trees, a sight of the hard-blue sea line beyond the dazzling
surf and a wide desolation of dirty shingle and mud, bleached and
scarred.... A little way off among charred dead weeds stands the
abandoned station,--abandoned because every man who stayed two
months at that station stayed to die, eaten up mysteriously like
a leper with  its dismantled sheds and its decaying pier of
wormrotten and oblique piles and planks, still insecurely
possible.
<P>
And in the midst, two clumsy heaps shaped like the backs of hogs,
one small, one great, sticking out under a rib of rock that cuts
the space across,--quap!
<P>
"There it is," said Gordon-Nasmyth, "worth three pounds an
ounce, if it's worth a penny; two great heaps of it, rotten stuff
and soft, ready to shovel and wheel, and you may get it by the
ton!" 
<P>
"How did it get there?" 
<P>
"God knows! ... There it is--for the taking!  In a country where
you mustn't trade.  In a country where the company waits for good
kind men to find it riches and then take 'em away from 'em. 
There you have it--derelict."  
<P>
"Can't you do any sort of deal?" 
<P>
"They're too damned stupid.  You've got to go and take it. 
That's all."  
<P>
"They might catch you."  
<P>
"They might, of course.  But they're not great at catching."
<P>
We went into the particulars of that difficulty.  "They wouldn't
catch me, because I'd sink first.  Give me a yacht," said
Gordon-Nasmyth; "that's all I need."  
<P>
"But if you get caught," said my uncle.
<P>
I am inclined to think Gordon-Nasmyth imagined we would give him
a cheque for six thousand pounds on the strength of his talk.  It
was very good talk, but we didn't do that.  I stipulated for
samples of his stuff for analysis, and he consented--reluctantly.
<P>
I think, on the whole, he would rather I didn't examine samples.
He made a motion pocketwards, that gave us an invincible 
persuasion that he had a sample upon him, and that at the last
instant he decided not to produce it prematurely.
<P>
There was evidently a curious strain of secretiveness in him.  He
didn't like to give us samples, and he wouldn't indicate within
three hundred miles the position of this Mordet Island of his. 
He had it clear in his mind that he had a secret of immense
value, and he had no idea at all of just how far he ought to go
with business people.  And so presently, to gain time for these
hesitations of his, he began to talk of other things.   He talked
very well.  He talked of the Dutch East Indies and of the Congo,
of Portuguese East Africa and Paraguay, of Malays and rich
Chinese merchants, Dyaks and negroes and the spread of the
Mahometan world in Africa to-day.  And all this time he was
trying to judge if we were good enough to trust with his
adventure.  Our cosy inner office became a little place, and all
our business cold and lifeless exploits beside his glimpses of
strange minglings of men, of slayings unavenged  and curious
customs, of trade where no writs run, and the dark treacheries of
eastern ports and uncharted channels.
<P>
We had neither of us gone abroad except for a few vulgar raids on
Paris; our world was England, are the places of origin of half
the raw material of the goods we sold had seemed to us as remote
as fairyland or the forest of Arden.  But Gordon-Nasmyth made it
so real and intimate for us that afternoon--for me, at any
rate--that it seemed like something seen and forgotten and now
again remembered.
<P>
And in the end he produced his sample, a little lump of muddy
clay speckled with brownish grains, in a glass bottle wrapped
about with lead and flannel--red flannel it was, I remember--a
hue which is, I know, popularly supposed to double all the
mystical efficacies of flannel.
<P>
"Don't carry it about on you," said Gordon-Nasmyth.  "It makes
a sore."  
<P>
I took the stuff to Thorold, and Thorold had the exquisite agony
of discovering two new elements in what was then a confidential
analysis.  He has christened them and published since, but at the
time Gordon-Nasmyth wouldn't hear for a moment of our publication
of any facts at all; indeed, he flew into a violent passion and
abused me mercilessly even for showing the stuff to Thorold.  "I
thought you were going to analyse it yourself," he said with the
touching persuasion of the layman that a scientific man knows and
practises at the sciences.
<P>
I made some commercial inquiries, and there seemed even then much
truth in Gordon-Nasmyth's estimate of the value of the stuff. 
It was before the days of Capern's discovery of the value of
canadium and his use of it in the Capern filament, but the cerium
and thorium alone were worth the money he extracted for the
gas-mantles then in vogue.  There were, however, doubts.  Indeed,
there were numerous doubts.  What were the limits of the
gas-mantle trade?  How much thorium, not to speak of cerium,
could they take at a maximum.  Suppose that quantity was high
enough to justify our shipload, came doubts in another quarter.
Were the heaps up to sample?  Were they as big as he said?  Was
Gordon-Nasmyth--imaginative?  And if these values held, could we
after all get the stuff?  It wasn't ours.  It was on forbidden
ground.  You see, there were doubts of every grade and class in
the way of this adventure.
<P>
We went some way, nevertheless, in the discussion of his project,
though I think we tried his patience.  Then suddenly he vanished
from London, and I saw no more of him for a year and a half.
<P>
My uncle said that was what he had expected, and when at last
Gordon-Nasmyth reappeared and mentioned in an incidental way
that he had been to Paraguay on private (and we guessed
passionate) affairs, the business of the "quap" expedition had to
be begun again at the beginning.  My uncle was disposed to be
altogether sceptical, but I wasn't so decided.  I think I was
drawn by its picturesque aspects.  But we neither of us dreamt of
touching it seriously until Capern's discovery.
<P>
Nasmyth's story had laid hold of my imagination like one small,
intense picture of tropical sunshine hung on a wall of grey
business affairs.  I kept it going during Gordon-Nasmyth's
intermittent appearances in England.  Every now and then he and I
would meet and reinforce its effect.  We would lunch in London,
or he would cone to see my gliders at Crest Hill, and make new
projects for getting at those heaps again now with me, now alone.
<P>
At times they became a sort of fairy-story with us, an
imaginative exercise.  And there came Capern's discovery of what
he called the ideal filament and with it an altogether less
problematical quality about the business side of quap.  For the
ideal filament needed five per cent. of canadium, and canadium
was known to the world only as a newly separated constituent of a
variety of the rare mineral rutile.  But to Thorold it was better
known as an element in a mysterious sample brought to him by me,
and to me it was known as one of the elements in quap.  I told my
uncle, and we jumped on to the process at once.  We found that
Gordon-Nasmyth, still unaware of the altered value of the stuff,
and still thinking of the experimental prices of radium and the
rarity value of cerium, had got hold of a cousin named Pollack,
made some extraordinary transaction about his life insurance
policy, and was buying a brig.  We put in, put down three
thousand pounds, and forthwith the life insurance transaction and
the Pollack side of this finance vanished into thin air, leaving
Pollack, I regret to say, in the brig and in the secret--except
so far as canadium and the filament went--as residuum.  We
discussed earnestly whether we should charter a steamer or go on
with the brig, but we decided on the brig as a less conspicuous
instrument for an enterprise that was after all, to put it
plainly, stealing.
<P>
But that was one of our last enterprises before our great crisis,
and I will tell of it in its place.
<P>
So it was quap came into our affairs, came in as a fairy-tale
and became real.  More and more real it grew until at last it was
real, until at last I saw with my eyes the heaps my imagination
had seen for so long, and felt between my fingers again that
half-gritty, half soft texture of quap, like sanded moist-sugar
mixed with clay in which there stirs something--
<P>
One must feel it to understand.
<P>
V
<P>
All sorts of things came to the Hardingham and offered themselves
to my uncle.  Gordon-Nasmyth stands but only because he played a
part at last in the crisis of our fortunes.  So much came to us
that it seemed to me at times as though the whole world of human
affairs was ready to prostitute itself to our real and imaginary
millions.  As I look back, I am still dazzled and incredulous to
think of the quality of our opportunities.
<P>
We did the most extraordinary things; things that it seems absurd
to me to leave to any casual man of wealth and enterprise who
cares to do them.  I had some amazing perceptions of just how
modern thought and the supply of fact to the general mind may be
controlled by money.  Among other things that my uncle offered
for, he tried very hard to buy the British Medical Journal and
the Lancet, and run them on what he called modern lines, and
when they resisted him he talked very vigorously for a time of
organising a rival enterprise.  That was a very magnificent idea
indeed in its way; it would have given a tremendous advantage in
the handling of innumerable specialties and indeed I scarcely
know how far it would not have put the medical profession in our
grip.  It still amazes me--I shall die amazed--that such a thing
can be possible in the modern state.  If my uncle failed to bring
the thing off, some one else may succeed.  But I doubt, even if
he had got both these weeklies, whether his peculiar style would
have suited them.  The change of purpose would have shown.  He
would have found it difficult to keep up their dignity.
<P>
He certainly did not keep up the dignity of the Sacred Grove,
an important critical organ which he acquired one day--by saying
"snap"--for eight hundred pounds.  He got it "lock, stock and
barrel"--under one or other of which three aspects the editor was
included.  Even at that price it didn't pay.  If you are a
literary person you will remember the bright new cover he gave
that representative organ of British intellectual culture, and
how his sound business instincts jarred with the exalted
pretensions of a vanishing age. One old wrapper I discovered the
other day runs:--

   THE BEST PILL IN THE WORLD FOR AN IRREGULAR LIVER
<P>
<P>
I suppose it is some lingering traces of the Bladesover tradition
to me that makes this combination of letters and pills seem so
incongruous, just as I suppose it is a lingering trace of
Plutarch and my ineradicable boyish imagination that at bottom
our State should be wise, sane and dignified, that makes me think
a country which leaves its medical and literary criticism, or
indeed any such vitally important criticism, entirely to private
enterprise and open to the advances of any purchaser must be in a
frankly hopeless condition.  These are ideal conceptions of mine.
<P>
As a matter of fact, nothing would be more entirely natural and
representative of the relations of learning, thought and the
economic situation in the world at the present time than this
cover of the Sacred Grove--the quiet conservatism of the one
element embedded in the aggressive brilliance of the other; the
contrasted notes of bold physiological experiment  and extreme
mental immobility.
<P>

<P>
There comes back, too, among these Hardingham memories, an
impression of a drizzling November day, and how we looked out of
the windows upon a procession of the London unemployed.
<P>
It was like looking down a well into some momentarily revealed
nether world.  Some thousands of needy ineffectual men had been
raked together to trail their spiritless misery through the West
Eire with an appeal that was also in its way a weak and
insubstantial threat: "It is Work we need, not Charity."  
<P>
There they were, half-phantom through the fog, a silent,
foot-dragging, interminable, grey procession. They carried wet,
dirty banners, they rattled boxes for pence; these men who had
not said "snap" in the right place, the men who had "snapped" too
eagerly, the men who had never said "snap," the men who had never
had a chance of saying "snap."  A shambling, shameful stream they
made, oozing along the street, the gutter waste of competitive
civilisation.  And we stood high out of it all, as high as if we
looked godlike from another world, standing in a room beautifully
lit and furnished, skillfully warmed, filled with costly things.
<P>
"There," thought I, "but for the grace of God, go George and
Edward Ponderevo."  
<P>
But my uncle's thoughts ran in a different channel, and he made
that vision the test of a spirited but inconclusive harangue upon
Tariff Reform.
