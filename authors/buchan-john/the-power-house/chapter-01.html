<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It all started one afternoon, early in May, when I came out of
the House of Commons with Tommy Deloraine.  I had got in by an
accident at a by-election, when I was supposed to be fighting
a forlorn hope, and as I was just beginning to be busy at the
Bar I found my hands pretty full.  It was before Tommy succeeded,
in the days when he sat for the family seat in Yorkshire, and
that afternoon he was in a powerful bad temper.  Out of doors
it was jolly spring weather, there was greenery in Parliament
Square and bits of gay colour, and a light wind was blowing up
from the river.  Inside a dull debate was winding on, and an advertising
member had been trying to get up a row with the Speaker.  The
contrast between the frowsy place and the cheerful world outside
would have impressed even the soul of a Government Whip.</p>

<p>Tommy sniffed the spring breeze like a supercilious stag.</p>

<p>"This about finishes me," he groaned.  "What a juggins I am to
be mouldering here!  Joggleberry is the celestial limit, what
they call in happier lands the pink penultimate.  And the frowst
on those back benches!  Was there ever such a moth-eaten old museum?"</p>

<p>"It is the Mother of Parliaments," I observed.</p>

<p>"Damned monkey-house," said Tommy.  "I must get off for a bit,
or I'll bonnet Joggleberry or get up and propose a national monument
to Guy Fawkes, or something silly."</p>

<p>I did not see him for a day or two, and then one morning he rang
me up and peremptorily summoned me to dine with him.  I went,
knowing very well what I should find.  Tommy was off next day
to shoot lions on the Equator, or something equally unconscientious. 
He was a bad acquaintance for a placid sedentary soul like me,
for though he could work like a Trojan when the fit took him,
he was never at the same job very long.  In the same week he would
harass an Under Secretary about horses for the Army, write voluminously
to the press about a gun he had invented for potting aeroplanes,
give a fancy-dress ball which he forgot to attend, and get into
the semi-final of the racquets championship.  I waited daily to
see him start a new religion.</p>

<p>That night, I recollect, he had an odd assortment of guests. 
A Cabinet Minister was there, a gentle being for whom Tommy professed
public scorn and private affection; a sailor; an Indian cavalry
fellow; Chapman, the Labour member, whom Tommy called Chipmunk;
myself, and old Milson of the Treasury.  Our host was in tremendous
form, chaffing everybody, and sending Chipmunk into great rolling
gusts of merriment.  The two lived adjacent in Yorkshire, and
on platforms abused each other like pickpockets.</p>

<p>Tommy enlarged on the misfits of civilised life.  He maintained
that none of us, except perhaps the sailor and the cavalryman,
were at our proper job.  He would have had Wytham&mdash;that was the
Minister&mdash;a cardinal of the Roman Church, and he said that Milson
should have been the Warden of a college full of port and prejudice. 
Me he was kind enough to allocate to some reconstructed Imperial
General Staff, merely because I had a craze for military history. 
Tommy's perception did not go very deep.  He told Chapman he should
have been a lumberman in California.  "You'd have made an uncommon
good logger, Chipmunk, and you know you're a dashed bad politician."</p>

<p>When questioned about himself he became reticent, as the newspapers
say.  "I doubt if I'm much good at any job," he confessed, "except
to ginger up my friends.  Anyhow, I'm getting out of this hole. 
Paired for the rest of the session with a chap who has lockjaw. 
I'm off to stretch my legs and get back my sense of proportion."</p>

<p>Some one asked him where he was going, and was told "Venezuela,
to buy Government bonds and look for birds' nests."</p>

<p>Nobody took Tommy seriously, so his guests did not trouble to
bid him the kind of farewell a prolonged journey would demand. 
But when the others had gone, and we were sitting in the little
back smoking-room on the first floor, he became solemn.  Portentously
solemn, for he wrinkled up his brows and dropped his jaw in the
way he had when he fancied he was in earnest.</p>

<p>"I've taken on a queer job, Leithen," he said, "and I want you
to hear about it.  None of my family know, and I would like to
leave some one behind me who could get on to my tracks if things
got troublesome."</p>

<p>I braced myself for some preposterous confidence, for I was experienced
in Tommy's vagaries.  But I own to being surprised when he asked
me if I remembered Pitt-Heron.</p>

<p>I remembered Pitt-Heron very well.  He had been at Oxford with
me, but he was no great friend of mine, though for about two years
Tommy and he had been inseparable.  He had had a prodigious reputation
for cleverness with everybody but the college authorities, and
used to spend his vacations doing mad things in the Alps and the
Balkans and writing about them in the half-penny press.  He was
enormously rich&mdash;cotton mills and Liverpool ground rents&mdash;and,
being without a father, did pretty much what his fantastic taste
dictated.  He was rather a hero for a bit after he came down,
for he had made some wild journey in the neighbourhood of Afghanistan
and written an exciting book about it.</p>

<p>Then he married a pretty cousin of Tommy's, who happened to be
the only person that ever captured my stony heart, and settled
down in London.  I did not go to their house, and soon I found
that very few of his friends saw much of him, either.  His travels
and magazine articles suddenly stopped, and I put it down to the
common course of successful domesticity.  Apparently I was wrong.</p>

<p>"Charles Pitt-Heron," said Tommy, "is blowing up for a most thundering
mess."</p>

<p>I asked what kind of mess, and Tommy said he didn't know.  "That's
the mischief of it.  You remember the wild beggar he used to be,
always off on the spree to the Mountains of the Moon, or somewhere.
Well, he has been damping down his fires lately and trying to
behave like a respectable citizen, but God knows what he has been
thinking! I go a good deal to Portman Square, and all last year
he has been getting queerer."</p>

<p>Questions as to the nature of the queerness only elicited the
fact that Pitt-Heron had taken to science with some enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"He has got a laboratory at the back of the house&mdash;used to be
the billiard-room&mdash;where he works away half the night.  And Lord! 
The crew you meet there!  Every kind of heathen &mdash;Chinese
and Turks, and long-haired chaps from Russia, and fat Germans. 
I've several times blundered into the push.  They've all got an
odd secretive air about them, and Charlie is becoming like them. 
He won't answer a plain question or look you straight in the face. 
Ethel sees it, too, and she has often talked to me about it."</p>

<p>I said I saw no harm in such a hobby.</p>

<p>"I do," said Tommy grimly.  "Anyhow, the fellow has bolted."</p>

<p>"What on earth&#11834;" I began, but was cut short.</p>

<p>"Bolted without a word to a mortal soul.  He told Ethel he would
be home for luncheon yesterday, and never came.  His man knew
nothing about him, hadn't packed for him, or anything; but he
found he had stuffed some things into a kit-bag and gone out by
the back through the mews.  Ethel was in terrible straits, and
sent for me, and I ranged all yesterday afternoon like a wolf
on the scent.  I found he had drawn a biggish sum in gold from
the bank, but I couldn't find any trace of where he had gone.</p>

<p>"I was just setting out for Scotland Yard this morning, when
Tomlin, the valet, rang me up and said he had found a card in
the waistcoat of the dress clothes that Charles had worn the night
before he left. It had a name on it like Konalevsky, and it struck
me that they might know something about the business at the Russian
Embassy.  Well, I went round there, and the long and short of
it was that I found there was a fellow of that name among the
clerks.  I saw him, and he said he had gone to see Mr. Pitt-Heron
two days before with a letter from some Embassy chap.  Unfortunately,
the man in question had gone off to New York next day, but Konalevsky
told me one thing which helped to clear up matters.  It seemed
that the letter had been one of those passports that Embassies
give to their friends&mdash;a higher-powered sort than the ordinary
make&mdash;and Konalevsky gathered from something he had heard that
Charles was aiming for Moscow."</p>

<p>Tommy paused to let his news sink in.</p>

<p>"Well, that was good enough for me.  I'm off to-morrow to run
him to ground."</p>

<p>"But why shouldn't a man go to Moscow if he wants?" I said feebly.</p>

<p>"You don't understand," said the sage Tommy.  "You don't know
old Charles as I know him.  He's got into a queer set, and there's
no knowing what mischief he's up to.  He's perfectly capable of
starting a revolution in Armenia or somewhere merely to see how
it feels like to be a revolutionary.  That's the damned thing
about the artistic temperament.  Anyhow, he's got to chuck it. 
I won't have Ethel scared to death by his whims.  I am going to
hale him back from Moscow, even if I have to pretend he's an escaped
lunatic.  He's probably like enough one by this time if he has
taken no clothes."</p>

<p>I have forgotten what I said, but it was some plea for caution. 
I could not see the reason for these heroics.  Pitt-Heron did
not interest me greatly, and the notion of Tommy as a defender
of the hearth amused me.  I thought that he was working on very
slight evidence and would probably make a fool of himself.</p>

<p>"It's only another of the man's fads," I said.  "He never could
do things like an ordinary mortal.  What possible trouble could
there be?  Money?"</p>

<p>"Rich as Croesus," said Tommy.</p>

<p>"A woman?"</p>

<p>"Blind as a bat to female beauty."</p>

<p>"The wrong side of the law?"</p>

<p>"Don't think so.  He could settle any ordinary scrape with a
cheque."</p>

<p>"Then I give it up.  Whatever it is it looks as if Pitt-Heron
would have a companion in misfortune before you are done with
the business. I'm all for your taking a holiday, for at present
you are a nuisance to your friends and a disgrace to your country's
legislature.  But for goodness' sake curb your passion for romance. 
They don't like it in Russia."</p>

<p>Next morning Tommy turned up to see me in Chambers.  The prospect
of travel always went to his head like wine.  He was in wild spirits,
and had forgotten his anger at the defaulting Pitt-Heron in gratitude
for his provision of an occupation.  He talked of carrying him
off to the Caucasus when he had found him, to investigate the
habits of the Caucasian stag.</p>

<p>I remember the scene as if it were yesterday.  It was a hot May
morning, and the sun which came through the dusty window in Fountain
Court lit up the dust and squalor of my working chambers.  I was
pretty busy at the time, and my table was well-nourished with
briefs. Tommy picked up one and began to read it.  It was about
a new drainage scheme in West Ham.  He tossed it down and looked
at me pityingly.</p>

<p>"Poor old beggar!" he said.  "To spend your days on such work
when the world is chockful of amusing things.  Life goes roaring
by and you only hear the echo in your stuffy rooms.  You can hardly
see the sun for the cobwebs on these windows of yours.  Charles
is a fool, but I'm blessed if he isn't wiser than you.  Don't
you wish you were coming with me?"</p>

<p>The queer thing was that I did.  I remember the occasion, as
I have said, for it was one of the few on which I have had a pang
of dissatisfaction with the calling I had chosen.  As Tommy's
footsteps grew faint on the stairs I suddenly felt as if I were
missing something, as if somehow I were out of it.  It is an unpleasant
feeling, even when you know that the thing you are out of is foolishness.</p>

<p>Tommy went off at 11 from Victoria, and my work was pretty well
ruined for the day.  I felt oddly restless, and the cause was
not merely Tommy's departure.  My thoughts kept turning to the
Pitt-Herons&mdash;chiefly to Ethel, that adorable child unequally yoked
to a perverse egoist, but a good deal to the egoist himself. 
I have never suffered much from whimsies, but I suddenly began
to feel a curious interest in the business, an unwilling interest,
for I found it in my heart to regret my robust scepticism of the
night before. And it was more than interest.  I had a sort of
presentiment that I was going to be mixed up in the affair more
than I wanted.  I told myself angrily that the life of an industrious
common-law barrister could have little to do with the wanderings
of two maniacs in Muscovy.  But, try as I might, I could not get
rid of the obsession. That night it followed me into my dreams,
and I saw myself with a knout coercing Tommy and Pitt-Heron in
a Russian fortress which faded away into the Carlton Hotel.</p>

<p>Next afternoon I found my steps wending in the direction of Portman
Square.  I lived at the time in Down Street, and I told myself
I would be none the worse of a walk in the Park before dinner. 
I had a fancy to see Mrs. Pitt-Heron, for, though I had only met
her twice since her marriage, there had been a day when we were
the closest of friends.</p>

<p>I found her alone, a perplexed and saddened lady with imploring
eyes. Those eyes questioned me as to how much I knew.  I told
her presently that I had seen Tommy and was aware of his errand. 
I was moved to add that she might count on me if there were anything
she wished done on this side of the Channel.</p>

<p>She was very little changed.  There was still the old exquisite
slimness, the old shy courtesy.  But she told me nothing.  Charles
was full of business and becoming very forgetful.  She was sure
the Russian journey was all a stupid mistake.  He probably thought
he had told her of his departure.  He would write; she expected
a letter by every post.</p>

<p>But her haggard eyes belied her optimism.  I could see that there
had been odd happenings of late in the Pitt-Heron household. 
She either knew or feared something&mdash;the latter, I thought, for
her air was more of apprehension than of painful enlightenment.</p>

<p>I did not stay long, and, as I walked home, I had an awkward
feeling that I had intruded.  Also I was increasingly certain
that there was trouble brewing, and that Tommy had more warrant
for his journey than I had given him credit for.  I cast my mind
back to gather recollections of Pitt-Heron, but all I could find
was an impression of a brilliant uncomfortable being, who had
been too fond of the byways of life for my sober tastes.  There
was nothing crooked in him in the wrong sense, but there might
be a good deal that was perverse. I remember consoling myself
with the thought that, though he might shatter his wife's nerves
by his vagaries, he would scarcely break her heart.</p>

<p>To be watchful, I decided, was my business.  And I could not
get rid of the feeling that I might soon have cause for all my
vigilance.</p>
