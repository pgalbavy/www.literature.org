<p>Flame-lurid his face as he turned among the throng of flame-lit and dark
faces upon the platform. In the light of the furnace she caught sight of
his drifting countenance, like a piece of floating fire. And the
nostalgia, the doom of homecoming went through her veins like a drug. His
eternal face, flame-lit now! The pulse and darkness of red fire from the
furnace towers in the sky, lighting the desultory, industrial crowd on
the wayside station, lit him and went out.</p>

<p>Of course he did not see her. Flame-lit and unseeing! Always the same,
with his meeting eyebrows, his common cap, and his red-and-black scarf
knotted round his throat. Not even a collar to meet her! The flames had
sunk, there was shadow.</p>

<p>She opened the door of her grimy, branch-line carriage, and began to get
down her bags. The porter was nowhere, of course, but there was Harry,
obscure, on the outer edge of the little crowd, missing her, of course.</p>

<p>'Here! Harry!' she called, waving her umbrella in the twilight. He
hurried forward.</p>

<p>'Tha's come, has ter?' he said, in a sort of cheerful welcome. She got
down, rather flustered, and gave him a peck of a kiss.</p>

<p>'Two suit-cases!' she said.</p>

<p>Her soul groaned within her, as he clambered into the carriage after her
bags. Up shot the fire in the twilight sky, from the great furnace behind
the station. She felt the red flame go across her face. She had come
back, she had come back for good. And her spirit groaned dismally. She
doubted if she could bear it.</p>

<p>There, on the sordid little station under the furnaces, she stood, tall
and distinguished, in her well-made coat and skirt and her broad grey
velour hat. She held her umbrella, her bead chatelaine, and a little
leather case in her grey-gloved hands, while Harry staggered out of the
ugly little train with her bags.</p>

<p>'There's a trunk at the back,' she said in her bright voice. But she was
not feeling bright. The twin black cones of the iron foundry blasted
their sky-high fires into the night. The whole scene was lurid. The train
waited cheerfully. It would wait another ten minutes. She knew it. It was
all so deadly familiar.</p>

<p>Let us confess it at once. She was a lady's maid, thirty years old, come
back to marry her first-love, a foundry worker: after having kept him
dangling, off and on, for a dozen years. Why had she come back? Did she
love him? No. She didn't pretend to. She had loved her brilliant and
ambitious cousin, who had jilted her, and who had died. She had had other
affairs which had come to nothing. So here she was, come back suddenly to
marry her first-love, who had waited - or remained single - all these
years.</p>

<p>'Won't a porter carry those?' she said, as Harry strode with his
workman's stride down the platform towards the guard's van.</p>

<p>'I can manage,' he said.</p>

<p>And with her umbrella, her chatelaine, and her little leather case, she
followed him.</p>

<p>The trunk was there.</p>

<p>'We'll get Heather's greengrocer's cart to fetch it up,' he said.</p>

<p>'Isn't there a cab?' said Fanny, knowing dismally enough that there
wasn't.</p>

<p>'I'll just put it aside o' the penny-in-the-slot, and Heather's
greengrocers'll fetch it about half past eight,' he said.</p>

<p>He seized the box by its two handles and staggered with it across the
level-crossing, bumping his legs against it as he waddled. Then he
dropped it by the red sweet-meats machine.</p>

<p>'Will it be safe there?' she said.</p>

<p>'Ay - safe as houses,' he answered. He returned for the two bags. Thus
laden, they started to plod up the hill, under the great long black
building of the foundry. She walked beside him - workman of workmen he
was, trudging with that luggage. The red lights flared over the deepening
darkness. From the foundry came the horrible, slow clang, clang, clang of
iron, a great noise, with an interval just long enough to make it
unendurable.</p>

<p>Compare this with the arrival at Gloucester: the carriage for her
mistress, the dog-cart for herself with the luggage; the drive out past
the river, the pleasant trees of the carriage-approach; and herself
sitting beside Arthur, everybody so polite to her.</p>

<p>She had come home - for good! Her heart nearly stopped beating as she
trudged up that hideous and interminable hill, beside the laden figure.
What a come-down! What a come-down! She could not take it with her usual
bright cheerfulness. She knew it all too well. It is easy to bear up
against the unusual, but the deadly familiarity of an old stale past!</p>

<p>He dumped the bags down under a lamp-post, for a rest. There they stood,
the two of them, in the lamplight. Passers-by stared at her, and gave
good-night to Harry. Her they hardly knew, she had become a stranger.</p>

<p>'They're too heavy for you, let me carry one,' she said.</p>

<p>'They begin to weigh a bit by the time you've gone a mile,' he answered.</p>

<p>'Let me carry the little one,' she insisted.</p>

<p>'Tha can ha'e it for a minute, if ter's a mind,' he said, handing over
the valise.</p>

<p>And thus they arrived in the streets of shops of the little ugly town on
top of the hill. How everybody stared at her; my word, how they stared!
And the cinema was just going in, and the queues were tailing down the
road to the corner. And everybody took full stock of her. 'Night, Harry!'
shouted the fellows, in an interested voice.</p>

<p>However, they arrived at her aunt's - a little sweet-shop in a side
street. They 'pinged' the door-bell, and her aunt came running forward
out of the kitchen.</p>

<p>'There you are, child! Dying for a cup of tea, I'm sure. How are you?'</p>

<p>Fanny's aunt kissed her, and it was all Fanny could do to refrain from
bursting into tears, she felt so low. Perhaps it was her tea she wanted.</p>

<p>'You've had a drag with that luggage,' said Fanny's aunt to Harry.</p>

<p>'Ay - I'm not sorry to put it down,' he said, looking at his hand which
was crushed and cramped by the bag handle.</p>

<p>Then he departed to see about Heather's greengrocery cart.</p>

<p>When Fanny sat at tea, her aunt, a grey-haired, fair-faced little woman,
looked at her with an admiring heart, feeling bitterly sore for her. For
Fanny was beautiful: tall, erect, finely coloured, with her delicately
arched nose, her rich brown hair, her large lustrous grey eyes. A
passionate woman - a woman to be afraid of. So proud, so inwardly violent!
She came of a violent race.</p>

<p>It needed a woman to sympathize with her. Men had not the courage. Poor
Fanny! She was such a lady, and so straight and magnificent. And yet
everything seemed to do her down. Every time she seemed to be doomed to
humiliation and disappointment, this handsome, brilliantly sensitive
woman, with her nervous, overwrought laugh.</p>

<p>'So you've really come back, child?' said her aunt.</p>

<p>'I really have, Aunt,' said Fanny.</p>

<p>'Poor Harry! I'm not sure, you know, Fanny, that you're not taking a bit
of an advantage of him.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Aunt, he's waited so long, he may as well have what he's waited
for.' Fanny laughed grimly.</p>

<p>'Yes, child, he's waited so long, that I'm not sure it isn't a bit hard
on him. You know, I <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">like</span> him, Fanny - though as you know quite well, I
don't think he's good enough for you. And I think he thinks so himself,
poor fellow.'</p>

<p>'Don't you be so sure of that, Aunt. Harry is common, but he's not
humble. He wouldn't think the Queen was any too good for him, if he'd a
mind to her.'</p>

<p>'Well - It's as well if he has a proper opinion of himself.'</p>

<p>'It depends what you call proper,' said Fanny. 'But he's got his good
points - '</p>

<p>'Oh, he's a nice fellow, and I like him, I do like him. Only, as I tell
you, he's not good enough for you.'</p>

<p>'I've made up my mind, Aunt,' said Fanny, grimly.</p>

<p>'Yes,' mused the aunt. 'They say all things come to him who waits - '</p>

<p>'More than he's bargained for, eh, Aunt?' laughed Fanny rather bitterly.</p>

<p>The poor aunt, this bitterness grieved her for her niece.</p>

<p>They were interrupted by the ping of the shop-bell, and Harry's call of
'Right!' But as he did not come in at once, Fanny, feeling solicitous for
him presumably at the moment, rose and went into the shop. She saw a cart
outside, and went to the door.</p>

<p>And the moment she stood in the doorway, she heard a woman's common
vituperative voice crying from the darkness of the opposite side of the
road:</p>

<p>'Tha'rt theer, ar ter? I'll shame thee, Mester. I'll shame thee, see if I
dunna.'</p>

<p>Startled, Fanny stared across the darkness, and saw a woman in a black
bonnet go under one of the lamps up the side street.</p>

<p>Harry and Bill Heather had dragged the trunk off the little dray, and she
retreated before them as they came up the shop step with it.</p>

<p>'Wheer shalt ha'e it?' asked Harry.</p>

<p>'Best take it upstairs,' said Fanny.</p>

<p>She went up first to light the gas.</p>

<p>When Heather had gone, and Harry was sitting down having tea and pork
pie, Fanny asked:</p>

<p>'Who was that woman shouting?'</p>

<p>'Nay, I canna tell thee. To somebody, Is'd think,' replied Harry. Fanny
looked at him, but asked no more.</p>

<p>He was a fair-haired fellow of thirty-two, with a fair moustache. He was
broad in his speech, and looked like a foundry-hand, which he was. But
women always liked him. There was something of a mother's lad about
him - something warm and playful and really sensitive.</p>

<p>He had his attractions even for Fanny. What she rebelled against so
bitterly was that he had no sort of ambition. He was a moulder, but of
very commonplace skill. He was thirty-two years old, and hadn't saved
twenty pounds. She would have to provide the money for the home. He
didn't care. He just didn't care. He had no initiative at all. He had no
vices - no obvious ones. But he was just indifferent, spending as he went,
and not caring. Yet he did not look happy. She remembered his face in the
fire-glow: something haunted, abstracted about it. As he sat there eating
his pork pie, bulging his cheek out, she felt he was like a doom to her.
And she raged against the doom of him. It wasn't that he was gross. His
way was common, almost on purpose. But he himself wasn't really common.
For instance, his food was not particularly important to him, he was not
greedy. He had a charm, too, particularly for women, with his blondness
and his sensitiveness and his way of making a woman feel that she was a
higher being. But Fanny knew him, knew the peculiar obstinate limitedness
of him, that would nearly send her mad.</p>

<p>He stayed till about half past nine. She went to the door with him.</p>

<p>'When are you coming up?' he said, jerking his head in the direction,
presumably, of his own home.</p>

<p>'I'll come tomorrow afternoon,' she said brightly. Between Fanny and Mrs.
Goodall, his mother, there was naturally no love lost.</p>

<p>Again she gave him an awkward little kiss, and said good-night.</p>

<p>'You can't wonder, you know, child, if he doesn't seem so very keen,'
said her aunt. 'It's your own fault.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Aunt, I couldn't stand him when he was keen. I can do with him a lot
better as he is.'</p>

<p>The two women sat and talked far into the night. They understood each
other. The aunt, too, had married as Fanny was marrying: a man who was no
companion to her, a violent man, brother of Fanny's father. He was dead,
Fanny's father was dead.</p>

<p>Poor Aunt Lizzie, she cried woefully over her bright niece, when she had
gone to bed.</p>

<p>Fanny paid the promised visit to his people the next afternoon. Mrs.
Goodall was a large woman with smooth-parted hair, a common, obstinate
woman, who had spoiled her four lads and her one vixen of a married
daughter. She was one of those old-fashioned powerful natures that
couldn't do with looks or education or any form of showing off. She
fairly hated the sound of correct English. She <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">thee'd</span> and <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">tha'd</span> her
prospective daughter-in-law, and said:</p>

<p>'I'm none as ormin' as I look, seest ta.'</p>

<p>Fanny did not think her prospective mother-in-law looked at all orming,
so the speech was unnecessary.</p>

<p>'I towd him mysen,' said Mrs. Goodall, ''Er's held back all this long,
let 'er stop as 'er is. 'E'd none ha' had thee for <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">my</span> tellin' - tha
hears. No, 'e's a fool, an' I know it. I says to him, 'Tha looks a man,
doesn't ter, at thy age, goin' an' openin' to her when ter hears her
scrat' at th' gate, after she's done gallivantin' round wherever she'd a
mind. That looks rare an' soft.' But it's no use o' any talking: he
answered that letter o' thine and made his own bad bargain.'</p>

<p>But in spite of the old woman's anger, she was also flattered at Fanny's
coming back to Harry. For Mrs. Goodall was impressed by Fanny - a woman of
her own match. And more than this, everybody knew that Fanny's Aunt Kate
had left her two hundred pounds: this apart from the girl's savings.</p>

<p>So there was high tea in Princes Street when Harry came home black from
work, and a rather acrid odour of cordiality, the vixen Jinny darting in
to say vulgar things. Of course Jinny lived in a house whose garden end
joined the paternal garden. They were a clan who stuck together, these
Goodalls.</p>

<p>It was arranged that Fanny should come to tea again on the Sunday, and
the wedding was discussed. It should take place in a fortnight's time at
Morley Chapel. Morley was a hamlet on the edge of the real country, and
in its little Congregational Chapel Fanny and Harry had first met.</p>

<p>What a creature of habit he was! He was still in the choir of Morley
Chapel - not very regular. He belonged just because he had a tenor voice,
and enjoyed singing. Indeed his solos were only spoilt to local fame
because when he sang he handled his aitches so hopelessly.</p>

<p>'And I saw 'eaven hopened
And be'old, a wite 'orse-'</p>

<p>This was one of Harry's classics, only surpassed by the fine outburst of
his heaving:</p>

<p>'Hangels - hever bright an' fair-'</p>

<p>It was a pity, but it was inalterable. He had a good voice, and he sang
with a certain lacerating fire, but his pronunciation made it all funny.
And nothing could alter him.</p>

<p>So he was never heard save at cheap concerts and in the little, poorer
chapels. The others scoffed.</p>

<p>Now the month was September, and Sunday was Harvest Festival at Morley
Chapel, and Harry was singing solos. So that Fanny was to go to afternoon
service, and come home to a grand spread of Sunday tea with him. Poor
Fanny! One of the most wonderful afternoons had been a Sunday afternoon
service, with her cousin Luther at her side, Harvest Festival in Morley
Chapel. Harry had sung solos then - ten years ago. She remembered his pale
blue tie, and the purple asters and the great vegetable marrows in which
he was framed, and her cousin Luther at her side, young, clever, come
down from London, where he was getting on well, learning his Latin and
his French and German so brilliantly.</p>

<p>However, once again it was Harvest Festival at Morley Chapel, and once
again, as ten years before, a soft, exquisite September day, with the
last roses pink in the cottage gardens, the last dahlias crimson, the
last sunflowers yellow. And again the little old chapel was a bower, with
its famous sheaves of corn and corn-plaited pillars, its great bunches of
grapes, dangling like tassels from the pulpit corners, its marrows and
potatoes and pears and apples and damsons, its purple asters and yellow
Japanese sunflowers. Just as before, the red dahlias round the pillars
were dropping, weak-headed among the oats. The place was crowded and hot,
the plates of tomatoes seemed balanced perilously on the gallery front,
the Rev. Enderby was weirder than ever to look at, so long and emaciated
and hairless.</p>

<p>The Rev. Enderby, probably forewarned, came and shook hands with her and
welcomed her, in his broad northern, melancholy singsong before he
mounted the pulpit. Fanny was handsome in a gauzy dress and a beautiful
lace hat. Being a little late, she sat in a chair in the side-aisle
wedged in, right in front of the chapel. Harry was in the gallery above,
and she could only see him from the eyes upwards. She noticed again how
his eyebrows met, blond and not very marked, over his nose. He was
attractive too: physically lovable, very. If only - if only her <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">pride</span>
had not suffered! She felt he dragged her down.</p>

<p>'Come, ye thankful people come,
Raise the song of harvest-home.
All is safely gathered in
Ere the winter storms begin - '</p>

<p>Even the hymn was a falsehood, as the season had been wet, and half the
crops were still out, and in a poor way.</p>

<p>Poor Fanny! She sang little, and looked beautiful through that
inappropriate hymn. Above her stood Harry - mercifully in a dark suit and
dark tie, looking almost handsome. And his lacerating, pure tenor sounded
well, when the words were drowned in the general commotion. Brilliant she
looked, and brilliant she felt, for she was hot and angrily miserable and
inflamed with a sort of fatal despair. Because there was about him a
physical attraction which she really hated, but which she could not
escape from. He was the first man who had ever kissed her. And his
kisses, even while she rebelled from them, had lived in her blood and
sent roots down into her soul. After all this time she had come back to
them. And her soul groaned, for she felt dragged down, dragged down to
earth, as a bird which some dog has got down in the dust. She knew her
life would be unhappy. She knew that what she was doing was fatal. Yet it
was her doom. She had to come back to him.</p>

<p>He had to sing two solos this afternoon: one before the 'address' from
the pulpit and one after. Fanny looked at him, and wondered he was not
too shy to stand up there in front of all the people. But no, he was not
shy. He had even a kind of assurance on his face as he looked down from
the choir gallery at her: the assurance of a common man deliberately
entrenched in his commonness. Oh, such a rage went through her veins as
she saw the air of triumph, laconic, indifferent triumph which sat so
obstinately and recklessly on his eyelids as he looked down at her. Ah,
she despised him! But there he stood up in that choir gallery like
Balaam's ass in front of her, and she could not get beyond him. A certain
winsomeness also about him. A certain physical winsomeness, and as if his
flesh were new and lovely to touch. The thorn of desire rankled bitterly
in her heart.</p>

<p>He, it goes without saying, sang like a canary this particular afternoon,
with a certain defiant passion which pleasantly crisped the blood of the
congregation. Fanny felt the crisp flames go through her veins as she
listened. Even the curious loud-mouthed vernacular had a certain
fascination. But, oh, also, it was so repugnant. He would triumph over
her, obstinately he would drag her right back into the common people: a
doom, a vulgar doom.</p>

<p>The second performance was an anthem, in which Harry sang the solo parts.
It was clumsy, but beautiful, with lovely words.</p>

<p>'They that sow in tears shall reap in joy,
He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed
Shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with
him - '</p>

<p>'Shall doubtless come, Shall doubtless come - ' softly intoned the
altos - 'Bringing his she-e-eaves with him,' the trebles flourished
brightly, and then again began the half-wistful solo:</p>

<p>'They that sow in tears shall reap in joy - '</p>

<p>Yes, it was effective and moving.</p>

<p>But at the moment when Harry's voice sank carelessly down to his close,
and the choir, standing behind him, were opening their mouths for the
final triumphant outburst, a shouting female voice rose up from the body
of the congregation. The organ gave one startled trump, and went silent;
the choir stood transfixed.</p>

<p>'You look well standing there, singing in God's holy house,' came the
loud, angry female shout. Everybody turned electrified. A stoutish,
red-faced woman in a black bonnet was standing up denouncing the soloist.
Almost fainting with shock, the congregation realized it. 'You look well,
don't you, standing there singing solos in God's holy house, you,
Goodall. But I said I'd shame you. You look well, bringing your young
woman here with you, don't you? I'll let her know who she's dealing
with. A scamp as won't take the consequences of what he's done.' The
hard-faced, frenzied woman turned in the direction of Fanny. '<span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">That's</span>
what Harry Goodall is, if you want to know.'</p>

<p>And she sat down again in her seat. Fanny, startled like all the rest,
had turned to look. She had gone white, and then a burning red, under the
attack. She knew the woman: a Mrs. Nixon, a devil of a woman, who beat
her pathetic, drunken, red-nosed second husband, Bob, and her two lanky
daughters, grown-up as they were. A notorious character. Fanny turned
round again, and sat motionless as eternity in her seat.</p>

<p>There was a minute of perfect silence and suspense. The audience was
open-mouthed and dumb; the choir stood like Lot's wife; and Harry, with
his music-sheet, stood there uplifted, looking down with a dumb sort of
indifference on Mrs. Nixon, his face na&iuml;ve and faintly mocking. Mrs.
Nixon sat defiant in her seat, braving them all.</p>

<p>Then a rustle, like a wood when the wind suddenly catches the leaves.
And then the tall, weird minister got to his feet, and in his strong,
bell-like, beautiful voice - the only beautiful thing about him - he said
with infinite mournful pathos:</p>

<p>'Let us unite in singing the last hymn on the hymn-sheet; the last hymn
on the hymn-sheet, number eleven.</p>

<p>'Fair waved the golden corn,
In Canaan's pleasant land.'</p>

<p>The organ tuned up promptly. During the hymn the offertory was taken. And
after the hymn, the prayer.</p>

<p>Mr. Enderby came from Northumberland. Like Harry, he had never been able
to conquer his accent, which was very broad. He was a little simple, one
of God's fools, perhaps, an odd bachelor soul, emotional, ugly, but very
gentle.</p>

<p>'And if, O our dear Lord, beloved Jesus, there should fall a shadow of
sin upon our harvest, we leave it to Thee to judge, for Thou art judge.
We lift our spirits and our sorrow, Jesus, to Thee, and our mouths are
dumb. O, Lord, keep us from forward speech, restrain us from foolish
words and thoughts, we pray Thee, Lord Jesus, who knowest all and judgest
all.'</p>

<p>Thus the minister said in his sad, resonant voice, washed his hands
before the Lord. Fanny bent forward open-eyed during the prayer. She
could see the roundish head of Harry, also bent forward. His face was
inscrutable and expressionless. The shock left her bewildered. Anger
perhaps was her dominating emotion.</p>

<p>The audience began to rustle to its feet, to ooze slowly and excitedly
out of the chapel, looking with wildly-interested eyes at Fanny, at Mrs.
Nixon, and at Harry. Mrs. Nixon, shortish, stood defiant in her pew,
facing the aisle, as if announcing that, without rolling her sleeves up,
she was ready for anybody. Fanny sat quite still. Luckily the people did
not have to pass her. And Harry, with red ears, was making his way
sheepishly out of the gallery. The loud noise of the organ covered all
the downstairs commotion of exit.</p>

<p>The minister sat silent and inscrutable in his pulpit, rather like a
death's-head, while the congregation filed out. When the last lingerers
had unwillingly departed, craning their necks to stare at the still
seated Fanny, he rose, stalked in his hooked fashion down the little
country chapel and fastened the door. Then he returned and sat down by
the silent young woman.</p>

<p>'This is most unfortunate, most unfortunate!' he moaned. 'I am so sorry,
I am so sorry, indeed, indeed, ah, indeed!' he sighed himself to a close.</p>

<p>'It's a sudden surprise, that's one thing,' said Fanny brightly.</p>

<p>'Yes - yes - indeed. Yes, a surprise, yes. I don't know the woman, I don't
know her.'</p>

<p>'I know her,' said Fanny. 'She's a bad one.'</p>

<p>'Well! Well!' said the minister. 'I don't know her. I don't understand. I
don't understand at all. But it is to be regretted, it is very much to be
regretted. I am very sorry.'</p>

<p>Fanny was watching the vestry door. The gallery stairs communicated with
the vestry, not with the body of the chapel. She knew the choir members
had been peeping for information.</p>

<p>At last Harry came - rather sheepishly - with his hat in his hand.</p>

<p>'Well!' said Fanny, rising to her feet.</p>

<p>'We've had a bit of an extra,' said Harry.</p>

<p>'I should think so,' said Fanny.</p>

<p>'A most unfortunate circumstance - a most <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">unfortunate</span> circumstance. Do
you understand it, Harry? I don't understand it at all.'</p>

<p>'Ah, I understand it. The daughter's goin' to have a childt, an' 'er lays
it on to me.'</p>

<p>'And has she no occasion to?' asked Fanny, rather censorious.</p>

<p>'It's no more mine than it is some other chap's,' said Harry, looking
aside.</p>

<p>There was a moment of pause.</p>

<p>'Which girl is it?' asked Fanny.</p>

<p>'Annie - the young one - '</p>

<p>There followed another silence.</p>

<p>'I don't think I know them, do I?' asked the minister.</p>

<p>'I shouldn't think so. Their name's Nixon - mother married old Bob for her
second husband. She's a tanger - 's driven the gel to what she is. They
live in Manners Road.'</p>

<p>'Why, what's amiss with the girl?' asked Fanny sharply. 'She was all
right when I knew her.'</p>

<p>'Ay - she's all right. But she's always in an' out o' th' pubs, wi' th'
fellows,' said Harry.</p>

<p>'A nice thing!' said Fanny.</p>

<p>Harry glanced towards the door. He wanted to get out.</p>

<p>'Most distressing, indeed!' The minister slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>'What about tonight, Mr. Enderby?' asked Harry, in rather a small voice.
'Shall you want me?'</p>

<p>Mr. Enderby looked up painedly, and put his hand to his brow. He studied
Harry for some time, vacantly. There was the faintest sort of a
resemblance between the two men.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said. 'Yes, I think. I think we must take no notice, and cause
as little remark as possible.'</p>

<p>Fanny hesitated. Then she said to Harry.</p>

<p>'But <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">will</span> you come?'</p>

<p>He looked at her.</p>

<p>'Ay, I s'll come,' he said.</p>

<p>Then he turned to Mr. Enderby.</p>

<p>'Well, good-afternoon, Mr. Enderby,' he said.</p>

<p>'Good-afternoon, Harry, good-afternoon,' replied the mournful minister.
Fanny followed Harry to the door, and for some time they walked in
silence through the late afternoon.</p>

<p>'And it's yours as much as anybody else's?' she said.</p>

<p>'Ay,' he answered shortly.</p>

<p>And they went without another word, for the long mile or so, till they
came to the corner of the street where Harry lived. Fanny hesitated.
Should she go on to her aunt's? Should she? It would mean leaving all
this, for ever. Harry stood silent.</p>

<p>Some obstinacy made her turn with him along the road to his own home.
When they entered the house-place, the whole family was there, mother and
father and Jinny, with Jinny's husband and children and Harry's two
brothers.</p>

<p>'You've been having yours ears warmed, they tell me,' said Mrs. Goodall
grimly.</p>

<p>'Who telled thee?' asked Harry shortly.</p>

<p>'Maggie and Luke's both been in.'</p>

<p>'You look well, don't you!' said interfering Jinny.</p>

<p>Harry went and hung his hat up, without replying.</p>

<p>'Come upstairs and take your hat off,' said Mrs. Goodall to Fanny, almost
kindly. It would have annoyed her very much if Fanny had dropped her son
at this moment.</p>

<p>'What's 'er say, then?' asked the father secretly of Harry, jerking his
head in the direction of the stairs whence Fanny had disappeared.</p>

<p>'Nowt yet,' said Harry.</p>

<p>'Serve you right if she chucks you now,' said Jinny. 'I'll bet it's right
about Annie Nixon an' you.'</p>

<p>'Tha bets so much,' said Harry.</p>

<p>'Yi - but you can't deny it,' said Jinny.</p>

<p>'I can if I've a mind.'</p>

<p>His father looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>'It's no more mine than it is Bill Bower's, or Ted Slaney's, or six or
seven on 'em,' said Harry to his father.</p>

<p>And the father nodded silently.</p>

<p>'That'll not get you out of it, in court,' said Jinny.</p>

<p>Upstairs Fanny evaded all the thrusts made by his mother, and did not
declare her hand. She tidied her hair, washed her hands, and put the
tiniest bit of powder on her face, for coolness, there in front of Mrs.
Goodall's indignant gaze. It was like a declaration of independence. But
the old woman said nothing.</p>

<p>They came down to Sunday tea, with sardines and tinned salmon and tinned
peaches, besides tarts and cakes. The chatter was general. It concerned
the Nixon family and the scandal.</p>

<p>'Oh, she's a foul-mouthed woman,' said Jinny of Mrs. Nixon. 'She may well
talk about God's holy house, <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">she</span> had. It's first time she's set foot in
it, ever since she dropped off from being converted. She's a devil and
she always was one. Can't you remember how she treated Bob's children,
mother, when we lived down in the Buildings? I can remember when I was a
little girl she used to bathe them in the yard, in the cold, so that
they shouldn't splash the house. She'd half kill them if they made a
mark on the floor, and the language she'd use! And one Saturday I can
remember Garry, that was Bob's own girl, she ran off when her stepmother
was going to bathe her - ran off without a rag of clothes on - can you
remember, mother? And she hid in Smedley's closes - it was the time of
mowing-grass - and nobody could find her. She hid out there all night,
didn't she, mother? Nobody could find her. My word, there was a talk.
They found her on Sunday morning - '</p>

<p>'Fred Coutts threatened to break every bone in the woman's body, if she
touched the children again,' put in the father.</p>

<p>'Anyhow, they frightened her,' said Jinny. 'But she was nearly as bad
with her own two. And anybody can see that she's driven old Bob till he's
gone soft.'</p>

<p>'Ah, soft as mush,' said Jack Goodall. ''E'd never addle a week's wage,
nor yet a day's if th' chaps didn't make it up to him.'</p>

<p>'My word, if he didn't bring her a week's wage, she'd pull his head off,'
said Jinny.</p>

<p>'But a clean woman, and respectable, except for her foul mouth,' said
Mrs. Goodall. 'Keeps to herself like a bull-dog. Never lets anybody come
near the house, and neighbours with nobody.'</p>

<p>'Wanted it thrashed out of her,' said Mr. Goodall, a silent, evasive sort
of man.</p>

<p>'Where Bob gets the money for his drink from is a mystery,' said Jinny.</p>

<p>'Chaps treats him,' said Harry.</p>

<p>'Well, he's got the pair of frightenedest rabbit-eyes you'd wish to see,'
said Jinny.</p>

<p>'Ay, with a drunken man's murder in them, <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> think,' said Mrs. Goodall.</p>

<p>So the talk went on after tea, till it was practically time to start off
to chapel again.</p>

<p>'You'll have to be getting ready, Fanny,' said Mrs. Goodall.</p>

<p>'I'm not going tonight,' said Fanny abruptly. And there was a sudden halt
in the family. 'I'll stop with <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">you</span> tonight, Mother,' she added.</p>

<p>'Best you had, my gel,' said Mrs. Goodall, flattered and assured.</p>
