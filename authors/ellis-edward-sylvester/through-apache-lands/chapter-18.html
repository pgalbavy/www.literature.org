<p>In spite of his great anxiety to learn all there was to be known
about the camp fire, Ned remained where he was for half an hour,
until he had rested somewhat from his severe labor.</p>

<p>The place in which the fire was kindled was elevated, rocky,
uneven, and inclosed by a few stunted trees and undergrowth, so
that while the young scout could catch a glimmer, now and then,
of the fire, he could see nothing more. The only way in which
he could perfect his information was to crawl up still nearer.
This he proceeded to do, using all the care and caution possible,
until, after the lapse of nearly an hour, he reached a point where
his view was unobstructed and perfect.</p>

<p>A severe disappointment awaited him. He saw four Indian warriors
grouped around the fire, their dress, and the peculiar manner
in which they were painted, proving that they belonged to some
tribe other than the Apaches. Three of them were occupied in cutting
up and preparing the carcass of some animal, which they had shot,
while the fourth was on his knees in front of the fire, carefully
doctoring it for culinary purposes.</p>

<p>Succeeding Ned's first feeling of disappointment was an undercurrent
of hope that he was in a fair way to obtain another good meal.</p>

<p>"It isn't likely they'll eat up all they've got," he reflected,
"and I don't suppose they're going to settle down there for life.
All I've got to do, then, is to hang round until they go away,
and then, if I can get the chance, I'll stuff enough to last a
week."</p>

<p>Having made his reconnaissance he withdrew to a more secret place,
where he would not be seen in case some of the warriors should
take a look around before retiring for the night. It was fortunate
that he did so, for he had scarcely crawled away beneath a dense
mass of undergrowth when he made the discovery that he had placed
himself in a curious and singularly dangerous position.</p>

<p>Twice he fancied he heard a faint rustling in the rear of where
he was crouching, and he was puzzled to know what it meant. He
was sharp enough to protect himself from observation from this
direction as well as from the front, and was no more than fairly
secure when he caught the slight sound again, and the next moment
detected the figure of an Indian stealing along, with his gaze
fixed upon the camp fire and the forms around it.</p>

<p>The lad was naturally puzzled to understand the meaning of this.
There was just enough fire light penetrating to where he was to
show him that this redskin belonged to a different tribe from
those in camp. Only a few minutes passed when he caught the glimpse
of another warrior on the left, crouching along in the same manner
as the other. Then followed the softest possible hiss, such as
is made by the disturbed serpent, and, at that moment, the truth
of the whole matter suddenly broke upon Ned Chadmund.</p>

<p>The strange Indians were quietly preparing their supper, unaware
of the fact that, while they were thus employed, a party of Apaches,
their deadly enemies, were closing in upon them. Thus, it was,
too, that, without the knowledge of either side, the lad was directly
between them, where it would seem impossible that he should escape
being involved in the conflict that was rapidly drawing to a head.</p>

<p>There was no hope of withdrawing, for the slightest movement
would be sure to make known his position, and he could only wait,
therefore, the issue of the encounter with an intensity of interest
which it is impossible to imagine. What could be more painfully
interesting, for instance, than to watch the movements of the
strange Indians as they engaged themselves in preparing their
supper, conversing with each other in their grunting fashion,
and to note their unconsciousness that a circle of death was slowly
but surely closing in around them; to know, which they did not
suspect, that the most deadly kind of encounter was close at hand?
The endangered party certainly showed a lack of precaution which
belongs to their people in the most ordinary cases when they went
into camp in this fashion, and left the way open for such a deadly
and fatal assault to be made upon them. It must have been that
while engaged in the chase during the day they had made their
observations, and satisfied themselves that none of their enemies
were in dangerous proximity.</p>

<p>The odor of the cooking meat crept through the bushes to the
nostrils of the hungry lad, who was almost maddened into charging
upon the party himself in quest of some of the brown, crisp, roasting
meat; but he restrained himself, in the hope that the issue of
the unpleasantness would furnish him an opportunity to procure
something for the inner man.</p>

<p>An Indian upon the warpath is as patient as the Esquimau who
watches for a dozen hours beside the airhole, waiting for the
seal to come to the surface. According to all human reasoning,
there was no earthly necessity for any delay upon the part of
the attacking Apaches, and yet, for full an hour longer, they
maneuvered and reconnoitered, without striking a blow. Despite
the tense condition of the lad's nerves, he began to grow drowsy
and weary at the prolonged delay, and had the attack been deferred
a short time longer, he would have dropped into a sound slumber.</p>

<p>The four strange Indians were permitted to finish their supper,
and to engage in a comfortable smoke. This, however, was never
completed. They were stretched out upon the ground in the most
indolent manner imaginable, when several rifles suddenly broke
the stillness, the Apache war whoop rang out with startling power,
and a number of figures charged through the bushes like a horde
of demons, all converging upon the group around the camp fire.
Two of the latter had been instantly killed by the first volley
poured in upon them. The others were wounded, but they were on
their feet in an instant, fighting with the fury of tigers.</p>

<p>The battle was of the hurricane order, the third defender going
down within a minute after the assaulting party closed in about
them. The fourth, who was only slightly hurt seemed to have been
caught at less disadvantage. He was a warrior of wonderful activity
and strength, and used his hunting knife with good effect upon
his first and second assailants with lightening-like quickness.
Then as they began to crowd in upon him faster than he could provide
against he circled his weapon around his head several times, so
as to clear a brief open space, when, with a yell of defiance,
he bounded high in the air, and vanished in the forest, his speed
so amazing that it was vain for any one to think of pursuing him.</p>

<p>The battle ended as abruptly as it began. It was over in an instant,
and the petrified spectator could scarcely realize what had taken
place directly under his own eyes. He lay motionless, peering
through the leaves that shut him in, scarcely daring to breathe
as he watched the movements of the victors. He could scarcely
suppress an exclamation of terror when he recognized among them
his old captor and enemy, Lone Wolf.</p>

<p>"Just think of it," whispered Chadmund. "I have spent hours and
hours, and have traveled night and day to get away from him, and
here he is, within fifty feet of me again. How can I keep him
from seeing my trail again in the morning? It does beat everything
how this thing is getting mixed."</p>

<p>He took heart again, however, when he came to reflect that the
greater part of the night was still before him, that Lone Wolf
had undoubtedly given up all expectation of finding him, and,
by using ordinary caution, he could still keep clear of him.</p>

<p>The Apaches did not remain long upon the scene of the encampment.
The two of their own number that had been killed were lifted up,
and then Lone Wolf and his few intrepid warriors took their departure.
Thus it happened that within fifteen minutes after the first gun
had been fired, and the first yell uttered, the boy found himself
alone upon the scene of the terrible fight. Dreadful as were the
place and the associations, he could not forget that he was nearly
famished, and stealing his way to the fire, he hunted around until
he found enough to satisfy the cravings within. This done, he
made up his mind that it was best for him to do some traveling
during the darkness, without waiting for the rising of the morrow's
sun.</p>
