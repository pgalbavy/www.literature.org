<P>
Anne wakened on the morning of her wedding day to find
the sunshine winking in at the window of the little
porch gable and a September breeze frolicking with her
curtains.
<P>
"I'm so glad the sun will shine on me," she thought happily.
<P>
She recalled the first morning she had wakened in that
little porch room, when the sunshine had crept in on
her through the blossom- drift of the old Snow Queen. 
That had not been a happy wakening, for it brought with
it the bitter disappointment of the preceding night.
But since then the little room had been endeared and
consecrated by years of happy childhood dreams and
maiden visions.  To it she had come back joyfully after
all her absences; at its window she had knelt through
that night of bitter agony when she believed Gilbert
dying, and by it she had sat in speechless happiness
the night of her betrothal.  Many vigils of joy and
some of sorrow had been kept there; and today she must
leave it forever.  Henceforth it would be hers no more;
fifteen-year-old Dora was to inherit it when she had
gone.  Nor did Anne wish it otherwise; the little room
was sacred to youth and girlhood--to the past that was
to close today before the chapter of wifehood opened.
<P>
Green Gables was a busy and joyous house that forenoon. 
Diana arrived early, with little Fred and Small Anne
Cordelia, to lend a hand.  Davy and Dora, the Green
Gables twins, whisked the babies off to the garden.
<P>
"Don't let Small Anne Cordelia spoil her clothes,"
warned Diana anxiously.
<P>
"You needn't be afraid to trust her with Dora," said
Marilla.  "That child is more sensible and careful
than most of the mothers I've known.  She's really a
wonder in some ways.  Not much like that other
harum-scarum I brought up."
<P>
Marilla smiled across her chicken salad at Anne.  It
might even be suspected that she liked the harum-scarum
best after all.
<P>
"Those twins are real nice children," said Mrs.
Rachel, when she was sure they were out of earshot. 
"Dora is so womanly and helpful, and Davy is
developing into a very smart boy.  He isn't the holy
terror for mischief he used to be."
<P>
"I never was so distracted in my life as I was the
first six months he was here," acknowledged Marilla. 
"After that I suppose I got used to him.  He's taken a
great notion to farming lately, and wants me to let him
try running the farm next year.  I may, for Mr. Barry
doesn't think he'll want to rent it much longer, and
some new arrangement will have to be made."
<P>
"Well, you certainly have a lovely day for your
wedding, Anne," said Diana, as she slipped a
voluminous apron over her silken array.  "You couldn't
have had a finer one if you'd ordered it from
Eaton's."
<P>
"Indeed, there's too much money going out of this
Island to that same Eaton's," said Mrs. Lynde
indignantly.  She had strong views on the subject of
octopus-like department stores, and never lost an
opportunity of airing them.  "And as for those
catalogues of theirs, they're the Avonlea girls' Bible
now, that's what.  They pore over them on Sundays
instead of studying the Holy Scriptures."
<P>
"Well, they're splendid to amuse children with," said
Diana.  "Fred and Small Anne look at the pictures by
the hour."
<P>
"_I_ amused ten children without the aid of Eaton's
catalogue," said Mrs. Rachel severely.
<P>
"Come, you two, don't quarrel over Eaton's catalogue,"
said Anne gaily.  "This is my day of days, you know. 
I'm so happy I want every one else to be happy, too."
<P>
"I'm sure I hope your happiness will last, child,"
sighed Mrs. Rachel.  She did hope it truly, and
believed it, but she was afraid it was in the nature of
a challenge to Providence to flaunt your happiness too
openly.  Anne, for her own good, must be toned down a
trifle.
<P>
But it was a happy and beautiful bride who came down
the old, homespun-carpeted stairs that September
noon--the first bride of Green Gables, slender and
shining-eyed, in the mist of her maiden veil, with her
arms full of roses.  Gilbert, waiting for her in the
hall below, looked up at her with adoring eyes.  She
was his at last, this evasive, long-sought Anne, won
after years of patient waiting.  It was to him she was
coming in the sweet surrender of the bride.  Was he
worthy of her?  Could he make her as happy as he hoped? 
If he failed her--if he could not measure up to her
standard of manhood--then, as she held out her hand,
their eyes met and all doubt was swept away in a glad
certainty.  They belonged to each other; and, no matter
what life might hold for them, it could never alter
that.  Their happiness was in each other's keeping and
both were unafraid.
<P>
They were married in the sunshine of the old orchard,
circled by the loving and kindly faces of long-familiar
friends.  Mr. Allan married them, and the Reverend Jo
made what Mrs. Rachel Lynde afterwards pronounced to be
the "most beautiful wedding prayer" she had ever
heard.  Birds do not often sing in September, but one
sang sweetly from some hidden bough while Gilbert and
Anne repeated their deathless vows.  Anne heard it and
thrilled to it; Gilbert heard it, and wondered only
that all the birds in the world had not burst into
jubilant song; Paul heard it and later wrote a lyric
about it which was one of the most admired in his first
volume of verse; Charlotta the Fourth heard it and was
blissfully sure it meant good luck for her adored Miss
Shirley.  The bird sang until the ceremony was ended
and then it wound up with one mad little, glad little
trill.  Never had the old gray-green house among its
enfolding orchards known a blither, merrier afternoon. 
All the old jests and quips that must have done duty at
weddings since Eden were served up, and seemed as new
and brilliant and mirth-provoking as if they had never
been uttered before.  Laughter and joy had their way;
and when Anne and Gilbert left to catch the Carmody
train, with Paul as driver, the twins were ready with
rice and old shoes, in the throwing of which Charlotta
the Fourth and Mr. Harrison bore a valiant part. 
Marilla stood at the gate and watched the carriage out
of sight down the long lane with its banks of
goldenrod.  Anne turned at its end to wave her last
good-bye.  She was gone--Green Gables was her home no
more; Marilla's face looked very gray and old as she
turned to the house which Anne had filled for fourteen
years, and even in her absence, with light and life.
<P>
But Diana and her small fry, the Echo Lodge people and
the Allans, had stayed to help the two old ladies over
the loneliness of the first evening; and they contrived
to have a quietly pleasant little supper time, sitting
long around the table and chatting over all the details
of the day.  While they were sitting there Anne and
Gilbert were alighting from the train at Glen St. Mary.
