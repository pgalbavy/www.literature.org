DR. SEWARD'S DIARY-cont.
<P>
     For a while  sheer  anger mastered me.  It was as if he
had  during  her life  struck Lucy on the face.  I smote the
table  hard and rose up as  I said to him, "Dr. Van Helsing,
are you mad?"
<P>
     He  raised  his  head and looked at me, and somehow the
tenderness of his face calmed me at once. "Would I were!" he
said.  "Madness  were easy to  bear compared with truth like
this. Oh, my friend, whey, think you, did I go so far round,
why take so long to tell so simple a thing? Was it because I
hate you and have hated you all my life?  Was  it  because I
wished to give you pain?  Was it that  I wanted, no so late,
revenge for  that  time when  you  saved my life, and from a
fearful death?  Ah no!"
<P>
     "Forgive me," said I.
<P>
     He  went on, "My  friend, it was because I wished to be
gentle in  the  breaking to  you, for I know  you have loved
that so sweet lady.  But even  yet  I do  not expect  you to
believe.  It is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth,
that  we may doubt such to be possible when  we have  always
believed the `no' of it.  It is more hard still to accept so
sad a concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy.  Tonight
I go to prove it.  Dare you come with me?"
<P>
     This staggered me.  A man does not like to prove such a
truth, Byron excepted from the catagory, jealousy.
<P>

<P>
        "And prove the very truth he most abhorred."
<P>

<P>
     He saw my hesitation, and spoke,  "The logic is simple,
no madman's logic this time, jumping from tussock to tussock
in a misty bog. If it not be true, then proof will be relief.
At worst it will not harm.  If it be true!  Ah, there is the
dread.  Yet every dread  should  help my cause, for in it is
some need of belief. Come, I tell you what I propose. First,
that we go off now and see  that child in the hospital.  Dr.
Vincent, of  the  North  Hospital, where  the papers say the
child  is, is  a friend of  mine, and I think of yours since
you were in class at Amsterdam.  He  will let two scientists
see his case, if he will not let two friends.  We shall tell
him nothing, but only that we wish to learn. And then . . ."
<P>
     "And then?"
<P>
     He took a key from his pocket and held it up. "And then
we spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where  Lucy
lies.  This is the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the
coffin man to give to Arthur."
<P>
     My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some
fearful ordeal before us.  I could do nothing, however, so I
plucked up what  heart  I  could and said that we had better
hasten, as the afternoon was passing.
<P>
     We found the child awake.  It had had a sleep and taken
some food, and  altogether was  going on  well.  Dr, Vincent
took the bandage from its  throat, and  showed us the punctures.  There was no mistaking  the similarity to those which
had been on Lucy's throat.  They were smaller, and the edges
looked fresher, that was all.  We  asked  Vincent to what he
attributed  them,  and  he  replied that it must have been a
bite of some animal, perhaps a rat, but for his own part, he
was  inclined  to think it was one of the bats which are  so
numerous on the northern heights of London.  "Out of so many
harmless ones,"  he said, "there  may be some wild  specimen
from the South of a more malignant species.  Some sailor may
have brought one home, and it managed to escape, or even from
the Zoological Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one
be bred there  from a vampire.  These  things do occur, you,
know.  Only ten days ago a wolf got out, and was, I believe,
traced up in this direction.  For a week after, the children
were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath and in
every  alley in  the  place  until this `bloofer lady' scare
came along, since then it  has been quite a  gala  time with
them.  Even  this  poor  little mite, when he woke up today,
asked the nurse if he might go away.  When she asked him why
he wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the `bloofer
lady'."
<P>
     "I hope,"  said Van Helsing, "that when you are sending
the child home you  will  caution its parents to keep strict
watch over it.  These  fancies  to stray are most dangerous,
and if the child were to remain out  another night, it would
probably be fatal.  But in  any case I  suppose you will not
let it away for some days?"
<P>
     "Certainly not, not for  a week at least, longer if the
wound is not healed."
<P>
     Our visit  to  the hospital  took more time than we had
reckoned on, and the sun had dipped before we came out. When
Van Helsing saw how dark it was, he said,
<P>
     "There is  not  hurry.  It is more late than I thought.
Come, let  us seek somewhere that  we  may eat, and then  we
shall go on our way."
<P>
     We dined at  `Jack Straw's Castle'  along with a little
crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy.  About
ten o'clock we started from the inn.  It was then very dark,
and the scattered lamps  made the darkness  greater when  we
were once outside their individual radius. The Professor had
evidently  noted the  road we were to go, for he went on unhesitatingly, but, as for me, I was in quite  a  mixup as to
locality.  As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people,
till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the
patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round.  At
last we reached the wall of the churchyard, which we climbed
over. With some little difficulty, for it was very dark, and
the whole place seemed  so strange to us, we found the Westenra tomb.  The Professor  took  the  key, opened the creaky
door, and standing back, politely,  but quite unconsciously,
motioned me to precede him.  There was a  delicious irony in
the offer, in the courtliness of giving preference on such a
ghastly occasion.  My  companion  followed  me  quickly, and
cautiously drew  the  door  to, after carefully ascertaining
that the lock was  a  falling, and not a spring one.  In the
latter  case  we should  have been in a bad plight.  Then he
fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of
candle, proceeded to make a light.  The tomb in the daytime,
and when wreathed with fresh flowers, had  looked  grim  and
gruesome enough,  but now, some  days afterwards,  when  the
flowers hung lank and dead, their whites turning to rust and
their greens to browns, when the spider and  the beetle  had
resumed their accustomed dominance, when the time-discolored
stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and  rusty, dank iron, and
tarnished brass, and  clouded  silver-plating gave back  the
feeble glimmer of a candle, the  effect  was more  miserable
and sordid  than could have been imagined.  It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life,  animal life, was not the only
thing which could pass away.
<P>
     Van Helsing went about  his work systematically.  Holding his candle so that he could read the  coffin plates, and
so holding it that the sperm dropped in white  patches which
congealed  as they touched  the  metal, he made assurance of
Lucy's coffin.  Another search in his bag, and he took out a
turnscrew.
<P>
     "What are you going to do?" I asked.
<P>
     "To open the coffin.  You shall yet be convinced."
<P>
     Straightway he began taking out the screws, and finally
lifted off the lid, showing the casing of lead beneath.  The
sight was almost too much for me. It seemed to be as much an
affront to  the dead  as it would have been to have stripped
off her clothing in her sleep whilst living. I actually took
hold of his hand to stop him.
<P>
     He only said, "You shall see,"and again fumbling in his
bag took out a tiny fret saw. Striking the turnscrew through
the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he
made a small hole, which was,  however, big  enough to admit
the point of the saw.  I had expected a rush of gas from the
week-old corpse.  We doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have  to become accustomed to  such things, and I drew
back towards  the door.  But the Professor never stopped for
a moment.  He sawed  down a couple of feet along one side of
the lead coffin, and then  across, and down  the other side.
Taking the edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards
the foot of the coffin, and holding up the  candle into  the
aperture, motioned to me to look.
<P>
     I drew near and looked.  The coffin was empty.  It  was
certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock,
but Van Helsing was unmoved.  He was now more sure than ever
of his ground, and so emboldened to proceed in his task."Are
you satisfied now, friend John?"  he asked.
<P>
     I felt  all  the  dogged argumentativeness of my nature
awake within me as  I answered  him,  "I  am  satisfied that
Lucy's  body is not in that coffin, but that only proves one
thing."
<P>
     "And what is that, friend John?"
<P>
     "That it is not there."
<P>
     "That is good logic," he said, "so far as it goes.  But
how do you, how can you, account for it not being there?"
<P>
     "Perhaps  a  body-snatcher," I suggested.  "Some of the
undertaker's people  may have stolen it."  I felt that I was
speaking folly, and yet it  was  the only real cause which I
could suggest.
<P>
     The Professor sighed. "Ah well!" he said," we must have
more proof.  Come with me."
<P>
     He  put  on the  coffin lid  again, gathered up all his
things and placed them in the bag, blew  out  the light, and
placed  the candle also in the bag.  We opened the door, and
went  out.  Behind us  he closed the door and locked it.  He
handed me the key, saying, "Will you keep it? You had better
be assured."
<P>
     I laughed, it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am bound
to say, as I motioned him to keep it.  "A key is nothing," I
said, "thee are many duplicates, and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of this kind."
<P>
     He said  nothing, but put the  key in his pocket.  Then
he told me to watch at one side of the  churchyard whilst he
would watch at the other.
<P>
      I  took  up my  place behind a yew tree, and I saw his
dark figure move until the intervening  headstones and trees
hid it from my sight.
    It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I
heard a distant clock strike twelve, and in time came one and
two.  I was chilled and unnerved, and angry with the Professor
for  taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming.
I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant, and not
sleepy enough  to  betray  my trust,  so  altogether I had a
dreary, miserable time.
<P>
     Suddenly,  as I turned round, I thought I saw something
like a white streak, moving between two dark yew trees at the
side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb.  At the  same
time  a dark  mass  moved  from the  Professor's side of the
ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I too moved, but
I  had to  go  round headstones  and railed-off tombs, and I
stumbled over graves.  The sky was overcast, and somewhere far
off an early cock  crew. A little ways off, beyond a line of
scattered  juniper trees,  which marked  the  pathway to the
church, a white  dim  figure flitted in the direction of the
tomb.  The tomb itself was  hidden by trees, and I could not
see where the figure had disappeared.  I heard the rustle of
actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and
coming over,  found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny
child.  When he saw me he held it out to me, and said,  "Are
you satisfied now?"
<P>
     "No," I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.
<P>
     "Do you not see the child?"
<P>
     "Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it
wounded?"
<P>
     "We shall see,"said the Professor, and with one impulse
we took our way out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.
<P>
     When we had got some little distance away, we went into
a clump  of  trees, and  struck a  match, and  looked at the
child's throat. It was without a scratch or scar of any kind.
<P>
     "Was I right?"  I asked triumphantly.
<P>
     "We were just in time," said the Professor thankfully.
<P>
     We had now to decide what we were to do with the child,
and so consulted about it. If we were to take it to a police
station we should have to give some account of our movements
during the night.  At least, we should have had to make some
statement as to how we had come to find the child.  So finally
we decided that we would take it to the Heath,  and  when we
heard a policeman coming, would leave it  where he could not
fail to find it.  We would then seek our way home as quickly
as we could.  All fell  out well.  At the edge  of Hampstead
Heath we  heard  a  policeman's heavy tramp,  and laying the
child on the pathway, we waited and watched until he  saw it
as he flashed his lantern to and fro.  We heard  his exclamation of  astonishment,  and then we went away silently.  By
good chance we got a cab near the `Spainiards,' and drove to
town.
<P>
     I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to
get a few hours' sleep, as Van Helsing is to  call for me at
noon.  He insists that I go with him on another expedition.
<P>

<P>
     27 September.--It  was  two  o'clock  before we found a
suitable opportunity for our attempt.  The funeral  held  at
noon was all completed, and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken  themselves  lazily away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder trees, we saw the  sexton
lock  the  gate  after  him.  We knew that we were safe till
morning did we desire it, but the Professor told me  that we
should not want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that
horrid sense of the reality of things, in which any effort of
imagination seemed out of place, and  I realized  distinctly
the  perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work.  Besides, I felt it was all so useless.  Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin,  to  see  if a woman
dead nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height
of folly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own eyesight,  that the  coffin  was  empty.  I
shrugged my shoulders,  however, and rested silent, for  Van
Helsing had a  way  of going  on his own road, no matter who
remonstrated.  He took the key, opened  the vault, and again
courteously motioned me to  precede.  The  place  was not so
gruesome as last night, but oh, how unutterably mean looking
when the sunshine streamed in.  Van Helsing  walked over  to
Lucy's coffin, and I followed. He bent over and again forced
back the leaden flange, and  a shock  of surprise and dismay
shot through me.
<P>
     There  lay Lucy, seemingly  just as we had seen her the
night before her funeral.  She  was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever, and I could not  believe that she
was dead.  The lips  were red, nay  redder than  before, and
on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.
<P>
     "Is this a juggle?" I said to him.
<P>
     "Are you convinced now?" said the Professor, in response,
and as he spoke he put over his hand, and in a way that made
me shudder, pulled back the dead lips and showed  the  white
teeth. "See," he went on,"they are even sharper than before.
With this  and this," and he touched one of the canine teeth
and that below it,  "the little children can be bitten.  Are
you of belief now, friend John?"
<P>
     Once more  argumentative  hostility  woke within me.  I
could not accept such an overwhelming idea as  he suggested.
So, with an attempt to argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said, "She may have  been placed  here  since
last night."
<P>
     "Indeed?  That is so, and by whom?"
<P>
     "I do not know.  Someone has done it."
<P>
     "And yet  she  has  been dead one week. Most peoples in
that time would not look so."
<P>
     I had no answer  for  this, so was silent.  Van Helsing
did not seem to notice my silence.  At  any  rate, he showed
neither chagrin nor triumph.  He was looking intently at the
face of the dead woman,  raising the eyelids and  looking at
the eyes, and  once  more opening the lips and examining the
teeth.  Then he turned to me and said,
<P>
     "Here,  there is  one thing which is different from all
recorded.  Here is some dual life that is not as the common.
She  was  bitten  by  the  vampire when she was in a trance,
sleep-walking, oh, you start.  You do not know that,  friend
John, but you shall know it later, and  in trance  could  he
best come to take more blood.  In  trance she  dies,  and in
trance she is Un-Dead, too.  So it  is that she  differ from
all other.  Usually when the Un-Dead sleep at home,"  as  he
spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of his arm to  designate
what to a vampire was `home', "their face show what they are,
but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead  she go back
to the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there,
see, and so it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep."
<P>
     This turned my blood cold, and it began to dawn upon me
that I was accepting Van Helsing's theories. But if she were
really dead, what was there of terror in the idea of killing
her?
<P>
     He  looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in my
face, for he said almost joyously, "Ah, you believe now?"
<P>
     I answered, "Do not press me too hard all at once. I am
willing to accept.  How will you do this bloody work?"
<P>
     "I  shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall drive a stake through her body."
<P>
     It  made  me shudder to think of so mutilating the body
of the woman whom I  had loved.  And yet the feeling was not
so strong  as I  had expected.  I was, in fact, beginning to
shudder at the presence  of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van
Helsing called it,  and to loathe  it.  Is  it possible that
love is all subjective, or all objective?
<P>
     I waited a considerable time for Van  Helsing to begin,
but he stood as if wrapped in thought.  Presently  he closed
the catch of his bag with a snap, and said,
<P>
     "I have been thinking,  and  have made up my mind as to
what is best.  If I did simply  follow my inclining  I would
do now, at this moment, what is to  be done.  But  there are
other things  to  follow, and things that are thousand times
more difficult in that them we do not know.  This is simple.
She have yet no life  taken, though  that is of time, and to
act now would be to take danger from her  forever.  But then
we may have  to  want  Arthur, and  how shall we tell him of
this?  If you, who saw the wounds on Lucy's throat, and  saw
the wounds so similar on the child's at the hospital, if you,
who saw  the  coffin empty last night and full today  with a
woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week, after she die, if you know of this and
know of the white figure last night that  brought  the child
to  the churchyard,  and yet of  your own senses you did not
believe,  how  then, can I  expect  Arthur, who know none of
those things, to believe?
<P>
     "He doubted me when  I  took him from her kiss when she
was dying.  I  know  he has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea I have done  things  that prevent him say goodbye
as  he  ought, and  he may  think that in some more mistaken
idea this woman was buried alive, and that  in  most mistake
of all we have killed her.  He will  then argue back that it
is we, mistaken ones, that have killed her by our ideas, and
so he will be much unhappy always. Yet he never can be sure,
and that is the worst of all.  And he will  sometimes  think
that she he loved was buried alive, and that will  paint his
dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered, and again,
he will think that we may be right, and that his  so beloved
was, after all, an Un-Dead.  No!  I told him once, and since
then I learn much.  Now, since I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he must pass through
the bitter waters to reach the sweet.  He, poor fellow, must
have one hour that will make the  very face  of  heaven grow
black to him, then we can act for good all round and send him
peace.  My mind is made up.  Let us go.  You return home for
tonight to your asylum, and see that all be well. As for me,
I shall spend the night here in  this  churchyard in my  own
way.  Tomorrow  night  you  will come to  me to the Berkeley
Hotel at ten of the clock.  I  shall send for Arthur to come
too, and also that so fine young man of America that gave his
blood.  Later we shall all have work to do.  I come with you
so far as Piccadilly and there dine, for I must be back here
before the sun set."
<P>
     So we locked  the tomb  and came away, and got over the
wall of the churchyard, which  was  not  much of a task, and
drove back to Piccadilly.
<P>

NOTE LEFT BY VAN HELSING IN HIS PORTMANTEAU, BERKELEY HOTEL
  DIRECTED TO JOHN SEWARD, M. D.
(Not Delivered)
<P>

<P>
        27 September
<P>

"Friend John,
<P>
     "I write this in case anything should happen.  I go alone
to watch in that churchyard.  It pleases me that the Un-Dead,
Miss Lucy, shall not leave tonight,  that so on  the  morrow
night  she may  be  more  eager.  Therefore I shall fix some
things she like not,  garlic  and a crucifix, and so seal up
the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead, and will heed.
Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out. They may
not prevail  on her wanting to  get in, for then the Un-Dead
is  desperate,  and must  find the line of least resistance,
whatsoever it may be. I shall be at hand all the night from
sunset till after sunrise, and if there be aught that may be
learned I shall learn it. For Miss Lucy or from her, I have
no fear, but that other to whom is there that she is Un-Dead,
he have not the power to seek her tomb and find shelter. He
is cunning, as  I  know from  Mr. Jonathan and from the way
that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for
Miss Lucy's life, and we lost, and in many ways the Un-Dead
are strong.  He  have  always  the strength  in his hand of
twenty men, even we four who gave our strength to Miss Lucy
it also is all to him.  Besides, he can summon his wolf and
I know not what.  So  if it be that he came thither on this
night he shall find me.  But none  other shall, until it be
too late. But it may be that he will not attempt the place.
There is no  reason why he  should.  His hunting ground  is
more full of game than the churchyard where the Un-Dead woman sleeps, and the one old man watch.
<P>
     "Therefore  I write this in case . . . Take the papers
that are with this, the diaries of Harker and the rest, and
read them,  and  then  find this great Un-Dead, and cut off
his head and burn his heart or drive a stake through it, so
that the world may rest from him.
<P>
     "If it be so, farewell.
<P>
     "VAN HELSING."
<P>

  DR. SEWARD'S DIARY
<P>

<P>
     28 September.--It is  wonderful  what  a  good  night's
sleep will do for one.  Yesterday I was  almost  willing  to
accept  Van Helsing's monstrous ideas, but now they  seem to
start out lurid before me as outrages on common sense.  I have
no doubt that he believes it all.  I wonder if his  mind can
have become in any way unhinged.  Surely there  must be some
rational explanation of all these mysterious  things.  Is it
possible that the Professor can have done it himself?  He is
so abnormally clever that if he went off  his head  he would
carry out his intent with regard to some fixed idea in a wonderful way.  I am loathe to think it, and indeed it would be
almost as great a marvel as the other to find  that Van Helsing was mad, but anyhow I shall watch him carefully.  I may
get some light on the mystery.
<P>

<P>
     29 September.--Last  night,  at  a  little  before  ten
o'clock, Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing's room. He
told us all what he wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to  Arthur, as if all our wills were centered in
his. He began by saying that he hoped we would all come with
him too, "for,"  he said,  "there is a grave duty to be done
there.  You were doubtless surprised at  my  letter?"   This
query was directly addressed to Lord Godalming.
   "I was.  It rather upset me for a bit.  There has been so
much trouble around my house of late that I could do without
any more.  I have been curious, too, as to what you mean.
<P>
     "Quincey and  I talked it over, but the more we talked,
the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself  that
I'm about up a tree as to any meaning about anything."
<P>
     "Me too," said Quincey Morris laconically.
<P>
     "Oh,"  said the Professor, "then you are nearer the beginning, both  of  you, than friend John here, who has to go
a long way back before he can even get so far as to begin."
<P>
     It was evident  that he  recognized my return to my old
doubting frame of mind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said with intense gravity,
<P>
     "I want your permission to  do what I  think  good this
night.  It is, I know, much to ask, and when  you know  what
it is I propose to do you will know, and only then how much.
Therefore may I ask that you promise me in the dark, so that
afterwards, though you may be angry with  me  for  a time, I
must not disguise from myself the  possibility that such may
be, you shall not blame yourselves for anything."
<P>
     "That's frank anyhow,"  broke in Quincey.  "I'll answer
for the Professor.  I don't quite see his drift, but I swear
he's honest, and that's good enough for me."
<P>
     "I thank you, Sir," said Van Helsing proudly.  "I have
done myself  the honor of counting you one trusting friend,
and such endorsement is dear to me."  He held out  a  hand,
which Quincey took.
<P>
     Then Arthur spoke out, "Dr. Van Helsing, I don't quite
like to `buy a pig in a poke', as they say in Scotland, and
if it be anything in which my honour  as  a gentleman or my
faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.  If you  can  assure me that what you intend does not
violate either of these two, then I give my consent at once,
though for the life of me, I cannot understand what you are
driving at."
<P>
     "I accept your limitation," said Van Helsing, "and all
I ask of you  is  that  if you feel it necessary to condemn
any  act  of mine, you  will  first consider it well and be
satisfied that it does not violate your reservations."
<P>
     "Agreed!"  said Arthur.  "That is only fair.  And  now
that the pourparlers are over, may I ask  what it is we are
to do?"
<P>
     "I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to
the churchyard at Kingstead."
<P>
     Arthur's face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way,
<P>
     "Where poor Lucy is buried?"
<P>
     The Professor bowed.
<P>
     Arthur went on, "And when there?"
<P>
     "To enter the tomb!"
<P>
     Arthur stood up.  "Professor, are you in earnest, or is
it some  monstrous  joke?  Pardon me,  I see that you are in
earnest."  He  sat down  again,  but I could see that he sat
firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity.  There was
silence until he asked again, "And when in the tomb?"
<P>
     "To open the coffin."
<P>
     "This is too much!"  he said, angrily rising again.  "I
am willing to be patient in  all things that are reasonable,
but in this, this desecration of the grave, of one who . . ."
He fairly choked with indignation.
<P>
     The Professor looked pityingly at him."If I could spare
you one pang, my poor friend," he said, "God  knows I would.
But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths, or later,
and for  ever,  the  feet  you  love  must  walk in paths of
flame!"
<P>
     Arthur  looked  up  with set white face and said, "Take
care, sir, take care!"
<P>
     "Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?" said
Van Helsing.  "And then  you will at least know the limit of
my purpose.  Shall I go on?"
<P>
     "That's fair enough," broke in Morris.
<P>
     After  a  pause  Van Helsing went on, evidently with an
effort, "Miss Lucy  is dead, is it not so?  Yes!  Then there
can be no wrong to her.  But if she be not dead. . ."
<P>
     Arthur jumped to his feet, "Good God!"  he cried. "What
do you mean? Has there been any mistake, has she been buried
alive?"He groaned in anguish that not even hope could soften.
<P>
     "I did not say she was alive, my child. I did not think
it.  I go no further than to say that she might be Un-Dead."
<P>
     "Un-Dead!  Not alive!  What do you mean?  Is this all a
nightmare, or what is it?"
<P>
     "There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which
age by age they may  solve only in part.  Believe me, we are
now on the verge of one. But I have not done.  May I cut off
the head of dead Miss Lucy?"
<P>
     "Heavens and earth, no!"   cried  Arthur  in a storm of
passion.  "Not for the wide world  will  I  consent  to  any
mutilation of her  dead body.  Dr. Van  Helsing,  you try me
too far.  What  have  I  done to you that you should torture
me so?  What did  that  poor,  sweet girl do that you should
want to cast such dishonor on her  grave?  Are you mad, that
you speak of such things, or am  I mad  to listen  to  them?
Don't  dare think more  of  such a desecration.  I shall not
give my consent to anything you do.  I have a duty to  do in
protecting her grave from outrage, and by God, I shall do it!"
<P>
     Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been
seated, and said, gravely and sternly, "My Lord Godalming, I
too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty  to  you, a
duty to the dead, and by God, I shall do it!  All I  ask you
now is that you come with me, that you look and  listen, and
if when  later I make the same request you do  not  be  more
eager for its fulfillment even than I am, then, I shall do my
duty, whatever it may seem to me.  And  then, to follow your
Lordship's wishes I shall hold myself  at  your  disposal to
render an account to you, when and where you will." His voice
broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of pity.
<P>
     "But I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me.  In
a long life of acts which were often not pleasant to do, and
which sometimes did wring my heart, I have never had so heavy
a task as now.  Believe me that if the time comes for you to
change your mind towards me, one look from you will wipe away
all this so sad hour, for I would do what a  man can to save
you from sorrow.  Just think.  For  why should I give myself
so much labor and so much of sorrow?  I have  come here from
my own land to do what I can of good, at the first to please
my friend John, and then to help a sweet young lady, whom too,
I come to love.  For her, I am ashamed to say so much, but I
say  it  in kindness,  I gave what you gave, the blood of my
veins.  I gave it, I who was  not, like you, her lover,  but
only her physician and her friend.  I gave her my nights and
days, before death, after death, and if my death  can do her
good even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead,  she shall have
it freely." He said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and
Arthur was much affected by it.
<P>
     He took the old man's  hand and said in a broken voice,
"Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand, but
at least I shall go with you and wait."
