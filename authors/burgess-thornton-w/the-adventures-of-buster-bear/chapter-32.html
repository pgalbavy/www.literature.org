<p>Buster Bear was having the finest time he had had since he came
down from the Great Woods to live in the Green Forest. To be sure,
he wasn't in the Green Forest now, but he wasn't far from it.
He was in the Old Pasture, one edge of which touches one edge
of the Green Forest. And where do you think he was, in the Old
Pasture? Why, right in the middle of the biggest patch of the
biggest blueberries he ever had seen in all his life! Now if there
is any one thing that Buster Bear had rather have above another,
it is all the berries he can eat, unless it be honey. Nothing
can quite equal honey in Buster's mind. But next to honey give
him berries. He isn't particular what kind of berries. Raspberries,
blackberries, or blueberries, either kind, will make him perfectly
happy.</p>

<p>"Um-m-m, my, my, but these are good!" he mumbled in his deep
grumbly-rumbly voice, as he sat on his haunches stripping off
the berries greedily. His little eyes twinkled with enjoyment,
and he didn't mind at all if now and then he got leaves, and some
green berries in his mouth with the big ripe berries. He didn't
try to get them out. Oh, my, no! He just chomped them all up together
and patted his stomach from sheer delight. Now Buster had reached
the Old Pasture just as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had crept out
of bed, and he had fully made up his mind that he would be back
in the Green Forest before Mr. Sun had climbed very far up in
the blue, blue sky. You see, big as he is and strong as he is,
Buster Bear is very shy and bashful, and he has no desire to meet
Farmer Brown, or Farmer Brown's boy, or any other of those two-legged
creatures called men. It seems funny but he actually is afraid
of them. And he had a feeling that he was a great deal more likely
to meet one of them in the Old Pasture than deep in the Green
Forest.</p>

<p>So when he started to look for berries, he made up his mind that
he would eat what he could in a great hurry and get back to the
Green Forest before Farmer Brown's boy was more than out of bed.
But when he found those berries he was so hungry that he forgot
his fears and everything else. They tasted so good that he just
had to eat and eat and eat. Now you know that Buster is a very
big fellow, and it takes a lot to fill him up. He kept eating
and eating and eating, and the more he ate the more he wanted.
You know how it is. So he wandered from one patch of berries to
another in the Old Pasture, and never once thought of the time.
Somehow, time is the hardest thing in the world to remember, when
you are having a good time.</p>

<p>Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun climbed higher and higher in the blue,
blue sky. He looked down on all the Great World and saw all that
was going on. He saw Buster Bear in the Old Pasture, and smiled
as he saw what a perfectly glorious time Buster was having. And
he saw something else in the Old Pasture that made his smile still
broader. He saw Farmer Brown's boy filling a great tin pail with
blueberries, and he knew that Farmer Brown's boy didn't know that
Buster Bear was anywhere about, and he knew that Buster Bear didn't
know that Farmer Brown's boy was anywhere about, and somehow he
felt very sure that he would see something funny happen if they
should chance to meet.</p>

<p>"Um-m-m, um-m-m," mumbled Buster Bear with his mouth full, as
he moved along to another patch of berries. And then he gave a
little gasp of surprise and delight. Right in front of him was
a shiny thing just full of the finest, biggest, bluest berries!
There were no leaves or green ones there. Buster blinked his greedy
little eyes rapidly and looked again. No, he wasn't dreaming.
They were real berries, and all he had got to do was to help himself.
Buster looked sharply at the shiny thing that held the berries.
It seemed perfectly harmless. He reached out a big paw and pushed
it gently. It tipped over and spilled out a lot of the berries.
Yes, it was perfectly harmless. Buster gave a little sigh of pure
happiness. He would eat those berries to the last one, and then
he would go home to the Green Forest.</p>
