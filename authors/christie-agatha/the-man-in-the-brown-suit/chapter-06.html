<p>I went home with a feeling of exultation. My scheme had succeeded
far better than I could possibly have hoped. Lord Nasby had been
positively genial. It only now remained for me to “Make good,” as
he expressed it. Once locked in my own room, I took out my precious
piece of paper and studied it attentively. Here was the clue to
the mystery.
</p>
<p>To begin with, what did the figures represent? There were five of
them, and a dot after the first two. “Seventeen—one hundred and
twenty-two,” I murmured.
</p><p>That did not seem to lead to anything.
</p><p>Next I added them up. That is often done in works of fiction and
leads to surprising deductions.
</p><p>“One and seven make eight and one is nine and two are eleven and
two are thirteen.”
</p><p>Thirteen! Fateful number! Was this a warning to me to leave the
whole thing alone? Very possibly. Anyway, except as a warning, it
seemed to be singularly useless. I declined to believe that any
conspirator would take that way of writing thirteen in real life.
If he meant thirteen, he would write thirteen. “13”—like that.
</p><p>There was a space between the one and the two. I accordingly
subtracted twenty-two from a hundred and seventy-one. The result
was a hundred and fifty-nine. I did it again and made it a hundred
and forty-nine. These arithmetical exercises were doubtless
excellent practice, but as regarded the solution of the mystery,
they seemed totally ineffectual. I left arithmetic alone, not
attempting fancy division or multiplication, and went on to the
words.
</p><p>Kilmorden Castle. That was something definite. A place. Probably
the cradle of an aristocratic family. (Missing heir? Claimant to
title?) Or possibly a picturesque ruin. (Buried treasure?)
</p><p>Yes, on the whole I inclined to the theory of buried treasure.
Figures always go with buried treasure. One pace to the right,
seven paces to the left, dig one foot, descend twenty-two steps.
That sort of idea. I could work out that later. The thing was to
get to Kilmorden Castle as quickly as possible.
</p><p>I made a strategic sally from my room and returned laden with books
of reference. <u>Who’s Who</u>, Whitaker, a Gazetteer, a History of
Scotch Ancestral Homes, and Somebody or other’s British Isles.
</p><p>Time passed. I searched diligently, but with growing annoyance.
Finally, I shut the last book with a bang. There appeared to be no
such place as Kilmorden Castle. Here was an unexpected check. There
<u>must</u> be such a place. Why should any one invent a name like that
and write it down on a piece of paper? Absurd!
</p><p>Another idea occurred to me. Possibly it was a castellated
abomination in the suburbs with a high-sounding name invented by
its owner. But if so, it was going to be extraordinarily hard to
find. I sat back gloomily on my heels (I always sit on the floor
to do anything really important) and wondered how on earth I was
to set about it.
</p><p>Was there any other line I could follow? I reflected earnestly and
then sprang to my feet delightedly. Of course! I must visit the
“scene of the crime.” Always done by the best sleuths! And no
matter how long afterwards it may be, they always find something
that the police have overlooked. My course was clear. I must go to
Marlow.
</p><p>But how was I to get into the house? I discarded several adventurous
methods, and plumped for stern simplicity. The house had been to
let—presumably was still to let. I would be a prospective tenant.
</p><p>I also decided on attacking the local house-agents, as having fewer
houses on their books.
</p><p>Here, however, I reckoned without my host. A pleasant clerk produced
particulars of about half a dozen desirable properties. It took
all my ingenuity to find objections to them. In the end I feared
I had drawn a blank.
</p><p>“And you’ve really nothing else?” I asked, gazing pathetically into
the clerk’s eyes. “Something right on the river, and with a fair
amount of garden and a small lodge,” I added, summing up the main
points of the Mill House, as I had gathered them from the papers.
</p><p>“Well, of course there’s Sir Eustace Pedler’s place,” said the man
doubtfully. “The Mill House, you know.”
</p><p>“Not—not where——” I faltered. (Really, faltering is getting to be
my strong point.)
</p><p>“That’s it! Where the murder took place. But perhaps you wouldn’t
like——”
</p><p>“Oh, I don’t think I should mind,” I said with an appearance of
rallying. I felt my <u>bona fides</u> was now quite established. “And
perhaps I might get it cheap—in the circumstances.”
</p><p>A master touch that, I thought.
</p><p>“Well, it’s possible. There’s no pretending that it will be easy
to let now—servants and all that, you know. If you like the place
after you’ve seen it, I should advise you to make an offer. Shall
I write you out an order?”
</p><p>“If you please.”
</p><p>A quarter of an hour later I was at the lodge of the Mill House.
In answer to my knock, the door flew open and a tall middle-aged
woman literally bounced out.
</p><p>“Nobody can go into the house, do you hear that? Fairly sick of
you reporters, I am. Sir Eustace’s orders are——”
</p><p>“I understood the house was to let,” I said freezingly, holding
out my order. “Of course, if it’s already taken——”
</p><p>“Oh, I’m sure I beg your pardon, miss. I’ve been fairly pestered
with these newspaper people. Not a minute’s peace. No, the house
isn’t let—nor likely to be now.”
</p><p>“Are the drains wrong?” I asked in an anxious whisper.
</p><p>“Oh, Lord, miss, the <u>drains</u> is all right! But surely you’ve heard
about that foreign lady as was done to death here?”
</p><p>“I believe I did read something about it in the papers,” I said
carelessly.
</p><p>My indifference piqued the good woman. If I had betrayed any
interest, she would probably have closed up like an oyster. As it
was, she positively bridled.
</p><p>“I should say you did, miss! It’s been in all the newspapers. The
<u>Daily Budget’s</u> out still to catch the man who did it. It seems,
according to them, as our police are no good at all. Well, I hope
they’ll get him—although a nice-looking young fellow he was and no
mistake. A kind of soldierly look about him—ah, well, I dare say
he’d been wounded in the war, and sometimes they go a bit queer
afterwards, my sister’s boy did. Perhaps she’d used him bad—they’re
a bad lot, those foreigners. Though she was a fine-looking woman.
Stood there where you’re standing now.”
</p><p>“Was she dark or fair?” I ventured. “You can’t tell from these
newspaper portraits.”
</p><p>“Dark hair, and a very white face—too white for nature, I thought,
and her lips reddened something cruel. I don’t like to see it—a
little powder now and then is quite another thing.”
</p><p>We were conversing like old friends now. I put another question.
</p><p>“Did she seem nervous or upset at all?”
</p><p>“Not a bit. She was smiling to herself, quiet like, as though she
was amused at something. That’s why you could have knocked me down
with a feather when, the next afternoon, those people came running
out calling for the police and saying there’d been murder done. I
shall never get over it, and as for setting foot in that house
after dark I wouldn’t do it, not if it was ever so. Why, I wouldn’t
even stay here at the lodge, if Sir Eustace hadn’t been down on
his bended knees to me.”
</p><p>“I thought Sir Eustace Pedler was at Cannes?”
</p><p>“So he was, miss. He come back to England when he heard the news,
and, as to the bended knees, that was a figure of speech, his
secretary, Mr. Pagett, having offered us double pay to stay on,
and, as my John says, money is money nowadays.”
</p><p>I concurred heartily with John’s by no means original remarks.
</p><p>“The young man now,” said Mrs. James, reverting suddenly to a
former point in the conversation. “He was upset. His eyes, light
eyes, they were, I noticed them particular, was all shining.
Excited, _I_ thought. But I never dreamt of anything being wrong.
Not even when he came out again looking all queer.”
</p><p>“How long was he in the house?”
</p><p>“Oh, not long, a matter of five minutes maybe.”
</p><p>“How tall was he, do you think? About six foot?”
</p><p>“I should say so maybe.”
</p><p>“He was clean-shaven, you say?”
</p><p>“Yes, miss—not even one of these toothbrush moustaches.”
</p><p>“Was his chin at all shiny?” I asked on a sudden impulse.
</p><p>Mrs. James stared at me with awe.
</p><p>“Well, now you come to mention it, miss, it <u>was.</u> However did you
know?”
</p><p>“It’s a curious thing, but murderers often have shiny chins,” I
explained wildly.
</p><p>Mrs. James accepted the statement in all good faith.
</p><p>“Really, now, miss. I never heard that before.”
</p><p>“You didn’t notice what kind of a head he had, I suppose?”
</p><p>“Just the ordinary kind, miss. I’ll fetch you the keys, shall I?”
</p><p>I accepted them, and went on my way to the Mill House. My
reconstructions so far I considered good. All along I had realized
that the differences between the man Mrs. James had described and
my Tube “doctor” were those of non-essentials. An overcoat, a
beard, gold-rimmed eyeglasses. The “doctor” had appeared middle-aged,
but I remembered that he had stooped over the body like a
comparatively young man. There had been a suppleness which told of
young joints.
</p><p>The victim of the accident (the Moth Ball man, as I called him to
myself) and the foreign woman, Mrs. de Castina, or whatever her
real name was, had had an assignation to meet at the Mill House.
That was how I pieced the thing together. Either because they
feared they were being watched or for some other reason, they chose
the rather ingenious method of both getting an order to view the
same house. Thus their meeting there might have the appearance of
pure chance.
</p><p>That the Moth Ball man had suddenly caught sight of the “doctor,”
and that the meeting was totally unexpected and alarming to him,
was another fact of which I was fairly sure. What had happened
next? The “doctor” had removed his disguise and followed the woman
to Marlow. But it was possible that had he removed it rather
hastily traces of spirit-gum might still linger on his chin. Hence
my question to Mrs. James.
</p><p>Whilst occupied with my thoughts I had arrived at the low
old-fashioned door of the Mill House. Unlocking it with the key,
I passed inside. The hall was low and dark, the place smelt forlorn
and mildewy. In spite of myself, I shivered. Did the woman who had
come here “smiling to herself” a few days ago feel no chill of
premonition as she entered this house? I wondered. Did the smile
fade from her lips, and did a nameless dread close round her heart?
Or had she gone upstairs, smiling still, unconscious of the doom
that was so soon to overtake her? My heart beat a little faster.
Was the house really empty? Was doom waiting for me in it also?
For the first time, I understood the meaning of the much-used word,
“atmosphere.” There was an atmosphere in this house, an atmosphere
of cruelty, of menace, of evil.
