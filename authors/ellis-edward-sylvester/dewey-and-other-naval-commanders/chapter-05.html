<p>A Daring Attempt by Captain Paul Jones&mdash;Why It Failed &mdash;A
Bold Scheme&mdash;Why It Did Not Succeed &mdash;The Fight Between the
<em>Ranger</em> and <em>Drake</em>.</p>

<p>Paul Jones waited until midnight. Then, when no one was dreaming
of danger, his men silently pulled away from the <em>Ranger</em>
in two boats, one commanded by himself and the other by Lieutenant
Wallingford. It was a long pull, and when they reached the outer
pier of the harbor it was beginning to grow light in the east.
They now parted company, and Jones directed his men to row for
the south side of the harbor, while the Lieutenant was to make
for the north shore. The object of the two was the same: the burning
of the shipping.</p>

<p>Wallingford reached the north side, and then, strangely enough,
gave up the attempt, his reason being that the candle on which
he counted to start the fire was blown out. The reader must remember
that in those days matches were unknown and the task of relighting
had to be done with the steel, flint and tinder. Though the contrivance
is an awkward one, we cannot help thinking the excuse of the Lieutenant
was weak, but the result was a failure on his part to carry out
the important work assigned to him.</p>

<p>Captain Jones was a different kind of man. Although day had fully
dawned, he kept his men rowing rapidly. Reaching the south side
of the harbor, he came upon a small fort garrisoned by a few soldiers.
Leaping out of the boat, the American dashed forward, bounded
over the walls and captured the sentinels before they knew their
danger. The guns were spiked and the garrison made prisoners.</p>

<p>"Set fire to the shipping!" he commanded to his men, while he,
with only a single companion, ran for a second fort some distance
away and spiked the guns in that. Then he hurried back to the
first fort and found to his surprise that the fire had not been
started.</p>

<p>"The candles have given out," was the reply to his angry inquiry.</p>

<p>It being broad daylight, his men expected him to jump into the
boat and order them to return with all haste to the ship; but,
instead of doing so, he darted into one of the nearest houses,
procured some tinder and candles and began himself the work of
destruction. Fixing his attention upon a large vessel, he climbed
quickly aboard and started a fire in her steerage. To help matters,
he flung a barrel of tar over the flames and in a few minutes
they were roaring fiercely. It meant prodigious damage, for the
vessel was surrounded by more than a hundred others, none of which
could move, since they were aground and the tide was out.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, there was great excitement by that time.
The alarm had been given. Men were running to and fro, and a number
hurried toward the burning ship with the purpose of extinguishing
the flames. All the Americans had entered the small boat and were
impatiently awaiting their commander. Instead of joining them,
Jones drew his pistol, and, standing alone in front of the crowd,
kept them back until the fire burst out of the steerage and began
running up the rigging. Backing slowly with drawn pistol, he stepped
into the boat and told his men to row with might and main for
the vessel.</p>

<p>The instant this was done the crowd rushed forward and by desperate
efforts succeeded in putting out the blaze before it had done
much damage. Then the forts attempted to fire on the Americans,
but their guns were spiked. Some cannon on the ships were discharged
at the boats, but their shots went wild. When the <em>Ranger</em>
was reached Captain Jones made the discovery that one of his men
was missing. The reason was clear. He was a deserter and had been
seen by his former comrades running from house to house and giving
the alarm. Such was the narrow chance by which one of the most
destructive conflagrations of British shipping was averted.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, this daring act caused alarm throughout England.
Jones was denounced as a freebooter and pirate, and every effort
was made to capture him. Had his enemies succeeded, little mercy
would have been shown the dauntless hero.</p>

<p>England was very cruel to many of her American prisoners, and
Captain Jones fixed upon a bold and novel plan for compelling
her to show more mercy toward those unfortunate enough to fall
into her power. It was to capture some prominent nobleman and
hold him as a hostage for the better treatment of our countrymen.
It must be remembered that Jones was cruising near his birthplace
and when a sailor boy had become familiar with the Scottish and
the English coasts. The <em>Ranger</em> was a fast vessel, and,
as I have shown, Jones himself was a master of seamanship. It
would seem, therefore, that all he had to do was to be alert,
and it need not be said that he and his crew were vigilant at
all times.</p>

<p>The Earl of Selkirk was a Scottish nobleman who had his country
seat at the mouth of the Dee, and Jones made up his mind that
he was just the man to serve for a hostage. At any rate, he could
not be put to a better use and certainly would not suspect the
purpose of the American vessel which, as night was closing in,
anchored offshore. Indeed, no one dreamed that the vessel was
the terrible American "pirate," which had thrown the whole country
into terror.</p>

<p>Fortunately the night was dark and the men rowed to land without
being noticed. The task was an easy one, for there was no one
to resist them. They walked silently through the darkness to the
fine grounds, and, having surrounded the handsome building, the
officer in charge of the party presented himself at the door and
made known his startling errand. He was informed that the Earl
was absent. A careful search revealed that such was the fact,
and all the trouble of the Americans went for naught.</p>

<p>It was a keen disappointment and the party decided to compensate
themselves so far as they could. The Earl was wealthy and the
house contained a great deal of valuable silver plate. A quantity
of this was carried to the <em>Ranger</em>.</p>

<p>Captain Jones was angered when he learned what had been done.
He knew the Earl and Lady Selkirk well and personally liked them
both. The singular scheme he had in mind was solely for the benefit
of his adopted countrymen.</p>

<p>"I am accused of being a pirate, robber and thief," he exclaimed,
"and you are doing all you can to justify the charges. Every ounce
of plate shall be returned."</p>

<p>He kept his word. The messengers who took back the silver carried
a note from Captain Jones apologizing to Lady Selkirk for the
misconduct of his men.</p>

<p>Now, if there was anything which Paul Jones loved it was to fight.
It was simply diversion for him to capture merchantmen or vessels
that could make only a weak resistance, and he longed to give
the enemy a taste of his mettle. It may be said that his situation
grew more dangerous with every hour. His presence was known and
a score of cruisers were hunting for him.</p>

<p>The British sloop of war <em>Drake</em>, which the gale prevented
him from attacking, was still at Carrickfergus, and Jones sailed
thither in the hope of inducing her to come out and fight him.
Being uncertain of his identity, the captain of the <em>Drake</em>
sent an officer in a boat to learn the truth. Captain Jones suspected
the errand and skilfully kept his broadsides turned away until
the officer, determined to know his identity, went aboard. As
soon as he stepped on deck he was made a prisoner and sent below.</p>

<p>Captain Jones reasoned that the captain of the <em>Drake</em>
would miss his officer after awhile and come out to learn what
had become of him. He, therefore, headed toward the North Channel,
the <em>Drake</em> following, with the tide against her and the
wind unfavorable until the mid-channel was reached, when, to quote
Maclay, Paul Jones "in plain view of three kingdoms, hove to,
ran up the flag of the new Republic and awaited the enemy."</p>

<p>In reply to the demand of the <em>Drake's</em> captain, Jones
gave the name of his vessel and expressed the pleasure it would
give him to engage him in battle. The American was astern of the
<em>Drake</em>, and, to show his earnestness, Captain Jones ordered
his helm put up and let fly with a broadside. The <em>Drake</em>
replied and then the battle was on. There was little manoeuvring,
the contest being what is known as a square yardarm and yardarm
fight.</p>

<p>The comparative strength of the two vessels was as follows: The
<em>Ranger</em> carried 18 guns and 123 men, the <em>Drake</em>
20 guns and 160 men, a number of the latter being volunteers for
the fight, which lasted one hour and four minutes, at the end
of which time the <em>Ranger</em> had lost two killed and six
wounded and the <em>Drake</em> forty-two killed. The latter was
so badly damaged by the well directed fire of the American that
the captain called for quarter. Ceasing her firing, Captain Jones
lowered a boat and sent it to the <em>Drake</em> to take possession.</p>

<p>As an evidence of the effect of the fire of the <em>Ranger</em>,
the following words may be quoted from Jones's official report:
"Her fore and maintopsail yards being cut away and down on the
caps, the topgallant yard and mizzen gaff both hanging up and
down along the mast, the second ensign which they had hoisted
shot away and hanging on the quarter gallery in the water, the
jib shot away and hanging in the water, her sails and rigging
cut entirely to pieces, her masts and yards all wounded and her
hull very much galled."</p>

<p>The damages to the <em>Ranger</em> were so slight they were repaired
by the close of the following day, when she got under sail with
her prize. Despite the swarm of cruisers that were hunting for
him, Jones passed unscathed through North Channel, along the western
coast of Ireland and arrived at Brest, in France, within a month
of the day he left the port, his cruise having been one of the
most remarkable in naval history.</p>
