I
<P>
I have tried throughout all this story to tell things as they
happened to me.  In the beginning--the sheets are still here on
the table, grimy and dogs-eared and old-looking--I said I wanted
to tell MYSELF and the world in which I found myself, and I have
done my best.  But whether I have succeeded I cannot imagine. All
this writing is grey now and dead and trite and unmeaning to me;
some of it I know by heart.  I am the last person to judge it.
<P>
As I turn over the big pile of manuscript before me certain
things become clearer to me, and particularly the immense
inconsequences of my experiences.  It is, I see now that I have
it all before me, a story of activity and urgency and sterility. 
I have called it Tono-Bungay, but I had far better have called it
Waste.  I have told of childless Marion, of my childless aunt, of
Beatrice wasted and wasteful and futile.  What hope is there for
a people whose women become fruitless?  I think of all the energy
I have given to vain things.  I think of my industrious scheming
with my uncle, of Crest Hill's vast cessation, of his resonant
strenuous career.  Ten thousand men have envied him and wished to
live as he lived.  It is all one spectacle of forces running to
waste, of people who use and do not replace, the story of a
country hectic with a wasting aimless fever of trade and
money-making  and pleasure-seeking.  And now I build destroyers!
<P>
Other people may see this country in other terms; this is how I
have seen it.  In some early chapter in this heap I compared all
our present colour and abundance  to October foliage before the
frosts nip down the leaves.  That I still feel was a good image. 
Perhaps I see wrongly.  It may be I see decay all about me
because I am, in a sense, decay.  To others it may be a scene of
achievement and construction radiant with hope.  I, too, have a
sort of hope, but it is a remote hope, a hope that finds no
promise in this Empire or in any of the great things of our time.
<P>
How they will look in history I do not know, how time and chance
will prove them I cannot guess; that is how they have mirrored
themselves on one contemporary mind.
<P>
II                            
<P>
Concurrently with writing the last chapter of this book I have
been much engaged by the affairs of a new destroyer we have
completed.  It has been an oddly complementary alternation of
occupations.  Three weeks or so ago this novel had to be put
aside in order that I might give all my time day and night to the
fitting and finishing of the engines.  Last Thursday X 2, for so
we call her, was done and I took her down the Thames and went out
nearly to Texel for a trial of speed.
<P>
It is curious how at times one's impressions will all fuse and
run together into a sort of unity and become continuous with
things that have hitherto been utterly alien and remote.  That
rush down the river became mysteriously connected with this book.
<P>
As I passed down the Thames I seemed in a new and parallel manner
to be passing all England in review.  I saw it then as I had
wanted my readers to see it.  The thought came to me slowly as I
picked my way through the Pool; it stood out clear as I went
dreaming into the night out upon the wide North Sea.
<P>
It wasn't so much thinking at the time as a sort of photographic
thought that came and grew clear.  X2 went ripping through the
dirty oily water as scissors rip through canvas, and the front of
my mind was all intent with getting her through under the bridges
and in and out among the steam-boats and barges and rowing-boats
and piers.  I lived with my hands and eyes hard ahead.  I thought
nothing then of any appearances but obstacles, but for all that
the back of my mind took the photographic memory of it complete
and vivid....
<P>
"This," it came to me, "is England.  That is what I wanted to
give in my book.  This!" 
<P>
We started in the late afternoon.  We throbbed out of our yard
above Hammersmith Bridge, fussed about for a moment, and headed
down stream.  We came at an easy rush down Craven Reach, past
Fulham and Hurlingham, past the long stretches of muddy meadow
And muddy suburb to Battersea and Chelsea, round the cape of tidy
frontage that is Grosvenor Road and under Vauxhall Bridge, and
Westminster opened before us.  We cleared a string of coal barges
and there on the left in the October sunshine stood the
Parliament houses, and the flag was flying and Parliament was
sitting.
<P>
I saw it at the time unseeingly; afterwards it came into my mind
as the centre of the whole broad panoramic  effect of that
afternoon.  The stiff square lace of Victorian Gothic with its
Dutch clock of a tower came upon me suddenly and stared and
whirled past in a slow half pirouette and became still, I know,
behind me as if watching me recede.  "Aren't you going to respect
me, then?" it seemed to say.
<P>
Not I!  There in that great pile of Victorian architecture  the
landlords and the lawyers, the bishops, the railway men and the
magnates of commerce go to and fro--in their incurable tradition
of commercialised Bladesovery, of meretricious gentry and
nobility sold for riches.  I have been near enough to know.  The
Irish and the Labour-men run about among their feet, making a
fuss, effecting little, they've got no better plans that I can
see.  Respect it indeed!  There's a certain paraphernalia of
dignity, but whom does it deceive?  The King comes down in a gilt
coach to open the show and wears long robes and a crown; and
there's a display of stout and slender legs in white stockings
and stout and slender legs in black stockings and artful old
gentlemen in ermine.  I was reminded of one congested afternoon I
had spent with my aunt amidst a cluster of agitated women's hats
in the Royal Gallery of the House of Lords and how I saw the King
going to open Parliament, and the Duke of Devonshire looking like
a gorgeous pedlar and terribly bored with the cap of maintenance
on a tray before him hung by slings from his shoulder.  A
wonderful spectacle!
<P>
It is quaint, no doubt, this England--it is even dignified  in
places--and full of mellow associations.  That does not alter the
quality of the realities these robes conceal.  The realities are
greedy trade, base profit-- seeking, bold advertisement; and
kingship and chivalry, spite of this wearing of treasured robes,
are as dead among it all as that crusader my uncle championed
against the nettles outside the Duffield church.
<P>
I have thought much of that bright afternoon's panorama.
<P>
To run down the Thames so is to run one's hand over the pages in
the book of England from end to end.  One begins in Craven Reach
and it is as if one were in the heart of old England.  Behind us
are Kew and Hampton Court with their memories of Kings and
Cardinals, and one runs at first between Fulham's episcopal
garden parties and Hurlingham's playground for the sporting
instinct of our race.  The whole effect is English.  There is
space, there are old trees and all the best qualities of the
home-land in that upper reach.  Putney, too, looks Anglican on a
dwindling scale.  And then for a stretch the newer developments
slop over, one misses Bladesover and there come first squalid
stretches of mean homes right and left and then the dingy
industrialism of the south side, and on the north bank the polite
long front of nice houses, artistic, literary, administrative
people's residences, that stretches from Cheyne Walk nearly to
Westminster and hides a wilderness of slums.  What a long slow
crescendo that is, mile after mile, with the houses crowding
closelier, the multiplying succession of church towers, the
architectural moments, the successive  bridges, until you come
out into the second movement of the piece with Lambeth's old
palace under your quarter and the houses of Parliament on your
bow!  Westminster Bridge is ahead of you then, and through it you
flash, and in a moment the round-faced clock tower cranes up to
peer at you again and New Scotland Yard squares at you, a fat
beef-eater of a policeman disguised miraculously as a Bastille.
<P>
For a stretch you have the essential London; you have Charing
Cross railway station, heart of the world, and the Embankment on
the north side with its new hotels overshadowing its Georgian and
Victorian architecture, and mud and great warehouses and
factories, chimneys, shot towers, advertisements on the south. 
The northward skyline grows more intricate and pleasing, and more
and more does one thank God for Wren.  Somerset House is as
picturesque as the civil war, one is reminded again of the
original England, one feels in the fretted sky the quality of
Restoration Lace.
<P>
And then comes Astor's strong box and the lawyers' Inns.
<P>
(I had a passing memory of myself there, how once I had trudged
along the Embankment westward, weighing  my uncle's offer of
three hundred pounds a year....)
<P>
Through that central essential London reach I drove, and X2
bored her nose under the foam regardless of it all like a black
hound going through reeds--on what trail even I who made her
cannot tell.
<P>
And in this reach, too, one first meets the seagulls and is
reminded of the sea.  Blackfriars one takes--just under these two
bridges and just between them is the finest bridge moment in the
world--and behold, soaring up, hanging in the sky over a rude
tumult of warehouses, over a jostling competition of traders,
irrelevantly  beautiful and altogether remote, Saint Paul's!  "Of
course!"  one says, "Saint Paul's!"  It is the very figure of
whatever fineness the old Anglican culture achieved, detached,  a
more dignified and chastened Saint Peter's, colder, greyer, but
still ornate; it has never been over thrown, never disavowed,
only the tall warehouses and all the roar of traffic have
forgotten it, every one has forgotten it; the steamships, the
barges, go heedlessly by regardless of it, intricacies of
telephone wires and poles cut blackly into its thin mysteries,
and presently, when in a moment the traffic permits you and you
look round for it, it has dissolved like a cloud into the grey
blues of the London sky.
<P>
And then the traditional and ostensible England falls from you
altogether.  The third movement begins, the last great movement
in the London symphony, in which the trim scheme of the old order
is altogether dwarfed and swallowed up.  Comes London Bridge, and
the great warehouses tower up about you, waving stupendous
cranes, the gulls circle and scream in your ears, large ships lie
among their lighters, and one is in the port of the world.  Again
and again in this book I have written of England as a feudal
scheme overtaken by fatty degeneration and stupendous accidents
of hypertrophy.
<P>
For the last time I must strike that note as the memory of the
dear neat little sunlit ancient Tower of London lying away in a
gap among the warehouses comes back to me, that little
accumulation of buildings so  provincially pleasant and
dignified, overshadowed by the vulgarest, most typical exploit
of modern England, the sham Gothic casings to the ironwork of the
Tower Bridge.  That Tower Bridge is the very balance and
confirmation of Westminster's dull pinnacles and tower.  That
sham Gothic bridge; in the very gates of our mother of change,
the Sea !
<P>
But after that one is in a world of accident and nature. For the
third part of the panorama of London is beyond all law, order,
and precedence; it is the seaport and the sea.  One goes down the
widening reaches through a monstrous variety of shipping, great
steamers, great sailing-ships, trailing the flags of all the
world, a  monstrous confusion of lighters, witches' conferences
of brown-sailed barges, wallowing tugs, a tumultuous crowding
and jostling of cranes and spars, and wharves and stores, and
assertive inscriptions.  Huge vistas of dock open right and left
of one, and here and there  beyond and amidst it all are church
towers, little patches of indescribably old-fashioned and
worn-out houses, riverside pubs and the like, vestiges of
townships that were long since torn to fragments and submerged in
these new growths.  And amidst it all no plan appears, no
intention, no comprehensive desire.  That is the very key of it
all.  Each day one feels that the pressure of commerce and
traffic grew, grew insensibly monstrous, and first this man made
a wharf and that erected a crane, and then this company set to
work and then that, and so they jostled together to make this
unassimilable enormity of traffic.  Through it we dodged and
drove eager for the high seas.
<P>
I remember how I laughed aloud at the glimpse of the name of a
London County Council steamboat that ran across me.  Caxton it
was called, and another was Pepys, and another was Shakespeare. 
They seemed so wildly out of place, splashing about in that
confusion.  One wanted to take them out and wipe them and put
them back in some English gentleman's library.  Everything was
alive about them, flash ing, splashing, and  passing, ships
moving, tugs panting, hawsers taut, barges going down with men
toiling at the sweeps, the water all a-swirl with the wash of
shipping, scaling into millions of little wavelets, curling and
frothing under the whip of the unceasing wind.  Past it all we
drove.  And at Greenwich to the south, you know, there stands a
fine stone frontage where all the victories are recorded in a
Painted Hall, and beside it is the "Ship" where once upon a time
those gentlemen of Westminster used to have an annual
dinner--before the port of London got too much for them
altogether.  The old facade of the Hospital was just warming to
the sunset as we went by, and after that, right and left, the
river opened, the sense of the sea increased and prevailed, reach
after reach from Northfleet to the Nore.
<P>
And out you come at last with the sun behind you into the eastern
sea.  You speed up and tear the oily water louder and faster,
siroo, siroo-swish-siroo, and the hills of Kent--over which I
once fled from the Christian teachings of Nicodemus Frapp--fall
away on the right hand and Essex on the left.  They fall away and
vanish into blue haze, and the tall slow ships behind the tugs,
scarce moving ships and wallowing sturdy tugs, are all wrought of
wet gold as one goes frothing by.  They stand out, bound on
strange missions of life and death, to the killing of men in
unfamiliar lands.  And now  behind us is blue mystery and the
phantom flash of unseen lights, and presently even these are
gone, and I and my destroyer tear out to the unknown across a
great grey space.  We tear into the great spaces of the future
and the turbines fall to talking in unfamiliar tongues.  Out to
the open we go, to windy freedom and trackless ways. Light after
light goes down.  England and the Kingdom,  Britain and the
Empire, the old prides and the old devotions, glide abeam,
astern, sink down upon the  horizon, pass--pass.  The river
passes--London passes, England passes...
<P>
III
<P>
This is the note I have tried to emphasise, the note that sounds
clear in my mind when I think of anything beyond  the purely
personal aspects of my story.
<P>
It is a note of crumbling and confusion, of change and seemingly
aimless swelling, of a bubbling up and medley of futile loves and
sorrows.  But through the confusion sounds another note.  Through
the confusion something drives, something that is at once human
achievement and the most inhuman of all existing things.
Something comes out of it.... How can I express  the values of a
thing at once so essential and so immaterial.  It is something
that calls upon such men as I with an irresistible appeal.
<P>
I have figured it in my last section by the symbol of my
destroyer, stark and swift, irrelevant to most human interests. 
Sometimes I call this reality Science, sometimes I call it
Truth.  But it is something we draw by pain and effort ont of the
heart of life, that we disentangle and make clear.  Other men
serve it, I know, in art, in literature, in social invention, and
see it in a thousand different figures, under a hundred names.  I
see it always as austerity, as beauty.  This thing we make clear
is the heart of life.  It is the one enduring thing.  Men and
nations, epochs and civilisation pass each making its
contribution I do not know what it is, this something, except
that it is supreme.  It is, a something,  a quality, an element,
one may find now in colours, now in norms, now in sounds, now in
thoughts.  It emerges from life with each year one lives and
feels, and generation by generation and age by age, but the how
and why of it are all beyond the compass of my mind....
<P>
Yet the full sense of it was with me all that night as I drove,
lonely above the rush and murmur of my engines, out upon the
weltering circle of the sea.
<P>
Far out to the northeast there came the flicker of a squadron of
warships waving white swords of light about the sky.  I kept them
hull-down, and presently they were mere summer lightning over
the watery edge of the globe....  I fell into thought that was
nearly formless, into doubts and dreams that have no words, and
it seemed good to me to drive ahead and on and or through the
windy starlight, over the long black waves.
<P>
IV
<P>
It was morning and day before I returned with the four sick and
starving journalists who had got permission to come with me, up
the shining river, and past the old grey Tower....
<P>
I recall the back views of those journalists very distinctly, 
going with a certain damp weariness of movement,  along a side
street away from the river.  They were good men and bore me no
malice, and they served me up to the public in turgid degenerate
Kiplingese, as a modest button on the complacent stomach of the
Empire.  Though as a matter of fact, X2 isn't intended for the
empire, or indeed for the hands of any European power.  We
offered it to our own people first, but they would have nothing
to do with me, and I have long since ceased to trouble much about
such questions.  I have come to see myself from the outside, my
country from the outside--without illusions.  We make and pass.
<P>
We are all things that make and pass striving upon a hidden
mission, out to the open sea.
