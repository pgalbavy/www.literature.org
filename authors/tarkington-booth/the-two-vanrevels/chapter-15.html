<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>"Methought I met a Damsel Fair And tears were in her eyes; Her
head and arms were bare, I heard her bursting sighs.</p>

<p>"I stopp'd and looked her in the face, 'Twas then she sweetly
smiled. Her features shone with mournful grace, Far more than
Nature's child.</p>

<p>"With diffident and downcast eye, In modest tones she spoke;
She wiped a tear and gave a sigh, And then her silence broke&mdash;"</p>

<p>So sang Mrs. Tanberry at the piano, relieving the melancholy
which possessed her; but Nelson, pausing in the hail to listen,
and exceedingly curious concerning the promised utterance of the
Damsel Fair, was to suffer disappointment, as the ballad was broken
off abruptly and the songstress closed the piano with a monstrous
clatter. Little doubt may be entertained that the noise was designed
to disturb Mr. Carewe, who sat upon the veranda consulting a brown
Principe, and less that the intended insult was accomplished.
For an expression of a vindictive nature was precipitated in that
quarter so simultaneously that the bang of the piano-lid and the
curse were even as the report of a musket and the immediate cry
of the wounded.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tanberry at once debouched upon the piazza, showing a vast,
clouded countenance. "And I hope to heaven you already had a headache!"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"The courtesy of your wish, madam," Carewe replied, with an angry
flash of his eye, "is only equaled by the kindness of heaven in
answering it. I have, in fact, a headache. I always have, nowadays."</p>

<p>"That's good news," returned the lady heartily.</p>

<p>"I thank you," retorted her host.</p>

<p>"Perhaps if you treated your daughter even a decent Indian's
kind of politeness, you'd enjoy better health."</p>

<p>"Ah! And in what failure to perform my duty toward her have I
incurred your displeasure?"</p>

<p>"Where is she now?" exclaimed the other excitably. "Where is
she now?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say."</p>

<p>"Yes, you can, Robert Carewe!" Mrs. Tanberry retorted, with a
wrathful gesture. "You know well enough she's in her own room,
and so do <em>I&mdash;</em>for I tried to get in to comfort her when
I heard her crying. She's in there with the door bolted, where
you drove her!"</p>

<p>"I drove her!" he sneered.</p>

<p>"Yes, you did, and I heard you. Do you think I couldn't hear
you raging and storming at her like a crazy man? When you get
in a temper do you dream there's a soul in the neighborhood who
doesn't know it? You're a fool if you do, because they could have
heard you swearing down on Main Street, if they'd listened. What
are you trying to do to her?&mdash;break her spirit?&mdash;or what? Because
you'll do it, or kill her. I never heard anybody cry so heart-brokenly."
Here the good woman's own eyes filled. "What's the use of pretending?"
she went on sorrowfully. "You haven't spoken to her kindly since
you came home. Do you suppose I'm blind to that? You weren't a
bad husband to the poor child's mother; why can't you be a good
father to her?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you might begin by asking her to be a good daughter
to me."</p>

<p>"What has she done?"</p>

<p>"The night before I went away she ran to a fire and behaved there
like a common street hoyden. The ladies of the Carewe family have
not formerly acquired a notoriety of that kind."</p>

<p>"Bah!" said Mrs. Tanberry.</p>

<p>"The next morning, when I taxed her with it, she dutifully defied
and insulted me."</p>

<p>"I can imagine the delicacy with which you 'taxed' her. What
has that to do with your devilish tantrums of this afternoon,
Robert Carewe?"</p>

<p>"I am obliged to you for the expression," he returned. "When
I came home, this afternoon, I found her reading that thing."
He pointed to many very small fragments of Mr. Cummings's newspaper,
which were scattered about the lawn near the veranda. "She was
out here, reading an article which I had read downtown and which
appeared in a special edition of that rotten sheet, sent out two
hours ago."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Do you know what that article was, madam, do you know what it
was?"  Although breathing heavily, Mr. Carewe had compelled himself
to a certain outward calmness, but now, in the uncontrollable
agitation of his anger, he sprang to his feet and struck one of
the wooden pillars of the porch a shocking blow with the bare
knuckles of his clenched hand. "Do you know what it was? It was
a eulogy of that damned Vanrevel! It pretended to be an account
of the enrollment of his infernal company, but it was nothing
more than a glorification of that nigger-loving hound! His company&mdash;a
lot of sneaks, who'll run like sheep from the first Greaser&mdash;elected
him captain yesterday, and today he received an appointment as
major! It dries the blood in my veins to think of it!&mdash;that black
dog a major! Good God! am I never to hear the last of him? Cummings
wrote it, the fool, the lying, fawning, slobbering fool; he ought
to be shot for it! Neither he nor his paper ever enter my doors
again! And I took the dirty sheet from her hands and tore it to
pieces&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," interposed Mrs. Tanberry, "it looks as if you had done
it with your teeth."</p>

<p>" &mdash;And stamped it into the ground!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I heard you!" she said.</p>

<p>Carewe came close to her, and gave her a long look from such
bitter eyes that her own fell before them. "If you've been treacherous
to me, Jane Tanberry," he said, "then God punish you! If they've
met&mdash;my daughter and that man&mdash;while I was away, it is on your
head. I don't ask you, because I believe if you knew anything
you'd lie for her sake. But I tell you that as she read that paper,
she did not hear my step on the walk nor know that I was there
until I leaned over her shoulder. And I swear that I suspect her."</p>

<p>He turned and walked to the door, while the indomitable Mrs.
Tanberry, silenced for once, sank into the chair he had vacated.
Before he disappeared within the house, he paused.</p>

<p>"If Mr. Vanrevel has met my daughter," he said, in a thick voice,
stretching out both hands in a strange, menacing gesture toward
the town that lay darkling in the growing dusk, "if he has addressed
one word to her, or so much as allowed his eyes to rest on her
overlong, let him take care of himself!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Robert, Robert," Mrs. Tanberry cried, in a frightened whisper
to herself, "all the fun and brightness went out of the world
when you came home!"</p>

<p>For, in truth, the gayety and light-heartedness which, during
the great lady's too brief reign, had seemed a vital adjunct of
the house to make the place resound with music and laughter, were
now departed. No more did Mrs. Tanberry extemporize Dan Tuckers,
mazourkas, or quadrilles in the ball-room, nor Blind-Man's Buff
in the library; no more did serenaders nightly seek the garden
with instrumental plunkings and vocal gifts of harmony. Even the
green bronze boy of the fountain seemed to share the timidity
of the other youths of the town where Mr. Carewe was concerned,
for the goblet he held aloft no longer sent a lively stream leaping
into the sunshine in translucent gambols, but dribbled and dripped
upon him like a morbid autumn rain. The depression of the place
was like a drape of mourning purple; but not that house alone
lay glum, and there were other reasons than the return of Robert
Carewe why Rouen had lost the joy and mirth that belonged to it.
Nay, the merry town had changed beyond all credence; it was hushed
like a sick-room, and dolefully murmurous with forebodings of
farewell and sorrow.</p>

<p>For all the very flower of Rouen's youth had promised to follow
Tom Vanrevel on the long and arduous journey to Mexico, to march
burning miles under the tropical sun, to face strange fevers and
the guns of Santa Anna.</p>

<p>Few were the houses of the more pretentious sort that did not
mourn, in prospect, the going of son, or brother, or close friend;
mothers already wept not in secret, fathers talked with husky
bravado; and everyone was very kind to those who were to go, speaking
to them gently and bringing them little foolish presents. Nor
could the hearts of girls now longer mask as blocks of ice to
the prospective conquistadores; Eugene Madrillon's young brother,
Jean, after a two years' Beatrice-and-Benedict wooing of Trixie
Chenoweth (that notable spitfire) announced his engagement upon
the day after his enlistment, and recounted to all who would listen
how his termagant fell upon his neck in tears when she heard the
news. "And now she cries about me all the time," finished the
frank Jean blithely.</p>

<p>But there was little spirit for the old merriments: there were
no more carpet-dances at the Bareauds', no masquerades at the
Madrillons', no picnics in the woods nor excursions on the river;
and no more did light feet bear light hearts through the "mazes
of the intricate schottische, the subtle mazourka, or the stately
quadrille," as Will Cummings remarked in the Journal. Fanchon,
Virginia, and five or six others, spent their afternoons mournfully,
and yet proudly, sewing and cutting large pieces of colored silk,
fashioning a great flag for their sweethearts and brothers to
bear southward and plant where stood the palace of the Montezumas.</p>

<p>That was sad work for Fanchon, though it was not for her brother's
sake that she wept, since, as everyone knew, Jefferson was already
so full of malaria and quinine that the fevers of the South and
Mexico must find him invulnerable, and even his mother believed
he would only thrive and grow hearty on his soldiering. But about
Crailey, Fanchon had a presentiment more vivid than any born of
the natural fears for his safety; it came to her again and again,
reappearing in her dreams; she shivered and started often as she
worked on the flag, then bent her fair head low over the gay silks,
while the others glanced at her sympathetically. She had come
to feel quite sure that Crailey was to be shot.</p>

<p>"But I've dreamed it&mdash;dreamed it six!" she cried, when he laughed,
at her and tried to cheer her. "And it comes to me in the day-time
as though I saw it with my eyes: the picture of you in an officer's
uniform, lying on the fresh, green grass, and a red stain just
below the throat."</p>

<p>"That shows what dreams are made of, dear lady," he smiled. "We'll
find little green grass in Mexico, and I'm only a corporal; so
where's the officer's uniform?"</p>

<p>Then Fanchon wept the more, and put her arms about him, while
it seemed to her that she must cling to him so forever and thus
withhold him from fulfilling her vision, and that the gentle pressure
of her arms must somehow preserve him to life and to her. "Ah,
you can't go, darling,"  she sobbed, while he petted her and tried
to soothe her. "You can't leave me! You belong to me! They can't,
can't, can't take you away from me!"</p>

<p>And when the flag was completed, save for sewing the stars upon
the blue ground, she took it away from the others and insisted
upon finishing the work herself. To her own room she carried it,
and each of the white stars that the young men of Rouen were to
follow in the struggle that would add so many others to the constellation,
was jewelled with her tears and kissed by her lips as it took
its place with its brothers. Never were neater stitches taken,
for, with every atom of her body yearning to receive the shot
that was destined for Crailey, this quiet sewing was all that
she could do! She would have followed him, to hold a parasol over
him under the dangerous sun, to cook his meals properly, to watch
over him with medicines and blankets and a fan; she would have
followed barefoot and bareheaded, and yet, her heart breaking
with the crucial yearning to mother him and protect him, this
was all that she could for him, this small stitching at the flag
he had promised to follow.</p>

<p>When the work was quite finished, she went all over it again
with double thread, not facing the superstition of her motive,
which was to safeguard her lover: the bullet that was destined
for Crailey might, in the myriad chances, strike the flag first
and be deflected, though never so slightly, by one of these last
stitches, and Crailey's heart thus missed by the same margin.
It was at this juncture, when the weeping of women was plentiful,
when old men pulled long faces, and the very urchins of the street
observed periods of gravity and even silence, that a notion entered
the head of Mrs. Tanberry&mdash;young Janie Tanberry&mdash;to the effect
that such things were all wrong. She declared energetically that
this was no decent fashion of farewell; that after the soldiers
went away there would be time enough to enact the girls they had
left behind them; and that, until then, the town should be made
enlivening. So she went about preaching a revival of cheerfulness,
waving her jewelled hand merrily from the Carewe carriage to the
volunteers she saw upon the street, calling out to them with laughter
and inspiring quip; everywhere scolding the mourners viciously
in her husky voice, and leaving so much of heartening vivacity
in her wake that none could fail to be convinced that she was
a wise woman.</p>

<p>Nor was her vigor spent in vain. It was decided that a ball should
be given to the volunteers of Rouen two nights before their departure
for the State rendezvous, and it should be made the noblest festival
in Rouen's history; the subscribers took their oath to it. They
rented the big dining-room at the Rouen House, covered the floor
with smooth cloth, and hung the walls solidly with banners and
roses, for June had come. More, they ran a red carpet across the
sidewalk (which was perfectly dry and clean) almost to the other
side of the street; they imported two extra fiddles and a clarionet
to enlarge the orchestra; and they commanded a supper such as
a hungry man beholds in a dream.</p>

<p>Miss Betty laid out her prettiest dress that evening, and Mrs.
Tanberry came in and worshipped it as it rested, like foam of
lavender and white and gray, upon the bed, beside the snowy gloves
with their tiny, stiff lace gauntlets, while two small white sandal-slippers,
with jeweled buckles where the straps crossed each other, were
being fastened upon Miss Betty's silken feet by the vain and gloating
Mamie.</p>

<p>"It's a wicked cruelty, Princess!" exclaimed Mrs. Tanberry. "We
want cheer the poor fellows and help them to be gay, and here
do you deliberately plan to make them sick at the thought of leaving
the place that holds you! Or have you discovered that there's
one poor vagabond of the band getting off without having his heart
broken, and made up your mind to do it for him tonight?"</p>

<p>"Is father to go with us?" asked Betty. It was through Mrs. Tanberry
that she now derived all information concerning Mr. Carewe, as
he had not directly addressed her since the afternoon when he
discovered her reading the Journal's extra.</p>

<p>"No, we are to meet him' there. He seems rather pleasanter than
usual this evening," remarked Mrs. Tanberry, hopefully, as she
retired.</p>

<p>"Den we mus' git ready to share big trouble tomorrer!" commented
the kneeling Mamie, with a giggle.</p>

<p>Alas! poor adoring servitress, she received a share unto herself
that very evening, for her young mistress, usually as amiable
as a fair summer sky, fidgetted, grumbled, found nothing well
done, and was never two minutes in the same mind. After donning
the selected dress, she declared it a fright, tried two others,
abused each roundly, dismissed her almost weeping handmaiden abruptly,
and again put on the first. Sitting down to the mirror, she spent
a full hour over the arrangement of her hair, looking attentively
at her image, sometimes with the beginning of doubtful approval,
often angrily, and, now and then, beseechingly, imploring it to
be lovely.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Tanberry came in to tell her that Nelson was at the
block with the carriage, Miss Betty did not turn, and the elder
lady stopped on the threshold and gave a quick, asthmatic gasp
of delight. For the picture she saw was, without a doubt in the
world, what she proclaimed it, a moment later, ravishingly pretty:
the girlish little pink and white room with all its dainty settings
for a background, lit by the dozen candles in their sconces and
half as many slender silver candlesticks, and, seated before the
twinkling mirror, the beautiful Miss Carewe, in her gown of lace
and flounces that were crisp, yet soft, her rope of pearls, her
white sandals, and all the glory of her youth. She had wound a
wreath of white roses into her hair, her cheeks were flushed,
and her eyes warm and glowing, yet inscrutable in their long gaze
into the mirror.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mrs. Tanberry, "you make me want to be a man! I'd
pick you up and run to the North Pole, where no one could ever
follow. And I can tell you that it hurts not to throw my arms
round you and kiss you; but you're so exquisite I don't want to
touch you!"</p>

<p>In answer, Miss Betty ran to her and kissed her rapturously on
both cheeks. "Am <em>I&mdash;</em>after all?" she cried. "Am I? Is
it? Will the roses do?"  And without heeding her companion's staccatoes
of approval she went rapidly to the open bureau, snatched up a
double handful of ribbons and furbelows, and dashed out of the
room in search of the disgraced Mamie. She found her seated on
the kitchen door-step in lonely lamentation, and showered the
gifts into her lap, while the vain one shrieked inimitably with
pride in the sudden vision of her mistress and joy of the incredible
possessions.</p>

<p>"Here, and here, and here!" said Miss Betty in a breath, hurling
the fineries upon her. "I'm an evil-tongued shrew, Mamie, and
these aren't to make up for the pain I gave you, but just to show
that I'd like to if I knew how! Good-by!" And she was off like
an April breeze.</p>

<p>"Dance wid the han'somdest," screamed Mamie, pursuing uproariously
to see the last of her as she jumped into the carriage, "bow to
de wittriest, an' kiss de one you love de bes'!"</p>

<p>"That will be you!" said Miss Betty to Mrs. Tanberry, and kissed
the good lady again.</p>
