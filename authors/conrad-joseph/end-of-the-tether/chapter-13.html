<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p> This was the reason why Mr. Sterne’s confidential communication,
delivered hurriedly on the shore alongside the dark silent ship,
had disturbed his equanimity. It was the most incomprehensible
and unexpected thing that could happen; and the perturbation of
his spirit was so great that, forgetting all about his letters,
he ran rapidly up the bridge ladder.</p>

<p>The portable table was being put together for dinner to the left
of the wheel by two pig-tailed "boys," who as usual snarled at
each other over the job, while another, a doleful, burly, very
yellow Chinaman, resembling Mr. Massy, waited apathetically with
the cloth over his arm and a pile of thick dinner-plates against
his chest. A common cabin lamp with its globe missing, brought
up from below, had been hooked to the wooden framework of the
awning; the side-screens had been lowered all round; Captain Whalley
filling the depths of the wicker-chair seemed to sit benumbed
in a canvas tent crudely lighted, and used for the storing of
nautical objects; a shabby steering-wheel, a battered brass binnacle
on a stout mahogany stand, two dingy life-buoys, an old cork fender
lying in a corner, dilapidated deck-lockers with loops of thin
rope instead of door-handles.</p>

<p>He shook off the appearance of numbness to return Mr. Van Wyk’s
unusually brisk greeting, but relapsed directly afterwards. To
accept a pressing invitation to dinner "up at the house" cost
him another very visible physical effort. Mr. Van Wyk, perplexed,
folded his arms, and leaning back against the rail, with his little,
black, shiny feet well out, examined him covertly.</p>

<p>"I’ve noticed of late that you are not quite yourself, old friend."</p>

<p>He put an affectionate gentleness into the last two words. The
real intimacy of their intercourse had never been so vividly expressed
before.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, tut!"</p>

<p>The wicker-chair creaked heavily.</p>

<p>"Irritable," commented Mr. Van Wyk to himself; and aloud, "I’ll
expect to see you in half an hour, then," he said negligently,
moving off.</p>

<p>"In half an hour," Captain Whalley’s rigid silvery head repeated
behind him as if out of a trance.</p>

<p>Amidships, below, two voices, close against the engineroom, could
be heard answering each other&mdash;one angry and slow, the other alert.</p>

<p>"I tell you the beast has locked himself in to get drunk."</p>

<p>"Can’t help it now, Mr. Massy. After all, a man has a right to
shut himself up in his cabin in his own time."</p>

<p>"Not to get drunk."</p>

<p>"I heard him swear that the worry with the boilers was enough
to drive any man to drink," Sterne said maliciously.</p>

<p>Massy hissed out something about bursting the door in. Mr. Van
Wyk, to avoid them, crossed in the dark to the other side of the
deserted deck. The planking of the little wharf rattled faintly
under his hasty feet.</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Wyk! Mr. Van Wyk!"</p>

<p>He walked on: somebody was running on the path. "You’ve forgotten
to get your mail."</p>

<p>Sterne, holding a bundle of papers in his hand, caught up with
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks."</p>

<p>But, as the other continued at his elbow, Mr. Van Wyk stopped
short. The overhanging eaves, descending low upon the lighted
front of the bungalow, threw their black straight-edged shadow
into the great body of the night on that side. Everything was
very still. A tinkle of cutlery and a slight jingle of glasses
were heard. Mr. Van Wyk’s servants were laying the table for two
on the veranda.</p>

<p>"I’m afraid you give me no credit whatever for my good intentions
in the matter I’ve spoken to you about," said Sterne.</p>

<p>"I simply don’t understand you."</p>

<p>"Captain Whalley is a very audacious man, but he will understand
that his game is up. That’s all that anybody need ever know of
it from me. Believe me, I am very considerate in this, but duty
is duty. I don’t want to make a fuss. All I ask you, as his friend,
is to tell him from me that the game’s up. That will be sufficient."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Wyk felt a loathsome dismay at this queer privilege of
friendship. He would not demean himself by asking for the slightest
explanation; to drive the other away with contumely he did not
think prudent&mdash;as yet, at any rate. So much assurance staggered
him. Who could tell what there could be in it, he thought? His
regard for Captain Whalley had the tenacity of a disinterested
sentiment, and his practical instinct coming to his aid, he concealed
his scorn.</p>

<p>"I gather, then, that this is something grave."</p>

<p>"Very grave," Sterne assented solemnly, delighted at having produced
an effect at last. He was ready to add some effusive protestations
of regret at the "unavoidable necessity," but Mr. Van Wyk cut
him short&mdash;very civilly, however.</p>

<p>Once on the veranda Mr. Van Wyk put his hands in his pockets,
and, straddling his legs, stared down at a black panther skin
lying on the floor before a rocking-chair. "It looks as if the
fellow had not the pluck to play his own precious game openly,"
he thought.</p>

<p>This was true enough. In the face of Massy’s last rebuff Sterne
dared not declare his knowledge. His object was simply to get
charge of the steamer and keep it for some time. Massy would never
forgive him for forcing himself on; but if Captain Whalley left
the ship of his own accord, the command would devolve upon him
for the rest of the trip; so he hit upon the brilliant idea of
scaring the old man away. A vague menace, a mere hint, would be
enough in such a brazen case; and, with a strange admixture of
compassion, he thought that Batu Beru was a very good place for
throwing up the sponge. The skipper could go ashore quietly, and
stay with that Dutchman of his. Weren’t these two as thick as
thieves together? And on reflection he seemed to see that there
was a way to work the whole thing through that great friend of
the old man’s. This was another brilliant idea. He had an inborn
preference for circuitous methods. In this particular case he
desired to remain in the background as much as possible, to avoid
exasperating Massy needlessly. No fuss! Let it all happen naturally.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Wyk all through the dinner was conscious of a sense of
isolation that invades sometimes the closeness of human intercourse.
Captain Whalley failed lamentably and obviously in his attempts
to eat something. He seemed overcome by a strange absentmindedness.
His hand would hover irresolutely, as if left without guidance
by a preoccupied mind. Mr. Van Wyk had heard him coming up from
a long way off in the profound stillness of the river-side, and
had noticed the irresolute character of the footfalls. The toe
of his boot had struck the bottom stair as though he had come
along mooning with his head in the air right up to the steps of
the veranda. Had the captain of the Sofala been another sort of
man he would have suspected the work of age there. But one glance
at him was enough. Time&mdash;after, indeed, marking him for its own&mdash;had
given him up to his usefulness, in which his simple faith would
see a proof of Divine mercy. "How could I contrive to warn him?"
Mr. Van Wyk wondered, as if Captain Whalley had been miles and
miles away, out of sight and earshot of all evil. He was sickened
by an immense disgust of Sterne. To even mention his threat to
a man like Whalley would be positively indecent. There was something
more vile and insulting in its hint than in a definite charge
of crime&mdash;the debasing taint of blackmailing. "What could anyone
bring against him?" he asked himself. This was a limpid personality.
"And for what object?" The Power that man trusted had thought
fit to leave him nothing on earth that envy could lay hold of,
except a bare crust of bread.</p>

<p>"Won’t you try some of this?" he asked, pushing a dish slightly.
Suddenly it seemed to Mr. Van Wyk that Sterne might possibly be
coveting the command of the Sofala. His cynicism was quite startled
by what looked like a proof that no man may count himself safe
from his kind unless in the very abyss of misery. An intrigue
of that sort was hardly worth troubling about, he judged; but
still, with such a fool as Massy to deal with, Whalley ought to
and must be warned.</p>

<p>At this moment Captain Whalley, bolt upright, the deep cavities
of the eyes overhung by a bushy frown, and one large brown hand
resting on each side of his empty plate, spoke across the tablecloth
abruptly&mdash;"Mr. Van Wyk, you’ve always treated me with the most
humane consideration."</p>

<p>"My dear captain, you make too much of a simple fact that I am
not a savage." Mr. Van Wyk, utterly revolted by the thought of
Sterne’s obscure attempt, raised his voice incisively, as if the
mate had been hiding somewhere within earshot. "Any consideration
I have been able to show was no more than the rightful due of
a character I’ve learned to regard by this time with an esteem
that nothing can shake."</p>

<p>A slight ring of glass made him lift his eyes from the slice
of pine-apple he was cutting into small pieces on his plate. In
changing his position Captain Whalley had contrived to upset an
empty tumbler.</p>

<p>Without looking that way, leaning sideways on his elbow, his
other hand shading his brow, he groped shakily for it, then desisted.
Van Wyk stared blankly, as if something momentous had happened
all at once. He did not know why he should feel so startled; but
he forgot Sterne utterly for the moment.</p>

<p>"Why, what’s the matter?"</p>

<p>And Captain Whalley, half-averted, in a deadened, agitated voice,
muttered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Esteem!"</p>

<p>"And I may add something more," Mr. Van Wyk, very steady-eyed,
pronounced slowly.</p>

<p>"Hold! Enough!" Captain Whalley did not change his attitude or
raise his voice. "Say no more! I can make you no return. I am
too poor even for that now. Your esteem is worth having. You are
not a man that would stoop to deceive the poorest sort of devil
on earth, or make a ship unseaworthy every time he takes her to
sea."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Wyk, leaning forward, his face gone pink all over, with
the starched table-napkin over his knees, was inclined to mistrust
his senses, his power of comprehension, the sanity of his guest.</p>

<p>"Where? Why? In the name of God!&mdash;what’s this? What ship? I don’t
understand who . . ."</p>

<p>"Then, in the name of God, it is I! A ship’s unseaworthy when
her captain can’t see. I am going blind."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Wyk made a slight movement, and sat very still afterwards
for a few seconds; then, with the thought of Sterne’s "The game’s
up," he ducked under the table to pick up the napkin which had
slipped off his knees. This was the game that was up. And at the
same time the muffled voice of Captain Whalley passed over him&mdash;</p>

<p>"I’ve deceived them all. Nobody knows."</p>

<p>He emerged flushed to the eyes. Captain Whalley, motionless under
the full blaze of the lamp, shaded his face with his hand.</p>

<p>"And you had that courage?"</p>

<p>"Call it by what name you like. But you are a humane man&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;gentleman,
Mr. Van Wyk. You may have asked me what I had done with my conscience."</p>

<p>He seemed to muse, profoundly silent, very still in his mournful
pose.</p>

<p>"I began to tamper with it in my pride. You begin to see a lot
of things when you are going blind. I could not be frank with
an old chum even. I was not frank with Massy&mdash;no, not altogether.
I knew he took me for a wealthy sailor fool, and I let him. I
wanted to keep up my importance&mdash;because there was poor Ivy away
there&mdash;my daughter. What did I want to trade on his misery for?
I did trade on it&mdash;for her. And now, what mercy could I expect
from him? He would trade on mine if he knew it. He would hunt
the old fraud out, and stick to the money for a year. Ivy’s money.
And I haven’t kept a penny for myself. How am I going to live
for a year. A year! In a year there will be no sun in the sky
for her father."</p>

<p>His deep voice came out, awfully veiled, as though he had been
overwhelmed by the earth of a landslide, and talking to you of
the thoughts that haunt the dead in their graves. A cold shudder
ran down Mr. Van Wyk’s back.</p>

<p>"And how long is it since you have . . .?" he began.</p>

<p>"It was a long time before I could bring myself to believe in
this&mdash;this visitation." Captain Whalley spoke with gloomy patience
from under his hand.</p>

<p>He had not thought he had deserved it. He had begun by deceiving
himself from day to day, from week to week. He had the Serang
at hand there&mdash;an old servant. It came on gradually, and when
he could no longer deceive himself . . .</p>

<p>His voice died out almost.</p>

<p>"Rather than give her up I set myself to deceive you all."</p>

<p>"It’s incredible," whispered Mr. Van Wyk. Captain Whalley’s appalling
murmur flowed on.</p>

<p>"Not even the sign of God’s anger could make me forget her. How
could I forsake my child, feeling my vigor all the time&mdash;the blood
warm within me? Warm as yours. It seems to me that, like the blinded
Samson, I would find the strength to shake down a temple upon
my head. She’s a struggling woman&mdash;my own child that we used to
pray over together, my poor wife and I. Do you remember that day
I as well as told you that I believed God would let me live to
a hundred for her sake? What sin is there in loving your child?
Do you see it? I was ready for her sake to live for ever. I half
believed I would. I’ve been praying for death since. Ha! Presumptuous
man&mdash;you wanted to live . . ."</p>

<p>A tremendous, shuddering upheaval of that big frame, shaken by
a gasping sob, set the glasses jingling all over the table, seemed
to make the whole house tremble to the roof-tree. And Mr. Van
Wyk, whose feeling of outraged love had been translated into a
form of struggle with nature, understood very well that, for that
man whose whole life had been conditioned by action, there could
exist no other expression for all the emotions; that, to voluntarily
cease venturing, doing, enduring, for his child’s sake, would
have been exactly like plucking his warm love for her out of his
living heart. Something too monstrous, too impossible, even to
conceive.</p>

<p>Captain Whalley had not changed his attitude, that seemed to
express something of shame, sorrow, and defiance.</p>

<p>"I have even deceived you. If it had not been for that word ‘esteem.’
These are not the words for me. I would have lied to you. Haven’t
I lied to you? Weren’t you going to trust your property on board
this very trip?"</p>

<p>"I have a floating yearly policy," Mr. Van Wyk said almost unwittingly,
and was amazed at the sudden cropping up of a commercial detail.</p>

<p>"The ship is unseaworthy, I tell you. The policy would be invalid
if it were known . . ."</p>

<p>"We shall share the guilt, then."</p>

<p>"Nothing could make mine less," said Captain Whalley.</p>

<p>He had not dared to consult a doctor; the man would have perhaps
asked who he was, what he was doing; Massy might have heard something.
He had lived on without any help, human or divine. The very prayers
stuck in his throat. What was there to pray for? and death seemed
as far as ever. Once he got into his cabin he dared not come out
again; when he sat down he dared not get up; he dared not raise
his eyes to anybody’s face; he felt reluctant to look upon the
sea or up to the sky. The world was fading before his great fear
of giving himself away. The old ship was his last friend; he was
not afraid of her; he knew every inch of her deck; but at her
too he hardly dared to look, for fear of finding he could see
less than the day before. A great incertitude enveloped him. The
horizon was gone; the sky mingled darkly with the sea. Who was
this figure standing over yonder? what was this thing lying down
there? And a frightful doubt of the reality of what he could see
made even the remnant of sight that remained to him an added torment,
a pitfall always open for his miserable pretense. He was afraid
to stumble inexcusably over something&mdash;to say a fatal Yes or No
to a question. The hand of God was upon him, but it could not
tear him away from his child. And, as if in a nightmare of humiliation,
every featureless man seemed an enemy.</p>

<p>He let his hand fall heavily on the table. Mr. Van Wyk, arms
down, chin on breast, with a gleam of white teeth pressing on
the lower lip, meditated on Sterne’s "The game’s up."</p>

<p>"The Serang of course does not know."</p>

<p>"Nobody," said Captain Whalley, with assurance.</p>

<p>"Ah yes. Nobody. Very well. Can you keep it up to the end of
the trip? That is the last under the agreement with Massy."</p>

<p>Captain Whalley got up and stood erect, very stately, with the
great white beard lying like a silver breastplate over the awful
secret of his heart. Yes; that was the only hope there was for
him of ever seeing her again, of securing the money, the last
he could do for her, before he crept away somewhere&mdash;useless,
a burden, a reproach to himself. His voice faltered.</p>

<p>"Think of it! Never see her any more: the only human being besides
myself now on earth that can remember my wife. She’s just like
her mother. Lucky the poor woman is where there are no tears shed
over those they loved on earth and that remain to pray not to
be led into temptation&mdash;because, I suppose, the blessed know the
secret of grace in God’s dealings with His created children."</p>

<p>He swayed a little, said with austere dignity&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don’t. I know only the child He has given me."</p>

<p>And he began to walk. Mr. Van Wyk, jumping up, saw the full meaning
of the rigid head, the hesitating feet, the vaguely extended hand.
His heart was beating fast; he moved a chair aside, and instinctively
advanced as if to offer his arm. But Captain Whalley passed him
by, making for the stairs quite straight.</p>

<p>"He could not see me at all out of his line," Van Wyk thought,
with a sort of awe. Then going to the head of the stairs, he asked
a little tremulously&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is it like&mdash;like a mist&mdash;like . . ."</p>

<p>Captain Whalley, half-way down, stopped, and turned round undismayed
to answer.</p>

<p>"It is as if the light were ebbing out of the world. Have you
ever watched the ebbing sea on an open stretch of sands withdrawing
farther and farther away from you? It is like this&mdash;only there
will be no flood to follow. Never. It is as if the sun were growing
smaller, the stars going out one by one. There can’t be many left
that I can see by this. But I haven’t had the courage to look
of late . . ." He must have been able to make out Mr. Van Wyk,
because he checked him by an authoritative gesture and a stoical&mdash;</p>

<p>"I can get about alone yet."</p>

<p>It was as if he had taken his line, and would accept no help
from men, after having been cast out, like a presumptuous Titan,
from his heaven. Mr. Van Wyk, arrested, seemed to count the footsteps
right out of earshot. He walked between the tables, tapping smartly
with his heels, took up a paper-knife, dropped it after a vague
glance along the blade; then happening upon the piano, struck
a few chords again and again, vigorously, standing up before the
keyboard with an attentive poise of the head like a piano-tuner;
closing it, he pivoted on his heels brusquely, avoided the little
terrier sleeping trustfully on crossed forepaws, came upon the
stairs next, and, as though he had lost his balance on the top
step, ran down headlong out of the house. His servants, beginning
to clear the table, heard him mutter to himself (evil words no
doubt) down there, and then after a pause go away with a strolling
gait in the direction of the wharf.</p>

<p>The bulwarks of the Sofala lying alongside the bank made a low,
black wall on the undulating contour of the shore. Two masts and
a funnel uprose from behind it with a great rake, as if about
to fall: a solid, square elevation in the middle bore the ghostly
shapes of white boats, the curves of davits, lines of rail and
stanchions, all confused and mingling darkly everywhere; but low
down, amidships, a single lighted port stared out on the night,
perfectly round, like a small, full moon, whose yellow beam caught
a patch of wet mud, the edge of trodden grass, two turns of heavy
cable wound round the foot of a thick wooden post in the ground.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Wyk, peering alongside, heard a muzzy boastful voice
apparently jeering at a person called Prendergast. It mouthed
abuse thickly, choked; then pronounced very distinctly the word
"Murphy," and chuckled. Glass tinkled tremulously. All these sounds
came from the lighted port. Mr. Van Wyk hesitated, stooped; it
was impossible to look through unless he went down into the mud.</p>

<p>"Sterne," he said, half aloud.</p>

<p>The drunken voice within said gladly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sterne&mdash;of course. Look at him blink. Look at him! Sterne, Whalley,
Massy. Massy, Whalley, Sterne. But Massy’s the best. You can’t
come over him. He would just love to see you starve."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Wyk moved away, made out farther forward a shadowy head
stuck out from under the awnings as if on the watch, and spoke
quietly in Malay, "Is the mate asleep?"</p>

<p>"No. Here, at your service."</p>

<p>In a moment Sterne appeared, walking as noiselessly as a cat
on the wharf.</p>

<p>"It’s so jolly dark, and I had no idea you would be down to-night."</p>

<p>"What’s this horrible raving?" asked Mr. Van Wyk, as if to explain
the cause of a shudder than ran over him audibly.</p>

<p>"Jack’s broken out on a drunk. That’s our second. It’s his way.
He will be right enough by to-morrow afternoon, only Mr. Massy
will keep on worrying up and down the deck. We had better get
away."</p>

<p>He muttered suggestively of a talk "up at the house." He had
long desired to effect an entrance there, but Mr. Van Wyk nonchalantly
demurred: it would not, he feared, be quite prudent, perhaps;
and the opaque black shadow under one of the two big trees left
at the landing-place swallowed them up, impenetrably dense, by
the side of the wide river, that seemed to spin into threads of
glitter the light of a few big stars dropped here and there upon
its outspread and flowing stillness.</p>

<p>"The situation is grave beyond doubt," Mr. Van Wyk said. Ghost-like
in their white clothes they could not distinguish each others’
features, and their feet made no sound on the soft earth. A sort
of purring was heard. Mr. Sterne felt gratified by such a beginning.</p>

<p>"I thought, Mr. Van Wyk, a gentleman of your sort would see at
once how awkwardly I was situated."</p>

<p>"Yes, very. Obviously his health is bad. Perhaps he’s breaking
up. I see, and he himself is well aware &mdash;I assume I am speaking
to a man of sense&mdash;he is well aware that his legs are giving out."</p>

<p>"His legs&mdash;ah!" Mr. Sterne was disconcerted, and then turned
sulky. "You may call it his legs if you like; what I want to know
is whether he intends to clear out quietly. That’s a good one,
too! His legs! Pooh!"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. Only look at the way he walks." Mr. Van Wyk took him
up in a perfectly cool and undoubting tone. "The question, however,
is whether your sense of duty does not carry you too far from
your true interest. After all, I too could do something to serve
you. You know who I am."</p>

<p>"Everybody along the Straits has heard of you, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Wyk presumed that this meant something favorable. Sterne
had a soft laugh at this pleasantry. He should think so! To the
opening statement, that the partnership agreement was to expire
at the end of this very trip, he gave an attentive assent. He
was aware. One heard of nothing else on board all the blessed
day long. As to Massy, it was no secret that he was in a jolly
deep hole with these worn-out boilers. He would have to borrow
somewhere a couple of hundred first of all to pay off the captain;
and then he would have to raise money on mortgage upon the ship
for the new boilers&mdash;that is, if he could find a lender at all.
At best it meant loss of time, a break in the trade, short earnings
for the year&mdash;and there was always the danger of having his connection
filched away from him by the Germans. It was whispered about that
he had already tried two firms. Neither would have anything to
do with him. Ship too old, and the man too well known in the place.
. . . Mr. Sterne’s final rapid winking remained buried in the
deep darkness sibilating with his whispers.</p>

<p>"Supposing, then, he got the loan," Mr. Van Wyk resumed in a
deliberate undertone, "on your own showing he’s more than likely
to get a mortgagee’s man thrust upon him as captain. For my part,
I know that I would make that very stipulation myself if I had
to find the money. And as a matter of fact I am thinking of doing
so. It would be worth my while in many ways. Do you see how this
would bear on the case under discussion?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. I am sure you couldn’t get anybody that would
care more for your interests."</p>

<p>"Well, it suits my interest that Captain Whalley should finish
his time. I shall probably take a passage with you down the Straits.
If that can be done, I’ll be on the spot when all these changes
take place, and in a position to look after <em>your</em> interests."</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Wyk, I want nothing better. I am sure I am infinitely
. . ."</p>

<p>"I take it, then, that this may be done without any trouble."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, what risk there is can’t be helped; but (speaking
to you as my employer now) the thing is more safe than it looks.
If anybody had told me of it I wouldn’t have believed it, but
I have been looking on myself. That old Serang has been trained
up to the game. There’s nothing the matter with his&mdash;his&mdash;limbs,
sir. He’s got used to doing things himself in a remarkable way.
And let me tell you, sir, that Captain Whalley, poor man, is by
no means useless. Fact. Let me explain to you, sir. He stiffens
up that old monkey of a Malay, who knows well enough what to do.
Why, he must have kept captain’s watches in all sorts of country
ships off and on for the last five-and-twenty years. These natives,
sir, as long as they have a white man close at the back, will
go on doing the right thing most surprisingly well&mdash;even if left
quite to themselves. Only the white man must be of the sort to
put starch into them, and the captain is just the one for that.
Why, sir, he has drilled him so well that now he needs hardly
speak at all. I have seen that little wrinkled ape made to take
the ship out of Pangu Bay on a blowy morning and on all through
the islands; take her out first-rate, sir, dodging under the old
man’s elbow, and in such quiet style that you could not have told
for the life of you which of the two was doing the work up there.
That’s where our poor friend would be still of use to the ship
even if&mdash;if&mdash;he could no longer lift a foot, sir. Provided the
Serang does not know that there’s anything wrong."</p>

<p>"He doesn’t."</p>

<p>"Naturally not. Quite beyond his apprehension. They aren’t capable
of finding out anything about us, sir."</p>

<p>"You seem to be a shrewd man," said Mr. Van Wyk in a choked mutter,
as though he were feeling sick.</p>

<p>"You’ll find me a good enough servant, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Sterne hoped now for a handshake at least, but unexpectedly,
with a "What’s this? Better not to be seen together," Mr. Van
Wyk’s white shape wavered, and instantly seemed to melt away in
the black air under the roof of boughs. The mate was startled.
Yes. There was that faint thumping clatter.</p>

<p>He stole out silently from under the shade. The lighted port-hole
shone from afar. His head swam with the intoxication of sudden
success. What a thing it was to have a gentleman to deal with!
He crept aboard, and there was something weird in the shadowy
stretch of empty decks, echoing with shouts and blows proceeding
from a darker part amidships. Mr. Massy was raging before the
door of the berth: the drunken voice within flowed on undisturbed
in the violent racket of kicks.</p>

<p>"Shut up! Put your light out and turn in, you confounded swilling
pig&mdash;you! D’you hear me, you beast?"</p>

<p>The kicking stopped, and in the pause the muzzy oracular voice
announced from within&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! Massy, now&mdash;that’s another thing. Massy’s deep."</p>

<p>"Who’s that aft there? You, Sterne? He’ll drink himself into
a fit of horrors." The chief engineer appeared vague and big at
the corner of the engineroom.</p>

<p>"He will be good enough for duty to-morrow. I would let him be,
Mr. Massy."</p>

<p>Sterne slipped away into his berth, and at once had to sit down.
His head swam with exultation. He got into his bunk as if in a
dream. A feeling of profound peace, of pacific joy, came over
him. On deck all was quiet.</p>

<p>Mr. Massy, with his ear against the door of Jack’s cabin, listened
critically to a deep stertorous breathing within. This was a dead-drunk
sleep. The bout was over: tranquilized on that score, he too went
in, and with slow wriggles got out of his old tweed jacket. It
was a garment with many pockets, which he used to put on at odd
times of the day, being subject to sudden chilly fits, and when
he felt warmed he would take it off and hang it about anywhere
all over the ship. It would be seen swinging on belaying-pins,
thrown over the heads of winches, suspended on people’s very door-handles
for that matter. Was he not the owner? But his favorite place
was a hook on a wooden awning stanchion on the bridge, almost
against the binnacle. He had even in the early days more than
one tussle on that point with Captain Whalley, who desired the
bridge to be kept tidy. He had been overawed then. Of late, though,
he had been able to defy his partner with impunity. Captain Whalley
never seemed to notice anything now. As to the Malays, in their
awe of that scowling man not one of the crew would dream of laying
a hand on the thing, no matter where or what it swung from.</p>

<p>With an unexpectedness which made Mr. Massy jump and drop the
coat at his feet, there came from the next berth the crash and
thud of a headlong, jingling, clattering fall. The faithful Jack
must have dropped to sleep suddenly as he sat at his revels, and
now had gone over chair and all, breaking, as it seemed by the
sound, every single glass and bottle in the place. After the terrific
smash all was still for a time in there, as though he had killed
himself outright on the spot. Mr. Massy held his breath. At last
a sleepy uneasy groaning sigh was exhaled slowly on the other
side of the bulkhead.</p>

<p>"I hope to goodness he’s too drunk to wake up now," muttered
Mr. Massy.</p>

<p>The sound of a softly knowing laugh nearly drove him to despair.
He swore violently under his breath. The fool would keep him awake
all night now for certain. He cursed his luck. He wanted to forget
his maddening troubles in sleep sometimes. He could detect no
movements. Without apparently making the slightest attempt to
get up, Jack went on sniggering to himself where he lay; then
began to speak, where he had left off as it were&mdash;</p>

<p>"Massy! I love the dirty rascal. He would like to see his poor
old Jack starve&mdash;but just you look where he has climbed to." .
. . He hiccoughed in a superior, leisurely manner. . . . "Ship-owning
it with the best. A lottery ticket you want. Ha! ha! I will give
you lottery tickets, my boy. Let the old ship sink and the old
chum starve&mdash;that’s right. He don’t go wrong &mdash;Massy don’t.
Not he. He’s a genius&mdash;that man is. That’s the way to win your
money. Ship and chum must go."</p>

<p>"The silly fool has taken it to heart," muttered Massy to himself.
And, listening with a softened expression of face for any slight
sign of returning drowsiness, he was discouraged profoundly by
a burst of laughter full of joyful irony.</p>

<p>"Would like to see her at the bottom of the sea! Oh, you clever,
clever devil! Wish her sunk, eh? I should think you would, my
boy; the damned old thing and all your troubles with her. Rake
in the insurance money &mdash;turn your back on your old chum&mdash;all’s
well&mdash;gentleman again."</p>

<p>A grim stillness had come over Massy’s face. Only his big black
eyes rolled uneasily. The raving fool. And yet it was all true.
Yes. Lottery tickets, too. All true. What? Beginning again? He
wished he wouldn’t. . . .</p>

<p>But it was even so. The imaginative drunkard on the other side
of the bulkhead shook off the deathlike stillness that after his
last words had fallen on the dark ship moored to a silent shore.</p>

<p>"Don’t you dare to say anything against George Massy, Esquire.
When he’s tired of waiting he will do away with her. Look out!
Down she goes&mdash;chum and all. He’ll know how to . . ."</p>

<p>The voice hesitated, weary, dreamy, lost, as if dying away in
a vast open space.</p>

<p>". . . Find a trick that will work. He’s up to it&mdash;never fear
. . ."</p>

<p>He must have been very drunk, for at last the heavy sleep gripped
him with the suddenness of a magic spell, and the last word lengthened
itself into an interminable, noisy, in-drawn snore. And then even
the snoring stopped, and all was still.</p>

<p>But it seemed as though Mr. Massy had suddenly come to doubt
the efficacy of sleep as against a man’s troubles; or perhaps
he had found the relief he needed in the stillness of a calm contemplation
that may contain the vivid thoughts of wealth, of a stroke of
luck, of long idleness, and may bring before you the imagined
form of every desire; for, turning about and throwing his arms
over the edge of his bunk, he stood there with his feet on his
favorite old coat, looking out through the round port into the
night over the river. Sometimes a breath of wind would enter and
touch his face, a cool breath charged with the damp, fresh feel
from a vast body of water. A glimmer here and there was all he
could see of it; and once he might after all suppose he had dozed
off, since there appeared before his vision, unexpectedly and
connected with no dream, a row of flaming and gigantic figures&mdash;three
naught seven one two&mdash;making up a number such as you may see on
a lottery ticket. And then all at once the port was no longer
black: it was pearly gray, framing a shore crowded with houses,
thatched roof beyond thatched roof, walls of mats and bamboo,
gables of carved teak timber. Rows of dwellings raised on a forest
of piles lined the steely band of the river, brimful and still,
with the tide at the turn. This was Batu Beru&mdash;and the day had
come.</p>

<p>Mr. Massy shook himself, put on the tweed coat, and, shivering
nervously as if from some great shock, made a note of the number.
A fortunate, rare hint that. Yes; but to pursue fortune one wanted
money&mdash;ready cash.</p>

<p>Then he went out and prepared to descend into the engine-room.
Several small jobs had to be seen to, and Jack was lying dead
drunk on the floor of his cabin, with the door locked at that.
His gorge rose at the thought of work. Ay! But if you wanted to
do nothing you had to get first a good bit of money. A ship won’t
save you. He cursed the Sofala. True, all true. He was tired of
waiting for some chance that would rid him at last of that ship
that had turned out a curse on his life.</p>
