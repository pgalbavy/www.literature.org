<p>Professor Grimcke and Jared Long stood like a couple of warriors,
exhausted from the desperate conflict which they had been waging
for hours.</p>

<p>And yet the sanguinary contest had lasted but a few minutes,
while they who had wrought all this destruction did little more
than stand, aim and fire their guns.  The task of the natives
was tenfold harder, as the results were tenfold worse against
them.</p>

<p>Like old hunters, the first thing the explorers did was to fill
the magazines of their Winchesters with cartridges, after which
their revolvers were reloaded.  Then they were ready for business
again.</p>

<p>At this moment, Bippo and Pedros crept from the wood, the picture
of quaking terror.  They had been roused at the beginning of the
tumult, but deeming discretion the better part of valor, scrambled
farther back into the forest, where they remained almost dead
with fright, until sure the awful scene was over.</p>

<p>There can be little question that Quincal was as much terrified
as they and possibly more.  It was his very excess of panic, which
turned his head, and caused him to do that which would have been
beyond his power under other circumstances.</p>

<p>When they saw the dead body of their comrade, Bippo and Pedros
broke into loud lamentations.  There could be no doubt that they
mourned the poor fellow as much as did the explorers who had witnessed
his death.</p>

<p>The surroundings of the camp were so frightful that the Professor
proposed they should get beyond sight of it by drifting further
down stream, a proposal to which his companion willingly agreed.</p>

<p>What should be done with the body of Quincal?  This was the question
which caused the party to hesitate a minute or two after the canoe
was shoved into the water and ready to float down stream.</p>

<p>The wishes of his companions were asked, and Bippo replied that
the most fitting burial, and one in accordance with the peculiar
customs of their people, was to give it burial in the Xingu.</p>

<p>This was in consonance with the feelings of Grimcke and Long,
and they at once made arrangements to carry out the plan.</p>

<p>The remains were tenderly carried into the boat, and a large
stone fastened by means of a piece of rope to the ankles, which
were tied together.  Then the craft was paddled to the middle
of the river, and the body carefully lifted over the side.  Holding
it thus suspended for a minute or two, Jared Long and the Professor
lifted their hats and closed their eyes while the New Englander
uttered a brief prayer, committing the soul to Him who gave it,
commending the other body, lying alone in the dark forest where
it had fallen, to the same merciful Father, and beseeching his
protection to the living through the perils by which they were
environed.  A splash followed, and all that was mortal of the
native sank out of sight to sleep until awakened by the trump
of the resurrection morn.</p>

<p>The sad duty completed, the attention of the party was given
to the duties before them.</p>

<p>It was a sorrowful reflection, that, since the set of sun, two
of their number had yielded up their lives, and they had barely
reached the edge of the Matto Grosso, that land of mystery into
which they hoped to penetrate far enough to learn much that was
yet unknown to the civilized world.</p>

<p>If they were compelled to pay such fearful toll before they were
fairly within the strange region, what was to be the cost of exploring
the wild country itself?</p>

<p>But while Bippo and Pedros were more anxious than ever to leave
the section with its dreadful memories behind them, neither dare
give expression to his thoughts, and the German and American were
not made of the stuff which yields when first exposed to the fire.</p>

<p>They reasoned that if there were no such formidable difficulties
to overcome, others would have visited the country long before
and explored it so fully that nothing would be left for those
who came after them.  The prize is the most valuable for which
the highest price is exacted.  Neither referred to the abandonment
of their work, for no such idea entered their minds.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that during the fearful scenes through
which the leader of the expedition and his friend passed, they
forgot that their friend Fred Ashman was only a short distance
away.  Indeed, one cause for pushing the canoe into the stream
and allowing it to drift with the swift current was that they
might join Fred with the announcement of what had taken place
during his absence.</p>

<p>They supposed that he must have heard the rifle reports and the
yells and shrieks of the natives during the desperate conflict,
for though the rapids gave out a roar which penetrated miles,
yet the sharp discharges and cries of the combatants were of a
nature to be heard still farther.</p>

<p>Had the explorers suspected what was coming, Ashman, of course,
would have staid with his friends; for his services were almost
indispensable.  In fact, but for the singular attempt of the natives
to make captives of the white men, they would have been unable
to withstand the terrific onslaught, despite the vast superiority
of their weapons over those of the assailants.</p>

<p>It never occurred to Grimcke or Long that their friend could
have got into trouble himself.  He was removed from the scene
of conflict, which was over so quickly that he could not have
reached the spot in time to take part, had he started on the instant
the first gun was fired.</p>

<p>But it struck both, while drifting downward and carefully scanning
the shore, as strange that nothing had been seen of Ashman.  Enough
time had now elapsed for him to traverse the intervening distance
several times, and it was to be supposed that he would have put
in an appearance without delay, provided he was free to do so.</p>

<p>The two talked together in low tones, and admitted that there
was something to cause misgiving in Fred's continued absence. 
What could be the explanation?</p>

<p>The Professor was inclined to think their friend had gone farther
down stream than he first intended; but, even if such were the
fact, he hardly could have traveled so far that he would not have
been well on his way back to the battle ground by this time.</p>

<p>The trend of the Xingu was such at this point, that the thin
line of shadow along the wood on their left, as they passed down
the river, steadily widened until it now almost reached the water
itself.  In a short time it would extend over the surface and
afford the canoe that shelter which, had it come earlier in the
evening, might have postponed the desperate conflict with the
savages.</p>

<p>The move from above was merely to get away from the sights that
met them at every turn; and, without seeking to drift to the point
where Ashman was supposed to be waiting, the explorers turned
the prow to land, which they touched a moment later.</p>

<p>It would have been more cheerful to have had a fire burning,
but there was no other call for it.  The mild temperature rendered
it really more enjoyable without it, since the blaze was always
sure to attract innumerable insects, and possibly might tempt
the defeated natives to another effort to wipe out the deadly
insults that had been theirs from the beginning.</p>

<p>It was not yet midnight, nor indeed anywhere near it, but the
Professor volunteered to take his turn with Bippo for the remaining
hours of darkness.  But no such arrangement was necessary, since
every member of the party was rendered wakeful by the exciting
incidents, while the grief of Bippo and Pedros over the loss of
their friend was sure to drive away all slumber for a long time.</p>

<p>The luggage was left in the canoe, where all the party would
have stayed, had not their positions been so cramped as to render
sleeping difficult.  Their blankets were spread on the ground,
where they reclined, talking in low tones, watching, listening,
and speculating as to the cause of Fred Ashman's continued absence.</p>

<p>Long was about to open his mouth to advance a new theory, when
a slight sound apprised him that either the young man they were
talking about, or some one else, was approaching.</p>
