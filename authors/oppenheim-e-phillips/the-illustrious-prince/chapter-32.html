<P>
The library at Devenham Castle was a large and sombre apartment,
with high oriel windows and bookcases reaching to the ceiling. It
had an unused and somewhat austere air. Tonight especially an
atmosphere of gloom seemed to pervade it. The Prince, when he
opened the door, found the three men who were awaiting him seated
at an oval table at the further end of the room.
<P>
"I do not intrude, I trust?" the Prince said. "I understood that
you wished me to come here."
<P>
"Certainly," the Duke answered, "we were sitting here awaiting
your arrival. Will you take this easy chair? The cigarettes are
at your elbow."
<P>
The Prince declined the easy chair and leaned for a moment
against the table.
<P>
"Perhaps later," he said. "Just now I feel that you have
something to say to me. Is it not so? I talk better when I am
standing."
<P>
It was the Prime Minister who made the first plunge. He spoke
without circumlocution, and his tone was graver than usual.
<P>
"Prince," he said, "this is perhaps the last time that we shall
all meet together in this way. You go from us direct to the seat
of your Government. So far there has been very little plain
speaking between us. It would perhaps be more in accord with
etiquette if we let you go without a word, and waited for a
formal interchange of communications between your Ambassador and
ourselves. But we have a feeling, Sir Edward and I, that we
should like to talk to you directly. Before we go any further,
however, let me ask you this question. Have you any objection,
Prince, to discussing a certain matter here with us?"
<P>
The Prince for several moments made no reply. He was still
standing facing the fireplace, leaning slightly against the table
behind him. On his right was the Duke, seated in a library chair.
On his left the Prime Minister and Sir Edward Bransome. The
Prince seemed somehow to have become the central figure of the
little group.
<P>
"Perhaps," he said, "if you had asked me that question a month
ago, Mr. Haviland, I might have replied to you differently.
Circumstances, however, since then have changed. My departure
will take place so soon, and the kindness I have met here from
all of you has been so overwhelming, that if you will let me I
should like to speak of certain things concerning which no
written communication could ever pass between our two countries."
<P>
"I can assure you, my dear Prince, that we shall very much
appreciate your doing so," Mr. Haviland declared.
<P>
"I think," the Prince continued, "that the greatest and the most
subtle of all policies is the policy of perfect truthfulness.
Listen to me, then. The thing which you have in your mind
concerning me is true. Two years I have spent in this country and
in other countries of Europe. These two years have not been spent
in purposeless travel. On the contrary, I have carried with me
always a definite and very fixed purpose."
<P>
The Prime Minister and Bransome exchanged rapid glances.
<P>
"That has been our belief from the first," Bransome remarked.
<P>
"I came to Europe," the Prince continued gravely, "to make a
report to my cousin the Emperor of Japan as to whether I believed
that a renewal of our alliance with you would be advantageous to
my country. I need not shrink from discussing this matter with
you now, for my report is made. It is, even now, on its way to
the Emperor."
<P>
There was a moment's silence, a silence which in this corner of
the great room seemed marked with a certain poignancy. It was the
Prime Minister who broke it.
<P>
"The report," he said, "is out of your hands. The official
decision of your Government will reach us before long. Is there
any reason why you should not anticipate that decision, why you
should not tell us frankly what your advice was?"
<P>
"There is no reason," the Prince answered.  "I will tell you. I
owe that to you at least. I have advised the Emperor not to renew
the treaty."
<P>
"Not to renew," the Prime Minister echoed.
<P>
This time the silence was portentous. It was a blow, and there
was not one of the three men who attempted to hide his dismay.
<P>
"I am afraid," the Prince continued earnestly, "that to you I
must seem something of an ingrate. I have been treated by every
one in this country as the son of a dear friend. The way has been
made smooth for me everywhere. Nothing has been hidden. From all
quarters I have received hospitality which I shall never forget.
But you are three just men. I know you will realize that my duty
was to my country and to my country alone. No one else has any
claims upon me. What I have seen I have written of. What I
believe I have spoken."
<P>
"Prince," Mr. Haviland said, "there is no one here who will
gainsay your honesty. You came to judge us as a nation and you
have found us wanting. At least we can ask you why?"
<P>
The Prince sighed.
<P>
"It is hard," he said. "It is very hard. When I tell you of the
things which I have seen, remember, if you please, that I have
seen them with other eyes than yours. The conditions which you
have grown up amongst and lived amongst all your days pass almost
outside the possibility of your impartial judgment. You have
lived with them too long. They have become a part of you. Then,
too, your national weakness bids your eyes see what you would
have them see."
<P>
"Go on," Mr. Haviland said, drumming idly with his fingers upon
the table.
<P>
"I have had to ask myself," the Prince continued,--"it has been
my business to ask myself what is your position as a great
military power, and the answer I have found is that as a great
military power it does not exist. I have had to ask myself what
would happen to your country in the case of a European war, where
your fleet was distributed to guard your vast possessions in
every quarter of the world, and the answer to that is that you
are, to all practical purposes, defenceless. In almost any
combination which could arrange itself, your country is at the
mercy of the invader."
<P>
Bransome leaned forward in his chair.
<P>
"I can disprove it," he declared firmly. "Come with me to
Aldershot next week, and I will show you that those who say that
we have no army are ignorant alarmists. The Secretary for War
shall show you our new scheme for defensive forces. You have gone
to the wrong authorities for information on these matters,
Prince. You have been entirely and totally misled."
<P>
The Prince drew a little breath.
<P>
"Sir Edward," he said, "I do not speak to you rashly. I have not
looked into these affairs as an amateur. You forget that I have
spent a week at Aldershot, that your Secretary for War gave me
two days of his valuable time. Every figure with which you could
furnish me I am already possessed of. I will be frank with you.
What I saw at Aldershot counted for nothing with me in my
decision. Your standing army is good, beyond a doubt,--a
well-trained machine, an excellent plaything for a General to
move across the chessboard. It might even win battles, and yet
your standing army are mercenaries, and no great nation, from the
days of Babylon, has resisted invasion or held an empire by her
mercenaries."
<P>
"They are English soldiers," Mr. Haviland declared. "I do not
recognize your use of the word."
<P>
"They are paid soldiers," the Prince said, "men who have adopted
soldiering as a profession. Come, I will not pause half-way. I
will tell you what is wrong with your country. You will not
believe it. Some day you will see the truth, and you will
remember my words. It may be that you will realize it a little
sooner, or I would not have dared to speak as I am speaking.
This, then, is the curse which is eating the heart out of your
very existence. The love of his Motherland is no longer a
religion with your young man. Let me repeat that,--I will alter
one word only. The love of his Motherland is no longer THE
religion or even part of the religion of your young man.
Soldiering is a profession for those who embrace it. It is so
that mercenaries are made. I have been to every one of your great
cities in the North. I have been there on a Saturday afternoon,
the national holiday. That is the day in Japan on which our young
men march and learn to shoot, form companies and attend their
drill. Feast days and holidays it is always the same. They do
what tradition has made a necessity for them. They do it without
grumbling, whole-heartedly, with an enthusiasm which has in it
something almost of passion. How do I find the youth of your
country engaged? I have discovered. It is for that purpose that I
have toured through England. They go to see a game played called
football. They sit on seats and smoke and shout. They watch a
score of performers--one score, mind--and the numbers who watch
them are millions. &gt;From town to town I went, and it was always
the same. I see their white faces in a huge amphitheatre, fifteen
thousand here, twenty thousand there, thirty thousand at another
place. They watch and they shout while these men in the arena
play with great skill this wonderful game. When the match is
over, they stream into public houses. Their afternoon has been
spent. They talk it over. Again they smoke and drink. So it is in
one town and another,--so it is everywhere,--the strangest sight
of all that I have seen in Europe. These are your young men, the
material out of which the coming generation must be fashioned?
How many of them can shoot? How many of them can ride? How many
of them have any sort of uniform in which they could prepare to
meet the enemy of their country? What do they know or care for
anything outside their little lives and what they call their love
of sport,--they who spend five days in your grim factories
toiling before machines,--their one afternoon, content to sit and
watch the prowess of others! I speak to these footballers
themselves. They are strong men and swift. They are paid to play
this game. I do not find that even one of them is competent to
strike a blow for his country if she needs him. It is because of
your young men, then, Mr. Haviland, that I cannot advise Japan to
form a new alliance with you. It is because you are not a serious
people. It is because the units of your nation have ceased to
understand that behind the life of every great nation stands the
love of God, whatever god it may be, and the love of Motherland.
These things may not be your fault. They may, indeed, be the
terrible penalty of success. But no one who lives for ever so
short a time amongst you can fail to see the truth. You are
commercialized out of all the greatness of life. Forgive me, all
of you, that I say it so plainly, but you are a race who are on
the downward grade, and Japan seeks for no alliance save with
those whose faces are lifted to the skies."
<P>
The pause which followed was in itself significant. The Duke
alone remained impassive. Bransome's face was dark with anger.
Even the Prime Minister was annoyed. Bransome would have spoken,
but the former held out his hand to check him.
<P>
"If that is really your opinion of us, Prince," he said, "it is
useless to enter into argument with you, especially as you have
already acted upon your convictions. I should like to ask you
this question, though. A few weeks ago an appeal was made to our
young men to bring up to its full strength certain forces which
have been organized for the defence of the country. Do you know
how many recruits we obtained in less than a month?"
<P>
"Fourteen thousand four hundred and seventy-five," the Prince
answered promptly, "out of nearly seven millions who were
eligible. This pitiful result of itself might have been included
amongst my arguments if I had felt that arguments were necessary.
Mr. Haviland, you may drive some of these young men to arms by
persuasion, by appealing to them through their womankind or their
employers, but you cannot create a national spirit. And I tell
you, and I have proved it, that the national spirit is not there.
I will go further," the Prince continued with increased
earnestness, "if you still are not weary of the subject. I will
point out to you how little encouragement the youth of this
country receive from those who are above them in social station.
In every one of your counties there is a hunt, cricket clubs,
golf clubs in such numbers that their statistics absolutely
overwhelm me. Everywhere one meets young men of leisure, well
off, calmly proposing to settle down and spend the best part of
their lives in what they call country life. They will look after
their estates; they will hunt a little, shoot a little, go abroad
for two months in the winter, play golf a little, lawn tennis,
perhaps, or cricket. I tell you that there are hundreds and
thousands of these young men, with money to spare, who have no
uniform which they could wear,--no, I want to change that!" the
Prince cried with an impressive gesture,--"who have no uniform
which they will be able to wear when the evil time comes! How
will they feel then, these young men of family, whose life has
been given to sports and to idle amusements, when their womankind
come shrieking to them for protection and they dare not even
handle a gun or strike a blow! They must stand by and see their
lands laid waste, their womankind insulted. They must see the
land run red with the blood of those who offer a futile
resistance, but they themselves must stand by inactive. They are
not trained to fight as soldiers,--they cannot fight as
civilians."
<P>
"The Prince forgets," Bransome remarked dryly, "that an invasion
of this country--a practical invasion--is very nearly an
impossible thing."
<P>
The Prince laughed softly.
<P>
"My friend," he said, "if I thought that you believed that,
although you are a Cabinet Minister of England I should think
that you were the biggest fool who ever breathed. Today, in
warfare, nothing is impossible. I will guarantee, I who have had
only ten years of soldiering, that if Japan were where Holland is
today, I would halve my strength in ships and I would halve my
strength in men, and I would overrun your country with ease at
any time I chose. You need not agree with me, of course. It is
not a subject which we need discuss. It is, perhaps, out of my
province to allude to it. The feeling which I have in my heart is
this. The laws of history are incontrovertible. So surely as a
great nation has weakened with prosperity, so that her limbs have
lost their suppleness and her finger joints have stiffened, so
surely does the plunderer come in good time. The nation which
loses its citizen army drives the first nail into its own coffin.
I do not say who will invade you, or when, although, to my
thinking, any one could do it. I simply say that in your present
state invasion from some one or other is a sure thing."
<P>
"Without admitting the truth of a single word you have said, my
dear Prince," the Prime Minister remarked, "there is another
aspect of the whole subject which I think that you should
consider. If you find us in so parlous a state, it is surely
scarcely dignified or gracious, on the part of a great nation
like yours, to leave us so abruptly to our fate. Supposing it
were true that we were suffering a little from a period of too
lengthened prosperity, from an attack of over-confidence. Still
think of the part we have played in the past. We kept the world
at bay while you fought with Russia."
<P>
"That," the Prince replied, "was one of the conditions of a
treaty which has expired. If by that treaty our country profited
more than yours, that is still no reason why we should renew it
under altered conditions. Gratitude is an admirable sentiment,
but it has nothing to do with the making of treaties."
<P>
"We are, nevertheless," Bransome declared, "justified in pointing
out to you some of the advantages which you have gained from your
alliance with us. You realize, I suppose, that save for our
intervention the United States would have declared war against
you four months ago?"
<P>
"Your good offices were duly acknowledged by my Government," the
Prince admitted. "Yet what you did was in itself of no
consequence. It is as sure as north is north and south is south
that you and America would never quarrel for the sake of Japan.
That is another reason, if another reason is needed, why a treaty
between us would be valueless. You and I--the whole world knows
that before a cycle of years have passed Japan and America must
fight. When that time comes, it will not be you who will help
us."
<P>
"An alliance duly concluded between this country--"
<P>
The Prince held out both his hands.
<P>
"Listen," he said. "A fortnight ago a certain person in America
wrote and asked you in plain terms what your position would be if
war between Japan and America were declared. What was your
reply?"
<P>
Bransome was on the point of exclaiming, but the Prime Minister
intervened.
<P>
"You appear to be a perfect Secret Service to yourself, Prince,"
he said smoothly. "Perhaps you can also tell us our reply?"
<P>
"I can tell you this much," the Prince answered. "You did not
send word back to Washington that your alliance was a sacred
charge upon your honor and that its terms must be fulfilled to
the uttermost letter. Your reply, I fancy, was more in the nature
of a compromise."
<P>
"How do you know what our reply was?" Mr. Haviland asked.
<P>
"To tell you the truth, I do not," the Prince answered, smiling.
"I have simply told you what I am assured that your answer must
have been. Let us leave this matter. We gain nothing by
discussing it."
<P>
"You have been very candid with us, Prince," Mr. Haviland
remarked. "We gather that you are opposed to a renewal of our
alliance chiefly for two reasons,--first, that you have formed an
unfavorable opinion of our resources and capacity as a nation;
and secondly, because you are seeking an ally who would be of
service to you in one particular eventuality, namely, a war with
the United States. You have spent some time upon the Continent.
May we inquire whether your present attitude is the result of
advances made to you by any other Power? If I am asking too much,
leave my question unanswered."
<P>
The Prince shook his head slowly.
<P>
"Tonight,"he said, "I am speaking to you as one who is willing to
show everything that is in his heart. I will tell you, then. I
have been to Germany, and I can assure you of my own knowledge
that Germany possesses the mightiest fighting machine ever known
in the world's history. That I do truthfully and honestly
believe. Yet listen to me. I have talked to the men and I have
talked to the officers. I have seen them in barracks and on the
parade ground, and I tell you this. When the time arrives for
that machine to be set in motion, it is my profound conviction
that the result will be one of the greatest surprises of modern
times. I say no more, nor must you ask me any questions, but I
tell you that we do not need Germany as an ally. I have been to
Russia, and although our hands have crossed, there can be no real
friendship between our countries till time has wiped out the
memory of our recent conflict. France hates us because it does
not understand us. The future of Japan is just as clear as the
disaster which hangs over Great Britain. There is only one
possible ally for us, only one possible combination. That is what
I have written home to my cousin the Emperor. That is what I pray
that our young professors will teach throughout Japan.. That is
what it will be my mission to teach my country people if the
Fates will that I return safely home. East and West are too far
apart. We are well outside the coming European struggle. Our
strength will come to us from nearer home."
<P>
"China!" the Prime Minister exclaimed.
<P>
"The China of our own making," the Prince declared, a note of
tense enthusiasm creeping into his tone,--"China recreated after
its great lapse of a thousand years. You and I in our lifetime
shall not see it, but there will come a day when the ancient
conquests of Persia and Greece and Rome will seem as nothing
before the all-conquering armies of China and Japan. Until those
days we need no allies. We will have none. We must accept the
insults of America and the rough hand of Germany. We must be
strong enough to wait!"
<P>
A footman entered the room and made his way to the Duke's chair.
<P>
"Your Grace," he said, "a gentleman is ringing up from Downing
Street who says he is speaking from the Home Office."
<P>
"Whom does he want?" the Duke asked.
<P>
"Both Your Grace and Mr. Haviland," the man replied. "He wished
me to say that the matter was of the utmost importance."
<P>
The Duke rose at once and glanced at the clock.
<P>
"It is an extraordinary hour," he remarked, "for Heseltine to be
wanting us. Shall we go and see what it means, Haviland? You will
excuse us, Prince?"
<P>
The Prince bowed.
<P>
"I think that we have talked enough of serious affairs tonight,"
he said. "I shall challenge Sir Edward to a game of billiards."
