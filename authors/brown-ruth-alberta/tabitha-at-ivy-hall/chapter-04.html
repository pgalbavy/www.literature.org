<p>"Tabitha!"</p>

<p>The child was curled in a forlorn heap on the little front stoop
which took the place of piazza to their cottage, staring with
gloomy eyes toward the radiant sunset, but for once unaware of
the glorious beauty of the skies. Her heart was very heavy. In
two days more the school was to give their first exhibition&mdash;that
was what Miss Brooks called it&mdash;in the town hall; and all the
parents and friends were invited to come and hear them speak the
pieces and sing the songs they had been learning ever since school
had commenced, six weeks before. Miss Brooks thought it helped
the scholars to have public exercises occasionally, for it brought
the parents in closer touch with their boys and girls and encouraged
the children to do better work; so she had planned to have these
exhibitions every six weeks or two months in the <em>town hall</em>.
The school house was too small to seat many visitors if all the
scholars were present.</p>

<p>Tabitha was to recite a long selection all by herself, and she
had taken great pride in learning it with appropriate gestures,
conscious of the fact that she was the best speaker in the room,
and happy in the teacher's unstinted praise and her playmates'
envious admiration.</p>

<p>But now! Miss Brooks had asked the girls to wear white dresses,
and Tabitha had none! What a calamity! She had expected to wear
her new green gingham. It wasn't a very pretty color, to be sure,
or very becoming, but she had coaxed Aunt Maria to make it after
the fashion of Carrie's dainty dresses and was delighted with
the result. Now the rest of the girls would be in white, and it
would look dreadful to have one green dress in the splendid array
on the platform. What could she do?</p>

<p>It was useless to ask for a white gown, and even if there were
any possibility of getting the new material it was too late to
make it up in time for the exhibition, for Aunt Maria wasn't a
great success as a seamstress, and it took her a long time to
make a dress. Why, she had worked more than a week on the green
gingham, and that was just tucked! If there could be a white dress
it would have to have ruffles on it; all the other girls' white
dresses had ruffles on them somewhere. Carrie's had two ruffles
on the skirt, and Mamie Cole's had <em>three</em>. Bertha Dean's
had only one ruffle around the shoulders and the skirt was tucked,
but it was very pretty; and if Tabitha could not have ruffles
on the skirt, she would want at least a shoulder ruffle with lace
around it. Well, there was no use in planning, she could not have
a white dress. But how could she face all those people in a green
gingham and be the only odd girl there?</p>

<p>"Tabitha Catt!" The voice was sharp and insistent, and at the
sound of the hateful name almost forgotten now, the child came
suddenly out of her unhappy reverie.</p>

<p>"What is it, Aunt Maria?"</p>

<p>"Where in the world have you been? I've called you half a dozen
times already. Go to my trunk and bring me that box of odd pieces
just under the tray. I want to mend this dress before dark. Mind
you are careful now. The tray is broken; lift it carefully."</p>

<p>Tabitha rose slowly to do her bidding, still thinking of the
dress she did not have. Under ordinary circumstances she considered
it a great honor to be allowed even to lift the cover of the big,
old trunk in the corner, for it contained many wonderful relics
for childish eyes, and sometimes Aunt Maria would let her look
at some of the treasures, and even tell her a little about them
on rare occasions. Today, however, even this prospect was not
alluring, and with listless hands Tabitha pulled the rickety tray
out of its place and bent over the trunk in search of the box
in question. There were several boxes under the tray, but Aunt
Maria never remembered this, and it was always necessary to open
them to discover which was the one wanted. So the child seized
the nearest and pulled off the cover. No pieces in that. But in
the act of replacing the cover she noticed something shining in
a mass of white, and paused to investigate. It was a string of
glistening beads, and as she lifted them from their crushed tissue
wrappings there lay disclosed the shimmering folds of a white
silk dress, carefully laid away with dried "Sweet Mary" leaves.</p>

<p>"Child, are you making those pieces?" The girl started guiltily,
dropped the cover over the box and pulled open its neighbor. There
were the scraps Aunt Maria wanted, and with these in her hands
she scurried out into the kitchen where the fussy old lady sat
sewing in the waning light.</p>

<p>"There are seven boxes just under the tray, Aunt Maria," she
announced. "I opened the wrong one by mistake, and there was a
silk dress inside." She hesitated, not knowing how to ask for
the information she desired, for the aunt, like the father, never
encouraged the asking of questions.</p>

<p>"That was my first silk dress," the woman said reminiscently.
"My grandfather gave it to me when I was a little girl so I could
go to my favorite aunt's wedding. I never wore it but twice, for
my mother did not believe in finery for children, and this being
white, she was afraid it would get soiled. Did you close that
trunk?"</p>

<p>Tabitha went back to put things in order again, but could not
resist one more peep at the enticing box. How beautiful the silk
looked, and how daintily it was made! To be sure, there were no
ruffles adorning the soft folds, but the bottom of the skirt was
beautifully scalloped, so even and nice, and each scallop bound
with a narrow strip of the same material.</p>

<p>She lifted the dress out of its box and looked at it with shining
eyes. How rich one must be to own a silk dress! How she wished
it belonged to her! If it had been hers, she should have worn
it more than twice&mdash;such a dainty, pretty thing as that&mdash;and it
was white. White? Yes. And she wanted a white dress so much.</p>

<p>"Tabitha!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Aunt Maria."</p>

<p>"What are you doing? I want you to set the table. It is almost
supper time and Thomas will soon be here."</p>

<p>Tabitha dropped the dress hastily on the rug beside the trunk,
put the cover on the empty box and slipped it back in its place
with the other six. Down went the tray on top of them, the lid
of the trunk fell with a snap, and the white silk dress was no
longer inside. With beating heart and red face she carried the
garment into her own tiny room and hung it in the very darkest
corner of the closet. Then she ran to set the table.</p>

<p>How the next day ever passed she never knew, for before her eyes
wherever she looked danced that lovely, quaint old gown of shimmering
silk, and she could think of nothing else. It hid the map of Europe
when she opened her geography, it played leap-frog among common
fractions when she tried to do her sums, it waved at the head
of the Continental Army while she led those brave men to victory,
and when it came to spelling class she could think of nothing
but "s-i-l-k."</p>

<p>But Exhibition Day came at last. Aunt Maria was not going, as
Tabitha well knew, so would not see her in the borrowed gown until
too late to raise any objections. She had no intention of wearing
the dress without Aunt Maria's knowledge, but she did intend to
wear it first, and tell about it afterwards, accepting whatever
punishment the woman saw fit to give her for the transgression.
So she smuggled the gown out of the house in her school-bag, and
up among the tall boulders beyond the Carson place, where there
was no possibility of anyone finding her. Here she dressed, and
under one great rock hid the once admired but now despised green
gingham. Then with her long cape covering her quaintly gowned
figure, she hurried up to Carrie's door to call for her playmate,
having waited until the last minute in the hope that her friends
would be gone. Nor was she disappointed. The doors were locked
and no one came to answer her knock; so with flying feet she sped
toward the hall, noting that only a few people were bound in that
direction, and knowing that most of the expected visitors were
already seated within.</p>

<p>"Oh, Theodora Gabrielle!" exclaimed the teacher as the child
flew up the aisle to her place on the platform, "I was so afraid
something had happened to keep you away. It would never do to
have our best speaker absent, you know;" and she smiled into the
shining black eyes of the breathless Tabitha; but the next instant
the smile faded. Tabitha had loosened her cape, and Miss Brooks
caught sight of the quaint, queer old gown underneath. "Child!"
she cried involuntarily. "Whatever possessed you to put on that
rig?"</p>

<p>The beloved silk dress called a "rig!" Tabitha was dismayed,
and the tears came welling into the bright eyes, as with quivering
lip she confessed, "It was the only <em>white</em> dress I could
get, Miss Brooks. I thought it would be very 'propriate, for I
am to speak a war piece, you know. Aunt Maria had this when she
was a little girl, and she must be pretty much older than the
war."</p>

<p>"I meant that the silk was too good for common wear, dear," fibbed
the teacher, seeing the sorrow in the thin, brown, wistful face.
"It is a pretty idea to wear a dress that was made in war times,
and I never would have thought of it myself. But we must take
off the ribbons from your hair, Theodora, and fix it in the old-fashioned
way to go with your gown. I remember a picture of my mother with
her hair done in the queerest braids. Come, we will have to hurry."</p>

<p>As this inspiration flashed through the young teacher's mind,
she saw a way out of the dilemma so that neither child nor school
should be ridiculed because of Tabitha's mistake; and she hurriedly
completed the small girl's "war times toilette" so that when Tabitha
emerged from under her skillful hands she was the admiration and
envy of all her mates. And truly she presented a pretty picture
as she stood before the none too critical audience and recited
<em>Sheridan's Ride</em> with such vim and spirit that every heart
was fired with patriotism and the applause was so prolonged that
Miss Brooks told her she must speak another piece, even though
it was not on the program. Purposely the teacher had left Tabitha's
part in the exercises well toward the last, knowing that she could
be depended upon to make a fitting climax for the afternoon's
program, nor was she disappointed; and she fairly beamed upon
the little girl as she gently pushed her toward the front of the
platform to respond to her encore.</p>

<p>Having done so well with one war piece, Tabitha decided that
<em>Barbara Fritchie</em> was a most appropriate selection to
recite this second time, besides being quite in keeping with her
old-fashioned dress. So she began the familiar lines:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Up from the meadow rich with corn<br/>
Clear in the cool September morn,

</p>
<p>
The clustered spires of Frederick stand<br/>
Green-walled by the hills of Maryland.

</p>
</div>
<p>How she loved that poem, how vividly the whole scene seemed to
lie before her, and how her very soul thrilled as she gave life
to the stirring words!</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Quick, as it fell, from the broken staff<br/>
Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf.

</p>
<p>
She leaned far out on the window-sill,<br/>
And shook it forth with a royal will.

</p>
</div>
<p>Suddenly from among the audience one face seemed to leap before
her eyes,&mdash;white, set, terrified. Tom! And beside him, leaning
forward as he stood near the door, his face grim and threatening,
was her father! Her surroundings were forgotten; she seemed to
be standing beside the dusty road again with a pail of blackberries
at her feet; and with gaze rivetted upon those two figures in
the back of the hall, she recited:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Slap, if you dare, you old gray head,<br/>
I'll scratch like a&mdash;cat&mdash;till you'll wish you were dead.

</p>
</div>
<p>Was there a titter behind her, were the faces in the audience
smiling? Was Miss Brooks speaking her name, were someone's arms
around her trying to drag her to her seat? It seemed an age that
she stood there, words frozen on her lips, heart that seemed to
have ceased its beating, and eyes that looked without seeing.
Then, pausing for neither hat nor cape, she plunged down from
the platform, fled blindly through the aisle and rushed out of
the open door.</p>

<p>Up the rocky path she stumbled, but stopped on the summit of
the first rise. What was the use of running away? He would find
her and the punishment would come sooner or later. It might as
well come now and be over with. Up on the nearest boulder she
crept and waited, a heap of frozen misery. Would he remain until
the exercises were over? How would he punish her?</p>

<p>The waiting was short, although to her it seemed hours before
the parents and children came out of the hall and dispersed to
their various homes. A few passed her on the trail, but she did
not see them&mdash;not even Carrie, sobbing aloud as she stumbled along
beside her mother.</p>

<p>When they were all gone, her father suddenly stood before her.
When he came, or how he got there, she did not know.</p>

<p>"Tabitha Catt," she heard his even tones saying, "get down from
there."</p>

<p>She slid to the ground beside him.</p>

<p>"Come with me."</p>

<p>She turned and followed him, not down the hill to the cottage
as she had expected, but back towards town. The day was warm,
but she was shivering violently, and even her teeth chattered
until it seemed as if the silent man at her side could not fail
to hear them.</p>

<p>"What have you told these people your name was?" the same even
tones demanded.</p>

<p>"Theodora Marcella Gabrielle Julianna Victoria Emeline. I never
told anyone but Carrie and Miss Brooks."</p>

<p>A glimmer of a smile played around the man's stern mouth, hidden
by his moustache.</p>

<p>"And Tom's? What name did you give Tom?"</p>

<p>"Dionysius Ulysses Humphrey Llewelyn."</p>

<p>"Hm, not as long as yours."</p>

<p>"He thought it would do. I had some more he might have had."</p>

<p>"So he called himself that jargon, did he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! He couldn't remember them. That was just my name for
him."</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Tabitha Catt, you have told these people a lie."</p>

<p>Lie? Tabitha was startled. Lie? Was it a lie to change one's
name&mdash;just one's first name? It had not appealed to her in that
light before. But the relentless voice was still speaking. What
was it saying?</p>

<p>"You have stolen your aunt's dress&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not a word yet, Tabitha Catt. When I have finished, you will
have a chance to explain. You are to go to every store and hotel
in this town and say&mdash;listen now, so you will get it straight,
'I told you a lie. My name is Tabitha Catt and not Theodora Marcella
Gabrielle Julianna Victoria Emeline; and my brother's name is
Thomas Catt and not Dionysius Ulysses Humphrey Llewelyn.' Now
go, and don't you miss a single store."</p>

<p>The child's black eyes flashed dangerously, but she obediently
started down the main street of the town, counting on her fingers,
"Two drug stores, three grocery stores&mdash;no, four&mdash;one butcher
shop, two dry goods stores, one millinery shop, three hotels and
the bakery."</p>

<p>The first in line was a hotel, Silver Bow Hotel, the largest
in town, and the office was crowded when she entered. Every head
was lifted and every pair of eyes looked curiously at the odd
little figure in its quaintly scalloped dress and shining black
braids. She hesitated, looked about her in desperation, saw no
familiar face in all the crowd, and haltingly began her dreadful
speech:</p>

<p>"I told you a lie. My name is Tabitha Catt&mdash;" Someone interrupted
with a mocking laugh. She wheeled toward him, shook her tightly
clenched fist, and with blazing eyes continued, "and not Theodora
Marcella Gabrielle Julianna Victoria Emeline; and my brother's
name is Thomas Catt and not Dionysius Ulysses Humphrey Llewelyn.
My father's name is Lynne Maximilian Catt, but you can call him
'lean Manx Catt;' he doesn't like it, but it ain't any worse than
ours. I have an Aunt Maria." She turned as if to go, but paused
to throw back over her shoulder, "My mother's name was Theodora
Marcella. She was a decent woman. The good die young." With a
profound bow she was gone before the spell-bound group had recovered
their breath The next place was a grocery store, and though near
the supper hour, it chanced to be empty, except for the proprietor,
whom she knew, and with him for her audience she spoke her little
piece again, omitting none of it, and leaving him in a state of
utter bewilderment. On down the long street she went, into every
store and shop. Sometimes the people laughed at her, but more
often absolute silence greeted her speech, for her eyes burned
like live coals and her thin face was pale as death, except for
a scarlet spot high on either cheek. In one shop she saw Miss
Brooks, but though the teacher pitied the child with all her heart,
and longed to comfort her, she knew this was no time to say anything,
and was silent with the rest.</p>

<p>So at last the terrible ordeal was over and Tabitha dragged her
feet wearily up the last slope toward home. Her father met her
where she had left him, and greeted her with the remark, "Now,
what have you to say for yourself, Tabitha Catt?"</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes full of scorching scorn and looked straight
into his face so like her own, as she replied with passionate
emphasis, "That you're a beast, lean Manx Catt, and I'm ashamed
of you!"</p>

<p>"She's right," he said to himself, and in silence followed the
fleeing form through the sunset glow toward home.</p>
