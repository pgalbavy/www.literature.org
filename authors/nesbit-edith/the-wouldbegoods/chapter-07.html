You read in books about the pleasures of London, and about how
people who live in the country long for the gay whirl of fashion in
town because the country is so dull.  I do not agree with this at
all.  In London, or at any rate Lewisham, nothing happens unless
you make it happen; or if it happens it doesn't happen to you, and
you don't know the people it does happen to.  But in the country
the most interesting events occur quite freely, and they seem to
happen to you as much as to anyone else.  Very often quite without
your doing anything to help.</p>

<p>The natural and right ways of earning your living in the country
are much jollier than town ones, too; sowing and reaping, and doing
things with animals, are much better sport than fishmongering or
bakering or oil-shopping, and those sort of things, except, of
course, a plumber's and gasfitter's, and he is the same in town or
country - most interesting and like an engineer.</p>

<p>I remember what a nice man it was that came to cut the gas off once
at our old house in Lewisham, when my father's business was feeling
so poorly.  He was a true gentleman, and gave Oswald and Dicky over
two yards and a quarter of good lead piping, and a brass tap that
only wanted a washer, and a whole handful of screws to do what we
liked with.  We screwed the back door up with the screws, I
remember, one night when Eliza was out without leave.  There was an
awful row.  We did not mean to get her into trouble.  We only
thought it would be amusing for her to find the door screwed up
when she came down to take in the milk in the morning.  But I must
not say any more about the Lewisham house.  It is only the
pleasures of memory, and nothing to do with being beavers, or any
sort of exploring.</p>

<p>I think Dora and Daisy are the kind of girls who will grow up very
good, and perhaps marry missionaries.  I am glad Oswald's destiny
looks at present as if it might be different.</p>

<p>We made two expeditions to discover the source of the Nile (or the
North Pole), and owing to their habit of sticking together and
doing dull and praiseable things, like sewing, and helping with the
cooking, and taking invalid delicacies to the poor and indignant,
Daisy and Dora were wholly out of it both times, though Dora's foot
was now quite well enough to have gone to the North Pole or the
Equator either.  They said they did not mind the first time,
because they like to keep themselves clean; it is another of their
queer ways.  And they said they had had a better time than us.  (It
was only a clergyman and his wife who called, and hot cakes for
tea.) The second time they said they were lucky not to have been in
it.  And perhaps they were right.  But let me to my narrating.  I
hope you will like it.  I am going to try to write it a different
way, like the books they give you for a prize at a girls' school - I
mean a 'young ladies' school', of course - not a high school.  High
schools are not nearly so silly as some other kinds.  Here goes:</p>

<p>'&quot;Ah, me!&quot; sighed a slender maiden of twelve summers, removing her
elegant hat and passing her tapery fingers lightly through her fair
tresses, &quot;how sad it is - is it not? - to see able-bodied youths and
young ladies wasting the precious summer hours in idleness and
luxury.&quot;</p>

<p>'The maiden frowned reproachingly, but yet with earnest gentleness,
at the group of youths and maidens who sat beneath an umbragipeaous
beech tree and ate black currants.</p>

<p>'&quot;Dear brothers and sisters,&quot; the blushing girl went on, &quot;could we
not, even now, at the eleventh hour, turn to account these wasted
lives of ours, and seek some occupation at once improving and
agreeable?&quot;</p>

<p>'&quot;I do not quite follow your meaning, dear sister,&quot; replied the
cleverest of her brothers, on whose brow - '</p>

<p>It's no use.  I can't write like these books.  I wonder how the
books' authors can keep it up.</p>

<p>What really happened was that we were all eating black currants in
the orchard, out of a cabbage leaf, and Alice said - </p>

<p>'I say, look here, let's do something.  It's simply silly to waste
a day like this.  It's just on eleven.  Come on!'</p>

<p>And Oswald said, 'Where to?'</p>

<p>This was the beginning of it.</p>

<p>The moat that is all round our house is fed by streams.  One of
them is a sort of open overflow pipe from a good-sized stream that
flows at the other side of the orchard.</p>

<p>It was this stream that Alice meant when she said - </p>

<p>'Why not go and discover the source of the Nile?'</p>

<p>Of course Oswald knows quite well that the source of the real live
Egyptian Nile is no longer buried in that mysteriousness where it
lurked undisturbed for such a long time.  But he was not going to
say so.  It is a great thing to know when not to say things.</p>

<p>'Why not have it an Arctic expedition?' said Dicky; 'then we could
take an ice-axe, and live on blubber and things.  Besides, it
sounds cooler.'</p>

<p>'Vote! vote!' cried Oswald.  So we did.
Oswald, Alice, Noel, and Denny voted for the river of the ibis and
the crocodile.  Dicky, H. O., and the other girls for the region of
perennial winter and rich blubber.</p>

<p>So Alice said, 'We can decide as we go.  Let's start anyway.'</p>

<p>The question of supplies had now to be gone into.  Everybody wanted
to take something different, and nobody thought the other people's
things would be the slightest use.  It is sometimes thus even with
grown-up expeditions.  So then Oswald, who is equal to the hardest
emergency that ever emerged yet, said - </p>

<p>'Let's each get what we like.  The secret storehouse can be the
shed in the corner of the stableyard where we got the door for the
raft.  Then the captain can decide who's to take what.'</p>

<p>This was done.  You may think it but the work of a moment to fit
out an expedition, but this is not so, especially when you know not
whether your exploring party is speeding to Central Africa or
merely to the world of icebergs and the Polar bear.</p>

<p>Dicky wished to take the wood-axe, the coal hammer, a blanket, and
a mackintosh.</p>

<p>H. O. brought a large faggot in case we had to light fires, and a
pair of old skates he had happened to notice in the box-room, in
case the expedition turned out icy.</p>

<p>Noel had nicked a dozen boxes of matches, a spade, and a trowel,
and had also obtained - I know not by what means - a jar of pickled
onions.</p>

<p>Denny had a walking-stick - we can't break him of walking with it - a
book to read in case he got tired of being a discoverer, a
butterfly net and a box with a cork in it, a tennis ball, if we
happened to want to play rounders in the pauses of exploring, two
towels and an umbrella in the event of camping or if the river got
big enough to bathe in or to be fallen into.</p>

<p>Alice had a comforter for Noel in case we got late, a pair of
scissors and needle and cotton, two whole candles in case of caves.</p>

<p>And she had thoughtfully brought the tablecloth off the small table
in the dining-room, so that we could make all the things up into
one bundle and take it in turns to carry it.</p>

<p>Oswald had fastened his master mind entirely on grub.  Nor had the
others neglected this.</p>

<p>All the stores for the expedition were put down on the tablecloth
and the corners tied up.  Then it was more than even Oswald's
muscley arms could raise from the ground, so we decided not to take
it, but only the best-selected grub.  The rest we hid in the straw
loft, for there are many ups and downs in life, and grub is grub at
any time, and so are stores of all kinds.  The pickled onions we
had to leave, but not for ever.</p>

<p>Then Dora and Daisy came along with their arms round each other's
necks as usual, like a picture on a grocer's almanac, and said they
weren't coming.</p>

<p>It was, as I have said, a blazing hot day, and there were
differences of opinion among the explorers about what eatables we
ought to have taken, and H. O. had lost one of his garters and
wouldn't let Alice tie it up with her handkerchief, which the
gentle sister was quite willing to do.  So it was a rather gloomy
expedition that set off that bright sunny day to seek the source of
the river where Cleopatra sailed in Shakespeare (or the frozen
plains Mr Nansen wrote that big book about).</p>

<p>But the balmy calm of peaceful Nature soon made the others less
cross - Oswald had not been cross exactly but only disinclined to do
anything the others wanted - and by the time we had followed the
stream a little way, and had seen a water-rat and shied a stone or
two at him, harmony was restored.  We did not hit the rat.</p>

<p>You will understand that we were not the sort of people to have
lived so long near a stream without plumbing its depths.  Indeed it
was the same stream the sheep took its daring jump into the day we
had the circus.  And of course we had often paddled in it - in the
shallower parts.  But now our hearts were set on exploring.  At
least they ought to have been, but when we got to the place where
the stream goes under a wooden sheep-bridge, Dicky cried, 'A camp!
a camp!' and we were all glad to sit down at once.  Not at all like
real explorers, who know no rest, day or night, till they have got
there (whether it's the North Pole, or the central point of the
part marked 'Desert of Sahara' on old-fashioned maps).</p>

<p>The food supplies obtained by various members were good and plenty
of it.  Cake, hard eggs, sausage-rolls, currants, lemon
cheese-cakes, raisins, and cold apple dumplings.  It was all very
decent, but Oswald could not help feeling that the source of the
Nile (or North Pole) was a long way off, and perhaps nothing much
when you got there.</p>

<p>So he was not wholly displeased when Denny said, as he lay kicking
into the bank when the things to eat were all gone - </p>

<p>'I believe this is clay: did you ever make huge platters and bowls
out of clay and dry them in the sun?  Some people did in a book
called Foul Play, and I believe they baked turtles, or oysters, or
something, at the same time.'</p>

<p>He took up a bit of clay and began to mess it about, like you do
putty when you get hold of a bit.  And at once the heavy gloom that
had hung over the explorers became expelled, and we all got under
the shadow of the bridge and messed about with clay.</p>

<p>'It will be jolly!' Alice said, 'and we can give the huge platters
to poor cottagers who are short of the usual sorts of crockery. 
That would really be a very golden deed.'</p>

<p>It is harder than you would think when you read about it, to make
huge platters with clay.  It flops about as soon as you get it any
size, unless you keep it much too thick, and then when you turn up
the edges they crack.  Yet we did not mind the trouble.  And we had
all got our shoes and stockings off.  It is impossible to go on
being cross when your feet are in cold water; and there is
something in the smooth messiness of clay, and not minding how
dirty you get, that would soothe the savagest breast that ever
beat.</p>

<p>After a bit, though, we gave up the idea of the huge platter and
tried little things.  We made some platters - they were like
flower-pot saucers; and Alice made a bowl by doubling up her fists
and getting Noel to slab the clay on outside.  Then they smoothed
the thing inside and out with wet fingers, and it was a bowl - at
least they said it was.  When we'd made a lot of things we set them
in the sun to dry, and then it seemed a pity not to do the thing
thoroughly.  So we made a bonfire, and when it had burnt down we
put our pots on the soft, white, hot ashes among the little red
sparks, and kicked the ashes over them and heaped more fuel over
the top.  It was a fine fire.</p>

<p>Then tea-time seemed as if it ought to be near, and we decided to
come back next day and get our pots.</p>

<p>As we went home across the fields Dicky looked back and said - </p>

<p>'The bonfire's going pretty strong.'</p>

<p>We looked.  It was.  Great flames were rising to heaven against the
evening sky.  And we had left it,a smouldering flat heap.</p>

<p>'The clay must have caught alight,' H. O. said.  'Perhaps it's the
kind that burns.  I know I've heard of fireclay.  And there's
another sort you can eat.'</p>

<p>'Oh, shut up!' Dicky said with anxious scorn.</p>

<p>With one accord we turned back.  We all felt THE feeling - the one
that means something fatal being up and it being your fault.</p>

<p>'Perhaps, Alice said, 'a beautiful young lady in a muslin dress was
passing by, and a spark flew on to her, and now she is rolling in
agony enveloped in flames.'</p>

<p>We could not see the fire now, because of the corner of the wood,
but we hoped Alice was mistaken.</p>

<p>But when we got in sight of the scene of our pottering industry we
saw it was as bad nearly as Alice's wild dream.  For the wooden
fence leading up to the bridge had caught fire, and it was burning
like billy oh.</p>

<p>Oswald started to run; so did the others.  As he ran he said to
himself, 'This is no time to think about your clothes.  Oswald, be
bold!'</p>

<p>And he was.</p>

<p>Arrived at the site of the conflagration, he saw that caps or straw
hats full of water, however quickly and perseveringly given, would
never put the bridge out, and his eventful past life made him know
exactly the sort of wigging you get for an accident like this.</p>

<p>So he said, 'Dicky, soak your jacket and mine in the stream and
chuck them along.  Alice, stand clear, or your silly girl's
clothes'll catch as sure as fate.'</p>

<p>Dicky and Oswald tore off their jackets, so did Denny, but we would
not let him and H. O. wet theirs.  Then the brave Oswald advanced
warily to the end of the burning rails and put his wet jacket over
the end bit, like a linseed poultice on the throat of a suffering
invalid who has got bronchitis.  The burning wood hissed and
smouldered, and Oswald fell back, almost choked with the smoke. 
But at once he caught up the other wet jacket and put it on another
place, and of course it did the trick as he had known it would do. 
But it was a long job, and the smoke in his eyes made the young
hero obliged to let Dicky and Denny take a turn as they had
bothered to do from the first.  At last all was safe; the devouring
element was conquered.  We covered up the beastly bonfire with clay
to keep it from getting into mischief again, and then Alice said - </p>

<p>'Now we must go and tell.'</p>

<p>'Of course,' Oswald said shortly.  He had meant to tell all the
time.</p>

<p>So we went to the farmer who has the Moat House Farm, and we went
at once, because if you have any news like that to tell it only
makes it worse if you wait about.  When we had told him he said - </p>

<p>'You little  - -.'  I shall not say what he said besides that,
because I am sure he must have been sorry for it next Sunday when
he went to church, if not before.</p>

<p>We did not take any notice of what he said, but just kept on saying
how sorry we were; and he did not take our apology like a man, but
only said he daresayed, just like a woman does.  Then he went to
look at his bridge, and we went in to our tea.  The jackets were
never quite the same again.</p>

<p>Really great explorers would never be discouraged by the daresaying
of a farmer, still less by his calling them names he ought not to. 
Albert's uncle was away so we got no double slating; and next day
we started again to discover the source of the river of cataracts
(or the region of mountain-like icebergs).</p>

<p>We set out, heavily provisioned with a large cake Daisy and Dora
had made themselves, and six bottles of ginger-beer.  I think real
explorers most likely have their ginger-beer in something lighter
to carry than stone bottles.  Perhaps they have it by the cask,
which would come cheaper; and you could make the girls carry it on
their back, like in pictures of the daughters of regiments.</p>

<p>We passed the scene of the devouring conflagration, and the thought
of the fire made us so thirsty we decided to drink the ginger-beer
and leave the bottles in a place of concealment.  Then we went on,
determined to reach our destination, Tropic or Polar, that day.</p>

<p>Denny and H. O. wanted to stop and try to make a fashionable
watering-place at that part where the stream spreads out like a
small-sized sea, but Noel said, 'No.'  We did not like
fashionableness.</p>

<p>'YOU ought to, at any rate,' Denny said.  'A Mr Collins wrote an
Ode to the Fashions, and he was a great poet.'</p>

<p>'The poet Milton wrote a long book about Satan,' Noel said, 'but
I'm not bound to like HIM.'  I think it was smart of Noel.</p>

<p>'People aren't obliged to like everything they write about even,
let alone read,' Alice said.  'Look at &quot;Ruin seize thee, ruthless
king!&quot; and all the pieces of poetry about war, and tyrants, and
slaughtered saints - and the one you made yourself about the black
beetle, Noel.'</p>

<p>By this time we had got by the pondy place and the danger of delay
was past; but the others went on talking about poetry for quite a
field and a half, as we walked along by the banks of the stream. 
The stream was broad and shallow at this part, and you could see
the stones and gravel at the bottom, and millions of baby fishes,
and a sort of skating-spiders walking about on the top of the
water.  Denny said the water must be ice for them to be able to
walk on it, and this showed we were getting near the North Pole. 
But Oswald had seen a kingfisher by the wood, and he said it was an
ibis, so this was even.</p>

<p>When Oswald had had as much poetry as he could bear he said, 'Let's
be beavers and make a dam.'  And everybody was so hot they agreed
joyously, and soon our clothes were tucked up as far as they could
go and our legs looked green through the water, though they were
pink out of it.</p>

<p>Making a dam is jolly good fun, though laborious, as books about
beavers take care to let you know.</p>

<p>Dicky said it must be Canada if we were beavers, and so it was on
the way to the Polar system, but Oswald pointed to his heated brow,
and Dicky owned it was warm for Polar regions.  He had brought the
ice-axe (it is called the wood chopper sometimes), and Oswald, ever
ready and able to command, set him and Denny to cut turfs from the
bank while we heaped stones across the stream.  It was clayey here,
or of course dam making would have been vain, even for the
best-trained beaver.</p>

<p>When we had made a ridge of stones we laid turfs against
them - nearly across the stream, leaving about two feet for the
water to go through - then more stones, and then lumps of clay
stamped down as hard as we could.  The industrious beavers spent
hours over it, with only one easy to eat cake in.  And at last the
dam rose to the level of the bank.  Then the beavers collected a
great heap of clay, and four of them lifted it and dumped it down
in the opening where the water was running.  It did splash a
little, but a true-hearted beaver knows better than to mind a bit
of a wetting, as Oswald told Alice at the time.  Then with more
clay the work was completed.  We must have used tons of clay; there
was quite a big long hole in the bank above the dam where we had
taken it out.</p>

<p>When our beaver task was performed we went on, and Dicky was so hot
he had to take his jacket off and shut up about icebergs.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you about all the windings of the stream; it went
through fields and woods and meadows, and at last the banks got
steeper and higher, and the trees overhead darkly arched their
mysterious branches, and we felt like the princes in a fairy tale
who go out to seek their fortunes.</p>

<p>And then we saw a thing that was well worth coming all that way
for; the stream suddenly disappeared under a dark stone archway,
and however much you stood in the water and stuck your head down
between your knees you could not see any light at the other end.</p>

<p>The stream was much smaller than where we had been beavers.</p>

<p>Gentle reader, you will guess in a moment who it was that said - </p>

<p>'Alice, you've got a candle.  Let's explore.'  This gallant
proposal met but a cold response.  The others said they didn't care
much about it, and what about tea?</p>

<p>I often think the way people try to hide their cowardliness behind
their teas is simply beastly.</p>

<p>Oswald took no notice.  He just said, with that dignified manner,
not at all like sulking, which he knows so well how to put on - </p>

<p>'All right.  I'M going.  If you funk it you'd better cut along home
and ask your nurses to put you to bed.'  So then, of course, they
agreed to go.  Oswald went first with the candle.  It was not
comfortable; the architect of that dark subterranean passage had
not imagined anyone would ever be brave enough to lead a band of
beavers into its inky recesses, or he would have built it high
enough to stand upright in.  As it was, we were bent almost at a
right angle, and this is very awkward if for long.</p>

<p>But the leader pressed dauntlessly on, and paid no attention to the
groans of his faithful followers, nor to what they said about their
backs.</p>

<p>It really was a very long tunnel, though, and even Oswald was not
sorry to say, 'I see daylight.'  The followers cheered as well as
they could as they splashed after him.  The floor was stone as well
as the roof, so it was easy to walk on.  I think the followers
would have turned back if it had been sharp stones or gravel.</p>

<p>And now the spot of daylight at the end of the tunnel grew larger
and larger, and presently the intrepid leader found himself
blinking in the full sun, and the candle he carried looked simply
silly.  He emerged, and the others too, and they stretched their
backs and the word 'krikey' fell from more than one lip.  It had
indeed been a cramping adventure.  Bushes grew close to the mouth
of the tunnel, so we could not see much landscape, and when we had
stretched our backs we went on upstream and nobody said they'd had
jolly well enough of it, though in more than one young heart this
was thought.</p>

<p>It was jolly to be in the sunshine again.  I never knew before how
cold it was underground.  The stream was getting smaller and
smaller.</p>

<p>Dicky said, 'This can't be the way.  I expect there was a turning
to the North Pole inside the tunnel, only we missed it.  It was
cold enough there.'</p>

<p>But here a twist in the stream brought us out from the bushes, and
Oswald said - </p>

<p>'Here is strange, wild, tropical vegetation in the richest
profusion.  Such blossoms as these never opened in a frigid
what's-its-name.'</p>

<p>It was indeed true.  We had come out into a sort of marshy, swampy
place like I think, a jungle is, that the stream ran through, and
it was simply crammed with queer plants, and flowers we never saw
before or since.  And the stream was quite thin.  It was torridly
hot, and softish to walk on.  There were rushes and reeds and small
willows, and it was all tangled over with different sorts of
grasses - and pools here and there.  We saw no wild beasts, but
there were more different kinds of wild flies and beetles than you
could believe anybody could bear, and dragon-flies and gnats.  The
girls picked a lot of flowers.  I know the names of some of them,
but I will not tell you them because this is not meant to be
instructing.  So I will only name meadow-sweet, yarrow,
loose-strife, lady's bed-straw and willow herb - both the larger and
the lesser.</p>

<p>Everyone now wished to go home.  It was much hotter there than in
natural fields.  It made you want to tear all your clothes off and
play at savages, instead of keeping respectable in your boots.</p>

<p>But we had to bear the boots because it was so brambly.</p>

<p>It was Oswald who showed the others how flat it would be to go home
the same way we came; and he pointed out the telegraph wires in the
distance and said - </p>

<p>'There must be a road there, let's make for it,' which was quite a
simple and ordinary thing to say, and he does not ask for any
credit for it.  So we sloshed along, scratching our legs with the
brambles, and the water squelched in our boots, and Alice's blue
muslin frock was torn all over in those crisscross tears which are
considered so hard to darn.</p>

<p>We did not follow the stream any more.  It was only a trickle now,
so we knew we had tracked it to its source.  And we got hotter and
hotter and hotter, and the dews of agony stood in beads on our
brows and rolled down our noses and off our chins.  And the flies
buzzed, and the gnats stung, and Oswald bravely sought to keep up
Dicky's courage, when he tripped on a snag and came down on a
bramble bush, by saying - </p>

<p>'You see it IS the source of the Nile we've discovered.  What price
North Poles now?'</p>

<p>Alice said, 'Ah, but think of ices!  I expect Oswald wishes it HAD
been the Pole, anyway.'</p>

<p>Oswald is naturally the leader, especially when following up what
is his own idea, but he knows that leaders have other duties
besides just leading.  One is to assist weak or wounded members of
the expedition, whether Polar or Equatorish.</p>

<p>So the others had got a bit ahead through Oswald lending the
tottering Denny a hand over the rough places.  Denny's feet hurt
him, because when he was a beaver his stockings had dropped out of
his pocket, and boots without stockings are not a bed of
luxuriousness.  And he is often unlucky with his feet.</p>

<p>Presently we came to a pond, and Denny said - </p>

<p>'Let's paddle.'</p>

<p>Oswald likes Denny to have ideas; he knows it is healthy for the
boy, and generally he backs him up, but just now it was getting
late and the others were ahead, so he said - </p>

<p>'Oh, rot! come on.'</p>

<p>Generally the Dentist would have; but even worms will turn if they
are hot enough, and if their feet are hurting them.
'I don't care, I shall!' he said.</p>

<p>Oswald overlooked the mutiny and did not say who was leader.  He
just said - </p>

<p>'Well don't be all day about it,' for he is a kind-hearted boy and
can make allowances.
So Denny took off his boots and went into the pool.  'Oh, it's
ripping!' he said.  'You ought to come in.'</p>

<p>'It looks beastly muddy,' said his tolerating leader.</p>

<p>'It is a bit,' Denny said, 'but the mud's just as cool as the
water, and so soft, it squeezes between your toes quite different
to boots.'</p>

<p>And so he splashed about, and kept asking Oswald to come along in.</p>

<p>But some unseen influence prevented Oswald doing this; or it may
have been because both his bootlaces were in hard knots.</p>

<p>Oswald had cause to bless the unseen influence, or the bootlaces,
or whatever it was.</p>

<p>Denny had got to the middle of the pool, and he was splashing
about, and getting his clothes very wet indeed, and altogether you
would have thought his was a most envious and happy state.  But
alas! the brightest cloud had a waterproof lining.  He was just
saying - </p>

<p>'You are a silly, Oswald.  You'd much better - ' when he gave a
blood-piercing scream, and began to kick about.</p>

<p>'What's up?' cried the ready Oswald; he feared the worst from the
way Denny screamed, but he knew it could not be an old meat tin in
this quiet and jungular spot, like it was in the moat when the
shark bit Dora.</p>

<p>'I don't know, it's biting me.  Oh, it's biting me all over my
legs!  Oh, what shall I do?  Oh, it does hurt!  Oh! oh! oh!'
remarked Denny, among his screams, and he splashed towards the
bank.  Oswald went into the water and caught hold of him and helped
him out.  It is true that Oswald had his boots on, but I trust he
would not have funked the unknown terrors of the deep, even without
his boots, I am almost sure he would not have.</p>

<p>When Denny had scrambled and been hauled ashore, we saw with horror
and amaze that his legs were stuck all over with large black,
slug-looking things.  Denny turned green in the face - and even
Oswald felt a bit queer, for he knew in a moment what the black
dreadfulnesses were.  He had read about them in a book called
Magnet Stories, where there was a girl called Theodosia, and she
could play brilliant trebles on the piano in duets, but the other
girl knew all about leeches which is much more useful and golden
deedy.  Oswald tried to pull the leeches off, but they wouldn't,
and Denny howled so he had to stop trying.  He remembered from the
Magnet Stories how to make the leeches begin biting - the girl did
it with cream - but he could not remember how to stop them, and they
had not wanted any showing how to begin.</p>

<p>'Oh, what shall I do?  What shall I do?  Oh, it does hurt!  Oh,
oh!' Denny observed, and Oswald said - </p>

<p>'Be a man!  Buck up!  If you won't let me take them off you'll just
have to walk home in them.'</p>

<p>At this thought the unfortunate youth's tears fell fast.  But
Oswald gave him an arm, and carried his boots for him, and he
consented to buck up, and the two struggled on towards the others,
who were coming back, attracted by Denny's yells.  He did not stop
howling for a moment, except to breathe.  No one ought to blame him
till they have had eleven leeches on their right leg and six on
their left, making seventeen in all, as Dicky said, at once.</p>

<p>It was lucky he did yell, as it turned out, because a man on the
road - where the telegraph wires were - was interested by his howls,
and came across the marsh to us as hard as he could.  When he saw
Denny's legs he said - </p>

<p>'Blest if I didn't think so,' and he picked Denny up and carried
him under one arm, where Denny went on saying 'Oh!' and 'It does
hurt' as hard as ever.</p>

<p>Our rescuer, who proved to be a fine big young man in the bloom of
youth, and a farm-labourer by trade, in corduroys, carried the
wretched sufferer to the cottage where he lived with his aged
mother; and then Oswald found that what he had forgotten about the
leeches was SALT.  The young man in the bloom of youth's mother put
salt on the leeches, and they squirmed off, and fell with
sickening, slug-like flops on the brick floor.</p>

<p>Then the young man in corduroys and the bloom, etc., carried Denny
home on his back, after his legs had been bandaged up, so that he
looked like 'wounded warriors returning'.</p>

<p>It was not far by the road, though such a long distance by the way
the young explorers had come.</p>

<p>He was a good young man, and though, of course, acts of goodness
are their own reward, still I was glad he had the two half-crowns
Albert's uncle gave him, as well as his own good act.  But I am not
sure Alice ought to have put him in the Golden Deed book which was
supposed to be reserved for Us.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will think this was the end of the source of the Nile
(or North Pole).  If you do, it only shows how mistaken the
gentlest reader may be.</p>

<p>The wounded explorer was lying with his wounds and bandages on the
sofa, and we were all having our tea, with raspberries and white
currants, which we richly needed after our torrid adventures, when
Mrs Pettigrew, the housekeeper, put her head in at the door and
said - </p>

<p>'Please could I speak to you half a moment, sir?' to Albert's
uncle.  And her voice was the kind that makes you look at each
other when the grown-up has gone out, and you are silent, with your
bread-and-butter halfway to the next bite, or your teacup in mid
flight to your lips.</p>

<p>It was as we suppose.  Albert's uncle did not come back for a long
while.  We did not keep the bread-and-butter on the wing all that
time, of course, and we thought we might as well finish the
raspberries and white currants.  We kept some for Albert's uncle,
of course, and they were the best ones too but when he came back he
did not notice our thoughtful unselfishness.</p>

<p>He came in, and his face wore the look that means bed, and very
likely no supper.</p>

<p>He spoke, and it was the calmness of white-hot iron, which is
something like the calmness of despair.  He said - </p>

<p>'You have done it again.  What on earth possessed you to make a
dam?'</p>

<p>'We were being beavers,' said H. O., in proud tones.  He did not
see as we did where Albert's uncle's tone pointed to.</p>

<p>'No doubt,' said Albert's uncle, rubbing his hands through his
hair.  'No doubt! no doubt!  Well, my beavers, you may go and build
dams with your bolsters.  Your dam stopped the stream; the clay you
took for it left a channel through which it has run down and ruined
about seven pounds' worth of freshly-reaped barley.  Luckily the
farmer found it out in time or you might have spoiled seventy
pounds' worth.  And you burned a bridge yesterday.'</p>

<p>We said we were sorry.  There was nothing else to say, only Alice
added, 'We didn't MEAN to be naughty.'</p>

<p>'Of course not,' said Albert's uncle, 'you never do.  Oh, yes, I'll
kiss you - but it's bed and it's two hundred lines to-morrow, and
the line is - &quot;Beware of Being Beavers and Burning Bridges.  Dread
Dams.&quot; It will be a capital exercise in capital B's and D's.'</p>

<p>We knew by that that, though annoyed, he was not furious; we went
to bed.</p>

<p>I got jolly sick of capital B's and D's before sunset on the
morrow.  That night, just as the others were falling asleep, Oswald
said - </p>

<p>'I say.'</p>

<p>'Well,' retorted his brother.</p>

<p>'There is one thing about it,' Oswald went on, 'it does show it was
a rattling good dam anyhow.'</p>

<p>And filled with this agreeable thought, the weary beavers (or
explorers, Polar or otherwise) fell asleep.</p>
