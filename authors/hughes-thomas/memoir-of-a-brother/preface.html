<p>This Memoir was written for, and at the request of, the near
relatives, and intimate friends, of the home-loving country gentleman,
whose unlooked-for death had made them all mourners indeed. Had
it been meant originally for publication, it would have taken
a very different form. In compiling it, my whole thoughts were
fixed on my own sons and nephews, and not on the public. It tells
of a life with which indeed the public has no concern in one sense;
for my brother, with all his ability and power of different kinds,
was one of the humblest and most retiring of men; who just did
his own duty, and held his own tongue, without the slightest effort
or wish for fame or notoriety of any kind. In another sense, however,
I do see that it has a meaning and interest for Englishmen in
general, and have therefore consented to its publication in the
usual way, though not without a sense of discomfort and annoyance
at having the veil even partially lifted from the intimacies of
a private family circle. For, in a noisy and confused time like
ours, it does seem to me that most of us have need to be reminded
of, and will be the better for bearing in mind, the reserve of
strength and power which lies quietly at the nation’s call, outside
the whirl and din of public and fashionable life, and entirely
ignored in the columns of the daily press. The subject of this
memoir was only a good specimen of thousands of Englishmen of
high culture, high courage, high principle, who are living their
own quiet lives in every corner of the kingdom, from John o’ Groat’s
to the Land’s-End, bringing up their families in the love of God
and their neighbour, and keeping the atmosphere around them clean,
and pure and strong, by their example,—men who would come to the
front, and might be relied on, in any serious national crisis.</p>

<p>One is too apt to fancy, from the photographs of the nation’s
life which one gets day by day, that the old ship has lost the
ballast which has stood her in such good stead for a thousand
years, and is rolling more and more helplessly, in a gale which
shows no sign of abating, for her or any other national vessel,
until at last she must roll over and founder. But it is not so.
England is in less stress, and in better trim, than she has been
in in many a stiffer gale.</p>

<p>The real fact is, that nations, and the families of which nations
are composed, make no parade or fuss over that part of their affairs
which is going right. National life depends on home life, and
foreign critics are inclined to take the chronicles of our Divorce
Court as a test by which to judge the standard of our home life,
like the old gentleman who always spelt through the police reports
to see "what the people were about." An acquaintance, however,
with any average English neighbourhood, or any dozen English families
taken at random, ought to be sufficient to reassure the faint-hearted,
and to satisfy them that (to use the good old formula) the Lord
has much work yet for this nation to do, and the nation manliness
and godliness enough left to do it all, notwithstanding superficial
appearances.</p>

<p>A life without sensation or incident may therefore well form
a more useful subject of study in such a time, than the most exciting
narrative of adventure and success, the conditions being, that
it shall have been truly lived, and faithfully told. Readers will
judge for themselves whether the former condition has been fulfilled
in this case: I wish I could feel the same confidence as to the
latter. I can only say I have done my best.</p>

<p>TO MY NEPHEWS AND SONS</p>

<p>MY DEAR BOYS,</p>

<p>It has pleased God to take to Himself the head of the family
of which you are members. Most of you are too young to enter into
the full meaning of those words "family" and "membership," but
you all remember with sore hearts, and the deepest feeling of
love and reverence, the gentle, strong, brave man, whom you used
to call father or uncle; and who had that wonderful delight in,
and attraction for, young folk, which most very gentle and brave
men have. You are conscious, I know, that a great cold chasm has
suddenly opened in your lives—that strength and help has gone
away from you, to which you knew you might turn in any of the
troubles which boys, and very young men, feel so keenly. Well,
I am glad that you feel that it is so: I should not have much
hope of you if it were otherwise. The chasm will close up, and
you will learn, I trust and pray, where to go for strength and
help, in this and all other troubles.</p>

<p>It is very little that I can do for you. Probably you can do
more for me; and my need is even sorer than yours. But what I
can do I will. Several of you have asked me questions about your
father and uncle, what we used to do, and think and talk about,
when he and I were boys together. Well, no one can answer these
questions better than I, for we were as nearly of an age as brothers
can be—I was only thirteen months younger—and we were companions
from our childhood. We went together to our first school, when
I was nearly eight and he nine years old; and then on to Rugby
together; and were never separated for more than a week until
he went to Oxford, where I followed a year later. For the first
part of my time there, in college, we lived in the same rooms,
always on the same staircase; and afterwards in the same lodgings.
From that time to the day of his death we lived in the most constant
intimacy and affection. Looking back over all those years, I can
call to mind no single unkind, or unworthy, or untruthful, act
or word of his; and amongst all the good influences for which
I have to be thankful, I reckon the constant presence and example
of his brave, generous, and manly life as one of the most powerful
and ennobling. If I can in any measure reproduce it for you, I
know that I shall be doing you a good service; and helping you,
in even more difficult times than those in which we grew up, to
quit yourselves as brave and true English boys and Englishmen,
in whatever work or station God may be pleased to call you to.</p>

<p>You have all been taught to look to one life as your model, and
to turn to Him who lived it on our earth, as to the guide, and
friend, and helper, who alone can strengthen the feeble knees,
and lift up the fainting heart. Just in so far as you cleave to
that teaching, and follow that life, will you live your own faithfully.
If I were not sure that what I am going to try to do for you would
help to turn you more trustfully and lovingly to that source of
all truth, all strength, all light, be sure I would not have undertaken
it. As it is, I know it will be my fault if it does not do this.</p>
