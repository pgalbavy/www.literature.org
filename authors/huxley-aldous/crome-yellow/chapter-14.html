<p>For their after-luncheon coffee the party generally adjourned
to the library. Its windows looked east, and at this hour of the
day it was the coolest place in the whole house. It was a large
room, fitted, during the eighteenth century, with white painted
shelves of an elegant design. In the middle of one wall a door,
ingeniously upholstered with rows of dummy books, gave access
to a deep cupboard, where, among a pile of letter-files and old
newspapers, the mummy-case of an Egyptian lady, brought back by
the second Sir Ferdinando on his return from the Grand Tour, mouldered
in the darkness. From ten yards away and at a first glance, one
might almost have mistaken this secret door for a section of shelving
filled with genuine books. Coffee-cup in hand, Mr. Scogan was
standing in front of the dummy book-shelf. Between the sips he
discoursed.</p>

<p>"The bottom shelf," he was saying, "is taken up by an Encyclopaedia
in fourteen volumes. Useful, but a little dull, as is also Caprimulge’s
‘Dictionary of the Finnish Language’. The ‘Biographical Dictionary’
looks more promising. ‘Biography of Men who were Born Great’,
‘Biography of Men who Achieved Greatness’, ‘Biography of Men who
had Greatness Thrust upon Them’, and ‘Biography of Men who were
Never Great at All’. Then there are ten volumes of ‘Thom’s Works
and Wanderings’, while the ‘Wild Goose Chase, a Novel’, by an
anonymous author, fills no less than six. But what’s this, what’s
this?" Mr. Scogan stood on tiptoe and peered up. "Seven volumes
of the ‘Tales of Knockespotch’. The ‘Tales of Knockespotch’,"
he repeated. "Ah, my dear Henry," he said, turning round, "these
are your best books. I would willingly give all the rest of your
library for them."</p>

<p>The happy possessor of a multitude of first editions, Mr. Wimbush
could afford to smile indulgently.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," Mr. Scogan went on, "that they possess nothing
more than a back and a title?" He opened the cupboard door and
peeped inside, as though he hoped to find the rest of the books
behind it. "Phooh!"  he said, and shut the door again. "It smells
of dust and mildew. How symbolical! One comes to the great masterpieces
of the past, expecting some miraculous illumination, and one finds,
on opening them, only darkness and dust and a faint smell of decay.
After all, what is reading but a vice, like drink or venery or
any other form of excessive self-indulgence? One reads to tickle
and amuse one’s mind; one reads, above all, to prevent oneself
thinking. Still&mdash;the ‘Tales of Knockespotch’..."</p>

<p>He paused, and thoughtfully drummed with his fingers on the backs
of the non-existent, unattainable books.</p>

<p>"But I disagree with you about reading," said Mary. "About serious
reading, I mean."</p>

<p>"Quite right, Mary, quite right," Mr. Scogan answered. "I had
forgotten there were any serious people in the room."</p>

<p>"I like the idea of the Biographies," said Denis. "There’s room
for us all within the scheme; it’s comprehensive."</p>

<p>"Yes, the Biographies are good, the Biographies are excellent,"
Mr Scogan agreed. "I imagine them written in a very elegant Regency
style &mdash;Brighton Pavilion in words&mdash;perhaps by the great
Dr. Lempriere himself. You know his classical dictionary? Ah!"
Mr. Scogan raised his hand and let it limply fall again in a gesture
which implied that words failed him. "Read his biography of Helen;
read how Jupiter, disguised as a swan, was ‘enabled to avail himself
of his situation’ vis-a-vis to Leda. And to think that he may
have, must have written these biographies of the Great! What a
work, Henry! And, owing to the idiotic arrangement of your library,
it can’t be read."</p>

<p>"I prefer the ‘Wild Goose Chase’," said Anne. "A novel in six
volumes&mdash;it must be restful."</p>

<p>"Restful," Mr. Scogan repeated. "You’ve hit on the right word.
A ‘Wild Goose Chase’ is sound, but a bit old-fashioned&mdash;pictures
of clerical life in the fifties, you know; specimens of the landed
gentry; peasants for pathos and comedy; and in the background,
always the picturesque beauties of nature soberly described. All
very good and solid, but, like certain puddings, just a little
dull. Personally, I like much better the notion of ‘Thom’s Works
and Wanderings’. The eccentric Mr. Thom of Thom’s Hill. Old Tom
Thom, as his intimates used to call him. He spent ten years in
Thibet organising the clarified butter industry on modern European
lines, and was able to retire at thirty-six with a handsome fortune.
The rest of his life he devoted to travel and ratiocination; here
is the result." Mr. Scogan tapped the dummy books. "And now we
come to the ‘Tales of Knockespotch’. What a masterpiece and what
a great man! Knockespotch knew how to write fiction. Ah, Denis,
if you could only read Knockespotch you wouldn’t be writing a
novel about the wearisome development of a young man’s character,
you wouldn’t be describing in endless, fastidious detail, cultured
life in Chelsea and Bloomsbury and Hampstead. You would be trying
to write a readable book. But then, alas! owing to the peculiar
arrangement of our host’s library, you never will read Knockespotch."</p>

<p>"Nobody could regret the fact more than I do," said Denis.</p>

<p>"It was Knockespotch," Mr. Scogan continued, "the great Knockespotch,
who delivered us from the dreary tyranny of the realistic novel.
My life, Knockespotch said, is not so long that I can afford to
spend precious hours writing or reading descriptions of middle-class
interiors. He said again, ‘I am tired of seeing the human mind
bogged in a social plenum; I prefer to paint it in a vacuum, freely
and sportively bombinating.’"</p>

<p>"I say," said Gombauld, "Knockespotch was a little obscure sometimes,
wasn’t he?"</p>

<p>"He was," Mr. Scogan replied, "and with intention. It made him
seem even profounder than he actually was. But it was only in
his aphorisms that he was so dark and oracular. In his Tales he
was always luminous. Oh, those Tales&mdash;those Tales! How shall I
describe them? Fabulous characters shoot across his pages like
gaily dressed performers on the trapeze. There are extraordinary
adventures and still more extraordinary speculations. Intelligences
and emotions, relieved of all the imbecile preoccupations of civilised
life, move in intricate and subtle dances, crossing and recrossing,
advancing, retreating, impinging. An immense erudition and an
immense fancy go hand in hand. All the ideas of the present and
of the past, on every possible subject, bob up among the Tales,
smile gravely or grimace a caricature of themselves, then disappear
to make place for something new. The verbal surface of his writing
is rich and fantastically diversified. The wit is incessant. The..."</p>

<p>"But couldn’t you give us a specimen," Denis broke in&mdash;"a concrete
example?"</p>

<p>"Alas!" Mr. Scogan replied, "Knockespotch’s great book is like
the sword Excalibur. It remains struck fast in this door, awaiting
the coming of a writer with genius enough to draw it forth. I
am not even a writer, I am not so much as qualified to attempt
the task. The extraction of Knockespotch from his wooden prison
I leave, my dear Denis, to you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Denis.</p>
