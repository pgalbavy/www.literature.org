          <p>
               They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<br />
               They pursued it with forks and hope;<br />
               They threatened its life with a railway-share;<br />
               They charmed it with smiles and soap.
          <P>
               Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan<br />
               For making a separate sally;<br />
               And fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,<br />
               A dismal and desolate valley.
          <P>
               But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:<br />
               It had chosen the very same place:<br />
               Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,<br />
               The disgust that appeared in his face.
          <P>
               Each thought he was thinking of nothing but "Snark"<br />
               And the glorious work of the day;<br />
               And each tried to pretend that he did not remark<br />
               That the other was going that way.
          <P>
               But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,<br />
               And the evening got darker and colder,<br />
               Till (merely from nervousness, not from goodwill)<br />
               They marched along shoulder to shoulder.
          <P>
               Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,<br />
               And they knew that some danger was near:<br />
               The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,<br />
               And even the Butcher felt queer.
          <P>
               He thought of his childhood, left far far behind--<br />
               That blissful and innocent state--<br />
               The sound so exactly recalled to his mind<br />
               A pencil that squeaks on a slate!
          <P>
               "'Tis the voice of the Jubjub!" he suddenly cried.<br />
               (This man, that they used to call "Dunce.")<br />
               "As the Bellman would tell you," he added with pride,<br />
               "I have uttered that sentiment once.
          <P>
               "'Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;<br />
               You will find I have told it you twice.<br />
               'Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,<br />
               If only I've stated it thrice."
          <P>
               The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,<br />
               Attending to every word:<br />
               But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,<br />
               When the third repetition occurred.
          <P>
               It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,<br />
               It had somehow contrived to lose count,<br />
               And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains<br />
               By reckoning up the amount.
          <P>
               "Two added to one--if that could but be done,"<br />
               It said, "with one's fingers and thumbs!"<br />
               Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,<br />
               It had taken no pains with its sums.
          <P>
               "The thing can be done," said the Butcher, "I think.<br />
               The thing must be done, I am sure.<br />
               The thing shall be done! Bring me paper and ink,<br />
               The best there is time to procure."
          <P>
               The Beaver brought paper,portfolio, pens,<br />
               And ink in unfailing supplies:<br />
               While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,<br />
               And watched them with wondering eyes.
          <P>
               So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,<br />
               As he wrote with a pen in each hand,<br />
               And explained all the while in a popular style<br />
               Which the Beaver could well understand.
          <P>
               "Taking Three as the subject to reason about--<br />
               A convenient number to state--<br />
               We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out<br />
               By One Thousand diminished by Eight.
          <P>
               "The result we proceed to divide, as you see,<br />
               By Nine Hundred and Ninety Two:<br />
               Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be<br />
               Exactly and perfectly true.
          <P>
               "The method employed I would gladly explain,<br />
               While I have it so clear in my head,<br />
               If I had but the time and you had but the brain--<br />
               But much yet remains to be said.
          <P>
               "In one moment I've seen what has hitherto been<br />
               Enveloped in absolute mystery,<br />
               And without extra charge I will give you at large<br />
               A Lesson in Natural History."
          <P>
               In his genial way he proceeded to say<br />
               (Forgetting all laws of propriety,<br />
               And that giving instruction, without introduction,<br />
               Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),
          <P>
               "As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate bird,<br />
               Since it lives in perpetual passion:<br />
               Its taste in costume is entirely absurd--<br />
               It is ages ahead of the fashion:
          <P>
               "But it knows any friend it has met once before:<br />
               It never will look at a bride:<br />
               And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,<br />
               And collects--though it does not subscribe.
          <P>
               " Its flavor when cooked is more exquisite far<br />
               Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:<br />
               (Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,<br />
               And some, in mahogany kegs:)
          <P>
               "You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:<br />
               You condense it with locusts and tape:<br />
               Still keeping one principal object in view--<br />
               To preserve its symmetrical shape."
          <P>
               The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,<br />
               But he felt that the lesson must end,<br />
               And he wept with delight in attempting to say<br />
               He considered the Beaver his friend.
          <P>
               While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks<br />
               More eloquent even than tears,<br />
               It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books<br />
               Would have taught it in seventy years.
          <P>
               They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned<br />
               (For a moment) with noble emotion,<br />
               Said "This amply repays all the wearisome days<br />
               We have spent on the billowy ocean!"
          <P>
               Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,<br />
               Have seldom if ever been known;<br />
               In winter or summer, 'twas always the same--<br />
               You could never meet either alone.
          <P>
               And when quarrels arose--as one frequently finds<br />
               Quarrels will, spite of every endeavor--<br />
               The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,<br />
               And cemented their friendship for ever!
