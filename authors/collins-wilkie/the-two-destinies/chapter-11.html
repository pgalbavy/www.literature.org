<P>
I LOOKED at the house. It was an inn, of no great size, but of
respectable appearance. If I was to be of any use to her that
night, the time had come to speak of other subjects than the
subject of dreams.
<P>
"After all that you have told me," I said, "I will not ask you to
admit me any further into your confidence until we meet again.
Only let me hear how I can relieve your most pressing anxieties.
What are your plans? Can I do anything to help them before you go
to rest to-night?"
<P>
She thanked me warmly, and hesitated, looking up the street and
down the street in evident embarrassment what to say next.
<P>
"Do you propose staying in Edinburgh?" I asked.
<P>
"Oh no! I don't wish to remain in Scotland. I want to go much
further away. I think I should do better in London; at some
respectable milliner's, if I could be properly recommended. I am
quick at my needle, and I understand cutting out. Or I could keep
accounts, if--if anybody would trust me."
<P>
She stopped, and looked at me doubtingly, as if she felt far from
sure, poor soul, of winning my confidence to begin with. I acted
on that hint, with the headlong impetuosity of a man who was in
love.
<P>
"I can give you exactly the recommendation you want," I said,
"whenever you like. Now, if you would prefer it."
<P>
Her charming features brightened with pleasure. "Oh, you are
indeed a friend to me!" she said, impulsively. Her face clouded
again--she saw my proposal in a new light. "Have I any right,"
she asked, sadly, "to accept what you offer me?"
<P>
"Let me give you the letter," I answered, "and you can decide for
yourself whether you will use it or not."
<P>
I put her arm again in mine, and entered the inn.
<P>
She shrunk back in alarm. What would the landlady think if she
saw her lodger enter the house at night in company with a
stranger, and that stranger a gentleman? The landlady appeared as
she made the objection. Reckless what I said or what I did, I
introduced myself as her relative, and asked to be shown into a
quiet room in which I could write a letter. After one sharp
glance at me, the landlady appeared to be satisfied that she was
dealing with a gentleman. She led the way into a sort of parlor
behind the "bar," placed writing materials on the table, looked
at my companion as only one woman can look at another under
certain circumstances, and left us by ourselves.
<P>
It was the first time I had ever been in a room with her alone.
The embarrassing sense of her position had heightened her color
and brightened her eyes. She stood, leaning one hand on the
table, confused and irresolute, her firm and supple figure
falling into an attitude of unsought grace which it was literally
a luxury to look at. I said nothing; my eyes confessed my
admiration; the writing materials lay untouched before me on the
table. How long the silence might have lasted I cannot say. She
abruptly broke it. Her instinct warned her that silence might
have its dangers, in our position. She turned to me with an
effort; she said, uneasily, "I don't think you ought to write
your letter to-night, sir."
<P>
"Why not?"
<P>
"You know nothing of me. Surely you ought not to recommend a
person who is a stranger to you? And I am worse than a stranger.
I am a miserable wretch who has tried to commit a great sin--I
have tried to destroy myself. Perhaps the misery I was in might
be some excuse for me, if you knew it. You ought to know it. But
it's so late to-night, and I am so sadly tired--and there are
some things, sir, which it is not easy for a woman to speak of in
the presence of a man."
<P>
Her head sunk on her bosom; her delicate lips trembled a little;
she said no more. The way to reassure and console her lay plainly
enough before me, if I chose to take it. Without stopping to
think, I took it.
<P>
Reminding her that she had herself proposed writing to me when we
met that evening, I suggested that she should wait to tell the
sad story of her troubles until it was convenient to her to send
me the narrative in the form of a letter. "In the mean time," I
added, "I have the most perfect confidence in you; and I beg as a
favor that you will let me put it to the proof. I can introduce
you to a dressmaker in London who is at the head of a large
establishment, and I will do it before I leave you to-night."
<P>
I dipped my pen in the ink as I said the words. Let me confess
frankly the lengths to which my infatuation led me. The
dressmaker to whom I had alluded had been my mother's maid in f
ormer years, and had been established in business with money lent
by my late step-father, Mr. Germaine. I used both their names
without scruple; and I wrote my recommendation in terms which the
best of living women and the ablest of existing dressmakers could
never have hoped to merit. Will anybody find excuses for me?
Those rare persons who have been in love, and who have not
completely forgotten it yet, may perhaps find excuses for me. It
matters little; I don't deserve them.
<P>
I handed her the open letter to read.
<P>
She blushed delightfully; she cast one tenderly grateful look at
me, which I remembered but too well for many and many an
after-day. The next moment, to my astonishment, this changeable
creature changed again. Some forgotten consideration seemed to
have occurred to her. She turned pale; the soft lines of pleasure
in her face hardened, little by little; she regarded me with the
saddest look of confusion and distress. Putting the letter down
before me on the table, she said, timidly:
<P>
"Would you mind adding a postscript, sir?"
<P>
I suppressed all appearance of surprise as well as I could, and
took up the pen again.
<P>
"Would you please say," she went on, "that I am only to be taken
on trial, at first? I am not to be engaged for more"--her voice
sunk lower and lower, so that I could barely hear the next
words--"for more than three months, certain."
<P>
It was not in human nature--perhaps I ought to say it was not in
the nature of a man who was in my situation--to refrain from
showing some curiosity, on being asked to supplement a letter of
recommendation by such a postscript as this.
<P>
"Have you some other employment in prospect?" I asked.
<P>
"None," she answered, with her head down, and her eyes avoiding
mine.
<P>
An unworthy doubt of her--the mean offspring of jealousy--found
its way into my mind.
<P>
"Have you some absent friend," I went on, "who is likely to prove
a better friend than I am, if you only give him time?"
<P>
She lifted her noble head. Her grand, guileless gray eyes rested
on me with a look of patient reproach.
<P>
"I have not got a friend in the world," she said. "For God's
sake, ask me no more questions to-night!"
<P>
I rose and gave her the letter once more--with the postscript
added, in her own words.
<P>
We stood together by the table; we looked at each other in a
momentary silence.
<P>
"How can I thank you?" she murmured, softly. "Oh, sir, I will
indeed be worthy of the confidence that you have shown in me!"
Her eyes moistened; her variable color came and went; her dress
heaved softly over the lovely outline of her bosom. I don't
believe the man lives who could have resisted her at that moment.
I lost all power of restraint; I caught her in my arms; I
whispered, "I love you!" I kissed her passionately. For a moment
she lay helpless and trembling on my breast; for a moment her
fragrant lips softly returned the kiss. In an instant more it was
over. She tore herself away with a shudder that shook her from
head to foot, and threw the letter that I had given to her
indignantly at my feet.
<P>
"How dare you take advantage of me! How dare you touch me!" she
said. "Take your letter back, sir; I refuse to receive it; I will
never speak to you again. You don't know what you have done. You
don't know how deeply you have wounded me. Oh!" she cried,
throwing herself in despair on a sofa that stood near her, "shall
I ever recover my self-respect? shall I ever forgive myself for
what I have done to-night?"
<P>
I implored her pardon; I assured her of my repentance and regret
in words which did really come from my heart. The violence of her
agitation more than distressed me--I was really alarmed by it.
<P>
She composed herself after a while. She rose to her feet with
modest dignity, and silently held out her hand in token that my
repentance was accepted.
<P>
"You will give me time for atonement?" I pleaded. "You will not
lose all confidence in me? Let me see you again, if it is only to
show that I am not quite unworthy of your pardon--at your own
time; in the presence of another person, if you like."
<P>
"I will write to you," she said.
<P>
"To-morrow?"
<P>
"To-morrow."
<P>
I took up the letter of recommendation from the floor.
<P>
"Make your goodness to me complete," I said. "Don't mortify me by
refusing to take my letter."
<P>
"I will take your letter," she answered, quietly. "Thank you for
writing it. Leave me now, please. Good-night."
<P>
I left her, pale and sad, with my letter in her hand. I left her,
with my mind in a tumult of contending emotions, which gradually
resolved themselves into two master-feelings as I walked on:
Love, that adored her more fervently than ever; and Hope, that
set the prospect before me of seeing her again on the next day.
