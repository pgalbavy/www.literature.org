<p>This was astounding news, indeed, and for a few minutes the two
veteran hunters were completely taken back. They had considered
the place where their animals were picketed as being so secure
that the contingency of losing them was not thought of until it
came upon them with the suddenness mentioned.</p>

<p>"They didn't find them themselves," growled Tom, as if determined
on finding consolation in that fact; "they've stumbled onto 'em
accidental-like, and then rid off, as though they were smart enough
to be reg'lar hoss-thieves."</p>

<p>"Have you seen the trail?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Whereaway does it lead?"</p>

<p>The hunter replied by pointing toward the northwest, among the
hills and mountains in the wildest portion of the country.</p>

<p>A hurried consultation now took place between them, and it was
resolved to recover the two mustangs. They counted it easy to
secure a couple of the Indian ponies; but among them all were
none which, in their own estimation, could compare with their
own, and they were determined not to leave the country until they
were regained. The most skillful Apache may succeed in hiding
his own trail at times, but he cannot cover that of his horse
so that the trained scout will fail to find it.</p>

<p>It was found that the mustangs had been ridden away without being
accompanied by other animals. The number of moccasin tracks at
a certain point showed that a party of warriors had accidentally
detected the animals, each of which was mounted by a single Indian
and ridden away, the warriors taking altogether a different direction.
This simplified matters, and was not displeasing to Dick and Tom,
for two of these active redskins could, as a matter of course,
be circumvented with much more ease than could ten times that
number.</p>

<p>Accompanied by Ned, the hunters led the way up out of the hollow,
crossed as it was by the stream of icy cold and clear water and
covered with the richest grass, and entered a more rocky section,
where the horses must have experienced considerable difficulty
in traveling, as numerous places showed where their hoofs had
slipped upon the stones.</p>

<p>"We can beat them on that," said Dick, when they had trailed
them for a short distance. "They can't be many hours ahead of
us, and when we do catch up with 'em, Tom, we'll warm 'em; what
do you say?"</p>

<p>Tom nodded his head to signify that he agreed with these sentiments
exactly, and the trio pressed forward harder than ever.</p>

<p>There were many places in which the thieves had progressed with
no little trouble, and their pursuers, unimpeded by the mustangs,
were gaining rapidly upon them; but this by no means insured success.
A hundred difficulties remained in the way, and the most that
the two hunters could hope was that the two Apaches had no suspicion
of being followed. If they believed themselves secure, it followed
as a matter of course that they would take no precautions against
any surprise from the rear. The hunters went forward at a rate
which was exceedingly trying to Ned, but he bravely held up until
something like a mile was passed, when Tom, who acted as a leader,
suddenly paused.</p>

<p>"We must wait here till we make an observation," said he, in
a low tone. "I take it that we aren't very far from the scamps,
and we must look out and not spile the whole thing when we've
got it all in shape."</p>

<p>For the entire distance they had been steadily advancing upon
higher ground, and having now reached the culminating point, it
was necessary to look ahead and learn whither they were going
before making any rash venture into an entirely different section.
While Dick and Ned, therefore, remained where they were, Tom stole
cautiously forward for some distance further, until he reached
a high, flat rock, the edge of which he approached on his hands
and knees, and stealthily peered over.</p>

<p>Only a few seconds did he spend thus when he began retrograding,
like a crab.</p>

<p>"I think I've hit the spot," he said in an undertone, as he rejoined
his friends. "There's a sort of path which leads down into the
lower country, and as that's the only way the hosses can travel,
it follers that they must have gone that way. That 'ere place
that I was speakin' of goes down into a spot a good deal like
the one where we expected to find the animiles and didn't, and
there's where I think we'll find 'em awaitin' for us."</p>

<p>"Do you see any sign?" inquired Dick.</p>

<p>"Not yet; they wouldn't be likely to kindle a camp fire at this
time of day, and afore they jined the others. Come ahead, we must
be mighty keerful now, when we're gettin' so close."</p>

<p>As before, Tom took the lead, and they advanced with the greatest
caution. If the Apaches had any fear of being followed, they were
very likely to detect the men stealing down upon them; but much
reliance was placed upon the likelihood of their holding no such
suspicion.</p>

<p>The afternoon was half gone when the locality pointed out by
Hardynge was reached, and the three halted again. As soon as they
had concealed themselves Tom continued his reconnaissance, making
it with such care that he consumed fully a half hour before concluding
it. When he reappeared, with the silence of a shadow, he whispered:</p>

<p>"They're there&mdash;both of 'em."</p>

<p>He explained that he had approached close enough to recognize
his own animal as well as Dick's. He saw nothing more, not even
an Indian, but it followed, of course, that they were near at
hand. From this point forward, therefore, the presence of the
lad could be nothing but an incumbrance, and it was agreed that
he should stay where he was until the animals were recaptured,
when he could ride away with one of them.</p>

<p>"Remember, the varmints are close onto you," said Tom, by way
of caution; "and you must keep mighty shady. Don't go to crawling
about, and trying to peep into what's none of your business."</p>

<p>The boy promised obedience, and the two left him. As near as
he could judge he was within a hundred yards of the camp of the
horse thieves, and there was no certainty that, if they discovered
the approach of the hunters, they might take a course which would
bring them back over the same path. So, to avoid any unpleasant
discovery, he crept in beneath some dense shrubbery, where he
felt secure against observation, and anxiously awaited the result.</p>

<p>Ned had not been in this place of concealment five minutes, when
he was startled by a slight noise behind him, such as would be
made by the cautious approach of some person or creature. He turned
his head, but his view was too much obstructed by the vegetation
around him. The slight disturbance continued until Ned's curiosity
got the better of his judgment, and he stealthily parted the leaves
with one hand sufficiently to permit him to see out.</p>

<p>As he dreaded, he detected an Indian warrior, whose actions indicated
that he knew what was going on. He was stepping along as if fearful
that the slight rustling would catch the ears of parties who were
far beyond the range of hearing. Fortunately for Ned, at the moment
he looked forth in this stealthy manner the Apache afforded only
what may be termed a three-quarter view, having passed slightly
beyond where he was hidden; and, as he continued to move in the
same direction, nothing but his back was visible a few minutes
afterward. But the lad saw enough to render him uneasy. At first
glimpse he took the Indian to be Lone Wolf, but he caught sight
of enough of his visage to make certain that it was another warrior
altogether; but he was large, powerful, and very formidable looking,
and Ned dreaded an encounter between him and one of the hunters.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, he carried no gun with him, and, as the boy
still retained possession of Lone Wolf's, it seemed to young Chadmund
that he could want no better opportunity of wiping out one of
those pestilent redskins. With this purpose in view he cautiously
shoved the end of the weapon through the bushes and aimed at the
back of the warrior, who, at that moment, could not have been
more than a dozen yards from him. There could be no mistaking
a target so conspicuous and so close at hand; but when the aim
was sure and Ned's finger was pressing the trigger, he restrained
himself by the self-imposed question whether it was right to pick
off a foe, savage though he was, in that fashion. He was well
aware that no mercy would have been shown him had the position
been reversed; still, he could not justify in his own mind an
act that looked so much like murder.</p>

<p>"No," said he, when this inward conflict had continued a minute
or so. "I s'pose Tom and Dick would laugh at me if they knew how
I acted: but I don't believe father would like to have me fight
that way. Anyhow, my conscience don't, so I won't."</p>
