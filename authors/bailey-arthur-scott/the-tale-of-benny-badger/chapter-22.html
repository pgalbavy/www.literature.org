<p>For a moment or two Benny Badger looked at the deer mouse without saying
a word. He told himself that here was a country person who couldn't ever
have travelled much, or he would have known better than to make such a
remark. . . . Spoil the whole neighborhood indeed! . . . Benny's lip
twisted up in something like a sneer.
</p>
<p>"Don't you worry!" he snorted. "I don't believe you ever saw a
first-class digger before. I'm not going to spoil the neighborhood. I'm
<u>improving</u> it. I'm making a fine house here--probably the finest there
is for miles around."
</p><p>The deer mouse appeared ashamed. Of course he didn't like to seem
stupid.
</p><p>"But why do you dig in so many places?" he faltered.
</p><p>"That's my way," Benny Badger told him. "As soon as I get one den well
started I think I'd rather live somewhere else. But I don't mind
beginning again because there's no better exercise than digging."
</p><p>"No doubt!" the deer mouse agreed. "But I'm sure it would be much too
violent for me."
</p><p>He said no more, but looked on with a puzzled air until at last Benny
Badger had actually dug in one place long enough to make a deep den.
</p><p>When it was quite finished Benny Badger brushed the dirt off himself and
turned to Mr. Deer Mouse.
</p><p>"Come inside and see if my new house isn't the finest one you ever
saw!" he said.
</p><p>For some reason Mr. Deer Mouse did not seem eager to enter. To be sure,
he thanked Benny for the invitation, but he backed away a few steps and
said that he thought he'd better not look at the new house that morning.
"I--I haven't the time to spare," he mumbled.
</p><p>Benny Badger couldn't understand that remark. The white-footed gentleman
had had plenty of time to spend while watching him dig the den. And
Benny said as much, too.
</p><p>"That's exactly the point," said the deer mouse. "I've spent so much
time already that I've used it all up."
</p><p>Well, Benny Badger couldn't understand that either.
</p><p>"Used up all the time!" he cried scornfully. "Isn't there plenty more
where the other time came from?"
</p><p>"Oh, to be sure--to be sure!" said the deer mouse, who seemed ready to
agree to anything--except to Benny's invitation. "But there is another
reason why I mustn't visit your new home this morning: I'm hungry. I
haven't had my breakfast yet."
</p><p>Suddenly Benny Badger remembered that he was hungry himself.
</p><p>And as he stared at plump Mr. Deer Mouse a certain idea came into his
head. And he looked Mr. Deer up and down before he spoke.
</p><p>"I haven't had my breakfast either," he said at last. "I'm ready for a
good meal. Come right in and join me!"
</p><p>But something made Mr. Deer Mouse say, "No, thank you!" _Joining a
badger at breakfast!_ Somehow that had a dangerous sound.
