<p>They were safe at last! The four dropped their feet and found
them resting upon smooth packed sand, and wading a few rods they
all stood upon dry earth. Terror, as he shook his shaggy coat
and rubbed his nose against his young masters seemed not the least
joyful of the party.</p>

<p>"Isn't this grand!" exclaimed Elwood. "When did the ground feel
better to your feet? Saved from fire and water!"</p>

<p>"Our first duty is to thank God!" said Mr. Yard reverently. "He
has chosen us out of the hundreds that have perished as special
objects of his mercy. Let us kneel upon the shore and testify
our gratitude to Him."</p>

<p>All sunk devoutly upon their knees and joined the merchant, as
in a low, impressive tone he returned thanks to his Creator for
the signal mercy he had displayed in bringing them safely through
such imminent perils.</p>

<p>"Now, what is to be done next?" inquired Mr. Yard, as they arose
to their feet and looked around them. "The first thing I should
like to do is to procure a suit of clothes, and I hope I shall
be able to do it without stripping any of the dead bodies that
will soon wash ashore."</p>

<p>"What is the naad?" asked Tim O'Rooney. "Baing that it's a warrum
summer night, and there saams to be few in the neighborhood that
is likely to take exsaptions to your costume."</p>

<p>"But day is breaking!" replied the merchant, pointing across
the low, rocky country to a range of mountains in the distance,
whose high, jagged tops were blackly defined against the sky that
was growing light and rosy behind them.</p>

<p>"Yes, it will soon be light," said Howard. "See! there are persons
along the shore that have come down to the wreck?"</p>

<p>"They are some of the passengers that have managed to reach land.
I will go among them and see whether any of them have any clothing
to sell," laughed Mr. Yard as he moved away.</p>

<p>As the sun came up over the mountains it lit up a dreary and
desolate scene. Away in the distance, until sky and earth mingled
into one, stretched the blue Pacific, not ridged into foam and
spray like the boisterous Atlantic, but swelling and heaving as
if the great deep was a breathing monster. A few fragments of
blackened splinters floating here and there were all that remained
to show where a few hours before the magnificent steamer, surcharged
with its living freight, so proudly cut the waters on her swift
course toward the Golden Gate.</p>

<p>Several ghastly, blue-lipped survivors in their clinging garments
were wandering aimlessly along the shore, the veriest pictures
of utter misery, as they mumbled a few words to each other, or
stared absently around. They seemed to be partially bereft of
their senses, and were probably somewhat dazed from the fearful
scenes through which they had so recently passed.</p>

<p>Several sails were visible, but they were so far away that it
was vain to hope to attract their attention. Three large boats
could be seen away to the northwest, skirting along shore and
making their way toward San Francisco as rapidly as muscle and
oars could carry them. What recked they whether the passengers
were buried with the steamer, sunk in the ocean, or left to perish
on the desolate coast?</p>

<p>The Coast Range, which descends into California from Oregon,
in some places comes within twenty-five or thirty miles of the
sea, while at other times it recedes to over a hundred. The particular
point where our friends were suffered to land was rough, barren
and rocky, and behind them, with many peaks reaching the line
of perpetual snow, rose the noble Coast Range, between which and
them stretched a smaller range of mountains.</p>

<p>Around them the country appeared desolate and uninhabited. Howard
and Elwood were well acquainted with geography, and had a general
idea of California, although they could not be expected to know
much of the minor facts of the State. They were aware that at
no great distance&mdash;but whether north or south it was impossible
to say&mdash;lay the missionary town of San Luis Obispo, and between
them and the Coast Range ran the Salinas River, formerly known
as the San Buenaventura, and a smaller chain of mountains or highlands.</p>

<p>They knew, too, that after crossing the Coast Range, you descended
into the broad and beautiful Sacramento Valley, where abounded
wild animals, Indians, gold, silver, and the most exuberant vegetation.
This was about all they knew; and this, after all, was considerable.
When persons expect to make a journey to some distant country
they are very apt to learn all that they possibly can about it;
and this was the way they came to understand so much regarding
the young State of California.</p>

<p>They had stood some little time conversing together when they
saw Mr. Yard approaching, clad in quite a respectable suit of
black, albeit, as a matter of course, it was thoroughly soaked
with salt water.</p>

<p>"You are fortunate," remarked Howard.</p>

<p>"Yes," he laughed; "what strange beings we are! Do you see that
elderly gentleman yonder, with his hands in his pockets walking
back and forth as though he expected some arrival from the sea?"</p>

<p>The personage alluded to could be easily distinguished from the
others.</p>

<p>"Well, his berth was next to mine. When the alarm of fire was
first heard he sprung from his bed, dressed himself and caught
up his valise, which contained an extra suit of clothing, and
rushed on deck with the other passengers."</p>

<p>"How was he saved?"</p>

<p>"It is hard to tell. He and several others hung fast to some
such sort of a raft as we had, and managed to get ashore. And
all the time he grasped that valise, even when besought by his
companions to let it go, find when it endangered his chances of
life fully ten-fold."</p>

<p>"He must be very poor."</p>

<p>"Poor! He is worth half a million in gold this minute. That valise
contained all his property that he had entrusted to the steamer,
and it was his fear that he might lose the few dollars that it
is worth that made him cling so tenaciously to it."</p>

<p>"How was it that he gave them to you?"</p>

<p>"No fear that he gave them. I stated in the presence of two witnesses
that, I would give him a hundred dollars for the suit as soon
as we reached San Francisco. He racked his brains to see whether
there was not some means of my giving him my note for the amount;
but as that couldn't be done under the circumstances, he did the
next best thing and established my obligation in the mouth of
several witnesses."</p>

<p>"Strange man! But, Mr. Yard, what is to be done?"</p>

<p>"I intend to wait here during the day, as I know of nothing better
that we can do. I think some friends will find us before nightfall."</p>

<p>"We have decided to go inland a short distance, dry our clothes
and give our bodies a good rubbing, to prevent our taking cold."</p>

<p>"A wise precaution, but useless in my case as I have already
caught a very severe one."</p>

<p>"Should we become separated, you will tell our parents that we
reached the land in safety and are in good spirits."</p>

<p>"Of course; but don't wander too far away, as you may lose your
chance of being taken off. You know this isn't the most hospitable
country in the world. There are treacherous and thieving Indians
in these parts, and they would have swooped down on us long ago
if they had only known we were here. As it is, I fear their approach
before a friendly sail comes to us."</p>

<p>"Never fear; we will take good care not to wander too far away."</p>

<p>And the parties separated for a much longer time than any of
them imagined.</p>
