<p>The shadw of the termination now descended in sable thunder-clouds
upon our devoted nobs.  As Albert's uncle said, 'School now gaped
for its prey'.  In a very short space of time we should be wending
our way back to Blackheath, and all the variegated delightfulness
of the country would soon be only preserved in memory's faded
flowers.  (I don't care for that way of writing very much.  It
would be an awful swot to keep it up - looking out the words and all
that.)</p>

<p>To speak in the language of everyday life, our holiday was jolly
nearly up.  We had had a ripping time, but it was all but over.  We
really did feel sorry -  though, of course, it was rather decent to
think of getting back to Father and being able to tell the other
chaps about our raft, and the dam, and the Tower of Mystery, and
things like that.</p>

<p>When but a brief time was left to us, Oswald and Dicky met by
chance in an apple-tree.  (That sounds like 'consequences', but it
is mere truthfulness.) Dicky said - </p>

<p>'Only four more days.'</p>

<p>Oswald said, 'Yes.'</p>

<p>'There's one thing,' Dickie said, 'that beastly society.  We don't
want that swarming all over everything when we get home.  We ought
to dissolve it before we leave here.'</p>

<p>The following dialogue now took place:</p>

<p>Oswald - 'Right you are.  I always said it was piffling rot.'</p>

<p>Dicky - 'So did I.'</p>

<p>Oswald - 'Let's call a council.  But don't forget we've jolly well
got to put our foot down.'</p>

<p>Dicky assented, and the dialogue concluded with apples.</p>

<p>The council, when called, was in but low spirits.  This made
Oswald's and Dicky's task easier.  When people are sunk in gloomy
despair about one thing, they will agree to almost anything about
something else.  (Remarks like this are called philosophic
generalizations, Albert's uncle says.) Oswald began by saying - </p>

<p>'We've tried the society for being good in, and perhaps it's done
us good.  But now the time has come for each of us to be good or
bad on his own, without hanging on to the others.'</p>

<p>'The race is run by one and one,
But never by two and two,'</p>

<p>the Dentist said.</p>

<p>The others said nothing.</p>

<p>Oswald went on: 'I move that we chuck - I mean dissolve -  the
Wouldbegoods Society; its appointed task is done.  If it's not well
done, that's ITS fault and not ours.'</p>

<p>Dicky said, 'Hear! hear! I second this prop.'</p>

<p>The unexpected Dentist said, 'I third it.  At first I thought it
would help, but afterwards I saw it only made you want to be
naughty, just because you were a Wouldbegood.'</p>

<p>Oswald owns he was surprised.  We put it to the vote at once, so as
not to let Denny cool.  H. O. and Noel and Alice voted with us, so
Daisy and Dora were what is called a hopeless minority.  We tried
to cheer their hopelessness by letting them read the things out of
the Golden Deed book aloud.  Noel hid his face in the straw so that
we should not see the faces he made while he made poetry instead of
listening, and when the Wouldbegoods was by vote dissolved for ever
he sat up, straws in his hair, and said - </p>

<blockquote><div>THE EPITAPH<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>'The Wouldbegoods are dead and gone<br />
But not the golden deeds they have done<br />
These will remain upon Glory's page<br />
To be an example to every age,<br />
And by this we have got to know<br />
How to be good upon our ow - N.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>N is for Noel, that makes the rhyme and the sense both right.  O,
W, N, own; do you see?'</p>

<p>We saw it, and said so, and the gentle poet was satisfied.  And the
council broke up.  Oswald felt that a weight had been lifted from
his expanding chest, and it is curious that he never felt so
inclined to be good and a model youth as he did then.  As he went
down the ladder out of the loft he said - </p>

<p>'There's one thing we ought to do, though, before we go home.  We
ought to find Albert's uncle's long- lost grandmother for him.'</p>

<p>Alice's heart beat true and steadfast.  She said, 'That's just
exactly what Noel and I were saying this morning.  Look out,
Oswald, you wretch, you're kicking chaff into my eyes.'  She was
going down the ladder just under me.</p>

<p>Oswald's younger sister's thoughtful remark ended in another
council.  But not in the straw loft.  We decided to have a quite
new place, and disregarded H. O.'s idea of the dairy and Noel's of
the cellars.  We had the new council on the secret staircase, and
there we settled exactly what we ought to do.  This is the same
thing, if you really wish to be good, as what you are going to do. 
It was a very interesting council, and when it was over Oswald was
so pleased to think that the Wouldbegoods was unrecoverishly dead
that he gave Denny and Noel, who were sitting on the step below
him, a good-humoured, playful, gentle, loving, brotherly shove, and
said, 'Get along down, it's tea-time!'</p>

<p>No reader who understands justice and the real rightness of things,
and who is to blame for what, will ever think it could have been
Oswald's fault that the two other boys got along down by rolling
over and over each other, and bursting the door at the bottom of
the stairs open by their revolving bodies.  And I should like to
know whose fault it was that Mrs Pettigrew was just on the other
side of that door at that very minute?  The door burst open, and
the Impetuous bodies of Noel and Denny rolled out of it into Mrs
Pettigrew, and upset her and the tea-tray.  Both revolving boys
were soaked with tea and milk, and there were one or two cups and
things smashed.  Mrs Pettigrew was knocked over, but none of her
bones were broken.  Noel and Denny were going to be sent to bed,
but Oswald said it was all his fault.  He really did this to give
the others a chance of doing a refined golden deed by speaking the
truth and saying it was not his fault.  But you cannot really count
on anyone.  They did not say anything, but only rubbed the lumps on
their late-revolving heads.  So it was bed for Oswald, and he felt
the injustice hard.</p>

<p>But he sat up in bed and read The Last of the Mohicans, and then he
began to think.  When Oswald really thinks he almost always thinks
of something.  He thought of something now, and it was miles better
than the idea we had decided on in the secret staircase, of
advertising in the Kentish Mercury and saying if Albert's uncle's
long-lost grandmother would call at the Moat House she might hear
of something much to her advantage.</p>

<p>What Oswald thought of was that if we went to Hazelbridge and asked
Mr B. Munn, Grocer, that drove us home in the cart with the horse
that liked the wrong end of the whip best, he would know who the
lady was in the red hat and red wheels that paid him to drive us
home that Canterbury night.  He must have been paid, of course, for
even grocers are not generous enough to drive perfect strangers,
and five of them too, about the country for nothing.
Thus we may learn that even unjustness and sending the wrong people
to bed may bear useful fruit, which ought to be a great comfort to
everyone when they are unfairly treated.  Only it most likely won't
be.  For if Oswald's brothers and sisters had nobly stood by him as
he expected, he would not have had the solitary reflections that
led to the great scheme for finding the grandmother.</p>

<p>Of course when the others came up to roost they all came and
squatted on Oswald's bed and said how sorry they were.  He waived
their apologies with noble dignity, because there wasn't much time,
and said he had an idea that would knock the council's plan into a
cocked hat.  But he would not tell them what it was.  He made them
wait till next morning.  This was not sulks, but kind feeling.  He
wanted them to have something else to think of besides the way they
hadn't stood by him in the bursting of the secret staircase door
and the tea-tray and the milk.</p>

<p>Next morning Oswald kindly explained, and asked who would volunteer
for a forced march to Hazelbridge.  The word volunteer cost the
young Oswald a pang as soon as he had said it, but I hope he can
bear pangs with any man living.  'And mind,' he added, hiding the
pang under a general-like severeness, 'I won't have anyone in the
expedition who has anything in his shoes except his feet.'</p>

<p>This could not have been put more delicately and decently.  But
Oswald is often misunderstood.  Even Alice said it was unkind to
throw the peas up at Denny.  When this little unpleasantness had
passed away (it took some time because Daisy cried, and Dora said,
'There now, Oswald!') there were seven volunteers, which, with
Oswald, made eight, and was, indeed, all of us.  There were no
cockle-shells, or tape-sandals, or staves, or scrips, or anything
romantic and pious about the eight persons who set out for
Hazelbridge that morning, more earnestly wishful to be good and
deedful - at least Oswald, I know, was - than ever they had been in
the days of the beastly Wouldbegood Society.  It was a fine day. 
Either it was fine nearly all last summer, which is how Oswald
remembers it, or else nearly all the interesting things we did came
on fine days.</p>

<p>With hearts light and gay, and no peas in anyone's shoes, the walk
to Hazelbridge was perseveringly conducted.  We took our lunch with
us, and the dear dogs.  Afterwards we wished for a time that we had
left one of them at home.  But they did so want to come, all of
them, and Hazelbridge is not nearly as far as Canterbury, really,
so even Martha was allowed to put on her things - I mean her
collar - and come with us.  She walks slowly, but we had the day
before us so there was no extra hurry.</p>

<p>At Hazelbridge we went into B. Munn's grocer's shop and asked for
ginger-beer to drink.  They gave it us, but they seemed surprised
at us wanting to drink it there, and the glass was warm - it had
just been washed.  We only did it, really, so as to get into
conversation with B. Munn, grocer, and extract information without
rousing suspicion.  You cannot be too careful.
However, when we had said it was first-class ginger- beer, and paid
for it, we found it not so easy to extract anything more from B.
Munn, grocer; and there was an anxious silence while he fiddled
about behind the counter among the tinned meats and sauce bottles,
with a fringe of hobnailed boots hanging over his head.</p>

<p>H. O. spoke suddenly.  He is like the sort of person who rushes in
where angels fear to tread, as Denny says (say what sort of person
that is).  He said - </p>

<p>'I say, you remember driving us home that day.  Who paid for the
cart?'</p>

<p>Of course B. Munn, grocer, was not such a nincompoop (I like that
word, it means so many people I know) as to say right off.  He
said - </p>

<p>'I was paid all right, young gentleman.  Don't you terrify
yourself.'</p>

<p>People in Kent say terrify when they mean worry.  So Dora shoved in
a gentle oar.  She said - </p>

<p>'We want to know the kind lady's name and address, so that we can
write and thank her for being so jolly that day.'</p>

<p>B. Munn, grocer, muttered something about the lady's address being
goods he was often asked for.  Alice said, 'But do tell us.  We
forgot to ask her.  She's a relation of a second-hand uncle of
ours, and I do so want to thank her properly.  And if you've got
any extra-strong peppermints at a penny an ounce, we should like a
quarter of a pound.'</p>

<p>This was a master-stroke.  While he was weighing out the
peppermints his heart got soft, and just as he was twisting up the
corner of the paper bag, Dora said, 'What lovely fat peppermints!
Do tell us.'</p>

<p>And B. Munn's heart was now quite melted, he said - </p>

<p>'It's Miss Ashleigh, and she lives at The Cedars - about a mile down
the Maidstone Road.'</p>

<p>We thanked him, and Alice paid for the peppermints.  Oswald was a
little anxious when she ordered such a lot, but she and Noel had
got the money all right, and when we were outside on Hazelbridge
Green (a good deal of it is gravel, really), we stood and looked at
each other.  Then Dora said - </p>

<p>'Let's go home and write a beautiful letter and all sign it.'</p>

<p>Oswald looked at the others.  Writing is all very well, but it's
such a beastly long time to wait for anything to happen afterwards.</p>

<p>The intelligent Alice divined his thoughts, and the Dentist divined
hers - he is not clever enough yet to divine Oswald's - and the two
said together - </p>

<p>'Why not go and see her?'</p>

<p>'She did say she would like to see us again some day,' Dora
replied.  So after we had argued a little about it we went.</p>

<p>And before we had gone a hundred yards down the dusty road Martha
began to make us wish with all our hearts we had not let her come. 
She began to limp, just as a pilgrim, who I will not name, did when
he had the split peas in his silly palmering shoes.</p>

<p>So we called a halt and looked at her feet.  One of them was quite
swollen and red.  Bulldogs almost always have something the matter
with their feet, and it always comes on when least required.  They
are not the right breed for emergencies.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to take it in turns to carry her.  She
is very stout, and you have no idea how heavy she is.  A
half-hearted unadventurous person name no names, but Oswald, Alice,
Noel, H. O., Dicky, Daisy, and Denny will understand me) said, why
not go straight home and come another day without Martha?  But the
rest agreed with Oswald when he said it was only a mile, and
perhaps we might get a lift home with the poor invalid.  Martha was
very grateful to us for our kindness.  She put her fat white arms
round the person's neck who happened to be carrying her.  She is
very affectionate, but by holding her very close to you you can
keep her from kissing your face all the time.  As Alice said,
'Bulldogs do give you such large, wet, pink kisses.'</p>

<p>A mile is a good way when you have to take your turn at carrying
Martha.</p>

<p>At last we came to a hedge with a ditch in front of it, and chains
swinging from posts to keep people off the grass and out of the
ditch, and a gate with 'The Cedars' on it in gold letters.  All
very neat and tidy, and showing plainly that more than one gardener
was kept.  There we stopped.  Alice put Martha down, grunting with
exhaustedness, and said - </p>

<p>'Look here, Dora and Daisy, I don't believe a bit that it's his
grandmother.  I'm sure Dora was right, and it's only his horrid
sweetheart.  I feel it in my bones.  Now, don't you really think
we'd better chuck it; we're sure to catch it for interfering.  We
always do.'</p>

<p>'The cross of true love never did come smooth,' said the Dentist. 
'We ought to help him to bear his cross.'</p>

<p>'But if we find her for him, and she's not his grandmother, he'll
MARRY her,' Dicky said in tones of gloominess and despair.</p>

<p>Oswald felt the same, but he said, 'Never mind.  We should all hate
it, but perhaps Albert's uncle MIGHT like it.  You can never tell. 
If you want to do a really unselfish action and no kid, now's your
time, my late Wouldbegoods.'</p>

<p>No one had the face to say right out that they didn't want to be
unselfish.</p>

<p>But it was with sad hearts that the unselfish seekers opened the
long gate and went up the gravel drive between the rhododendrons
and other shrubberies towards the house.</p>

<p>I think I have explained to you before that the eldest son of
anybody is called the representative of the family if his father
isn't there.  This was why Oswald now took the lead.  When we got
to the last turn of the drive it was settled that the others were
to noiselessly ambush in the rhododendrons, and Oswald was to go on
alone and ask at the house for the grandmother from India - I mean
Miss Ashleigh.</p>

<p>So he did, but when he got to the front of the house and saw how
neat the flower-beds were with red geraniums, and the windows all
bright and speckless with muslin blinds and brass rods, and a green
parrot in a cage in the porch, and the doorstep newly whited, lying
clean and untrodden in the sunshine, he stood still and thought of
his boots and how dusty the roads were, and wished he had not gone
into the farmyard after eggs before starting that morning.  As he
stood there in anxious uncertainness he heard a low voice among the
bushes.  It said, 'Hist!  Oswald here!' and it was the voice of
Alice.</p>

<p>So he went back to the others among the shrubs and they all crowded
round their leader full of importable news.</p>

<p>'She's not in the house; she's HERE,' Alice said in a low whisper
that seemed nearly all S's.  'Close by - she went by just this
minute with a gentleman.'</p>

<p>'And they're sitting on a seat under a tree on a little lawn, and
she's got her head on his shoulder, and he's holding her hand.  I
never saw anyone look so silly in all my born,' Dicky said.</p>

<p>'It's sickening,' Denny said, trying to look very manly with his
legs wide apart.</p>

<p>'I don't know,' Oswald whispered.  'I suppose it wasn't Albert's
uncle?'</p>

<p>'Not much,' Dicky briefly replied.</p>

<p>'Then don't you see it's all right.  If she's going on like that
with this fellow she'll want to marry him, and Albert's uncle is
safe.  And we've really done an unselfish action without having to
suffer for it afterwards.'</p>

<p>With a stealthy movement Oswald rubbed his hands as he spoke in
real joyfulness.  We decided that we had better bunk unnoticed. 
But we had reckoned without Martha.  She had strolled off limping
to look about her a bit in the shrubbery.  'Where's Martha?' Dora
suddenly said.</p>

<p>'She went that way,' pointingly remarked H. O.</p>

<p>'Then fetch her back, you young duffer!  What did you let her go
for?' Oswald said.  'And look sharp.  Don't make a row.'</p>

<p>He went.  A minute later we heard a hoarse squeak from Martha - the
one she always gives when suddenly collared from behind - and a
little squeal in a lady-like voice, and a man say 'Hallo!' and then
we knew that H. O. had once more rushed in where angels might have
thought twice about it.  We hurried to the fatal spot, but it was
too late.  We were just in time to hear H. O. say - </p>

<p>'I'm sorry if she frightened you.  But we've been looking for you. 
Are you Albert's uncle's long-lost grandmother?'</p>

<p>'NO,' said our lady unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>It seemed vain to add seven more agitated actors to the scene now
going on.  We stood still.  The man was standing up.  He was a
clergyman, and I found out afterwards he was the nicest we ever
knew except our own Mr Briston at Lewisham, who is now a canon or
a dean, or something grand that no one ever sees.  At present I did
not like him.  He said, 'No, this lady is nobody's grandmother. 
May I ask in return how long it is since you escaped from the
lunatic asylum, my poor child, and whence your keeper is?'</p>

<p>H. O. took no notice of this at all, except to say, 'I think you
are very rude, and not at all funny, if you think you are.'</p>

<p>The lady said, 'My dear, I remember you now perfectly.  How are all
the others, and are you pilgrims again to-day?'</p>

<p>H. O. does not always answer questions.  He turned to the man and
said - </p>

<p>'Are you going to marry the lady?'</p>

<p>'Margaret,' said the clergyman, 'I never thought it would come to
this: he asks me my intentions.'</p>

<p>'If you ARE,' said H. O., 'it's all right, because if you do
Albert's uncle can't - at least, not till you're dead.  And we don't
want him to.'</p>

<p>'Flattering, upon my word,' said the clergyman, putting on a deep
frown.  'Shall I call him out, Margaret, for his poor opinion of
you, or shall I send for the police?'</p>

<p>Alice now saw that H. O., though firm, was getting muddled and
rather scared.  She broke cover and sprang into the middle of the
scene.</p>

<p>'Don't let him rag H. O. any more,' she said, 'it's all our faults.
You see, Albert's uncle was so anxious to find you, we thought
perhaps you were his long-lost heiress sister or his old nurse who
alone knew the secret of his birth, or something, and we asked him,
and he said you were his long-lost grandmother he had known in
India.  And we thought that must be a mistake and that really you
were his long-lost sweetheart.  And we tried to do a really
unselfish act and find you for him.  Because we don't want him to
be married at all.'</p>

<p>'It isn't because we don't like YOU,' Oswald cut in, now emerging
from the bushes, 'and if he must marry, we'd sooner it was you than
anyone.  Really we would.'</p>

<p>'A generous concession, Margaret,' the strange clergyman uttered,
'most generous, but the plot thickens.  It's almost pea-soup-like
now.  One or two points clamour for explanation.  Who are these
visitors of yours?  Why this Red Indian method of paying morning
calls?  Why the lurking attitude of the rest of the tribe which I
now discern among the undergrowth?  Won't you ask the rest of the
tribe to come out and join the glad throng?'</p>

<p>Then I liked him better.  I always like people who know the same
songs we do, and books and tunes and things.</p>

<p>The others came out.  The lady looked very uncomfy, and partly as
if she was going to cry.  But she couldn't help laughing too, as
more and more of us came out.</p>

<p>'And who,' the clergyman went on, 'who in fortune's name is Albert?
And who is his uncle?  And what have they or you to do in this
galere - I mean garden?'</p>

<p>We all felt rather silly, and I don't think I ever felt more than
then what an awful lot there were of us.</p>

<p>'Three years' absence in Calcutta or elsewhere may explain my
ignorance of these details, but still - '</p>

<p>'I think we'd better go,' said Dora.  'I'm sorry if we've done
anything rude or wrong.  We didn't mean to.  Good-bye.  I hope
you'll be happy with the gentleman, I'm sure.'</p>

<p>'I HOPE so too,' said Noel, and I know he was thinking how much
nicer Albert's uncle was.  We turned to go.  The lady had been very
silent compared with what she was when she pretended to show us
Canterbury.  But now she seemed to shake off some dreamy silliness,
and caught hold of Dora by the shoulder.</p>

<p>'No, dear, no,' she said, 'it's all right, and you must have some
tea - we'll have it on the lawn.  John, don't tease them any more. 
Albert's uncle is the gentleman I told you about.  And, my dear
children, this is my brother that I haven't seen for three years.'</p>

<p>'Then he's a long-lost too,' said H. O.</p>

<p>The lady said 'Not now' and smiled at him.</p>

<p>And the rest of us were dumb with confounding emotions.  Oswald was
particularly dumb.  He might have known it was her brother, because
in rotten grown-up books if a girl kisses a man in a shrubbery that
is not the man you think she's in love with; it always turns out to
be a brother, though generally the disgrace of the family and not
a respectable chaplain from Calcutta.</p>

<p>The lady now turned to her reverend and surprising brother and
said, 'John, go and tell them we'll have tea on the lawn.'</p>

<p>When he was gone she stood quite still a minute.  Then she said,
'I'm going to tell you something, but I want to put you on your
honour not to talk about it to other people.  You see it isn't
everyone I would tell about it.  He, Albert's uncle, I mean, has
told me a lot about you, and I know I can trust you.'</p>

<p>We said 'Yes', Oswald with a brooding sentiment of knowing all too
well what was coming next.</p>

<p>The lady then said, 'Though I am not Albert's uncle's grandmother
I did know him in India once, and we were going to be married, but
we had a - a - misunderstanding.'</p>

<p>'Quarrel?'  Row?' said Noel and H. O. at once.</p>

<p>'Well, yes, a quarrel, and he went away.  He was in the Navy then. 
And then ...  well, we were both sorry, but well, anyway, when his
ship came back we'd gone to Constantinople, then to England, and he
couldn't find us.  And he says he's been looking for me ever
since.'</p>

<p>'Not you for him?' said Noel.</p>

<p>'Well, perhaps,' said the lady.</p>

<p>And the girls said 'Ah!' with deep interest.  The lady went on more
quickly, 'And then I found you, and then he found me, and now I
must break it to you.  Try to bear up.'</p>

<p>She stopped.  The branches cracked, and Albert's uncle was in our
midst.  He took off his hat.  'Excuse my tearing my hair,' he said
to the lady, 'but has the pack really hunted you down?'</p>

<p>'It's all right,' she said, and when she looked at him she got
miles prettier quite suddenly.  'I was just breaking to them ...'</p>

<p>'Don't take that proud privilege from me,' he said.  'Kiddies,
allow me to present you to the future Mrs Albert's uncle, or shall
we say Albert's new aunt?'</p>

                         <ul>
                         <li>    <strong>    </strong>
There was a good deal of explaining done before tea - about how we
got there, I mean, and why.  But after the first bitterness of
disappointment we felt not nearly so sorry as we had expected to. 
For Albert's uncle's lady was very jolly to us, and her brother was
awfully decent, and showed us a lot of first-class native
curiosities and things, unpacking them on purpose; skins of beasts,
and beads, and brass things, and shells from different savage lands
besides India.  And the lady told the girls that she hoped they
would like her as much as she liked them, and if they wanted a new
aunt she would do her best to give satisfaction in the new
situation.  And Alice thought of the Murdstone aunt belonging to
Daisy and Denny, and how awful it would have been if Albert's uncle
had married HER.  And she decided, she told me afterwards, that we 
might think ourselves jolly lucky it was no worse.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then the lady led Oswald aside, pretending to show him the parrot
which he had explored thoroughly before, and told him she was not
like some people in books.  When she was married she would never
try to separate her husband from his bachelor friends, she only
wanted them to be her friends as well.</p>

<p>Then there was tea, and thus all ended in amicableness, and the
reverend and friendly drove us home in a wagonette.  But for Martha
we shouldn't have had tea, or explanations, or lift or anything. 
So we honoured her, and did not mind her being so heavy and walking
up and down constantly on our laps as we drove home.</p>

<p>And that is all the story of the long-lost grandmother and Albert's
uncle.  I am afraid it is rather dull, but it was very important
(to him), so I felt it ought to be narrated.  Stories about lovers
and getting married are generally slow.  I like a love-story where
the hero parts with the girl at the garden-gate in the gloaming and
goes off and has adventures, and you don't see her any more till he
comes home to marry her at the end of the book.  And I suppose
people have to marry.  Albert's uncle is awfully old - more than
thirty, and the lady is advanced in years - twenty-six next
Christmas.  They are to be married then.  The girls are to be
bridesmaids in white frocks with fur.  This quite consoles them. 
If Oswald repines sometimes, he hides it.  What's the use?  We all
have to meet our fell destiny, and Albert's uncle is not extirpated
from this awful law.</p>

<p>Now the finding of the long-lost was the very last thing we did for
the sake of its being a noble act, so that is the end of the
Wouldbegoods, and there are no more chapters after this.  But
Oswald hates books that finish up without telling you the things
you might want to know about the people in the book.  So here goes.</p>

<p>We went home to the beautiful Blackheath house.  It seemed very
stately and mansion-like after the Moat House, and everyone was
most frightfully pleased to see us.</p>

<p>Mrs Pettigrew CRIED when we went away.  I never was so astonished
in my life.  She made each of the girls a fat red pincushion like
a heart, and each of us boys had a knife bought out of the
housekeeping (I mean housekeeper's own) money.</p>

<p>Bill Simpkins is happy as sub-under-gardener to Albert's uncle's
lady's mother.  They do keep three gardeners - I knew they did.  And
our tramp still earns enough to sleep well on from our dear old
Pig-man.</p>

<p>Our last three days were entirely filled up with visits of farewell
sympathy to all our many friends who were so sorry to lose us.  We
promised to come and see them next year.  I hope we shall.</p>

<p>Denny and Daisy went back to live with their father at Forest Hill.
I don't think they'll ever be again the victims of the Murdstone
aunt - who is really a great-aunt and about twice as much in the
autumn of her days as our new Albert's-uncle aunt.  I think they
plucked up spirit enough to tell their father they didn't like
her - which they'd never thought of doing before.  Our own robber
says their holidays in the country did them both a great deal of
good.  And he says us Bastables have certainly taught Daisy and
Denny the rudiments of the art of making home happy.  I believe
they have thought of several quite new naughty things entirely on
their own - and done them too - since they came back from the Moat
House.</p>

<p>I wish you didn't grow up so quickly.  Oswald can see that ere long
he will be too old for the kind of games we can all play, and he
feels grown-upness creeping inordiously upon him.  But enough of
this.</p>

<p>And now, gentle reader, farewell.  If anything in these chronicles
of the Wouldbegoods should make you try to be good yourself, the
author will be very glad, of course.  But take my advice and don't
make a society for trying in.  It is much easier without.</p>

<p>And do try to forget that Oswald has another name besides Bastable.
The one beginning with C., I mean.  Perhaps you have not noticed
what it was.  If so, don't look back for it.  It is a name no manly
boy would like to be called by - if he spoke the truth.  Oswald is
said to be a very manly boy, and he despises that name, and will
never give it to his own son when he has one.  Not if a rich
relative offered to leave him an immense fortune if he did.  Oswald
would still be firm.  He would, on the honour of the House of
Bastable.</p>
