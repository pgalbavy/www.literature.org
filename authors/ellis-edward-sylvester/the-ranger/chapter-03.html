<p>When Roland Leslie reached his destination some miles up the
Ohio, his fears and suspicions were confirmed. There had been
a massacre, a week previous, of a number of settlers, and the
Indians were scouring the country for more victims.</p>

<p>This information was given by Kent Whiteman, the person for whom
he was searching. This personage was a strange character, some
forty years of age, who led a wandering hunter's life, and was
known by every white man for a great distance along the Ohio.
Roland Leslie had made his acquaintance when but a mere lad, and
they often spent weeks together hunting and roaming through the
great wilderness, which was the home of both. He cherished an
implacable hatred to every red-man, and they in turn often sought
his life, for they had no enemy so dangerous as he.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, them varmints," said he, as he leaned upon his long
rifle and gazed at Leslie, "are playing particular devil in these
parts, and I calkelate it's a game that two can play at."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Them varmints," said he, "are playing particular
devil in these parts."]</p>

<p>"Jump in the boat, Kent," said Leslie, "and ride down with me;
I promised George Leland that if he needed assistance I would
bring it to him."</p>

<p>"He needs it, that's a p'inted fact, and as soon as it can conveniently
reach him too."</p>

<p>"Well, let us be off." Leslie dipped his oars in the water and
pulled out into the stream. It was the morning after the burning
of the Lelands' home, which of course was unknown to them. For
a few moments the boat glided rapidly down the stream, when Whiteman
spoke:</p>

<p>"Where'd you put up last night, Leslie?"</p>

<p>"About ten miles down the river. I ran in under the bank and
had an undisturbed night's rest?"</p>

<p>"Didn't hear nothin' of the red-skins?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Wal, it's a wonder; they're as thick as flies in August, and
I calkelate I'll have rich times with 'em."</p>

<p>"I cannot understand how it is, Kent, that you cherish such a
deadly hatred for these Indians."</p>

<p>"I have good reason," returned the hunter, compressing his lips.</p>

<p>"How long is it that you have felt thus?"</p>

<p>"Ever since I's a boy. Ever since <em>that</em> time."</p>

<p>"What time, Kent?"</p>

<p>"I have never told you, I believe, why the sight of a red-skin
throws me into such a fit, have I?"</p>

<p>"No; I should certainly be glad to hear."</p>

<p>"Wal, it doesn't take long to tell. Yet how few persons know
it except myself. It is nigh thirty years ago," commenced Kent,
"that I lived about a dozen miles above the place that we left
this morning. There I was born and lived with my old father and
mother until I was ten or eleven years old.</p>

<p>"One dark, stormy night we war attacked by them red devils, and
that father and mother were butchered before my eyes. During the
confusion of the attack, I escaped to the woods and secreted m'self
until it was over. It was a hard matter to lie there, scorched
by the flames of your own home, and see your parents, while begging
for mercy, tomahawked and slain before your eyes. But in such
a position I was placed, and remained until the savages, satisfied
with their bloody work, took their departure.</p>

<p>"When the rain, which fell in torrents, had extinguished the
smoking ruins, I crawled from my hiding-place. I felt around until
I come upon the cold bodies of my father and mother lyin' side
by side, and then kneelin' over them, I took a fearful oath&mdash;an
oath to which I have devoted my life. I swore that as long as
life was given me, it should be used for revengin' the slaughter
of my parents. That night these savages contracted a debt of which
they little dreamed. Before they left the place, I had marked
each of the dozen, and I never forgot them. For ten years I follered
and tracked them, and at the end of that time I had sent the last
one to his final account. Yet that did not satisfy me. I swore
<em>eternal</em> enmity against the whole people, and as I said,
it shall be carried out. While Kent is alive, he is the mortal
enemy of every red-skin."</p>

<p>The hunter looked up in the face of Leslie, and his gleaming
eyes and gnashing teeth told his earnestness. His manner and recital
had impressed the latter, and he forbore speaking to him for some
time.</p>

<p>"I should think," observed Leslie, after a short silence, "that
you had nearly paid that debt, Kent."</p>

<p>"It is a debt which will be balanced," rejoined the hunter, "when
I am unable to make any more payments."</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't want you for an enemy," added Leslie, glancing
over his shoulder at the stream in front of him.</p>

<p>Both banks of the river at this point, and, in fact, for many
miles, were lined with overhanging trees and bushes, which might
afford shelter to any enemy. Kent sat in the stern and glanced
suspiciously at each bank, as the boat was impelled swiftly yet
silently forward, and there was not even a falling leaf that escaped
his keen eye.</p>

<p>"Strikes me," said Leslie, leaning on his oars, "that we are
in rather a dangerous vicinity. Those thick bushes along the shore,
over there, might easily contain a few red gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed," returned the hunter, "I'll keep a good watch.
They've got to make some movement before they can harm us, and
I'll be sure to see them. The river's wide, too, and there ain't
so much to fear, after all."</p>

<p>Leslie again dipped his oars, and the boat shot forward in silence.
Nothing but the suppressed dip of the slender ashen blades, or
the dull sighing of the wind through the tree-tops, broke the
silence of the great solitude. Suddenly, as Leslie bent forward
and gazed into the hunter's face, he saw him start and gaze anxiously
at the right shore, some distance ahead.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Leslie.</p>

<p>"Just wait a minute," returned the hunter, rising and gazing
in the same direction. "Stop the boat. Back water!" he added,
in a hurried tone.</p>

<p>Leslie did as he was bidden, and again spoke:</p>

<p>"What is it, Kent?"</p>

<p>"Do you see them bushes hangin' a little further out in the stream
than the others?"</p>

<p>"Yes; what of them?"</p>

<p>"Watch them a minute. There&mdash;look quick!" said Kent.</p>

<p>"I can see a fluttering among the branches, as if a bird had
flown from it," answered Leslie.</p>

<p>"Wal, them birds is Indians, that's all," remarked the hunter,
dropping composedly back into the boat. "Go ahead!"</p>

<p>"They will fire into us, no doubt. Had I not better run in to
the other shore?"</p>

<p>"No; there may be a host of 'em there. Keep in the middle of
the stream, and we'll give 'em the slip yet."</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Leslie experienced rather strange sensations
as he neared the locality which had excited their suspicion, especially
when he knew that he was exposed to any shot that they might feel
inclined to give. A shudder ran through his frame, when, directly
opposite the spot, he distinctly heard a groan of agony.</p>

<p>Kent made a motion for him to cease rowing. Bending their heads
down and listening, they again heard that now loud, agonizing
expression of mortal pain.</p>

<p>As soon as Leslie was certain that the sound proceeded from some
being in distress, he headed the boat toward the shore.</p>

<p>"Stop!" commanded Kent; "you should have more sense than that."</p>

<p>"But will you not assist a person in distress?" asked he, gazing
reproachfully into his face.</p>

<p>"Who's in distress?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Gorra mighty! I's been dyin'," now came from the shore.</p>

<p>"Hallo there! what's wantin'?" called Whiteman.</p>

<p>"Help, help, 'fore dis Indian gentleman&mdash;'fore I dies from de
wounds dat dey's given me."</p>

<p>"I've heard that voice before," remarked Kent to Leslie, in an
undertone.</p>

<p>"So have I," replied the latter. "Why, it is George Leland's
negro; <em>he</em> wouldn't decoy us into danger. Let us go in."</p>

<p>"Wait until I speak further with him." (Then, to the person upon
shore): "What might be your name?"</p>

<p>"Zeb Langdon. Isn't dat old Kent?"</p>

<p>"Yes; how came you in this scrape, Zeb?"</p>

<p>"Gorra mighty! I didn't come into it. Dem red dogs&mdash;dese here
nice fellers&mdash;brought me here 'bout two months ago, and den dey
all fired at me fur two or free days, and den dey hung me up and
left me to starve to death. Boo-hoo-oo!"</p>

<p>"But," said Leslie, "you were at home yesterday when I came up
the river."</p>

<p>"Yes; dey burned down de house last night, and cooked us all
and eat us up. I's come to live ag'in, and crawled down here to
get you fellers to take me home; but, Lord bless you, don't come
ashore&mdash;blast you, quit a hittin' me over de head," added the
negro, evidently to some one near him.</p>

<p>Leslie and Whiteman exchanged significant glances, and silently
worked the boat further from the land.</p>

<p>"Who is that you spoke to?" asked the former, when they were
at a safe distance.</p>

<p>"Dis yere blasted limb reached down and pulled my wool," replied
the negro, with perfect <em>nonchalance</em>.</p>

<p>"Where is George Leland?" asked Leslie.</p>

<p>"Dunno; slipped away from dese yere nice fellers what's pulled
all de wool out of me head, and is tellin' me a lot o' yarns to
tell you. Gorra mighty! can't you let a feller 'lone, when he's
yarnin' as good as he can?"</p>

<p>"Where is Miss Leland?"</p>

<p>"How does I know? A lot of 'em run off wid her last night."</p>

<p>"Oh God! what I expected," said Leslie, dropping his voice, and
gazing with an agonizing look at Whiteman. The latter, regardless
of his emotion, continued his conversation with Zeb.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt any?"</p>

<p>"Considerable."</p>

<p>"Now, Zeb, tell the truth. Did they capture George Leland?"</p>

<p>"Bless you, no. He got away during de trouble."</p>

<p>"Did they get Miss Leland?"</p>

<p>"'Deed they did."</p>

<p>"Is she with you?"</p>

<p>"No. It took forty of 'em to watch me and de rest."</p>

<p>Here the negro's words were cut short with a jerk, and he gave
vent to a loud groan.</p>

<p>"Gorra mighty!" he ejaculated, in fury. "Come ashore, Mr. Whiteman
and Mr. Leslie. Come quick, and let dese yer fellers got you.
Dey wants yer too."</p>

<p>"Are there any of the imps with you?" asked Kent, more for amusement
than anything else.</p>

<p>"What shall I tell him?" the negro asked, in a husky whisper,
loud enough to be plainly heard by the two in the boat.</p>

<p>"Dey say dar ain't any of 'em. Talk yourself, if dat doesn't
suit you," he added, in great wrath.</p>

<p>"Three cheers for you," shouted Whiteman. "Are there any of 'em
upon the other side?"</p>

<p>"Dese fellers say dey am all dar. Gorra, don't kill me."</p>

<p>"Good; you're the best nigger 'long the 'Hio. I guess we'll go
over to the other side and visit them."</p>

<p>So saying, Kent seized the oars and pulled for the opposite shore.
He had not taken more than a couple of strokes when a dozen rifles
cracked simultaneously from the bushes, and as many bullets struck
the boat and glanced over the water.</p>

<p>"Drop down," he whispered to Leslie. Instead of doing the same
himself, he bent the more vigorously to his oars. A few minutes
sufficed to carry them so far down that little danger was to be
apprehended from the Indians, who uttered their loudest shouts
and discharged their rifles, as they passed beyond their reach.</p>

<p>"That's too good a chance to be lost," muttered the ranger, bringing
his long rifle to his shoulder. Leslie followed the direction
of his aim, and saw a daring savage standing boldly out to view,
and making furious gesticulations toward them. The next instant
Kent's rifle uttered its sharp report, and the Indian, with a
yell, sprung several feet in the air, and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>"That was a good shot," remarked Leslie, gazing at the fallen
body.</p>

<p>"Yes, and it's done just what I wanted it to," replied Kent,
heading the boat toward shore.</p>

<p>"They are going to pursue us, are they not?" asked Leslie.</p>

<p>"Yes, and we'll have fun," added the ranger, as the boat touched
the shore, and he sprung out.</p>

<p>"Come along and make up yer mind for a long run," said he, glancing
furtively toward the savages.</p>

<p>Leslie sprung after him, and they darted away into the forest.</p>

<p>When Whiteman had fired his fatal shot the Indians were so infuriated,
that, setting up their demoniac yells, they plunged down the banks
of the stream, determined to revenge their fallen companion.</p>

<p>This was what Kent desired. He exulted as he saw that he was
being gratified. "If there isn't fun pretty shortly it won't be
my fault," said he, as he plunged onward into the forest.</p>

<p>In a short time the pursuers gained the opposite shore, and followed
with renewed ardor into the wilderness. Kent and Leslie, however,
had gained a good start. Both being rapid runners, they had not
much to fear. Had nothing unusual occurred, they would easily
have distanced their pursuers. But Leslie, following Kent in a
leap across a rocky gorge, struck in his comrade's footsteps in
the earth upon its edge. The earth had become loosened and started
by the shock, and ere Leslie could recover his footing, he fell
some fifteen or twenty feet to the bottom. The fall bruised him
so much that he was unable to rise, or in fact hardly to stir.</p>

<p>"Hurt?" asked the ranger, gazing over at him.</p>

<p>"Yes," groaned Leslie. "I can't get up. Don't wait for me, for
it's no use. Go on and save yourself."</p>

<p>"I hate to leave you, but it's got to be done. Lay down there;
crawl in under that rock. Perhaps they won't see you. Quick, for
I hear 'em comin'."</p>

<p>With these words the hunter turned and disappeared, and succeeded
in getting beyond the gorge without being seen by his pursuers;
but this delay had given them time to gain a great deal upon him,
and when he started their hurried tramp could be distinctly heard.</p>

<p>His words had roused Leslie to a sense of his peril. By struggling
and laboring for a few minutes he succeeded in disengaging himself
and managed to crawl beneath a projecting ridge of rock. This
effectually concealed him from sight, and had his pursuers no
suspicion of his fall, he yet stood a chance of escaping.</p>

<p>In a few moments he heard them overhead, and the pain of his
wounds was forgotten in the anxiety which he now felt for his
safety. He knew that they had hesitated, but whether it was on
account of the leap which they were required to make, or on account
of any suspicion that they might entertain, he could not divine.</p>

<p>The place in which he had fallen had probably once been swept
by a torrent, but now a tiny stream only warbled through it. The
murmur of this, by Leslie's side, prevented his understanding
the words of those above. The hum of their voices could be heard
but not their words.</p>

<p>Presently, however, he distinguished a well-known voice evidently
in expostulation with some one.</p>

<p>"Gorra mighty! does yer s'pects I can jump dat? It's bad 'nough
to make me git drownded in dat river without broken my neck down
dar!"</p>

<p>Leslie could not help wondering why Zeb was brought along, nor
how he managed to keep pace with the rest. But as he had not heard
his voice before, he concluded that the negro must have been brought
by several Indians who remained behind for that purpose. This
conclusion was confirmed by the words which he heard the next
minute.</p>

<p>"Whar's de use ob jumpin'? Dem yere fellers'll soon be back,
coz dey ain't agwine to cotch dat man nohow. He can run like a
streak o' sunshine, and likes as not dey'll all get shot. You'd
better go on and coax 'em to come back while I stay here and waits
fur ye."</p>

<p>In answer to this, Leslie heard some angry muttering and mumbling,
but could distinguish no words. In a moment, however, Zeb's voice
was audible.</p>

<p>"Bless yer, you're de all-firedest fools I eber see'd. How does
you s'pects I's gwine to light on toder side. Ef one of you'll
take me on your back, I won't mind lettin' you try to carry me
over; but I tells you I ain't agwine to try it. So you can shut
up yer rat-traps."</p>

<p>Hardly a second elapsed before he again spoke:</p>

<p>"Hold on dar; you kickin' all my brains out! I'll try it!"</p>

<p>The next moment Leslie heard a dull thump, and Zeb came rolling
down directly beside him.</p>

<p>"I's killed! Ebery bone is broken. I can't live anoder second."</p>

<p>"Zeb! Zeb!" whispered Leslie, in a hurried whisper.</p>

<p>The negro suddenly ceased his groaning and exclamations, and
rolling his head over toward him, asked, in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Who's dat?"</p>

<p>"It's I, Zeb. Get up quick, for God's sake, before they come
down, or I'm lost!"</p>

<p>The negro clambered to his feet without difficulty, and disappeared,
shouting to those above:</p>

<p>"I isn't hurt. It war de rock dat was broke by my head striking
it! How de pieces flewed!"</p>
