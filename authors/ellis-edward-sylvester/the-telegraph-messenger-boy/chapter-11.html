<p>The following is the message as first written out by the old
farmer:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Sally Jane Jones, Makeville,<br/>
&mdash;I take my pen in hand to<br/>
inform you that I arrived safely in Damietta this morning.<br/>
I have seen Jim, your brother. His baby is dead in love<br/>
with me, and they all join in sending their love to you. I<br/>
expect to eat my supper with Cousin Maria and sleep in<br/>
their house by the river. I will be home to-morrow<br/>
afternoon. Meet me at the station with the roan mare, if<br/>
she ain't too tired to draw the buggy.

</p>
<p>
"Your affectionate father,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Josiah A. Jones."

</p>

<p>When Ben Mayberry had explained how much could be saved by crossing
out the superfluous words in this message, while its main points
would be left, the farmer's anger turned to pleasure. He took
his pen, nodded several times, and turned smilingly to the desk,
where he stood for fully a quarter of an hour, groaning, writing,
and crossing out words. He labored as hard as before, and finally
held the paper off at arm's length and contemplated it admiringly
through his silver spectacles.</p>

<p>"Yes; that'll do," he said, nodding his head several times in
a pleased way; "that reads just the same&mdash;little abrupt, maybe,
but they'll git the hang of it, and it'll please Sally Jane, who
is a good darter. Here, young man, jist figger onto that, will
you, and let me know how much the expense is."</p>

<p>Ben took the paper, and under the labored manipulation of the
old farmer, he found it was changed in this amazing fashion:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I take my hand<br/>
&mdash;Damietta. Jim, your brother&mdash;the baby is<br/>
dead<br/>
&mdash;I expect to eat Cousin Maria, and sleep in the river<br/>
to-morrow afternoon&mdash;with the roan&mdash;if she ain't too<br/>
buggy. Your affectionate father,

</p>
<p>
"Josiah A. Jones."

</p>
</div>
<p>It was hard for Ben to suppress his laughter, but the farmer
was looking straight at him, and the boy would not hurt his feelings.
He surveyed the message a minute, and then said:</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can help you a little on this."</p>

<p>"You can try if you want to," grunted the old man; "but I don't
think you can improve much on that."</p>

<p>Under the skillful magic of the boy's pencil the telegram was
speedily boiled into this shape:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Met Jim&mdash;all well&mdash;meet me with roan to-morrow afternoon.

</p>
<p>
J. A. Jones."

</p>
</div>
<p>"There are ten words," explained Ben, "and that will cost you
twenty-five cents. Besides, it tells all that is necessary, and
will please your daughter just as much as if it were five times
as long."</p>

<p>Mr. Jones took it up again, held it up at arm's length and then
brought it closer to him, while he thoughtfully rubbed his chin
with the other hand.</p>

<p>"I s'pose that's right," he finally said, "but don't you think
you orter tell her I have arrived in Damietta?"</p>

<p>"She must know you have arrived here, or you couldn't send the
telegram to her."</p>

<p>"Umph! That's so; but hadn't I orter explain to her that the
Jim I met was her brother?"</p>

<p>"Is there any Jim you expect to see except your son?"</p>

<p>"No, that's so. I swan to gracious! But I thought it wasn't more'n
perlite ter tell her that Cousin Maria's baby is dead in love
with me."</p>

<p>"I am sure that every baby which sees you will fall in love with
you, and your daughter must be aware of that."</p>

<p>At this rather pointed compliment the farmer's face glowed like
a cider apple, and his smile seemed almost to reach to his ears.</p>

<p>"I swan; but you're a peart chap. What wages do you git?"</p>

<p>"Forty-five dollars a month."</p>

<p>"Well, you airn it, you jist bet; but I was goin' to say that
I orter speak of the roan mare, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Have you more than one horse that is of a roan color?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Then when you speak of the roan, they must know that you can
only mean the roan mare."</p>

<p>The old gentleman fairly beamed with pleasure, and reaching solemnly
down in his pockets, he fished out another silver quarter, which
he handed to Ben, saying:</p>

<p>"I like you; take it to please me."</p>

<p>"I thank you; I have been paid," replied Ben, pushing the coin
back from him.</p>

<p>"Confound it! Take this, then; won't you?"</p>

<p>As he spoke he banged down a large, red apple on the counter,
and looked almost savagely at Ben, as if daring him to refuse
it.</p>

<p>The boy did not decline, but picking it up, said:</p>

<p>"Thank you; I am very fond of apples. I will take this home and
share it with my mother."</p>

<p>"The next time I come to town I'll bring you a peck," and with
this hearty response the farmer stumped out of the door.</p>

<p>I had been much amused over this scene, especially when Ben showed
me the astonishing message the farmer had prepared to send his
daughter.</p>

<p>Ben laughed, too, after the old gentleman was beyond hearing.</p>

<p>"It's a pleasure to do a slight favor like that. I think I feel
better over it than Mr. Jones does himself."</p>

<p>"I think not," said I; "for it so happens that instead of that
gentleman being Farmer Jones, he is Mr. Musgrave, the district
superintendent, who took a fancy to find out whether his operators
are as kind and obliging as they should be, I am quite sure you
lost nothing that time by your courtesy and accommodating spirit."</p>
