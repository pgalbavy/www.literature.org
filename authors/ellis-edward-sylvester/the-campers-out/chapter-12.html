<p>Ethan Durrell may have been verdant-looking and peculiar in his
ways, but he was one of the pluckiest of men. It was impossible
for him to know whether the scamp who held up the stage had any
companions or not, until the matter was proven by taking a risk
which, if he went the wrong way, was sure to be fatal. With this
uncertainty, and without so much as a single weapon at his command,
he leaped upon the unsuspecting ruffian, and, throwing both arms
around his neck, bore him to the ground.</p>

<p>The attack was wholly unexpected by the fellow, who was standing
with loaded revolver pointed toward the stage, ready to fire on
the instant he observed anything suspicious. It was necessary
for the New Englander to spring down from the front of the coach,
but every one except himself thought his intention was to land
in front of the other and there submit to the inevitable. The
quavering voice of Durrell had convinced his friends that he was
as timid as any of them in the presence of real danger.</p>

<p>He closed his arms like a vise, so as to pinion those of the
stranger against his sides. The impetus of his own body drove
the man backward, and before he could recover Ethan tripped and
threw him with such violence that his hat fell off and an exclamation
was forced from him.</p>

<p>He uttered fierce execrations and strove desperately to get his
arm free that he might use his weapon on his assailant, but there
was no possibility of shaking off the embrace of the wiry New
Englander, who hung on like grim death.</p>

<p>"Bill, you and the boys watch out for the other fellers," called
Durrell, as he struggled with the man; "if any of them show themselves,
shoot! I’ll ’tend to this one."</p>

<p>At this moment the rogue seemed to remember his friends, and
he called:</p>

<p>[Illustration: IT’S NO <em>USE! I’VE GOT YOU</em>!]</p>

<p>"Quick, Sam! Shoot him! Don’t miss! Let him have it!"</p>

<p>Even in that excitement Ethan noticed that the fellow’s appeal
was to "Sam" instead of the imaginary "Dick," whom he first addressed.
The suspicion that he was alone was strengthened, and the daring
New Englander put forth all his power to subdue him.</p>

<p>"It’s no use! I’ve got you and I’m going for you like two houses
afire. Stand back, Bill, and don’t interfere; if I can’t bring
him to terms, then I’m going to resign and climb a tree."</p>

<p>Everything was going like a whirlwind. Although Bill Lenman preferred
on such occasions as the present to be a non-combatant, he was
not the one to stay idle when a friend risked his life for him.
He threw the lines over the horses’ backs and sprang down to give
what help he could; but in the darkness it was hard to decide
in what way he could aid the other. It was evident that Durrell
was pushing matters with vigor, and there was no doubt that he
expected to bring the rogue to terms.</p>

<p>But it was easy for one in Ethan’s situation to be mistaken.
As long as the fellow kept his pistol, the New Englander’s life
was in danger. Bill stooped over with the intention of twisting
away the weapon, but at the moment of doing so it was discharged,
apparently at the driver himself, for the bullet grazed his temple.</p>

<p>Finding himself unable to turn the pistol on his assailant, the
ruffian saw a chance of deflecting the muzzle sufficiently to
hit the new-comer, as he thought, and he fired, missing him by
the narrowest margin conceivable.</p>

<p>Before he could fire again a vigorous kick of the driver sent
the weapon flying off in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Keep your hands off!" called Durrell, the moment he discovered
his friend was near him; "I can manage him alone. If you want
to do anything get ready to tie him."</p>

<p>That was an easy matter, for stage-drivers are always supplied
with extras, and a little skill will enable one to get along without
a few straps already in use.</p>

<p>Durrell found his customer tough and powerful. He held him fast
for some seconds, but he seemed as tireless as his assailant,
and the contest would have been prolonged with the possibility
of the fellow working himself loose and darting off among the
trees; but fully mindful of this danger, the New Englander had
recourse to heroic measures.</p>

<p>He tightened his grip on the fellow’s throat until he gasped
for breath. This was repeated to the danger point, though the
man continued to struggle as long as he had the power.</p>

<p>But Durrell had no wish to punish him beyond what was necessary.
He now called to the driver that he could give some help if he
wished. Bill appeared to be bristling with straps and ropes, and
was eager to do something, for, truth to tell, he felt ashamed
that, after all he had said to the New Englander, the latter had
attacked the fellow so bravely, while until this moment the one
chiefly concerned had given no help at all. He was anxious to
make amends.</p>

<p>Reading the purpose of his captors and knowing that if bound
all help was at an end, the robber struggled like a wild cat.
He fought, kicked, struck, bit, and shouted to his friends to
come to his help, addressing them by names without number, but
all in vain; he could not have been more helpless if enclosed
by a regiment of men. Bill Lenman was skilled in tying knots,
and in less time than it would be supposed the prisoner was so
firmly bound that he resembled a mummy, so far as the use of his
limbs was concerned.</p>

<p>The moment came when he gave up in despair. He saw the game was
over, and it was throwing away his strength to resist further.
While he had been so ready with speech, he ceased all utterances
when the first knot was secured between his elbows, and resolutely
refused to utter another word.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with him?" asked Lenman, as they stood
him like a post on his feet.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do with him? why, take him to Piketon,
of course, and deliver him to justice!"</p>

<p>"I know that," replied Bill, with a laugh, "but I was thinking
whether it was best to stow him under the seats or strap him with
the trunks on behind; he might enjoy riding with <em>that</em>
box."</p>

<p>"No; we’ll take him inside with us; some of the straps might
give way and we would want to be within reach of him. Where’s
them boys?" asked Durrell, abruptly; "I forgot all about them
while this business was going on."</p>

<p>The attack and capture of the would-be stage robber consumed
very little time, but it gave a chance to our young friends which
they quickly turned to good account. They saw but one possible
result of the affair, and concluded to make a change of base.
It could not be doubted that they had done so, since neither was
within sight or call.</p>

<p>Lenman had paid no attention to them, and it cannot be said that
he regretted their absence. True, their fare remained uncollected,
but that was not the first time he had carried passengers free,
and he could stand it again.</p>

<p>The prisoner was deposited with as much care on the middle seat
of the stage as though he were a package of dynamite. Durrell
placed himself behind him where he could forestall any movement
on his part. It would not be supposed that there was any chance
of anything of that kind, but Durrell had read and heard enough
of such people to understand the danger of trusting to appearances.
The exploits of some of the gentry in the way of tying and untying
knots would rival the Davenport brothers and other so-called "mediums."
Then, too, Durrell thought, he might have other weapons about
him, for no search had been made of his garments. Anyway, it cannot
be doubted that the New Englander was wise in maintaining such
a vigilant watch of the fellow.</p>

<p>Despite this exciting incident, which threw Bill Lenman’s nerves
into a more turbulent state than for years, he could not help
smiling as he listened to the efforts of the New Englander to
open conversation with the prisoner. Durrell’s curiosity was of
the kind that it could not be kept in the background. He was interested
in the man and was resolved to learn more about him.</p>

<p>He began in his insinuating way to inquire as to his name, how
long he had been in this bad business, what led him to make such
a dreadful mistake, where he was born, whether his parents were
living, how many brothers and sisters he had, and so on with a
list of questions which no one could remember.</p>

<p>But the prisoner never once opened his mouth. He saw nothing
was to be gained by so doing, and, though it is not to be supposed
he would have told the truth, he did not trouble himself to state
fiction.</p>

<p>At the moment of emerging from Black Bear Swamp, Lenman was alarmed
by being hailed by a stranger who asked for a ride. This was unusual,
for he was now so close to Piketon that the walk would not have
taxed any one.</p>

<p>Durrell whispered to the driver to refuse to take him up, for
no doubt he was a confederate of the prisoner; but Lenman thought
it more dangerous to refuse than to comply. He therefore checked
his team, and told the applicant that the town was near by and
he was about to indulge in a needless expense; but the stranger
cared naught for that, and hastily climbed up in front and seated
himself beside the driver, who peered at him as best he could
in the gloom, but was unable to make out his features.</p>

<p>"If he tries any tricks," said Lenman to himself, "I’ll neck
him before he knows it; after that chap from New England showed
such pluck I aint going to back out of the next rumpus."</p>

<p>Evidently the driver felt the force of the example, for he kept
a close eye on the stranger. Besides this, he thought the occasion
warranted a little extra urging of the horses, and he put them
to the briskest trot they had shown since leaving Belmar.</p>

<p>Ethan Durrell, as may be supposed, was fully as anxious as the
driver, for he was almost certain the man in front was a friend
of the prisoner, and if so, there was little to prevent a rescue,
since, as I have shown, neither Durrell nor Lenman was armed.</p>

<p>The relief, therefore, was great when the lights of the little
town glimmered through the darkness, and shortly after the stage
came to a halt in front of the old-fashioned inn, where it had
stopped regularly for so many years.</p>

<p>The passenger last picked up, there was reason to believe, had
never seen the rogue before. The latter may be dismissed with
the remark that, having been caught in the commission of his crime,
he received full and merited punishment therefor.</p>
