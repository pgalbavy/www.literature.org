<p>John Ancrum Winslow&mdash;His Early Life and Training &mdash;The Famous
Battle Between the <em>Kearsarge</em> and <em>Alabama</em>.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I had as guests at my house two young men who
were graduates of the West Point Military Academy in 1889. One
was my son, at present an instructor in the Academy, and the other
was E. Eveleth Winslow, of the corps of engineers, who had the
honor of being graduated at the head of his class. During the
course of the conversation I asked Captain Winslow whether he
was a relative of the late Commodore John Ancrum Winslow, commander
of the <em>Kearsarge</em> in her famous fight with the <em>Alabama</em>.</p>

<p>"He was my grandfather," replied my friend, with a glow of pride.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant bit of information, but it made me realize
how the years are passing. It seems but a short time ago that
the country was electrified by the news of the great battle, off
Cherbourg, France, which sent to the bottom of the ocean the most
destructive cruiser the Southern Confederacy ever launched. And
here was the grandson of the hero of that fight, already thirty
years of age, with the hair on his crown growing scant. <em>Tempus
fugit</em> indeed.</p>

<p>The name Winslow is a distinguished one in the annals of our
country, and especially in Massachusetts, the State from which
Captain Winslow hails. He is the ninth generation from John Winslow,
brother of Edward Winslow, Governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony,
and the founder, as may be said, of Plymouth Rock itself. John
A. Winslow, the subject of this sketch, however, was a Southerner
by birth, being a native of Wilmington, North Carolina, where
he was born November 19, 1811. His mother belonged to the famous
Rhett family of the fiery State of South Carolina. The father
had gone to Wilmington from Boston, to establish a commercial
house, four years before the birth of the son, who was sent North
to be educated. At the age of sixteen he entered the navy, and
saw a good deal of dangerous service in the extirpation of the
West Indian pirates. The exciting experience was exactly to the
liking of young Winslow, whose life more than once was placed
in great peril.</p>

<p>After an extended cruise in the Pacific, he returned east in
1833, and was promoted to past midshipman. His service was of
an unimportant character for a number of years, the rank of lieutenant
coming to him in 1839. His conduct was so gallant in the war with
Mexico that he was publicly complimented by Commodore Matthew
C. Perry, a younger brother of the Lake Erie hero, and given the
choice of vessels belonging to the fleet.</p>

<p>A curious incident is mentioned by his biographer. He went with
the division which set out to capture Tampico, but the city surrendered
without a fight upon the approach of the boats. He remained several
weeks and then went back to the fleet at Vera Cruz. One of the
vessels had been capsized in a squall, and the captain was occupying
Winslow's room, and continued to share it until other arrangements
could be made. The name of this visitor was Raphael Semmes, afterward
the commander of the <em>Alabama</em>. The history of our navy
is full of such strange occurrences. When the furnace blast of
secession swept over the country, the most intimate friends&mdash;in
many cases brothers&mdash;became the deadliest of enemies. For a time
two flags were flung to the breeze in the United States, and the
men who fought under each were among the bravest of the brave,
for they were all <em>Americans</em>.</p>

<p>In 1855 Winslow was made a commander and was engaged in various
duties until the breaking out of the Civil War. He hurried to
Washington and applied for active service. Captain Foote was busy
fitting out a flotilla at St. Louis, and Winslow was sent to join
him. The work involved great labor and difficulty, and Winslow's
aid was invaluable, although far from congenial. The task of blazing
away at the guerrillas in the bushes and woods along shore, of
raking the muddy rivers and streams for torpedoes, and of managing
the awkward, nondescript craft, was not to the liking of the naval
officer, accustomed to the free air of the deep, blue ocean. Finally
his request to be transferred to sea service was granted, and
in the early part of 1863 he was placed in command of the <em>Kearsarge</em>.</p>

<p>This sloop of war had a crew of 163 men, carried two 11-inch
pivot guns, four short 32-pounders and one rifled 30-pounder,
the total shot weight of the seven guns being 430 pounds. In this
place it may be well to give the statistics of the <em>Alabama</em>,
since the two vessels were so intimately associated in history.
The Confederate cruiser carried one 100-pounder Blakely gun, one
8-inch shell gun and six long 32-pounders, the eight guns having
a total of 360 pounds shot weight, while the crew consisted of
149 men, of mixed nationalities, nearly all of them being Englishmen.</p>

<p>England at that time was less friendly to the United States than
she has since become, and she gave most unfair help to the Southern
Confederacy by aiding to fit out and man cruisers for it. When
the war was over she was compelled to pay a good round sum for
her dishonest course, and was taught a lesson she is not likely
soon to forget. These cruisers wrought immense havoc among our
shipping, and Commander Winslow was sent into European waters
in quest of them. He was specially anxious to meet the <em>Florida</em>,
and followed her from the coast of South America to that of England
and France. The governments of those two countries threw every
possible obstacle in his way. The French pilots were forbidden
to serve the <em>Kearsarge</em>, and Captain Winslow had to be
his own pilot&mdash;something he was well able to do because of his
familiarity with the coasts.</p>

<p>Finding the <em>Florida</em> in Brest, he blockaded the port.
It was in the depth of winter and the shore was dangerous, but
Winslow did his duty so well that the <em>Florida</em> dared not
poke her nose outside, until he was compelled, because of shortness
of provisions, to steam over to Cadiz to obtain them. He made
all haste to return, but when he arrived the <em>Florida</em>
had slipped out and was gone.</p>

<p>There was no telling to what part of the world she had fled,
and Captain Winslow sailed to Calais, where he learned that the
rebel <em>Rappahannock</em> was awaiting a chance to put to sea.
He held her there for two months, when a French pilot purposely
ran the <em>Kearsarge</em> into the piers along shore. It was
done by prearrangement with the officers of the <em>Rappahannock</em>,
in order to give the latter a chance to put to sea. The indignant
Winslow drove all the French pilots off his ship, and by vigorous
work got her off by daylight the next morning. Meanwhile the <em>Rappahannock</em>,
which had greatly overstayed her time, was ordered by the French
authorities to leave. Winslow heard of this, and, without waiting
for some of his men and officers who were on shore, he moved out
of the harbor. When the commander of the <em>Rappahannock</em>
saw the <em>Kearsarge</em> once more off the port of Calais, he
knew it was all up and dismantled his ship.</p>

<p>There was one Confederate scourge that had been roaming the seas
for months which Captain Winslow was anxious, above all others,
to meet; that was the <em>Alabama</em>, commanded by his former
room-mate, Captain Raphael Semmes. The <em>Kearsarge</em>, like
many other vessels of the United States, had been hunting here
and there for the ocean pest, but it seemed impossible to bring
her to bay.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, June 12, 1864, the <em>Kearsarge</em> was
lying off the town of Flushing, Holland, with many of the officers
and men ashore, and with everything wearing the appearance of
a protracted rest for the crew. Some hours later, however, a gun
was fired as a signal for every member of the ship's company to
come aboard at once. The cause of this sudden awaking was a telegram
from Minister William L. Dayton, at Paris, notifying Captain Winslow
that the <em>Alabama</em> had arrived at Cherbourg. On Tuesday,
Winslow appeared off the fort, and saw the cruiser within, with
her Stars and Bars floating defiantly in the breeze. Had Captain
Winslow followed, he would have been compelled by law to remain
twenty-four hours after the departure of the <em>Alabama</em>,
so he took a station outside, determined that the cruiser should
not escape him again.</p>

<p>In this case, however, the precaution was unnecessary, for Semmes
had made up his mind to fight the National vessel. He had been
charged with cowardice in running away from armed ships, and he
had destroyed and captured so many helpless merchantmen that he
felt something was due to retrieve his reputation. A comparison
of the crews and armaments of the <em>Kearsarge</em> and <em>Alabama</em>
will show that they were pretty evenly matched, though the slight
numerical superiority of the Union ship was emphasized by the
fact that her men were almost wholly American, while those of
Semmes, as already stated, were nearly all English.</p>

<p>Shortly after the arrival of Captain Winslow the following challenge
was brought out to him:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Confederate Steamer <em>Alabama</em>,<br/>
Cherbourg, June 14, 1864.

</p>
<p>
Sir:<br/>
&mdash;I hear that you were informed by the United States<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consul that the <em>Kearsarge</em> was to come to this port solely for the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prisoners landed by me, and that she was to depart in twenty-four<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hours. I desire you to say to the United States Consul that my<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intention is to fight the <em>Kearsarge</em> as soon as I can make the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary arrangements. I hope these will not detain me more than<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;till to-morrow evening, or next morning, at the farthest. I beg she<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will not depart before I am ready to go out.

</p>
<p>
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant

</p>
<p>
R. Semmes, <em>Captain</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>This note, though couched in seemingly courteous language, contained
the most aggravating sort of sting, in the hope expressed that
the <em>Kearsarge</em> would not leave until the <em>Alabama</em>
was ready to go out, and the intimation&mdash;undoubtedly false&mdash;that
the sole business of the Union vessel was to take charge of the
prisoners brought thither by the Confederate. Captain Winslow
had not spent months in hunting over the globe for such a chance
as this to let it slip.</p>

<p>The <em>Alabama</em> was among friends. She had the sympathies
of the thousands, who hoped to see the Yankee ship sunk by the
fearful commerce-destroyer. Excursion trains were run from Paris
and other points to Cherbourg, and among the vast multitude who
gathered on shore on that warm, hazy Sunday morning &mdash;June
19&mdash;to witness the coming battle, it may be doubted whether there
were a score who wished to see the <em>Kearsarge</em> win.</p>

<p>The respective captains were brave men and good officers. Both
had declared that, if they ever met, the battle would not end
until one of the ships went to the bottom, and each knew that
the other would keep his word. Such a thing as surrender was not
thought of by either.</p>

<p>Semmes was confident of his ability to sink the <em>Kearsarge</em>.
Being a Roman Catholic, and unable to attend service, he requested
a friend to go to mass and have it offered up for him, which was
done. His accumulated sixty chronometers were sent ashore, and
the motto displayed by his ship was "<em>Aide toi et Dieu t'aidera</em>,"
meaning, "Help yourself and God will help you," another version
of the old adage, "God helps them that help themselves."</p>

<p>The church chimes were sending out their mellow notes on the
warm summer air when the <em>Alabama</em> began slowly steaming
out of the harbor. She was cheered by the sympathetic thousands,
who heard the drums beating to quarters, and fervently prayed
that their favorite might return victorious.</p>

<p>Winslow neglected nothing in the way of preparation. While calmly
confident, his experience had taught him that such a contest is
often decided by a chance shot, and he knew that the doom of one
of the ships would be sealed before the set of sun. Having done
all he could, he committed everything to the God of battles, content
to abide by His will, whatever it might be.</p>

<p>It was about ten o'clock that Winslow, with his glass pointed
toward shore, saw the head of the <em>Alabama</em> coming round
the point of the mole, some three miles distant. He immediately
beat to quarters. The <em>Couronne</em> accompanied the <em>Alabama</em>
to the limits of French waters, and then turned back. The English
yacht <em>Deerhound</em> had hurried down from Caen, upon being
telegraphed of the impending fight, and the owner, with his family
on board, followed the <em>Alabama</em> at the risk of receiving
a stray shot that would wind up the career of the pleasure craft
and all on board.</p>

<p>Some time before Captain Winslow had arranged his sheet chains
for a distance of fifty feet amidships and over the side of his
vessel, extending six feet down. They were intended as an additional
protection to his machinery, and the practice is common among
warships. The chains were secured by marline to eyebolts protected
with one-inch boards. This natural precaution was the foundation
for Captain Semmes' charge that the <em>Kearsarge</em> was partly
armored. During the fight this part of the ship was hit only twice,
so that the protection, if it be considered such, bore an unimportant
part in the battle itself.</p>

<p>Captain Winslow was determined that no question about neutral
waters should be raised. Accordingly, as the <em>Alabama</em>
approached, he steamed out to sea, as if running away from his
antagonist. Another object he had in mind was to prevent the <em>Alabama</em>,
in case she was crippled, from escaping by running into the harbor.</p>

<p>When the <em>Kearsarge</em> had reached a point some seven miles
from land, she swung around and made directly for the <em>Alabama</em>,
although such a course exposed her to the raking broadsides of
the enemy. Reading his purpose, Semmes slowed his engines and
sheered off, thus presenting his starboard battery to the <em>Kearsarge</em>.
When the vessels were about a mile apart, the jets of fire and
smoke from the side of the <em>Alabama</em>, followed by the reverberating
boom of her cannon, showed that she had fired her first broadside.
It did only trifling damage to the rigging of the <em>Kearsarge</em>.
A second and part of a third broadside were delivered, with no
perceptible effect. All the time, under a full head of steam,
Winslow was rushing toward his enemy for the death grapple. Still
in peril of being raked, he now sheered when half a mile distant
and fired his broadside of five-second shells, at the same time
endeavoring to pass under the <em>Alabama's</em> stern, but Semmes
defeated the manoeuvre by also sheering his vessel. The effort
of each was now to keep his starboard broadside presented to the
other, the attempt causing the two ships to describe an immense
circle, the diameter of which steadily decreased, until it was
barely a third of a mile.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after the opening of the battle the spanker gaff
of the <em>Alabama</em> and the ensign were brought down by the
fire of the <em>Kearsarge</em>, whose crew burst into cheers,
but the Confederates quickly hoisted the colors to their mizzen.
When the two ships were within a third of a mile of each other
the fire became terrible; but from the first that of the <em>Kearsarge</em>
was more accurate and did vast damage. This was impressively shown
by the fact that although the <em>Kearsarge</em> fired only 173
shots during the fight, nearly every one struck the <em>Alabama</em>,
which fired 370, of which only 28 landed.</p>

<p>One of the <em>Alabama's</em> 60-pound Blakely shells passed
through the bulwarks of the <em>Kearsarge</em>, and, bursting
on the quarter deck, wounded three men, of whom William Gowin
was mortally hurt. When carried to the surgeon, the intensely
suffering man smiled. "We are whipping the <em>Alabama</em>,"
he said, "and I am willing to give my life for such a victory."</p>

<p>Another Confederate shell burst in the hammock nettings and started
a fire, which was easily extinguished. A third lodged in the sternpost,
but failed to explode. Had it done so, its effect would have been
terrific. The damage done by the other shells was insignificant.</p>

<p>A far different story was told on the Confederate cruiser. Winslow's
instructions to his gunners were to fire slowly and to make every
shot tell, and they did so. The men on the <em>Alabama</em> stripped
to their shirts and drawers and fired rapidly, as if the only
thing to do was to work the guns without taking pause to aim.
Crashing planks and timber and exploding shells seemed to be all
about them. A single shot from the <em>Kearsarge</em> killed and
wounded eighteen men and disabled a gun. Another burst in the
coal bunks and cluttered up the engine room. Death and destruction
raged on every hand, and still the terrible <em>Kearsarge</em>
kept working nearer, the dearest wish of Winslow being to get
to close quarters.</p>

<p>The ships had described seven circles about each other and were
starting on the eighth, when Winslow, all alive and eagerness,
saw the <em>Alabama</em> set her fore trysail and two jibs and
start for shore. That meant that it was all up with her, and her
captain's only hope now was to get into the harbor of Cherbourg.
Winslow ran across her bow and was on the point of raking her,
when the <em>Alabama's</em> flag came down. Uncertain whether
this was an accident, and suspecting a ruse by which the enemy
expected to reach shore, now only two miles off, Winslow stopped
firing, but held himself ready to open again. A white flag was
displayed, and he began preparations to render assistance to his
defeated antagonist. Just then, however, the <em>Alabama</em>
fired again, upon which Winslow answered with several shots, when
the white flag was run up for the second time.</p>

<p>The doom of the <em>Alabama</em> had overtaken her at last. She
was fast settling, and while the only two serviceable boats of
the <em>Kearsarge</em> were hurrying to the relief of the crew,
the famous cruiser threw her prow high in air and slid stern foremost
into the depths of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>In the midst of the wild confusion a boat from the <em>Alabama</em>,
under charge of the English master's mate, came alongside, announcing
that the <em>Alabama</em> had surrendered and begging for help.
On the promise of this man to return, Winslow allowed him to go
back to the aid of the drowning crew, but instead of keeping his
pledge, he took refuge on the yacht <em>Deerhound</em>, which
was circling about and doing all it could for the struggling wretches
in the water. Among those picked up was Captain Semmes, who had
flung his sword into the sea and leaped overboard as his ship
was going down. He was suffering from a painful wound in the hand,
and when helped on board of the <em>Deerhound</em> was in an exhausted
condition. The captain of the yacht, after picking up thirty-nine
men, including a number of officers, instead of delivering them
to Captain Winslow, as he was in honor bound to do, edged away
from the scene, and, putting on all steam, did not pause until
he reached Southampton. The <em>Kearsarge</em> picked up the men
that remained and took them into Cherbourg.</p>

<p>In this famous battle the <em>Kearsarge</em> had only 1 killed
and 2 wounded, while Semmes lost 40 killed and 70 taken prisoners.
The Confederate commander and his sympathizing British friends
offered all sorts of excuses for his defeat. Some of them were
ingenious, but none was the true one. The cause of the sinking
of the <em>Alabama</em> was the same as that which gave us so
many wonderful naval victories in the War of 1812. Our vessels
were manned by Americans, while the <em>Alabama</em> was really
an English ship, armed with English guns and manned and fought
by an English crew: there's the truth in a nutshell.</p>

<p>Captain Winslow received the promotion to the grade of a commodore
which he had so gallantly won. He died in 1873. It was a source
of regret throughout the country that on the night of February
2, 1894, the <em>Kearsarge</em> was wrecked off Roncador Reef,
while on a voyage from Port-au-Prince, Hayti, to Bluefields, Nicaragua.
None of her crew was drowned, but the vessel itself was lost,
despite every effort to save her.</p>
