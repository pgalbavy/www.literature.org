<p>Mary was the picture of a lady flustered. She stood with one
hand closing the gate behind her, and she had turned to go in
the direction Bibbs was walking. There appeared to be nothing
for it but that they should walk together, at least as far as
the New House. But Bibbs had paused in his slow stride, and there
elapsed an instant before either spoke or moved&mdash;it was no longer
than that, and yet it sufficed for each to seem to say, by look
and attitude, "Why, it's <em>YOU</em>!"</p>

<p>Then they both spoke at once, each hurriedly pronouncing the
other's name as if about to deliver a message of importance. Then
both came to a stop simultaneously, but Bibbs made a heroic effort,
and as they began to walk on together he contrived to find his
voice.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>hate a frozen fish myself," he said. "I
think three miles was too long for you to put up with one."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" she cried, turning to him a glowing face from
which restraint and embarrassment had suddenly fled. "Mr. Sheridan,
you're lovely to put it that way. But it's always the girl's place
to say it's turning cooler! I ought to have been the one to show
that we didn't know each other well enough not to say <em>SOMETHING!
</em>It was an imposition for me to have made you bring me home,
and after I went into the house I decided I should have walked.
Besides, it wasn't three miles to the car-line. I never thought
of it!"</p>

<p>"No," said Bibbs, earnestly. "I didn't, either. I might have
said something if I'd thought of anything. I'm talking now, though;
I must remember that, and not worry about it later. I think I'm
talking, though it doesn't sound intelligent even to me. I made
up my mind that if I ever met you again I'd turn on my voice and
keep it going, no mater what it said. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>She interrupted him with laughter, and Mary Vertrees's laugh
was one which Bibbs's father had declared, after the house-warming,
"a cripple would crawl five miles to hear." And at the merry lilting
of it Bibbs's father's son took heart to forget some of his trepidation.
"I'll be any kind of idiot," he said, "if you'll laugh at me some
more. It won't be difficult for me."</p>

<p>She did; and Bibbs's cheeks showed a little actual color, which
Mary perceived. It recalled to her, by contrast, her careless
and irritated description of him to her mother just after she
had seen him for the first time. "Rather tragic and altogether
impossible." It seemed to her now that she must have been blind.</p>

<p>They had passed the New House without either of them showing&mdash;or
possessing&mdash;any consciousness that it had been the destination
of one of them.</p>

<p>"I'll keep on talking," Bibbs continued, cheerfully, "and you
keep on laughing. I'm amounting to something in the world this
afternoon. I'm making a noise, and that makes you make music.
Don't be bothered by my bleating out such things as that. I'm
really frightened, and that makes me bleat anything. I'm frightened
about two things: I'm afraid of what I'll think of myself later
if I don't keep talking&mdash;talking now, I mean&mdash;and I'm afraid of
what I'll think of myself if I do. And besides these two things,
I'm frightened, anyhow. I don't remember talking as much as this
more than once or twice in my life. I suppose it was always in
me to do it, though, the first time I met any one who didn't know
me well enough not to listen."</p>

<p>"But you're not really talking to me," said Mary. "You're just
thinking aloud."</p>

<p>"No," he returned, gravely. "I'm not thinking at all; I'm only
making vocal sounds because I believe it's more mannerly. I seem
to be the subject of what little meaning they possess, and I'd
like to change it, but I don't know how. I haven't any experience
in talking, and I don't know how to manage it."</p>

<p>"You needn't change the subject on my account, Mr. Sheridan,"
she said. "Not even if you really talked about yourself." She
turned her face toward him as she spoke, and Bibbs caught his
breath; he was pathetically amazed by the look she gave him. It
was a glowing look, warmly friendly and understanding, and, what
almost shocked him, it was an eagerly interested look. Bibbs was
not accustomed to anything like that.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>you&mdash;I &mdash;I'm&mdash;" he stammered, and the faint
color in his cheeks grew almost vivid.</p>

<p>She was still looking at him, and she saw the strange radiance
that came into his face. There was something about him, too, that
explained how "queer" many people might think him; but he did
not seem "queer" to Mary Vertrees; he seemed the most quaintly
natural person she had ever met.</p>

<p>He waited, and became coherent. "<em>YOU </em>say something now,"
he said. "I don't even belong in the chorus, and here I am, trying
to sing the funny man's solo! You&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," she interrupted. "I'd rather play your accompaniment."</p>

<p>"I'll stop and listen to it, then."</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;" she began, but after pausing thoughtfully she made
a gesture with her muff, indicating a large brick church which
they were approaching. "Do you see that church, Mr. Sheridan?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I could," he answered in simple truthfulness, looking
at her. "But I don't want to. Once, when I was ill, the nurse
told me I'd better say anything that was on my mind, and I got
the habit. The other reason I don't want to see the church is
that I have a feeling it's where you're going, and where I'll
be sent back."</p>

<p>She shook her head in cheery negation. "Not unless you want to
be. Would you like to come with me?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;yes," he said. "Anywhere!" And again it was apparent
that he spoke in simple truthfulness.</p>

<p>"Then come&mdash;if you care for organ music. The organist is an old
friend of mine, and sometimes he plays for me. He's a dear old
man. He had a degree from Bonn, and was a professor afterward,
but he gave up everything for music. That's he, waiting in the
doorway. He looks like Beethoven, doesn't he? I think he knows
that, perhaps and enjoys it a little. I hope so."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bibbs, as they reached the church steps. "I think
Beethoven would like it, too. It must be pleasant to look like
other people."</p>

<p>"I haven't kept you?" Mary said to the organist.</p>

<p>"No, no," he answered, heartily. "I would not mind so only you
should shooer come!"</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Kraft. He has come to listen with
me."</p>

<p>The organist looked bluntly surprised. "Iss that SO?" he exclaimed.
"Well, I am glad if you wish him, and if he can stant my liddle
playink. He iss musician himself, then, of course."</p>

<p>"No," said Bibbs, as the three entered the church together. "I
&mdash;I played the &mdash;I tried to play&mdash;" Fortunately he checked
himself; he had been about to offer the information that he had
failed to master the jews'-harp in his boyhood. "No, I'm not a
musician," he contented himself with saying.</p>

<p>"What?" Dr. Kraft's surprise increased. "Young man, you are fortunate!
I play for Miss Vertrees; she comes always alone. You are the
first. You are the first one <em>EVER</em>!"</p>

<p>They had reached the head of the central aisle, and as the organist
finished speaking Bibbs stopped short, turning to look at Mary
Vertrees in a dazed way that was not of her perceiving; for, though
she stopped as he did, her gaze followed the organist, who was
walking away from them toward the front of the church, shaking
his white Beethovian mane roguishly.</p>

<p>"It's false pretenses on my part," Bibbs said. "You mean to be
kind to the sick, but I'm not an invalid any more. I'm so well
I'm going back to work in a few days. I'd better leave before
he begins to play, hadn't I?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mary, beginning to walk forward. "Not unless you don't
like great music."</p>

<p>He followed her to a seat about half-way up the aisle while Dr.
Kraft ascended to the organ. It was an enormous one, the procession
of pipes ranging from long, starveling whistles to thundering
fat guns; they covered all the rear wall of the church, and the
organist's figure, reaching its high perch, looked like that of
some Lilliputian magician ludicrously daring the attempt to control
a monster certain to overwhelm him.</p>

<p>"This afternoon some Handel!" he turned to shout.</p>

<p>Mary nodded. "Will you like that?" she asked Bibbs.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I never heard any except 'Largo.' I don't know
anything about music. I don't even know how to pretend I do. If
I knew enough to pretend, I would."</p>

<p>"No," said Mary, looking at him and smiling faintly, "you wouldn't."</p>

<p>She turned away as a great sound began to swim and tremble in
the air; the huge empty space of the church filled with it, and
the two people listening filled with it; the universe seemed to
fill and thrill with it. The two sat intensely still, the great
sound all round about them, while the church grew dusky, and only
the organist's lamp made a tiny star of light. His white head
moved from side to side beneath it rhythmically, or lunged and
recovered with the fierceness of a duelist thrusting, but he was
magnificently the master of his giant, and it sang to his magic
as he bade it.</p>

<p>Bibbs was swept away upon that mighty singing. Such a thing was
wholly unknown to him; there had been no music in his meager life.
Unlike the tale, it was the Princess Bedrulbudour who had brought
him to the enchanted cave, and that&mdash;for Bibbs&mdash;was what made
its magic dazing. It seemed to him a long, long time since he
had been walking home drearily from Dr. Gurney's office; it seemed
to him that he had set out upon a happy journey since then, and
that he had reached another planet, where Mary Vertrees and he
sat alone together listening to a vast choiring of invisible soldiers
and holy angels. There were armies of voices about them singing
praise and thanksgiving; and yet they were alone. It was incredible
that the walls of the church were not the boundaries of the universe,
to remain so for ever; incredible that there was a smoky street
just yonder, where housemaids were bringing in evening papers
from front steps and where children were taking their last spins
on roller-skates before being haled indoors for dinner.</p>

<p>He had a curious sense of communication with his new friend.
He knew it could not be so, and yet he felt as if all the time
he spoke to her, saying: "You hear this strain? You hear that
strain? You know the dream that these sounds bring to me?" And
it seemed to him as though she answered continually: "I hear!
I hear that strain, and I hear the new one that you are hearing
now. I know the dream that these sounds bring to you. Yes, yes,
I hear it all! We hear&mdash;together!"</p>

<p>And though the church grew so dim that all was mysterious shadow
except the vague planes of the windows and the organist's light,
with the white head moving beneath it, Bibbs had no consciousness
that the girl sitting beside him had grown shadowy; he seemed
to see her as plainly as ever in the darkness, though he did not
look at her. And all the mighty chanting of the organ's multitudinous
voices that afternoon seemed to Bibbs to be chorusing of her and
interpreting her, singing her thoughts and singing for him the
world of humble gratitude that was in his heart because she was
so kind to him. It all meant Mary.</p>
