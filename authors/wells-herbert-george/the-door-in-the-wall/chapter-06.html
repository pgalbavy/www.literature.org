Some business had detained me in Chancery Lane nine in the
evening, and thereafter, having some inkling of a headache, I was
disinclined either for entertainment or further work.  So much of
the sky as the high cliffs of that narrow canon of traffic left
visible spoke of a serene night, and I determined to make my way
down to the Embankment, and rest my eyes and cool my head by
watching the variegated lights upon the river.  Beyond comparison
the night is the best time for this place; a merciful darkness
hides the dirt of the waters, and the lights of this transitional
age, red glaring orange, gas-yellow, and electric white, are set in
shadowy outlines of every possible shade between grey and deep
purple.  Through the arches of Waterloo Bridge a hundred points of
light mark the sweep of the Embankment, and above its parapet rise
the towers of Westminster,warm grey against the starlight.  The
black river goes by with only a rare ripple breaking its silence,
and disturbing the reflections of the lights that swim upon its
surface.
<P>
"A warm night," said a voice at my side.
<P>
I turned my head, and saw the profile of a man who was leaning
over the parapet beside me.  It was a refined face, not unhandsome,
though pinched and pale enough, and the coat collar turned up and
pinned round the throat marked his status in life as sharply as a
uniform.  I felt I was committed to the price of a bed and
breakfast if I answered him.
<P>
I looked at him curiously.  Would he have anything to tell me
worth the money, or was he the common incapable--incapable even of
telling his own story?  There was a quality of intelligence in his
forehead and eyes, and a certain tremulousness in his nether lip
that decided me.
<P>
"Very warm," said I; "but not too warm for us here."
<P>
"No," he said, still looking across the water, "it is pleasant
enough here . . . . just now."
<P>
"It is good," he continued after a pause, "to find anything so
restful as this in London.  After one has been fretting about
business all day, about getting on, meeting obligations, and
parrying dangers, I do not know what one would do if it were not
for such pacific corners."  He spoke with long pauses between the
sentences.  "You must know a little of the irksome labour of the
world, or you would not be here.  But I doubt if you can be so
brain-weary and footsore as I am . . . . Bah!  Sometimes I doubt if
the game is worth the candle.  I feel inclined to throw the whole
thing over--name, wealth and position--and take to some modest
trade.  But I know if I abandoned my ambition--hardly as she uses
me--I should have nothing but remorse left for the rest of my
days."
<P>
He became silent.  I looked at him in astonishment.  If ever
I saw a man hopelessly hard-up it was the man in front of me.  He
was ragged and he was dirty, unshaven and unkempt; he looked as
though he had been left in a dust-bin for a week.  And he was
talking to ME of the irksome worries of a large business. 
I almost laughed outright.  Either he was mad or playing a sorry
jest on his own poverty.
<P>
"If high aims and high positions," said I, "have their
drawbacks of hard work and anxiety, they have their compensations. 
Influence, the power of doing good, of assisting those weaker and
poorer than ourselves; and there is even a certain gratification in
display . . . . . "
<P>
My banter under the circumstances was in very vile taste.  I
spoke on the spur of the contrast of his appearance and speech.  I
was sorry even while I was speaking.
<P>
He turned a haggard but very composed face upon me.  Said he:
"I forgot myself.  Of course you would not understand."
<P>
He measured me for a moment.  "No doubt it is very absurd. 
You will not believe me even when I tell you, so that it is fairly
safe to tell you.  And it will be a comfort to tell someone.  I
really have a big business in hand, a very big business.  But there
are troubles just now.  The fact is . . . . I make diamonds."
<P>
"I suppose," said I, "you are out of work just at present?"
<P>
"I am sick of being disbelieved," he said impatiently, and
suddenly unbuttoning his wretched coat he pulled out a little
canvas bag that was hanging by a cord round his neck.  From this he
produced a brown pebble.  "I wonder if you know enough to know what
that is?"  He handed it to me.
<P>
Now, a year or so ago, I had occupied my leisure in taking a
London science degree, so that I have a smattering of physics and
mineralogy.  The thing was not unlike an uncut diamond of the
darker sort, though far too large, being almost as big as the top
of my thumb.  I took it, and saw it had the form of a regular
octahedron, with the curved faces peculiar to the most precious of
minerals.  I took out my penknife and tried to scratch it--vainly. 
Leaning forward towards the gas-lamp, I tried the thing on my
watch-glass, and scored a white line across that with the greatest
ease.
<P>
I looked at my interlocutor with rising curiosity.  "It
certainly is rather like a diamond.  But, if so, it is a Behemoth
of diamonds.  Where did you get it?"
<P>
"I tell you I made it," he said.  "Give it back to me."
<P>
He replaced it hastily and buttoned his jacket.  "I will sell
it you for one hundred pounds," he suddenly whispered eagerly. 
With that my suspicions returned.  The thing might, after all, be
merely a lump of that almost equally hard substance, corundum, with
an accidental resemblance in shape to the diamond.  Or if it was a
diamond, how came he by it, and why should he offer it at a hundred
pounds?
<P>
We looked into one another's eyes.  He seemed eager, but
honestly eager.  At that moment I believed it was a diamond he was
trying to sell.  Yet I am a poor man, a hundred pounds would leave
a visible gap in my fortunes and no sane man would buy a diamond by
gaslight from a ragged tramp on his personal warranty only.  Still,
a diamond that size conjured up a vision of many thousands of
pounds.  Then, thought I, such a stone could scarcely exist without
being mentioned in every book on gems, and again I called to mind
the stories of contraband and light-fingered Kaffirs at the Cape. 
I put the question of purchase on one side.
<P>
"How did you get it?" said I.
<P>
"I made it."
<P>
I had heard something of Moissan, but I knew his artificial
diamonds were very small.  I shook my head.
<P>
"You seem to know something of this kind of thing.  I will
tell you a little about myself.  Perhaps then you may think better
of the purchase."  He turned round with his back to the river, and
put his hands in his pockets.  He sighed.  "I know you will not
believe me."
<P>
"Diamonds," he began--and as he spoke his voice lost its faint
flavour of the tramp and assumed something of the easy tone of an
educated man--are to be made by throwing carbon out of combination
in a suitable flux and under a suitable pressure; the carbon
crystallises out, not as black-lead or charcoal-powder, but as
small diamonds.  So much has been known to chemists for years, but
no one yet had hit upon exactly the right flux in which to melt up
the carbon, or exactly the right pressure for the best results. 
Consequently the diamonds made by chemists are small and dark,
and worthless as jewels.  Now I, you know, have given up my life to
this problem--given my life to it.
<P>
"I began to work at the conditions of diamond making when I
was seventeen, and now I am thirty-two.  It seemed to me that it
might take all the thought and energies of a man for ten years, or
twenty years, but, even if it did, the game was still worth the
candle.  Suppose one to have at last just hit the right trick
before the secret got out and diamonds became as common as coal,
one might realize millions.  Millions!"
<P>
He paused and looked for my sympathy.  His eyes shone
hungrily.  "To think," said he, "that I am on the verge of it all,
and here!
<P>
"I had," he proceeded, "about a thousand pounds when I was
twenty-one, and this, I thought, eked out by a little teaching,
would keep my researches going.  A year or two was spent in study,
at Berlin chiefly, and then I continued on my own account.  The
trouble was the secrecy.  You see, if once I had let out what I was
doing, other men might have been spurred on by my belief in the
practicability of the idea; and I do not pretend to be such a
genius as to have been sure of coming in first, in the case of a
race for the discovery.  And you see it was important that if I
really meant to make a pile, people should not know it was an
artificial process and capable of turning out diamonds by the ton. 
So I had to work all alone.  At first I had a little laboratory,
but as my resources began to run out I had to conduct my
experiments in a wretched unfurnished room in Kentish Town, where
I slept at last on a straw mattress on the floor among all my
apparatus.  The money simply flowed away.  I grudged myself
everything except scientific appliances.  I tried to keep things
going by a little teaching, but I am not a very good teacher, and
I have no university degree, nor very much education except in
chemistry, and I found I had to give a lot of time and labour for
precious little money.  But I got nearer and nearer the thing. 
Three years ago I settled the problem of the composition of the
flux, and got near the pressure by putting this flux of mine and a
certain carbon composition into a closed-up gun-barrel, filling up
with water, sealing tightly, and heating."
<P>
He paused.
<P>
"Rather risky," said I.
<P>
"Yes.  It burst, and smashed all my windows and a lot of my
apparatus; but I got a kind of diamond powder nevertheless. 
Following out the problem of getting a big pressure upon the molten
mixture from which the things were to crystallise, I hit upon some
researches of Daubree's at the Paris Laboratorie des Poudres et
Salpetres.  He exploded dynamite in a tightly screwed steel
cylinder, too strong to burst, and I found he could crush rocks
into a muck not unlike the South African bed in which diamonds are
found.  It was a tremendous strain on my resources, but I got a
steel cylinder made for my purpose after his pattern.  I put in all
my stuff and my explosives, built up a fire in my furnace, put the
whole concern in, and--went out for a walk."
<P>
I could not help laughing at his matter-of-fact manner.  "Did
you not think it would blow up the house?  Were there other people
in the place?"
<P>
"It was in the interest of science," he said, ultimately. 
"There was a costermonger family on the floor below, a
begging-letter writer in the room behind mine, and two flower-women
were upstairs.  Perhaps it was a bit thoughtless.  But possibly
some of them were out.
<P>
"When I came back the thing was just where I left it, among
the white-hot coals.  The explosive hadn't burst the case.  And
then I had a problem to face.  You know time is an important
element in crystallisation.  If you hurry the process the crystals
are small--it is only by prolonged standing that they grow to any
size.  I resolved to let this apparatus cool for two years, letting
the temperature go down slowly during the time.  And I was now
quite out of money; and with a big fire and the rent of my room, as
well as my hunger to satisfy, I had scarcely a penny in the world.
<P>
"I can hardly tell you all the shifts I was put to while I was
making the diamonds.  I have sold newspapers, held horses, opened
cab-doors.  For many weeks I addressed envelopes.  I had a place as
assistant to a man who owned a barrow, and used to call down one
side of the road while he called down the other.
<P>
"Once for a week I had absolutely nothing to do, and I begged. 
What a week that was!  One day the fire was going out and I had
eaten nothing all day, and a little chap taking his girl out, gave
me sixpence--to show off.  Thank heaven for vanity!  How the
fish-shops smelt!  But I went and spent it all on coals, and had
the furnace bright red again, and then--Well, hunger makes a fool
of a man.
<P>
"At last, three weeks ago, I let the fire out.  I took my
cylinder and unscrewed it while it was still so hot that it
punished my hands, and I scraped out the crumbling lava-like mass
with a chisel, and hammered it into a powder upon an iron plate. 
And I found three big diamonds and five small ones.  As I sat on
the floor hammering, my door opened, and my neighbour, the
begging-letter writer came in.  He was drunk--as he usually is. 
"'Nerchist,' said he.  'You're drunk,' said I. ''Structive
scoundrel,' said he.  'Go to your father,' said I, meaning the
Father of Lies.  'Never you mind,' said he, and gave me a cunning
wink, and hiccuped, and leaning up against the door, with his other
eye against the door-post, began to babble of how he had been
prying in my room, and how he had gone to the police that morning,
and how they had taken down everything he had to say--''siffiwas
a ge'm,' said he.  Then I suddenly realised I was in a hole. 
Either I should have to tell these police my little secret, and get
the whole thing blown upon, or be lagged as an Anarchist.  So I
went up to my neighbour and took him by the collar, and rolled him
about a bit, and then I gathered up my diamonds and cleared out. 
The evening newspapers called my den the Kentish Town Bomb Factory. 
And now I cannot part with the things for love or money.
<P>
"If I go in to respectable jewellers they ask me to wait, and
go and whisper to a clerk to fetch a policeman, and then I say I
cannot wait.  And I found out a receiver of stolen goods, and he
simply stuck to the one I gave him and told me to prosecute if I
wanted it back.  I am going about now with several hundred thousand
pounds-worth of diamonds round my neck, and without either food or
shelter.  You are the first person I have taken into my confidence. 
But I like your face and I am hard-driven."
<P>
He looked into my eyes.
<P>
"It would be madness," said I, "for me to buy a diamond under
the circumstances.  Besides, I do not carry hundreds of pounds
about in my pocket. Yet I more than half believe your story.  I
will, if you like, do this: come to my office to-morrow . . . . "
<P>
"You think I am a thief!" said he keenly.  "You will tell the
police.  I am not coming into a trap."
<P>
"Somehow I am assured you are no thief.  Here is my card. 
Take that, anyhow.  You need not come to any appointment.  Come
when you will."
<P>
He took the card, and an earnest of my good-will.
<P>
"Think better of it and come," said I.
<P>
He shook his head doubtfully.  "I will pay back your
half-crown with interest some day--such interest as will amaze
you," said he.  "Anyhow, you will keep the secret? . . . . Don't
follow me."
<P>
He crossed the road and went into the darkness towards the
little steps under the archway leading into Essex Street, and I let
him go.  And that was the last I ever saw of him.
<P>
Afterwards I had two letters from him asking me to send
bank-notes--not cheques--to certain addresses.  I weighed the
matter over and took what I conceived to be the wisest course. 
Once he called upon me when I was out.  My urchin described him as
a very thin, dirty, and ragged man, with a dreadful cough.  He left
no message.  That was the finish of him so far as my story goes. 
I wonder sometimes what has become of him.  Was he an ingenious
monomaniac, or a fraudulent dealer in pebbles, or has he really
made diamonds as he asserted?  The latter is just sufficiently
credible to make me think at times that I have missed the most
brilliant opportunity of my life.  He may of course be dead, and
his diamonds carelessly thrown aside--one, I repeat, was almost as
big as my thumb.  Or he may be still wandering about trying to sell
the things.  It is just possible he may yet emerge upon society,
and, passing athwart my heavens in the serene altitude sacred to
the wealthy and the well-advertised, reproach me silently for my
want of enterprise.  I sometimes think I might at least have risked
five pounds.
