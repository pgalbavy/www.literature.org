<p>Duke, hastening to place himself upon the stone slab, raged at
his enemy in safety; and presently the indomitable Gipsy could
be heard from the darkness below, turning on the bass of his siren,
threatening the water that enveloped him, returning Duke's profanity
with interest, and cursing the general universe.</p>

<p>"You hush!" Penrod stormed, rushing at Duke. "You go 'way from
here! You <em>DUKE</em>!"</p>

<p>And Duke, after prostrating himself, decided that it would be
a relief to obey and to consider his responsibilities in this
matter at an end. He withdrew beyond a corner of the house, thinking
deeply.</p>

<p>"Why'n't you let him bark at the ole cat?" Sam Williams inquired,
sympathizing with the oppressed. "I guess you'd want to bark if
a cat had been treatin' you the way this one did Duke."</p>

<p>"Well, we got to get this cat out o' here, haven't we?" Penrod
demanded crossly.</p>

<p>"What fer?" Herman asked. "Mighty mean cat! If it was me, I let
'at ole cat drownd."</p>

<p>"My goodness," Penrod cried. "What you want to let it drown for?
Anyways, we got to use this water in our house, haven't we? You
don't s'pose people like to use water that's got a cat drowned
in it, do you? It gets pumped up into the tank in the attic and
goes all over the house, and I bet you wouldn't want to see your
father and mother usin' water a cat was drowned in. I guess I
don't want my father and moth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, how <em>CAN </em>we get it out?" Sam asked, cutting short
this virtuous oration. "It's swimmin' around down there," he continued,
peering into the cistern, "and kind of roaring, and it must of
dropped its fishbone, 'cause it's spittin' just awful. I guess
maybe it's mad 'cause it fell in there."</p>

<p>"I don't know how it's goin' to be got out," said Penrod; "but
I know it's <em>GOT </em>to be got out, and that's all there is
to it! I'm not goin' to have my father and mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, once," said Sam, "once when a kitten fell down <em>OUR
</em>cistern, Papa took a pair of his trousers, and he held 'em
by the end of one leg, and let 'em hang down through the hole
till the end of the other leg was in the water, and the kitten
went and clawed hold of it, and he pulled it right up, easy as
anything. Well, that's the way to do now, 'cause if a kitten could
keep hold of a pair of trousers, I guess this ole cat could. It's
the biggest cat <em>I</em> ever saw! All you got to do is to go
and ast your mother for a pair of your father's trousers, and
we'll have this ole cat out o' there in no time."</p>

<p>Penrod glanced toward the house perplexedly.</p>

<p>"She ain't home, and I'd be afraid to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, take your own, then," Sam suggested briskly.</p>

<p>"You take 'em off in the stable, and wait in there, and I and
Herman'll get the cat out."</p>

<p>Penrod had no enthusiasm for this plan; but he affected to consider
it.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know 'bout that," he said, and then, after gazing
attentively into the cistern and making some eye measurements
of his knickerbockers, he shook his head. "They'd be too short.
They wouldn't be <em>NEAR </em>long enough!"</p>

<p>"Then neither would mine," said Sam promptly.</p>

<p>"Herman's would," said Penrod.</p>

<p>"No, suh!" Herman had recently been promoted to long trousers,
and he expressed a strong disinclination to fall in with Penrod's
idea. "My Mammy sit up late nights sewin' on 'ese britches fer
me, makin' 'em outen of a pair o' pappy's, an' they mighty good
britches. Ain' goin' have no wet cat climbin' up 'em! No, suh!"</p>

<p>Both boys began to walk toward him argumentatively, while he
moved slowly backward, shaking his head and denying them.</p>

<p>"I don't keer how much you talk!" he said. "Mammy gave my <em>OLE
</em>britches to Verman, an' 'ese here ones on'y britches I got
now, an' I'm go' to keep 'em on me&mdash;not take 'em off an' let ole
wet cat splosh all over 'em. My Mammy, she sewed 'em fer ME, I
reckon&mdash;d'in' sew 'em fer no cat!"</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>PLEASE, </em>come on, Herman!" Penrod begged pathetically.
"You don't want to see the poor cat drown, do you?"</p>

<p>"Mighty mean cat!" Herman said. "Bet' let 'at ole pussy-cat 'lone
whur it is."</p>

<p>"Why, it'll only take a minute," Sam urged. "You just wait inside
the stable and you'll have 'em back on again before you could
say 'Jack Robinson.'"</p>

<p>"I ain' got no use to say no Jack Robason," said Herman. "An'
I ain' go' to han' over my britches fer NO cat!"</p>

<p>"Listen here, Herman," Penrod began pleadingly. "You can watch
us every minute through the crack in the stable door, can't you?
We ain't goin' to <em>HURT '</em>em any, are we? You can see everything
we do, can't you? Look at here, Herman: you know that little saw
you said you wished it was yours, in the carpenter shop? Well,
honest, if you'll just let us take your trousers till we get this
poor ole cat out the cistern, I'll give you that little saw."</p>

<p>Herman was shaken; he yearned for the little saw.</p>

<p>"You gimme her to keep?" he asked cautiously. "You gimme her
befo' I han' over my britches?"</p>

<p>"You'll see!" Penrod ran into the stable, came back with the
little saw, and placed it in Herman's hand. Herman could resist
no longer, and two minutes later he stood in the necessary negligee
within the shelter of the stable door, and watched, through the
crack, the lowering of the surrendered garment into the cistern.
His gaze was anxious, and surely nothing could have been more
natural, since the removal had exposed Herman's brown legs, and,
although the weather was far from inclement, November is never
quite the month for people to be out of doors entirely without
leg-covering. Therefore, he marked with impatience that Sam and
Penrod, after lowering the trousers partway to the water, had
withdrawn them and fallen into an argument.</p>

<p>"Name o' goo'ness!" Herman shouted. "I ain' got no time fer you
all do so much talkin'. If you go' git 'at cat out, why'n't you
<em>GIT </em>him?"</p>

<p>"Wait just a minute," Penrod called, and he came running to the
stable, seized upon a large wooden box, which the carpenters had
fitted with a lid and leather hinges, and returned with it cumbersomely
to the cistern. "There!" he said. "That'll do to put it in. It
won't get out o' that, I bet you."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd like to know what you want to keep it for," Sam said
peevishly, and, with the suggestion of a sneer, he added, "I s'pose
you think somebody'll pay about a hunderd dollars reward or something,
on account of a cat!"</p>

<p>"I don't, either!" Penrod protested hotly. "I know what I'm doin',
I tell you."</p>

<p>"Well, what on earth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you some day, won't I?" Penrod cried. "I got my reasons
for wantin' to keep this cat, and I'm goin' to keep it. <em>YOU
</em>don't haf to ke&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, all right," Sam said shortly. "Anyways, it'll be dead
if you don't hurry."</p>

<p>"It won't, either," Penrod returned, kneeling and peering down
upon the dark water. "Listen to him! He's growlin' and spittin'
away like anything! It takes a mighty fine-blooded cat to be as
fierce as that. I bet you most cats would 'a' given up and drowned
long ago. The water's awful cold, and I expect he was perty supprised
when he lit in it."</p>

<p>"Herman's makin' a fuss again," Sam said. "We better get the
ole cat out o' there if we're goin' to."</p>

<p>"Well, this is the way we'll do," Penrod said authoritatively:
"I'll let you hold the trousers, Sam. You lay down and keep hold
of one leg, and let the other one hang down till its end is in
the water. Then you kind of swish it around till it's somewheres
where the cat can get hold of it, and soon as he does, you pull
it up, and be mighty careful so's it don't fall off. Then I'll
grab it and stick it in the box and slam the lid down."</p>

<p>Rather pleased to be assigned to the trousers, Sam accordingly
extended himself at full length upon the slab and proceeded to
carry out Penrod's instructions. Meanwhile, Penrod, peering from
above, inquired anxiously for information concerning this work
of rescue.</p>

<p>"Can you see it, Sam? Why don't it grab hold? What's it doin'
now, Sam?"</p>

<p>"It's spittin' at Herman's trousers," said Sam. "My gracious,
but it's a fierce cat! If it's mad all the time like this, you
better not ever try to pet it much. Now it's kind o' sniffin'
at the trousers. It acks to me as if it was goin' to ketch hold.
Yes, it's stuck one claw in 'em &mdash;OW!"</p>

<p>Sam uttered a blood-curdling shriek and jerked convulsively.
The next instant, streaming and inconceivably gaunt, the ravening
Gipsy appeared with a final bound upon Sam's shoulder. It was
not in Gipsy's character to be drawn up peaceably; he had ascended
the trousers and Sam's arm without assistance and in his own way.
Simultaneously&mdash;for this was a notable case of everything happening
at once&mdash;there was a muffled, soggy splash, and the unfortunate
Herman, smit with prophecy in his seclusion, uttered a dismal
yell. Penrod laid hands upon Gipsy, and, after a struggle suggestive
of sailors landing a man-eating shark, succeeded in getting him
into the box, and sat upon the lid thereof.</p>

<p>Sam had leaped to his feet, empty handed and vociferous.</p>

<p>"Ow ow, <em>OUCH!" </em>he shouted, as he rubbed his suffering
arm and shoulder. Then, exasperated by Herman's lamentations,
he called angrily: "Oh, what <em>I</em> care for your ole britches?
I guess if you'd 'a' had a cat climb up <em>YOU, </em>you'd 'a'
dropped 'em a hunderd times over!"</p>

<p>However, upon excruciating entreaty, he consented to explore
the surface of the water with a clothes-prop, but reported that
the luckless trousers had disappeared in the depths, Herman having
forgotten to remove some "fishin' sinkers" from his pockets before
making the fated loan.</p>

<p>Penrod was soothing a lacerated wrist in his mouth.</p>

<p>"That's a mighty fine-blooded cat," he remarked. "I expect it'd
got away from pretty near anybody, 'specially if they didn't know
much about cats. Listen at him, in the box, Sam. I bet you never
heard a cat growl as loud as that in your life. I shouldn't wonder
it was part panther or sumpthing."</p>

<p>Sam began to feel more interest and less resentment.</p>

<p>"I tell you what we can do, Penrod," he said: "Let's take it
in the stable and make the box into a cage. We can take off the
hinges and slide back the lid a little at a time, and nail some
o' those laths over the front for bars."</p>

<p>"That's just exackly what I was goin' to say!" Penrod exclaimed.
"I already thought o' that, Sam. Yessir, we'll make it just like
a reg'lar circus-cage, and our good ole cat can look out from
between the bars and growl. It'll come in pretty handy if we ever
decide to have another show. Anyways, we'll have her in there,
good and tight, where we can watch she don't get away. I got a
mighty good reason to keep this cat, Sam. You'll see."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you&mdash;" Sam was interrupted by n vehement appeal
from the stable. "Oh, we're comin'!" he shouted. "We got to bring
our cat in its cage, haven't we?"</p>

<p>"Listen, Herman," Penrod called absent-mindedly. "Bring us some
bricks, or something awful heavy to put on the lid of our cage,
so we can carry it without our good ole cat pushin' the lid open."</p>

<p>Herman explained with vehemence that it would not be right for
him to leave the stable upon any errand until just restorations
had been made. He spoke inimically of the cat that had been the
occasion of his loss, and he earnestly requested that operations
with the clothes-prop be resumed in the cistern. Sam and Penrod
declined, on the ground that this was absolutely proven to be
of no avail, and Sam went to look for bricks.</p>

<p>These two boys were not unfeeling. They sympathized with Herman;
but they regarded the trousers as a loss about which there was
no use in making so much outcry. To them, it was part of an episode
that ought to be closed. They had done their best, and Sam had
not intended to drop the trousers; that was something no one could
have helped, and therefore no one was to be blamed. What they
were now interested in was the construction of a circus-cage for
their good ole cat.</p>

<p>"It's goin' to be a cage just exactly like circus-cages, Herman,"
Penrod said, as he and Sam set the box down on the stable floor.
"You can help us nail the bars and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I ain' studyin' 'bout no bars!" Herman interrupted fiercely.
"What good you reckon nailin' bars go' do me if Mammy holler fer
me? You white boys sutn'y show me bad day! I try treat people
nice, 'n'en they go th'ow my britches down cistern!</p>

<p>"I did not!" Sam protested. "That ole cat just kicked 'em out
o' my hand with its hind feet while its front ones were stickin'
in my arm. I bet <em>YOU'D </em>of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blame it on cat!" Herman sneered. "'At's nice! Jes' looky here
minute: Who'd I len' 'em britches to? D' I len' 'em britches to
thishere cat? No, suh; you know I didn'! You know well's any man
I len' 'em britches to you&mdash;an' you tuck an' th'owed 'em down
cistern!"</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>PLEASE </em>hush up about your old britches!" Penrod
said plaintively. "I got to think how we're goin' to fix our cage
up right, and you make so much noise I can't get my mind on it.
Anyways, didn't I give you that little saw?"</p>

<p>"Li'l saw!" Herman cried, unmollified. "Yes; an' thishere li'l
saw go' do me lot o' good when I got to go home!"</p>

<p>"Why, it's only across the alley to your house, Herman!" said
Sam. "That ain't anything at all to step over there, and you've
got your little saw."</p>

<p>"Aw right! You jes' take off you' closes an' step 'cross the
alley,"  said Herman bitterly. "I give you li'l saw to carry!"</p>

<p>Penrod had begun to work upon the cage.</p>

<p>"Now listen here, Herman," he said: "if you'll quit talkin' so
much, and kind of get settled down or sumpthing, and help us fix
a good cage for our panther, well, when mamma comes home about
five o'clock, I'll go and tell her there's a poor boy got his
britches burned up in a fire, and how he's waitin' out in the
stable for some, and I'll tell her I promised him. Well, she'll
give me a pair I wore for summer; honest she will, and you can
put 'em on as quick as anything."</p>

<p>"There, Herman," said Sam; "now you're all right again!"</p>

<p>"<em>WHO </em>all right?" Herman complained. "I like feel sump'm'
roun' my laigs befo' no five o'clock!"</p>

<p>"Well, you're sure to get 'em by then," Penrod promised. "It
ain't winter yet, Herman. Come on and help saw these laths for
the bars, Herman, and Sam and I'll nail 'em on. It ain't long
till five o'clock, Herman, and then you'll just feel fine!"</p>

<p>Herman was not convinced; but he found himself at a disadvantage
in the argument. The question at issue seemed a vital one to him&mdash;and
yet his two opponents evidently considered it of minor importance.
Obviously, they felt that the promise for five o'clock had settled
the whole matter conclusively; but to Herman this did not appear
to be the fact. However, he helplessly suffered himself to be
cajoled back into carpentry, though he was extremely ill at ease
and talked a great deal of his misfortune. He shivered and grumbled,
and, by his passionate urgings, compelled Penrod to go into the
house so many times to see what time it was by the kitchen clock
that both his companions almost lost patience with him.</p>

<p>"There!" said Penrod, returning from performing this errand for
the fourth time. "It's twenty minutes after three, and I'm not
goin' in to look at that ole clock again if I haf to die for it!
I never heard anybody make such a fuss in my life, and I'm gettin'
tired of it. Must think we want to be all night fixin' this cage
for our panther! If you ask me to go and see what time it is again,
Herman, I'm a-goin' to take back about askin' mamma at five o'clock,
and <em>THEN </em>where'll you be?"</p>

<p>"Well, it seem like mighty long aft'noon to me," Herman sighed.
"I jes' like to know what time it is gettin' to be now!"</p>

<p>"Look out!" Penrod warned him. "You heard what I was just tellin'
you about how I'd take back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nemmine," Herman said hurriedly. "I wasn' astin' you. I jes'
sayin' sump'm' kind o' to myse'f like."</p>
