<p>Let us state this geometrical problem in the simplest words:
an express train has to cover the ground between two little stations
three miles apart. It is announced at the second when it passes
the first; and yet they wait for it at the second in vain. They
hurry from both stations down the line to find the wreck; but
they do not so much as find the train, an express train in which
there are perhaps a hundred passengers.</p>

<p>That the station-master of A should have fallen down dead at
the shock of this unheard-of, bewildering, stupefying, absurd,
diabolical, and yet how simple (as we shall learn later) disappearance
of the train, is not greatly to be wondered at. The minds of all
of them were shaken by the occurrence. The station-master of B
was not in a much better condition than his colleague. Everyone
present uttered incoherent cries. They kept calling the train,
as if the train could have answered! They did not hear it, and
on that flat plain they did not see it! The ticket-clerk of station
A knelt down beside the body of his chief, and presently said,
"I am quite sure he is dead!" The rest gathered round the body
of the dead man; and then, tearing up two of the little trees
from the side of the road which runs beside the railway, they
laid him on them. Carrying the body on this rude litter, they
returned towards station A. We must bear in mind that the express
had passed station B, and that no one had seen it reach station
A.</p>

<p>But they had not yet reached station A when, on the line, <em>on
the line along which they had just come</em>, they perceived a
railway-carriage, or rather a railway-carriage and a guard's-van!
They greeted the sight in their excitable French way with the
howls of madmen. Where did this end of a train come from? And
what had become of the beginning of the train, that is to say,
of the engine, the tender, the dining-car, and the three corridor
carriages?</p>

<p>Look at the plan. C marks the point on the line at which the
staffs of stations A and B met, when they were hunting for the
train. It is also the point at which the station-master of A fell
down dead. The two staffs then, in a body, were bringing back
the dead station-master towards A, when at the point D, a point
they had passed a few minutes before, and at which they had seen
nothing, they find a railway-carriage and a guard's-van.</p>

<p>These people greeted this sight with the cries of madmen; and
then they perceived an odd-looking head looking out of one of
the windows of the railway-carriage. It waggled. This head had
no ears; and the earless man <em>had his head out of the carriage
window</em>. They shouted to him. From the moment they caught
sight of him they asked him what had happened. But the man did
not answer. The odd thing was that his head waggled from left
to right, as if it were moved by the wind which was blowing at
the time with some force. It was a head with crinkly hair. It
was bent downwards; and the cravat round a high collar, very white
on that grey day, was untied and streaming in the wind.</p>

<p>At last when they came quite near (they moved slowly owing to
the fact that they were carrying the station-master) they saw
clearly the shocking reality. The man not only had his head out
of the window, he had also got it caught in the window. The unfortunate
wretch must have opened the window and stuck his head out while
the train was in motion; and the window must have been jerked
up violently and cut his head half off! On seeing this, the two
staffs howled afresh; then they set down the body of the station-master,
ran round the guard's-van, <em>in which there was nobody</em>,
and opening a door on the other side of the carriage, they found
that it was empty, except for the man <em>whose head was caught
in the window</em>, and that his body, inside the carriage, was
<em>stripped of every rag of clothing</em>.</p>

<p>The news of these fantastic horrors at once spread throughout
the district. An enormous crowd thronged the platforms of station
A all the rest of the day. The chief officials of the line came
from Paris. Not only were they unable to explain, on that day
and the days following, the death of the man who had had his head
out of the carriage window, but they were still unable to find
either the train or the passengers. They talked of nothing but
this strange affair at the funeral of the station-master of A,
which was celebrated with great solemnity, and also throughout
Europe and America.</p>
