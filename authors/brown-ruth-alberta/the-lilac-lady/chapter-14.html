<p>"Just one week more and Fourth of July will be here," announced
Peace from her seat on the grass, as she counted off the days
on her fingers. They were all gathered under the trees that warm
afternoon, Aunt Pen and Elizabeth with their sewing, the minister
with a magazine from which he had been reading aloud, Giuseppe
with his beloved violin, from which he was seldom separated, the
lame girl lying in her accustomed place, and Peace and Glen gambolling
in the grass at their feet.</p>

<p>"Why, so it will," said the invalid in surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you s'pose grandpa will get back by that time?"</p>

<p>"Should you care if he did not?" asked preacher teasingly.</p>

<p>"John!" reproved Elizabeth, tapping him gently on the head with
her thimble. "Aren't you ashamed of yourself to ask such a question?"</p>

<p>"No offense, ladies, no offense intended, I assure you! I merely
wondered if Peace could be getting homesick."</p>

<p>"Me homesick! Oh, no, I'm not <em>homesick</em>, but I'll bet
the other folks are by this time. I've been gone so long. One
week of March, all of April and May, and nearly all of June&mdash;that's
three months already; and I've never been away from the girls
more'n a night or two at a time before."</p>

<p>There was a wistful look in the brown eyes in spite of her emphatic
denial that she was homesick, and Elizabeth sought to turn the
conversation by saying meditatively, "I wonder what Glen will
think of the Fourth of July celebration? He was almost too young
last year to notice anything of that sort, and besides, we had
a very quiet day at Parker. Everyone had gone to the city for
their fun."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was quiet in Parker last year. Hec Abbott was away all
day, and I didn't have any fire-crackers," Peace observed; then,
noting the broad smile that bathed all the faces, she added hastily,
"I s'pose it was just as well, 'cause it was an awful dry summer,
and like enough we would have set the place on fire. That's why
Gail wouldn't let us have any, but this year we're going to make
up for all we've missed&mdash;if grandpa gets home in time. We've got
dollars and dollars in our bank &mdash;Allee and me&mdash;left over
from dec'rating our room, and we're going to blow it all up celebrating
the Fourth, so's to be patriotic. Grandpa says love of country
is something every 'Merican needs, so we're beginning young at
our house. Grandpa says&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What does grandpa say?" boomed a dear, familiar voice behind
her, and she bounced to her feet with a wild shriek of joy, for
leaning against the iron gates at the end of the walk stood the
genial President, while in the carriage just beyond sat Grandma
Campbell and the three younger sisters, all fidgeting with eagerness
to meet the small maid whose face they had not seen for so long
a time.</p>

<p>"Oh, grandpa, grandma, girls, when did you get here? I never
so much as heard you drive up!"</p>

<p>Scarcely touching the gravel with her toes, she fairly flew through
the gate into the five pair of arms reaching out to embrace her,
hugging and kissing them impartially in her delight to be with
them again, and asking questions as fast as her tongue could fly.
"How did you like the Woods? Where are Gail and Faith? Haven't
they come in from the Lake yet? I haven't seen them for <em>three
weeks</em> now. Are you perfectly well, Allee? What's the matter
with Cherry's nose, grandma? It looks skinned. Does scarlet fever
make people grow tall, or what has happened to Hope? My, but you've
missed it, being <em>quadrupined</em> up in the house all the
spring! Yes, I'd like to have seen the Woods, too, but 's long
as you didn't take me, I had a better time here. Oh, it's been
jolly. There come Aunt Pen and Elspeth. I s'pose they think you've
kissed me enough for one time and you better climb out and go
speak to my Lilac Lady. She's been wanting to see you all, 'specially
Gail and Faith which ain't here."</p>

<p>They answered her questions as best they could&mdash;they had enjoyed
their brief sojourn in the Pine Woods very much, for they had
found it more than tiresome to be quarantined all those beautiful
weeks, but Peace's telephone messages and queer adventures had
helped brighten many an hour. They were particularly interested
in the Lilac Lady and the little Italian musician, and were anxious
to meet the big-hearted Aunt Pen. So they clambered out of the
carriage and were properly introduced by the preacher and his
wife, while Peace fluttered from one to another of the happy group,
too excited to remember such things as introductions.</p>

<p>The lame girl was very sorry to lose this little will-o'-wisp
neighbor who had brought so much sunshine into her life during
her short stay at the parsonage, but Elizabeth was to visit her
every day, and the Campbells promised not only to lend Peace often
to the stone house, but also to come with her; so they said good-bye
at length, and the curly brown head bobbed out of sight down the
long avenue, behind prancing Marmaduke and Charlemagne.</p>

<p>Peace was glad to get home again, and spent the next few days
renewing her acquaintance with the place, philosophizing with
Gussie, Marie and Jud, and regaling family and servants alike
with accounts of her long stay at the parsonage, for it seemed
to her that she had been away three years instead of three months.</p>

<p>On the third day she suddenly remembered the approaching Fourth
and the generous bank account which she and Allee had kept for
just that occasion. So she sat down on the stairs to plan out
the list of fireworks that they should buy with their precious
hoard, and was busy trying to add up a lengthy column of figures,
when she heard Hope in the hall below say, "Yes, grandma, it's
a letter from Gail. They aren't coming home for another week unless
you want them particularly, because they have discovered a family
of eight children out there by the lake who have never had a real
Fourth of July celebration in their lives, and Frances is planning
a picnic for them and wants the girls to help her out."</p>

<p>Peace heard no more. Frances was planning a gala day for a family
of eight children who would have no fireworks for the glorious
Fourth. Why could she and Allee not do the same thing for the
Home children? There were more than fifty little folks in that
institution who would have no celebration either, unless some
good fairy provided it. She and Allee would have more than enough
fire-crackers for the whole family, even if grandpa did not buy
a single bunch himself, and of course he would do his part to
make the day a grand success.</p>

<p>She went in search of Allee, unfolded her new plan, and as usual
won her ready consent, for the smallest sister found this other
child's quaint ideas delightfully thrilling, and was always willing
to join her in any escapade, however daring.</p>

<p>"I knew you'd say yes," Peace sighed with satisfaction, when
they had agreed upon the list of fire-crackers, caps and torpedoes.
"Now the thing of it is, will grandpa be as easy? He has such
very queer thoughts on some things. Still, he's usu'ly right,
too. I've found out that it is lots better to try to help such
folks as the Home children 'stead of tramps and hand-organ men,
who are only fakes or lazy-bones. There was Petri, now,&mdash;he made
loads of money off of Juiceharpie and Jocko, but he was mean as
dirt to both of them. The Home children are different. Anything
nice you do for them makes them happy and they like you all the
better. Well, we better go see grandpa about it first, so's he
can't kick after we get started real well with our plans. Besides,
I don't s'pose Miss Chase would listen to us if grandpa doesn't
know what we are up to."</p>

<p>Hand in hand they descended the stairs to the study and knocked,
but the weary President was stretched on his couch fast asleep
and did not hear their gentle tapping.</p>

<p>"He's here, I know," Peace declared. "I saw him when he went
in, and he told grandma that he should be home the rest of the
day."</p>

<p>"P'raps he's upstairs in his room."</p>

<p>"But he ain't, I tell you! Didn't we just come from upstairs!
We'd have heard him moving about if he'd been up there."</p>

<p>"Maybe he's asleep."</p>

<p>"I'm going to see."</p>

<p>Cautiously she opened the door a little crack and peeped in.
The west window curtains were drawn and the room was very dim,
but after a few rapid blinks, Peace became accustomed to the subdued
light, and saw the long figure lying on the davenport beside the
fireplace, now filled with summer flowers.</p>

<p>"There he is," she whispered triumphantly, and pushing the door
further ajar, she stepped across the threshold.</p>

<p>"Oh, we mustn't 'sturb him!" protested Allee, holding back; but
Peace serenely assured her, "I ain't going to touch him. I'm just
going to stay till he wakes up. Are you coming?"</p>

<p>Allee, followed, still a little reluctant, and the door closed
noiselessly behind them. With careful hands, they drew up a long
Roman chair in front of the couch, and sat down together to await
the President's awakening. The room was almost gloomy in its dimness,
and so quiet that they could hear their own breathing. But not
another sound broke the silence, save the ticking of the little
French clock on the mantel, which drove Peace almost to distraction.
Then she chanced to remember a discussion she had heard a long
time before, and settling herself with elbows on her knees and
her chin in her hands, she fixed her somber eyes full upon the
sleeping face before her, and stared with all her might.</p>

<p>"Look at him," she commanded Allee in a stage whisper.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Just 'cause. Glare for all you're worth!"</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you byme-by."</p>

<p>So dutiful Allee "glared for all she was worth," and soon the
sleeper grew restless. Then he opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"We did it!" crowed Peace shrilly, spatting her hands together
so suddenly that he jumped.</p>

<p>"Did what, you young jackanapes?" he growled, rubbing his sleepy
eyes, a trifle vexed at having been disturbed before his nap was
out.</p>

<p>"Woke you up with just looking at you! We never touched you at
all&mdash;just glared and glowered as hard as ever we could, and you
woke up like Faith said you would."</p>

<p>"Faith? Did she send you here to wake me up? Have she and Gail
come home?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, they ain't coming till after the Fourth. They're going
to stay and help Frances celebrate a family of eight children
which have never had any fireworks in all their lives. That's
what we came to see you about, but you were asleep and we got
tired of waiting, so we tried to see if we could stare you awake,
like the girls said folks could do if they looked long and hard
enough. It worked."</p>

<p>"Something did," he smiled grimly. "Was it so important that
you had to tell it immediately? Couldn't it have kept until dinner
hour?"</p>

<p>"You and grandma are invited out for dinner this evening, and
anyway, we wanted to have a private <em>conflab</em> with you
all by yourself before we told the others our plan."</p>

<p>"Plan? Another plan! My sakes, Peace, where do you keep them
all?"</p>

<p>The round, eager face grew long. It wasn't like grandpa to make
fun of her. What could be the matter?</p>

<p>"I guess you're not int'rested," she said in heavy disappointment.
"Come, Allee, we better be going."</p>

<p>"Indeed you better not!" he cried, thoroughly aroused by her
look and tone, and remembering that she was unaccountably sensitive
to the moods of her loved ones. "I won't tease you another speck.
Come and tell grandpa what it is now that you want me to help
with."</p>

<p>"We don't want your help at all," she answered gravely, letting
him draw her down to one knee, while he enthroned Allee on the
other. "All you've got to do is say yes."</p>

<p>Knowing from experience what wild-cat schemes were often evolved
by that tireless brain, he cautiously replied, "'Yes' is an easy
word to speak, girlies, but sometimes 'no' is wisest, even if
it is hard to learn."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think you will like this plan, grandpa." Peace was warming
up to the subject. "It hasn't anything to do with tramps or beggars,
and I don't want to give away any more of my clo'es&mdash;'nless p'raps
that white apron to Lottie, 'cause she likes it so well. This
is about the Home children. You know our Fourth of July money?"</p>

<p>"Did you think I had forgotten that?" Inwardly he was shaking
with merriment. He never recalled the dedication of the flag room
without wanting to shout.</p>

<p>"No, but I did think maybe it had skipped your mind just for
a minute."</p>

<p>"Well, it hasn't. What does your Fourth of July money have to
do with the Home children and white aprons?"</p>

<p>"White aprons ain't in it&mdash;only that one I should like to give
Lottie, but that can be any day. What we want to do is share our
fire-crackers with the Home children, 'cause the Lady Boards don't
allow for such things in raising money to take care of the Home,
and so the children won't have any to celebrate with, 'nless their
fathers bring them a few, and mostly the fathers are too hard
up for that. Allee and me have dollars and dollars in our bank
just to <em>cluttervate</em> our love of country with, and we
thought this would be a splendid chance to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Spread the d'sease," finished Allee, as Peace paused for want
of words to express her ideas.</p>

<p>"It ain't a <em>disease</em>, Allee Greenfield! To make 'em happy&mdash;that's
what I meant to say."</p>

<p>"A very worthy object, my dear."</p>

<p>"Then you like it and won't kick?"</p>

<p>"If you have considered the matter carefully and want to share
your Fourth of July with the Home children, I am perfectly willing,
girlies, and will do all I can to help you succeed."</p>

<p>"That's what we wanted to know, grandpa," she cried gleefully.
"You'll have all kinds of chances to help, too, 'cause I've just
thought of ice-cream and watermelon&mdash;if they are ripe by that
time&mdash;and ice-cream anyway, with a nice picnic dinner to go with
the fire-crackers and <em>Roming</em> candles. Some of 'em have
never had but two or three dishes of ice-cream in all their lives.
Think how tickled they will be! P'raps my Lilac Lady will invite
them all over to her house to celebrate, 'cause it always seems
so much nicer to go away somewhere for a picnic, even if 'tis
only a few blocks. And the stone house has great wide lawns, bigger'n
ours, though I like ours best on account of the river, even if
we haven't all the lovely flowers which Hicks has planted in his
gardens."</p>

<p>Thoughtfully the President lifted the shade behind the couch
and looked out across the smooth velvet turf, sloping gently to
the river bank in one long, even stretch, broken by an occasional
posy-bed, and liberally dotted with giant oaks and stately lindens.
It was an ideal spot for a picnic or lawn social such as Peace
had described; and Japanese lanterns suspended among the branches
and hung about the wide verandas would make it a veritable fairyland
for the little folks of the Home, whose gala days were so few
and far between.</p>

<p>Unconsciously he spoke aloud: "The mis'es would enjoy it as much
as the rest; that is the beauty of it."</p>

<p>"What <em>are</em> you talking about, grandpa?" cried the children,
amazed at the remark which seemed to have no bearing whatever
on the subject.</p>

<p>"Did I speak?" he asked sheepishly. "I was just wondering how
they would enjoy coming here for their celebration instead of
going to the stone house&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, grandpa! That would be <em>splendid</em>! How did it happen
that I never thought of it myself?" Peace exclaimed in comical
surprise. "We'll ask Saint Elspeth and John and my Lilac Lady
and Aunt Pen to come and help. Hicks took her to church for Children's
Sunday. Don't you s'pose he could bring her down here, even if
it is three miles?"</p>

<p>"If she will come, dear, we will find a way of bringing her,"
he promised, drawing the little girls closer to him as if to shield
them from such sorrow as had darkened that other young life.</p>

<p>"And that will mean Juiceharpie and Glen will come, too," murmured
Allee, who was much charmed with these two little gentlemen, particularly
with the Italian waif, whose strange history still seemed like
a story-book tale to her.</p>

<p>"Yes, the children will come, too, of course, and we will even
borrow the cook and Hicks, if the Lilac Lady will lend them. Do
you suppose she will?"</p>

<p>"Let's go and see this very minute," proposed Peace. "The Fourth
is too near already to let it get any closer before we find out
about these things. And we've still to see Miss Chase about the
Home folks coming, you know."</p>

<p>Thoroughly interested now in her project, the President drew
forth his watch, glanced at the hour, and rang for Jud to harness
the horses.</p>

<p>Of course Miss Chase accepted the invitation at once, and the
Home children were jubilant. The little parsonage family was equally
charmed with the plan and agreed to help it along all they could.
But at the stone house, when the matter was explained, it quite
took Aunt Pen's breath away, and for a moment even the Lilac Lady
looked as if she were about to refuse. But Giuseppe was radiant,
and seizing his beloved violin, ha capered about the white-faced
invalid, crying in delight, "An' I feedle an' ma angel seeng.
Oh, eet be heaven!"</p>

<p>Perhaps it was his happy face, perhaps it was Peace's wistful
entreaty, but at any rate, the lame girl suddenly smiled up at
the President beside her and answered heartily, "Tell Mrs. Campbell
we shall all be there to help her if the day is clear, and it
surely must be when the happiness of so many people depends upon
it."</p>

<p>The day <em>was</em> clear and delightfully cool, Jud had accomplished
wonders with flags, bunting and lanterns, and the place looked
even more like the haunts of fairies than the girls had dared
dream. Rustic benches and porch chairs were scattered about under
the trees, two immense hammocks hung on the wide veranda, and
a strong swing had been fastened among the branches of the tallest
oak. The barn chamber, which Peace had planned on having for a
playhouse, was swept and scrubbed, furbished up with old furniture
from the garret, and stocked with toys of all sorts, that the
children who might not care for games all day could find other
amusement to fill the hours. The boat-house, too, was put in order
and decorated with ferns and flowers, for Hope was to preside
here behind great jars of lemonade and frappé, and it proved to
be a very popular resort all day long. It is surprising how thirsty
one does get at a picnic!</p>

<p>Early in the morning, Hicks brought the preacher's family, Aunt
Pen and his young mistress in the great red automobile, which
was now used so seldom that Peace had not even discovered its
existence; but when she saw it, she let out a whoop of surprise
that startled the rest of the household, and dashed down the driveway
to meet it, screaming shrilly, "When you've dumped out that load,
Hicks, you better begin going after the Home children. It will
take Duke and Charley a long time to bring them here alone; and
besides, I'll bet none of the boys and girls there have ever ridden
in an auto yet. I know I haven't."</p>

<p>"That is a good idea, Peace," said the lame girl happily. "I
never would have thought of it. Those who drive down in the carriage
can go home in the auto, so they will all get a ride. Just put
the baskets and traps on that table, Hicks, and start as soon
as possible."</p>

<p>An hour later all the guests had assembled, and the day's program
was begun. Of course there were some mishaps. Was there ever a
picnic without them? But no one was badly hurt. It was Giuseppe's
first celebration of Independence Day with gunpowder and torpedoes,
and in his excitement and delight at the noise he was making,
he thoughtlessly thrust a stump of burning punk into his trousers'
pocket along with a bunch of fire-crackers, and would have been
seriously burned, no doubt, had not Cherry promptly turned the
hose on him. As it was, he was nearly drowned, and very much frightened,
but soon recovered from the shock, and returned with energy to
his crackers again.</p>

<p>Lottie fell through the hay-mow in the barn, trying to escape
her pursuer in a lively game of tag. George tumbled into the river
and was rescued just in time. Tony got hit by the swing-board
and lost one tooth as a result. Allee sat down in a tub of lemonade,
and Peace toppled out of a tree into a trayful of ice-cream which
Jud had just dished up. But these were mere trifles, swallowed
up in the greater events of the day&mdash;the boisterous games on the
smooth lawn, the picnic dinner under the trees, the beautiful
music made by the lame girl and the little songbird of Italy;
the destruction of the sham fort built by the dignified doctor
and sedate young minister; the row on the river in the late afternoon;
the gorgeous beauty of the place when the lanterns were lighted
at dusk; and, fitting climax of that wonderful day, the brilliant
display of fireworks which Jud set off when finally darkness had
fallen over the land.</p>

<p>But like all happy days, this Fourth of July came to an end at
last, the guests departed, and Peace, walking slowly up the path
from the gate, felt suddenly tired. Slipping her hand into the
doctor's big one, she sighed, "Well, it's all over with! Our flag
room money has gone up in smoke and down in ice-cream."</p>

<p>"Are you sorry?" asked the President, a little surprised at her
long-drawn sigh and tone of regret.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I ain't sorry for that part of it. I'm sorry the day
is gone. That's the trouble with having a good time. It always
comes to an end."</p>

<p>"But the memory of it still lives. Think how many hearts you
have made happy today."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so," she answered, brightening visibly; "and the
best of it is, there's at least one more <em>patriarch</em>. Juiceharpie
has always been an Italian till today, but after this he's going
to be an American. The fire-crackers did it."</p>
