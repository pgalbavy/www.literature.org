<p>Suddenly he sat up in bed in his room at the Magnifique, gazing
upon a disconsolate Cooley in gray tweeds who sat heaped in a
chair at the foot of the bed with his head in his hands.</p>

<p>Mellin's first sensation was of utter mystification; his second
was more corporeal: the consciousness of physical misery, of consuming
fever, of aches that ran over his whole body, converging to a
dreadful climax in his head, of a throat so immoderately partched
it seemed to crackle, and a thirst so avid it was a passion. His
eye fell upon a carafe of water on a chair at his bedside; he
seized upon it with a shaking hand and drank half its contents
before he set it down. The action attracted his companion's attention
and he looked up, showing a pale and haggard countenance.</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" inquired Cooley with a wan smile.</p>

<p>Mellin's head dropped back upon the pillow and he made one or
two painful efforts to speak before he succeeded in finding a
ghastly semblance of his voice.</p>

<p>"I thought I was at Madame de Vaurigard's."</p>

<p>"You were," said the other, adding grimly: "We both were."</p>

<p>"But that was only a minute ago."</p>

<p>"It was six hours ago. It's goin' on ten o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p>"I don't understand how that can be. How did I get here?"</p>

<p>"I brought you. I was pretty bad, but you &mdash;I never saw
anything like you! From the time you kissed Lady Mount-Rhyswicke&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mellin sat bolt upright in bed, staring wildly. He began to tremble
violently.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember that?" asked Cooley.</p>

<p>Suddenly he did. The memory of it came with inexorable clarity,
he crossed forearms over his horror-stricken face and fell back
upon his pillow.</p>

<p>"Oh," he gasped. "Un-speakable! Un-speakable!"</p>

<p>"Lord! Don't worry about that! I don't think she minded."</p>

<p>"It's the thought of Madame de Vaurigard&mdash;it kills me! The horror
of it&mdash;that I should do such a thing in her house! She'll never
speak to me again, she oughtn't to; she ought to send her groom
to beat me! You can't think what I've lost&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can't I!" Mr. Cooley rose from his chair and began to pace up
and down the chamber. "I can guess to within a thousand francs
of what <em>I</em>'ve lost! I had to get the hotel to cash a check
on New York for me this morning. I've a habit of carrying all
my money in bills, and a fool trick, too. Well, I'm cured of it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, if it were only a little <em>money</em> and nothing else
that I'd lost! The money means nothing." Mellin choked.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're pretty well fixed. Well, so am I," Cooley shook
his head, "but money certainly means something to me!"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't if you'd thrown away the most precious friendship
of your life."</p>

<p>"See here," said Cooley, halting at the foot of the bed and looking
at his stricken companion from beneath frowning brows, "I guess
I can see how it is with you, and I'll tell you frankly it's been
the same with me. I never met such a fascinating woman in my life:
she throws a reg'ler ole-fashioned <em>spell</em> over you! Now
I hate to say it, but I can't help it, because it plain hits me
in the face every time I think of it; the truth is&mdash;well, sir,
I'm afraid you and me have had little red soldier-coats and caps
put on us and strings tied to our belts while we turned somersets
for the children."</p>

<p>"I don't understand. I don't know what you're talking about."</p>

<p>"No? It seems to get more and more simple to me. I've been thinking
it all over and over again. I can't <em>help</em> it! See here:
I met Sneyd on the steamer, without any introduction. He sort
of warmed into the game in the smoking-room, and he won straight
along the trip. He called on me in London and took me to meet
the Countess at her hotel. We three went to the theatre and lunch
and so forth a few times; and when I left for Paris she turned
up on the way: that's when you met her. Couple of days later,
Sneyd came over, and he and the Countess introduced me to dear
ole friend Pedlow. So you see, I don't rightly even know who any
of 'em really <em>are</em>: just took 'em for granted, as it were.
We had lots of fun, I admit that, honkin' about in my car. We
only played cards once, and that was in her apartment the last
night before I left Paris, but that one time Pedlow won fifteen
thousand francs from me. When I told them my plans, how I was
goin' to motor down to Rome, she said <em>she</em> would be in
Rome&mdash;and, I tell you, I was happy as a poodle-pup about it. Sneyd
said he might be in Rome along about then, and open-hearted ole
Pedlow said not to be surprised if <em>he</em> turned up, too.
Well, he did, almost to the minute, and in the meantime she'd
got <em>you</em> hooked on, fine and tight."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," Mellin lifted himself painfully on
an elbow. "I don't know what you're getting at, but it seems to
me that you're speaking disrespectfully of an angel that I've
insulted, and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now see here, Mellin, I'll tell you something." The boy's white
face showed sudden color and there was a catch in his voice. "I
was &mdash;I've been mighty near in <em>love</em> with that woman!
But I've had a kind of a shock; I've got my common-sense back,
and I'm <em>not</em>, any more. I don't know exactly how much
money I had, but it was between thirty-five and thirty-eight thousand
francs, and Sneyd won it all after we took off the limit&mdash;over
seven thousand dollars&mdash;at her table last night. Putting two and
two together, honestly it looks bad. It looks <em>mighty</em>
bad! Now, I'm pretty well fixed, and yesterday I didn't care whether
school kept or not, but seven thousand dollars is real money to
anybody! My old man worked pretty hard for his first seven thousand,
I guess, and"&mdash;he gulped&mdash;"he'd think a lot of me for lettin'
go of it the way I did last night, <em>wouldn't</em> he? You never
<em>see</em> things like this till the next morning! And you remember
that other woman sat where she could see every hand <em>you</em>
drew, and the Countess&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" Mellin flung one arm up violently, striking the headboard
with his knuckles. "I won't hear a syllable against Madame de
Vaurigard!"  Young Cooley regarded him steadily for a moment.
"Have you remembered yet," he said slowly, "how much <em>you</em>
lost last night?"</p>

<p>"I only remember that I behaved like an unspeakable boor in the
presence of the divinest creature that ever&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cooley disregarded the outburst, and said:</p>

<p>"When we settled, you had a pad of express company checks worth
six hundred dollars. You signed all of 'em and turned 'em over
to Sneyd with three one-hundred-lire bills, which was all the
cash you had with you. Then you gave him your note for twelve
thousand francs to be paid within three days. You made a great
deal of fuss about its being a 'debt of honor.'" He paused. "You
hadn't remembered that, had you?"</p>

<p>Mellin had closed his eyes. He lay quite still and made no answer.</p>

<p>"No, I'll bet you hadn't," said Cooley, correctly deducing the
fact. "You're well off, or you wouldn't be at this hotel, and,
for all I know, you may be fixed so you won't mind your loss as
much as I do mine; but it ought to make you kind of charitable
toward my suspicions of Madame de Vaurigard's friends."</p>

<p>The six hundred dollars in express company checks and the three
hundred-lire bills were all the money the unhappy Mellin had in
the world, and until he could return to Cranston and go back to
work in the real-estate office again, he had no prospect of any
more. He had not even his steamer ticket. In the shock of horror
and despair he whispered brokenly:</p>

<p>"I don't care if they 're the worst people in the world, they're
better than I am!"</p>

<p>The other's gloom cleared a little at this. "Well, you <em>have</em>
got it!"  he exclaimed briskly. "You don't know how different
you'll feel after a long walk in the open air." He looked at his
watch. "I've got to go and see what that newspaper-man, Cornish,
wants; it's ten o'clock. I'll be back after a while; I want to
reason this out with you. I don't deny but it's possible I'm wrong;
anyway, you think it over while I'm gone. You take a good hard
think, will you?"</p>

<p>As he closed the door, Mellin slowly drew the coverlet over his
head. It was as if he covered the face of some one who had just
died.</p>
