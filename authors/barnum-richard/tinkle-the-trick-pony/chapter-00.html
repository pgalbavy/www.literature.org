</p><p>    one he knew he wanted, and with that in his teeth he
    trotted over to Mr. Drake                        <u>Frontispiece</u>
</p><p> And the next time he did jump high enough to go over the
</p><p>    fence                                                       23
</p><p> It was the first time Tinkle had ever had any one on his

</p><p> “Oh, what a nice pony cart!” cried the boys and girls          59
</p><p> It took a little time to make him stand upon his hind
</p><p>    legs without anything on which to rest his front feet       81
</p><p> As Tinkle looked he saw one funny elephant slyly reach
</p><p>    out his trunk and pull the tail of the elephant in
    front of him                                               101
</p><p> George threw his arms around the pony’s neck                  117
