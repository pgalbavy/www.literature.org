<p> On turning to descend Massy perceived the head of Sterne the
mate loitering, with his sly confident smile, his red mustaches
and blinking eyes, at the foot of the ladder.</p>

<p>Sterne had been a junior in one of the larger shipping concerns
before joining the Sofala. He had thrown up his berth, he said,
"on general principles." The promotion in the employ was very
slow, he complained, and he thought it was time for him to try
and get on a bit in the world. It seemed as though nobody would
ever die or leave the firm; they all stuck fast in their berths
till they got mildewed; he was tired of waiting; and he feared
that when a vacancy did occur the best servants were by no means
sure of being treated fairly. Besides, the captain he had to serve
under &mdash;Captain Provost&mdash;was an unaccountable sort of man,
and, he fancied, had taken a dislike to him for some reason or
other. For doing rather more than his bare duty as likely as not.
When he had done anything wrong he could take a talking to, like
a man; but he expected to be treated like a man too, and not to
be addressed invariably as though he were a dog. He had asked
Captain Provost plump and plain to tell him where he was at fault,
and Captain Provost, in a most scornful way, had told him that
he was a perfect officer, and that if he disliked the way he was
being spoken to there was the gangway&mdash;he could take himself off
ashore at once. But everybody knew what sort of man Captain Provost
was. It was no use appealing to the office. Captain Provost had
too much influence in the employ. All the same, they had to give
him a good character. He made bold to say there was nothing in
the world against him, and, as he had happened to hear that the
mate of the Sofala had been taken to the hospital that morning
with a sunstroke, he thought there would be no harm in seeing
whether he would not do. . . .</p>

<p>He had come to Captain Whalley freshly shaved, red-faced, thin-flanked,
throwing out his lean chest; and had recited his little tale with
an open and manly assurance. Now and then his eyelids quivered
slightly, his hand would steal up to the end of the flaming mustache;
his eyebrows were straight, furry, of a chestnut color, and the
directness of his frank gaze seemed to tremble on the verge of
impudence. Captain Whalley had engaged him temporarily; then,
the other man having been ordered home by the doctors, he had
remained for the next trip, and then the next. He had now attained
permanency, and the performance of his duties was marked by an
air of serious, single-minded application. Directly he was spoken
to, he began to smile attentively, with a great deference expressed
in his whole attitude; but there was in the rapid winking which
went on all the time something quizzical, as though he had possessed
the secret of some universal joke cheating all creation and impenetrable
to other mortals.</p>

<p>Grave and smiling he watched Massy come down step by step; when
the chief engineer had reached the deck he swung about, and they
found themselves face to face. Matched as to height and utterly
dissimilar, they confronted each other as if there had been something
between them&mdash;something else than the bright strip of sunlight
that, falling through the wide lacing of two awnings, cut crosswise
the narrow planking of the deck and separated their feet as it
were a stream; something profound and subtle and incalculable,
like an unexpressed understanding, a secret mistrust, or some
sort of fear.</p>

<p>At last Sterne, blinking his deep-set eyes and sticking forward
his scraped, clean-cut chin, as crimson as the rest of his face,
murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>"You’ve seen? He grazed! You’ve seen?"</p>

<p>Massy, contemptuous, and without raising his yellow, fleshy countenance,
replied in the same pitch&mdash;</p>

<p>"Maybe. But if it had been you we would have been stuck fast
in the mud."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mr. Massy. I beg to deny it. Of course a shipowner
may say what he jolly well pleases on his own deck. That’s all
right; but I beg to . . ."</p>

<p>"Get out of my way!"</p>

<p>The other had a slight start, the impulse of suppressed indignation
perhaps, but held his ground. Massy’s downward glance wandered
right and left, as though the deck all round Sterne had been bestrewn
with eggs that must not be broken, and he had looked irritably
for places where he could set his feet in flight. In the end he
too did not move, though there was plenty of room to pass on.</p>

<p>"I heard you say up there," went on the mate&mdash;"and a very just
remark it was too&mdash;that there’s always something wrong. . . ."</p>

<p>"Eavesdropping is what’s wrong with <em>you</em>, Mr. Sterne."</p>

<p>"Now, if you would only listen to me for a moment, Mr. Massy,
sir, I could . . ."</p>

<p>"You are a sneak," interrupted Massy in a great hurry, and even
managed to get so far as to repeat, "a common sneak," before the
mate had broken in argumentatively&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, sir, what is it you want? You want . . ."</p>

<p>"I want &mdash;I want," stammered Massy, infuriated and astonished&mdash;"I
want. How do you know that I want anything? How dare you? . .
. What do you mean? . . . What are you after&mdash;you . . ."</p>

<p>"Promotion." Sterne silenced him with a sort of candid bravado.
The engineer’s round soft cheeks quivered still, but he said quietly
enough&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are only worrying my head off," and Sterne met him with
a confident little smile.</p>

<p>"A chap in business I know (well up in the world he is now) used
to tell me that this was the proper way. ‘Always push on to the
front,’ he would say. ‘Keep yourself well before your boss. Interfere
whenever you get a chance. Show him what you know. Worry him into
seeing you.’ That was his advice. Now I know no other boss than
you here. You are the owner, and no one else counts for <em>that</em>
much in my eyes. See, Mr. Massy? I want to get on. I make no secret
of it that I am one of the sort that means to get on. These are
the men to make use of, sir. You haven’t arrived at the top of
the tree, sir, without finding that out &mdash;I dare say."</p>

<p>"Worry your boss in order to get on," mumbled Massy, as if awestruck
by the irreverent originality of the idea. "I shouldn’t wonder
if this was just what the Blue Anchor people kicked you out of
the employ for. Is that what you call getting on? You shall get
on in the same way here if you aren’t careful &mdash;I can promise
you."</p>

<p>At this Sterne hung his head, thoughtful, perplexed, winking
hard at the deck. All his attempts to enter into confidential
relations with his owner had led of late to nothing better than
these dark threats of dismissal; and a threat of dismissal would
check him at once into a hesitating silence as though he were
not sure that the proper time for defying it had come. On this
occasion he seemed to have lost his tongue for a moment, and Massy,
getting in motion, heavily passed him by with an abortive attempt
at shouldering. Sterne defeated it by stepping aside. He turned
then swiftly, opening his mouth very wide as if to shout something
after the engineer, but seemed to think better of it.</p>

<p>Always&mdash;as he was ready to confess&mdash;on the lookout for an opening
to get on, it had become an instinct with him to watch the conduct
of his immediate superiors for something "that one could lay hold
of." It was his belief that no skipper in the world would keep
his command for a day if only the owners could be "made to know."
This romantic and naive theory had led him into trouble more than
once, but he remained incorrigible; and his character was so instinctively
disloyal that whenever he joined a ship the intention of ousting
his commander out of the berth and taking his place was always
present at the back of his head, as a matter of course. It filled
the leisure of his waking hours with the reveries of careful plans
and compromising discoveries&mdash;the dreams of his sleep with images
of lucky turns and favorable accidents. Skippers had been known
to sicken and die at sea, than which nothing could be better to
give a smart mate a chance of showing what he’s made of. They
also would tumble overboard sometimes: he had heard of one or
two such cases. Others again . . . But, as it were constitutionally,
he was faithful to the belief that the conduct of no single one
of them would stand the test of careful watching by a man who
"knew what’s what"  and who kept his eyes "skinned pretty well"
all the time.</p>

<p>After he had gained a permanent footing on board the Sofala he
allowed his perennial hope to rise high. To begin with, it was
a great advantage to have an old man for captain: the sort of
man besides who in the nature of things was likely to give up
the job before long from one cause or another. Sterne was greatly
chagrined, however, to notice that he did not seem anyway near
being past his work yet. Still, these old men go to pieces all
at once sometimes. Then there was the owner-engineer close at
hand to be impressed by his zeal and steadiness. Sterne never
for a moment doubted the obvious nature of his own merits (he
was really an excellent officer); only, nowadays, professional
merit alone does not take a man along fast enough. A chap must
have some push in him, and must keep his wits at work too to help
him forward. He made up his mind to inherit the charge of this
steamer if it was to be done at all; not indeed estimating the
command of the Sofala as a very great catch, but for the reason
that, out East especially, to make a start is everything, and
one command leads to another.</p>

<p>He began by promising himself to behave with great circumspection;
Massy’s somber and fantastic humors intimidated him as being outside
one’s usual sea experience; but he was quite intelligent enough
to realize almost from the first that he was there in the presence
of an exceptional situation. His peculiar prying imagination penetrated
it quickly; the feeling that there was in it an element which
eluded his grasp exasperated his impatience to get on. And so
one trip came to an end, then another, and he had begun his third
before he saw an opening by which he could step in with any sort
of effect. It had all been very queer and very obscure; something
had been going on near him, as if separated by a chasm from the
common life and the working routine of the ship, which was exactly
like the life and the routine of any other coasting steamer of
that class.</p>

<p>Then one day he made his discovery.</p>

<p>It came to him after all these weeks of watchful observation
and puzzled surmises, suddenly, like the long-sought solution
of a riddle that suggests itself to the mind in a flash. Not with
the same authority, however. Great heavens! Could it be that?
And after remaining thunderstruck for a few seconds he tried to
shake it off with self-contumely, as though it had been the product
of an unhealthy bias towards the Incredible, the Inexplicable,
the Unheard-of&mdash;the Mad!</p>

<p>This&mdash;the illuminating moment&mdash;had occurred the trip before,
on the return passage. They had just left a place of call on the
mainland called Pangu; they were steaming straight out of a bay.
To the east a massive headland closed the view, with the tilted
edges of the rocky strata showing through its ragged clothing
of rank bushes and thorny creepers. The wind had begun to sing
in the rigging; the sea along the coast, green and as if swollen
a little above the line of the horizon, seemed to pour itself
over, time after time, with a slow and thundering fall, into the
shadow of the leeward cape; and across the wide opening the nearest
of a group of small islands stood enveloped in the hazy yellow
light of a breezy sunrise; still farther out the hummocky tops
of other islets peeped out motionless above the water of the channels
between, scoured tumultuously by the breeze.</p>

<p>The usual track of the Sofala both going and returning on every
trip led her for a few miles along this reefinfested region. She
followed a broad lane of water, dropping astern, one after another,
these crumbs of the earth’s crust resembling a squadron of dismasted
hulks run in disorder upon a foul ground of rocks and shoals.
Some of these fragments of land appeared, indeed, no bigger than
a stranded ship; others, quite flat, lay awash like anchored rafts,
like ponderous, black rafts of stone; several, heavily timbered
and round at the base, emerged in squat domes of deep green foliage
that shuddered darkly all over to the flying touch of cloud shadows
driven by the sudden gusts of the squally season. The thunderstorms
of the coast broke frequently over that cluster; it turned then
shadowy in its whole extent; it turned more dark, and as if more
still in the play of fire; as if more impenetrably silent in the
peals of thunder; its blurred shapes vanished&mdash;dissolving utterly
at times in the thick rain&mdash;to reappear clear-cut and black in
the stormy light against the gray sheet of the cloud&mdash;scattered
on the slaty round table of the sea. Unscathed by storms, resisting
the work of years, unfretted by the strife of the world, there
it lay unchanged as on that day, four hundred years ago, when
first beheld by Western eyes from the deck of a high-pooped caravel.</p>

<p>It was one of these secluded spots that may be found on the busy
sea, as on land you come sometimes upon the clustered houses of
a hamlet untouched by men’s restlessness, untouched by their need,
by their thought, and as if forgotten by time itself. The lives
of uncounted generations had passed it by, and the multitudes
of seafowl, urging their way from all the points of the horizon
to sleep on the outer rocks of the group, unrolled the converging
evolutions of their flight in long somber streamers upon the glow
of the sky. The palpitating cloud of their wings soared and stooped
over the pinnacles of the rocks, over the rocks slender like spires,
squat like martello towers; over the pyramidal heaps like fallen
ruins, over the lines of bald bowlders showing like a wall of
stones battered to pieces and scorched by lightning&mdash;with the
sleepy, clear glimmer of water in every breach. The noise of their
continuous and violent screaming filled the air.</p>

<p>This great noise would meet the Sofala coming up from Batu Beru;
it would meet her on quiet evenings, a pitiless and savage clamor
enfeebled by distance, the clamor of seabirds settling to rest,
and struggling for a footing at the end of the day. No one noticed
it especially on board; it was the voice of their ship’s unerring
landfall, ending the steady stretch of a hundred miles. She had
made good her course, she had run her distance till the punctual
islets began to emerge one by one, the points of rocks, the hummocks
of earth . . . and the cloud of birds hovered&mdash;the restless cloud
emitting a strident and cruel uproar, the sound of the familiar
scene, the living part of the broken land beneath, of the outspread
sea, and of the high sky without a flaw.</p>

<p>But when the Sofala happened to close with the land after sunset
she would find everything very still there under the mantle of
the night. All would be still, dumb, almost invisible&mdash;but for
the blotting out of the low constellations occulted in turns behind
the vague masses of the islets whose true outlines eluded the
eye amongst the dark spaces of the heaven: and the ship’s three
lights, resembling three stars&mdash;the red and the green with the
white above&mdash;her three lights, like three companion stars wandering
on the earth, held their unswerving course for the passage at
the southern end of the group. Sometimes there were human eyes
open to watch them come nearer, traveling smoothly in the somber
void; the eyes of a naked fisherman in his canoe floating over
a reef. He thought drowsily: "Ha! The fire-ship that once in every
moon goes in and comes out of Pangu bay." More he did not know
of her. And just as he had detected the faint rhythm of the propeller
beating the calm water a mile and a half away, the time would
come for the Sofala to alter her course, the lights would swing
off him their triple beam&mdash;and disappear.</p>

<p>A few miserable, half-naked families, a sort of outcast tribe
of long-haired, lean, and wild-eyed people, strove for their living
in this lonely wilderness of islets, lying like an abandoned outwork
of the land at the gates of the bay. Within the knots and loops
of the rocks the water rested more transparent than crystal under
their crooked and leaky canoes, scooped out of the trunk of a
tree: the forms of the bottom undulated slightly to the dip of
a paddle; and the men seemed to hang in the air, they seemed to
hang inclosed within the fibers of a dark, sodden log, fishing
patiently in a strange, unsteady, pellucid, green air above the
shoals.</p>

<p>Their bodies stalked brown and emaciated as if dried up in the
sunshine; their lives ran out silently; the homes where they were
born, went to rest, and died&mdash;flimsy sheds of rushes and coarse
grass eked out with a few ragged mats&mdash;were hidden out of sight
from the open sea. No glow of their household fires ever kindled
for a seaman a red spark upon the blind night of the group: and
the calms of the coast, the flaming long calms of the equator,
the unbreathing, concentrated calms like the deep introspection
of a passionate nature, brooded awfully for days and weeks together
over the unchangeable inheritance of their children; till at last
the stones, hot like live embers, scorched the naked sole, till
the water clung warm, and sickly, and as if thickened, about the
legs of lean men with girded loins, wading thigh-deep in the pale
blaze of the shallows. And it would happen now and then that the
Sofala, through some delay in one of the ports of call, would
heave in sight making for Pangu bay as late as noonday.</p>

<p>Only a blurring cloud at first, the thin mist of her smoke would
arise mysteriously from an empty point on the clear line of sea
and sky. The taciturn fishermen within the reefs would extend
their lean arms towards the offing; and the brown figures stooping
on the tiny beaches, the brown figures of men, women, and children
grubbing in the sand in search of turtles’ eggs, would rise up,
crooked elbow aloft and hand over the eyes, to watch this monthly
apparition glide straight on, swerve off&mdash;and go by. Their ears
caught the panting of that ship; their eyes followed her till
she passed between the two capes of the mainland going at full
speed as though she hoped to make her way unchecked into the very
bosom of the earth.</p>

<p>On such days the luminous sea would give no sign of the dangers
lurking on both sides of her path. Everything remained still,
crushed by the overwhelming power of the light; and the whole
group, opaque in the sunshine,&mdash;the rocks resembling pinnacles,
the rocks resembling spires, the rocks resembling ruins; the forms
of islets resembling beehives, resembling mole-hills, the islets
recalling the shapes of haystacks, the contours of ivy-clad towers,&mdash;would
stand reflected together upside down in the unwrinkled water,
like carved toys of ebony disposed on the silvered plate-glass
of a mirror.</p>

<p>The first touch of blowing weather would envelop the whole at
once in the spume of the windward breakers, as if in a sudden
cloudlike burst of steam; and the clear water seemed fairly to
boil in all the passages. The provoked sea outlined exactly in
a design of angry foam the wide base of the group; the submerged
level of broken waste and refuse left over from the building of
the coast near by, projecting its dangerous spurs, all awash,
far into the channel, and bristling with wicked long spits often
a mile long: with deadly spits made of froth and stones.</p>

<p>And even nothing more than a brisk breeze&mdash;as on that morning,
the voyage before, when the Sofala left Pangu bay early, and Mr.
Sterne’s discovery was to blossom out like a flower of incredible
and evil aspect from the tiny seed of instinctive suspicion,&mdash;even
such a breeze had enough strength to tear the placid mask from
the face of the sea. To Sterne, gazing with indifference, it had
been like a revelation to behold for the first time the dangers
marked by the hissing livid patches on the water as distinctly
as on the engraved paper of a chart. It came into his mind that
this was the sort of day most favorable for a stranger attempting
the passage: a clear day, just windy enough for the sea to break
on every ledge, buoying, as it were, the channel plainly to the
sight; whereas during a calm you had nothing to depend on but
the compass and the practiced judgment of your eye. And yet the
successive captains of the Sofala had had to take her through
at night more than once. Nowadays you could not afford to throw
away six or seven hours of a steamer’s time. That you couldn’t.
But then use is everything, and with proper care . . . The channel
was broad and safe enough; the main point was to hit upon the
entrance correctly in the dark&mdash;for if a man got himself involved
in that stretch of broken water over yonder he would never get
out with a whole ship&mdash;if he ever got out at all.</p>

<p>This was Sterne’s last train of thought independent of the great
discovery. He had just seen to the securing of the anchor, and
had remained forward idling away a moment or two. The captain
was in charge on the bridge. With a slight yawn he had turned
away from his survey of the sea and had leaned his shoulders against
the fish davit.</p>

<p>These, properly speaking, were the very last moments of ease
he was to know on board the Sofala. All the instants that came
after were to be pregnant with purpose and intolerable with perplexity.
No more idle, random thoughts; the discovery would put them on
the rack, till sometimes he wished to goodness he had been fool
enough not to make it at all. And yet, if his chance to get on
rested on the discovery of "something wrong," he could not have
hoped for a greater stroke of luck.</p>
