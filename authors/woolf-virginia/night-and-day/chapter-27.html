<p>London, in the first days of spring, has buds that open and flowers
that suddenly shake their petals&mdash;white, purple, or crimson&mdash;in
competition with the display in the garden beds, although these
city flowers are merely so many doors flung wide in Bond Street
and the neighborhood, inviting you to look at a picture, or hear
a symphony, or merely crowd and crush yourself among all sorts
of vocal, excitable, brightly colored human beings. But, all the
same, it is no mean rival to the quieter process of vegetable
florescence. Whether or not there is a generous motive at the
root, a desire to share and impart, or whether the animation is
purely that of insensate fervor and friction, the effect, while
it lasts, certainly encourages those who are young, and those
who are ignorant, to think the world one great bazaar, with banners
fluttering and divans heaped with spoils from every quarter of
the globe for their delight.</p>

<p>As Cassandra Otway went about London provided with shillings
that opened turnstiles, or more often with large white cards that
disregarded turnstiles, the city seemed to her the most lavish
and hospitable of hosts. After visiting the National Gallery,
or Hertford House, or hearing Brahms or Beethoven at the Bechstein
Hall, she would come back to find a new person awaiting her, in
whose soul were imbedded some grains of the invaluable substance
which she still called reality, and still believed that she could
find. The Hilberys, as the saying is, "knew every one," and that
arrogant claim was certainly upheld by the number of houses which,
within a certain area, lit their lamps at night, opened their
doors after 3 p. m., and admitted the Hilberys to their dining-rooms,
say, once a month. An indefinable freedom and authority of manner,
shared by most of the people who lived in these houses, seemed
to indicate that whether it was a question of art, music, or government,
they were well within the gates, and could smile indulgently at
the vast mass of humanity which is forced to wait and struggle,
and pay for entrance with common coin at the door. The gates opened
instantly to admit Cassandra. She was naturally critical of what
went on inside, and inclined to quote what Henry would have said;
but she often succeeded in contradicting Henry, in his absence,
and invariably paid her partner at dinner, or the kind old lady
who remembered her grandmother, the compliment of believing that
there was meaning in what they said. For the sake of the light
in her eager eyes, much crudity of expression and some untidiness
of person were forgiven her. It was generally felt that, given
a year or two of experience, introduced to good dressmakers, and
preserved from bad influences, she would be an acquisition. Those
elderly ladies, who sit on the edge of ballrooms sampling the
stuff of humanity between finger and thumb and breathing so evenly
that the necklaces, which rise and fall upon their breasts, seem
to represent some elemental force, such as the waves upon the
ocean of humanity, concluded, a little smilingly, that she would
do. They meant that she would in all probability marry some young
man whose mother they respected.</p>

<p>William Rodney was fertile in suggestions. He knew of little
galleries, and select concerts, and private performances, and
somehow made time to meet Katharine and Cassandra, and to give
them tea or dinner or supper in his rooms afterwards. Each one
of her fourteen days thus promised to bear some bright illumination
in its sober text. But Sunday approached. The day is usually dedicated
to Nature. The weather was almost kindly enough for an expedition.
But Cassandra rejected Hampton Court, Greenwich, Richmond, and
Kew in favor of the Zoological Gardens. She had once trifled with
the psychology of animals, and still knew something about inherited
characteristics. On Sunday afternoon, therefore, Katharine, Cassandra,
and William Rodney drove off to the Zoo. As their cab approached
the entrance, Katharine bent forward and waved her hand to a young
man who was walking rapidly in the same direction.</p>

<p>"There’s Ralph Denham!" she exclaimed. "I told him to meet us
here,"  she added. She had even come provided with a ticket for
him. William’s objection that he would not be admitted was, therefore,
silenced directly. But the way in which the two men greeted each
other was significant of what was going to happen. As soon as
they had admired the little birds in the large cage William and
Cassandra lagged behind, and Ralph and Katharine pressed on rather
in advance. It was an arrangement in which William took his part,
and one that suited his convenience, but he was annoyed all the
same. He thought that Katharine should have told him that she
had invited Denham to meet them.</p>

<p>"One of Katharine’s friends," he said rather sharply. It was
clear that he was irritated, and Cassandra felt for his annoyance.
They were standing by the pen of some Oriental hog, and she was
prodding the brute gently with the point of her umbrella, when
a thousand little observations seemed, in some way, to collect
in one center. The center was one of intense and curious emotion.
Were they happy? She dismissed the question as she asked it, scorning
herself for applying such simple measures to the rare and splendid
emotions of so unique a couple. Nevertheless, her manner became
immediately different, as if, for the first time, she felt consciously
womanly, and as if William might conceivably wish later on to
confide in her. She forgot all about the psychology of animals,
and the recurrence of blue eyes and brown, and became instantly
engrossed in her feelings as a woman who could administer consolation,
and she hoped that Katharine would keep ahead with Mr. Denham,
as a child who plays at being grown-up hopes that her mother won’t
come in just yet, and spoil the game. Or was it not rather that
she had ceased to play at being grown-up, and was conscious, suddenly,
that she was alarmingly mature and in earnest?</p>

<p>There was still unbroken silence between Katharine and Ralph
Denham, but the occupants of the different cages served instead
of speech.</p>

<p>"What have you been doing since we met?" Ralph asked at length.</p>

<p>"Doing?" she pondered. "Walking in and out of other people’s
houses. I wonder if these animals are happy?" she speculated,
stopping before a gray bear, who was philosophically playing with
a tassel which once, perhaps, formed part of a lady’s parasol.</p>

<p>"I’m afraid Rodney didn’t like my coming," Ralph remarked.</p>

<p>"No. But he’ll soon get over that," she replied. The detachment
expressed by her voice puzzled Ralph, and he would have been glad
if she had explained her meaning further. But he was not going
to press her for explanations. Each moment was to be, as far as
he could make it, complete in itself, owing nothing of its happiness
to explanations, borrowing neither bright nor dark tints from
the future.</p>

<p>"The bears seem happy," he remarked. "But we must buy them a
bag of something. There’s the place to buy buns. Let’s go and
get them."  They walked to the counter piled with little paper
bags, and each simultaneously produced a shilling and pressed
it upon the young lady, who did not know whether to oblige the
lady or the gentleman, but decided, from conventional reasons,
that it was the part of the gentleman to pay.</p>

<p>"I wish to pay," said Ralph peremptorily, refusing the coin which
Katharine tendered. "I have a reason for what I do," he added,
seeing her smile at his tone of decision.</p>

<p>"I believe you have a reason for everything," she agreed, breaking
the bun into parts and tossing them down the bears’ throats, "but
I can’t believe it’s a good one this time. What is your reason?"</p>

<p>He refused to tell her. He could not explain to her that he was
offering up consciously all his happiness to her, and wished,
absurdly enough, to pour every possession he had upon the blazing
pyre, even his silver and gold. He wished to keep this distance
between them&mdash;the distance which separates the devotee from the
image in the shrine.</p>

<p>Circumstances conspired to make this easier than it would have
been, had they been seated in a drawing-room, for example, with
a tea-tray between them. He saw her against a background of pale
grottos and sleek hides; camels slanted their heavy-ridded eyes
at her, giraffes fastidiously observed her from their melancholy
eminence, and the pink-lined trunks of elephants cautiously abstracted
buns from her outstretched hands. Then there were the hothouses.
He saw her bending over pythons coiled upon the sand, or considering
the brown rock breaking the stagnant water of the alligators’
pool, or searching some minute section of tropical forest for
the golden eye of a lizard or the indrawn movement of the green
frogs’ flanks. In particular, he saw her outlined against the
deep green waters, in which squadrons of silvery fish wheeled
incessantly, or ogled her for a moment, pressing their distorted
mouths against the glass, quivering their tails straight out behind
them. Again, there was the insect house, where she lifted the
blinds of the little cages, and marveled at the purple circles
marked upon the rich tussore wings of some lately emerged and
semi-conscious butterfly, or at caterpillars immobile like the
knobbed twigs of a pale-skinned tree, or at slim green snakes
stabbing the glass wall again and again with their flickering
cleft tongues. The heat of the air, and the bloom of heavy flowers,
which swam in water or rose stiffly from great red jars, together
with the display of curious patterns and fantastic shapes, produced
an atmosphere in which human beings tended to look pale and to
fall silent.</p>

<p>Opening the door of a house which rang with the mocking and profoundly
unhappy laughter of monkeys, they discovered William and Cassandra.
William appeared to be tempting some small reluctant animal to
descend from an upper perch to partake of half an apple. Cassandra
was reading out, in her high-pitched tones, an account of this
creature’s secluded disposition and nocturnal habits. She saw
Katharine and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Here you are! Do prevent William from torturing this unfortunate
aye-aye."</p>

<p>"We thought we’d lost you," said William. He looked from one
to the other, and seemed to take stock of Denham’s unfashionable
appearance. He seemed to wish to find some outlet for malevolence,
but, failing one, he remained silent. The glance, the slight quiver
of the upper lip, were not lost upon Katharine.</p>

<p>"William isn’t kind to animals," she remarked. "He doesn’t know
what they like and what they don’t like."</p>

<p>"I take it you’re well versed in these matters, Denham," said
Rodney, withdrawing his hand with the apple.</p>

<p>"It’s mainly a question of knowing how to stroke them," Denham
replied.</p>

<p>"Which is the way to the Reptile House?" Cassandra asked him,
not from a genuine desire to visit the reptiles, but in obedience
to her new-born feminine susceptibility, which urged her to charm
and conciliate the other sex. Denham began to give her directions,
and Katharine and William moved on together.</p>

<p>"I hope you’ve had a pleasant afternoon," William remarked.</p>

<p>"I like Ralph Denham," she replied.</p>

<p>"Ca se voit," William returned, with superficial urbanity.</p>

<p>Many retorts were obvious, but wishing, on the whole, for peace,
Katharine merely inquired:</p>

<p>"Are you coming back to tea?"</p>

<p>"Cassandra and I thought of having tea at a little shop in Portland
Place," he replied. "I don’t know whether you and Denham would
care to join us."</p>

<p>"I’ll ask him," she replied, turning her head to look for him.
But he and Cassandra were absorbed in the aye-aye once more.</p>

<p>William and Katharine watched them for a moment, and each looked
curiously at the object of the other’s preference. But resting
his eye upon Cassandra, to whose elegance the dressmakers had
now done justice, William said sharply:</p>

<p>"If you come, I hope you won’t do your best to make me ridiculous."</p>

<p>"If that’s what you’re afraid of I certainly shan’t come," Katharine
replied.</p>

<p>They were professedly looking into the enormous central cage
of monkeys, and being thoroughly annoyed by William, she compared
him to a wretched misanthropical ape, huddled in a scrap of old
shawl at the end of a pole, darting peevish glances of suspicion
and distrust at his companions. Her tolerance was deserting her.
The events of the past week had worn it thin. She was in one of
those moods, perhaps not uncommon with either sex, when the other
becomes very clearly distinguished, and of contemptible baseness,
so that the necessity of association is degrading, and the tie,
which at such moments is always extremely close, drags like a
halter round the neck. William’s exacting demands and his jealousy
had pulled her down into some horrible swamp of her nature where
the primeval struggle between man and woman still rages.</p>

<p>"You seem to delight in hurting me," William persisted. "Why
did you say that just now about my behavior to animals?" As he
spoke he rattled his stick against the bars of the cage, which
gave his words an accompaniment peculiarly exasperating to Katharine’s
nerves.</p>

<p>"Because it’s true. You never see what any one feels," she said.
"You think of no one but yourself."</p>

<p>"That is not true," said William. By his determined rattling
he had now collected the animated attention of some half-dozen
apes. Either to propitiate them, or to show his consideration
for their feelings, he proceeded to offer them the apple which
he held.</p>

<p>The sight, unfortunately, was so comically apt in its illustration
of the picture in her mind, the ruse was so transparent, that
Katharine was seized with laughter. She laughed uncontrollably.
William flushed red. No display of anger could have hurt his feelings
more profoundly. It was not only that she was laughing at him;
the detachment of the sound was horrible.</p>

<p>"I don’t know what you’re laughing at," he muttered, and, turning,
found that the other couple had rejoined them. As if the matter
had been privately agreed upon, the couples separated once more,
Katharine and Denham passing out of the house without more than
a perfunctory glance round them. Denham obeyed what seemed to
be Katharine’s wish in thus making haste. Some change had come
over her. He connected it with her laughter, and her few words
in private with Rodney; he felt that she had become unfriendly
to him. She talked, but her remarks were indifferent, and when
he spoke her attention seemed to wander. This change of mood was
at first extremely disagreeable to him; but soon he found it salutary.
The pale drizzling atmosphere of the day affected him, also. The
charm, the insidious magic in which he had luxuriated, were suddenly
gone; his feeling had become one of friendly respect, and to his
great pleasure he found himself thinking spontaneously of the
relief of finding himself alone in his room that night. In his
surprise at the suddenness of the change, and at the extent of
his freedom, he bethought him of a daring plan, by which the ghost
of Katharine could be more effectually exorcised than by mere
abstinence. He would ask her to come home with him to tea. He
would force her through the mill of family life; he would place
her in a light unsparing and revealing. His family would find
nothing to admire in her, and she, he felt certain, would despise
them all, and this, too, would help him. He felt himself becoming
more and more merciless towards her. By such courageous measures
any one, he thought, could end the absurd passions which were
the cause of so much pain and waste. He could foresee a time when
his experiences, his discovery, and his triumph were made available
for younger brothers who found themselves in the same predicament.
He looked at his watch, and remarked that the gardens would soon
be closed.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," he added, "I think we’ve seen enough for one afternoon.
Where have the others got to?" He looked over his shoulder, and,
seeing no trace of them, remarked at once:</p>

<p>"We’d better be independent of them. The best plan will be for
you to come back to tea with me."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn’t you come with me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Because we’re next door to Highgate here," he replied promptly.</p>

<p>She assented, having very little notion whether Highgate was
next door to Regent’s Park or not. She was only glad to put off
her return to the family tea-table in Chelsea for an hour or two.
They proceeded with dogged determination through the winding roads
of Regent’s Park, and the Sunday-stricken streets of the neighborhood,
in the direction of the Tube station. Ignorant of the way, she
resigned herself entirely to him, and found his silence a convenient
cover beneath which to continue her anger with Rodney.</p>

<p>When they stepped out of the train into the still grayer gloom
of Highgate, she wondered, for the first time, where he was taking
her. Had he a family, or did he live alone in rooms? On the whole
she was inclined to believe that he was the only son of an aged,
and possibly invalid, mother. She sketched lightly, upon the blank
vista down which they walked, the little white house and the tremulous
old lady rising from behind her tea-table to greet her with faltering
words about "my son’s friends," and was on the point of asking
Ralph to tell her what she might expect, when he jerked open one
of the infinite number of identical wooden doors, and led her
up a tiled path to a porch in the Alpine style of architecture.
As they listened to the shaking of the bell in the basement, she
could summon no vision to replace the one so rudely destroyed.</p>

<p>"I must warn you to expect a family party," said Ralph. "They’re
mostly in on Sundays. We can go to my room afterwards."</p>

<p>"Have you many brothers and sisters?" she asked, without concealing
her dismay.</p>

<p>"Six or seven," he replied grimly, as the door opened.</p>

<p>While Ralph took off his coat, she had time to notice the ferns
and photographs and draperies, and to hear a hum, or rather a
babble, of voices talking each other down, from the sound of them.
The rigidity of extreme shyness came over her. She kept as far
behind Denham as she could, and walked stiffly after him into
a room blazing with unshaded lights, which fell upon a number
of people, of different ages, sitting round a large dining-room
table untidily strewn with food, and unflinchingly lit up by incandescent
gas. Ralph walked straight to the far end of the table.</p>

<p>"Mother, this is Miss Hilbery," he said.</p>

<p>A large elderly lady, bent over an unsatisfactory spirit-lamp,
looked up with a little frown, and observed:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. I thought you were one of my own girls. Dorothy," 
she continued on the same breath, to catch the servant before
she left the room, "we shall want some more methylated spirits&mdash;unless
the lamp itself is out of order. If one of you could invent a
good spirit-lamp&mdash;"  she sighed, looking generally down the table,
and then began seeking among the china before her for two clean
cups for the new-comers.</p>

<p>The unsparing light revealed more ugliness than Katharine had
seen in one room for a very long time. It was the ugliness of
enormous folds of brown material, looped and festooned, of plush
curtains, from which depended balls and fringes, partially concealing
bookshelves swollen with black school-texts. Her eye was arrested
by crossed scabbards of fretted wood upon the dull green wall,
and whereever there was a high flat eminence, some fern waved
from a pot of crinkled china, or a bronze horse reared so high
that the stump of a tree had to sustain his forequarters. The
waters of family life seemed to rise and close over her head,
and she munched in silence.</p>

<p>At length Mrs. Denham looked up from her teacups and remarked:</p>

<p>"You see, Miss Hilbery, my children all come in at different
hours and want different things. (The tray should go up if you’ve
done, Johnnie.) My boy Charles is in bed with a cold. What else
can you expect?&mdash;standing in the wet playing football. We did
try drawing-room tea, but it didn’t do."</p>

<p>A boy of sixteen, who appeared to be Johnnie, grumbled derisively
both at the notion of drawing-room tea and at the necessity of
carrying a tray up to his brother. But he took himself off, being
enjoined by his mother to mind what he was doing, and shut the
door after him.</p>

<p>"It’s much nicer like this," said Katharine, applying herself
with determination to the dissection of her cake; they had given
her too large a slice. She knew that Mrs. Denham suspected her
of critical comparisons. She knew that she was making poor progress
with her cake. Mrs. Denham had looked at her sufficiently often
to make it clear to Katharine that she was asking who this young
woman was, and why Ralph had brought her to tea with them. There
was an obvious reason, which Mrs. Denham had probably reached
by this time. Outwardly, she was behaving with rather rusty and
laborious civility. She was making conversation about the amenities
of Highgate, its development and situation.</p>

<p>"When I first married," she said, "Highgate was quite separate
from London, Miss Hilbery, and this house, though you wouldn’t
believe it, had a view of apple orchards. That was before the
Middletons built their house in front of us."</p>

<p>"It must be a great advantage to live at the top of a hill,"
said Katharine. Mrs. Denham agreed effusively, as if her opinion
of Katharine’s sense had risen.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, we find it very healthy," she said, and she went
on, as people who live in the suburbs so often do, to prove that
it was healthier, more convenient, and less spoilt than any suburb
round London. She spoke with such emphasis that it was quite obvious
that she expressed unpopular views, and that her children disagreed
with her.</p>

<p>"The ceiling’s fallen down in the pantry again," said Hester,
a girl of eighteen, abruptly.</p>

<p>"The whole house will be down one of these days," James muttered.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Mrs. Denham. "It’s only a little bit of plaster
&mdash;I don’t see how any house could be expected to stand the
wear and tear you give it." Here some family joke exploded, which
Katharine could not follow. Even Mrs. Denham laughed against her
will.</p>

<p>"Miss Hilbery’s thinking us all so rude," she added reprovingly.
Miss Hilbery smiled and shook her head, and was conscious that
a great many eyes rested upon her, for a moment, as if they would
find pleasure in discussing her when she was gone. Owing, perhaps,
to this critical glance, Katharine decided that Ralph Denham’s
family was commonplace, unshapely, lacking in charm, and fitly
expressed by the hideous nature of their furniture and decorations.
She glanced along a mantelpiece ranged with bronze chariots, silver
vases, and china ornaments that were either facetious or eccentric.</p>

<p>She did not apply her judgment consciously to Ralph, but when
she looked at him, a moment later, she rated him lower than at
any other time of their acquaintanceship.</p>

<p>He had made no effort to tide over the discomforts of her introduction,
and now, engaged in argument with his brother, apparently forgot
her presence. She must have counted upon his support more than
she realized, for this indifference, emphasized, as it was, by
the insignificant commonplace of his surroundings, awoke her,
not only to that ugliness, but to her own folly. She thought of
one scene after another in a few seconds, with that shudder which
is almost a blush. She had believed him when he spoke of friendship.
She had believed in a spiritual light burning steadily and steadfastly
behind the erratic disorder and incoherence of life. The light
was now gone out, suddenly, as if a sponge had blotted it. The
litter of the table and the tedious but exacting conversation
of Mrs. Denham remained: they struck, indeed, upon a mind bereft
of all defences, and, keenly conscious of the degradation which
is the result of strife whether victorious or not, she thought
gloomily of her loneliness, of life’s futility, of the barren
prose of reality, of William Rodney, of her mother, and the unfinished
book.</p>

<p>Her answers to Mrs. Denham were perfunctory to the verge of rudeness,
and to Ralph, who watched her narrowly, she seemed further away
than was compatible with her physical closeness. He glanced at
her, and ground out further steps in his argument, determined
that no folly should remain when this experience was over. Next
moment, a silence, sudden and complete, descended upon them all.
The silence of all these people round the untidy table was enormous
and hideous; something horrible seemed about to burst from it,
but they endured it obstinately. A second later the door opened
and there was a stir of relief; cries of "Hullo, Joan! There’s
nothing left for you to eat," broke up the oppressive concentration
of so many eyes upon the table-cloth, and set the waters of family
life dashing in brisk little waves again. It was obvious that
Joan had some mysterious and beneficent power upon her family.
She went up to Katharine as if she had heard of her, and was very
glad to see her at last. She explained that she had been visiting
an uncle who was ill, and that had kept her. No, she hadn’t had
any tea, but a slice of bread would do. Some one handed up a hot
cake, which had been keeping warm in the fender; she sat down
by her mother’s side, Mrs. Denham’s anxieties seemed to relax,
and every one began eating and drinking, as if tea had begun over
again. Hester voluntarily explained to Katharine that she was
reading to pass some examination, because she wanted more than
anything in the whole world to go to Newnham.</p>

<p>"Now, just let me hear you decline ‘amo’ &mdash;I love," Johnnie
demanded.</p>

<p>"No, Johnnie, no Greek at meal-times," said Joan, overhearing
him instantly. "She’s up at all hours of the night over her books,
Miss Hilbery, and I’m sure that’s not the way to pass examinations,"
she went on, smiling at Katharine, with the worried humorous smile
of the elder sister whose younger brothers and sisters have become
almost like children of her own.</p>

<p>"Joan, you don’t really think that ‘amo’ is Greek?" Ralph</p>

<p>asked.</p>

<p>"Did I say Greek? Well, never mind. No dead languages at tea-time.
My dear boy, don’t trouble to make me any toast&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or if you do, surely there’s the toasting-fork somewhere?" said
Mrs. Denham, still cherishing the belief that the bread-knife
could be spoilt. "Do one of you ring and ask for one," she said,
without any conviction that she would be obeyed. "But is Ann coming
to be with Uncle Joseph?" she continued. "If so, surely they had
better send Amy to us&mdash;" and in the mysterious delight of learning
further details of these arrangements, and suggesting more sensible
plans of her own, which, from the aggrieved way in which she spoke,
she did not seem to expect any one to adopt, Mrs. Denham completely
forgot the presence of a well-dressed visitor, who had to be informed
about the amenities of Highgate. As soon as Joan had taken her
seat, an argument had sprung up on either side of Katharine, as
to whether the Salvation Army has any right to play hymns at street
corners on Sunday mornings, thereby making it impossible for James
to have his sleep out, and tampering with the rights of individual
liberty.</p>

<p>"You see, James likes to lie in bed and sleep like a hog," said
Johnnie, explaining himself to Katharine, whereupon James fired
up and, making her his goal, also exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Because Sundays are my one chance in the week of having my sleep
out. Johnnie messes with stinking chemicals in the pantry&mdash;"</p>

<p>They appealed to her, and she forgot her cake and began to laugh
and talk and argue with sudden animation. The large family seemed
to her so warm and various that she forgot to censure them for
their taste in pottery. But the personal question between James
and Johnnie merged into some argument already, apparently, debated,
so that the parts had been distributed among the family, in which
Ralph took the lead; and Katharine found herself opposed to him
and the champion of Johnnie’s cause, who, it appeared, always
lost his head and got excited in argument with Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that’s what I mean. She’s got it right," he exclaimed,
after Katharine had restated his case, and made it more precise.
The debate was left almost solely to Katharine and Ralph. They
looked into each other’s eyes fixedly, like wrestlers trying to
see what movement is coming next, and while Ralph spoke, Katharine
bit her lower lip, and was always ready with her next point as
soon as he had done. They were very well matched, and held the
opposite views.</p>

<p>But at the most exciting stage of the argument, for no reason
that Katharine could see, all chairs were pushed back, and one
after another the Denham family got up and went out of the door,
as if a bell had summoned them. She was not used to the clockwork
regulations of a large family. She hesitated in what she was saying,
and rose. Mrs. Denham and Joan had drawn together and stood by
the fireplace, slightly raising their skirts above their ankles,
and discussing something which had an air of being very serious
and very private. They appeared to have forgotten her presence
among them. Ralph stood holding the door open for her.</p>

<p>"Won’t you come up to my room?" he said. And Katharine, glancing
back at Joan, who smiled at her in a preoccupied way, followed
Ralph upstairs. She was thinking of their argument, and when,
after the long climb, he opened his door, she began at once.</p>

<p>"The question is, then, at what point is it right for the individual
to assert his will against the will of the State."</p>

<p>For some time they continued the argument, and then the intervals
between one statement and the next became longer and longer, and
they spoke more speculatively and less pugnaciously, and at last
fell silent. Katharine went over the argument in her mind, remembering
how, now and then, it had been set conspicuously on the right
course by some remark offered either by James or by Johnnie.</p>

<p>"Your brothers are very clever," she said. "I suppose you’re
in the habit of arguing?"</p>

<p>"James and Johnnie will go on like that for hours," Ralph replied.
"So will Hester, if you start her upon Elizabethan dramatists."</p>

<p>"And the little girl with the pigtail?"</p>

<p>"Molly? She’s only ten. But they’re always arguing among themselves."</p>

<p>He was immensely pleased by Katharine’s praise of his brothers
and sisters. He would have liked to go on telling her about them,
but he checked himself.</p>

<p>"I see that it must be difficult to leave them," Katharine continued.
His deep pride in his family was more evident to him, at that
moment, than ever before, and the idea of living alone in a cottage
was ridiculous. All that brotherhood and sisterhood, and a common
childhood in a common past mean, all the stability, the unambitious
comradeship, and tacit understanding of family life at its best,
came to his mind, and he thought of them as a company, of which
he was the leader, bound on a difficult, dreary, but glorious
voyage. And it was Katharine who had opened his eyes to this,
he thought.</p>

<p>A little dry chirp from the corner of the room now roused her
attention.</p>

<p>"My tame rook," he explained briefly. "A cat had bitten one of
its legs." She looked at the rook, and her eyes went from one
object to another.</p>

<p>"You sit here and read?" she said, her eyes resting upon his
books. He said that he was in the habit of working there at night.</p>

<p>"The great advantage of Highgate is the view over London. At
night the view from my window is splendid." He was extremely anxious
that she should appreciate his view, and she rose to see what
was to be seen. It was already dark enough for the turbulent haze
to be yellow with the light of street lamps, and she tried to
determine the quarters of the city beneath her. The sight of her
gazing from his window gave him a peculiar satisfaction. When
she turned, at length, he was still sitting motionless in his
chair.</p>

<p>"It must be late," she said. "I must be going." She settled upon
the arm of the chair irresolutely, thinking that she had no wish
to go home. William would be there, and he would find some way
of making things unpleasant for her, and the memory of their quarrel
came back to her. She had noticed Ralph’s coldness, too. She looked
at him, and from his fixed stare she thought that he must be working
out some theory, some argument. He had thought, perhaps, of some
fresh point in his position, as to the bounds of personal liberty.
She waited, silently, thinking about liberty.</p>

<p>"You’ve won again," he said at last, without moving.</p>

<p>"I’ve won?" she repeated, thinking of the argument.</p>

<p>"I wish to God I hadn’t asked you here," he burst out.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"When you’re here, it’s different &mdash;I’m happy. You’ve only
to walk to the window&mdash;you’ve only to talk about liberty. When
I saw you down there among them all&mdash;" He stopped short.</p>

<p>"You thought how ordinary I was."</p>

<p>"I tried to think so. But I thought you more wonderful than ever."</p>

<p>An immense relief, and a reluctance to enjoy that relief, conflicted
in her heart.</p>

<p>She slid down into the chair.</p>

<p>"I thought you disliked me," she said.</p>

<p>"God knows I tried," he replied. "I’ve done my best to see you
as you are, without any of this damned romantic nonsense. That
was why I asked you here, and it’s increased my folly. When you’re
gone I shall look out of that window and think of you. I shall
waste the whole evening thinking of you. I shall waste my whole
life, I believe."</p>

<p>He spoke with such vehemence that her relief disappeared; she
frowned; and her tone changed to one almost of severity.</p>

<p>"This is what I foretold. We shall gain nothing but unhappiness.
Look at me, Ralph." He looked at her. "I assure you that I’m far
more ordinary than I appear. Beauty means nothing whatever. In
fact, the most beautiful women are generally the most stupid.
I’m not that, but I’m a matter-of-fact, prosaic, rather ordinary
character; I order the dinner, I pay the bills, I do the accounts,
I wind up the clock, and I never look at a book."</p>

<p>"You forget&mdash;" he began, but she would not let him speak.</p>

<p>"You come and see me among flowers and pictures, and think me
mysterious, romantic, and all the rest of it. Being yourself very
inexperienced and very emotional, you go home and invent a story
about me, and now you can’t separate me from the person you’ve
imagined me to be. You call that, I suppose, being in love; as
a matter of fact it’s being in delusion. All romantic people are
the same," she added. "My mother spends her life in making stories
about the people she’s fond of. But I won’t have you do it about
me, if I can help it."</p>

<p>"You can’t help it," he said.</p>

<p>"I warn you it’s the source of all evil."</p>

<p>"And of all good," he added.</p>

<p>"You’ll find out that I’m not what you think me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But I shall gain more than I lose."</p>

<p>"If such gain’s worth having."</p>

<p>They were silent for a space.</p>

<p>"That may be what we have to face," he said. "There may be nothing
else. Nothing but what we imagine."</p>

<p>"The reason of our loneliness," she mused, and they were silent
for a time.</p>

<p>"When are you to be married?" he asked abruptly, with a change
of tone.</p>

<p>"Not till September, I think. It’s been put off."</p>

<p>"You won’t be lonely then," he said. "According to what people
say, marriage is a very queer business. They say it’s different
from anything else. It may be true. I’ve known one or two cases
where it seems to be true." He hoped that she would go on with
the subject. But she made no reply. He had done his best to master
himself, and his voice was sufficiently indifferent, but her silence
tormented him. She would never speak to him of Rodney of her own
accord, and her reserve left a whole continent of her soul in
darkness.</p>

<p>"It may be put off even longer than that," she said, as if by
an afterthought. "Some one in the office is ill, and William has
to take his place. We may put it off for some time in fact."</p>

<p>"That’s rather hard on him, isn’t it?" Ralph asked.</p>

<p>"He has his work," she replied. "He has lots of things that interest
him.... I know I’ve been to that place," she broke off, pointing
to a photograph. "But I can’t remember where it is&mdash;oh, of course
it’s Oxford. Now, what about your cottage?"</p>

<p>"I’m not going to take it."</p>

<p>"How you change your mind!" she smiled.</p>

<p>"It’s not that," he said impatiently. "It’s that I want to be
where I can see you."</p>

<p>"Our compact is going to hold in spite of all I’ve said?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"For ever, so far as I’m concerned," he replied.</p>

<p>"You’re going to go on dreaming and imagining and making up stories
about me as you walk along the street, and pretending that we’re
riding in a forest, or landing on an island&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. I shall think of you ordering dinner, paying bills, doing
the accounts, showing old ladies the relics&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That’s better," she said. "You can think of me to-morrow morning
looking up dates in the ‘Dictionary of National Biography.’"</p>

<p>"And forgetting your purse," Ralph added.</p>

<p>At this she smiled, but in another moment her smile faded, either
because of his words or of the way in which he spoke them. She
was capable of forgetting things. He saw that. But what more did
he see? Was he not looking at something she had never shown to
anybody? Was it not something so profound that the notion of his
seeing it almost shocked her? Her smile faded, and for a moment
she seemed upon the point of speaking, but looking at him in silence,
with a look that seemed to ask what she could not put into words,
she turned and bade him good night.</p>
