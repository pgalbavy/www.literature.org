<p><em>THERE </em>could be no doubt of the truth of the startling
declaration of Bell Rickard. He had no object in deceiving the
trapper, for his failure to produce Nick Ribsam deprived him of
the liberal ransom agreed upon by the representative of Herbert
Watrous.</p>

<p>He stated that he had told his prisoner of the plan he had in
view, so that the youth might be relieved of all dread of violence
or harm, and could be content to abandon whatever plans he had
in mind of escape. He assured him that, even if he succeeded in
getting away, he would be in greater danger than ever, since the
chances were against his finding his friends, while the Apaches
were quite sure to find him.</p>

<p>Nick seemed to be impressed with this view, and Rickard and Slidham
concluded that he meant to wait patiently for his release by the
method explained to him. It now looked as if Nick had succeeded
in outwitting his captors, after all, and that his apparent resignation
was meant to deceive them into relaxing their watchfulness.</p>

<p>Although the two men and boy were observed by Kimmaho and his
warriors as they rode up to the adobe structure, they were able
to enter and secure the massive door before the Apaches could
interfere. Rickard assured Nick that it was a fortunate thing
for them, since they would have been badly caught but for the
refuge, where they could laugh at the enmity of ten times that
number of warriors.</p>

<p>If the criminal had felt any misgivings as to the intentions
of Nick, they were removed by this time; for, after having refused
all the chances offered him, who would suppose that he would place
himself in the most imminent peril possible from the Apaches,
when he had no knowledge that his friends were within a hundred
miles?</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was gone. When Rickard found the trapper at the
door, he asked Nick to remain in another part of the building
until the interview was over. It struck him that it was better
that he should not listen to the negotiations, though he was willing
to bring him forward when asked to do so.</p>

<p>The criminal indicated no particular one of the dozen apartments
opening on the courtyard, several of which were intended for the
use of horses. The front of the building consisted of two stories,
with four large rooms, but the other portion was only a single
story in height.</p>

<p>When Eph asked for a few words with the boy, Rickard sent Slidham
out to bring him in. The man expected to find him at once, but
as he moved from one apartment to another, calling to him in a
suppressed voice and hearing nothing in reply, he began to fear
something was amiss. However, he completed the circuit, including
the four large apartments in front and the room where they had
placed their ponies.</p>

<p>Since he carried no light, it was easy for the youth to keep
out of sight; but Slidham could think of no reason for his doing
this, and he returned to his chief with the word that he believed
the prisoner had "vamosed the ranch." Deeming it incredible, Rickard
set out to make the search thorough. He carried no light, but
was fully supplied with matches, and he burned several in each
apartment, until he had scrutinized the entire interior, and made
sure the youth had not fallen asleep or was hiding.</p>

<p>It so happened that the stables were the last place visited.
Rickard was holding the tiny match above his head, anxiously awaiting
the moment when its light should reveal the whole interior, when
Slidham touched his arm, and, pointing at the ponies, whispered:</p>

<p>"There’s only <em>two</em> of them!"</p>

<p>"You’re right," replied the leader; "it’s his horse too that
is gone."</p>

<p>It was true: the faithful Jack that had stood by his master so
long was not in sight. All doubt was removed, and Rickard hastened
to where he had left Eph Bozeman and told the astounding news.</p>

<p>The criminal proved his earnestness by asking the trapper to
help him in repeating the search, and he did so, visiting every
room in the building, but without gaining sight of the missing
youth.</p>

<p>"Great guns!" exclaimed Eph, "how did we come to forgit it?"</p>

<p>He started on a run for the main door. The others were at his
heels, for they knew what the action meant. If Nick had stolen
out and galloped off, he must have left the entrance open for
anyone to enter. The instant the Apaches discovered it they would
swarm through, for, as has been shown, the presence of the few
white men within rendered them furiously eager to enter when otherwise
they would have cared not at all.</p>

<p>Even such a veteran as Eph Bozeman shuddered on reaching the
heavy doors to find them unfastened, so that a small child could
have passed through from the outside with no trouble.</p>

<p>"If the varmints had only knowed that!" he said, after helping
to secure it again.</p>

<p>This of course changed all the conditions and brought the men
in front of a new and alarming problem. Since they were assured
that Nick Ribsam, in spite of the danger from the Apaches, had
ridden out of the front of the building, and his present whereabouts
were unknown, beyond the simple fact that he was not present,
Eph Bozeman felt that he could not get back to his friends too
soon with the news, and decide upon an immediate line of action
to help the rash youth.</p>

<p>Rickard renewed his proposal that the others should dash into
the building and stay there until all danger passed. The Apaches
would be certain to discover them in the morning if not before,
and the three hunters and single youth could not maintain themselves
against Kimmaho and his band.</p>

<p>This offer would have been accepted without hesitation, but for
the desertion it forced of Nick Ribsam. The entire course of his
friends for days past was with the single view of helping him,
and it would not do to leave him now when his peril had been increased
a hundredfold.</p>

<p>But admitting all this, the question rose, as to what possible
way there was of aiding the young man, who had done that which
Eph Bozeman could not understand, after hearing so much of his
brightness.</p>

<p>Indeed, he more than half suspected that he had already fallen
into the hands of the Apaches. His own passing of their lines
was of the most difficult nature, as the reader has learned, and
it looked impossible for it to be done a second time, and by one
who knew so little of those subtle red men.</p>

<p>The fact that Nick was mounted ought to have been of great help
in the event of discovery, for his pony was as fleet as the fleetest
of the Apache steeds, but those ferocious raiders would find little
trouble in entrapping the boldest white man who ventured within
sight of them on so dark a night.</p>

<p>Be the conclusion what it may, the necessity of the trapper returning
to the Texans was obvious. He told Rickard that he would try it
at once, and no decision could be reached until after a talk with
them.</p>

<p>"If we agree to make a break for these quarters, it’ll be just
as it is growin’ light," said he.</p>

<p>"I’ll be on the lookout," replied Rickard, "and you can feel
certain there won’t be any trouble in gettin’ in."</p>

<p>With this understanding a careful survey was taken of the ground
immediately in front, and, nothing being seen of the Apaches,
the visitor stepped outside. He had spent several hours within
the building, and knew his friends were wondering at his long
absence, but he now did a thing for which there seemed no justification.</p>

<p>Fairly without the door, he moved aside a few paces, as if to
leave, but instead of doing so, stood motionless, with his back
against the outer wall. He was listening for something besides
Apache warriors, and by and by he heard it; it was the noise made
by Bell Rickard in refastening the heavy doors. He had waited
until he believed his caller was gone too far to return, when
he secured himself and companion against the common enemy.</p>

<p>The moment the door was locked Eph stepped noiselessly forward
and stooped down. It was too dark for him to see distinctly, but
he could feel as well as ever, and he passed his hands back and
forth over the earth, as if he had lost a valuable coin and was
searching for it through the sense of touch alone.</p>
