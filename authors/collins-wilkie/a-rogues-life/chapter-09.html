<P>
THE doctor (like me) had his shoes off. The doctor (like me) had
come in without making the least noise. He cocked the pistol
without saying a word. I felt that I was probably standing face
to face with death, and I too said not a word. We two Rogues
looked each other steadily and silently in the face--he, the
mighty and prosperous villain, with my life in his hands: I, the
abject and poor scamp, waiting his mercy.
<P>
It must have been at least a minute after I heard the click of
the cocked pistol before he spoke.
<P>
"How did you get here?" he asked.
<P>
The quiet commonplace terms in which he put his question, and the
perfect composure and politeness of his manner, reminded me a
little of Gentleman Jones. But the doctor was much the more
respectable-looking man of the two; his baldness was more
intellectual and benevolent; there was a delicacy and propriety
in the pulpiness of his fat white chin, a bland bagginess in his
unwhiskered cheeks, a reverent roughness about his eyebrows and a
fullness in his lower eyelids, which raised him far higher,
physiognomically speaking, in the social scale, than my old
prison acquaintance. Put a shovel-hat on Gentleman Jones, and the
effect would only have been eccentric; put the same covering on
the head of Doctor Dulcifer, and the effect would have been
strictly episcopal.
<P>
"How did you get here?" he repeated, still without showing the
least irritation.
<P>
I told him how I had got in at the second-floor window, without
concealing a word of the truth. The gravity of the situation, and
the sharpness of the doctor's intellects, as expressed in his
eyes, made anything like a suppression of facts on my part a
desperately dangerous experiment.
<P>
"You wanted to see what I was about up here, did you?" said he,
when I had ended my confession. "Do you know?"
<P>
The pistol barrel touched my cheek as he said the last words. I
thought of all the suspicious objects scattered about the room,
of the probability that he was only putting this question to try
my courage, of the very likely chance that he would shoot me
forthwith, if I began to prevaricate. I thought of these things,
and boldly answered:
<P>
"Yes, I do know."
<P>
He looked at me reflectively; then said, in low, thoughtful
tones, speaking, not to me, but entirely to himself:
<P>
"Suppose I shoot him?"
<P>
I saw in his eye, that if I flinched, he would draw the trigger.
<P>
"Suppose you trust me?" I said, without moving a muscle.
<P>
"I trusted you, as an honest man, downstairs, and I find you,
like a thief, up here," returned the doctor, with a
self-satisfied smile at the neatness of his own retort. "No," he
continued, relapsing into soliloquy: "there is risk every way;
but the least risk perhaps is to shoot him."
<P>
"Wrong," said I. "There are relations of mine who have a
pecuniary interest in my life. I am the main condition of a
contingent reversion in their favor. If I am missed, I shall be
inquired after." I have wondered since at my own coolness in the
face of the doctor's pistol; but my life depended on my keeping
my self-possession, and the desperate nature of the situation
lent me a desperate courage.
<P>
"How do I know you are not lying?" he asked.
<P>
"Have I not spoken the truth, hitherto?"
<P>
Those words made him hesitate. He lowered the pistol slowly to
his side. I began to breathe freely.
<P>
"Trust me," I repeated. "If you don't believe I would hold my
tongue about what I have seen here, for your sake, you may be
certain that I would for--"
<P>
"For my daughter's," he interposed, with a sarcastic smile.
<P>
I bowed with all imaginable cordiality. The doctor waved his
pistol in the air contemptuously.
<P>
"There are two ways of making you hold your tongue," he said.
"The first is shooting you; the second is making a felon of you.
On consideration, after what you have said, the risk in either
case seems about equal. I am naturally a humane man; your family
have done me no injury; I will not be the cause of their losing
money; I won't take your life, I'll have your character. We are
all felons on this floor of the house. You have come among
us--you shall be one of us. Ring that bell."
<P>
He pointed with the pistol to a bell-handle behind me. I pulled
it in silence.
<P>
Felon! The word has an ugly sound--a very ugly sound. But,
considering how near the black curtain had been to falling over
the adventurous drama of my life, had I any right to complain of
the prolongation of the scene, however darkly it might look at
first? Besides, some of the best feelings of our common nature
(putting out of all question the value which men so unaccountably
persist in setting on their own lives), impelled me, of
necessity, to choose the alternative of felonious existence in
preference to that of respectable death. Love and Honor bade me
live to marry Alicia; and a sense of family duty made me shrink
from occasioning a loss of three thousand pounds to my
affectionate sister. Perish the far-fetched scruples which would
break the heart of one lovely woman, and scatter to the winds the
pin-money of another!
<P>
"If you utter one word in contradiction of anything I say when my
workmen come into the room," said the doctor, uncocking his
pistol as soon as I had rung the bell, "I shall change my mind
about leaving your life and taking your character. Remember that;
and keep a guard on your tongue."
<P>
The door opened, and four men entered. One was an old man whom I
had not seen before; in the other three I recognized the
workman-like footman, and the two sinister artisans whom I had
met at the house-gate. They all started, guiltily enough, at
seeing me.
<P>
"Let me introduce you," said the doctor, taking me by the arm.
"Old File and Young File, Mill and Screw--Mr. Frank Softly. We
have nicknames in this workshop, Mr. Softly, derived humorously
from our professional tools and machinery. When you have been
here long enough, you will get a nickname, too. Gentlemen," he
continued, turning to the workmen, "this is a new recruit, with a
knowledge of chemistry which will be useful to us. He is
perfectly well aware that the nature of our vocation makes us
suspicious of all newcomers, and he, therefore, desires to give
you practical proof that he is to be depended on, by making
half-a-crown immediately, and sending the same up, along with our
handiwork, directed in his own handwriting, to our estimable
correspondents in London. When you have all seen him do this of
his own free will, and thereby put his own life as completely
within the power of the law as we have put ours, you will know
that he is really one of us, and will be under no apprehensions
for the future. Take great pains with him, and as soon as he
turns out a tolerably neat article, from the simple flatted
plates, under your inspection, let me know. I shall take a few
hours' repose on my camp-bed in the study, and shall be found
there whenever you want me."
<P>
He nodded to us all round in the most friendly manner, and left
the room.
<P>
I looked with considerable secret distrust at the four gentlemen
who were to instruct me in the art of making false coin. Young
File was the workman-like footman; Old File was his father; Mill
and Screw were the two sinister artisans. The man of the company
whose looks I liked least was Screw. He had wicked little
twinkling eyes--and they followed me about treacherously whenever
I moved. "You and I, Screw, are likely to quarrel," I thought to
myself, as I tried vainly to stare him out of countenance.
<P>
I entered on my new and felonious functions forthwith. Resistance
was useless, and calling for help would have been sheer insanity.
It was midnight; and, even supposing the windows had not been
barred , the house was a mile from any human habitation.
Accordingly, I abandoned myself to fate with my usual
magnanimity. Only let me end in winning Alicia, and I am resigned
to the loss of whatever small shreds and patches of
respectability still hang about me--such was my philosophy. I
wish I could have taken higher moral ground with equally
consoling results to my own feelings.
<P>
The same regard for the well-being of society which led me to
abstain from entering into particulars on the subject of Old
Master-making, when I was apprenticed to Mr. Ishmael Pickup, now
commands me to be equally discreet on the kindred subject of
Half-Crown-making, under the auspices of Old File, Young File,
Mill, and Screw.
<P>
Let me merely record that I was a kind of machine in the hands of
these four skilled workmen. I moved from room to room, and from
process to process, the creature of their directing eyes and
guiding hands. I cut myself, I burned myself, I got speechless
from fatigue, and giddy from want of sleep. In short, the sun of
the new day was high in the heavens before it was necessary to
disturb Doctor Dulcifer. It had absolutely taken me almost as
long to manufacture a half-a-crown feloniously as it takes a
respectable man to make it honestly. This is saying a great deal;
but it is literally true for all that.
<P>
Looking quite fresh and rosy after his night's sleep, the doctor
inspected my coin with the air of a schoolmaster examining a
little boy's exercise; then handed it to Old File to put the
finished touches and correct the mistakes. It was afterward
returned to me. My own hand placed it in one of the rouleaux of
false half-crowns; and my own hand also directed the spurious
coin, when it had been safely packed up, to a certain London
dealer who was to be on the lookout for it by the next night's
mail. That done, my initiation was so far complete.
<P>
"I have sent for your luggage, and paid your bill at the inn,"
said the doctor; "of course in your name. You are now to enjoy
the hospitality that I could not extend to you before. A room
upstairs has been prepared for you. You are not exactly in a
state of confinement; but, until your studies are completed, I
think you had better not interrupt them by going out."
<P>
"A prisoner!" I exclaimed aghast.
<P>
"Prisoner is a hard word," answered the doctor. "Let us say, a
guest under surveillance."
<P>
"Do you seriously mean that you intend to keep me shut up in this
part of the house, at your will and pleasure?" I inquired, my
heart sinking lower and lower at every word I spoke.
<P>
"It is very spacious and airy," said the doctor; "as for the
lower part of the house, you would find no company there, so you
can't want to go to it."
<P>
"No company!" I repeated faintly.
<P>
"No. My daughter went away this morning for change of air and
scene, accompanied by my housekeeper. You look astonished, my
dear sir--let me frankly explain myself. While you were the
respectable son of Doctor Softly, and grandson of Lady
Malkinshaw, I was ready enough to let my daughter associate with
you, and should not have objected if you had married her off my
hands into a highly-connected family. Now, however, when you are
nothing but one of the workmen in my manufactory of money, your
social position is seriously altered for the worse; and, as I
could not possibly think of you for a son-in-law, I have
considered it best to prevent all chance of your communicating
with Alicia again, by sending her away from this house while you
are in it. You will be in it until I have completed certain
business arrangements now in a forward state of progress--after
that, you may go away if you please. Pray remember that you have
to thank yourself for the position you now stand in; and do me
the justice to admit that my conduct toward you is remarkably
straightforward, and perfectly natural under all the
circumstances."
<P>
These words fairly overwhelmed me. I did not even make an attempt
to answer them. The hard trials to my courage, endurance, and
physical strength, through which I had passed within the last
twelve hours, had completely exhausted all my powers of
resistance. I went away speechless to my own room; and when I
found myself alone there, burst out crying. Childish, was it not?
<P>
When I had been rested and strengthened by a few hours' sleep, I
found myself able to confront the future with tolerable calmness.
<P>
What would it be best for me to do? Ought I to attempt to make my
escape? I did not despair of succeeding; but when I began to
think of the consequences of success, I hesitated. My chief
object now was, not so much to secure my own freedom, as to find
my way to Alicia. I had never been so deeply and desperately in
love with her as I was now, when I knew she was separated from
me. Suppose I succeeded in escaping from the clutches of Doctor
Dulcifer--might I not be casting myself uselessly on the world,
without a chance of finding a single clew to trace her by?
Suppose, on the other hand, that I remained for the present in
the red-brick house--should I not by that course of conduct be
putting myself in the best position for making discoveries?
<P>
In the first place, there was the chance that Alicia might find
some secret means of communicating with me if I remained where I
was. In the second place, the doctor would, in all probability,
have occasion to write to his daughter, or would be likely to
receive letters from her; and, if I quieted all suspicion on my
account, by docile behavior, and kept my eyes sharply on the
lookout, I might find opportunities of surprising the secrets of
his writing-desk. I felt that I need be under no restraints of
honor with a man who was keeping me a prisoner, and who had made
an accomplice of me by threatening my life. Accordingly, while
resolving to show outwardly an amiable submission to my fate, I
determined at the same time to keep secretly on the watch, and to
take the very first chance of outwitting Doctor Dulcifer that
might happen to present itself. When we next met I was perfectly
civil to him. He was too well-bred a man not to match me on the
common ground of courtesy.
<P>
"Permit me to congratulate you," he said, "on the improvement in
your manner and appearance. You are beginning well, Francis. Go
on as you have begun."
