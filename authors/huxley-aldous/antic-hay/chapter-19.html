<p>After leaving Mr. Mercaptan, Lypiatt had gone straight home.
The bright day seemed to deride him. With its shining red omnibuses,
its parasols, its muslin girls, its young-leaved trees, its bands
at the street corners, it was too much of a garden party to be
tolerable. He wanted to be alone. He took a cab back to the studio.
He couldn’t afford it, of course; but what did that matter, what
did that matter now?</p>

<p>The cab drove slowly and as though with reluctance down the dirty
mews. He paid it off, opened his little door between the wide
stable doors, climbed the steep ladder of his stairs and was at
home. He sat down and tried to think.</p>

<p>"Death, death, death, death," he kept repeating to himself, moving
his lips as though he were praying. If he said the word often
enough, if he accustomed himself completely to the idea, death
would come almost by itself; he would know it already, while he
was still alive, he would pass almost without noticing out of
life into death. Into death, he thought, into death. Death like
a well. The stone falls, falls, second after second; and at last
there is a sound, a far-off, horrible sound of death and then
nothing more. The well at Carisbrooke, with a donkey to wind the
wheel that pulls up the bucket of water, of icy water.... He thought
for a long time of the well of death.</p>

<p>Outside in the mews a barrel-organ struck up the tune of ‘Where
do flies go in the winter-time?’ Lypiatt lifted his head to listen.
He smiled to himself. ‘Where <em>do</em> flies go?’ The question
asked itself with a dramatic, a tragical appositeness. At the
end of everything—the last ludicrous touch. He saw it all from
outside. He pictured himself sitting there alone, broken. He looked
at his hand lying limp on the table in front of him. It needed
only the stigma of the nail to make it the hand of a dead Christ.</p>

<p>There, he was making literature of it again. Even now. He buried
his face in his hands. His mind was full of twisted darkness,
of an unspeakable, painful confusion. It was too difficult, too
difficult.</p>

<p>The inkpot, he found when he wanted to begin writing, contained
nothing but a parched black sediment. He had been meaning for
days past to get some more ink; and he had always forgotten. He
would have to write in pencil.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," he wrote, "do you remember, Myra, that time
we went down into the country—you remember—under the Hog’s Back
at that little inn they were trying to make pretentious? ‘Hotel
Bull’—do you remember? How we laughed over the Hotel Bull! And
how we liked the country outside its doors! All the world in a
few square miles. Chalk-pits and blue butterflies on the Hog’s
Back. And at the foot of the hill, suddenly, the sand; the hard,
yellow sand with those queer caves, dug when and by what remote
villains at the edge of the Pilgrims’ Way? the fine grey sand
on which the heather of Puttenham Common grows. And the flagstaff
and the inscription marking the place where Queen Victoria stood
to look at the view. And the enormous sloping meadows round Compton
and the thick, dark woods. And the lakes, the heaths, the Scotch
firs at Cutt Mill. The forests of Shackleford. There was everything.
Do you remember how we enjoyed it all? I did, in any case. I was
happy during those three days. And I loved you, Myra. And I thought
you might, you might perhaps, some day, love me. You didn’t. And
my love has only brought me unhappiness. Perhaps it has been my
fault. Perhaps I ought to have known how to make you give me happiness.
You remember that wonderful sonnet of Michelangelo’s, where he
says that the loved woman is like a block of marble from which
the artist knows how to cut the perfect statue of his dreams.
If the statue turns out a bad one, if it’s death instead of love
that the lover gets—why, the fault lies in the artist and in the
lover, not in the marble, not in the beloved.</p>

<p>
Amor dunque non ha, ne tua beltate,<br/>
O fortuna, o durezza, o gran disdegno,<br/>
Del mio mal colpa, o mio destino, o sorte.

</p>
<p>
Se dentro del tuo cor morte e pietate<br/>
Porti in un tempo, e ch’l mio basso ingegno<br/>
Non sappia ardendo trarne altro che morte.

</p>
</div>
<p>Yes, it was my <em>basso ingegno</em>: my low genius which did
not know how to draw love from you, nor beauty from the materials
of which art is made. Ah, now you’ll smile to yourself and say:
Poor Casimir, he has come to admit that at last? Yes, yes, I have
come to admit everything. That I couldn’t paint, I couldn’t write,
I couldn’t make music. That I was a charlatan and a quack. That
I was a ridiculous actor of heroic parts who deserved to be laughed
at—and <em>was</em> laughed at. But then every man is ludicrous
if you look at him from outside, without taking into account what’s
going on in his heart and mind. You could turn Hamlet into an
epigrammatic farce with an inimitable scene when he takes his
adored mother in adultery. You could make the wittiest Guy de
Maupassant short story out of the life of Christ, by contrasting
the mad rabbi’s pretensions with his abject fate. It’s a question
of the point of view. Every one’s a walking farce and a walking
tragedy at the same time. The man who slips on a banana-skin and
fractures his skull describes against the sky, as he falls, the
most richly comical arabesque. And you, Myra—what do you suppose
the unsympathetic gossips say of you? What sort of a farce of
the Boulevards is your life in their eyes? For me, Myra, you seem
to move all the time through some nameless and incomprehensible
tragedy. For them you are what? Merely any sort of a wanton, with
amusing adventures. And what am I? A charlatan, a quack, a pretentious,
boasting, rhodomontading imbecile, incapable of painting anything
but vermouth posters. (Why did that hurt so terribly? I don’t
know. There was no reason why you shouldn’t think so if you wanted
to.) I was all that,—and grotesquely laughable. And very likely
your laughter was justified, your judgment was true. I don’t know.
I can’t tell. Perhaps I am a charlatan. Perhaps I’m insincere;
boasting to others, deceiving myself. I don’t know, I tell you.
Everything is confusion in my mind now. The whole fabric seems
to have tumbled to pieces; it lies in a horrible chaos. I can
make no order within myself. Have I lied to myself? have I acted
and postured the Great Man to persuade myself that I am one? have
I something in me, or nothing? have I ever achieved anything of
worth, anything that rhymed with my conceptions, my dreams (for
those were fine; of that, I <em>am</em> certain)? I look into
the chaos that is my soul and, I tell you, I don’t know, I don’t
know. But what I do know is that I’ve spent nearly twenty years
now playing the charlatan at whom you all laugh. That I’ve suffered,
in mind and in body too—almost from hunger, sometimes—in order
to play it. That I’ve struggled, that I’ve exultantly climbed
to the attack, that I’ve been thrown down—ah, many times!—that
I’ve picked myself up and started again. Well, I suppose all that’s
ludicrous, if you like to think of it that way. It is ludicrous
that a man should put himself to prolonged inconvenience for the
sake of something which doesn’t really exist at all. It’s exquisitely
comic, I can see. I can see it in the abstract, so to speak. But
in this particular case, you must remember I’m not a dispassionate
observer. And if I am overcome now, it is not with laughter. It
is with an indescribable unhappiness, with the bitterness of death
itself. Death, death, death. I repeat the word to myself, again
and again. I think of death, I try to imagine it, I hang over
it, looking down, where the stones fall and fall and there is
one horrible noise, and then silence again; looking down into
the well of death. It is so deep that there is no glittering eye
of water to be seen at the bottom. I have no candle to send down.
It is horrible, but I do not want to go on living. Living would
be worse than...."</p>

<p>Lypiatt was reaching out for another sheet of paper when he was
startled to hear the sound of feet on the stairs. He turned towards
the door. His heart beat with violence. He was filled with a strange
sense of apprehension. In terror he awaited the approach of some
unknown and terrible being. The feet of the angel of death were
on the stairs. Up, up, up. Lypiatt felt himself trembling as the
sound came nearer. He knew for certain that in a few seconds he
was going to die. The hangmen had already pinioned him; the soldiers
of the firing squad had already raised their rifles. One, two,
... he thought of Mrs. Viveash standing, bare-headed, the wind
blowing in her hair, at the foot of the flagstaff from the site
of which Queen Victoria had admired the distant view of Selborne;
he thought of her dolorously smiling; he remembered that once
she had taken his head between her two hands and kissed him: ‘Because
you’re such a golden ass,’ she had said, laughing. Three.... There
was a little tap at the door. Lypiatt pressed his hand over his
heart. The door opened.</p>

<p>A small, bird-like man with a long, sharp nose and eyes as round
and black and shining as buttons stepped into the room.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lydgate, I presume?" he began. Then looked at a card on
which a name and address were evidently written. "Lypiatt, I mean.
A thousand pardons. Mr. Lypiatt, I presume?"</p>

<p>Lypiatt leaned back in his chair and shut his eyes. His face
was as white as paper. He breathed hard and his temples were wet
with sweat, as though he had been running.</p>

<p>"I found the door down below open, so I came straight up. I hope
you’ll excuse...." The stranger smiled apologetically.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" Lypiatt asked, reopening his eyes. His heart was
still beating hard; after the storm it calmed itself slowly. He
drew back from the brink of the fearful well; the time had not
yet come to plunge.</p>

<p>"My name," said the stranger, "is Boldero, Herbert Boldero. Our
mutual friend Mr. Gumbril, Mr. Theodore Gumbril, junior," he made
it more precise, "suggested that I might come and see you about
a little matter in which he and I are interested and in which
perhaps you, too, might be interested."</p>

<p>Lypiatt nodded, without saying anything.</p>

<p>Mr. Boldero, meanwhile, was turning his bright, bird-like eyes
about the studio. Mrs. Viveash’s portrait, all but finished now,
was clamped to the easel. He approached it, a connoisseur.</p>

<p>"It reminds me very much," he said, "of Bacosso. Very much indeed,
if I may say so. Also a little of ..." he hesitated, trying to
think of the name of that other fellow Gumbril had talked about.
But being unable to remember the unimpressive syllables of Derain
he played for safety and said—"of Orpen." Mr. Boldero looked inquiringly
at Lypiatt to see if that was right.</p>

<p>Lypiatt still spoke no word and seemed, indeed, not to have heard
what had been said.</p>

<p>Mr. Boldero saw that it wasn’t much good talking about modern
art. This chap, he thought, looked as though something were wrong
with him. He hoped he hadn’t got influenza. There was a lot of
the disease about. "This little affair I was speaking of," he
pursued, in another tone, "is a little business proposition that
Mr. Gumbril and I have gone into together. A matter of pneumatic
trousers," he waved his hand airily.</p>

<p>Lypiatt suddenly burst out laughing, an embittered Titan. Where
do flies go? Where do souls go? The barrel-organ, and now pneumatic
trousers! Then, as suddenly, he was silent again. More literature?
Another piece of acting? "Go on," he said, "I’m sorry."</p>

<p>"Not at all, not at all," said Mr. Boldero indulgently. "I know
the idea does seem a little humorous, if I may say so, at first.
But I assure you, there’s money in it, Mr. Lydgate—Mr. Lypiatt.
Money!" Mr. Boldero paused a moment dramatically. "Well," he went
on, "our idea was to launch the new product with a good swingeing
publicity campaign. Spend a few thousands in the papers and then
get it good and strong into the Underground and on the hoardings,
along with Owbridge’s and John Bull and the Golden Ballot. Now,
for that, Mr. Lypiatt, we shall need, as you can well imagine,
a few good striking pictures. Mr. Gumbril mentioned your name
and suggested I should come and see you to find out if you would
perhaps be agreeable to lending us your talent for this work.
And I may add, Mr. Lypiatt," he spoke with real warmth, "that
having seen this example of your work"—he pointed to the portrait
of Mrs. Viveash—"I feel that you would be eminently capable of...."</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence; for at this moment Lypiatt leapt
up from his chair and, making a shrill, inarticulate, animal noise,
rushed on the financier, seized him with both hands by the throat,
shook him, threw him to the floor, then picked him up again by
the coat collar and pushed him towards the door, kicking him as
he went. A final kick sent Mr. Boldero tobogganing down the steep
stairs. Lypiatt ran down after him; but Mr. Boldero had picked
himself up, had opened the front door, slipped out, slammed it
behind him, and was running up the mews before Lypiatt could get
to the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p>Lypiatt opened the door and looked out. Mr. Boldero was already
far away, almost at the Piranesian arch. He watched him till he
was out of sight, then went upstairs again and threw himself face
downwards on his bed. </p>
