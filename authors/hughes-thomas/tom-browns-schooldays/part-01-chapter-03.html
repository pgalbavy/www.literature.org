<p>Poor old Benjy! The "rheumatiz" has much to answer for all through
English country-sides, but it never played a scurvier trick than
in laying thee by the heels, when thou wast yet in a green old
age. The enemy, which had long been carrying on a sort of border
warfare, and trying his strength against Benjy's on the battlefield
of his hands and legs, now, mustering all his forces, began laying
siege to the citadel, and overrunning the whole country. Benjy
was seized in the back and loins; and though he made strong and
brave fight, it was soon clear enough that all which could be
beaten of poor old Benjy would have to give in before long.</p>

<p>It was as much as he could do now, with the help of his big stick
and frequent stops, to hobble down to the canal with Master Tom,
and bait his hook for him, and sit and watch his angling, telling
him quaint old country stories; and when Tom had no sport, and
detecting a rat some hundred yards or so off along the bank, would
rush off with Toby the turnspit terrier, his other faithful companion,
in bootless pursuit, he might have tumbled in and been drowned
twenty times over before Benjy could have got near him.</p>

<p>Cheery and unmindful of himself, as Benjy was, this loss of locomotive
power bothered him greatly. He had got a new object in his old
age, and was just beginning to think himself useful again in the
world. He feared much, too, lest Master Tom should fall back again
into the hands of Charity and the women. So he tried everything
he could think of to get set up. He even went an expedition to
the dwelling of one of those queer mortals, who&mdash;say what we will,
and reason how we will&mdash;do cure simple people of diseases of one
kind or another without the aid of physic, and so get to themselves
the reputation of using charms, and inspire for themselves and
their dwellings great respect, not to say fear, amongst a simple
folk such as the dwellers in the Vale of White Horse. Where this
power, or whatever else it may be, descends upon the shoulders
of a man whose ways are not straight, he becomes a nuisance to
the neighbourhood&mdash;a receiver of stolen goods, giver of love-potions,
and deceiver of silly women&mdash;the avowed enemy of law and order,
of justices of the peace, head-boroughs, and gamekeepers,&mdash;such
a man, in fact, as was recently caught tripping, and deservedly
dealt with by the Leeds justices, for seducing a girl who had
come to him to get back a faithless lover, and has been convicted
of bigamy since then. Sometimes, however, they are of quite a
different stamp&mdash;men who pretend to nothing, and are with difficulty
persuaded to exercise their occult arts in the simplest cases.</p>

<p>Of this latter sort was old Farmer Ives, as he was called, the
"wise man" to whom Benjy resorted (taking Tom with him as usual),
in the early spring of the year next after the feast described
in the last chapter. Why he was called "farmer" I cannot say,
unless it be that he was the owner of a cow, a pig or two, and
some poultry, which he maintained on about an acre of land inclosed
from the middle of a wild common, on which probably his father
had squatted before lords of manors looked as keenly after their
rights as they do now. Here he had lived no one knew how long,
a solitary man. It was often rumoured that he was to be turned
out and his cottage pulled down, but somehow it never came to
pass; and his pigs and cow went grazing on the common, and his
geese hissed at the passing children and at the heels of the horse
of my lord's steward, who often rode by with a covetous eye on
the inclosure still unmolested. His dwelling was some miles from
our village; so Benjy, who was half ashamed of his errand, and
wholly unable to walk there, had to exercise much ingenuity to
get the means of transporting himself and Tom thither without
exciting suspicion. However, one fine May morning he managed to
borrow the old blind pony of our friend the publican, and Tom
persuaded Madam Brown to give him a holiday to spend with old
Benjy, and to lend them the Squire's light cart, stored with bread
and cold meat and a bottle of ale. And so the two in high glee
started behind old Dobbin, and jogged along the deep-rutted plashy
roads, which had not been mended after their winter's wear, towards
the dwelling of the wizard. About noon they passed the gate which
opened on to the large common, and old Dobbin toiled slowly up
the hill, while Benjy pointed out a little deep dingle on the
left, out of which welled a tiny stream. As they crept up the
hill the tops of a few birch-trees came in sight, and blue smoke
curling up through their delicate light boughs; and then the little
white thatched home and inclosed ground of Farmer Ives, lying
cradled in the dingle, with the gay gorse common rising behind
and on both sides; while in front, after traversing a gentle slope,
the eye might travel for miles and miles over the rich vale. They
now left the main road and struck into a green track over the
common marked lightly with wheel and horse-shoe, which led down
into the dingle and stopped at the rough gate of Farmer Ives.
Here they found the farmer, an iron-gray old man, with a bushy
eyebrow and strong aquiline nose, busied in one of his vocations.
He was a horse and cow doctor, and was tending a sick beast which
had been sent up to be cured. Benjy hailed him as an old friend,
and he returned the greeting cordially enough, looking however
hard for a moment both at Benjy and Tom, to see whether there
was more in their visit than appeared at first sight. It was a
work of some difficulty and danger for Benjy to reach the ground,
which, however, he managed to do without mishap; and then he devoted
himself to unharnessing Dobbin and turning him out for a graze
("a run" one could not say of that virtuous steed) on the common.
This done, he extricated the cold provisions from the cart, and
they entered the farmer's wicket; and he, shutting up the knife
with which he was taking maggots out of the cow's back and sides,
accompanied them towards the cottage. A big old lurcher got up
slowly from the door-stone, stretching first one hind leg and
then the other, and taking Tom's caresses and the presence of
Toby, who kept, however, at a respectful distance, with equal
indifference.</p>

<p>"Us be cum to pay 'ee a visit. I've a been long minded to do't
for old sake's sake, only I vinds I dwon't get about now as I'd
used to't. I be so plaguy bad wi' th' rheumatiz in my back." Benjy
paused, in hopes of drawing the farmer at once on the subject
of his ailments without further direct application.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see as you bean't quite so lissom as you was," replied
the farmer, with a grim smile, as he lifted the latch of his door;
"we bean't so young as we was, nother on us, wuss luck."</p>

<p>The farmer's cottage was very like those of the better class
of peasantry in general. A snug chimney corner with two seats,
and a small carpet on the hearth, an old flint gun and a pair
of spurs over the fireplace, a dresser with shelves on which some
bright pewter plates and crockeryware were arranged, an old walnut
table, a few chairs and settles, some framed samplers, and an
old print or two, and a bookcase with some dozen volumes on the
walls, a rack with flitches of bacon, and other stores fastened
to the ceiling, and you have the best part of the furniture. No
sign of occult art is to be seen, unless the bundles of dried
herbs hanging to the rack and in the ingle and the row of labelled
phials on one of the shelves betoken it.</p>

<p>Tom played about with some kittens who occupied the hearth, and
with a goat who walked demurely in at the open door&mdash;while their
host and Benjy spread the table for dinner&mdash;and was soon engaged
in conflict with the cold meat, to which he did much honour. The
two old men's talk was of old comrades and their deeds, mute inglorious
Miltons of the Vale, and of the doings thirty years back, which
didn't interest him much, except when they spoke of the making
of the canal; and then indeed he began to listen with all his
ears, and learned, to his no small wonder, that his dear and wonderful
canal had not been there always&mdash;was not, in fact, so old as Benjy
or Farmer Ives, which caused a strange commotion in his small
brain.</p>

<p>After dinner Benjy called attention to a wart which Tom had on
the knuckles of his hand, and which the family doctor had been
trying his skill on without success, and begged the farmer to
charm it away. Farmer Ives looked at it, muttered something or
another over it, and cut some notches in a short stick, which
he handed to Benjy, giving him instructions for cutting it down
on certain days, and cautioning Tom not to meddle with the wart
for a fortnight. And then they strolled out and sat on a bench
in the sun with their pipes, and the pigs came up and grunted
sociably and let Tom scratch them; and the farmer, seeing how
he liked animals, stood up and held his arms in the air, and gave
a call, which brought a flock of pigeons wheeling and dashing
through the birch-trees. They settled down in clusters on the
farmer's arms and shoulders, making love to him and scrambling
over one another's backs to get to his face; and then he threw
them all off, and they fluttered about close by, and lighted on
him again and again when he held up his arms. All the creatures
about the place were clean and fearless, quite unlike their relations
elsewhere; and Tom begged to be taught how to make all the pigs
and cows and poultry in our village tame, at which the farmer
only gave one of his grim chuckles.</p>

<p>It wasn't till they were just ready to go, and old Dobbin was
harnessed, that Benjy broached the subject of his rheumatism again,
detailing his symptoms one by one. Poor old boy! He hoped the
farmer could charm it away as easily as he could Tom's wart, and
was ready with equal faith to put another notched stick into his
other pocket, for the cure of his own ailments. The physician
shook his head, but nevertheless produced a bottle, and handed
it to Benjy, with instructions for use. "Not as 't'll do 'ee much
good&mdash;leastways I be afeard not," shading his eyes with his hand,
and looking up at them in the cart. "There's only one thing as
I knows on as'll cure old folks like you and I o' th' rheumatiz."</p>

<p>"Wot be that then, farmer?" inquired Benjy.</p>

<p>"Churchyard mould," said the old iron-gray man, with another
chuckle. And so they said their good-byes and went their ways
home. Tom's wart was gone in a fortnight, but not so Benjy's rheumatism,
which laid him by the heels more and more. And though Tom still
spent many an hour with him, as he sat on a bench in the sunshine,
or by the chimney corner when it was cold, he soon had to seek
elsewhere for his regular companions.</p>

<p>Tom had been accustomed often to accompany his mother in her
visits to the cottages, and had thereby made acquaintance with
many of the village boys of his own age. There was Job Rudkin,
son of widow Rudkin, the most bustling woman in the parish. How
she could ever have had such a stolid boy as Job for a child must
always remain a mystery. The first time Tom went to their cottage
with his mother, Job was not indoors; but he entered soon after,
and stood with both hands in his pockets, staring at Tom. Widow
Rudkin, who would have had to cross madam to get at young Hopeful&mdash;a
breach of good manners of which she was wholly incapable&mdash;began
a series of pantomime signs, which only puzzled him; and at last,
unable to contain herself longer, burst out with, "Job! Job! where's
thy cap?"</p>

<p>"What! bean't 'ee on ma head, mother?" replied Job, slowly extricating
one hand from a pocket, and feeling for the article in question;
which he found on his head sure enough, and left there, to his
mother's horror and Tom's great delight.</p>

<p>Then there was poor Jacob Dodson, the half-witted boy, who ambled
about cheerfully, undertaking messages and little helpful odds
and ends for every one, which, however, poor Jacob managed always
hopelessly to imbrangle. Everything came to pieces in his hands,
and nothing would stop in his head. They nicknamed him Jacob Doodle-calf.</p>

<p>But above all there was Harry Winburn, the quickest and best
boy in the parish. He might be a year older than Tom, but was
very little bigger, and he was the Crichton of our village boys.
He could wrestle and climb and run better than all the rest, and
learned all that the schoolmaster could teach him faster than
that worthy at all liked. He was a boy to be proud of, with his
curly brown hair, keen gray eye, straight active figure, and little
ears and hands and feet, "as fine as a lord's," as Charity remarked
to Tom one day, talking, as usual, great nonsense. Lords' hands
and ears and feet are just as ugly as other folk's when they are
children, as any one may convince himself if he likes to look.
Tight boots and gloves, and doing nothing with them, I allow make
a difference by the time they are twenty.</p>

<p>Now that Benjy was laid on the shelf, and his young brothers
were still under petticoat government, Tom, in search of companions,
began to cultivate the village boys generally more and more. Squire
Brown, be it said, was a true-blue Tory to the backbone, and believed
honestly that the powers which be were ordained of God, and that
loyalty and steadfast obedience were men's first duties. Whether
it were in consequence or in spite of his political creed, I do
not mean to give an opinion, though I have one; but certain it
is that he held therewith divers social principles not generally
supposed to be true blue in colour. Foremost of these, and the
one which the Squire loved to propound above all others, was the
belief that a man is to be valued wholly and solely for that which
he is in himself, for that which stands up in the four fleshly
walls of him, apart from clothes, rank, fortune, and all externals
whatsoever. Which belief I take to be a wholesome corrective of
all political opinions, and, if held sincerely, to make all opinions
equally harmless, whether they be blue, red, or green. As a necessary
corollary to this belief, Squire Brown held further that it didn't
matter a straw whether his son associated with lords' sons or
ploughmen's sons, provided they were brave and honest. He himself
had played football and gone bird-nesting with the farmers whom
he met at vestry and the labourers who tilled their fields, and
so had his father and grandfather, with their progenitors. So
he encouraged Tom in his intimacy with the boys of the village,
and forwarded it by all means in his power, and gave them the
run of a close for a playground, and provided bats and balls and
a football for their sports.</p>

<p>Our village was blessed amongst other things with a well-endowed
school. The building stood by itself, apart from the master's
house, on an angle of ground where three roads met&mdash;an old gray
stone building with a steep roof and mullioned windows. On one
of the opposite angles stood Squire Brown's stables and kennel,
with their backs to the road, over which towered a great elm-tree;
on the third stood the village carpenter and wheelwright's large
open shop, and his house and the schoolmaster's, with long low
eaves, under which the swallows built by scores.</p>

<p>The moment Tom's lessons were over, he would now get him down
to this corner by the stables, and watch till the boys came out
of school. He prevailed on the groom to cut notches for him in
the bark of the elm so that he could climb into the lower branches;
and there he would sit watching the school door, and speculating
on the possibility of turning the elm into a dwelling-place for
himself and friends, after the manner of the Swiss Family Robinson.
But the school hours were long and Tom's patience short, so that
he soon began to descend into the street, and go and peep in at
the school door and the wheelwright's shop, and look out for something
to while away the time. Now the wheelwright was a choleric man,
and one fine afternoon, returning from a short absence, found
Tom occupied with one of his pet adzes, the edge of which was
fast vanishing under our hero's care. A speedy flight saved Tom
from all but one sound cuff on the ears; but he resented this
unjustifiable interruption of his first essays at carpentering,
and still more the further proceedings of the wheelwright, who
cut a switch, and hung it over the door of his workshop, threatening
to use it upon Tom if he came within twenty yards of his gate.
So Tom, to retaliate, commenced a war upon the swallows who dwelt
under the wheelwright's eaves, whom he harassed with sticks and
stones; and being fleeter of foot than his enemy, escaped all
punishment, and kept him in perpetual anger. Moreover, his presence
about the school door began to incense the master, as the boys
in that neighbourhood neglected their lessons in consequence;
and more than once he issued into the porch, rod in hand, just
as Tom beat a hasty retreat. And he and the wheelwright, laying
their heads together, resolved to acquaint the Squire with Tom's
afternoon occupations; but in order to do it with effect, determined
to take him captive and lead him away to judgment fresh from his
evil doings. This they would have found some difficulty in doing,
had Tom continued the war single-handed, or rather single-footed,
for he would have taken to the deepest part of Pebbly Brook to
escape them; but, like other active powers, he was ruined by his
alliances. Poor Jacob Doodle-calf could not go to the school with
the other boys, and one fine afternoon, about three o'clock (the
school broke up at four), Tom found him ambling about the street,
and pressed him into a visit to the school-porch. Jacob, always
ready to do what he was asked, consented, and the two stole down
to the school together. Tom first reconnoitred the wheelwright's
shop; and seeing no signs of activity, thought all safe in that
quarter, and ordered at once an advance of all his troops upon
the schoolporch. The door of the school was ajar, and the boys
seated on the nearest bench at once recognized and opened a correspondence
with the invaders. Tom, waxing bold, kept putting his head into
the school and making faces at the master when his back was turned.
Poor Jacob, not in the least comprehending the situation, and
in high glee at finding himself so near the school, which he had
never been allowed to enter, suddenly, in a fit of enthusiasm,
pushed by Tom, and ambling three steps into the school, stood
there, looking round him and nodding with a self-approving smile.
The master, who was stooping over a boy's slate, with his back
to the door, became aware of something unusual, and turned quickly
round. Tom rushed at Jacob, and began dragging him back by his
smock-frock, and the master made at them, scattering forms and
boys in his career. Even now they might have escaped, but that
in the porch, barring retreat, appeared the crafty wheelwright,
who had been watching all their proceedings. So they were seized,
the school dismissed, and Tom and Jacob led away to Squire Brown
as lawful prize, the boys following to the gate in groups, and
speculating on the result.</p>

<p>The Squire was very angry at first, but the interview, by Tom's
pleading, ended in a compromise. Tom was not to go near the school
till three o'clock, and only then if he had done his own lessons
well, in which case he was to be the bearer of a note to the master
from Squire Brown; and the master agreed in such case to release
ten or twelve of the best boys an hour before the time of breaking
up, to go off and play in the close. The wheelwright's adzes and
swallows were to be for ever respected; and that hero and the
master withdrew to the servants' hall to drink the Squire's health,
well satisfied with their day's work.</p>

<p>The second act of Tom's life may now be said to have begun. The
war of independence had been over for some time: none of the women
now&mdash;not even his mother's maid&mdash;dared offer to help him in dressing
or washing. Between ourselves, he had often at first to run to
Benjy in an unfinished state of toilet. Charity and the rest of
them seemed to take a delight in putting impossible buttons and
ties in the middle of his back; but he would have gone without
nether integuments altogether, sooner than have had recourse to
female valeting. He had a room to himself, and his father gave
him sixpence a week pocket-money. All this he had achieved by
Benjy's advice and assistance. But now he had conquered another
step in life&mdash;the step which all real boys so long to make: he
had got amongst his equals in age and strength, and could measure
himself with other boys; he lived with those whose pursuits and
wishes and ways were the same in kind as his own.</p>

<p>The little governess who had lately been installed in the house
found her work grow wondrously easy, for Tom slaved at his lessons,
in order to make sure of his note to the schoolmaster. So there
were very few days in the week in which Tom and the village boys
were not playing in their close by three o'clock. Prisoner's base,
rounders, high-cock-a-lorum, cricket, football&mdash;he was soon initiated
into the delights of them all; and though most of the boys were
older than himself, he managed to hold his own very well. He was
naturally active and strong, and quick of eye and hand, and had
the advantage of light shoes and well-fitting dress, so that in
a short time he could run and jump and climb with any of them.</p>

<p>They generally finished their regular games half an hour or so
before tea-time, and then began trials of skill and strength in
many ways. Some of them would catch the Shetland pony who was
turned out in the field, and get two or three together on his
back, and the little rogue, enjoying the fun, would gallop off
for fifty yards, and then turn round, or stop short and shoot
them on to the turf, and then graze quietly on till he felt another
load; others played at peg-top or marbles, while a few of the
bigger ones stood up for a bout at wrestling. Tom at first only
looked on at this pastime, but it had peculiar attractions for
him, and he could not long keep out of it. Elbow and collar wrestling,
as practised in the western counties, was, next to back-swording,
the way to fame for the youth of the Vale; and all the boys knew
the rules of it, and were more or less expert. But Job Rudkin
and Harry Winburn were the stars&mdash;the former stiff and sturdy,
with legs like small towers; the latter pliant as indiarubber
and quick as lightning. Day after day they stood foot to foot,
and offered first one hand and then the other, and grappled and
closed, and swayed and strained, till a well-aimed crook of the
heel or thrust of the loin took effect, and a fair back-fall ended
the matter. And Tom watched with all his eyes, and first challenged
one of the less scientific, and threw him; and so one by one wrestled
his way up to the leaders.</p>

<p>Then indeed for months he had a poor time of it; it was not long
indeed before he could manage to keep his legs against Job, for
that hero was slow of offence, and gained his victories chiefly
by allowing others to throw themselves against his immovable legs
and loins. But Harry Winburn was undeniably his master; from the
first clutch of hands when they stood up, down to the last trip
which sent him on to his back on the turf, he felt that Harry
knew more and could do more than he. Luckily Harry's bright unconsciousness
and Tom's natural good temper kept them from quarrelling; and
so Tom worked on and on, and trod more and more nearly on Harry's
heels, and at last mastered all the dodges and falls except one.
This one was Harry's own particular invention and pet; he scarcely
ever used it except when hard pressed, but then out it came, and
as sure as it did, over went poor Tom. He thought about that fall
at his meals, in his walks, when he lay awake in bed, in his dreams,
but all to no purpose, until Harry one day in his open way suggested
to him how he thought it should be met; and in a week from that
time the boys were equal, save only the slight difference of strength
in Harry's favour, which some extra ten months of age gave. Tom
had often afterwards reason to be thankful for that early drilling,
and above all, for having mastered Harry Winburn's fall.</p>

<p>Besides their home games, on Saturdays the boys would wander
all over the neighbourhood; sometimes to the downs, or up to the
camp, where they cut their initials out in the springy turf, and
watched the hawks soaring, and the "peert" bird, as Harry Winburn
called the gray plover, gorgeous in his wedding feathers; and
so home, racing down the Manger with many a roll among the thistles,
or through Uffington Wood to watch the fox cubs playing in the
green rides; sometimes to Rosy Brook, to cut long whispering reeds
which grew there, to make pan-pipes of; sometimes to Moor Mills,
where was a piece of old forest land, with short browsed turf
and tufted brambly thickets stretching under the oaks, amongst
which rumour declared that a raven, last of his race, still lingered;
or to the sand-hills, in vain quest of rabbits; and bird-nesting
in the season, anywhere and everywhere.</p>

<p>The few neighbours of the Squire's own rank every now and then
would shrug their shoulders as they drove or rode by a party of
boys with Tom in the middle, carrying along bulrushes or whispering
reeds, or great bundles of cowslip and meadow-sweet, or young
starlings or magpies, or other spoil of wood, brook, or meadow;
and Lawyer Red-tape might mutter to Squire Straight-back at the
Board that no good would come of the young Browns, if they were
let run wild with all the dirty village boys, whom the best farmers'
sons even would not play with. And the squire might reply with
a shake of his head that his sons only mixed with their equals,
and never went into the village without the governess or a footman.
But, luckily, Squire Brown was full as stiffbacked as his neighbours,
and so went on his own way; and Tom and his younger brothers,
as they grew up, went on playing with the village boys, without
the idea of equality or inequality (except in wrestling, running,
and climbing) ever entering their heads; as it doesn't till it's
put there by Jack Nastys or fine ladies' maids.</p>

<p>I don't mean to say it would be the case in all villages, but
it certainly was so in this one: the village boys were full as
manly and honest, and certainly purer, than those in a higher
rank; and Tom got more harm from his equals in his first fortnight
at a private school, where he went when he was nine years old,
than he had from his village friends from the day he left Charity's
apron-strings.</p>

<p>Great was the grief amongst the village school-boys when Tom
drove off with the Squire, one August morning, to meet the coach
on his way to school. Each of them had given him some little present
of the best that he had, and his small private box was full of
peg-taps, white marbles (called "alley-taws" in the Vale), screws,
birds' eggs, whip-cord, jews-harps, and other miscellaneous boys'
wealth. Poor Jacob Doodle-calf, in floods of tears, had pressed
upon him with spluttering earnestness his lame pet hedgehog (he
had always some poor broken-down beast or bird by him); but this
Tom had been obliged to refuse, by the Squire's order. He had
given them all a great tea under the big elm in their playground,
for which Madam Brown had supplied the biggest cake ever seen
in our village; and Tom was really as sorry to leave them as they
to lose him, but his sorrow was not unmixed with the pride and
excitement of making a new step in life.</p>

<p>And this feeling carried him through his first parting with his
mother better than could have been expected. Their love was as
fair and whole as human love can be&mdash;perfect self-sacrifice on
the one side meeting a young and true heart on the other. It is
not within the scope of my book, however, to speak of family relations,
or I should have much to say on the subject of English mothers&mdash;ay,
and of English fathers, and sisters, and brothers too. Neither
have I room to speak of our private schools. What I have to say
is about public schools&mdash;those much-abused and much-belauded institutions
peculiar to England. So we must hurry through Master Tom's year
at a private school as fast as we can.</p>

<p>It was a fair average specimen, kept by a gentleman, with another
gentleman as second master; but it was little enough of the real
work they did&mdash;merely coming into school when lessons were prepared
and all ready to be heard. The whole discipline of the school
out of lesson hours was in the hands of the two ushers, one of
whom was always with the boys in their playground, in the school,
at meals&mdash;in fact, at all times and every where, till they were
fairly in bed at night.</p>

<p>Now the theory of private schools is (or was) constant supervision
out of school&mdash;therein differing fundamentally from that of public
schools.</p>

<p>It may be right or wrong; but if right, this supervision surely
ought to be the especial work of the head-master, the responsible
person. The object of all schools is not to ram Latin and Greek
into boys, but to make them good English boys, good future citizens;
and by far the most important part of that work must be done,
or not done, out of school hours. To leave it, therefore, in the
hands of inferior men, is just giving up the highest and hardest
part of the work of education. Were I a private school-master,
I should say, Let who will hear the boys their lessons, but let
me live with them when they are at play and rest.</p>

<p>The two ushers at Tom's first school were not gentlemen, and
very poorly educated, and were only driving their poor trade of
usher to get such living as they could out of it. They were not
bad men, but had little heart for their work, and of course were
bent on making it as easy as possible. One of the methods by which
they endeavoured to accomplish this was by encouraging tale-bearing,
which had become a frightfully common vice in the school in consequence,
and had sapped all the foundations of school morality. Another
was, by favouring grossly the biggest boys, who alone could have
given them much trouble; whereby those young gentlemen became
most abominable tyrants, oppressing the little boys in all the
small mean ways which prevail in private schools.</p>

<p>Poor little Tom was made dreadfully unhappy in his first week
by a catastrophe which happened to his first letter home. With
huge labour he had, on the very evening of his arrival, managed
to fill two sides of a sheet of letter-paper with assurances of
his love for dear mamma, his happiness at school, and his resolves
to do all she would wish. This missive, with the help of the boy
who sat at the desk next him, also a new arrival, he managed to
fold successfully; but this done, they were sadly put to it for
means of sealing. Envelopes were then unknown; they had no wax,
and dared not disturb the stillness of the evening school-room
by getting up and going to ask the usher for some. At length Tom's
friend, being of an ingenious turn of mind, suggested sealing
with ink; and the letter was accordingly stuck down with a blob
of ink, and duly handed by Tom, on his way to bed, to the housekeeper
to be posted. It was not till four days afterwards that the good
dame sent for him, and produced the precious letter and some wax,
saying, "O Master Brown, I forgot to tell you before, but your
letter isn't sealed." Poor Tom took the wax in silence and sealed
his letter, with a huge lump rising in his throat during the process,
and then ran away to a quiet corner of the playground, and burst
into an agony of tears. The idea of his mother waiting day after
day for the letter he had promised her at once, and perhaps thinking
him forgetful of her, when he had done all in his power to make
good his promise, was as bitter a grief as any which he had to
undergo for many a long year. His wrath, then, was proportionately
violent when he was aware of two boys, who stopped close by him,
and one of whom, a fat gaby of a fellow, pointed at him and called
him "Young mammy-sick!" Whereupon Tom arose, and giving vent thus
to his grief and shame and rage, smote his derider on the nose;
and made it bleed; which sent that young worthy howling to the
usher, who reported Tom for violent and unprovoked assault and
battery. Hitting in the face was a felony punishable with flogging,
other hitting only a misdemeanour&mdash;a distinction not altogether
clear in principle. Tom, however, escaped the penalty by pleading
primum tempus; and having written a second letter to his mother,
inclosing some forget-me-nots, which he picked on their first
half-holiday walk, felt quite happy again, and began to enjoy
vastly a good deal of his new life.</p>

<p>These half-holiday walks were the great events of the week. The
whole fifty boys started after dinner with one of the ushers for
Hazeldown, which was distant some mile or so from the school.
Hazeldown measured some three miles round, and in the neighbourhood
were several woods full of all manner of birds and butterflies.
The usher walked slowly round the down with such boys as liked
to accompany him; the rest scattered in all directions, being
only bound to appear again when the usher had completed his round,
and accompany him home. They were forbidden, however, to go anywhere
except on the down and into the woods; the village had been especially
prohibited, where huge bull's-eyes and unctuous toffy might be
procured in exchange for coin of the realm.</p>

<p>Various were the amusements to which the boys then betook themselves.
At the entrance of the down there was a steep hillock, like the
barrows of Tom's own downs. This mound was the weekly scene of
terrific combats, at a game called by the queer name of "mud-patties."
The boys who played divided into sides under different leaders,
and one side occupied the mound. Then, all parties having provided
themselves with many sods of turf, cut with their bread-and-cheese
knives, the side which remained at the bottom proceeded to assault
the mound, advancing up on all sides under cover of a heavy fire
of turfs, and then struggling for victory with the occupants,
which was theirs as soon as they could, even for a moment, clear
the summit, when they in turn became the besieged. It was a good,
rough, dirty game, and of great use in counteracting the sneaking
tendencies of the school. Then others of the boys spread over
the downs, looking for the holes of humble-bees and mice, which
they dug up without mercy, often (I regret to say) killing and
skinning the unlucky mice, and (I do not regret to say) getting
well stung by the bumble-bees. Others went after butterflies and
birds' eggs in their seasons; and Tom found on Hazeldown, for
the first time, the beautiful little blue butterfly with golden
spots on his wings, which he had never seen on his own downs,
and dug out his first sand-martin's nest. This latter achievement
resulted in a flogging, for the sand-martins built in a high bank
close to the village, consequently out of bounds; but one of the
bolder spirits of the school, who never could be happy unless
he was doing something to which risk was attached, easily persuaded
Tom to break bounds and visit the martins' bank. From whence it
being only a step to the toffy shop, what could be more simple
than to go on there and fill their pockets; or what more certain
than that on their return, a distribution of treasure having been
made, the usher should shortly detect the forbidden smell of bull's-eyes,
and, a search ensuing, discover the state of the breeches-pockets
of Tom and his ally?</p>

<p>This ally of Tom's was indeed a desperate hero in the sight of
the boys, and feared as one who dealt in magic, or something approaching
thereto. Which reputation came to him in this wise. The boys went
to bed at eight, and, of course, consequently lay awake in the
dark for an hour or two, telling ghost-stories by turns. One night
when it came to his turn, and he had dried up their souls by his
story, he suddenly declared that he would make a fiery hand appear
on the door; and to the astonishment and terror of the boys in
his room, a hand, or something like it, in pale light, did then
and there appear. The fame of this exploit having spread to the
other rooms, and being discredited there, the young necromancer
declared that the same wonder would appear in all the rooms in
turn, which it accordingly did; and the whole circumstances having
been privately reported to one of the ushers as usual, that functionary,
after listening about at the doors of the rooms, by a sudden descent
caught the performer in his night-shirt, with a box of phosphorus
in his guilty hand. Lucifer-matches and all the present facilities
for getting acquainted with fire were then unknown&mdash;the very name
of phosphorus had something diabolic in it to the boy-mind; so
Tom's ally, at the cost of a sound flogging, earned what many
older folk covet much&mdash;the very decided fear of most of his companions.</p>

<p>He was a remarkable boy, and by no means a bad one. Tom stuck
to him till he left, and got into many scrapes by so doing. But
he was the great opponent of the tale-bearing habits of the school,
and the open enemy of the ushers; and so worthy of all support.</p>

<p>Tom imbibed a fair amount of Latin and Greek at the school, but
somehow, on the whole, it didn't suit him, or he it, and in the
holidays he was constantly working the Squire to send him at once
to a public school. Great was his joy then, when in the middle
of his third half-year, in October 183-, a fever broke out in
the village, and the master having himself slightly sickened of
it, the whole of the boys were sent off at a day's notice to their
respective homes.</p>

<p>The Squire was not quite so pleased as Master Tom to see that
young gentleman's brown, merry face appear at home, some two months
before the proper time, for the Christmas holidays; and so, after
putting on his thinking cap, he retired to his study and wrote
several letters, the result of which was that, one morning at
the breakfast-table, about a fortnight after Tom's return, he
addressed his wife with&mdash;"My dear, I have arranged that Tom shall
go to Rugby at once, for the last six weeks of this half-year,
instead of wasting them in riding and loitering about home. It
is very kind of the doctor to allow it. Will you see that his
things are all ready by Friday, when I shall take him up to town,
and send him down the next day by himself."</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown was prepared for the announcement, and merely suggested
a doubt whether Tom were yet old enough to travel by himself.
However, finding both father and son against her on this point,
she gave in, like a wise woman, and proceeded to prepare Tom's
kit for his launch into a public school.</p>
