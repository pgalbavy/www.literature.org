<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>By January the complex social mechanism of the metropolis was
whirling smoothly again; the last ultra-fashionable December lingerer
had returned from the country; those of the same caste outward
bound for a Southern or exotic winter had departed; and the glittering
machine, every part assembled, refurbished, repolished, and connected,
having been given preliminary speed-tests at the horse show, and
a tuning up at the opera, was now running under full velocity;
and its steady, subdued whir quickened the clattering pulse of
the city, keying it to a sublimely syncopated ragtime.</p>

<p>The commercial reaction from the chaos of the holidays had become
a carnival of recovery; shop windows grew brighter and gayer than
ever, bursting into gaudy winter florescence; the main arteries
of the town roared prosperity; cross streets were packed; Fifth
Avenue, almost impassible in the morning, choked up after three
o'clock; and all the afternoon through, and late into the night,
mounted police of the traffic squad, adrift in the tide of carriages,
stemmed the flashing currents pouring north and south from the
white marble arch to the gilded bronze battle-horse and its rider
on guard at the portals of the richest quarter of the wealthiest
city in the world.</p>

<p>So far, that winter, snow had fallen only twice, lasting but
a day or two each time; street and avenue remained bone dry where
the white-uniformed cleaning squads worked amid clouds of dust;
and all day long the flinty asphalt echoed the rattling slap of
horses' feet; all day long the big, shining motor-cars sped up
town and down town, droning their distant warnings. It was an
open winter in New York, and, financially, a prosperous one; and
that meant a brilliant social season. Like a set piece of fireworks,
with its interdependent parts taking fire in turn, function after
function, spectacle after spectacle, glittered, fizzed, and was
extinguished, only to give place to newer and more splendid spectacles;
separate circles, sets, and groups belonging to the social solar
system whizzed, revolved, rotated, with edifying effects on everybody
concerned, unconcerned, and not at all concerned; and at intervals,
when for a moment or two something hung fire, the twinkle of similar
spectacles sputtering away in distant cities beyond the horizon
was faintly reflected in the social sky above the incandescent
metropolis. For the whole nation was footing it, heel and toe,
to the echoes of strains borne on the winds from the social capital
of the republic; and the social arbiter at Bird Centre was more
of a facsimile of his New York confrère than that confrère could
ever dream of even in the most realistic of nightmares.</p>

<p>Three phenomena particularly characterised that metropolitan
winter: the reckless rage for private gambling through the mediums
of bridge and roulette; the incorporation of a company known as
The Inter-County Electric Company, capitalised at a figure calculated
to disturb nobody, and, so far, without any avowed specific policy
other than that which served to decorate a portion of its charter
which otherwise might have remained ornately and comparatively
blank; the third phenomenon was the retirement from active affairs
of Stanley S. Quarrier, the father of Howard Quarrier, and the
election of the son to the presidency of the great Algonquin Loan
and Trust Company, with its network system of dependent, subsidiary,
and allied corporations.</p>

<p>The day that the newspapers gave this interesting information
to the Western world, Leroy Mortimer, on being bluntly notified
that he had overdrawn his account with the Algonquin Loan and
Trust, began telephoning in every direction until he located Beverly
Plank at the Saddle Club&mdash;an organisation of wealthy men, and
sufficiently exclusive not to compromise Plank's possible chances
for something better; in fact, the Saddle Club, into which Leroy
Mortimer had already managed to pilot him, was one riser and tread
upward on the stair he was climbing, though it was more of a lobby
for other clubs than a club in itself. To be seen there was, perhaps,
rather to a man's advantage, if he did not loaf there in the evenings
or use it too frequently. As Plank carefully avoided doing either,
Mortimer was fortunate in finding him there; and he crawled out
of his hansom, saying that the desk clerk would pay, and entered
the reading-room, where Plank sat writing a letter.</p>

<p>Beverly Plank had grown stouter since he had returned to town
from Black Fells; but the increase of weight was evenly distributed
over his six feet odd, which made him only a trifle more ponderous
and not abdominally fat. But Mortimer had become enormous; rolls
of flesh crowded his mottled ear-lobes outward and bulged above
his collar; cushions of it padded the backs of his hands and fingers;
shaving left his heavy, distended face congested and unpleasantly
shiny. But he was as minutely groomed as ever, and he wore that
satiated air of prosperity which had always been one of his most
important assets.</p>

<p>The social campaign inaugurated by Leila Mortimer in behalf of
Beverly Plank had, so far, received no serious reverses. His box
at the horse show, of course, produced merely negative results;
his box at the opera might mean something some day. His name was
up at the Lenox and the Patroons; he had endowed a ward in the
new pavilion of St. Berold's Hospital; he had presented a fine
Gainsborough &mdash;The Countess of Wythe&mdash;to the Metropolitan
Museum; and it was rumoured that he had consulted several bishops
concerning a new chapel for that huge bastion of the citadel of
Faith looming above the metropolitan wilderness in the north.</p>

<p>So far, so good. If, as yet, he had not been permitted to go
where he wanted to go, he at least had been instructed where not
to go and what not to do; and he was as docile as he was dogged,
understanding how much longer it takes to shuffle in by way of
the mews and the back door than to sit on the front steps and
wait politely for somebody to unchain the front door.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he was doggedly docile; his huge house, facing the
wintry park midway between the squat palaces of the wealthy pioneers
and the outer hundreds, remained magnificently empty save for
certain afternoon conferences of very solemn men, fellow directors
and associates in business and financial matters&mdash;save for the
periodical presence of the Mortimers: a mansion immense and shadowy,
haunted by relays of yawning, livened servants, half stupefied
under the vast silence of the twilit splendour. He was patient,
not only because he was told to be, but also because he had nothing
better to do. Society stared at him as blankly as the Mountain
confronted Mahomet. But the stubborn patience of the man was itself
a strain on the Mountain; he was aware of that, and he waited
for it to come to him. As yet, however, he could detect no symptoms
of mobility in the Mountain.</p>

<p>"Things are moving all the same," said Mortimer, as he entered
the reading room of the Saddle Club. "Quarrier and Belwether have
listened a damned sight more respectfully to me since they read
that column about you and the bishops and that chapel business."</p>

<p>Plank turned his heavy head with a disturbed glance around the
room; for he always dreaded Mortimer's indiscretions of speech&mdash;was
afraid of his cynical frankness in the presence of others; even
shrank from the brutal bonhomie of the man when alone with him.</p>

<p>"Can't you be careful?" he said; "there was a man here a moment
ago."  He picked up his unfinished letter, folded and pocketed
it, touched an electric bell, and when a servant came, "Take Mr.
Mortimer's order,"  he said, supporting his massive head on his
huge hands and resting his elbow on the writing-desk.</p>

<p>"I've got to cut out this morning bracer," said Mortimer, eyeing
the servant with indecision; but he gave his order nevertheless,
and later accepted a cigar; and when the servant had returned
and again retired, he half emptied his tall glass, refilled it
with mineral water, and, settling back in the padded arm-chair,
said: "If I manage this thing as it ought to be managed, you'll
go through by April. What do you think of that?"</p>

<p>Plank's phlegmatic features flushed. "I'm more obliged to you
than I can say," he began, but Mortimer silenced him with a gesture:
"Don't interrupt. I'm going to put you through The Patroons Club
by April. That's thirty yards through the centre; d'ye see, you
dunderheaded Dutchman? It's solid gain, and it's our ball. The
Lenox will take longer; they're a 'holier-than-thou' bunch of
nincompoops, and it always horrifies them to have any man elected,
no matter who he is. They'd rather die of dry rot than elect anybody;
it shocks them to think that any man could have the presumption
to be presented. They require the spectacle of fasting and prayer&mdash;a
view of a candidate seated in sackcloth and ashes in outer darkness.
You've got to wait for the Lenox, Plank."</p>

<p>"I am waiting," said Plank, squaring his massive jaws.</p>

<p>"You've got to," growled Mortimer, emptying his glass aggressively.</p>

<p>Plank looked out of the window, his shrewd blue eyes closing
in retrospection.</p>

<p>"Another thing," continued Mortimer thickly; "the Kemp Ferralls
are disposed to be decent. I don't mean in asking you to meet
some intellectual second-raters, but in doing it handsomely. I
don't know whether it's time yet," he added, with a sidelong glance
at Plank's stolid face; "I don't want to push the mourners too
hard … Well, I'll see about it … And if it's the thing to do,
and the time to do it"&mdash;he turned on Plank with his boisterous
and misleading laugh and clapped him on the shoulder&mdash;"it will
be done, as sure as snobs are snobs; and that's the surest thing
you ever bet on. Here's to them!" and he emptied his glass and
fell back into his chair, wheezing and sucking at his unlighted
cigar.</p>

<p>"I want to say," began Plank, speaking the more slowly because
he was deeply in earnest, "that all this you are doing for me
is very handsome of you, Mortimer. I'd like to say&mdash;to convey
to you something of how I feel about the way you and Mrs. Mortimer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Leila has done it all."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mortimer is very kind, and you have been so, too. I &mdash;I
wish there was something&mdash;some way to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To what?" asked Mortimer so bluntly that Plank flushed up and
stammered:</p>

<p>"To be&mdash;to do a&mdash;to show my gratitude."</p>

<p>"How? You're scarcely in a position to do anything for us," said
Mortimer, brutally staring him out of countenance.</p>

<p>"I know it," said Plank, the painful flush deepening.</p>

<p>Mortimer, fussing and growling over his cigar, was nevertheless
stealthily intent on the game which had so long absorbed him.
His wits, clogged, dulled by excesses, were now aroused to a sort
of gross activity through the menace of necessity. At last Plank
had given him an opening. He recognised his chance.</p>

<p>"There's one thing," he said deliberately, "that I won't stand
for, and that's any vulgar misconception on your part of my friendship
for you. Do you follow me?"</p>

<p>"I don't misunderstand it," protested Plank, angry and astonished;
"I don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>" &mdash;As though," continued Mortimer menacingly, "I were one
of those needy social tipsters, one of those shabby, pandering
touts who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, Mortimer, don't talk like that! I had no
intention&mdash;"</p>

<p>" &mdash;One of those contemptible, parasitic leeches," persisted
Mortimer, getting redder and hoarser, "who live on men like you.
Confound you, Plank, what the devil do you mean by it?"</p>

<p>"Mortimer, are you crazy, to talk to me like that?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not, but you must be! I've a mind to drop the whole
cursed business! I've every inclination to drop it! If you haven't
horse-sense enough&mdash;if you haven't innate delicacy sufficient
to keep you from making such a break&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't! It wasn't a break, Mortimer. I wouldn't have hurt
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You did hurt me! How can I feel the same again? I never imagined
you thought I was that sort of a social mercenary. Why, so little
did I dream that you looked on our friendship in that light that
I was&mdash;on my word of honour! &mdash;I was just now on the point
of asking you for three or four thousand, to carry me to the month's
end and square my bridge balance."</p>

<p>"Mortimer, you must take it! You are a fool to think I meant
anything by saying I wanted to show my gratitude. Look here; be
decent and fair with me. I wouldn't offer you an affront&mdash;would
I?&mdash;even if I were a cad. I wouldn't do it now, just when you're
getting things into shape for me. I'm not a fool, anyway. This
is in deadly earnest, I tell you, Mortimer, and I'm getting angry
about it. You've got to show your confidence in me; you've got
to take what you want from me, as you would from any friend. I
resent your failure to do it now, as though you drew a line between
me and your intimates. If you're really my friend, show it!"</p>

<p>There was a pause. A curious and unaccustomed sensation had silenced
Mortimer, something almost akin to shame. It astonished him a
little. He did not quite understand why, in the very moment of
success over this stolid, shrewd young man and his thrifty Dutch
instincts, he should feel uncomfortable. Were not his services
worth something? Had he not earned at least the right to borrow
from this rich man who could afford to pay for what was done for
him? Why should he feel ashamed? He had not been treacherous;
he really liked the fellow. Why shouldn't he take his money?</p>

<p>"See here, old man," said Plank, extending a huge highly coloured
hand, "is all square between us now?"</p>

<p>"I think so," muttered Mortimer.</p>

<p>But Plank would not relinquish his hand.</p>

<p>"Then tell me how to draw that cheque! Great Heaven, Mortimer,
what is friendship, anyhow, if it doesn't include little matters
like this&mdash;little misunderstandings like this? I'm the man to
be sensitive, not you. You have been very good to me, Mortimer.
I could almost wish you in a position where the only thing I possess
might square something of my debt to you."</p>

<p>A few minutes later, while he was filling in the cheque, a dusty
youth in riding clothes and spurs came in and found a seat by
one of the windows, into which he dropped, and then looked about
him for a servant.</p>

<p>"Hello, Fleetwood!" said Mortimer, glancing over his shoulder
to see whose spurs were ringing on the polished floor.</p>

<p>Fleetwood saluted amiably with his riding-crop; including Plank,
whom he did not know, in a more formal salute.</p>

<p>"Will you join us?" asked Mortimer, taking the cheque which Plank
offered and carelessly pocketing it without even a nod of thanks.
"You know Beverly Plank, of course? What! I thought everybody
knew Beverly Plank."</p>

<p>Mr. Fleetwood and Mr. Plank shook hands and resumed their seats.</p>

<p>"Ripping weather!" observed Fleetwood, replacing his hat and
rebuttoning the glove which he had removed to shake hands with
Plank. "Lot of jolly people out this morning. I say, Mortimer,
do you want that roan hunter of mine you looked over? I mean King
Dermid, because Marion Page wants him, if you don't. She was out
this morning, and she spoke of it again."</p>

<p>Mortimer, lifting a replenished glass, shook his head, and drank
thirstily in silence.</p>

<p>"Saw you at Westbury, I think," said Fleetwood politely to Plank,
as the two lifted their glasses to one another.</p>

<p>"I hunted there for a day or two," replied Plank, modestly. "If
it's that big Irish thoroughbred you were riding that you want
to sell I'd like a look in, if Miss Page doesn't fancy him."</p>

<p>Fleetwood laughed, and glanced amusedly at Plank over his glass.
"It isn't that horse, Mr. Plank. That's Drumceit, Stephen Siward's
famous horse." He interrupted himself to exchange greetings with
several men who came into the room rather noisily, their spurs
resounding across the oaken floor. One of them, Tom O'Hara, joined
them, slamming his crop on the desk beside Plank and spreading
himself over an arm-chair, from the seat of which he forcibly
removed Mortimer's feet without excuse.</p>

<p>"Drink? Of course I want a drink!" he replied irritably to Fleetwood&mdash;"one,
three, ten, several! Billy, whose weasel-bellied pinto was that
you were kicking your heels into in the park? Some of the squadron
men asked me&mdash;the major. Oh, beg pardon! Didn't know you were
trying to stick Mortimer with him. He might do for the troop ambulance,
inside! … What? Oh, yes; met Mr. Blank &mdash;I mean Mr. Plank&mdash;at
Shotover, I think. How d'ye do? Had the pleasure of potting your
tame pheasants. Rotten sport, you know. What do you do it for,
Mr. Blank?"</p>

<p>"What did you come for, if it's rotten sport?" asked Plank so
simply that it took O'Hara a moment to realise he had been snubbed.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to be offensive," he drawled.</p>

<p>"I suppose you can't help it," said Plank very gently; "some
people can't, you know." And there was another silence, broken
by Mortimer, whose entire hulk was tingling with a mixture of
surprise and amusement over his protégé's developing ability to
take care of himself. "Did you say that Stephen Siward is in Westbury,
Billy?"</p>

<p>"No; he's in town," replied Fleetwood. "I took his horses up
to hunt with. He isn't hunting, you know."</p>

<p>"I didn't know. Nobody ever sees him anywhere," said Mortimer.
"I guess his mother's death cut him up."</p>

<p>Fleetwood lifted his empty glass and gently shook the ice in
it. "That, and&mdash;the other business&mdash;is enough to cut any man up,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"You mean the action of the Lenox Club?" asked Plank seriously.</p>

<p>"Yes. He's resigned from this club, too, I hear. Somebody told
me that he has made a clean sweep of all his clubs. That's foolish.
A man may be an ass to join too many clubs but he's always a fool
to resign from any of 'em. You ask the weatherwise what resigning
from a club forecasts. It's the first ominous sign in a young
man's career."</p>

<p>"What's the second sign?" asked O'Hara, with a yawn.</p>

<p>"Squadron talk; and you're full of it," retorted Fleetwood&mdash;"'I
said to the major,' and 'The captain told the chief trumpeter'&mdash;all
that sort of thing&mdash;and those Porto Rico spurs of yours, and the
ewe-necked glyptosaurus you block the bridle-path with every morning.
You're an awful nuisance, Tom, if anybody should ask me."</p>

<p>Under cover of a rapid-fire exchange of pleasantries between
Fleetwood and O'Hara, Plank turned to Mortimer, hesitating:</p>

<p>"I rather liked Siward when I met him at Shotover," he ventured.
"I'm very sorry he's down and out."</p>

<p>"He drinks," shrugged Mortimer, diluting his mineral water with
Irish whisky. "He can't let it alone; he's like all the Siwards.
I could have told you that the first time I ever saw him. We all
told him to cut it out, because he was sure to do some damfool
thing if he didn't. He's done it, and his clubs have cut him out.
It's his own funeral. … Well, here's to you!"</p>

<p>"Cut who out?" asked Fleetwood, ignoring O'Hara's parting shot
concerning the decadence of the Fleetwood stables and their owner.</p>

<p>"Stephen Siward. I always said that he was sure, sooner or later,
to land in the family ditch. He has a right to, of course; the
gutter is public property."</p>

<p>"It's a damned sad thing," said Fleetwood slowly.</p>

<p>After a pause Plank said: "I think so, too. … I don't know him
very well."</p>

<p>"You may know him better now," said O'Hara insolently.</p>

<p>Plank reddened, and, after a moment: "I should be glad to, if
he cares to know me."</p>

<p>"Mortimer doesn't care for him, but he's an awfully good fellow,
all the same," said Fleetwood, turning to Plank; "he's been an
ass, but who hasn't? I like him tremendously, and I feel very
bad over the mess he made of it after that crazy dinner I gave
in my rooms. What? You hadn't heard of it? Why man, it's the talk
of the clubs."</p>

<p>"I suppose that is why I haven't heard," said Plank simply; "my
club-life is still in the future."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Fleetwood with an involuntary stare, surprised, a
trifle uncomfortable, yet somehow liking Plank, and not understanding
why.</p>

<p>"I'm not in anything, you see; I'm only up for the Patroons and
the Lenox," added Plank gravely.</p>

<p>"I see. Certainly. Er&mdash;hope you'll make 'em; hope to see you
there soon. Er &mdash;I see by the papers you've been jollying
the clergy, Mr. Plank. Awfully handsome of you, all that chapel
business. I say: I've a cousin&mdash;er&mdash;young architect; Beaux Arts,
and all that&mdash;just over. I'd awfully like to have him given a
chance at that competition; invited to try, you see. I don't suppose
it could be managed, now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Would you like to have me ask the bishops?" inquired Plank,
naively shrewd. And the conversation became very cordial between
the two, which Mortimer observed, keeping one ironical eye on
Plank, while he continued a desultory discussion with O'Hara concerning
a very private dinner which somebody told somebody that somebody
had given to Quarrier and the Inter-County Electric people; which,
if true, plainly indicated who was financing the Inter-County
scheme, and why Amalgamated stock had tumbled again yesterday,
and what might be looked for from the Algonquin Trust Company's
president.</p>

<p>"Amalgamated Electric doesn't seem to like it a little bit,"
said O'Hara. "Ferrall, Belwether, and Siward are in it up to their
necks; and if Quarrier is really the god in the machine, and if
he really is doing stunts with Amalgamated Electric, and is also
mixing feet with the Inter-County crowd, why, he is virtually
paralleling his own road; and why, in the name of common sense,
is he doing that? He'll kill it; that's what he'll do."</p>

<p>"He can afford to kill it," observed Mortimer, punching the electric
button and making a significant gesture toward his empty glass
as the servant entered; "a man like Quarrier can afford to kill
anything."</p>

<p>"Yes; but why kill Amalgamated Electric? Why not merge? Why,
it's a crazy thing to do, it's a devil of a thing to do, to parallel
your own line!" insisted O'Hara. "That is dirty work. People don't
do such things these days. Nobody tears up dollar bills for the
pleasure of tearing."</p>

<p>"Nobody knows what Quarrier will do," muttered Mortimer, who
had tried hard enough to find out when the first ominous rumours
arose concerning Amalgamated, and the first fractional declines
left the street speechless and stupefied.</p>

<p>O'Hara sat frowning, and fingering his glass. "As a matter of
fact," he said, "a little cold logic shows us that Quarrier isn't
in it at all. No sane man would ruin his own enterprise, when
there is no need to. His people are openly supporting Amalgamated
and hammering Inter-County; and, besides, there's Ferrall in it,
and Mrs. Ferrall is Quarrier's cousin; and there's Belwether in
it, and Quarrier is engaged to marry Sylvia Landis, who is Belwether's
niece. It's a scrap with Harrington's crowd, and the wheels inside
of wheels are like Chinese boxes. Who knows what it means? Only
it's plain that Amalgamated is safe, if Quarrier wants it to be.
And unless he does he's crazy."</p>

<p>Mortimer puffed stolidly at his cigar until the smoke got into
his eyes and inflamed them. He sat for a while, wiping his puffy
eyelids with his handkerchief; then, squinting sideways at Plank,
and seeing him still occupied with Fleetwood, turned bluntly on
O'Hara:</p>

<p>"See here: what do you mean by being nasty to Plank?" he growled.
"I'm backing him. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"It is curious," mused O'Hara coolly, "how much of a cad a fairly
decent man can be when he's out of temper!"</p>

<p>"You mean Plank, or me?" demanded Mortimer, darkening angrily.</p>

<p>"No; I mean myself. I'm not that way usually. I took him for
a bounder, and he's caught me with the goods on. I've been thinking
that the men who bother with such questions are usually open to
suspicion themselves. Watch me do the civil, now. I'm ashamed
of myself."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment. Will you be civil enough to do something for
him at the Patroons? That will mean something."</p>

<p>"Is he up? Yes, I will;" and, turning in his chair, he said to
Plank: "Awfully sorry I acted like a bounder just now, after having
accepted your hospitality at the Fells. I did mean to be offensive,
and I'm sorry for that, too. Hope you'll overlook it, and be friendly."</p>

<p>Plank's face took on the dark-red hue of embarrassment; he looked
questioningly at Mortimer, whose visage remained non-committal,
then directly at O'Hara.</p>

<p>"I should be very glad to be friends with you," he said with
an ingenuous dignity that surprised Mortimer. It was only the
native simplicity of the man, veneered and polished by constant
contact with Mrs. Mortimer, and now showing to advantage in the
grain. And it gratified Mortimer, because he saw that it was going
to make many matters much easier for himself and his protégé.</p>

<p>The tall glasses were filled and drained again before they departed
to the cold plunge and dressing-rooms above, whence presently
they emerged in street garb to drive down town and lunch together
at the Lenox Club, Plank as Fleetwood's guest.</p>

<p>Mortimer, very heavy and inert after luncheon, wedged himself
into a great stuffed arm-chair by the window, where he alternately
nodded over his coffee and wheezed in his breathing, and leered
out at Fifth Avenue from half-closed, puffy eyes. And there he
was due to sit, sodden and replete, until the fashionable equipages
began to flash past. He'd probably see his wife driving with Mrs.
Ferrall or with Miss Caithness, or perhaps with some doddering
caryatid of the social structure; and he'd sit there, leering
with gummy eyes out of the club windows, while servants in silent
processional replenished his glass from time to time, until in
the early night the trim little shopgirls flocked out into the
highways in gossiping, fluttering coveys, trotting away across
the illuminated asphalt, north and south to their thousand dingy
destinations. And after they had gone he would probably arouse
himself to read the evening paper, or perhaps gossip with Major
Belwether and other white-haired familiars, or perhaps doze until
it was time to summon a cab and go home to dress.</p>

<p>That afternoon, however, having O'Hara and Fleetwood to give
him countenance, he managed to arouse himself long enough to make
Plank known personally to several of the governors of the club
and to a dozen members, then left him to his fate. Whence, presently,
Fleetwood and O'Hara extracted him&mdash;fate at that moment being
personified by a garrulous old gentleman, one Peter Caithness,
who divided with Major Belwether the distinction of being the
club bore&mdash;and together they piloted him to the billiard room,
where he beat them handily for a dollar a point at everything
they suggested.</p>

<p>"You play almost as pretty a game as Stephen Siward used to play,"
said O'Hara cordially. "You've something of his cue movement&mdash;something
of his infernal facility and touch. Hasn't he, Fleetwood?"</p>

<p>"I wish Siward were back here," said Fleetwood thoughtfully,
returning his cue to his own rack. "I wonder what he does with
himself&mdash;where he keeps himself all the while? What the devil
is there for a man to do, if he doesn't do anything? He's not
going out anywhere since his mother's death; he has no clubs to
go to, I understand. What does he do&mdash;go to his office and come
back, and sit in that shabby old brick house all day and blink
at the bum portraits of his bum and distinguished ancestors? Do
you know what he does with himself?" to O'Hara.</p>

<p>"I don't even know where he lives," observed O'Hara, resuming
his coat. "He's given up his rooms, I understand."</p>

<p>"What? Don't know the old Siward house?"</p>

<p>"Oh! does he live there now? Of course; I forgot about his mother.
He had apartments last year, you remember. He gave dinners&mdash;corkers
they were. I went to one&mdash;like that last one you gave."</p>

<p>"I wish I'd never given it," said Fleetwood gloomily. "If I hadn't,
he'd be a member here still. … What do you suppose induced him
to take that little gin-drinking cat to the Patroons? Why, man,
it wasn't even an undergraduate's trick! it was the act of a lunatic."</p>

<p>For a while they talked of Siward, and of his unfortunate story
and the pity of it; and when the two men ceased,</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Plank mildly, "I don't believe he ever did
it."</p>

<p>O'Hara looked up surprised, then shrugged. "Unfortunately he
doesn't deny it, you see."</p>

<p>"I heard," said Fleetwood, lighting a cigarette, "that he did
deny it; that he said, no matter what his condition was, he couldn't
have done it. If he had been sober, the governors would have been
bound to take his word of honour. But he couldn't give that, you
see. And after they pointed out to him that he had been in no
condition to know exactly what he did do, he shut up. … And they
dropped him; and he's falling yet."</p>

<p>"I don't believe that sort of a man ever would do that sort of
thing,"  repeated Plank obstinately, his Delft-blue eyes partly
closing, so that all the Dutch shrewdness and stubbornness in
his face disturbed its highly coloured placidity. And he walked
away toward the wash-room to cleanse his ponderous pink hands
of chalk-dust.</p>

<p>"That's what's the matter with Plank," observed O'Hara to Fleetwood
as Plank disappeared. "It isn't that he's a bounder; but he doesn't
know things; he doesn't know enough, for instance, to wait until
he's a member of a club before he criticises the judgment of its
governors. Yet you can't help tolerating the fellow. I think I'll
write a letter for him, or put down my name. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"It would be all right," said Fleetwood. "He'll need all the
support he can get, with Leroy Mortimer as his sponsor. … Wasn't
Mortimer rather nasty about Siward though, in his rôle of the
alcoholic prophet? Whew!"</p>

<p>"Siward never had any use for Mortimer," observed O'Hara.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you never heard him say so," returned Fleetwood. "You
know Stephen Siward's way; he never said anything unpleasant about
any man. I wish I didn't either, but I do. So do you. So do most
men. … Lord! I wish Siward were back here. He was a good deal
of a man, after all, Tom."</p>

<p>They were unconsciously using the past tense in discussing Siward,
as though he were dead, either physically or socially.</p>

<p>"In one way he was always a singularly decent man," mused O'Hara,
walking toward the great marble vestibule and buttoning his overcoat.</p>

<p>"How exactly do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, about women."</p>

<p>"I believe it, too. If he did take that Vyse girl into the Patroons,
it was his limit with her&mdash;and, I believe his limit with any woman.
He was absurdly decent that way; he was indeed. And now look at
the reputation he has! Isn't it funny? isn't it, now?"</p>

<p>"What sort of an effect do you suppose all this business is going
to have on Siward?"</p>

<p>"It's had one effect already," replied Fleetwood, as Plank came
up, ready for the street. "Ferrall says he looks sick, and Belwether
says he's going to the devil; but that's the sort of thing the
major is likely to say. By the way, wasn't there something between
that pretty Landis girl and Siward? Somebody&mdash;some damned gossiping
somebody&mdash;talked about it somewhere, recently."</p>

<p>"I don't believe that, either," said Plank, in his heavy, measured,
passionless voice, as they descended the steps of the white portico
and looked around for a cab.</p>

<p>"As for me, I've got to hustle," observed O'Hara, glancing at
his watch. "I'm due to shine at a function about five. Are you
coming up-town either of you fellows? I'll give you a lift as
far as Seventy-second Street, Plank."</p>

<p>"Tell you what we'll do," said Fleetwood, impulsively, turning
to Plank: "We'll drive down town, you and I, and we'll look up
poor old Siward! Shall we? He's probably all alone in that God-forsaken
red brick family tomb! Shall we? How about it, Plank?"</p>

<p>O'Hara turned impatiently on his heel with a gesture of adieu,
climbed into his electric hansom, and went buzzing away up the
avenue.</p>

<p>"I'd like to, but I don't think I know Mr. Siward well enough
to do that," said Plank diffidently. He hesitated, colouring up.
"He might misunderstand my going with you&mdash;as a liberty&mdash;which
perhaps I might not have ventured on had he been less&mdash;less unfortunate."</p>

<p>Again Fleetwood warmed toward the ruddy, ponderous young man
beside him. "See here," he said, "you are going as a friend of
mine&mdash;if you care to look at it that way."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Plank; "I should be very glad to go in that
way."</p>

<p>The Siward house was old only in the comparative Manhattan meaning
of the word; for in New York nothing is really very old, except
the faces of the young men.</p>

<p>Decades ago it had been considered a big house, and it was still
so spoken of&mdash;a solid, dingy, red brick structure, cubical in
proportions, surmounted by heavy chimneys, the depth of its sunken
windows hinting of the thickness of wall and foundation. Window-curtains
of obsolete pattern, all alike, and all drawn, masked the blank
panes. Three massive wistaria-vines, the gnarled stems as thick
as tree-trunks, crawled upward to the roof, dividing the façade
equally, and furnishing some relief to its flatness, otherwise
unbroken except by the deep reveals of window and door. Two huge
and unsymmetrical catalpa trees stood sentinels before it, dividing
curb from asphalt; and from the centres of the shrivelled, brown
grass-plots flanking the stoop under the basement windows two
aged Rose-of-Sharon trees bristled naked to the height of the
white marble capitals of the flaking pillars supporting the stained
portico.</p>

<p>An old New York house, in the New York sense. Old in another
sense, too, where in a rapid land Time outstrips itself, painting,
with the antiquity of centuries, the stone and mortar which were
new scarce ten years since.</p>

<p>"Nice old family mausoleum," commented Fleetwood, descending
from the hansom, followed by Plank. The latter instinctively mounted
the stoop on tiptoe, treading gingerly as one who ventures into
precincts unknown but long respected; and as Fleetwood pulled
the old-fashioned bell, Plank stole a glance over the façade,
where wisps of straw trailed from sparrows' nests, undisturbed,
wedged between plinth and pillar; where, behind the lace pane-screens,
shadowy edges of heavy curtains framed the obscurity; where the
paint had blistered and peeled from the iron railings, and the
marble pillars of the portico glimmered, scarred by frosts of
winters long forgotten.</p>

<p>"Cheerful monument," repeated Fleetwood with a sarcastic nod.
Then the door was opened by a very old man wearing the black "swallow-tail" 
clothes and choker of an old-time butler, spotless, quite immaculate,
but cut after a fashion no young man remembers.</p>

<p>"Good evening," said Fleetwood, entering, followed on tiptoe
by Plank.</p>

<p>"Good evening, sir." … A pause; and in the unsteady voice of
age: "Mr. Fleetwood, sir. … Mr.&mdash;." A bow, and the dim eyes peering
up at Plank, who stood fumbling for his card-case.</p>

<p>Fleetwood dropped both cards on the salver unsteadily extended.
The butler ushered them into a dim room on the right.</p>

<p>"How is Mr. Siward?" asked Fleetwood, pausing on the threshold
and dropping his voice.</p>

<p>The old man hesitated, looking down, then still looking away
from Fleetwood: "Bravely, sir, bravely, Mr. Fleetwood."</p>

<p>"The Siwards were always that," said the young man gently.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. … Thank you. Mr. Stephen &mdash;Mr. Siward," he corrected,
quaintly, "is indisposed, sir. It was a&mdash;a great shock to us all,
sir!"  He bowed and turned away, holding his salver stiffly; and
they heard him muttering under his breath, "Bravely, sir, bravely.
<em>A&mdash;</em>a great shock, sir! … Thank you."</p>

<p>Fleetwood turned to Plank, who stood silent, staring through
the fading light at the faded household gods of the house of Siward.
The dim light touched the prisms of a crystal chandelier dulled
by age, and edged the carved foliations of the marble mantel,
above which loomed a tarnished mirror reflecting darkness. Fleetwood
rose, drew a window-shade higher, and nodded toward several pictures;
and Plank moved slowly from one to another, peering up at the
dead Siwards in their crackled varnish.</p>

<p>"This is the real thing," observed Fleetwood cynically, "all
this Fourth Avenue antique business; dingy, cumbersome, depressing.
Good God! I see myself standing it. … Look at that old grinny-bags
in a pig-tail over there! To the cellar for his, if this were
my house. … We've got some, too, in several rooms, and I never
go into 'em. They're like a scene in a bum play, or like one of
those Washington Square rat-holes, where artists eat Welsh-rabbits
with dirty fingers. Ugh!"</p>

<p>"I like it," said Plank, under his breath.</p>

<p>Fleetwood stared, then shrugged, and returned to the window to
watch a brand-new French motor-car drawn up before a modern mansion
across the avenue.</p>

<p>The butler returned presently, saying that Mr. Siward was at
home and would receive them in the library above, as he was not
yet able to pass up and down stairs.</p>

<p>"I didn't know he was as ill as that," muttered Fleetwood, as
he and Plank followed the old man up the creaking stairway. But
Gumble, the butler, said nothing in reply.</p>

<p>Siward was sitting in an arm-chair by the window, one leg extended,
his left foot, stiffly cased in bandages, resting on a footstool.</p>

<p>"Why, Stephen!" exclaimed Fleetwood, hastening forward, "I didn't
know you were laid up like this!"</p>

<p>Siward offered his hand inquiringly; then his eyes turned toward
Plank, who stood behind Fleetwood; and, slowly disengaging his
hand from Fleetwood's sympathetic grip, he offered it to Plank.</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you," he said. "Gumble, Mr. Fleetwood prefers
rye, for some inscrutable reason. Mr. Plank?" His smile was a
question.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind," said Plank, "I should like to have some
tea&mdash;that is, if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tea, Gumble, for two. We'll tipple in company, Mr. Plank," he
added. "And the cigars are at your elbow, Billy," with another
smile at Fleetwood.</p>

<p>"Now," said the latter, after he had lighted his cigar, "what
is the matter, Stephen?"</p>

<p>Siward glanced at his stiffly extended foot. "Nothing much."
He reddened faintly, "I slipped. It's only a twisted ankle."</p>

<p>For a moment or two the answer satisfied Fleetwood, then a sudden,
curious flash of suspicion came into his eyes; he glanced sharply
at Siward, who lowered his eyes, while the red tint in his hollow
cheeks deepened.</p>

<p>Neither spoke for a while. Plank sipped the tea which Wands,
the second man, brought. Siward brooded over his cup, head bent.
Fleetwood made more noise than necessary with his ice.</p>

<p>"I miss you like hell!" said Fleetwood musingly, measuring out
the old rye from the quaint decanter. "Why did you drop the Saddle
Club, Stephen?"</p>

<p>"I'm not riding; I have no use for it," replied Siward.</p>

<p>"You've cut out the Proscenium Club, too, and the Owl's Head,
and the Trophy. It's a shame, Stephen."</p>

<p>"I'm tired of clubs."</p>

<p>"Don't talk that way."</p>

<p>"Very well, I won't," said Siward, smiling. "Tell me what is
happening&mdash;out there," he made a gesture toward the window; "all
the gossip the newspapers miss. I've talked Dr. Grisby to death;
I've talked Gumble to death; I've read myself stupid. What's going
on, Billy?"</p>

<p>So Fleetwood sketched for him a gay cartoon of events, caricaturing
various episodes in the social kaleidoscope which might interest
him. He gossiped cynically, but without malice, about people they
both knew, about engagements, marriages, and divorces, plans and
ambitions; about those absent from the metropolis and the newcomers
to be welcomed. He commented briefly on the opera, reviewed the
newer plays at the theatres, touched on the now dormant gaiety
which had made the season at nearby country clubs conspicuous;
then drifted into the hunting field, gossiping pleasantly in the
vernacular about horses and packs and drag-hunts and stables,
and what people thought of the new English hounds of the trial
pack, and how the new M. F. H., Maitland Gray, had managed to
break so many bones at Southbury.</p>

<p>Politics were touched upon, and they spoke of the possibility
of Ferrall going to the Assembly, the sport of boss-baiting having
become fashionable among amateurs, and providing a new amusement
for the idle rich.</p>

<p>So city, State, and national issues were run through lightly,
business conditions noticed, the stock market speculated upon;
and presently conversation died out, with a yawn from Fleetwood
as he looked into his empty glass at the last bit of ice.</p>

<p>"Don't do that, Billy," smiled Siward. "You haven't discoursed
upon art, literature, and science yet, and you can't go until
you've adjusted the affairs of the nation for the next twenty-four
hours."</p>

<p>"Art?" yawned Fleetwood. "Oh, pictures? Don't like 'em. Nobody
ever looks at 'em except débutantes, who do it out of deviltry,
to floor a man at a dinner or a dance."</p>

<p>"How about literature?" inquired Siward gravely. "Anything doing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing in it," replied Fleetwood more gravely still. "It's
another feminine bluff&mdash;like all that music talk they hand you
after the opera."</p>

<p>"I see. And science?"</p>

<p>"Spider Flynn is matched to meet Kid Holloway; is that what you
mean, Stephen? Somebody tumbled out of an air-ship the other day;
is that what you mean? And they're selling scientific jewelry
on Broadway at a dollar a quart; is that what you want to know?"</p>

<p>Siward rested his head on his hand with a smile. "Yes, that's
about what I wanted to know, Billy&mdash;all about the arts and sciences.
… Much obliged. You needn't stay any longer, if you don't want
to."</p>

<p>"How soon will you be out?" inquired Fleetwood.</p>

<p>"Out? I don't know. I shall try to drive to the office to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Why the devil did you resign from all your clubs? How can I
see you if I don't come here?" began Fleetwood impatiently. "I
know, of course, that you're not going anywhere, but a man always
goes to his club. You don't look well, Stephen. You are too much
alone."</p>

<p>Siward did not answer. His face and body had certainly grown
thinner since Fleetwood had last seen him. Plank, too, had been
shocked at the change in him&mdash;the dark, hard lines under the eyes;
the pallor, the curious immobility of the man, save for his fingers,
which were always restless, now moving in search of some small
object to worry and turn over and over, now nervously settling
into a grasp on the arm of his chair.</p>

<p>"How is Amalgamated Electric?" asked Fleetwood, abruptly.</p>

<p>"I think it's all right. Want to buy some?" replied Siward, smiling.</p>

<p>Plank stirred in his chair ponderously. "Somebody is kicking
it to pieces," he said.</p>

<p>"Somebody is trying to," smiled Siward.</p>

<p>"Harrington," nodded Fleetwood. Siward nodded back. Plank was
silent.</p>

<p>"Of course," continued Fleetwood, tentatively, "you people need
not worry, with Howard Quarrier back of you."</p>

<p>Nobody said anything for a while. Presently Siward's restless
hands, moving in search of something, encountered a pencil lying
on the table beside him, and he picked it up and began drawing
initials and scrolls on the margin of a newspaper; and all the
scrolls framed initials, and all the initials were the same, twining
and twisting into endless variations of the letters S. L.</p>

<p>"Yes, I must go to the office to-morrow," he repeated absently.
"I am better&mdash;in fact I am quite well, except for this sprain."
He looked down at his bandaged foot, then his pencil moved listlessly
again, continuing the endless variations on the two letters. It
was plain that he was tired.</p>

<p>Fleetwood rose and made his adieux almost affectionately. Plank
moved forward on tiptoe, bulky and noiseless; and Siward held
out his hand, saying something amiably formal.</p>

<p>"Would you like to have me come again?" asked Plank, red with
embarrassment, yet so naively that at first Siward found no words
to answer him; then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Would you care to come, Mr. Plank?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Siward looked at him curiously, almost cautiously. His first
impressions of the man had been summed up in one contemptuous
word. Besides, barring that, what was there in common between
himself and such a type as Plank? He had not even troubled himself
to avoid him at Shotover; he had merely been aware of him when
Plank spoke to him; never otherwise, except that afternoon beside
the swimming pool, when he had made one of his rare criticisms
on Plank.</p>

<p>Perhaps Plank had changed, perhaps Siward had; for he found nothing
offensive in the bulky young man now&mdash;nothing particularly attractive,
either, except for a certain simplicity, a certain direct candour
in the heavy blue eyes which met his squarely.</p>

<p>"Come in for a cigar when you have a few moments idle," said
Siward slowly.</p>

<p>"It will give me great pleasure," said Plank, bowing.</p>

<p>And that was all. He followed Fleetwood down the stairs; Wands
held their coats, and bowed them out into the falling shadows
of the winter twilight.</p>

<p>Siward, sitting beside his window, watched them enter their hansom
and drive away up the avenue. A dull flush had settled over his
cheeks; the aroma of spirits hung in the air, and he looked across
the room at the decanter. Presently he drank some of his tea,
but it was lukewarm, and he pushed the cup from him.</p>

<p>The clatter of the cup brought the old butler, who toddled hither
and thither, removing trays, pulling chairs into place, fussing
and pattering about, until a maid came in noiselessly, bearing
a lamp. She pulled down the shades, drew the sad-coloured curtains,
went to the mantelpiece and peered at the clock, then brought
a wineglass and a spoon to Siward, and measured the dose in silence.
He swallowed it, shrugged, permitted her to change the position
of his chair and footstool, and nodded thanks and dismissal.</p>

<p>"Gumble, are you there?" he asked carelessly.</p>

<p>The butler entered from the hallway. "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You may leave that decanter."</p>

<p>But the old servant may have misunderstood, for he only bowed
and ambled off downstairs with the decanter, either heedless or
deaf to his master's sharp order to return.</p>

<p>For a while Siward sat there, eyes fixed, scowling into vacancy;
then the old, listless, careworn expression returned; he rested
one elbow on the window-sill, his worn cheek on his hand, and
with the other hand fell to weaving initials with his pencil on
the margin of the newspaper lying on the table beside him.</p>

<p>Lamplight brought out sharply the physical change in him&mdash;the
angular shadows flat under the cheek-bones, the hard, slightly
swollen flesh in the bluish shadows around the eyes. The mark
of the master-vice was there; its stamp in the swollen, worn-out
hollows; its imprint in the fine lines at the corners of his mouth;
its sign manual in the faintest relaxation of the under lip, which
had not yet become a looseness.</p>

<p>For the last of the Siwards had at last stepped into the highway
which his doomed forebears had travelled before him.</p>

<p>"Gumble!" he called irritably.</p>

<p>A quavering voice, an unsteady step, and the old man entered
again. "Mr. Stephen, sir?"</p>

<p>"Bring that decanter back. Didn't you hear me tell you just now?"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Stephen, sir."</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>"Gumble!"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Are you going to bring that decanter?"</p>

<p>The old butler bowed, and ambled from the room, and for a long
while Siward sat sullenly listening and scoring the edges of the
paper with his trembling pencil. Then the lead broke short, and
he flung it from him and pulled the bell. Wands came this time,
a lank, sandy, silent man, grown gray as a rat in the service
of the Siwards. He received his master's orders, and withdrew;
and again Siward waited, biting his under lip and tearing bits
from the edges of the newspaper with fingers never still; but
nobody came with the decanter, and after a while his tense muscles
relaxed; something in his very soul seemed to snap, and he sank
back in his chair, the hot tears blinding him.</p>

<p>He had got as far as that; moments of self-pity were becoming
almost as frequent as scorching intervals of self-contempt.</p>

<p>So they all knew what was the matter with him&mdash;they all knew&mdash;the
doctor, the servants, his friends. Had he not surprised the quick
suspicion in Fleetwood's glance, when he told him he had slipped,
and sprained his ankle? What if he had been drunk when he fell&mdash;fell
on his own doorsteps, carried into the old Siward house by old
Siward servants, drunk as his forefathers? It was none of Fleetwood's
business. It was none of the servants' business. It was nobody's
business except his own. Who the devil were all these people,
to pry into his affairs and doctor him and dose him and form secret
leagues to disobey him, and hide decanters from him? Why should
anybody have the impertinence to meddle with him? Of what concern
to them were his vices or his virtues?</p>

<p>The tears dried in his hot eyes; he jerked the old-fashioned
bell savagely; and after a long while he heard servants whispering
together in the passageway outside his door.</p>

<p>He lay very still in his chair; his hearing had become abnormally
acute, but he could not make out what they were saying; and as
the dull, intestinal aching grew sharper, parching, searing every
strained muscle in throat and chest, he struck the table beside
him, and clenched his teeth in the fierce rush of agony that swept
him from head to foot, crying out an inarticulate menace on his
household. And Dr. Grisby came into the room from the outer shadows
of the hall.</p>

<p>He was very small, very meagre, very bald, and clean-shaven,
with a face like a nut-cracker; and the brown wig he wore was
atrocious, and curled forward over his colourless ears. He wore
steel-rimmed spectacles, each glass divided into two lenses; and
he stood on tiptoe to look out through the upper lenses on the
world, and always bent almost double to use the lower or reading
lenses.</p>

<p>Besides that, he affected frilled shirts, and string ties, which
nobody had ever seen snugly tied. His loose string tie was the
first thing Siward could remember about the doctor; and that the
doctor had permitted him to pull it when he had the measles, at
the age of six.</p>

<p>"What's all this racket?" said the little old doctor harshly.
"Got colic? Got the toothache? I'm ashamed of you, Stephen, cutting
capers and pounding the furniture! Look up! Look at me! Out with
your tongue! Well, now, what the devil's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;know," muttered Siward, abandoning his wrist to the little
man, who seated himself beside him. Dr. Grisby scarcely noted
the pulse; the delicate pressure had become a strong caress.</p>

<p>"Know what?" he grunted. "How do I know what's the matter with
you? Hey? Now, now, don't try to explain, Steve; don't fly off
the handle! All right; grant that I do know what's bothering you;
I want to see that ankle first. Here, somebody! Light that gas.
Why the mischief don't you have the house wired for electricity,
Stephen? It's wholesome. Gas isn't. Lamps are worse, sir. Do as
I tell you!" And he went on loquaciously, grumbling and muttering,
and never ceasing his talk, while Siward, wincing as the dressing
was removed, lay back and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Gumble appeared, to announce dinner.</p>

<p>"I don't want any," said Siward.</p>

<p>"Eat!" said Dr. Grisby harshly.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't care to."</p>

<p>"Eat, I tell you! Do you think I don't mean what I say?"</p>

<p>So he ate his broth and toast, the doctor curtly declining to
join him. He ate hurriedly, closing his eyes in aversion. Even
the iced tea was flat and distasteful to him.</p>

<p>And at last he lay back, white and unstrung, the momentarily
deadened desperation glimmering under his half-closed eyes. And
for a long while Dr. Grisby sat, doubled almost in two, cuddling
his bony little knees and studying the patterns in the faded carpet.</p>

<p>"I guess you'd better go, Stephen," he said at length.</p>

<p>"Up the river&mdash;to Mulqueen's?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Let's try it, Steve. You'll be on your feet in two weeks.
Then you'd better go&mdash;up the river&mdash;to Mulqueen's."</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I'll go, if you say so. But I can't go now."</p>

<p>"I didn't say go now. I said in two weeks."</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"Will you give me your word?" demanded the doctor sharply.</p>

<p>"No, doctor."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I may have to be here on business. There seems to be
some sort of crisis coming which I don't understand."</p>

<p>"There's a crisis right here, Steve, which I understand!" snapped
Dr. Grisby. "Face it like a man! Face it like a man! You're sick&mdash;to
your bones, boy&mdash;sick! sick! Fight the fight, Steve! Fight a good
fight. There's a fighting chance; on my soul of honour, there
is, Steve, a fighting chance for you! Now! now, boy! Buckle up
tight! Tuck up your sword-sleeve! At 'em, Steve! Give 'em hell!
Oh, my boy, my boy, I know; I know!" The little man's voice broke,
but he steadied it instantly with a snap of his nut-cracker jaws,
and scowled on his patient and shook his little withered fist
at him.</p>

<p>His patient lay very still in the shadow.</p>

<p>"I want you to go," said the doctor harshly, "before your self-control
goes. Do you understand? I want you to go before your decision
is undermined; before you begin to do devious things, sly things,
cheating things, slinking things&mdash;anything and everything to get
at the thing you crave. I've given you something to fight with,
and you won't take it faithfully. I've given you free rein in
tobacco and tea and coffee. I've helped you as much as I dare
to weather the nights. Now, you help me&mdash;do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes … I will."</p>

<p>"You say so; now do it. Do something for yourself. Do anything!
If you're sick of reading&mdash;and I don't blame you, considering
the stuff you read&mdash;get people down here to see you; get lots
of people. Telephone 'em; you've a telephone there, haven't you?
There it is, by your elbow. Use it! Call up people. Talk all the
time."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will."</p>

<p>"Good! Now, Steve, we know what's the matter, physically, don't
we? Of course we do! Now, then, what's the matter mentally?"</p>

<p>"Mentally?" repeated Siward under his breath.</p>

<p>"Yes, mentally. What's the trouble? Stocks? Bonds? Lawsuits?
Love?" the slightest pause, and a narrowing of the gimlet eyes
behind the lenses. "Love?" he repeated harshly. "Which is it,
boy? They're all good to let alone."</p>

<p>"Business," said Siward. But, being a Siward, he was obliged
to add "partly."</p>

<p>"Business&mdash;partly," repeated the doctor. "What's the matter with
business&mdash;partly?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. There are rumours. Hetherington is pounding us&mdash;apparently.
That Inter-County crowd is acting ominously, too. There's something
underhand, somewhere." He bent his head and fell to plucking at
the faded brocade on the arm of his chair, muttering to himself,
"somewhere, somehow, something underhand. I don't know what; I
really don't."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;all right," said the doctor testily; "let it go at
that! There's treachery, eh? You suspect it? You're sure of it&mdash;as
reasonably sure as a gentleman can be of something he is not fashioned
to understand? That's it, is it? All right, sir&mdash;all right! Very
well&mdash;ver-y well. Now, sir, look at me! Business symptoms admitted,
what about the 'partly,' Stephen?&mdash;what about it, eh? What about
it?"</p>

<p>But Siward fell silent again.</p>

<p>"Eh? Did you say something? No? Oh, very well, ver-y well, sir.
… Perfectly correct, Stephen. You have not earned the right to
admit further symptoms. No, sir, you have not earned the right
to admit them to anybody, not even to yourself. Nor to&mdash;her!"</p>

<p>"Doctor!"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"I have&mdash;admitted them."</p>

<p>"To yourself, Steve? I'm sorry. You have no right to&mdash;yet. I'm
sorry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have admitted them&mdash;admitted them&mdash;to her."</p>

<p>"That settles it," said the doctor grimly, "that clinches it!
That locks you to the wheel! That pledges you. The squabble is
on, now. It's your honour that's engaged now, not your nerves,
not your intestines. It's a good fight&mdash;a very good fight, with
no chance of losing anything but life. You go up the river to
Mulqueen's. That's the strategy in this campaign; that's excellent
manoeuvring; that's good generalship! Eh? Mask your purpose, Steve;
make a feint of camping out here under my guns; then suddenly
fling your entire force up the Hudson and fortify yourself at
Mulqueen's! Ho, that'll fix 'em! That's going to astonish the
enemy!"</p>

<p>His harsh, dry, crackling laughter broke out like the distant
rattle of musketry.</p>

<p>The ghost of a smile glimmered in Siward's haunted eyes, then
faded as he leaned forward.</p>

<p>"She has refused me," he said simply.</p>

<p>The little doctor, after an incredulous stare, began chattering
with wrath. "Refused you! Pah! Pooh! That's nothing! That signifies
absolutely nothing! It's meaningless! It's a detail. You get well&mdash;do
you hear? You go and get well; then try it again! Then you'll
see! And if she is an idiot&mdash;in the event of her irrational persistence
in an incredible and utterly indefensible attitude"&mdash;he choked
up, then fairly barked at Siward&mdash;"take her anyway, sir! Run off
with her! Dominate circumstances, sir! take charge of events!
… But you can't do it till you've clapped yourself into prison
for life. … And God help you if you let yourself escape!"</p>

<p>And after a long while Siward said: "If I should ever marry&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Had children, eh? Is that it? Oh, it is, eh? Well, I say, marry!
I say, have children! If you're a man, you'll breed men. The chances
are they may not inherit what you have. It skips some generations&mdash;some,
now and then. But if they do, good God! I say it's better to be
born and have a chance to fight than never to come into the arena
at all! By winning out, the world learns; by failure, the world
is no less wise. The important thing is birth. The main point
is to breed&mdash;to produce&mdash;to reproduce! but not until you stand,
sword in hand, and your armed heel on the breast of your prostrate
and subconscious self!"</p>

<p>He jumped up and began running about the room with short little
bantam steps, talking all the while.</p>

<p>"People say, 'Shall criminals be allowed to mate and produce
young? Shall malefactors be allowed to beget? No!' And I say no,
too. Never so long as they remain criminals and malefactors; so
long as the evil in them is in the ascendant. Never, until they
are cured. That's what I say; that's what I maintain. Crime is
a disease; criminals are sick people. No marriage for them until
they're cured; no children for them until they're well. If they
cure themselves, let 'em marry; let 'em breed; for then, if their
children inherit the inclination, they also inherit the grit to
cauterise the malady."</p>

<p>He produced a huge handkerchief from the tails of his coat, and
wiped his damp features and polished his forehead so violently
that his wig took a new and jaunty angle.</p>

<p>"I'm talking too much," he said fretfully; "I'm talking a great
deal&mdash;all the time&mdash;continually. I've other patients&mdash;several&mdash;plenty!
Do you think you're the only man I know who's trying to disfigure
his liver and make spots come out all over inside him? Do you?"</p>

<p>Siward smiled again, a worn, pallid smile.</p>

<p>"I can stand it while you are here, doctor, but when I'm alone
it's&mdash;hard. One of those crises is close now. I've a bad night
ahead&mdash;a bad outlook. Couldn't you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Just enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Stephen."</p>

<p>" &mdash;Enough to dull it&mdash;just a little? I don't ask for enough
to make me sleep&mdash;not even to make me doze. You have your needle;
haven't you, doctor?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then, just this once&mdash;for the last time."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why? Are you afraid? You needn't be, doctor. I don't care for
it except to give me a little respite, a little rest on a night
like this. I'm so tired of this ache. If I could only have some
sleep, and wake up in good shape, I'd stand a better chance of
fighting. … Wait, doctor! Just one moment. I don't mean to be
a coward, but I've had a hard fight, and &mdash;I'm tired. … If
you could see your way to helping me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I dare not help you any more that way."</p>

<p>"Not this once?"</p>

<p>"Not this once."</p>

<p>There was a dead silence, broken at last by the doctor with a
violent gesture toward the telephone. "Talk to the girl! Why don't
you talk to the girl! If she's worth a hill o' beans she'll help
you to hang on. What's she for, if she isn't for such moments?
Tell her you need her voice; tell her you need her faith in you.
Damn central! Talk out in church! Don't make a goddess of a woman.
The men who want to marry her, and can't, will do that! The nincompoop
can always be counted on to deify the commonplace. And she is
commonplace. If she isn't, she's no good! Commend me to sanity
and the commonplace. I take off my hat to it! I honour it. God
bless it! Good-night!"</p>

<p>Siward lay still for a long while after the doctor had gone.
More than an hour had passed before he slowly sat up and groped
for the telephone book, opened it, and searched in a blind, hesitating
way until he found the number he was looking for.</p>

<p>He had never telephoned to her; he had never written her except
once, in reply to her letter in regard to his mother's death&mdash;that
strange, timid, formal letter, in which, grief-stunned as he was,
he saw only the formality, and had answered it more formally still.
And that was all that had come of the days and nights by that
northern sea&mdash;a letter and its answer, and silence.</p>

<p>And, thinking of these things, he shut the book wearily, and
lay back in the shadow of the faded curtain, closing his sunken
eyes.</p>
