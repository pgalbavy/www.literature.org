<p>The expedition on which Jack Carleton entered with his two companions
promised to be similar in many respects to those which have been
already described. It looked indeed as if it would be more dull,
and, for a while, such was the fact, but it was not long before
matters took a turn as extraordinary as unexpected, and which
quickly led the Kentuckian to conclude that it was, after all,
the most eventful enterprise of his life.</p>

<p>For nearly three days the westward journey was without incident
which need be given in detail. They swam several streams of water,
climbed and descended elevations and shot such game as they required.
The weapon of Hay-uta proved to be fully as excellent as it looked.
Though its flintlock and single muzzle-loading barrel would have
made a sorry show in the presence of our improved modern weapons,
yet it was capable of splendid execution. Jack Carleton was a
fine marksman, but in a friendly contest in which the three engaged,
the Sauk beat him almost every time. That this was due to the
superiority of his gun was proven by the fact that when they exchanged
rifles, the young Kentuckian never failed to beat the other, and
the beauty of the whole proceeding was that when Deerfoot took
the handsome weapon, he vanquished both; in fact he did it with
the gun belonging to Jack Carleton.</p>

<p>Though the young Shawanoe clung to his bow, it was clear to his
companions that he admired the new piece. He turned it over and
examined every part, as though it possessed a special attraction.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot," said Jack, pinching his arm, "you could beat William
Tell himself, if he were living, with the bow, but what's the
use of talking? It can't compare with the rifle and you know it.
Just because a gun of yours once flashed in the pan, you threw
it away and took up the bow again, but it was a mistake, all the
same."</p>

<p>"One of these days Deerfoot may use the rifle," he answered,
as if talking to himself, "but not yet&mdash;not yet."</p>

<p>Little did he suspect how close he was to the crisis which would
lead him to a decision on that question.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the three days referred to, the trio were
in what is to-day the southwestern corner of Missouri. Had the
time been a hundred years later, they would have had to go but
a short distance to cross the border line into Kansas.</p>

<p>A remarkable feature of their journey to that point, was the
fact that, while making the distance, they had not seen a single
person besides themselves. Not once, when they climbed a tree
or elevation and carefully scanned the country, did they catch
sight of the smoke of a solitary camp-fire creeping upward toward
the blue sky. They heard the crack of no gun beside their own,
and the keen eyes which glanced to the right and left, as they
trod the endless wilderness, failed to detect the figure of the
stealthily moving warrior.</p>

<p>This was singular, for there were plenty of Indians at that day
west of the Mississippi, and it would be hard to find a section
through which such a long journey could be made without coming
upon red men. But at the end of the three days, our friends could
not complain that there was any lack of dusky strangers.</p>

<p>It was near the middle of the afternoon, when finding themselves
in a dense portion of the wood, on a considerable elevation, they
decided to "take another observation". To Jack Carleton it looked
as if they were engaged on a hopeless errand, and, but for his
unbounded faith in Deerfoot, he would have turned back long before
in despair; it would be more proper indeed to say, that he never
would have entered alone on such an enterprise.</p>

<p>There was no need for the three to climb a tree, so two stood
on the ground while Deerfoot made his way among the limbs with
the nimbleness of a monkey.</p>

<p>He went to the very top, and balancing himself on the swaying
limb carefully parted the branches before his face. His penetrating
glance was rewarded by a sight which caused an amazed "hooh!"
to fall from his lips.</p>

<p>A little ways to the westward flowed a rapid stream, a hundred
yards wide. The other shore, for a rod or two, was bare of trees
and vegetation, except some stunted grass, and in this open space
was encamped a party of Indians. The sentinel in the tree counted
eleven, and suspected there were others who just then were not
in sight. Though it lacked several hours of darkness and the air
was pleasant, they had started a fire, big enough to warm a large
space. Some of them seemed to have been fishing in the stream,
for they had broiled a number of fish on the coals, and the nostrils
of the young Shawanoe detected their appetizing odor.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances there would have been nothing specially
interesting in the group, but Deerfoot had studied them but a
minute or two when he became convinced that they belonged to the
same tribe which held Otto Relstaub a prisoner. Their dress, looks,
and general appearance answered the description given by Hay-uta.</p>

<p>The heart of the youth beat faster over the thought that probably
the four warriors whom he was seeking to follow were among them,
and the fate of the German lad was about to be solved. He glanced
down the trunk of the tree, and saw Jack Carleton and the Sauk
standing on the ground and looking up at him, as though they suspected
from his manner that some important discovery had been made. Without
speaking, Deerfoot beckoned to the warrior to join him. The next
instant the fellow was climbing among the limbs with such vigor
that Deerfoot felt the jar at the very top.</p>

<p>Their combined weight was too great for such an elevation, and
the younger perched himself somewhat lower, so as to give Hay-uta
the advantage. A few words made known what Deerfoot had seen and
that he wished the elder to answer the questions which the Shawanoe
had asked himself.</p>

<p>Hay-uta was as guarded in his actions as Deerfoot could have
been. He spent several minutes in a study of the group on the
other side of the stream. Had he and the Shawanoe suspected they
were so close to a camp of red men, neither would have climbed
the tree, for little, if any thing, was to be gained by doing
so; the strangers could have been scrutinized from the ground
as well as from the elevation. It was a noteworthy fact that two
such skillful woodmen as Hay-uta and Deerfoot should approach
so close to another party without discovering it.</p>

<p>While Hay-uta was inspecting the warriors, Deerfoot quietly awaited
him on a limb some ten feet below, and Jack Carleton, peering
aloft from the ground until his neck ached, wondered what it all
meant.</p>

<p>The Sauk softly withdrew the hand extended in front of his face,
and the leaves came together with scarcely a rustle. With several
long reaches of his arms and legs, he placed himself beside his
friend below and told what he had learned. The two of course talked
in the Indian tongue and I give a liberal translation:</p>

<p>"What does my brother know?" asked Deerfoot.</p>

<p>"They belong to the tribe who took the pale-face; Hay-uta knows
not their name, but their looks show it."</p>

<p>"Then their village can not be far away."</p>

<p>"We must learn that of a surety for ourselves; two warriors among
them are the same that gave us the wampum and blankets for the
pale-face boy."</p>

<p>"Does my brother make no error?" asked Deerfoot, surprised to
be told they were so close upon the heels of a couple of the very
red men whom they scarcely hoped to find.</p>

<p>But the suspicion that such was the fact caused the Sauk to keep
up his scrutiny until no doubt was left. He assured Deerfoot of
the truth, adding that the taller was the one who handed over
the wampum, and who showed such a willingness to draw the Sauks
into a fight without waiting for provocation.</p>

<p>This was news of moment and raised several questions which the
friends discussed while perched in the tree. If two of the original
warriors were present, where were the others? Was it not likely
they were out of sight only for the time being? It seemed probable
that the four while journeying toward their own hunting grounds,
had joined a company of friends, with whom they were making the
rest of the trip.</p>

<p>Then followed the question, <em>What of Otto Relstaub?</em> Varied
as might be the answers to the question, all the probabilities
pointed to his death, and that, too, in the most painful manner;
but it was idle to grope in the field of conjecture. It was for
the friends to decide on the means of learning the truth.</p>

<p>In the hope of getting more knowledge, Deerfoot again climbed
to the highest point, and studied the group on the other side
of the stream; but was disappointed, and he and Hay-uta made their
way to the ground, where Jack Carleton was told all.</p>

<p>The eyes of the young Kentuckian expanded, and, when the story
was finished, he exclaimed in a guarded voice:</p>

<p>"They've got Otto&mdash;of course they have."</p>

<p>The expression of the Shawanoe's face showed he was not sure
of the meaning of his friend, who added:</p>

<p>"The whole four that had charge of him are with those fellows,
and, if Otto isn't there also we may as well give up and go back,
for he is no longer alive."</p>

<p>Deerfoot made no answer, but Jack was sure he shared the fear
with him.</p>

<p>A discussion of the situation and the difficulties before them,
led the two warriors to decide on a curious line of action.</p>

<p>It was agreed that one should cross boldly over and mingle with
the strangers, while the other should reconnoiter the camp and
learn what he could, without allowing himself to be seen.</p>

<p>It would be supposed that, inasmuch as Hay-uta was acquainted
with two of the Indians, and had parted from them on friendly
terms, he would be selected to enter camp, while Deerfoot's matchless
woodcraft would lead to his selection to work outside; but these
situations were reversed.</p>

<p>Since the strangers had journeyed far to the eastward into the
hunting grounds of the Sauks and Osages (probably to the very
shore of the great Mississippi), it followed that no surprise
should be felt by them to find that some equally inquiring red
man had traveled toward the Rocky Mountains, with a view of seeing
the strange land and its people. It was the intention of the young
Shawanoe to assume such a part. Should any mishap befall Hay-uta,
he would give out that he was engaged on a similar mission, and
not knowing he was near friends, he was reconnoitring the party
from a safer distance.</p>

<p>There were several reasons for this reversal of duties, as they
may be called, but it is necessary to give only one or two. The
appearance of Hay-uta among them most likely would raise suspicion
that it bore some relation to the captive Otto. The red men, therefore,
would be put upon their guard and the difficulty of securing him&mdash;if
alive&mdash;greatly increased.</p>

<p>But the strongest reason was that Deerfoot would be sure to do
better when brought in contact with the Indians. He was greatly
the superior of the Sauk in mental gifts, and, with his remarkable
power of reading sign language, would be sure to extract knowledge
that was beyond the reach of Hay-uta.</p>

<p>Having decided on the course they were to follow, no time was
lost in talking over the plan agreed upon. Jack Carleton was informed
of the particulars by Deerfoot.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's the best thing to be done, though my opinion
don't amount to much in <em>this</em> crowd. What am <em>I</em>
to do?"</p>

<p>"My brother may sleep," said the Shawanoe, with that slight approach
to humor which he sometimes showed.</p>

<p>"Yes; I would do a great deal of sleeping; but go ahead and I'll
be on the lookout for you. I don't suppose you can tell when you
are likely to get back?"</p>

<p>Deerfoot shook his head, but intimated that he hoped to learn
all that he sought to know before the coming night should end.</p>

<p>A few minutes previous to this, Hay-uta had walked down the stream,
keeping so far back that he could not be seen by any one on the
other side. The Shawanoe took the opposite direction, the purpose
of each being to act independently, and, in case circumstances
brought them together in the presence of the aliens, the agreement
was that Sauk and Shawanoe should comport themselves as though
they had never met before.</p>

<p>When the time should come for the scouts, as they may be called,
to return to the shore from which they started, they would have
no trouble in finding Jack Carleton, with whom it was easy to
communicate by means of signals. The most trying task was that
of the young Kentuckian himself, who was left without any employment
for mind or body.</p>

<p>Deerfoot walked several hundred yards up stream until he had
passed a bend, where he swam across. He kept his bow so far above
surface that the string was not wetted.</p>

<p>When he had surveyed himself, as best he could, he walked in
the direction of the camp of the hostiles, as he more than suspected
they should be classed. Had any one noticed him just then, he
would have observed that the Shawanoe walked with a limp, as though
suffering from some injury.</p>

<p>The readers of "Ned in the Block House," will recall that Deerfoot
once saved his life by feigning lameness, and the youth saw nothing
to lose and possibly much to gain by such strategy in the enterprise
on which he was engaged.</p>
