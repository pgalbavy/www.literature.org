<p>Altogether, then, I was scare so miserable the next days but
what I had many hopeful and happy snatches; threw myself with
a good deal of constancy upon my studies; and made out to endure
the time till Alan should arrive, or I might hear word of Catriona
by the means of James More. I had altogether three letters in
the time of our separation. One was to announce their arrival
in the town of Dunkirk in France, from which place James shortly
after started alone upon a private mission. This was to England
and to see Lord Holderness; and it has always been a bitter thought
that my good money helped to pay the charges of the same. But
he has need of a long spoon who soups with the de’il, or James
More either. During this absence, the time was to fall due for
another letter; and as the letter was the condition of his stipend,
he had been so careful as to prepare it beforehand and leave it
with Catriona to be despatched. The fact of our correspondence
aroused her suspicions, and he was no sooner gone than she had
burst the seal. What I received began accordingly in the writing
of James More:</p>

<p>"My dear Sir,—Your esteemed favour came to hand duly, and I have
to acknowledge the inclosure according to agreement. It shall
be all faithfully expended on my daughter, who is well, and desires
to be remembered to her dear friend. I find her in rather a melancholy
disposition, but trust in the mercy of God to see her re-established.
Our manner of life is very much alone, but we solace ourselves
with the melancholy tunes of our native mountains, and by walking
up the margin of the sea that lies next to Scotland. It was better
days with me when I lay with five wounds upon my body on the field
of Gladsmuir. I have found employment here in the <em>haras</em>
of a French nobleman, where my experience is valued. But, my dear
Sir, the wages are so exceedingly unsuitable that I would be ashamed
to mention them, which makes your remittances the more necessary
to my daughter’s comfort, though I daresay the sight of old friends
would be still better.</p>

<p>"My dear Sir, "Your affectionate, obedient servant, "James Macgregor
Drummond."</p>

<p>Below it began again in the hand of Catriona:—</p>

<p>"Do not be believing him, it is all lies together,—C. M. D."</p>

<p>Not only did she add this postscript, but I think she must have
come near suppressing the letter; for it came long after date,
and was closely followed by the third. In the time betwixt them,
Alan had arrived, and made another life to me with his merry conversation;
I had been presented to his cousin of the Scots-Dutch, a man that
drank more than I could have thought possible and was not otherwise
of interest; I had been entertained to many jovial dinners and
given some myself, all with no great change upon my sorrow; and
we two (by which I mean Alan and myself, and not at all the cousin)
had discussed a good deal the nature of my relations with James
More and his daughter. I was naturally diffident to give particulars;
and this disposition was not anyway lessened by the nature of
Alan’s commentary upon those I gave.</p>

<p>"I cannae make heed nor tail of it," he would say, "but it sticks
in my mind ye’ve made a gowk of yourself. There’s few people that
has had more experience than Alan Breck: and I can never call
to mind to have heard tell of a lassie like this one of yours.
The way that you tell it, the thing’s fair impossible. Ye must
have made a terrible hash of the business, David."</p>

<p>"There are whiles that I am of the same mind," said I.</p>

<p>"The strange thing is that ye seem to have a kind of fancy for
her too!" said Alan.</p>

<p>"The biggest kind, Alan," said I, "and I think I’ll take it to
my grave with me."</p>

<p>"Well, ye beat me, whatever!" he would conclude.</p>

<p>I showed him the letter with Catriona’s postscript. "And here
again!" he cried. "Impossible to deny a kind of decency to this
Catriona, and sense forby! As for James More, the man’s as boss
as a drum; he’s just a wame and a wheen words; though I’ll can
never deny that he fought reasonably well at Gladsmuir, and it’s
true what he says here about the five wounds. But the loss of
him is that the man’s boss."</p>

<p>"Ye see, Alan," said I, "it goes against the grain with me to
leave the maid in such poor hands."</p>

<p>"Ye couldnae weel find poorer," he admitted. "But what are ye
to do with it? It’s this way about a man and a woman, ye see,
Davie: The weemenfolk have got no kind of reason to them. Either
they like the man, and then a’ goes fine; or else they just detest
him, and ye may spare your breath—ye can do naething. There’s
just the two sets of them—them that would sell their coats for
ye, and them that never look the road ye’re on. That’s a’ that
there is to women; and you seem to be such a gomeral that ye cannae
tell the tane frae the tither."</p>

<p>"Well, and I’m afraid that’s true for me," said I.</p>

<p>"And yet there’s naething easier!" cried Alan. "I could easy
learn ye the science of the thing; but ye seem to me to be born
blind, and there’s where the deefficulty comes in."</p>

<p>"And can <em>you</em> no help me?" I asked, "you that are so
clever at the trade?"</p>

<p>"Ye see, David, I wasnae here," said he. "I’m like a field officer
that has naebody but blind men for scouts and <em>éclaireurs</em>;
and what would he ken? But it sticks in my mind that ye’ll have
made some kind of bauchle; and if I was you I would have a try
at her again."</p>

<p>"Would ye so, man Alan?" said I.</p>

<p>"I would e’en’t," says he.</p>

<p>The third letter came to my hand while we were deep in some such
talk: and it will be seen how pat it fell to the occasion. James
professed to be in some concern upon his daughter’s health, which
I believe was never better; abounded in kind expressions to myself;
and finally proposed that I should visit them at Dunkirk.</p>

<p>"You will now be enjoying the society of my old comrade Mr. Stewart,"
he wrote. "Why not accompany him so far in his return to France?
I have something very particular for Mr. Stewart’s ear; and, at
any rate, I would be pleased to meet in with an old fellow-soldier
and one so mettle as himself. As for you, my dear sir, my daughter
and I would be proud to receive our benefactor, whom we regard
as a brother and a son. The French nobleman has proved a person
of the most filthy avarice of character, and I have been necessitate
to leave the <em>haras</em>. You will find us in consequence a
little poorly lodged in the <em>auberge</em> of a man Bazin on
the dunes; but the situation is caller, and I make no doubt but
we might spend some very pleasant days, when Mr. Stewart and I
could recall our services, and you and my daughter divert yourselves
in a manner more befitting your age. I beg at least that Mr. Stewart
would come here; my business with him opens a very wide door."</p>

<p>"What does the man want with me?" cried Alan, when he had read.
"What he wants with you is clear enough—it’s siller. But what
can he want with Alan Breck?"</p>

<p>"O, it’ll be just an excuse," said I. "He is still after this
marriage, which I wish from my heart that we could bring about.
And he asks you because he thinks I would be less likely to come
wanting you."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish that I kent," says Alan. "Him and me were never
onyways pack; we used to girn at ither like a pair of pipers.
‘Something for my ear,’ quo’ he! I’ll maybe have something for
his hinder-end, before we’re through with it. Dod, I’m thinking
it would be a kind of divertisement to gang and see what he’ll
be after! Forby that I could see your lassie then. What say ye,
Davie? Will ye ride with Alan?"</p>

<p>You may be sure I was not backward, and Alan’s furlough running
towards an end, we set forth presently upon this joint adventure.</p>

<p>It was near dark of a January day when we rode at last into the
town of Dunkirk. We left our horses at the post, and found a guide
to Bazin’s Inn, which lay beyond the walls. Night was quite fallen,
so that we were the last to leave that fortress, and heard the
doors of it close behind us as we passed the bridge. On the other
side there lay a lighted suburb, which we thridded for a while,
then turned into a dark lane, and presently found ourselves wading
in the night among deep sand where we could hear a bullering of
the sea. We travelled in this fashion for some while, following
our conductor mostly by the sound of his voice; and I had begun
to think he was perhaps misleading us, when we came to the top
of a small brae, and there appeared out of the darkness a dim
light in a window.</p>

<p>"<em>Voilà l’auberge à Bazin</em>," says the guide.</p>

<p>Alan smacked his lips. "An unco lonely bit," said he, and I thought
by his tone he was not wholly pleased.</p>

<p>A little after, and we stood in the lower storey of that house,
which was all in the one apartment, with a stairs leading to the
chambers at the side, benches and tables by the wall, the cooking
fire at the one end of it, and shelves of bottles and the cellar-trap
at the other. Here Bazin, who was an ill-looking, big man, told
us the Scottish gentleman was gone abroad he knew not where, but
the young lady was above, and he would call her down to us.</p>

<p>I took from my breast that kerchief wanting the corner, and knotted
it about my throat. I could hear my heart go; and Alan patting
me on the shoulder with some of his laughable expressions, I could
scarce refrain from a sharp word. But the time was not long to
wait. I heard her step pass overhead, and saw her on the stair.
This she descended very quietly, and greeted me with a pale face
and a certain seeming of earnestness, or uneasiness, in her manner
that extremely dashed me.</p>

<p>"My father, James More, will be here soon. He will be very pleased
to see you," she said. And then of a sudden her face flamed, her
eyes lightened, the speech stopped upon her lips; and I made sure
she had observed the kerchief. It was only for a breath that she
was discomposed; but methought it was with a new animation that
she turned to welcome Alan. "And you will be his friend, Alan
Breck?" she cried. "Many is the dozen times I will have heard
him tell of you; and I love you already for all your bravery and
goodness."</p>

<p>"Well, well," says Alan, holding her hand in his and viewing
her, "and so this is the young lady at the last of it! David,
ye’re an awful poor hand of a description."</p>

<p>I do not know that ever I heard him speak so straight to people’s
hearts; the sound of his voice was like song.</p>

<p>"What? will he have been describing me?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Little else of it since I ever came out of France!" says he,
"forby a bit of a speciment one night in Scotland in a shaw of
wood by Silvermills. But cheer up, my dear! ye’re bonnier than
what he said. And now there’s one thing sure; you and me are to
be a pair of friends. I’m a kind of a henchman to Davie here;
I’m like a tyke at his heels; and whatever he cares for, I’ve
got to care for too—and by the holy airn! they’ve got to care
for me! So now you can see what way you stand with Alan Breck,
and ye’ll find ye’ll hardly lose on the transaction. He’s no very
bonnie, my dear, but he’s leal to them he loves."</p>

<p>"I thank you from my heart for your good words," said she. "I
have that honour for a brave, honest man that I cannot find any
to be answering with."</p>

<p>Using travellers’ freedom, we spared to wait for James More,
and sat down to meat, we threesome. Alan had Catriona sit by him
and wait upon his wants: he made her drink first out of his glass,
he surrounded her with continual kind gallantries, and yet never
gave me the most small occasion to be jealous; and he kept the
talk so much in his own hand, and that in so merry a note, that
neither she nor I remembered to be embarrassed. If any had seen
us there, it must have been supposed that Alan was the old friend
and I the stranger. Indeed, I had often cause to love and to admire
the man, but I never loved or admired him better than that night;
and I could not help remarking to myself (what I was sometimes
rather in danger of forgetting) that he had not only much experience
of life, but in his own way a great deal of natural ability besides.
As for Catriona, she seemed quite carried away; her laugh was
like a peal of bells, her face gay as a May morning; and I own,
although I was well pleased, yet I was a little sad also, and
thought myself a dull, stockish character in comparison of my
friend, and very unfit to come into a young maid’s life, and perhaps
ding down her gaiety.</p>

<p>But if that was like to be my part, I found that at least I was
not alone in it; for, James More returning suddenly, the girl
was changed into a piece of stone. Through the rest of that evening,
until she made an excuse and slipped to bed, I kept an eye upon
her without cease; and I can bear testimony that she never smiled,
scarce spoke, and looked mostly on the board in front of her.
So that I really marvelled to see so much devotion (as it used
to be) changed into the very sickness of hate.</p>

<p>Of James More it is unnecessary to say much; you know the man
already, what there was to know of him; and I am weary of writing
out his lies. Enough that he drank a great deal, and told us very
little that was to any possible purpose. As for the business with
Alan, that was to be reserved for the morrow and his private hearing.</p>

<p>It was the more easy to be put off, because Alan and I were pretty
weary with four day’s ride, and sat not very late after Catriona.</p>

<p>We were soon alone in a chamber where we were to make-shift with
a single bed. Alan looked on me with a queer smile.</p>

<p>"Ye muckle ass!" said he.</p>

<p>"What do ye mean by that?" I cried.</p>

<p>"Mean? What do I mean! It’s extraordinar, David man," say he,
"that you should be so mortal stupit."</p>

<p>Again I begged him to speak out.</p>

<p>"Well, it’s this of it," said he. "I told ye there were the two
kinds of women—them that would sell their shifts for ye, and the
others. Just you try for yoursel, my bonny man! But what’s that
neepkin at your craig?"</p>

<p>I told him.</p>

<p>"I thocht it was something thereabout," said he.</p>

<p>Nor would he say another word though I besieged him long with
importunities.</p>
