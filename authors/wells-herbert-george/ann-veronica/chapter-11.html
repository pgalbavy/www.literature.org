<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
The first night in prison she found it impossible to sleep.  The
bed was hard beyond any experience of hers, the bed-clothes
coarse and insufficient, the cell at once cold and stuffy.  The
little grating in the door, the sense of constant inspection,
worried her.  She kept opening her eyes and looking at it.  She
was fatigued physically and mentally, and neither mind nor body
could rest.  She became aware that at regular intervals a light
flashed upon her face and a bodiless eye regarded her, and this,
as the night wore on, became a torment. . . .
<P>
Capes came back into her mind.  He haunted a state between hectic
dreaming and mild delirium, and she found herself talking aloud
to him.  All through the night an entirely impossible and
monumental Capes confronted her, and she argued with him about
men and women.  She visualized him as in a policeman's uniform
and quite impassive.  On some insane score she fancied she had to
state her case in verse. "We are the music and you are the
instrument," she said; "we are verse and you are prose.     
<P>
     "For men have reason, women rhyme     
      A man scores always, all the time."
<P>
This couplet sprang into her mind from nowhere, and immediately
begot an endless series of similar couplets that she began to
compose and address to Capes.  They came teeming distressfully
through her aching brain:
<P>
     "A man can kick, his skirts don't tear;      
     A man scores always, everywhere.
<P>
     "His dress for no man lays a snare;     
     A man scores always, everywhere.
     For hats that fail and hats that flare;      
     Toppers their universal wear;      
     A man scores always, everywhere.
<P>
     "Men's waists are neither here nor there;     
     A man scores always, everywhere.
<P>
     "A man can manage without hair;      
     A man scores always, everywhere.
<P>
     "There are no males at men to stare;      
     A man scores always, everywhere.
<P>
     "And children must we women bear--
<P>
"Oh, damn!" she cried, as the hundred-and-first couplet or so
presented itself in her unwilling brain.
<P>
For a time she worried about that compulsory bath and cutaneous
diseases.
<P>
Then she fell into a fever of remorse for the habit of bad
language she had acquired.
<P>
     "A man can smoke, a man can swear;     
     A man scores always, everywhere."
<P>
She rolled over on her face, and stuffed her fingers in her ears
to shut out the rhythm from her mind.  She lay still for a long
time, and her mind resumed at a more tolerable pace.  She found
herself talking to Capes in an undertone of rational admission.
<P>
"There is something to be said for the lady-like theory after
all," she admitted.  "Women ought to be gentle and submissive
persons, strong only in virtue and in resistance to evil
compulsion.  My dear--I can call you that here, anyhow--I know
that.  The Victorians over-did it a little, I admit.  Their idea
of maidenly innocence was just a blank white--the sort of flat
white that doesn't shine.  But that doesn't alter the fact that
there IS innocence.  And I've read, and thought, and guessed, and
looked--until MY innocence--it's smirched.
<P>
"Smirched! . . .
<P>
"You see, dear, one IS passionately anxious for something--what
is it?  One wants to be CLEAN.  You want me to be clean.  You
would want me to be clean, if you gave me a thought, that is. . .
.
<P>
"I wonder if you give me a thought. . . .
<P>
"I'm not a good woman.  I don't mean I'm not a good woman--I mean
that I'm not a GOOD woman.  My poor brain is so mixed, dear, I
hardly know what I am saying.  I mean I'm not a good specimen of
a woman. I've got a streak of male.  Things happen to women--
proper women--and all they have to do is to take them well. 
They've just got to keep white.  But I'm always trying to make
things happen.  And I get myself dirty . . .
<P>
"It's all dirt that washes off, dear, but it's dirt.
<P>
"The white unaggressive woman who corrects and nurses and serves,
and is worshipped and betrayed--the martyr-queen of men, the
white mother. . . .  You can't do that sort of thing unless you
do it over religion, and there's no religion in me--of that
sort--worth a rap.
<P>
"I'm not gentle.  Certainly not a gentlewoman.
<P>
"I'm not coarse--no!  But I've got no purity of mind--no real
purity of mind.  A good woman's mind has angels with flaming
swords at the portals to keep out fallen thoughts. . . .
<P>
"I wonder if there are any good women really.
<P>
"I wish I didn't swear.  I do swear.  It began as a joke. . . . 
It developed into a sort of secret and private bad manners.  It's
got to be at last like tobacco-ash over all my sayings and
doings. . . .
<P>
" 'Go it, missie,' they said; "kick aht!'
<P>
"I swore at that policeman--and disgusted him. Disgusted him!
<P>
     "For men policemen never blush;      
     A man in all things scores so much . . .
<P>
<P>
"Damn!  Things are getting plainer.  It must be the dawn creeping
in.
<P>
     "Now here hath been dawning another blue day;      
     I'm just a poor woman, please take it away.
<P>
<P>
"Oh, sleep!  Sleep!  Sleep!  Sleep!"
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 2
<P>
<P>
"Now," said Ann Veronica, after the half-hour of exercise, and
sitting on the uncomfortable wooden seat without a back that was
her perch by day, "it's no good staying here in a sort of maze. 
I've got nothing to do for a month but think.  I may as well
think.  I ought to be able to think things out.
<P>
"How shall I put the question?  What am I?  What have I got to do
with myself? . . .
<P>
"I wonder if many people HAVE thought things out?
<P>
"Are we all just seizing hold of phrases and obeying moods?
<P>
"It wasn't so with old-fashioned people, they knew right from
wrong; they had a clear-cut, religious faith that seemed to
explain everything and give a rule for everything.  We haven't. 
I haven't, anyhow.  And it's no good pretending there is one when
there isn't. . . . I suppose I believe in God. . . .  Never
really thought about Him--people don't. . . .  I suppose my creed
is, 'I believe rather indistinctly in God the Father Almighty,
substratum of the evolutionary process, and, in a vein of vague
sentimentality that doesn't give a datum for anything at all, in
Jesus Christ, His Son.' . . .
<P>
"It's no sort of good, Ann Veronica, pretending one does believe
when one doesn't. . . .
<P>
"And as for praying for faith--this sort of monologue is about as
near as any one of my sort ever gets to prayer. Aren't I
asking--asking plainly now? . . .
<P>
"We've all been mixing our ideas, and we've got intellectual hot
coppers--every blessed one of us. . . .
<P>
"A confusion of motives--that's what I am! . . .
<P>
"There is this absurd craving for Mr. Capes--the 'Capes crave,'
they would call it in America.  Why do I want him so badly?  Why
do I want him, and think about him, and fail to get away from
him?
<P>
"It isn't all of me.
<P>
"The first person you love, Ann Veronica, is yourself--get hold
of that!  The soul you have to save is Ann Veronica's soul. . .
."
<P>
She knelt upon the floor of her cell and clasped her hands, and
remained for a long time in silence.
<P>
"Oh, God!" she said at last, "how I wish I had been taught to
pray!"
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 3
<P>
<P>
She had some idea of putting these subtle and difficult issues to
the chaplain when she was warned of his advent. But she had not
reckoned with the etiquette of Canongate. She got up, as she had
been told to do, at his appearance, and he amazed her by sitting
down, according to custom, on her stool.  He still wore his hat,
to show that the days of miracles and Christ being civil to
sinners are over forever.  She perceived that his countenance was
only composed by a great effort, his features severely
compressed.  He was ruffled, and his ears were red, no doubt from
some adjacent controversy.  He classified her as he seated
himself.
<P>
"Another young woman, I suppose," he said, "who knows better than
her Maker about her place in the world.  Have you anything to ask
me?"
<P>
Ann Veronica readjusted her mind hastily.  Her back stiffened. 
She produced from the depths of her pride the ugly investigatory
note of the modern district visitor. "Are you a special sort of
clergyman," she said, after a pause, and looking down her nose at
him, "or do you go to the Universities?"
<P>
"Oh!" he said, profoundly.
<P>
He panted for a moment with unuttered replies, and then, with a
scornful gesture, got up and left the cell.
<P>
So that Ann Veronica was not able to get the expert advice she
certainly needed upon her spiritual state.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 4
<P>
<P>
After a day or so she thought more steadily.  She found herself
in a phase of violent reaction against the suffrage movement, a
phase greatly promoted by one of those unreasonable objections
people of Ann Veronica's temperament take at times--to the girl
in the next cell to her own.  She was a large, resilient girl,
with a foolish smile, a still more foolish expression of
earnestness, and a throaty contralto voice.  She was noisy and
hilarious and enthusiastic, and her hair was always abominably
done.  In the chapel she sang with an open-lunged gusto that
silenced Ann Veronica altogether, and in the exercising-yard
slouched round with carelessly dispersed feet.  Ann Veronica
decided that "hoydenish ragger" was the only phrase to express
her.  She was always breaking rules, whispering asides,
intimating signals. She became at times an embodiment for Ann
Veronica of all that made the suffrage movement defective and
unsatisfying.
<P>
She was always initiating petty breaches of discipline. Her
greatest exploit was the howling before the mid-day meal.  This
was an imitation of the noises made by the carnivora at the
Zoological Gardens at feeding-time; the idea was taken up by
prisoner after prisoner until the whole place was alive with
barkings, yappings, roarings, pelican chatterings, and feline
yowlings, interspersed with shrieks of hysterical laughter.  To
many in that crowded solitude it came as an extraordinary relief.
It was better even than the hymn-singing.  But it annoyed Ann
Veronica.
<P>
"Idiots!" she said, when she heard this pandemonium, and with
particular reference to this young lady with the throaty
contralto next door.  "Intolerable idiots! . . ."
<P>
It took some days for this phase to pass, and it left some scars
and something like a decision.  "Violence won't do it," said Ann
Veronica.  "Begin violence, and the woman goes under. . . .
<P>
"But all the rest of our case is right. . . .  Yes."
<P>
As the long, solitary days wore on, Ann Veronica found a number
of definite attitudes and conclusions in her mind.
<P>
One of these was a classification of women into women who are and
women who are not hostile to men.  "The real reason why I am out
of place here," she said, "is because I like men.  I can talk
with them.  I've never found them hostile.  I've got no feminine
class feeling. I don't want any laws or freedoms to protect me
from a man like Mr. Capes.  I know that in my heart I would take
whatever he gave. . . .
<P>
"A woman wants a proper alliance with a man, a man who is better
stuff than herself.  She wants that and needs it more than
anything else in the world.  It may not be just, it may not be
fair, but things are so.  It isn't law, nor custom, nor masculine
violence settled that. It is just how things happen to be.  She
wants to be free--she wants to be legally and economically free,
so as not to be subject to the wrong man; but only God, who made
the world, can alter things to prevent her being slave to the
right one.
<P>
"And if she can't have the right one?
<P>
"We've developed such a quality of preference!"
<P>
She rubbed her knuckles into her forehead.  "Oh, but life is
difficult!" she groaned.  "When you loosen the tangle in one
place you tie a knot in another. . . .  Before there is any
change, any real change, I shall be dead--dead--dead and
finished--two hundred years! . . ."
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 5
<P>
<P>
One afternoon, while everything was still, the wardress heard her
cry out suddenly and alarmingly, and with great and unmistakable passion,
"Why in the name of goodness did I burn that twenty pounds?"
<P>
 
<P>
Part 6
<P>
<P>
She sat regarding her dinner.  The meat was coarse and
disagreeably served.
<P>
"I suppose some one makes a bit on the food," she said. . . .
<P>
"One has such ridiculous ideas of the wicked common people and
the beautiful machinery of order that ropes them in.  And here
are these places, full of contagion!
<P>
"Of course, this is the real texture of life, this is what we
refined secure people forget.  We think the whole thing is
straight and noble at bottom, and it isn't.  We think if we just
defy the friends we have and go out into the world everything
will become easy and splendid.  One doesn't realize that even the
sort of civilization one has at Morningside Park is held together
with difficulty.  By policemen one mustn't shock.
<P>
"This isn't a world for an innocent girl to walk about in.  It's
a world of dirt and skin diseases and parasites. It's a world in
which the law can be a stupid pig and the police-stations dirty
dens.  One wants helpers and protectors--and clean water.
<P>
"Am I becoming reasonable or am I being tamed?
<P>
"I'm simply discovering that life is many-sided and complex and
puzzling.  I thought one had only to take it by the throat.
<P>
"It hasn't GOT a throat!"
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 7
<P>
<P>
One day the idea of self-sacrifice came into her head, and she
made, she thought, some important moral discoveries.
<P>
It came with an extreme effect of re-discovery, a remarkable
novelty.  "What have I been all this time?" she asked herself,
and answered, "Just stark egotism, crude assertion of Ann
Veronica, without a modest rag of religion or discipline or
respect for authority to cover me!"
<P>
It seemed to her as though she had at last found the touchstone
of conduct.  She perceived she had never really thought of any
one but herself in all her acts and plans.  Even Capes had been
for her merely an excitant to passionate love--a mere idol at
whose feet one could enjoy imaginative wallowings.  She had set
out to get a beautiful life, a free, untrammelled life,
self-development, without counting the cost either for herself or
others.
<P>
"I have hurt my father," she said; "I have hurt my aunt.  I have
hurt and snubbed poor Teddy.  I've made no one happy.  I deserve
pretty much what I've got. . . .
<P>
"If only because of the way one hurts others if one kicks loose
and free, one has to submit. . . .
<P>
"Broken-in people!  I suppose the world is just all egotistical
children and broken-in people.
<P>
"Your little flag of pride must flutter down with the rest of
them, Ann Veronica. . . .
<P>
"Compromise--and kindness.
<P>
"Compromise and kindness.
<P>
"Who are YOU that the world should lie down at your feet?
<P>
"You've got to be a decent citizen, Ann Veronica. Take your half
loaf with the others.  You mustn't go clawing after a man that
doesn't belong to you--that isn't even interested in you.  That's
one thing clear.
<P>
"You've got to take the decent reasonable way. You've got to
adjust yourself to the people God has set about you.  Every one
else does."
<P>
She thought more and more along that line.  There was no reason
why she shouldn't be Capes' friend.  He did like her, anyhow; he
was always pleased to be with her.  There was no reason why she
shouldn't be his restrained and dignified friend.  After all,
that was life.  Nothing was given away, and no one came so rich
to the stall as to command all that it had to offer. Every one
has to make a deal with the world.
<P>
It would be very good to be Capes' friend.
<P>
She might be able to go on with biology, possibly even work upon
the same questions that he dealt with. . . .
<P>
Perhaps her granddaughter might marry his grandson. . . .
<P>
It grew clear to her that throughout all her wild raid for
independence she had done nothing for anybody, and many people
had done things for her.  She thought of her aunt and that purse
that was dropped on the table, and of many troublesome and
ill-requited kindnesses; she thought of the help of the Widgetts,
of Teddy's admiration; she thought, with a new-born charity, of
her father, of Manning's conscientious unselfishness, of Miss
Miniver's devotion.
<P>
"And for me it has been Pride and Pride and Pride!
<P>
"I am the prodigal daughter.  I will arise and go to my father,
and will say unto him--
<P>
"I suppose pride and self-assertion are sin?  Sinned against
heaven-- Yes, I have sinned against heaven and before thee. . . .
<P>
"Poor old daddy!  I wonder if he'll spend much on the fatted
calf? . . .
<P>
"The wrappered life-discipline!  One comes to that at last.  I
begin to understand Jane Austen and chintz covers and decency and
refinement and all the rest of it.  One puts gloves on one's
greedy fingers.  One learns to sit up . . .
<P>
"And somehow or other," she added, after a long interval, "I must
pay Mr. Ramage back his forty pounds."
<P>
