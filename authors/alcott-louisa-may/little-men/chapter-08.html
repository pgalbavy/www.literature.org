As there is no particular plan to this story, except to describe a few
scenes in the life at Plumfield for the amusement of certain little
persons, we will gently ramble along in this chapter and tell some
of the pastimes of Mrs. Jo's boys. I beg leave to assure my honored
readers that most of the incidents are taken from real life, and that
the oddest are the truest; for no person, no matter how vivid an
imagination he may have, can invent anything half so droll as the
freaks and fancies that originate in the lively brains of little people. </p>

<p>Daisy and Demi were full of these whims, and lived in a world of
their own, peopled with lovely or grotesque creatures, to whom
they gave the queerest names, and with whom they played the
queerest games. One of these nursery inventions was an invisible
sprite called &quot;The Naughty Kitty-mouse,&quot; whom the children had
believed in, feared, and served for a long time. They seldom spoke
of it to any one else, kept their rites as private as possible; and, as
they never tried to describe it even to themselves, this being had a
vague mysterious charm very agreeable to Demi, who delighted in
elves and goblins. A most whimsical and tyrannical imp was the
Naughty Kitty-mouse, and Daisy found a fearful pleasure in its
service, blindly obeying its most absurd demands, which were
usually proclaimed from the lips of Demi, whose powers of
invention were great. Rob and Teddy sometimes joined in these
ceremonies, and considered them excellent fun, although they did
not understand half that went on. </p>

<p>One day after school Demi whispered to his sister, with an
ominous wag of the head, </p>

<p>&quot;The Kitty-mouse wants us this afternoon.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What for?&quot; asked Daisy, anxiously. </p>

<p>&quot;A sackerryfice,&quot; answered Demi, solemnly. &quot;There must be a fire
behind the big rock at two o'clock, and we must all bring the things
we like best, and burn them!&quot; he added, with an awful emphasis on
the last words. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dear! I love the new paper dollies Aunt Amy painted for me
best of any thing; must I burn them up?&quot; cried Daisy, who never
thought of denying the unseen tyrant any thing it demanded. </p>

<p>&quot;Every one. I shall burn my boat, my best scrapbook, and all my
soldiers,&quot; said Demi firmly. </p>

<p>&quot;Well, I will; but it's too bad of Kitty-mouse to want our very
nicest things,&quot; sighed Daisy. </p>

<p>&quot;A sackerryfice means to give up what you are fond of, so we
must,&quot; explained Demi, to whom the new idea had been suggested
by hearing Uncle Fritz describe the customs of the Greeks to the
big boys who were reading about them in school. </p>

<p>&quot;Is Rob coming too,&quot; asked Daisy. </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and he is going to bring his toy village; it is all made of
wood, you know, and will burn nicely. We'll have a grand bonfire,
and see them blaze up, won't we?&quot; </p>

<p>This brilliant prospect consoled Daisy, and she ate her dinner with
a row of paper dolls before her, as a sort of farewell banquet. </p>

<p>At the appointed hour the sacrificial train set forth, each child
bearing the treasures demanded by the insatiable Kitty-mouse.
Teddy insisted on going also, and seeing that all the others had
toys, he tucked a squeaking lamb under one arm, and old
Annabella under the other, little dreaming what anguish the latter
idol was to give him. </p>

<p>&quot;Where are you going, my chickens?&quot; asked Mrs. Jo, as the flock
passed her door. </p>

<p>&quot;To play by the big rock; can't we?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, only don't do near the pond, and take good care of baby.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I always do,&quot; said Daisy, leading forth her charge with a capable
air. </p>

<p>&quot;Now, you must all sit round, and not move till I tell you. This flat
stone is an altar, and I am going to make a fire on it.&quot; </p>

<p>Demi then proceeded to kindle up a small blaze, as he had seen the
boys do at picnics. When the flame burned well, he ordered the
company to march round it three times and then stand in a circle. </p>

<p>&quot;I shall begin, and as fast as my things are burnt, you must bring
yours.&quot; </p>

<p>With that he solemnly laid on a little paper book full of pictures,
pasted in by himself; this was followed by a dilapidated boat, and
then one by one the unhappy leaden soldiers marched to death. Not
one faltered or hung back, from the splendid red and yellow
captain to the small drummer who had lost his legs; all vanished in
the flames and mingled in one common pool of melted lead. </p>

<p>&quot;Now, Daisy!&quot; called the high priest of Kitty-mouse, when his rich
offerings had been consumed, to the great satisfaction of the
children. </p>

<p>&quot;My dear dollies, how can I let them go?&quot; moaned Daisy, hugging
the entire dozen with a face full of maternal woe. </p>

<p>&quot;You must,&quot; commanded Demi; and with a farewell kiss to each,
Daisy laid her blooming dolls upon the coals. </p>

<p>&quot;Let me keep one, the dear blue thing, she is so sweet,&quot; besought
the poor little mamma, clutching her last in despair. </p>

<p>&quot;More! more!&quot; growled an awful voice, and Demi cried, &quot;that's the
Kitty-mouse! she must have every one, quick, or she will scratch
us.&quot; </p>

<p>In went the precious blue belle, flounces, rosy hat, and all, and
nothing but a few black flakes remained of that bright band. </p>

<p>&quot;Stand the houses and trees round, and let them catch themselves;
it will be like a real fire then,&quot; said Demi, who liked variety even
in his &quot;sackerryfices.&quot; </p>

<p>Charmed by this suggestion, the children arranged the doomed
village, laid a line of coals along the main street, and then sat
down to watch the conflagration. It was somewhat slow to kindle
owing to the paint, but at last one ambitious little cottage blazed
up, fired a tree of the palm species, which fell on to the roof of a
large family mansion, and in a few minutes the whole town was
burning merrily. The wooden population stood and stared at the
destruction like blockheads, as they were, till they also caught and
blazed away without a cry. It took some time to reduce the town to
ashes, and the lookers-on enjoyed the spectacle immensely,
cheering as each house fell, dancing like wild Indians when the
steeple flamed aloft, and actually casting one wretched little
churn-shaped lady, who had escaped to the suburbs, into the very
heart of the fire. </p>

<p>The superb success of this last offering excited Teddy to such a
degree, that he first threw his lamb into the conflagration, and
before it had time even to roast, he planted poor Annabella on the
funeral pyre. Of course she did not like it, and expressed her
anguish and resentment in a way that terrified her infant destroyer.
Being covered with kid, she did not blaze, but did what was worse,
she squirmed. First one leg curled up, then the other, in a very
awful and lifelike manner; next she flung her arms over her head
as if in great agony; her head itself turned on her shoulders, her
glass eyes fell out, and with one final writhe of her whole body,
she sank down a blackened mass on the ruins of the town. This
unexpected demonstration startled every one and frightened Teddy
half out of his little wits. He looked, then screamed and fled
toward the house, roaring &quot;Marmar&quot; at the top of his voice. </p>

<p>Mrs. Bhaer heard the outcry and ran to the rescue, but Teddy could
only cling to her and pour out in his broken way something about
&quot;poor Bella hurted,&quot; &quot;a dreat fire,&quot; and &quot;all the dollies dorn.&quot;
Fearing some dire mishap, his mother caught him up and hurried
to the scene of action, where she found the blind worshippers of
Kitty-mouse mourning over the charred remains of the lost darling. </p>

<p>&quot;What have you been at? Tell me all about it,&quot; said Mrs. Jo,
composing herself to listen patiently, for the culprits looked so
penitent, she forgave them beforehand. </p>

<p>With some reluctance Demi explained their play, and Aunt Jo
laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks, the children were so
solemn, and the play was so absurd. </p>

<p>&quot;I thought you were too sensible to play such a silly game as this.
If I had any Kitty-mouse I'd have a good one who liked you to play
in safe pleasant ways, and not destroy and frighten. Just see what a
ruin you have made; all Daisy's pretty dolls, Demi's soldiers, and
Rob's new village beside poor Teddy's pet lamb, and dear old
Annabella. I shall have to write up in the nursery the verse that
used to come in the boxes of toys, </p>

<p>&quot;The children of Holland take pleasure in making, </p>

<p>What the children of Boston take pleasure in breaking.&quot;</p>

<p>Only I shall put Plumfield instead of Boston.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We never will again, truly, truly!&quot; cried the repentant little
sinners, much abashed at this reproof. </p>

<p>&quot;Demi told us to,&quot; said Rob. </p>

<p>&quot;Well, I heard Uncle tell about the Greece people, who had altars
and things, and so I wanted to be like them, only I hadn't any live
creatures to sackerryfice, so we burnt up our toys.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Dear me, that is something like the bean story,&quot; said Aunt Jo,
laughing again. </p>

<p>&quot;Tell about it,&quot; suggested Daisy, to change the subject. </p>

<p>&quot;Once there was a poor woman who had three or four little
children, and she used to lock them up in her room when she went
out to work, to keep them safe. On day when she was going away
she said, 'Now, my dears, don't let baby fall out of window, don't
play with the matches, and don't put beans up your noses.' Now the
children had never dreamed of doing that last thing, but she put it
into their heads, and the minute she was gone, they ran and stuffed
their naughty little noses full of beans, just to see how it felt, and
she found them all crying when she came home.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Did it hurt?&quot; asked Rob, with such intense interest that his mother
hastily added a warning sequel, lest a new edition of the bean story
should appear in her own family. </p>

<p>&quot;Very much, as I know, for when my mother told me this story, I
was so silly that I went and tried it myself. I had no beans, so I
took some little pebbles, and poked several into my nose. I did not
like it at all, and wanted to take them out again very soon, but one
would not come, and I was so ashamed to tell what a goose I been
that I went for hours with the stone hurting me very much. At last
the pain got so bad I had to tell, and when my mother could not get
it out the doctor came. Then I was put in a chair and held tight,
Rob, while he used his ugly little pincers till the stone hopped out.
Dear me! how my wretched little nose did ache, and how people
laughed at me!&quot; and Mrs. Jo shook her head in a dismal way, as if
the memory of her sufferings was too much for her. </p>

<p>Rob looked deeply impressed and I am glad to say took the
warning to heart. Demi proposed that they should bury poor
Annabella, and in the interest of the funeral Teddy forgot his
fright. Daisy was soon consoled by another batch of dolls from
Aunt Amy, and the Naughty Kitty-mouse seemed to be appeased
by the last offerings, for she tormented them no more. </p>

<p>&quot;Brops&quot; was the name of a new and absorbing play, invented by
Bangs. As this interesting animal is not to be found in any
Zoological Garden, unless Du Chaillu has recently brought one
from the wilds of Africa, I will mention a few of its peculiar habits
and traits, for the benefit of inquiring minds. The Brop is a winged
quadruped, with a human face of a youthful and merry aspect.
When it walks the earth it grunts, when it soars it gives a shrill
hoot, occasionally it goes erect, and talks good English. Its body is
usually covered with a substance much resembling a shawl,
sometimes red, sometimes blue, often plaid, and, strange to say,
they frequently change skins with one another. On their heads they
have a horn very like a stiff brown paper lamp-lighter. Wings of
the same substance flap upon their shoulders when they fly; this is
never very far from the ground, as they usually fall with violence if
they attempt any lofty flights. They browse over the earth, but can
sit up and eat like the squirrel. Their favorite nourishment is the
seed-cake; apples also are freely taken, and sometimes raw carrots
are nibbled when food is scarce. They live in dens, where they
have a sort of nest, much like a clothes-basket, in which the little
Brops play till their wings are grown. These singular animals
quarrel at times, and it is on these occasions that they burst into
human speech, call each other names, cry, scold, and sometimes
tear off horns and skin, declaring fiercely that they &quot;won't play.&quot;
The few privileged persons who have studied them are inclined to
think them a remarkable mixture of the monkey, the sphinx, the
roc, and the queer creatures seen by the famous Peter Wilkins. </p>

<p>This game was a great favorite, and the younger children beguiled
many a rainy afternoon flapping or creeping about the nursery,
acting like little bedlamites and being as merry as little grigs. To
be sure, it was rather hard upon clothes, particularly trouser-knees,
and jacket-elbows; but Mrs. Bhaer only said, as she patched and
darned, </p>

<p>&quot;We do things just as foolish, and not half so harmless. If I could
get as much happiness out of it as the little dears do, I'd be a Brop
myself.&quot; </p>

<p>Nat's favorite amusements were working in his garden, and sitting
in the willow-tree with his violin, for that green nest was a fairy
world to him, and there he loved to perch, making music like a
happy bird. The lads called him &quot;Old Chirper,&quot; because he was
always humming, whistling, or fiddling, and they often stopped a
minute in their work or play to listen to the soft tones of the violin,
which seemed to lead a little orchestra of summer sounds. The
birds appeared to regard him as one of themselves, and fearlessly
sat on the fence or lit among the boughs to watch him with their
quick bright eyes. The robins in the apple-tree near by evidently
considered him a friend, for the father bird hunted insects close
beside him, and the little mother brooded as confidingly over her
blue eggs as if the boy was only a new sort of blackbird who
cheered her patient watch with his song. The brown brook babbled
and sparkled below him, the bees haunted the clover fields on
either side, friendly faces peeped at him as they passed, the old
house stretched its wide wings hospitably toward him, and with a
blessed sense of rest and love and happiness, Nat dreamed for
hours in this nook, unconscious what healthful miracles were
being wrought upon him. </p>

<p>One listener he had who never tired, and to whom he was more
than a mere schoolmate. Poor Billy's chief delight was to lie beside
the brook, watching leaves and bits of foam dance by, listening
dreamily to the music in the willow-tree. He seemed to think Nat a
sort of angel who sat aloft and sang, for a few baby memories still
lingered in his mind and seemed to grow brighter at these times.
Seeing the interest he took in Nat, Mr. Bhaer begged him to help
them lift the cloud from the feeble brain by this gentle spell. Glad
to do any thing to show his gratitude, Nat always smiled on Billy
when he followed him about, and let him listen undisturbed to the
music which seemed to speak a language he could understand.
&quot;Help one another,&quot; was a favorite Plumfield motto, and Nat
learned how much sweetness is added to life by trying to live up to
it. </p>

<p>Jack Ford's peculiar pastime was buying and selling; and he bid
fair to follow in the footsteps of his uncle, a country merchant,
who sold a little of every thing and made money fast. Jack had
seen the sugar sanded, the molasses watered, the butter mixed with
lard, and things of that kind, and labored under the delusion that it
was all a proper part of the business. His stock in trade was of a
different sort, but he made as much as he could out of every worm
he sold, and always got the best of the bargain when he traded with
the boys for string, knives, fish-hooks, or whatever the article
might be. The boys who all had nicknames, called him &quot;Skinflint,&quot;
but Jack did not care as long as the old tobacco-pouch in which he
kept his money grew heavier and heavier. </p>

<p>He established a sort of auction-room, and now and then sold off
all the odds and ends he had collected, or helped the lads exchange
things with one another. He got bats, balls, hockey-sticks, etc.,
cheap, from one set of mates, furbished them up, and let them for a
few cents a time to another set, often extending his business
beyond the gates of Plumfield in spite of the rules. Mr. Bhaer put a
stop to some of his speculations, and tried to give him a better idea
of business talent than mere sharpness in overreaching his
neighbors. Now and then Jack made a bad bargain, and felt worse
about it than about any failure in lessons or conduct, and took his
revenge on the next innocent customer who came along. His
account-book was a curiosity; and his quickness at figures quite
remarkable. Mr. Bhaer praised him for this, and tried to make his
sense of honesty and honor as quick; and, by and by, when Jack
found that he could not get on without these virtues, he owned that
his teacher was right. </p>

<p>Cricket and football the boys had of course; but, after the stirring
accounts of these games in the immortal &quot;Tom Brown at Rugby,&quot;
no feeble female pen may venture to do more than respectfully
allude to them. </p>

<p>Emil spent his holidays on the river or the pond, and drilled the
elder lads for a race with certain town boys, who now and then
invaded their territory. The race duly came off, but as it ended in a
general shipwreck, it was not mentioned in public; and the
Commodore had serious thoughts of retiring to a desert island, so
disgusted was he with his kind for a time. No desert island being
convenient, he was forced to remain among his friends, and found
consolation in building a boat-house. </p>

<p>The little girls indulged in the usual plays of their age, improving
upon them somewhat as their lively fancies suggested. The chief
and most absorbing play was called &quot;Mrs. Shakespeare Smith;&quot; the
name was provided by Aunt Jo, but the trials of the poor lady were
quite original. Daisy was Mrs. S. S., and Nan by turns her daughter
or a neighbor, Mrs. Giddygaddy. </p>

<p>No pen can describe the adventures of these ladies, for in one short
afternoon their family was the scene of births, marriages, deaths,
floods, earthquakes, tea-parties, and balloon ascensions. Millions
of miles did these energetic women travel, dressed in hats and
habits never seen before by mortal eye, perched on the bed, driving
the posts like mettlesome steeds, and bouncing up and down till
their heads spun. Fits and fires were the pet afflictions, with a
general massacre now and then by way of change. Nan was never
tired of inventing fresh combinations, and Daisy followed her
leader with blind admiration. Poor Teddy was a frequent victim,
and was often rescued from real danger, for the excited ladies were
apt to forget that he was not of the same stuff their longsuffering
dolls. Once he was shut into the closet for a dungeon, and
forgotten by the girls, who ran off to some out-of-door game.
Another time he was half drowned in the bath-tub, playing be a
&quot;cunning little whale.&quot; And, worst of all, he was cut down just in
time after being hung up for a robber. </p>

<p>But the institution most patronized by all was the Club. It had no
other name, and it needed none, being the only one in the
neighborhood. The elder lads got it up, and the younger were
occasionally admitted if they behaved well. Tommy and Demi
were honorary members, but were always obliged to retire
unpleasantly early, owing to circumstances over which they had no
control. The proceedings of this club were somewhat peculiar, for
it met at all sorts of places and hours, had all manner of queer
ceremonies and amusements, and now and then was broken up
tempestuously, only to be re-established, however, on a firmer
basis. </p>

<p>Rainy evenings the members met in the schoolroom, and passed
the time in games: chess, morris, backgammon, fencing matches,
recitations, debates, or dramatic performances of a darkly tragical
nature. In summer the barn was the rendezvous, and what went on
there no uninitiated mortal knows. On sultry evenings the Club
adjourned to the brook for aquatic exercises, and the members sat
about in airy attire, frog-like and cool. On such occasions the
speeches were unusually eloquent, quite flowing, as one might say;
and if any orator's remarks displeased the audience, cold water was
thrown upon him till his ardor was effectually quenched. Franz
was president, and maintained order admirably, considering the
unruly nature of the members. Mr. Bhaer never interfered with
their affairs, and was rewarded for this wise forbearance by being
invited now and then to behold the mysteries unveiled, which he
appeared to enjoy much. </p>

<p>When Nan came she wished to join the Club, and caused great
excitement and division among the gentlemen by presenting
endless petitions, both written and spoken, disturbing their
solemnities by insulting them through the key-hole, performing
vigorous solos on the door, and writing up derisive remarks on
walls and fences, for she belonged to the &quot;Irrepressibles.&quot; Finding
these appeals in vain, the girls, by the advice of Mrs. Jo, got up an
institution of their own, which they called the Cosy Club. To this
they magnanimously invited the gentlemen whose youth excluded
them from the other one, and entertained these favored beings so
well with little suppers, new games devised by Nan, and other
pleasing festivities, that, one by one, the elder boys confessed a
desire to partake of these more elegant enjoyments, and, after
much consultation, finally decided to propose an interchange of
civilities. </p>

<p>The members of the Cosy Club were invited to adorn the rival
establishment on certain evenings, and to the surprise of the
gentlemen their presence was not found to be a restraint upon the
conversation or amusement of the regular frequenters; which could
not be said of all Clubs, I fancy. The ladies responded handsomely
and hospitably to these overtures of peace, and both institutions
flourished long and happily. </p>
