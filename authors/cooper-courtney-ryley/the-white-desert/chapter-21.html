<p>Silence was their portion as they turned toward the mountains.  There
was little to say.  Now and then as Houston, in the lead, got off the
trail, Medaine jerked on the cord to draw his attention, then pointed,
and Barry obeyed.  Thus their pilgrimage progressed.
</p>
<p>An hour found them in the hills, plodding steadily upward, following
the smoother mounds of snow which indicated heavy, secure drifts, at
times progressing easily, almost swiftly, at others veering and
tacking, making the precipitous ascent by digging their shoes into the
snow and literally pulling themselves up, step by step.  Here, where
the crags rose about them, where sheer granite walls, too steep, too
barren to form a resting place even for the driven snow, rose brown and
gaunt above them, where the wind seemed to shriek at them from a
hundred places at once, Houston dropped slowly back to watch the effect
that it all was having upon the girl, to study her strength and her
ability to go on.  But there was no weakening in the sturdy little
step, no evidence of fatigue.  As they went higher, and the wind beat
against them with its hail of splintered ice particles, Houston saw her
heavily gloved hands go to her face in sudden pain and remain there.
The man went to her side, and grasping her by the shoulder, stopped
her.  Then, without explanation, he brought forth a heavy bandanna
handkerchief and tied it about her features, as high as possible
without shutting off the sight.  Her eyes thanked him.  They went on.
</p><p>Higher--higher! the old cracks of Houston's lips, formed in his days of
wandering, opened and began to bleed, the tiny, red drops falling on
his clothing and congealing there.  The flying ice cut his skin; he
knew that his eyeballs were becoming red again, the blood-red where
never a speck of white showed, only black pupils staring forth from a
sea of carmine.  Harder and swifter the wind swept about them; its
force greater than the slight form of the woman could resist.  Close
went Houston to her; his arm encircled her--and she did not resist--she
who, down there in the west country in the days that had gone, would
have rebelled at the touch of his hand!  But now they were in a strange
land where personalities had vanished; two beings equipped with human
intelligence and the power of locomotion, little more.  All else in
their natures had become subjugated to the greater tasks which faced
them; the primitive had come to life; they were fighting against every
vengeful weapon which an outraged Nature could hurl,--fighting at
cross-purposes, he to fulfill a promise to a woman who might even now
be dead, she to assuage the promptings of a merciful nature, even to
the extent of the companionship of a man she had been led to revile.
</p><p>Afternoon came, and the welcome shelter of a ledge where the snow had
drifted far outward, leaving a small space of dry rock,--to them like
an island to a drifting victim of shipwreck.  There they stopped, to
bring food from the small provision pack which had been shifted to
Medaine's shoulders, to eat silently, then, without a word, to rise and
go onward.
</p><p>Miles and miles,--rods in fact.  Aeons of space after that, in which
huddled, bent figures in the grip of stormdom, climbed, veering,
swinging about the easier stretches, crawling at painfully slow pace up
the steeper inclines.  Upward through the stinging blast of the tempest
they went, toward the top of a stricken world.  Late afternoon; then
Medaine turned toward the bleeding man beside her.
</p><p>"A mile more."
</p><p>She said no more.  He nodded in answer and extended a hand to aid her
over a slippery stretch of ice-coated granite.  Timber line came and
went.  The snowfall ceased, to give way to the grayness of heavy,
scudding clouds and the spasmodic flurries of driving white, as the
gusty wind caught up the loose fall of the drifts and whirled it on,
like harassed, lost souls seeking in vain a place they could abide.
And it was in one of the moments of quiet that Medaine pointed above.
</p><p>Five splotches showed on the mountain side,--the roofs of as many
cabins; the rest of them were buried in snow.  No smoke came from the
slanting chimneys; no avenues were shoveled to the doorways; the drifts
were unbroken.
</p><p>"Gone!" Houston voiced the monosyllable.
</p><p>"Yes.  Probably on to Crestline.  I was afraid of it."
</p><p>"Night's coming."
</p><p>"It's too late to turn back now."
</p><p>And in spite of the pain of bleeding, snow-burned lips, Houston smiled
at her,--the smile that a man might give a sister of whom he was
inordinately proud.
</p><p>"Are you afraid?"
</p><p>"Of what?"
</p><p>"Me."
</p><p>She did not answer for a moment.  Then:
</p><p>"Are you afraid--of yourself?"
</p><p>"No.  Only men with something on their conscience are afraid."
</p><p>She looked at him queerly, then turned away.  Houston again took the
lead, rounding the stretches, then waiting for her, halting at the
dangerous gulleys and guiding her safely across, but silently.  He had
said enough; more would require explanations.  And there was a pack
upon his back which contained a tiny form with tight-curled hands, with
eyes that were closed,--a poor, nameless little thing he had sworn to
carry to grace and to protection.  At last they reached the cabins.
Houston untied the bond which connected them and loosened his
snowshoes, that he might plunge into the smallest drift before a door
and force his way within.  There was no wood; he tore the clapboards
from a near-by cabin and the tar paper from the wind-swept roof.  Five
minutes later a fire was booming; a girl tired, bent-shouldered, her
eyes drooping from a sudden desire for sleep, huddled near it.  Houston
walked to the pack and took food.
</p><p>"You would rather eat alone?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"I shall be in the next cabin--awake."
</p><p>"Awake?"
</p><p>"Yes.  I'd rather--keep watch."
</p><p>"But there is nothing--"
</p><p>"Illness--a snowslide--a fresh drift.  I would feel easier in mind.
Good night."
</p><p>Then with his snowshoes and his pack of death, he went out the door, to
plunge through another drift, to force his way into a cabin, and there,
a plodding, dumb figure, go soddenly about the duties of comfort.  And
more than once in the howling, blustery night which followed, Houston
shivered, shook himself into action and rose to rebuild a fire that had
died while he had sat hunched in the hard, uncomfortable chair beside
it, trying to fathom what the day had meant, striving to hope for the
keeping of the promises that an hysterical woman had made, struggling
for the strength to go on,--on with this cheery, brave little bit of
humanity in the next cabin, without a word in self-extenuation, without
a hint to break the lack of estimation in which she held him, without a
plea in his own defense.  And some way, Houston felt that such a plea
now would be cheap and tawdry; they were in a world where there were
bigger things than human aims and human frailties.  Besides, he had
locked his lips at the command of a grief-ridden woman.  To open them
in self-extenuation would mean that she must be brought into it; for
she had been the one who had clinched the points of suspicion in the
mind of Medaine Robinette.  Were he now to speak of proof that she had
lied--
</p><p>It was impossible.  The wind-swept night became wind-swept dawn, to
find him still huddled there, still thinking, still grim and drawn and
haggard with sleeplessness and fatigue.  Then he rose at a call from
without:
</p><p>"Are you ready?"
</p><p>He affixed the pack.  Together they went on again, graceless figures in
frozen clothing, she pointing the way, he aiding her with his strength,
in the final battle toward the summit of the range,--and Crestline.
</p><p>Hours they plodded and climbed, climbed and plodded, the blood again
dripping from his lips, her features again shielded by the heavy folds
of the bandanna; the moisture of their breath at times swirling about
them like angry steam, at others invisible in the areas of sudden
dryness, where the atmosphere lapped up even the vapors of laboring
lungs before it could visualize.  Snow and cloud and rising walls of
granite: this was their world, and they crawling pigmies within it.
Once she brushed against the pack on his back and drew away with a
sudden recoil.  Houston dully realized the reason.  The selfish,
gripping hands of Winter, holding nothing sacred, had invaded even
there.
</p><p>Noon.  And a half-cry from both of them, a burst of energy which soon
faded.  For above was Crestline--even as the little Croatian settlement
had been--smokeless, lifeless.  They had gone from here also, hurrying
humans fleeing with the last snowplow before the tempest, beings afraid
to remain, once the lines of communication were broken.  But there was
nothing to do but go on.
</p><p>Roofless houses met them, stacks of crumpled snow, where the beams had
cracked beneath the weight of high piled drifts; staring, glassless
windows and rooms filled with white; stoves that no longer fought the
clasp of winter but huddled instead amid piles of snow; that was all.
Crestline had fled; there was no life, no sound, only the angry,
wailing cry of the wind through half-frozen roof spouts, the slap of
clattering boards, loosened by the storm.  Gloomily Houston surveyed
the desolate picture, at last to turn to the girl.
</p><p>"I must go on.  I gave my promise."
</p><p>She nodded.
</p><p>"It means Tollifer now.  The descent is more dangerous."
</p><p>"Do you know it?"
</p><p>"Not as well as the other.  If I only had something to guide me."
</p><p>And as if in answer, the storm lifted for a moment.  Gradually the wind
stilled, in one of those stretches of calm which seem to be only the
breeding spots of more terror, more bitterness.  But they gave no heed
to that, nor to the red ball of the sun, faintly visible through the
clouds.  Far below, miles in reality, straight jets of steam rose high
above black, curling smoke; faintly, distantly, whistles sounded.  The
snowplows!
</p><p>He gripped her arm with the sight of it, nor did she resist.  Thrilled,
enthralled, they watched it: the whirling smoke, the shooting steam,
the white spray which indicated the grinding, churning progress of the
plows, propelled by the heavy engines behind.  Words came from the
swollen lips of Houston, but the voice was hoarse, strained, unnatural:
</p><p>"They've started the fight!  They've--"
</p><p>"It's on the second grade, up from Tollifer.  It's fairly easy there,
you know, for ten or twelve miles.  They're making that without
difficulty--their work won't come until they strike the snowsheds at
Crystal Lake.  Oh--" and there was in the voice all the yearning, the
anxiety that a pent-up soul could know--"I wish I were a man now!  I
wish I were a man--to help!"
</p><p>"I hope--" and Houston said it without thought of bravado--"that I may
have the strength for both of us.  I'm a man--after a sort.  I'm going
to work with them."
</p><p>"But--"
</p><p>He knew what she meant and shook his head.
</p><p>"No--she does not need me.  My presence would mean nothing to her.  I
can't tell you why.  My place--is down there."
</p><p>For an instant Medaine Robinette looked at him with frankly questioning
eyes, eyes which told that a thought was beginning to form somewhere
back in her brain, a question arising as to his guilt in at least one
of the things which circumstances had arrayed against him.  Some way
Barry felt that she knew that a man willing to encounter the dangers of
a snowy range would hurry again to the side of the woman for whom he
had dared them, unless--  But suddenly she was speaking, as though to
divert her thoughts.
</p><p>"We'll have about three hours--from the looks of the sky.  Unless
conditions change quickly, there'll not be another blow before night.
It's our chance.  We'd better cut this cord--the one in the lead may
fall and pull the other one over.  We had better make haste."
</p><p>Houston stepped before her.  A moment later they were edging their way
down the declivity of what once had been a railroad track, at last to
veer.  The drifts from the mountain side had become too sharp; it was
easier to accept the more precipitous and shorter journey, straight
downward, the nearest cut toward those welcome spires of smoke.
</p><p>Gradually the snow shook or was melted from their clothing, through
sheer bodily warmth.  Black dots they became,--dots which appeared late
in the afternoon to the laboring crews of the snow-fighters far below;
dots which appeared and disappeared, edging their way about beetling
precipices, plunging forward, then stopping; pulling themselves out of
the heavier drifts, where drops of ten and even twenty feet had thrown
them; swinging and tacking; scrambling downward in long, almost running
descents, then crawling slowly along the ice walls, while the jutting
peaks about them seemed to close them in, seemed to threaten and seek
to engulf them in their pitfalls, only to break from them at last and
allow them once more to resume their journey.
</p><p>Breaks and stops, falls and plunges into drift after drift; through the
glasses the workers below could see that a man was in the lead, with
something strapped to his back, which the woman in the rear adjusted
now and then, when it became partially displaced by the plunging
journey.  Banks of snow cut them off; snowshoes sank in air
pockets--holes made by protruding limbs of the short, gnarled trees of
timber line,--and through these the man fought in short, spasmodic
lunges, breaking the way for the woman who came behind, never stopping
except to gather strength for a fresh attack, never ceasing for
obstacle or for danger.  Once, at the edge of an overhanging ledge, he
scrambled furiously, failed and fell,--to drop in a drift far below, to
crawl painfully back to the waiting dot above, and to guide her, by
safer paths, on downward.  Hours!  The dots grew larger.  The glasses
no longer were needed.  On they came, stumbling, reeling, at last to
stagger across the frozen, wind-swept surface of a small lake and
toward the bunk cars of the snow crews.  The woman wavered and fell; he
caught her.  Then double-weighted, a pack on his back, a form in his
arms, he came on, his blood-red eyes searching almost sightlessly the
faces of the waiting, stolid, grease-smeared men, his thick voice
drooling over bloody lips:
</p><p>"Somebody take her--get her into the bunk cars.  She's given out.
I'm--  I'm all right.  Take care of her.  I've got to go on--to
Tollifer!"
