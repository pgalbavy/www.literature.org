<p>There were six of them, all coming out as clearly in the powerful
moonlight as if the sun were in the heavens. The stout form of
General Yozarro was at the front, walking at a moderate pace up
the slope.</p>

<p>The moment he entered the field of vision, Major Starland heard
Martella gasp, as if catching his breath. Then the American felt
a hand upon his rifle, as if the other were trying to draw it
from his grasp.</p>

<p>"My chance can never be better," whispered the deserter.</p>

<p>"I will not allow murder to be done; a brave man would not ask
it."</p>

<p>The native loosened his straining grip upon the weapon, and all
silently peered from the gloom at the procession filing past.
None of the spectators spoke, but each caught the sounds of fitful
conversation among the Atlamalcans. No one could have been more
generous than the Dictator in the way of imprecations, which was
no cause for surprise to Miss Starland.</p>

<p>Until the purchase of the tugboat, General Yozarro had usually
passed between his capital and the Castle of Rest on horseback.
Now, however, he preferred the water route, although it compelled
him to walk a difficult mile.</p>

<p>At the moment when the rear of the procession was opposite our
friends, who were breathlessly watching from their hiding place,
the pony suddenly threw up his head and emitted a resounding whinny
that could have been heard a mile away.</p>

<p>"That means a fight!" exclaimed the Major, tightening his grasp
on his rifle; "be ready, Captain and Martella!"</p>

<p>The moment the alarming cry echoed among the mountains, General
Yozarro and his friends stopped and stared in the direction of
the disturbance. Martella was the only one with the quickness
of resource to meet the crisis. In a twinkling, he slipped the
bridle of the horse over his head, unfastened the cinch and flung
the saddle to the ground. Then, pointing the nose of the animal
toward the trail, he gave his haunch a pinch like the nipping
of a fire ant. The animal responded with a snort and leap, and
then trotted to the group who stared at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>The Major and the Captain caught the shrewdness of the action.
By driving out the horse without any belongings, he gave the impression
that he was an estray, probably cropping the herbage, when disturbed
by the approach of strangers. He had not been ridden long enough
to show the marks of bridle or saddle, unless examined closely,
which was not likely to be the case.</p>

<p>"They may learn the truth," whispered Martella; "be ready!"</p>

<p>The animal slowed his pace and walked snuffing suspiciously to
the waiting company. When one of the officers reached out to grasp
his forelock, he flirted his head away. The brute preferred his
freedom to serving a master.</p>

<p>Some natural surprise was expressed that he should be wandering
alone, so far from the Castle, and the listening friends heard
General Yozarro suggest that it might be worth while to look farther.
They were about to do so when he changed his mind.</p>

<p>"Captain Navarro is not careful with his horses: I must remind
him to have a better care of my property."</p>

<p>With this observation, the General resumed the lead and almost
immediately the party disappeared, vastly to the relief of our
friends. Martella waited only until they were beyond sight, when
he led the way back to the trail.</p>

<p>There was no further call for him to act as advance scout, though
he again placed himself at the head of the little company. He
could readily have captured the horse and offered to do so, but
Miss Starland refused the favor, saying it was a grateful relief
to walk, after having been so long in doors. Accordingly the pony
was left to himself.</p>

<p>The situation had changed. The danger was transferred to the
rear, though it was not likely to threaten for some time to come.
General Yozarro would not dream of the truth until he reached
the Castle. There he would quickly learn that the cunning of the
deserter had drawn the American Se√±orita from his custody and
probably taken her beyond reach. It would require less than an
hour for him to go to <em>Castillo Descanso</em>, and only a short
time to hasten back over the trail to the river.</p>

<p>Would he do so?</p>

<p>This was the question Major Starland asked himself, while tramping
directly behind his sister. Such a thing would be so daring an
outrage that it seemed improbable. What excuse could he offer
when coming into the presence of the two American visitors for
so high-handed an interference with their rights? Hitherto he
had shown a fulsome obsequiousness to both, and acted the part
of a high-toned gentleman. How could he throw off that courtesy
which seemed a part of his nature, and still forbid their going
and coming as they pleased?</p>

<p>Doubtless the Major would have convinced himself that what he
mentally outlined was not to be feared from the Dictator, except
for a most important fact that obtruded itself: the presence of
Martella, the deserter, with the company of fugitives, as they
must now regard themselves. That would justify him in pursuing
the ingrate to the uttermost confines of his dominion, and to
make his shelter by General Bambos a <em>casus belli</em>, especially
if the message left with the engineer of the tugboat had been
delivered. Acting under this pretext, Yozarro would be able to
bring the man's companions within his power, with the opportunity
of carrying out the plans he had formed respecting them. His infatuation
had destroyed his tact, judgment and sense, of which his furnishment
had never been great.</p>

<p>Strange that one of the most likely contingencies of the peculiar
situation did not present itself to any one until it flashed upon
Major Starland, while threading the mountain trail and when near
its termination. General Yozarro's tugboat must have come ashore
directly behind the catboat of his predecessors. He would recognize
the smaller craft, and know that the American had gone to the
Castle to join his sister, no doubt with the intention of bringing
her away. He must have destroyed the usefulness of the catboat
and thus estopped the flight of the fugitives by that means.</p>

<p>While such action on his part would appear to have been certain,
yet it did not accord with his conduct when on the way to <em>Castillo
Descanso</em>. The sight of the pony would have told him the truth,
and he would have been certain to make an investigation on the
spot. But that was not done, nor was there anything in the words
or manner of the Atlamalcans to show that he held a suspicion
of the real situation.</p>

<p>"Martella must have thought of all this, yet he did not show
it by word or act."</p>

<p>Walking briskly, they soon passed up a slight incline, descended
another and arrived within a short distance of the Rio Rubio.
Then, for the first time, the officer recalled that the trail
bifurcated like the river itself. One fork turned to the right,
which led to where the sailboat had been secured. Without pausing,
Martella turned down this, and a few minutes later all stood on
the river's margin.</p>
