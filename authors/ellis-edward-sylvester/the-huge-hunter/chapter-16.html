<p>A <em>FEW </em>minutes more satisfied the trapper that he was
right. Gradually out from the darkness the approaching figure
resolved itself into the steam man.</p>

<p>Johnny Brainerd, after leaving the huge trapper so neatly, continued
wandering aimlessly over the prairie at a moderate speed, so as
to guard against the insidious approach of the Indians, or the
hunter who had threatened to confiscate his property in so unjustifiable
a manner.</p>

<p>Fortunately he did not see Baldy until the latter cautiously
hailed him, otherwise he would have fled before ascertaining his
identity; but the moment he recognized his voice he hastened toward
him, no less surprised than pleased at meeting him so unexpectedly.</p>

<p>'Where are Mickey and Ethan?' he inquired, as he leaped alongside
of him.</p>

<p>'In the cave.'</p>

<p>'How is it you are here?'</p>

<p>The trapper briefly explained that he had crept out to hunt him
up; but as there seemed no imminent danger, he deemed it best
to leave his companions there, as if the Indians once gained possession
of the golden ravine, it would be difficult, if not impossible,
to displace them.</p>

<p>Besides, in order to carry out the scheme which he had formed,
it was necessary that two at least should remain in the cave,
while the others were on the outside.</p>

<p>Under the direction of the trapper, the steam man slowly approached
the ravine, keeping at a respectful distance, but so near that
if any sudden emergency should arise, they would be able to render
assistance to their friends.</p>

<p>The boy gave several whistles so as to inform the Irishman and
Yankee of their whereabouts. A few seconds after, and while the
noise of the instrument was echoing over the prairie, a fainter
whistle reached their ears.</p>

<p>'That's the long-legged Yankee!' instantly remarked the trapper;
'he knows how to make my kind of noise.'</p>

<p>'What does it mean?'</p>

<p>'It means that all is right.'</p>

<p>'Where are the Indians?'</p>

<p>'They ain't fur off. I wish they war further, fur ef it warn't
fur them, we'd had half the yaller metal out of thar by this time.'</p>

<p>Young Brainerd had the reputation of possessing a remarkably
keen vision; but, peer as much as he might, he could detect nothing
unusual. The trapper, however, affirmed that numerous forms could
be seen creeping along-the edge of the prairie, and that these
same forms were more nor less than so many red-skins.</p>

<p>'What are they trying to do?'</p>

<p>'Duono.'</p>

<p>'Hadn't we better withdraw?' inquired Johnny, showing a little
nervousness.</p>

<p>'Not till we know they're after us,' was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>By and by the boy himself was able to get an occasional glimpse
of the shadowy figures moving to and fro.</p>

<p>'I think they are going to surround us,' he added, 'and I feel
as though we ought to get out while we can do so.'</p>

<p>The only reply to this, was by the trapper suddenly bringing
his gun to his shoulder and firing. An agonizing screech, as the
savage threw himself in the air, showed that the shot had not
been in vain.</p>

<p>Rather curiously at the same moment the report of a gun in the
ravine reached their ears, followed by the same death-shriek.</p>

<p>'They ain't sleepin' very powerful down thar,' was the pleased
remark of the trapper, as he leisurely reloaded his piece, while
the boy remained in that nervous state, awaiting the permission
of Baldy to go spinning away over the prairie at a rate that would
very quickly carry him beyond all danger.</p>

<p>But the trapper was in no hurry to give the ardently desired
permission. He seemed to have a lingering affection for the place,
which prevented his 'tearing himself away.'</p>

<p>The boy's timidity was not in the least diminished, when several
return shots were fired, the bullets pinging all around them.</p>

<p>'My gracious, Baldy, let's get out of this!' he instantly pleaded,'
starting the man himself.</p>

<p>'Go about fifty feet,' was the reply, 'but not any further.'</p>

<p>It may be said that the steam man fairly leaped over this space,
and somewhat further, like a frightened kangaroo, and even then
it would not have halted had not the trapper given peremptory
orders for it to do so.</p>

<p>The sky was now clear and the moon, riding high and nearly full,
illumined the prairie for a considerable distance, and there was
no fear but that they could detect the approach of the most treacherous
savage, let him come in whatever disguise he chose.</p>

<p>The night wore gradually away, without any particular demonstration
upon the part of either the Indians or white men, although dropping
shots were occasionally exchanged, without any particular result
on either side.</p>

<p>Now and then a red-skin, creeping cautiously along, made his
appearance on the edge of the ravine; but there was too much light
for him to expose himself to the deadly rifle of the trapper,
who took a kind of savage pleasure in sending his leaden messengers
after the aborigines.</p>

<p>This species of sport was not without its attendant excitement
and danger; for the last creature to take a shot quietly is an
American Indian; and they kept popping away at the steam man and
its train whenever a good opportunity offered.</p>

<p>Owing to the size and peculiar appearance of the steamer, he
was a fair target for his enemies; and, indeed, so uncomfortably
close did some of the bullets come, that the boy almost continually
kept his head lowered, so as to be protected by the sides of the
wagon.</p>

<p>Finally morning came, greatly to the relief of all our friends.
As soon as it was fairly light the Irishman and Yankee were notified
that a move was about to be made, by means of the steam-whistle.
An answering signal coming back to them, the steam man at once
advanced to the very edge of the ravine.</p>

<p>The trapper peering cautiously down the gulch, caught sight of
several red-skins crouching near the cave, and, directing young
Brainerd to discharge his piece at a certain one, the two fired
nearly together. Scarce five seconds had elapsed, when both Ethan
and Mickey did the same. All four, or rather three, as the boy
gave his principal attention to the engine, began loading and
firing as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>The red-skins returned a few scattering shots; but they were
taken at such disadvantage, that they immediately began a precipitate
retreat down the ravine.</p>

<p>Ere they had withdrawn a hundred yards, Ethan and Mickey emerged
from the cave, shouting and excited, firing at every red-skin
they could see, the Irishman occasionally swinging his gun over
his head, and daring the savages to a hand-to-hand encounter.</p>

<p>While the two were thus engaged, the trapper was not idle. The
steam man maintained his place but a short distance behind the
enemies, and his deadly rifle scarcely ever failed of its mark.</p>

<p>The moment an Indian was killed or helplessly wounded, his companions
caught and dragged him away, there being a great fear upon the
part of all that some of their number might fall into the hands
of their enemies, and suffer the ineffaceable disgrace of being
scalped.</p>

<p>The savages were followed a long distance, until their number
had diminished down to a fraction of what it was originally, and
the survivors had all they could do in 'taking care of their disabled
comrades.</p>

<p>Never was victory more complete. The Indians were thoroughly
discomfited, and only too glad to get away after being so severely
punished. During this singular running fight the steam man kept
up a constant shrieking, which doubtless contributed in no slight
degree to the rout of the red-skins. They fired continually at
the fearful-looking monster, and, finding their shots produced
no effect, invested the thing with a portion of the supernatural
power which they had given it at first sight.</p>

<p>When the last glimpse of the retreating Indians was seen, the
trapper turned triumphantly toward the boy.</p>

<p>'Warn't that purty well done, younker?'</p>

<p>'It was indeed.'</p>

<p>'They'll now stay away awhile.'</p>

<p>'We would have failed if we had waited any longer.'</p>

<p>'Why so, boy?'</p>

<p>'Because the last stick is burned, and the steam man couldn't
be made to run a mile further without more fuel.' </p>
