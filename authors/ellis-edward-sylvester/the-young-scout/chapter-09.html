<p>When Mendez, the White Mountain Apache, left the company of Lieutenant
Decker and Maurice Freeman he fully comprehended the perilous
mission he had undertaken.</p>

<p>He had set out to learn and if possible help check the scheme
of Geronimo and his strong party, who were pushing eastward toward
the more fertile and better settled Sutra Valley, with the purpose
of spreading fire, destruction and death wherever the opportunity
offered. What could this single scout do to affect or hinder such
a purpose?</p>

<p>Mendez dare not enter the camp of the hostiles, under the pretense
of being a friend of the raiders. Geronimo and probably all his
warriors knew the one that had done them so much injury, and if
Mendez really wished to cast his lot with them, his allegiance
would not be accepted. His offensive work would not admit of condonation.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker spoke the truth when he said that his faithful
scout would never allow himself to be taken prisoner. He always
kept one chamber of his revolver filled for that emergency, which,
however, would have to be desperate, before he would apply the
weapon to its last use.</p>

<p>The theory upon which the sagacious Mendez acted was that Geronimo’s
plan was to sweep from his path the little company in his immediate
front before carrying out his original scheme. He believed that
these four were the only ones who had divined his purpose. If,
therefore, they were "wiped out," he could complete his terrific
raid before an adequate force could rally in his front or cut
him off. The destruction of the little party, therefore, was the
present design of the invaders.</p>

<p>If the scout was right in his surmise, Lieutenant Decker had
but to despatch Mendez in the opposite direction, the same that
the wounded Cemuri had followed, in order to bring speedy help.
Such would have been the plan of the dusky scout, but he was a
man of silence, and made no attempt to gainsay his commanding
officer, no matter how much his plans might conflict with his
own judgment.</p>

<p>It should be said that Lieutenant Decker had partly followed
the course which Mendez preferred, in that he had sent Cemuri
off, not only to the fort, but with instructions to find if possible
the rest of the cavalrymen or scouts who were abroad, and acquaint
them with the situation. Should he succeed nearly all that was
possible would be accomplished, but the scout feared the severity
of his comrade’s wound would interfere with his usefulness.</p>

<p>However, dismissing all this from his mind, he set to work to
carry out the delicate task before him.</p>

<p>The first step was to locate the invaders, who were not likely
to separate at this stage of the proceedings, and here Mendez
followed a theory of his own.</p>

<p>He believed the Apaches were not far off and that they would
steal forward in the hope of outwitting and overcoming the white
men. Nothing was clearer than that the scout was at great disadvantage
so long as he remained on his horse. He would be not only more
conspicuous than on foot, but would be stopped from using the
remarkable skill with which nature and long training had equipped
him. He, therefore, made a wide circuit on the sandy plain to
the left, until certain he was beyond sight of any foe. Then he
slipped to the ground.</p>

<p>His well-trained animal would not wander from the spot where
he was left, and his owner was certain to find him near it, always
provided no one else interfered with him. He patted his neck and
allowed the intelligent creature to rub his nose against his shoulder.
They understood each other.</p>

<p>Mendez now started to return over his own tracks, bearing slightly
to the eastward, until he approached the stream. Then he paused.</p>

<p>The moon had not yet risen, but he knew it would soon appear,
when still greater caution would be necessary in his movements.
Stooping low he applied his ear to the earth, but heard nothing.</p>

<p>Bending low and stepping slowly—an easy thing to do on the sand—he
pressed on until he reached the edge of the narrow, smoothly flowing
stream. There he stood motionless for several minutes, debating
whether to cross the creek or to push his reconnaissance where
he was.</p>

<p>Standing thus, he heard a noise which, though faint, was easily
identified. It was the whinny of a horse and it came from some
point on the opposite bank. Geronimo and his band were there and
he determined to cross to them.</p>

<p>The peculiar noise was not directly opposite, but somewhat to
the right, that is, nearer to where he had left his friends. Nevertheless,
the scout moved further down the stream before stepping into the
water. He suspected it was sufficiently shallow to be forded,
but was prepared to swim if need be. He held his Winchester above
his head, stepping carefully into the current, which near the
middle reached above his waist. From that point the depth decreased
and he finally emerged, having waded all the way. He was now on
the same side with the hostiles.</p>

<p>If detected, his situation was tenfold more dangerous than before,
and more than likely that reserve shot in his revolver would be
called upon. The hostiles could easily run him down with their
horses and a plunge into the stream would not save him.</p>

<p>In order to hide his movements he sank upon his hands and knees
and began creeping toward the spot whence came the horse’s neigh.
A few rods were passed in this manner, when he caught sight of
that for which he was searching. A group of horsemen were dimly
outlined against the sky.</p>

<p>So far as he could determine, there were at least a dozen. No
doubt the entire band had come together and were holding a consultation
as to what course they should follow.</p>

<p>It would have been a most desirable thing could he have approached
near enough to overhear their conversation, but that was impossible.
He was certain to be discovered by the animals, if not the riders,
and detection meant death.</p>

<p>He heard the murmur of their voices, but no syllable that could
be comprehended reached the crouching figure in the sand.</p>

<p>Suppose they should turn their horses and ride toward him! He
could only make a break for the stream and strive desperately
for the other shore—a feat which it may be said was impossible
of accomplishment, but this was only one of the many risks which
a scout has to face when operating in Arizona.</p>

<p>From among the group three warriors emerged on foot. They did
not advance toward the solitary figure in the sand, but took a
diagonal course to the stream, whose bank they followed until
hidden in the gloom. Mendez did not leave or move, but speculated
as to the meaning of this singular action.</p>

<p>While still wondering, he heard the signal which Lieutenant Decker
mistook for that of a friend.</p>

<p>Mendez was startled, for he recognized its perfect imitation
of the call which he had used many times when scouting with the
officer. He wondered by what means their enemies had obtained
it, and concluded that it was one of those accidental occurrences,
such as are seen when two ranchmen, widely separated, fix upon
the same brand for their cattle.</p>

<p>The fact caused uneasiness, for the scout feared that it would
mislead his friend, but nothing could be done to avert so disastrous
a blunder. The officer must be left to his own shrewdness, which,
as the reader has learned, proved sufficient for his protection.</p>

<p>Then came the rifle-shot and death cry of one of the hostiles.
There could be no misinterpretation of that meaning, and the dusky
scout smiled grimly as he reflected that another of the many schemes
of the raiders had gone amiss.</p>

<p>If any doubt remained on that point, it was removed a few minutes
later, when two warriors were descried returning, whereas three
had left the group a short time before. The one stricken down
had been allowed to lie where he fell.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Mendez became aware of a discomforting
fact: the moon was rising and would soon shed a bright illumination
over stream and plain. If he remained where he was, discovery
was inevitable. He therefore began a cautious withdrawal from
the perilous neighborhood.</p>

<p>He adopted a curious artifice. Instead of facing about and creeping
away, he imitated the action of Geronimo’s horse some hours before,
when confronting Lieutenant Decker. He backed toward the stream,
a course which enabled him to keep an eye on his enemies in front.</p>

<p>He had passed half the distance, and was cautiously retrograding,
when he experienced a shock. One of the mounted Apaches left the
group and rode toward him!</p>

<p>Mendez ceased his motion on the instant and grasped his Winchester
so as to aim and fire in a twinkling. His purpose was, if discovered,
to shoot the buck from his pony, dash forward and capture his
horse, or if that was not feasible, make a break to the stream
and run for his own animal.</p>

<p>One of these desperate attempts assuredly would have followed
had the horseman kept the course upon which he started, but he
had gone only a little way when he made an abrupt change and approached
the bank at a point almost as far removed from the scout as was
the band of raiders.</p>

<p>This was a vast relief, and all fear would have departed but
for the moon which was rapidly climbing the sky and shedding an
effulgence that made it like daylight itself. Had the scout risen
to his feet he would have been detected at once. He must continue
prone and reach the stream in that posture or not reach it at
all.</p>

<p>But it looked as if that solitary horseman was doomed to be his
death after all; for, instead of crossing the creek or remaining
where he was, he turned once more, and, as before, headed toward
Mendez, who, believing the critical moment had come, braced himself
for the struggle.</p>
