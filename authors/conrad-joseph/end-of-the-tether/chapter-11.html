<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p> Sterne crossed the deck upon the track of the chief engineer.
Jack, the second, retreating backwards down the engine-room ladder,
and still wiping his hands, treated him to an incomprehensible
grin of white teeth out of his grimy hard face; Massy was nowhere
to be seen. He must have gone straight into his berth. Sterne
scratched at the door softly, then, putting his lips to the rose
of the ventilator, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I must speak to you, Mr. Massy. Just give me a minute or two."</p>

<p>"I am busy. Go away from my door."</p>

<p>"But pray, Mr. Massy . . ."</p>

<p>"You go away. D’you hear? Take yourself off altogether&mdash;to the
other end of the ship&mdash;quite away . . ." The voice inside dropped
low. "To the devil."</p>

<p>Sterne paused: then very quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>"It’s rather pressing. When do you think you will be at liberty,
sir?"</p>

<p>The answer to this was an exasperated "Never"; and at once Sterne,
with a very firm expression of face, turned the handle.</p>

<p>Mr. Massy’s stateroom&mdash;a narrow, one-berth cabin&mdash;smelt strongly
of soap, and presented to view a swept, dusted, unadorned neatness,
not so much bare as barren, not so much severe as starved and
lacking in humanity, like the ward of a public hospital, or rather
(owing to the small size) like the clean retreat of a desperately
poor but exemplary person. Not a single photograph frame ornamented
the bulkheads; not a single article of clothing, not as much as
a spare cap, hung from the brass hooks. All the inside was painted
in one plain tint of pale blue; two big sea-chests in sailcloth
covers and with iron padlocks fitted exactly in the space under
the bunk. One glance was enough to embrace all the strip of scrubbed
planks within the four unconcealed corners. The absence of the
usual settee was striking; the teak-wood top of the washing-stand
seemed hermetically closed, and so was the lid of the writing-desk,
which protruded from the partition at the foot of the bed-place,
containing a mattress as thin as a pancake under a threadbare
blanket with a faded red stripe, and a folded mosquito-net against
the nights spent in harbor. There was not a scrap of paper anywhere
in sight, no boots on the floor, no litter of any sort, not a
speck of dust anywhere; no traces of pipe-ash even, which, in
a heavy smoker, was morally revolting, like a manifestation of
extreme hypocrisy; and the bottom of the old wooden arm-chair
(the only seat there), polished with much use, shone as if its
shabbiness had been waxed. The screen of leaves on the bank, passing
as if unrolled endlessly in the round opening of the port, sent
a wavering network of light and shade into the place.</p>

<p>Sterne, holding the door open with one hand, had thrust in his
head and shoulders. At this amazing intrusion Massy, who was doing
absolutely nothing, jumped up speechless.</p>

<p>"Don’t call names," murmured Sterne hurriedly. "I won’t be called
names. I think of nothing but your good, Mr. Massy."</p>

<p>A pause as of extreme astonishment followed. They both seemed
to have lost their tongues. Then the mate went on with a discreet
glibness.</p>

<p>"You simply couldn’t conceive what’s going on on board your ship.
It wouldn’t enter your head for a moment. You are too good&mdash;too&mdash;too
upright, Mr. Massy, to suspect anybody of such a . . . It’s enough
to make your hair stand on end."</p>

<p>He watched for the effect: Massy seemed dazed, uncomprehending.
He only passed the palm of his hand on the coal-black wisps plastered
across the top of his head. In a tone suddenly changed to confidential
audacity Sterne hastened on.</p>

<p>"Remember that there’s only six weeks left to run . . ." The
other was looking at him stonily . . . "so anyhow you shall require
a captain for the ship before long."</p>

<p>Then only, as if that suggestion had scarified his flesh in the
manner of red-hot iron, Massy gave a start and seemed ready to
shriek. He contained himself by a great effort.</p>

<p>"Require a captain," he repeated with scathing slowness. "Who
requires a captain? You dare to tell me that I need any of you
humbugging sailors to run my ship. You and your likes have been
fattening on me for years. It would have hurt me less to throw
my money overboard. Pam&mdash;pe&mdash;red us&mdash;e&mdash;less f-f-f-frauds. The
old ship knows as much as the best of you." He snapped his teeth
audibly and growled through them, "The silly law requires a captain."</p>

<p>Sterne had taken heart of grace meantime.</p>

<p>"And the silly insurance people too, as well," he said lightly.
"But never mind that. What I want to ask is: Why shouldn’t <em>I</em>
do, sir? I don’t say but you could take a steamer about the world
as well as any of us sailors. I don’t pretend to tell <em>you</em>
that it is a very great trick . . ." He emitted a short, hollow
guffaw, familiarly . . . "I didn’t make the law&mdash;but there it
is; and I am an active young fellow! I quite hold with your ideas;
I know your ways by this time, Mr. Massy. I wouldn’t try to give
myself airs like that&mdash;that&mdash;er lazy specimen of an old man up
there."</p>

<p>He put a marked emphasis on the last sentence, to lead Massy
away from the track in case . . . but he did not doubt of now
holding his success. The chief engineer seemed nonplused, like
a slow man invited to catch hold of a whirligig of some sort.</p>

<p>"What you want, sir, is a chap with no nonsense about him, who
would be content to be your sailing-master. Quite right, too.
Well, I am fit for the work as much as that Serang. Because that’s
what it amounts to. Do you know, sir, that a dam’ Malay like a
monkey is in charge of your ship&mdash;and no one else. Just listen
to his feet pit-patting above us on the bridge&mdash;real officer in
charge. He’s taking her up the river while the great man is wallowing
in the chair&mdash;perhaps asleep; and if he is, that would not make
it much worse either&mdash;take my word for it."</p>

<p>He tried to thrust himself farther in. Massy, with lowered forehead,
one hand grasping the back of the arm-chair, did not budge.</p>

<p>"You think, sir, that the man has got you tight in his agreement
. . ."  Massy raised a heavy snarling face at this . . . "Well,
sir, one can’t help hearing of it on board. It’s no secret. And
it has been the talk on shore for years; fellows have been making
bets about it. No, sir! It’s <em>you</em> who have got him at
your mercy. You will say that you can’t dismiss him for indolence.
Difficult to prove in court, and so on. Why, yes. But if you say
the word, sir, I can tell you something about his indolence that
will give you the clear right to fire him out on the spot and
put me in charge for the rest of this very trip&mdash;yes, sir, before
we leave Batu Beru&mdash;and make him pay a dollar a day for his keep
till we get back, if you like. Now, what do you think of that?
Come, sir. Say the word. It’s really well worth your while, and
I am quite ready to take your bare word. A definite statement
from you would be as good as a bond."</p>

<p>His eyes began to shine. He insisted. A simple statement,&mdash;and
he thought to himself that he would manage somehow to stick in
his berth as long as it suited him. He would make himself indispensable;
the ship had a bad name in her port; it would be easy to scare
the fellows off. Massy would have to keep him.</p>

<p>"A definite statement from me would be enough," Massy repeated
slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. It would." Sterne stuck out his chin cheerily and
blinked at close quarters with that unconscious impudence which
had the power to enrage Massy beyond anything.</p>

<p>The engineer spoke very distinctly.</p>

<p>"Listen well to me, then, Mr. Sterne: I wouldn’t&mdash;d’ye hear?
&mdash;I wouldn’t promise you the value of two pence for anything
<em>you</em> can tell me."</p>

<p>He struck Sterne’s arm away with a smart blow, and catching hold
of the handle pulled the door to. The terrific slam darkened the
cabin instantaneously to his eye as if after the flash of an explosion.
At once he dropped into the chair. "Oh, no! You don’t!" he whispered
faintly.</p>

<p>The ship had in that place to shave the bank so close that the
gigantic wall of leaves came gliding like a shutter against the
port; the darkness of the primeval forest seemed to flow into
that bare cabin with the odor of rotting leaves, of sodden soil&mdash;the
strong muddy smell of the living earth steaming uncovered after
the passing of a deluge. The bushes swished loudly alongside;
above there was a series of crackling sounds, with a sharp rain
of small broken branches falling on the bridge; a creeper with
a great rustle snapped on the head of a boat davit, and a long,
luxuriant green twig actually whipped in and out of the open port,
leaving behind a few torn leaves that remained suddenly at rest
on Mr. Massy’s blanket. Then, the ship sheering out in the stream,
the light began to return but did not augment beyond a subdued
clearness: for the sun was very low already, and the river, wending
its sinuous course through a multitude of secular trees as if
at the bottom of a precipitous gorge, had been already invaded
by a deepening gloom&mdash;the swift precursor of the night.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you don’t!" murmured the engineer again. His lips trembled
almost imperceptibly; his hands too, a little: and to calm himself
he opened the writing-desk, spread out a sheet of thin grayish
paper covered with a mass of printed figures and began to scan
them attentively for the twentieth time this trip at least.</p>

<p>With his elbows propped, his head between his hands, he seemed
to lose himself in the study of an abstruse problem in mathematics.
It was the list of the winning numbers from the last drawing of
the great lottery which had been the one inspiring fact of so
many years of his existence. The conception of a life deprived
of that periodical sheet of paper had slipped away from him entirely,
as another man, according to his nature, would not have been able
to conceive a world without fresh air, without activity, or without
affection. A great pile of flimsy sheets had been growing for
years in his desk, while the Sofala, driven by the faithful Jack,
wore out her boilers in tramping up and down the Straits, from
cape to cape, from river to river, from bay to bay; accumulating
by that hard labor of an overworked, starved ship the blackened
mass of these documents. Massy kept them under lock and key like
a treasure. There was in them, as in the experience of life, the
fascination of hope, the excitement of a half-penetrated mystery,
the longing of a half-satisfied desire.</p>

<p>For days together, on a trip, he would shut himself up in his
berth with them: the thump of the toiling engines pulsated in
his ear; and he would weary his brain poring over the rows of
disconnected figures, bewildering by their senseless sequence,
resembling the hazards of destiny itself. He nourished a conviction
that there must be some logic lurking somewhere in the results
of chance. He thought he had seen its very form. His head swam;
his limbs ached; he puffed at his pipe mechanically; a contemplative
stupor would soothe the fretfulness of his temper, like the passive
bodily quietude procured by a drug, while the intellect remains
tensely on the stretch. Nine, nine, aught, four, two. He made
a note. The next winning number of the great prize was forty-seven
thousand and five. These numbers of course would have to be avoided
in the future when writing to Manilla for the tickets. He mumbled,
pencil in hand . . . "and five. Hm . . . hm." He wetted his finger:
the papers rustled. Ha! But what’s this? Three years ago, in the
September drawing, it was number nine, aught, four, two that took
the first prize. Most remarkable. There was a hint there of a
definite rule! He was afraid of missing some recondite principle
in the overwhelming wealth of his material. What could it be?
and for half an hour he would remain dead still, bent low over
the desk, without twitching a muscle. At his back the whole berth
would be thick with a heavy body of smoke, as if a bomb had burst
in there, unnoticed, unheard.</p>

<p>At last he would lock up the desk with the decision of unshaken
confidence, jump and go out. He would walk swiftly back and forth
on that part of the foredeck which was kept clear of the lumber
and of the bodies of the native passengers. They were a great
nuisance, but they were also a source of profit that could not
be disdained. He needed every penny of profit the Sofala could
make. Little enough it was, in all conscience! The incertitude
of chance gave him no concern, since he had somehow arrived at
the conviction that, in the course of years, every number was
bound to have his winning turn. It was simply a matter of time
and of taking as many tickets as he could afford for every drawing.
He generally took rather more; all the earnings of the ship went
that way, and also the wages he allowed himself as chief engineer.
It was the wages he paid to others that he begrudged with a reasoned
and at the same time a passionate regret. He scowled at the lascars
with their deck brooms, at the quartermasters rubbing the brass
rails with greasy rags; he was eager to shake his fist and roar
abuse in bad Malay at the poor carpenter&mdash;a timid, sickly, opium-fuddled
Chinaman, in loose blue drawers for all costume, who invariably
dropped his tools and fled below, with streaming tail and shaking
all over, before the fury of that "devil." But it was when he
raised up his eyes to the bridge where one of these sailor frauds
was always planted by law in charge of his ship that he felt almost
dizzy with rage. He abominated them all; it was an old feud, from
the time he first went to sea, an unlicked cub with a great opinion
of himself, in the engine-room. The slights that had been put
upon him. The persecutions he had suffered at the hands of skippers&mdash;of
absolute nobodies in a steamship after all. And now that he had
risen to be a shipowner they were still a plague to him: he had
absolutely to pay away precious money to the conceited useless
loafers: &mdash;As if a fully qualified engineer&mdash;who was the
owner as well&mdash;were not fit to be trusted with the whole charge
of a ship. Well! he made it pretty warm for them; but it was a
poor consolation. He had come in time to hate the ship too for
the repairs she required, for the coal-bills he had to pay, for
the poor beggarly freights she earned. He would clench his hand
as he walked and hit the rail a sudden blow, viciously, as though
she could be made to feel pain. And yet he could not do without
er; he needed her; he must hang on to her tooth and nail to keep
his head above water till the expected flood of fortune came sweeping
up and landed him safely on the high shore of his ambition.</p>

<p>It was now to do nothing, nothing whatever, and have plenty of
money to do it on. He had tasted of power, the highest form of
it his limited experience was aware of&mdash;the power of shipowning.
What a deception! Vanity of vanities! He wondered at his folly.
He had thrown away the substance for the shadow. Of the gratification
of wealth he did not know enough to excite his imagination with
any visions of luxury. How could he&mdash;the child of a drunken boiler-maker&mdash;going
straight from the workshop into the engine-room of a north-country
collier! But the notion of the absolute idleness of wealth he
could very well conceive. He reveled in it, to forget his present
troubles; he imagined himself walking about the streets of Hull
(he knew their gutters well as a boy) with his pockets full of
sovereigns. He would buy himself a house; his married sisters,
their husbands, his old workshop chums, would render him infinite
homage. There would be nothing to think of. His word would be
law. He had been out of work for a long time before he won his
prize, and he remembered how Carlo Mariani (commonly known as
Paunchy Charley), the Maltese hotel-keeper at the slummy end of
Denham Street, had cringed joyfully before him in the evening,
when the news had come. Poor Charley, though he made his living
by ministering to various abject vices, gave credit for their
food to many a piece of white wreckage. He was naively overjoyed
at the idea of his old bills being paid, and he reckoned confidently
on a spell of festivities in the cavernous grog-shop downstairs.
Massy remembered the curious, respectful looks of the "trashy"
white men in the place. His heart had swelled within him. Massy
had left Charley’s infamous den directly he had realized the possibilities
open to him, and with his nose in the air. Afterwards the memory
of these adulations was a great sadness.</p>

<p>This was the true power of money,&mdash;and no trouble with it, nor
any thinking required either. He thought with difficulty and felt
vividly; to his blunt brain the problems offered by any ordered
scheme of life seemed in their cruel toughness to have been put
in his way by the obvious malevolence of men. As a shipowner everyone
had conspired to make him a nobody. How could he have been such
a fool as to purchase that accursed ship. He had been abominably
swindled; there was no end to this swindling; and as the difficulties
of his improvident ambition gathered thicker round him, he really
came to hate everybody he had ever come in contact with. A temper
naturally irritable and an amazing sensitiveness to the claims
of his own personality had ended by making of life for him a sort
of inferno&mdash;a place where his lost soul had been given up to the
torment of savage brooding.</p>

<p>But he had never hated anyone so much as that old man who had
turned up one evening to save him from an utter disaster,&mdash;from
the conspiracy of the wretched sailors. He seemed to have fallen
on board from the sky. His footsteps echoed on the empty steamer,
and the strange deep-toned voice on deck repeating interrogatively
the words, "Mr. Massy, Mr. Massy there?" had been startling like
a wonder. And coming up from the depths of the cold engine-room,
where he had been pottering dismally with a candle amongst the
enormous shadows, thrown on all sides by the skeleton limbs of
machinery, Massy had been struck dumb by astonishment in the presence
of that imposing old man with a beard like a silver plate, towering
in the dusk rendered lurid by the expiring flames of sunset.</p>

<p>"Want to see me on business? What business? I am doing no business.
Can’t you see that this ship is laid up?" Massy had turned at
bay before the pursuing irony of his disaster. Afterwards he could
not believe his ears. What was that old fellow getting at? Things
don’t happen that way. It was a dream. He would presently wake
up and find the man vanished like a shape of mist. The gravity,
the dignity, the firm and courteous tone of that athletic old
stranger impressed Massy. He was almost afraid. But it was no
dream. Five hundred pounds are no dream. At once he became suspicious.
What did it mean? Of course it was an offer to catch hold of for
dear life. But what could there be behind?</p>

<p>Before they had parted, after appointing a meeting in a solicitor’s
office early on the morrow, Massy was asking himself, What is
his motive? He spent the night in hammering out the clauses of
the agreement&mdash;a unique instrument of its sort whose tenor got
bruited abroad somehow and became the talk and wonder of the port.</p>

<p>Massy’s object had been to secure for himself as many ways as
possible of getting rid of his partner without being called upon
at once to pay back his share. Captain Whalley’s efforts were
directed to making the money secure. Was it not Ivy’s money&mdash;a
part of her fortune whose only other asset was the time-defying
body of her old father? Sure of his forbearance in the strength
of his love for her, he accepted, with stately serenity, Massy’s
stupidly cunning paragraphs against his incompetence, his dishonesty,
his drunkenness, for the sake of other stringent stipulations.
At the end of three years he was at liberty to withdraw from the
partnership, taking his money with him. Provision was made for
forming a fund to pay him off. But if he left the Sofala before
the term, from whatever cause (barring death), Massy was to have
a whole year for paying. "Illness?" the lawyer had suggested:
a young man fresh from Europe and not overburdened with business,
who was rather amused. Massy began to whine unctuously, "How could
he be expected? . . ."</p>

<p>"Let that go," Captain Whalley had said with a superb confidence
in his body. "Acts of God," he added. In the midst of life we
are in death, but he trusted his Maker with a still greater fearlessness&mdash;his
Maker who knew his thoughts, his human affections, and his motives.
His Creator knew what use he was making of his health&mdash;how much
he wanted it . . . "I trust my first illness will be my last.
I’ve never been ill that I can remember," he had remarked. "Let
it go."</p>

<p>But at this early stage he had already awakened Massy’s hostility
by refusing to make it six hundred instead of five. "I cannot
do that," was all he had said, simply, but with so much decision
that Massy desisted at once from pressing the point, but had thought
to himself, "Can’t! Old curmudgeon. <em>Won’t</em> He must have
lots of money, but he would like to get hold of a soft berth and
the sixth part of my profits for nothing if he only could."</p>

<p>And during these years Massy’s dislike grew under the restraint
of something resembling fear. The simplicity of that man appeared
dangerous. Of late he had changed, however, had appeared less
formidable and with a lessened vigor of life, as though he had
received a secret wound. But still he remained incomprehensible
in his simplicity, fearlessness, and rectitude. And when Massy
learned that he meant to leave him at the end of the time, to
leave him confronted with the problem of boilers, his dislike
blazed up secretly into hate.</p>

<p>It had made him so clear-eyed that for a long time now Mr. Sterne
could have told him nothing he did not know. He had much ado in
trying to terrorize that mean sneak into silence; he wanted to
deal alone with the situation; and&mdash;incredible as it might have
appeared to Mr. Sterne&mdash;he had not yet given up the desire and
the hope of inducing that hated old man to stay. Why! there was
nothing else to do, unless he were to abandon his chances of fortune.
But now, suddenly, since the crossing of the bar at Batu Beru
things seemed to be coming rapidly to a point. It disquieted him
so much that the study of the winning numbers failed to soothe
his agitation: and the twilight in the cabin deepened, very somber.</p>

<p>He put the list away, muttering once more, "Oh, no, my boy, you
don’t. Not if I know it." He did not mean the blinking, eavesdropping
humbug to force his action. He took his head again into his hands;
his immobility confined in the darkness of this shut-up little
place seemed to make him a thing apart infinitely removed from
the stir and the sounds of the deck.</p>

<p>He heard them: the passengers were beginning to jabber excitedly;
somebody dragged a heavy box past his door. He heard Captain Whalley’s
voice above&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stations, Mr. Sterne." And the answer from somewhere on deck
forward&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir."</p>

<p>"We shall moor head up stream this time; the ebb has made."</p>

<p>"Head up stream, sir."</p>

<p>"You will see to it, Mr. Sterne."</p>

<p>The answer was covered by the autocratic clang on the engine-room
gong. The propeller went on beating slowly: one, two, three; one,
two, three&mdash;with pauses as if hesitating on the turn. The gong
clanged time after time, and the water churned this way and that
by the blades was making a great noisy commotion alongside. Mr.
Massy did not move. A shore-light on the other bank, a quarter
of a mile across the river, drifted, no bigger than a tiny star,
passing slowly athwart the circle of the port. Voices from Mr.
Van Wyk’s jetty answered the hails from the ship; ropes were thrown
and missed and thrown again; the swaying flame of a torch carried
in a large sampan coming to fetch away in state the Rajah from
down the coast cast a sudden ruddy glare into his cabin, over
his very person. Mr. Massy did not move. After a few last ponderous
turns the engines stopped, and the prolonged clanging of the gong
signified that the captain had done with them. A great number
of boats and canoes of all sizes boarded the off-side of the Sofala.
Then after a time the tumult of splashing, of cries, of shuffling
feet, of packages dropped with a thump, the noise of the native
passengers going away, subsided slowly. On the shore, a voice,
cultivated, slightly authoritative, spoke very close alongside&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brought any mail for me this time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Van Wyk." This was from Sterne, answering over the
rail in a tone of respectful cordiality. "Shall I bring it up
to you?"</p>

<p>But the voice asked again&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where’s the captain?"</p>

<p>"Still on the bridge, I believe. He hasn’t left his chair. Shall
I . . ."</p>

<p>The voice interrupted negligently.</p>

<p>"I will come on board."</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Wyk," Sterne suddenly broke out with an eager effort,
"will you do me the favor . . ."</p>

<p>The mate walked away quickly towards the gangway. A silence fell.
Mr. Massy in the dark did not move.</p>

<p>He did not move even when he heard slow shuffling footsteps pass
his cabin lazily. He contented himself to bellow out through the
closed door&mdash;</p>

<p>"You &mdash;Jack!"</p>

<p>The footsteps came back without haste; the door handle rattled,
and the second engineer appeared in the opening, shadowy in the
sheen of the skylight at his back, with his face apparently as
black as the rest of his figure.</p>

<p>"We have been very long coming up this time," Mr. Massy growled,
without changing his attitude.</p>

<p>"What do you expect with half the boiler tubes plugged up for
leaks."  The second defended himself loquaciously.</p>

<p>"None of your lip," said Massy.</p>

<p>"None of your rotten boilers &mdash;I say," retorted his faithful
subordinate without animation, huskily. "Go down there and carry
a head of steam on them yourself&mdash;if you dare. I don’t."</p>

<p>"You aren’t worth your salt then," Massy said. The other made
a faint noise which resembled a laugh but might have been a snarl.</p>

<p>"Better go slow than stop the ship altogether," he admonished
his admired superior. Mr. Massy moved at last. He turned in his
chair, and grinding his teeth&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dam’ you and the ship! I wish she were at the bottom of the
sea. Then you would have to starve."</p>

<p>The trusty second engineer closed the door gently.</p>

<p>Massy listened. Instead of passing on to the bathroom where he
should have gone to clean himself, the second entered his cabin,
which was next door. Mr. Massy jumped up and waited. Suddenly
he heard the lock snap in there. He rushed out and gave a violent
kick to the door.</p>

<p>"I believe you are locking yourself up to get drunk," he shouted.</p>

<p>A muffled answer came after a while.</p>

<p>"My own time."</p>

<p>"If you take to boozing on the trip I’ll fire you out," Massy
cried.</p>

<p>An obstinate silence followed that threat. Massy moved away perplexed.
On the bank two figures appeared, approaching the gangway. He
heard a voice tinged with contempt&mdash;</p>

<p>"I would rather doubt your word. But I shall certainly speak
to him of this."</p>

<p>The other voice, Sterne’s, said with a sort of regretful formality&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thanks. That’s all I want. I must do my duty."</p>

<p>Mr. Massy was surprised. A short, dapper figure leaped lightly
on the deck and nearly bounded into him where he stood beyond
the circle of light from the gangway lamp. When it had passed
towards the bridge, after exchanging a hurried "Good evening,"
Massy said surlily to Sterne who followed with slow steps&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is it you’re making up to Mr. Van Wyk for, now?"</p>

<p>"Far from it, Mr. Massy. I am not good enough for Mr. Van Wyk.
Neither are you, sir, in his opinion, I am afraid. Captain Whalley
is, it seems. He’s gone to ask him to dine up at the house this
evening."</p>

<p>Then he murmured to himself darkly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope he will like it."</p>
