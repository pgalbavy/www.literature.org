<P>
 The next day Turlington drove to the suburbs, on the chance of
finding the Graybrookes at home again. Sir Joseph disliked
London, and could not prevail on himself to live any nearer to
the metropolis than Muswell Hill. When Natalie wanted a change,
and languished for balls, theaters, flower-shows, and the like,
she had a room especially reserved for her in the house of Sir
Joseph's married sister, Mrs. Sancroft, living in that central
deep of the fashionable whirlpool known among mortals as Berkeley
Square.
<P>
On his way through the streets, Turlington encountered a plain
proof that the Graybrookes must have returned. He was passed by
Launce, driving, in company with a gentleman, in a cab. The
gentleman was Launce's brother, and the two were on their way to
the Commissioners of Police to make the necessary arrangements
for instituting an inquiry into Turlington's early life.
<P>
Arrived at the gate of the villa, the information received only
partially fulfilled the visitor's expectations. The family had
returned on the previous evening. Sir Joseph and his sister were
at home, but Natalie was away again already. She had driven into
town to lunch with her aunt. Turlington went into the house.
<P>
"Have you lost any money?" Those were the first words uttered by
Sir Joseph when he and Richard met again, after the parting on
board the yacht.
<P>
"Not a farthing. I might have lost seriously, if I had not got
back in time to set things straight. Stupidity on the part of my
people left in charge--nothing more. It's all right now."
<P>
Sir Joseph lifted his eyes, with heartfelt devotion, to the
ceiling. "Thank God, Richard!" he said, in tones of the deepest
feeling. He rang the bell. "Tell Miss Graybrooke Mr. Turlington
is here." He turned again to Richard. "Lavinia is like me--
Lavinia has been so anxious about you. We have both of us passed
a sleepless night." Miss Lavinia came in. Sir Joseph hurried to
meet her, and took her affectionately by both hands. "My dear!
the best of all good news, Richard has not lost a farthing." Miss
Lavinia lifted _her_ eyes to the ceiling with heartfelt devotion,
and said, "Thank God, Richard!"--like the echo of her brother's
voice; a little late, perhaps, for its reputation as an echo, but
accurate to half a note in its perfect repetition of sound.
<P>
Turlington asked the question which it had been his one object to
put in paying his visit to Muswell Hill.
<P>
"Have you spoken to Natalie?"
<P>
"This morning," replied Sir Joseph. "An opportunity offered
itself after breakfast. I took advantage of it, Richard--you
shall hear how."
<P>
He settled himself in his chair for one of his interminable
stories; he began his opening sentence--and stopped, struck dumb
at the first word. There was an unexpected obstacle in the way--
his sister was not attending to him; his sister had silenced him
at starting. The story touching, this time, on the question of
marriage, Miss Lavinia had her woman's interest in seeing full
justice done to the subject. She seized on her brother's
narrative as on property in her own right.
<P>
"Joseph should have told you," she began, addressing herself to
Turlington, "that our dear girl was unusually depressed in
spirits this morning. Quite in the right frame of mind for a
little serious talk about her future life. She ate nothing at
breakfast, poor child, but a morsel of dry toast."
<P>
"And marmalade," said Sir Joseph, striking in at the first
opportunity. The story, on this occasion, being Miss Lavinia's
story, the polite contradictions necessary to its successful
progress were naturally transferred from the sister to the
brother, and became contradictions on Sir Joseph's side.
<P>
"No," said Miss Lavinia, gently, "if you _will_ have it, Joseph--
jam."
<P>
"I beg your pardon," persisted Sir Joseph; "marmalade."
<P>
"What _does_ it matter, brother?"
<P>
"Sister! the late great and good Doctor Johnson said accuracy
ought always to be studied even in the most trifling things."
<P>
"You _will_ have your way, Joseph"--(this was the formula--
answering to Sir Joseph's "Let us waive the point"--which Miss
Lavinia used, as a means of conciliating her brother, and getting
a fresh start for her story). "Well, we took dear Natalie out
between us, after breakfast, for a little walk in the grounds. My
brother opened the subject with infinite delicacy and tact.
'Circumstances,' he said, 'into which it was not then necessary
to enter, made it very desirable, young as she was, to begin to
think of her establishment in life.' And then he referred,
Richard (so nicely), to your faithful and devoted attachment--"
<P>
"Excuse me, Lavinia. I began with Richard's attachment, and then
I got on to her establishment in life."
<P>
"Excuse _me_, Joseph. You managed it much more delicately than
you suppose. You didn't drag Richard in by the head and shoulders
in that way."
<P>
"Lavinia! I began with Richard."
<P>
"Joseph! your memory deceives you."
<P>
Turlington's impatience broke through all restraint.
<P>
"How did it end?" he asked. "Did you propose to her that we
should be married in the first week of the New Year?"
<P>
"Yes!" said Miss Lavinia.
<P>
"No!" said Sir Joseph.
<P>
The sister looked at the brother with an expression of
affectionate surprise. The brother looked at the sister with a
fund of amiable contradiction, expressed in a low bow.
<P>
"Do you really mean to deny, Joseph, that you told Natalie we had
decided on the first week in the New Year?"
<P>
"I deny the New Year, Lavinia. I said early in January."
<P>
"You _will_ have your way, Joseph! We were walking in the
shrubbery at the time. I had our dear girl's arm in mine, and I
felt it tremble. She suddenly stopped. 'Oh,' she said, 'not so
soon!' I said, 'My dear, consider Richard!' She turned to her
father. She said, 'Don't, pray don't press it so soon, papa! I
respect Richard; I like Richard as your true and faithful friend;
but I don't love him as I ought to love him if I am to be his
wife.' Imagine her talking in that way! What could she possibly
know about it? Of course we both laughed--"
<P>
"_you_ laughed, Lavinia."
<P>
"_you_ laughed, Joseph."
<P>
"Get on, for God's sake!" cried Turlington, striking his hand
passionately on the table by which he was sitting. "Don't madden
me by contradicting each other! Did she give way or not?"
<P>
Miss Lavinia turned to her brother. "Contradicting each other,
Joseph!" she exclaimed, lifting her hands in blank amazement.
<P>
"Contradicting each other!" repeated Sir Joseph, equally
astonished on his side. "My dear Richard, what can you be
thinking of? I contradict my sister! We never disagreed in our
lives."
<P>
"I contradict my brother! We have never had a cross word between
us from the time when we were children."
<P>
Turlington internally cursed his own irritable temper.
<P>
"I beg your pardon--both of you," he said. "I didn't know what I
was saying. Make some allowance for me. All my hopes in life are
centered in Natalie; and you have just told me (in her own words,
Miss Lavinia) that she doesn't love. You don't mean any harm, I
dare say; but you cut me to the heart."
<P>
This confession, and the look that accompanied it, touched the
ready sympathies of the two old people in the right place. The
remainder of the story dropped between them by common consent.
They vied with each other in saying the comforting words which
would allay their dear Richard's anxiety. How little he knew of
young girls. How could he be so foolish, poor fellow! as to
attach any serious importance to what Natalie had said? As if a
young creature in her teens knew the state of her own heart!
Protestations and entreaties were matters of course, in such
cases. Tears even might be confidently expected from a
right-minded girl. It had all ended exactly as Richard would have
wished it to end. Sir Joseph had said, "My child! this is a
matter of experience; love will come when you are married." And
Miss Lavinia had added, "Dear Natalie, if you remembered your
poor mother as I remember her, you would know that your father's
experience is to be relied on." In that way they had put it to
her; and she had hung her head and had given--all that maiden
modesty could be expected to give--a silent consent. "The
wedding-day was fixed for the first week in the New Year." ("No,
Joseph; not January--the New Year.") "And God bless you, Richard!
and may your married life be a long and happy one."
<P>
So the average ignorance of human nature, and the average belief
in conventional sentiment, complacently contemplated the
sacrifice of one more victim on the all-devouring altar of
Marriage! So Sir Joseph and his sister provided Launcelot Linzie
with the one argument which he wanted to convince Natalie:
"Choose between making the misery of your life by marrying _him_,
and making the happiness of your life by marrying _me._"
<P>
"When shall I see her?" asked Turlington, with Miss Lavinia (in
tears which did _her_ credit) in possession of one of his hands,
and Sir Joseph (in tears which did _him_ credit) in possession of
the other.
<P>
"She will be back to dinner, dear Richard. Stay and dine."
<P>
"Thank you. I must go into the City first. I will come back and
dine."
<P>
With that arrangement in prospect, he left them.
<P>
An hour later a telegram arrived from Natalie. She had consented
to dine, as well as lunch, in Berkeley Square--sleeping there
that night, and returning the next morning. Her father instantly
telegraphed back by the messenger, insisting on Natalie's return
to Muswell Hill that evening, in time to meet Richard Turlington
at dinner.
<P>
"Quite right. Joseph," said Miss Lavinia, looking over her
brother's shoulder, while he wrote the telegram.
<P>
"She is showing a disposition to coquet with Richard," rejoined
Sir Joseph, with the air of a man who knew female human nature in
its remotest corners. "My telegram, Lavinia, will have its
effect."
<P>
Sir Joseph was quite right. His telegram _had_ its effect. It not
only brought his daughter back to dinner--it produced another
result which his prophetic faculty had altogether failed to
foresee.
<P>
The message reached Berkeley Square at five o'clock in the
afternoon. Let us follow the message.
