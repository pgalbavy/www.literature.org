<p>"Move a little lively, boys," added the captain, spurring his
horse to a faster gait; "there'll be some shooting, and they're
closer than they ought to be."</p>

<p>By a providential coincidence, the whole party of rustlers halted
before ascending the ridge, which would give them a view of the
building in which the stockmen were about to make a stand. They
probably saw the impossibility of overtaking the fugitives by
a direct pursuit, and paused to decide upon some different course
of action.</p>

<p>This was proven by what they did a few minutes later, for they
separated into two divisions, one turning to the right and the
other to the left. They seemed to think that the course of their
enemies must change soon, in which case there was a chance of
heading them off and bringing them between two fires. The rustlers
were more familiar with the country than the stockmen, and, had
the chase continued, it is likely it would have resulted as they
expected.</p>

<p>But, strangely enough, these people forgot the Whitney home,
upon which it may be said the horsemen stumbled the next moment.</p>

<p>Down the ridge rode the dozen or more, Hawkridge, Sterry and
Capt. Asbury at the head, with the others almost upon their heels.
In the brisk morning air the frightened Jennie Whitney hastened
to the door and gazed wonderingly upon the party.</p>

<p>She recognized the handsome youth, who doffed his hat, a courtesy
instantly imitated by Hawkridge, the captain, and then the rest
of the men, as they halted in front of the door, where stood the
pale and startled mother, at a loss to understand the meaning
of the strange sight.</p>

<p>"Good-morning!" called Sterry. "Where's Fred?"</p>

<p>"He's on the range with the men, looking after the cattle."</p>

<p>"And are you and your mother alone?"</p>

<p>"We are the only ones in the house. What is the meaning of all
this?" she asked, looking with astonishment at the horsemen.</p>

<p>"We are pursued by a company of rustlers," replied Hawkridge;
"they are directly behind us; I started to lead our friends to
my ranch, but they headed us off, and we were compelled to apply
here for shelter."</p>

<p>"You are welcome," Mrs. Whitney hastened to say; "dismount and
come in as soon as you can."</p>

<p>Sterry, Hawkridge and Capt. Asbury thanked her simultaneously.
Time was beyond value. They expected every instant to hear the
crack of the rifles and the shouts of their enemies on the crest
of the ridge, and could not comprehend why they were delayed.</p>

<p>They dashed to the structure at the rear and a short distance
from the dwelling, into which they ran their horses, slipped off
their trappings, and hurried back to the house.</p>

<p>Every one was inside and not a shot fired, nor was a rustler
seen. It was beyond explanation.</p>

<p>But the stockmen were wise enough to turn to the best account
the grace thus given to them.</p>

<p>They stationed themselves at the front and rear doors and windows
with loaded weapons, on the alert to wing the first rustler who
showed himself.</p>

<p>Sterry found time to exchange a few words with Jennie and her
mother.</p>

<p>"It is too bad," he said, "to put you to this trouble and danger;
but the rustlers outnumber us more than two to one, and it was
the only hope that offered itself."</p>

<p>"And glad am I that it <em>did</em> present itself. O, if my
poor husband had been here when they attacked him!"</p>

<p>"When do you expect the return of Fred?"</p>

<p>"Not before night, and the hands may not come with him. He does
not dream of anything like this."</p>

<p>"Nor did we, a little while ago. Had any other refuge presented
itself we would have seized it; but I never suspected we were
near your home until we came over the ridge and saw it but a few
rods away."</p>

<p>"But, where are they?" asked the wondering Jennie.</p>

<p>"That's something I don't understand, for they were near enough
for their bullets to whistle about our ears."</p>

<p>"They have seen where you took shelter and are afraid to attack
you."</p>

<p>"That may be; but why don't they show themselves?"</p>

<p>At this moment Capt. Asbury approached. Repeating his regrets
that they should place their friends in such danger, he said:</p>

<p>"As there is no saying how long we shall have to stay here, we
ought to learn the nature of our defences. Our horses are in the
stables, where, if the rustlers choose, they can get them, and
they will be pretty sure to choose to do it. They can steal to
the rear of the sheds and take them out without risk. Now, Mrs.
Whitney, we have enough rations with us to last, in a pinch, for
three or four days; how are you fixed?"</p>

<p>"We have but a small quantity of food in the house&mdash;none worth
mentioning."</p>

<p>"No matter how slight, it is worth mentioning. Under the circumstances,
I think we can say we are provisioned for the whole time of the
siege, which must be over in less than a week."</p>

<p>"But how will it end?" asked the lady.</p>

<p>The captain shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Take no thought of the morrow; but what worries me is the question
of water&mdash;how about that?"</p>

<p>A hurried examination disclosed that there was not quite two
pailfuls in the house. Even that was more than usual. The small
stream from which the supply was obtained was beyond the stables
in which the horses were sheltered. Water from that source was
out of the question while the siege continued.</p>

<p>Several of the men had a small quantity in their canteens, but,
inasmuch as no such contingency as this was anticipated, little
preparation had been made.</p>

<p>Still Capt. Asbury expressed himself gratified at the result
of his investigation. The weather was so cool that a moderate
amount of the precious fluid would prevent suffering, and he decided
that, dispensing with what ordinarily was used for cooking purposes,
they could get along quite well for three days, and possibly longer.</p>

<p>The lower part of the flat building consisted of two parts, used
respectively for the kitchen and the dining and sitting-room.
There were four apartments above&mdash;one for the parents, one each
for the son and daughter, and one for visitors. These, of course,
would be held sacred for the members of the family, while the
others found sleep, as opportunity presented, below stairs.</p>

<p>There were windows on all sides of the house; and the structure,
while not strong, was, of course, bullet-proof.</p>

<p>Before all this was ascertained the rustlers showed themselves.
But instead of appearing on the ridge, over which the cattlemen
had ridden, half of them showed themselves on the other side,
having circled around back of the stables.</p>

<p>A moment later the rest were observed on top of the ridge. Thus,
with the exception of the broad level plain stretching in the
direction of the Big Horn Mountains, it may be said that the ranch
was surrounded by the rustlers, who held the stockmen at bay.</p>

<p>What would be the result? None could foresee.</p>

<p>Hawkridge drew Sterry aside and said, in a guarded undertone:</p>

<p>"There is only one thing to be feared."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"It is easy for them to burn this building."</p>

<p>"Do you think they will do that, when they know a couple of women
are inside?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't follow that there is any necessity of their being
burned, nor indeed of any of us suffering from fire. When you
touch off a barn the rats get out, and that's what we shall have
to do."</p>

<p>"But they will give us a chance, first."</p>

<p>"Yes, a chance to surrender, and we might have done that without
putting ourselves to all this trouble."</p>

<p>"And suppose we <em>do</em> surrender, after making the best
fight we can&mdash;what are likely to be the terms offered?"</p>

<p>"They will treat the majority, including myself, as prisoners
of war; but Capt. Asbury, and probably you, will be excepted&mdash;he
because of the killing of Perkins last night, and you because
you have disregarded the warning to leave the country when ordered
to do so."</p>

<p>"All of which is mighty interesting to the captain and myself,"
remarked Sterry, with little evidence of fear; "but we will hope
for better things."</p>
