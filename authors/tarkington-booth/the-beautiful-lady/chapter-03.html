<p>Early the whole of the next day, endeavoring to look preoccupied,
I haunted the lobbies and vicinity of the most expensive hotels,
unable to do any other thing, but ashamed of myself that I had
not returned to my former task of seeking employment, although
still reassured by possession of two louis and some silver, I
dined well at a one-franc coachman's restaurant, where my elegance
created not the slightest surprise, and I felt that I might live
in this way indefinitely.</p>

<p>However, dreams often conclude abruptly, and two louis always
do, as I found, several days later, when, after paying the rent
for my unspeakable lodging and lending twenty francs to a poor,
bad painter, whom I knew and whose wife was ill, I found myself
with the choice of obtaining funds on my finery or not eating,
either of which I was very loath to do. It is not essential for
me to tell any person that when you seek a position it is better
that you appear not too greatly in need of it; and my former garments
had prejudiced many against me, I fear, because they had been
patched by a friendly concierge. Pantaloons suffer as terribly
as do antiques from too obvious restorations; and while I was
only grateful to the good woman's needle (except upon one occasion
when she forgot to remove it), my costume had reached, at last,
great sympathies for the shade of Praxiteles, feeling the same
melancholy over original intentions so far misrepresented by renewals.</p>

<p>Therefore I determined to preserve my fineries to the uttermost;
and it was fortunate that I did so; because, after dining, for
three nights upon nothing but looking out of my window, the fourth
morning brought me a letter from my English friend. I had written
to him, asking if he knew of any people who wished to pay a salary
to a young man who knew how to do nothing. I place his reply in
direct annexation:</p>

<p>"Henrietta Street, Cavendish Square, May 14.</p>

<p>"My dear Ansolini, &mdash;Why haven't you made some of your relatives
do something? I understand that they do not like you; neither
do my own, but after our crupper at Monte Carlo what could mine
do, except provide? If a few pounds (precious few, I fear!) be
of any service to you, let me know. In the mean time, if you are
serious about a position, I may, preposterously enough, set you
in the way of it. There is an old thundering Yankee here, whom
I met in the States, and who believed me a god because I am the
nephew of my awful uncle, for whose career he has ever had, it
appears, a life-long admiration, sir! Now, by chance, meeting
this person in the street, it developed that he had need of a
man, precisely such a one as you are not: a sober, tutorish, middle-aged,
dissenting parson, to trot about the Continent tied to a dancing
bear. It is the old gentleman's cub, who is a species of Caliban
in fine linen, and who has taken a few too many liberties in the
land of the free. In fact, I believe he is much a youth of my
own kind with similar admiration for baccarat and good cellars.
His father must return at once, and has decided (the cub's native
heath and friends being too wild) to leave him in charge of a
proper guide, philosopher, courier, chaplain, and friend, if such
can be found, the same required to travel with the cub and keep
him out of mischief. I thought of your letter directly, and I
have given you the most tremendous recommendation&mdash;part of it
quite true, I suspect, though I am not a judge of learning. I
explained, however, that you are a master of languages, of elegant
though subdued deportment, and I extolled at length your saintly
habits. Altogether, I fear there may have been too much of the
virtuoso in my interpretation of you; few would have recognized
from it the gentleman who closed a table at Monte Carlo and afterwards
was closed himself in the handsome and spectacular fashion I remember
with both delight and regret. Briefly, I lied like a master. He
almost had me in the matter of your age; it was important that
you should be middle-aged. I swore that you were at least thirty-eight,
but, owing to exemplary habits, looked very much younger. The
cub himself is twenty-four.</p>

<p>"Hence, if you are really serious and determined not to appeal
to your people, call at once upon Mr. Lambert R. Poor, of the
Hotel d'Iena. He is the father, and the cub is with him. The elder
Yankee is primed with my praises of you, and must engage someone
at once, as he sails in a day or two. Go&mdash;with my blessing, an
air of piety, and as much age as you can assume. When the father
has departed, throw the cub into the Seine, but preserve his pocket-book,
and we shall have another go at those infernal tables. Vale! <em>J.G.S</em>."</p>

<p>I found myself smiling &mdash;I fear miserably&mdash;over this kind
letter, especially at the wonder of my friend that I had not appealed
to my relatives. The only ones who would have liked to help me,
if they had known I needed something, were my two little nieces
who were in my own care; because my father, being but a poet,
had no family, and my mother had lost hers, even her eldest son,
by marrying my father. After that they would have nothing to do
with her, nor were they asked. That rascally old Antonio was now
the head of all the Caravacioli, as was I of my own outcast branch
of our house&mdash;that is, of my two little nieces and myself. It
was partly of these poor infants I had thought when I took what
was left of my small inheritance to Monte Carlo, hoping, since
I seemed to be incapable of increasing it in any other way, that
number seventeen and black would hand me over a fortune as a waiter
does wine. Alas! Luck is not always a fool's servant, and the
kind of fortune she handed me was of that species the waiter brings
you in the other bottle of champagne, the gold of a bubbling brain,
lasting an hour. After this there is always something evil to
one's head, and mine, alas! was shaved.</p>

<p>Half an hour after I had read the letter, the little paper-flower
makers in the attic window across from mine may have seen me shaving
it&mdash;without pleasure&mdash;again. What else was I to do? I could not
well expect to be given the guardianship of an erring young man
if I presented myself to his parent as a gentleman who had been
sitting at the Cafe' de la Paix with his head painted. I could
not wear my hat through the interview. I could not exhibit the
thick five days' stubble, to appear in contrast with the heavy
fringe that had been spared; &mdash;I could not trim the fringe
to the shortness of the stubble; I should have looked like Pierrot.
I had only, then, to remain bald, and, if I obtained the post,
to shave in secret&mdash;a harmless and mournful imposition.</p>

<p>It was well for me that I came to this determination. I believe
it was the appearance of maturity which my head and dining upon
thoughts lent me, as much as my friend's praises, which created
my success with the amiable Mr. Lambert R. Poor. I witness that
my visit to him provided one of the most astonishing interviews
of my life. He was an instance of those strange beings of the
Western republic, at whom we are perhaps too prone to pass from
one of ourselves to another the secret smile, because of some
little imperfections of manner. It is a type which has grown more
and more familiar to us, yet never less strange: the man in costly
but severe costume, big, with a necessary great waistcoat, not
noticing the loudness of his own voice; as ignorant of the thousand
tiny things which we observe and feel as he would be careless
of them (except for his wife) if he knew. We laugh at him, sometimes
even to his face, and he does not perceive it. We are a little
afraid that he is too large to see it; hence too large for us
to comprehend, and in spite of our laughter we are always conscious
of a force&mdash;yes, of a presence! We jeer slyly, but we respect,
fear a little, and would trust.</p>

<p>Such was my patron. He met me with a kind greeting, looked at
me very earnestly, but smiling as if he understood my good intentions,
as one understands the friendliness of a capering poodle, yet
in such a way that I could not feel resentment, for I could see
that he looked at almost everyone in the same fashion.</p>

<p>My friend had done wonders for me; and I made the best account
of myself that I could, so that within half an hour it was arranged
that I should take charge of his son, with an honourarium which
gave me great rejoicing for my nieces and my accumulated appetite.</p>

<p>"I think I can pick men," he said, "and I think that you are
the man I want. You're old enough and you've seen enough, and
you know enough to keep one fool boy in order for six months."</p>

<p>So frankly he spoke of his son, yet not without affection and
confidence. Before I left, he sent for the youth himself, Lambert
R. Poor, Jr.,&mdash;not at all a Caliban, but a most excellent-appearing,
tall gentleman, of astonishingly meek countenance. He gave me
a sad, slow look from his blue eyes at first; then with a brightening
smile he gently shook my hand, murmuring that he was very glad
in the prospect of knowing me better; after which the parent defined
before him, with singular elaboration, my duties. I was to correct
all things in his behaviour which I considered improper or absurd.
I was to dictate the line of travel, to have a restraining influence
upon expenditures; in brief, to control the young man as a governess
does a child.</p>

<p>To all of his parent's instructions Poor Jr. returned a dutiful
nod and expressed perfect acquiescence. The following day the
elder sailed from Cherbourg, and I took up my quarters with the
son.</p>
