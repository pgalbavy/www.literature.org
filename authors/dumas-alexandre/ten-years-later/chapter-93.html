<P>Raoul and the Comte de la Fere reached Paris the evening of
the same day on which Buckingham had held the conversation
with the queen-mother. The count had scarcely arrived, when,
through Raoul, he solicited an audience of the king. His
majesty had passed a portion of the morning in looking over,
with Madame and the ladies of the court, various goods of
Lyons manufacture, of which he had made his sister-in-law a
present. A court dinner had succeeded, then cards, and
afterwards, according to his usual custom, the king, leaving
the card-tables at eight o'clock, passed into his cabinet in
order to work with M. Colbert and M. Fouquet. Raoul entered
the ante-chamber at the very moment the two ministers
quitted it, and the king, perceiving him through the
half-closed door, said, &quot;What do you want, M. de
Bragelonne?&quot;</P>
<P>The young man approached: &quot;An audience, sire,&quot; he replied,
&quot;for the Comte de la Fere, who has just arrived from Blois,
and is most anxious to have an interview with your majesty.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have an hour to spare between cards and supper,&quot; said the
king. &quot;Is the Comte de la Fere at hand?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He is below, and awaits your majesty's permission.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let him come up at once,&quot; said the king, and five minutes
afterwards Athos entered the presence of Louis XIV. He was
received by the king with that gracious kindness of manner
which Louis, with a tact beyond his years, reserved for the
purpose of gaining those who were not to be conquered by
ordinary favors. &quot;Let me hope, comte,&quot; said the king, &quot;that
you have come to ask me for something.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will not conceal from your majesty,&quot; replied the comte,
&quot;that I am indeed come for that purpose.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is well,&quot; said the king, joyously.</P>
<P>&quot;It is not for myself, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So much the worse; but, at least, I will do for your
protege what you refuse to permit me to do for you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your majesty encourages me. I have come to speak on behalf
of the Vicomte de Bragelonne.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is the same as if you spoke on your own behalf, comte.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not altogether so, sire. I am desirous of obtaining from
your majesty that which I cannot ask for myself. The vicomte
thinks of marrying.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He is still very young; but that does not matter. He is an
eminently distinguished man, I will choose a wife for him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He has already chosen one, sire, and only awaits your
consent.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is only a question, then, of signing the
marriage-contract?&quot; Athos bowed. &quot;Has he chosen a wife whose
fortune and position accord with your own anticipations?&quot;</P>
<P>Athos hesitated for a moment. &quot;His affianced wife is of good
birth, but has no fortune.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is a misfortune we can remedy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You overwhelm me with gratitude, sire; but your majesty
will permit me to offer a remark?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do so, comte.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your majesty seems to intimate an intention of giving a
marriage-portion to this young lady.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I should regret, sire, if the step I have taken towards
your majesty should be attended by this result.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No false delicacy, comte; what is the bride's name?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mademoiselle de la Baume le Blanc de la Valliere,&quot; said
Athos, coldly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I seem to know that name,&quot; said the king, as if reflecting;
&quot;there was a Marquis de la Valliere&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sire, it is his daughter.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But he died, and his widow married again M. de Saint-Remy,
I think, steward of the wager Madame's household.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your majesty is correctly informed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;More than that, the young lady has lately become one of the
princess's maids of honor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your majesty is better acquainted with her history than I
am.&quot;</P>
<P>The king again reflected, and glancing at the comte's
anxious countenance, said: &quot;The young lady does not seem to
me to be very pretty, comte.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am not quite sure,&quot; replied Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;I have seen her, but she hardly struck me as being so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;She seems to be a good and modest girl, but has little
beauty, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Beautiful fair hair, however.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And her blue eyes are tolerably good.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;With regard to beauty, then, the match is but an ordinary
one. Now for the money side of the question.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Fifteen to twenty thousand francs dowry at the very
outside, sire; the lovers are disinterested enough; for
myself, I care little for money.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For superfluity, you mean; but a needful amount is of
importance. With fifteen thousand francs, without landed
property, a woman cannot live at court. We will make up the
deficiency; I will do it for De Bragelonne.&quot; The king again
remarked the coldness with which Athos received the remark.</P>
<P>&quot;Let us pass from the question of money to that of rank,&quot;
said Louis XIV.; &quot;the daughter of the Marquis de la
Valliere, that is well enough; but there is that excellent
Saint-Remy, who somewhat damages the credit of the family;
and you, comte, are rather particular, I believe, about your
own family.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sire, I no longer hold to anything but my devotion to your
majesty.&quot;</P>
<P>The king again paused. &quot;A moment, comte. You have surprised
me in no little degree from the beginning of your
conversation. You came to ask me to authorize a marriage,
and you seem greatly disturbed in having to make the
request. Nay, pardon me, comte, but I am rarely deceived,
young as I am; for while with some persons I place my
friendship at the disposal of my understanding, with others
I call my distrust to my aid, by which my discernment is
increased. I repeat that you do not prefer your request as
though you wished it success.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, sire, that is true.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do not understand you, then; refuse.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nay, sire; I love De Bragelonne with my whole heart; he is
smitten with Mademoiselle de la Valliere, he weaves dreams
of bliss for the future; I am not one who is willing to
destroy the illusions of youth. This marriage is
objectionable to me, but I implore your majesty to consent
to it forthwith, and thus make Raoul happy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tell me, comte, is she in love with him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If your majesty requires me to speak candidly, I do not
believe in Mademoiselle de la Valliere's affection; the
delight at being at court, the honor of being in the service
of Madame, counteract in her head whatever affection she may
happen to have in her heart; it is a marriage similar to
many others which already exist at court; but De Bragelonne
wishes it, and so let it be.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And yet you do not resemble those easy-tempered fathers who
volunteer as stepping-stones for their children,&quot; said the
king.</P>
<P>&quot;I am determined enough against the viciously disposed, but
not so against men of upright character. Raoul is suffering;
he is in great distress of mind: his disposition, naturally
light and cheerful, has become gloomy and melancholy. I do
not wish to deprive your majesty of the services he may be
able to render.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I understand you,&quot; said the king; &quot;and what is more, I
understand your heart, too, comte.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is no occasion, therefore,&quot; replied the comte, &quot;to
tell your majesty that my object is to make these children,
or rather Raoul, happy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And I, too, as much as yourself, comte, wish to secure M.
de Bragelonne's happiness.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I only await your majesty's signature. Raoul will have the
honor of presenting himself before your majesty to receive
your consent.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are mistaken, comte,&quot; said the king, firmly; &quot;I have
just said that I desire to secure M. de Bragelonne's
happiness, and from the present moment, therefore, I oppose
his marriage.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But, sire,&quot; exclaimed Athos, &quot;your majesty has promised!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not so, comte, I did not promise you, for it is opposed to
my own views.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I appreciate your majesty's considerate and generous
intentions in my behalf; but I take the liberty of recalling
to you that I undertook to approach you as an ambassador.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;An ambassador, comte, frequently asks, but does not always
obtain what he asks.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But, sire, it will be such a blow for De Bragelonne.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My hand shall deal the blow; I will speak to the vicomte.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Love, sir, is overwhelming in its might.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Love can be resisted, comte. I myself can assure you of
that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When one has the soul of a king,  -  your own, for instance,
sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do not make yourself uneasy on the subject. I have certain
views for De Bragelonne. I do not say that he shall not
marry Mademoiselle de la Valliere, but I do not wish him to
marry so young; I do not wish him to marry her until she has
acquired a fortune; and he, on his side, no less deserves
favor, such as I wish to confer upon him. In a word, comte,
I wish them to wait.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yet once more, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Comte, you told me you came to request a favor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Assuredly, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Grant me one, then, instead; let us speak no longer upon
this matter. It is probable that, before long, war may be
declared. I require men about me who are unfettered. I
should hesitate to send under fire a married man, or a
father of a family. I should hesitate also, on De
Bragelonne's account, to endow with a fortune, without some
sound reason for it, a young girl, a perfect stranger; such
an act would sow jealousy amongst my nobility.&quot; Athos bowed,
and remained silent.</P>
<P>&quot;Is that all you wished to ask me?&quot; added Louis XIV.</P>
<P>&quot;Absolutely all, sire; and I take my leave of your majesty.
Is it, however, necessary that I should inform Raoul?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Spare yourself the trouble and annoyance. Tell the vicomte
that at my levee to-morrow morning I will speak to him. I
shall expect you this evening, comte, to join my
card-table.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am in traveling-costume, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A day will come, I hope, when you will leave me no more.
Before long, comte, the monarchy will be established in such
a manner as to enable me to offer a worthy hospitality to
men of your merit.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Provided, sire, a monarch reigns grandly in the hearts of
his subjects, the palace he inhabits matters little, since
he is worshipped in a temple.&quot; With these words Athos left
the cabinet, and found De Bragelonne, who was awaiting him
anxiously.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, monsieur?&quot; said the young man.</P>
<P>&quot;The king, Raoul, is well intentioned towards us both; not,
perhaps, in the sense you suppose, but he is kind, and
generously disposed to our house.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You have bad news to communicate to me, monsieur,&quot; said the
young man, turning very pale.</P>
<P>&quot;The king himself will inform you tomorrow morning that it
is not bad news.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The king has not signed, however?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The king wishes himself to settle the terms of the
contract, and he desires to make it so grand that he
requires time for consideration. Throw the blame rather on
your own impatience, than on the king's good feeling towards
you.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul, in utter consternation, on account of his knowledge
of the count's frankness as well as his diplomacy, remained
plunged in dull and gloomy stupor.</P>
<P>&quot;Will you not go with me to my lodgings?&quot; said Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;I beg your pardon, monsieur; I will follow you,&quot; he
stammered out, following Athos down the staircase.</P>
<P>&quot;Since I am here,&quot; said Athos, suddenly, &quot;cannot I see M.
d'Artagnan?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Shall I show you his apartments?&quot; said De Bragelonne.</P>
<P>&quot;Do so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They are on the opposite staircase.&quot;</P>
<P>They altered their course, but on reaching the landing of
the grand staircase, Raoul perceived a servant in the Comte
de Guiche's livery, who ran towards him as soon as he heard
his voice.</P>
<P>&quot;What is it?&quot; said Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;This note, monsieur. My master heard of your return and
wrote to you without delay; I have been looking for you for
the last half-hour.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul approached Athos as he unsealed the letter. saying,
&quot;With your permission, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Dear Raoul,&quot; wrote the Comte de Guiche, &quot;I have an affair
in hand which requires immediate attention; I know you have
returned, come to me as soon as possible.&quot;</P>
<P>Hardly had he finished reading it, when a servant in the
livery of the Duke of Buckingham, turning out of the
gallery, recognized Raoul, and approached him respectfully,
saying, &quot;From his Grace, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, Raoul, as I see you are already as busy as a general
of an army, I shall leave you, and will find M. d'Artagnan
myself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will excuse me, I trust,&quot; said Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes, I excuse you; adieu, Raoul; you will find me at
my apartments until to-morrow; during the day I may set out
for Blois, unless I have orders to the contrary.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I shall present my respects to you to-morrow, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>As soon as Athos had left, Raoul opened Buckingham's letter.</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur de Bragelonne,&quot; it ran, &quot;You are, of all the
Frenchmen I have known, the one with whom I am most pleased;
I am about to put your friendship to the proof. I have
received a certain message, written in very good French. As
I am an Englishman, I am afraid of not comprehending it very
clearly. The letter has a good name attached to it, and that
is all I can tell you. Will you be good enough to come and
see me? for I am told you have arrived from Blois.</P>
<P>&quot;Your devoted</P>
<P>&quot;Villiers, Duke of Buckingham.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am going now to see your master,&quot; said Raoul to De
Guiche's servant, as he dismissed him; &quot;and I shall be with
the Duke of Buckingham in an hour,&quot; he added, dismissing
with these words the duke's messenger.</P></article>
