<p>All day long the two axes swung vigorously. Both Jeff and Tim
were expert woodmen, and they felled pine after pine. Hardman
pleaded that he was unaccustomed to such work; but Jeff grimly
told him he could never have a better chance to learn to cut down
trees, and compelled him to take his turn. The work was continued
until dark, which, it will be remembered, comes much later in
the far North than in our latitude.</p>

<p>The distance between the scene of their work and the point where
the outfits and goods were piled was so slight that there was
really no need of the boys remaining on guard. Feeling that they
were favored too much, they sauntered to the wood and asked the
privilege of taking a hand in felling the trees. It was granted;
but they made such sorry work, finding it almost impossible to
sink the blade twice in the same spot, that they yielded the implements
to those who understood the business so much better.</p>

<p>The snow was deep, and the camp was much the same as the one
made before entering Chilkoot Pass. All were tired, and lay down
after the evening meal, glad of the opportunity for a few hours'
sleep.</p>

<p>In accordance with their agreement, the boys said nothing to
either of their friends about what Frank had observed on the boat.
It was understood between them that they were to feign sleep,
but to keep watch of Hardman during the night as long as they
could remain awake. Ordinarily it is a difficult if not impossible
task for one to fight off the insidious approach of slumber, but
Frank Mansley had wrought himself into such a state of anxiety
that he was sure he could command his senses until well toward
morning.</p>

<p>He and Roswell lay under the same blanket, with their backs to
each other, while the others were by themselves, the interior
of the tent barely permitting the arrangement. Had any one stealthily
entered fifteen minutes after they had lain down, he would have
declared that all were asleep, though such was not the fact.</p>

<p>Despite his nervousness, Frank was beginning to feel drowsy when
he was startled and set on edge by a sound that penetrated the
profound silence. It resembled the whistle of a bird from the
timber, soft, clear, and tremulous. Almost in the same instant
he heard one of the men rise stealthily from his couch. It was
easy to determine, from the direction of the slight rustle, that
it was Hardman.</p>

<p>Frank thrust his elbow into the back of his comrade as a warning
for him to be alert; but there was no response. Roswell had been
asleep for an hour. It was too dark to perceive anything within
the tent, though all was clear outside; but the lad's senses were
in that tense condition that he heard the man lift the flap of
the tent and move softly over the snow on the outside. With the
same silence, Frank flung back the blanket that enveloped him
and stepped out on the packed snow of the interior. Pausing but
a moment, he crept through the opening. In that cold region men
sleep in their clothing, so he had nothing to fear from exposure.</p>

<p>The night was brilliantly clear, the sky studded with stars,
and not a breath of air stirring. He remained a brief while in
a crouching posture, while he peered in different directions.
Before him stretched the lake, its shores crusted with snow and
ice, with the cold water shining in the star-gleam. Still stooping
low and looking intently about him, he saw something move between
the tent and the water. A second glance revealed Hardman, who
was standing alone and looking about him, as if he expected the
approach of some person. Impatient at the delay, he repeated the
signal that had aroused the attention of Frank a few minutes before.</p>

<p>The tremulous note had scarcely pierced the air when a shadowy
form emerged from the wood and walked the short distance that
took him to the waiting Hardman. The two were so far off that
it was impossible to identify him; but the lad was as certain
it was the man who had exchanged the words and signs with Hardman
as if the noonday sun were shining.</p>

<p>Frank Mansley would have given anything he had to be able to
steal near enough to overhear what passed between them, but that
was clearly impossible. To move from his place by the tent was
certain to bring instant detection. Now and then he could catch
the faint murmur of their voices, but not once was he able to
distinguish a syllable that was uttered.</p>

<p>The interview lasted but a short time. Whatever understanding
was reached between the plotters must have been simple, else it
would not have been effected so soon. Suddenly the stranger moved
off over the snow in the direction of the wood and disappeared
among the trees. At the same moment Hardman moved silently toward
the tent. Frank was on the alert, and when the man entered he
was lying on his couch, his blanket over him, and his chilled
body against the warm form of his comrade, who recoiled slightly
with a shiver, though he did not awake.</p>

<p>The fear of Frank Mansley had been that the two men were plotting
some scheme for the robbery of Jeff, though it would seem that
they would prefer to wait until he had made a strike in the gold
district. What the youth had seen convinced him that the latter
plan would be followed, or at least attempted, and he had hardly
reached that conclusion when he fell asleep.</p>

<p>"You're a pretty fellow to stand guard," he remarked to his cousin
the next morning, after the men had gone to the wood again.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<em>YOU'RE A PRETTY FELLOW TO STAND GUARD," SAID
FRANK</em>.]</p>

<p>"I didn't try to stand guard," replied Roswell with a laugh;
"I was lying down all the time."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you keep awake?"</p>

<p>"Because I fell asleep, and you would have done the same if you
hadn't kept awake."</p>

<p>"Probably I should&mdash;most people do; but what do you think of
it, Roswell?"</p>

<p>"First tell me something to think of."</p>

<p>His cousin told all that he had seen the night before.</p>

<p>"There can't be any doubt that Hardman and one, if not all three
of those fellows, are plotting mischief. It might have been one
of the others who signalled to and met him. I think we ought to
tell Jeff."</p>

<p>"We'll do so before night. It isn't likely Hardman suspects anything,
and you will have no trouble in finding the chance."</p>

<p>"You think it best that I should tell Jeff?"</p>

<p>"By all means, since you will tell what you saw. Such things
are best first-hand; but neither of us will say anything to Tim."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Jeff is the leader of this expedition. Tim is so soft-hearted
that likely enough he would try to convince Hardman of his wrongdoing,
and so put him on his guard. Let Jeff tell him if he chooses."</p>

<p>"I hope he will drive Hardman out of our party; my impression
of him is that he would not only rob but kill for the sake of
gold."</p>

<p>Roswell looked grave. The same thought had been in his mind,
but he disliked to give expression to it. He hoped his cousin
was wrong, but could not feel certain that he was.</p>

<p>"Frank, make an excuse for calling Jeff here; he ought to know
of this at once."</p>

<p>Looking toward the timber, they saw that their friend had just
given up his axe to Hardman, who was swinging it a short distance
from where Tim McCabe was lustily doing the same. Frank called
to him, and when the old miner looked around, he beckoned for
him to approach. Jeff slouched forward, wondering why the boys
had summoned him from his work. He was quickly told. He listened,
silent, but deeply interested, until the story was finished. Then,
without any excitement, he said, "Don't let Tim know anything
of this, younkers;" and, with a strange gleam in his keen gray
eyes, the old man added, "I've got a Winchester and a revolver,
and I keep 'em both loaded, and I've plenty of ammunition. I think
I'll have use for 'em purty soon."</p>
