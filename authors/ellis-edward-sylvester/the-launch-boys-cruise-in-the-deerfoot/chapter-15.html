<p>The steamer was a small one running between Wiscasset and Boothbay
Harbor by way of the Sheepscot. She rounded gracefully to at the
wharf at Charmount, making fast with the ease of long habit, and
amid the trucks, laden with freight and shoved and pulled by trotting
men, nearly a dozen passengers hurried aboard, among them being
Mr. Richards and his young friends.</p>

<p>Leaving Alvin and Chester to themselves, Richards entered the
pilot house where he shook hands with the captain and sat down.
The visitor was welcome wherever he went, for every one knew him
as among the most trustworthy of men. During the brief halt at
the landing, Richards told his story to which the captain listened
attentively.</p>

<p>"I have noticed that boat," he remarked; "she is one of the prettiest
in these parts; it was a daring piece of thievery, and is sure
to get the scamps into trouble."</p>

<p>"I want you to keep a lookout on the way to Squirrel."</p>

<p>"Don't I always do that, Keyes?"</p>

<p>"I am not certain; but a good many folks think so, and that's
as good as if you really did attend to business. Now, if the launch
has kept going, of course we shall see nothing of her."</p>

<p>"And if she hasn't kept going and doesn't wish to be seen by
us, she won't have any trouble in hiding. There are lots of places
where you couldn't glimpse her with a telescope. I won't forget,
and will give you what help I can."</p>

<p>Just then the captain signalled to the engineer, the screw of
the steamer began churning and she swung out into the crystalline
current. Richards kept his seat behind the captain, the two exchanging
remarks now and then and both scanning the water and banks as
they glided past. Several times the caller slipped out of the
small pilot house, and, shading his eyes with one hand, studied
the shore like an eagle watching its prey. They passed small sailboats,
exchanged toots with other steamers and made their landings nearly
always on time.</p>

<p>While Mr. Richards was scrutinizing the banks, islands and the
mouths of the small bays and inlets, Alvin and Chester were similarly
engaged. They seated themselves at the extreme stern under the
awning where the view on the right and left was as unobstructed
as it could be.</p>

<p>They had come to the belief that the persons who robbed the Rockledge
post-office included the two whom they saw at Boothbay Harbor,
and that one of the couple took part in the attack upon Alvin
when making his way home some nights before.</p>

<p>"When you remember that they were the same number as ourselves
and that they wore yachting suits, it is easy to understand how
the constable made his mistake."</p>

<p>"Not forgetting our villainous looks," added Chester.</p>

<p>"I understand there have been so many post office robberies in
this part of Maine that there is no doubt that a well-organized
gang is at work."</p>

<p>"And these three belong to it."</p>

<p>"There are more beside them. It looks as if they have divided
a certain part of the State among them, and our acquaintances
have been given this section. There are several facts about this
business which I don't understand."</p>

<p>"It's the same with me. For instance, why should those fellows
steal your boat? They have one of their own."</p>

<p>"It may be so far off that they could reach it much sooner with
the help they got from the <em>Deerfoot</em>."</p>

<p>"I don't see how that can be, for they must have come up the
river in their own craft and meant to go back to it with their
booty. They would be sure to leave it at the most convenient place,
which would be as near if not nearer than where we went ashore
at the blockhouse."</p>

<p>"That would seem so, but if true they must have known they would
add to their danger by stealing another boat. No, Alvin, we are
off in our guesses."</p>

<p>"Can you do any better?"</p>

<p>"No, but you remember when studying in our school history the
capture of Major Andre, that the British sloop-of-war <em>Vulture</em>
went up the Hudson to take him on board after his meeting with
Benedict Arnold. The spy would have been saved that way, if the
sloop hadn't been forced to drop down stream, so that when Andre
needed it, the vessel was not there. Now suppose it was something
like that with these people."</p>

<p>Alvin thought over this view of the situation, but shook his
head.</p>

<p>"It doesn't strike me as likely. But what's the use of guessing?
The most curious part of it all to me is that they should have
come along when we were sitting behind the blockhouse and find
the <em>Deerfoot</em> waiting for them. A few minutes earlier
or later and nothing of the kind could have happened. Then, too,
we hadn't a thought of halting there till Mike's curiosity caused
us to go ashore. Do you know, Chester, I am more anxious about
Mike than about the motor boat?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand why."</p>

<p>"We are sure to get back the launch sooner or later, but, as
I said, Mike is so headlong, so fond of a shindy, as he calls
it, and so eager to get another chance at the fellow who ran away
from him, that he is likely to run into trouble."</p>

<p>"He has been doing that all his life, and yet has managed to
fight his way out. I haven't any fear of his not being able to
do so this time."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that if we don't get any trace of the <em>Deerfoot</em>
on the way down, we may as well get off at Southport and send
despatches to all the points along the river, asking that a lookout
be kept for our boat, and word be sent to me as soon as anything
is picked up. I am not worrying about the launch, only that those
villains are robbing us of a lot of fun which we counted upon."</p>

<p>"We'll take the advice of Mr. Richards; he may think that Boothbay
Harbor, where he lives, is the best point to send out inquiries."</p>

<p>Now, our young friends cannot be censured because they talked
in their ordinary tones, taking no pains to keep what they said
from those around them. They were equally blameless in not noticing
a certain gentleman who sat two or three paces away on the bench
which curved around the upper deck, apparently absorbed in reading
the last copy of the Lewiston <em>Journal</em>. He smoked a big
black cigar and seemed to be interested solely in his paper. None
the less, he had taken his seat for the purpose of hearing the
conversation, and he did not allow a word to elude him. He wore
a gray business suit, with a white Fedora hat, a colored shirt
and a modest striped necktie. The face was strong, with clean
cut features, and was shaven clean of all beard. His eyes were
gray and his manner alert. Most of the time he held the paper
so high above his crossed legs that his face would have been invisible
to the boys had they looked at him. But there were three other
men, as many women, and a couple of children near that were equally
interesting to Alvin and Chester, who feeling they had nothing
to conceal, made no effort to conceal it.</p>

<p>"There would be a good hiding place for the <em>Deerfoot</em>,"
suddenly exclaimed Alvin, springing to his feet and indicating
a part of Barter Island, whose northern end is just below Point
Quarry, from which it is separated by Cross River. Thence it reaches
southward for nearly five miles, not far from Sawyer Island and
the Isle of Springs.</p>

<p>The point indicated by Alvin was near the southern extremity
of Barter Island, and was a small inlet, inclosed by dense pines
on all sides, and curving slightly to the north a little distance
from the stream. The opening was broad enough to admit any of
the steamers which pass up and down the river, though none of
them ever turns in, since there is no cause for doing so. Had
the <em>Deerfoot</em> chosen to make the entrance, it could have
been screened from sight by the turn of the small bay, and the
thickly wooded shores.</p>

<p>As the boat glided swiftly past the boys scrutinized every part
of the inlet in their field of vision, but saw nothing to give
hope that it was the hiding place of the stolen launch. It was
not to be wondered at, for they had already passed a score of
places that offered just as safe refuge.</p>

<p>Neither Alvin nor Chester noticed that the man in a gray suit
turned partly round, dropped his paper on his knee, and also studied
the little bay upon which their gaze was fixed. He wore no glasses,
for his sharp eyes did not need artificial help. Even had his
action been observed by the youths, they would have thought nothing
of it, for the exclamation of Alvin caused several of the passengers
to take the same survey.</p>

<p>The steamer had hardly passed the bit of water and the boys were
still standing, when Mr. Richards came out of the pilot house
and hurried to them.</p>

<p>"Did you see anything?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No; did you?" asked Alvin in turn.</p>

<p>"I am not certain, but the captain and I caught a glimpse of
something which we thought might be the stern or bow of a motor
boat like yours, though as likely as not it was nothing of the
kind."</p>

<p>"Can you get the captain to put us ashore?" eagerly asked Alvin.
"I'll pay him for his trouble."</p>

<p>Richards shook his head and smiled.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't do it for a thousand dollars; there is no place
to make a landing, though he might use one of the boats to have
you rowed to land. He halts only at certain fixed points."</p>

<p>"What is the best we can do?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to find out what it is that is lying in that inlet?"</p>

<p>Alvin replied that such was the wish of himself and his companion.</p>
