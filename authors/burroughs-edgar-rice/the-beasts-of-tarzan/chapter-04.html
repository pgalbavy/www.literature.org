The next few days were occupied by Tarzan in completing
his weapons and exploring the jungle.  He strung his
bow with tendons from the buck upon which he had dined
his first evening upon the new shore, and though he would
have preferred the gut of Sheeta for the purpose, he was
content to wait until opportunity permitted him to kill
one of the great cats.
<P>
He also braided a long grass rope--such a rope as he had
used so many years before to tantalize the ill-natured Tublat,
and which later had developed into a wondrous effective
weapon in the practised hands of the little ape-boy.
<P>
A sheath and handle for his hunting-knife he fashioned,
and a quiver for arrows, and from the hide of Bara a belt
and loin-cloth.  Then he set out to learn something of the
strange land in which he found himself.  That it was not his
old familiar west coast of the African continent he knew from
the fact that it faced east--the rising sun came up out of the
sea before the threshold of the jungle.
<P>
But that it was not the east coast of Africa he was equally
positive, for he felt satisfied that the Kincaid had not
passed through the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, and the Red Sea,
nor had she had time to round the Cape of Good Hope.  So he was
quite at a loss to know where he might be.
<P>
Sometimes he wondered if the ship had crossed the broad
Atlantic to deposit him upon some wild South American
shore; but the presence of Numa, the lion, decided him that
such could not be the case.
<P>
As Tarzan made his lonely way through the jungle paralleling
the shore, he felt strong upon him a desire for companionship,
so that gradually he commenced to regret that he had not cast
his lot with the apes.  He had seen nothing of them since that
first day, when the influences of civilization were still
paramount within him.
<P>
Now he was more nearly returned to the Tarzan of old,
and though he appreciated the fact that there could be
little in common between himself and the great anthropoids,
still they were better than no company at all.
<P>
Moving leisurely, sometimes upon the ground and again
among the lower branches of the trees, gathering an occasional
fruit or turning over a fallen log in search of the larger
bugs, which he still found as palatable as of old, Tarzan had
covered a mile or more when his attention was attracted by
the scent of Sheeta up-wind ahead of him.
<P>
Now Sheeta, the panther, was one of whom Tarzan was exceptionally
glad to fall in with, for he had it in mind not only to utilize
the great cat's strong gut for his bow, but also to fashion
a new quiver and loin-cloth from pieces of his hide.  
So, whereas the ape-man had gone carelessly before,
he now became the personification of noiseless stealth.
<P>
Swiftly and silently he glided through the forest in the wake
of the savage cat, nor was the pursuer, for all his noble birth,
one whit less savage than the wild, fierce thing he stalked.
<P>
As he came closer to Sheeta he became aware that the panther
on his part was stalking game of his own, and even as he realized
this fact there came to his nostrils, wafted from his right by a
vagrant breeze, the strong odour of a company of great apes.
<P>
The panther had taken to a large tree as Tarzan came within
sight of him, and beyond and below him Tarzan saw the tribe
of Akut lolling in a little, natural clearing.  Some of them
were dozing against the boles of trees, while others roamed
about turning over bits of bark from beneath which they
transferred the luscious grubs and beetles to their mouths.
<P>
Akut was the closest to Sheeta.
<P>
The great cat lay crouched upon a thick limb, hidden from
the ape's view by dense foliage, waiting patiently until the
anthropoid should come within range of his spring.
<P>
Tarzan cautiously gained a position in the same tree with the
panther and a little above him.  In his left hand he grasped
his slim stone blade.  He would have preferred to use his noose,
but the foliage surrounding the huge cat precluded the possibility
of an accurate throw with the rope.
<P>
Akut had now wandered quite close beneath the tree wherein
lay the waiting death.  Sheeta slowly edged his hind paws
along the branch still further beneath him, and then with
a hideous shriek he launched himself toward the great ape.  
The barest fraction of a second before his spring another
beast of prey above him leaped, its weird and savage cry
mingling with his.
<P>
As the startled Akut looked up he saw the panther almost
above him, and already upon the panther's back the white
ape that had bested him that day near the great water.
<P>
The teeth of the ape-man were buried in the back of Sheeta's
neck and his right arm was round the fierce throat, while
the left hand, grasping a slender piece of stone, rose and fell
in mighty blows upon the panther's side behind the left shoulder.
<P>
Akut had just time to leap to one side to avoid being
pinioned beneath these battling monsters of the jungle.
<P>
With a crash they came to earth at his feet.  Sheeta was screaming,
snarling, and roaring horribly; but the white ape clung
tenaciously and in silence to the thrashing body of his quarry.
<P>
Steadily and remorselessly the stone knife was driven home
through the glossy hide--time and again it drank deep, until
with a final agonized lunge and shriek the great feline rolled
over upon its side and, save for the spasmodic jerking of its
muscles, lay quiet and still in death.
<P>
Then the ape-man raised his head, as he stood over the
carcass of his kill, and once again through the jungle rang
his wild and savage victory challenge.
<P>
Akut and the apes of Akut stood looking in startled wonder
at the dead body of Sheeta and the lithe, straight figure of
the man who had slain him.
<P>
Tarzan was the first to speak.
<P>
He had saved Akut's life for a purpose, and, knowing the
limitations of the ape intellect, he also knew that he must
make this purpose plain to the anthropoid if it were to serve
him in the way he hoped.
<P>
"I am Tarzan of the Apes," he said, "Mighty hunter.  Mighty fighter.
By the great water I spared Akut's life when I might have taken it
and become king of the tribe of Akut.  Now I have saved Akut from
death beneath the rending fangs of Sheeta.
<P>
"When Akut or the tribe of Akut is in danger, let them
call to Tarzan thus"--and the ape-man raised the hideous
cry with which the tribe of Kerchak had been wont to summon
its absent members in times of peril.
<P>
"And," he continued, "when they hear Tarzan call to them,
let them remember what he has done for Akut and come to him
with great speed.  Shall it be as Tarzan says?"
<P>
"Huh!" assented Akut, and from the members of his tribe
there rose a unanimous "Huh."
<P>
Then, presently, they went to feeding again as though
nothing had happened, and with them fed John Clayton,
Lord Greystoke.
<P>
He noticed, however, that Akut kept always close to him,
and was often looking at him with a strange wonder in his
little bloodshot eyes, and once he did a thing that Tarzan
during all his long years among the apes had never before
seen an ape do--he found a particularly tender morsel and
handed it to Tarzan.
<P>
As the tribe hunted, the glistening body of the ape-man
mingled with the brown, shaggy hides of his companions.  
Oftentimes they brushed together in passing, but the apes
had already taken his presence for granted, so that he was
as much one of them as Akut himself.
<P>
If he came too close to a she with a young baby, the former
would bare her great fighting fangs and growl ominously,
and occasionally a truculent young bull would snarl a warning
if Tarzan approached while the former was eating.  But in
those things the treatment was no different from that which
they accorded any other member of the tribe.
<P>
Tarzan on his part felt very much at home with these fierce,
hairy progenitors of primitive man.  He skipped nimbly out
of reach of each threatening female--for such is the way of
apes, if they be not in one of their occasional fits of bestial
rage--and he growled back at the truculent young bulls, baring
his canine teeth even as they.  Thus easily he fell back into
the way of his early life, nor did it seem that he had
ever tasted association with creatures of his own kind.
<P>
For the better part of a week he roamed the jungle with
his new friends, partly because of a desire for companionship
and partially through a well-laid plan to impress himself
indelibly upon their memories, which at best are none too long;
for Tarzan from past experience knew that it might serve him
in good stead to have a tribe of these powerful and terrible
beasts at his call.
<P>
When he was convinced that he had succeeded to some extent
in fixing his identity upon them he decided to again take up
his exploration.  To this end he set out toward the north
early one day, and, keeping parallel with the shore,
travelled rapidly until almost nightfall.
<P>
When the sun rose the next morning he saw that it lay almost
directly to his right as he stood upon the beach instead
of straight out across the water as heretofore, and so he
reasoned that the shore line had trended toward the west.  
All the second day he continued his rapid course, and when
Tarzan of the Apes sought speed, he passed through the middle
terrace of the forest with the rapidity of a squirrel.
<P>
That night the sun set straight out across the water opposite
the land, and then the ape-man guessed at last the truth that
he had been suspecting.
<P>
Rokoff had set him ashore upon an island.
<P>
He might have known it!  If there was any plan that would
render his position more harrowing he should have known
that such would be the one adopted by the Russian, and what
could be more terrible than to leave him to a lifetime of
suspense upon an uninhabited island?
<P>
Rokoff doubtless had sailed directly to the mainland, where
it would be a comparatively easy thing for him to find the
means of delivering the infant Jack into the hands of the cruel
and savage foster-parents, who, as his note had threatened,
would have the upbringing of the child.
<P>
Tarzan shuddered as he thought of the cruel suffering the
little one must endure in such a life, even though he might
fall into the hands of individuals whose intentions toward
him were of the kindest.  The ape-man had had sufficient
experience with the lower savages of Africa to know that even
there may be found the cruder virtues of charity and humanity;
but their lives were at best but a series of terrible privations,
dangers, and sufferings.
<P>
Then there was the horrid after-fate that awaited the child
as he grew to manhood.  The horrible practices that would
form a part of his life-training would alone be sufficient
to bar him forever from association with those of his own race
and station in life.
<P>
A cannibal!  His little boy a savage man-eater!  It was too
horrible to contemplate.
<P>
The filed teeth, the slit nose, the little face painted hideously.  
Tarzan groaned.  Could he but feel the throat of the Russ fiend
beneath his steel fingers!
<P>
And Jane!
<P>
What tortures of doubt and fear and uncertainty she must
be suffering.  He felt that his position was infinitely less
terrible than hers, for he at least knew that one of his
loved ones was safe at home, while she had no idea of the
whereabouts of either her husband or her son.
<P>
It is well for Tarzan that he did not guess the truth, for the
knowledge would have but added a hundredfold to his suffering.
<P>
As he moved slowly through the jungle his mind absorbed
by his gloomy thoughts, there presently came to his ears a
strange scratching sound which he could not translate.
<P>
Cautiously he moved in the direction from which it emanated,
presently coming upon a huge panther pinned beneath a fallen tree.
<P>
As Tarzan approached, the beast turned, snarling, toward him,
struggling to extricate itself; but one great limb across
its back and the smaller entangling branches pinioning its
legs prevented it from moving but a few inches in any direction.
<P>
The ape-man stood before the helpless cat fitting an arrow
to his bow that he might dispatch the beast that otherwise
must die of starvation; but even as he drew back the shaft a
sudden whim stayed his hand.
<P>
Why rob the poor creature of life and liberty, when it would
be so easy a thing to restore both to it!  He was sure from
the fact that the panther moved all its limbs in its futile
struggle for freedom that its spine was uninjured, and for
the same reason he knew that none of its limbs were broken.
<P>
Relaxing his bowstring, he returned the arrow to the quiver and,
throwing the bow about his shoulder, stepped closer to
the pinioned beast.
<P>
On his lips was the soothing, purring sound that the great
cats themselves made when contented and happy.  It was the
nearest approach to a friendly advance that Tarzan could
make in the language of Sheeta.
<P>
The panther ceased his snarling and eyed the ape-man closely.  
To lift the tree's great weight from the animal it was
necessary to come within reach of those long, strong talons,
and when the tree had been removed the man would be totally
at the mercy of the savage beast; but to Tarzan of the Apes
fear was a thing unknown.
<P>
Having decided, he acted promptly.
<P>
Unhesitatingly, he stepped into the tangle of branches close to the
panther's side, still voicing his friendly and conciliatory purr.
The cat turned his head toward the man, eyeing him steadily--questioningly.
The long fangs were bared, but more in preparedness than threat.
<P>
Tarzan put a broad shoulder beneath the bole of the tree,
and as he did so his bare leg pressed against the cat's silken side,
so close was the man to the great beast.
<P>
Slowly Tarzan extended his giant thews.
<P>
The great tree with its entangling branches rose gradually
from the panther, who, feeling the encumbering weight diminish,
quickly crawled from beneath.  Tarzan let the tree fall back to earth,
and the two beasts turned to look upon one another.
<P>
A grim smile lay upon the ape-man's lips, for he knew that he had
taken his life in his hands to free this savage jungle fellow;
nor would it have surprised him had the cat sprung upon him
the instant that it had been released.
<P>
But it did not do so.  Instead, it stood a few paces from the tree
watching the ape-man clamber out of the maze of fallen branches.
<P>
Once outside, Tarzan was not three paces from the panther.  
He might have taken to the higher branches of the trees
upon the opposite side, for Sheeta cannot climb to the heights
to which the ape-man can go; but something, a spirit of bravado
perhaps, prompted him to approach the panther as though to
discover if any feeling of gratitude would prompt the beast
to friendliness.
<P>
As he approached the mighty cat the creature stepped
warily to one side, and the ape-man brushed past him within
a foot of the dripping jaws, and as he continued on through
the forest the panther followed on behind him, as a hound
follows at heel.
<P>
For a long time Tarzan could not tell whether the beast
was following out of friendly feelings or merely stalking him
against the time he should be hungry; but finally he was
forced to believe that the former incentive it was that
prompted the animal's action.
<P>
Later in the day the scent of a deer sent Tarzan into the trees,
and when he had dropped his noose about the animal's neck he
called to Sheeta, using a purr similar to that which he had
utilized to pacify the brute's suspicions earlier in the day,
but a trifle louder and more shrill.
<P>
It was similar to that which he had heard panthers use after
a kill when they had been hunting in pairs.
<P>
Almost immediately there was a crashing of the underbrush
close at hand, and the long, lithe body of his strange
companion broke into view.
<P>
At sight of the body of Bara and the smell of blood the panther
gave forth a shrill scream, and a moment later two beasts were
feeding side by side upon the tender meat of the deer.
<P>
For several days this strangely assorted pair roamed
the jungle together.
<P>
When one made a kill he called the other,
and thus they fed well and often.
<P>
On one occasion as they were dining upon the carcass of a boar
that Sheeta had dispatched, Numa, the lion, grim and terrible,
broke through the tangled grasses close beside them.
<P>
With an angry, warning roar he sprang forward to chase them
from their kill.  Sheeta bounded into a near-by thicket,
while Tarzan took to the low branches of an overhanging tree.
<P>
Here the ape-man unloosed his grass rope from about his neck, and
as Numa stood above the body of the boar, challenging head erect,
he dropped the sinuous noose about the maned neck,
drawing the stout strands taut with a sudden jerk.  
At the same time he called shrilly to Sheeta, as he drew the
struggling lion upward until only his hind feet touched the ground.
<P>
Quickly he made the rope fast to a stout branch, and as
the panther, in answer to his summons, leaped into sight,
Tarzan dropped to the earth beside the struggling and
infuriated Numa, and with a long sharp knife sprang upon him
at one side even as Sheeta did upon the other.
<P>
The panther tore and rent Numa upon the right, while the
ape-man struck home with his stone knife upon the other,
so that before the mighty clawing of the king of beasts had
succeeded in parting the rope he hung quite dead and harmless
in the noose.
<P>
And then upon the jungle air there rose in unison from two savage
throats the victory cry of the bull-ape and the panther,
blended into one frightful and uncanny scream.
<P>
As the last notes died away in a long-drawn, fearsome wail,
a score of painted warriors, drawing their long war-canoe
upon the beach, halted to stare in the direction of the
jungle and to listen.
<P>
