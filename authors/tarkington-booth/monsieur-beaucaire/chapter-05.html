<p>Beau Nash stood at the door of the rooms, smiling blandly upon
a dainty throng in the pink of its finery and gay furbelows. The
great exquisite bent his body constantly in a series of consummately
adjusted bows: before a great dowager, seeming to sweep the floor
in august deference; somewhat stately to the young bucks; greeting
the wits with gracious friendliness and a twinkle of raillery;
inclining with fatherly gallantry before the beauties; the degree
of his inclination measured the altitude of the recipient as accurately
as a nicely calculated sand-glass measures the hours.</p>

<p>The King of Bath was happy, for wit, beauty, fashion&mdash;to speak
more concretely: nobles, belles, gamesters, beaux, statesmen,
and poets &mdash;made fairyland (or opera bouffe, at least) in his
dominions; play ran higher and higher, and Mr. Nash's coffers
filled up with gold. To crown his pleasure, a prince of the French
blood, the young Comte de Beaujolais, just arrived from Paris,
had reached Bath at noon in state, accompanied by the Marquis
de Mirepoix, the ambassador of Louis <em>XV. </em>The Beau dearly
prized the society of the lofty, and the present visit was an
honor to Bath: hence to the Master of Ceremonies. What was better,
there would be some profitable hours with the cards and dice.
So it was that Mr. Nash smiled never more benignly than on that
bright evening. The rooms rang with the silvery voices of women
and delightful laughter, while the fiddles went merrily, their
melodies chiming sweetly with the joyance of his mood.</p>

<p>The skill and brazen effrontery of the ambassador's scoundrelly
servant in passing himself off for a man of condition formed the
point of departure for every conversation. It was discovered that
there were but three persons present who had not suspected him
from the first; and, by a singular paradox, the most astute of
all proved to be old Mr. Bicksit, the traveler, once a visitor
at Chateaurien; for he, according to report, had by a coup of
diplomacy entrapped the impostor into an admission that there
was no such place. However, like poor Captain Badger, the worthy
old man had held his peace out of regard for the Duke of Winterset.
This nobleman, heretofore secretly disliked, suspected of irregular
devices at play, and never admired, had won admiration and popularity
by his remorse for the mistake, and by the modesty of his attitude
in endeavoring to atone for it, without presuming upon the privilege
of his rank to laugh at the indignation of society; an action
the more praiseworthy because his exposure of the impostor entailed
the disclosure of his own culpability in having stood the villain's
sponsor. To-night, the happy gentleman, with Lady Mary Carlisle
upon his arm, went grandly about the rooms, sowing and reaping
a harvest of smiles. 'Twas said work would be begun at once to
rebuild the Duke's country seat, while several ruined Jews might
be paid out of prison. People gazing on the beauty and the stately
but modest hero by her side, said they would make a noble pair.
She had long been distinguished by his attentions, and he had
come brilliantly out of the episode of the Frenchman, who had
been his only real rival. Wherever they went, there arose a buzz
of pleasing gossip and adulation. Mr. Nash, seeing them near him,
came forward with greetings. A word on the side passed between
the nobleman and the exquisite.</p>

<p>"I had news of the rascal tonight," whispered Nash. "He lay at
a farm till yesterday, when he disappeared; his ruffians, too."</p>

<p>"You have arranged?" asked the Duke.</p>

<p>"Fourteen bailiffs are watching without. He could not come within
gunshot. If they clap eyes on him, they will hustle him to jail,
and his cutthroats shall not avail him a hair's weight. The impertinent
swore he'd be here by nine, did he?"</p>

<p>"He said so; and 'tis a rash dog, sir."</p>

<p>"It is just nine now."</p>

<p>"Send out to see if they have taken him."</p>

<p>"Gladly."</p>

<p>The Beau beckoned an attendant, and whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>Many of the crowd had edged up to the two gentlemen with apparent
carelessness, to overhear their conversation. Those who did overhear
repeated it in covert asides, and this circulating undertone,
confirming a vague rumor that Beaucaire would attempt the entrance
that night, lent a pleasurable color of excitement to the evening.
The French prince, the ambassador, and their suites were announced.
Polite as the assembly was, it was also curious, and there occurred
a mannerly rush to see the newcomers. Lady Mary, already pale,
grew whiter as the throng closed round her; she looked up pathetically
at the Duke, who lost no time in extricating her from the pressure.</p>

<p>"Wait here," he said; "I will fetch you a glass of negus," and
disappeared. He had not thought to bring a chair, and she, looking
about with an increasing faintness and finding none, saw that
she was standing by the door of a small side-room. The crowd swerved
back for the passage of the legate of France, and pressed upon
her. She opened the door, and went in.</p>

<p>The room was empty save for two gentlemen, who were quietly playing
cards at a table. They looked up as she entered. They were M.
Beaucaire and Mr. Molyneux.</p>

<p>She uttered a quick cry and leaned against the wall, her hand
to her breast. Beaucaire, though white and weak, had brought her
a chair before Molyneux could stir.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not touch me!" she said, with such frozen abhorrence in her
voice that he stopped short. "Mr. Molyneux, you seek strange company!"</p>

<p>"Madam," replied Molyneux, bowing deeply, as much to Beaucaire
as to herself, "I am honored by the presence of both of you.</p>

<p>"Oh, are you mad!" she exclaimed, contemptuously.</p>

<p>"This gentleman has exalted me with his confidence, madam," he
replied.</p>

<p>"Will you add your ruin to the scandal of this fellow's presence
here? How he obtained entrance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon, mademoiselle," interrupted Beaucaire. "Did I not say
I should come? M. Molyneux was so obliging as to answer for me
to the fourteen frien's of M. de Winterset and Meestaire Nash."</p>

<p>"Do you not know," she turned vehemently upon Molyneux, "that
he will be removed the moment I leave this room? Do you wish to
be dragged out with him? For your sake, sir, because I have always
thought you a man of heart, I give you a chance to save yourself
from disgrace&mdash;and&mdash;your companion from jail. Let him slip out
by some retired way, and you may give me your arm and we will
enter the next room as if nothing had happened. Come, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Molyneux, I desire to hear nothing from your companion.
Had I not seen you at cards with him I should have supposed him
in attendance as your lackey. Do you desire to take advantage
of my offer, sir?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, I could not tell you, on that night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You may inform your high-born friend, Mr. Molyneux, that I heard
everything he had to say; that my pride once had the pleasure
of listening to his high-born confession!"</p>

<p>"Ah, it is gentle to taunt one with his birth, mademoiselle?
Ah, no! There is a man in my country who say strange things of
that&mdash;that a man is not his father, but himself."</p>

<p>"You may inform your friend, Mr. Molyneux, that he had a chance
to defend himself against accusation; that he said all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I did say all I could have strength to say. Mademoiselle,
you did not see&mdash;as it was right&mdash;that I had been stung by a big
wasp. It was nothing, a scratch; but, mademoiselle, the sky went
round and the moon dance' on the earth. I could not wish that
big wasp to see he had stung me; so I mus' only say what I can
have strength for, and stand straight till he is gone. Beside',
there are other rizzons. Ah, you mus' belief! My Molyneux I sen'
for, and tell him all, because he show courtesy to the yo'ng Frenchman,
and I can trus' him. I trus' you, mademoiselle&mdash;long ago&mdash;and
would have tol' you ev'rything, excep' jus' because&mdash;well, for
the romance, the fon! You belief? It is so clearly so; you do
belief, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>She did not even look at him. M. Beaucaire lifted his hand appealingly
toward her. "Can there be no faith in&mdash;in&mdash;he said timidly, and
paused. She was silent, a statue, my Lady Disdain.</p>

<p>"If you had not belief' me to be an impostor; if I had never
said I was Chateaurien; if I had been jus' that Monsieur Beaucaire
of the story they tol' you, but never with the heart of a lackey,
an hones' man, a man, the man you knew, himself, could you&mdash;would
you&mdash;" He was trying to speak firmly; yet, as he gazed upon her
splendid beauty, he choked slightly, and fumbled in the lace at
his throat with unsteady fingers.&mdash;"Would you&mdash;have let me ride
by your side in the autumn moonlight?" Her glance passed by him
as it might have passed by a footman or a piece of furniture.
He was dressed magnificently, a multitude of orders glittering
on his breast. Her eye took no knowledge of him.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle-I have the honor to ask you: if you had known this
Beaucaire was hones', though of peasant birth, would you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Involuntarily, controlled as her icy presence was, she shuddered.
There was a moment of silence.</p>

<p>"Mr. Molyneux," said Lady Mary, "in spite of your discourtesy
in allowing a servant to address me, I offer you a last chance
to leave this room undisgraced. Will you give me your arm?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, madam," said Mr. Molyneux.</p>

<p>Beaucaire dropped into a chair with his head bent low and his
arm outstretched on the table; his eyes filled slowly in spite
of himself, and two tears rolled down the young man's cheeks.</p>

<p>"An' live men are jus'&mdash;names!" said M. Beaucaire.</p>
