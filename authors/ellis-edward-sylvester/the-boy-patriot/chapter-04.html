<p>Mrs. Robertson and her son were sitting at their pleasant breakfast-table
together.</p>

<p>"Blair," said the mother, "you want to be a patriot. Here is
some work for you to do for your country. We must try to make
a good American citizen out of Hal, and a good Christian at the
same time. The poor fellow is deeply grateful to you, and you
will have a powerful influence over him."</p>

<p>"I can't bear the English," said Blair warmly. "I don't like
any foreigners, for that matter. It don't seem to me they are
the right stuff to make American citizens out of. Give me the
native-born Yankee, free and independent from his cradle upwards.
That's my way of thinking."</p>

<p>Blair stood up as he spoke, and waved his knife in a manner more
emphatic than elegant. A speech, one of his favorite speeches,
seemed imminent. Blair did love to hear himself talk.</p>

<p>"My son, our question in life is not what we <em>like</em>, but
what is <em>duty</em>. I think the laws of the kingdom of heaven
should be the guide to every lover of his country. The voice of
our Saviour is, '<em>Come</em> unto me, all ye that labor and
are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.' 'The Spirit and the
bride say, <em>Come</em>; and let him that heareth say, <em>Come.</em>'
Every true Christian echoes the saying of St. Paul, 'I would to
God that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were
both almost and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.'
So it should be with every favored citizen of our happy land.
We should welcome the oppressed of every clime, and strive to
make them worthy partakers of the blessings we enjoy. I do not
like to hear you say you hate any nation. We are all of one blood,
made in God's image."</p>

<p>"Dear mother," said Blair, "you are right; you are always right.
How thankful I ought to be to have such a guide, and such a help
in keeping my new resolutions. I want to do my duty even when
it is hard for me. You shall see what a friend I will be to Hal.
I mean to go out as soon as I have done breakfast, and see if
I can look him up some steady work. I heard Old Jock say on Saturday
he wanted a strong boy to help him handle his nets. I'll try to
get the place for Hal."</p>

<p>Blair was as prompt to act as to plan. A half hour after breakfast
was over he was standing by the cottage of an old fisherman and
knocking for admittance.</p>

<p>It took all Blair's powers of persuasion to induce Jock to have
any thing to do with what he called a "furriner." The case seemed
well-nigh lost, when Blair mounted on a chair, and made a small
speech in his best style for the benefit of his single auditor.
Whether won over by its logic or through a sense of the honor
thus conferred upon him, Jock agreed to Blair's proposition.</p>

<p>"The first speech I ever made to any purpose," thought Blair,
as he walked rapidly along the shore, wending his way to Mrs.
McKinstry's dwelling.</p>

<p>Hal had locked himself into his "castle," as the only way in
which he could escape the merciless scolding of his voluble hostess.
She seemed to consider every stain on the injured garments a blot
on the shield of the English boy which no apologies could excuse
or efface. Hal fairly fled before the enemy; and once safe in
his own room, whistled so lustily as to drown all sound of the
railing from without.</p>

<p>It was an unusually busy day with Mrs. McKinstry, or it is doubtful
whether she would have allowed even this close to the skirmish,
for she had a taste for such encounters. Blair however heard the
dripping and swashing of water in the rear of the house as he
went up the narrow stairway. The wide cap-border of Mrs. McKinstry
was fanning backwards and forwards, as she bent with a regular
motion over the tub in which her red arms were immersed. She gave
one look at Blair as he went up to her lodger's room, but did
not condescend even to exchange watchwords with him.</p>

<p>In answer to Blair's knock was returned a resolute "Who's there?"</p>

<p>The reply set Hal's mind at ease, and the visitor was promptly
admitted. Blair stated his business at once, but to his surprise
he met with a blank refusal from Hal. He would not fall in with
such a plan, not he. He would keep out of the water while there
was any land left to stand on. He had had enough of plumping to
the bottom, and coming up, ears singing, throat choking, and soul
almost scared out of him. Better a crumb of bread and a morsel
of cheese, than fatness and plenty earned in such a way.</p>

<p>It was hard for Blair to understand the nervous fear of drowning
which had taken possession of poor Hal. Fairport boys could swim
almost as soon as they could walk. They knew nothing of the helpless
feeling of one who has the great deep under him, and is powerless
to struggle in its waves.</p>

<p>But a few short days before, Blair would have pronounced Hal
a coward, and left him in disdain. Now he stood silent for a moment,
baffled and puzzled. "I'll teach you to swim, Hal," he said at
length. "We'll try in shallow water first, where you couldn't
drown, unless you wish to drown yourself. It is easy&mdash;just as
easy as any thing, if you only know how. I'll come for you after
school this evening, and we'll go up the creek, where the boys
wont be about. I shouldn't wonder if you were to take to it like
a fish."</p>

<p>The English boy looked into Blair's frank pleasant face, and
the dogged expression passed from his own. He took Blair's hand
as he said, "I'll try. You shall see what you can make out of
me."</p>

<p>Before many weeks were over, Hal Hutchings was as good a swimmer
as half the boys in Fairport. Old Jock no longer waded into the
deep water to set his nets or push his boat ashore. He declared
that Hal had scared the rheumatism out of his bones, and it was
not likely to make bold to come back, if things went on as they
seemed to promise.</p>
