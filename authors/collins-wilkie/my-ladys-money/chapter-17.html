<P>
EVENTS succeeded each other rapidly, after the memorable day to
Isabel of the luncheon at the farm.
<P>
On the next day (the ninth of the month) Lady Lydiard sent for
her steward, and requested him to explain his conduct in
repeatedly leaving the house without assigning any reason for his
absence. She did not dispute his claims to a freedom of action
which would not be permitted to an ordinary servant. Her
objection to his present course of proceeding related entirely to
the mystery in which it was involved, and to the uncertainty in
which the household was left as to the hour of his return. On
those grounds, she thought herself entitled to an explanation.
Moody's habitual reserve--strengthened, on this occasion, by his
dread of ridicule, if his efforts to serve Isabel ended in
failure--disinclined him to take Lady Lydiard into his
confidence, while his inquiries were still beset with obstacles
and doubts. He respectfully entreated her Ladyship to grant him a
delay of a few weeks before he entered on his explanation. Lady
Lydiard's quick temper resented his request. She told Moody
plainly that he was guilty of an act of presumption in making his
own conditions with his employer. He received the reproof with
exemplary resignation; but he held to his conditions
nevertheless. From that moment the result of the interview was no
longer in doubt. Moody was directed to send in his accounts. The
accounts having been examined, and found to be scrupulously
correct, he declined accepting the balance of salary that was
offered to him. The next day he left Lady Lydiard's service.
<P>
On the tenth of the month her Ladyship received a letter from her
nephew.
<P>
The health of Felix had not improved. He had made up his mind to
go abroad again towards the end of the month. In the meantime, he
had written to his friend in Paris, and he had the pleasure of
forwarding an answer. The letter inclosed announced that the lost
five-hundred-pound note had been made the subject of careful
inquiry in Paris. It had not been traced. The French police
offered to send to London one of their best men, well acquainted
with the English language, if Lady Lydiard was desirous of
employing him. He would be perfectly willing to act with an
English officer in conducting the investigation, should it be
thought necessary. Mr. Troy being consulted as to the expediency
of accepting this proposal, objected to the pecuniary terms
demanded as being extravagantly high. He suggested waiting a
little before any reply was sent to Paris; and he engaged
meanwhile to consult a London solicitor who had great experience
in cases of theft, and whose advice might enable them to dispense
entirely with the services of the French police.
<P>
Being now a free man again, Moody was able to follow his own
inclinations in regard to the instructions which he had received
from Old Sharon.
<P>
The course that had been recommended to him was repellent to the
self-respect and the sense of delicacy which were among the
inbred virtues of Moody's character. He shrank from forcing
himself as a friend on Hardyman's valet: he recoiled from the
idea of tempting the man to steal a specimen of his master's
handwriting. After some consideration, he decided on applying to
the agent who collected the rents at Hardyman's London chambers.
Being an old acquaintance of Moody's, this person would certainly
not hesitate to communicate the address of Hardyman's bankers, if
he knew it. The experiment, tried under these favoring
circumstances, proved perfectly successful. Moody proceeded to
Sharon's lodgings the same day, with the address of the bankers
in his pocketbook. The old vagabond, greatly amused by Moody's
scruples, saw plainly enough that, so long as he wrote the
supposed letter from Hardyman in the third person, it mattered
little what handwriting was employed, seeing that no signature
would be necessary. The letter was at once composed, on the model
which Sharon had already suggested to Moody, and a respectable
messenger (so far as outward appearances went) was employed to
take it to the bank. In half an hour the answer came back. It
added one more to the difficulties which beset the inquiry after
the lost money. No such sum as five hundred pounds had been paid,
within the dates mentioned, to the credit of Hardyman's account.
<P>
Old Sharon was not in the least discomposed by this fresh check.
"Give my love to the dear young lady," he said with his customary
impudence; "and tell her we are one degree nearer to finding the
thief."
<P>
Moody looked at him, doubting whether he was in jest or in
earnest.
<P>
"Must I squeeze a little more information into that thick head of
yours?" asked Sharon. With this question he produced a weekly
newspaper, and pointed to a paragraph which reported, among the
items of sporting news, Hardyman's recent visit to a sale of
horses at a town in the north of France. "We know he didn't pay
the bank-note in to his account," Sharon remarked. "What else did
he do with it? Took it to pay for the horses that he bought in
France! Do you see your way a little plainer now? Very good.
Let's try next if your money holds out. Somebody must cross the
Channel in search of the note. Which of us two is to sit in the
steam-boat with a white basin on his lap? Old Sharon, of course!"
He stopped to count the money still left, out of the sum
deposited by Moody to defray the cost of the inquiry. "All
right!" he went on. "I've got enough to pay my expenses there and
back. Don't stir out of London till you hear from me. I can't
tell how soon I may not want you. If there's any difficulty in
tracing the note, your hand will have to go into your pocket
again. Can't you get the lawyer to join you? Lord! how I should
enjoy squandering _his_ money! It's a downright disgrace to me to
have only got one guinea out of him. I could tear my flesh off my
bones when I think of it."
<P>
The same night Old Sharon started for France, by way of Dover and
Calais.
<P>
Two days elapsed, and brought no news from Moody's agent. On the
third day, he received some information relating to Sharon--not
from the man himself, but in a letter from Isabel Miller.
<P>
"For once, dear Robert," she wrote, "my judgment has turned out
to be sounder than yours. That hateful old man has confirmed my
worst opinion of him. Pray have him punished. Take him before a
magistrate and charge him with cheating you out of your money. I
inclose the sealed letter which he gave me at the farmhouse. The
week's time before I was to open it expired yesterday. Was there
ever anything so impudent and so inhuman? I am too vexed and
angry about the money you have wasted on this old wretch to write
more. Yours, gratefully and affectionately, Isabel."
<P>
The letter in which Old Sharon had undertaken (by way of
pacifying Isabel) to write the name of the thief, contained these
lines:
<P>
"You are a charming girl, my dear; but you still want one thing
to make you perfect--and that is a lesson in patience. I am proud
and happy to teach you. The name of the thief remains, for the
present, Mr. ---- (Blank)."
<P>
From Moody's point of view, there was but one thing to be said of
this: it was just like Old Sharon! Isabel's letter was of
infinitely greater interest to him. He feasted his eyes on the
words above the signature: she signed herself, "Yours gratefully
and affectionately." Did the last words mean that she was really
beginning to be fond of him? After kissing the word, he wrote a
comforting letter to her, in which he pledged himself to keep a
watchful eye on Sharon, and to trust him with no more money until
he had honestly earned it first.
<P>
A week passed. Moody (longing to see Isabel) still waited in vain
for news from France. He had just decided to delay his visit to
South Morden no longer, when the errand-boy employed by Sharon
brought him this message: "The old 'un's at home, and waitin' to
see yer."
