<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was an ideal day for hunting among the mountains. The sun
shone from an unclouded sky, and the air had just enough crispness
to make exercise enjoyable. In short, it was a perfect copy of
that day which saw the V. W. W. start from Fort Steele on their
long ride northward to Bowman's ranch.</p>

<p>The other cowmen would have been glad to join in the hunt, but
they could not be spared from duty. Thus it came about that, as
in the first instance, Hank Hazletine was the guide and only companion
of Jack Dudley and Fred Greenwood on that which was destined to
prove the most memorable hunt of their lives.</p>

<p>The three had ridden briskly through a part of the foot-hills
until they reached the more elevated portion, when the hunter
led the way up a winding trail until, early in the afternoon,
they arrived at what may be called the limit of "horse navigation,"
which is to say their ponies could give them no more help, since
the way was too broken for them to climb further.</p>

<p>Accordingly the three dismounted and removed all the trappings
of the animals. Hazletine was so familiar with the country that
he came to this favored spot without mistake or hesitation. It
was a broad, irregular inclosure, in the form of a grassy plateau,
where grass grew abundantly, and was walled in on nearly every
side by immense rocks and boulders. A tiny stream of icy water
wound along one side, disappearing at a corner among the rocks,
which were so craggy and eccentric in their formation that a cavity
or partial cavern was found, in which the party placed their bridles,
saddles and blankets, and which was capable of giving them shelter
against the most furiously driving rain-storm.</p>

<p>"Surely we couldn't have found a better spot if we had hunted
for a month," said Jack, admiringly surveying their surroundings.</p>

<p>"This is to be our headquarters," explained Hazletine, "during
the few days or the week that we spend in hunting here."</p>

<p>"You mean that we are to spend each night in this place?"</p>

<p>The guide nodded his head.</p>

<p>"I don't know of any better arrangement," said Fred; "we can
gather enough wood to keep a fire going, and, if rain should set
in, shall have as good shelter as if in the house on the ranch."</p>

<p>"That's it; and you mustn't furgit one thing," added Hazletine;
"we fetched along just 'nough stuff fur dinner. We haven't anything
left fur supper. None of the cattle git this fur into the mountains,
so we can't count on them. Therefore, we've the ch'ice atween
shooting game or starving to death."</p>

<p>"That's enough to make us all do our best, but we cannot suffer
so long as we have you for our companion."</p>

<p>"But you ain't going to have me fur your companion."</p>

<p>The boys stared at their friend in astonishment. He explained:</p>

<p>"There ain't much show fur three persons to find game as long
as they stick together. The right way is fur 'em all to part and
each keep it up on his own hook. A chap isn't in half the danger
of being seen by the deer or sheep, or whatever it may be he's
after; and he has the chance, too, to show what stuff he's made
of."</p>

<p>"Then you intend to leave us?"</p>

<p>"You've hit it the first time. I'll start out on my own bus'ness,
meaning to be back here while the night's young."</p>

<p>Observing significant looks passing between the boys, the man
hastened to add:</p>

<p>"Now, don't you folks make the mistake of thinking I'll get your
supper fur you, fur I don't mean to do nothing of the kind. I
don't intend to do any hunting, but to git away from you so as
to let you have the chance. I don't say that if a big horn or
a antelope or buck walks up in front of me and asks me to take
a shy at him that I won't pop him over, though some folks that
I know wouldn't do the same if the buck happened to be a two-legged
one; but such things don't often happen; and, if you don't fetch
in any game, them appetites of your'n are likely to bother you
as much as they did t'other day when we was riding from the fort."</p>

<p>"Do you wish Fred and me to part company?"</p>

<p>Hank's eyes twinkled and a quizzical expression lit up that part
of his countenance which was visible.</p>

<p>"'Twouldn't be safe."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"You'd each take the other fur a wild donkey and plug him afore
you found out the mistake, which the same wouldn't be such a mistake
after all."</p>

<p>The boys could well afford to laugh at the pleasantry of the
man who, it was evident, felt a partiality for them. He added,
more seriously:</p>

<p>"You'd have more show to shoot game if you parted, but I'd not
advise you to do it till after you've hunted for some days together.
It's mighty easy for younkers like you to git lost in these mountains.
You must keep your bearings, so it won't be any trouble fur you
to find your way back to this spot when it's dark. If you happen
to catch sight of any game, try to not let it see you till you
git a fair shot at it; and there ain't much good in wounding a
critter in these parts, fur it's sure to git away from you."</p>

<p>After some further instructions, Hank bade his young friends
good-by and left them. He strode off in the direction of the trail
over which they had come to reach this interesting spot in the
mountains, and disappeared without once looking back to see what
they were doing.</p>

<p>It was odd thus to be left alone in this wild region, and the
chums looked in each other's face with smiles. It certainly was
a curious experience to be set down in one of the greatest mountain
spurs of the West, and to be told that now they must take care
of themselves. It was like being cast into deep water and ordered
to choose between swimming and drowning.</p>

<p>"It's just as well," said Jack, "or he wouldn't have done it.
Surely the V. W. W. ought to be able to take care of ourselves,
with our repeaters and pistols. There's nothing to be feared from
wild animals, or he would have warned us."</p>

<p>"It strikes me that the most important thing to do is to keep
our bearings, for if we should happen to lose our way it would
go hard with us."</p>

<p>"We took care to bring spy-glasses, as well as everything else
that we thought we were likely to need, but forgot about a compass,
which may be worth all the rest."</p>

<p>"Well, we must be careful not to stray too far until we become
familiar with the country. Let's not delay our start."</p>

<p>The plateau where their ponies were cropping the grass was several
acres in extent, nearly half of it sloping abruptly; but the grass
was abundant enough to furnish the animals with all they could
need, no matter how long they stayed, since it had plenty of opportunity
to renew itself.</p>

<p>Side by side the boys moved across the space, the ponies not
raising their heads to look at them, as they passed near. Instead
of following the course taken by their guide they bore to the
right, but at the same time proceeded nearly westward, which led
them deeper into the mountains. Remembering the caution of their
friend they studied the landmarks around them, in the hope of
not losing their way when it should become time to return to camp.</p>

<p>When fairly clear of the plateau, where they must have been at
a considerable elevation above the sea, they found the way so
rough that travelling became a task. There was nothing in the
nature of a path or trail to follow, and they were compelled to
pass around boulders and rocks, sometimes turning back and retracing
their steps, and making long detours, so as to flank impassable
chasms. All this tended to confuse their knowledge of the points
of the compass, but they did not forget to note everything that
could serve as a guide, and were confident of finding their way
whenever it should become necessary to return.</p>

<p>Most of the time Jack Dudley was in the lead, for it was not
easy to walk beside each other. He was perhaps a half-dozen paces
in advance of Fred, when he abruptly stopped with an exclamation
of affright.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked his friend, hardly less startled.</p>

<p>"Look at that!"</p>

<p>He pointed downward, almost at his feet. Still unaware of what
he meant, Fred stepped guardedly forward to his side.</p>

<p>There was good cause, indeed, for the alarm of the elder, for
he had checked himself on the edge of a ravine or canyon fully
a thousand feet deep. One step further and he would have dropped
into eternity.</p>

<p>The peculiar formation of the canyon accounted for this peril.
The chasm was barely a dozen feet wide, but the other side was
depressed, so that it was not noticed by the youth until on the
edge of the danger. The walls were of solid rock, showing the
numerous strata of sandstone and other formations, worn so unevenly
that it looked possible for a person to use them as stairs in
climbing the sides. Pausing on the edge and peering cautiously
down the dizzy steep, the youths could see a stream of water,
winding its course far down at the bottom, where the roughness
of its bed churned it into foam, and gave it the appearance of
a white ribbon that had been strung along the course. The murmur
was so soft and faint that at times they were not sure they heard
it, and when it reached their ears the voice of the distant ocean
was suggested.</p>

<p>A striking feature of this phenomenon was the exceeding narrowness
of the canyon. It has been stated that directly opposite to where
the boys had halted it was scarcely a dozen feet wide, and there
were places in sight with the width still less, though most of
it was greater. The ages that it had taken this stream to erode
such a bed for itself was beyond imagination.</p>

<p>"Jack," said his companion, with that elasticity of spirits natural
to one of his years, "if you had pitched down there, how in the
world could I have pulled you up to the top again?"</p>

<p>"Why would you wish to do that?"</p>

<p>"Well, you would have been pretty well bruised and would have
needed help."</p>

<p>"Possibly; but I wonder whether there are many such pit-holes
in this part of the world. It resembles the fissures in the mountains
of ice which I have read that the Arctic explorers sometimes find."</p>

<p>However, since the youths were on one side of the canyon, naturally
they were seized with the belief that it was necessary immediately
to place themselves on the other side. Why it was so they would
have found hard to explain, but they were unanimous on the point;
and, since there was but the single method of crossing the chasm,
they set out to find it.</p>

<p>"It looks narrower over there to the left," said Jack, turning
in that direction.</p>

<p>He did not have to go far when he paused, where the width was
barely six feet&mdash;not enough to afford much of a leap for sturdy
lads of their years.</p>

<p>"That's easy," added Jack, measuring it with his eye.</p>

<p>"You must remember one thing, Jack. There's something in the
air of this part of the world which makes a mile look no more
than a few hundred yards. Suppose that that other bank is fifty
feet off!"</p>

<p>It was an alarming thought, and Jack recoiled as if again on
the edge of the brink. But he was quick to see the absurdity of
the idea.</p>

<p>"If that is so, then the canyon must be several miles deep. But
we would better make sure."</p>

<p>It was easy to do this. Hunting around until a chip from one
of the boulders was found, Jack tossed it across the abyss. It
fell as he expected, proving that, wonderfully deceptive as is
the atmosphere of the West, it cannot mislead in instances like
that which confronted them.</p>

<p>"That makes it right. I am not afraid to make the leap; are you?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit; but wait."</p>

<p>Near them lay a stone, so large that it required their united
strength to move it. By hard work they rolled it to the edge of
the canyon and tumbled it over, carefully watching its descent.
A curious thing followed. At first it shot straight downward for
a hundred feet, when it impinged against a projecting point of
the mountain wall, knocked the fragments in every direction, as
if it were a ball fired from a thousand-pounder, and bounded against
the opposite side, further down, scattering fragments again. By
this time it had achieved an almost inconceivable momentum, and
was shooting downward at a terrific rate.</p>

<p>In the depths of this narrow canyon, where the sunlight never
penetrated for more than a few minutes at a time, it was always
twilight. At the bottom it was almost dark, so that the stream
would hardly have been visible but for its yeasty foam. At some
point near the base, when the flinty stone was speeding forward
like a meteor, it abraded a harder portion than before. Instantly
a stream of fire shot out, such as sometimes flashes from a murky
cloud in the sky, and, as if it were an echo of the impact, the
splash and thunderous thump were heard by the boys at the top.</p>

<p>It was a tempting theme for the imagination, but they were too
practical to linger. Having agreed that the canyon could be readily
jumped, they did not hesitate. Running a few steps, Jack Dudley
cleared the passage and landed on the other side, with several
feet to spare. He did not take the trouble to toss his rifle in
advance, but kept it in his hand.</p>

<p>"I had a queer feeling," he said, as Fred joined him, "when I
was right over the middle of the canyon, and knew, if I had made
any miscalculation, I should never stop until pretty well down
toward the centre of the earth."</p>

<p>"It doesn't take long to do a deal of thinking at such time,
but what bothered me was whether I was going to make as good a
jump as you. I believe I beat you by two or three inches."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have done it if I had tried. But, Fred, since we
are on this side of that split in the mountain, we have got to
jump it again to get back to camp."</p>

<p>"And we must manage to do it before dark, for it isn't safe to
take chances where there is so much variance in the width."</p>

<p>"Fact of it is," remarked Jack, expressing that which had been
clear to both from the first, "there was no need of our jumping
it at all. But we are here, and must make the best of it. It's
time we found some game."</p>

<p>And Jack looked sharply around, as if he expected to see a fat
deer or big horn step forward and sacrifice himself for their
good.</p>

<p>But they were more fortunate than they were warranted in expecting.
While surveying the rocks and heights which seemed to wall them
in, Fred exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There's our game!"</p>

<p>He pointed to a cliff fully two hundred yards distant, and of
half that height. On this projecting ledge stood a noble buck,
with antlers and head raised, while he seemed to be gazing over
the wild expanse of country below him. They knew he was a fine
animal, though the distance made him appear diminutive.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "On the projecting ledge stood a noble buck."]</p>

<p>"I wonder if he sees us?" said Jack in a whisper, as if afraid
of being overheard.</p>

<p>"If he does, he knows we are too far off to harm him."</p>

<p>The next instant the boys had unslung their glasses and leveled
them at the fellow, who formed a striking picture, as he stood
out in bold relief, with his spreading antlers, his fine head,
and his brown, sinewy limbs. The next remark by Jack may not have
been romantic, but it was characteristic:</p>

<p>"What a fine meal he will make for us!"</p>

<p>"Provided we can secure him. We must get a good deal nearer."</p>

<p>"Our rifles will carry a bullet that far."</p>

<p>"No doubt; but if we hit him he would be only slightly wounded
and would make off. We must go closer."</p>

<p>This necessity was self-evident, but the task was certain to
be a difficult one. As they approached the animal they were likely
to expose themselves to his keen gaze, when he would disappear
on the instant.</p>

<p>"Remember what Hank said. There is twice the chance for one that
there is for two. I'll stay here, Fred, while you go on. If I
see him move I'll try it, and you must do the same. Between us,
we may bring him down."</p>

<p>The plan was acted upon. It was agreed that Fred should steal
as near to the buck as possible, in the hope of securing him,
while Jack should hold himself in readiness to make a shot, with
precious little prospect of success.</p>

<p>If the game would maintain his position it looked as if there
was a good prospect of the younger lad getting within shooting
distance, for the way was so rugged, and offered so many opportunities
for screening his approach, that he did not believe he would be
detected if he used proper care. Meanwhile Jack took position
behind the nearest boulder, where he could keep an eye on the
animal and it was impossible for the latter to see him.</p>

<p>Fred was lost to sight almost immediately. He grew so anxious
as the interval decreased that he trembled, and it was hard to
fight off an attack of what is called "buck fever," and which
is fatal to the best hunter; but by and by his nerves settled,
and he became as cool and self-possessed as Hank Hazletine himself
would have been under the circumstances.</p>

<p>It seemed improbable that the buck would wait where he was, even
if not alarmed, for the time necessary to afford a good shot for
his enemy. It was some whim that had led him out upon the top
of the towering bluff, where he was in view of the young hunters.
It is not to be supposed that his kind appreciate such a thing
as beauty in a landscape or scene spread before them, and yet
the action of the buck almost indicated something of that nature;
for he stood motionless, minute after minute, as if absorbed,
and suggesting a statue carved from the rock itself.</p>

<p>Foot by foot Fred Greenwood stole forward, crouching behind boulders,
creeping beside immense rocks which shut him from the gaze of
the watchful animal, until with a rapidly beating heart he whispered:</p>

<p>"I'm near enough to try a shot."</p>

<p>He was making ready, when he observed a well-screened point a
few rods in advance, which impressed him as the right place. Once
there, he could ask no better opportunity to test his skill. Was
it safe to wait a minute or two longer? Yes, he would make the
attempt.</p>

<p>With infinite care, and holding his nerves in superb control,
he worked his way to the spot without alarming the buck.</p>
