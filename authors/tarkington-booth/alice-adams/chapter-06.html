<p>Alice was busy with herself for two hours after dinner; but a
little before nine o'clock she stood in front of her long mirror,
completed, bright-eyed and solemn. Her hair, exquisitely arranged,
gave all she asked of it; what artificialities in colour she had
used upon her face were only bits of emphasis that made her prettiness
the more distinct; and the dress, not rumpled by her mother's
careful hours of work, was a white cloud of loveliness. Finally
there were two triumphant bouquets of violets, each with the stems
wrapped in tin-foil shrouded by a bow of purple chiffon; and one
bouquet she wore at her waist and the other she carried in her
hand.</p>

<p>Miss Perry, called in by a rapturous mother for the free treat
of a look at this radiance, insisted that Alice was a vision.
"Purely and simply a vision!" she said, meaning that no other
definition whatever would satisfy her. "I never saw anybody look
a vision if she don't look one to-night," the admiring nurse declared.
"Her papa'll think the same I do about it. You see if he doesn't
say she's purely and simply a vision."</p>

<p>Adams did not fulfil the prediction quite literally when Alice
paid a brief visit to his room to "show" him and bid him good-night;
but he chuckled feebly. "Well, well, well!" he said.</p>

<p>"You look mighty fine &mdash;<em>MIGHTY </em>fine!" And he waggled
a bony finger at her two bouquets. "Why, Alice, who's your beau?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind!" she laughed, archly brushing his nose with
the violets in her hand. "He treats me pretty well, doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"Must like to throw his money around! These violets smell mighty
sweet, and they ought to, if they're going to a party with <em>YOU.
</em>Have a good time, dearie."</p>

<p>"I mean to!" she cried; and she repeated this gaily, but with
an emphasis expressing sharp determination as she left him. "I
<em>MEAN </em>to!"</p>

<p>"What was he talking about?" her mother inquired, smoothing the
rather worn and old evening wrap she had placed on Alice's bed.
"What were you telling him you 'mean to?'"</p>

<p>Alice went back to her triple mirror for the last time, then
stood before the long one. "That I mean to have a good time to-night,"
she said; and as she turned from her reflection to the wrap Mrs.
Adams held up for her, "It looks as though I <em>COULD, </em>don't
you think so?"</p>

<p>"You'll just be a queen to-night," her mother whispered in fond
emotion. "You mustn't doubt yourself."</p>

<p>"Well, there's one thing," said Alice. "I think I do look nice
enough to get along without having to dance with that Frank Dowling!
All I ask is for it to happen just once; and if he comes near
me to-night I'm going to treat him the way the other girls do.
Do you suppose Walter's got the taxi out in front?"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he's waiting down in the hall," Mrs. Adams answered, nervously;
and she held up another garment to go over the wrap.</p>

<p>Alice frowned at it. "What's that, mama?"</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's your father's raincoat. I thought you'd put it on
over&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But I won't need it in a taxicab."</p>

<p>"You will to get in and out, and you needn't take it into the
Palmers'. You can leave it in the&mdash;in the &mdash;It's drizzling,
and you'll need it."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," Alice consented; and a few minutes later, as with
Walter's assistance she climbed into the vehicle he had provided,
she better understood her mother's solicitude.</p>

<p>"What on earth IS this, Walter?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Never mind; it'll keep you dry enough with the top up," he returned,
taking his seat beside her. Then for a time, as they went rather
jerkily up the street, she was silent; but finally she repeated
her question: "What IS it, Walter?"</p>

<p>"What's what?"</p>

<p>"This&mdash;this <em>CAR</em>?"</p>

<p>"It's a ottomobile."</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;what kind is it?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you got eyes?"</p>

<p>"It's too dark."</p>

<p>"It's a second-hand tin Lizzie," said Walter. "D'you know what
that means? It means a flivver."</p>

<p>"Yes, Walter."</p>

<p>"Got 'ny 'bjections?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, dear," she said, placatively. "Is it yours, Walter?
Have you bought it?"</p>

<p>"Me?" he laughed. "<em>I</em> couldn't buy a used wheelbarrow.
I rent this sometimes when I'm goin' out among 'em. Costs me seventy-five
cents and the price o' the gas."</p>

<p>"That seems very moderate."</p>

<p>"I guess it is! The feller owes me some money, and this is the
only way I'd ever get it off him."</p>

<p>"Is he a garage-keeper?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly!" Walter uttered husky sounds of amusement. "You'll
be just as happy, I guess, if you don't know who he is," he said.</p>

<p>His tone misgave her; and she said truthfully that she was content
not to know who owned the car. "I joke sometimes about how you
keep things to yourself," she added, "but I really never do pry
in your affairs, Walter."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you don't!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I don't."</p>

<p>"Yes, you're mighty nice and cooing when you got me where you
want me,"  he jeered. "Well, <em>I</em> just as soon tell you
where I get this car."</p>

<p>"I'd just as soon you wouldn't, Walter," she said, hurriedly.
"Please don't."</p>

<p>But Walter meant to tell her. "Why, there's nothin' exactly <em>CRIMINAL
</em>about it," he said. "It belongs to old J. A. Lamb himself.
He keeps it for their coon chauffeur. I rent it from him."</p>

<p>"From Mr. <em>LAMB</em>?"</p>

<p>"No; from the coon chauffeur."</p>

<p>"Walter!" she gasped.</p>

<p>"Sure I do! I can get it any night when the coon isn't goin'
to use it himself. He's drivin' their limousine to-night&mdash;that
little Henrietta Lamb's goin' to the party, no matter if her father
<em>HAS </em>only been dead less'n a year!" He paused, then inquired:
"Well, how d'you like it?"</p>

<p>She did not speak, and he began to be remorseful for having imparted
so much information, though his way of expressing regret was his
own. "Well, you <em>WILL </em>make the folks make me take you
to parties!" he said. "I got to do it the best way I <em>CAN,
</em>don't I?"</p>

<p>Then as she made no response, "Oh, the car's <em>CLEAN </em>enough,"
he said. "This coon, he's as particular as any white man; you
needn't worry about that." And as she still said nothing, he added
gruffly, "I'd of had a better car if I could afforded it. You
needn't get so upset about it."</p>

<p>"I don't understand&mdash;" she said in a low voice&mdash;"I don't understand
how you know such people."</p>

<p>"Such people as who?"</p>

<p>"As&mdash;coloured chauffeurs."</p>

<p>"Oh, look here, now!" he protested, loudly. "Don't you know this
is a democratic country?"</p>

<p>"Not quite that democratic, is it, Walter?"</p>

<p>"The trouble with you," he retorted, "you don't know there's
anybody in town except just this silk-shirt crowd." He paused,
seeming to await a refutation; but as none came, he expressed
himself definitely: "They make me sick."</p>

<p>They were coming near their destination, and the glow of the
big, brightly lighted house was seen before them in the wet night.
Other cars, not like theirs, were approaching this center of brilliance;
long triangles of light near the ground swept through the fine
drizzle; small red tail-lights gleamed again from the moist pavement
of the street; and, through the myriads of little glistening leaves
along the curving driveway, glimpses were caught of lively colours
moving in a white glare as the limousines released their occupants
under the shelter of the porte-cochere.</p>

<p>Alice clutched Walter's arm in a panic; they were just at the
driveway entrance. "Walter, we mustn't go in there."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Leave this awful car outside."</p>

<p>"Why, I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" she insisted, vehemently. "You've got to! Go back!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Glory!"</p>

<p>The little car was between the entrance posts; but Walter backed
it out, avoiding a collision with an impressive machine which
swerved away from them and passed on toward the porte-cochere,
showing a man's face grinning at the window as it went by. "Flivver
runabout got the wrong number!" he said.</p>

<p>"Did he <em>SEE </em>us?" Alice cried.</p>

<p>"Did who see us?"</p>

<p>"Harvey Malone&mdash;in that foreign coupe."</p>

<p>"No; he couldn't tell who we were under this top," Walter assured
her as he brought the little car to a standstill beside the curbstone,
out in the street. "What's it matter if he did, the big fish?"</p>

<p>Alice responded with a loud sigh, and sat still.</p>

<p>"Well, want to go on back?" Walter inquired. "You bet I'm willing!"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what's the matter our drivin' on up to the porte-cochere?
There's room for me to park just the other side of it."</p>

<p>"No, NO!"</p>

<p>"What you expect to do? Sit <em>HERE </em>all night?"</p>

<p>"No, leave the car here."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> don't care where we leave it," he said. "Sit still
till I lock her, so none o' these millionaires around here'll
run off with her." He got out with a padlock and chain; and, having
put these in place, offered Alice his hand. "Come on, if you're
ready."</p>

<p>"Wait," she said, and, divesting herself of the raincoat, handed
it to Walter. "Please leave this with your things in the men's
dressing-room, as if it were an extra one of your own, Walter."</p>

<p>He nodded; she jumped out; and they scurried through the drizzle.</p>

<p>As they reached the porte-cochere she began to laugh airily,
and spoke to the impassive man in livery who stood there. "Joke
on us!" she said, hurrying by him toward the door of the house.
"Our car broke down outside the gate."</p>

<p>The man remained impassive, though he responded with a faint
gleam as Walter, looking back at him, produced for his benefit
a cynical distortion of countenance which offered little confirmation
of Alice's account of things. Then the door was swiftly opened
to the brother and sister; and they came into a marble-floored
hall, where a dozen sleeked young men lounged, smoked cigarettes
and fastened their gloves, as they waited for their ladies. Alice
nodded to one or another of these, and went quickly on, her face
uplifted and smiling; but Walter detained her at the door to which
she hastened.</p>

<p>"Listen here," he said. "I suppose you want me to dance the first
dance with you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"If you please, Walter," she said, meekly.</p>

<p>"How long you goin' to hang around fixin' up in that dressin'-room?"</p>

<p>"I'll be out before you're ready yourself," she promised him;
and kept her word, she was so eager for her good time to begin.
When he came for her, they went down the hall to a corridor opening
upon three great rooms which had been thrown open together, with
the furniture removed and the broad floors waxed. At one end of
the corridor musicians sat in a green grove, and Walter, with
some interest, turned toward these; but his sister, pressing his
arm, impelled him in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" he asked. "That's Jazz Louie and his
half-breed bunch&mdash;three white and four mulatto. Let's&#11834;?"</p>

<p>"No, no," she whispered. "We must speak to Mildred and Mr. and
Mrs. Palmer."</p>

<p>"'Speak' to 'em? I haven't got a thing to say to <em>THOSE </em>berries!"</p>

<p>"Walter, won't you <em>PLEASE </em>behave?"</p>

<p>He seemed to consent, for the moment, at least, and suffered
her to take him down the corridor toward a floral bower where
the hostess stood with her father and mother. Other couples and
groups were moving in the same direction, carrying with them a
hubbub of laughter and fragmentary chatterings; and Alice, smiling
all the time, greeted people on every side of her eagerly&mdash;a little
more eagerly than most of them responded&mdash;while Walter nodded
in a noncommittal manner to one or two, said nothing, and yawned
audibly, the last resource of a person who finds himself nervous
in a false situation. He repeated his yawn and was beginning another
when a convulsive pressure upon his arm made him understand that
he must abandon this method of reassuring himself. They were close
upon the floral bower.</p>

<p>Mildred was giving her hand to one and another of her guests
as rapidly as she could, passing them on to her father and mother,
and at the same time resisting the efforts of three or four detached
bachelors who besought her to give over her duty in favour of
the dance-music just beginning to blare.</p>

<p>She was a large, fair girl, with a kindness of eye somewhat withheld
by an expression of fastidiousness; at first sight of her it was
clear that she would never in her life do anything "incorrect,"
or wear anything "incorrect." But her correctness was of the finer
sort, and had no air of being studied or achieved; conduct would
never offer her a problem to be settled from a book of rules,
for the rules were so deep within her that she was unconscious
of them. And behind this perfection there was an even ampler perfection
of what Mrs. Adams called "background." The big, rich, simple
house was part of it, and Mildred's father and mother were part
of it. They stood beside her, large, serene people, murmuring
graciously and gently inclining their handsome heads as they gave
their hands to the guests; and even the youngest and most ebullient
of these took on a hushed mannerliness with a closer approach
to the bower.</p>

<p>When the opportunity came for Alice and Walter to pass within
this precinct, Alice, going first, leaned forward and whispered
in Mildred's ear. "You <em>DIDN'T </em>wear the maize georgette!
That's what I thought you were going to. But you look simply <em>DARLING!
</em>And those pearls&#11834;"</p>

<p>Others were crowding decorously forward, anxious to be done with
ceremony and get to the dancing; and Mildred did not prolong the
intimacy of Alice's enthusiastic whispering. With a faint accession
of colour and a smile tending somewhat in the direction of rigidity,
she carried Alice's hand immediately onward to Mrs. Palmer's.
Alice's own colour showed a little heightening as she accepted
the suggestion thus implied; nor was that emotional tint in any
wise decreased, a moment later, by an impression that Walter,
in concluding the brief exchange of courtesies between himself
and the stately Mr. Palmer, had again reassured himself with a
yawn.</p>

<p>But she did not speak of it to Walter; she preferred not to confirm
the impression and to leave in her mind a possible doubt that
he had done it. He followed her out upon the waxed floor, said
resignedly: "Well, come on," put his arm about her, and they began
to dance.</p>

<p>Alice danced gracefully and well, but not so well as Walter.
Of all the steps and runs, of all the whimsical turns and twirlings,
of all the rhythmic swayings and dips commanded that season by
such blarings as were the barbaric product, loud and wild, of
the Jazz Louies and their half-breed bunches, the thin and sallow
youth was a master. Upon his face could be seen contempt of the
easy marvels he performed as he moved in swift precision from
one smooth agility to another; and if some too-dainty or jealous
cavalier complained that to be so much a stylist in dancing was
"not quite like a gentleman," at least Walter's style was what
the music called for. No other dancer in the room could be thought
comparable to him. Alice told him so.</p>

<p>"It's wonderful!" she said. "And the mystery is, where you ever
learned to DO it! You never went to dancing-school, but there
isn't a man in the room who can dance half so well. I don't see
why, when you dance like this, you always make such a fuss about
coming to parties."</p>

<p>He sounded his brief laugh, a jeering bark out of one side of
the mouth, and swung her miraculously through a closing space
between two other couples. "You know a lot about what goes on,
don't you? You prob'ly think there's no other place to dance in
this town except these frozen-face joints."</p>

<p>"'Frozen face?'" she echoed, laughing. "Why, everybody's having
a splendid time. Look at them."</p>

<p>"Oh, they holler loud enough," he said. "They do it to make each
other think they're havin' a good time. You don't call that Palmer
family frozen-face berries, I s'pose. No?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. They're just dignified and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yeuh!" said Walter. "They're dignified, 'specially when you
tried to whisper to Mildred to show how IN with her you were,
and she moved you on that way. <em>SHE'S </em>a hot friend, isn't
she!"</p>

<p>"She didn't mean anything by it. She&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Ole Palmer's a hearty, slap you-on-the-back ole berry," Walter
interrupted; adding in a casual tone, "All I'd like, I'd like
to hit him."</p>

<p>"Walter! By the way, you mustn't forget to ask Mildred for a
dance before the evening is over."</p>

<p>"Me?" He produced the lop-sided appearance of his laugh, but
without making it vocal. "You watch me do it!"</p>

<p>"She probably won't have one left, but you must ask her, anyway."</p>

<p>"Why must I?"</p>

<p>"Because, in the first place, you're supposed to, and, in the
second place, she's my most intimate friend."</p>

<p>"Yeuh? Is she? I've heard you pull that 'most-intimate-friend'
stuff often enough about her. What's <em>SHE </em>ever do to show
she is?"</p>

<p>"Never mind. You really must ask her, Walter. I want you to;
and I want you to ask several other girls afterwhile; I'll tell
you who."</p>

<p>"Keep on wanting; it'll do you good."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you really&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Listen!" he said. "I'm just as liable to dance with any of these
fairies as I am to buy a bucket o' rusty tacks and eat 'em. Forget
it! Soon as I get rid of you I'm goin' back to that room where
I left my hat and overcoat and smoke myself to death."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, a little ruefully, as the frenzy of Jazz Louie
and his half-breeds was suddenly abated to silence, "you mustn't&mdash;you
mustn't get rid of me <em>TOO </em>soon, Walter."</p>

<p>They stood near one of the wide doorways, remaining where they
had stopped. Other couples, everywhere, joined one another, forming
vivacious clusters, but none of these groups adopted the brother
and sister, nor did any one appear to be hurrying in Alice's direction
to ask her for the next dance. She looked about her, still maintaining
that jubilance of look and manner she felt so necessary&mdash;for it
is to the girls who are "having a good time" that partners are
attracted&mdash;and, in order to lend greater colour to her impersonation
of a lively belle, she began to chatter loudly, bringing into
play an accompaniment of frolicsome gesture. She brushed Walter's
nose saucily with the bunch of violets in her hand, tapped him
on the shoulder, shook her pretty forefinger in his face, flourished
her arms, kept her shoulders moving, and laughed continuously
as she spoke.</p>

<p>"You <em>NAUGHTY </em>old Walter!" she cried. "<em>AREN'T </em>you
ashamed to be such a wonderful dancer and then only dance with
your own little sister! You could dance on the stage if you wanted
to. Why, you could made your <em>FORTUNE </em>that way! Why don't
you? Wouldn't it be just lovely to have all the rows and rows
of people clapping their hands and shouting, 'Hurrah! Hurrah,
for Walter Adams! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!"</p>

<p>He stood looking at her in stolid pity.</p>

<p>"Cut it out," he said. "You better be givin' some of these berries
the eye so they'll ask you to dance."</p>

<p>She was not to be so easily checked, and laughed loudly, flourishing
her violets in his face again. "You <em>WOULD </em>like it; you
know you would; you needn't pretend! Just think! A whole big audience
shouting, 'Hurrah! <em>HURRAH! HUR</em>&#11834;'"</p>

<p>"The place'll be pulled if you get any noisier," he interrupted,
not ungently. "Besides, I'm no muley cow."</p>

<p>"A '<em>COW?'" </em>she laughed. "What on earth&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I can't eat dead violets," he explained. "So don't keep tryin'
to make me do it."</p>

<p>This had the effect he desired, and subdued her; she abandoned
her unsisterly coquetries, and looked beamingly about her, but
her smile was more mechanical than it had been at first.</p>

<p>At home she had seemed beautiful; but here, where the other girls
competed, things were not as they had been there, with only her
mother and Miss Perry to give contrast. These crowds of other
girls had all done their best, also, to look beautiful, though
not one of them had worked so hard for such a consummation as
Alice had. They did not need to; they did not need to get their
mothers to make old dresses over; they did not need to hunt violets
in the rain.</p>

<p>At home her dress had seemed beautiful; but that was different,
too, where there were dozens of brilliant fabrics, fashioned in
new ways&mdash;some of these new ways startling, which only made the
wearers centers of interest and shocked no one. And Alice remembered
that she had heard a girl say, not long before, "Oh, <em>ORGANDIE!
</em>Nobody wears organdie for evening gowns except in midsummer."
Alice had thought little of this; but as she looked about her
and saw no organdie except her own, she found greater difficulty
in keeping her smile as arch and spontaneous as she wished it.
In fact, it was beginning to make her face ache a little.</p>

<p>Mildred came in from the corridor, heavily attended. She carried
a great bouquet of violets laced with lilies of-the-valley; and
the violets were lusty, big purple things, their stems wrapped
in cloth of gold, with silken cords dependent, ending in long
tassels. She and her convoy passed near the two young Adamses;
and it appeared that one of the convoy besought his hostess to
permit "cutting in"; they were "doing it other places" of late,
he urged; but he was denied and told to console himself by holding
the bouquet, at intervals, until his third of the sixteenth dance
should come. Alice looked dubiously at her own bouquet.</p>

<p>Suddenly she felt that the violets betrayed her; that any one
who looked at them could see how rustic, how innocent of any florist's
craft they were "I can't eat dead violets," Walter said. The little
wild flowers, dying indeed in the warm air, were drooping in a
forlorn mass; and it seemed to her that whoever noticed them would
guess that she had picked them herself. She decided to get rid
of them.</p>

<p>Walter was becoming restive. "Look here!" he said. "Can't you
flag one o' these long-tailed birds to take you on for the next
dance? You came to have a good time; why don't you get busy and
have it? I want to get out and smoke."</p>

<p>"You <em>MUSTN'T </em>leave me, Walter," she whispered, hastily.
"Somebody'll come for me before long, but until they do&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well, couldn't you sit somewhere?"</p>

<p>"No, no! There isn't any one I could sit with."</p>

<p>"Well, why not? Look at those ole dames in the corners. What's
the matter your tyin' up with some o' them for a while?"</p>

<p>"<em>PLEASE, </em>Walter; no!"</p>

<p>In fact, that indomitable smile of hers was the more difficult
to maintain because of these very elders to whom Walter referred.
They were mothers of girls among the dancers, and they were there
to fend and contrive for their offspring; to keep them in countenance
through any trial; to lend them diplomacy in the carrying out
of all enterprises; to be "background" for them; and in these
essentially biological functionings to imitate their own matings
and renew the excitement of their nuptial periods. Older men,
husbands of these ladies and fathers of eligible girls, were also
to be seen, most of them with Mr. Palmer in a billiard-room across
the corridor. Mr. and Mrs. Adams had not been invited. "Of course
papa and mama just barely know Mildred Palmer,"  Alice thought,
"and most of the other girls' fathers and mothers are old friends
of Mr. and Mrs. Palmer, but I do think she might have <em>ASKED
</em>papa and mama, anyway&mdash;she needn't have been afraid just
to ask them; she knew they couldn't come." And her smiling lip
twitched a little threateningly, as she concluded the silent monologue.
"I suppose she thinks I ought to be glad enough she asked Walter!"</p>

<p>Walter was, in fact, rather noticeable. He was not Mildred's
only guest to wear a short coat and to appear without gloves;
but he was singular (at least in his present surroundings) on
account of a kind of coiffuring he favoured, his hair having been
shaped after what seemed a Mongol inspiration. Only upon the top
of the head was actual hair perceived, the rest appearing to be
nudity. And even more than by any difference in mode he was set
apart by his look and manner, in which there seemed to be a brooding,
secretive and jeering superiority and this was most vividly expressed
when he felt called upon for his loud, short, lop-sided laugh.
Whenever he uttered it Alice laughed, too, as loudly as she could,
to cover it.</p>

<p>"Well," he said. "How long we goin' to stand here? My feet are
sproutin' roots."</p>

<p>Alice took his arm, and they began to walk aimlessly through
the rooms, though she tried to look as if they had a definite
destination, keeping her eyes eager and her lips parted;&mdash;people
had called jovially to them from the distance, she meant to imply,
and they were going to join these merry friends. She was still
upon this ghostly errand when a furious outbreak of drums and
saxophones sounded a prelude for the second dance.</p>

<p>Walter danced with her again, but he gave her a warning. "I don't
want to leave you high and dry," he told her, "but I can't stand
it. I got to get somewhere I don't haf' to hurt my eyes with these
berries; I'll go blind if I got to look at any more of 'em. I'm
goin' out to smoke as soon as the music begins the next time,
and you better get fixed for it."</p>

<p>Alice tried to get fixed for it. As they danced she nodded sunnily
to every man whose eye she caught, smiled her smile with the under
lip caught between her teeth; but it was not until the end of
the intermission after the dance that she saw help coming.</p>

<p>Across the room sat the globular lady she had encountered that
morning, and beside the globular lady sat a round-headed, round-bodied
girl; her daughter, at first glance. The family contour was also
as evident a characteristic of the short young man who stood in
front of Mrs. Dowling, engaged with her in a discussion which
was not without evidences of an earnestness almost impassioned.
Like Walter, he was declining to dance a third time with sister;
he wished to go elsewhere.</p>

<p>Alice from a sidelong eye watched the controversy: she saw the
globular young man glance toward her, over his shoulder; whereupon
Mrs. Dowling, following this glance, gave Alice a look of open
fury, became much more vehement in the argument, and even struck
her knee with a round, fat fist for emphasis.</p>

<p>"I'm on my way," said Walter. "There's the music startin' up
again, and I told you&#11834;"</p>

<p>She nodded gratefully. "It's all right&mdash;but come back before
long, Walter."</p>

<p>The globular young man, red with annoyance, had torn himself
from his family and was hastening across the room to her. "C'n
I have this dance?"</p>

<p>"Why, you nice Frank Dowling!" Alice cried. "How lovely!"</p>
