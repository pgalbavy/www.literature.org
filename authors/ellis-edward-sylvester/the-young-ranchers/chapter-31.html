<p>The young ranchers had to go but a short distance, when they
struck the trail left by their friends. The snow rendered it so
distinct that the first glance told the story. Warren saw the
track made by the feet of his father, mother, and little Dot.
The consciousness that he was so near them profoundly affected
the son.</p>

<p>"There are several strange things about this," he remarked to
Tim, halting for a minute before taking up the search in earnest;
"we found it almost impossible for a horse to clamber up the ridge,
and yet their two ponies have been to the very crest."</p>

<p>"That's because they found an easy way to do it from the ither
side," was the sensible comment of Tim Brophy.</p>

<p>"Of course, but father is away off the track. More than half
a day has passed since he left home, and he is hardly a quarter
of the way to Fort Meade."</p>

<p>"He is just as near as we are, and he didn't start any sooner,"
was the significant remark of Tim Brophy.</p>

<p>"But that was his destination when he set out, while our business
has been to find him."</p>

<p>"With no moon or stars to guide him last night, what means had
he of keeping to the right coorse?"</p>

<p>The question gave its own answer. The cause of this wandering
was so self-evident that Warren Starr would not have asked it
had he not been in such a state of mental agitation as a person
feels when certain he is on the eve of some critical event.</p>

<p>Reasoning with something like his usual coolness, the young rancher
thought he saw the explanation of other matters which had puzzled
him, but he bestowed little thought upon them, for his whole ambition
for the time was to reach his parents.</p>

<p>The trail which they were following led toward the open prairie,
left by Warren but a short time before. It was evident that Mr.
Starr was making for that, for their animals could not serve them
so long as they continued in this rough section.</p>

<p>"If I had been a little later," reflected the son, "I would have
met them. That I did not proves that they cannot be far off."</p>

<p>He was tempted to call or whistle, but that would have been rash,
for if there was any one point on which he was certain, it was
that the hostiles were hot on the trail of Tim Brophy. The real
peril was from that direction, and several times he reminded the
Irishman of the fact, though he needed not the warnings.</p>

<p>A short distance farther and both stopped with an exclamation
of dismay. The report of a weapon sounded from a point only a
little way ahead.</p>

<p>"That was not a rifle," said Warren, turning his white face on
his companion; "it was a pistol."</p>

<p>"Ye are corrict."</p>

<p>"And it was fired by father."</p>

<p>"I'm sure ye are right."</p>

<p>"They have been attacked! come on! They need our help!"</p>

<p>The youth dashed ahead, clambering over bowlders, darting around
rocks, ducking his head to avoid the limbs, stumbling, but instantly
regaining his feet, only intent on getting forward with the utmost
possible speed.</p>

<p>His companion found it hard work to keep up with him, but fortunately
they had not far to run. Without the least warning of what was
coming Warren Starr burst upon his astonished parents and little
Dot, the rush being so impetuous that the rancher had his Winchester
half raised to fire before he understood.</p>

<p>At the feet of Mr. Starr lay the mare dead, killed by her master.
While struggling over the rugged places she had slipped and broken
her leg. The rancher mercifully put her out of her misery by placing
the muzzle of his revolver to her forehead and sending a bullet
through her brain.</p>

<p>Mrs. Starr and Dot had turned away that they might not witness
the painful sight, for they loved the creature. The arrival of
the youths caused the mother to face quickly about, and the next
moment she and her son were clasped in each other's arms, with
Dot tugging at the coat of her big brother.</p>

<p>"Warren, Warren, I guess you forgot me," she pleaded, when she
thought the embrace had lasted long enough.</p>

<p>"Forget you, my darling!" he repeated, catching her up and hugging
the breath from her body; "never! we are together again, and only
death shall separate us."</p>

<p>The rancher had shaken the hand of Tim Brophy during this little
by-play, and they exchanged a few words before father and son
closed palms.</p>

<p>Then the questions and answers came fast. Tim Brophy drew a little
aside to where mother and child stood, and holding the tiny hand
of Dot explained matters, while Warren did the same with his father.</p>

<p>"Did you see us approaching when you started the fire?" asked
Warren, after hurriedly telling his own story.</p>

<p>"No, but I was quite sure, when your mother and I came to talk
it over, that you would disregard my wishes about hurrying to
the fort. We went astray in the darkness, and after a number of
narrow escapes, as I have just related, found ourselves at the
base of this ridge on the other side."</p>

<p>"Did you recognize where you were?"</p>

<p>"No; the points of the compass were all askew, and to save my
life I couldn't get my bearings. But I was convinced that you
were at no great distance, and decided to try the signal which
Plummer and I had used before. Poor Plummer!"</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about him?"</p>

<p>Mr. Starr related what he had discovered, adding that the body
was shockingly mutilated and stripped of its belongings.</p>

<p>"The ascent of the ridge on the other side was quite easy, and
we found no difficulty in leading the horses to the crest. There
the fire was kindled. Knowing of the long stretch of level ground
on this side, we set out without waiting to learn the result of
the signal smoke. I knew that if you made your way to the spot
where it was burning you would understand the situation, and the
snow would show you how to follow us as fast as you desired."</p>

<p>"Did you hear or see nothing of the Indians?"</p>

<p>"We saw nothing of them, and were confident that the party with
whom we had repeated encounters were thrown so far behind that
we had good reason to believe they need be feared no longer. But
all our hopes were scattered when we heard firing from the direction
of the open plain. While fleeing from one party of hostiles we
had almost run into another. I confess," added the father, "that
for a minute I was in despair. Your mother, however, retained
her courage, as she has from the first. She urged me to make for
the level country, aiming for a point so far removed from the
sounds of the guns that we would not be seen, unless some ill
fortune overtook us. My haste in striving to do so caused the
mare to fall and break her leg. I could not bear the sight of
her suffering, and though I knew the danger of the act, I put
her out of her misery with a pistol-ball through her brain."</p>

<p>"You little dreamed that Tim and I had a part in the firing of
those guns which so alarmed you."</p>

<p>"No; it did not occur to me; but we must not make the mistake
of supposing we are yet out of danger."</p>

<p>The experiences that had been hastily exchanged awakened the
ranchers to the fact that they were still in imminent peril, for
the Sioux were certain to follow Tim Brophy vigorously, and at
that moment could not be far off.</p>

<p>Mr. Starr beckoned to his wife and Tim to approach.</p>

<p>"You understand matters," he said, "and the question is, what
is best to do?"</p>

<p>"Why not continue our flight?" asked the wife.</p>

<p>"I would not hesitate a second were we not so fearfully handicapped.
There are four of us, not counting Dot, and we have but two animals,
provided Warren's pony can be found, which I very much doubt.
True, we men can walk or take turns in riding, but if we continue
our flight, speed is indispensable, and we would make a sorry
show in our crippled condition. We would be absolutely helpless
on the open prairie against the Sioux, all of whom, Warren tells
me, have excellent horses."</p>

<p>The rancher had a scheme in his mind, but before making it known
he wished the views of the others.</p>

<p>"It's mesilf that thinks this," said Tim Brophy; "let us go wid
yees to the ridge of the prairie, and there mount Mr. Starr on
Jack, while Mrs. Starr and Dot can take the ither. Thin, what
is to hinder yees from going like a house afire for the foort?"</p>

<p>"But what of you and Warren?" was the natural question of the
rancher.</p>

<p>"We'll cover yer retr'at."</p>

<p>"The proposal does more credit to your heart than your head,
but I cannot entertain it."</p>

<p>"Nor will I listen to anything which compels us to separate again,"
added the son decisively. "I do not believe you can reach Fort
Meade without another fight, and the absence of Tim and me would
destroy hope from the first."</p>

<p>"But my idea," persisted the Irishman, "was to keep the fight
away from the folks and have all the fun oursilves."</p>

<p>"That would do if it were possible to arrange the business that
way," said Warren, "but the Sioux are the ones who have the decision
in their hands, and while we were doing our best others would
slip off and attack father and mother. If we remain together it
must be otherwise. If there ever was a situation where union is
strength this is one of them."</p>

<p>"I've exhausted me resoorces," said Tim, withdrawing a step,
as though he had nothing more to say. Leaving the others to decide,
he took Warren's Winchester from his unresisting hand, and began
watching for the approach of the Sioux, who he was certain were
following the trail through the snow.</p>

<p>One fact was apparent to him, and he considered it no unimportant
advantage. The pursuers would advance at a speed that must bring
them into sight before they could surprise the fugitives.</p>

<p>A glance around showed that the rancher could not have selected
a better place for defence. The bowlders were on all sides, there
being a natural amphitheatre several rods in extent. Kneeling
behind these the whites had a secure protection against their
enemies, unless they should make an overwhelming rush&mdash;a course
of action which is never popular with the American Indian, inasmuch
as it involves much personal risk to the assailants.</p>

<p>It was at his suggestion that the others seated themselves on
the ground while holding their conference. When the Sioux should
appear it would be on the trail made by the party, so that the
Irishman knew where to look for them. He, too, crouched down,
with the muzzle of the Winchester pointed between two of the bowlders,
ready to fire on the first glimpse of a target.</p>

<p>Even the pony was forced to lie down near the lifeless body of
his comrade. So it was that anyone might have passed near the
irregular circle of bowlders without a suspicion of who were within
it.</p>

<p>"I have but the one proposition to make," said Warren, seeing
that his father was waiting for him to speak, "and that is to
stay here and fight it out. We are strong enough to hold the Sioux
at bay for a good while, perhaps long enough to discourage them."</p>

<p>"And what have you to say, Molly?"</p>

<p>"I cannot feel as hopeful as Warren, but it really seems to me
that that is the only recourse left to us."</p>

<p>"I do not agree with either of you," remarked the rancher, feeling
that the time had come to announce his decision. "I formed my
plan some minutes ago. It is the only one that offers the slightest
hope, and I shall insist on its fulfilment to the letter. It is
that Warren shall leave at once, find his pony if he can, mount
him, and ride with all haste to the fort for assistance. Tim will
stay behind with us to help fight. The time for discussion is
past; we must act. Warren, make ready to leave this minute."</p>
