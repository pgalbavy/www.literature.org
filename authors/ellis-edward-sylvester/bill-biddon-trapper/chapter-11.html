<p>After bidding Imogene good-by, I started on a rapid pace to the
northward. At night I kindled a fire by which I slept in safety,
and at an early hour resumed my journey. The character of the
country continued much the same&mdash;broad belts of prairie relieved
by groves of trees and streams of considerable magnitude. Birds
of all kinds whirred through the air and sang within the wood,
and the dark forms of wild animals were more than once seen gamboling
in the distance.</p>

<p>At noon I reached the banks of a river, so large that I was pretty
certain it was the Yellowstone, and hence was able to judge pretty
correctly of my locality. The river was very broad, and it was
quite a serious undertaking to cross it; but, nevertheless, it
had to be done, and I commenced making my preparations.</p>

<p>As I was stepping in, a sound of voices struck me. I paused and
listened, and soon could hear the loud, regular swelling song
gradually approaching nearer and nearer, and at stated intervals
the powerful chorus. There was something in the sound of this
song, at such a time, that was indescribably stirring and inspiriting;
and, as it came nigher and nigher, and grew louder, its power
increased. Hardly satisfied of the nature of the approaching body,
I withdrew a short distance, and waited its appearance. Soon a
large canoe, nearly full of men, came to view around a bend some
hundred yards distant, and it was instantly followed by another
and another, all keeping time to the words of the song:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
We are going with the tide,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yoho! yoho!<br/>
Free as the mountain-winds we glide,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yoho! yoho!<br/>
Oh! ours is a merry life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yoho! yoho!<br/>
And full of danger, toil, and strife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yoho! yoho!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then join your voices<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the glad refrain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the mountains<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echo back the strain.

</p>
</div>
<p>As over a score of majestic voices joined in the deep swelling
chorus, the echoes were awakened for miles around. I watched them
in wonder and admiration. Soon, to my surprise, they made toward
the shore where I stood. As it was noon, they were probably putting
in for their dinner. In a moment the boats were hauled up on the
bank, and as rough and hardy a set of fellows as ever met, sprang
upon the shore. A half dozen scattered along the bank, and in
a moment returned bearing armfuls of sticks and fuel. A huge fire
was soon blazing and roaring, an enormous quantity of meat steaming
and spitting, and the men, excepting the cook, were lolling about
on the grass, each one smoking and chatting, and making a scene
of pleasant confusion and enjoyment.</p>

<p>I now stepped forth from my concealment. Several turned their
faces toward me as I passed them, but no unusual amount of astonishment
was manifested. I made my way to a group of three, and seated
myself beside them.</p>

<p>"Whar’d you come from?" asked a short, gruff-looking man.</p>

<p>"No place in particular, at present," I replied, pleasantly.</p>

<p>"One of them Nor’west chaps, I s’pose?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I am no trapper at all, but a mere adventurer in these
parts."</p>

<p>"Pooty story to tell them as will believe it," he retorted, angrily.</p>

<p>"I am sure it is immaterial with me whether you believe it or
not. If I were a member of the Northwest Fur Company, I should
not be ashamed or afraid to own it, as I believe that is as respectable
and honorable as the one in whose service you are."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "A fight! a fight! make a ring for them."]</p>

<p>"Boys! do you hear that?" called out a fellow beside me. "Yer’s
one of them sneaking chaps&mdash;a Nor’wester, and he’s insulted us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Beg your pardon, sir," I interrupted; "I did no such thing."</p>

<p>"Do you hear that, I say?" he called out, without regarding my
words. "Here’s a sneaking Nor’wester cracking up his party afore
us."</p>

<p>I was so provoked that I made no reply or noticed him. His words
attracted their attention, and, anxious to see the trouble, they
gathered round.</p>

<p>"What’s up?" demanded a stumpy fellow, pushing his head in between
the others.</p>

<p>"A fight! a fight!"</p>

<p>"Make a ring for ’em."</p>

<p>"Blow me, if he don’t look like one o’ them Nor’westers as sent
Governor Semple out the world.[6] Go in, Tom!"</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
[6] In an affray between two parties, belonging respectively to<br/>
the Hudson Bay and Northwest Fur Companies, the leader of the<br/>
former, Mr. Semple, was shot by a member of the latter. This<br/>
happened some years before the date of our story, but for a long<br/>
time there was ill-feeling and frequent encounters between the<br/>
members of the companies.

</p>
</div>
<p>"I’ll maul him as soon as I get in fightin’ order," said Tom&mdash;he
of my first acquaintance.</p>

<p>Matters were now getting serious. A collision between the redoubtable
Tom and myself seemed unavoidable. His impudent bravado and insults
had roused me somewhat, and I made up my mind that I should withdraw
nothing I had uttered, and bear none of his insolence.</p>

<p>"What’s the row?" demanded another; "I don’t understand it."</p>

<p>"Why, here’s a sneakin’ Nor’wester," answered Tom, "blowin’ ’bout
things, and I’ve made up my mind I won’t stand it;" and he continued
his war-like preparations.</p>

<p>"That’s right, Tom, go in and win," added several voices.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said I, "all I ask is that you shall understand
this matter and show fair play&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We’ll do that, you!" interrupted several.</p>

<p>"In the first place," I continued, "I have said nothing against
the company in whose service you are. This man, whom you call
Tom, accused me of being a member of a rival company; I replied
I was not, although I should not be ashamed if such were the case,
as I considered the latter as respectable as yours. He avers,
however, I have insulted you, and seems determined to avenge it,
and I am perfectly willing to gratify him. As I told him, I am
not in the service of any company, but am a mere adventurer in
these parts. With this explanation I am now ready for any proceeding
he may wish."</p>

<p>"Smash me to nuthin’, ram me down and shoot me, if thar ain’t
Jarsey, or I’m a sinner!" exclaimed a familiar voice, and the
same instant Bill Biddon stepped into the ring before me. "Give
us your paw, Jarsey."</p>

<p>He grasped my hand and gave a vigorous gripe, while his scarred
countenance was dissolved in one great broad smile. It is needless
to say I was delighted beyond measure at this unexpected meeting.</p>

<p>"Why, Bill, I little thought to meet you here."</p>

<p>"And yer’s as what thinks Bill didn’t think so himself."</p>

<p>During this passage of words between us, the others stood wondering
and perplexed. The honest old trapper turned, and seeing Tom standing
with his fists still clinched, shouted:</p>

<p>"Ef you say another word to that gentleman thar, as is worth
forty like you, there’ll be only a grease-spot left of you. Do
you hear, eh?" and he shook his ponderous fist beneath his nose.</p>

<p>The fellow did hear, and with a muttering, "It’s cu’rous, I allow,"
donned his coat with the most perfect meekness.</p>

<p>"Now," said Biddon facing the rest, "if thar are any ’bout yer
as wants to take up this fout, why jist step forward and get lammed."</p>

<p>"Is he a Nor’wester?" asked one, breaking the perfect silence.</p>

<p>"What you want to know fur?"</p>

<p>"’Cause if he is, he can’t pass this crowd without swallerin’
them words."</p>

<p>"What words?" demanded Biddon, fiercely.</p>

<p>"What Tom said he said."</p>

<p>"Have I not explained&mdash;" I commenced.</p>

<p>"Now jist hold on, Jarsey," interrupted the trapper, turning
toward me with a backward wave of his hand. "Now, hold on, you,
fur ef you take back anything you’ve said, shoot me, ef <em>I</em>
don’t lick you. Ogh!" Then turning to the others he continued,
"He ain’t goin’ to take back nothin’ he’s said yerabouts; and
ef Tom Wilson thar don’t swaller what <em>he</em> said, yer’s
as will make him do it."</p>

<p>"I mought’ve be mistaken," said the now thoroughly-frightened
Tom.</p>

<p>"That won’t do."</p>

<p>"Wal, he didn’t say so," he jerked out.</p>

<p>"That’ll answer. S’posen I say he is a Nor’-wester, how ’bout
that?" demanded Biddon, glaring about on the rest.</p>

<p>There was no response. All was still as death.</p>

<p>"Wal, boys," added Bill, returning to his good nature, "he <em>ain’t</em>
a trapper; never took a skin in his born days; is a parfect gentleman,
and I’ll make you ’quainted with Bill Relmond, from the States,
or, as I call him, Jarsey, as fine a chap as ever tramped these
parts."</p>

<p>The scene that followed was singular and amusing. All crowded
around me, smiling and talking and shaking hands; and the first
hand I grasped was Tom Wilson’s.</p>

<p>"Hope you won’t mind what I said;" he spoke in a lower tone,
"I orter been lammed for it, sure."</p>

<p>"Don’t refer to it," I laughed; "I suppose you were only anxious
for a little amusement to pass away time."</p>

<p>"That’s it ’zactly, Jarsey, you’re a trump."</p>

<p>"It’s my private opine," called out Biddon, "that this coon is
goin’ inter these eatables, and ef you wants a bite, Jarsey, you’d
better jine."</p>

<p>All now crowded around the meal-pot, and commenced devouring
its contents with the avidity of wild animals. It consisted mainly
of pemmican (dried buffalo flesh), a food much in vogue in the
northwest, with several biscuits and some scalding tea. The meal
finished, the men instantly produced their pipes, which they indulged
in for ten or fifteen minutes. The boats were then shoved into
the water, the cooking-utensils placed on board, and preparations
made for starting.</p>

<p>"Whar you bound to?" asked Biddon, just as they were ready.</p>

<p>"The Blackfeet-Sioux," I answered, unable to repress a smile.</p>

<p>"The Blackfeet-Sioux?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes; do you know their grounds?"</p>

<p>"I’s ’bout twenty miles down-stream&mdash;that is the village. We
cac’late to camp thereabouts to-night. What, in the name of beavers,
do you want with them?"</p>

<p>"I’ll explain matters when we have a better opportunity," I answered.</p>

<p>"Jump in with me then, an’ I’ll git Tom Wilson to rest a while,
and we’ll talk over matters and things."</p>

<p>I sprang into the boat, and the brigade was soon under way. The
Yellowstone, being broad and deep and the current quite powerful,
the work was comparatively light. The song was again taken up
by the <em>voyageurs</em>, all joining in the chorus and keeping
time with the measured dip of their paddles. I seated myself in
the stern, beside the steersman, who I found to be a clerk in
the Hudson Bay Company, and a gentleman.</p>

<p>"How long will you remain with us, Mr. Relmond?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Only until night."</p>

<p>"I was in hopes you would accompany us to the settlement."</p>

<p>"I should be glad to do so, but circumstances forbid."</p>

<p>"It was quite fortunate," he smiled, "that you and Biddon were
acquainted. He is a noble fellow."</p>

<p>"Most assuredly he is. I accompanied him, as a seeker of adventures,
last summer from Independence, and we separated in the autumn,
while in the wilderness. I was considerably surprised to find
him in your service."</p>

<p>"He had a misunderstanding with his employers, I believe. He
had a dispute with one of their agents, and gave him a severe
pounding. He was reproved rather sharply for this and left the
company in disgust. This was during the winter. Shortly after
he visited Red River settlement, and volunteered his services,
and they were gladly accepted, as his skill was known to many."</p>

<p>"He has been then but a short time with you."</p>

<p>"Only a few weeks&mdash;but long enough to let us know the value of
his services. This brigade is all owing to him."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"You are aware we are now in the United States territory. It
is not often that we extend our work into it, except in Oregon,
which has lately fallen into the hands of the Americans. Biddon
had engaged a large quantity of furs of the Indians in the neighborhood,
intending them for one of their fur companies, but after his dispute
he offered them to us, and this brigade was dispatched for the
purpose of collecting them. He will find there is quite a pile
of money due him at York fort when he arrives there."</p>

<p>Further time was spent in conversation with the clerks when I
noticed a person had taken Biddon’s place at the oars. The trapper
motioned me beside him, and seating ourselves in the opposite
end of the boat he said:</p>

<p>"Now we’ll have a talk, Jarsey, ogh!"</p>

<p>"The first thing to be knowed," said Biddon, "is how in the name
of human natur you come in these parts. How war it, Jarsey?"</p>

<p>"You must remember, Biddon, I’ve been a prisoner for the last
six months."</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear nothin’ of Greeny?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a rumor reached me that he was living with a tribe of Indians
to the east of us."</p>

<p>"Altogether onpossible," answered the trapper, with a shake of
his head.</p>

<p>"Why is it impossible?"</p>

<p>"He’s had his ha’r raised sure, and never seed the next day arter
we seed the last on him."</p>

<p>"I am more hopeful than you are. Recollect <em>I</em> have been
a captive and am now here without bodily harm."</p>

<p>"It’s qua’r, I allow, how you come out, as you did. The reds
down in them parts are ramparageous, and if it hadn’t been for
that Jim, you spoke about, and that gal, you’d a gone under sure.
I’s tuck once by them same chaps one time. Me an’ Snapper Jack
was sat on one dark night in an awful snowstorm by a hundred on
’em. They blazed right into us, and Jack rolled over with a pound
of lead in him and never said a word. I’s purty well riddled in
my lower story, but I tuk through and got off with my ha’r, while
Jack never knowed who tuk his. They cac’lated on toastin’ you
up brown, and would ef it want fur that gal, as I’s sayin’ while
he’s had it all."</p>

<p>"I cannot yet see, Biddon, why there is not a probability of
Nat’s being alive. The Indians in these parts are on friendly
intercourse with the traders, and it is in this region, if anywhere,
that he will be found."</p>

<p>"I don’t b’lieve he’s about. They got him down thar, and he got
it down thar, <em>sure</em>."</p>

<p>These words of the trapper dampened my expectations greatly.
Much of the joy of my hope was that I expected to again grasp
the hand of my old friend, and the thought that he had long been
dead made me sad and gloomy. However, I was not ready to give
up all hope, and determined that I should be satisfied of his
fate before I returned to the States.</p>

<p>The brigade proceeded regularly and rapidly down the Yellowstone,
until the sun sinking in the west, warned them that night was
at hand. The steersman informed me they should not be able to
reach the Indian village that night, but would early the next
day. Just as the shadows were blending with the darkness on the
river banks, the brigade ran into shore for the night’s encampment.
There was a dense forest on either side of us, which rendered
our situation dark and gloomy; but this was soon dispelled by
the jolly <em>voyageurs</em>. Fuel was collected, and a great
roaring fire crackled and blazed cheerily around us; and the men
passing to and fro, chatting and joking, the confusion of preparations
for supper, made a scene well calculated to dispel all gloomy
reveries. The three boats were hauled up on the banks, turned
over, and their contents scattered among the owners, and all gathered
around the hearty evening meal. These hardy fellows after the
laborious day’s work, their appetites sharpened, and healthy truly,</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Ate like horses, when you hear them eat."

</p>
</div>
<p>The meal finished, the indispensable pipes were in requisition.
Three or four huge fires were kindled, around which the men lazily
stretched themselves, to while away the hour that must elapse
ere they "turned in" for the night. The brigade included men in
it, who had trapped and hunted the shores of the Frozen Sea to
the plains of the Kansas, and from Labrador to the mouth of the
Columbia, beyond the Rocky Mountains. They had encountered every
imaginable foe: the intense cold and the polar bear of the far
North, and the innumerable hordes of savages of the more temperate
regions; and now they recounted their thrilling reminiscences
to each other, and speculated upon the fate still in store for
them. The hour passed rapidly, and ere I was aware, the <em>voyageurs</em>
were gathering their blankets around them for the night’s rest.</p>

<p>"Come, bundle up, Jarsey," said Biddon, "for thar’ll be no time
to snooze in the daylight."</p>

<p>The men were stretched at every point around the fire, their
feet being toward it, their heads radiating outward, so that the
three groups resembled the same number of immense wheels. As most
of the places were occupied, I lay a little beyond the circle,
within a foot or two of Biddon. The fires now smoldered, and the
heavy darkness again settled over wood and river. Nothing disturbed
the deep silence save the faint flow of the Yellowstone, or the
dull noise of an ember as it broke apart, and now and then the
distant wail of some wild animal. But a short time elapsed ere
I joined the rest in the land of dreams.</p>

<p>The night passed away without any event worthy of note; and the
first apprisal I had of the approach of day, was by hearing loud
cries of "Léve! léve! léve!"[7] uttered by numerous voices.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
[7] Arouse, or get up.

</p>
</div>
<p>Starting up, I saw the <em>voyageurs</em> were all astir, and
making ready to embark. The boats were launched, and being too
early for breakfast, the men sprang in and seized the oars.</p>

<p>"When we halt for breakfast," said the steersman, "it will be
at the Indian village, which I understand is your destination."</p>

<p>With the same inspiring song of yesterday, the men bent to their
oars, and the boats shot rapidly through the foaming water. In
the course of an hour or more, the brigade put in for breakfast,
and the same bustling scene that had taken place the night before
was re-enacted.</p>

<p>The place chosen was a broad, open plot of grass, reaching down
to the water’s edge, and extending some hundred feet back, when
the edge of the forest was reached. No signs of Indians were seen,
and I was somewhat puzzled to know how it was known they were
in the vicinity. The clerk mentioned before, explained to me that
Biddon had described the halting spot, and the distance so accurately,
that there could be no mistake, and the savages would soon make
their appearance.</p>

<p>We had scarcely spoken, when a movement was heard in the forest,
and several Indians made their appearance. They seemed to understand
the meaning of the brigade; for, directly behind them came numbers
of others bearing loads of peltries&mdash;the furs of beavers, foxes,
badgers, lynxes, martens, otters, and wolverines. A barter at
once commenced, and in less than half an hour the whole array
was deposited in the boats, and the Indians were proudly parading
in the gaudy trinkets and dresses which had just fallen to their
lot.</p>

<p>"Where is their village?" I asked of Biddon.</p>

<p>"A mile or so back in the woods; you can’t miss it."</p>

<p>"I can remain here without danger, can I not?"</p>

<p>"Yas, I guess so&mdash;hold on, I’ll fix it for you."</p>

<p>With this he strode rapidly toward a man who appeared to be the
chief, and commenced a conversation. He understood the Sioux tongue
well enough to hold quite an intelligible conversation. The talk
lasted but a moment, when he returned.</p>

<p>"You needn’t be skeerish," said he; "I’ve made it all right.
I told that old chap you wanted to take a look at the country
hereabouts, to skeer up some furs fur us agin. He was a little
s’pishus at fust, shoot me ef he warn’t! and he axed ef you wanted
to run off with that gal o’ theirs, ’cause ef you war, you’d better
leave yer ha’r behind you. There’s been two or three round these
parts after her, and he won’t stand it no longer. You’ve got to
be mighty shy, Jarsey, I kin tell yer; but I hope you’ll git her
fur all that, ogh!"</p>

<p>"I am grateful to you for this kindness, Biddon&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Never mind ’bout that; come to the pint ef you’ve got anything
to say."</p>

<p>"I had nothing except to express my thanks, which you seem averse
to receiving."</p>

<p>"It does go again my stummick, I allow, Jarsey; when you come
the squaw over me, I can’t stand it. Yer’s as likes to talk fair
and squar, and leave the rest. Shoot me ef I doesn’t! Wal I does,
ogh!"</p>

<p>"I suppose the time has come for us to separate, then, Biddon?"</p>

<p>"Leastways it’s close at hand. Think you’d better go up to Selkirk
settlement with us; don’t s’pose you will; think you’re a fool,
shoot me ef I don’t, ogh!"</p>

<p>"It seems our separation is to be something like it was before,"
I laughed. "I believe you had a small opinion of my abilities
at that time."</p>

<p>"Wal, yer’s as hopes you’ll come out right side up this time.
In course I’ll have a glimpse of that ugly face of your’n agin.
In course."</p>

<p>"I don’t know about that. As you have gone into the service of
the Hudson Bay Company, your sphere of action will be far removed
from mine, and it will be an occurrence which I cannot imagine
at this time that will bring us together."</p>

<p>"That ain’t so sartin," said the trapper, in a low, confidential
tone. "I rather opine I’ll be down in Westport or Independence
this fall, and ef these fellows cac’lates on keepin’ me around,
they’ve got to step round ’emselves. Shoot me if they hain’t,
ogh!"</p>

<p>"I hope you will not spend your life in the dreary region north
of this, for it will indeed be a dreary, lonely life for you."</p>

<p>"Wal, you see, Jarsey," he continued, with a shade of feeling,
"it don’t make much difference whar I traps. Yer’s as s’pects
to go under somewhar in the mountains, and leave my topknot fur
the buzzards and reds, and it mought as well be in one part as
t’other of this country."</p>

<p>"Fudge, Biddon, don’t talk that way. Why I am sure I shall see
you settled down in the States with a wife and a dozen children&mdash;"</p>

<p>I paused as I noticed the trapper’s face. Some strange emotion
was gaining the mastery over him; but he conquered in a minute.</p>

<p>"Never talk that way agin, Jarsey; I can’t stand it."</p>

<p>"Pardon me; you will soon be under way," I spoke, wishing to
pass from the allusion which had been so painful to him. He turned,
and looking at the brigade, which was making preparations to start,
answered:</p>

<p>"Yas; the boys are near ready, and they won’t wait. What yer
goin’ to do, Jarsey, when we leave you ’mong the reds?"</p>

<p>"I have told you, Biddon, that my sole purpose is to seek out
Nat Todd. I have given you an account of my meeting and partial
flight with Imogene, the captive, who has told me of his whereabouts.
She is now waiting at Death Rock for me, and is as confident as
I am that I shall bring Nat with me. These Indians, believing
Imogene to be with the other tribe, will not suspect her flight
unless a runner arrives here and acquaints them with it; but I
have little fear of that, as I have no expectation of remaining
any length of time."</p>

<p>"Wal, as that little gal has <em>seed</em> Nat, of course he’s
kickin’. Bless her soul! I’d like to see her sweet face, but I
s’pose the brigade can’t spare me just now. Jarsey, I’ve my s’picions
that that other sperit is somewhere out toward Oregon, ’mong a
tribe of redskins. I’ve had my s’picions I say, but I’ll say nothin’
more now ’cept to kind of hint I may take a tramp out in them
parts some day to see ef thar be signs of her."</p>

<p>"I sincerely hope that such may be the case, although I cannot
be as sanguine as you are. Should you rescue her, the debt of
gratitude&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There! that’ll do, ogh!" interrupted Biddon, imperatively. "Such
things go agin my stummick, and I don’t want to hear ’em. As you’re
on the track of Nat, <em>go</em>, fur he may be somewhar yit,
in spite of the fears I have that he isn’t, arter all."</p>

<p>"Rest assured I shall leave no stone unturned. I shall seek him
at once."</p>

<p>"And when you finds him, jest tell him old Bill Biddon is about,
and ready to hunt savages with him any time, ef he don’t git behind
me when shootin’ time comes. Ogh! ogh!" and the trapper enjoyed
his joke merrily. He stopped suddenly and looked at the brigade.
A few moments more and they would be under way.</p>

<p>"Wal, Jarsey, talkin’ time’s gittin’ mighty short. I’d like to
talk longer, but can’t do it this time. Hope we’ll have a time
down in the States ’fore long."</p>

<p>"I sincerely trust we shall," I answered, unwilling to turn away
from the hopeful picture which he was drawing for himself.</p>

<p>"And we’ll have Nat ’long with us," he added.</p>

<p>"Of course, for I am sure he would not willingly miss an opportunity
of seeing his old friend again. Of course, Biddon, we shall meet,
if not in this world, I hope in the next."</p>

<p>"P’r’aps so, though I can’t tell till we gits there. Don’t know
much ’bout them matters, ogh!"</p>

<p>At this moment the voice of the steersman was heard, ordering
the men to their places. Biddon turned, took a step, then halted
and faced me.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Jarsey."</p>

<p>He extended his hand, but ere I could take it it was hastily
withdrawn. He mumbled something, dashed his hand across his face,
and strode rapidly toward the boat.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Biddon. God bless you!" I called after him.</p>

<p>The <em>voyageurs</em> seized their oars, and in a few moments
they were in the stream, their same cheery song echoing as loudly
and as joyously as before. I stood upon the bank, watching them
as the current bore them onward. In a few moments they reached
a bend in the river &mdash;Biddon made a signal to me, and the
next minute they had all vanished.</p>

<p>As the brigade vanished down the river, and the song of the <em>voyageurs</em>
grew fainter and fainter, until it died away in the distant windings
of the Yellowstone, I awoke from the mournful reverie into which
I had fallen, and turned to the work before me. There was a dozen
Indians around, all busy with their new possessions. Some were
parading pompously in their new blankets, some examining their
glitterng knives, and others wrenching off great mouthfuls from
huge twists of tobacco, and all evidently in the highest spirits.
The chief had been presented with a fine, polished rifle, and
he was standing apart, trying its lock, and "drawing bead" on
different objects in the distance.</p>

<p>I waited till he appeared satisfied, and then approached and
made a complimentary remark; I saw at once it was not comprehended,
and there was not probably a savage who could speak a word of
English in the tribe. However, as they spoke the same tongue as
the tribe in which I spent my captivity, my situation in this
respect was not as bad as it might have been.</p>

<p>In the course of half an hour, the chief started toward his village,
the others sauntering along behind him, and myself at his side.
His rifle was now thrown over his shoulder, and he seemed to have
lost all interest in it as he walked thoughtfully forward, his
dark eyes bent upon the ground. A few minutes’ walk through the
forest brought us to the Indian village. It was so similar to
the one before described, that it needs no mention here.</p>

<p>The Blackfeet-Sioux are one of the many divisions of the Dacotah
or Sioux tribe, whose hunting-grounds include the greater part
of the vast territory of Nebraska. These subdivisions of this
numerous people are tribes within themselves. Although speaking
the same tongue, they are separate and literally independent of
each other. Each has its village and chief, whose authority is
absolute. Like all North American Indians, their life is a migratory
one; and the traveler who to-day finds them located on the Yellowstone
or Little Missouri, may, a year after, find them as far westward
as the Great Falls of the Missouri.</p>

<p>My advent among these savages excited no unusual attention, as
they are often visited by traders and hunters. The chief took
me to his own lodge, where all the attention I could wish was
given. I was gladly surprised to find upon the next day, that
there was a half-breed among them who could speak the English
tongue. His acquaintance I soon made. He was a middle-aged man,
who had spent most of his life in trapping, sometimes as far northward
as the Saskatchewan, and who often acted as interpreter for his
tribe. He possessed the daring hardihood of the French trapper,
and the low, ferocious cunning of the savage. He had ever considered
this tribe as his people, having a squaw and several children.</p>

<p>From this half-breed I learned that the flight of Imogene was
not yet discovered, and that the tribe which held Nat was about
a dozen miles to the eastward I informed the chief, through the
interpreter, that I should make several days’ ramble through the
woods, in order to get a better idea of the face of the country
and of its resources. He seemed to believe I really was an agent
of one of the fur companies, and offered me an escort. I declined,
however, and the next morning started on foot in the direction
of the tribe alluded to.</p>
