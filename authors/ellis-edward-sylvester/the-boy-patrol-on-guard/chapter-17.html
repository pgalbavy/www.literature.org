<p>The doctor and his little daughter stood at the landing, the
mother remaining at the house, and watched the canoe as it put
out from the shore and headed toward the bungalow on the other
side of the lake. The fact that the boys had to sit facing the
other way did not prevent them from turning their heads several
times and waving a hand or paddle in response to the good-bye
greeting of Sunbeam. Mike having no paddling to do indulged in
the exchange much more than his companions.</p>

<p>By and by the girl at the request of her father ran to the house
and brought back his powerful telescope, which he pointed at the
boat. Unaware of this, and carrying no binoculars, the lads did
not know how distinctly they remained in the field of vision of
their friends and naturally the signalling between the parties
stopped.</p>

<p>The clearing of the skies proved only temporary and our young
friends had not paddled half the distance when they saw they were
in for a wetting. A cold, drizzling rain set in and was steadily
falling when they drew the canoe up the bank and hurried into
the building, whose shelter was most welcome. The other Boy Scouts,
who had been taught considerable in the way of reading weather
signs, had made haste to return from their wanderings, none being
so far off that he did not get back in time.</p>

<p>Of course even had the party been camping out of doors, they
would have been well guarded against so disagreeable a change,
but they were better shielded with so roomy a structure at their
command. They prepared supper in the big fireplace, and found
the warmth of the crackling logs very acceptable. Everything having
been adjusted for the night, several of the troop straightway
notified Scout Master Hall that, inasmuch as he had shifted the
responsibility of telling a good story upon Uncle Elk, he could
do so no longer, but must now "come down" with one of his best.
The demand quickly became unanimous, and the good-natured leader
saw no way for him to escape.</p>

<p>There was equal unanimity that the story should be an "Injin"
one, for you know boys will never lose their fondness for that
kind of yarn and Mr. Hall also conceded the point.</p>

<p>"Due mainly to the fact that I don’t see any way of dodging it.
An Indian or adventure story, to be fully enjoyed, should be told
round a camp fire in the depth of the woods; but as that is impractical
to-night, let us imagine that the blazing hickory there is kindled
miles from anything resembling a human habitation.</p>

<p>"You know how prone every one is to declare some incident ‘funny,’
when he should say it is strange or remarkable. I heard a woman
at home the other day say that ‘it was the funniest thing in the
world’ that she had to attend three funerals in a single week.
All the same, there is something funny in your request, for I
was about to ask whether you had any objections to my switching
off from the usual run of yarns and telling one about Indians."</p>

<p>He looked into the glowing faces. It was Mike Murphy who gravely
replied:</p>

<p>"I’m sorry to say, Scout Master, I have a sorrerful ’bjection
to your telling us such a yarn."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"My ’bjection is to the wurrad ‘one’; I move to amind the same
by saying ye shall relate eliven of ’em before ye puts the brake
on. The first Injin I obsarved in this country was a wooden one
in front of a cigar store in Boston town; I tried to open a playsant
conversation with him, but he was as glum as Chester or Alvin
after I’ve run ’em a fut race."</p>

<p>Inasmuch as Mike’s legs were so short that there wasn’t a boy
in camp who could not leave him far behind in a contest of speed,
a general smile followed his sober words.</p>

<p>"Last spring," began Scout Master Hall, "I made a trip to Denver,
Colorado, and took a run down to Trinidad, in the southern part
of the State. While there I noticed a handsome monument surmounting
one of the hills surrounding the city. The rocky point is known
as ‘Simpson’s Rest,’ and the story connected with it is one of
the most extraordinary of the many that marked the early days
of that region. Bear in mind, my young friends, that that which
I tell you is true in every particular. There is no need of my
relating fiction, when fact is much more interesting.</p>

<p>"It is now more than sixty years since John Simpson built a cabin
on the present site of Trinidad, which was then on the old Santa
Fe trail. Times without number he sat in his little front door,
smoking his pipe and watching the strings of prairie schooners
that passed on their way to or from Santa Fe. The trail makes
a sharp turn to the south not far from where the Simpson cabin
stood, and after climbing the precipitous Raton Mountains, on
what is now the Colorado line, the gold hunters found themselves
at the door of their El Dorado.</p>

<p>"Simpson was one of the greatest hunters, trappers and Indian
fighters of his day. He and the renowned Kit Carson, who was the
guide of Fremont the explorer, were intimate comrades and had
many thrilling adventures together. In the days of which I speak,
the Ute and Cheyenne Indians had their hunting grounds in the
foothills adjoining the Rockies, and did not as a rule harass
the settlers. But Simpson could never be quite easy regarding
them, for his long experience with red men warned him always to
be on the alert, though for several years his family suffered
no disturbance during his absences, which were sometimes extended
for weeks.</p>

<p>"In the month of May, 1855, Simpson came back from one of his
hunting expeditions. He hurried his return, for he had heard that
the Utes and Cheyennes were on the war path and he knew his home
would be one of the first to receive attention. He hoped that
his presence and reputation as a dangerous Indian fighter would
keep the redskins from molesting him.</p>

<p>"He had two children, Bob aged fifteen and Nora two years younger.
They were bright, affectionate and as fond of each other as of
their parents. On this morning in spring the brother and sister
started to go to a small stream of water which ran near their
cabin. They had not reached it when they were startled to see
a party of dusky horsemen galloping toward them at a terrific
pace. The riders brandished their lances and filled the air with
shouts. They were still a considerable distance away, and the
children were more astonished than alarmed.</p>

<p>"While staring at the party, they heard the shout of their father,
and turning their heads, saw him running toward them, rifle in
hand, and beckoning to them to hurry to the house. You may be
sure they lost no time in obeying, while he with loaded weapon
confronted the dusky horsemen. I suppose there must have been
near a score of them, but every buck of the crowd knew the white
man was a dead shot and never shrank from a fight, no matter how
desperate, and they hesitated.</p>

<p>"You may set it down as a fact that no matter how numerous a
band of Indians may be, when they are morally certain that the
first two or three to rush forward will be shot down, those two
or three will never make such a rush. You have read in your history
of colonial days, of Mr. Dunston of New Hampshire, who stood off
a party of marauding Indians simply by threatening to shoot the
foremost, until his children made their escape. Something of the
kind happened in the case of Simpson. As he walked slowly backward,
he held his deadly rifle grasped with both hands, and ready to
raise and fire on the instant needed. He never once removed his
keen gaze and his enemies did not even fire at him. They yearned
to do so, but dared not take the fearful risk.</p>

<p>"When Simpson reached his cabin, he found his terrified wife
and children making ready to leave. He told them the Indians had
massacred several families on the Arkansas River, they would soon
be joined by more warriors, and it was impossible to defend the
place against their enemies. Their only hope was to reach the
top of a hill near the house. There they would have the advantage
of a naturally strong defense, and might be able to hold off the
redskins until help came to the whites.</p>

<p>"Two burros were hastily loaded with provisions and a keg of
water, and Simpson stowed about him all the ammunition he possessed.
This took but a few minutes, during which the redskins galloped
back and forth and hovered in the neighborhood, eager to attack
and yet afraid to do so.</p>

<p>"‘Off with you,’ he said to his wife and children, ‘go as fast
as you can and I’ll stand ’em off till you’re at the top of the
hill.’</p>

<p>"He used the same maneuver as before and the whole party safely
reached the refuge. Nothing better intended for defense can be
imagined. The summit of the hill is flat and surrounded by a high
rocky wall. The only way to reach the top is by means of a single
narrow, stony path. It made me pant to climb it last spring, and
I wondered how those burros succeeded with their heavy burdens;
but you know they are used to such work and no doubt did as well
as the defenders of the natural fort. At any rate, all, including
the burros, reached the refuge and were quickly joined by Simpson,
who had held the Indians at bay. So long as he was unhurt and
his ammunition lasted, he could defend that pass against double
the number that had attacked him.</p>

<p>"It proved just as he said it would, for they had been only a
few minutes on the flat surface of the hill when the second party
to which Simpson had referred were seen approaching in the distance,
shouting and brandishing their spears and as eager to attack the
whites as the others had been.</p>

<p>"‘We’re in for it,’ said the father grimly, as he scanned the
new party of horsemen, ‘but they haven’t caught us yet.’</p>

<p>"The fortress of the little company could not have been better
had it been constructed by a party of army engineers. The Indians
may have believed they would be able to rush the defenders, but
it would be desperate work. Several of them, led by their chief,
clambered up the narrow, rocky passage as if they meant to make
a friendly call. Standing at the top, loaded rifle in hand, Simpson
waited until they had come quite near when he shouted to them
to halt. The leader, who could speak English, urged the white
man to surrender, assuring him that no harm should be done to
him or his family. Such treachery is common on the part of Indians,
who are quick to violate their most solemn pledge the moment they
can gain the chance. Simpson was too much of a veteran to be deceived
by so simple a ruse. Pointing his weapon at the chief, he called:</p>

<p>"‘Get, or I’ll shoot!’</p>

<p>"The whole band made a rush down the path, tumbling over on another,
each fearful of being winged by the terrible white man above.
They were aflame with rage, and gathering at the bottom of the
hill made preparations to overwhelm the brave defenders by a resistless
charge,—something which they would not have done except for the
humiliation that had just been put upon them.</p>

<p>"You may be sure that Simpson did not remain idle or throw away
any precautions. With wife and children helping, he rolled several
boulders to the head of the path, and held them poised until the
warriors were quite near. Then the huge masses of stone were rolled
over and went bounding and crashing among the yelling bucks who
were scattered right and left, with several badly hurt and one
or two picked off by the pioneer with his rifle. He fired as fast
as he could aim and reload, and repulsed the hostiles so decisively
that they did not again try to storm the fort.</p>

<p>"One recourse remained to them: that was to reduce the fort by
regular siege. It was clear that the garrison dare not come out
of the defenses, and sooner or later their provisions would be
eaten. Starvation is a foe against which no bravery can avail.
All the Indians had to do was to wait until the food was gone
and they were brought to the last extremity."</p>

<p>"What about water?" asked one of the boys.</p>

<p>"It is harder to bear thirst than hunger, and yet it may be said
that our friends never suffered that torture. Before the keg was
exhausted several showers of rain fell. The tops of the rocks
which formed the wall had quite a number of depressions and cavities
which held a goodly quantity of the precious fluid. The besieged
were devoutly thankful for this mercy. The matter of food, however,
was different. There could be no renewing of that, but, as I told
you, they had brought considerable with them. This was doled out,
each content with what the head of the family gave her or him,
especially when they saw that he ate less than any one of them.</p>

<p>"As the stress tightened, Simpson shot one of the burros and
they feasted upon his raw flesh, since there was no way of kindling
a fire. In due time the second animal followed the first, he forming
the last reserve. Two burros can be made to last four persons
a long while, if their flesh is sparingly used, and the family
underwent no real hunger until at the last.</p>

<p>"I doubt whether the history of the West contains so strange
an episode as that of the siege of John Simpson, his wife and
two children. They took turns in keeping watch, for the red man
is subtle by nature and they could be counted upon to test thoroughly
the vigilance of the little company. More than once several of
the Utes or Cheyennes stole as noiselessly as shadows up the flinty
path, but before they could do any harm the crack of the deadly
rifle sent them skurrying to the bottom. Simpson always stood
guard through the night, for he knew that was the time of greatest
peril. He gained the needed sleep during the day, when his wife
and children could act as sentinels and if necessary rouse him
from slumber. Sometimes, by way of variety he exchanged shots
with the besiegers below, and they quickly learned the wisdom
of keeping out of range of the white man who had a way of always
hitting that at which he aimed his rifle.</p>

<p>"That remarkable siege lasted for five weeks. By that time, despite
the parsimony in the use of food, not a particle remained. All
the Indians had to do was to wait until the family fell like ripe
fruit into their grasp. Simpson said little and never once hinted
at the dreadful fate which impended. Nor did any one speak of
it, for the fearful theme was in all their thoughts and there
was no need of doing so.</p>

<p>"It was near the end of the fifth week, that the besieging red
men suddenly grouped their ponies together and with shrill cries
dashed off at full speed. They had seen the approach of a troop
of cavalry from Fort Lyon, a hundred and fifty miles distant,
and very much preferred their room to their company. Simpson and
his family were rescued and to-day you will find quite a number
of their descendants living near Trinidad. The hero certainly
deserved the tribute of the pretty monument that has been built
upon that memorable spot.</p>

<p>"Such is my ‘Injin’ story," added Scout Master Hall with a smile;
"I can claim two merits for it: it is true and it has a pleasant
ending, but I am compelled to add one unpleasant fact. The monument
has been so defaced and mutilated by relic hunters that it is
ruined. One person has had the unspeakable cheek to daub his sprawling
initials with a paint brush all over the tomb, earning for himself
a reputation that no one envies." </p>
