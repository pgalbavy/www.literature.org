<p> "<em>AFTER </em>this&mdash;as he called it&mdash;act of justice, Ruiz
crossed the Rio Blanco, followed by the greater part of his band,
and entrenched himself upon a hill A company of regular troops
sent out foolishly against him was surrounded, and destroyed almost
to a man. Other expeditions, though better organised, were equally
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>"It was during these sanguinary skirmishes that his wife first
began to appear on horseback at his right hand. Rendered proud
and self-confident by his successes, Ruiz no longer charged at
the head of his partida, but presumptuously, like a general directing
the movements of an army, he remained in the rear, well mounted
and motionless on an eminence, sending out his orders. She was
seen repeatedly at his side, and for a long time was mistaken
for a man. There was much talk then of a mysterious white-faced
chief, to whom the defeats of our troops were ascribed. She rode
like an Indian woman, astride, wearing a broad-rimmed man’s hat
and a dark poncho. Afterwards, in the day of their greatest prosperity,
this poncho was embroidered in gold, and she wore then, also,
the sword of poor Don Antonio de Leyva. This veteran Chilean officer,
having the misfortune to be surrounded with his small force, and
running short of ammunition, found his death at the hands of the
Arauco Indians, the allies and auxiliaries of Gaspar Ruiz. This
was the fatal affair long remembered afterwards as the ‘Massacre
of the Island.’ The sword of the unhappy officer was presented
to her by Peneleo, the Araucanian chief; for these Indians, struck
by her aspect, the deathly pallor of her face, which no exposure
to the weather seemed to affect, and her calm indifference under
fire, looked upon her as a supernatural being, or at least as
a witch. By this superstition the prestige and authority of Gaspar
Ruiz amongst these ignorant people were greatly augmented. She
must have savoured her vengeance to the full on that day when
she buckled on the sword of Don Antonio de Leyva. It never left
her side, unless she put on her woman’s clothes&mdash;not that she
would or could ever use it, but she loved to feel it beating upon
her thigh as a perpetual reminder and symbol of the dishonour
to the arms of the Republic. She was insatiable. Moreover, on
the path she had led Gaspar Ruiz upon, there is no stopping. Escaped
prisoners&mdash;and they were not many&mdash;used to relate how with a few
whispered words she could change the expression of his face and
revive his flagging animosity. They told how after every skirmish,
after every raid, after every successful action, he would ride
up to her and look into her face. Its haughty-calm was never relaxed.
Her embrace, senores, must have been as cold as the embrace of
a statue. He tried to melt her icy heart in a stream of warm blood.
Some English naval officers who visited him at that time noticed
the strange character of his infatuation."</p>

<p>At the movement of surprise and curiosity in his audience General
Santierra paused for a moment.</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;English naval officers," he repeated. "Ruiz had consented
to receive them to arrange for the liberation of some prisoners
of your nationality. In the territory upon which he ranged, from
sea coast to the Cordillera, there was a bay where the ships of
that time, after rounding Gape Horn, used to resort for wood and
water. There, decoying the crew on shore, he captured first the
whaling brig Hersalia, and afterwards made himself master by surprise
of two more ships, one English and one American.</p>

<p>"It was rumoured at the time that he dreamed of setting up a
navy of his own. But that, of course, was impossible. Still, manning
the brig with part of her own crew, and putting an officer and
a good many men of his own on board, he sent her off to the Spanish
Governor of the island of Chiloe with a report of his exploits,
and a demand for assistance in the war against the rebels. The
Governor could not do much for him; but he sent in return two
light field-pieces, a letter of compliments, with a colonel’s
commission in the royal forces, and a great Spanish flag. This
standard with much ceremony was hoisted over his house in the
heart of the Arauco country. Surely on that day she may have smiled
on her guasso husband with a less haughty reserve.</p>

<p>"The senior officer of the English squadron on our coast made
representations to our Government as to these captures. But Gaspar
Ruiz refused to treat with us. Then an English frigate proceeded
to the bay, and her captain, doctor, and two lieutenants travelled
inland under a safe conduct. They were well received, and spent
three days as guests of the partisan chief. A sort of military,
barbaric state was kept up at the residence. It was furnished
with the loot of frontier towns. When first admitted to the principal
sala, they saw his wife lying down (she was not in good health
then), with Gaspar Ruiz sitting at the foot of the couch. His-hat
was lying on the floor, and his hands reposed on the hilt of his
sword.</p>

<p>"During that first conversation he never removed his big hands
from the sword-hilt, except once, to arrange the coverings about
her, with gentle, careful touches. They noticed that when ever
she spoke he would fix his eyes upon her in a kind of expectant,
breathless attention, and seemingly forget the existence of the
world and his own existence too. In the course of the farewell
banquet, at which she was present reclining on her couch, he burst
forth into complaints of the treatment he had received. After
General San Martin’s departure he had been beset by spies, slandered
by civil officials, his services ignored, his liberty and even
his life threatened by the Chilian Government. He got up from
the table, thundered execrations pacing the room wildly, then
sat down on the couch at his wife’s feet, his breast heaving,
his eyes fixed on the floor. She reclined on her back, her head
on the cushions, her eyes nearly closed.</p>

<p>"‘And now I am an honoured Spanish officer,’ he added in a calm
voice.</p>

<p>"The captain of the English frigate then took the opportunity
to inform him gently that Lima had fallen, and that by the terms
of a convention the Spaniards were withdrawing from the whole
continent.</p>

<p>"Gaspar Ruiz raised his head, and without hesitation, speaking
with suppressed vehemence, declared, that if not a single Spanish
soldier were left in the whole of South America he would persist
in carrying on the contest against Chile to the last drop of blood.
When he finished that mad tirade his wife’s long white hand was
raised, and she just caressed his knee with the tips of her fingers
for a fraction of a second.</p>

<p>"For the rest of the officers’ stay, which did not extend for
more than half an hour after the banquet, that ferocious chieftain
of a desperate partida overflowed with amiability and kindness.
He had been hospitable before, but now it seemed as though he
could not do enough for the comfort and safety of his visitors’
journey back to their ship.</p>

<p>"Nothing, I have been told, could have presented a greater contrast
to his late violence or the habitual taciturn reserve of his manner.
Like a man elated beyond measure by an unexpected happiness, he
overflowed with good-will, amiability, and attentions. He embraced
the officers like brothers, almost with tears in his eyes. The
released prisoners were presented each with a piece of gold. At
the last moment, suddenly, he declared he could do no less than
restore to the masters of the merchant vessels all their private
property. This unexpected generosity caused some delay in the
departure of the party, and their first march was very short.</p>

<p>"Late in the evening Gaspar Ruiz rode up with an escort, to their
camp fires, bringing along with him a mule loaded with cases of
wine. He had come, he said, to drink a stirrup cup with his English
friends, whom he would never see again. He was mellow and joyous
in his temper. He told stories of his own exploits, laughed like
a boy, borrowed a guitar from the Englishmen’s chief muleteer,
and sitting cross-legged on his superfine poncho spread before
the glow of the embers, sang a guasso love-song in a tender voice.
Then his head dropped on his breast, his hands fell to the ground;
the guitar rolled off his knees&mdash;and a great hush fell over the
camp after the love-song of the implacable partisan who had made
so many of our people weep for destroyed homes and for loves cut
short.</p>

<p>"Before anybody could make a sound he sprang up from the ground
and called for his horse. ‘Adios, my friends!’ he cried, ‘Go with
God. I love you. And tell them well in Santiago that between Gaspar
Ruiz, colonel of the King of Spain, and the republican carrion-crows
of Chile there is war to the last breath&mdash;war! war! war!’</p>

<p>"With a great yell of ‘War! war! war!’ which his escort took
up, they rode away, and the sound of hoofs and of voices died
out in the distance between the slopes of the hills.</p>

<p>"The two young English officers were convinced that Ruiz was
mad. How do you say that?&mdash;tile loose&mdash;eh? But the doctor, an
observant Scotsman with much shrewdness and philosophy in his
character, told me that it was a very curious case of possession.
I met him many years afterwards, but he remembered the experience
very well. He told me too that in his opinion that woman did not
lead Gaspar Ruiz into the practice of sanguinary treachery by
direct persuasion, but by the subtle way of awakening and keeping
alive in his simple mind a burning sense of an irreparable wrong.
Maybe, maybe. But I would say that she poured half of her vengeful
soul into the strong clay of that man, as you may pour intoxication,
madness, poison into an empty cup.</p>

<p>"If he wanted war he got it in earnest when our victorious army
began to return from Peru. Systematic operations were planned
against this blot on the honour and prosperity of our hardly-won
independence. General Robles commanded, with his well-known ruthless
severity. Savage reprisals were exercised on both sides, and no
quarter was given in the field. Having won my promotion in the
Peru campaign, I was a captain on the staff.</p>

<p>"Gaspar Ruiz found himself hard pressed; at the same time we
heard by means of a fugitive priest who had been carried off from
his village presbytery, and galloped eighty miles into the hills
to perform the christening ceremony, that a daughter was born
to them. To celebrate the event, I suppose, Ruiz executed one
or two brilliant forays clear away at the rear of our forces,
and defeated the detachments sent out to cut off his retreat.
General Robles nearly had a stroke of apoplexy from rage. He found
another cause of insomnia than the bites of mosquitoes; but against
this one, senores, tumblers of raw brandy had no more effect than
so much water. He took to railing and storming at me about my
strong man. And from our impatience to end this inglorious campaign,
I am afraid that we young officers became reckless and apt to
take undue risks on service.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, slowly, inch by inch as it were, our columns were
closing upon Gaspar Ruiz, though he had managed to raise all the
Araucanian nation of wild Indians against us. Then a year or more
later our Government became aware through its agents and spies
that he had actually entered into alliance with Carreras, the
so-called dictator of the so-called republic of Mendoza, on the
other side of the mountains. Whether Gaspar Ruiz had a deep political
intention, or whether he wished only to secure a safe retreat
for his wife and child while he pursued remorselessly against
us his war of surprises and massacres, I cannot tell. The alliance,
however, was a fact. Defeated in his attempt to check our advance
from the sea, he retreated with his usual swiftness, and preparing
for another hard and hazardous tussle began by sending his wife
with the little girl across the Pequena range of mountains, on
the frontier of Mendoza."</p>
