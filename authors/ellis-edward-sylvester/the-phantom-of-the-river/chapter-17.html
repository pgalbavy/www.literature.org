<p>We have now reached a point in our narrative where it once more
becomes necessary to follow the fortunes of Jethro Juggens, whom
we were obliged to leave in anything but a pleasant situation.</p>

<p>After a rather stirring experience in the cabin of Mr. Ashbridge,
whither he had gone in total disregard of the instructions of
Simon Kenton, he awoke to the fact that it would not do for him
to tarry longer so far from his friends and exposed to so much
personal danger. He must leave without further delay.</p>

<p>The proof received of the presence of one or more Shawanoes on
the outside was too alarming for him to feel any of his old-time
assurance in venturing across the clearing to the shelter of the
surrounding forest. It will be remembered that he suddenly formed
the decision to incase himself in armor, so to speak, by using
one of the several boxes that had been brought down the river
on the flatboat.</p>

<p>Filled with the scheme, he made ready for the extraordinary experiment.
His plan was to invert one of the boxes over his head, and thus
protected, stride across the open space to the woods; but second
thought and considerable experimenting revealed difficulties which
speedily became mountainous in their nature.</p>

<p>"Dat will be all right," he muttered, after he had emptied the
box which had contained the food and some other articles; "but
it's gwine to be a mighty bother to take dis ting and my gun too.
Den as long as I keep it ober my head I won't be able to see where
I'm gwine; I may keep walkin' round in a circle for two, free
days, and fotch up ag'in de doah ob dis house ebery time. I'll
hab to make a peep-hole in front."</p>

<p>To do this required work, but the pine wood was soft and his
knife was sharp. Vigorous use of the implement soon opened a hole
two or three inches in diameter, through which he could obtain
a good view of his immediate surroundings.</p>

<p>"Dat will work," he muttered, with some satisfaction, as he felt
of the opening, and found he could pass his hand through it; "it's
a little bigger dan I meant to make it, but if I see one ob de
heathen p'intin' his gun toward me I can slip my head to one side.
I'll try it."</p>

<p>He lifted the receptacle over his head and shoulders, and found
it fitted to a nicety. It could not have answered better had it
been constructed for the express purpose of serving him as a shield.</p>

<p>He cautiously peeped through the windows, and discovering nothing
to cause misgiving, drew back the door sufficiently to allow him
to pass through with his turtle-like protection. Then he stepped
forth upon the partially moonlit clearing, and, with considerable
labor, inched along until perhaps a dozen feet distant from the
building. His next act was to turn abruptly about and hasten back
through the open door with such precipitation that he stumbled
headlong into the room.</p>

<p>"Gorrynation! I's a big fool!" was his exclamation, and which,
it is safe to say, none of his acquaintances would have disputed.</p>

<p>To his dismay he made several disquieting discoveries. In the
first place, when he attempted to look through the peep-hole it
was not there. Inadvertently he had put on the box in a reversed
position, so that the opening was behind him. He attempted to
shift the box about, but it would not work well. At the same moment
he became aware that he had forgotten to bring his gun with him,
and, worst of all, a sudden conviction flashed upon him that the
soft pine in which he was enveloped was not strong enough to stop
the course of a bullet. Therefore the wood was no protection at
all.</p>

<p>These causes combined to throw the dusky youth into a panic,
which sent him and the box crashing through the door before his
novel experiment was subjected to a real test.</p>

<p>"It won't work," was his decision; "I hab to show my feet, 'cause
dey's de biggest part ob me, and if de heathens shoot dem off
dey'll hab me dead suah."</p>

<p>The only comfort he derived from the partial experiment was that
nothing was seen or heard of the red men. It seemed to him that
they would have made some demonstration had they observed him,
and he was strongly tempted to make a dash for the wood, without
encumbering himself with anything more than his gun.</p>

<p>Sufficient uncertainty, however, remained to hold him in check
for a time, when, like an inspiration, a new suggestion forced
itself into his brain.</p>

<p>Among the goods left behind in the cabin by the pioneers in their
flight toward the block-house was considerable bedding, mostly
in the shape of sheets, quilts and blankets. Why not swathe himself
in these instead of using the awkward and cumbersome box?</p>

<p>The more he thought of the plan, the more he was pleased. He
could wrap the tough linen sheets about his figure until the thickness
would be doubly as effective as the wood. He could gather them
round his head so that they would project above and protect it,
and let them descend so low that his feet would be well armored
and still leave opportunity to use them. He could readily carry
his gun and leave a space in front of his eyes through which to
make observations.</p>

<p>What was to prevent the complete success of the plan?</p>

<p>"Nuffin," he muttered, answering his own question. "I'll put
so many ob dem sheets 'round me dat dey can bang away all night
widout hurtin' nobody. Den, I've been told dat Injins am mighty
skeery, and dey may take me for a hobblegoblin or ghost."</p>

<p>Absurd as the scheme of Jethro Juggens may seem, it was not wholly
lacking in merit. At any rate, he took but a brief while to turn
it over in his mind, when he set to work to put it to a practical
test.</p>

<p>The toughness of the sheets made them preferable to the softer
and more yielding blankets, and the youth decided to use them
exclusively. Each, of course, had been put together by deft hands
and spinning-wheel, and was of firm, strong texture. Jethro was
so familiar with where these were stowed, through his work of
loading and unloading, that he found no trouble when compelled
to labor in total darkness.</p>

<p>One by one the sheets were drawn forth, until six of them were
tumbled upon the floor at his feet. He opened wide the door, that
the faint moonlight should give help in arraying himself in his
novel costume. Then, making sure that the rifle was not forgotten
this time, he wrapped himself round and round, again and again,
until he resembled an enormous pillow stood on one end.</p>

<p>He made sure that the folds projected above his hat, and would
shut out all bullets that might hurtle against the unique helmet.
At the same time the covering descended so low about his ankles
that it trailed upon the ground, and portended disaster in case
of haste upon his part.</p>

<p>Now that the essay was to be pushed to a conclusion, Jethro was
wise in taking every possible precaution.</p>

<p>Peering through the door, he scanned the clearing to the river,
as it was revealed by the moon, which just then was obstructed
by passing clouds. Then he looked searchingly to the eastward,
where, so far as he could tell, nothing threatened, and the same
result followed a survey of the clearing in the opposite direction.
Lastly, he peered through the rear window where had been displayed
the flag of truce which he dextrously appropriated to his personal
use.</p>

<p>This was the course he was inclined to take, and because of that
he subjected it to the closest possible study.</p>

<p>Was it imagination, or did he really see the figures of one or
two Indians standing motionless on the edge of the wood, as if
waiting for him to come forth and place himself within their reach?
Jethro stood intently watching them for some minutes, until in
the obscured moonlight they vanished from sight.</p>

<p>"Guess dar ain't nobody dar," was his conclusion, as his spirits
revived again; "anyway, I won't try to rout 'em out if dar is."</p>

<p>The uncertainty caused him to change his intention and decide
to advance toward the wood near where Kenton had withdrawn the
canoe from under the nose of the sleeping Shawanoe. A vague feeling
of security hung around the flatboat. The youth was accustomed
to that, having spent so much time on it, and if he were driven
to it as a refuge, was confident of making a good defence with
the aid of his rifle.</p>

<p>With that peculiar sensitiveness to little things which a man
often displays in moments of danger, Jethro paused after reaching
the outside, and, making sure that the latch-string was drawn
inward, carefully closed the door behind him. Thus it was securely
locked, and he reflected with a start that he had now burned his
bridge behind him. If any enemies at that moment should charge
upon him, he could not make use of the cabin, even though he stood
near enough to it to reach it with his outstretched hand.</p>

<p>So far as he saw, no danger confronted him, and he resolutely
struck off in the direction he had in mind, instantly discovering
that the pains he had taken to protect his feet and ankles seriously
interfered with his locomotion. He could take only very short
steps, and naturally became impatient with his slow progress.</p>

<p>The figure that he cut was certainly grotesque to the last degree.
His ample proportions were made much more ample by the many thicknesses
of spotless linen in which they were arrayed. The folds, extended
above his head, naturally added to his height, so that he suggested
a ghostly giant mincing across the clearing to the river.</p>

<p>The strangely good fortune which had accompanied the dusky youth
did not desert him now when entering upon the most remarkable
experience of his career. We have shown how he entered the cabin
unchallenged, when, had he made the attempt a little earlier or
later, assuredly he could not have escaped the bullet of one of
the two Indians in the vicinity.</p>

<p>From what was afterward learned, the theory of Kenton and Boone
was probably reasonably correct, though it did not fully explain
all that took place.</p>

<p>When Kenton returned to the clearing toward the close of that
day, there were two Shawanoes lurking in the vicinity. It may
have been that The Panther, arranging the ambuscade further away
at Rattlesnake Gulch, held a suspicion that the pioneers might
turn back on their own trail and make a stand in the cabin, and
he instructed these two warriors to remain and signal the fact
to him, probably by some peculiar discharge of their rifles.</p>

<p>While one of them was moving through the woods, the other remained
near the canoe and fell into a doze. It was at this juncture that
Jethro Juggens entered the cabin unobserved. Soon after, the second
Indian returned to the neighborhood of the other, who had awakened,
and noted with amazement the loss of the boat.</p>

<p>One of these warriors set out to recover it, with what result
has already been made known. The other remained in the vicinity
of the clearing to watch things until his return. Discovering
the presence of one of the party in the building, but, without
any means of knowing his identity, he set out to dislodge him.</p>

<p>The voices which Jethro insisted he heard outside the door could
very well have been the voice of a single warrior, such subterfuges
being among the most common with the American race. After the
man[oe]uvring back and forth between this Shawanoe and the youth,
the former must have grown uneasy over the prolonged absence of
his companion who had set out to recover the canoe. Abandoning
the cabin with one or more occupants, he hurried along the river
bank. This enterprise was more successful than the other, for
he recovered the boat without the slightest injury to himself.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that when Jethro Juggens emerged from the
cabin, bandaged and swathed from above the crown of his head to
the soles of his feet, the extraordinary precaution was useless,
and he might have walked forth with the assurance of one who was
master of the situation.</p>

<p>But had he done so that which we have now to make known could
never have taken place.</p>
