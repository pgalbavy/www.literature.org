<p><em>MAJOR-GENERAL</em></p>

<p><em>SIR FRANCIS LLOYD, K.C.B</em>.</p>

<p><em>MY <em>DEAR GENERAL:</em></em></p>

<p><em>A recent tale of mine has, I am told, found favour in the
dug-outs and billets of the British front, as being sufficiently
short and sufficiently exciting for men who have little leisure
to read.  My friends in that uneasy region have asked for more. 
So I have printed this story, written in the smooth days before
the war, in the hope that it may enable an honest man here and
there to forget for an hour the too urgent realities.  I have
put your name on it, because among the many tastes which we share
one is a liking for precipitous yarns.</em></p>

<p><em>PREFACE BY THE EDITOR</em></p>

<p>We were at Glenaicill&mdash;six of us&mdash;for the duck-shooting, when
Leithen told us this story.  Since five in the morning we had
been out on the skerries, and had been blown home by a wind which
threatened to root the house and its wind-blown woods from their
precarious lodgment on the hill.  A vast nondescript meal, luncheon
and dinner in one, had occupied us till the last daylight departed,
and we settled ourselves in the smoking-room for a sleepy evening
of talk and tobacco.</p>

<p>Conversation, I remember, turned on some of Jim's trophies which
grinned at us from the firelit walls, and we began to spin hunting
yarns.  Then Hoppy Bynge, who was killed next year on the Bramaputra,
told us some queer things about his doings in New Guinea, where
he tried to climb Carstensz, and lived for six months in mud. 
Jim said he couldn't abide mud&mdash;anything was better than a country
where your boots rotted.  (He was to get enough of it last winter
in the Ypres Salient.) You know how one tale begets another, and
soon the whole place hummed with odd recollections, for five of
us had been a good deal about the world.</p>

<p>All except Leithen, the man who was afterwards Solicitor-General,
and, they say, will get to the Woolsack in time.  I don't suppose
he had ever been farther from home than Monte Carlo, but he liked
hearing about the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>Jim had just finished a fairly steep yarn about his experiences
on a Boundary Commission near Lake Chad, and Leithen got up to
find a drink.</p>

<p>"Lucky devils," he said.  "You've had all the fun out of life. 
I've had my nose to the grindstone ever since I left school."</p>

<p>I said something about his having all the honour and glory.</p>

<p>"All the same," he went on, "I once played the chief part in
a rather exciting business without ever once budging from London. 
And the joke of it was that the man who went out to look for adventure
only saw a bit of the game, and I who sat in my chambers saw it
all and pulled the strings.  'They also serve who only stand and
wait,' you know."</p>

<p>Then he told us this story.  The version I give is one he afterwards
wrote down when he had looked up his diary for some of the details.</p>
