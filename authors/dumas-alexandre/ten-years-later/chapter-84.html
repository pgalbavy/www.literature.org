<P>The following day was somewhat calmer, although the gale
still continued. The sun had, however, risen through a bank
of orange clouds, tingeing with its cheerful rays the crests
of the black waves. Watch was impatiently kept from the
different look-outs. Towards eleven o'clock in the morning a
ship, with sails full set, was signalled as in view; two
others followed at the distance of about half a knot. They
approached like arrows shot from the bow of a skillful
archer; and yet the sea ran so high that their speed was as
nothing compared to the rolling of the billows in which the
vessels were plunging first in one direction and then in
another. The English fleet was soon recognized by the line
of the ships, and by the color of their pennants; the one
which had the princess on board and carried the admiral's
flag preceded the others.</P>
<P>The rumor now spread that the princess was arriving. The
whole French court ran to the harbor, while the quays and
jetties were soon covered by crowds of people. Two hours
afterwards, the other vessels had overtaken the flagship,
and the three, not venturing perhaps to enter the narrow
entrance of the harbor, cast anchor between Havre and La
Heve. When the maneuver had been completed, the vessel which
bore the admiral saluted France by twelve discharges of
cannon, which were returned, discharge for discharge, from
Fort Francis I. Immediately afterwards a hundred boats were
launched; they were covered with the richest stuffs, and
destined for the conveyance of the different members of the
French nobility towards the vessels at anchor. But when it
was observed that even inside the harbor the boats were
tossed to and fro, and that beyond the jetty the waves rose
mountains high, dashing upon the shore with a terrible
uproar, it will readily be believed that not one of those
frail boats would be able with safety to reach a fourth part
of the distance between the shore and the vessels at anchor.
A pilot-boat, however, notwithstanding the wind and the sea,
was getting ready to leave the harbor, for the purpose of
placing itself at the admiral's disposal.</P>
<P>De Guiche, who had been looking among the different boats
for one stronger than the others, which might offer a chance
of reaching the English vessels, perceiving the pilot-boat
getting ready to start, said to Raoul: &quot;Do you not think,
Raoul, that intelligent and vigorous men, as we are, ought
to be ashamed to retreat before the brute strength of wind
and waves?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is precisely the very reflection I was silently making
to myself,&quot; replied Bragelonne.</P>
<P>&quot;Shall we get into that boat, then, and push off? Will you
come, De Wardes?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Take care, or you will get drowned,&quot; said Manicamp.</P>
<P>&quot;And for no purpose,&quot; said De Wardes, &quot;for with the wind in
your teeth, as it will be, you will never reach the
vessels.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You refuse, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Assuredly I do; I would willingly risk and lose my life in
an encounter against men,&quot; he said, glancing at Bragelonne,
&quot;but as to fighting with oars against waves, I have no taste
for that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And for myself,&quot; said Manicamp, &quot;even were I to succeed in
reaching the ships, I should not be indifferent to the loss
of the only good dress which I have left,  -  salt water
would spoil it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You, then, refuse also?&quot; exclaimed De Guiche.</P>
<P>&quot;Decidedly I do; I beg you to understand that most
distinctly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; exclaimed De Guiche, &quot;look, De Wardes  -  look,
Manicamp  -  look yonder, the princesses are looking at us
from the poop of the admiral's vessel.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;An additional reason, my dear fellow, why we should not
make ourselves ridiculous by being drowned while they are
looking on.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is that your last word, Manicamp?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And then yours, De Wardes?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then I go alone.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not so,&quot; said Raoul, &quot;for I shall accompany you; I thought
it was understood I should do so.&quot;</P>
<P>The fact is, that Raoul, uninfluenced by devotion, measuring
the risk they run, saw how imminent the danger was, but he
willingly allowed himself to accept a peril which De Wardes
had declined.</P>
<P>The boat was about to set off when De Guiche called to the
pilot. &quot;Stay,&quot; said he: &quot;we want two places in your boat;&quot;
and wrapping five or six pistoles in paper, he threw them
from the quay into the boat.</P>
<P>&quot;It seems you are not afraid of salt water, young
gentlemen.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We are afraid of nothing,&quot; replied De Guiche.</P>
<P>&quot;Come along, then.&quot;</P>
<P>The pilot approached the side of the boat, and the two young
men, one after the other, with equal vivacity, jumped into
the boat. &quot;Courage, my men,&quot; said De Guiche; &quot;I have twenty
pistoles left in this purse, and as soon as we reach the
admiral's vessel they shall be yours.&quot; The sailors bent
themselves to their oars, and the boat bounded over the
crest of the waves. The interest taken in this hazardous
expedition was universal; the whole population of Havre
hurried towards the jetties and every look was directed
towards the little bark; at one moment it flew suspended on
the crest of the foaming waves, then suddenly glided
downwards towards the bottom of a raging abyss, where it
seemed utterly lost. At the expiration of an hour's
struggling with the waves, it reached the spot where the
admiral's vessel was anchored, and from the side of which
two boats had already been dispatched towards their aid.
Upon the quarter-deck of the flagship, sheltered by a canopy
of velvet and ermine, which was suspended by stout supports,
Henrietta, the queen dowager, and the young princess  -  with
the admiral, the Duke of Norfolk  -  standing beside them  - 
watched with alarm this slender bark, at one moment tossed
to the heavens, and the next buried beneath the waves, and
against whose dark sail the noble figures of the two French
gentlemen stood forth in relief like two luminous
apparitions. The crew, leaning against the bulwarks and
clinging to the shrouds, cheered the courage of the two
daring young men, the skill of the pilot, and the strength
of the sailors. They were received at the side of the vessel
by a shout of triumph. The Duke of Norfolk, a handsome young
man, from twenty-six to twenty-eight years of age, advanced
to meet them. De Guiche and Bragelonne lightly mounted the
ladder on the starboard side, and conducted by the Duke of
Norfolk, who resumed his place near them, they approached to
offer their homage to the princesses. Respect, and yet more,
a certain apprehension, for which he could not account, had
hitherto restrained the Comte de Guiche from looking at
Madame attentively, who, however, had observed him
immediately, and had asked her mother, &quot;Is not that Monsieur
in the boat yonder?&quot; Madame Henrietta who knew Monsieur
better than her daughter did, smiled at the mistake her
vanity had led her into, and had answered, &quot;No; it is only
M. de Guiche, his favorite.&quot; The princess, at this reply,
was constrained to check an instinctive tenderness of
feeling which the courage displayed by the count had
awakened. At the very moment the princess had put this
question to her mother, De Guiche had, at last, summoned
courage to raise his eyes towards her and could compare the
original with the portrait he had so lately seen. No sooner
had he remarked her pale face, her eyes so full of
animation, her beautiful nut-brown hair, her expressive
lips, and her every gesture, which, while betokening royal
descent, seemed to thank and to encourage him at one and the
same time, than he was, for a moment, so overcome, that, had
it not been for Raoul, on whose arm he leant, he would have
fallen. His friend's amazed look, and the encouraging
gesture of the queen, restored Guiche to his
self-possession. In a few words he explained his mission,
explained in what way he had become the envoy of his royal
highness; and saluted, according to their rank and the
reception they gave him, the admiral and several of the
English noblemen who were grouped around the princesses.</P>
<P>Raoul was then presented, and was most graciously received;
the share that the Comte de la Fere had had in the
restoration of Charles II. was known to all; and, more than
that, it was the comte who had been charged with the
negotiation of the marriage, by means of which the
granddaughter of Henry IV. was now returning to France.
Raoul spoke English perfectly, and constituted himself his
friend's interpreter with the young English noblemen, who
were indifferently acquainted with the French language. At
this moment a young man came forward, of extremely handsome
features, and whose dress and arms were remarkable for their
extravagance of material. He approached the princesses, who
were engaged in conversation with the Duke of Norfolk, and,
in a voice which ill concealed his impatience, said, &quot;It is
time now to disembark, your royal highness. &quot;The younger of
the princesses rose from her seat at this remark, and was
about to take the hand which the young nobleman extended to
her, with an eagerness which arose from a variety of
motives, when the admiral intervened between them,
observing; &quot;A moment, if you please, my lord; it is not
possible for ladies to disembark just now, the sea is too
rough; it is probable the wind may abate before sunset, and
the landing will not be effected, therefore, until this
evening.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Allow me to observe, my lord,&quot; said Buckingham, with an
irritation of manner which he did not seek to disguise, &quot;you
detain these ladies, and you have no right to do so. One of
them, unhappily, now belongs to France, and you perceive
that France claims them by the voice of her ambassadors;&quot;
and at the same moment he indicated Raoul and Guiche, whom
he saluted.</P>
<P>&quot;I cannot suppose that these gentlemen intend to expose the
lives of their royal highnesses,&quot; replied the admiral.</P>
<P>&quot;These gentlemen,&quot; retorted Buckingham, &quot;arrived here
safely, notwithstanding the wind; allow me to believe that
the danger will not be greater for their royal highnesses
when the wind will be in their favor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;These envoys have shown how great their courage is,&quot; said
the admiral. &quot;You may have observed that there was a great
number of persons on shore who did not venture to accompany
them. Moreover, the desire which they had to show their
respect with the least possible delay to Madame and her
illustrious mother induced them to brave the sea, which is
very tempestuous to-day, even for sailors. These gentlemen,
however, whom I recommend as an example for my officers to
follow, can hardly be so for these ladies.&quot;</P>
<P>Madame glanced at the Comte de Guiche, and perceived that
his face was burning with confusion. This look had escaped
Buckingham, who had eyes for nothing but Norfolk, of whom he
was evidently very jealous; he seemed anxious to remove the
princesses from the deck of a vessel where the admiral
reigned supreme. &quot;In that case,&quot; returned Buckingham, &quot;I
appeal to Madame herself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And I, my lord,&quot; retorted the admiral, &quot;I appeal to my own
conscience, and to my own sense of responsibility. I have
undertaken to convey Madame safe and sound to France, and I
shall keep my promise.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But sir  -  -  &quot; continued Buckingham.</P>
<P>&quot;My lord, permit me to remind you that I command here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you aware what you are saying, my lord?&quot; replied
Buckingham, haughtily.</P>
<P>&quot;Perfectly so; I therefore repeat it: I alone command here,
all yield obedience to me; the sea and the winds, the ships
and men too.&quot; This remark was made in a dignified and
authoritative manner. Raoul observed its effect upon
Buckingham, who trembled with anger from head to foot, and
leaned against one of the poles of the tent to prevent
himself falling; his eyes became suffused with blood, and
the hand which he did not need for his support wandered
towards the hilt of his sword.</P>
<P>&quot;My lord,&quot; said the queen, &quot;permit me to observe that I
agree in every particular with the Duke of Norfolk; if the
heavens, instead of being clouded as they are at the present
moment, were perfectly serene and propitious, we can still
afford to bestow a few hours upon the officer who has
conducted us so successfully, and with such extreme
attention, to the French coast, where he is to take leave of
us.&quot;</P>
<P>Buckingham, instead of replying, seemed to seek counsel from
the expression of Madame's face. She, however,
half-concealed beneath the thick curtains of the velvet and
gold which sheltered her, had not listened to the
discussion, having been occupied in watching the Comte de
Guiche, who was conversing with Raoul. This was a fresh
misfortune for Buckingham, who fancied he perceived in
Madame Henrietta's look a deeper feeling than that of
curiosity. He withdrew, almost tottering in his gait, and
nearly stumbled against the mainmast of the ship.</P>
<P>&quot;The duke has not acquired a steady footing yet,&quot; said the
queen-mother, in French, &quot;and that may possibly be his
reason for wishing to find himself on firm land again.&quot;</P>
<P>The young man overheard this remark, turned suddenly pale,
and, letting his hands fall in great discouragement by his
side, drew aside, mingling in one sigh his old affection and
his new hatreds. The admiral, however, without taking any
further notice of the duke's ill-humor, led the princesses
into the quarter-deck cabin, where dinner had been served
with a magnificence worthy in every respect of his guests.
The admiral seated himself at the right hand of the
princess, and placed the Comte de Guiche on her left. This
was the place Buckingham usually occupied; and when he
entered the cabin, how profound was his unhappiness to see
himself banished by etiquette from the presence of his
sovereign, to a position inferior to that which, by rank, he
was entitled to. De Guiche, on the other hand, paler still
perhaps from happiness, than his rival was from anger,
seated himself tremblingly next the princess, whose silken
robe, as it lightly touched him, caused a tremor of mingled
regret and happiness to pass through his whole frame. The
repast finished, Buckingham darted forward to hand Madame
Henrietta from the table; but this time it was De Guiche's
turn to give the duke a lesson. &quot;Have the goodness, my lord,
from this moment,&quot; said he, &quot;not to interpose between her
royal highness and myself. From this moment, indeed, her
royal highness belongs to France, and when she deigns to
honor me by touching my hand it is the hand of Monsieur, the
brother of the king of France, she touches.&quot;</P>
<P>And saying this, he presented his hand to Madame Henrietta
with such marked deference, and at the same time with a
nobleness of mien so intrepid, that a murmur of admiration
rose from the English, whilst a groan of despair escaped
from Buckingham's lips. Raoul, who loved, comprehended it
all. He fixed upon his friend one of those profound looks
which a bosom friend or mother can alone extend, either as
protector or guardian, over the one who is about to stray
from the right path. Towards two o'clock in the afternoon
the sun shone forth anew, the wind subsided, the sea became
smooth as a crystal mirror, and the fog, which had shrouded
the coast, disappeared like a veil withdrawn from before it.
The smiling hills of France appeared in full view with their
numerous white houses rendered more conspicuous by the
bright green of the trees or the clear blue sky.</P></article>
