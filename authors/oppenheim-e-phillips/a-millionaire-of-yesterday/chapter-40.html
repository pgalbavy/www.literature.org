A little earlier than usual next morning Trent was at his office in
the City, prepared for the worst, and in less than half an hour he
found himself face to face with one of those crises known to most
great financiers at some time or other during their lives.  His
credit was not actually assailed, but it was suspended.  The general
public did not understand the situation, even those who were in a
measure behind the scenes found it hard to believe that the attack
upon the Bekwando Gold and Land shares was purely a personal one.
For it was Da Souza who had fired the train, who had flung his large
holding of shares upon the market, and, finding them promptly taken
up, had gone about with many pious exclamations of thankfulness and
sinister remarks.  Many smaller holders followed suit, and yet never
for a moment did the market waver.  Gradually it leaked out that
Scarlett Trent was the buyer, and public interest leaped up at once.
Would Trent be able to face settling-day without putting his vast
holdings upon the market?  If so the bulls were going to have the
worst knock they had had for years - and yet - and yet - the murmur
went round from friend to friend - " Sell your Bekwandos."
<P>
At midday there came an urgent message from Trent's bankers, and
as he read it he cursed.  It was short but eloquent.
<P>
"DEAR SIR, - We notice that your account to-day stands 119,000
pounds overdrawn, against which we hold as collateral security shares
in the Bekwando Land Company to the value of 150,000 pounds.  As we
have received certain very disquieting information concerning the
value of these shares, we must ask you to adjust the account before
closing hours to-day, or we shall be compelled to place the shares
upon the market.
                                         "Yours truly,
                                    "A.  SINCLAIR, General Manager."
<P>
Trent tore the letter into atoms, but he never quailed.  Telegraph
and telephone worked his will, he saw all callers, a cigar in his
mouth and flower in his buttonhole, perfectly at his ease, sanguine
and confident.  A few minutes before closing time he strolled into
the bank and no one noticed a great bead of perspiration which stood
out upon his forehead.  He made out a credit slip for 119,000 pounds,
and, passing it across the counter with a roll of notes and cheques,
asked for his shares.
<P>
They sent for the manager.  Trent was ushered with much ceremony
into his private room.  The manager was flushed and nervous.
<P>
"I am afraid you must have misunderstood my note, Mr. Trent," he
stammered.  But Trent, remembering all that he had gone through to
raise the money, stopped him short.
<P>
"This is not a friendly call, Mr. Sinclair," he said, "but simply
a matter of business.  I wish to clear my account with you to the
last halfpenny, and I will take my shares away with me.  I have
paid in the amount I owe.  Let one of your clerks make out the
interest account."
<P>
The manager rang the bell for the key of the security safe.  He
opened it and took out the shares with fingers which trembled a
good deal.
<P>
"Did I understand you, Mr. Trent, that you desired to absolutely
close the account?" he asked.
<P>
"Most decidedly," Trent answered.
<P>
"We shall be very sorry to lose you."
<P>
"The sorrow will be all on your side, then," Trent answered grimly.
"You have done your best to ruin me, you and that blackguard Da
Souza, who brought me here.  If you had succeeded in lumping those
shares upon the market to-day or to-morrow, you know very well what
the result would have been.  I don't know whose game you have been
playing, but I can guess!"
<P>
"I can assure you, Mr. Trent," the manager declared in his suavest
and most professional manner, "that you are acting under a complete
misapprehension.  I will admit that our notice was a little short.
Suppose we withdraw it altogether, eh?  I am quite satisfied.  We
will put back the shares in the safe and you shall keep your money."
<P>
"No, I'm d - d if you do!" Trent answered bluntly.  "You've had your
money and I'll have the shares.  I don't leave this bank without
them, and I'll be shot if ever I enter it again."
<P>
So Trent, with his back against the wall and not a friend to help
him, faced for twenty-four hours the most powerful bull syndicate
which had ever been formed against a single Company.  Inquiries as
to his right of title had poured in upon him, and to all of them
he had returned the most absolute and final assurances.  Yet he knew
when closing-time came, that he had exhausted every farthing he
possessed in the world - it seemed hopeless to imagine that he could
survive another day.  But with the morning came a booming cable from
Bekwando.  There had been a great find of gold before ever a shaft
had been sunk; an expert, from whom as yet nothing had been heard,
wired an excited and wonderful report.  Then the men who had held
on to their Bekwandos rustled their morning papers and walked
smiling to their offices.  Prices leaped up.  Trent's directors
ceased to worry him and wired invitations to luncheon at the West
End.  The bulls were the sport of everybody.  When closing-time came
Trent had made 100,000 pounds, and was looked upon everywhere as one
of the rocks of finance.
<P>
Only then he began to realise what the strain had been to him.  His
hard, impassive look had never altered, he had been seen everywhere
in his accustomed City haunts, his hat a little better brushed than
usual, his clothes a little more carefully put on, his buttonhole
more obvious and his laugh readier.  No one guessed the agony through
which he had passed, no one knew that he had spent the night at a
little inn twelve miles away, to which he had walked after nine
o'clock at night.  He had not a single confidant, even his cashier
had no idea whence came the large sums of money which he had paid
away right and left.  But when it was all over he left the City,
and, leaning back in the corner of his little brougham, was driven
away to Pont Street.  Here he locked himself in his room, took off
his coat and threw himself upon a sofa with a big cigar between
his teeth.
<P>
"If you let any one in to see me, Miles," he told the footman, "I'll
kick you out of the house."  So, though the bell rang often, he
remained alone.  But as he lay there with half-closed eyes living
again through the tortures of the last few hours, he heard a voice
that startled him.  It was surely hers - already!  He sprang up and
opened the door.  Ernestine and Captain Francis were in the hall.
<P>
He motioned them to follow him into the room.  Ernestine was flushed
and her eyes were very bright.  She threw up her veil and faced him
haughtily.  "Where is he?" she asked.  "I know everything.  I insist
upon seeing him at once."
<P>
"That," he said coolly, "will depend upon whether he is fit to see
you!"
<P>
He rang the bell.
<P>
"Tell Miss Fullagher to step this way a moment," he ordered.
<P>
"He is in this house, then," she cried.  He took no notice.  In a
moment a young woman dressed in the uniform of one of the principal
hospitals entered.
<P>
"Miss Fullagher," he asked, "how is the patient?"
<P>
"We've had a lot of trouble with him, sir," she said significantly.
"He was terrible all last night, and he's very weak this morning.
Is this the young lady, sir?"
<P>
"This is the young lady who I told you would want to see him when
you thought it advisable."
<P>
The nurse looked doubtful.  "Sir Henry is upstairs, sir," she said.
"I had better ask his advice."
<P>
Trent nodded and she withdrew.  The three were left alone, Ernestine
and Francis remained apart as though by design.  Trent was silent.
<P>
She returned in a moment or two.
<P>
"Sir Henry has not quite finished his examination, sir," she
announced.  "The young lady can come up in half an hour."
<P>
Again they were left alone.  Then Trent crossed the room and stood
between them and the door.
<P>
"Before you see your father, Miss Wendermott," he said, "I have an
explanation to make to you!"
