<p>Larry Murphy was in no mood for trifling. He had spared Arqu-wao
twice, and he did not mean to do it again.</p>

<p>He noticed his suspicious action, and raising the hammer of his
rifle, he held the weapon half lifted to his shoulder, while he
kept his threatening gaze fixed upon the guide, who was equally
intent in watching him.</p>

<p>The Irish youth understood what he must do in order to discharge
the arrow, and all he was waiting for was to detect the first
preliminary movement on the part of the singular being.</p>

<p>"Drink away, Whart," he replied; "he won't fool me."</p>

<p>With no fear, the younger lad knelt down and drank deep from
the cool, refreshing brook. Then he rose to his feet, replaced
his cap, and picked up his gun.</p>

<p>"I don't think he'll fool me either," he quietly remarked, imitating
the attitude of his companion.</p>

<p>"I believe he's up to some mischief," remarked Larry, who, nevertheless,
fully slaked his thirst before rising to his feet.</p>

<p>The few moments thus occupied were trying to Wharton Edwards,
who was suspicious of the Indian. He could not explain his peculiar
position on any theory other than that he was seeking a chance
to use his bow against them. He believed that if he once removed
his gaze from the Indian, that instant he would drive an arrow
through his body, and then launch another at Larry before he could
rise or bring his gun to bear.</p>

<p>Needless to say, therefore, he closely watched the Shawanoe until
Larry stood at his side.</p>

<p>"Lead on," said Wharton, with a wave of his hand, "and don't
walk quite so fast."</p>

<p>"Me walk just so," replied Arqu-wao, accommodating his gait to
that of his captors.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to make of him," remarked Wharton, when the
advance was resumed. "I have half a mind to take his bow away
from him."</p>

<p>"Ye haven't observed him doing anything wrong yet," was the response
of Larry.</p>

<p>"What of his manner just now?"</p>

<p>"It looked bad, but we ain't sartin that it meant anything at
all."</p>

<p>"We would be more certain if he had no weapon."</p>

<p>"Hold on a bit; if we stop for dinner or anything else, we won't
give him a chance. I think, between ourselves, we can watch him
so sharp that he won't do any harrum."</p>

<p>Wharton consented to this arrangement, though he could not free
himself of a strong misgiving in doing so.</p>

<p>Arqu-wao continued his guidance as though no thought of anything
but the strictest loyalty to his captors had ever entered his
brain, all awry with its unimaginable fancies.</p>

<p>Perhaps there had not. The truth must become known before the
set of sun.</p>

<p>At intervals the guide turned his head far enough to glance back,
but this was so evidently for the purpose of learning whether
his pace was satisfactory that no suspicion was excited. His conduct
could not have been more satisfactory, so far as appearances went.</p>

<p>The party were abroad in the woods, and the youths had only a
very general idea of where they were. They had made many windings
and turnings, and at last had forsaken the only reliable guide&mdash;the
gorge&mdash;by which to find their way back to the trail.</p>

<p>This, as we have shown, was a matter of no moment, provided the
Shawanoe was not meditating treachery against them; but how easy
for him, if he chose, to lead them into a trap.</p>

<p>"Halloo, what's up now?" asked Wharton.</p>

<p>"Hold your gun ready!"</p>

<p>The Indian had come to a sudden stop, and, looking back, raised
one hand, which the lads accepted as a request for them also to
halt. They obeyed him.</p>

<p>Standing thus, with his body as rigid as iron, Arqu-wao slowly
turned his head so as to look at each point of the compass in
turn. Those behind him did the same, not forgetting to use their
hearing as best they could, but with no result.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe next knelt down and applied his ear to the ground,
as his people do when suspecting the nearness of an enemy whom
their eyes fail to detect. It was possible, of course, that this
pantomime was part of a carefully laid plan to put them off their
guard. If so, though cleverly done, it failed to succeed.</p>

<p>The result of the guide's test seemed to be satisfactory, for
he quietly assumed the perpendicular again and resumed his walk.
He did not look back, evidently concluding that they knew enough
to follow without any direction from him.</p>

<p>"Larry," whispered his friend, "let's fall a little more to the
rear, so that, if he tries any of his tricks, we'll have a better
chance for ourselves."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of the same thing," said the other, acting at
once upon the suggestion.</p>

<p>They doubled the space heretofore separating them from the guide,
who took no notice, apparently, of the change in their relative
situations.</p>

<p>The thought in the minds of the boys was that, if Arqu-wao should
attempt to take them into a camp of their enemies, or to reveal
them to a war party, or, in fact, to attempt any form of betrayal,
they would have a much better chance of saving themselves by a
rapid retreat. They might well doubt whether the prospect of their
guide benefiting them was worth all their mental disquiet. It
is probable that, had they taken more time to consider the matter
at the beginning, they would have disarmed the Shawanoe and allowed
him to go in peace.</p>

<p>All at once he made a sharp turn to the left. As he did so, he
looked around, so that his face was in full view, and to the amazement
of the lads they saw a distinct grin upon it.</p>

<p>"That's the first time he has tried to smile," remarked Larry,
"and I'm afeered of it."</p>

<p>"Don't you understand what it means?" asked his friend a minute
later.</p>

<p>"No, do you?"</p>

<p>"There it is."</p>

<p>As Wharton spoke he pointed to the ground in front. Larry at
once saw the significance of the words. They were following a
distinctly marked trail.</p>

<p>"But is it the right one?" whispered Wharton.</p>
