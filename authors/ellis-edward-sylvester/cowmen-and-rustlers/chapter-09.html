<p>Brother and sister were astounded. The hour was late, and they
had been urging their guest to remain several days with them.
He had not consented, nor had he refused, from which they were
confident he would stay.</p>

<p>And now he announced his intention of departing at once, riding
out into the night&mdash;whither?</p>

<p>They protested, but he replied so earnestly that an urgent necessity
existed that they refrained. He gave no hint of the reason for
his strange action, and they could not ask it. His fleet mare,
which had been allowed to graze on the succulent grass at the
rear of the building with the other horses, was brought forward
and saddled and bridled, and he quickly vaulted upon her back.</p>

<p>"Remember me to your mother; it is not worth while to disturb
her; I hope soon to be with you again."</p>

<p>He leaned over and pressed the hand of Fred Whitney, and then,
raising his hat with his left hand, extended the right to Jennie.</p>

<p>Fred made an excuse to move away a few paces, for he understood
the situation.</p>

<p>"Good-by," Sterry said in a voice just low enough to reach the
dear one, as he pressed the delicate hand which rested so trustingly
in his own.</p>

<p>"Good-by," she answered. "I am sorry you are going."</p>

<p>"So am I, but it is better that I should leave. As I said, I
trust soon to see you again. Do you know why I hope Fred will
decide to return to the East with you and your mother?"</p>

<p>"I suppose because we shall all be safer there;" and then she
added, forgetting her sorrow for the moment, "that is if we do
not go skating to Wolf Glen."</p>

<p>"It is not necessary to remove as far as Maine, but father insists
that I am wasting time here, when I ought to be home studying
my profession."</p>

<p>"And he is right, Monteith."</p>

<p>"But," he replied in a low voice, "before I go back I want to
make sure that you will do the same. There, good-by again."</p>

<p>He replaced his hat, wheeled and dashed across the prairie without
another word.</p>

<p>Jennie stood gazing in the direction taken by him for some time
after he had disappeared in the gloom of the night. Then she turned
to speak to her brother, but he had passed within the house. She
resumed her seat, knowing he would soon return.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes and more went by and she was still alone.</p>

<p>Sh! Was she mistaken, or was that the faint sound of a horse's
hoofs in the distance?</p>

<p>She turned her head and listened. The murmur of voices, as her
brother and mother talked in low tones, did not disturb her, and
the almost inaudible lowing of the cattle on the distant ranges
was but a part of silence itself.</p>

<p>Hardly a breath of air was stirring, but all knew the eccentric
way in which sound is sometimes carried by it. Suddenly the reports
of rifle-firing were heard, faint but distinct, and lasting several
minutes. Then other and different noises reached her, still faint
but clear.</p>

<p>Her power of hearing, like her vision, was exceptionally strong.
It was that which enabled her to tell that the last sounds were
not made by a single animal, but by several going at a high rate
of speed. These, with the reports of rifles, made her certain
that the rustlers had attacked Sterry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the young man found matters exceedingly lively.</p>

<p>The reception of the "warning" through the hands of Fred Whitney
was proof that his enemies knew he was frequently at his house.
Their messenger had gone thither to deliver it. Young Whitney
had slain one of their number, and though the law-breakers themselves
had suffered the most, they felt bitter resentment toward the
family.</p>

<p>If Sterry remained with them they would have trouble. He was
satisfied that Larch Cadmus recognized him, as he sat in front
of the rancher's house, and would not forget to tell it to his
comrades, who would speedily make the place a visit. He believed
they were likely to do it before the rise of the morrow's sun.</p>

<p>If the Whitneys were attacked, his presence would add to the
defensive strength, but such an attack would not be made if he
was not there. Desperate and defiant as the rustlers had been,
it would be an injustice to represent them as capable of such
wantonness.</p>

<p>He felt, therefore, that it was his duty to leave the ranch without
delay, thus removing an element of grave danger. It would have
been hardly wise to make this explanation to them, though he believed
Fred suspected it.</p>

<p>Turning his back, therefore, upon the dearest spot in all the
West to him, he set his mare Queenie on an easy, swift gallop,
heading southward toward the ranges where the cattle of the Whitneys
were grazing.</p>

<p>Sterry, in one sense, was without a home as long as he remained
in Wyoming or Montana, while in another sense he was the owner
of numberless dwelling-places or "headquarters." He may be likened
to a commercial traveller in a vast and sparsely-settled region,
where he is well known and welcomed by the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The ranchmen who knew him&mdash;and there were few who did not&mdash;were
his friends, for he was working in their interests. At whichever
cabin he drew rein he was certain of a hospitable reception.</p>

<p>With no clearly defined idea of where he would spend the remaining
hours of the night, he turned the nose of Queenie toward the ranges,
among the mountain spurs.</p>

<p>Grizzly Weber and Budd Hankinson would stay near the cattle for
an indefinite time, and he was debating whether to join them or
to ride on to the ranch of Dick Hawkridge, a number of miles to
the northeast, when his meditations were broken in upon in the
most startling manner.</p>

<p>During those perilous times, the lonely horseman, in a dangerous
region, relies much on his intelligent steed for warning. While
Monteith Sterry could do a great deal of thinking in the saddle,
he was too alert to drop into a brown study that would divert
his thoughts from his surroundings.</p>

<p>He was no more than a mile from the Whitney ranch when his mare
pricked up her ears, gave an almost inaudible whinny, and slightly
slackened her pace.</p>

<p>That meant that she scented danger, and her rider was on the
<em>qui vive</em>.</p>

<p>He tightened the rein and drew her to a full stop. She turned
her head to the right and looked steadily in that direction, with
her pretty ears thrown forward. This meant that whatever impended
was coming from that point of the compass.</p>

<p>But the keen eyes of Mont Sterry could not penetrate the moonlight
sufficiently far to detect anything. He was out of the saddle
in a twinkling, and tried a trick learned from the old hunters.
He pressed one ear against the ground, which, as all know, is
a much better conductor of sound than the air.</p>

<p>This told the story he anticipated. The faint but distinct clamping
of horses' hoofs was heard. The number was indefinite, but, somewhat
to his surprise, none of them was running or loping; all were
moving on a walk.</p>

<p>The noise was so clear that when he rose to his feet and looked
off to the right he expected to see the animals and their riders,
and he was not disappointed.</p>

<p>On the outer margin of the field of vision the outlines of several
horsemen assumed shape. They were approaching, and one of their
steeds emitted a whinny, as a salutation to the motionless Queenie,
who had shifted her pose so as to face that point of the compass.</p>

<p>"Sh!" whispered Sterry to her.</p>

<p>But there was no call for the warning; she was too well trained
to betray her master, and remained mute.</p>

<p>But it was inevitable that if the young man could discern the
figures of the approaching horsemen, they must also see him. He
leaped into the saddle and turned away.</p>

<p>He knew instinctively they were rustlers, and he was almost equally
certain they were hunting for him. There were at least three;
and, well aware of their character, he was only prudent in shying
off, with the intention of avoiding them altogether.</p>

<p>But they were not the men to be bluffed in that fashion. They
were "out" for the inspector, and did not intend that such an
opportunity should slip by unchallenged.</p>

<p>"Hello, pard!" called one of the trio, "where from and where
going?"</p>

<p>This was a pointed demand, to which Mont Sterry made an equally
pointed response.</p>

<p>"That is my own business; I will attend to it, and you may attend
to yours."</p>

<p>All this time he was keeping watch of their movements. Their
horses were still walking, but they were now coming straight toward
him. At a touch of the rein Queenie headed directly away, and
her gait was about the same. She acted as though she shared the
thoughts of her master, who shrank from sending her off on a flying
run, as would have been more prudent for him to do.</p>

<p>A brave man dislikes to flee, even when his better judgment tells
him it is the only wise thing to do.</p>

<p>The night was so still that Sterry plainly heard the words of
the men when talking to each other in an ordinary conversational
tone.</p>

<p>"I believe that's him," said one of them, eagerly.</p>

<p>"It sounded like his voice, but he wouldn't leave the Whitneys
at this time of night when she's there."</p>

<p>"He's too free with his tongue, anyway; we'll make him show up."</p>

<p>"Say, you! hold on a minute. Do you know anything about Mont
Sterry? We're looking for him."</p>

<p>"I am Mont Sterry," was the defiant response. "What do you propose
to do about it?"</p>
