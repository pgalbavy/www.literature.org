<p><em>ONE </em>would never have expected to drop from one of the
numberless ways in the catacombs into a city of twenty thousand
inhabitants. However, upon reflection, one would wonder why men,
taken out of their natural environment, would not be susceptible
to the same natural changes as the animals.</p>

<p>Arajo relates to us how he saw flocks of blind ducks come out
of the caverns of the subterranean lake of Zirhnitz. One is bound
to believe that these ducks were the products of ducks which once
saw clearly, but which were shut up by some accident in the bowels
of the earth, in the midst of obscure waters. And so there is
some logic in the theory that if the family of a man in the first
years of the fourteenth century was by accident confined in the
catacombs, it would live there and produce offspring. At the end
of the third generation they would have forgotten the existence
of the open world. Of course they would continue to speak the
language, and as no strange element would mix with it, it would
preserve its purity through centuries.</p>

<p>Then in the darkness they would lose the use of their eyes, but
develop their sense of touch as blind men do. Hence the excess
of digits on their hands and feet. Then the loss of one sense
always develops all the other senses in proportion. After centuries
these super-developed senses become abnormal, and the nose and
ears develop accordingly in size.</p>

<p>And so it was with these people of the Talfa. Their features
had developed to an extraordinary extent, and their idea of beauty
in the human form was based on the excessive development of these
features. Demoiselle de Coucy was considered the most beautiful
of all the Talfa.</p>

<p>They had entered the large meeting room, and M. Mifroid attempted
to again light his lamp, but the crowd cried out in such disgust
that he was persuaded to keep it out. He endeavored to converse
with those near by. Their names were among the most illustrious
in France at the time of the Battle of Crecy. But they addressed
themselves in a tone so ineffably sweet, and all the uproar they
tried to make resulted in an enchanting murmur. It was difficult
to imagine that such sweet and honeyed words could emanate from
such ugly beings.</p>

<p>M. Mifroid was seated on a chair next to Lady Jane de Montfort,
who continually felt his face and touched his ears. While her
curiosity was great she approached him with such delicate gracefulness
that he hadn’t the heart to restrain her.</p>

<p>Soon there was a great silence, and a concert began. To Mifroid
and Théophraste nothing was to be heard. Occasionally the people
applauded quietly, but the absolute silence of the performers
was a striking feature. Not a word was heard.</p>

<p>Soon there was much talking again around the two men, and they
learned that it was intended that they should go down on the stage.
This was the reason why they had been dragged to the meeting hall.
They were to be exhibited as a phenomenon. Théophraste willingly
consented, as his companion had promised him a good duck for dinner.
M. Mifroid was not so easily persuaded, but at last acquiesced,
and they descended to the stage. They all clamored for a song,
and M. Mifroid started one of the old French songs of the fourteenth
century, which he had learned as a boy. He had hardly started
the first verse, when everybody in the hall called out for him
to sing lower.</p>

<p>He started again, this time moderating his voice, but again they
called to him to sing lower. The third time he could hardly hear
himself, so low was his voice, but this did not satisfy his audience,
and he left the platform with his song unfinished. He afterward
learned that the sense of hearing of these people was so developed
that they could understand silent music.</p>
