I come to the most evasive and difficult part of my story, which is 
to tell how Isabel and I have made a common wreck of our joint 
lives.
<P>
It is not the telling of one simple disastrous accident.  There was 
a vein in our natures that led to this collapse, gradually and at 
this point and that it crept to the surface.  One may indeed see our 
destruction--for indeed politically we could not be more extinct if 
we had been shot dead--in the form of a catastrophe as disconnected 
and conclusive as a meteoric stone falling out of heaven upon two 
friends and crushing them both.  But I do not think that is true to 
our situation or ourselves.  We were not taken by surprise.  The 
thing was in us and not from without, it was akin to our way of 
thinking and our habitual attitudes; it had, for all its impulsive 
effect, a certain necessity.  We might have escaped no doubt, as two 
men at a hundred yards may shoot at each other with pistols for a 
considerable time and escape.  But it isn't particularly reasonable 
to talk of the contrariety of fate if they both get hit.
<P>
Isabel and I were dangerous to each other for several years of 
friendship, and not quite unwittingly so.
<P>
In writing this, moreover, there is a very great difficulty in 
steering my way between two equally undesirable tones in the 
telling.  In the first place I do not want to seem to confess my 
sins with a penitence I am very doubtful if I feel.  Now that I have 
got Isabel we can no doubt count the cost of it and feel 
unquenchable regrets, but I am not sure whether, if we could be put 
back now into such circumstances as we were in a year ago, or two 
years ago, whether with my eyes fully open I should not do over 
again very much as I did.  And on the other hand I do not want to 
justify the things we have done.  We are two bad people--if there is 
to be any classification of good and bad at all, we have acted 
badly, and quite apart from any other considerations we've largely 
wasted our own very great possibilities.  But it is part of a queer 
humour that underlies all this, that I find myself slipping again 
and again into a sentimental treatment of our case that is as 
unpremeditated as it is insincere.  When I am a little tired after a 
morning's writing I find the faint suggestion getting into every 
other sentence that our blunders and misdeeds embodied, after the 
fashion of the prophet Hosea, profound moral truths.  Indeed, I feel 
so little confidence in my ability to keep this altogether out of my 
book that I warn the reader here that in spite of anything he may 
read elsewhere in the story, intimating however shyly an esoteric 
and exalted virtue in our proceedings, the plain truth of this 
business is that Isabel and I wanted each other with a want entirely 
formless, inconsiderate, and overwhelming.  And though I could tell 
you countless delightful and beautiful things about Isabel, were 
this a book in her praise, I cannot either analyse that want or 
account for its extreme intensity.
<P>
I will confess that deep in my mind there is a belief in a sort of 
wild rightness about any love that is fraught with beauty, but that 
eludes me and vanishes again, and is not, I feel, to be put with the 
real veracities and righteousnesses and virtues in the paddocks and 
menageries of human reason. . . .
<P>
We have already a child, and Margaret was childless, and I find 
myself prone to insist upon that, as if it was a justification.  
But, indeed, when we became lovers there was small thought of 
Eugenics between us.  Ours was a mutual and not a philoprogenitive 
passion.  Old Nature behind us may have had such purposes with us, 
but it is not for us to annex her intentions by a moralising 
afterthought.  There isn't, in fact, any decent justification for us 
whatever--at that the story must stand.
<P>
But if there is no justification there is at least a very effective 
excuse in the mental confusedness of our time.  The evasion of that 
passionately thorough exposition of belief and of the grounds of 
morality, which is the outcome of the mercenary religious 
compromises of the late Vatican period, the stupid suppression of 
anything but the most timid discussion of sexual morality in our 
literature and drama, the pervading cultivated and protected muddle-
headedness, leaves mentally vigorous people with relatively enormous 
possibilities of destruction and little effective help.  They find 
themselves confronted by the habits and prejudices of manifestly 
commonplace people, and by that extraordinary patched-up 
Christianity, the cult of a "Bromsteadised" deity, diffused, 
scattered, and aimless, which hides from examination and any 
possibility of faith behind the plea of good taste.  A god about 
whom there is delicacy is far worse than no god at all.  We are 
FORCED to be laws unto ourselves and to live experimentally.  It is 
inevitable that a considerable fraction of just that bolder, more 
initiatory section of the intellectual community, the section that 
can least be spared from the collective life in a period of trial 
and change, will drift into such emotional crises and such disaster 
as overtook us.  Most perhaps will escape, but many will go down, 
many more than the world can spare.  It is the unwritten law of all 
our public life, and the same holds true of America, that an honest 
open scandal ends a career.  England in the last quarter of a 
century has wasted half a dozen statesmen on this score; she would, 
I believe, reject Nelson now if he sought to serve her.  Is it 
wonderful that to us fretting here in exile this should seem the 
cruellest as well as the most foolish elimination of a necessary 
social element?  It destroys no vice; for vice hides by nature.  It 
not only rewards dullness as if it were positive virtue, but sets an 
enormous premium upon hypocrisy.  That is my case, and that is why I 
am telling this side of my story with so much explicitness.
<P>

<P>
<P>
Ever since the Kinghamstead election I had maintained what seemed a 
desultory friendship with Isabel.  At first it was rather Isabel 
kept it up than I.  Whenever Margaret and I went down to that villa, 
with its three or four acres of garden and shrubbery about it, which 
fulfilled our election promise to live at Kinghamstead, Isabel would 
turn up in a state of frank cheerfulness, rejoicing at us, and talk 
all she was reading and thinking to me, and stay for all the rest of 
the day.  In her shameless liking for me she was as natural as a 
savage.  She would exercise me vigorously at tennis, while Margaret 
lay and rested her back in the afternoon, or guide me for some long 
ramble that dodged the suburban and congested patches of the 
constituency with amazing skill.  She took possession of me in that 
unabashed, straight-minded way a girl will sometimes adopt with a 
man, chose my path or criticised my game with a motherly solicitude 
for my welfare that was absurd and delightful.  And we talked.  We 
discussed and criticised the stories of novels, scraps of history, 
pictures, social questions, socialism, the policy of the Government.  
She was young and most unevenly informed, but she was amazingly 
sharp and quick and good.  Never before in my life had I known a 
girl of her age, or a woman of her quality.  I had never dreamt 
there was such talk in the world.  Kinghamstead became a lightless 
place when she went to Oxford.  Heaven knows how much that may not 
have precipitated my abandonment of the seat!
<P>
She went to Ridout College, Oxford, and that certainly weighed with 
me when presently after my breach with the Liberals various little 
undergraduate societies began to ask for lectures and discussions.  
I favoured Oxford.  I declared openly I did so because of her.  At 
that time I think we neither of us suspected the possibility of 
passion that lay like a coiled snake in the path before us.  It 
seemed to us that we had the quaintest, most delightful friendship 
in the world; she was my pupil, and I was her guide, philosopher, 
and friend.  People smiled indulgently--even Margaret smiled 
indulgently--at our attraction for one another.
<P>
Such friendships are not uncommon nowadays--among easy-going, 
liberal-minded people.  For the most part, there's no sort of harm, 
as people say, in them.  The two persons concerned are never 
supposed to think of the passionate love that hovers so close to the 
friendship, or if they do, then they banish the thought.  I think we 
kept the thought as permanently in exile as any one could do.  If it 
did in odd moments come into our heads we pretended elaborately it 
wasn't there.
<P>
Only we were both very easily jealous of each other's attention, and 
tremendously insistent upon each other's preference.
<P>
I remember once during the Oxford days an intimation that should 
have set me thinking, and I suppose discreetly disentangling myself.  
It was one Sunday afternoon, and it must have been about May, for 
the trees and shrubs of Ridout College were gay with blossom, and 
fresh with the new sharp greens of spring.  I had walked talking 
with Isabel and a couple of other girls through the wide gardens of 
the place, seen and criticised the new brick pond, nodded to the 
daughter of this friend and that in the hammocks under the trees, 
and picked a way among the scattered tea-parties on the lawn to our 
own circle on the grass under a Siberian crab near the great bay 
window.  There I sat and ate great quantities of cake, and discussed 
the tactics of the Suffragettes.  I had made some comments upon the 
spirit of the movement in an address to the men in Pembroke, and it 
had got abroad, and a group of girls and women dons were now having 
it out with me.
<P>
I forget the drift of the conversation, or what it was made Isabel 
interrupt me.  She did interrupt me.  She bad been lying prone on 
the ground at my right hand, chin on fists, listening thoughtfully, 
and I was sitting beside old Lady Evershead on a garden seat.  I 
turned to Isabel's voice, and saw her face uplifted, and her dear 
cheeks and nose and forehead all splashed and barred with sunlight 
and the shadows of the twigs of the trees behind me.  And something--
an infinite tenderness, stabbed me.  It was a keen physical 
feeling, like nothing I had ever felt before.  It had a quality of 
tears in it.  For the first time in my narrow and concentrated life 
another human being had really thrust into my being and gripped my 
very heart.
<P>
Our eyes met perplexed for an extraordinary moment.  Then I turned 
back and addressed myself a little stiffly to the substance of her 
intervention.  For some time I couldn't look at her again.
<P>
From that time forth I knew I loved Isabel beyond measure.
<P>
Yet it is curious that it never occurred to me for a year or so that 
this was likely to be a matter of passion between us.  I have told 
how definitely I put my imagination into harness in those matters at 
my marriage, and I was living now in a world of big interests, where 
there is neither much time nor inclination for deliberate love-
making.  I suppose there is a large class of men who never meet a 
girl or a woman without thinking of sex, who meet a friend's 
daughter and decide: "Mustn't get friendly with her--wouldn't DO," 
and set invisible bars between themselves and all the wives in the 
world.  Perhaps that is the way to live.  Perhaps there is no other 
method than this effectual annihilation of half--and the most 
sympathetic and attractive half--of the human beings in the world, 
so far as any frank intercourse is concerned.  I am quite convinced 
anyhow that such a qualified intimacy as ours, such a drifting into 
the sense of possession, such untrammeled conversation with an 
invisible, implacable limit set just where the intimacy glows, it is 
no kind of tolerable compromise.  If men and women are to go so far 
together, they must be free to go as far as they may want to go, 
without the vindictive destruction that has come upon us.  On the 
basis of the accepted codes the jealous people are right, and the 
liberal-minded ones are playing with fire.  If people are not to 
love, then they must be kept apart.  If they are not to be kept 
apart, then we must prepare for an unprecedented toleration of 
lovers.
<P>
Isabel was as unforeseeing as I to begin with, but sex marches into 
the life of an intelligent girl with demands and challenges far more 
urgent than the mere call of curiosity and satiable desire that 
comes to a young man.  No woman yet has dared to tell the story of 
that unfolding.  She attracted men, and she encouraged them, and 
watched them, and tested them, and dismissed them, and concealed the 
substance of her thoughts about them in the way that seems 
instinctive in a natural-minded girl.  There was even an engagement--
amidst the protests and disapproval of the college authorities.  I 
never saw the man, though she gave me a long history of the affair, 
to which I listened with a forced and insincere sympathy.  She 
struck me oddly as taking the relationship for a thing in itself, 
and regardless of its consequences.  After a time she became silent 
about him, and then threw him over; and by that time, I think, for 
all that she was so much my junior, she knew more about herself and 
me than I was to know for several years to come.
<P>
We didn't see each other for some months after my resignation, but 
we kept up a frequent correspondence.  She said twice over that she 
wanted to talk to me, that letters didn't convey what one wanted to 
say, and I went up to Oxford pretty definitely to see her--though I 
combined it with one or two other engagements--somewhere in 
February.  Insensibly she had become important enough for me to make 
journeys for her.
<P>
But we didn't see very much of one another on that occasion.  There 
was something in the air between us that made a faint embarrassment; 
the mere fact, perhaps, that she had asked me to come up.
<P>
A year before she would have dashed off with me quite unscrupulously 
to talk alone, carried me off to her room for an hour with a minute 
of chaperonage to satisfy the rules.  Now there was always some one 
or other near us that it seemed impossible to exorcise.
<P>
We went for a walk on the Sunday afternoon with old Fortescue, K. 
C., who'd come up to see his two daughters, both great friends of 
Isabel's, and some mute inglorious don whose name I forget, but who 
was in a state of marked admiration for her.  The six of us played a 
game of conversational entanglements throughout, and mostly I was 
impressing the Fortescue girls with the want of mental concentration 
possible in a rising politician.  We went down Carfex, I remember, 
to Folly Bridge, and inspected the Barges, and then back by way of 
Merton to the Botanic Gardens and Magdalen Bridge.  And in the 
Botanic Gardens she got almost her only chance with me.
<P>
"Last months at Oxford," she said.
<P>
"And then?" I asked.
<P>
"I'm coming to London," she said.
<P>
"To write?"
<P>
She was silent for a moment.  Then she said abruptly, with that 
quick flush of hers and a sudden boldness in her eyes: "I'm going to 
work with you.  Why shouldn't I?"
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
Here, again, I suppose I had a fair warning of the drift of things.  
I seem to remember myself in the train to Paddington, sitting with a 
handful of papers--galley proofs for the BLUE WEEKLY, I suppose--on 
my lap, and thinking about her and that last sentence of hers, and 
all that it might mean to me.
<P>
It is very hard to recall even the main outline of anything so 
elusive as a meditation.  I know that the idea of working with her 
gripped me, fascinated me.  That my value in her life seemed growing 
filled me with pride and a kind of gratitude.  I was already in no 
doubt that her value in my life was tremendous.  It made it none the 
less, that in those days I was obsessed by the idea that she was 
transitory, and bound to go out of my life again.  It is no good 
trying to set too fine a face upon this complex business, there is 
gold and clay and sunlight and savagery in every love story, and a 
multitude of elvish elements peeped out beneath the fine rich 
curtain of affection that masked our future.  I've never properly 
weighed how immensely my vanity was gratified by her clear 
preference for me.  Nor can I for a moment determine how much 
deliberate intention I hide from myself in this affair.
<P>
Certainly I think some part of me must have been saying in the 
train: "Leave go of her.  Get away from her.  End this now."  I 
can't have been so stupid as not to have had that in my mind. . . .
<P>
If she had been only a beautiful girl in love with me, I think I 
could have managed the situation.  Once or twice since my marriage 
and before Isabel became of any significance in my life, there had 
been incidents with other people, flashes of temptation--no telling 
is possible of the thing resisted.  I think that mere beauty and 
passion would not have taken me.  But between myself and Isabel 
things were incurably complicated by the intellectual sympathy we 
had, the jolly march of our minds together.  That has always 
mattered enormously.  I should have wanted her company nearly as 
badly if she had been some crippled old lady; we would have hunted 
shoulder to shoulder, as two men.  Only two men would never have had 
the patience and readiness for one another we two had.  I had never 
for years met any one with whom I could be so carelessly sure of 
understanding or to whom I could listen so easily and fully.  She 
gave me, with an extraordinary completeness, that rare, precious 
effect of always saying something fresh, and yet saying it so that 
it filled into and folded about all the little recesses and corners 
of my mind with an infinite, soft familiarity.  It is impossible to 
explain that.  It is like trying to explain why her voice, her voice 
heard speaking to any one--heard speaking in another room--pleased 
my ears.
<P>
She was the only Oxford woman who took a first that year.  She spent 
the summer in Scotland and Yorkshire, writing to me continually of 
all she now meant to do, and stirring my imagination.  She came to 
London for the autumn session.  For a time she stayed with old Lady 
Colbeck, but she fell out with her hostess when it became clear she 
wanted to write, not novels, but journalism, and then she set every 
one talking by taking a flat near Victoria and installing as her 
sole protector an elderly German governess she had engaged through a 
scholastic agency.  She began writing, not in that copious flood the 
undisciplined young woman of gifts is apt to produce, but in exactly 
the manner of an able young man, experimenting with forms, 
developing the phrasing of opinions, taking a definite line.  She 
was, of course, tremendously discussed.  She was disapproved of, but 
she was invited out to dinner.  She got rather a reputation for the 
management of elderly distinguished men.  It was an odd experience 
to follow Margaret's soft rustle of silk into some big drawing-room 
and discover my snub-nosed girl in the blue sack transformed into a 
shining creature in the soft splendour of pearls and ivory-white and 
lace, and with a silver band about her dusky hair.
<P>
For a time we did not meet very frequently, though always she 
professed an unblushing preference for my company, and talked my 
views and sought me out.  Then her usefulness upon the BLUE WEEKLY 
began to link us closelier.  She would come up to the office, and 
sit by the window, and talk over the proofs of the next week's 
articles, going through my intentions with a keen investigatory 
scalpel.  Her talk always puts me in mind of a steel blade.  Her 
writing became rapidly very good; she had a wit and a turn of the 
phrase that was all her own.  We seemed to have forgotten the little 
shadow of embarrassment that had fallen over our last meeting at 
Oxford.  Everything seemed natural and easy between us in those 
days; a little unconventional, but that made it all the brighter.
<P>
We developed something like a custom of walks, about once a week or 
so, and letters and notes became frequent.  I won't pretend things 
were not keenly personal between us, but they had an air of being 
innocently mental.  She used to call me "Master" in our talks, a 
monstrous and engaging flattery, and I was inordinately proud to 
have her as my pupil.  Who wouldn't have been?  And we went on at 
that distance for a long time--until within a year of the Handitch 
election.
<P>
After Lady Colbeck threw her up as altogether too "intellectual" for 
comfortable control, Isabel was taken up by the Balfes in a less 
formal and compromising manner, and week-ended with them and their 
cousin Leonora Sparling, and spent large portions of her summer with 
them in Herefordshire.  There was a lover or so in that time, men 
who came a little timidly at this brilliant young person with the 
frank manner and the Amazonian mind, and, she declared, received her 
kindly refusals with manifest relief.  And Arnold Shoesmith struck 
up a sort of friendship that oddly imitated mine.  She took a liking 
to him because he was clumsy and shy and inexpressive; she embarked 
upon the dangerous interest of helping him to find his soul.  I had 
some twinges of jealousy about that.  I didn't see the necessity of 
him.  He invaded her time, and I thought that might interfere with 
her work.  If their friendship stole some hours from Isabel's 
writing, it did not for a long while interfere with our walks or our 
talks, or the close intimacy we had together.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
Then suddenly Isabel and I found ourselves passionately in love.
<P>
The change came so entirely without warning or intention that I find 
it impossible now to tell the order of its phases.  What disturbed 
pebble started the avalanche I cannot trace.  Perhaps it was simply 
that the barriers between us and this masked aspect of life had been 
wearing down unperceived.
<P>
And there came a change in Isabel.  It was like some change in the 
cycle of nature, like the onset of spring--a sharp brightness, an 
uneasiness.  She became restless with her work; little encounters 
with men began to happen, encounters not quite in the quality of the 
earlier proposals; and then came an odd incident of which she told 
me, but somehow, I felt, didn't tell me completely.  She told me all 
she was able to tell me.  She had been at a dance at the Ropers', 
and a man, rather well known in London, had kissed her.  The thing 
amazed her beyond measure.  It was the sort of thing immediately 
possible between any man and any woman, that one never expects to 
happen until it happens.  It had the surprising effect of a judge 
generally known to be bald suddenly whipping off his wig in court.  
No absolutely unexpected revelation could have quite the same 
quality of shock.  She went through the whole thing to me with a 
remarkable detachment, told me how she had felt--and the odd things 
it seemed to open to her.
<P>
"I WANT to be kissed, and all that sort of thing," she avowed.  "I 
suppose every woman does."
<P>
She added after a pause: "And I don't want any one to do it."
<P>
This struck me as queerly expressive of the woman's attitude to 
these things.  "Some one presently will--solve that," I said.
<P>
"Some one will perhaps."
<P>
I was silent.
<P>
"Some one will," she said, almost viciously.  "And then we'll have 
to stop these walks and talks of ours, dear Master. . . .  I'll be 
sorry to give them up."
<P>
"It's part of the requirements of the situation," I said, "that he 
should be--oh, very interesting!  He'll start, no doubt, all sorts 
of new topics, and open no end of attractive vistas. . . .  You 
can't, you know, always go about in a state of pupillage."
<P>
"I don't think I can," said Isabel.  "But it's only just recently 
I've begun to doubt about it."
<P>
I remember these things being said, but just how much we saw and 
understood, and just how far we were really keeping opaque to each 
other then, I cannot remember.  But it must have been quite soon 
after this that we spent nearly a whole day together at Kew Gardens, 
with the curtains up and the barriers down, and the thing that had 
happened plain before our eyes.  I don't remember we ever made any 
declaration.  We just assumed the new footing. . . .
<P>
It was a day early in that year--I think in January, because there 
was thin, crisp snow on the grass, and we noted that only two other 
people had been to the Pagoda that day.  I've a curious impression 
of greenish colour, hot, moist air and huge palm fronds about very 
much of our talk, as though we were nearly all the time in the 
Tropical House.  But I also remember very vividly looking at certain 
orange and red spray-like flowers from Patagonia, which could not 
have been there.  It is a curious thing that I do not remember we 
made any profession of passionate love for one another; we talked as 
though the fact of our intense love for each other had always been 
patent between us.  There was so long and frank an intimacy between 
us that we talked far more like brother and sister or husband and 
wife than two people engaged in the war of the sexes.  We wanted to 
know what we were going to do, and whatever we did we meant to do in 
the most perfect concert.  We both felt an extraordinary accession 
of friendship and tenderness then, and, what again is curious, very 
little passion.  But there was also, in spite of the perplexities we 
faced, an immense satisfaction about that day.  It was as if we had 
taken off something that had hindered our view of each other, like 
people who unvizard to talk more easily at a masked ball.
<P>
I've had since to view our relations from the standpoint of the 
ordinary observer.  I find that vision in the most preposterous 
contrast with all that really went on between us.  I suppose there I 
should figure as a wicked seducer, while an unprotected girl 
succumbed to my fascinations.  As a matter of fact, it didn't occur 
to us that there was any personal inequality between us.  I knew her 
for my equal mentally; in so many things she was beyond comparison 
cleverer than I; her courage outwent mine.  The quick leap of her 
mind evoked a flash of joy in mine like the response of an induction 
wire; her way of thinking was like watching sunlight reflected from 
little waves upon the side of a boat, it was so bright, so mobile, 
so variously and easily true to its law.  In the back of our minds 
we both had a very definite belief that making love is full of 
joyous, splendid, tender, and exciting possibilities, and we had to 
discuss why we shouldn't be to the last degree lovers.
<P>
Now, what I should like to print here, if it were possible, in all 
the screaming emphasis of red ink, is this: that the circumstances 
of my upbringing and the circumstances of Isabel's upbringing had 
left not a shadow of belief or feeling that the utmost passionate 
love between us was in itself intrinsically WRONG.  I've told with 
the fullest particularity just all that I was taught or found out 
for myself in these matters, and Isabel's reading and thinking, and 
the fierce silences of her governesses and the breathless warnings 
of teachers, and all the social and religious influences that had 
been brought to bear upon her, had worked out to the same void of 
conviction.  The code had failed with us altogether.  We didn't for 
a moment consider anything but the expediency of what we both, for 
all our quiet faces and steady eyes, wanted most passionately to do.
<P>
Well, here you have the state of mind of whole brigades of people, 
and particularly of young people, nowadays.  The current morality 
hasn't gripped them; they don't really believe in it at all.  They 
may render it lip-service, but that is quite another thing.  There 
are scarcely any tolerable novels to justify its prohibitions; its 
prohibitions do, in fact, remain unjustified amongst these ugly 
suppressions.  You may, if you choose, silence the admission of this 
in literature and current discussion; you will not prevent it 
working out in lives.  People come up to the great moments of 
passion crudely unaware, astoundingly unprepared as no really 
civilised and intelligently planned community would let any one be 
unprepared.  They find themselves hedged about with customs that 
have no organic hold upon them, and mere discretions all generous 
spirits are disposed to despise.
<P>
Consider the infinite absurdities of it!  Multitudes of us are 
trying to run this complex modern community on a basis of "Hush" 
without explaining to our children or discussing with them anything 
about love and marriage at all.  Doubt and knowledge creep about in 
enforced darknesses and silences.  We are living upon an ancient 
tradition which everybody doubts and nobody has ever analysed.  We 
affect a tremendous and cultivated shyness and delicacy about 
imperatives of the most arbitrary appearance.  What ensues?  What 
did ensue with us, for example?  On the one hand was a great desire, 
robbed of any appearance of shame and grossness by the power of 
love, and on the other hand, the possible jealousy of so and so, the 
disapproval of so and so, material risks and dangers.  It is only in 
the retrospect that we have been able to grasp something of the 
effectual case against us.  The social prohibition lit by the 
intense glow of our passion, presented itself as preposterous, 
irrational, arbitrary, and ugly, a monster fit only for mockery.  We 
might be ruined!  Well, there is a phase in every love affair, a 
sort of heroic hysteria, when death and ruin are agreeable additions 
to the prospect.  It gives the business a gravity, a solemnity.  
Timid people may hesitate and draw back with a vague instinctive 
terror of the immensity of the oppositions they challenge, but 
neither Isabel nor I are timid people.
<P>
We weighed what was against us.  We decided just exactly as scores 
of thousands of people have decided in this very matter, that if it 
were possible to keep this thing to ourselves, there was nothing 
against it.  And so we took our first step.  With the hunger of love 
in us, it was easy to conclude we might be lovers, and still keep 
everything to ourselves.  That cleared our minds of the one 
persistent obstacle that mattered to us--the haunting presence of 
Margaret.
<P>
And then we found, as all those scores of thousands of people 
scattered about us have found, that we could not keep it to 
ourselves.  Love will out.  All the rest of this story is the 
chronicle of that.  Love with sustained secrecy cannot be love.  It 
is just exactly the point people do not understand.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
But before things came to that pass, some months and many phases and 
a sudden journey to America intervened.
<P>
"This thing spells disaster," I said.  "You are too big and I am too 
big to attempt this secrecy.  Think of the intolerable possibility 
of being found out!  At any cost we have to stop--even at the cost 
of parting."
<P>
"Just because we may be found out!"
<P>
"Just because we may be found out."
<P>
"Master, I shouldn't in the least mind being found out with you.  
I'm afraid--I'd be proud."
<P>
"Wait till it happens."
<P>
There followed a struggle of immense insincerity between us.  It is 
hard to tell who urged and who resisted.
<P>
She came to me one night to the editorial room of the BLUE WEEKLY, 
and argued and kissed me with wet salt lips, and wept in my arms; 
she told me that now passionate longing for me and my intimate life 
possessed her, so that she could not work, could not think, could 
not endure other people for the love of me. . . .
<P>
I fled absurdly.  That is the secret of the futile journey to 
America that puzzled all my friends.
<P>
I ran away from Isabel.  I took hold of the situation with all my 
strength, put in Britten with sketchy, hasty instructions to edit 
the paper, and started headlong and with luggage, from which, among 
other things, my shaving things were omitted, upon a tour round the 
world.
<P>
Preposterous flight that was!  I remember as a thing almost farcical 
my explanations to Margaret, and how frantically anxious I was to 
prevent the remote possibility of her coming with me, and how I 
crossed in the TUSCAN, a bad, wet boat, and mixed seasickness with 
ungovernable sorrow.  I wept--tears.  It was inexpressibly queer and 
ridiculous--and, good God! how I hated my fellow-passengers!
<P>
New York inflamed and excited me for a time, and when things 
slackened, I whirled westward to Chicago--eating and drinking, I 
remember, in the train from shoals of little dishes, with a sort of 
desperate voracity.  I did the queerest things to distract myself--
no novelist would dare to invent my mental and emotional muddle.  
Chicago also held me at first, amazing lapse from civilisation that 
the place is! and then abruptly, with hosts expecting me, and 
everything settled for some days in Denver, I found myself at the 
end of my renunciations, and turned and came back headlong to 
London.
<P>
Let me confess it wasn't any sense of perfect and incurable trust 
and confidence that brought me back, or any idea that now I had 
strength to refrain.  It was a sudden realisation that after all the 
separation might succeed; some careless phrasing in one of her 
jealously read letters set that idea going in my mind--the haunting 
perception that I might return to London and find it empty of the 
Isabel who had pervaded it.  Honour, discretion, the careers of both 
of us, became nothing at the thought.  I couldn't conceive my life 
resuming there without Isabel.  I couldn't, in short, stand it.
<P>
I don't even excuse my return.  It is inexcusable.  I ought to have 
kept upon my way westward--and held out.  I couldn't.  I wanted 
Isabel, and I wanted her so badly now that everything else in the 
world was phantom-like until that want was satisfied.  Perhaps you 
have never wanted anything like that.  I went straight to her.
<P>
But here I come to untellable things.  There is no describing the 
reality of love.  The shapes of things are nothing, the actual 
happenings are nothing, except that somehow there falls a light upon 
them and a wonder.  Of how we met, and the thrill of the adventure, 
the curious bright sense of defiance, the joy of having dared, I 
can't tell--I can but hint of just one aspect, of what an amazing 
LARK--it's the only word--it seemed to us.  The beauty which was the 
essence of it, which justifies it so far as it will bear 
justification, eludes statement.
<P>
What can a record of contrived meetings, of sundering difficulties 
evaded and overcome, signify here?  Or what can it convey to say 
that one looked deep into two dear, steadfast eyes, or felt a heart 
throb and beat, or gripped soft hair softly in a trembling hand?  
Robbed of encompassing love, these things are of no more value than 
the taste of good wine or the sight of good pictures, or the hearing 
of music,--just sensuality and no more.  No one can tell love--we 
can only tell the gross facts of love and its consequences.  Given 
love--given mutuality, and one has effected a supreme synthesis and 
come to a new level of life--but only those who know can know.  This 
business has brought me more bitterness and sorrow than I had ever 
expected to bear, but even now I will not say that I regret that 
wilful home-coming altogether.  We loved--to the uttermost.  Neither 
of us could have loved any one else as we did and do love one 
another.  It was ours, that beauty; it existed only between us when 
we were close together, for no one in the world ever to know save 
ourselves.
<P>
My return to the office sticks out in my memory with an extreme 
vividness, because of the wild eagle of pride that screamed within 
me.  It was Tuesday morning, and though not a soul in London knew of 
it yet except Isabel, I had been back in England a week.  I came in 
upon Britten and stood in the doorway.
<P>
"GOD!" he said at the sight of me.
<P>
"I'm back," I said.
<P>
He looked at my excited face with those red-brown eyes of his.  
Silently I defied him to speak his mind.
<P>
"Where did you turn back?" he said at last.
<P>
<P>
<P>
6
<P>
<P>
I had to tell what were, so far as I can remember my first positive 
lies to Margaret in explaining that return.  I had written to her 
from Chicago and again from New York, saying that I felt I ought to 
be on the spot in England for the new session, and that I was coming 
back--presently.  I concealed the name of my boat from her, and made 
a calculated prevarication when I announced my presence in London.  
I telephoned before I went back for my rooms to be prepared.  She 
was, I knew, with the Bunting Harblows in Durham, and when she came 
back to Radnor Square I had been at home a day.
<P>
I remember her return so well.
<P>
My going away and the vivid secret of the present had wiped out from 
my mind much of our long estrangement.  Something, too, had changed 
in her.  I had had some hint of it in her letters, but now I saw it 
plainly.  I came out of my study upon the landing when I heard the 
turmoil of her arrival below, and she came upstairs with a quickened 
gladness.  It was a cold March, and she was dressed in unfamiliar 
dark furs that suited her extremely and reinforced the delicate 
flush of her sweet face.  She held out both her hands to me, and 
drew me to her unhesitatingly and kissed me.
<P>
"So glad you are back, dear," she said.  "Oh! so very glad you are 
back."
<P>
I returned her kiss with a queer feeling at my heart, too 
undifferentiated to be even a definite sense of guilt or meanness.  
I think it was chiefly amazement--at the universe--at myself.
<P>
"I never knew what it was to be away from you," she said.
<P>
I perceived suddenly that she had resolved to end our estrangement.  
She put herself so that my arm came caressingly about her.
<P>
"These are jolly furs," I said.
<P>
"I got them for you."
<P>
The parlourmaid appeared below dealing with the maid and the luggage 
cab.
<P>
"Tell me all about America," said Margaret.  "I feel as though you'd 
been away six year's."
<P>
We went arm in arm into our little sitting-room, and I took off the 
fur's for her and sat down upon the chintz-covered sofa by the fire.  
She had ordered tea, and came and sat by me.  I don't know what I 
had expected, but of all things I had certainly not expected this 
sudden abolition of our distances.
<P>
"I want to know all about America," she repeated, with her eyes 
scrutinising me.  "Why did you come back?"
<P>
I repeated the substance of my letters rather lamely, and she sat 
listening.
<P>
"But why did you turn back--without going to Denver?"
<P>
"I wanted to come back.  I was restless."
<P>
"Restlessness," she said, and thought.  "You were restless in 
Venice.  You said it was restlessness took you to America."
<P>
Again she studied me.  She turned a little awkwardly to her tea 
things, and poured needless water from the silver kettle into the 
teapot.  Then she sat still for some moments looking at the equipage 
with expressionless eyes.  I saw her hand upon the edge of the table 
tremble slightly.  I watched her closely.  A vague uneasiness 
possessed me.  What might she not know or guess?
<P>
She spoke at last with an effort.  "I wish you were in Parliament 
again," she said.  "Life doesn't give you events enough."
<P>
"If I was in Parliament again, I should be on the Conservative 
side."
<P>
"I know," she said, and was still more thoughtful.
<P>
"Lately," she began, and paused.  "Lately I've been reading--you."
<P>
I didn't help her out with what she had to say.  I waited.
<P>
"I didn't understand what you were after.  I had misjudged.  I 
didn't know.  I think perhaps I was rather stupid."  Her eyes were 
suddenly shining with tears.  "You didn't give me much chance to 
understand."
<P>
She turned upon me suddenly with a voice full of tears.
<P>
"Husband," she said abruptly, holding her two hands out to me, "I 
want to begin over again!"
<P>
I took her hands, perplexed beyond measure.  "My dear!" I said.
<P>
"I want to begin over again."
<P>
I bowed my head to hide my face, and found her hand in mine and 
kissed it.
<P>
"Ah!" she said, and slowly withdrew her hand.  She leant forward 
with her arm on the sofa-back, and looked very intently into my 
face.  I felt the most damnable scoundrel in the world as I returned 
her gaze.  The thought of Isabel's darkly shining eyes seemed like a 
physical presence between us. . . .
<P>
"Tell me," I said presently, to break the intolerable tension, "tell 
me plainly what you mean by this."
<P>
I sat a little away from her, and then took my teacup in hand, with 
an odd effect of defending myself.  "Have you been reading that old 
book of mine?" I asked.
<P>
"That and the paper.  I took a complete set from the beginning down 
to Durham with me.  I have read it over, thought it over.  I didn't 
understand--what you were teaching."
<P>
There was a little pause.
<P>
"It all seems so plain to me now," she said, "and so true."
<P>
I was profoundly disconcerted.  I put down my teacup, stood up in 
the middle of the hearthrug, and began talking.  "I'm tremendously 
glad, Margaret, that you've come to see I'm not altogether 
perverse," I began.  I launched out into a rather trite and windy 
exposition of my views, and she sat close to me on the sofa, looking 
up into my face, hanging on my words, a deliberate and invincible 
convert.
<P>
"Yes," she said, "yes." . . .
<P>
I had never doubted my new conceptions before; now I doubted them 
profoundly.  But I went on talking.  It's the grim irony in the 
lives of all politicians, writers, public teachers, that once the 
audience is at their feet, a new loyalty has gripped them.  It isn't 
their business to admit doubt and imperfections.  They have to go on 
talking.  And I was now so accustomed to Isabel's vivid interruptions, 
qualifications, restatements, and confirmations. . . .
<P>
Margaret and I dined together at home.  She made me open out my 
political projects to her.  "I have been foolish," she said.  "I 
want to help."
<P>
And by some excuse I have forgotten she made me come to her room.  I 
think it was some book I had to take her, some American book I had 
brought back with me, and mentioned in our talk.  I walked in with 
it, and put it down on the table and turned to go.
<P>
"Husband!" she cried, and held out her slender arms to me.  I was 
compelled to go to her and kiss her, and she twined them softly 
about my neck and drew me to her and kissed me.  I disentangled them 
very gently, and took each wrist and kissed it, and the backs of her 
hands.
<P>
"Good-night," I said.  There came a little pause.  "Good-night, 
Margaret," I repeated, and walked very deliberately and with a kind 
of sham preoccupation to the door.
<P>
I did not look at her, but I could feel her standing, watching me.  
If I had looked up, she would, I knew, have held out her arms to 
me. . . .
<P>
At the very outset that secret, which was to touch no one but Isabel 
and myself, had reached out to stab another human being.
<P>
<P>
<P>
7
<P>
<P>
The whole world had changed for Isabel and me; and we tried to 
pretend that nothing had changed except a small matter between us.  
We believed quite honestly at that time that it was possible to keep 
this thing that had happened from any reaction at all, save perhaps 
through some magically enhanced vigour in our work, upon the world 
about us!  Seen in retrospect, one can realise the absurdity of this 
belief; within a week I realised it; but that does not alter the 
fact that we did believe as much, and that people who are deeply in 
love and unable to marry will continue to believe so to the very end 
of time.  They will continue to believe out of existence every 
consideration that separates them until they have come together.  
Then they will count the cost, as we two had to do.
<P>
I am telling a story, and not propounding theories in this book; and 
chiefly I am telling of the ideas and influences and emotions that 
have happened to me--me as a sort of sounding board for my world.  
The moralist is at liberty to go over my conduct with his measure 
and say, "At this point or at that you went wrong, and you ought to 
have done"--so-and-so.  The point of interest to the statesman is 
that it didn't for a moment occur to us to do so-and-so when the 
time for doing it came.  It amazes me now to think how little either 
of us troubled about the established rights or wrongs of the 
situation.  We hadn't an atom of respect for them, innate or 
acquired.  The guardians of public morals will say we were very bad 
people; I submit in defence that they are very bad guardians--
provocative guardians. . . .  And when at last there came a claim 
against us that had an effective validity for us, we were in the 
full tide of passionate intimacy.
<P>
I had a night of nearly sleepless perplexity after Margaret's 
return.  She had suddenly presented herself to me like something 
dramatically recalled, fine, generous, infinitely capable of 
feeling.  I was amazed how much I had forgotten her.  In my contempt 
for vulgarised and conventionalised honour I had forgotten that for 
me there was such a reality as honour.  And here it was, warm and 
near to me, living, breathing, unsuspecting.  Margaret's pride was 
my honour, that I had had no right even to imperil.
<P>
I do not now remember if I thought at that time of going to Isabel 
and putting this new aspect of the case before her.  Perhaps I did.  
Perhaps I may have considered even then the possibility of ending 
what had so freshly and passionately begun.  If I did, it vanished 
next day at the sight of her.  Whatever regrets came in the 
darkness, the daylight brought an obstinate confidence in our 
resolution again.  We would, we declared, "pull the thing off."  
Margaret must not know.  Margaret should not know.  If Margaret did 
not know, then no harm whatever would be done.  We tried to sustain 
that. . . .
<P>
For a brief time we had been like two people in a magic cell, 
magically cut off from the world and full of a light of its own, and 
then we began to realise that we were not in the least cut off, that 
the world was all about us and pressing in upon us, limiting us, 
threatening us, resuming possession of us.  I tried to ignore the 
injury to Margaret of her unreciprocated advances.  I tried to 
maintain to myself that this hidden love made no difference to the 
now irreparable breach between husband and wife.  But I never spoke 
of it to Isabel or let her see that aspect of our case.  How could 
I?  The time for that had gone. . . .
<P>
Then in new shapes and relations came trouble.  Distressful elements 
crept in by reason of our unavoidable furtiveness; we ignored them, 
hid them from each other, and attempted to hide them from ourselves.  
Successful love is a thing of abounding pride, and we had to be 
secret.  It was delightful at first to be secret, a whispering, warm 
conspiracy; then presently it became irksome and a little shameful.  
Her essential frankness of soul was all against the masks and 
falsehoods that many women would have enjoyed.  Together in our 
secrecy we relaxed, then in the presence of other people again it 
was tiresome to have to watch for the careless, too easy phrase, to 
snatch back one's hand from the limitless betrayal of a light, 
familiar touch.
<P>
Love becomes a poor thing, at best a poor beautiful thing, if it 
develops no continuing and habitual intimacy.  We were always 
meeting, and most gloriously loving and beginning--and then we had 
to snatch at remorseless ticking watches, hurry to catch trains, and 
go back to this or that.  That is all very well for the intrigues of 
idle people perhaps, but not for an intense personal relationship.  
It is like lighting a candle for the sake of lighting it, over and 
over again, and each time blowing it out.  That, no doubt, must be 
very amusing to children playing with the matches, but not to people 
who love warm light, and want it in order to do fine and honourable 
things together.  We had achieved--I give the ugly phrase that 
expresses the increasing discolouration in my mind--"illicit 
intercourse."  To end at that, we now perceived, wasn't in our 
style.  But where were we to end? . . .
<P>
Perhaps we might at this stage have given it up.  I think if we 
could have seen ahead and around us we might have done so.  But the 
glow of our cell blinded us. . . .  I wonder what might have 
happened if at that time we had given it up. . . .  We propounded 
it, we met again in secret to discuss it, and our overpowering 
passion for one another reduced that meeting to absurdity. . . .
<P>
Presently the idea of children crept between us.  It came in from 
all our conceptions of life and public service; it was, we found, in 
the quality of our minds that physical love without children is a 
little weak, timorous, more than a little shameful.  With 
imaginative people there very speedily comes a time when that 
realisation is inevitable.  We hadn't thought of that before--it 
isn't natural to think of that before.  We hadn't known.  There is 
no literature in English dealing with such things.
<P>
There is a necessary sequence of phases in love.  These came in 
their order, and with them, unanticipated tarnishings on the first 
bright perfection of our relations.  For a time these developing 
phases were no more than a secret and private trouble between us, 
little shadows spreading by imperceptible degrees across that vivid 
and luminous cell.
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
The Handitch election flung me suddenly into prominence.
<P>
It is still only two years since that struggle, and I will not 
trouble the reader with a detailed history of events that must be 
quite sufficiently present in his mind for my purpose already.  Huge 
stacks of journalism have dealt with Handitch and its significance.  
For the reader very probably, as for most people outside a 
comparatively small circle, it meant my emergence from obscurity.  
We obtruded no editor's name in the BLUE WEEKLY; I had never as yet 
been on the London hoardings.  Before Handitch I was a journalist 
and writer of no great public standing; after Handitch, I was 
definitely a person, in the little group of persons who stood for 
the Young Imperialist movement.  Handitch was, to a very large 
extent, my affair.  I realised then, as a man comes to do, how much 
one can still grow after seven and twenty.  In the second election I 
was a man taking hold of things; at Kinghamstead I had been simply a 
young candidate, a party unit, led about the constituency, told to 
do this and that, and finally washed in by the great Anti-
Imperialist flood, like a starfish rolling up a beach.
<P>
My feminist views had earnt the mistrust of the party, and I do not 
think I should have got the chance of Handitch or indeed any chance 
at all of Parliament for a long time, if it had not been that the 
seat with its long record of Liberal victories and its Liberal 
majority of 3642 at the last election, offered a hopeless contest.  
The Liberal dissensions and the belated but by no means contemptible 
Socialist candidate were providential interpositions.  I think, 
however, the conduct of Gane, Crupp, and Tarvrille in coming down to 
fight for me, did count tremendously in my favour.  "We aren't going 
to win, perhaps," said Crupp, "but we are going to talk."  And until 
the very eve of victory, we treated Handitch not so much as a 
battlefield as a hoarding.  And so it was the Endowment of 
Motherhood as a practical form of Eugenics got into English 
politics.
<P>
Plutus, our agent, was scared out of his wits when the thing began.
<P>
"They're ascribing all sorts of queer ideas to you about the 
Family," he said.
<P>
"I think the Family exists for the good of the children," I said; 
"is that queer?"
<P>
"Not when you explain it--but they won't let you explain it.  And 
about marriage--?"
<P>
"I'm all right about marriage--trust me."
<P>
"Of course, if YOU had children," said Plutus, rather 
inconsiderately. . . .
<P>
They opened fire upon me in a little electioneering rag call the 
HANDITCH SENTINEL, with a string of garbled quotations and 
misrepresentations that gave me an admirable text for a speech.  I 
spoke for an hour and ten minutes with a more and more crumpled copy 
of the SENTINEL in my hand, and I made the fullest and completest 
exposition of the idea of endowing motherhood that I think had ever 
been made up to that time in England.  Its effect on the press was 
extraordinary.  The Liberal papers gave me quite unprecedented space 
under the impression that I had only to be given rope to hang 
myself; the Conservatives cut me down or tried to justify me; the 
whole country was talking.  I had had a pamphlet in type upon the 
subject, and I revised this carefully and put it on the book-stalls 
within three days.  It sold enormously and brought me bushels of 
letters.  We issued over three thousand in Handitch alone.  At 
meeting after meeting I was heckled upon nothing else.  Long before 
polling day Plutus was converted.
<P>
"It's catching on like old age pensions," he said.  "We've dished 
the Liberals!  To think that such a project should come from our 
side!"
<P>
But it was only with the declaration of the poll that my battle was 
won.  No one expected more than a snatch victory, and I was in by 
over fifteen hundred.  At one bound Cossington's papers passed from 
apologetics varied by repudiation to triumphant praise.  "A 
renascent England, breeding men," said the leader in his chief daily 
on the morning after the polling, and claimed that the Conservatives 
had been ever the pioneers in sanely bold constructive projects.
<P>
I came up to London with a weary but rejoicing Margaret by the night 
train.
