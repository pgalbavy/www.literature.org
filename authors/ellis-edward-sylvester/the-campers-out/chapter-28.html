<p>Within a few seconds after McGovern felt the water about his
ankles it touched his knees. He was still able to make progress,
and with the same despairing desperation as before, struggled
onward.</p>

<p>At the next step he went to his waist, and fell with a splash.</p>

<p>"I’m drowning!" he gasped; but fortunately for him he had plunged
into a small hollow, out of which he was swept the next moment,
and, with no effort on his part, flung upon his feet.</p>

<p>The roar was overpowering. It seemed as if he were in the appalling
swirl of Niagara, with the raging waters all around him clamoring
for his life. He grasped a limb which brushed his face, and the
next step showed that he had struck higher ground.</p>

<p>But the torrent was ascending faster than he. It was gaining
in spite of all he could do, but hope was not yet dead. Another
step and the water was below his waist, and he was able to make
progress with the help of his hands. When he lifted one foot it
was swept to one side, and only by throwing his full weight upon
it was he able to sustain himself.</p>

<p>He had now reached a point where the trees were not so near together.
While this enabled him to see something of his surroundings, it
gave the sweeping volume greater power, and he was in despair
again.</p>

<p>But the dim light of the moon showed that at that moment the
boundary of the current was only a few paces beyond him. Could
he pass that intervening distance before it further expanded he
would be safe.</p>

<p>Rousing his flagging energies he fought on, cheered by the view
of a figure on the margin, which had evidently caught sight of
him.</p>

<p>"A little farther and you will be all right!" shouted the stranger,
stepping into the torrent and extending his hand.</p>

<p>"I can’t do it!" moaned McGovern, struggling on, but gaining
no faster than the terrible enemy against which he was fighting.</p>

<p>"Yes, you will! don’t give up! take my hand!"</p>

<p>McGovern reached out, but he was short of grasping the friendly
help. Then the brave friend stepped into the rushing torrent at
the risk of his own life, and, griping the cold hand, exerted
himself with the power of desperation, and dragged the helpless
youth into the shallow margin.</p>

<p>"Don’t stop!" he shouted, still pulling him forward; "we are
not yet out of danger!"</p>

<p>Helped by the stranger who had appeared so opportunely, the two
splashed through the flood, which seemed striving to prevent their
escape, and would drag them down in spite of themselves.</p>

<p>But the rescuer was cool-headed, strong, and brave, and he kept
the weak McGovern going with a speed that threatened to fling
him prostrate in spite of himself.</p>

<p>The ground rose more sharply than before. A few more hurried
steps and their feet touched dry land. Still a few paces farther
and they were saved.</p>

<p>The torrent might roar and rage, but it could not seize them.
They had eluded its wrath, like the hunter who leaps aside from
the bound of the tiger.</p>

<p>McGovern stood for a minute panting, limp, and so exhausted that
he could hardly keep his feet. His companion did not speak, but
kept his place beside him, curiously gazing into his countenance,
and waiting until he should fully recover before addressing him.</p>

<p>The youth speedily regained his self-command, and for the first
time looked in his rescuer’s face. They were now beyond the shadow
of the trees, and could discern each other’s features quite distinctly
in the favoring moonlight.</p>

<p>"Well!" he exclaimed, "I think you and I have met before."</p>

<p>"I shouldn’t be surprised if we had," was the reply; "you tried
to destroy my bicycle last night."</p>

<p>"And you saved me from drowning in the mill-pond."</p>

<p>"I believe I gave you a little help in that way."</p>

<p>"And now you have saved my life again."</p>

<p>"I am glad I was able to do something for you, for you seemed
to be in a bad way."</p>

<p>"I should think I was! If you had been a minute later it would
have been the last of Jim McGovern, and I tell you, Dick Halliard,
he was in no shape to die."</p>

<p>No person escaping death by such a close call could throw off
at once the moral effect of his rescue. The bad youth was humbled,
frightened, and repentant. He was standing in the presence of
him who had twice been the instrument of saving his life in a
brief space of time, and that, too, after McGovern had tried to
do him an injury.</p>

<p>"I don’t know whether you can forgive me," he said, in the meekest
of tones, "but I beg your pardon all the same."</p>

<p>"I have no feeling against you," replied Dick, "and though you
sought to do me an injury, you inflicted the most on yourself;
but," added the young hero, starting up, "where are Bob Budd and
Tom Wagstaff?"</p>

<p>"Heaven only knows! They must be drowned," replied McGovern,
glancing at the raging waters so near him with a shudder, as if
he still feared they would reach and sweep him away.</p>

<p>"Where did you leave them? How did you become separated?"</p>

<p>"We were in our tent when we heard the waters coming. We felt
we couldn’t help each other, and all made a break, some in one
direction and some another. They must have been drowned, just
as I would have been but for you."</p>

<p>But what could he do to help them? He was standing as near to
the torrent as he dare. It had already submerged the spot where
the tent had been erected to the depth of twenty feet at least.
Bob and Tom could not have stayed there had they wished, nor was
there any means of reaching them.</p>

<p>"I wish I could do something," said Dick, as if talking with
himself, "but I see no way."</p>

<p>"There is none," added McGovern, who was speedily recovering
from the ordeal through which he had passed, "but it is too bad;
I would do anything I could for poor Bob and Tom."</p>

<p>It seemed hopeless indeed, but Dick could not stand idle, knowing
that others near him might be in most imminent need of help.</p>

<p>"If they are alive, which I don’t believe," said McGovern, "they
must have drifted below us by this time."</p>

<p>"I agree with you," replied Dick, moving slowly along the margin
of the torrent, which, on account of the unevenness of the ground,
encroached at times and compelled them to retreat for a brief
space; "I should think if they were alive they would call for
help."</p>

<p>"Did you hear <em>me</em>?" asked McGovern, looking round in
the face of his companion.</p>

<p>"Yes, though I happened to be quite near when the flood came,
and had to scramble myself to get out of the way—"</p>

<p>"Hark!" interrupted McGovern, "that was a voice!"</p>

<p>"So it was, and it is below us!"</p>

<p>As he spoke he broke into a run, with the larger youth at his
heels. They had caught a cry, but it was so smothered and brief
that it was impossible to tell the point whence it came, except
that it was below them.</p>

<p>"Help! help! for the love of Hiven, help!"</p>

<p>"That’s the voice of Terry Hurley," said Dick, who recalled that
the Irishman lived with his family a short distance away, and
in the path of the flood. In the whirl of events young Halliard
had forgotten this man and his wife and their two little girls.</p>

<p>But that cry showed they were in imminent extremity, and possibly
aid might reach them in time. McGovern, since his own rescue,
was as anxious as the brave Dick to extend assistance to whomsoever
were in peril.</p>

<p>The calamity had come with such awful suddenness that not the
least precautionary step could be taken. It was too early for
neighbors to arrive, but all Piketon and the vicinity would be
on the spot in the course of a few hours.</p>

<p>A brief run brought the boys in sight of the imperiled family.
The humble home of Terry Hurley did not stand in the centre of
the valley, like the tent of the Piketon Rangers, but well up
to one side. Thus it escaped the full force of the current, which,
however, was violent enough to fill the lower story in a twinkling,
and threaten to carry the structure from its foundations.</p>

<p>The two little girls, Maggie and Katie, had just said their prayers
at their bedside in the upper story, and Terry was in the act
of lighting his pipe when the shock came. The husband and wife
might have escaped by dashing out of the door and fleeing, but
neither thought for an instant of doing so. Both would have preferred
to perish rather than abandon the innocent ones above them.</p>

<p>Calling to his wife to follow, Terry bounded up a few steps and
dashed to the bedside. At the same instant that he seized one
in his arms, his wife caught up the younger.</p>

<p>"Whither shall we go, Terry?" asked the distracted mother, starting
to descend the stairs.</p>

<p>"Not there! not there!" he called, "but to the roof!"</p>

<p>By standing on a chair the trap-door was easily reached and the
covering thrown back. Then he pushed Maggie through, warning her
to hold fast, and the rest would instantly join her.</p>

<p>Next little Katie was passed upward.</p>

<p>"Now," said Terry, "I will jine the wee spalpeens and thin give
ye a lift, Delia."</p>

<p>The Irishman was a powerful man, and the task thus far was of
the easiest character. He drew himself through the door on the
roof, and extending one brawny hand to his wife, was in the act
of lifting her after him, when a scream from Maggie caused him
to loose his hold and look round.</p>

<p>"What’s the matter wid ye, Maggie?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Kate has just rolled off the roof!" was the terrifying reply.</p>
