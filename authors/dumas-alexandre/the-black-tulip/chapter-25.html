<article class="w3-container w3-justify">

<P>Rosa, on leaving Cornelius, had fixed on her plan, which was 
no other than to restore to Cornelius the stolen tulip, or 
never to see him again.</P>
<P>She had seen the despair of the prisoner, and she knew that 
it was derived from a double source, and that it was 
incurable.</P>
<P>On the one hand, separation became inevitable,  -  Gryphus 
having at the same time surprised the secret of their love 
and of their secret meetings.</P>
<P>On the other hand, all the hopes on the fulfilment of which 
Cornelius van Baerle had rested his ambition for the last 
seven years were now crushed.</P>
<P>Rosa was one of those women who are dejected by trifles, but 
who in great emergencies are supplied by the misfortune 
itself with the energy for combating or with the resources 
for remedying it.</P>
<P>She went to her room, and cast a last glance about her to 
see whether she had not been mistaken, and whether the tulip 
was not stowed away in some corner where it had escaped her 
notice. But she sought in vain, the tulip was still missing; 
the tulip was indeed stolen.</P>
<P>Rosa made up a little parcel of things indispensable for a 
journey; took her three hundred guilders,  -  that is to say, 
all her fortune,  -  fetched the third bulb from among her 
lace, where she had laid it up, and carefully hid it in her 
bosom; after which she locked her door twice to disguise her 
flight as long as possible, and, leaving the prison by the 
same door which an hour before had let out Boxtel, she went 
to a stable-keeper to hire a carriage.</P>
<P>The man had only a two-wheel chaise, and this was the 
vehicle which Boxtel had hired since last evening, and in 
which he was now driving along the road to Delft; for the 
road from Loewestein to Haarlem, owing to the many canals, 
rivers, and rivulets intersecting the country, is 
exceedingly circuitous.</P>
<P>Not being able to procure a vehicle, Rosa was obliged to 
take a horse, with which the stable-keeper readily intrusted 
her, knowing her to be the daughter of the jailer of the 
fortress.</P>
<P>Rosa hoped to overtake her messenger, a kind-hearted and 
honest lad, whom she would take with her, and who might at 
the same time serve her as a guide and a protector.</P>
<P>And in fact she had not proceeded more than a league before 
she saw him hastening along one of the side paths of a very 
pretty road by the river. Setting her horse off at a canter, 
she soon came up with him.</P>
<P>The honest lad was not aware of the important character of 
his message; nevertheless, he used as much speed as if he 
had known it; and in less than an hour he had already gone a 
league and a half.</P>
<P>Rosa took from him the note, which had now become useless, 
and explained to him what she wanted him to do for her. The 
boatman placed himself entirely at her disposal, promising 
to keep pace with the horse if Rosa would allow him to take 
hold of either the croup or the bridle of her horse. The two 
travellers had been on their way for five hours, and made 
more than eight leagues, and yet Gryphus had not the least 
suspicion of his daughter having left the fortress.</P>
<P>The jailer, who was of a very spiteful and cruel 
disposition, chuckled within himself at the idea of having 
struck such terror into his daughter's heart.</P>
<P>But whilst he was congratulating himself on having such a 
nice story to tell to his boon companion, Jacob, that worthy 
was on his road to Delft; and, thanks to the swiftness of 
the horse, had already the start of Rosa and her companion 
by four leagues.</P>
<P>And whilst the affectionate father was rejoicing at the 
thought of his daughter weeping in her room, Rosa was making 
the best of her way towards Haarlem.</P>
<P>Thus the prisoner alone was where Gryphus thought him to be.</P>
<P>Rosa was so little with her father since she took care of 
the tulip, that at his dinner hour, that is to say, at 
twelve o'clock, he was reminded for the first time by his 
appetite that his daughter was fretting rather too long.</P>
<P>He sent one of the under-turnkeys to call her; and, when the 
man came back to tell him that he had called and sought her 
in vain, he resolved to go and call her himself.</P>
<P>He first went to her room, but, loud as he knocked, Rosa 
answered not.</P>
<P>The locksmith of the fortress was sent for; he opened the 
door, but Gryphus no more found Rosa than she had found the 
tulip.</P>
<P>At that very moment she entered Rotterdam.</P>
<P>Gryphus therefore had just as little chance of finding her 
in the kitchen as in her room, and just as little in the 
garden as in the kitchen.</P>
<P>The reader may imagine the anger of the jailer when, after 
having made inquiries about the neighbourhood, he heard that 
his daughter had hired a horse, and, like an adventuress, 
set out on a journey without saying where she was going.</P>
<P>Gryphus again went up in his fury to Van Baerle, abused him, 
threatened him, knocked all the miserable furniture of his 
cell about, and promised him all sorts of misery, even 
starvation and flogging.</P>
<P>Cornelius, without even hearing what his jailer said, 
allowed himself to be ill-treated, abused, and threatened, 
remaining all the while sullen, immovable, dead to every 
emotion and fear.</P>
<P>After having sought for Rosa in every direction, Gryphus 
looked out for Jacob, and, as he could not find him either, 
he began to suspect from that moment that Jacob had run away 
with her.</P>
<P>The damsel, meanwhile, after having stopped for two hours at 
Rotterdam, had started again on her journey. On that evening 
she slept at Delft, and on the following morning she reached 
Haarlem, four hours after Boxtel had arrived there.</P>
<P>Rosa, first of all, caused herself to be led before Mynheer 
van Systens, the President of the Horticultural Society of 
Haarlem.</P>
<P>She found that worthy gentleman in a situation which, to do 
justice to our story, we must not pass over in our 
description.</P>
<P>The President was drawing up a report to the committee of 
the society.</P>
<P>This report was written on large-sized paper, in the finest 
handwriting of the President.</P>
<P>Rosa was announced simply as Rosa Gryphus; but as her name, 
well as it might sound, was unknown to the President, she 
was refused admittance.</P>
<P>Rosa, however, was by no means abashed, having vowed in her 
heart, in pursuing her cause, not to allow herself to be put 
down either by refusal, or abuse, or even brutality.</P>
<P>&quot;Announce to the President,&quot; she said to the servant, &quot;that 
I want to speak to him about the black tulip.&quot;</P>
<P>These words seemed to be an &quot;Open Sesame,&quot; for she soon 
found herself in the office of the President, Van Systens, 
who gallantly rose from his chair to meet her.</P>
<P>He was a spare little man, resembling the stem of a flower, 
his head forming its chalice, and his two limp arms 
representing the double leaf of the tulip; the resemblance 
was rendered complete by his waddling gait which made him 
even more like that flower when it bends under a breeze.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, miss,&quot; he said, &quot;you are coming, I am told, about the 
affair of the black tulip.&quot;</P>
<P>To the President of the Horticultural Society the Tulipa 
nigra was a first-rate power, which, in its character as 
queen of the tulips, might send ambassadors.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; answered Rosa; &quot;I come at least to speak of it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is it doing well, then?&quot; asked Van Systens, with a smile of 
tender veneration.</P>
<P>&quot;Alas! sir, I don't know,&quot; said Rosa.</P>
<P>&quot;How is that? could any misfortune have happened to it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A very great one, sir; yet not to it, but to me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It has been stolen from me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Stolen! the black tulip?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you know the thief?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have my suspicions, but I must not yet accuse any one.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But the matter may very easily be ascertained.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How is that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As it has been stolen from you, the thief cannot be far 
off.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because I have seen the black tulip only two hours ago.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You have seen the black tulip!&quot; cried Rosa, rushing up to 
Mynheer van Systens.</P>
<P>&quot;As I see you, miss.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But where?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, with your master, of course.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;With my master?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, are you not in the service of Master Isaac Boxtel?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But for whom do you take me, sir?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And for whom do you take me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I hope, sir, I take you for what you are,  -  that is to 
say, for the honorable Mynheer van Systens, Burgomaster of 
Haarlem, and President of the Horticultural Society.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And what is it you told me just now?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I told you, sir, that my tulip has been stolen.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then your tulip is that of Mynheer Boxtel. Well, my child, 
you express yourself very badly. The tulip has been stolen, 
not from you, but from Mynheer Boxtel.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I repeat to you, sir, that I do not know who this Mynheer 
Boxtel is, and that I have now heard his name pronounced for 
the first time.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You do not know who Mynheer Boxtel is, and you also had a 
black tulip?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But is there any other besides mine?&quot; asked Rosa, 
trembling.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,  -  that of Mynheer Boxtel.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How is it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Black, of course.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Without speck?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Without a single speck, or even point.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you have this tulip,  -  you have it deposited here?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, but it will be, as it has to be exhibited before the 
committee previous to the prize being awarded.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, sir!&quot; cried Rosa, &quot;this Boxtel  -  this Isaac Boxtel  -  
who calls himself the owner of the black tulip  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And who is its owner?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is he not a very thin man?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Bald?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;With sunken eyes?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think he has.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Restless, stooping, and bowlegged?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In truth, you draw Master Boxtel's portrait feature by 
feature.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And the tulip, sir? Is it not in a pot of white and blue 
earthenware, with yellowish flowers in a basket on three 
sides?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, as to that I am not quite sure; I looked more at the 
flower than at the pot.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, sir! that's my tulip, which has been stolen from me. I 
came here to reclaim it before you and from you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! oh!&quot; said Van Systens, looking at Rosa. &quot;What! you are 
here to claim the tulip of Master Boxtel? Well, I must say, 
you are cool enough.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Honoured sir,&quot; a little put out by this apostrophe, &quot;I do 
not say that I am coming to claim the tulip of Master 
Boxtel, but to reclaim my own.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yours?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, the one which I have myself planted and nursed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, go and find out Master Boxtel, at the White 
Swan Inn, and you can then settle matters with him; as for 
me, considering that the cause seems to me as difficult to 
judge as that which was brought before King Solomon, and 
that I do not pretend to be as wise as he was, I shall 
content myself with making my report, establishing the 
existence of the black tulip, and ordering the hundred 
thousand guilders to be paid to its grower. Good-bye, my 
child.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, sir, sir!&quot; said Rosa, imploringly.</P>
<P>&quot;Only, my child,&quot; continued Van Systens, &quot;as you are young 
and pretty, and as there may be still some good in you, I'll 
give you some good advice. Be prudent in this matter, for we 
have a court of justice and a prison here at Haarlem, and, 
moreover, we are exceedingly ticklish as far as the honour 
of our tulips is concerned. Go, my child, go, remember, 
Master Isaac Boxtel at the White Swan Inn.&quot;</P>
<P>And Mynheer van Systens, taking up his fine pen, resumed his 
report, which had been interrupted by Rosa's visit. </P></article>
