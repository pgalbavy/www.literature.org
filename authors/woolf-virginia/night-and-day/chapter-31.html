<p>The tray which brought Katharine’s cup of tea the next morning
brought, also, a note from her mother, announcing that it was
her intention to catch an early train to Stratford-on-Avon that
very day.</p>

<p>"Please find out the best way of getting there," the note ran,
"and wire to dear Sir John Burdett to expect me, with my love.
I’ve been dreaming all night of you and Shakespeare, dearest Katharine."</p>

<p>This was no momentary impulse. Mrs. Hilbery had been dreaming
of Shakespeare any time these six months, toying with the idea
of an excursion to what she considered the heart of the civilized
world. To stand six feet above Shakespeare’s bones, to see the
very stones worn by his feet, to reflect that the oldest man’s
oldest mother had very likely seen Shakespeare’s daughter&mdash;such
thoughts roused an emotion in her, which she expressed at unsuitable
moments, and with a passion that would not have been unseemly
in a pilgrim to a sacred shrine. The only strange thing was that
she wished to go by herself. But, naturally enough, she was well
provided with friends who lived in the neighborhood of Shakespeare’s
tomb, and were delighted to welcome her; and she left later to
catch her train in the best of spirits. There was a man selling
violets in the street. It was a fine day. She would remember to
send Mr. Hilbery the first daffodil she saw. And, as she ran back
into the hall to tell Katharine, she felt, she had always felt,
that Shakespeare’s command to leave his bones undisturbed applied
only to odious curiosity-mongers&mdash;not to dear Sir John and herself.
Leaving her daughter to cogitate the theory of Anne Hathaway’s
sonnets, and the buried manuscripts here referred to, with the
implied menace to the safety of the heart of civilization itself,
she briskly shut the door of her taxi-cab, and was whirled off
upon the first stage of her pilgrimage.</p>

<p>The house was oddly different without her. Katharine found the
maids already in possession of her room, which they meant to clean
thoroughly during her absence. To Katharine it seemed as if they
had brushed away sixty years or so with the first flick of their
damp dusters. It seemed to her that the work she had tried to
do in that room was being swept into a very insignificant heap
of dust. The china shepherdesses were already shining from a bath
of hot water. The writing-table might have belonged to a professional
man of methodical habits.</p>

<p>Gathering together a few papers upon which she was at work, Katharine
proceeded to her own room with the intention of looking through
them, perhaps, in the course of the morning. But she was met on
the stairs by Cassandra, who followed her up, but with such intervals
between each step that Katharine began to feel her purpose dwindling
before they had reached the door. Cassandra leant over the banisters,
and looked down upon the Persian rug that lay on the floor of
the hall.</p>

<p>"Doesn’t everything look odd this morning?" she inquired. "Are
you really going to spend the morning with those dull old letters,
because if so&mdash;"</p>

<p>The dull old letters, which would have turned the heads of the
most sober of collectors, were laid upon a table, and, after a
moment’s pause, Cassandra, looking grave all of a sudden, asked
Katharine where she should find the "History of England" by Lord
Macaulay. It was downstairs in Mr. Hilbery’s study. The cousins
descended together in search of it. They diverged into the drawing-room
for the good reason that the door was open. The portrait of Richard
Alardyce attracted their attention.</p>

<p>"I wonder what he was like?" It was a question that Katharine
had often asked herself lately.</p>

<p>"Oh, a fraud like the rest of them&mdash;at least Henry says so,"
Cassandra replied. "Though I don’t believe everything Henry says,"
she added a little defensively.</p>

<p>Down they went into Mr. Hilbery’s study, where they began to
look among his books. So desultory was this examination that some
fifteen minutes failed to discover the work they were in search
of.</p>

<p>"Must you read Macaulay’s History, Cassandra?" Katharine asked,
with a stretch of her arms.</p>

<p>"I must," Cassandra replied briefly.</p>

<p>"Well, I’m going to leave you to look for it by yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Katharine. Please stay and help me. You see&mdash;you see
&mdash;I told William I’d read a little every day. And I want
to tell him that I’ve begun when he comes."</p>

<p>"When does William come?" Katharine asked, turning to the shelves
again.</p>

<p>"To tea, if that suits you?"</p>

<p>"If it suits me to be out, I suppose you mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, you’re horrid.... Why shouldn’t you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn’t you be happy too?"</p>

<p>"I am quite happy," Katharine replied.</p>

<p>"I mean as I am. Katharine," she said impulsively, "do let’s
be married on the same day."</p>

<p>"To the same man?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no. But why shouldn’t you marry&mdash;some one else?"</p>

<p>"Here’s your Macaulay," said Katharine, turning round with the
book in her hand. "I should say you’d better begin to read at
once if you mean to be educated by tea-time."</p>

<p>"Damn Lord Macaulay!" cried Cassandra, slapping the book upon
the table. "Would you rather not talk?"</p>

<p>"We’ve talked enough already," Katharine replied evasively.</p>

<p>"I know I shan’t be able to settle to Macaulay," said Cassandra,
looking ruefully at the dull red cover of the prescribed volume,
which, however, possessed a talismanic property, since William
admired it. He had advised a little serious reading for the morning
hours.</p>

<p>"Have <em>YOU </em>read Macaulay?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No. William never tried to educate me." As she spoke she saw
the light fade from Cassandra’s face, as if she had implied some
other, more mysterious, relationship. She was stung with compunction.
She marveled at her own rashness in having influenced the life
of another, as she had influenced Cassandra’s life.</p>

<p>"We weren’t serious," she said quickly.</p>

<p>"But I’m fearfully serious," said Cassandra, with a little shudder,
and her look showed that she spoke the truth. She turned and glanced
at Katharine as she had never glanced at her before. There was
fear in her glance, which darted on her and then dropped guiltily.
Oh, Katharine had everything&mdash;beauty, mind, character. She could
never compete with Katharine; she could never be safe so long
as Katharine brooded over her, dominating her, disposing of her.
She called her cold, unseeing, unscrupulous, but the only sign
she gave outwardly was a curious one&mdash;she reached out her hand
and grasped the volume of history. At that moment the bell of
the telephone rang and Katharine went to answer it. Cassandra,
released from observation, dropped her book and clenched her hands.
She suffered more fiery torture in those few minutes than she
had suffered in the whole of her life; she learnt more of her
capacities for feeling. But when Katharine reappeared she was
calm, and had gained a look of dignity that was new to her.</p>

<p>"Was that him?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It was Ralph Denham," Katharine replied.</p>

<p>"I meant Ralph Denham."</p>

<p>"Why did you mean Ralph Denham? What has William told you about
Ralph Denham?" The accusation that Katharine was calm, callous,
and indifferent was not possible in face of her present air of
animation. She gave Cassandra no time to frame an answer. "Now,
when are you and William going to be married?" she asked.</p>

<p>Cassandra made no reply for some moments. It was, indeed, a very
difficult question to answer. In conversation the night before,
William had indicated to Cassandra that, in his belief, Katharine
was becoming engaged to Ralph Denham in the dining-room. Cassandra,
in the rosy light of her own circumstances, had been disposed
to think that the matter must be settled already. But a letter
which she had received that morning from William, while ardent
in its expression of affection, had conveyed to her obliquely
that he would prefer the announcement of their engagement to coincide
with that of Katharine’s. This document Cassandra now produced,
and read aloud, with considerable excisions and much hesitation.</p>

<p>"... a thousand pities&mdash;ahem &mdash;I fear we shall cause a great
deal of natural annoyance. If, on the other hand, what I have
reason to think will happen, should happen&mdash;within reasonable
time, and the present position is not in any way offensive to
you, delay would, in my opinion, serve all our interests better
than a premature explanation, which is bound to cause more surprise
than is desirable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very like William," Katharine exclaimed, having gathered the
drift of these remarks with a speed that, by itself, disconcerted
Cassandra.</p>

<p>"I quite understand his feelings," Cassandra replied. "I quite
agree with them. I think it would be much better, if you intend
to marry Mr. Denham, that we should wait as William says."</p>

<p>"But, then, if I don’t marry him for months&mdash;or, perhaps, not
at all?"</p>

<p>Cassandra was silent. The prospect appalled her. Katharine had
been telephoning to Ralph Denham; she looked queer, too; she must
be, or about to become, engaged to him. But if Cassandra could
have overheard the conversation upon the telephone, she would
not have felt so certain that it tended in that direction. It
was to this effect:</p>

<p>"I’m Ralph Denham speaking. I’m in my right senses now."</p>

<p>"How long did you wait outside the house?"</p>

<p>"I went home and wrote you a letter. I tore it up."</p>

<p>"I shall tear up everything too."</p>

<p>"I shall come."</p>

<p>"Yes. Come to-day."</p>

<p>"I must explain to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. We must explain&mdash;"</p>

<p>A long pause followed. Ralph began a sentence, which he canceled
with the word, "Nothing." Suddenly, together, at the same moment,
they said good-bye. And yet, if the telephone had been miraculously
connected with some higher atmosphere pungent with the scent of
thyme and the savor of salt, Katharine could hardly have breathed
in a keener sense of exhilaration. She ran downstairs on the crest
of it. She was amazed to find herself already committed by William
and Cassandra to marry the owner of the halting voice she had
just heard on the telephone. The tendency of her spirit seemed
to be in an altogether different direction; and of a different
nature. She had only to look at Cassandra to see what the love
that results in an engagement and marriage means. She considered
for a moment, and then said: "If you don’t want to tell people
yourselves, I’ll do it for you. I know William has feelings about
these matters that make it very difficult for him to do anything."</p>

<p>"Because he’s fearfully sensitive about other people’s feelings,"
said Cassandra. "The idea that he could upset Aunt Maggie or Uncle
Trevor would make him ill for weeks."</p>

<p>This interpretation of what she was used to call William’s conventionality
was new to Katharine. And yet she felt it now to be the true one.</p>

<p>"Yes, you’re right," she said.</p>

<p>"And then he worships beauty. He wants life to be beautiful in
every part of it. Have you ever noticed how exquisitely he finishes
everything? Look at the address on that envelope. Every letter
is perfect."</p>

<p>Whether this applied also to the sentiments expressed in the
letter, Katharine was not so sure; but when William’s solicitude
was spent upon Cassandra it not only failed to irritate her, as
it had done when she was the object of it, but appeared, as Cassandra
said, the fruit of his love of beauty.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "he loves beauty."</p>

<p>"I hope we shall have a great many children," said Cassandra.
"He loves children."</p>

<p>This remark made Katharine realize the depths of their intimacy
better than any other words could have done; she was jealous for
one moment; but the next she was humiliated. She had known William
for years, and she had never once guessed that he loved children.
She looked at the queer glow of exaltation in Cassandra’s eyes,
through which she was beholding the true spirit of a human being,
and wished that she would go on talking about William for ever.
Cassandra was not unwilling to gratify her. She talked on. The
morning slipped away. Katharine scarcely changed her position
on the edge of her father’s writing-table, and Cassandra never
opened the "History of England."</p>

<p>And yet it must be confessed that there were vast lapses in the
attention which Katharine bestowed upon her cousin. The atmosphere
was wonderfully congenial for thoughts of her own. She lost herself
sometimes in such deep reverie that Cassandra, pausing, could
look at her for moments unperceived. What could Katharine be thinking
about, unless it were Ralph Denham? She was satisfied, by certain
random replies, that Katharine had wandered a little from the
subject of William’s perfections. But Katharine made no sign.
She always ended these pauses by saying something so natural that
Cassandra was deluded into giving fresh examples of her absorbing
theme. Then they lunched, and the only sign that Katharine gave
of abstraction was to forget to help the pudding. She looked so
like her mother, as she sat there oblivious of the tapioca, that
Cassandra was startled into exclaiming:</p>

<p>"How like Aunt Maggie you look!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Katharine, with more irritation than the remark
seemed to call for.</p>

<p>In truth, now that her mother was away, Katharine did feel less
sensible than usual, but as she argued it to herself, there was
much less need for sense. Secretly, she was a little shaken by
the evidence which the morning had supplied of her immense capacity
for&mdash;what could one call it?&mdash;rambling over an infinite variety
of thoughts that were too foolish to be named. She was, for example,
walking down a road in Northumberland in the August sunset; at
the inn she left her companion, who was Ralph Denham, and was
transported, not so much by her own feet as by some invisible
means, to the top of a high hill. Here the scents, the sounds
among the dry heather-roots, the grass-blades pressed upon the
palm of her hand, were all so perceptible that she could experience
each one separately. After this her mind made excursions into
the dark of the air, or settled upon the surface of the sea, which
could be discovered over there, or with equal unreason it returned
to its couch of bracken beneath the stars of midnight, and visited
the snow valleys of the moon. These fancies would have been in
no way strange, since the walls of every mind are decorated with
some such tracery, but she found herself suddenly pursuing such
thoughts with an extreme ardor, which became a desire to change
her actual condition for something matching the conditions of
her dream. Then she started; then she awoke to the fact that Cassandra
was looking at her in amazement.</p>

<p>Cassandra would have liked to feel certain that, when Katharine
made no reply at all or one wide of the mark, she was making up
her mind to get married at once, but it was difficult, if this
were so, to account for some remarks that Katharine let fall about
the future. She recurred several times to the summer, as if she
meant to spend that season in solitary wandering. She seemed to
have a plan in her mind which required Bradshaws and the names
of inns.</p>

<p>Cassandra was driven finally, by her own unrest, to put on her
clothes and wander out along the streets of Chelsea, on the pretence
that she must buy something. But, in her ignorance of the way,
she became panic-stricken at the thought of being late, and no
sooner had she found the shop she wanted, than she fled back again
in order to be at home when William came. He came, indeed, five
minutes after she had sat down by the tea-table, and she had the
happiness of receiving him alone. His greeting put her doubts
of his affection at rest, but the first question he asked was:</p>

<p>"Has Katharine spoken to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But she says she’s not engaged. She doesn’t seem to think
she’s ever going to be engaged."</p>

<p>William frowned, and looked annoyed.</p>

<p>"They telephoned this morning, and she behaves very oddly. She
forgets to help the pudding," Cassandra added by way of cheering
him.</p>

<p>"My dear child, after what I saw and heard last night, it’s not
a question of guessing or suspecting. Either she’s engaged to
him&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<p>He left his sentence unfinished, for at this point Katharine
herself appeared. With his recollections of the scene the night
before, he was too self-conscious even to look at her, and it
was not until she told him of her mother’s visit to Stratford-on-Avon
that he raised his eyes. It was clear that he was greatly relieved.
He looked round him now, as if he felt at his ease, and Cassandra
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Don’t you think everything looks quite different?"</p>

<p>"You’ve moved the sofa?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No. Nothing’s been touched," said Katharine. "Everything’s exactly
the same." But as she said this, with a decision which seemed
to make it imply that more than the sofa was unchanged, she held
out a cup into which she had forgotten to pour any tea. Being
told of her forgetfulness, she frowned with annoyance, and said
that Cassandra was demoralizing her. The glance she cast upon
them, and the resolute way in which she plunged them into speech,
made William and Cassandra feel like children who had been caught
prying. They followed her obediently, making conversation. Any
one coming in might have judged them acquaintances met, perhaps,
for the third time. If that were so, one must have concluded that
the hostess suddenly bethought her of an engagement pressing for
fulfilment. First Katharine looked at her watch, and then she
asked William to tell her the right time. When told that it was
ten minutes to five she rose at once, and said:</p>

<p>"Then I’m afraid I must go."</p>

<p>She left the room, holding her unfinished bread and butter in
her hand. William glanced at Cassandra.</p>

<p>"Well, she IS queer!" Cassandra exclaimed.</p>

<p>William looked perturbed. He knew more of Katharine than Cassandra
did, but even he could not tell&mdash;. In a second Katharine was back
again dressed in outdoor things, still holding her bread and butter
in her bare hand.</p>

<p>"If I’m late, don’t wait for me," she said. "I shall have dined,"
and so saying, she left them.</p>

<p>"But she can’t&mdash;" William exclaimed, as the door shut, "not without
any gloves and bread and butter in her hand!" They ran to the
window, and saw her walking rapidly along the street towards the
City. Then she vanished.</p>

<p>"She must have gone to meet Mr. Denham," Cassandra exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Goodness knows!" William interjected.</p>

<p>The incident impressed them both as having something queer and
ominous about it out of all proportion to its surface strangeness.</p>

<p>"It’s the sort of way Aunt Maggie behaves," said Cassandra, as
if in explanation.</p>

<p>William shook his head, and paced up and down the room looking
extremely perturbed.</p>

<p>"This is what I’ve been foretelling," he burst out. "Once set
the ordinary conventions aside &mdash;Thank Heaven Mrs. Hilbery
is away. But there’s Mr. Hilbery. How are we to explain it to
him? I shall have to leave you."</p>

<p>"But Uncle Trevor won’t be back for hours, William!" Cassandra
implored.</p>

<p>"You never can tell. He may be on his way already. Or suppose
Mrs. Milvain&mdash;your Aunt Celia&mdash;or Mrs. Cosham, or any other of
your aunts or uncles should be shown in and find us alone together.
You know what they’re saying about us already."</p>

<p>Cassandra was equally stricken by the sight of William’s agitation,
and appalled by the prospect of his desertion.</p>

<p>"We might hide," she exclaimed wildly, glancing at the curtain
which separated the room with the relics.</p>

<p>"I refuse entirely to get under the table," said William sarcastically.</p>

<p>She saw that he was losing his temper with the difficulties of
the situation. Her instinct told her that an appeal to his affection,
at this moment, would be extremely ill-judged. She controlled
herself, sat down, poured out a fresh cup of tea, and sipped it
quietly. This natural action, arguing complete self-mastery, and
showing her in one of those feminine attitudes which William found
adorable, did more than any argument to compose his agitation.
It appealed to his chivalry. He accepted a cup. Next she asked
for a slice of cake. By the time the cake was eaten and the tea
drunk the personal question had lapsed, and they were discussing
poetry. Insensibly they turned from the question of dramatic poetry
in general, to the particular example which reposed in William’s
pocket, and when the maid came in to clear away the tea-things,
William had asked permission to read a short passage aloud, "unless
it bored her?"</p>

<p>Cassandra bent her head in silence, but she showed a little of
what she felt in her eyes, and thus fortified, William felt confident
that it would take more than Mrs. Milvain herself to rout him
from his position. He read aloud.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Katharine walked rapidly along the street. If called
upon to explain her impulsive action in leaving the tea-table,
she could have traced it to no better cause than that William
had glanced at Cassandra; Cassandra at William. Yet, because they
had glanced, her position was impossible. If one forgot to pour
out a cup of tea they rushed to the conclusion that she was engaged
to Ralph Denham. She knew that in half an hour or so the door
would open, and Ralph Denham would appear. She could not sit there
and contemplate seeing him with William’s and Cassandra’s eyes
upon them, judging their exact degree of intimacy, so that they
might fix the wedding-day. She promptly decided that she would
meet Ralph out of doors; she still had time to reach Lincoln’s
Inn Fields before he left his office. She hailed a cab, and bade
it take her to a shop for selling maps which she remembered in
Great Queen Street, since she hardly liked to be set down at his
door. Arrived at the shop, she bought a large scale map of Norfolk,
and thus provided, hurried into Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and assured
herself of the position of Messrs. Hoper and Grateley’s office.
The great gas chandeliers were alight in the office windows. She
conceived that he sat at an enormous table laden with papers beneath
one of them in the front room with the three tall windows. Having
settled his position there, she began walking to and fro upon
the pavement. Nobody of his build appeared. She scrutinized each
male figure as it approached and passed her. Each male figure
had, nevertheless, a look of him, due, perhaps, to the professional
dress, the quick step, the keen glance which they cast upon her
as they hastened home after the day’s work. The square itself,
with its immense houses all so fully occupied and stern of aspect,
its atmosphere of industry and power, as if even the sparrows
and the children were earning their daily bread, as if the sky
itself, with its gray and scarlet clouds, reflected the serious
intention of the city beneath it, spoke of him. Here was the fit
place for their meeting, she thought; here was the fit place for
her to walk thinking of him. She could not help comparing it with
the domestic streets of Chelsea. With this comparison in her mind,
she extended her range a little, and turned into the main road.
The great torrent of vans and carts was sweeping down Kingsway;
pedestrians were streaming in two currents along the pavements.
She stood fascinated at the corner. The deep roar filled her ears;
the changing tumult had the inexpressible fascination of varied
life pouring ceaselessly with a purpose which, as she looked,
seemed to her, somehow, the normal purpose for which life was
framed; its complete indifference to the individuals, whom it
swallowed up and rolled onwards, filled her with at least a temporary
exaltation. The blend of daylight and of lamplight made her an
invisible spectator, just as it gave the people who passed her
a semi-transparent quality, and left the faces pale ivory ovals
in which the eyes alone were dark. They tended the enormous rush
of the current&mdash;the great flow, the deep stream, the unquenchable
tide. She stood unobserved and absorbed, glorying openly in the
rapture that had run subterraneously all day. Suddenly she was
clutched, unwilling, from the outside, by the recollection of
her purpose in coming there. She had come to find Ralph Denham.
She hastily turned back into Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and looked
for her landmark&mdash;the light in the three tall windows. She sought
in vain. The faces of the houses had now merged in the general
darkness, and she had difficulty in determining which she sought.
Ralph’s three windows gave back on their ghostly glass panels
only a reflection of the gray and greenish sky. She rang the bell,
peremptorily, under the painted name of the firm. After some delay
she was answered by a caretaker, whose pail and brush of themselves
told her that the working day was over and the workers gone. Nobody,
save perhaps Mr. Grateley himself, was left, she assured Katharine;
every one else had been gone these ten minutes.</p>

<p>The news woke Katharine completely. Anxiety gained upon her.
She hastened back into Kingsway, looking at people who had miraculously
regained their solidity. She ran as far as the Tube station, overhauling
clerk after clerk, solicitor after solicitor. Not one of them
even faintly resembled Ralph Denham. More and more plainly did
she see him; and more and more did he seem to her unlike any one
else. At the door of the station she paused, and tried to collect
her thoughts. He had gone to her house. By taking a cab she could
be there probably in advance of him. But she pictured herself
opening the drawing-room door, and William and Cassandra looking
up, and Ralph’s entrance a moment later, and the glances&mdash;the
insinuations. No; she could not face it. She would write him a
letter and take it at once to his house. She bought paper and
pencil at the bookstall, and entered an <em>A.B.C. </em>shop,
where, by ordering a cup of coffee, she secured an empty table,
and began at vice to write:</p>

<p>"I came to meet you and I have missed you. I could not face William
and Cassandra. They want us&mdash;" here she paused. "They insist that
we are engaged," she substituted, "and we couldn’t talk at all,
or explain anything. I want&mdash;" Her wants were so vast, now that
she was in communication with Ralph, that the pencil was utterly
inadequate to conduct them on to the paper; it seemed as if the
whole torrent of Kingsway had to run down her pencil. She gazed
intently at a notice hanging on the gold-encrusted wall opposite,
"... to say all kinds of things," she added, writing each word
with the painstaking of a child. But, when she raised her eyes
again to meditate the next sentence, she was aware of a waitress,
whose expression intimated that it was closing time, and, looking
round, Katharine saw herself almost the last person left in the
shop. She took up her letter, paid her bill, and found herself
once more in the street. She would now take a cab to Highgate.
But at that moment it flashed upon her that she could not remember
the address. This check seemed to let fall a barrier across a
very powerful current of desire. She ransacked her memory in desperation,
hunting for the name, first by remembering the look of the house,
and then by trying, in memory, to retrace the words she had written
once, at least, upon an envelope. The more she pressed the farther
the words receded. Was the house an Orchard Something, on the
street a Hill? She gave it up. Never, since she was a child, had
she felt anything like this blankness and desolation. There rushed
in upon her, as if she were waking from some dream, all the consequences
of her inexplicable indolence. She figured Ralph’s face as he
turned from her door without a word of explanation, receiving
his dismissal as a blow from herself, a callous intimation that
she did not wish to see him. She followed his departure from her
door; but it was far more easy to see him marching far and fast
in any direction for any length of time than to conceive that
he would turn back to Highgate. Perhaps he would try once more
to see her in Cheyne Walk? It was proof of the clearness with
which she saw him, that she started forward as this possibility
occurred to her, and almost raised her hand to beckon to a cab.
No; he was too proud to come again; he rejected the desire and
walked on and on, on and on &mdash;If only she could read the
names of those visionary streets down which he passed! But her
imagination betrayed her at this point, or mocked her with a sense
of their strangeness, darkness, and distance. Indeed, instead
of helping herself to any decision, she only filled her mind with
the vast extent of London and the impossibility of finding any
single figure that wandered off this way and that way, turned
to the right and to the left, chose that dingy little back street
where the children were playing in the road, and so &mdash;She
roused herself impatiently. She walked rapidly along Holborn.
Soon she turned and walked as rapidly in the other direction.
This indecision was not merely odious, but had something that
alarmed her about it, as she had been alarmed slightly once or
twice already that day; she felt unable to cope with the strength
of her own desires. To a person controlled by habit, there was
humiliation as well as alarm in this sudden release of what appeared
to be a very powerful as well as an unreasonable force. An aching
in the muscles of her right hand now showed her that she was crushing
her gloves and the map of Norfolk in a grip sufficient to crack
a more solid object. She relaxed her grasp; she looked anxiously
at the faces of the passers-by to see whether their eyes rested
on her for a moment longer than was natural, or with any curiosity.
But having smoothed out her gloves, and done what she could to
look as usual, she forgot spectators, and was once more given
up to her desperate desire to find Ralph Denham. It was a desire
now&mdash;wild, irrational, unexplained, resembling something felt
in childhood. Once more she blamed herself bitterly for her carelessness.
But finding herself opposite the Tube station, she pulled herself
up and took counsel swiftly, as of old. It flashed upon her that
she would go at once to Mary Datchet, and ask her to give her
Ralph’s address. The decision was a relief, not only in giving
her a goal, but in providing her with a rational excuse for her
own actions. It gave her a goal certainly, but the fact of having
a goal led her to dwell exclusively upon her obsession; so that
when she rang the bell of Mary’s flat, she did not for a moment
consider how this demand would strike Mary. To her extreme annoyance
Mary was not at home; a charwoman opened the door. All Katharine
could do was to accept the invitation to wait. She waited for,
perhaps, fifteen minutes, and spent them in pacing from one end
of the room to the other without intermission. When she heard
Mary’s key in the door she paused in front of the fireplace, and
Mary found her standing upright, looking at once expectant and
determined, like a person who has come on an errand of such importance
that it must be broached without preface.</p>

<p>Mary exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," Katharine said, brushing these remarks aside, as
if they were in the way.</p>

<p>"Have you had tea?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," she said, thinking that she had had tea hundreds of
years ago, somewhere or other.</p>

<p>Mary paused, took off her gloves, and, finding matches, proceeded
to light the fire.</p>

<p>Katharine checked her with an impatient movement, and said:</p>

<p>"Don’t light the fire for me.... I want to know Ralph Denham’s
address."</p>

<p>She was holding a pencil and preparing to write on the envelope.
She waited with an imperious expression.</p>

<p>"The Apple Orchard, Mount Ararat Road, Highgate," Mary said,
speaking slowly and rather strangely.</p>

<p>"Oh, I remember now!" Katharine exclaimed, with irritation at
her own stupidity. "I suppose it wouldn’t take twenty minutes
to drive there?"  She gathered up her purse and gloves and seemed
about to go.</p>

<p>"But you won’t find him," said Mary, pausing with a match in
her hand. Katharine, who had already turned towards the door,
stopped and looked at her.</p>

<p>"Why? Where is he?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He won’t have left his office."</p>

<p>"But he has left the office," she replied. "The only question
is will he have reached home yet? He went to see me at Chelsea;
I tried to meet him and missed him. He will have found no message
to explain. So I must find him&mdash;as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Mary took in the situation at her leisure.</p>

<p>"But why not telephone?" she said.</p>

<p>Katharine immediately dropped all that she was holding; her strained
expression relaxed, and exclaiming, "Of course! Why didn’t I think
of that!" she seized the telephone receiver and gave her number.
Mary looked at her steadily, and then left the room. At length
Katharine heard, through all the superimposed weight of London,
the mysterious sound of feet in her own house mounting to the
little room, where she could almost see the pictures and the books;
she listened with extreme intentness to the preparatory vibrations,
and then established her identity.</p>

<p>"Has Mr. Denham called?"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss."</p>

<p>"Did he ask for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We said you were out, miss."</p>

<p>"Did he leave any message?"</p>

<p>"No. He went away. About twenty minutes ago, miss."</p>

<p>Katharine hung up the receiver. She walked the length of the
room in such acute disappointment that she did not at first perceive
Mary’s absence. Then she called in a harsh and peremptory tone:</p>

<p>"Mary."</p>

<p>Mary was taking off her outdoor things in the bedroom. She heard
Katharine call her. "Yes," she said, "I shan’t be a moment." But
the moment prolonged itself, as if for some reason Mary found
satisfaction in making herself not only tidy, but seemly and ornamented.
A stage in her life had been accomplished in the last months which
left its traces for ever upon her bearing. Youth, and the bloom
of youth, had receded, leaving the purpose of her face to show
itself in the hollower cheeks, the firmer lips, the eyes no longer
spontaneously observing at random, but narrowed upon an end which
was not near at hand. This woman was now a serviceable human being,
mistress of her own destiny, and thus, by some combination of
ideas, fit to be adorned with the dignity of silver chains and
glowing brooches. She came in at her leisure and asked: "Well,
did you get an answer?"</p>

<p>"He has left Chelsea already," Katharine replied.</p>

<p>"Still, he won’t be home yet," said Mary.</p>

<p>Katharine was once more irresistibly drawn to gaze upon an imaginary
map of London, to follow the twists and turns of unnamed streets.</p>

<p>"I’ll ring up his home and ask whether he’s back." Mary crossed
to the telephone and, after a series of brief remarks, announced:</p>

<p>"No. His sister says he hasn’t come back yet."</p>

<p>"Ah!" She applied her ear to the telephone once more. "They’ve
had a message. He won’t be back to dinner."</p>

<p>"Then what is he going to do?"</p>

<p>Very pale, and with her large eyes fixed not so much upon Mary
as upon vistas of unresponding blankness, Katharine addressed
herself also not so much to Mary as to the unrelenting spirit
which now appeared to mock her from every quarter of her survey.</p>

<p>After waiting a little time Mary remarked indifferently:</p>

<p>"I really don’t know." Slackly lying back in her armchair, she
watched the little flames beginning to creep among the coals indifferently,
as if they, too, were very distant and indifferent.</p>

<p>Katharine looked at her indignantly and rose.</p>

<p>"Possibly he may come here," Mary continued, without altering
the abstract tone of her voice. "It would be worth your while
to wait if you want to see him to-night." She bent forward and
touched the wood, so that the flames slipped in between the interstices
of the coal.</p>

<p>Katharine reflected. "I’ll wait half an hour," she said.</p>

<p>Mary rose, went to the table, spread out her papers under the
green-shaded lamp and, with an action that was becoming a habit,
twisted a lock of hair round and round in her fingers. Once she
looked unperceived at her visitor, who never moved, who sat so
still, with eyes so intent, that you could almost fancy that she
was watching something, some face that never looked up at her.
Mary found herself unable to go on writing. She turned her eyes
away, but only to be aware of the presence of what Katharine looked
at. There were ghosts in the room, and one, strangely and sadly,
was the ghost of herself. The minutes went by.</p>

<p>"What would be the time now?" said Katharine at last. The half-hour
was not quite spent.</p>

<p>"I’m going to get dinner ready," said Mary, rising from her table.</p>

<p>"Then I’ll go," said Katharine.</p>

<p>"Why don’t you stay? Where are you going?"</p>

<p>Katharine looked round the room, conveying her uncertainty in
her glance.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I might find him," she mused.</p>

<p>"But why should it matter? You’ll see him another day."</p>

<p>Mary spoke, and intended to speak, cruelly enough.</p>

<p>"I was wrong to come here," Katharine replied.</p>

<p>Their eyes met with antagonism, and neither flinched.</p>

<p>"You had a perfect right to come here," Mary answered.</p>

<p>A loud knocking at the door interrupted them. Mary went to open
it, and returning with some note or parcel, Katharine looked away
so that Mary might not read her disappointment.</p>

<p>"Of course you had a right to come," Mary repeated, laying the
note upon the table.</p>

<p>"No," said Katharine. "Except that when one’s desperate one has
a sort of right. I am desperate. How do I know what’s happening
to him now? He may do anything. He may wander about the streets
all night. Anything may happen to him."</p>

<p>She spoke with a self-abandonment that Mary had never seen in
her.</p>

<p>"You know you exaggerate; you’re talking nonsense," she said
roughly.</p>

<p>"Mary, I must talk &mdash;I must tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You needn’t tell me anything," Mary interrupted her. "Can’t
I see for myself?"</p>

<p>"No, no," Katharine exclaimed. "It’s not that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her look, passing beyond Mary, beyond the verge of the room and
out beyond any words that came her way, wildly and passionately,
convinced Mary that she, at any rate, could not follow such a
glance to its end. She was baffled; she tried to think herself
back again into the height of her love for Ralph. Pressing her
fingers upon her eyelids, she murmured:</p>

<p>"You forget that I loved him too. I thought I knew him. I <em>DID
</em>know him."</p>

<p>And yet, what had she known? She could not remember it any more.
She pressed her eyeballs until they struck stars and suns into
her darkness. She convinced herself that she was stirring among
ashes. She desisted. She was astonished at her discovery. She
did not love Ralph any more. She looked back dazed into the room,
and her eyes rested upon the table with its lamp-lit papers. The
steady radiance seemed for a second to have its counterpart within
her; she shut her eyes; she opened them and looked at the lamp
again; another love burnt in the place of the old one, or so,
in a momentary glance of amazement, she guessed before the revelation
was over and the old surroundings asserted themselves. She leant
in silence against the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"There are different ways of loving," she murmured, half to herself,
at length.</p>

<p>Katharine made no reply and seemed unaware of her words. She
seemed absorbed in her own thoughts.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he’s waiting in the street again to-night," she exclaimed.
"I’ll go now. I might find him."</p>

<p>"It’s far more likely that he’ll come here," said Mary, and Katharine,
after considering for a moment, said:</p>

<p>"I’ll wait another half-hour."</p>

<p>She sank down into her chair again, and took up the same position
which Mary had compared to the position of one watching an unseeing
face. She watched, indeed, not a face, but a procession, not of
people, but of life itself: the good and bad; the meaning; the
past, the present, and the future. All this seemed apparent to
her, and she was not ashamed of her extravagance so much as exalted
to one of the pinnacles of existence, where it behoved the world
to do her homage. No one but she herself knew what it meant to
miss Ralph Denham on that particular night; into this inadequate
event crowded feelings that the great crises of life might have
failed to call forth. She had missed him, and knew the bitterness
of all failure; she desired him, and knew the torment of all passion.
It did not matter what trivial accidents led to this culmination.
Nor did she care how extravagant she appeared, nor how openly
she showed her feelings.</p>

<p>When the dinner was ready Mary told her to come, and she came
submissively, as if she let Mary direct her movements for her.
They ate and drank together almost in silence, and when Mary told
her to eat more, she ate more; when she was told to drink wine,
she drank it. Nevertheless, beneath this superficial obedience,
Mary knew that she was following her own thoughts unhindered.
She was not inattentive so much as remote; she looked at once
so unseeing and so intent upon some vision of her own that Mary
gradually felt more than protective&mdash;she became actually alarmed
at the prospect of some collision between Katharine and the forces
of the outside world. Directly they had done, Katharine announced
her intention of going.</p>

<p>"But where are you going to?" Mary asked, desiring vaguely to
hinder her.</p>

<p>"Oh, I’m going home&mdash;no, to Highgate perhaps."</p>

<p>Mary saw that it would be useless to try to stop her. All she
could do was to insist upon coming too, but she met with no opposition;
Katharine seemed indifferent to her presence. In a few minutes
they were walking along the Strand. They walked so rapidly that
Mary was deluded into the belief that Katharine knew where she
was going. She herself was not attentive. She was glad of the
movement along lamp-lit streets in the open air. She was fingering,
painfully and with fear, yet with strange hope, too, the discovery
which she had stumbled upon unexpectedly that night. She was free
once more at the cost of a gift, the best, perhaps, that she could
offer, but she was, thank Heaven, in love no longer. She was tempted
to spend the first instalment of her freedom in some dissipation;
in the pit of the Coliseum, for example, since they were now passing
the door. Why not go in and celebrate her independence of the
tyranny of love? Or, perhaps, the top of an omnibus bound for
some remote place such as Camberwell, or Sidcup, or the Welsh
Harp would suit her better. She noticed these names painted on
little boards for the first time for weeks. Or should she return
to her room, and spend the night working out the details of a
very enlightened and ingenious scheme? Of all possibilities this
appealed to her most, and brought to mind the fire, the lamplight,
the steady glow which had seemed lit in the place where a more
passionate flame had once burnt.</p>

<p>Now Katharine stopped, and Mary woke to the fact that instead
of having a goal she had evidently none. She paused at the edge
of the crossing, and looked this way and that, and finally made
as if in the direction of Haverstock Hill.</p>

<p>"Look here&mdash;where are you going?" Mary cried, catching her by
the hand. "We must take that cab and go home." She hailed a cab
and insisted that Katharine should get in, while she directed
the driver to take them to Cheyne Walk.</p>

<p>Katharine submitted. "Very well," she said. "We may as well go
there as anywhere else."</p>

<p>A gloom seemed to have fallen on her. She lay back in her corner,
silent and apparently exhausted. Mary, in spite of her own preoccupation,
was struck by her pallor and her attitude of dejection.</p>

<p>"I’m sure we shall find him," she said more gently than she had
yet spoken.</p>

<p>"It may be too late," Katharine replied. Without understanding
her, Mary began to pity her for what she was suffering.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," she said, taking her hand and rubbing it. "If we
don’t find him there we shall find him somewhere else."</p>

<p>"But suppose he’s walking about the streets&mdash;for hours and hours?"</p>

<p>She leant forward and looked out of the window.</p>

<p>"He may refuse ever to speak to me again," she said in a low
voice, almost to herself.</p>

<p>The exaggeration was so immense that Mary did not attempt to
cope with it, save by keeping hold of Katharine’s wrist. She half
expected that Katharine might open the door suddenly and jump
out. Perhaps Katharine perceived the purpose with which her hand
was held.</p>

<p>"Don’t be frightened," she said, with a little laugh. "I’m not
going to jump out of the cab. It wouldn’t do much good after all."</p>

<p>Upon this, Mary ostentatiously withdrew her hand.</p>

<p>"I ought to have apologized," Katharine continued, with an effort,
"for bringing you into all this business; I haven’t told you half,
either. I’m no longer engaged to William Rodney. He is to marry
Cassandra Otway. It’s all arranged&mdash;all perfectly right.... And
after he’d waited in the streets for hours and hours, William
made me bring him in. He was standing under the lamp-post watching
our windows. He was perfectly white when he came into the room.
William left us alone, and we sat and talked. It seems ages and
ages ago, now. Was it last night? Have I been out long? What’s
the time?" She sprang forward to catch sight of a clock, as if
the exact time had some important bearing on her case.</p>

<p>"Only half-past eight!" she exclaimed. "Then he may be there
still." She leant out of the window and told the cabman to drive
faster.</p>

<p>"But if he’s not there, what shall I do? Where could I find him?
The streets are so crowded."</p>

<p>"We shall find him," Mary repeated.</p>

<p>Mary had no doubt but that somehow or other they would find him.
But suppose they did find him? She began to think of Ralph with
a sort of strangeness, in her effort to understand how he could
be capable of satisfying this extraordinary desire. Once more
she thought herself back to her old view of him and could, with
an effort, recall the haze which surrounded his figure, and the
sense of confused, heightened exhilaration which lay all about
his neighborhood, so that for months at a time she had never exactly
heard his voice or seen his face&mdash;or so it now seemed to her.
The pain of her loss shot through her. Nothing would ever make
up&mdash;not success, or happiness, or oblivion. But this pang was
immediately followed by the assurance that now, at any rate, she
knew the truth; and Katharine, she thought, stealing a look at
her, did not know the truth; yes, Katharine was immensely to be
pitied.</p>

<p>The cab, which had been caught in the traffic, was now liberated
and sped on down Sloane Street. Mary was conscious of the tension
with which Katharine marked its progress, as if her mind were
fixed upon a point in front of them, and marked, second by second,
their approach to it. She said nothing, and in silence Mary began
to fix her mind, in sympathy at first, and later in forgetfulness
of her companion, upon a point in front of them. She imagined
a point distant as a low star upon the horizon of the dark. There
for her too, for them both, was the goal for which they were striving,
and the end for the ardors of their spirits was the same: but
where it was, or what it was, or why she felt convinced that they
were united in search of it, as they drove swiftly down the streets
of London side by side, she could not have said.</p>

<p>"At last," Katharine breathed, as the cab drew up at the door.
She jumped out and scanned the pavement on either side. Mary,
meanwhile, rang the bell. The door opened as Katharine assured
herself that no one of the people within view had any likeness
to Ralph. On seeing her, the maid said at once:</p>

<p>"Mr. Denham called again, miss. He has been waiting for you for
some time."</p>

<p>Katharine vanished from Mary’s sight. The door shut between them,
and Mary walked slowly and thoughtfully up the street alone.</p>

<p>Katharine turned at once to the dining-room. But with her fingers
upon the handle, she held back. Perhaps she realized that this
was a moment which would never come again. Perhaps, for a second,
it seemed to her that no reality could equal the imagination she
had formed. Perhaps she was restrained by some vague fear or anticipation,
which made her dread any exchange or interruption. But if these
doubts and fears or this supreme bliss restrained her, it was
only for a moment. In another second she had turned the handle
and, biting her lip to control herself, she opened the door upon
Ralph Denham. An extraordinary clearness of sight seemed to possess
her on beholding him. So little, so single, so separate from all
else he appeared, who had been the cause of these extreme agitations
and aspirations. She could have laughed in his face. But, gaining
upon this clearness of sight against her will, and to her dislike,
was a flood of confusion, of relief, of certainty, of humility,
of desire no longer to strive and to discriminate, yielding to
which, she let herself sink within his arms and confessed her
love.</p>
