<p>He found George sitting down in the verandah after waltzing.
His partner was a sister of Logan's, a dark girl whose husband
was Resident somewhere in Lower Kashmir. The lady gave her hand
to Lewis and he took the vacant seat on the other side.</p>

<p>He apologized for carrying off her companion, escorted her back
to the ballroom, and then returned to satisfy the amazed George.</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you. Excuse my rudeness, but I have explained
to Mrs. Tracy. I have a good many things I want to say to you."</p>

<p>"Where on earth have you been all night, Lewis? I call it confoundedly
mean to go off and leave me to do all the heavy work. I've never
been so busy in my life. Lots of girls and far too few men. This
is the first breathing space I've had. What is it that you want?"</p>

<p>"I am going off this very moment up into the hills. That letter
Marker sent me this morning has been confirmed. Holm, who commands
up at the Forza fort, has just come down very sick, and he says
that the Bada-Mawidi are looking ugly, and that we should take
Marker's word. He wanted to go back himself but he is too ill,
and Thwaite can't leave here, so I am going. I don't expect there
will be much risk, but in case the rising should be serious I
want you to do me a favour."</p>

<p>"I suppose I can't come with you," said George ruefully. "I know
I promised to let you go your own way before we came out, but
I wish you would let me stick by you. What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing desperate," said Lewis, laughing. "You can stay on here
and dance till sunrise if you like. But to-morrow I want you to
come up to a certain place at the foot of the hills which I will
tell you about, and wait there. It's about half distance between
Forza and the two Khautmi forts. If the rising turns out to be
a simple affair I'll join you there to-morrow night and we can
start our shooting. But if I don't, I want you to go up to the
Khautmi forts and rouse St. John and Mitchinson and get them to
send to Forza. Do you see?"</p>

<p>Lewis had taken out a pencil and began to sketch a rough plan
on George's shirt cuff. "This will give you an idea of the place.
You can look up a bigger map in the hotel, and Thwaite or any
one will give you directions about the road. There's Forza, and
there are the Khautmis about twenty miles west. Half-way between
the two is that long Nazri valley, and at the top is a tableland
strewn with boulders where you shoot mountain sheep. I've been
there, and the road between Khautmi and Forza passes over it.
I expect it is a very bad road, but apparently you can get a little
Kashmir pony to travel it. To the north of that plateau there
is said to be nothing but rock and snow for twenty miles to the
frontier. That may be so, but if this thing turns out all right
we'll look into the matter. Anyway, you have got to pitch your
tent to-morrow on that tableland just above the head of the Nazri
gully. With luck I should be able to get to you some time in the
afternoon. If I don't turn up, you go off to Khautmi next morning
at daybreak and give them my message. If I can't come myself I'll
find a way to send word; but if you don't hear from me it will
be fairly serious, for it will mean that the rising is a formidable
thing after all. And that, of course, will mean trouble for everybody
all round. In that case you'd better do what St. John and Mitchinson
tell you. You're sure to be wanted."</p>

<p>George's face cleared. "That sounds rather sport. I'd better
bring up the servants. They might turn out useful. And I suppose
I'll bring a couple of rifles for you, in case it's all a fraud
and we want to go shooting. I thought the place was going to be
stale, but it promises pretty well now." And he studied the plan
on his shirt cuff. Then an idea came to him.</p>

<p>"Suppose you find no rising. That will mean that Marker's letter
was a blind of some sort. He wanted to get you out of the way
or something. What will you do then? Come back here?"</p>

<p>"<em>N&mdash;</em>o," said Lewis hesitatingly. "I think Thwaite is
good enough, and I should be no manner of use. You and I will
wait up there in the hills on the off-chance of picking up some
news. I swear I won't come back here to hang about and try and
discover things. It's enough to drive a man crazy."</p>

<p>"It is rather a ghastly place. Wonder how the Logans thrive here.
Odd mixture this. Strauss and hill tribes not twenty miles apart."</p>

<p>Lewis laughed. "I think I prefer the hill tribes. I am not in
the humour for Strauss just now. I shall have to be off in an
hour, so I am going to change. See you to-morrow, old man."</p>

<p>George retired to the ballroom, where he had to endure the reproaches
of Mrs. Logan. He was an abstracted and silent partner, and in
the intervals of dancing he studied his cuff. Miss A talked to
him of polo, and Miss B of home; Miss C discovered that they had
common friends, and Miss D that she had known his sister. Miss
E, who was more observant, saw the cause of his distraction and
asked, "What queer hieroglyphics have you got on your cuff, Mr.
Winterham?"</p>

<p>George looked down in a bewildered way at his sleeve. "Where
on earth have I been?" he asked in wonder. "That's the worst of
being an absent-minded fellow. I've been scribbling on my cuff
with my programme pencil."</p>

<p>Soon he escaped, and made his way down to the garden gate, where
Thwaite was standing smoking. A <em>sais</em> held a saddled pony
by the road-side. Lewis, in rough shooting clothes, was preparing
to mount. From indoors came the jigging of a waltz tune and the
sound of laughter, while far in the north the cliffs of the pass
framed a dark blue cleft where the stars shone. George drew in
great draughts of the cool, fresh air. "I wish I was coming with
you," he said wistfully.</p>

<p>"You'll be in time enough to-morrow," said Lewis. "I wish you'd
give him all the information you can about the place, Thwaite.
He's an ignorant beggar. See that he remembers to bring food and
matches. The guns are the only things I can promise he won't forget."</p>

<p>Then he rode off, the little beast bucking excitedly at the patches
of moonlight, and the two men walked back to the house.</p>

<p>"Hope he comes back all right," said Thwaite. "He's too good
a man to throw away."</p>
