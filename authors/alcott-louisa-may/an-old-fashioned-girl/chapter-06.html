<p>“WHERE'S Polly?” asked Fan one snowy afternoon, as she came into the
dining-room where Tom was reposing on the sofa with his boots in the
air, absorbed in one of those delightful books in which boys are cast
away on desert islands, where every known fruit, vegetable and flower
is in its prime all the year round; or, lost in boundless forests, where
the young heroes have thrilling adventures, kill impossible beasts, and,
when the author's invention gives out, suddenly find their way home,
laden with tiger skins, tame buffaloes and other pleasing trophies of
their prowess.
</p>
<p>“Dun no,” was Tom's brief reply, for he was just escaping from an
alligator of the largest size.
</p><p>“Do put down that stupid book, and let's do something,” said Fanny,
after a listless stroll round the room.
</p><p>“Hi, they've got him!” was the only answer vouchsafed by the absorbed
reader.
</p><p>“Where's Polly?” asked Maud, joining the party with her hands full of
paper dolls all suffering for ball-dresses.
</p><p>“Do get along, and don't bother me,” cried Tom exasperated at the
interruption.
</p><p>“Then tell us where she is. I'm sure you know, for she was down here a
little while ago,” said Fanny.
</p><p>“Up in grandma's room, maybe.”
</p><p>“Provoking thing! you knew it all the time, and did n't tell, just to
plague us,” scolded Maud.
</p><p>But Tom was now under water stabbing his alligator, and took no notice
of the indignant departure of the young ladies.
</p><p>“Polly's always poking up in grandma's room. I don't see what fun there
is in it,” said Fanny as they went up stairs.
</p><p>“Polly's a verwy queer girl, and gwandma pets her a gweat deal more
than she does me,” observed Maud, with an injured air.
</p><p>“Let's peek and see what they are doing,” whispered Fan, pausing at the
half-open door.
</p><p>Grandma was sitting before a quaint old cabinet, the doors of which
stood wide open, showing glimpses of the faded relics treasured there.
On a stool, at the old lady's feet, sat Polly, looking up with intent
face and eager eyes, quite absorbed in the history of a high-heeled
brocade shoe which lay in her lap.
</p><p>“Well, my dear,” grandma was saying, “she had it on the very day that
Uncle Joe came in as she sat at work, and said, 'Dolly, we must be
married at once.' 'Very well, Joe,' says Aunt Dolly, and down she went
to the parlor, where the minister was waiting, never stopping to change
the dimity dress she wore, and was actually married with her scissors
and pin-ball at her side, and her thimble on. That was in war times,
1812, my dear, and Uncle Joe was in the army, so he had to go, and he
took that very little pin-ball with him. Here it is with the mark of
a bullet through it, for he always said his Dolly's cushion saved his
life.”
</p><p>“How interesting that is!” cried Polly, as she examined the faded
cushion with the hole in it.
</p><p>“Why, grandma, you never told me that story,” said Fanny, hurrying in,
finding the prospect was a pleasant one for a stormy afternoon.
</p><p>“You never asked me to tell you anything, my dear, so I kept my old
stories to myself,” answered grandma, quietly.
</p><p>“Tell some now, please. May we stay and see the funny things?” said Fan
and Maud, eyeing the open cabinet with interest.
</p><p>“If Polly likes; she is my company, and I am trying to entertain
her, for I love to have her come,” said grandma, with her old-time
politeness.
</p><p>“Oh, yes! do let them stay and hear the stories. I've often told them
what good times we have up here, and teased them to come, but they think
it's too quiet. Now, sit down, girls, and let grandma go on. You see I
pick out something in the cabinet that looks interesting, and then
she tells me about it,” said Polly, eager to include the girls in her
pleasures, and glad to get them interested in grandma's reminiscences,
for Polly knew how happy it made the lonely old lady to live over her
past, and to have the children round her.
</p><p>“Here are three drawers that have not been opened yet; each take one,
and choose something from it for me to tell about,” said Madam, quite
excited at the unusual interest in her treasures.
</p><p>So the girls each opened a drawer and turned over the contents till they
found something they wanted to know about. Maud was ready first, and
holding up an oddly shaped linen bag, with a big blue F embroidered on
it, demanded her story. Grandma smiled as she smoothed the old thing
tenderly, and began her story with evident pleasure.
</p><p>“My sister Nelly and I went to visit an aunt of ours, when we were
little girls, but we did n't have a very good time, for she was
extremely strict. One afternoon, when she had gone out to tea, and old
Debby, the maid, was asleep in her room, we sat on the doorstep, feeling
homesick, and ready for any thing to amuse us.
</p><p>“'What shall we do?' said Nelly.
</p><p>“Just as she spoke, a ripe plum dropped bounce on the grass before us,
as if answering her question. It was all the plum's fault, for if it
had n't fallen at that minute, I never should have had the thought which
popped into my mischievous mind.
</p><p>“'Let's have as many as we want, and plague Aunt Betsey, to pay her for
being so cross,' I said, giving Nelly half the great purple plum.
</p><p>“'It would be dreadful naughty,' began Nelly, 'but I guess we will,' she
added, as the sweet mouthful slipped down her throat.
</p><p>“'Debby's asleep. Come on, then, and help me shake,' I said, getting
up, eager for the fun.
</p><p>“We shook and shook till we got red in the face, but not one dropped,
for the tree was large, and our little arms were not strong enough
to stir the boughs. Then we threw stones, but only one green and one
half-ripe one came down, and my last stone broke the shed window, so
there was an end of that.
</p><p>“'It's as provoking as Aunt Betsey herself,' said Nelly, as we sat
down, out of breath.
</p><p>“'I wish the wind would come and blow'em down for us,' panted I,
staring up at the plums with longing eyes.
</p><p>“'If wishing would do any good, I should wish'em in my lap at once,'
added Nelly.
</p><p>“'You might as well wish'em in your mouth and done with it, if you are
too lazy to pick'em up. If the ladder was n't too heavy we could try
that,' said I, determined to have them.
</p><p>“'You know we can't stir it, so what is the use of talking about it? You
proposed getting the plums, now let's see you do it,' answered Nelly,
rather crossly, for she had bitten the green plum, and it puckered her
mouth.
</p><p>“'Wait a minute, and you will see me do it,' cried I, as a new thought
came into my naughty head.
</p><p>“'What are you taking your shoes and socks off for? You can't climb the
tree, Fan.'” 'Don't ask questions, but be ready to pick'em up when they
fall, Miss Lazybones.' “With this mysterious speech I pattered into
the house bare-footed and full of my plan. Up stairs I went to a window
opening on the shed roof. Out I got, and creeping carefully along till
I came near the tree, I stood up, and suddenly crowed like the little
rooster. Nelly looked up, and stared, and laughed, and clapped her hands
when she saw what I was going to do.
</p><p>“'I'm afraid you'll slip and get hurt.'” 'Don't care if I do; I'll
have those plums if I break my neck doing it,' and half sliding, half
walking I went down the sloping roof, till the boughs of the tree were
within my reach.
</p><p>“Hurrah!” cried Nelly, dancing down below, as my first shake sent a
dozen plums rattling round her.
</p><p>“'Hurrah!” cried I, letting go one branch and trying to reach another.
But as I did so my foot slipped, I tried to catch something to hold by,
but found nothing, and with a cry, down I fell, like a very big plum on
the grass below.
</p><p>“Fortunately the shed was low, the grass was thick and the tree broke my
fall, but I got a bad bump and a terrible shaking. Nelly thought I was
killed, and began to cry with her mouth full. But I picked myself up in
a minute, for I was used to such tumbles; and did n't mind the pain half
as much as the loss of the plums.
</p><p>“'Hush! Debby will hear and spoil all the fun. I said I'd get'em and I
have. See what lots have come down with me.'” So there had, for my fall
shook the tree almost as much as it did me, and the green and purple
fruit lay all about us.
</p><p>“By the time the bump on my forehead had swelled as big as a nut, our
aprons were half full, and we sat down to enjoy ourselves. But we did
n't. O dear, no! for many of the plums were not ripe, some were hurt by
the birds, some crushed in falling, and many as hard as stones. Nelly
got stung by a wasp, my head began to ache, and we sat looking at one
another rather dismally, when Nelly had a bright idea.
</p><p>“'Let's cook'em, then they'll be good, and we can put some away in
our little pails for to-morrow.'” 'That will be splendid! There's a
fire in the kitchen, Debby always leaves the kettle on, and we can use
her saucepan, and I know where the sugar is, and we'll have a grand
time.' “In we went, and fell to work very quietly. It was a large,
open fire-place, with the coals nicely covered up, and the big kettle
simmering on the hook. We raked open the fire, put on the saucepan, and
in it the best of our plums, with water enough to spoil them. But we did
n't know that, and felt very important as we sat waiting for it to boil,
each armed with a big spoon, while the sugar box stood between us ready
to be used.
</p><p>“How slow they were, to be sure! I never knew such obstinate things, for
they would n't soften, though they danced about in the boiling water,
and bobbed against the cover as if they were doing their best.
</p><p>“The sun began to get low, we were afraid Debby would come down, and
still those dreadful plums would n't look like sauce. At last they began
to burst, the water got a lovely purple, we put lots of sugar in, and
kept tasting till our aprons and faces were red, and our lips burnt with
the hot spoons.
</p><p>“'There's too much juice,' said Nelly, shaking her head wisely. 'It
ought to be thick and nice like mamma's.' “'I'll pour off some of the
juice, and we can drink it,' said I, feeling that I'd made a mistake in
my cooking.
</p><p>“So Nelly got a bowl, and I got a towel and lifted the big saucepan
carefully off. It was heavy and hot, and I was a little afraid of it,
but did n't like to say so. Just as I began to pour, Debby suddenly
called from the top of the stairs, 'Children, what under the sun are you
doing?' It startled us both. Nelly dropped the bowl and ran. I dropped
the saucepan and did n't run, for a part of the hot juice splashed upon
my bare feet, and ankles, and made me scream with dreadful pain.
</p><p>“Down rushed Debby to find me dancing about the kitchen with a great
bump on my forehead, a big spoon in my hand, and a pair of bright purple
feet. The plums were lying all over the hearth, the saucepan in the
middle of the room, the basin was broken, and the sugar swimming about
as if the bowl had turned itself over trying to sweeten our mess for us.
</p><p>“Debby was very good to me, for she never stopped to scold, but laid
me down on the old sofa, and bound up my poor little feet with oil and
cotton wool. Nelly, seeing me lie white and weak, thought I was dying,
and went over to the neighbor's for Aunt Betsey, and burst in upon the
old ladies sitting primly at, their tea, crying, distractedly, 'Oh, Aunt
Betsey, come quick! for the saucepan fell off the shed, and Fan's feet
are all boiled purple!' Nobody laughed at this funny message, and Aunt
Betsey ran all the way home with a muffin in her hand and her ball in
her pocket, though the knitting was left behind.
</p><p>“I suffered a great deal, but I was n't sorry afterward, for I learned
to love Aunt Betsey, who nursed me tenderly, and seemed to forget her
strict ways in her anxiety for me.
</p><p>“This bag was made for my special comfort, and hung on the sofa where I
lay all those weary days. Aunt kept it full of pretty patchwork or, what
I liked better, ginger-nuts, and peppermint drops, to amuse me, though
she did n't approve of cosseting children up, any more than I do now.”
</p><p>“I like that vewy well, and I wish I could have been there,” was Maud's
condescending remark, as she put back the little bag, after a careful
peep inside, as if she hoped to find an ancient ginger-nut, or a
well-preserved peppermint drop still lingering in some corner.
</p><p>“We had plums enough that autumn, but did n't seem to care much about
them, after all, for our prank became a household joke, and, for years,
we never saw the fruit, but Nelly would look at me with a funny face,
and whisper, 'Purple stockings, Fan!'”
</p><p>“Thank you, ma'am,” said Polly. “Now, Fan, your turn next.”
</p><p>“Well, I've a bundle of old letters, and I'd like to know if there
is any story about them,” answered Fanny, hoping some romance might be
forthcoming.
</p><p>Grandma turned over the little packet tied up with a faded pink ribbon;
a dozen yellow notes written on rough, thick paper, with red wafers
still adhering to the folds, showing plainly that they were written
before the day of initial note-paper and self-sealing envelopes.
</p><p>“They are not love-letters, deary, but notes from my mates after I left
Miss Cotton's boarding-school. I don't think there is any story about
them,” and grandma turned them over with spectacles before the dim eyes,
so young and bright when they first read the very same notes.
</p><p>Fanny was about to say, “I'll choose again,” when grandma began to
laugh so heartily that the girls felt sure she had caught some merry old
memory which would amuse them.
</p><p>“Bless my heart, I have n't thought of that frolic this forty years.
Poor, dear, giddy Sally Pomroy, and she's a great-grandmother now!”
 cried the old lady, after reading one of the notes, and clearing the
mist off her glasses.
</p><p>“Now, please tell about her; I know it's something funny to make you
laugh so,” said Polly and Fan together.
</p><p>“Well, it was droll, and I'm glad I remembered it for it's just the
story to tell you young things.
</p><p>“It was years ago,” began grandma, briskly, “and teachers were very much
stricter than they are now. The girls at Miss Cotton's were not allowed
lights in their rooms after nine o'clock, never went out alone, and were
expected to behave like models of propriety from morning till night.
</p><p>“As you may imagine, ten young girls, full of spirits and fun, found
these rules hard to keep, and made up for good behavior in public by all
sorts of frolics in private.
</p><p>“Miss Cotton and her brother sat in the back parlor after school was
over, and the young ladies were sent to bed. Mr. John was very deaf,
and Miss Priscilla very near-sighted, two convenient afflictions for the
girls on some occasions, but once they proved quite the reverse, as you
shall hear.
</p><p>“We had been very prim for a week, and our bottled up spirits could no
longer be contained; so we planed a revel after our own hearts, and set
our wits to work to execute it.
</p><p>“The first obstacle was surmounted in this way. As none of us could get
out alone, we resolved to lower Sally from the window, for she was light
and small, and very smart.
</p><p>“With our combined pocket-money she was to buy nuts and candy, cake and
fruit, pie, and a candle, so that we might have a light, after Betsey
took ours away as usual. We were to darken the window of the inner
chamber, set a watch in the little entry, light up, and then for a good
time.
</p><p>“At eight o'clock on the appointed evening, several of us professed
great weariness, and went to our room, leaving the rest sewing
virtuously with Miss Cotton, who read Hannah More's Sacred Dramas aloud,
in a way that fitted the listeners for bed as well as a dose of opium
would have done.
</p><p>“I am sorry to say I was one of the ringleaders; and as soon as we got
up stairs, produced the rope provided for the purpose, and invited Sally
to be lowered. It was an old-fashioned house, sloping down behind, and
the closet window chosen by us was not many feet from the ground.
</p><p>“It was a summer evening, so that at eight o'clock it was still light;
but we were not afraid of being seen, for the street was a lonely one,
and our only neighbors two old ladies, who put down their curtains at
sunset, and never looked out till morning.
</p><p>“Sally had been bribed by promises of as many'goodies' as she could
eat, and being a regular madcap, she was ready for anything.
</p><p>“Tying the rope round her waist she crept out, and we let her safely
down, sent a big basket after her, and saw her slip round the corner in
my big sun bonnet and another girl's shawl, so that she should not be
recognized.
</p><p>“Then we put our night-gowns over our dresses, and were laid peacefully
in bed when Betsey came up, earlier than usual; for it was evident that
Miss Cotton felt a little suspicious at our sudden weariness.
</p><p>“For half an hour we lay laughing and whispering, as we waited for the
signal from Sally. At last we heard a cricket chirp shrilly under the
window, and flying up, saw a little figure below in the twilight.
</p><p>“'O, quick! quick!' cried Sally, panting with haste. 'Draw up the basket
and then get me in, for I saw Mr. Cotton in the market, and ran all
the way home, so that I might get in before he came.' Up came the heavy
basket, bumping and scraping on the way, and smelling, O, so nice!
Down went the rope, and with a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all
together, we hoisted poor Sally half-way up to the window, when, sad to
tell, the rope slipped and down she fell, only being saved from broken
bones by the hay-cock under the window.
</p><p>“'He's coming! he's coming! O pull me up, for mercy sake!' cried
Sally, scrambling to her feet unhurt, but a good deal shaken.
</p><p>“We saw a dark figure approaching, and dragged her in with more bumping
and scraping, and embraced her with rapture, for we had just escaped
being detected by Mr. John, whose eyes were as sharp as his ears were
dull.
</p><p>“We heard the front-door shut, then a murmur of voices, and then
Betsey's heavy step coming up stairs.
</p><p>“Under the bed went the basket, and into the beds went the conspirators,
and nothing could have been more decorous than the appearance of the
room when Betsey popped her head in.
</p><p>“'Master's an old fidget to send me travelling up again, just because
he fancied he saw something amiss at the window. Nothing but a curtain
flapping, or a shadder, for the poor dears is sleeping like lambs.' We
heard her say this to herself, and a general titter agitated the white
coverlets as she departed.
</p><p>“Sally was in high feather at the success of her exploit, and danced
about like an elf, as she put her night-gown on over her frock, braided
her hair in funny little tails all over her head, and fastened the great
red pin-cushion on her bosom for a breast-pin in honor of the feast.
</p><p>“The other girls went to their rooms as agreed upon, and all was soon
dark and still up stairs, while Miss Cotton began to enjoy herself
below, as she always did when'her young charges' were safely disposed
of.
</p><p>“Then ghosts began to walk, and the mice scuttled back to their holes
in alarm, for white figures glided from room to room, till all were
assembled in the little chamber.
</p><p>“The watch was set at the entry door, the signal agreed upon, the candle
lighted, and the feast spread forth upon a newspaper on the bed, with
the coverlet arranged so that it could be whisked over the refreshments
at a moment's notice.
</p><p>“How good everything was, to be sure! I don't think I've eaten any
pies since that had such a delicious flavor as those broken ones, eaten
hastily, in that little oven of a room, with Sally making jokes and the
others enjoying stolen sweets with true girlish relish. Of course it was
very wicked, but I must tell the truth.
</p><p>“We were just beginning on the cake when the loud scratching of a rat
disturbed us.
</p><p>“'The signal! fly! run! hide! Hush, don't laugh!' cried several voices,
and we scuttled into bed as rapidly and noiselessly as possible, with
our mouths and hands full.
</p><p>“A long pause, broken by more scratching; but as no one came, we decided
on sending to inquire what it meant. I went and found Mary, the picket
guard half asleep, and longing for her share of the feast.
</p><p>“'It was a real rat; I've not made a sound. Do go and finish; I'm
tired of this,' said Mary, slapping away at the mosquitoes.
</p><p>“Back I hurried with the good news. Every one flew up, briskly. We
lighted the candle again, and returned to our revel. The refreshments
were somewhat injured by Sally's bouncing in among them, bit we did n't
care, and soon finished the cake.
</p><p>“'Now let's have the nuts,' I said, groping for the paper bag.
</p><p>“'They are almonds and peanuts, so we can crack them with our teeth. Be
sure you get the bag by the right end,' said Sally.
</p><p>“'I know what I'm about,' and to show her that it was all right, I
gave the bag a little shake, when out flew the nuts, rattling like a
hail-storm all over the uncarpeted floor.
</p><p>“'Now you've done it,' cried Sally, as Mary scratched like a mad rat,
and a door creaked below, for Miss Cotton was not deaf.
</p><p>“Such a flurry as we were in! Out went the candle, and each one rushed
away with as much of the feast as she could seize in her haste. Sally
dived into her bed, recklessly demolishing the last pie, and scattering
the candy far and wide.
</p><p>“Poor Mary was nearly caught for Miss Cotton was quicker than Betsey,
and our guard had to run for her life.
</p><p>“Our room was the first, and was in good order, though the two flushed
faces on the pillows were rather suspicious. Miss Cotton stood staring
about her, looking so funny, without her cap, that my bedfellow would
have gone off in a fit of laughter, if I had not pinched her warningly.
</p><p>“'Young ladies, what is this unseemly noise?' No answer from us but
a faint snore. Miss Cotton marched into the next room, put the same
question and received the same reply.
</p><p>“In the third chamber lay Sally, and we trembled as the old lady went
in. Sitting up, we peeped and listened breathlessly.
</p><p>“'Sarah, I command you to tell me what this all means?' But Sally only
sighed in her sleep, and muttered, wickedly, 'Ma, take me home. I'm
starved at Cotton's.' 'Mercy on me! is the child going to have a fever?'
cried the old lady, who did not observe the tell tale nuts at her feet.
</p><p>“'So dull, so strict! O take me home!' moaned Sally, tossing her arms
and gurgling, like a naughty little gypsy.
</p><p>“That last bit of acting upset the whole concern, for as she tossed her
arms she showed the big red cushion on her breast. Near-sighted as she
was, that ridiculous object could not escape Miss Cotton, neither did
the orange that rolled out from the pillow, nor the boots appearing at
the foot of the bed.
</p><p>“With sudden energy the old lady plucked off the cover, and there lay
Sally with her hair dressed, la Topsy, her absurd breast-pin and her
dusty boots, among papers of candy, bits of pie and cake, oranges and
apples, and a candle upside down burning a hole in the sheet.
</p><p>“At the sound of Miss Cotton's horrified exclamation Sally woke up, and
began laughing so merrily that none of us could resist following her
example, and the rooms rang with merriment far many minutes. I really
don't know when we should have stopped if Sally had not got choked with
the nut she had in her mouth, and so frightened us nearly out of our
wits.”
</p><p>“What became of the things, and how were you punished?” asked Fan, in
the middle of her laughter.
</p><p>“The remains of the feast went to the pig, and we were kept on bread and
water for three days.”
</p><p>“Did that cure you?”
</p><p>“Oh, dear, no! we had half a dozen other frolics that very summer; and
although I cannot help laughing at the remembrance of this, you must not
think, child, that I approve of such conduct, or excuse it. No, no, my
dear, far from it.”
</p><p>“I call that a tip-top story! Drive on, grandma, and tell one about
boys,” broke in a new voice, and there was Tom astride of a chair
listening and laughing with all his might, for his book had come to an
end, and he had joined the party unobserved.
</p><p>“Wait for your turn, Tommy. Now, Polly, dear, what will you have?”
 said grandma, looking, so lively and happy, that it was very evident
“reminiscing” did her good.
</p><p>“Let mine come last, and tell one for Tom next,” said Polly, looking
round, and beckoning him nearer.
</p><p>He came and sat himself cross-legged on the floor, before the lower
drawer of the cabinet, which grandma opened for him, saying, with a
benign stroke of the curly head, “There, dear, that's where I keep the
little memorials of my brother Jack. Poor lad, he was lost at sea, you
know. Well, choose anything you like, and I'll try to remember a story
about it.”
</p><p>Tom made a rapid rummage, and fished up a little broken pistol.
</p><p>“There, that's the chap for me! Wish it was n't spoilt, then we'd have
fun popping away at the cats in the yard. Now, then, grandma.”
</p><p>“I remember one of Jack's pranks, when that was used with great effect,”
 said grandma, after a thoughtful pause, during which Tom teased the
girls by snapping the lock of the pistol in their faces.
</p><p>“Once upon a time,” continued Madam, much flattered by the row of
interested faces before her, “my father went away on business, leaving
mother, aunt, and us girls to Jack's care. Very proud he was, to be
sure, of the responsibility, and the first thing he did was to load that
pistol and keep it by his bed, in our great worriment, for we feared he
'd kill himself with it. For a week all went well; then we were startled
by the news that robbers were about. All sorts of stories flew through
the town (we were living in the country then); some said that certain
houses were marked with a black cross, and those were always robbed;
others, that there was a boy in the gang, for windows, so small that
they were considered safe, were entered by some little rogue. At one
place the thieves had a supper, and left ham and cake in the front yard.
Mrs. Jones found Mrs. Smith's shawl in her orchard, with a hammer and
an unknown teapot near it. One man reported that some one tapped at
his window, in the night, saying, softly, 'Is anyone here?' and when he
looked out, two men were seen to run down the road.
</p><p>“We lived just out of town, in a lonely place; the house was old, with
convenient little back windows, and five outside doors. Jack was the
only man about the place, and he was barely thirteen. Mother and aunt
were very timid, and the children weren't old enough to be of any
use, so Jack and I were the home-guard, and vowed to defend the family
manfully.”
</p><p>“Good for you! Hope the fellows came!” cried Tom, charmed with this
opening.
</p><p>“One day, an ill-looking man came in and asked for food,” continued
grandma, with a mysterious nod; “and while he ate, I saw him glance
sharply about from the wooden buttons on the back-doors, to the silver
urn and tankards on the dining-room sideboard. A strong suspicion took
possession of me, and I watched him as a cat does a mouse.
</p><p>“'He came to examine the premises, I'm sure of it, but we will be ready
for him,' I said, fiercely, as I told the family about him.
</p><p>“This fancy haunted us all, and our preparations were very funny. Mother
borrowed a rattle, and kept it under her pillow. Aunt took a big bell
to bed with her; the children had little Tip, the terrier, to sleep in
their room; while Jack and I mounted guard, he with the pistol, and I
with a hatchet, for I did n't like fire-arms. Biddy, who slept in the
attic, practised getting out on the shed roof, so that she might run
away at the first alarm. Every night we arranged pit-falls for the
robbers, and all filed up to bed, bearing plate, money, weapons, and
things to barricade with, as if we lived in war times.
</p><p>“We waited a week and no one came, so we began to feel rather slighted,
for other people got'a scare,' as Tom says, and after all our
preparations we really felt a trifle disappointed that we had had no
chance to show our courage. At last a black mark was found upon our
door, and a great panic ensued, for we felt that now our time had come.
</p><p>“That night we put a tub of water at the bottom of the back-stairs, and
a pile of tin pans at the top of the front stairs, so that any attempt
to come up would produce a splash or a rattle. Bells were hung on door
handles, sticks of wood piled up in dark corners for robbers to fall
over, and the family retired, all armed and all provided with lamps and
matches.
</p><p>“Jack and I left our doors open, and kept asking one another if we did
n't hear something, till he fell asleep. I was wakeful and lay listening
to the crickets till the clock struck twelve; then I got drowsy, and
was just dropping off when the sound of steps outside woke me up staring
wide awake. Creeping to the window I was in time to see by the dim
moonlight a shadow glide round the corner and disappear. A queer little
thrill went over me, but I resolved to keep quiet till I was sure
something was wrong, for I had given so many false alarms, I did n't
want Jack to laugh at me again. Popping my head out of the door, I
listened, and presently heard a scraping sound near the shed.
</p><p>“'There they are; but I won't rouse the house till the bell rings or the
pans fall. The rogues can't go far without a clatter of some sort, and
if we could only catch one of them we should get the reward and a deal
of glory,' I said to myself, grasping my hatchet firmly.
</p><p>“A door closed softly below, and a step came creeping towards the
back-stairs. Sure now of my prey, I was just about to scream 'Jack!'
when something went splash into the tub at the foot of the back-stairs.
</p><p>“In a minute every one was awake and up, for Jack fired his pistol
before he was half out of bed, and roared 'Fire!' so loud it roused the
house. Mother sprung her rattle, aunt rang her bell, Jip barked like
mad, and we all screamed, while from below came up a regular Irish howl.
</p><p>“Some one brought a lamp, and we peeped anxiously down, to see our own
stupid Biddy sitting in the tub wringing her hands and wailing dismally.
</p><p>“'Och, murther, and it's kilt I am! The saints be about us! how iver
did I come forninst this say iv wather, just crapin in quiet afther
a bit iv sthroll wid Mike Mahoney, me own b'y, that's to marry me
intirely, come Saint Patrick's day nixt.' We laughed so we could hardly
fish the poor thing up, or listen while she explained that she had
slipped out of her window for a word with Mike, and found it fastened
when she wanted to come back, so she had sat on the roof, trying to
discover the cause of this mysterious barring out, till she was
tired, when she prowled round the house till she found a cellar window
unfastened, after all our care, and got in quite cleverly, she thought;
but the tub was a new arrangement which she knew nothing about; and when
she fell into the'say,' she was bewildered and could only howl.
</p><p>“This was not all the damage either, for aunt fainted with the fright,
mother cut her hand with a broken lamp, the children took cold hopping
about on the wet stairs, Jip barked himself sick, I sprained my ankle,
and Jack not only smashed a looking-glass with his bullets, but spoilt
his pistol by the heavy charge put in it. After the damages were
repaired and the flurry was well over, Jack confessed that he had marked
the door for fun, and shut Biddy out as a punishment for'gallivanting,'
of which he did n't approve. Such a rogue as that boy was!'”
</p><p>“But did n't the robbers ever come?” cried Tom, enjoying the joke, but
feeling defrauded of the fight.
</p><p>“Never, my dear; but we had our'scare,' and tested our courage, and
that was a great satisfaction, of course,” answered grandma, placidly.
</p><p>“Well, I think you were the bravest of the lot. I'd like to have seen
you flourishing round there with your hatchet,” added Tom, admiringly,
and the old lady looked as much pleased with the compliment as if she
had been a girl.
</p><p>“I choose this,” said Polly, holding up a long white kid glove, shrunken
and yellow with time, but looking as if it had a history.
</p><p>“Ah, that now has a story worth telling!” cried grandma; adding,
proudly, “Treat that old glove respectfully, my children, for
Lafayette's honored hand has touched it.”
</p><p>“Oh, grandma, did you wear it? Did you see him? Do tell us all about it,
and that will be the best of the whole,” cried Polly, who loved history,
and knew a good deal about the gallant Frenchman and his brave life.
</p><p>Grandma loved to tell this story, and always assumed her most imposing
air to do honor to her theme. Drawing herself up, therefore, she folded
her hands, and after two or three little “hems,” began with an absent
look, as if her eyes beheld a far-away time, which brightened as she
gazed.
</p><p>“The first visit of Lafayette was before my time, of course, but I heard
so much about it from my grandfather that I really felt as if I'd seen
it all. Our Aunt Hancock lived in the Governor's house, on Beacon Hill,
at that time.” Here the old lady bridled up still more, for she was very
proud of “our aunt.” “Ah, my dears, those were the good old times!” she
continued, with a sigh. “Such dinners and tea parties, such damask
table cloths and fine plate, such solid, handsome furniture and elegant
carriages; aunt's was lined with red silk velvet, and when the coach
was taken away from her at the Governor's death, she just ripped out
the lining, and we girls had spencers made of it. Dear heart, how well
I remember playing in aunt's great garden, and chasing Jack up and down
those winding stairs; and my blessed father, in his plum-colored coat
and knee buckles, and the queue I used to tie up for him every day,
handing aunt in to dinner, looking so dignified and splendid.”
</p><p>Grandma seemed to forget her story for a minute, and become a little
girl again, among the playmates dead and gone so many years. Polly
motioned the others to be quiet, and no one spoke till the old lady,
with a long sigh, came back to the present, and went on.
</p><p>“Well, as I was saying, the Governor wanted to give a breakfast to the
French officers, and Madam, who was a hospitable soul, got up a splendid
one for them. But by some mistake, or accident, it was discovered at the
last minute that there was no milk.
</p><p>“A great deal was needed, and very little could be bought or borrowed,
so despair fell upon the cooks and maids, and the great breakfast would
have been a failure, if Madam, with the presence of mind of her sex, had
not suddenly bethought herself of the cows feeding on the Common.
</p><p>“To be sure, they belonged to her neighbors, and there was no time to
ask leave, but it was a national affair; our allies must be fed; and
feeling sure that her patriotic friends would gladly lay their cows on
the altar of their country, Madam Hancock covered herself with glory,
by calmly issuing the command, 'Milk'em!' It was done, to the great
astonishment of the cows, and the entire satisfaction of the guests,
among whom was Lafayette.
</p><p>“This milking feat was such a good joke, that no one seems to have
remembered much about the great man, though one of his officers, a
count, signalized himself by getting very tipsy, and going to bed with
his boots and spurs on, which caused the destruction of aunt's best
yellow damask coverlet, for the restless sleeper kicked it into rags by
morning.
</p><p>“Aunt valued it very much, even in its tattered condition, and kept it a
long while, as a memorial of her distinguished guests.
</p><p>“The time when I saw Lafayette was in 1825, and there were no tipsy
counts then. Uncle Hancock (a sweet man, my dears, though some call him
mean now-a-days) was dead, and aunt had married Captain Scott.
</p><p>“It was not at all the thing for her to do; however, that's neither
here nor there. She was living in Federal Street at the time, a most
aristocratic street then, children, and we lived close by.
</p><p>“Old Josiah Quincy was mayor of the city, and he sent aunt word that the
Marquis Lafayette wished to pay his respects to her.
</p><p>“Of course she was delighted, and we all flew about to make ready for
him. Aunt was an old lady, but she made a grand toilet, and was as
anxious to look well as any girl.”
</p><p>“What did she wear?” asked Fan, with interest.
</p><p>“She wore a steel-colored satin, trimmed with black lace, and on her cap
was pinned a Lafayette badge of white satin.
</p><p>“I never shall forget how b-e-a-utifully she looked as she sat in state
on the front parlor sophy, right under a great portrait of her first
husband; and on either side of her sat Madam Storer and Madam Williams,
elegant to behold, in their stiff silks, rich lace, and stately turbans.
We don't see such splendid old ladies now-a-days.”
</p><p>“I think we do sometimes,” said Polly, slyly.
</p><p>Grandma shook her head, but it pleased her very much to be admired, for
she had been a beauty in her day.
</p><p>“We girls had dressed the house with flowers; old Mr. Coolidge sent in a
clothes-basket full. Joe Joy provided the badges, and aunt got out some
of the Revolutionary wine from the old Beacon Street cellar.
</p><p>“I wore my green and white palmyrine, my hair bowed high, the beautiful
leg-o'-mutton sleeves that were so becoming, and these very gloves.
</p><p>“Well, by-and-by the General, escorted by the Mayor, drove up. Dear me,
I see him now! a little old man in nankeen trousers and vest, a long
blue coat and ruffled shirt, leaning on his cane, for he was lame, and
smiling and bowing like a true Frenchman.
</p><p>“As he approached, the three old ladies rose, and courtesied with the
utmost dignity. Lafayette bowed first to the Governor's picture, then to
the Governor's widow, and kissed her hand.
</p><p>“That was droll; for on the back of her glove was stamped Lafayette's
likeness, and the gallant old gentleman kissed his own face.
</p><p>“Then some of the young ladies were presented, and, as if to escape any
further self-salutations, the marquis kissed the pretty girls on the
cheek.
</p><p>“Yes, my dears, here is just the spot where the dear old man saluted me.
I'm quite as proud of it now as I was then, for he was a brave, good
man, and helped us in our trouble.
</p><p>“He did not stay long, but we were very merry, drinking his health,
receiving his compliments, and enjoying the honor he did us.
</p><p>“Down in the street there was a crowd, of course, and when he left they
wanted to take out the horses and drag him home in triumph. But he did
n't wish it; and while that affair was being arranged, we girls had been
pelting him with the flowers which we tore from the vases, the walls,
and our own topknots, to scatter over him.
</p><p>“He liked that, and laughed, and waved his hand to us, while we ran, and
pelted, and begged him to come again.
</p><p>“We young folks quite lost our heads that night, and I have n't a very
clear idea of how I got home. The last thing I remember was hanging out
of the window with a flock of girls, watching the carriage roll away,
while the crowd cheered as if they were mad.
</p><p>“Bless my heart, it seems as if I heard'em now! 'Hurrah for Lafayette
and Mayor Quincy! Hurrah for Madam Hancock and the pretty girls! Hurrah
for Col. May!' 'Three cheers for Boston! Now, then! Hurrah! Hurrah!
Hurrah!'”
</p><p>And here the old lady stopped, out of breath, with her cap askew, her
spectacles on the end of her nose, and her knitting much the worse for
being waved enthusiastically in the air, while she hung over the arm of
her chair, shrilly cheering an imaginary Lafayette. The girls clapped
their hands, and Tom hurrahed with all his might, saying, when he got
his breath, “Lafayette was a regular old trump; I always liked him.”
</p><p>“My dear! what a disrespectful way to speak of that great man,” said
grandma, shocked at Young America's irreverence.
</p><p>“Well, he was a trump, anyway, so why not call him one?” asked Tom,
feeling that the objectionable word was all that could be desired.
</p><p>“What queer gloves you wore then,” interrupted Fanny, who had been
trying on the much-honored glove, and finding it a tight fit.
</p><p>“Much better and cheaper than we have now,” returned grandma, ready
to defend “the good old times” against every insinuation. “You are an
extravagant set now-a-days, and I really don't know what you are coming
to. By the way, I've got somewhere two letters written by two young
ladies, one in 1517, and the other in 1868. The contrast between the two
will amuse you, I think.”
</p><p>After a little search, grandma produced an old portfolio, and selecting
the papers, read the following letter, written by Anne Boleyn before
her marriage to Henry VIII, and now in the possession of a celebrated
antiquarian:
</p><p>DEAR MARY, I have been in town almost a month, yet I cannot say I have
found anything in London extremely agreeable. We rise so late in the
morning, seldom before six o'clock, and sit up so late at night, being
scarcely in bed before ten, that I am quite sick of it; and was it not
for the abundance of fine things I am every day getting I should be
impatient of returning into the country.
</p><p>My indulgent mother bought me, yesterday, at a merchant's in Cheapside,
three new shifts, that cost fourteen pence an ell, and I am to have a
pair of new stuff shoes, for my Lord of Norfolk's ball, which will be
three shillings.
</p><p>The irregular life I have led since my coming to this place has quite
destroyed my appetite. You know I could manage a pound of bacon and a
tankard of good ale for my breakfast, in the country, but in London I
find it difficult to get through half the quantity, though I must own
I am generally eager enough for the dinner hour, which is here delayed
till twelve, in your polite society.
</p><p>I played at hot cockles, last night, at my Lord of Leicester's. The Lord
of Surrey was there, a very elegant young man, who sung a song of
his own composition, on the “Lord of Kildare's Daughter.” It was much
approved, and my brother whispered me that the fair Geraldine, for so my
Lord of Surrey calls his sweetheart, is the finest woman of the age. I
should be glad to see her, for I hear she is good as she is beautiful.
</p><p>Pray take care of the poultry during my absence. Poor things! I always
fed them myself; and if Margery has knitted me the crimson worsted
mittens, I should be glad if they were sent up the first opportunity.
</p><p>Adieu, dear Mary. I am just going to mass, and you shall speedily have
the prayers, as you have now the kindest love of your own ANNE BOLEYN.
</p><p>“Up before six, and think it late to go to bed at ten! What a
countrified thing Anne must have been. Bacon and ale for breakfast, and
dinner at twelve; how very queer to live so!” cried Fanny. “Lord Surrey
and Lord Leicester sound fine, but hot cockles, and red mittens, and
shoes for three shillings, are horrid.”
</p><p>“I like it,” said Polly, thoughtfully, “and I'm glad poor Anne had a
little fun before her troubles began. May I copy that letter some time,
grandma?”
</p><p>“Yes, dear, and welcome. Now, here's the other, by a modern girl on her
first visit to London. This will suit you better, Fan,” and grandma
read what a friend had sent her as a pendant to Anne's little picture of
London life long ago:
</p><p>MY DEAREST CONSTANCE, After three months of intense excitement I snatch
a leisure moment to tell you how much I enjoy my first visit to London.
Having been educated abroad, it really seems like coming to a strange
city. At first the smoke, dirt and noise were very disagreeable, but
I soon got used to these things, and now find all I see perfectly
charming.
</p><p>We plunged at once into a whirl of gayety and I have had no time to
think of anything but pleasure. It is the height of the season, and
every hour is engaged either in going to balls, concerts, theatres,
fetes and church, or in preparing for them. We often go to two or three
parties in an evening, and seldom get home till morning, so of course
we don't rise till noon next day. This leaves very little time for our
drives, shopping, and calls before dinner at eight, and then the evening
gayeties begin again.
</p><p>At a ball at Lady Russell's last night, I saw the Prince of Wales, and
danced in the set with him. He is growing stout, and looks dissipated. I
was disappointed in him, for neither in appearance nor conversation was
he at all princely. I was introduced to a very brilliant and delightful
young gentleman from America. I was charmed with him, and rather
surprised to learn that he wrote the poems which were so much admired
last season, also that he is the son of a rich tailor. How odd these
Americans are, with their money, and talent, and independence!
</p><p>O my dear, I must not forget to tell you the great event of my first
season. I am to be presented at the next Drawing Room! Think how
absorbed I must be in preparation for this grand affair. Mamma is
resolved that I shall do her credit, and we have spent the last two
weeks driving about from milliners to mantua-makers, from merchants to
jewellers. I am to wear white satin and plumes, pearls and roses. My
dress will cost a hundred pounds or more, and is very elegant.
</p><p>My cousins and friends lavish lovely things upon me, and you will open
your unsophisticated eyes when I display my silks and laces, trinkets
and French hats, not to mention billet deux, photographs, and other
relics of a young belle's first season.
</p><p>You ask if I ever think of home. I really have n't time, but I do
sometimes long a little for the quiet, the pure air and the girlish
amusements I used to enjoy so much. One gets pale, and old, and sadly
fagged out, with all this dissipation, pleasant as it is. I feel quite
blasé already.
</p><p>If you could send me the rosy cheeks, bright eyes, and gay spirits I
always had at home, I'd thank you. As you cannot do that, please send
me a bottle of June rain water, for my maid tells me it is better than
any cosmetic for the complexion, and mine is getting ruined by late
hours.
</p><p>I fancy some fruit off our own trees would suit me, for I have no
appetite, and mamma is quite desolate about me. One cannot live on
French cookery without dyspepsia, and one can get nothing simple here,
for food, like everything else, is regulated by the fashion.
</p><p>Adieu, ma chere, I must dress for church. I only wish you could see my
new hat and go with me, for Lord Rockingham promised to be there.
</p><p>Adieu, yours eternally, FLORENCE.
</p><p>“Yes, I do like that better, and I wish I had been in this girl's place,
don't you, Polly?” said Fan, as grandma took off her glasses.
</p><p>“I should love to go to London, and have a good time, but I don't think
I should care about spending ever so much money, or going to Court.
Maybe I might when I got there, for I do like fun and splendor,” added
honest Polly, feeling that pleasure was a very tempting thing.
</p><p>“Grandma looks tired; let's go and play in the dwying-woom,” said Maud,
who found the conversation getting beyond her depth.
</p><p>“Let us all kiss and thank grandma, for amusing us so nicely, before
we go,” whispered Polly. Maud and Fanny agreed, and grandma looked so
gratified by their thanks, that Tom followed suit, merely waiting till
“those girls” were out of sight, to give the old lady a hearty hug, and
a kiss on the very cheek Lafayette had saluted.
</p><p>When he reached the play-room Polly was sitting in the swing, saying,
very earnestly, “I always told you it was nice up in grandma's room, and
now you see it is. I wish you'd go oftener; she admires to have you,
and likes to tell stories and do pleasant things, only she thinks you
don't care for her quiet sort of fun. I do, anyway, and I think she's
the kindest, best old lady that ever lived, and I love her dearly!”
</p><p>“I did n't say she was n't, only old people are sort of tedious and
fussy, so I keep out of their way,” said Fanny.
</p><p>“Well, you ought not to, and you miss lots of pleasant times. My mother
says we ought to be kind and patient and respectful to all old folks
just because they are old, and I always mean to be.”
</p><p>“Your mother's everlastingly preaching,” muttered Fan, nettled by the
consciousness of her own shortcomings with regard to grandma.
</p><p>“She don't preach!” cried Polly, firing up like a flash; “she only
explains things to us, and helps us be good, and never scolds, and I
'd rather have her than any other mother in the world, though she don't
wear velvet cloaks and splendid bonnets, so now!”
</p><p>“Go it, Polly!” called Tom, who was gracefully hanging head downward
from the bar put up for his special benefit.
</p><p>“Polly's mad! Polly's mad!” sung Maud, skipping rope round the room.
</p><p>“If Mr. Sydney could see you now he would n't think you such an angel
any more,” added Fanny, tossing a bean-bag and her head at the same
time.
</p><p>Polly was mad, her face was very red, her eyes very bright and her lips
twitched, but she held her tongue and began to swing as hard as she
could, fearing to say something she would be sorry for afterward. For a
few minutes no one spoke, Tom whistled and Maud hummed but Fan and Polly
were each soberly thinking of something, for they had reached an
age when children, girls especially, begin to observe, contrast, and
speculate upon the words, acts, manners, and looks of those about them.
A good deal of thinking goes on in the heads of these shrewd little
folks, and the elders should mind their ways, for they get criticised
pretty sharply and imitated very closely.
</p><p>Two little things had happened that day, and the influence of a few
words, a careless action, was still working in the active minds of the
girls.
</p><p>Mr. Sydney had called, and while Fanny was talking with him she saw his
eye rest on Polly, who sat apart watching the faces round her with the
modest, intelligent look which many found so attractive. At that minute
Madam Shaw came in, and stopped to speak to the little girl. Polly rose
at once, and remained standing till the old lady passed on.
</p><p>“Are you laughing at Polly's prim ways?” Fanny had asked, as she saw Mr.
Sydney smile.
</p><p>“No, I am admiring Miss Polly's fine manners,” he answered in a grave,
respectful tone, which had impressed Fanny very much, for Mr. Sydney
was considered by all the girls as a model of good breeding, and that
indescribable something which they called “elegance.”
</p><p>Fanny wished she had done that little thing, and won that approving
look, for she valued the young man's good opinion, because it was
so hard to win, by her set at least. So, when Polly talked about old
people, it recalled this scene and made Fan cross.
</p><p>Polly was remembering how, when Mrs. Shaw came home that day in her fine
visiting costume, and Maud ran to welcome her with unusual affection,
she gathered up her lustrous silk and pushed the little girl away
saying, impatiently, “Don't touch me, child, your hands are dirty.”
 Then the thought had come to Polly that the velvet cloak did n't cover
a right motherly heart, that the fretful face under the nodding purple
plumes was not a tender motherly face, and that the hands in the
delicate primrose gloves had put away something very sweet and precious.
She thought of another woman, whose dress never was too fine for little
wet cheeks to lie against, or loving little arms to press; whose face,
in spite of many lines and the gray hairs above it, was never sour or
unsympathetic when children's eyes turned towards it; and whose hands
never were too busy, too full or too nice to welcome and serve the
little sons and daughters who freely brought their small hopes and
fears, sins and sorrows, to her, who dealt out justice and mercy with
such wise love. “Ah, that's a mother!” thought Polly, as the memory
came warm into her heart, making her feel very rich, and pity Maud for
being so poor.
</p><p>This it was that caused such sudden indignation at Fanny's dreadful
speech, and this it was that made quick-tempered Polly try to calm her
wrath before she used toward Fanny's mother the disrespectful tone she
so resented toward her own. As the swing came down after some dozen
quick journeys to and fro, Polly seemed to have found a smile somewhere
up aloft, for she looked toward Fan, saying pleasantly, as she paused
a little in her airy exercise, “I'm not mad now, shall I come and toss
with you?”
</p><p>“No, I'll come and swing with you,” answered Fanny, quick to feel the
generous spirit of her friend.
</p><p>“You are an angel, and I'll never be so rude again,” she added, as
Polly's arm came round her, and half the seat was gladly offered.
</p><p>“No, I ain't; but if I ever get at all like one, it will be'mother's
preaching' that did it,” said Polly, with a happy laugh.
</p><p>“Good for you, Polly Peacemaker,” cried Tom, quoting his father, and
giving them a grand push as the most appropriate way of expressing his
approbation of the sentiment.
</p><p>Nothing more was said; but from that day there slowly crept into the
family more respect for grandma, more forbearance with her infirmities,
more interest in her little stories, and many a pleasant gossip did the
dear old lady enjoy with the children as they gathered round her fire,
solitary so long.
