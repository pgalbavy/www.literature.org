Who ever does a deed that's wrong<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will surely find some day<br/>
That for that naughty act of his<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll surely have to pay.

<p>That was the way with Chatterer. Of course he had had no business
to steal corn from Farmer Brown's corn-crib. To be sure he had
felt that he had just as much right to that corn as Farmer Brown
had. You see, the little people of the Green Meadows and the Green
Forest feel that everything that grows belongs to them, if they
want it and are smart enough to get it before some one else does.
But it is just there that Chatterer went wrong. Farmer Brown had
harvested that corn and stored it in his corn-crib, and so, of
course, no one else had any right to it. Right down deep in his
heart Chatterer knew this. If he hadn't known it, he wouldn't
have been so sly in taking what he wanted. He knew all the time
that he was stealing, but he tried to make himself believe that
it was all right. So he had kept on stealing and stealing until
at last he was caught in a trap, and now he had got to pay for
his wrong-doing.</p>

<p>Chatterer was very miserable, so miserable and frightened that
he could do nothing but sit huddled up in a little shivery ball.
He hadn't the least doubt in the world that this was his very
last day, and that Farmer Brown's boy would turn him over to cruel
Black Pussy for her breakfast. Farmer Brown's boy had left him
in the trap in the house and had gone out. For a long time Chatterer
could hear pounding out in the woodshed, and Farmer Brown's boy
was whistling as he pounded. Chatterer wondered how he could whistle
and seem so happy when he meant to do such a dreadful thing as
to give him to Black Pussy. After what seemed a very long time,
ages and ages, Farmer Brown's boy came back. He had with him a
queer looking box.</p>

<p>"There," said he, "is a new home for you, you little red imp!
I guess it will keep you out of trouble for a while."</p>

<p>He slid back a little door in the top of the box, and then, putting
on a stout glove and opening a little door in the trap, he put
in his big hand and closed it around Chatterer.</p>

<p>Poor little Chatterer! He was sure now that this was the end,
and that he was to be given to Black Pussy, who was looking on
with hungry, yellow eyes. He struggled and did his best to bite,
but the thick glove gave his sharp little teeth no chance to hurt
the hand that held him. Even in his terror, he noticed that that
big hand tried to be gentle and squeezed him no tighter than was
necessary. Then he was lifted out of the trap and dropped through
the little doorway in the top of the queer box, and the door was
fastened. Nothing terrible had happened, after all.</p>

<p>At first, Chatterer just sulked in one corner. He still felt
sure that something terrible was going to happen. Farmer Brown's
boy took the box out into the shed and put it where the sun shone
into it. For a little while he stayed watching, but Chatterer
still sulked and sulked. By and by he went away, taking Black
Pussy with him, and Chatterer was alone.</p>

<p>When he was quite sure that no one was about, Chatterer began
to wonder what sort of a place he was in, and if there wasn't
some way to get out. He found that one side and the top were of
fine, stout wire, through which he could look out, and that the
other sides and the bottom were of wood covered with wire, so
that there was no chance for his sharp teeth to gnaw a way out.
In one corner was a stout piece of an apple-tree, with two little
stubby branches to sit on, and half way up a little round hole.
Very cautiously Chatterer peeped inside the hole. Inside was a
splendid hollow. On the floor of the box was a little heap of
shavings and bits of rag. And there was a little pile of yellow
corn. How Chatterer did hate the sight of that corn! You see,
it was corn that had got him into all this trouble. At least,
that is the way Chatterer felt about it. When he had examined
everything, he knew that there was no way out. Chatterer was in
a prison, though that is not what Farmer Brown's boy called it.
He said it was a cage.</p>
