"Are you coming to the Fadden Dance, Ann Veronica?" asked
Constance Widgett.
<P>
Ann Veronica considered her answer.  "I mean to," she replied.
<P>
"You are making your dress?"
<P>
"Such as it is."
<P>
They were in the elder Widgett girl's bedroom; Hetty was laid up,
she said, with a sprained ankle, and a miscellaneous party was
gossiping away her tedium.  It was a large, littered,
self-forgetful apartment, decorated with unframed charcoal
sketches by various incipient masters; and an open bookcase,
surmounted by plaster casts and the half of a human skull,
displayed an odd miscellany of books--Shaw and Swinburne, Tom
Jones, Fabian Essays, Pope and Dumas, cheek by jowl. Constance
Widgett's abundant copper-red hair was bent down over some dimly
remunerative work--stencilling in colors upon rough, white
material--at a kitchen table she had dragged up-stairs for the
purpose, while on her bed there was seated a slender lady of
thirty or so in a dingy green dress, whom Constance had
introduced with a wave of her hand as Miss Miniver.  Miss Miniver
looked out on the world through large emotional blue eyes that
were further magnified by the glasses she wore, and her nose was
pinched and pink, and her mouth was whimsically petulant.  Her
glasses moved quickly as her glance travelled from face to face. 
She seemed bursting with the desire to talk, and watching for her
opportunity.  On her lapel was an ivory button, bearing the words
"Votes for Women."  Ann Veronica sat at the foot of the
sufferer's bed, while Teddy Widgett, being something of an
athlete, occupied the only bed-room chair--a decadent piece,
essentially a tripod and largely a formality--and smoked
cigarettes, and tried to conceal the fact that he was looking all
the time at Ann Veronica's eyebrows.  Teddy was the hatless young
man who had turned Ann Veronica aside from the Avenue two days
before.  He was the junior of both his sisters, co-educated and
much broken in to feminine society.  A bowl of roses, just
brought by Ann Veronica, adorned the communal dressing-table, and
Ann Veronica was particularly trim in preparation for a call she
was to make with her aunt later in the afternoon.
<P>
Ann Veronica decided to be more explicit.  "I've been," she said,
"forbidden to come."
<P>
"Hul-LO!" said Hetty, turning her head on the pillow; and Teddy
remarked with profound emotion, "My God!"
<P>
"Yes," said Ann Veronica, "and that complicates the situation."
<P>
"Auntie?" asked Constance, who was conversant with Ann Veronica's
affairs.
<P>
"No!  My father.  It's--it's a serious prohibition."
<P>
"Why?" asked Hetty.
<P>
"That's the point.  I asked him why, and he hadn't a reason."
<P>
"YOU ASKED YOUR FATHER FOR A REASON!" said Miss Miniver, with
great intensity.
<P>
"Yes.  I tried to have it out with him, but he wouldn't have it
out.  "Ann Veronica reflected for an instant "That's why I think
I ought to come."
<P>
"You asked your father for a reason!" Miss Miniver repeated.
<P>
"We always have things out with OUR father, poor dear!" said
Hetty.  "He's got almost to like it."
<P>
"Men," said Miss Miniver, "NEVER have a reason. Never!  And they
don't know it!  They have no idea of it.  It's one of their worst
traits, one of their very worst."
<P>
"But I say, Vee," said Constance, "if you come and you are
forbidden to come there'll be the deuce of a row."
<P>
Ann Veronica was deciding for further confidences. Her situation
was perplexing her very much, and the Widgett atmosphere was lax
and sympathetic, and provocative of discussion.  "It isn't only
the dance," she said.
<P>
"There's the classes," said Constance, the well-informed.
<P>
"There's the whole situation.  Apparently I'm not to exist yet. 
I'm not to study, I'm not to grow.  I've got to stay at home and
remain in a state of suspended animation."
<P>
"DUSTING!" said Miss Miniver, in a sepulchral voice.
<P>
"Until you marry, Vee," said Hetty.
<P>
"Well, I don't feel like standing it."
<P>
"Thousands of women have married merely for freedom," said Miss
Miniver.  "Thousands!  Ugh!  And found it a worse slavery."
<P>
"I suppose," said Constance, stencilling away at bright pink
petals, "it's our lot.  But it's very beastly."
<P>
"What's our lot?" asked her sister.
<P>
"Slavery!  Downtroddenness!  When I think of it I feel all over
boot marks--men's boots.  We hide it bravely, but so it is. 
Damn!  I've splashed."
<P>
Miss Miniver's manner became impressive.  She addressed Ann
Veronica with an air of conveying great open secrets to her.  "As
things are at present," she said, "it is true.  We live under
man-made institutions, and that is what they amount to.  Every
girl in the world practically, except a few of us who teach or
type-write, and then we're underpaid and sweated--it's dreadful
to think how we are sweated!"  She had lost her generalization,
whatever it was.  She hung for a moment, and then went on,
conclusively, "Until we have the vote that is how things WILL
be."
<P>
"I'm all for the vote," said Teddy.
<P>
"I suppose a girl MUST be underpaid and sweated," said Ann
Veronica.  "I suppose there's no way of getting a decent
income--independently."
<P>
"Women have practically NO economic freedom," said Miss Miniver,
"because they have no political freedom. Men have seen to that. 
The one profession, the one decent profession, I mean, for a
woman--except the stage--is teaching, and there we trample on one
another. Everywhere else--the law, medicine, the Stock
Exchange--prejudice bars us."
<P>
"There's art," said Ann Veronica, "and writing."
<P>
"Every one hasn't the Gift.  Even there a woman never gets a fair
chance.  Men are against her.  Whatever she does is minimized. 
All the best novels have been written by women, and yet see how
men sneer at the lady novelist still!  There's only one way to
get on for a woman, and that is to please men.  That is what they
think we are for!"
<P>
"We're beasts," said Teddy.  "Beasts!"
<P>
But Miss Miniver took no notice of his admission.
<P>
"Of course," said Miss Miniver--she went on in a regularly
undulating voice--"we DO please men.  We have that gift.  We can
see round them and behind them and through them, and most of us
use that knowledge, in the silent way we have, for our great
ends. Not all of us, but some of us.  Too many.  I wonder what
men would say if we threw the mask aside--if we really told them
what WE thought of them, really showed them what WE were."  A
flush of excitement crept into her cheeks.
<P>
"Maternity," she said, "has been our undoing."
<P>
From that she opened out into a long, confused emphatic discourse
on the position of women, full of wonderful statements, while
Constance worked at her stencilling and Ann Veronica and Hetty
listened, and Teddy contributed sympathetic noises and consumed
cheap cigarettes.  As she talked she made weak little gestures
with her hands, and she thrust her face forward from her bent
shoulders; and she peered sometimes at Ann Veronica and sometimes
at a photograph of the Axenstrasse, near Fluelen, that hung upon
the wall.  Ann Veronica watched her face, vaguely sympathizing
with her, vaguely disliking her physical insufficiency and her
convulsive movements, and the fine eyebrows were knit with a
faint perplexity.  Essentially the talk was a mixture of
fragments of sentences heard, of passages read, or arguments
indicated rather than stated, and all of it was served in a sauce
of strange enthusiasm, thin yet intense.  Ann Veronica had had
some training at the Tredgold College in disentangling threads
from confused statements, and she had a curious persuasion that
in all this fluent muddle there was something--something real,
something that signified.  But it was very hard to follow. She
did not understand the note of hostility to men that ran through
it all, the bitter vindictiveness that lit Miss Miniver's cheeks
and eyes, the sense of some at last insupportable wrong slowly
accumulated.  She had no inkling of that insupportable wrong.
<P>
"We are the species," said Miss Miniver, "men are only incidents.
<P>
They give themselves airs, but so it is. In all the species of
animals the females are more important than the males; the males
have to please them. Look at the cock's feathers, look at the
competition there is everywhere, except among humans.  The stags
and oxen and things all have to fight for us, everywhere. Only in
man is the male made the most important.  And that happens
through our maternity; it's our very importance that degrades us.
<P>
While we were minding the children they stole our rights and
liberties.  The children made us slaves, and the men took
advantage of it.  It's --Mrs. Shalford says--the accidental
conquering the essential.  Originally in the first animals there
were no males, none at all.  It has been proved.  Then they
appear among the lower things"--she made meticulous gestures to
figure the scale of life; she seemed to be holding up specimens,
and peering through her glasses at them--"among crustaceans and
things, just as little creatures, ever so inferior to the
females.  Mere hangers on.  Things you would laugh at.  And among
human beings, too, women to begin with were the rulers and
leaders; they owned all the property, they invented all the arts.
<P>
The primitive government was the Matriarchate. The Matriarchate! 
The Lords of Creation just ran about and did what they were
told."
<P>
"But is that really so?" said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"It has been proved," said Miss Miniver, and added, "by American
professors."
<P>
"But how did they prove it?"
<P>
"By science," said Miss Miniver, and hurried on, putting out a
rhetorical hand that showed a slash of finger through its glove. 
"And now, look at us!  See what we have become.  Toys!  Delicate
trifles!  A sex of invalids.  It is we who have become the
parasites and toys."
<P>
It was, Ann Veronica felt, at once absurd and extraordinarily
right.  Hetty, who had periods of lucid expression, put the thing
for her from her pillow.  She charged boldly into the space of
Miss Miniver's rhetorical pause.
<P>
"It isn't quite that we're toys.  Nobody toys with me.  Nobody
regards Constance or Vee as a delicate trifle."
<P>
Teddy made some confused noise, a thoracic street row; some
remark was assassinated by a rival in his throat and buried
hastily under a cough.
<P>
"They'd better not," said Hetty.  "The point is we're not toys,
toys isn't the word; we're litter.  We're handfuls.  We're
regarded as inflammable litter that mustn't be left about.  We
are the species, and maternity is our game; that's all right, but
nobody wants that admitted for fear we should all catch fire, and
set about fulfilling the purpose of our beings without waiting
for further explanations.  As if we didn't know!  The practical
trouble is our ages.  They used to marry us off at seventeen,
rush us into things before we had time to protest.  They don't
now.  Heaven knows why!  They don't marry most of us off now
until high up in the twenties.  And the age gets higher.  We have
to hang about in the interval.  There's a great gulf opened, and
nobody's got any plans what to do with us.  So the world is
choked with waste and waiting daughters. Hanging about!  And they
start thinking and asking questions, and begin to be neither one
thing nor the other.  We're partly human beings and partly
females in suspense."
<P>
Miss Miniver followed with an expression of perplexity, her mouth
shaped to futile expositions.  The Widgett method of thought
puzzled her weakly rhetorical mind. "There is no remedy, girls,"
she began, breathlessly, "except the Vote.  Give us that--"
<P>
Ann Veronica came in with a certain disregard of Miss Miniver. 
"That's it," she said.  "They have no plans for us.  They have no
ideas what to do with us."
<P>
"Except," said Constance, surveying her work with her head on one
side, "to keep the matches from the litter."
<P>
"And they won't let us make plans for ourselves."
<P>
"We will," said Miss Miniver, refusing to be suppressed, "if some
of us have to be killed to get it."  And she pressed her lips
together in white resolution and nodded, and she was manifestly
full of that same passion for conflict and self-sacrifice that
has given the world martyrs since the beginning of things.  "I
wish I could make every woman, every girl, see this as clearly as
I see it--just what the Vote means to us.  Just what it means. .
. ."
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 2
<P>
<P>
As Ann Veronica went back along the Avenue to her aunt she became
aware of a light-footed pursuer running. Teddy overtook her, a
little out of breath, his innocent face flushed, his
straw-colored hair disordered. He was out of breath, and spoke in
broken sentences.
<P>
"I say, Vee.  Half a minute, Vee.  It's like this: You want
freedom.  Look here.  You know--if you want freedom.  Just an
idea of mine.  You know how those Russian students do?  In
Russia.  Just a formal marriage.  Mere formality.  Liberates the
girl from parental control.  See?  You marry me.  Simply.  No
further responsibility whatever.  Without hindrance--present
occupation.  Why not?  Quite willing.  Get a license--just an
idea of mine.  Doesn't matter a bit to me.  Do anything to please
you, Vee.  Anything. Not fit to be dust on your boots. 
Still--there you are!"
<P>
He paused.
<P>
Ann Veronica's desire to laugh unrestrainedly was checked by the
tremendous earnestness of his expression. "Awfully good of you,
Teddy." she said.
<P>
He nodded silently, too full for words.
<P>
"But I don't see," said Ann Veronica, "just how it fits the
present situation."
<P>
"No!  Well, I just suggested it.  Threw it out.  Of course, if at
any time--see reason--alter your opinion. Always at your service.
<P>
No offence, I hope.  All right! I'm off.  Due to play hockey. 
Jackson's.  Horrid snorters! So long, Vee!  Just suggested it. 
See?  Nothing really.  Passing thought."
<P>
"Teddy," said Ann Veronica, "you're a dear!"
<P>
"Oh, quite!" said Teddy, convulsively, and lifted an imaginary
hat and left her.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 3
<P>
<P>
The call Ann Veronica paid with her aunt that afternoon had at
first much the same relation to the Widgett conversation that a
plaster statue of Mr. Gladstone would have to a carelessly
displayed interior on a dissecting-room table.  The Widgetts
talked with a remarkable absence of external coverings; the
Palsworthys found all the meanings of life on its surfaces.  They
seemed the most wrapped things in all Ann Veronica's wrappered
world.  The Widgett mental furniture was perhaps worn and shabby,
but there it was before you, undisguised, fading visibly in an
almost pitiless sunlight.  Lady Palsworthy was the widow of a
knight who had won his spurs in the wholesale coal trade, she was
of good seventeenth-century attorney blood, a county family, and
distantly related to Aunt Mollie's deceased curate.  She was the
social leader of Morningside Park, and in her superficial and
euphuistic way an extremely kind and pleasant woman.  With her
lived a Mrs. Pramlay, a sister of the Morningside Park doctor,
and a very active and useful member of the Committee of the
Impoverished Gentlewomen's Aid Society.  Both ladies were on easy
and friendly terms with all that was best in Morningside Park
society; they had an afternoon once a month that was quite well
attended, they sometimes gave musical evenings, they dined out
and gave a finish to people's dinners, they had a full-sized
croquet lawn and tennis beyond, and understood the art of
bringing people together.  And they never talked of anything at
all, never discussed, never even encouraged gossip.  They were
just nice.
<P>
Ann Veronica found herself walking back down the Avenue that had
just been the scene of her first proposal beside her aunt, and
speculating for the first time in her life about that lady's
mental attitudes.  Her prevailing effect was one of quiet and
complete assurance, as though she knew all about everything, and
was only restrained by her instinctive delicacy from telling what
she knew.  But the restraint exercised by her instinctive
delicacy was very great; over and above coarse or sexual matters
it covered religion and politics and any mention of money matters
or crime, and Ann Veronica found herself wondering whether these
exclusions represented, after all, anything more than
suppressions.  Was there anything at all in those locked rooms of
her aunt's mind?  Were they fully furnished and only a little
dusty and cobwebby and in need of an airing, or were they stark
vacancy except, perhaps, for a cockroach or so or the gnawing of
a rat?  What was the mental equivalent of a rat's gnawing?  The
image was going astray.  But what would her aunt think of Teddy's
recent off-hand suggestion of marriage?  What would she think of
the Widgett conversation?  Suppose she was to tell her aunt
quietly but firmly about the parasitic males of degraded
crustacea.  The girl suppressed a chuckle that would have been
inexplicable.
<P>
There came a wild rush of anthropological lore into her brain, a
flare of indecorous humor.  It was one of the secret troubles of
her mind, this grotesque twist her ideas would sometimes take, as
though they rebelled and rioted.  After all, she found herself
reflecting, behind her aunt's complacent visage there was a past
as lurid as any one's--not, of course, her aunt's own personal
past, which was apparently just that curate and almost incredibly
jejune, but an ancestral past with all sorts of scandalous things
in it: fire and slaughterings, exogamy, marriage by capture,
corroborees, cannibalism! Ancestresses with perhaps dim
anticipatory likenesses to her aunt, their hair less neatly done,
no doubt, their manners and gestures as yet undisciplined, but
still ancestresses in the direct line, must have danced through a
brief and stirring life in the woady buff.  Was there no echo
anywhere in Miss Stanley's pacified brain? Those empty rooms, if
they were empty, were the equivalents of astoundingly decorated
predecessors.  Perhaps it was just as well there was no inherited
memory.
<P>
Ann Veronica was by this time quite shocked at her own thoughts,
and yet they would go on with their freaks.  Great vistas of
history opened, and she and her aunt were near reverting to the
primitive and passionate and entirely indecorous arboreal--were
swinging from branches by the arms, and really going on quite
dread-fully--when their arrival at the Palsworthys' happily
checked this play of fancy, and brought Ann Veronica back to the
exigencies of the wrappered life again.
<P>
Lady Palsworthy liked Ann Veronica because she was never awkward,
had steady eyes, and an almost invariable neatness and dignity in
her clothes.  She seemed just as stiff and shy as a girl ought to
be, Lady Palsworthy thought, neither garrulous nor unready, and
free from nearly all the heavy aggressiveness, the overgrown,
overblown quality, the egotism and want of consideration of the
typical modern girl.  But then Lady Palsworthy had never seen Ann
Veronica running like the wind at hockey.  She had never seen her
sitting on tables nor heard her discussing theology, and had
failed to observe that the graceful figure was a natural one and
not due to ably chosen stays.  She took it for granted Ann
Veronica wore stays--mild stays, perhaps, but stays, and thought
no more of the matter.  She had seen her really only at teas,
with the Stanley strain in her uppermost.  There are so many
girls nowadays who are quite unpresentable at tea, with their
untrimmed laughs, their awful dispositions of their legs when
they sit down, their slangy disrespect; they no longer smoke, it
is true, like the girls of the eighties and nineties,
nevertheless to a fine intelligence they have the flavor of
tobacco.  They have no amenities, they scratch the mellow surface
of things almost as if they did it on purpose; and Lady
Palsworthy and Mrs. Pramlay lived for amenities and the mellowed
surfaces of things.  Ann Veronica was one of the few young
people--and one must have young people just as one must have
flowers--one could ask to a little gathering without the risk of
a painful discord.  Then the distant relationship to Miss Stanley
gave them a slight but pleasant sense of proprietorship in the
girl. They had their little dreams about her.
<P>
Mrs. Pramlay received them in the pretty chintz drawing-room,
which opened by French windows on the trim garden, with its
croquet lawn, its tennis-net in the middle distance, and its
remote rose alley lined with smart dahlias and flaming
sunflowers.  Her eye met Miss Stanley's understandingly, and she
was if anything a trifle more affectionate in her greeting to Ann
Veronica.  Then Ann Veronica passed on toward the tea in the
garden, which was dotted with the elite of Morningside Park
society, and there she was pounced upon by Lady Palsworthy and
given tea and led about.  Across the lawn and hovering
indecisively, Ann Veronica saw and immediately affected not to
see Mr. Manning, Lady Palsworthy's nephew, a tall young man of
seven-and-thirty with a handsome, thoughtful, impassive face, a
full black mustache, and a certain heavy luxuriousness of
gesture.  The party resolved itself for Ann Veronica into a game
in which she manoeuvred unostentatiously and finally
unsuccessfully to avoid talking alone with this gentleman.
<P>
Mr. Manning had shown on previous occasions that he found Ann
Veronica interesting and that he wished to interest her.  He was
a civil servant of some standing, and after a previous
conversation upon aesthetics of a sententious, nebulous, and
sympathetic character, he had sent her a small volume, which he
described as the fruits of his leisure and which was as a matter
of fact rather carefully finished verse.  It dealt with fine
aspects of Mr. Manning's feelings, and as Ann Veronica's mind was
still largely engaged with fundamentals and found no pleasure in
metrical forms, she had not as yet cut its pages.  So that as she
saw him she remarked to herself very faintly but definitely, "Oh,
golly!" and set up a campaign of avoidance that Mr. Manning at
last broke down by coming directly at her as she talked with the
vicar's aunt about some of the details of the alleged smell of
the new church lamps.  He did not so much cut into this
conversation as loom over it, for he was a tall, if rather
studiously stooping, man.
<P>
The face that looked down upon Ann Veronica was full of amiable
intention.  "Splendid you are looking to-day, Miss Stanley," he
said.  "How well and jolly you must be feeling."
<P>
He beamed over the effect of this and shook hands with effusion,
and Lady Palsworthy suddenly appeared as his confederate and
disentangled the vicar's aunt.
<P>
"I love this warm end of summer more than words can tell," he
said.  "I've tried to make words tell it. It's no good.  Mild,
you know, and boon.  You want music."
<P>
Ann Veronica agreed, and tried to make the manner of her assent
cover a possible knowledge of a probable poem.
<P>
"Splendid it must be to be a composer.  Glorious! The Pastoral. 
Beethoven; he's the best of them. Don't you think?  Tum, tay,
tum, tay."
<P>
Ann Veronica did.
<P>
"What have you been doing since our last talk? Still cutting up
rabbits and probing into things?  I've often thought of that talk
of ours--often."
<P>
He did not appear to require any answer to his question.
<P>
"Often," he repeated, a little heavily.
<P>
"Beautiful these autumn flowers are," said Ann Veronica, in a
wide, uncomfortable pause.
<P>
"Do come and see the Michaelmas daisies at the end of the
garden," said Mr. Manning, "they're a dream." And Ann Veronica
found herself being carried off to an isolation even remoter and
more conspicuous than the corner of the lawn, with the whole of
the party aiding and abetting and glancing at them.  "Damn!" said
Ann Veronica to herself, rousing herself for a conflict.
<P>
Mr. Manning told her he loved beauty, and extorted a similar
admission from her; he then expatiated upon his own love of
beauty.  He said that for him beauty justified life, that he
could not imagine a good action that was not a beautiful one nor
any beautiful thing that could be altogether bad.  Ann Veronica
hazarded an opinion that as a matter of history some very
beautiful people had, to a quite considerable extent, been bad,
but Mr. Manning questioned whether when they were bad they were
really beautiful or when they were beautiful bad.  Ann Veronica
found her attention wandering a little as he told her that he was
not ashamed to feel almost slavish in the presence of really
beautiful people, and then they came to the Michaelmas daisies.
They were really very fine and abundant, with a blaze of
perennial sunflowers behind them.
<P>
"They make me want to shout," said Mr. Manning, with a sweep of
the arm.
<P>
"They're very good this year," said Ann Veronica, avoiding
controversial matter.
<P>
"Either I want to shout," said Mr. Manning, "when I see beautiful
things, or else I want to weep."  He paused and looked at her,
and said, with a sudden drop into a confidential undertone, "Or
else I want to pray."
<P>
"When is Michaelmas Day?" said Ann Veronica, a little abruptly.
<P>
"Heaven knows!" said Mr. Manning; and added, "the twenty-ninth."
<P>
"I thought it was earlier," said Ann Veronica.  "Wasn't
Parliament to reassemble?"
<P>
He put out his hand and leaned against a tree and crossed his
legs.  "You're not interested in politics?" he asked, almost with
a note of protest.
<P>
"Well, rather," said Ann Veronica.  "It seems-- It's
interesting."
<P>
"Do you think so?  I find my interest in that sort of thing
decline and decline."
<P>
"I'm curious.  Perhaps because I don't know.  I suppose an
intelligent person OUGHT to be interested in political affairs. 
They concern us all."
<P>
"I wonder," said Mr. Manning, with a baffling smile.
<P>
"I think they do.  After all, they're history in the making."
<P>
"A sort of history," said Mr. Manning; and repeated, "a sort of
history.  But look at these glorious daisies!"
<P>
"But don't you think political questions ARE important?"
<P>
"I don't think they are this afternoon, and I don't think they
are to you."
<P>
Ann Veronica turned her back on the Michaelmas daisies, and faced
toward the house with an air of a duty completed.
<P>
"Just come to that seat now you are here, Miss Stanley, and look
down the other path; there's a vista of just the common sort. 
Better even than these."
<P>
Ann Veronica walked as he indicated.
<P>
"You know I'm old-fashioned, Miss Stanley.  I don't think women
need to trouble about political questions."
<P>
"I want a vote," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"Really!" said Mr. Manning, in an earnest voice, and waved his
hand to the alley of mauve and purple. "I wish you didn't."
<P>
"Why not?"  She turned on him.
<P>
"It jars.  It jars with all my ideas.  Women to me are something
so serene, so fine, so feminine, and politics are so dusty, so
sordid, so wearisome and quarrelsome. It seems to me a woman's
duty to be beautiful, to BE beautiful and to behave beautifully,
and politics are by their very nature ugly.  You see, I--I am a
woman worshipper.  I worshipped women long before I found any
woman I might ever hope to worship.  Long ago. And--the idea of
committees, of hustings, of agenda-papers!"
<P>
"I don't see why the responsibility of beauty should all be
shifted on to the women," said Ann Veronica, suddenly remembering
a part of Miss Miniver's discourse.
<P>
"It rests with them by the nature of things.  Why should you who
are queens come down from your thrones? If you can afford it, WE
can't.  We can't afford to turn our women, our Madonnas, our
Saint Catherines, our Mona Lisas, our goddesses and angels and
fairy princesses, into a sort of man.  Womanhood is sacred to me.
<P>
My politics in that matter wouldn't be to give women votes. I'm a
Socialist, Miss Stanley."
<P>
"WHAT?" said Ann Veronica, startled.
<P>
"A Socialist of the order of John Ruskin.  Indeed I am!  I would
make this country a collective monarchy, and all the girls and
women in it should be the Queen. They should never come into
contact with politics or economics--or any of those things.  And
we men would work for them and serve them in loyal fealty."
<P>
"That's rather the theory now," said Ann Veronica. "Only so many
men neglect their duties."
<P>
"Yes," said Mr. Manning, with an air of emerging from an
elaborate demonstration, "and so each of us must, under existing
conditions, being chivalrous indeed to all women, choose for
himself his own particular and worshipful queen."
<P>
"So far as one can judge from the system in practice," said Ann
Veronica, speaking in a loud, common-sense, detached tone, and
beginning to walk slowly but resolutely toward the lawn, "it
doesn't work."
<P>
"Every one must be experimental," said Mr. Manning, and glanced
round hastily for further horticultural points of interest in
secluded corners.  None presented themselves to save him from
that return.
<P>
"That's all very well when one isn't the material experimented
upon," Ann Veronica had remarked.
<P>
"Women would--they DO have far more power than they think, as
influences, as inspirations."
<P>
Ann Veronica said nothing in answer to that.
<P>
"You say you want a vote," said Mr. Manning, abruptly.
<P>
"I think I ought to have one."
<P>
"Well, I have two," said Mr. Manning--"one in Oxford University
and one in Kensington."  He caught up and went on with a sort of
clumsiness:  "Let me present you with them and be your voter."
<P>
There followed an instant's pause, and then Ann Veronica had
decided to misunderstand.
<P>
"I want a vote for myself," she said.  "I don't see why I should
take it second-hand.  Though it's very kind of you.  And rather
unscrupulous.  Have you ever voted, Mr. Manning?  I suppose
there's a sort of place like a ticket-office.  And a
ballot-box--"  Her face assumed an expression of intellectual
conflict. "What is a ballot-box like, exactly?" she asked, as
though it was very important to her.
<P>
Mr. Manning regarded her thoughtfully for a moment and stroked
his mustache.  "A ballot-box, you know," he said, "is very
largely just a box."  He made quite a long pause, and went on,
with a sigh:  "You have a voting paper given you--"
<P>
They emerged into the publicity of the lawn.
<P>
"Yes," said Ann Veronica, "yes," to his explanation, and saw
across the lawn Lady Palsworthy talking to her aunt, and both of
them staring frankly across at her and Mr. Manning as they
talked.
