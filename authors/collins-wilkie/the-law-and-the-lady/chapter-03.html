<P>
 EUSTACE succeeded in quieting my alarm. But I can hardly say
that he succeeded in satisfying my mind as well.
<P>
He had been thinking, he told me, of the contrast between his
past and his present life. Bitter remembrance of the years that
had gone had risen in his memory, and had filled him with
melancholy misgivings of his capacity to make my life with him a
happy one. He had asked himself if he had not met me too late--if
he were not already a man soured and broken by the
disappointments and disenchantments of the past? Doubts such as
these, weighing more and more heavily on his mind, had filled his
eyes with the tears which I had discovered--tears which he now
entreated me, by my love for him, to dismiss from my memory
forever.
<P>
I forgave him, comforted him, revived him; but there were moments
when the remembrance of what I had seen troubled me in secret,
and when I asked myself if I really possessed my husband's full
confidence as he possessed mine.
<P>
We left the train at Ramsgate.
<P>
The favorite watering-place was empty; the season was just over.
Our arrangements for the wedding tour included a cruise to the
Mediterranean in a yacht lent to Eustace by a friend. We were
both fond of the sea, and we were equally desirous, considering
the circumstances under which we had married, of escaping the
notice of friends and acquaintances. With this object in view,
having celebrated our marriage privately in London, we had
decided on instructing the sailing-master of the yacht to join us
at Ramsgate. At this port (when the season for visitors was at an
end) we could embark far more privately than at the popular
yachting stations situated in the Isle of Wight.
<P>
Three days passed--days of delicious solitude, of exquisite
happiness, never to be forgotten, never to be lived over again,
to the end of our lives!
<P>
Early on the morning of the fourth day, just before sunrise, a
trifling incident happened, which was noticeable, nevertheless,
as being strange to me in my experience of myself.
<P>
I awoke, suddenly and unaccountably, from a deep and dreamless
sleep with an all-pervading sensation of nervous uneasiness which
I had never felt before. In the old days at the Vicarage my
capacity as a sound sleeper had been the subject of many a little
harmless joke. From the moment when my head was on the pillow I
had never known what it was to awake until the maid knocked at my
door. At all seasons and times the long and uninterrupted repose
of a child was the repose that I enjoyed.
<P>
And now I had awakened, without any assignable cause, hours
before my usual time. I tried to compose myself to sleep again.
The effort was useless. Such a restlessness possessed me that I
was not even able to lie still in the bed. My husband was
sleeping soundly by my side. In the fear of disturbing him I
rose, and put on my dressing-gown and slippers.
<P>
I went to the window. The sun was just rising over the calm gray
sea. For a while the majestic spectacle before me exercised a
tranquilizing influence on the irritable condition of my nerves.
But ere long the old restlessness returned upon me. I walked
slowly to and fro in the room, until I was weary of the monotony
of the exercise. I took up a book, and laid it aside again. My
attention wandered; the author was powerless to recall it. I got
on my feet once more, and looked at Eustace, and admired him and
loved him in his tranquil sleep. I went back to the window, and
wearied of the beautiful morning. I sat down before the glass and
looked at myself. How haggard and worn I was already, through
awaking before my usual time! I rose again, not knowing what to
do next. The confinement to the four walls of the room began to
be intolerable to me. I opened the door that led into my
husband's dressing-room, and entered it, to try if the change
would relieve me.
<P>
The first object that I noticed was his dressing-case, open on
the toilet-table.
<P>
I took out the bottles and pots and brushes and combs, the knives
and scissors in one compartment, the writing materials in
another. I smelled the perfumes and pomatums; I busily cleaned
and dusted the bottles with my handkerchief as I took them out.
Little by little I completely emptied the dressing-case. It was
lined with blue velvet. In one corner I noticed a tiny slip of
loose blue silk. Taking it between my finger and thumb, and
drawing it upward, I discovered that there was a false bottom to
the case, forming a secret compartment for letters and papers. In
my strange condition--capricious, idle, inquisitive--it was an
amusement to me to take out the papers, just as I had taken out
everything else .
<P>
I found some receipted bills, which failed to interest me; some
letters, which it is needless to say I laid aside after only
looking at the addresses; and, under all, a photograph, face
downward, with writing on the back of it. I looked at the
writing, and saw these words:
<P>
"To my dear son, Eustace."
<P>
His mother! the woman who had so obstinately and mercilessly
opposed herself to our marriage!
<P>
I eagerly turned the photograph, expecting to see a woman with a
stern, ill-tempered, forbidding countenance. To my surprise, the
face showed the remains of great beauty; the expression, though
remarkably firm, was yet winning, tender, and kind. The gray hair
was arranged in rows of little quaint old-fashioned curls on
either side of the head, under a plain lace cap. At one corner of
the mouth there was a mark, apparently a mole, which added to the
characteristic peculiarity of the face. I looked and looked,
fixing the portrait thoroughly in my mind. This woman, who had
almost insulted me and my relatives, was, beyond all doubt or
dispute, so far as appearances went, a person possessing unusual
attractions--a person whom it would be a pleasure and a privilege
to know.
<P>
I fell into deep thought. The discovery of the photograph quieted
me as nothing had quieted me yet.
<P>
The striking of a clock downstairs in the hall warned me of the
flight of time. I carefully put back all the objects in the
dressing-case (beginning with the photograph) exactly as I had
found them, and returned to the bedroom. As I looked at my
husband, still sleeping peacefully, the question forced itself
into my mind, What had made that genial, gentle mother of his so
sternly bent on parting us? so harshly and pitilessly resolute in
asserting her disapproval of our marriage?
<P>
Could I put my question openly to Eustace when he awoke? No; I
was afraid to venture that length. It had been tacitly understood
between us that we were not to speak of his mother--and, besides,
he might be angry if he knew that I had opened the private
compartment of his dressing-case.
<P>
 After breakfast that morning we had news at last of the yacht.
The vessel was safely moored in the inner harbor, and the
sailing-master was waiting to receive my husband's orders on
board.
<P>
Eustace hesitated at asking me to accompany him to the yacht. It
would be necessary for him to examine the inventory of the
vessel, and to decide questions, not very interesting to a woman,
relating to charts and barometers, provisions and water. He asked
me if I would wait for his return. The day was enticingly
beautiful, and the tide was on the ebb. I pleaded for a walk on
the sands; and the landlady at our lodgings, who happened to be
in the room at the time, volunteered to accompany me and take
care of me. It was agreed that we should walk as far as we felt
inclined in the direction of Broadstairs, and that Eustace should
follow and meet us on the sands, after having completed his
arrangements on board the yacht.
<P>
In half an hour more the landlady and I were out on the beach.
<P>
The scene on that fine autumn morning was nothing less than
enchanting. The brisk breeze, the brilliant sky, the flashing
blue sea, the sun-bright cliffs and the tawny sands at their
feet, the gliding procession of ships on the great marine highway
of the English Channel--it was all so exhilarating, it was all so
delightful, that I really believe if I had been by myself I could
have danced for joy like a child. The one drawback to my
happiness was the landlady's untiring tongue. She was a forward,
good-natured, empty-headed woman, who persisted in talking,
whether I listened or not, and who had a habit of perpetually
addressing me as "Mrs. Woodville," which I thought a little
overfamiliar as an assertion of equality from a person in her
position to a person in mine.
<P>
We had been out, I should think, more than half an hour, when we
overtook a lady walking before us on the beach.
<P>
Just as we were about to pass the stranger she took her
handkerchief from her pocket, and accidentally drew out with it a
letter, which fell unnoticed by her, on the sand. I was nearest
to the letter, and I picked it up and offered it to the lady.
<P>
The instant she turned to thank me, I stood rooted to the spot.
There was the original of the photographic portrait in the
dressing-case! there was my husband's mother, standing face to
face with me! I recognized the quaint little gray curls, the
gentle, genial expression, the mole at the corner of the mouth.
No mistake was possible. His mother herself!
<P>
The old lady, naturally enough, mistook my confusion for shyness.
With perfect tact and kindness she entered into conversation with
me. In another minute I was walking side by side with the woman
who had sternly repudiated me as a member of her family; feeling,
I own, terribly discomposed, and not knowing in the least whether
I ought or ought not to assume the responsibility, in my
husband's absence, of telling her who I was.
<P>
In another minute my familiar landlady, walking on the other side
of my mother-in-law, decided the question for me. I happened to
say that I supposed we must by that time be near the end of our
walk--the little watering-place called Broadstairs. "Oh no, Mrs.
Woodville! cried the irrepressible woman, calling me by my name,
as usual; "nothing like so near as you think!"
<P>
I looked with a beating heart at the old lady.
<P>
To my unutterable amazement, not the faintest gleam of
recognition appeared in her face. Old Mrs. Woodville went on
talking to young Mrs. Woodville just as composedly as if she had
never heard her own name before in her life!
<P>
My face and manner must have betrayed something of the agitation
that I was suffering. Happening to look at me at the end of her
next sentence, the old lady started, and said, in her kindly way,
<P>
"I am afraid you have overexerted yourself. You are very
pale--you are looking quite exhausted. Come and sit down here;
let me lend you my smelling-bottle."
<P>
I followed her, quite helplessly, to the base of the cliff. Some
fallen fragments of chalk offered us a seat. I vaguely heard the
voluble landlady's expressions of sympathy and regret; I
mechanically took the smelling-bottle which my husband's mother
offered to me, after hearing my name, as an act of kindness to a
stranger
<P>
If I had only had myself to think of, I believe I should have
provoked an explanation on the spot. But I had Eustace to think
of. I was entirely ignorant of the relations, hostile or
friendly, which existed between his mother and himself. What
could I do?
<P>
In the meantime the old lady was still speaking to me with the
most considerate sympathy. She too was fatigued. she said. She
had passed a weary night at the bedside of a near relative
staying at Ramsgate. Only the day before she had received a
telegram announcing that one of her sisters was seriously ill.
She was herself thank God, still active and strong, and she had
thought it her duty to start at once for Ramsgate. Toward the
morning the state of the patient had improved. "The doctor
assures me ma'am, that there is no immediate danger; and I
thought it might revive me, after my long night at the bedside,
if I took a little walk on the beach."
<P>
I heard the words--I understood what they meant--but I was still
too bewildered and too intimidated by my extraordinary position
to be able to continue the conversation. The landlady had a
sensible suggestion to make--the landlady was the next person who
spoke.
<P>
"Here is a gentleman coming," she said to me, pointing in the
direction of Ramsgate. You can never walk back. Shall we ask him
to send a chaise from Broadstairs to the gap in the cliff?"
<P>
The gentleman advanced a little nearer.
<P>
The landlady and I recognized him at the same moment. It was
Eustace coming to meet us, as we had arranged. The irrepressible
landlady gave the freest expression to her feelings. Oh, Mrs.
Woodville, ain't it lucky? here is Mr. Woodville himself ."
<P>
Once more I looked at my mother-in-law. Once more the name failed
to produce the slightest effect on her. Her sight was not so keen
as ours; she had not recognized her son yet. He had young eyes
like us, and he recognized his mother. For a mome nt he stopped
like a man thunderstruck. Then he came on--his ruddy face white
with suppressed emotion, his eyes fixed on his mother.
<P>
"You here!" he said to her.
<P>
"How do you do, Eustace?" she quietly rejoined. "Have _you_ heard
of your aunt's illness too? Did you know she was staying at
Ramsgate?"
<P>
He made no answer. The landlady, drawing the inevitable inference
from the words that she had just heard, looked from me to my
mother-in-law in a state of amazement, which paralyzed even her
tongue. I waited with my eyes on my husband, to see what he would
do. If he had delayed acknowledging me another moment, the whole
future course of my life might have been altered--I should have
despised him.
<P>
He did _not_ delay. He came to my side and took my hand.
<P>
"Do you know who this is?" be said to his mother.
<P>
She answered, looking at me with a courteous bend of her head:
<P>
"A lady I met on the beach, Eustace, who kindly restored to me a
letter that I dropped. I think I heard the name" (she turned to
the landlady): Mrs. Woodville, was it not?"
<P>
My husband's fingers unconsciously closed on my hand with a grasp
that hurt me. He set his mother right, it is only just to say,
without one cowardly moment of hesitation.
<P>
"Mother," he said to her, very quietly, "this lady is my wife."
<P>
She had hitherto kept her seat. She now rose slowly and faced her
son in silence. The first expression of surprise passed from her
face. It was succeeded by the most terrible look of mingled
indignation and contempt that I ever saw in a woman's eyes.
<P>
"I pity your wife," she said.
<P>
With those words and no more, lifting her hand she waved him back
from her, and went on her way again, as we had first found her,
alone.
