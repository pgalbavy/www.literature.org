<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>On Lingardâ€™s departure solitude and silence closed round Willems;
the cruel solitude of one abandoned by men; the reproachful silence
which surrounds an outcast ejected by his kind, the silence unbroken
by the slightest whisper of hope; an immense and impenetrable
silence that swallows up without echo the murmur of regret and
the cry of revolt. The bitter peace of the abandoned clearings
entered his heart, in which nothing could live now but the memory
and hate of his past. Not remorse. In the breast of a man possessed
by the masterful consciousness of his individuality with its desires
and its rights; by the immovable conviction of his own importance,
of an importance so indisputable and final that it clothes all
his wishes, endeavours, and mistakes with the dignity of unavoidable
fate, there could be no place for such a feeling as that of remorse.</p>

<p>The days passed. They passed unnoticed, unseen, in the rapid
blaze of glaring sunrises, in the short glow of tender sunsets,
in the crushing oppression of high noons without a cloud. How
many days? Two&mdash;three&mdash;or more? He did not know. To him, since
Lingard had gone, the time seemed to roll on in profound darkness.
All was night within him. All was gone from his sight. He walked
about blindly in the deserted courtyards, amongst the empty houses
that, perched high on their posts, looked down inimically on him,
a white stranger, a man from other lands; seemed to look hostile
and mute out of all the memories of native life that lingered
between their decaying walls. His wandering feet stumbled against
the blackened brands of extinct fires, kicking up a light black
dust of cold ashes that flew in drifting clouds and settled to
leeward on the fresh grass sprouting from the hard ground, between
the shade trees. He moved on, and on; ceaseless, unresting, in
widening circles, in zigzagging paths that led to no issue; he
struggled on wearily with a set, distressed face behind which,
in his tired brain, seethed his thoughts: restless, sombre, tangled,
chilling, horrible and venomous, like a nestful of snakes.</p>

<p>From afar, the bleared eyes of the old serving woman, the sombre
gaze of Aissa followed the gaunt and tottering figure in its unceasing
prowl along the fences, between the houses, amongst the wild luxuriance
of riverside thickets. Those three human beings abandoned by all
were like shipwrecked people left on an insecure and slippery
ledge by the retiring tide of an angry sea&mdash;listening to its distant
roar, living anguished between the menace of its return and the
hopeless horror of their solitude&mdash;in the midst of a tempest of
passion, of regret, of disgust, of despair. The breath of the
storm had cast two of them there, robbed of everything&mdash;even of
resignation. The third, the decrepit witness of their struggle
and their torture, accepted her own dull conception of facts;
of strength and youth gone; of her useless old age; of her last
servitude; of being thrown away by her chief, by her nearest,
to use up the last and worthless remnant of flickering life between
those two incomprehensible and sombre outcasts: a shrivelled,
an unmoved, a passive companion of their disaster.</p>

<p>To the river Willems turned his eyes like a captive that looks
fixedly at the door of his cell. If there was any hope in the
world it would come from the river, by the river. For hours together
he would stand in sunlight while the sea breeze sweeping over
the lonely reach fluttered his ragged garments; the keen salt
breeze that made him shiver now and then under the flood of intense
heat. He looked at the brown and sparkling solitude of the flowing
water, of the water flowing ceaseless and free in a soft, cool
murmur of ripples at his feet. The world seemed to end there.
The forests of the other bank appeared unattainable, enigmatical,
for ever beyond reach like the stars of heaven&mdash;and as indifferent.
Above and below, the forests on his side of the river came down
to the water in a serried multitude of tall, immense trees towering
in a great spread of twisted boughs above the thick undergrowth;
great, solid trees, looking sombre, severe, and malevolently stolid,
like a giant crowd of pitiless enemies pressing round silently
to witness his slow agony. He was alone, small, crushed. He thought
of escape&mdash;of something to be done. What? A raft! He imagined
himself working at it, feverishly, desperately; cutting down trees,
fastening the logs together and then drifting down with the current,
down to the sea into the straits. There were ships there&mdash;ships,
help, white men. Men like himself. Good men who would rescue him,
take him away, take him far away where there was trade, and houses,
and other men that could understand him exactly, appreciate his
capabilities; where there was proper food, and money; where there
were beds, knives, forks, carriages, brass bands, cool drinks,
churches with well-dressed people praying in them. He would pray
also. The superior land of refined delights where he could sit
on a chair, eat his tiffin off a white tablecloth, nod to fellows&mdash;good
fellows; he would be popular; always was&mdash;where he could be virtuous,
correct, do business, draw a salary, smoke cigars, buy things
in shops&mdash;have boots . . . be happy, free, become rich. O God!
What was wanted? Cut down a few trees. No! One would do. They
used to make canoes by burning out a tree trunk, he had heard.
Yes! One would do. One tree to cut down . . . He rushed forward,
and suddenly stood still as if rooted in the ground. He had a
pocket-knife.</p>

<p>And he would throw himself down on the ground by the riverside.
He was tired, exhausted; as if that raft had been made, the voyage
accomplished, the fortune attained. A glaze came over his staring
eyes, over his eyes that gazed hopelessly at the rising river
where big logs and uprooted trees drifted in the shine of mid-stream:
a long procession of black and ragged specks. He could swim out
and drift away on one of these trees. Anything to escape! Anything!
Any risk! He could fasten himself up between the dead branches.
He was torn by desire, by fear; his heart was wrung by the faltering
of his courage. He turned over, face downwards, his head on his
arms. He had a terrible vision of shadowless horizons where the
blue sky and the blue sea met; or a circular and blazing emptiness
where a dead tree and a dead man drifted together, endlessly,
up and down, upon the brilliant undulations of the straits. No
ships there. Only death. And the river led to it.</p>

<p>He sat up with a profound groan.</p>

<p>Yes, death. Why should he die? No! Better solitude, better hopeless
waiting, alone. Alone. No! he was not alone, he saw death looking
at him from everywhere; from the bushes, from the clouds&mdash;he heard
her speaking to him in the murmur of the river, filling the space,
touching his heart, his brain with a cold hand. He could see and
think of nothing else. He saw it&mdash;the sure death&mdash;everywhere.
He saw it so close that he was always on the point of throwing
out his arms to keep it off. It poisoned all he saw, all he did;
the miserable food he ate, the muddy water he drank; it gave a
frightful aspect to sunrises and sunsets, to the brightness of
hot noon, to the cooling shadows of the evenings. He saw the horrible
form among the big trees, in the network of creepers in the fantastic
outlines of leaves, of the great indented leaves that seemed to
be so many enormous hands with big broad palms, with stiff fingers
outspread to lay hold of him; hands gently stirring, or hands
arrested in a frightful immobility, with a stillness attentive
and watching for the opportunity to take him, to enlace him, to
strangle him, to hold him till he died; hands that would hold
him dead, that would never let go, that would cling to his body
for ever till it perished&mdash;disappeared in their frantic and tenacious
grasp.</p>

<p>And yet the world was full of life. All the things, all the men
he knew, existed, moved, breathed; and he saw them in a long perspective,
far off, diminished, distinct, desirable, unattainable, precious
. . . lost for ever. Round him, ceaselessly, there went on without
a sound the mad turmoil of tropical life. After he had died all
this would remain! He wanted to clasp, to embrace solid things;
he had an immense craving for sensations; for touching, pressing,
seeing, handling, holding on, to all these things. All this would
remain&mdash;remain for years, for ages, for ever. After he had miserably
died there, all this would remain, would live, would exist in
joyous sunlight, would breathe in the coolness of serene nights.
What for, then? He would be dead. He would be stretched upon the
warm moisture of the ground, feeling nothing, seeing nothing,
knowing nothing; he would lie stiff, passive, rotting slowly;
while over him, under him, through him&mdash;unopposed, busy, hurried&mdash;the
endless and minute throngs of insects, little shining monsters
of repulsive shapes, with horns, with claws, with pincers, would
swarm in streams, in rushes, in eager struggle for his body; would
swarm countless, persistent, ferocious and greedy&mdash;till there
would remain nothing but the white gleam of bleaching bones in
the long grass; in the long grass that would shoot its feathery
heads between the bare and polished ribs. There would be that
only left of him; nobody would miss him; no one would remember
him.</p>

<p>Nonsense! It could not be. There were ways out of this. Somebody
would turn up. Some human beings would come. He would speak, entreat&mdash;use
force to extort help from them. He felt strong; he was very strong.
He would . . . The discouragement, the conviction of the futility
of his hopes would return in an acute sensation of pain in his
heart. He would begin again his aimless wanderings. He tramped
till he was ready to drop, without being able to calm by bodily
fatigue the trouble of his soul. There was no rest, no peace within
the cleared grounds of his prison. There was no relief but in
the black release of sleep, of sleep without memory and without
dreams; in the sleep coming brutal and heavy, like the lead that
kills. To forget in annihilating sleep; to tumble headlong, as
if stunned, out of daylight into the night of oblivion, was for
him the only, the rare respite from this existence which he lacked
the courage to endure&mdash;or to end.</p>

<p>He lived, he struggled with the inarticulate delirium of his
thoughts under the eyes of the silent Aissa. She shared his torment
in the poignant wonder, in the acute longing, in the despairing
inability to understand the cause of his anger and of his repulsion;
the hate of his looks; the mystery of his silence; the menace
of his rare words&mdash;of those words in the speech of white people
that were thrown at her with rage, with contempt, with the evident
desire to hurt her; to hurt her who had given herself, her life&mdash;all
she had to give&mdash;to that white man; to hurt her who had wanted
to show him the way to true greatness, who had tried to help him,
in her womanâ€™s dream of everlasting, enduring, unchangeable affection.
From the short contact with the whites in the crashing collapse
of her old life, there remained with her the imposing idea of
irresistible power and of ruthless strength. She had found a man
of their race&mdash;and with all their qualities. All whites are alike.
But this manâ€™s heart was full of anger against his own people,
full of anger existing there by the side of his desire of her.
And to her it had been an intoxication of hope for great things
born in the proud and tender consciousness of her influence. She
had heard the passing whisper of wonder and fear in the presence
of his hesitation, of his resistance, of his compromises; and
yet with a womanâ€™s belief in the durable steadfastness of hearts,
in the irresistible charm of her own personality, she had pushed
him forward, trusting the future, blindly, hopefully; sure to
attain by his side the ardent desire of her life, if she could
only push him far beyond the possibility of retreat. She did not
know, and could not conceive, anything of his&mdash;so exalted&mdash;ideals.
She thought the man a warrior and a chief, ready for battle, violence,
and treachery to his own people&mdash;for her. What more natural? Was
he not a great, strong man? Those two, surrounded each by the
impenetrable wall of their aspirations, were hopelessly alone,
out of sight, out of earshot of each other; each the centre of
dissimilar and distant horizons; standing each on a different
earth, under a different sky. She remembered his words, his eyes,
his trembling lips, his outstretched hands; she remembered the
great, the immeasurable sweetness of her surrender, that beginning
of her power which was to last until death. He remembered the
quaysides and the warehouses; the excitement of a life in a whirl
of silver coins; the glorious uncertainty of a money hunt; his
numerous successes, the lost possibilities of wealth and consequent
glory. She, a woman, was the victim of her heart, of her womanâ€™s
belief that there is nothing in the world but love&mdash;the everlasting
thing. He was the victim of his strange principles, of his continence,
of his blind belief in himself, of his solemn veneration for the
voice of his boundless ignorance.</p>

<p>In a moment of his idleness, of suspense, of discouragement,
she had come&mdash;that creature&mdash;and by the touch of her hand had
destroyed his future, his dignity of a clever and civilized man;
had awakened in his breast the infamous thing which had driven
him to what he had done, and to end miserably in the wilderness
and be forgotten, or else remembered with hate or contempt. He
dared not look at her, because now whenever he looked at her his
thought seemed to touch crime, like an outstretched hand. She
could only look at him&mdash;and at nothing else. What else was there?
She followed him with a timorous gaze, with a gaze for ever expecting,
patient, and entreating. And in her eyes there was the wonder
and desolation of an animal that knows only suffering, of the
incomplete soul that knows pain but knows not hope; that can find
no refuge from the facts of life in the illusory conviction of
its dignity, of an exalted destiny beyond; in the heavenly consolation
of a belief in the momentous origin of its hate.</p>

<p>For the first three days after Lingard went away he would not
even speak to her. She preferred his silence to the sound of hated
and incomprehensible words he had been lately addressing to her
with a wild violence of manner, passing at once into complete
apathy. And during these three days he hardly ever left the river,
as if on that muddy bank he had felt himself nearer to his freedom.
He would stay late; he would stay till sunset; he would look at
the glow of gold passing away amongst sombre clouds in a bright
red flush, like a splash of warm blood. It seemed to him ominous
and ghastly with a foreboding of violent death that beckoned him
from everywhere&mdash;even from the sky.</p>

<p>One evening he remained by the riverside long after sunset, regardless
of the night mist that had closed round him, had wrapped him up
and clung to him like a wet winding-sheet. A slight shiver recalled
him to his senses, and he walked up the courtyard towards his
house. Aissa rose from before the fire, that glimmered red through
its own smoke, which hung thickening under the boughs of the big
tree. She approached him from the side as he neared the plankway
of the house. He saw her stop to let him begin his ascent. In
the darkness her figure was like the shadow of a woman with clasped
hands put out beseechingly. He stopped&mdash;could not help glancing
at her. In all the sombre gracefulness of the straight figure,
her limbs, features&mdash;all was indistinct and vague but the gleam
of her eyes in the faint starlight. He turned his head away and
moved on. He could feel her footsteps behind him on the bending
planks, but he walked up without turning his head. He knew what
she wanted. She wanted to come in there. He shuddered at the thought
of what might happen in the impenetrable darkness of that house
if they were to find themselves alone&mdash;even for a moment. He stopped
in the doorway, and heard her say&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let me come in. Why this anger? Why this silence? . . . Let
me watch . . . by your side. . . . Have I not watched faithfully?
Did harm ever come to you when you closed your eyes while I was
by? . . . I have waited . .. I have waited for your smile, for
your words . . . I can wait no more.. . . Look at me . . . speak
to me. Is there a bad spirit in you? A bad spirit that has eaten
up your courage and your love? Let me touch you. Forget all .
. . All. Forget the wicked hearts, the angry faces . . . and remember
only the day I came to you . . . to you! O my heart! O my life!"</p>

<p>The pleading sadness of her appeal filled the space with the
tremor of her low tones, that carried tenderness and tears into
the great peace of the sleeping world. All around them the forests,
the clearings, the river, covered by the silent veil of night,
seemed to wake up and listen to her words in attentive stillness.
After the sound of her voice had died out in a stifled sigh they
appeared to listen yet; and nothing stirred among the shapeless
shadows but the innumerable fireflies that twinkled in changing
clusters, in gliding pairs, in wandering and solitary points&mdash;like
the glimmering drift of scattered star-dust.</p>

<p>Willems turned round slowly, reluctantly, as if compelled by
main force. Her face was hidden in her hands, and he looked above
her bent head, into the sombre brilliance of the night. It was
one of those nights that give the impression of extreme vastness,
when the sky seems higher, when the passing puffs of tepid breeze
seem to bring with them faint whispers from beyond the stars.
The air was full of sweet scent, of the scent charming, penetrating
and violent like the impulse of love. He looked into that great
dark place odorous with the breath of life, with the mystery of
existence, renewed, fecund, indestructible; and he felt afraid
of his solitude, of the solitude of his body, of the loneliness
of his soul in the presence of this unconscious and ardent struggle,
of this lofty indifference, of this merciless and mysterious purpose,
perpetuating strife and death through the march of ages. For the
second time in his life he felt, in a sudden sense of his significance,
the need to send a cry for help into the wilderness, and for the
second time he realized the hopelessness of its unconcern. He
could shout for help on every side&mdash;and nobody would answer. He
could stretch out his hands, he could call for aid, for support,
for sympathy, for relief&mdash;and nobody would come. Nobody. There
was no one there&mdash;but that woman.</p>

<p>His heart was moved, softened with pity at his own abandonment.
His anger against her, against her who was the cause of all his
misfortunes, vanished before his extreme need for some kind of
consolation. Perhaps&mdash;if he must resign himself to his fate&mdash;she
might help him to forget. To forget! For a moment, in an access
of despair so profound that it seemed like the beginning of peace,
he planned the deliberate descent from his pedestal, the throwing
away of his superiority, of all his hopes, of old ambitions, of
the ungrateful civilization. For a moment, forgetfulness in her
arms seemed possible; and lured by that possibility the semblance
of renewed desire possessed his breast in a burst of reckless
contempt for everything outside himself&mdash;in a savage disdain of
Earth and of Heaven. He said to himself that he would not repent.
The punishment for his only sin was too heavy. There was no mercy
under Heaven. He did not want any. He thought, desperately, that
if he could find with her again the madness of the past, the strange
delirium that had changed him, that had worked his undoing, he
would be ready to pay for it with an eternity of perdition. He
was intoxicated by the subtle perfumes of the night; he was carried
away by the suggestive stir of the warm breeze; he was possessed
by the exaltation of the solitude, of the silence, of his memories,
in the presence of that figure offering herself in a submissive
and patient devotion; coming to him in the name of the past, in
the name of those days when he could see nothing, think of nothing,
desire nothing&mdash;but her embrace.</p>

<p>He took her suddenly in his arms, and she clasped her hands round
his neck with a low cry of joy and surprise. He took her in his
arms and waited for the transport, for the madness, for the sensations
remembered and lost; and while she sobbed gently on his breast
he held her and felt cold, sick, tired, exasperated with his failure&mdash;and
ended by cursing himself. She clung to him trembling with the
intensity of her happiness and her love. He heard her whispering&mdash;her
face hidden on his shoulder&mdash;of past sorrow, of coming joy that
would last for ever; of her unshaken belief in his love. She had
always believed. Always! Even while his face was turned away from
her in the dark days while his mind was wandering in his own land,
amongst his own people. But it would never wander away from her
any more, now it had come back. He would forget the cold faces
and the hard hearts of the cruel people. What was there to remember?
Nothing? Was it not so? . . .</p>

<p>He listened hopelessly to the faint murmur. He stood still and
rigid, pressing her mechanically to his breast while he thought
that there was nothing for him in the world. He was robbed of
everything; robbed of his passion, of his liberty, of forgetfulness,
of consolation. She, wild with delight, whispered on rapidly,
of love, of light, of peace, of long years. . . . He looked drearily
above her head down into the deeper gloom of the courtyard. And,
all at once, it seemed to him that he was peering into a sombre
hollow, into a deep black hole full of decay and of whitened bones;
into an immense and inevitable grave full of corruption where
sooner or later he must, unavoidably, fall.</p>

<p>In the morning he came out early, and stood for a time in the
doorway, listening to the light breathing behind him&mdash;in the house.
She slept. He had not closed his eyes through all that night.
He stood swaying&mdash;then leaned against the lintel of the door.
He was exhausted, done up; fancied himself hardly alive. He had
a disgusted horror of himself that, as he looked at the level
sea of mist at his feet, faded quickly into dull indifference.
It was like a sudden and final decrepitude of his senses, of his
body, of his thoughts. Standing on the high platform, he looked
over the expanse of low night fog above which, here and there,
stood out the feathery heads of tall bamboo clumps and the round
tops of single trees, resembling small islets emerging black and
solid from a ghostly and impalpable sea. Upon the faintly luminous
background of the eastern sky, the sombre line of the great forests
bounded that smooth sea of white vapours with an appearance of
a fantastic and unattainable shore.</p>

<p>He looked without seeing anything&mdash;thinking of himself. Before
his eyes the light of the rising sun burst above the forest with
the suddenness of an explosion. He saw nothing. Then, after a
time, he murmured with conviction&mdash;speaking half aloud to himself
in the shock of the penetrating thought:</p>

<p>"I am a lost man."</p>

<p>He shook his hand above his head in a gesture careless and tragic,
then walked down into the mist that closed above him in shining
undulations under the first breath of the morning breeze.</p>
