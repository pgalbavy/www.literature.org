Suddenly rose from the South a light, as in autumn the blood-red<br/>
Moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven, and o'er the horizon,<br/>
Titan-like, stretches its hundred hands upon mountain and meadow,<br/>
Seizing the rocks and the rivers and piling huge shadows together.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;<em>LONGFELLOW</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>From a long distance the conflagration had been visible, its
light throwing a red glare far up in the sky, and revealing the
huge clouds that swept forward like crimson avalanches, while
the surrounding trees glowed as if their branches were burning
hot.  Those nearest had their bark blistered and their leaves
curled and scorched from the intense heat.  A conflagration at
night, when viewed from a distance, always seems awful in its
sublimity.  There is something calculated to inspire terror in
the illuminated dome of the heavens and the onward sweep of this
fearful element, when viewed in a civilized country; but it is
only in the wilderness, away from the abode of man, that such
an exhibition partakes of all the elements of grandeur and terror.</p>

<p>The solitary hunter, as he stood upon the banks of some lonely
stream, leaned on his rifle and gazed with a beating heart at
the brilliant redness that lit up so much of the sky.  The beasts
in their lair turned their glowing eyeballs toward the dreadful
illumination, and stood transfixed with fear until its light died
away; while the dark face of the vengeful Shawnee grew darker
and more terrible as he gazed upon this work of his own hands. 
A silence, deep and profound, rested like a pall upon the wilderness
and remained there until darkness again held undisputed reign.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Canfield had seen the glowing light from a great distance,
when its appearance was much like that of the moon as it comes
up in the horizon.  Little did he suspect its true nature.  It
was not until the next morning that he encountered Oonomoo, the
Huron, who related the particulars of the attack of the Shawnee
party upon the house of Captain Prescott and the capture of his
daughter.  Had not the impulsive Lieutenant thus learned of his
beloved's safety from massacre, had he not received the assurance
of an immediate attempt for her recapture, there is no telling
to what imprudent lengths he might have gone in his blind devotion
to the young captive.  Oonomoo remained with him but a short time,
when he departed on his mission to the Shawnee village, and the
lover continued on toward the estate of Captain Prescott.</p>

<p>It was nearly noon when Lieutenant Canfield reached the place&mdash;now
nothing but a mass of charred and blackened ruins.  Leaving his
horse in the woods, he dismounted and examined the remains of
the mansion and smaller buildings.  The ghastly corpses of the
negroes still lay upon the ground, having been undisturbed, and
with a feeling of heart-sickness the young soldier passed them
by.  In his profession, he had witnessed many revolting sights,
but none that affected him more than this.  He shuddered, as he
reflected that the very barbarians who had wantonly inflicted
his woe were the captors of the adored daughter of Captain Prescott,
and that they had inflicted as shocking outrages even upon such
defenseless captives as she.</p>

<p>Walking thus moodily forward, he was suddenly brought to a standstill
by coming in front of an awkward, odd-looking structure, which
excited his wonder in no small degree.  The charred remains of
the logs of one of the buildings had been collected together and
piled one above the other, so that they bore some resemblance
to a rudely-fashioned oven. From the circumstances of the case,
these must have been arranged in this manner subsequently to the
visit of the Shawnees, and it was this fact which awakened the
curiosity of the Lieutenant.  His first supposition was that it
was the doings of the Huron.  But what reason could he have had
for rearing such a structure?  What possible purpose could it
serve him?</p>

<p>All at once it flashed upon the Lieutenant that it was the work
of the Shawnees themselves, and he began to view the contrivance
with some apprehension.  This feeling was considerably strengthened
when he either heard or fancied he heard the movement of some
one within it. Prudence dictated that he should place a little
more distance between it and himself.  Accordingly he began to
retreat, walking backward and keeping his gaze fixed upon it,
ready for any demonstration from his concealed enemies.</p>

<p>Suddenly something within the hollow of the structure fell with
a dull thump that nearly lifted the Lieutenant from his feet. 
At the same moment he heard a suppressed growl, as if made by
a caged bear.  He now began to feel more wonder than fear.</p>

<p>"What in the name of creation is the meaning of that concern,
and what sort of animal is caged in it?" he muttered, staying
his retreat.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant debated whether or not to approach and examine
the interior of the odd-looking hut.  It seemed hardly possible
that any human being could be within, although it was certain
there was some living object there.</p>

<p>"At any rate I'll stir him up," he concluded, resolutely approaching.
The growls were now redoubled, and he really believed some four-footed
animal was the cause of all the uproar.</p>

<p>"It may be the Shawnees have attempted a little pleasantry after
their bloody work, and caged up some poor creature within those
logs," thought he.  "I'll let him loose if such be the case."</p>

<p>He placed his hand upon the stump of a log nearest to him, when
a thunderbolt appeared to have exploded before him.  He started
back as though he had received an electric shock.  A perfect battery
of howls was leveled against him, and for a moment his ears were
stunned with the deafening uproar.  He determined, however, to
solve the mystery. Giving the structure a push that brought it
tumbling to the ground, he sprung back and held his rifle prepared
for any foe, were he a four-footed or a two-footed one.  Instead
of either, what was his amazement to see a negro, as black as
midnight, emerge from the ruins, and cringe at his feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Injine, please don't shoot! please don't kill me!  Nice,
good Mr. Injine, don't hurt me!  Please don't tomahawk poor Cato! 
He never hurt an Injine in all his life.  Please don't!  Oh, don't! 
don't! don't! boo-hoo! oo!-oo-oo!"</p>

<p>"Get up, get up, Cato, and don't make a fool of yourself," said
the Lieutenant, recognizing in the frightened negro the favorite
servant of Captain Prescott's family.</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't hurt me!  Please don't kill poor Cato!  He
never hurt good Injine in all his life!  Please, good, nice Mr.
Injine, let me go, and I'll do anyt'ing you wants me to, and lubs
you as long as I lib. Please, don't hurt poor nigger Cato," repeated
the servant, fairly beside himself with terror.</p>

<p>"If you don't want to be killed, get up," said the young officer,
sternly enough to bring Cato to his senses; but only after he
had been assisted by what he supposed to be a ferocious Indian,
ready to brain him, was he enabled to rise and to keep his feet.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "If you don't want to be killed, get up," said
the young officer.]</p>

<p>"Don't you know me, Cato?" asked the Lieutenant, laughing heartily
at the woe-begone appearance of the negro.</p>

<p>"Hebens, golly! ain't you an Injine, Massa Canfield?" he asked,
his knees still shaking with terror.</p>

<p>"Do I look like one?"</p>

<p>"Guess you isn't, arter all," added the negro, with more assurance.
"Hebens, golly!  <em>I ain't afeard</em>!" he suddenly exclaimed,
straightening up proudly.  "Didn't t'ink Cato was afeard, Massa
Canfield?"</p>

<p>"I must say that the circumstantial evidence of your cowardice
is hard to resist."</p>

<p>The negro's eyes enlarged as he heard the large words of the
soldier, and his looks showed that he had no idea of their meaning.</p>

<p>"Doesn't t'ink I's <em>afeard</em>?"</p>

<p>"Why did you build such a looking concern as that?"</p>

<p>"Why I build dat?  To keep de rain off of me."</p>

<p>"It hasn't rained at all for several days."</p>

<p>"Know dat, but, den, expect maybe 'twill.  Bes' to be ready for
it when <em>does</em> come."</p>

<p>"But, as there were no evidences of a storm coming very soon,
why should you get in there just now?"</p>

<p>"Storms out in dese parts bust berry suddent sometimes.  Oughter
know dat, Massa Canfield."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do; but, why in the name of common sense did you set
up such a growling when I came near your old cabin?"</p>

<p>"Did I growl at you?"</p>

<p>"Yes: made as much noise as a grizzly bear could have done."</p>

<p>"Done it jist for fun, Massa.  Hebens, golly! wanted to see if
you was afeard, too."</p>

<p>"But," said the soldier, assuming a more serious air, "let the
jesting cease.  When did you put those logs together, Cato?"</p>

<p>"Dis morning, arter <em>dey</em> went away," he replied, with
a shudder, casting a look of terror around him.</p>

<p>"And when did they&mdash;the Shawnees&mdash;go away?"</p>

<p>"Didn't stay long, Massa; come in de night, berry late&mdash;bust
on de house all at once."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Canfield felt a painful interest in all that related
to Mary Prescott.  Although the Huron had given him the principal
incidents of the attack and massacre, he could not restrain himself
from questioning the negro still further.</p>

<p>"Had you no warning of their approach?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; didn't know dey war about till dey war among us."</p>

<p>"What was the first thing you heard, Cato?  Give me the particulars
so far as you can remember."</p>

<p>"Hebens, golly!  I'll neber forgit <em>dat</em> night if I lib
a fousand years.  Wal, you see I and Big Mose had just gwane to
bed and blowed de candle out&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Had Miss Mary retired?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;she'd been gone a good while.  You see, me and Big Mose
am generally de last niggers dat am up, specially myself.  I goes
around for to see if de t'ings am all right about de house.  Wal,
me and Mose had been around to see if eberyt'ing was right, and
was coming back from de barn and got purty near de house, when
Mose whispers, 'Cato, I see'd a man crawling on de ground back
dar.  I didn't say nuffin' for fear ob scaring ob <em>you</em>.' 
'Oh!  git out,' says I, 'you's <em>skeart</em>.' But I felt a
little oneasy myself, 'cause I kind ob fought I heern somefin'
when we was a little furder off.  I commenced for to walk fast,
and Big Mose commenced for to walk fast, and afore we knowed it,
we bofe was a canterin', and when we come aginst de door, we'd
like to 've busted it in, we was tearing along so fast.  We tumbled
in ober each oder, and fastened dat door in a hurry you'd better
beliebe."</p>

<p>"Wal, we went to our room, and blowed out de candle and said
our prayers and went to bed.  We hadn't been laying dar long,
when Big Mose turned ober toward me, and whispers, 'I tell you,
Cato, dar am Inj'ines about de house.  'Cause why I see'd one,
and I had a dream last night dat a whole lot ob dem comes here
in de night and killed all of us niggers and burnt Missis Mary!' 
Hebens, golly! Massa Canfield, I begun to turn white about de
gills when I heerd him say <em>dat</em>.  I'd been shibering and
shaking, and now I shook like de ager.  I told Big Mose to be
still and go to sleep, 'cause it seemed to me if I went to sleep
when t'ings looked bad, dey would be all right agin in de mornin'.
But, he wouldn't be still and says, 'I tell you, Cato, dar <em>am</em>
Injines crawlin' around ob dis house dis very minute, 'cause I
can hear dar knees and hands on de ground.'  I couldn't make Big
Mose keep quiet. Bimeby, he says, 'Cato, let's git up and be ready
for 'em, for dey're comin'.  I <em>knows</em> it, I ken <em>feel</em>
it in my bones.  Let's wake up Missis Mary and de niggers and
fight 'em, for dey'll be here afore morning, sure.'  Wal, dat
nigger worrid me awful.  I told him I wouldn't git up, but was
going to sleep, and turned ober in bed, but I couldn't keep my
eyes shet.</p>

<p>"Bimeby, I heard Big Mose crawling soft-like out de bed.  He
was trying to make no noise, so he wouldn't wake me, finking I
was asleep.  He stepped like a cat on de floor, and I listened
to see what he was going to do.  I heerd him move around and den
all was still.  'What you doing, Mose?' I axed.  'I'm going to
say my prayers,' he said, 'and it's de last time too, 'cause de
Injines will soon be here.'  I didn't try to stop him, for I felt
so bad, I commenced saying mine in de bed.</p>

<p>"Big Mose kept mumbling and crying for a long time, and I shaking
more and more, when all at once, hebens, golly!  I see'd somefin'
bright-like shine trough de winder, and I looked out and de barn
was all afire.  Den dar come a yell dat nearly blowed de roof
off de house. Big Mose gib a screech and run, and <em>bang-bang</em>
went a lot ob guns all around us.  De Injines was dar, burnin',
tomahawkin', screechin', shoutin', and killin' de poor niggers
as fast as dey showed demselves. I see'd Miss Mary&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Did they harm her?"</p>

<p>"No!  She didn't 'pear <em>skeart</em> a bit.  She tried to keep
de Injines from killing de poor niggers, not t'inking anyt'ing
about herself."</p>

<p>"How was it that <em>you</em> escaped?"</p>

<p>"I stayed where I was till I was nearly burnt up, when I sneaked
out and none of 'em didn't 'pear to notice me.  I hid in de woods
and stayed dar till mornin'."</p>

<p>"Did you see anything more of Miss Mary?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see'd de Injines go away purty soon, and take her along. 
Dey didn't take any ob de niggers, 'cause dey had killed 'em all
but me, and I was already dead, but I comed to agin."</p>

<p>"None of Captain Prescott's family were in the house besides
Mary, were they?" asked the Lieutenant, asking a question of which
he well knew the answer.</p>

<p>"Nobody else wan't dar&mdash;bress de Lord!  Missis Prescott and Helen
went off on a visit to de settlement, t'ree, four days ago."</p>

<p>"How was it Miss Mary remained behind?"</p>

<p>"Ki-yi! you doesn't know, eh?" said Cato, grinning vastly, in
total forgetfulness, for the moment, of his dreadful surroundings.</p>

<p>"How should I know?  Of course, I do not."</p>

<p>"Wal, den, Oonymoo, dat red Injine, told her as how maybe you'd
be 'long dese parts 'bout dis time, and <em>she</em> 'cluded she'd
be't home when <em>you</em> called.  <em>Dat's</em> how she was
heah!"</p>

<p>A thrill went through the gallant Lieutenant at this evidence
of the affection of the fair maiden he had journeyed so far to
see.  Despite the heart-sickness which had come over him at sight
of the revolting scenes around, he experienced a sort of pleasure
from the words of the negro, and felt anxious for him to say more.</p>

<p>"How do you know, Cato, that this was the reason she remained
behind?"</p>

<p>"Hebens, golly! didn't I hear her tell Missis so?"</p>

<p>"Her mother?  And what did she say?"</p>

<p>"Oh! she and Missis Helen kinder laughed, and showed all dar
white teef, and dey didn't try to persuade her to go, 'cause dey
<em>knowed</em> dar wan't no use ob tryin' to do nuffin' like
<em>dat</em>.  She lubs the Leftenant altogeder too much.  Yah!
yah!" and Cato kicked up his heels, hugely delighted.</p>

<p>"Have you told me when you built this house of yours?"</p>

<p>"T'ought I hahd.  Done dat ar workmanship dis mornin', arter
all de Injines had gone.  T'ought dar'd be somebody 'long dis
way afore long."</p>

<p>"There has been nothing saved," said the Lieutenant, looking
around and speaking apparently to himself.</p>

<p>"Noffin' but dis poor nigger, and I don't know what will become
of him now dat he's all alone," said Cato, with a woe-begone demeanor.</p>

<p>"Have no anxiety upon that account.  You shall be attended to. 
Captain Prescott and all his family are living, and, depend upon
it, you will not suffer if he can prevent it."</p>

<p>"But de house am gone&mdash;de horses&mdash;de corns&mdash;eberyt'ing but me."</p>

<p>The young soldier continued musing for a moment and then asked:</p>

<p>"How far from here is the settlement to which Mrs. Prescott has
gone?"</p>

<p>"Ten, fifteen or forty miles."</p>

<p>"Can't you tell me more precisely than that?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere atween ten and forty or fifty&mdash;dat's all I can tell."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been there yourself?"</p>

<p>"Offin&mdash;horseback."</p>

<p>"You know the way?"</p>

<p>"Jes' as well as did from de house to de barn."</p>

<p>"How would you like to go there?"</p>

<p>"What! alone?" asked Cato, the old look of terror coming back
to his countenance.</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;you have been there and back you said, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but bress your soul! de Injines wan't about den."</p>

<p>"I guess there were as many as there are this minute."</p>

<p>"Oh! gracious!  I don't want to go alone.  What made ye ax me
dat queshun?"</p>

<p>"Why, I thought this, Cato.  You see I expect Oonomoo to return
to this place by nightfall, when I intend to accompany him to
the Shawnee village where Miss Mary is held captive&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Goin' to git her?"</p>

<p>"We hope to.  I was going to propose that you should make your
way to the settlement and carry the news of this sad affair to
Mrs. Prescott and her daughter, assuring her that the Huron and
myself will do all we can to rescue Mary.  They must have seen
the light, last night, and no doubt are dreadfully anxious to
learn whether it was their mansion or not.  Besides, I doubt whether
the Huron will be willing that you should accompany us."</p>

<p>"Why won't he?  I guess Cato knows enough to take care of his
self. Allus has done it.  Done it last night."</p>

<p>"We will let the matter rest until his return.  It shall be as
he says."</p>

<p>"What time 'spect him?"</p>

<p>"In the course of a few hours.  In the meantime, there is another
matter that must be attended to.  Do you know whether there is
a spade or shovel lying about?"</p>

<p>"Dunno; guess dar is dough.  I'll see in a minute."</p>

<p>Cato ran some distance to where the charred remains of another
building were heaped together, and searching among the ruins,
brought forth a spade with a portion of the handle still left.</p>

<p>"What ye want to do dat ar?" he asked, as he brought it to the
Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"We must bury those bodies, Cato.  It would be wrong to deny
them a decent burial when we possess the time and means."</p>

<p>Cato had a mortal horror of touching any creature that was dead,
but more than once he had wished that the corpses were placed
in the ground, although he had not the courage to put them there. 
He showed no reluctance now to the performance of his portion
of the task.</p>

<p>"You know how to dig, I presume?" asked the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Yis, I offin dug wid dis berry same spade.  Whar'd you want
thar graves?"</p>

<p>"One grave will answer for the four, and this spot will do as
well as any other."</p>

<p>The soldier gave the proper directions, and the negro commenced
his labor at once.  In an hour or two, he had hollowed out a grave,
ready for the reception of the dead bodies.  He could not conceal
his repugnance to touching them, although he did not refuse to
do so.</p>

<p>"Dat ar is poor Big Mose," said he, as they took hold of a Herculean
negro, who had been brained by the keen tomahawk.  "And he knowed
the Injines war a-comin' a long time afore dey did.  Poor Mose,"
he added, as the big tears trickled down his cheek, "he neber
will eat any more big suppers or come de double-shuffle or de
back-action-spring by moonlight.  Poor feller! he had a big heel
and knowed how to handle it."</p>

<p>The body was carefully lowered into the grave, and the others,
one by one, were placed beside it.  It was a sight which haunted
Lieutenant Canfield for many a night&mdash;those black, upturned corpses&mdash;awful
evidences of the terrible passions of the Shawnees.  The earth
was carefully deposited over them and the last sad rites performed.</p>

<p>The sun was now past the meridian, and the young soldier began
to look momentarily for the appearance of the Huron.  An hour
or two had passed, when Cato spoke:</p>

<p>"Massa Canfield, 'tain't noways likely dat ar Injine will be
along afore dark.  <em>Dat's</em> de time dem critters likes to
travel, so what's de use ob our waitin' here so long.  Oder Injines
<em>mought</em> be around dese parts and wouldn't it be a good
idee to git in de woods whar dey wouldn't be so apt to see us?"</p>

<p>It struck the Lieutenant that there was some sense in the advice
of the negro; so he concluded to act upon it.  Moving away toward
the wood, his foot struck and scattered a pile of black cinders
lying near the ruins of the house.  Looking down, he saw something
glitter.  What was his surprise to discover in the ashes a gold
watch and chain which he had often seen upon the neck of Mary
Prescott.  A portion of the chain had been melted by the intense
heat, but by some singular means, the watch had been so well preserved
that there was scarcely a blemish upon it.  As he picked it up,
Cato exclaimed, with rolling eyes:</p>

<p>"Dat is Miss Mary's! dat is Miss Mary's!"</p>

<p>"It couldn't have been around her neck, certainly, when it was
lost."</p>

<p>"No, she allers laid it on de stand aside her bed, and dat's
de way it got dar.  See, dar's de legs ob de stand."</p>

<p>It was as the negro said, and in the hope of finding some more
of the valuables of the family, the soldier kicked the ashes and
cinders hither and thither and searched among them for a considerable
time. Nothing further rewarded him, however.  Placing the watch
upon his own person, he went on, across the edge of the clearing,
into the woods beyond.  He led his horse further into their protection,
and then beckoned the negro to his side.</p>

<p>"Do you feel sleepy, Cato?"</p>

<p>"No! what'd you ax that fur?"</p>

<p>"Well I do, and I am going to try to get a little sleep.  I wish
you to keep watch of the clearing while I do."</p>

<p>"Don't 'spect none of dem Injines will be back here?"</p>

<p>"No, but Oonomoo will probably soon be.  I want you to see him
the minute he comes, and awaken me so that there shall be no unnecessary
delay."</p>

<p>Cato promised to obey, and took his station nearer the clearing,
while the fatigued soldier stretched himself upon the ground and
was soon wrapped in a dreamless slumber.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Canfield slept until nearly sunset, and would have
slept even longer had he not been aroused by Cato roughly shaking
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter?" he asked, looking up in the terror-stricken
countenance of the negro.</p>

<p>"Hebens, golly! <em>dey've come</em>!"</p>

<p>"Who has come? what are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"De Injines.  Dar's forty fousand of 'em out dar in de clearing!"</p>

<p>Considerably flurried by the husky words of his sable friend,
Lieutenant Canfield arose and walked stealthily toward the clearing
to satisfy himself in regard to the cause of the negro's excessive
fear.</p>

<p>"Be keerful, or dey'll see you," admonished the latter, following
several yards behind.</p>

<p>Approaching as near the edge of the wood as he deemed prudent,
he was rewarded by the sight of some six or eight Indians&mdash;undoubtedly
Shawnees&mdash;who were examining the ruins that lay around them with
considerable curiosity.  They were ugly-looking customers in their
revolting war-paint and fantastic costumes, and the Lieutenant
felt that the wisest plan he could adopt was to give them a wide
berth. Withdrawing further into the wood, he asked the negro when
he had first seen them.</p>

<p>"Massa Canfield, I stood and watched out dar for two, free hours
till I fell asleep myself and come down kerwollup on de ground. 
I laid dar a good while afore I woke, and de fust t'ing I see'd
when I looked out dar, war dem Injines walking round, kickin'
up t'ings and makin' darselves at home ginerally.  You'd better
beliebe I trabeled fast to tell you ob it."</p>

<p>"From which direction do you think they come?"</p>

<p>"Dunno, but I finks de way dey looks dat dey come purty near
from dis way, mighty clus to whar we's standin'; and I t'inks
dey'll take de same route to git back agin."</p>

<p>Somehow or other, the Lieutenant had the same impression as the
negro. It was so strong upon him that he resolved to change their
position at once.  Accordingly, he proceeded to where his horse
was tied, and unfastening, led him into the wood.  Making a <em>détour</em>,
he came back nearly upon the opposite side of the clearing, where,
if possible, the wood was still thicker.  Here they carefully
screened themselves from observation and watched the Shawnees.</p>

<p>Hither and thither they passed, searching among the ruins for
plunder, occasionally turning up some trifle upon which they pounced
with the avidity of children, and examining the half-burnt remnants
of chairs, tables and stands, etc.  Here and there they pulled
the black, twisted nails forth, that looked like worms burnt to
a cinder, and carefully preserved them for future use.  Every
metallic substance was seized as a prize, and some of the wooden
portions of instruments were also appropriated.  Thin twists of
smoke still ascended from different spots in the clearing, and
the ashes when stirred showed the red live coals beneath them.</p>

<p>"Yah! yah! dat feller's got sumkin' nice," said Cato, laughing
heartily and silently at one of the Indians, who had pulled forth
a long board with evident delight.  Turning it over, he balanced
it on his shoulder and was walking rapidly away, when suddenly
he sprung several feet in the air with a yell of agony, and jumped
from beneath it, rubbing his shoulder very violently as if suffering
acute pain.</p>

<p>"Yah! yah! knowed 'twould do dat.  Lower part all afire, and
reckoned it burnt him a little."</p>

<p>The Indian continued dancing around for several moments, not
ashamed to show to his companions how much he suffered.  He by
no means was the only one who was caught in this manner.  Very
often, a savage would spring from the ground, with a sharp exclamation,
as some coal pierced through his moccasin, and now and then another
could be seen, slapping his fingers against his person, after
he had hastily dropped some object.  One eager Shawnee attempted
to draw a red-hot nail from a slab with his thumb and finger,
and roasted the ends of both by the operation, while a second
seated himself upon a board which set fire to the fringe of his
hunting-shirt.  He did not become aware of it until a few minutes
later, when, in walking around, the fire reached his hide. Placing
his hand behind him, he received unmistakable evidence of its
presence, when he set up a loud whoop and started at full speed
for the spring, reaching which, he seated himself in it, before
he felt entirely safe.</p>

<p>These, and many other incidents, amused the Lieutenant for the
time being, while the delight of Cato was almost uncontrollable. 
He seemed in danger of apoplexy several times from the efforts
he made to subdue his laughter.  But, all at once there was a
sudden cessation in his mirth, and a visible lengthening of his
visage.  Grasping the shoulder of the soldier, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Look dar!  Look dar!  See dem!"</p>

<p>"I see nothing to alarm us."</p>

<p>"Look dar whar we went into the clearin'.  Don't you see dem
Injines dar?"</p>

<p>Lieutenant Canfield did see something that alarmed him.  The
whole eight Indians had followed the track of himself and the
negro to the edge of the wood, where they had halted and were
consulting together. They certainly must have noticed it before,
but had probably been too busy to examine it particularly.  It
had never once occurred to the white man that this evidence of
his presence would tell against him, but he now saw the imminent
peril in which he and the negro were placed.</p>

<p>"We must flee, Cato," said he.  "Fortunately it will soon be
dark, when they cannot follow us."</p>

<p>"Will we bofe git on de hoss?" asked the frightened negro.</p>

<p>"No; it will do no good.  Let us take to the woods.  Hush!  What's
that?"</p>

<p>Just as they were about moving, the sharp report of a rifle came
upon their ears, and with a loud whoop the Shawnees rushed off
in a body, taking an easterly direction, which was different from
that followed by the soldier and negro.  Now that all immediate
danger was gone, the two remained behind, to learn, if possible,
the cause of the mysterious shot and subsequent action of the
Shawnees.</p>

<p>It was not until night, when Oonomoo, the Huron, returned, that
the cause was made known.  He had approached several hours before,
and seen the savages in consultation, and divined the cause of
it.  To divert them from pursuing his two friends, whom they would
most certainly have captured, he discharged his piece among them,
and then purposely showed himself to draw them after him.  The
stratagem succeeded as well as he could have wished.  He easily
eluded them, until they had followed him some distance in the
woods, when he made his way back again to the clearing, where
he rejoined the Lieutenant and the negro.</p>
