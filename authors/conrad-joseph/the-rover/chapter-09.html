<p>On losing sight of the perplexed lieutenant, Peyrol discovered
that his own mind was a perfect blank. He started to get down
to his tartane after one sidelong look at the face of the house
which contained quite a different problem. Let that wait. His
head feeling strangely empty, he felt the pressing necessity of
furnishing it with some thought without loss of time. He scrambled
down steep places, caught at bushes, stepped from stone to stone,
with the assurance of long practice, with mechanical precision
and without for a moment relaxing his efforts to capture some
definite scheme which he could put into his head. To his right
the cove lay full of pale light, while the rest of the Mediterranean
extended beyond it in a dark, unruffled blue. Peyrol was making
for the little basin where his tartane had been hidden for years,
like a jewel in a casket meant only for the secret rejoicing of
his eye, of no more practical use than a miser’s hoard&mdash;and as
precious! Coming upon a hollow in the ground where grew a few
bushes and even a few blades of grass, Peyrol sat down to rest.
In that position his visible world was limited to a stony slope,
a few boulders, the bush against which he leaned and the vista
of a piece of empty sea-horizon. He perceived that he detested
that lieutenant much more when he didn’t see him. There was something
in the fellow. Well, at any rate he had got rid of him for, say,
eight or ten hours. An uneasiness came over the old rover, a sense
of the endangered stability of things, which was anything but
welcome. He wondered at it, and the thought "I am growing old"
intruded on him again. And yet he was aware of his sturdy body.
He could still creep stealthily like an Indian and with his trusty
cudgel knock a man over with a certain aim at the back of his
head, and with force enough to fell him like a bullock. He had
done that thing no further back than two o’clock the night before,
not twelve hours ago, as easy as easy and without an undue sense
of exertion. This fact cheered him up. But still he could not
find an idea for his head. Not what one could call a real idea.
It wouldn’t come. It was no use sitting there.</p>

<p>He got up and after a few strides came to a stony ridge from
which he could see the two white blunt mastheads of his tartane.
Her hull was hidden from him by the formation of the shore, in
which the most prominent feature was a big flat piece of rock.
That was the spot on which not twelve hours before Peyrol, unable
to rest in his bed and coming to seek sleep in his tartane, had
seen by moonlight a man standing above his vessel and looking
down at her, a characteristic forked black shape that certainly
had no business to be there. Peyrol, by a sudden and logical deduction,
had said to himself: "Landed from an English boat." Why, how,
wherefore, he did not stay to consider. He acted at once like
a man accustomed for many years to meet emergencies of the most
unexpected kind. The dark figure, lost in a sort of attentive
amazement, heard nothing, suspected nothing. The impact of the
thick end of the cudgel came down on its head like a thunderbolt
from the blue. The sides of the little basin echoed the crash.
But he could not have heard it. The force of the blow flung the
senseless body over the edge of the flat rock and down headlong
into the open hold of the tartane, which received it with the
sound of a muffled drum. Peyrol could not have done the job better
at the age of twenty. No. Not so well. There was swiftness, mature
judgment&mdash;and the sound of the muffled drum was followed by a
perfect silence, without a sigh, without a moan. Peyrol ran round
a little promontory to where the shore shelved down to the level
of the tartane’s rail and got on board. And still the silence
remained perfect in the cold moonlight and amongst the deep shadows
of the rocks. It remained perfect because Michel, who always slept
under the half-deck forward, being wakened by the thump which
had made the whole tartane tremble, had lost the power of speech.
With his head just protruding from under the half-deck, arrested
on all fours and shivering violently like a dog that had been
washed with hot water, he was kept from advancing further by his
terror of this bewitched corpse that had come on board flying
through the air. He would not have touched it for anything.</p>

<p>The "You there, Michel," pronounced in an undertone, acted like
a moral tonic. This then was not the doing of the Evil One; it
was no sorcery! And even if it had been, now that Peyrol was there,
Michel had lost all fear. He ventured not a single question while
he helped Peyrol to turn over the limp body. Its face was covered
with blood from the cut on the forehead which it had got by striking
the sharp edge of the keelson. What accounted for the head not
being completely smashed and for no limbs being broken was the
fact that on its way through the air the victim of undue curiosity
had come in contact with and had snapped like a carrot one of
the foremast shrouds. Raising his eyes casually, Peyrol noticed
the broken rope, and at once put his hand on the man’s breast.</p>

<p>"His heart beats yet," he murmured. "Go and light the cabin lamp,
Michel."</p>

<p>"You going to take that thing into the cabin?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peyrol. "The cabin is used to that kind of thing,"
and suddenly he felt very bitter. "It has been a death-trap for
better people than this fellow, whoever he is."</p>

<p>While Michel was away executing that order Peyrol’s eyes roamed
all over the shores of the basin, for he could not divest himself
of the idea that there must be more Englishmen dodging about.
That one of the corvette’s boats was still in the cove he had
not the slightest doubt. As to the motive of her coming, it was
incomprehensible. Only that senseless form lying at his feet could
perhaps have told him: but Peyrol had little hope that it would
ever speak again. If his friends started to look for their shipmate
there was just a bare chance that they would not discover the
existence of the basin. Peyrol stooped and felt the body all over.
He found no weapon of any kind on it. There was only a common
clasp-knife on a lanyard round its neck.</p>

<p>That soul of obedience, Michel, returning from aft, was directed
to throw a couple of bucketfuls of salt water upon the bloody
head with its face upturned to the moon. The lowering of the body
down into the cabin was a matter of some little difficulty. It
was heavy. They laid it full length on a locker, and after Michel
with a strange tidiness had arranged its arms along its sides
it looked incredibly rigid. The dripping head with soaked hair
was like the head of a drowned man with a gaping pink gash on
the forehead.</p>

<p>"Go on deck to keep a lookout," said Peyrol. "We may have to
fight yet before the night’s out."</p>

<p>After Michel left him Peyrol began by flinging off his jacket
and, without a pause, dragging his shirt off over his head. It
was a very fine shirt. The Brothers of the Coast in their hours
of ease were by no means a ragged crowd, and Peyrol the gunner
had preserved a taste for fine linen. He tore the shirt into long
strips, sat down on the locker and took the wet head on his knees.
He bandaged it with some skill, working as calmly as though he
had been practising on a dummy. Then the experienced Peyrol sought
the lifeless hand and felt the pulse. The spirit had not fled
yet. The rover, stripped to the waist, his powerful arms folded
on the grizzled pelt of his bare breast, sat gazing down at the
inert face in his lap with the eyes closed peacefully under the
white band covering the forehead. He contemplated the heavy jaw
combined oddly with a certain roundness of cheek, the noticeably
broad nose with a sharp tip and a faint dent across the bridge,
either natural or the result of some old injury. A face of brown
clay, roughly modelled, with a lot of black eyelashes stuck on
the closed lids and looking artificially youthful on that physiognomy
forty years old or more. And Peyrol thought of his youth. Not
his own youth; that he was never anxious to recapture. It was
of that man’s youth that he thought, of how that face had looked
twenty years ago. Suddenly he shifted his position, and putting
his lips to the ear of that inanimate head, yelled with all the
force of his lungs:</p>

<p>"Hullo! Hullo! Wake up, shipmate!"</p>

<p>It seemed enough to wake up the dead. A faint "Voilà! Voilà!"
was the answer from a distance, and presently Michel put his head
into the cabin with an anxious grin and a gleam in the round eyes.</p>

<p>"You called, maître?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peyrol. "Come along and help me to shift him."</p>

<p>"Overboard?" murmured Michel readily.</p>

<p>"No," said Peyrol, "into that bunk. Steady! Don’t bang his head,"
he cried with unexpected tenderness. "Throw a blanket over him.
Stay in the cabin and keep his bandages wetted with salt water.
I don’t think anybody will trouble you to-night. I am going to
the house."</p>

<p>"The day is not very far off," remarked Michel.</p>

<p>This was one reason the more why Peyrol was in a hurry to get
back to the house and steal up to his room unseen. He drew on
his jacket over his bare skin, picked up his cudgel, recommended
Michel not to let that strange bird get out of the cabin on any
account. As Michel was convinced that the man would never walk
again in his life, he received those instructions without particular
emotion.</p>

<p>The dawn had broken some time before Peyrol, on his way up to
Escampobar happened to look round and had the luck to actually
see with his own eyes the English man-of-war’s boat pulling out
of the cove. This confirmed his surmises but did not enlighten
him a bit as to the causes. Puzzled and uneasy, he approached
the house through the farmyard. Catherine, always the first up,
stood at the open kitchen door. She moved aside and would have
let him pass without remark, if Peyrol himself had not asked in
a whisper: "Anything new?" She answered him in the same tone:
"She has taken to roaming at night." Peyrol stole silently up
to his bedroom, from which he descended an hour later as though
he had spent all the night in his bed up there.</p>

<p>It was this nocturnal adventure which had affected the character
of Peyrol’s forenoon talk with the lieutenant. What with one thing
and another, he found it very trying. Now that he had got rid
of Réal for several hours, the rover had to turn his attention
to that other invader of the strained, questionable, and ominous
in its origins, peace of the Escampobar Farm. As he sat on the
flat rock with his eyes fixed idly on the few drops of blood betraying
his last night’s work to the high heaven, and trying to get hold
of something definite that he could think about, Peyrol became
aware of a faint thundering noise. Faint as it was, it filled
the whole basin. He soon guessed its nature, and his face lost
its perplexity. He picked up his cudgel, got on his feet briskly,
muttering to himself, "He’s anything but dead," and hurried on
board the tartane.</p>

<p>On the after-deck Michel was keeping a lookout. He had carried
out the orders he had received by the well. Besides being secured
by the very obvious padlock, the cabin door was shored up by a
spar which made it stand as firm as a rock. The thundering noise
seemed to issue from its immovable substance magically. It ceased
for a moment, and a sort of distracted continuous growling could
be heard. Then the thundering began again. Michel reported:</p>

<p>"This is the third time he starts this game."</p>

<p>"Not much strength in this," remarked Peyrol gravely.</p>

<p>"That he can do it at all is a miracle," said Michel, showing
a certain excitement. "He stands on the ladder and beats the door
with his fists. He is getting better. He began about half an hour
after I got back on board. He drummed for a bit and then fell
off the ladder. I heard him. I had my ear against the scuttle.
He lay there and talked to himself for a long time. Then he went
at it again." Peyrol approached the scuttle while Michel added
his opinion: "He will go on like that for ever. You can’t stop
him."</p>

<p>"Easy there," said Peyrol, in a deep authoritative voice. "Time
you finish that noise."</p>

<p>These words brought instantly a deathlike silence. Michel ceased
to grin. He wondered at the power of these few words of a foreign
language.</p>

<p>Peyrol himself smiled faintly. It was ages since he had uttered
a sentence of English. He waited complacently until Michel had
unbarred and unlocked the door of the cabin. After it was thrown
open he boomed out a warning: "Stand clear!" and, turning about,
went down with great deliberation, ordering Michel to go forward
and keep a lookout.</p>

<p>Down there the man with the bandaged head was hanging on to the
table and swearing feebly without intermission. Peyrol, after
listening for a time with an air of interested recognition, as
one would to a tune heard many years ago, stopped it by a deep-voiced:</p>

<p>"That will do." After a short silence he added: "You look bien
malade, hein? What you call sick," in a tone which if not tender
was certainly not hostile. "We will remedy that."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the prisoner, looking frightened and throwing
his arm up quickly to guard his head against the coming blow.
But Peyrol’s uplifted hand fell only on his shoulder in a hearty
slap which made him sit down suddenly on a locker in a partly
collapsed attitude and unable to speak. But though very much dazed,
he was able to watch Peyrol open a cupboard and produce from there
a small demijohn and two tin cups. He took heart to say plaintively:
"My throat’s like tinder," and then suspiciously: "Was it you
who broke my head?"</p>

<p>"It was me," admitted Peyrol, sitting down on the opposite side
of the table and leaning back to look at his prisoner comfortably.</p>

<p>"What the devil did you do that for?" inquired the other with
a sort of faint fierceness which left Peyrol unmoved.</p>

<p>"Because you put your nose where you no business. Understand?
I see you there under the moon, penché, eating my tartane with
your eyes. You never hear me, hein?"</p>

<p>"I believe you walked on air. Did you mean to kill me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in preference to letting you go and make a story of it
on board your cursed corvette."</p>

<p>"Well then, now’s your chance to finish me. I am as weak as a
kitten."</p>

<p>"How did you say that? Kitten? Ha, ha, ha," laughed Peyrol. "You
make a nice petit chat." He seized the demijohn by the neck and
filled the mugs. "There," he went on, pushing one towards the
prisoner&mdash;"it’s good drink&mdash;that."</p>

<p>Symons’ state was as though the blow had robbed him of all power
of resistance, of all faculty of surprise and generally of all
the means by which a man may assert himself, except bitter resentment.
His head was aching, it seemed to him enormous, too heavy for
his neck and as if full of hot smoke. He took a drink under Peyrol’s
fixed gaze and with uncertain movements put down the mug. He looked
drowsy for a moment. Presently a little colour deepened his bronze;
he hitched himself up on the locker and said in a strong voice:</p>

<p>"You played a damned dirty trick on me. Call yourself a man,
walking on air behind a fellow’s back and felling him like a bullock."</p>

<p>Peyrol nodded calmly and sipped from his mug.</p>

<p>"If I had met you anywhere else but looking at my tartane I would
have done nothing to you. I would have permitted you to go back
to your boat. Where was your damned boat?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell you? I can’t tell where I am. I’ve never been
here before. How long have I been here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, about fourteen hours," said Peyrol.</p>

<p>"My head feels as if it would fall off if I moved," grumbled
the other.... "You are a damned bungler, that’s what you are."</p>

<p>"What for&mdash;bungler?"</p>

<p>"For not finishing me off at once."</p>

<p>He seized the mug and emptied it down his throat. Peyrol drank
too, observing him all the time. He put the mug down with extreme
gentleness and said slowly:</p>

<p>"How could I know it was you? I hit hard enough to crack the
skull of any other man."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? What do you know about my skull? What are
you driving at? I don’t know you, you white-headed villain, going
about at night knocking people on the head from behind. Did you
do for our officer, too?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes! Your officer. What was he up to? What trouble did you
people come to make here, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Do you think they tell a boat’s crew? Go and ask our officer.
He went up the gully and our coxswain got the jumps. He says to
me: ‘You are lightfooted, Sam,’ says he; ‘you just creep round
the head of the cove and see if our boat can be seen across from
the other side.’ Well, I couldn’t see anything. That was all right.
But I thought I would climb a little higher amongst the rocks...."</p>

<p>He paused drowsily.</p>

<p>"That was a silly thing to do," remarked Peyrol in an encouraging
voice.</p>

<p>"I would’ve sooner expected to see an elephant inland than a
craft lying in a pool that seemed no bigger than my hand. Could
not understand how she got there. Couldn’t help going down to
find out&mdash;and the next thing I knew I was lying on my back with
my head tied up, in a bunk in this kennel of a cabin here. Why
couldn’t you have given me a hail and engaged me properly, yardarm
to yardarm? You would have got me all the same, because all I
had in the way of weapons was the clasp-knife which you have looted
off me."</p>

<p>"Up on the shelf there," said Peyrol, looking round. "No, my
friend, I wasn’t going to take the risk of seeing you spread your
wings and fly."</p>

<p>"You need not have been afraid for your tartane. Our boat was
after no tartane. We wouldn’t have taken your tartane for a gift.
Why, we see them by dozens every day&mdash;those tartanes."</p>

<p>Peyrol filled the two mugs again. "Ah," he said, "I dare say
you see many tartanes, but this one is not like the others. You
a sailor&mdash;and you couldn’t see that she was something extraordinary."</p>

<p>"Hellfire and gunpowder!" cried the other. "How can you expect
me to have seen anything. I just noticed that her sails were bent
before your club hit me on the head." He raised his hands to his
head and groaned. "Oh lord, I feel as though I had been drunk
for a month."</p>

<p>Peyrol’s prisoner did look somewhat as though he had got his
head broken in a drunken brawl. But to Peyrol his appearance was
not repulsive. The rover preserved a tender memory of his freebooter’s
life with its lawless spirit and its spacious scene of action,
before the change in the state of affairs in the Indian Ocean,
the astounding rumours from the outer world, made him reflect
on its precarious character. It was true that he had deserted
the French flag when quite a youngster; but at that time that
flag was white; and now it was a flag of three colours. He had
known the practice of liberty, equality and fraternity as understood
in the haunts, open or secret, of the Brotherhood of the Coast.
So the change, if one could believe what people talked about,
could not be very great. The rover had also his own positive notions
as to what these three words were worth. Liberty&mdash;to hold your
own in the world if you could. Equality&mdash;yes! But no body of men
ever accomplished anything without a chief. All this was worth
what it was worth. He regarded fraternity somewhat differently.
Of course brothers would quarrel amongst themselves; it was during
a fierce quarrel that flamed up suddenly in a company of Brothers
that he had received the most dangerous wound of his life. But
for that Peyrol nursed no grudge against anybody. In his view
the claim of the Brotherhood was a claim for help against the
outside world. And here he was sitting opposite a Brother whose
head he had broken on sufficient grounds. There he was across
the table looking dishevelled and dazed, uncomprehending and aggrieved,
and that head of his proved as hard as ages ago when the nickname
of Testa Dura had been given to him by a Brother of Italian origin
on some occasion or other, some butting match no doubt; just as
he, Peyrol himself, was known for a time on both sides of the
Mozambique Channel as Poigne-de-Fer, after an incident when in
the presence of the Brothers he played at arm’s length with the
windpipe of an obstreperous negro sorcerer with an enormous girth
of chest. The villagers brought out food with alacrity, and the
sorcerer was never the same man again. It had been a great display.</p>

<p>Yes, no doubt it was Testa Dura; the young neophyte of the order
(where and how picked up Peyrol never heard), strange to the camp,
simple-minded and much impressed by the swaggering cosmopolitan
company in which he found himself. He had attached himself to
Peyrol in preference to some of his own countrymen, of whom there
were several in that band, and used to run after him like a little
dog and certainly had acted a good shipmate’s part on the occasion
of that wound, which had neither killed nor cowed Peyrol but merely
had given him an opportunity to reflect at leisure on the conduct
of his own life.</p>

<p>The first suspicion of that amazing fact had intruded on Peyrol
while he was bandaging that head by the light of the smoky lamp.
Since the fellow still lived, it was not in Peyrol to finish him
off or let him lie unattended like a dog. And then this was a
sailor. His being English was no obstacle to the development of
Peyrol’s mixed feelings in which hatred certainly had no place.
Amongst the members of the Brotherhood it was the Englishmen whom
he preferred. He had also found amongst them that particular and
loyal appreciation, which a Frenchman of character and ability
will receive from Englishmen sooner than from any other nation.
Peyrol had at times been a leader, without ever trying for it
very much, for he was not ambitious. The lead used to fall to
him mostly at a time of crisis of some sort; and when he had got
the lead it was on the Englishmen that he used to depend most.</p>

<p>And so that youngster had turned into this English man-of-war’s
man! In the fact itself there was nothing impossible. You found
Brothers of the Coast in all sorts of ships and in all sorts of
places. Peyrol had found one once in a very ancient and hopeless
cripple practising the profession of a beggar on the steps of
Manila cathedral, and had left him the richer by two broad gold
pieces to add to his secret hoard. There was a tale of a Brother
of the Coast having become a mandarin in China, and Peyrol believed
it. One never knew where and in what position one would find a
Brother of the Coast. The wonderful thing was that this one should
have come to seek him out, to put himself in the way of his cudgel.
Peyrol’s greatest concern had been all through that Sunday morning
to conceal the whole adventure from Lieutenant Réal. As against
a wearer of epaulettes, mutual protection was the first duty between
Brothers of the Coast. The unexpectedness of that claim coming
to him after twenty years invested it with an extraordinary strength.
What he would do with the fellow he didn’t know. But since that
morning the situation had changed. Peyrol had received the lieutenant’s
confidence and had got on terms with him in a special way. He
fell into profound thought.</p>

<p>"Sacrée tête dure," he muttered without rousing himself. Peyrol
was annoyed a little at not having been recognized. He could not
conceive how difficult it would have been for Symons to identify
this portly deliberate person with a white head of hair as the
object of his youthful admiration, the black-ringletted French
Brother in the prime of life of whom everybody thought so much.
Peyrol was roused by hearing the other declare suddenly:</p>

<p>"I am an Englishman, I am. I am not going to knuckle under to
anybody. What are you going to do with me?"</p>

<p>"I will do what I please," said Peyrol, who had been asking himself
exactly the same question.</p>

<p>"Well, then, be quick about it, whatever it is. I don’t care
a damn what you do, but&mdash;be&mdash;quick&mdash;about it."</p>

<p>He tried to be emphatic; but as a matter of fact the last words
came out in a faltering tone. And old Peyrol was touched. He thought
that if he were to let him drink the mugful standing there, it
would make him dead drunk. But he took the risk. So he said only:</p>

<p>"Allons&mdash;drink!" The other did not wait for a second invitation
but could not control very well the movements of his arm extended
towards the mug. Peyrol raised his on high.</p>

<p>"Trinquons, eh?" he proposed. But in his precarious condition
the Englishman remained unforgiving.</p>

<p>"I’m damned if I do," he said indignantly, but so low that Peyrol
had to turn his ear to catch the words. "You will have to explain
to me first what you meant by knocking me on the head."</p>

<p>He drank, staring all the time at Peyrol in a manner which was
meant to give offence but which struck Peyrol as so childlike
that he burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>"Sacré imbécile, va! Did I not tell you it was because of the
tartane? If it hadn’t been for the tartane I would have hidden
from you. I would have crouched behind a bush like a&mdash;what do
you call them?&mdash;lièvre."</p>

<p>The other, who was feeling the effect of the drink, stared with
frank incredulity.</p>

<p>"You are of no account," continued Peyrol. "Ah! if you had been
an officer I would have gone for you anywhere. Did you say your
officer went up the gully?"</p>

<p>Symons sighed deeply and easily. "That’s the way he went. We
had heard on board of a house thereabouts."</p>

<p>"Oh, he went to the house!" said Peyrol. "Well, if he did get
there he must be very sorry for himself. There is half a company
of infantry billeted in the farm."</p>

<p>This inspired fib went down easily with the English sailor. Soldiers
were stationed in many parts of the coast as any seaman of the
blockading fleet knew very well. To the many expressions which
had passed over the face of that man recovering from a long period
of unconsciousness there was added the shade of dismay.</p>

<p>"What the devil have they stuck soldiers on this piece of rock
for?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, signalling post and things like that. I am not likely to
tell you everything. Why! you might escape."</p>

<p>That phrase reached the soberest spot in the whole of Symons’
individuality. Things were happening, then. Mr. Bolt was a prisoner.
But the main idea evoked in his confused mind was that he would
be given up to those soldiers before very long. The prospect of
captivity made his heart sink, and he resolved to give as much
trouble as he could.</p>

<p>"You will have to get some of these soldiers to carry me up.
I won’t walk. I won’t. Not after having had my brains nearly knocked
out from behind. I tell you straight! I won’t walk. Not a step.
They will have to carry me ashore."</p>

<p>Peyrol only shook his head deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"Now you go and get a corporal with a file of men," insisted
Symons obstinately. "I want to be made a proper prisoner of. Who
the devil are you? You had no right to interfere. I believe you
are a civilian. A common marinero, whatever you may call yourself.
You look to me a pretty fishy marinero at that. Where did you
learn English? In prison&mdash;eh? You ain’t going to keep me in this
damned dog-hole, on board your rubbishy tartane. Go and get that
corporal, I tell you."</p>

<p>He looked suddenly very tired and only murmured: "I am an Englishman,
I am."</p>

<p>Peyrol’s patience was positively angelic.</p>

<p>"Don’t you talk about the tartane," he said impressively, making
his words as distinct as possible. "I told you she was not like
the other tartanes. That is because she is a courier boat. Every
time she goes to sea she makes a pied-de-nez, what you call thumb
to the nose, to all your English cruisers. I do not mind telling
you because you are my prisoner. You will soon learn French now."</p>

<p>"Who are you? The caretaker of this thing or what?" asked the
undaunted Symons. But Peyrol’s mysterious silence seemed to intimidate
him at last. He became dejected and began to curse in a languid
tone all boat expeditions, the coxswain of the gig and his own
infernal luck.</p>

<p>Peyrol sat alert and attentive like a man interested in an experiment,
while after a moment Symons’ face began to look as if he had been
hit with a club again, but not as hard as before. A film came
over his round eyes and the words "fishy marinero" made their
way out of his lips in a sort of death-bed voice. Yet such was
the hardness of his head that he actually rallied enough to address
Peyrol in an ingratiating tone.</p>

<p>"Come, grandfather!" He tried to push the mug across the table
and upset it. "Come! Let us finish what’s in that tiny bottle
of yours."</p>

<p>"No," said Peyrol, drawing the demijohn to his side of the table
and putting the cork in.</p>

<p>"No?" repeated Symons in an unbelieving voice and looking at
the demijohn fixedly ... "you must be a tinker."... He tried to
say something more under Peyrol’s watchful eyes, failed once or
twice, and suddenly pronounced the word "cochon" so correctly
as to make old Peyrol start. After that it was no use looking
at him any more. Peyrol busied himself in locking up the demijohn
and the mugs. When he turned round most of the prisoner’s body
was extended over the table and no sound came from it, not even
a snore.</p>

<p>When Peyrol got outside, pulling to the door of the cuddy behind
him, Michel hastened from forward to receive the master’s orders.
But Peyrol stood so long on the after-deck meditating profoundly
with his hand over his mouth that Michel became fidgety and ventured
a cheerful: "It looks as if he were not going to die."</p>

<p>"He is dead," said Peyrol with grim jocularity. "Dead drunk.
And you very likely will not see me till to-morrow sometime."</p>

<p>"But what am I to do?" asked Michel timidly.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Peyrol. "Of course you must not let him set fire
to the tartane."</p>

<p>"But suppose," insisted Michel, "he should give signs of escaping."</p>

<p>"If you see him trying to escape," said Peyrol with mock solemnity,
"then, Michel, it will be a sign for you to get out of his way
as quickly as you can. A man who would try to escape with a head
like this on him would just swallow you at one mouthful."</p>

<p>He picked up his cudgel and, stepping ashore, went off without
as much as a look at his faithful henchman. Michel listened to
him scrambling amongst the stones, and his habitual amiably vacant
face acquired a sort of dignity from the utter and absolute blankness
that came over it.</p>
