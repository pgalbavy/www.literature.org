<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>During that first year Athalie Greensleeve saw a great deal of
New York society, professionally, and of many New York men, socially.</p>

<p>But the plaything which society attempted to make of her she
gently but adroitly declined to become. She herself drew this
line whenever it was necessary to draw it, never permitting herself
to mistake the fundamental attitude of these agreeable and amicably
demonstrative people toward her, or toward any girl who lived
alone in New York and who practised such a profession.</p>

<p>Not among the people who employed her and who paid her lavishly
for an evening's complacency; not among people who sought her
at her own place during business hours for professional advice
or for lighter amusement could she expect any other except professional
recognition.</p>

<p>And after a few months of wistful loneliness she came, gradually,
to desire from these people nothing except what they gave.</p>

<p>But there were some people she met during that first year's practice
of her new profession who seemed to be unimpressed by the popular
belief in such an awesome actuality as New York "society." And
some of these, oddly enough, were the descendants of those who,
perhaps, had formed part of the only real society the big, raw,
sprawling city ever had. But that was long, long ago, in the day
of the first President.</p>

<p>New York will always be spotted with the symptoms but will never
again have it. Paris has gone the same way. London is still flushed
with it, Berlin hectic, Vienna fevered. But the days of a "society"
as a distinct <em>ensemble</em>, with a logical reason for being,
with authority, with functions, with offensive and defensive powers
and fixed boundaries, is over forever; possibly never existed,
certainly never will exist in the series of gregarious aggregations
and segregations known to a perplexed and slightly amused world
as the city of New York.</p>

<p>For Athalie that first year of new interests and of unfamiliar
successes passed more rapidly than had any single month ever before
passed in her life since the strenuous and ragged days of childhood.</p>

<p>It was a year of novelty, of excitement, of self-development,
and the development of interests as new as they had been unsuspected.</p>

<p>Like a gaily illuminated pageant the processional passed before
her with its constantly changing surroundings, new faces, new
voices, new ideas, new motives.</p>

<p>And the new faces were to be scanned and understood, the new
voices listened to intently, the new ideas analysed, the new motives
detected and dissected.</p>

<p>In drawing-rooms, in ballrooms, in boudoirs, new scenes constantly
presented themselves; one house was never like the next, one hostess
never resembled another; wealth itself was presented to her under
innumerable aspects ranging all the way from that false modesty
and smugness known as meekness, to fevered pretence, arrogance,
and noisy aggressiveness.</p>

<p>Wonderful school for a girl to learn in!&mdash;the gilded halls of
which were eternally vexed and swept by the winds and whirlwinds
of every human passion.</p>

<p>For here, under her still, clear scrutiny, was huddled humanity
itself, unconsciously bent on self-revelation. And Athalie's very
presence amid assemblies ever shifting, ever renewed, was educating
her eyes and ears and intellect to an insight and a comprehension
she had never dreamed of.</p>

<p>In some the supreme necessity for self-ventilation interested
her; in others, secretiveness hermetically sealed fascinated her.
Motives interested or disinterested, sordid or noble; desires,
aspirations, hopes, perplexities,&mdash;whatever a glance, a word,
an attitude, a silence, suggested to her, fixed her attention,
excited her intelligence to curiosity, and focussed her interest
to a mental concentration.</p>

<p>Out of which emerged deductions&mdash;curious fruits of logic, experience,
instinct, intuitiveness, and of some extraneous perception, outside
of and independent of her own conscious and objective personality.</p>

<p>But in one radical particular Athalie differed from any individual
of either sex ever recorded in the history of hypnotic therapeutics
or of psychic phenomena.</p>

<p>For those two worlds in which we all dwell, the supraliminal
or waking world, the transliminal, or sleeping world, were merged
in this young girl.</p>

<p>The psychological fact that natural or induced sleep is necessary
for extraneous or for auto-suggestion, did not exist for her.
Her psychic qualities were natural and beautiful, as much a part
of her objective as of her subjective life. Neither the trance
induced by mesmerism or hypnotism, nor the less harmful slumber
by induction, nor the sleep of nature itself was necessary for
the girl to find herself in rapport with others or with her own
higher personality&mdash;her superior spiritual self. Nor did her clairvoyance
require trances; nor was sleep in others necessary before she
ventured suggestion.</p>

<p>A celebrated physician who had been eager to meet her found her
extremely interesting but rather beyond his ability to classify.</p>

<p>How much of her he believed to be fraud might be suspected by
what he said to her that evening in a corner of a very grand house
on Fifth Avenue:</p>

<p>"There is no such thing as a 'control'; there is no such thing
as a 'medium.' No so-called medium has ever revealed anything
that did not exist either in her own consciousness or in the consciousness
of some other living human being.</p>

<p>"Self-delusion induced by auto-suggestion accounts for the more
respectable victims of Spiritism. For Spiritism is a doctrine
accepted by many people of education, intelligence, refinement,
and of generally excellent judgment.</p>

<p>"And it is a pity, because Spiritism is a bar to all real intellectual,
material, moral, and spiritual progress. It thrives only because
it pretends to satisfy an intense human craving&mdash;the desire to
re-establish personal relations with the dead. It never has done
this; it never will, Miss Greensleeve. And if you really believe
it has done this you are sadly and hopelessly mistaken."</p>

<p>"But," said Athalie, looking at him out of blue eyes the chiefest
beauty of which was their fearless candour, "I do not concern
myself with what is called Spiritism&mdash;with trances, table-tipping,
table-rapping, slate-writing, apparitions, reincarnations&mdash;with
cabinets, curtains, darkened rooms, psychic circles."</p>

<p>"You employ a crystal in your profession."</p>

<p>"Yes. I need not."</p>

<p>"Why do you do it, then?"</p>

<p>"Some clients ask for it."</p>

<p>"And you see things in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl simply.</p>

<p>"And when your clients do not demand a crystal-reading?"</p>

<p>"I can see perfectly well without it&mdash;when I can see clearly
at all."</p>

<p>"Into the future?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes."</p>

<p>"The past, too, of course."</p>

<p>"Not always."</p>

<p>She fascinated the non-scientific side of this famous physician;
he interested her intensely.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she ventured with a faint smile, "that you are
really quite as psychically endowed as I am?"</p>

<p>His handsome, sanguine features flushed deeply, but he smiled
in appreciation.</p>

<p>"Not in the manner you so saucily imply, Miss Greensleeve," he
said gaily. "My work is sound, logical, reasonable, and based
on fundamental truths capable of being proven. I never saw an
apparition in my life&mdash;and believed that it was really there!"</p>

<p>"Oh! So you <em>have</em> seen an apparition?"</p>

<p>"None that could have really existed independently of my own
vision. In other words it wouldn't have been there at all if I
hadn't supposed I had seen it."</p>

<p>"You <em>did</em> suppose so?"</p>

<p>"I knew perfectly well that I didn't see it. I didn't even think
I saw it."</p>

<p>"But you <em>saw</em> it?"</p>

<p>"I imagined I did, and at the same time I knew I didn't."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said quietly, "you did see it, Dr. Westland. You have
seen it more than once. You will see it again."</p>

<p>A heavier colour dyed his face; he started impatiently as though
to check her&mdash;as though to speak; and did not.</p>

<p>She said: "If what I say is distasteful to you, please stop me."
She waited a moment; then, as he evinced no desire to check or
interrupt her: "I <em>am</em> very diffident about saying this
to you&mdash;to a man so justly celebrated&mdash;pre-eminent in the greatest
of all professions. I am so insignificant in comparison, so unimportant,
so ignorant where you are experienced and learned.</p>

<p>"But may I say to you that nothing dies? I am not referring to
a possible spiritual world inhabited perhaps by souls. I mean
that here, on this earth, all around us, nothing that has ever
lived really dies.... Is what I say distasteful to you?"</p>

<p>He offered no reply.</p>

<p>"Because," she said in a low voice, "if I say anything more it
would concern you. And what you saw.... For what you saw was alive,
and real&mdash;as truly living as you and I are. It is nothing to wonder
at, nothing to trouble or perplex you, to see clearly&mdash;anybody&mdash;you
have ever&mdash;<em>loved</em>."</p>

<p>He looked up at her in a silence so strained, so longing, so
intense, that she felt the terrific tension.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "you saw clearly and truly when you saw&mdash;her."</p>

<p>"Who? in God's name!"</p>

<p>"Need I tell you, Dr. Westland?"</p>

<p>No, she had no need to tell him. His wife was dead. But it was
not his wife he had seen so often in his latter years.</p>

<p>No, she had no need to tell him.</p>

<p>Athalie had never been inclined to care for companions of her
own sex. As a child she had played with boys, preferring them.
Few women appealed to her as qualified for her friendship&mdash;only
one or two here and there and at rare intervals seemed to her
sufficiently interesting to cultivate. And to the girl's sensitive
and shy advances, here and there, some woman responded.</p>

<p>Thus she came to know and to exchange occasional social amenities
with Adele Millis, a youthful actress, with Rosalie Faithorn,
a handsome girl born to a formal social environment, but sufficiently
independent to explore outside of it and snap her fingers at the
opinions of those peeping over the bulwarks to see what she was
doing.</p>

<p>Also there was Peggy Brooks, a fascinating, breezy, capable young
creature who was Dr. Brooks to many, and Peggy to very few. And
there were one or two others, like Nina Grey and Jeanne Delauny
and Anne Randolph.</p>

<p>But of men there would have been no limit and no end had Athalie
not learned very early in the game how to check them gently but
firmly; how to test, pick, discriminate, sift, winnow, and choose
those to be admitted to her rooms after the hours of business
had ended.</p>

<p>Of these the standards differed, so that she herself scarcely
knew why such and such a one had been chosen&mdash;men, for instance,
like Cecil Reeve and Arthur Ensart&mdash;perhaps even such a man as
James Allys, 3rd. Captain Dane, of course, had been a foregone
conclusion, and John Lyndhurst was logical enough; also W. Grismer,
and the jaunty, obese Mr. Welter, known in sporting circles as
Helter Skelter Welter, and more briefly and profanely as Hel.
His running mate, Harry Ferris had been included. And there was
a number of others privileged to drift into the rooms of Athalie
Greensleeve when she chose to be at home to anybody.</p>

<p>From Clive she heard nothing: and she wrote to him no more. Of
him she did hear from time to time&mdash;mere scraps of conversation
caught, a word or two volunteered, some careless reference, perhaps,
perhaps some scrap of intentional information or some comment
deliberate if not a trifle malicious.</p>

<p>But to all who mentioned him in her presence she turned a serene
face and unclouded eyes. On the surface she was not to be read
concerning what she thought of Clive Bailey&mdash;if indeed she thought
about him at all.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had married Winifred Stuart in London, where, it
appeared, they had taken a house for the season. All sorts of
honourables and notables and nobles as well as the resident and
visiting specimens of a free and sovereign people had been bidden
to the wedding. And had joyously repaired thither&mdash;the bride being
fabulously wealthy and duly presented at Court.</p>

<p>The American Ambassador was there with the entire staff of the
Embassy; also a king in exile, several famished but receptive
dukes and counts and various warriors out of jobs&mdash;all magnetised
by the subtle radiations from the world's most powerful loadstone,
money.</p>

<p>They said that Mrs. Bailey, Sr., was very beautiful and impressive
in a gown that hypnotised the peeresses&mdash;or infuriated them&mdash;nobody
seemed to know exactly which.</p>

<p>Cecil Reeve, lounging on the balcony by the open window one May
evening, said to Hargrave&mdash;and probably really unconscious that
Athalie could hear him if she cared to: "Well, he got her all
right&mdash;or rather his mother got her. When he wakes up he'll be
sick enough of her millions."</p>

<p>Hargrave said: "She's a cold-blooded little proposition. I've
known Winifred Stuart all my life, and I never knew her to have
any impulse except a fishy one."</p>

<p>"Cold as a cod," nodded Cecil. "Merry times ahead for Clive."</p>

<p>And on another occasion, later in the summer, somebody said in
the cool dusk of the room:</p>

<p>"It's true that the Bailey Juniors are living permanently in
England. I saw Clive in Scotland when I was fishing out Banff
way. He says they're remaining abroad indefinitely."</p>

<p>Some man's voice asked how Clive was looking.</p>

<p>"Not very fit; thin and old. I was with him several times that
month and I never saw him crack a smile. That's not like him,
you know."</p>

<p>"What is it? His wife?"</p>

<p>"Well, I fancy it lies somewhere between his mother and his wife&mdash;this
pre-glacial freeze-up that's made a bally mummy of him."</p>

<p>And still again, and in the tobacco-scented dusk of Athalie's
room, and once more from a man who had just returned from abroad:</p>

<p>"I kept running into Clive everywhere. He seems to haunt the
continent, turning up like a ghost here and there; and believe
me he looks the part of the lonely spook."</p>

<p>"Where's his Missis?"</p>

<p>"They've chucked the domestic. Didn't you know?"</p>

<p>"Divorced?"</p>

<p>"No. But they don't get on. What man could with that girl? So
poor old Clive is dawdling around the world all alone, and his
wife's entertainments are the talk of London, and his mother has
become pious and is building a chapel for herself to repose in
some day when the cards go against her in the jolly game."</p>

<p>The cards went against her in the game that autumn.</p>

<p>Athalie had been writing to her sister Catharine, and had risen
from her desk to find a stick of sealing-wax, when, as she turned
to go toward her bedroom, she saw Clive's mother coming toward
her.</p>

<p>Never but once before had she seen Mrs. Bailey&mdash;that night at
the Regina&mdash;and, for the first time in her life, she recoiled
before such a visitor. A hot, proud colour flared in her cheeks
as she drew quietly aside and stood with averted head to let her
pass.</p>

<p>But Clive's mother gazed at her gently, wistfully, lingering
as she passed the girl in the passage-way. And Athalie, turning
her head slowly to look after her, saw a quiet smile on her lips
as she went her silent way; and presently was no longer there.
Then the girl continued on her own way in search of the sealing-wax;
but she was moving uncertainly now, one arm outstretched, feeling
along the familiar walls and furniture, half-blinded with her
tears.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Mrs. Bailey, Jr., looked pale and pretty sitting
there."]</p>

<p>So the chapel fulfilled its functions.</p>

<p>It was a very ornamental private chapel. Mrs. Bailey, Sr., had
had it pretty well peppered with family crests and quarterings,
authentic and imaginary.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bailey, Jr., looked pale and pretty sitting there, the English
sunlight filtered through stained glass; the glass also was thoroughly
peppered with insignia of the House of Bailey. Rich carving, rich
colouring, rich people!&mdash;what more could sticklers demand for
any exclusive sanctuary where only the best people received the
Body of Christ, and where God would meet nobody socially unknown.</p>

<p>Clive arrived from Italy after the funeral. The meeting between
him and his wife was faultless. He hung about the splendid country
place for a while, and spent much time inside the chapel, and
also outside, where he directed the planting of some American
evergreens, hemlock, spruce, and white pine.</p>

<p>But the aromatic perfume of familiar trees was subtly tearing
him to tatters; and there came a day when he could no longer endure
it.</p>

<p>His young wife was playing billiards with Lord Innisbrae, known
intimately as Cinders, such a languid and burnt out young man
was he, with his hair already white, and every lineament seared
with the fires of revels long since sunken into ashes.</p>

<p>He watched them for a while, his hands clenched where they rested
in his coat pockets, the lean muscles in his cheeks twitching
at intervals.</p>

<p>When Innisbrae took himself off, Winifred still lounged gracefully
along the billiard table taking shots with any ball that lay for
her. And Clive looked on, absent-eyed, the flat jaw muscles working
at intervals.</p>

<p>"Well?" she asked carelessly, laying her cue across the table.</p>

<p>"Nothing.... I think I'll clear out to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>She did not even inquire where he was going. For that matter
he did not know, except that there was one place he could not
go&mdash;home; the only place he cared to go.</p>

<p>He had already offered her divorce&mdash;thinking of Innisbrae, or
of some of the others. But she did not want it. It was, perhaps,
not in her to care enough for any man to go through that amount
of trouble. Besides, Their Majesties disapproved divorce. And
for this reason alone nothing would have induced her to figure
in proceedings certain to exclude her from one or two sets.</p>

<p>"Anything I can do for you before I leave?" he asked, dully.</p>

<p>It appeared that there was nothing he could do for his young
wife before he wandered on in the jolly autumn sunshine.</p>

<p>So the next morning he cleared out. Which proceeding languidly
interested Innisbrae that evening in the billiard-room.</p>

<p>That winter Clive got hurt while pig-sticking in Morocco, being
but an indifferent spear. During convalescence he read "Under
Two Flags," and approved the idea; but when he learned that the
Spahi cavalry was not recruiting Americans, and when, a month
later, he discovered how much romance did not exist in either
the First or Second Foreign Legions, he no longer desired dangers
incognito under the tri-colour or under the standard bearing the
open hand.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "During convalescence he read 'Under Two Flags'
and approved the idea."]</p>

<p>Some casual wanderer through the purlieus of science whom he
met in Brindisi, induced him to go to Sumatra where orchids and
ornithoptera are the game. But he acquired only a perfectly new
species of fever, which took six months to get over.</p>

<p>He convalesced at leisure all the way from Australia to Cape
Town; and would have been all right; but somebody shot at somebody
else one evening, and got Clive. So it was several months more
before he arrived in India, and the next year before he had enough
of China.</p>

<p>But Clive had seen many things in those two years and had learned
fairly well the lesson of his own unimportance in a world which
misses no man, neither king nor clown, after the dark curtain
falls and satiated humanity shuffles home to bed.</p>

<p>He saw a massacre&mdash;or the remains of it&mdash;where fifteen thousand
yellow men and one white priest lay dead. He saw Republican China,
40,000 strong, move out after the banditti, shouldering its modern
rifles, while its regimental music played "Rosie O'Grady" in quick
march time. He saw the railway between Hankow and Pekin swarming
with White Wolf's bloody pack, limping westward from the Honan-Anhui
border with dripping fangs. He peered into the stinking wells
of Honan where women were cutting their own throats. He witnessed
the levity of Lhasa priests and saw their grimy out-thrust hands
clutching for tips beside their prayer-wheels.</p>

<p>In India he gazed upon the degradation of woman and the unspeakable
bestiality of man till that vile and dusty hell had sickened him
to the soul.</p>

<p>Back into Europe he drifted; and instantly and everywhere appeared
the awful Yankee&mdash;shooting wells in Hungary, shooting craps in
Monaco, digging antiques in Greece, digging tunnels in Servia,&mdash;everywhere
the Yankee, drilling, bridging, constructing, exploring, pushing,
arguing, quarrelling, insisting, telegraphing, gambling, touring,
over-running older and better civilisations than his own crude
Empire where he has nothing to learn from anybody but the Almighty&mdash;and
then only when he condescends to ask for advice on Sunday.</p>

<p>And Clive, nevertheless, longed with a longing that made him
sick, for "God's country" where all that is worst and best on
earth still boils in the vast and seething cauldron of a continent
in the making. There bubbles the elemental broth, dregs, scum,
skimmings, residue, by-products, tailings, smoking corruption
above the slowly forming and incorruptible matrix in its depths
where lies imbedded, and ever growing, the Immam, the Hope of
the World&mdash;gem indestructible, pearl beyond price. Difficilia
quae pulchra.</p>

<p>And once, Clive had almost set out for home; and then, grimly,
turned away toward the southern continent of the hemisphere.</p>

<p>In Lima he heard of an expedition fitting out to search for the
lost Americans, Cromer and Page, and for the Hungarian Seljan.
And that same evening he met Captain Dane.</p>

<p>They looked at each other very carefully, and then shook hands.
Clive said: "If you want a handy man in camp, I'd like to go."</p>

<p>"Come on," said Dane, briefly.</p>

<p>Later, looking over together some maps in Dane's rooms, the big
blond soldier of fortune glanced up at the younger man, and saw
a lean, bronzed visage clamped mute by a lean bronzed jaw; but
he also saw two dark eyes fixed on him in the fierce silence of
unuttered inquiry. After a moment Dane said very quietly:</p>

<p>"Yes, she was well, and I think happy, when I left New York....
How long is it since you have heard from her?"</p>

<p>"Three years."</p>

<p>"Three years," mused Dane, gazing into space out of his slitted
eyes of arctic blue; "yes, that's some little time. Bailey....
She is well &mdash;I think I said that.... And very prosperous,
and greatly admired ... and happy &mdash;I believe."</p>

<p>The other waited.</p>

<p>Dane picked up a linen map, looked at it, fiddled with the corner.
Then, carelessly: "She is not married," he said.... "Here's the
Huallaga River as I located it four years ago. Seljan and O'Higgins
were making for it, I believe.... That red crayon circle over
there marks the habitat of the Uta fly. It's worse than the Tsetse.
If anybody is hunting death&mdash;<em>esta aquí</em>!... Here is the
Putumayo district. Hell lies up here, just above it.... Here's
Iquitos, and here lies Para, three thousand miles away.... Were
you going to say something?"</p>

<p>But if Clive had anything to say he seemed to find no words to
say it. And he only folded his arms on the table's edge and looked
down at the stained and crumpled map.</p>

<p>"It will take us about a year," remarked Dane.</p>

<p>Clive nodded, but his eye involuntarily sought the irregular
red circle where trouble of all sorts might be conveniently ended
by a perfectly respectable Act of God.</p>
