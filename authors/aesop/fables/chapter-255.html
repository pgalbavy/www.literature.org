EVERY MAN, according to an ancient legend, is born into the world
with two bags suspended from his neck   all bag in front full of
his neighbors' faults, and a large bag behind filled with his own
faults.  Hence it is that men are quick to see the faults of
others, and yet are often blind to their own failings.
