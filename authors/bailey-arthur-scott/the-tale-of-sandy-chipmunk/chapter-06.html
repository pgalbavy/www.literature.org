<p>There was so much said about Sandy Chipmunk's store of nuts and grain
that a few of the forest-people began to wish they had some of Sandy's
winter food for themselves. Uncle Sammy Coon, an old scamp who lived over
near the swamp, was one of those who began to plan to get Sandy's hoard
away from him.
</p>
<p>It was the grain that Uncle Sammy wanted. If he had spent in honest work
one-half the time he used in planning some trickery he would have been
much better off. But he hated work more than anything else in the world.
</p><p>Uncle Sammy Coon scarcely slept at all for several days, he was so busy
thinking about Sandy's grain. And since he always passed his nights in
wandering through the woods, he became almost ill.
</p><p>The trouble was, Uncle Sammy was far too big to crawl inside Sandy's
house. And he knew that the only way he could get at the grain was to
persuade somebody to bring it outside for him.
</p><p>At last he thought of a fine scheme. And as soon as it came into his head
he hobbled over to Sandy Chipmunk's home. I say <u>hobbled</u>, because Uncle
Sammy had a lame knee. He always claimed that he was injured in battle.
But almost every one knew that he hurt his knee one time when Farmer
Green caught him stealing a hen.
</p><p>When he reached the pasture Uncle Sammy found Sandy Chipmunk just
starting away to hunt for nuts.
</p><p>[Illustration: He Dropped the Grain in Front of Uncle Sammy]
</p><p>"Good morning!" the old fellow said. He spoke very pleasantly, though he
was so sleepy that he felt disagreeable enough. "I've come over to buy
something from your store."
</p><p>"My store!" Sandy Chipmunk exclaimed.
</p><p>"Yes!" said Uncle Sammy Coon. "I've heard you have a store here with a
heap of nuts and grain to sell."
</p><p>Now, it had never occurred to Sandy Chipmunk to <u>sell</u> any of the food he
had gathered for the winter. But when Uncle Sammy put the idea in his
head Sandy rather liked it.
</p><p>"I have a fine stock, to be sure," he said. "The nuts are specially good.
How many would you like to buy?"
</p><p>But Uncle Sammy Coon told him he didn't want any nuts.
</p><p>"I never eat them," he said. "It's grain that I want. And I'll buy as
much as you care to sell.... Bring a sample of it up here," he urged.
"I'd like to see if it's as good as people say."
</p><p>So Sandy Chipmunk darted into his house. And soon he appeared again with
his cheek-pouches crammed full of wheat kernels.
</p><p>"There!" he cried, when he had dropped the grain in front of Uncle Sammy.
"Just try a little of it! You'll agree with me that it's very fine."
</p><p>Uncle Sammy not only tried a little. He gobbled up every single kernel.
</p><p>"It seems to me to have a queer taste," he said. "Bring up some more!"
</p><p>And Sandy scurried down into his house again, to bob up in a few moments
with another sample of his grain.
</p><p>Once more Uncle Sammy ate it all.
</p><p>"It's a bit damp," he remarked, as he smacked his lips. "I hope it's not
moldy.... You'd better let me see another sample."
</p><p>Uncle Sammy declared the next heap of kernels to be altogether too dry.
And he kept ordering Sandy to fetch more for him to "taste," as he called
it. Some of the wheat he considered too ripe, and some too green. Some of
the kernels--so he said--were too little, and others too big. And finally
he even told Sandy Chipmunk that he was afraid Sandy was trying to sell
him <u>last year's</u> wheat.
</p><p>Now, Sandy knew that his wheat was fresh--all of it. So he went down and
brought up still another load.
</p><p>Uncle Sammy ate that more slowly, for by this time he had had a good
meal.
</p><p>"How do you like it?" Sandy asked him.
</p><p>"It's fair," Uncle Sammy replied. "But I believe it's <u>next year's</u>
wheat. And of course I wouldn't think of buying that kind.... I guess I
can't trade with you, after all." And he started to hobble away.
</p><p>When Sandy heard that, and saw the old fellow leaving, he began to scold.
</p><p>"Aren't you going to pay me for what you've eaten?" he asked.
</p><p>"What! Pay you for the samples?" Uncle Sammy asked. "I guess, young man,
you don't know much about keeping a store. Nobody ever pays for samples."
And he went away muttering to himself.
</p><p>Sandy Chipmunk felt very sad. Uncle Sammy had eaten half his winter's
supply of wheat.
</p><p>Sandy was angry, too. And for several days he was busier than ever,
trying to think of some way in which he could make Uncle Sammy Coon pay
him.
