<p>  It costs not much to be polite   And, furthermore, it's always
right.</p>

<p>Unc' Billy Possum and Jimmy Skunk, facing each other among the
Black Shadows close by a hole that led under Farmer Brown's henhouse,
chuckled as each thought of what had brought the other there.
It is queer how a like thought often brings people together. Unc'
Billy had the same longing in his stomach that Jimmy Skunk had,
and Jimmy Skunk had the same thing on his mind that Unc' Billy
had. More than this, it was the second time that day that they
had met. They had met in the morning in the Green Forest and now
they had met again among the Black Shadows of the evening at Farmer
Brown's henhouse. And it was all on account of eggs. Yes, Sir,
it was all on account of eggs.</p>

<p>"Are you just coming out, or are you just going in?" Jimmy inquired
politely.</p>

<p>"Ah was just going in, but Ah'll follow yo', Brer Skunk," replied
Unc' Billy just as politely.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind," returned Jimmy. "I wouldn't for a minute
think of going before you. I hope I know my manners better than
that."</p>

<p>"Yo' cert'nly are most polite, Brer Skunk. Yo' cert'nly are most
polite. Yo' are a credit to your bringing up, but politeness always
did run in your family. There is a saying that han'some is as
han'some does, and your politeness is as fine as yo' are han'some,
Brer Skunk. Ah'll just step one side and let yo' go first just
to show that Ah sho'ly does appreciate your friendship," said
Unc' Billy.</p>

<p>Jimmy Skunk chuckled. "I guess you've forgotten that other old
saying, 'Age before beauty,' Unc' Billy," said he. "So you go
first. You know you are older than I. I couldn't think of being
so impolite as to go first. I really couldn't think of such a
thing."</p>

<p>And so they argued and argued, each insisting in the most polite
way that the other should go first. If the truth were known, neither
of them was insisting out of politeness at all. No, Sir, politeness
had nothing to do with it Jimmy Skunk wanted Unc' Billy to go
first because Jimmy believes in safety first, and it had popped
into Jimmy's head that there might, there just might, happen to
be a trap inside that hole. If there was, he much preferred that
Unc' Billy should be the one to find it out. Yes, Sir, that is
why Jimmy Skunk was so very polite.</p>

<p>Unc' Billy wanted Jimmy to go first because he always feels safer
behind Jimmy than in front of him. He has great respect for that
little bag of scent that Jimmy carries, and he knows that when
Jimmy makes use of it, he always throws it in front and never
behind him. Jimmy seldom uses it, but sometimes he does if he
happens to be startled and thinks danger near. So Unc' Billy preferred
that Jimmy should go first. It wasn't politeness at all on the
part of Unc' Billy. In both cases it was a kind of selfishness.
Each was thinking of self.</p>

<p>How long they would have continued to argue and try to appear
polite if something hadn't happened, nobody knows. But something
did happen. There was a sudden loud sniff just around the corner
of the henhouse. It was from Bowser the Hound. Right then and
there Unc' Billy Possum and Jimmy Skunk forgot all about politeness,
and both tried to get through that hole at the same time. They
couldn't, because it wasn't big enough, but, they tried hard.
Bowser sniffed again, and this time Unc' Billy managed to squeeze
Jimmy aside and slip through. Jimmy was right at his heels.</p>
