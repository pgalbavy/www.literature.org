<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The fire was so cunningly laid that only on one side did it cast
a glow, and there the light was absorbed by a dark thicket of
laurels. It was built under an overhang of limestone so that the
smoke in the moonlight would be lost against the grey face of
the rock. But, though the moon was only two days past the full,
there was no sign of it, for the rain had come and the world was
muffled in it. That morning the Kentucky vales, as seen from the
ridge where the camp lay, had been like a furnace with the gold
and scarlet of autumn, and the air had been heavy with sweet October
smells. Then the wind had suddenly shifted, the sky had grown
leaden, and in a queer dank chill the advance-guard of winter
had appeared&mdash;that winter which to men with hundreds of pathless
miles between them and their homes was like a venture into an
uncharted continent.</p>

<p>One of the three hunters slipped from his buffalo robe and dived
into the laurel thicket to replenish the fire from the stock of
dry fuel. His figure revealed itself fitfully in the firelight,
a tall slim man with a curious lightness of movement like a cat's.
When he had done his work he snuggled down in his skins in the
glow, and his two companions shifted their positions to be near
him. The fire-tender was the leader of the little party The light
showed a face very dark with weather. He had the appearance of
wearing an untidy perruque, which was a tight-fitting skin-cap
with the pelt hanging behind. Below its fringe straggled a selvedge
of coarse black hair. But his eyes were blue and very bright,
and his eyebrows and lashes were flaxen, and the contrast of light
and dark had the effect of something peculiarly bold and masterful.
Of the others one was clearly his brother, heavier in build, but
with the same eyes and the same hard pointed chin and lean jaws.
The third man was shorter and broader, and wore a newer hunting
shirt than his fellows and a broad belt of wool and leather.</p>

<p>This last stretched his moccasins to the blaze and sent thin
rings of smoke from his lips into the steam made by the falling
rain.</p>

<p>He bitterly and compendiously cursed the weather. The little
party had some reason for ill-temper. There had been an accident
in the creek with the powder supply, and for the moment there
were only two charges left in the whole outfit. Hitherto they
had been living on ample supplies of meat, though they were on
short rations of journey-cake, for their stock of meal was low.
But that night they had supped poorly, for one of them had gone
out to perch a turkey, since powder could not be wasted, and had
not come back.</p>

<p>"I reckon we're the first as ever concluded to winter in Kaintuckee,"
he said between his puffs. "Howard and Salling went in in June,
I've heerd. And Finley? What about Finley, Dan'l?"</p>

<p>"He never stopped beyond the fall, though he was once near gripped
by the snow. But there ain't no reason why winter should be worse
on the O-hio than on the Yadkin. It's a good hunting time, and
snow'll keep the redskins quiet. What's bad for us is wuss for
them, says <em>I.... I </em>won't worry about winter nor redskins,
if old Jim Lovelle 'ud fetch up. It beats me whar the man has
got to."</p>

<p>"Wandered, maybe?" suggested the first speaker, whose name was
Neely.</p>

<p>"I reckon not. Ye'd as soon wander a painter. There ain't no
sech hunter as Jim ever came out of Virginny, no, nor out of Caroliny,
neither. It was him that fust telled me of Kaintuck'. 'The dark
and bloody land, the Shawnees calls it,' he says, speakin' in
his eddicated way, and dark and bloody it is, but that's man's
doing and not the Almighty's. The land flows with milk and honey,
he says, clear water and miles of clover and sweet grass, enough
to feed all the herds of Basham, and mighty forests with trees
that thick ye could cut a hole in their trunks and drive a waggon
through, and sugar-maples and plums and cherries like you won't
see in no set orchard, and black soil fair crying for crops. And
the game, Jim says, wasn't to be told about without ye wanted
to be called a liar&mdash;big black-nosed buffaloes that packed together
so the whole placed seemed moving, and elk and deer and bar past
counting.... Wal, neighbours, ye've seen it with your own eyes
and can jedge if Jim was a true prophet. I'm Moses, he used to
say, chosen to lead the Children of Israel into a promised land,
but I reckon I'll leave my old bones on some Pisgah-top on the
borders. He was a sad man, Jim, and didn't look for much comfort
this side Jordan.... I wish I know'd whar he'd gotten to."</p>

<p>Squire Boone, the speaker's brother, sniffed the air dolefully.
"It's weather that 'ud wander a good hunter."</p>

<p>"I tell ye, ye couldn't wander Jim," said his brother fiercely.
"He come into Kaintuckee alone in '52, and that was two years
before Finley. He was on the Ewslip all the winter of '58. He
was allus springing out of a bush when ye didn't expect him. When
we was fighting the Cherokees with Montgomery in '61 he turned
up as guide to the Scotsmen, and I reckon if they'd attended to
him there'ud be more of them alive this day. He was like a lone
wolf, old Jim, and preferred to hunt by hisself, but you never
knowed that he wouldn't come walking in and say 'Howdy' while
you was reckoning you was the fust white man to make that trace.
Wander Jim? Ye might as well speak of wandering a hakk."</p>

<p>"Maybe the Indians have got his sculp," said Neely.</p>

<p>"I reckon not," said Boone. "Leastways if they have, he must
ha' struck a new breed of redskin. Jim was better nor any redskin
in Kaintuck', and they knowed it. I told ye, neighbours, of our
doings before you come west through the Gap. The Shawnees cotched
me and Jim in a cane-brake, and hit our trace back to camp, so
that they cotched Finley too, and his three Yadkiners with him.
Likewise they took our hosses, and guns and traps and the furs
we had gotten from three months' hunting. Their chief made a speech
saying we had no right in Kaintuckee and if they cotched us again
our lives'ud pay for it. They'd ha' sculped us if it hadn't been
for Jim, but you could see they knew him, and was feared of him.
Wal, Finley reckoned the game was up, and started back with the
Yadkiners. Cooley and Joe Holden and Mooneyiye mind them, Squire!
But I was feeling kinder cross and wanted my property back, and
old Jim&mdash;why, he wasn't going to be worsted by no redskins. So
we trailed the Shawnees, us two, and come up with them one night
encamped beside a salt-lick. Jim got into their camp while I was
lying shivering in the cane, and blessed if he didn't snake back
four of our hosses and our three best Deckards. Tha's craft for
ye. By sunrise we was riding south on the Warriors' Path but the
hosses was plumb tired, and afore midday them pizonous Shawnees
had cotched up with us. I can tell ye, neighbours, the hair riz
on my head, for I expected nothing better than a bloody sculp
and six feet of earth.... But them redskins didn't hurt us. And
why, says ye? 'Cos they was scared of Jim. It seemed they had
a name for him in Shawnee which meant the 'old wolf that hunts
by night. They started out to take us way north of the Ohio to
their Scioto villages, whar they said we would be punished. Jim
telled me to keep up my heart, for he reckoned we wasn't going
north of no river. Then he started to make friends with them redskins,
and in two days he was the most popilar fellow in that company.
He was a quiet man and for general melancholious, but I guess
he could be amusing when he wanted to. You know the way an Indian
laughs grunts in his stomach and looks at the ground. Wal, Jim
had them grunting all day, and, seeing he could speak all their
tongues, he would talk serious too. Ye could see them savages
listening, like he was their own sachem."</p>

<p>Boone reached for another faggot and tossed it on the fire. The
downpour was slacking, but the wind had risen high and was wailing
in the sycamores.</p>

<p>"Consekince was," he went on, "for prisoners we wasn't proper
guarded. By the fourth day we was sleeping round the fire among
the Shawnees and marching with them as we pleased, though we wasn't
allowed to go near the hosses. On the seventh night we saw the
Ohio rolling in the hollow, and Jim says to me it was about time
to get quit of the redskins. It was a wet night with a wind, which
suited his plan, and about one in the morning, when Indians sleep
soundest, I was woke by Jim's hand pressing my wrist. Wal, I've
trailed a bit in my day, but I never did such mighty careful hunting
as that night. An inch at a time we crawled out of the circle&mdash;we
was lying well back on purpose&mdash;and got into the canes. I lay
there while Jim went back and fetched guns and powder. The Lord
knows how he done it without startling the hosses. Then we quit
like ghosts, and legged it for the hills. We was aiming for the
Gap, but it took us thirteen days to make it, travelling mostly
by night, and living on berries, for we durstn't risk a shot.
Then we made up with you. I reckon we didn't look too pretty when
ye see'd us first."</p>

<p>"Ye looked," said his brother soberly, "Like two scare-crows
that had took to walkin'. There was more naked skin than shirt
about you Dan'l. But Lovelle wasn't complaining, except about
his empty belly."</p>

<p>"He was harder nor me, though twenty years older. He did the
leading, too, for he had forgotten more about woodcraft than I
ever know'd...."</p>

<p>The man Neely, who was from Virginia, consumed tobacco as steadily
as a dry soil takes in water.</p>

<p>"I've heerd of this Lovelle," he said. "I've seed him too, I
guess. A long man with black eyebrows and hollow eyes like as
he was hungry. He used ter live near my folks in Palmer Country.
What was he looking for in those travels of his?"</p>

<p>"Hunting maybe," said Boone. "He was the skilfullest hunter,
I reckon, between the Potomac and the Cherokee. He brought in
mighty fine pelts, but he didn't seem to want money. Just so much
as would buy him powder and shot and food for the next venture,
ye understand.... He wasn't looking for land to settle on, neighber,
for one time he telled me he had had all the settling he wanted
in this world.... But he was looking for something else. He never
talked about it, but he'd sit often with his knees hunched up
and his eyes staring out at nothing like a bird's. I never know'd
who he was or whar he come from. You say it was Virginny?"</p>

<p>"Aye, Palmer County. I mind his old dad, who farmed a bit of
land by Nelson's Cross Roads, when he wasn't drunk in Nelson's
tavern. The boys used to follow him to laugh at his queer clothes,
and hear his fine London speech when he cursed us. By thunder,
he was the one to swear. Jim Lovelle used to clear us off with
a whip, and give the old man his arm into the shack. Jim too was
a queer one, but it didn't do to make free with him, unless ye
was lookin' for a broken head. They was come of high family, I've
heerd."</p>

<p>"Aye, Jim was a gentleman and no mistake," said Boone. "The way
he held his head and looked straight through the man that angered
him. I reckon it was that air of his and them glowering eyes that
made him powerful with the redskins. But he was mighty quiet always.
I've seen Cap'n Evan Shelby roaring at him like a bull and Jim
just staring back at him, as gentle as a girl, till the Cap'n
began to stutter and dried up. But, Lordy, he had a pluck in a
fight, for I've seen him with Montgomery.... He was eddicated
too, and could tell you things out of books. I've knowed him sit
up all night talking law with Mr. Robertson.... He was always
thinking. Queer thoughts they was sometimes."</p>

<p>"Whatten kind of thoughts, Dan'l?" his brother asked.</p>

<p>Boone rubbed his chin as if he found it hard to explain. "About
this country of Ameriky," he replied. "He reckoned it would soon
have to cut loose from England, and him knowing so much about
England I used ter believe him. He allowed there 'ud be bloody
battles before it happened, but he held that the country had grown
up and couldn't be kept much longer in short clothes. He had a
power of larning about things that happened to folks long ago
called Creeks and Rewmans that pinted that way, he said. But he
held that when we had fought our way quit of England, we was in
for a bigger and bloodier fight among ourselves. I mind his very
words. 'Dan'l,' he says, 'this is the biggest and best slice of
the world which we Americans has struck, and for fifty years or
more, maybe, we'll be that busy finding out what we've got that
we'll have no time to quarrel. But there's going to come a day,
if Ameriky s to be a great nation, when she'll have to sit down
and think and make up her mind about one or two things. It won't
be easy, for she won't have the eddication or patience to think
deep, and there'll be plenty selfish and short-sighted folk that
won't think at all. I reckon she'll have to set her house in order
with a hickory stick. But if she wins through that all right,
she'll be a country for our children to be proud of and happy
in.'"</p>

<p>"Children? Has he any belongings?" Squire Boone</p>

<p>Daniel looked puzzled. "I've heerd it said he had a wife, though
he never telled nie of her."</p>

<p>"I've seed her," Neely put in. "She was one of Jake Early's daughters
up to Walsing Springs. She didn't live no more than a couple of
years after they was wed. She left a gal behind her, a mighty
finelooking gal. They tell me she's married on young Abe Hanks,
I did hear that Abe was thinking of coming west, but them as told
me allowed that Abe hadn't got the right kinder wife for the Border.
Polly Hanker they called her, along of her being Polly Hanks,
and likewise wantin' more than other folks had to get along with.
See?"</p>

<p>This piece of news woke Daniel Boone to attention. "Tell me about
Jim's gal," he demanded.</p>

<p>"Pretty as a peach," said Neely "Small, not higher nor Abe's
shoulder, and as light on her feet as a deer. She had a softish
laughing look in her eyes that made the lads wild for her. But
she wasn't for them and I reckon she wasn't for Abe neither. She
was nicely eddicated, though she had jest had field-schooling
like the rest, for her dad used to read books and tell her about
'em. One time he took her to Richmond for the better part of a
winter, where she larned dancing and music. The neighbours allowed
that turned her head. Ye couldn't please her with clothes, for
she wouldn't look at the sun-bonnets and nettle-linen that other
gals wore. She must have a neat little bonnet and send to town
for pretty dresses.... The women couldn't abide her, for she had
a high way of looking at 'em and talking at 'em as if they was
jest black trash. But the men 'ud walk miles to see her on a Sunday....
I never could jest understand why she took Abe Hanks. 'Twasn't
for lack of better offers."</p>

<p>"I reckon that's women's ways," said Boone meditatively. "She
must ha' favoured Jim, though he wasn't partickler about his clothes.
Discontented, ye say she was?"</p>

<p>"Aye. Discontented. She was meant for a fine lady, I reckon.
I dunno what she wanted, but anyhow it was something that Abe
Hanks ain't likely to give her. I can't jest picture her in Kaintuck'!"</p>

<p>Squire Boone was asleep, and Daniel drew the flap of his buffalo
robe over his head and prepared to follow suit. His last act was
to sniff the air. "Please God the weather mends," he muttered.
"I've got to find old Jim."</p>

<p>Very early next morning there was a consultation. Lovelle had
not appeared and hunting was impossible on two shoots of powder.
It was arranged that two of them should keep camp that day by
the limestone cliff while Daniel Boone went in search of the missing
man, for it was possible that Jim Lovelle had gone to seek ammunition
from friendly Indians. If he did not turn up or if he returned
without powder, there would be nothing for it but to send a messenger
back through the Gap for supplies.</p>

<p>The dawn was blue and cloudless and the air had the freshness
of a second spring. The autumn colour glowed once more, only a
little tarnished; the gold was now copper, the scarlet and vermilion
were dulling to crimson. Boone took the road at the earliest light
and made for the place where the day before he had parted from
Lovelle. When alone he had the habit of talking to himself in
an undertone. "Jim was hunting down the west bank of that there
crick, and I heard a shot about noon beyond them big oaks, so
I reckon he'd left the water and gotten on the ridge." He picked
up the trail and followed it with difficulty, for the rain had
flattened out the prints. At one point he halted and considered.
"That's queer," he muttered. "Jim was running here. It wasn't
game, neither, for there's no sign of their tracks." He pointed
to the zig-zag of moccasin prints in a patch of gravel. "That's
the way a man sets his feet when he's in a hurry."</p>

<p>A little later he stood and sniffed, with his brows wrinkled.
He made an epic figure as he leaned forward, every sense strained,
every muscle alert, slim and shapely as a Greek&mdash;the eternal pathfinder.
Very gently he smelled the branches of a mulberry thicket.</p>

<p>"There's been an Indian here," he meditated. "I kinder smell
the grease on them twigs. In a hurry, too, or he wouldn't have
left his stink behind.... In war trim, I reckon." And he took
a tiny wisp of scarlet feather from a fork.</p>

<p>Like a hound he nosed about the ground till he found something.
"Here's his print;" he said "He was a-followin' Jim, for see!
he has his foot in Jim's track. I don't like it. I'm fear'd of
what's comin'."</p>

<p>Slowly and painfully he traced the footing, which led through
the thicket towards a long ridge running northward. In an open
grassy place he almost cried out. "The redskin and Jim was friends.
See, here's their prints side by side, going slow. What in thunder
was old Jim up to?"</p>

<p>The trail was plainer now, and led along the scarp of the ridge
to a little promontory which gave a great prospect over the flaming
forests and yellow glades. Boone found a crinkle of rock where
he flung himself down. "It's plain enough," he said. "They come
up here to spy. They were fear'd of something, and whatever it
was it was coming from the west. See, they kep' under the east
side of this ridge so as not to be seen, and they settled down
to spy whar they couldn't be obsarved from below. I reckon Jim
and the redskin had a pretty good eye for cover."</p>

<p>He examined every inch of the eyrie, sniffing like a pointer
dog. "I'm plumb puzzled about this redskin," he confessed. "Shawnee,
Cherokee, Chickasaw&mdash;it ain't likely Jim would have dealings with
'em. It might be one of them Far Indians."</p>

<p>It appeared as if Lovelle had spent most of the previous afternoon
on the ridge, for he found the remains of his night's fire half
way down the north side in a hollow thatched with vines. It was
now about three o'clock. Boone, stepping delicately, examined
the ashes, and then sat himself on the ground and brooded.</p>

<p>When at last he lifted his eyes his face was perplexed.</p>

<p>"I can't make it out nohow. Jim and this Indian was good friends.
They were feelin' pretty safe, for they made a mighty careless
fire and didn't stop to tidy it up. But likewise they was restless,
for they started out long before morning.... I read it this way.
Jim met a redskin that he knowed before and thought he could trust
anyhow, and he's gone off with him seeking powder. It'd be like
Jim to dash off alone and play his hand like that. He figured
he'd come back to us with what we needed and that we'd have the
sense to wait for him. I guess that's right. But I'm uneasy about
the redskin. If he's from north of the river, there's a Mingo
camp somewhere about and they've gone there.... I never had much
notion of Seneca Indians, and I reckon Jim's took a big risk."</p>

<p>All evening he followed the trail, which crossed the low hills
into the corn-brakes and woodlands of a broader valley. Presently
he saw that he had been right, and that Lovelle and the Indian
had begun their journey in the night, for the prints showed like
those of travellers in darkness. Before sunset Boone grew very
anxious. He found traces converging, till a clear path was worn
in the grass like a regulation war trail. It was not one of the
known trails, so it had been made for a purpose; he found on tree
trunks the tiny blazons of the scouts who had been sent ahead
to survey it. It was a war party of Mingos, or whoever they might
be, and he did not like it. He was puzzled to know what purchase
Jim could have with those outland folk.... And yet he had been
on friendly terms with the scout he had picked up.... Another
fact disturbed him. Lovelle's print had been clear enough till
the other Indians joined him. The light was bad, but now that
print seemed to have disappeared. It might be due to the general
thronging of marks in the trail, but it might be that Jim was
a prisoner, trussed and helpless.</p>

<p>He supped off cold jerked bear's meat and slept two hours in
the canes, waiting on the moonrise. He had bad dreams, for he
seemed to hear drums beating the eerie tattoo which he remembered
long ago in Border raids. He woke in a sweat, and took the road
again in the moonlight. It was not hard to follow, and it seemed
to be making north for the Ohio. Dawn came on him in a grassy
bottom, beyond which lay low hills that he knew alone separated
him from the great river. Once in the Indian Moon of Blossom he
had been thus far, and had gloried in the riches of the place,
where a man walked knee deep in honeyed clover. "The dark and
bloody land!"  He remembered how he had repeated the name to himself,
and had concluded that Lovelle had been right and that it was
none of the Almighty's giving. Now in the sharp autumn morning
he felt its justice. A cloud had come over his cheerful soul.
"If only I knowed about Jim," he muttered "I wonder if I'll ever
clap eyes onr his old face again." Never before had he known such
acute anxiety. Pioneers are wont to trust each other and in their
wild risks assume that the odd chance is on their side. But now
black forebodings possessed him, born not of reasoning but of
instinct. His comrade somewhere just ahead of him was in deadly
peril.</p>

<p>And then came the drums.</p>

<p>The sound broke into the still dawn with a harsh challenge. They
were war drums, beaten as he remembered them in Montgomery's campaign.
He quickened his steady hunter's lope into a run, and left the
trail for the thickets of the hill-side. The camp was less than
a mile off and he was taking no chances.</p>

<p>As he climbed the hill the drums grew louder, till it seemed
that the whole world rocked with their noise. He told himself
feverishly that there was nothing to fear; Jim was with friends,
who had been south of the river on their own business and would
give him the powder he wanted. Presently they would be returning
to the camp together, and in the months to come he and Jim would
make that broad road through the Gap, at the end of which would
spring up smiling farmsteads and townships of their own naming.
He told himself these things, but he knew that he lied.</p>

<p>At last, flat on the earth, he peered through the vines on the
north edge of the ridge. Below him, half a mile off, rolled the
Ohio, a little swollen by the rains There was a broad ford, and
the waters had spilled out over the fringe of sand. Just under
him, between the bluff and the river, lay the Mingo camp, every
detail of it plain in the crisp weather.</p>

<p>In the heart of it a figure stood bound to a stake, and a smoky
fire burned at its feet.... There was no mistaking that figure.</p>

<p>Boone bit the grass in a passion of fury. His first impulse was
to rush madly into the savages' camp and avenge his friend. He
had half risen to his feet when his reason told him it was folly.
He had no weapon but axe and knife, and would only add another
scalp to their triumph. His Deckard was slung on his back, but
he had no powder. Oh, to be able to send a bullet through Jim's
head to cut short his torment! In all his life he had never known
such mental anguish, waiting there an impotent witness of the
agony of his friend. The blood trickled from his bitten lips and
film was over his eyes.... Lovelle was dying for him and the others.
He saw it all with bitter clearness. Jim had been inveigled to
the Mingo camp taking risks as he always did, and there been ordered
to reveal the whereabouts of the hunting party. He had refused,
and endured the ordeal... Memories of their long comradeship rushed
through Boone's mind and set him weeping in a fury of affection.
There was never such a man as old Jim, so trusty and wise and
kind, and now that great soul was being tortured out of that stalwart
body and he could only look on like a baby and cry.</p>

<p>As he gazed, it became plain that the man at the stake was dead.
His head had fallen on his chest, and the Indians were cutting
the green withies that bound him. Boone looked to see them take
his scalp, and so wild was his rage that his knees were already
bending for the onslaught which should be the death of him and
haply of one or two of the murderers.</p>

<p>But no knife was raised. The Indians seemed to consult together,
and one of them gave an order. Deerskins were brought and the
body was carefully wrapped in them and laid on a litter of branches.
Their handling of it seemed almost reverent. The camp was moving,
the horses were saddled, and presently the whole band began to
file off towards the forest. The sight held Boone motionless.
His fury had gone and only wonder and awe remained. As they passed
the dead, each Indian raised his axe in salute&mdash;the salute to
a great chief. The next minute they were splashing through the
ford.</p>

<p>An hour later, when the invaders had disappeared on the northern
levels, Boone slipped down from the bluff to the camping place.
He stood still a long time by his friend, taking off his deerskin
cap, so that his long black hair was blown over his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Jim, boy," he said softly. "I reckon you was the general of
us all. The likes of you won't come again. I'd like ye to have
Christian burial."</p>

<p>With his knife he hollowed a grave, where he placed the body,
still wrapped in its deerskins. He noted on a finger of one hand
a gold ring, a queer possession for a backwoodsman. This he took
off and dropped into the pouch which hung round his neck. "I reckon
it'd better go to Mis' Hanks. Jim's gal 'ud valley it mor'n a
wanderin' coyote."</p>

<p>When he had filled in the earth he knelt among the grasses and
repeated the Lord's Prayer as well as he could remember it. Then
he stood up and rubbed with his hard brown knuckles the dimness
from his eyes.</p>

<p>"Ye was allus lookin' for something, Jim," he said. "I guess
ye've found it now. Good luck to ye, old comrade."</p>
