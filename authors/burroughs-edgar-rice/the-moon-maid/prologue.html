<p>I met him in the Blue Room of the Transoceanic Liner <u>Harding</u> the
night of Mars Day—June 10, 1967. I had been wandering about the city
for several hours prior to the sailing of the flier watching the
celebration, dropping in at various places that I might see as much
as possible of scenes that doubtless will never again be paralleled—a
world gone mad with joy. There was only one vacant chair in the Blue
Room and that at a small table at which he was already seated alone.
I asked his permission and he graciously invited me to join him,
rising as he did so, his face lighting with a smile that compelled my
liking from the first.
</p><p>I had thought that Victory Day, which we had celebrated two months
before, could never be eclipsed in point of mad national enthusiasm,
but the announcement that had been made this day appeared to have had
even a greater effect upon the minds and imaginations of the people.
</p><p>The more than half-century of war that had continued almost
uninterruptedly since 1914 had at last terminated in the absolute
domination of the Anglo-Saxon race over all the other races of the
World, and practically for the first time since the activities of the
human race were preserved for posterity in any enduring form no
civilized, or even semicivilized, nation maintained a battle line
upon any portion of the globe. War was at an end—definitely and
forever. Arms and ammunition were being dumped into the five oceans;
the vast armadas of the air were being scrapped or converted into
carriers for purposes of peace and commerce.
</p><p>The peoples of all nations had celebrated—victors and vanquished
alike—for they were tired of war. At least they thought that they
were tired of war; but were they? What else did they know? Only the
oldest of men could recall even a semblance of world peace, the
others knew nothing but war. Men had been born and lived their lives
and died with their grandchildren clustered about them—all with the
alarms of war ringing constantly in their ears. Perchance the little
area of their activities was never actually encroached upon by the
iron-shod hoof of battle; but always somewhere war endured, now
receding like the salt tide only to return again; until there arose
that great tidal wave of human emotion in 1959 that swept the entire
world for eight bloody years, and receding, left peace upon a spent
and devastated world.
</p><p>Two months had passed—two months during which the world appeared to
stand still, to mark time, to hold its breath. What now? We have
peace, but what shall we do with it? The leaders of thought and of
action are trained for but one condition—war. The reaction brought
despondency—our nerves, accustomed to the constant stimulus of
excitement, cried out against the monotony of peace, and yet no one
wanted war again. We did not know what we wanted.
</p><p>And then came the announcement that I think saved a world from
madness, for it directed our minds along a new line to the
contemplation of a fact far more engrossing than prosaic wars and
equally as stimulating to the imagination and the nerves—intelligible
communication had at last been established with Mars!
</p><p>Generations of wars had done their part to stimulate scientific
research to the end that we might kill one another more
expeditiously, that we might transport our youth more quickly to
their shallow graves in alien soil, that we might transmit more
secretly and with greater celerity our orders to slay our fellow men.
And always, generation after generation, there had been those few who
could detach their minds from the contemplation of massacre and
looking forward to a happier era concentrate their talents and their
energies upon the utilization of scientific achievement for the
betterment of mankind and the rebuilding of civilization.
</p><p>Among these was that much ridiculed but devoted coterie who had clung
tenaciously to the idea that communication could be established with
Mars. The hope that had been growing for a hundred years had never
been permitted to die, but had been transmitted from teacher to pupil
with ever-growing enthusiasm, while the people scoffed as, a hundred
years before, we are told, they scoffed at the experimenters with
<u>flying machines</u>, as they chose to call them.
</p><p>About 1940 had come the first reward of long years of toil and hope,
following the perfection of an instrument which accurately indicated
the direction and distance of the focus of any radio-activity with
which it might be attuned. For several years prior to this all the
more highly sensitive receiving instruments had recorded a series of
three dots and three dashes which began at precise intervals of
twenty-four hours and thirty-seven minutes and continued for
approximately fifteen minutes. The new instrument indicated
conclusively that these signals, if they were signals, originated
always at the same distance from the Earth and in the same direction
as the point in the universe occupied by the planet Mars.
</p><p>It was five years later before a sending apparatus was evolved that
bade fair to transmit its waves from Earth to Mars. At first their
own message was repeated—three dots and three dashes. Although the
usual interval of time had not elapsed since we had received their
daily signal, ours was immediately answered. Then we sent a message
consisting of five dots and two dashes, alternating. Immediately they
replied with five dots and two dashes and we knew beyond peradventure
of a doubt that we were in communication with the Red Planet, but it
required twenty-two years of unremitting effort, with the most
brilliant intellects of two world concentrated upon it, to evolve and
perfect an intelligent system of inter-communication between the two
planets.
</p><p>Today, this tenth of June, 1967, there was published broadcast to the
world the first message from Mars. It was dated Helium, Barsoom, and
merely extended greetings to a sister world and wished us well. But
it was the beginning.
</p><p>The Blue Room of <u>The Harding</u> was, I presume, but typical of every
other gathering place in the civilized world. Men and women were
eating, drinking, laughing, singing and talking. The flier was racing
through the air at an altitude of little over a thousand feet. Its
engines, motivated wirelessly from power plants thousands of miles
distant, drove it noiselessly and swiftly along its overnight pathway
between Chicago and Paris.
</p><p>I had of course crossed many times, but this instance was unique
because of the epoch-making occasion which the passengers were
celebrating, and so I sat at the table longer than usual, watching my
fellow diners, with, I imagine, a slightly indulgent smile upon my
lips, since—I mention it in no spirit of egotism—it had been my high
privilege to assist in the consummation of a hundred years of effort
that had borne fruit that day. I looked around at my fellow diners
and then back to my table companion.
</p><p>He was a fine looking chap, lean and bronzed—one need not have noted
the Air Corps overseas service uniform, the Admiral’s stars and
anchors or the wound stripes to have guessed that he was a fighting
man; he looked it, every inch of him, and there were a full seventytwo 
inches.
</p><p>We talked a little—about the great victory and the message from Mars,
of course, and though he often smiled I noticed an occasional shadow
of sadness in his eyes and once, after a particularly mad outburst of
pandemonium on the part of the celebrators, he shook his head,
remarking: “Poor devils!” and then: “It is just as well—let them
enjoy life while they may. I envy them their ignorance.”
</p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked.
</p><p>He flushed a little and then smiled. “Was I speaking aloud?” he
asked.
</p><p>I repeated what he had said and he looked steadily at me for a long
minute before he spoke again. “Oh, what’s the use!” he exclaimed,
almost petulantly; “you wouldn’t understand and of course you
wouldn’t believe. I do not understand it myself; but I have to
believe because I know—I know from personal observation. God! if you
could have seen what I have seen.”
</p><p>“Tell me,” I begged; but he shook his head dubiously.
</p><p>“Do you realize that there is no such thing as Time?” he asked
suddenly—“That man has invented Time to suit the limitations of his
finite mind, just as he has named another thing, that he can neither
explain nor understand, Space?”
</p><p>“I have heard of such a theory,” I replied; “but I neither believe
nor disbelieve—I simply do not know.”
</p><p>I thought I had him started and so I waited as I have read in fiction
stories is the proper way to entice a strange narrative from its
possessor. He was looking beyond me and I imagined that the
expression of his eyes denoted that he was witnessing again the
thrilling scenes of the past. I must have been wrong, though—in fact
I was quite sure of it when he next spoke.
</p><p>“If that girl isn’t careful,” he said, “the thing will upset and give
her a nasty fall—she is much too near the edge.”
</p><p>I turned to see a richly dressed and much dishevelled young lady
busily dancing on a table-top while her friends and the surrounding
diners cheered her lustily.
</p><p>My companion arose. “I have enjoyed your company immensely,” he said,
“and I hope to meet you again. I am going to look for a place to
sleep now—they could not give me a stateroom—I don’t seem to be able
to get enough sleep since they sent me back.” He smiled.
</p><p>“Miss the gas shells and radio bombs, I suppose,” I remarked.
</p><p>“Yes,” he replied, “just as a convalescent misses smallpox.”
</p><p>“I have a room with two beds,” I said. “At the last minute my
secretary was taken ill. I’ll be glad to have you share the room with
me.”
</p><p>He thanked me and accepted my hospitality for the night—the following
morning we would be in Paris.
</p><p>As we wound our way among the tables filled with laughing, joyous
diners, my companion paused beside that at which sat the young woman
who had previously attracted his attention. Their eyes met and into
hers came a look of puzzlement and half-recognition. He smiled
frankly in her face, nodded and passed on.
</p><p>“You know her, then?” I asked.
</p><p>“I shall—in two hundred years,” was his enigmatical reply.
</p><p>We found my room, and there we had a bottle of wine and some little
cakes and a quiet smoke and became much better acquainted.
</p><p>It was he who first reverted to the subject of our conversation in
the Blue Room.
</p><p>“I am going to tell you,” he said, “what I have never told another;
but on the condition that if you retell it you are not to use my
name. I have several years of this life ahead of me and I do not care
to be pointed out as a lunatic. First let me say that I do not try to
explain anything, except that I do not believe prevision to be a
proper explanation. I have actually <u>lived</u> the experiences I shall
tell you of, and that girl we saw dancing on the table tonight lived
them with me; but she does not know it. If you care to, you can keep
in mind the theory that there is no such thing as Time—just keep it
in mind—you cannot understand it, or at least I cannot. Here goes.”
