I was twenty-seven when I met Margaret again, and the intervening 
five years had been years of vigorous activity for me, if not of 
very remarkable growth.  When I saw her again, I could count myself 
a grown man.  I think, indeed, I counted myself more completely 
grown than I was.  At any rate, by all ordinary standards, I had 
"got on" very well, and my ideas, if they had not changed very 
greatly, had become much more definite and my ambitions clearer and 
bolder.
<P>
I had long since abandoned my fellowship and come to London.  I had 
published two books that had been talked about, written several 
articles, and established a regular relationship with the WEEKLY 
REVIEW and the EVENING GAZETTE.  I was a member of the Eighty Club 
and learning to adapt the style of the Cambridge Union to larger 
uses.  The London world had opened out to me very readily.  I had 
developed a pleasant variety of social connections.  I had made the 
acquaintance of Mr. Evesham, who had been attracted by my NEW RULER, 
and who talked about it and me, and so did a very great deal to make 
a way for me into the company of prominent and amusing people.  I 
dined out quite frequently.  The glitter and interest of good London 
dinner parties became a common experience.  I liked the sort of 
conversation one got at them extremely, the little glow of duologues 
burning up into more general discussions, the closing-in of the men 
after the going of the women, the sage, substantial masculine 
gossiping, the later resumption of effective talk with some pleasant 
woman, graciously at her best.  I had a wide range of houses; 
Cambridge had linked me to one or two correlated sets of artistic 
and literary people, and my books and Mr. Evesham and opened to me 
the big vague world of "society."  I wasn't aggressive nor 
particularly snobbish nor troublesome, sometimes I talked well, and 
if I had nothing interesting to say I said as little as possible, 
and I had a youthful gravity of manner that was liked by hostesses.  
And the other side of my nature that first flared through the cover 
of restraints at Locarno, that too had had opportunity to develop 
along the line London renders practicable.  I had had my experiences 
and secrets and adventures among that fringe of ill-mated or erratic 
or discredited women the London world possesses.  The thing had long 
ago ceased to be a matter of magic or mystery, and had become a 
question of appetites and excitement, and among other things the 
excitement of not being found out.
<P>
I write rather doubtfully of my growing during this period.  Indeed 
I find it hard to judge whether I can say that I grew at all in any 
real sense of the word, between three and twenty and twenty-seven.  
It seems to me now to have been rather a phase of realisation and 
clarification.  All the broad lines of my thought were laid down, I 
am sure, by the date of my Locarno adventure, but in those five 
years I discussed things over and over again with myself and others, 
filled out with concrete fact forms I had at first apprehended 
sketchily and conversationally, measured my powers against my ideals 
and the forces in the world about me.  It was evident that many men 
no better than myself and with no greater advantages than mine had 
raised themselves to influential and even decisive positions in the 
worlds of politics and thought.  I was gathering the confidence and 
knowledge necessary to attack the world in the large manner; I found 
I could write, and that people would let me write if I chose, as one 
having authority and not as the scribes.  Socially and politically 
and intellectually I knew myself for an honest man, and that quite 
without any deliberation on my part this showed and made things easy 
for me.  People trusted my good faith from the beginning--for all 
that I came from nowhere and had no better position than any 
adventurer.
<P>
But the growth process was arrested, I was nothing bigger at twenty-
seven than at twenty-two, however much saner and stronger, and any 
one looking closely into my mind during that period might well have 
imagined growth finished altogether.  It is particularly evident to 
me now that I came no nearer to any understanding of women during 
that time.  That Locarno affair was infinitely more to me than I had 
supposed.  It ended something--nipped something in the bud perhaps--
took me at a stride from a vague, fine, ignorant, closed world of 
emotion to intrigue and a perfectly definite and limited sensuality.  
It ended my youth, and for a time it prevented my manhood.  I had 
never yet even peeped at the sweetest, profoundest thing in the 
world, the heart and meaning of a girl, or dreamt with any quality 
of reality of a wife or any such thing as a friend among womanhood.  
My vague anticipation of such things in life had vanished 
altogether.  I turned away from their possibility.  It seemed to me 
I knew what had to be known about womankind.  I wanted to work hard, 
to get on to a position in which I could develop and forward my 
constructive projects.  Women, I thought, had nothing to do with 
that.  It seemed clear I could not marry for some years; I was 
attractive to certain types of women, I had vanity enough to give me 
an agreeable confidence in love-making, and I went about seeking a 
convenient mistress quite deliberately, some one who should serve my 
purpose and say in the end, like that kindly first mistress of mine, 
"I've done you no harm," and so release me.  It seemed the only wise 
way of disposing of urgencies that might otherwise entangle and 
wreck the career I was intent upon.
<P>
I don't apologise for, or defend my mental and moral phases.  So it 
was I appraised life and prepared to take it, and so it is a 
thousand ambitious men see it to-day. . . .
<P>
For the rest these five years were a period of definition.  My 
political conceptions were perfectly plain and honest.  I had one 
constant desire ruling my thoughts.  I meant to leave England and 
the empire better ordered than I found it, to organise and 
discipline, to build up a constructive and controlling State out of 
my world's confusions.  We had, I saw, to suffuse education with 
public intention, to develop a new better-living generation with a 
collectivist habit of thought, to link now chaotic activities in 
every human affair, and particularly to catch that escaped, world-
making, world-ruining, dangerous thing, industrial and financial 
enterprise, and bring it back to the service of the general good.  I 
had then the precise image that still serves me as a symbol for all 
I wish to bring about, the image of an engineer building a lock in a 
swelling torrent--with water pressure as his only source of power.  
My thoughts and acts were habitually turned to that enterprise; it 
gave shape and direction to all my life.  The problem that most 
engaged my mind during those years was the practical and personal 
problem of just where to apply myself to serve this almost innate 
purpose.  How was I, a child of this confusion, struggling upward 
through the confusion, to take hold of things?   Somewhere between 
politics and literature my grip must needs be found, but where?  
Always I seem to have been looking for that in those opening years, 
and disregarding everything else to discover it.

The Baileys, under whose auspices I met Margaret again, were in the 
sharpest contrast with the narrow industrialism of the Staffordshire 
world.  They were indeed at the other extreme of the scale, two 
active self-centred people, excessively devoted to the public 
service.  It was natural I should gravitate to them, for they seemed 
to stand for the maturer, more disciplined, better informed 
expression of all I was then urgent to attempt to do.  The bulk of 
their friends were politicians or public officials, they described 
themselves as publicists--a vague yet sufficiently significant term.  
They lived and worked in a hard little house in Chambers Street, 
Westminster, and made a centre for quite an astonishing amount of 
political and social activity.
<P>
Willersley took me there one evening.  The place was almost 
pretentiously matter-of-fact and unassuming.  The narrow passage-
hall, papered with some ancient yellowish paper, grained to imitate 
wood, was choked with hats and cloaks and an occasional feminine 
wrap.  Motioned rather than announced by a tall Scotch servant 
woman, the only domestic I ever remember seeing there, we made our 
way up a narrow staircase past the open door of a small study packed 
with blue-books, to discover Altiora Bailey receiving before the 
fireplace in her drawing-room.   She was a tall commanding figure, 
splendid but a little untidy in black silk and red beads, with dark 
eyes that had no depths, with a clear hard voice that had an almost 
visible prominence, aquiline features and straight black hair that 
was apt to get astray, that was now astray like the head feathers of 
an eagle in a gale.  She stood with her hands behind her back, and 
talked in a high tenor of a projected Town Planning Bill with Blupp, 
who was practically in those days the secretary of the local 
Government Board.  A very short broad man with thick ears and fat 
white hands writhing intertwined behind him, stood with his back to 
us, eager to bark interruptions into Altiora's discourse.  A slender 
girl in pale blue, manifestly a young political wife, stood with one 
foot on the fender listening with an expression of entirely puzzled 
propitiation.  A tall sandy-bearded bishop with the expression of a 
man in a trance completed this central group.
<P>
The room was one of those long apartments once divided by folding 
doors, and reaching from back to front, that are common upon the 
first floors of London houses.  Its walls were hung with two or 
three indifferent water colours, there was scarcely any furniture 
but a sofa or so and a chair, and the floor, severely carpeted with 
matting, was crowded with a curious medley of people, men 
predominating.  Several were in evening dress, but most had the 
morning garb of the politician; the women were either severely 
rational or radiantly magnificent.  Willersley pointed out to me the 
wife of the Secretary of State for War, and I recognised the Duchess 
of Clynes, who at that time cultivated intellectuality.  I looked 
round, identifying a face here or there, and stepping back trod on 
some one's toe, and turned to find it belonged to the Right Hon. G. 
B. Mottisham, dear to the PUNCH caricaturists.  He received my 
apology with that intentional charm that is one of his most 
delightful traits, and resumed his discussion.  Beside him was 
Esmeer of Trinity, whom I had not seen since my Cambridge days. . . .
<P>
Willersley found an ex-member of the School Board for whom he had 
affinities, and left me to exchange experiences and comments upon 
the company with Esmeer.  Esmeer was still a don; but he was 
nibbling, he said, at certain negotiations with the TIMES that might 
bring him down to London.  He wanted to come to London.  "We peep at 
things from Cambridge," he said.
<P>
"This sort of thing," I said, "makes London necessary.  It's the 
oddest gathering."
<P>
"Every one comes here," said Esmeer.  "Mostly we hate them like 
poison--jealousy--and little irritations--Altiora can be a horror at 
times--but we HAVE to come."
<P>
"Things are being done?"
<P>
"Oh!--no doubt of it.  It's one of the parts of the British 
machinery--that doesn't show. . . .  But nobody else could do it.
<P>
"Two people," said Esmeer, "who've planned to be a power--in an 
original way.  And by Jove! they've done it!"
<P>
I did not for some time pick out Oscar Bailey, and then Esmeer 
showed him to me in elaborately confidential talk in a corner with a 
distinguished-looking stranger wearing a ribbon.  Oscar had none of 
the fine appearance of his wife; he was a short sturdy figure with a 
rounded protruding abdomen and a curious broad, flattened, clean-
shaven face that seemed nearly all forehead.  He was of Anglo-
Hungarian extraction, and I have always fancied something Mongolian 
in his type.  He peered up with reddish swollen-looking eyes over 
gilt-edged glasses that were divided horizontally into portions of 
different refractive power, and he talking in an ingratiating 
undertone, with busy thin lips, an eager lisp and nervous movements 
of the hand.
<P>
People say that thirty years before at Oxford he was almost exactly 
the same eager, clever little man he was when I first met him.  He 
had come up to Balliol bristling with extraordinary degrees and 
prizes capturned in provincial and Irish and Scotch universities--
and had made a name for himself as the most formidable dealer in 
exact fact the rhetoricians of the Union had ever had to encounter.  
From Oxford he had gone on to a position in the Higher Division of 
the Civil Service, I think in the War Office, and had speedily made 
a place for himself as a political journalist.  He was a 
particularly neat controversialist, and very full of political and 
sociological ideas.  He had a quite astounding memory for facts and 
a mastery of detailed analysis, and the time afforded scope for 
these gifts.  The later eighties were full of politico-social 
discussion, and he became a prominent name upon the contents list of 
the NINETEENTH CENTURY, the FORTNIGHTLY and CONTEMPORARY chiefly as 
a half sympathetic but frequently very damaging critic of the 
socialism of that period.  He won the immense respect of every one 
specially interested in social and political questions, he soon 
achieved the limited distinction that is awarded such capacity, and 
at that I think he would have remained for the rest of his life if 
he had not encountered Altiora.
<P>
But Altiora Macvitie was an altogether exceptional woman, an 
extraordinary mixture of qualities, the one woman in the world who 
could make something more out of Bailey than that.  She had much of 
the vigour and handsomeness of a slender impudent young man, and an 
unscrupulousness altogether feminine.  She was one of those women 
who are waiting in--what is the word?--muliebrity.  She had courage 
and initiative and a philosophical way of handling questions, and 
she could be bored by regular work like a man.  She was entirely 
unfitted for her sex's sphere.  She was neither uncertain, coy nor 
hard to please, and altogether too stimulating and aggressive for 
any gentleman's hours of ease.  Her cookery would have been about as 
sketchy as her handwriting, which was generally quite illegible, and 
she would have made, I feel sure, a shocking bad nurse.  Yet you 
mustn't imagine she was an inelegant or unbeautiful woman, and she 
is inconceivable to me in high collars or any sort of masculine 
garment.  But her soul was bony, and at the base of her was a vanity 
gaunt and greedy!  When she wasn't in a state of personal untidiness 
that was partly a protest against the waste of hours exacted by the 
toilet and partly a natural disinclination, she had a gypsy 
splendour of black and red and silver all her own.  And somewhen in 
the early nineties she met and married Bailey.
<P>
I know very little about her early years.  She was the only daughter 
of Sir Deighton Macvitie, who applied the iodoform process to 
cotton, and only his subsequent unfortunate attempts to become a 
Cotton King prevented her being a very rich woman.  As it was she 
had a tolerable independence.  She came into prominence as one of 
the more able of the little shoal of young women who were led into 
politico-philanthropic activities by the influence of the earlier 
novels of Mrs. Humphry Ward--the Marcella crop.   She went 
"slumming" with distinguished vigour, which was quite usual in those 
days--and returned from her experiences as an amateur flower girl 
with clear and original views about the problem--which is and always 
had been unusual.  She had not married, I suppose because her 
standards were high, and men are cowards and with an instinctive 
appetite for muliebrity.  She had kept house for her father by 
speaking occasionally to the housekeeper, butler and cook her mother 
had left her, and gathering the most interesting dinner parties she 
could, and had married off four orphan nieces in a harsh and 
successful manner.  After her father's smash and death she came out 
as a writer upon social questions and a scathing critic of the 
Charity Organisation Society, and she was three and thirty and a 
little at loose ends when she met Oscar Bailey, so to speak, in the 
CONTEMPORARY REVIEW.  The lurking woman in her nature was fascinated 
by the ease and precision with which the little man rolled over all 
sorts of important and authoritative people, she was the first to 
discover a sort of imaginative bigness in his still growing mind, 
the forehead perhaps carried him off physically, and she took 
occasion to meet and subjugate him, and, so soon as he had 
sufficiently recovered from his abject humility and a certain panic 
at her attentions, marry him.
<P>
This had opened a new phase in the lives of Bailey and herself.  The 
two supplemented each other to an extraordinary extent.  Their 
subsequent career was, I think, almost entirely her invention.  She 
was aggressive, imaginative, and had a great capacity for ideas, 
while he was almost destitute of initiative, and could do nothing 
with ideas except remember and discuss them.  She was, if not exact, 
at least indolent, with a strong disposition to save energy by 
sketching--even her handwriting showed that--while he was 
inexhaustibly industrious with a relentless invariable caligraphy 
that grew larger and clearer as the years passed by.  She had a 
considerable power of charming; she could be just as nice to people--
and incidentally just as nasty--as she wanted to be.  He was always 
just the same, a little confidential and SOTTO VOCE, artlessly rude 
and egoistic in an undignified way.  She had considerable social 
experience, good social connections, and considerable social 
ambition, while he had none of these things.  She saw in a flash her 
opportunity to redeem his defects, use his powers, and do large, 
novel, rather startling things.  She ran him.  Her marriage, which 
shocked her friends and relations beyond measure--for a time they 
would only speak of Bailey as "that gnome"--was a stroke of genius, 
and forthwith they proceeded to make themselves the most formidable 
and distinguished couple conceivable.  P. B. P., she boasted, was 
engraved inside their wedding rings, Pro Bono Publico, and she meant 
it to be no idle threat.  She had discovered very early that the 
last thing influential people will do is to work.  Everything in 
their lives tends to make them dependent upon a supply of 
confidently administered detail.  Their business is with the window 
and not the stock behind, and in the end they are dependent upon the 
stock behind for what goes into the window.  She linked with that 
the fact that Bailey had a mind as orderly as a museum, and an 
invincible power over detail.  She saw that if two people took the 
necessary pains to know the facts of government and administration 
with precision, to gather together knowledge that was dispersed and 
confused, to be able to say precisely what had to be done and what 
avoided in this eventuality or that, they would necessarily become a 
centre of reference for all sorts of legislative proposals and 
political expedients, and she went unhesitatingly upon that.
<P>
Bailey, under her vigorous direction, threw up his post in the Civil 
Service and abandoned sporadic controversies, and they devoted 
themselves to the elaboration and realisation of this centre of 
public information she had conceived as their role.  They set out to 
study the methods and organisation and realities of government in 
the most elaborate manner.  They did the work as no one had ever 
hitherto dreamt of doing it.  They planned the research on a 
thoroughly satisfying scale, and arranged their lives almost 
entirely for it.  They took that house in Chambers Street and 
furnished it with severe economy, they discovered that Scotch 
domestic who is destined to be the guardian and tyrant of their 
declining years, and they set to work.  Their first book, "The 
Permanent Official," fills three plump volumes, and took them and 
their two secretaries upwards of four years to do.  It is an 
amazingly good book, an enduring achievement.  In a hundred 
directions the history and the administrative treatment of the 
public service was clarified for all time. . . .
<P>
They worked regularly every morning from nine to twelve, they 
lunched lightly but severely, in the afternoon they "took exercise" 
or Bailey attended meetings of the London School Board, on which he 
served, he said, for the purposes of study--he also became a railway 
director for the same end.  In the late afternoon Altiora was at 
home to various callers, and in the evening came dinner or a 
reception or both.
<P>
Her dinners and gatherings were a very important feature in their 
scheme.  She got together all sorts of interesting people in or 
about the public service, she mixed the obscurely efficient with the 
ill-instructed famous and the rudderless rich, got together in one 
room more of the factors in our strange jumble of a public life than 
had ever met easily before.  She fed them with a shameless austerity 
that kept the conversation brilliant, on a soup, a plain fish, and 
mutton or boiled fowl and milk pudding, with nothing to drink but 
whisky and soda, and hot and cold water, and milk and lemonade.  
Everybody was soon very glad indeed to come to that.  She boasted 
how little her housekeeping cost her, and sought constantly for 
fresh economies that would enable her, she said, to sustain an 
additional private secretary.  Secretaries were the Baileys' one 
extravagance, they loved to think of searches going on in the 
British Museum, and letters being cleared up and precis made 
overhead, while they sat in the little study and worked together, 
Bailey with a clockwork industry, and Altiora in splendid flashes 
between intervals of cigarettes and meditation.  "All efficient 
public careers," said Altiora, "consist in the proper direction of 
secretaries."
<P>
"If everything goes well I shall have another secretary next year," 
Altiora told me.  "I wish I could refuse people dinner napkins.  
Imagine what it means in washing!  I dare most things. . . .  But as 
it is, they stand a lot of hardship here."
<P>
"There's something of the miser in both these people," said Esmeer, 
and the thing was perfectly true.  For, after all, the miser is 
nothing more than a man who either through want of imagination or 
want of suggestion misapplies to a base use a natural power of 
concentration upon one end.  The concentration itself is neither 
good nor evil, but a power that can be used in either way.  And the 
Baileys gathered and reinvested usuriously not money, but knowledge 
of the utmost value in human affairs.  They produced an effect of 
having found themselves--completely.  One envied them at times 
extraordinarily.  I was attracted, I was dazzled--and at the same 
time there was something about Bailey's big wrinkled forehead, his 
lisping broad mouth, the gestures of his hands and an uncivil 
preoccupation I could not endure. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
3
<P>
<P>
Their effect upon me was from the outset very considerable.
<P>
Both of them found occasion on that first visit of mine to talk to 
me about my published writings and particularly about my then just 
published book THE NEW RULER, which had interested them very much.  
It fell in indeed so closely with their own way of thinking that I 
doubt if they ever understood how independently I had arrived at my 
conclusions.  It was their weakness to claim excessively.  That 
irritation, however, came later.  We discovered each other 
immensely; for a time it produced a tremendous sense of kindred and 
cooperation.
<P>
Altiora, I remember, maintained that there existed a great army of 
such constructive-minded people as ourselves--as yet undiscovered by 
one another.
<P>
"It's like boring a tunnel through a mountain," said Oscar, "and 
presently hearing the tapping of the workers from the other end."
<P>
"If you didn't know of them beforehand," I said, "it might be a 
rather badly joined tunnel."
<P>
"Exactly," said Altiora with a high note, "and that's why we all 
want to find out each other. . . ."
<P>
They didn't talk like that on our first encounter, but they urged me 
to lunch with them next day, and then it was we went into things.  A 
woman Factory Inspector and the Educational Minister for New 
Banksland and his wife were also there, but I don't remember they 
made any contribution to the conversation.  The Baileys saw to that.  
They kept on at me in an urgent litigious way.
<P>
"We have read your book," each began--as though it had been a joint 
function.  "And we consider--"
<P>
"Yes," I protested, "I think--"
<P>
 That was a secondary matter.
<P>
"They did not consider," said Altiora, raising her voice and going 
right over me, that I had allowed sufficiently for the inevitable 
development of an official administrative class in the modern 
state."
<P>
"Nor of its importance," echoed Oscar.
<P>
That, they explained in a sort of chorus, was the cardinal idea of 
their lives, what they were up to, what they stood for.  "We want to 
suggest to you," they said--and I found this was a stock opening of 
theirs--"that from the mere necessities of convenience elected 
bodies MUST avail themselves more and more of the services of expert 
officials.  We have that very much in mind.  The more complicated 
and technical affairs become, the less confidence will the elected 
official have in himself.  We want to suggest that these expert 
officials must necessarily develop into a new class and a very 
powerful class in the community.  We want to organise that.  It may 
be THE power of the future.  They will necessarily have to have very 
much of a common training.  We consider ourselves as amateur unpaid 
precursors of such a class." . . .
<P>
The vision they displayed for my consideration as the aim of public-
spirited endeavour, seemed like a harder, narrower, more specialised 
version of the idea of a trained and disciplined state that 
Willersley and I had worked out in the Alps.  They wanted things 
more organised, more correlated with government and a collective 
purpose, just as we did, but they saw it not in terms of a growing 
collective understanding, but in terms of functionaries, legislative 
change, and methods of administration. . . .
<P>
It wasn't clear at first how we differed.  The Baileys were very 
anxious to win me to co-operation, and I was quite prepared at first 
to identify their distinctive expressions with phrases of my own, 
and so we came very readily into an alliance that was to last some 
years, and break at last very painfully.  Altiora manifestly liked 
me, I was soon discussing with her the perplexity I found in placing 
myself efficiently in the world, the problem of how to take hold of 
things that occupied my thoughts, and she was sketching out careers 
for my consideration, very much as an architect on his first visit 
sketches houses, considers requirements, and puts before you this 
example and that of the more or less similar thing already done. . . .
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
It is easy to see how much in common there was between the Baileys 
and me, and how natural it was that I should become a constant 
visitor at their house and an ally of theirs in many enterprises.  
It is not nearly so easy to define the profound antagonism of spirit 
that also held between us.  There was a difference in texture, a 
difference in quality.  How can I express it?  The shapes of our 
thoughts were the same, but the substance quite different.  It was 
as if they had made in china or cast iron what I had made in 
transparent living matter.  (The comparison is manifestly from my 
point of view.)  Certain things never seemed to show through their 
ideas that were visible, refracted perhaps and distorted, but 
visible always through mine.
<P>
I thought for a time the essential difference lay in our relation to 
beauty.  With me beauty is quite primary in life; I like truth, 
order and goodness, wholly because they are beautiful or lead 
straight to beautiful consequences.  The Baileys either hadn't got 
that or they didn't see it.  They seemed at times to prefer things 
harsh and ugly.  That puzzled me extremely.  The esthetic quality of 
many of their proposals, the "manners" of their work, so to speak, 
were at times as dreadful as--well, War Office barrack architecture.  
A caricature by its exaggerated statements will sometimes serve to 
point a truth by antagonising falsity and falsity.  I remember 
talking to a prominent museum official in need of more public funds 
for the work he had in hand.  I mentioned the possibility of 
enlisting Bailey's influence.
<P>
"Oh, we don't want Philistines like that infernal Bottle-Imp running 
us," he said hastily, and would hear of no concerted action for the 
end he had in view.  "I'd rather not have the extension.
<P>
"You see," he went on to explain, "Bailey's wanting in the 
essentials."
<P>
"What essentials?" said I.
<P>
"Oh! he'd be like a nasty oily efficient little machine for some 
merely subordinate necessity among all my delicate stuff.  He'd do 
all we wanted no doubt in the way of money and powers--and he'd do 
it wrong and mess the place for ever.  Hands all black, you know.  
He's just a means.  Just a very aggressive and unmanageable means.  
This isn't a plumber's job. . . ."
<P>
I stuck to my argument.
<P>
"I don't LIKE him," said the official conclusively, and it seemed to 
me at the time he was just blind prejudice speaking. . . .
<P>
I came nearer the truth of the matter as I came to realise that our 
philosophies differed profoundly.  That isn't a very curable 
difference,--once people have grown up.  Theirs was a philosophy 
devoid of FINESSE.  Temperamentally the Baileys were specialised, 
concentrated, accurate, while I am urged either by some Inner force 
or some entirely assimilated influence in my training, always to 
round off and shadow my outlines.  I hate them hard.  I would 
sacrifice detail to modelling always, and the Baileys, it seemed to 
me, loved a world as flat and metallic as Sidney Cooper's cows.  If 
they had the universe in hand I know they would take down all the 
trees and put up stamped tin green shades and sunlight accumulators.  
Altiora thought trees hopelessly irregular and sea cliffs a great 
mistake. . . .   I got things clearer as time went on.  Though it 
was an Hegelian mess of which I had partaken at Codger's table by 
way of a philosophical training, my sympathies have always been 
Pragmatist.  I belong almost by nature to that school of Pragmatism 
that, following the medieval Nominalists, bases itself upon a denial 
of the reality of classes, and of the validity of general laws.  The 
Baileys classified everything.  They were, in the scholastic sense--
which so oddly contradicts the modern use of the word�"Realists."  
They believed classes were REAL and independent of their 
individuals.  This is the common habit of all so-called educated 
people who have no metaphysical aptitude and no metaphysical 
training.  It leads them to a progressive misunderstanding of the 
world.  It was a favourite trick of Altiora's to speak of everybody 
as a "type"; she saw men as samples moving; her dining-room became a 
chamber of representatives.  It gave a tremendously scientific air 
to many of their generalisations, using "scientific" in its 
nineteenth-century uncritical Herbert Spencer sense, an air that 
only began to disappear when you thought them over again in terms of 
actuality and the people one knew. . . .
<P>
At the Baileys' one always seemed to be getting one's hands on the 
very strings that guided the world.  You heard legislation projected 
to affect this "type" and that; statistics marched by you with sin 
and shame and injustice and misery reduced to quite manageable 
percentages, you found men who were to frame or amend bills in grave 
and intimate exchange with Bailey's omniscience, you heard Altiora 
canvassing approaching resignations and possible appointments that 
might make or mar a revolution in administrative methods, and doing 
it with a vigorous directness that manifestly swayed the decision; 
and you felt you were in a sort of signal box with levers all about 
you, and the world outside there, albeit a little dark and 
mysterious beyond the window, running on its lines in ready 
obedience to these unhesitating lights, true and steady to trim 
termini.
<P>
And then with all this administrative fizzle, this pseudo-scientific 
administrative chatter, dying away in your head, out you went into 
the limitless grimy chaos of London streets and squares, roads and 
avenues lined with teeming houses, each larger than the Chambers 
Street house and at least equally alive, you saw the chaotic clamour 
of hoardings, the jumble of traffic, the coming and going of 
mysterious myriads, you heard the rumble of traffic like the noise 
of a torrent; a vague incessant murmur of cries and voices, wanton 
crimes and accidents bawled at you from the placards; imperative 
unaccountable fashions swaggered triumphant in dazzling windows of 
the shops; and you found yourself swaying back to the opposite 
conviction that the huge formless spirit of the world it was that 
held the strings and danced the puppets on the Bailey stage. . . .
<P>
Under the lamps you were jostled by people like my Staffordshire 
uncle out for a spree, you saw shy youths conversing with 
prostitutes, you passed young lovers pairing with an entire 
disregard of the social suitability of the "types" they might blend 
or create, you saw men leaning drunken against lamp-posts whom you 
knew for the "type" that will charge with fixed bayonets into the 
face of death, and you found yourself unable to imagine little 
Bailey achieving either drunkenness or the careless defiance of 
annihilation.  You realised that quite a lot of types were 
underrepresented in Chambers Street, that feral and obscure and 
altogether monstrous forces must be at work, as yet altogether 
unassimilated by those neat administrative reorganisations.
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
Altiora, I remember, preluded Margaret's reappearance by announcing 
her as a "new type."
<P>
I was accustomed to go early to the Baileys' dinners in those days, 
for a preliminary gossip with Altiora in front of her drawing-room 
fire.  One got her alone, and that early arrival was a little sign 
of appreciation she valued.  She had every woman's need of followers 
and servants.
<P>
"I'm going to send you down to-night," she said, "with a very 
interesting type indeed--one of the new generation of serious gals.  
Middle-class origin--and quite well off.  Rich in fact.  Her step-
father was a solicitor and something of an ENTREPRENEUR towards the 
end, I fancy--in the Black Country.  There was a little brother 
died, and she's lost her mother quite recently.  Quite on her own, 
so to speak.  She's never been out into society very much, and 
doesn't seem really very anxious to go. . . .  Not exactly an 
intellectual person, you know, but quiet, and great force of 
character.  Came up to London on her own and came to us--someone had 
told her we were the sort of people to advise her--to ask what to 
do.  I'm sure she'll interest you."
<P>
"What CAN people of that sort do?" I asked.  "Is she capable of 
investigation?"
<P>
Altiora compressed her lips and shook her head.  She always did 
shake her head when you asked that of anyone.
<P>
"Of course what she ought to do," said Altiora, with her silk dress 
pulled back from her knee before the fire, and with a lift of her 
voice towards a chuckle at her daring way of putting things, "is to 
marry a member of Parliament and see he does his work. . . .  
Perhaps she will.  It's a very exceptional gal who can do anything 
by herself--quite exceptional.  The more serious they are--without 
being exceptional--the more we want them to marry."
<P>
Her exposition was truncated by the entry of the type in question.
<P>
"Well!" cried Altiora turning, and with a high note of welcome, 
"HERE you are!"
<P>
Margaret had gained in dignity and prettiness by the lapse of five 
years, and she was now very beautifully and richly and simply 
dressed.  Her fair hair had been done in some way that made it seem 
softer and more abundant than it was in my memory, and a gleam of 
purple velvet-set diamonds showed amidst its mist of little golden 
and brown lines.  Her dress was of white and violet, the last trace 
of mourning for her mother, and confessed the gracious droop of her 
tall and slender body.  She did not suggest Staffordshire at all, 
and I was puzzled for a moment to think where I had met her.  Her 
sweetly shaped mouth with the slight obliquity of the lip and the 
little kink in her brow were extraordinarily familiar to me.  But 
she had either been prepared by Altiora or she remembered my name.  
"We met," she said, "while my step-father was alive--at Misterton.  
You came to see us"; and instantly I recalled the sunshine between 
the apple blossom and a slender pale blue girlish shape among the 
daffodils, like something that had sprung from a bulb itself.  I 
recalled at once that I had found her very interesting, though I did 
not clearly remember how it was she had interested me.
<P>
Other guests arrived--it was one of Altiora's boldly blended 
mixtures of people with ideas and people with influence or money who 
might perhaps be expected to resonate to them.  Bailey came down 
late with an air of hurry, and was introduced to Margaret and said 
absolutely nothing to her--there being no information either to 
receive or impart and nothing to do--but stood snatching his left 
cheek until I rescued him and her, and left him free to congratulate 
the new Lady Snape on her husband's K. C. B.
<P>
I took Margaret down.  We achieved no feats of mutual expression, 
except that it was abundantly clear we were both very pleased and 
interested to meet again, and that we had both kept memories of each 
other.  We made that Misterton tea-party and the subsequent 
marriages of my cousins and the world of Burslem generally, matter 
for quite an agreeable conversation until at last Altiora, following 
her invariable custom, called me by name imperatively out of our 
duologue.  "Mr. Remington," she said, "we want your opinion--" in 
her entirely characteristic effort to get all the threads of 
conversation into her own hands for the climax that always wound up 
her dinners.  How the other women used to hate those concluding 
raids of hers!  I forget most of the other people at that dinner, 
nor can I recall what the crowning rally was about.  It didn't in 
any way join on to my impression of Margaret.
<P>
In the drawing-room of the matting floor I rejoined her, with 
Altiora's manifest connivance, and in the interval I had been 
thinking of our former meeting.
<P>
"Do you find London," I asked, "give you more opportunity for doing 
things and learning things than Burslem?"
<P>
She showed at once she appreciated my allusion to her former 
confidences.  "I was very discontented then," she said and paused.  
"I've really only been in London for a few months.  It's so 
different.  In Burslem, life seems all business and getting--without 
any reason.  One went on and it didn't seem to mean anything.  At 
least anything that mattered. . . .  London seems to be so full of 
meanings--all mixed up together."
<P>
She knitted her brows over her words and smiled appealingly at the 
end as if for consideration for her inadequate expression, 
appealingly and almost humorously.
<P>
I looked understandingly at her.  "We have all," I agreed, "to come 
to London."
<P>
"One sees so much distress," she added, as if she felt she had 
completely omitted something, and needed a codicil.
<P>
"What are you doing in London?"
<P>
"I'm thinking of studying.  Some social question.  I thought perhaps 
I might go and study social conditions as Mrs. Bailey did, go 
perhaps as a work-girl or see the reality of living in, but Mrs. 
Bailey thought perhaps it wasn't quite my work."
<P>
"Are you studying?"
<P>
"I'm going to a good many lectures, and perhaps I shall take up a 
regular course at the Westminster School of Politics and Sociology.  
But Mrs. Bailey doesn't seem to believe very much in that either."
<P>
Her faintly whimsical smile returned.  "I seem rather indefinite," 
she apologised, "but one does not want to get entangled in things 
one can't do.  One--one has so many advantages, one's life seems to 
be such a trust and such a responsibility--"
<P>
She stopped.
<P>
"A man gets driven into work," I said.
<P>
"It must be splendid to be Mrs. Bailey," she replied with a glance 
of envious admiration across the room.
<P>
"SHE has no doubts, anyhow," I remarked.
<P>
"She HAD," said Margaret with the pride of one who has received 
great confidences.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
"You've met before?" said Altiora, a day or so later.
<P>
I explained when.
<P>
"You find her interesting?"
<P>
I saw in a flash that Altiora meant to marry me to Margaret.
<P>
Her intention became much clearer as the year developed.  Altiora 
was systematic even in matters that evade system.  I was to marry 
Margaret, and freed from the need of making an income I was to come 
into politics--as an exponent of Baileyism.  She put it down with 
the other excellent and advantageous things that should occupy her 
summer holiday.  It was her pride and glory to put things down and 
plan them out in detail beforehand, and I'm not quite sure that she 
did not even mark off the day upon which the engagement was to be 
declared.  If she did, I disappointed her.  We didn't come to an 
engagement, in spite of the broadest hints and the glaring 
obviousness of everything, that summer.
<P>
Every summer the Baileys went out of London to some house they hired 
or borrowed, leaving their secretaries toiling behind, and they went 
on working hard in the mornings and evenings and taking exercise in 
the open air in the afternoon.  They cycled assiduously and went for 
long walks at a trot, and raided and studied (and incidentally 
explained themselves to) any social "types" that lived in the 
neighbourhood.  One invaded type, resentful under research, 
described them with a dreadful aptness as Donna Quixote and Sancho 
Panza--and himself as a harmless windmill, hurting no one and 
signifying nothing.  She did rather tilt at things.  This particular 
summer they were at a pleasant farmhouse in level country near 
Pangbourne, belonging to the Hon. Wilfrid Winchester, and they asked 
me to come down to rooms in the neighbourhood--Altiora took them for 
a month for me in August--and board with them upon extremely 
reasonable terms; and when I got there I found Margaret sitting in a 
hammock at Altiora's feet.  Lots of people, I gathered, were coming 
and going in the neighbourhood, the Ponts were in a villa on the 
river, and the Rickhams' houseboat was to moor for some days; but 
these irruptions did not impede a great deal of duologue between 
Margaret and myself.
<P>
Altiora was efficient rather than artistic in her match-making.  She 
sent us off for long walks together--Margaret was a fairly good 
walker--she exhumed some defective croquet things and incited us to 
croquet, not understanding that detestable game is the worst 
stimulant for lovers in the world.  And Margaret and I were always 
getting left about, and finding ourselves for odd half-hours in the 
kitchen-garden with nothing to do except talk, or we were told with 
a wave of the hand to run away and amuse each other.
<P>
Altiora even tried a picnic in canoes, knowing from fiction rather 
than imagination or experience the conclusive nature of such 
excursions.  But there she fumbled at the last moment, and elected 
at the river's brink to share a canoe with me.  Bailey showed so 
much zeal and so little skill--his hat fell off and he became 
miraculously nothing but paddle-clutching hands and a vast wrinkled 
brow--that at last he had to be paddled ignominiously by Margaret, 
while Altiora, after a phase of rigid discretion, as nearly as 
possible drowned herself--and me no doubt into the bargain--with a 
sudden lateral gesture of the arm to emphasise the high note with 
which she dismissed the efficiency of the Charity Organisation 
Society.  We shipped about an inch of water and sat in it for the 
rest of the time, an inconvenience she disregarded heroically.  We 
had difficulties in landing Oscar from his frail craft upon the ait 
of our feasting,--he didn't balance sideways and was much alarmed, 
and afterwards, as Margaret had a pain in her back, I took him in my 
canoe, let him hide his shame with an ineffectual but not positively 
harmful paddle, and towed the other by means of the joined painters.  
Still it was the fault of the inadequate information supplied in the 
books and not of Altiora that that was not the date of my betrothal.
<P>
I find it not a little difficult to state what kept me back from 
proposing marriage to Margaret that summer, and what urged me 
forward at last to marry her.  It is so much easier to remember 
one's resolutions than to remember the moods and suggestions that 
produced them.
<P>
Marrying and getting married was, I think, a pretty simple affair to 
Altiora; it was something that happened to the adolescent and 
unmarried when you threw them together under the circumstances of 
health, warmth and leisure.  It happened with the kindly and 
approving smiles of the more experienced elders who had organised 
these proximities.  The young people married, settled down, children 
ensued, and father and mother turned their minds, now decently and 
properly disillusioned, to other things.  That to Altiora was the 
normal sexual life, and she believed it to be the quality of the 
great bulk of the life about her.
<P>
One of the great barriers to human understanding is the wide 
temperamental difference one finds in the values of things relating 
to sex.  It is the issue upon which people most need training in 
charity and imaginative sympathy.  Here are no universal standards 
at all, and indeed for no single man nor woman does there seem to be 
any fixed standard, so much do the accidents of circumstances and 
one's physical phases affect one's interpretations.  There is 
nothing in the whole range of sexual fact that may not seem 
supremely beautiful or humanly jolly or magnificently wicked or 
disgusting or trivial or utterly insignificant, according to the eye 
that sees or the mood that colours.  Here is something that may fill 
the skies and every waking hour or be almost completely banished 
from a life.  It may be everything on Monday and less than nothing 
on Saturday.  And we make our laws and rules as though in these 
matters all men and women were commensurable one with another, with 
an equal steadfast passion and an equal constant duty. . . .
<P>
I don't know what dreams Altiora may have had in her schoolroom 
days, I always suspected her of suppressed and forgotten phases, but 
certainly her general effect now was of an entirely passionless 
worldliness in these matters.  Indeed so far as I could get at her, 
she regarded sexual passion as being hardly more legitimate in a 
civilised person than--let us say--homicidal mania.  She must have 
forgotten--and Bailey too.  I suspect she forgot before she married 
him.  I don't suppose either of them had the slightest intimation of 
the dimensions sexual love can take in the thoughts of the great 
majority of people with whom they come in contact.  They loved in 
their way--an intellectual way it was and a fond way--but it had no 
relation to beauty and physical sensation--except that there seemed 
a decree of exile against these things.  They got their glow in high 
moments of altruistic ambition--and in moments of vivid worldly 
success.  They sat at opposite ends of their dinner table with so 
and so "captured," and so and so, flushed with a mutual approval.  
They saw people in love forgetful and distraught about them, and 
just put it down to forgetfulness and distraction.  At any rate 
Altiora manifestly viewed my situation and Margaret's with an 
abnormal and entirely misleading simplicity.  There was the girl, 
rich, with an acceptable claim to be beautiful, shiningly virtuous, 
quite capable of political interests, and there was I, talented, 
ambitious and full of political and social passion, in need of just 
the money, devotion and regularisation Margaret could provide.  We 
were both unmarried--white sheets of uninscribed paper.  Was there 
ever a simpler situation?  What more could we possibly want?
<P>
She was even a little offended at the inconclusiveness that did not 
settle things at Pangbourne.  I seemed to her, I suspect, to reflect 
upon her judgment and good intentions.
<P>
<P>
<P>
7
<P>
<P>
I didn't see things with Altiora's simplicity.
<P>
I admired Margaret very much, I was fully aware of all that she and 
I might give each other; indeed so far as Altiora went we were quite 
in agreement.  But what seemed solid ground to Altiora and the 
ultimate footing of her emasculated world, was to me just the 
superficial covering of a gulf--oh! abysses of vague and dim, and 
yet stupendously significant things.
<P>
I couldn't dismiss the interests and the passion of sex as Altiora 
did.  Work, I agreed, was important; career and success; but deep 
unanalysable instincts told me this preoccupation was a thing quite 
as important; dangerous, interfering, destructive indeed, but none 
the less a dominating interest in life.  I have told how flittingly 
and uninvited it came like a moth from the outer twilight into my 
life, how it grew in me with my manhood, how it found its way to 
speech and grew daring, and led me at last to experience.  After 
that adventure at Locarno sex and the interests and desires of sex 
never left me for long at peace.  I went on with my work and my 
career, and all the time it was like--like someone talking ever and 
again in a room while one tries to write.
<P>
There were times when I could have wished the world a world all of 
men, so greatly did this unassimilated series of motives and 
curiosities hamper me; and times when I could have wished the world 
all of women.  I seemed always to be seeking something in women, in 
girls, and I was never clear what it was I was seeking.  But never--
even at my coarsest--was I moved by physical desire alone.  Was I 
seeking help and fellowship?  Was I seeking some intimacy with 
beauty?  It was a thing too formless to state, that I seemed always 
desiring to attain and never attaining.  Waves of gross sensuousness 
arose out of this preoccupation, carried me to a crisis of 
gratification or disappointment that was clearly not the needed 
thing; they passed and left my mind free again for a time to get on 
with the permanent pursuits of my life.  And then presently this 
solicitude would have me again, an irrelevance as it seemed, and yet 
a constantly recurring demand.
<P>
I don't want particularly to dwell upon things that are disagreeable 
for others to read, but I cannot leave them out of my story and get 
the right proportions of the forces I am balancing.  I was no 
abnormal man, and that world of order we desire to make must be 
built of such stuff as I was and am and can beget.  You cannot have 
a world of Baileys; it would end in one orderly generation.  
Humanity is begotten in Desire, lives by Desire.
<P>
<P>
     "Love which is lust, is the Lamp in the Tomb;
      Love which is lust, is the Call from the Gloom."
<P>
<P>
I echo Henley.
<P>
I suppose the life of celibacy which the active, well-fed, well-
exercised and imaginatively stirred young man of the educated 
classes is supposed to lead from the age of nineteen or twenty, when 
Nature certainly meant him to marry, to thirty or more, when 
civilisation permits him to do so, is the most impossible thing in 
the world.  We deal here with facts that are kept secret and 
obscure, but I doubt for my own part if more than one man out of 
five in our class satisfies that ideal demand.  The rest are even as 
I was, and Hatherleigh and Esmeer and all the men I knew.  I draw no 
lessons and offer no panacea; I have to tell the quality of life, 
and this is how it is.  This is how it will remain until men and 
women have the courage to face the facts of life.
<P>
I was no systematic libertine, you must understand; things happened 
to me and desire drove me.  Any young man would have served for that 
Locarno adventure, and after that what had been a mystic and 
wonderful thing passed rapidly into a gross, manifestly misdirected 
and complicating one.  I can count a meagre tale of five illicit 
loves in the days of my youth, to include that first experience, and 
of them all only two were sustained relationships.  Besides these 
five "affairs," on one or two occasions I dipped so low as the inky 
dismal sensuality of the streets, and made one of those pairs of 
correlated figures, the woman in her squalid finery sailing 
homeward, the man modestly aloof and behind, that every night in the 
London year flit by the score of thousands across the sight of the 
observant. . . .
<P>
How ugly it is to recall; ugly and shameful now without 
qualification!  Yet at the time there was surely something not 
altogether ugly in it--something that has vanished, some fine thing 
mortally ailing.
<P>
One such occasion I recall as if it were a vision deep down in a 
pit, as if it had happened in another state of existence to someone 
else.  And yet it is the sort of thing that has happened, once or 
twice at least, to half the men in London who have been in a 
position to make it possible.  Let me try and give you its peculiar 
effect.  Man or woman, you ought to know of it.
<P>
Figure to yourself a dingy room, somewhere in that network of 
streets that lies about Tottenham Court Road, a dingy bedroom lit by 
a solitary candle and carpeted with scraps and patches, with 
curtains of cretonne closing the window, and a tawdry ornament of 
paper in the grate.  I sit on a bed beside a weary-eyed, fair-
haired, sturdy young woman, half undressed, who is telling me in 
broken German something that my knowledge of German is at first 
inadequate to understand. . . .
<P>
I thought she was boasting about her family, and then slowly the 
meaning came to me.  She was a Lett from near Libau in Courland, and 
she was telling me--just as one tells something too strange for 
comment or emotion--how her father had been shot and her sister 
outraged and murdered before her eyes.
<P>
It was as if one had dipped into something primordial and stupendous 
beneath the smooth and trivial surfaces of life.  There was I, you 
know, the promising young don from Cambridge, who wrote quite 
brilliantly about politics and might presently get into Parliament, 
with my collar and tie in my hand, and a certain sense of shameful 
adventure fading out of my mind.
<P>
"Ach Gott!" she sighed by way of comment, and mused deeply for a 
moment before she turned her face to me, as to something forgotten 
and remembered, and assumed the half-hearted meretricious smile.
<P>
"Bin ich eine hubsche?" she asked like one who repeats a lesson.
<P>
I was moved to crave her pardon and come away.
<P>
"Bin ich eine hubsche?" she asked a little anxiously, laying a 
detaining hand upon me, and evidently not understanding a word of 
what I was striving to say.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
I find it extraordinarily difficult to recall the phases by which I 
passed from my first admiration of Margaret's earnestness and 
unconscious daintiness to an intimate acquaintance.  The earlier 
encounters stand out clear and hard, but then the impressions become 
crowded and mingle not only with each other but with all the 
subsequent developments of relationship, the enormous evolutions of 
interpretation and comprehension between husband and wife.  Dipping 
into my memories is like dipping into a ragbag, one brings out this 
memory or that, with no intimation of how they came in time or what 
led to them and joined them together.  And they are all mixed up 
with subsequent associations, with sympathies and discords, habits 
of intercourse, surprises and disappointments and discovered 
misunderstandings.  I know only that always my feelings for Margaret 
were complicatel feelings, woven of many and various strands.
<P>
It is one of the curious neglected aspects of life how at the same 
time and in relation to the same reality we can have in our minds 
streams of thought at quite different levels.  We can be at the same 
time idealising a person and seeing and criticising that person 
quite coldly and clearly, and we slip unconsciously from level to 
level and produce all sorts of inconsistent acts.  In a sense I had 
no illusions about Margaret; in a sense my conception of Margaret 
was entirely poetic illusion.  I don't think I was ever blind to 
certain defects of hers, and quite as certainly they didn't seem to 
matter in the slightest degree.  Her mind had a curious want of 
vigour, "flatness" is the only word; she never seemed to escape from 
her phrase; her way of thinking, her way of doing was indecisive; 
she remained in her attitude, it did not flow out to easy, 
confirmatory action.
<P>
I saw this quite clearly, and when we walked and talked together I 
seemed always trying for animation in her and never finding it.  I 
would state my ideas.  "I know," she would say, "I know."
<P>
I talked about myself and she listened wonderfully, but she made no 
answering revelations.  I talked politics, and she remarked with her 
blue eyes wide and earnest: "Every WORD you say seems so just."
<P>
I admired her appearance tremendously but--I can only express it by 
saying I didn't want to touch her.  Her fair hair was always 
delectably done.  It flowed beautifully over her pretty small ears, 
and she would tie its fair coilings with fillets of black or blue 
velvet that carried pretty buckles of silver and paste.  The light, 
the faint down on her brow and cheek was delightful.  And it was 
clear to me that I made her happy.
<P>
My sense of her deficiencies didn't stand in the way of my falling 
at last very deeply in love with her.  Her very shortcomings seemed 
to offer me something. . . .
<P>
She stood in my mind for goodness--and for things from which it 
seemed to me my hold was slipping.
<P>
She seemed to promise a way of escape from the deepening opposition 
in me between physical passions and the constructive career, the 
career of wide aims and human service, upon which I had embarked.  
All the time that I was seeing her as a beautiful, fragile, rather 
ineffective girl, I was also seeing her just as consciously as a 
shining slender figure, a radiant reconciliation, coming into my 
darkling disorders of lust and impulse.  I could understand clearly 
that she was incapable of the most necessary subtleties of political 
thought, and yet I could contemplate praying to her and putting all 
the intricate troubles of my life at her feet.
<P>
Before the reappearance of Margaret in my world at all an unwonted 
disgust with the consequences and quality of my passions had arisen 
in my mind.  Among other things that moment with the Lettish girl 
haunted me persistently.  I would see myself again and again sitting 
amidst those sluttish surroundings, collar and tie in hand, while 
her heavy German words grouped themselves to a slowly apprehended 
meaning.  I would feel again with a fresh stab of remorse, that this 
was not a flash of adventure, this was not seeing life in any 
permissible sense, but a dip into tragedy, dishonour, hideous 
degradation, and the pitiless cruelty of a world as yet uncontrolled 
by any ordered will.
<P>
"Good God!" I put it to myself, "that I should finish the work those 
Cossacks had begun!  I who want order and justice before everything!  
There's no way out of it, no decent excuse!  If I didn't think, I 
ought to have thought!" . . .
<P>
How did I get to it?" . . .  I would ransack the phases of my 
development from the first shy unveiling of a hidden wonder to the 
last extremity as a man will go through muddled account books to 
find some disorganising error. . . .
<P>
I was also involved at that time--I find it hard to place these 
things in the exact order of their dates because they were so 
disconnected with the regular progress of my work and life--in an 
intrigue, a clumsy, sensuous, pretentious, artificially stimulated 
intrigue, with a Mrs. Larrimer, a woman living separated from her 
husband.  I will not go into particulars of that episode, nor how we 
quarrelled and chafed one another.  She was at once unfaithful and 
jealous and full of whims about our meetings; she was careless of 
our secret, and vulgarised our relationship by intolerable 
interpretations; except for some glowing moments of gratification, 
except for the recurrent and essentially vicious desire that drew us 
back to each other again, we both fretted at a vexatious and 
unexpectedly binding intimacy.  The interim was full of the quality 
of work delayed, of time and energy wasted, of insecure precautions 
against scandal and exposure.  Disappointment is almost inherent in 
illicit love.  I had, and perhaps it was part of her recurrent 
irritation also, a feeling as though one had followed something fine 
and beautiful into a net--into bird lime!  These furtive scuffles, 
this sneaking into shabby houses of assignation, was what we had 
made out of the suggestion of pagan beauty; this was the reality of 
our vision of nymphs and satyrs dancing for the joy of life amidst 
incessant sunshine.  We had laid hands upon the wonder and glory of 
bodily love and wasted them. . . .
<P>
It was the sense of waste, of finely beautiful possibilities getting 
entangled and marred for ever that oppressed me.  I had missed, I 
had lost.  I did not turn from these things after the fashion of the 
Baileys, as one turns from something low and embarrassing.  I felt 
that these great organic forces were still to be wrought into a 
harmony with my constructive passion.  I felt too that I was not 
doing it.  I had not understood the forces in this struggle nor its 
nature, and as I learnt I failed.  I had been started wrong, I had 
gone on wrong, in a world that was muddled and confused, full of 
false counsel and erratic shames and twisted temptations.  I learnt 
to see it so by failures that were perhaps destroying any chance of 
profit in my lessons.  Moods of clear keen industry alternated with 
moods of relapse and indulgence and moods of dubiety and remorse.  I 
was not going on as the Baileys thought I was going on.  There were 
times when the blindness of the Baileys irritated me intensely. 
Beneath the ostensible success of those years, between twenty-three 
and twenty-eight, this rottenness, known to scarcely any one but 
myself, grew and spread.  My sense of the probability of a collapse 
intensified.  I knew indeed now, even as Willersley had prophesied 
five years before, that I was entangling myself in something that 
might smother all my uses in the world.  Down there among those 
incommunicable difficulties, I was puzzled and blundering.  I was 
losing my hold upon things; the chaotic and adventurous element in 
life was spreading upward and getting the better of me, over-
mastering me and all my will to rule and make. . . .  And the 
strength, the drugging urgency of the passion!
<P>
Margaret shone at times in my imagination like a radiant angel in a 
world of mire and disorder, in a world of cravings, hot and dull red 
like scars inflamed. . . .
<P>
I suppose it was because I had so great a need of such help as her 
whiteness proffered, that I could ascribe impossible perfections to 
her, a power of intellect, a moral power and patience to which she, 
poor fellow mortal, had indeed no claim.  If only a few of us WERE 
angels and freed from the tangle of effort, how easy life might be!  
I wanted her so badly, so very badly, to be what I needed.  I wanted 
a woman to save me.  I forced myself to see her as I wished to see 
her.  Her tepidities became infinite delicacies, her mental 
vagueness an atmospheric realism.  The harsh precisions of the 
Baileys and Altiora's blunt directness threw up her fineness into 
relief and made a grace of every weakness.
<P>
Mixed up with the memory of times when I talked with Margaret as one 
talks politely to those who are hopelessly inferior in mental 
quality, explaining with a false lucidity, welcoming and encouraging 
the feeblest response, when possible moulding and directing, are 
times when I did indeed, as the old phrase goes, worship the ground 
she trod on.  I was equally honest and unconscious of inconsistency 
at each extreme.  But in neither phase could I find it easy to make 
love to Margaret.  For in the first I did not want to, though I 
talked abundantly to her of marriage and so forth, and was a little 
puzzled at myself for not going on to some personal application, and 
in the second she seemed inaccessible, I felt I must make 
confessions and put things before her that would be the grossest 
outrage upon the noble purity I attributed to her.
<P>

I went to Margaret at last to ask her to marry me, wrought up to the 
mood of one who stakes his life on a cast.  Separated from her, and 
with the resonance of an evening of angry recriminations with Mrs. 
Larrimer echoing in my mind, I discovered myself to be quite 
passionately in love with Margaret.  Last shreds of doubt vanished.  
It has always been a feature of our relationship that Margaret 
absent means more to me than Margaret present; her memory distils 
from its dross and purifies in me.  All my criticisms and 
qualifications of her vanished into some dark corner of my mind.  
She was the lady of my salvation; I must win my way to her or 
perish.
<P>
I went to her at last, for all that I knew she loved me, in 
passionate self-abasement, white and a-tremble.  She was staying 
with the Rockleys at Woking, for Shena Rockley had been at Bennett 
Hall with her and they had resumed a close intimacy; and I went down 
to her on an impulse, unheralded.  I was kept waiting for some 
minutes, I remember, in a little room upon which a conservatory 
opened, a conservatory full of pots of large mauve-edged, white 
cyclamens in flower.  And there was a big lacquer cabinet, a Chinese 
thing, I suppose, of black and gold against the red-toned wall.  To 
this day the thought of Margaret is inseparably bound up with the 
sight of a cyclamen's back-turned petals.
<P>
She came in, looking pale and drooping rather more than usual.  I 
suddenly realised that Altiora's hint of a disappointment leading to 
positive illness was something more than a vindictive comment.  She 
closed the door and came across to me and took and dropped my hand 
and stood still.  "What is it you want with me?" she asked.
<P>
The speech I had been turning over and over in my mind on the way 
vanished at the sight of her.
<P>
"I want to talk to you," I answered lamely.
<P>
For some seconds neither of us said a word.
<P>
"I want to tell you things about my life," I began.
<P>
She answered with a scarcely audible "yes."
<P>
"I almost asked you to marry me at Pangbourne," I plunged.  "I 
didn't.  I didn't because--because you had too much to give me."
<P>
"Too much!" she echoed, "to give you!"  She had lifted her eyes to 
my face and the colour was coming into her cheeks.
<P>
"Don't misunderstand me," I said hastily.  "I want to tell you 
things, things you don't know.  Don't answer me.  I want to tell 
you."
<P>
She stood before the fireplace with her ultimate answer shining 
through the quiet of her face.  "Go on," she said, very softly.  It 
was so pitilessly manifest she was resolved to idealise the 
situation whatever I might say.  I began walking up and down the 
room between those cyclamens and the cabinet.  There were little 
gold fishermen on the cabinet fishing from little islands that each 
had a pagoda and a tree, and there were also men in boats or 
something, I couldn't determine what, and some obscure sub-office in 
my mind concerned itself with that quite intently.  Yet I seem to 
have been striving with all my being to get words for the truth of 
things.  "You see," I emerged, "you make everything possible to me.  
You can give me help and sympathy, support, understanding.  You know 
my political ambitions.  You know all that I might do in the world.  
I do so intensely want to do constructive things, big things 
perhaps, in this wild jumble. . . .  Only you don't know a bit what 
I am.  I want to tell you what I am.  I'm complex. . . .  I'm 
streaked."
<P>
I glanced at her, and she was regarding me with an expression of 
blissful disregard for any meaning I was seeking to convey.
<P>
"You see," I said, "I'm a bad man."
<P>
She sounded a note of valiant incredulity.
<P>
Everything seemed to be slipping away from me.  I pushed on to the 
ugly facts that remained over from the wreck of my interpretation.  
"What has held me back," I said, "is the thought that you could not 
possibly understand certain things in my life.  Men are not pure as 
women are.  I have had love affairs.  I mean I have had affairs.  
Passion--desire.  You see, I have had a mistress, I have been 
entangled--"
<P>
She seemed about to speak, but I interrupted.  "I'm not telling 
you," I said, "what I meant to tell you.  I want you to know clearly 
that there is another side to my life, a dirty side.  Deliberately I 
say, dirty.  It didn't seem so at first--"
<P>
I stopped blankly.  "Dirty," I thought, was the most idiotic choice 
of words to have made.
<P>
I had never in any tolerable sense of the word been dirty.
<P>
"I drifted into this--as men do," I said after a little pause and 
stopped again.
<P>
She was looking at me with her wide blue eyes.
<P>
"Did you imagine," she began, "that I thought you--that I expected--"
<P>
"But how can you know?"
<P>
"I know.  I do know."
<P>
"But--" I began.
<P>
"I know," she persisted, dropping her eyelids.  "Of course I know," 
and nothing could have convinced me more completely that she did not 
know.
<P>
"All men--" she generalised.  "A woman does not understand these 
temptations."
<P>
I was astonished beyond measure at her way of taking my confession. 
. . .
<P>
"Of course," she said, hesitating a little over a transparent 
difficulty, "it is all over and past."
<P>
"It's all over and past," I answered.
<P>
There was a little pause.
<P>
"I don't want to know," she said.  "None of that seems to matter now 
in the slightest degree."
<P>
She looked up and smiled as though we had exchanged some acceptable 
commonplaces.  "Poor dear!" she said, dismissing everything, and put 
out her arms, and it seemed to me that I could hear the Lettish girl 
in the background--doomed safety valve of purity in this intolerable 
world--telling something in indistinguishable German--I know not 
what nor why. . . .
<P>
I took Margaret in my arms and kissed her.  Her eyes were wet with 
tears.  She clung to me and was near, I felt, to sobbing.
<P>
"I have loved you," she whispered presently, "Oh! ever since we met 
in Misterton--six years and more ago."
