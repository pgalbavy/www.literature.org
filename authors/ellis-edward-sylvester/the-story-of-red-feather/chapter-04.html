<p>Melville now examined the fix of the chieftain more closely.
His struggles had hurt the skin about his neck and shoulders,
and there could be no doubt he was suffering considerably.</p>

<p>Clasping the dusky head with his hands, the youth turned it gently,
so that it offered the least possible resistance. Then he asked
him to move his shoulder slightly to the left, and, while Melville
pushed carefully but strongly, told him to exert himself, not
hastily but slowly, and with all the power at his command.</p>

<p>Resting a minute or two, the attempt was renewed and this time
Red Feather succeeded in withdrawing for an inch or two, though
the effort plainly caused him pain.</p>

<p>"That's right," added Melville, encouragingly; "we shall succeed&mdash;try
it again."</p>

<p>There was a vigorous scraping, tugging, and pulling, and all
at once the head and shoulders vanished through the window. Red
Feather was released from the vice.</p>

<p>"There, I knew you would be all right!" called the lad through
the opening. "Good-bye, Red Feather."</p>

<p>The chief must have been not only confused and bewildered, but
chagrined by the exhibition made before the lad and his own warriors,
who, had they possessed any sense of humor, would have laughed
at the sorry plight of their leader.</p>

<p>Stepping back from the window, so as not to tempt any shot from
the other Sioux, all of whom had gathered about the chief, Melville
found himself in a dilemma.</p>

<p>"Shall I take Red Feather at his word?" he asked himself; "shall
I open the door and walk out with Dot, mount Saladin and gallop
off to Barwell, or&mdash;wait?"</p>

<p>There is little doubt, from what followed, that the former would
have been the wiser course of the youth. Despite the treacherous
character of the Sioux leader, he was so relieved by his release
from what he felt at the time was a fatal snare, and by the kindness
received from the boy, that his heart was stirred by something
akin to gratitude, and he would have restrained his warriors from
violence.</p>

<p>Had Melville been alone, he would not have hesitated; but he
was irresolute on account of Dot. Looking down in her sweet trustful
face, his heart misgave him; he felt that, so long as she was
with him, he could assume no risks. He was comparatively safe
for a time in the building, while there was no saying what would
follow if he should place himself and Dot in the power of Indians
that had set out to destroy and slay.</p>

<p>Besides, if Red Feather meant to keep his promise he could do
so without involving the brother and sister in the least danger.
He had only to ride off with his warriors, when Melville would
walk forth, call Saladin to him, mount, and ride away.</p>

<p>"If he is honest," was his decision, "he will do that; I will
wait until they are only a short distance off, and then will gallop
to the settlement."</p>

<p>"Come," said he, taking the hand of Dot, "let's go upstairs."</p>

<p>"Why don't you stay down here, Mel?"</p>

<p>"Well, I am afraid to leave you alone because you are so apt
to forget your promises to me; and since I want to go upstairs
I must take you with me."</p>

<p>She made no objection, and holding Susie clasped by one arm,
she placed the other hand in her brother's, and, side by side,
the two walked up the steps to the larger room, occupied by their
parents when at home.</p>

<p>"Now," said Melville, speaking with great seriousness, "you must
do just as I tell you, Dot; for it you don't the bad Indians will
surely hurt you, and you will never see Susie again."</p>

<p>She gave her pledge with such earnestness that he could depend
upon her from that time forward.</p>

<p>"You must not go near the window unless I tell you to do so:
the reason for that is that some of the Indians will see you,
and they will fire their guns at you. If the bullet does not strike
Dot and kill her, it will hit Susie, and that will be the last
of <em>her</em>. The best thing you can do is to lie down on the
bed and rest."</p>

<p>Dot obeyed cheerfully, reclining on the couch, with her round
plump face against the pillow, where a few minutes later she sank
into a sweet sleep. Poor child! little did she dream of what was
yet to come.</p>

<p>She was safe so long as she remained thus, since, though a bullet
fired through any one of the windows must cross the room, it would
pass above the bed, missing her by several feet.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "The chief and his five followers had re-mounted
their ponies." &mdash;Page 41]</p>

<p>Relieved of all present anxiety concerning her, Melville now
gave his attention to Red Feather and his warriors. That which
he saw was not calculated to add to his peace of mind.</p>

<p>The chief and his five followers had re-mounted their ponies,
and ridden to a point some two hundred yards distant on the prairie,
where they halted, as if for consultation.</p>

<p>"Just what I feared," said the youth, feeling it safe to stand
before the upper window and watch every movement; "Red Feather
has already begun to repent of his pledge to me, and his warriors
are trying to persuade him to break his promise. I don't believe
they will find it hard work to change his mind."</p>

<p>But whatever was said, it was plain that the Sioux were much
in earnest. All were talking, and their arms swung about their
heads, and they nodded with a vigor that left no doubt all were
taking part in the dispute, and each one meant what he said.</p>

<p>"Where there is so much wrangling, it looks as if some were in
favor of letting us alone," thought Melville, who added the next
minute&mdash;"I don't know that that follows, for it may be they are
quarrelling over the best plan of slaying us, with no thought
on the part of any one that they are bound in honor to spare us."</p>

<p>By-and-by the ponies, which kept moving uneasily about, took
position so that the heads of all were turned fully or partly
towards the building, from which the lad was attentively watching
their movements.</p>

<p>During these exciting moments Melville did not forget Saladin.
The sagacious animal, being no longer troubled by those that were
so anxious to steal him, had halted at a distance of an eighth
of a mile, where he was eating the grass as though there was nothing
unusual in his surroundings.</p>

<p>"I hope you will be wise enough, old fellow," muttered his young
master, "to keep them at a distance; that shot couldn't have hit
you, or, if it did, it caused nothing more than a scratch."</p>

<p>The horse's wisdom was tested the next minute. One of the warriors
withdrew from the group, and began riding at a gallop towards
Saladin. As he drew near he brought his pony down to a walk, and
evidently hoped to calm the other's fears sufficiently to permit
a still closer approach.</p>

<p>Melville's heart throbbed painfully as the distance lessened,
and he began to believe he was to lose his priceless animal after
all.</p>

<p>"Why didn't I think of it?" he asked himself, placing his finger
in his mouth, and emitting a shrill whistle that could have been
heard a mile distant.</p>

<p>It was a signal with which Saladin was familiar. He instantly
raised his head and looked towards the house. As he did so he
saw one of his mounted enemies slowly approaching, and within
a dozen rods. It was enough, and breaking into a gallop, he quickly
ended all hope of his capture by <em>that</em> Sioux brave.</p>

<p>That signal of Melville Clarendon had also been heard by all
the Sioux, who must have thought it was due to that alone that
the warrior failed to secure the valuable animal. The youth saw
the group looking inquiringly at the house, as if to learn from
what point the sound came, and the expression on the dark faces
was anything but pleasing to him.</p>

<p>He wished to give Red Feather credit for the delay on the part
of the Sioux. Their actions showed they were hotly disputing over
something, and what more likely than that it was the question
of assailing the house and outbuildings?</p>

<p>But there were several facts against this theory. Red Feather
held such despotic sway over his followers that it was hard to
understand what cause could arise for any dispute with them about
the disposal to be made of the brother and sister. If he desired
to leave them alone, what was to prevent him riding off and obliging
every one of his warriors to go with him?</p>

<p>This was the question which Melville continually asked himself,
and which he could not answer as he wished, being unable to drive
away the belief that the chief was acting a double part.</p>

<p>The Sioux had reached some decision; for, on the return of the
one who failed to secure Saladin, they ceased disputing, and rode
towards the window from which Melville was watching them.</p>

<p>Their ponies were on a slow walk, and the expression on their
forbidding faces was plainly seen as their eyes ranged over the
front of the building. The youth had withdrawn, so as to stand
out of range; but, to end the doubt in his mind, he now stepped
out in full view of every one of the warriors.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Melville had warning enough to leap back."]</p>

<p>The doubt was removed at once. Previous to this the lad had raised
the lower sash, so as to give him the chance to fire, and as he
stood, his waist and shoulders were in front of the upper part
of the glass. It so happened that Red Feather and one of his warriors
were looking at the very window at which he appeared. Like a flash
both guns went to their shoulders and were discharged.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "He pointed his own weapon outward, and fired."]</p>

<p>But Melville had enough warning to leap back, as the jingle and
crash of glass showed how well the miscreants had aimed. Stirred
to the deepest anger, he pointed his own weapon outward and fired
into the party, doing so with such haste that he really took no
aim at all.</p>

<p>It is not likely that his bullet had gone anywhere near the Sioux,
but it had served the purpose of warning them that he was as much
in earnest as themselves.</p>

<p>Melville placed a cartridge in the breech of his rifle with as
much coolness as a veteran, and prepared himself for what he believed
was to be a desperate defence of himself and sister.</p>

<p>It must not be thought that he was in despair; for, when he came
to look over the situation, he found much to encourage him. In
the first place, although besieged by a half-dozen fierce Sioux,
he was sure the siege could not last long. Whatever they did must
be done within a few hours.</p>

<p>While it was impossible to tell the hour when his parents started
from Barwell, it must have been quite early in the morning, and
there was every reason to hope they would reach the settlement
by noon at the latest. The moment they did so they would learn
that Melville had left long before for home, and therefore had
taken the upper trail, since, had he not done so, the parties
would have met on the road.</p>

<p>True, Mr. Clarendon would feel strong hope that his son, being
so well mounted, would wheel about and follow without delay the
counsel in the letter; but he was too shrewd to rely fully on
such hope. What could be more certain than that he would instantly
gather a party of friends and set out to their relief?</p>

<p>The great dread of the youth was that the Sioux would set fire
to the buildings, and he wondered many times that this was not
done at the time Red Feather learned of the flight of the family.</p>

<p>Melville glanced at Dot, and, seeing she was asleep, he decided
to go downstairs and make a fuller examination of the means of
defence.</p>

<p>"Everything seems to be as secure as it can be," he said, standing
in the middle of the room and looking around; "that door has already
been tried, and found not wanting. The only other means of entrance
is through the windows, and after Red Feather's experience I am
sure neither he nor any of his warriors will try <em>that</em>."</p>

<p>There were four windows&mdash;two at the front and two at the rear&mdash;all
of the same shape and size. There was but the single door, of
which so much has already been said, and therefore the lower portion
of the building could not be made safer.</p>

<p>The stone chimney, so broad at the base that it was more than
half as wide as the side of the outside wall, was built of stone,
and rose a half-dozen feet above the roof. It was almost entirely
out of doors, but was solid and strong.</p>

<p>"If the Indians were not such lazy people," said Melville&mdash;looking
earnestly at the broad fire-place, in front of which stood the
new-fashioned stove&mdash;"they might set to work and take down the
chimney, but I don't think there is much danger of <em>that</em>."</p>

<p>He had hardly given expression to the thought when he fancied
he heard a slight noise on the outside, and close to the chimney
itself. He stepped forward, and held his ear to the stones composing
the walls of the fire-place.</p>

<p>Still the sounds were faint, and he then touched his ear against
them, knowing that solid substances are much better conductors
of sound than air. He now detected the noise more plainly, but
it was still so faint that he could not identify it.</p>

<p>He was still striving hard to do so when, to his amazement, Dot
called him from above-stairs&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where are you, Mel? Is that you that I can hear crawling about
over the roof?"</p>
