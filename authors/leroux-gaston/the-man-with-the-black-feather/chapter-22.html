<p>So far I have only given the simplest plan of the line that I
might get the basis of the affair as clear as possible. That plan
is not quite complete, for though there was only this one line
joining the stations A and B there was a short side-line, H I,
which led to a sand-pit which had supplied a glass-factory. But
since the glass-factory had failed, they no longer worked the
sand-pit; and the side-line was practically abandoned. Here is
the complete plan:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Station A       D    C     Station B.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&#11834;x&#11834;x&#11834;x<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I/

<p>It will naturally be supposed that this side-line leading to
the sand-pit is going to provide the explanation, the quite simple
explanation of the disappearance of the express. But if the matter
had been as simple as the side-line would appear to make it, I
should hardly have omitted it from the first map. I could have
said at once: "It is quite clear that, owing to a train of circumstances
which it remains to determine, the express, instead of continuing
to follow the line B A, must have turned off up the side-line
H I, and buried itself in the vast mass of loose sand at the sand-pit
I. Rushing along at a speed of over sixty miles an hour, it evidently
plunged into the mass of sand, which covered it up; and that is
the stupid but actual reason of its disappearance."</p>

<p>But, to say nothing of the fact that this does not explain the
presence, at the point D, of the guard's-van and railway-carriage,
out of the window of which Signor Petito had stuck his head, this
explanation could not have failed to occur to the alert intelligence
of the engineers of the company. Moreover, there were points and
a switch at the point H; this switch, in accordance with the rules,
was padlocked; and the key had been taken away.</p>

<p>I indeed attached no importance to the fact that <em>the padlock
was locked</em>; for, it seemed to me quite probable that the
key had been left in the padlock, <em>which had actually been
the case</em>, and that Theophrastus, who had good reasons for
stopping the train in order to join Signor Petito, had profited
by the presence of that key, to shift the points. It was only
a matter of thrusting over the lever of the switch; and that would
explain why the train was not seen by the signal-man at A, since,
instead of continuing along the line B A, it had turned off up
H I towards the sand-pit. I told myself all this; and if it had
explained anything, I should have stated it at once, and instead
of giving two maps I should have given merely the latter with
the side-line H I on it.</p>

<p>That I have not done so is owing to the fact that the side-line
H I explains nothing. I also believed at first that it was going
to make the disappearance of the express clear to us, but as a
matter of fact <em>it complicates the catastrophe instead of explaining
it</em>; for here is the story, the true story; and that too continues
to explain nothing at all.</p>

<p>Wandering along the road which runs beside the railway, Theophrastus
had noticed the little side-line, and seen that the key had been
left in the padlock of the switch. This fact, which had been of
no importance to him before his brief but stormy interview with
Signora Petito, assumed an enormous importance when he resolved
to join, at any cost, Signor Petito, who was in the train <em>which
was about to pass under his nose</em>. M. Longuet said to himself:
"I cannot board the express, rushing between the two stations
A and B, in the usual way. But there is a little side-line H I,
the key is in the padlock of the switch; I have only to turn the
lever, and the express will dash up H I. Since it is broad daylight
the engine-driver will see what has happened, he will stop the
train, and I shall take advantage of its stopping to board it."</p>

<p>Nothing could be more simple; and Theophrastus did it. He dragged
over the lever of the switch, walked up the side-line, and waited
for the express.</p>

<p>Theophrastus, hidden behind a tree that none of the officials
on the express might see him, awaited its coming at the point
K, that is to say, rather more than half-way up the side-line,
that is to say, <em>on this side of the sand-pit I</em>. He waited
for the express coming from H, <em>with his eyes on the track</em>.
If, as everyone must have been supposing ever since I mentioned
the sand-pit, the train coming from H had buried itself in the
sand at I, Theophrastus, who was at K, between H and I, must have
seen it. But Theophrastus waited for the train and waited for
the train and waited for the train. He waited for it as the signal-man
at station A had waited for it; and he no more saw the express
than did the signal-man at A and the rest of the officials of
the line.</p>

<p><em>The express had disappeared for M. Longuet as it had disappeared
for the rest of the world.</em></p>

<p>So much so that, tired of waiting, M. Longuet walked down as
far as H to see what was happening. There he saw the staff of
A, which was hurrying towards B in its search for the express.
He asked himself sadly what could have become of the express;
and finding no answer to the question, he walked up H I, and when
he arrived at K, which he had just left, he found the empty guard's-van
and the railway-carriage which a few minutes later the two staffs
were to find at D!</p>

<p>Once more he swore by the throttle of Mme. Phalaris, and buried
his brow in his hands, asking himself how that guard's-van and
that carriage came to be there, since the express itself had not
come. <em>It had not come, since he, Theophrastus, had not quitted
the track.</em></p>

<p>Suddenly he saw the head of a man waggling out of the window
of the railway-carriage; and since this head had no ears, he recognised
Signor Petito.</p>

<p>He sprang up into the railway-carriage, <em>and without troubling
to let down the window and release the head</em> of the unfortunate
expert in handwriting, he stripped him of his clothes, and proceeded
to put them on. Theophrastus, who knew himself to be tracked by
the police and in whom the astuteness of Cartouche sprang to life
again, was disguising himself. When he was dressed, he made a
bundle of his own clothes, and descended from the carriage. He
felt in Signor Petito's pockets, took out his pocket-book, sat
down on the embankment, and plunged into the study of the papers
it contained, hunting for the traces of his treasures. But Signor
Petito had carried to the tomb the secret of the treasures of
the Chopinettes; never again were the Gall, the Cock, the Chopinettes,
or the treasures to be discussed: with the result that Signora
Petito, who learnt a few minutes later of the extraordinary death
of her husband, presently went mad, and was confined in a lunatic
asylum for six months.</p>

<p>But we are only concerned with the misfortune of Theophrastus,
which so surpasses all other human misfortunes, and which is so
hard to believe that we need all the assistance that Science can
give us to credit it wholly. I cannot believe that the minds of
my readers are so base, or their imaginations so poor, that the
matter of the treasures could be of any genuine interest to them,
when they are confronted by this phenomenon, of such surpassing
interest, the soul of Theophrastus.</p>

<p>Presently that unfortunate man, on failing to find anything of
interest to him in the papers of Signor Petito, heaved a deep
sigh. He raised his head; and lo! <em>the guard's-van and the
railway-carriage of Signor Petito had disappeared</em>!</p>
