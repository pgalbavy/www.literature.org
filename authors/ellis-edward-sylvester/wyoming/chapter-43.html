<p>Gravity Gimp and Lieutenant Fred Godfrey were in high spirits,
for each had been highly favored by fortune. They were beyond
sight of the camp-fire and had thrown the pursuing Iroquois off
the track, so that, with ordinary care, they were out of personal
danger.</p>

<p>But this elation could not last. Could they forget that within
a stone's throw their friends were in peril, and unless soon rescued
would be beyond all help?</p>

<p>"We have only one gun between us," said Fred, "and I don't see
any prospect of getting another."</p>

<p>"I thinked maybe we mought find one, somewhar in de woods," said
Gimp, "but I guess dere ain't much show for dat. You am de best
shot, so I'll be wery much obleeged if you'll take charge ob dis
rifle."</p>

<p>Fred accepted the weapon, feeling that before any great harm
could befall those in the Indian camp, the bullet nestling in
the barrel would be heard from.</p>

<p>"We will steal up as near as we dare," said he, "and watch our
chances."</p>

<p>"I doesn't see dat I can assist you, to a wery alarming extent,"
said Gimp, "so if you doesn't object, I'll go on a scout."</p>

<p>"Go on a scout? What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Ise an ijee; I'll take a look around, and when I want you I'll
just whistle this way, and you'll understand."</p>

<p>Fred had little faith in the proposal, but fortunately he did
not object, and a minute later Gimp was gone.</p>

<p>Left to himself Fred stealthily approached the vicinity of the
camp, fully alive to the delicacy of his mission.</p>

<p>He was resolved that if detected, and this was likely to occur,
since a number of the Senecas were still absent and would soon
be returning, he would not be retaken.</p>

<p>"There will not be a shadow of hope, if I fall into their hands
again, and I may as well make it lively for a while."</p>

<p>A few steps farther and he reached a point from which he obtained
a clear view of the Indian camp.</p>

<p>He saw Aunt Peggy busy with her culinary duties, while the group
of half a dozen Indians were as eagerly watching and scrambling
for the brown slices as if they were so many wolves.</p>

<p>By and by Jake Golcher cut the withes that bound the arms of
Habakkuk McEwen and Mr. Brainerd, and began talking with Maggie
while Fred watched with the deepest interest the singular camp.</p>

<p>"I think there'll be some mischief done pretty soon," thought
the youth, after watching the scene for a moment; "and, if so,
I must take a hand."</p>

<p>He had stationed himself by the side of a tree with large spreading
limbs, and he now resorted to the odd plan of climbing a short
distance and seating himself among the limbs.</p>

<p>"I've got just as good a view here," he said to himself, "and,
if it becomes necessary to shoot, they won't be apt to look in
this place for me."</p>

<p>At the same time it occurred to him that if the flash of his
gun should be noticed, and his whereabouts discovered, he would
be in the worst possible situation.</p>

<p>Parting the limbs, so as to give him the view he wished, he held
his weapon ready to fire any instant, while he closely watched
proceedings.</p>

<p>No better aim could have been required than that now given him;
he could cover every one in the party, and the distance was so
short that it was impossible to miss.</p>

<p>"I ought to shoot him," he muttered, as he looked at Jake Golcher,
while sitting by Maggie Brainerd and talking with such earnestness;
"it is he who has followed us, and but for him the party would
be well out of danger by this time."</p>

<p>The young lieutenant was angry enough to shoot a dozen Tories,
had the chance been his; but when he sighted along the gleaming
barrel of his rifle, on which the firelight fell, he could not
bring himself to the point.</p>

<p>"Yes; I ought to do it," he added, "but I can't feel right in
picking off a man in that fashion. No; I'll wait till he gives
me a better excuse."</p>

<p>The watcher knew what passed between Maggie, Golcher, and Mr.
Brainerd, when the last came up and uttered his indignant protest,
almost as well as if he had overheard the words themselves.</p>

<p>"Jake has proposed to let the whole party off, provided Maggie
will marry him, and before she can decide (for he knows if she
makes the promise she will keep it, if they both live), father
is giving the Tory a piece of his mind. He's doing it in a style,
too, that can't be misunderstood."</p>

<p>This little scene lasted but a few seconds, when Mr. Brainerd
resumed his seat on the log, close to his daughter, as if he would
protect her from any more such advances.</p>

<p>All this was noted and understood by the watcher in the tree,
when the latter was recalled to his own situation by a slight
rustling below. Looking down, he was able to see by the light
of the camp-fire the figure of a Seneca Indian, as he walked softly
in the direction of the camp.</p>

<p>No doubt he was one of the warriors that had been hunting for
Fred, and who failed to find him.</p>

<p>The latter was so near his enemies that he could follow the motions
of the Indian until he joined his comrades, or, rather, went up
to Golcher, who straightway began questioning him about the search
for the young patriot.</p>

<p>Whatever their answers might have been, it is scarcely to be
presumed they added much to the peace of mind of Mr. Jacob Golcher.</p>
