<P>
Next morning as soon as the sun was up, Glinda flew back to her
castle, stopping on the way to instruct the Scarecrow and the Tin
Woodman, who were at that time staying at the college of Professor H.
M.  Wogglebug, T.E., and taking a course of his Patent Educational Pills.
<P>
On hearing of Ozma's loss, they started at once for the
Quadling Country to search for her.  As soon as Glinda had left the
Emerald City, Tik-Tok and the Shaggy Man and Jack Pumpkinhead, who had
been present at the conference, began their journey into the Gillikin
Country, and an hour later Ojo and Unc Nunkie joined Dr.  Pipt and
together they traveled toward the Munchkin Country.  When all these
searchers were gone, Dorothy and the Wizard completed their own
preparations.
<P>
The Wizard hitched the Sawhorse to the Red Wagon, which would seat
four very comfortably.  He wanted Dorothy, Betsy, Trot and the
Patchwork Girl to ride in the wagon, but Scraps came up to them
mounted upon the Woozy, and the Woozy said he would like to join the
party.  Now this Woozy was a most peculiar animal, having a square
head, square body, square legs and square tail.  His skin was very
tough and hard, resembling leather, and while his movements were
somewhat clumsy, the beast could travel with remarkable swiftness.
His square eyes were mild and gentle in expression, and he was not
especially foolish.  The Woozy and the Patchwork Girl were great
friends, and so the Wizard agreed to let the Woozy go with them.
<P>
Another great beast now appeared and asked to go along.  This was none
other than the famous Cowardly Lion, one of the most interesting
creatures in all Oz.  No lion that roamed the jungles or plains could
compare in size or intelligence with this Cowardly Lion, who--like all
animals living in Oz--could talk and who talked with more shrewdness
and wisdom than many of the people did.  He said he was cowardly
because he always trembled when he faced danger, but he had faced
danger many times and never refused to fight when it was necessary.
This Lion was a great favorite with Ozma and always guarded her throne
on state occasions.  He was also an old companion and friend of the
Princess Dorothy, so the girl was delighted to have him join the
party.
<P>
"I'm so nervous over our dear Ozma," said the Cowardly Lion in his
deep, rumbling voice, "that it would make me unhappy to remain behind
while you are trying to find her.  But do not get into any danger, I
beg of you, for danger frightens me terribly."
<P>
"We'll not get into danger if we can poss'bly help it," promised
Dorothy, "but we shall do anything to find Ozma, danger or no danger."
<P>
The addition of the Woozy and the Cowardly Lion to the party gave
Betsy Bobbin an idea, and she ran to the marble stables at the rear of
the palace and brought out her mule, Hank by name.  Perhaps no mule
you ever saw was so lean and bony and altogether plain looking as this
Hank, but Betsy loved him dearly because he was faithful and steady
and not nearly so stupid as most mules are considered to be.  Betsy
had a saddle for Hank, and he declared she would ride on his back, an
arrangement approved by the Wizard because it left only four of the
party to ride on the seats of the Red Wagon--Dorothy and Button-Bright
and Trot and himself.
<P>
An old sailor man who had one wooden leg came to see them off and
suggested that they put a supply of food and blankets in the Red Wagon
inasmuch as they were uncertain how long they would be gone.  This
sailor man was called Cap'n Bill.  He was a former friend and comrade
of Trot and had encountered many adventures in company with the little
girl.  I think he was sorry he could not go with her on this trip, but
Glinda the Sorceress had asked Cap'n Bill to remain in the Emerald
City and take charge of the royal palace while everyone else was away,
and the one-legged sailor had agreed to do so.
<P>
They loaded the back end of the Red Wagon with everything they thought
they might need, and then they formed a procession and marched from
the palace through the Emerald City to the great gates of the wall
that surrounded this beautiful capital of the Land of Oz.  Crowds of
citizens lined the streets to see them pass and to cheer them and wish
them success, for all were grieved over Ozma's loss and anxious that
she be found again.  First came the Cowardly Lion, then the Patchwork
Girl riding upon the Woozy, then Betsy Bobbin on her mule Hank, and
finally the Sawhorse drawing the Red Wagon, in which were seated the
Wizard and Dorothy and Button-Bright and Trot.  No one was obliged to
drive the Sawhorse, so there were no reins to his harness; one had
only to tell him which way to go, fast or slow, and he understood
perfectly.
<P>
It was about this time that a shaggy little black dog who had been
lying asleep in Dorothy's room in the palace woke up and discovered he
was lonesome.  Everything seemed very still throughout the great building, 
and Toto--that was the little dog's name--missed the customary chatter 
of the three girls.  He never paid much attention to what was going 
on around him, and although he could speak, he seldom said anything, 
so the little dog did not know about Ozma's loss or that everyone 
had gone in search of her.  But he liked to be with people, and especially 
with his own mistress, Dorothy, and having yawned and stretched 
himself and found the door of the room ajar, he trotted out into the 
corridor and went down the stately marble stairs to the hall of the 
palace, where he met Jellia Jamb.
<P>
"Where's Dorothy?" asked Toto.
<P>
."She's gone to the Winkie Country," answered the maid.
<P>
"When?"
<P>
"A little while ago," replied Jellia.
<P>
Toto turned and trotted out into the palace garden and down the long
driveway until he came to the streets of the Emerald City.  Here he
paused to listen, and hearing sounds of cheering, he ran swiftly along
until he came in sight of the Red Wagon and the Woozy and the Lion and
the Mule and all the others.  Being a wise little dog, he decided not
to show himself to Dorothy just then, lest he be sent back home, but
he never lost sight of the party of travelers, all of whom were so
eager to get ahead that they never thought to look behind them.  When
they came to the gates in the city wall, the Guardian of the Gates
came out to throw wide the golden portals and let them pass through.
<P>
"Did any strange person come in or out of the city on the night before
last when Ozma was stolen?" asked Dorothy.
<P>
"No indeed, Princess," answered the Guardian of the Gates.
<P>
"Of course not," said the Wizard. "Anyone clever enough to steal all
the things we have lost would not mind the barrier of a wall like this
in the least.  I think the thief must have flown through the air, for
otherwise he could not have stolen from Ozma's royal palace and
Glinda's faraway castle in the same night.  Moreover, as there are no
airships in Oz and no way for airships from the outside world to get
into this country, I believe the thief must have flown from place to
place by means of magic arts which neither Glinda nor I understand."
<P>
On they went, and before the gates closed behind them, Toto managed to
dodge through them.  The country surrounding the Emerald City was
thickly settled, and for a while our friends rode over nicely paved
roads which wound through a fertile country dotted with beautiful
houses, all built in the quaint Oz fashion.  In the course of a few
hours, however, they had left the tilled fields and entered the
Country of the Winkies, which occupies a quarter of all the territory
in the Land of Oz but is not so well known as many other parts of
Ozma's fairyland.  Long before night the travelers had crossed the
Winkie River near to the Scarecrow's Tower (which was now vacant) and
had entered the Rolling Prairie where few people live.  They asked
everyone they met for news of Ozma, but none in this district had seen
her or even knew that she had been stolen.  And by nightfall they had
passed all the farmhouses and were obliged to stop and ask for shelter
at the hut of a lonely shepherd.  When they halted, Toto was not far
behind.  The little dog halted, too, and stealing softly around the
party, he hid himself behind the hut.
<P>
The shepherd was a kindly old man and treated the travelers with much
courtesy.  He slept out of doors that night, giving up his hut to the
three girls, who made their beds on the floor with the blankets they
had brought in the Red Wagon.  The Wizard and Button-Bright also slept
out of doors, and so did the Cowardly Lion and Hank the Mule.  But
Scraps and the Sawhorse did not sleep at all, and the Woozy could stay
awake for a month at a time if he wished to, so these three sat in a
little group by themselves and talked together all through the night.
<P>
In the darkness, the Cowardly Lion felt a shaggy little form nestling
beside his own, and he said sleepily, "Where did you come from, Toto?"
<P>
"From home," said the dog. "If you roll over, roll the other way so
you won't smash me."
<P>
"Does Dorothy know you are here?" asked the Lion.
<P>
"I believe not," admitted Toto, and he added a little anxiously, "Do
you think, friend Lion, we are now far enough from the Emerald City
for me to risk showing myself, or will Dorothy send me back because I
wasn't invited?"
<P>
"Only Dorothy can answer that question," said the Lion.  "For my part,
Toto, I consider this affair none of my business, so you must act as
you think best."  Then the huge beast went to sleep again, and Toto
snuggled closer to the warm, hairy body and also slept.  He was a wise
little dog in his way, and didn't intend to worry when there was
something much better to do.
<P>
In the morning the Wizard built a fire, over which the girls cooked a
very good breakfast.  Suddenly Dorothy discovered Toto sitting quietly
before the fire, and the little girl exclaimed, "Goodness me, Toto!
Where did YOU come from?"
<P>
"From the place you cruelly left me," replied the dog in a reproachful
tone.
<P>
"I forgot all about you," admitted Dorothy, "and if I hadn't, I'd
prob'ly left you with Jellia Jamb, seeing this isn't a pleasure trip
but stric'ly business.  But now that you're here, Toto, I s'pose
you'll have to stay with us, unless you'd rather go back again.  We
may get ourselves into trouble before we're done, Toto."
<P>
"Never mind that," said Toto, wagging his tail."I'm hungry,
Dorothy."
<P>
"Breakfas'll soon be ready, and then you shall have your share,"
promised his little mistress, who was really glad to have her dog with
her.  She and Toto had traveled together before, and she knew he was a
good and faithful comrade.
<P>
When the food was cooked and served, the girls invited the old
shepherd to join them in the morning meal.  He willingly consented,
and while they ate he said to them, "You are now about to pass through
a very dangerous country, unless you turn to the north or to the south
to escape its perils."
<P>
"In that case," said the Cowardly Lion, "let us turn, by all means,
for I dread to face dangers of any sort."
<P>
"What's the matter with the country ahead of us?"
 inquired Dorothy.
<P>
"Beyond this Rolling Prairie," explained the shepherd, "are the
Merry-Go-Round Mountains, set close together and surrounded by deep
gulfs so that no one is able to get past them.  Beyond the
Merry-Go-Round Mountains it is said the Thistle-Eaters and the Herkus
live."
<P>
"What are they like?" demanded Dorothy.
<P>
"No one knows, for no one has ever passed the Merry-Go-Round
Mountains," was the reply, "but it is said that the Thistle-Eaters
hitch dragons to their chariots and that the Herkus are waited upon by
giants whom they have conquered and made their slaves."
<P>
"Who says all that?" asked Betsy.
<P>
"It is common report," declared the shepherd.
"Everyone believes it."
<P>
"I don't see how they know," remarked little Trot, "if no one has been
there."
<P>
"Perhaps the birds who fly over that country brought the news,"
suggested Betsy.
<P>
"If you escaped those dangers," continued the shepherd, "you might
encounter others still more serious before you came to the next branch
of the Winkie River.  It is true that beyond that river there lies a
fine country inhabited by good people, and if you reached there, you
would have no further trouble.  It is between here and the west branch
of the Winkie River that all dangers lie, for that is the unknown
territory that is inhabited by terrible, lawless people."
<P>
"It may be, and it may not be," said the Wizard.  "We shall know when
we get there."
<P>
"Well," persisted the shepherd, "in a fairy country such as ours,
every undiscovered place is likely to harbor wicked creatures.  If
they were not wicked, they would discover themselves and by coming
among us submit to Ozma's rule and be good and considerate, as are all
the Oz people whom we know."
<P>
"That argument," stated the little Wizard, "convinces me that it is
our duty to go straight to those unknown places, however dangerous
they may be, for it is surely some cruel and wicked person who has
stolen our Ozma, and we know it would be folly to search among good
people for the culprit.  Ozma may not be hidden in the secret places
of the Winkie Country, it is true, but it is our duty to travel to
every spot, however dangerous, where our beloved Ruler is likely to be
imprisoned."
<P>
"You're right about that," said Button-Bright approvingly.  "Dangers
don't hurt us.  Only things that happen ever hurt anyone, and a danger
is a thing that might happen and might not happen, and sometimes don't
amount to shucks.
<P>
I vote we go ahead and take our chances."
<P>
They were all of the same opinion, so they packed up and said goodbye
to the friendly shepherd and proceeded on their way.
