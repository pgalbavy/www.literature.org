<p>The two scouts carefully descended until they reached the spot
where the dead Apache lay. They moved as noiselessly as shadows
until they stood directly by the inanimate form. Then, while Tom
Hardynge began adjusting his outer garments, Dick Morris stooped
over and drew forth the blanket which was crumpled beneath the
dead warrior.</p>

<p>The Apaches and Comanches and different tribes of the southwest
nearly always carry their blankets with them when traveling, and
when this particular Indian essayed his perilous reconnaissance
on a sultry summer night that garment was flung over his shoulders.
These savages as a rule, do not wear their hair done up in the
defiant scalp-lock form seen among their more northern kindred.
It hangs loosely about their heads and shoulders, being ornamented
with stained feathers, the hair itself frequently daubed with
brilliant paint.</p>

<p>Tom gathered the blanket about him precisely as did the warrior,
and then, his own cap being thrown aside, the feathers were stuck
in among the tresses with all the skill of the veteran warrior.
As he wore leggings the same as the redskin, his <em>tout ensemble</em>
was complete. Beneath his blanket he carried his rifle, pistol
and knife, and even took the tomahawk from the girdle of the fallen
brave, and managed to stow that about his clothing. Even now the
two comrades spoke not a word. They merely shook hands in a silent,
cordial grasp, and almost immediately became invisible to each
other. Dick remained where he was for several minutes, listening
and looking, and then, hearing nothing, moved back toward his
former position, muttering as he went:</p>

<p>"If anybody can get through 'em, Tom's the boy&mdash;but it's a powerful
desprit scheme&mdash;a powerful desprit one!"</p>

<p>Reaching the top, he crawled again to the margin, and stretched
out with his head partly over. Eye-sight was of no avail now,
and he depended upon hearing alone, believing that by that means
he would be able to learn the success or failure of the maneuver.
But not until nearly an hour had passed did he begin to feel anything
like a real hope that his comrade had succeeded.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Tom was doing his best. It was no easy task
for him to pass safely through the Apache lines in the guise of
an Indian. The redskins would be on the lookout for the return
of their scout, and the ordeal through which he would have to
pass would be a much more severe one than usual. But he was accustomed
to desperate schemes, and ready for any sort of encounter. If
discovered immediately, he meant to dash back again up the rocks;
but if he could get any distance away, he would make a determined
effort to elude his enemies altogether.</p>

<p>Following out his plan with the deliberation of a veteran, he
stole slowly downward, consuming fully half an hour before he
reached the base of Hurricane Hill. When, at length, he stood
upon hard ground below, he was taken somewhat back by seeing no
one near him.</p>

<p>"That's queer," he said; "what's become of the skunks?"</p>

<p>He had scarcely uttered the words when a tall form suddenly appeared
at his side, coming up as if he had risen from the very ground.</p>

<p>"Do the hunters sleep?"</p>

<p>This question was asked in pure Apache, and Tom, somewhat distrustful
of his own ability in that line, managed to muffle his blanket
up in front of his mouth as he replied in the same tongue:</p>

<p>"They sleep not."</p>

<p>"Where is their scalps, Mau-tau-ke?"</p>

<p>"On their heads."</p>

<p>The warrior was no more than ten feet distant, and from the moment
the scout detected him he began edging away, the Indian naturally
following along while these words were being uttered, so as to
keep within easy ear-shot. Upon hearing the second reply to his
question, he paused, and Tom, dreading a betrayal, grasped the
handle of his knife under his cloak, and was ready to use it on
the instant. But the Indian remained standing, while Tom, still
moving away in his indifferent manner, soon passed beyond his
view.</p>

<p>"I guess he's stopped to think," was the conclusion of the scout,
as he looked back in the gloom, "and it'll be some time before
he's through."</p>

<p>But the trouble now remained as to how he should pass through
the Apache lines beyond. If the redskins had any suspicion of
any such movement, or if the warrior whom he had just left were
suspicious, serious trouble was at hand.</p>

<p>The hunter sauntered aimlessly along, using his eyes and ears,
and a walk of something over a hundred yards brought him up against
a number of figures that were stretched out and sitting upon the
ground, with several standing near at hand.</p>

<p>They showed no surprise at their "brother's" approach, and he
was confident that, if they didn't undertake to cross-question
him too closely, he stood a good chance of getting through. As
they were gathered too closely at this point he made a turn to
the right, and, to his amazement, not a word was said or the least
notice taken of him, as he walked directly by. That was succeeding,
indeed; but Tom was not yet ready to leave the neighborhood. He
wanted his horse, Thundergust, and, once astride of him, his heart
would be light as a bird; but in looking around he could not discern
a single horse.</p>

<p>It would be useless to attempt to reach Fort Havens on foot.
The Apaches would detect his flight by daylight, which was only
a few hours away, and they could overhaul him before he could
go any distance at all. No, he must have his horse, and he began
his search for him. This was a delicate task; but he prosecuted
it with the same skill and <em>nonchalance</em> that he had displayed
heretofore.</p>

<p>He had stolen along for a short distance, when he descried some
twenty horses corraled and cropping the grass, while a still larger
number were lying on the ground. Was his own among them? he asked
himself, as he stood looking in that direction, while he dimly
discerned the figures of the warriors upon his left. Very cautiously
he gave utterance to a slight whistle. There was no response,
although he suspected it was heard by the redskins themselves.
Then he repeated it several times, walking a little nearer the
group of equines.</p>

<p>All at once one of their number rose from the ground with a faint
whinney, and came trotting toward him. At the same time several
Indians came forward from the main group, their suspicions fairly
awakened by these maneuvers.</p>

<p>One of these suddenly broke into a run, as he descried the mustang
trotting toward the warrior-like figure shrouded in his blanket.
There was no doubt in his mind that something was wrong. The scout
stood like a statue, as though he saw not the approach of the
man or horse. The latter as if distrustful of the shape of things
moved so reluctantly that the redskin beat him in reaching the
goal.</p>

<p>"What means Mau-tau-ke?" he demanded, in a gruff voice, as he
clutched his shoulder. "Is he a dog that&mdash;"</p>

<p>The poor Apache scarcely knew what disposed of him. It was with
the suddenness of the lightning stroke, and, flinging back the
dirty blanket that had enshrouded his form, the scout pointed
his revolvers at the others, fired three shots, accompanied by
a screech loud enough to wake the dead. Then, springing toward
his mustang, he vaulted upon his back, wheeled about, and thundered
away, like the whirlwind across the prairie.</p>

<p>This demonstration was so unexpected and so appalling that the
Apaches were effectually checked for a time. Before they could
recover, mount their horses, and start in pursuit, the fugitive
was beyond their sight. It was useless to pursue, at any rate,
for there was no steed among them all that could overtake the
flying mustang, whose hoofs were plainly heard upon the prairie,
rapidly growing fainter as the distance increased. In a few minutes
it had died out altogether, and, ferocious as was the hatred of
the redskins toward the hunter who had outwitted and injured them
so often, no one made any effort to overhaul him.</p>

<p>Tom Hardynge, every few seconds, let out a regular Apache war-yell,
intended as exultation, taunt and defiance. He could afford it,
for he had triumphed as completely as heart could covet. The magnificent
Thundergust instinctively knew their destination, and the reins
lay loosely upon his neck as he sped away. He was aiming for Fort
Havens. It was a long distance away, and many hours must pass
before its flagstaff could be detected against the far-off horizon.</p>
