<p>Late on a fragrant mid-June afternoon young Seagrave stood on
the Long Terrace to welcome a guest whose advent completed a small
house-party of twelve at Roya-Neh.</p>

<p>"Hello, Duane!" cried the youthful landowner in all the pride
of new possession, as Mallett emerged from the motor; "frightfully
glad to see you, old fellow! How is it in town? Did you bring
your own rods? There are plenty here. What do you think of my
view? Isn't that rather fine?"&mdash;looking down through the trees
at the lake below. "There are bass in it. Those things standing
around under the oaks are only silly English fallow deer. Sorry
I got 'em. What do you think of my house? It's merely a modern
affair worked up to look old and colonial.... Yes, it certainly
does resemble the real thing, but it isn't. No Seagraves fit and
bled here. Those are Geraldine's quarters up there behind the
leaded windows. Those are Kathleen's where the dinky woodbine
twineth. Mine face the east, and yours are next. Come on out into
the park&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Not much!" returned young Mallett. "I want a bath!"</p>

<p>"The park," interrupted Scott excitedly, "is the largest fenced
game-preserve in America! It's only ten minutes to the Sachem's
Gate, if we walk fast."</p>

<p>"I want a bath and fresh linen."</p>

<p>"Don't you care to see the trout? Don't you want to try to catch
a glimpse of a wild boar? I should think you'd be crazy to see&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I'm crazy about almost any old thing when I'm well scrubbed;
otherwise, I'm merely crazy. That was a wild trip up. I'm all
over cinders."</p>

<p>A woman came quietly out onto the terrace, and Duane instantly
divined it, though his back was toward her and her skirts made
no sound.</p>

<p>"Oh, is that you, Kathleen?" he cried, pivoting. "How d'ye do?"
with a vigorous handshake. "Every time I see you you're three
times as pretty as I thought you were when I last saw you."</p>

<p>"Neat but involved," said Kathleen Severn. "You have a streak
of cinder across that otherwise fascinating nose."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it! I'm going. Where's Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"Having her hair done in your honour; return the compliment by
washing your face. There's a maid inside to show you."</p>

<p>"Show me how to wash my face!" exclaimed Duane, delighted. "This
is luxury&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I want him to see the Gray Water before it's too late, with
the sunlight on the trees and the big trout jumping," protested
Scott.</p>

<p>"I'll do my own jumping if you'll furnish the tub," observed
Duane. "Where's that agreeable maid who washes your guests' faces?"</p>

<p>Kathleen nodded an amused dismissal to them. Arm in arm they
entered the house, which was built out of squared blocks of field
stone. Scott motioned the servants aside and did the piloting
himself up a broad stone stairs, east along a wide sunny corridor
full of nooks and angles and antique sofas and potted flowers.</p>

<p>"Not that way," he said; "Dysart is in there taking a nap. Turn
to the left."</p>

<p>"Dysart?" repeated Duane. "I didn't know there was to be anybody
else here."</p>

<p>"I asked Jack Dysart because he's a good rod. Kathleen raised
the deuce about it when I told her, but it was too late. Anyway,
I didn't know she had no use for him. He's certainly clever at
dry-fly casting. He uses pneumatic bodies, not cork or paraffine."</p>

<p>"Is his wife here?" asked Duane carelessly.</p>

<p>"Yes. Geraldine asked her as soon as she heard I'd written to
Jack. But when I told her the next day that I expected you, too,
she got mad all over, and we had a lively talk-fest. What was
there wrong in my having you and the Dysarts here at the same
time? Don't you get on?"</p>

<p>"Charmingly," replied Duane airily.... "It will be very interesting,
I think. Is there anybody else here?"</p>

<p>"Delancy Grandcourt. Isn't he the dead one? But Geraldine wanted
him. And there's that stick of a Quest girl, and Bunbury Gray.
Na√Øda came over this afternoon from the Tappans' at Iron Hill&mdash;thank
goodness&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I didn't know my sister was to be here."</p>

<p>"Yes; and you make twelve, counting Geraldine and me and the
Pink 'uns."</p>

<p>"You didn't tell me it was to be a round-up," repeated Duane,
absently surveying his chintz-hung quarters. "This is a pretty
place you've given me. Where do you get all your electric lights?
Where do you get fancy plumbing in this wilderness?"</p>

<p>"Our own plant," explained the boy proudly. "Isn't that corking
water? Look at it&mdash;heavenly cold and clear, or hot as hell, whichever
way you're inclined&mdash;" turning on a silver spigot chiselled like
a cherub. "That water comes from Cloudy Lake, up there on that
dome-shaped mountain. Here, stand here beside me, Duane, and you
can see it from your window. That's the Gilded Dome&mdash;that big
peak. It's in our park. There are a few elk on it, not many, because
they'd starve out the deer. As it is, we have to cut browse in
winter. For Heaven's sake, hurry, man! Get into your bath and
out again, or we'll miss the trout jumping along Gray Water and
Hurryon Brook."</p>

<p>"Let 'em jump!" retorted Duane, forcibly ejecting his host from
the room and locking the door. Then, lighting a cigarette, he
strolled into the bath room and started the water running into
the porcelain tub.</p>

<p>He was in excellent spirits, quite undisturbed by the unexpected
proximity of Rosalie Dysart or the possible renewal of their hitherto
slightly hazardous friendship. He laid his cigarette aside for
the express purpose of whistling while undressing.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, bathed, shaved, and sartorially freshened,
he selected a blue corn-flower from the rural bouquet on his dresser,
drew it through his buttonhole, gave a last alluring twist to
his tie, surveyed himself in the mirror, whistled a few bars,
was perfectly satisfied with himself, then, unlocking the door,
strolled out into the corridor. Having no memory for direction,
he took the wrong turn.</p>

<p>A distractingly pretty maid laid aside her sewing and rose from
her chair to set him right; he bestowed upon her his most courtly
thanks. She was unusually pretty, so he thanked her again, and
she dimpled, one hand fingering her apron's edge.</p>

<p>"My child," said he gravely, "are you by any fortunate chance
as good as you are ornamental?"</p>

<p>She replied that she thought she was.</p>

<p>"In that case," he said, "this is one of those rare occasions
in a thankless world where goodness is amply and instantly rewarded."</p>

<p>She made a perfunctory resistance, but looked after him, smiling,
as he sauntered off down the hallway, rearranging the blue corn-flower
in his button-hole. At the turn by the window, where potted posies
stood, he encountered Rosalie Dysart in canoe costume&mdash;sleeves
rolled up, hair loosened, becomingly tanned, and entirely captivating
in her thoughtfully arranged disarray.</p>

<p>"Why, Duane!" she exclaimed, offering both her hands with that
impulsively unstudied gesture she carefully cultivated for such
occasions.</p>

<p>He took them; he always took what women offered.</p>

<p>"This is very jolly," he said, retaining the hands and examining
her with unfeigned admiration. "Tell me, Mrs. Dysart, are you
by any fortunate chance as good as you are ornamental?"</p>

<p>"I heard you ask that of the maid around the corner," said Rosalie
coolly. "Don't let the bucolic go to your head, Mr. Mallett."
And she disengaged her hands, crossed them behind her, and smiled
back at him. It was his punishment. Her hands were very pretty
hands, and well worth holding.</p>

<p>"That maid," he said gravely, "has excellent manners. I merely
complimented her upon them.... What else did you&mdash;ah&mdash;hear, Mrs.
Dysart?"</p>

<p>"What one might expect to hear wherever you are concerned. I
don't mind. The things you do rather gracefully seem only offensive
when other men do them.... Have you just arrived?"</p>

<p>"An hour ago. Did you know I was coming?"</p>

<p>"Geraldine mentioned it to everybody, but I don't think anybody
swooned at the news.... My husband is here."</p>

<p>She still confronted him, hands behind her, with an audacity
which challenged&mdash;her whole being was always a delicate and perpetual
challenge. There are such women. Over her golden-brown head the
late summer sunlight fell, outlining her full, supple figure and
bared arms with a rose light.</p>

<p>"Well?" she asked.</p>

<p>"If only you <em>were</em> as good as you are ornamental," he
said, looking at her impudently. "But I'm afraid you're not."</p>

<p>"What would happen to me if I were?"</p>

<p>"Why," he said with innocent enthusiasm, "you would have <em>your</em>
reward, too, Mrs. Dysart."</p>

<p>"The sort of reward which I heard you bestow a few moments ago
upon that maid? I'm no longer the latter, so I suppose I'm not
entitled to it, am I?"</p>

<p>The smile still edged her pretty mouth; there was an instant
when matters looked dubious for her; but a door opened somewhere,
and, still smiling, she slipped by him and vanished into a neighbouring
corridor.</p>

<p>Howker, the old butler, met him at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Tea is served on the Long Terrace, sir. Mr. Seagrave wishes
to know whether you would care to see the trout jumping on the
Gray Water this evening? If so, you are please not to stop for
tea, but go directly to the Sachem's Gate. Redmond will guide
you, sir."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'This is one of those rare occasions ... where
goodness is amply ... rewarded.'"]</p>

<p>"All right, Howker," said Duane absently; and strolled on along
the hall, thinking of Mrs. Dysart.</p>

<p>The front doors swung wide, opening on the Long Terrace, which
looked out across a valley a hundred feet below, where a small
lake glimmered as still as a mirror against a background of golden
willows and low green mountains.</p>

<p>There were a number of young people pretending to take tea on
the terrace; and some took it, and others took other things. He
knew them all, and went forward to greet them. Geraldine Seagrave,
a new and bewitching coat of tan tinting cheek and neck, held
out her hand with all the engaging frankness of earlier days.
Her clasp was firm, cool, and nervously cordial&mdash;the old confident
affection of childhood once more.</p>

<p>"I am <em>so</em> glad you came, Duane. I've really missed you."
And sweeping the little circle with an eager glance; "You know
everybody, I think. The Dysarts have not yet appeared, and Scott
is down at the Gate Lodge. Come and sit by me, Duane."</p>

<p>Two or three girls extended their hands to him &mdash;Sylvia
Quest, shy and quiet; Muriel Wye, white-skinned, black-haired,
red-lipped, red-cheeked, with eyes like melted sapphires and the
expression of a reckless saint; and his blond sister, Na√Øda, who
had arrived that afternoon from the Tappans' at Iron Hill, across
the mountain.</p>

<p>Delancy Grandcourt, uncouth and highly coloured, stood up to
shake hands; Bunbury Gray, a wiry, bronzed little polo-playing
squadron man, hailed Duane with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Awfully glad to see you, Bunny," said Duane, who liked him immensely&mdash;"oh,
how are you?" offering his hand to Reginald Wye, a hard-riding,
hard-drinking, straight-shooting young man, who knew nothing on
earth except what concerned sport and the drama. He and his sister
of the sapphire eyes and brilliant cheeks were popularly known
as the Pink 'uns.</p>

<p>Jack Dysart arrived presently, graceful, supple, always smilingly,
elaborate of manner, apparently unconscious that he was not cordially
admired by the men who returned his greeting. Later, Rosalie,
came, enchantingly demure in her Greuze-like beauty. Chardin might
have made her; possibly Fragonard. She did not resemble the Creator's
technique. Dresden teacups tinkled, ice clattered in tall glasses,
the two fountains splashed away bravely, prettily modulated voices
made agreeable harmony on the terrace, blending with the murmur
of leaves overhead as the wind stirred them to gossip. Over all
spread a calm evening sky.</p>

<p>"Tea, dear?" asked Geraldine, glancing up at Mrs. Dysart. Rosalie
shook her head with a smile.</p>

<p>Lang, the second man, was flitting about, busy with a decanter
of Scotch. A moment later Rosalie signified her preference for
it with a slight nod. Geraldine, who sat watching indifferently
the filling of Mrs. Dysart's glass, suddenly leaned back and turned
her head sharply, as though the aroma from glass and decanter
were distasteful to her. In a few minutes she rose, walked over
to the parapet, and stood leaning against the coping, apparently
absorbed in the landscape.</p>

<p>The sun hung low over the flat little tree-clad mountains, which
the lake, now inlaid with pink and gold, reflected. A few fallow
deer moved quietly down there, ruddy spots against the turf.</p>

<p>Duane, carrying his glass with him, rose and stepped across the
strip of grass to her side, and, glancing askance at her, was
on the point of speaking when he discovered that her eyes were
shut and her face colourless and rigid.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked surprised. "Are you feeling faint, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>She opened her eyes, velvet dark and troubled, but did not turn
around.</p>

<p>"It's nothing," she answered calmly. "I was thinking of several
things."</p>

<p>"You look so white&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I am perfectly well. Bend over the parapet with me, Duane. Look
at those rocks down there. What a tumble! What a death!"</p>

<p>He placed his glass between them on the coping, and leaned over.
She did not notice the glass for a moment. Suddenly she wheeled,
as though he had spoken, and her eyes fell on the glass.</p>

<p>"What <em>is</em> the matter?" he demanded, as she turned on
her heel and moved away.</p>

<p>"I'm a trifle nervous, I believe. If you want to see the big
trout breaking on Hurryon, you'd better come with me."</p>

<p>She was walking swiftly down the drive to the south of the house.
He overtook her and fell into slower step beside her.</p>

<p>The sun had almost disappeared behind the mountains; bluish haze
veiled the valley; a horizon of dazzling yellow flecked with violet
faded upward to palest turquoise. High overhead a feathered cloud
hung, tinged with rose.</p>

<p>The south drive was bordered deep in syringas, all over snowy
bloom; and as they passed they inhaled the full fragrance of the
flowers with every breath.</p>

<p>"It's like heaven," said Duane; "and you are not incongruous
in the landscape, either."</p>

<p>She looked around at him; the smile that curved her mouth had
the faintest suspicion of tenderness about it.</p>

<p>She said slowly:</p>

<p>"Do you realise that I am genuinely glad to see you? I've been
horrid to you. I don't yet really believe in you, Duane. I detest
some of the things you are and say and do; but, after all, I've
missed you. Incredible as it sounds, I've been a little lonely
without you."</p>

<p>He said gaily: "When a woman becomes accustomed to chasing the
family cat out of the parlour with the broom, she misses the sport
when the cat migrates permanently."</p>

<p>"Have you migrated&mdash;permanently? O Duane! I thought you <em>did</em>
care for me&mdash;in your own careless fashion&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I do. But I'm not hopelessly enamoured of your broom-stick!"</p>

<p>Her laugh was a little less spontaneous, as she answered:</p>

<p>"I know I have been rather free with my broom. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"You <em>have</em> made some sweeping charges on that cat!" he
said, laughing.</p>

<p>"I know I have. That was two months ago. I don't think I am the
morally self-satisfied prig I was two months ago.... I'd be easier
on anything now, even a cat. But don't think I mean more than
I do mean, Duane," she added hastily. "I've missed you a little.
I want you to be nice to me.... After all, you're the oldest friend
I have except Kathleen."</p>

<p>"I'll be as nice as you'll let me," he said. They turned from
the driveway and entered a broad wood road. "As nice as you'll
let me," he repeated.</p>

<p>"I won't let you be sentimental, if that's what you mean," she
observed.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because you are you."</p>

<p>"In a derogatory sense?"</p>

<p>"Somewhat. I might be like you if I were a man, and had your
easy, airy, inconsequential way with women. But I won't let you
have it with me, my casual friend. Don't hope for it."</p>

<p>"What have I ever done&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Exactly what you're doing now to Rosalie&mdash;what you did to a
dozen women this winter&mdash;what you did to me"&mdash;she turned and looked
at him&mdash;"the first time I ever set eyes on you since we were children
together. I know you are not to be taken seriously; almost everybody
knows that! And all the same, Duane, I've thought about you a
lot in these two months up here, and &mdash;I'm happy that you've
come at last.... You won't mistake me and try to be sentimental
with me, will you?"</p>

<p>She laid her slim, sun-tanned hand on his arm; they walked on
together through the woodland where green bramble sprays glimmered
through clustering tree trunks and the fading light turned foliage
and undergrowth to that vivid emerald which heralds dusk.</p>

<p>"Duane," she said, "I'm dreadfully restless and I cannot account
for it.... Perhaps motherless girls are never quite normal; I
don't know. But, lately, the world has seemed very big and threatening
around me.... Scott is nice to me, usually; Kathleen adorable....
I &mdash;I don't know what I want, what it is I miss."</p>

<p>Her hand still rested lightly on his arm as they walked forward.
She was speaking at intervals almost as though talking in an undertone
to herself:</p>

<p>"I'm in&mdash;perplexity. I've been troubled. Perhaps that is what
makes me tolerant of you; perhaps that's why I'm glad to see you....
Trouble is a new thing to me. I thought I had troubles&mdash;perhaps
I had as a child. But this is deeper, different, disquieting."</p>

<p>"Are you in love?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Really."</p>

<p>"Then what&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you. Anyway, it won't last. It can't, ... Can it?"</p>

<p>She looked around at him, and they both laughed a little at her
inconsequence.</p>

<p>"I feel better for pretending to tell you, anyway," she said,
as they halted before high iron gates hung between two granite
posts from which the woven wire fence of the game park, ten feet
high, stretched away into the darkening woods on either hand.</p>

<p>"This is the Sachem's Gate," she said; "here is the key; unlock
it, please."</p>

<p>Inside they crossed a stream dashing between tanks set with fern
and tall silver birches.</p>

<p>"Hurryon Brook," she said. "Isn't it a beauty? It pours into
the Gray Water a little farther ahead. We must hasten, or it will
be too dark to see the trout."</p>

<p>Twice again they crossed the rushing brook on log bridges. Then
through the trees stretching out before them they caught sight
of the Gray Water, crinkling like a flattened sheet of hammered
silver.</p>

<p>Everywhere the surface was starred and ringed and spattered by
the jumping fish; and now they could hear them far out, splash!
slap! clip-clap! splash!&mdash;hundreds and hundreds jumping incessantly,
so that the surface of the water was constantly broken over the
entire expanse.</p>

<p>Now and then some great trout, dark against the glimmer, leaped
full length into the air; everywhere fish broke, swirled, or rolled
over, showing "colour."</p>

<p>"There is Scott," she whispered, attuning her voice to the forest
quiet&mdash;"out there in that canoe. No, he hasn't taken his rod;
he seldom does; he's perfectly crazy over things of this sort.
All day and half the night he's out prowling about the woods,
not fishing, not shooting, just mousing around and listening and
looking. And for all his dreadfully expensive collection of arms
and rods, he uses them very little. See him out there drifting
about with the fish breaking all around&mdash;some within a foot of
his canoe! He'll never come in to dress for dinner unless we call
him."</p>

<p>And she framed her mouth with both hands and sent a long, clear
call floating out across the Gray Water.</p>

<p>"All right; I'll come!" shouted her brother. "Wait a moment!"</p>

<p>They waited many moments. Dusk, lurking in the forest, peered
out, casting a gray net over shore and water. A star quivered,
another, then ten, and scores and myriads.</p>

<p>They had found a seat on a fallen log; neither seemed to have
very much to say. For a while the steady splashing of the fish
sounded like the uninterrupted music of a distant woodland waterfall.
Suddenly it ceased as if by magic. Not another trout rose; the
quiet was absolute.</p>

<p>"Is not this stillness delicious?" she breathed.</p>

<p>"It is sweeter when you break it."</p>

<p>"Please don't say such things.... <em>Can't</em> you understand
how much I want you to be sincere to me? Lately, I don't know
why, I've seemed to feel so isolated. When you talk that way I
feel more so. <em>I&mdash;</em>just want&mdash;a friend."</p>

<p>There was a silence; then he said lightly:</p>

<p>"I've felt that way myself. The more friends I make the more
solitary I seem to be. Some people are fashioned for a self-imprisonment
from which they can't break out, and through which no one can
penetrate. But I never thought of you as one of those."</p>

<p>"I seem to be at times&mdash;not exactly isolated, but unable to get
close to&mdash;to Kathleen, for example. Do you know, Duane, it might
be very good for me to have you to talk to."</p>

<p>"People usually like to talk to me. I've noticed it. But the
curious part of it is that they have nothing to give me in exchange
for my attention."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>He laughed. "Oh, nothing. I amuse people; I know it. You&mdash;and
everybody&mdash;say I am all cleverness and froth&mdash;not to be taken
seriously. But did it ever occur to you that what you see in me
you evoke. Shallowness provokes shallowness, levity, lightness,
inconsequence&mdash;all are answered by their own echo.... And you
and the others think it is I who answer."</p>

<p>He laughed, not looking at her:</p>

<p>"And it happens that you&mdash;and the others&mdash;are mistaken. If I
appear to be what you say I am, it is merely a form of self-defence.
Do you think I could endure the empty nonsense of a New York winter
if I did not present to it a surface like a sounding-board and
let Folly converse with its own echo&mdash;while, behind it, underneath
it, Duane Mallett goes about his own business."</p>

<p>Astonished, not clearly understanding, she listened in absolute
silence. Never in all her life had she heard him speak in such
a manner. She could not make out whether bitterness lay under
his light and easy speech, whether a maliciously perverse humour
lurked there, whether it was some new mockery.</p>

<p>He said carelessly: "I give what I receive. And I have never
received any very serious attention from anybody. I'm only Duane
Mallett, identified with the wealthy section of society you inhabit,
the son of a wealthy man, who went abroad and dabbled in colour
and who paints pictures of pretty women. Everybody and the newspapers
know me. What I see of women is a polished coquetry that mirrors
my fixed smirk; what I see of men is less interesting."</p>

<p>He looked out through the dusk at the darkening water:</p>

<p>"You say you are beginning to feel isolated. Can anybody with
any rudiment of intellect feel otherwise in the social environment
you and I inhabit&mdash;where distinction and inherited position count
for absolutely nothing unless propped up by wealth&mdash;where any
ass is tolerated whose fortune and lineage pass inspection&mdash;where
there is no place for intelligence and talent, even when combined
with breeding and lineage, unless you are properly ballasted with
money enough to forget that you have any?"</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"So you feel isolated? I do, too. And I'm going to get out. I'm
tired of decorating a set where the shuttle-cock of conversation
is worn thin, frayed, ragged! Where the battledore is fashionable
scandal and the players half dead with ennui and their neighbour's
wives&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Duane!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, you're a world-wise graduate at twenty-two! Truth
won't shock you, more's the pity.... As for the game &mdash;I'm
done with it; I can't stand it. The amusement I extract doesn't
pay. Good God! and you wonder why I kiss a few of you for distraction's
sake, press a finger-tip or two, brush a waist with my sleeve!"</p>

<p>He laughed unpleasantly, and bent forward in the darkness, clasped
hands hanging between his knees.</p>

<p>"Duane," she said in astonishment, "what do you mean? Are you
trying to quarrel with me, just when, for the first time, something
in this new forest country seemed to be drawing us together, making
us the comrades we once were?"</p>

<p>"We're too old to be comrades. That's book rubbish. Men and women
have nothing in common, intellectually, unless they're in love.
For company, for straight conversation, for business, for sport,
a man would rather be with men. And either you and I are like
everybody else or we're going to really care for each other. Not
for your pretty face and figure, or for my grin, my six feet,
and thin shanks; I can care for face and figure in any woman.
What's the use of marrying for what you'll scarcely notice in
a month?... If you <em>are you</em>, Geraldine, under all your
attractive surface there's something else which you have never
given me."</p>

<p>"Wh&mdash;what?" she asked faintly.</p>

<p>"Intelligent interest in me."</p>

<p>"Do you mean," she said slowly, "that you think I underestimate
you?"</p>

<p>"Not as I am. I don't amount to much; but I might if you cared."</p>

<p>"Cared for you?"</p>

<p>"No, confound it! Cared for what I could be."</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I don't think I understand. What could you be?"</p>

<p>"A man, for one thing. I'm a thing that dances. A fashionable
portrait painter for another. The combination is horrible."</p>

<p>"You are a successful painter."</p>

<p>"Am I? Geraldine, in all the small talk you and I have indulged
in since my return from abroad, have you ever asked me one sincere,
intelligent, affectionate question about my work?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>yes&mdash;but I don't know anything about&#11834;"</p>

<p>He laughed, and it hurt her.</p>

<p>"Don't you understand," she said, "that ordinary people are very
shy about talking art to a professional&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I don't want you to talk art. Any little thing with blue eyes
and blond curls can do it. I wanted you to see what I do, say
what you think, like it or damn it&mdash;only do something about it!
You've never been to my studio except to stand with the perfumed
crowd and talk commonplaces in front of a picture."</p>

<p>"I can't go alone."</p>

<p>"Can't you?" he asked, looking closely at her in the dusk, so
close that she could see every mocking feature.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said in a low, surprised voice, "I could go alone&mdash;anywhere&mdash;with
you.... I didn't realise it before, Duane."</p>

<p>"You never tried. You once mistook an impulse of genuine passion
for the sort of thing I've done since. You made a terrific fuss
about being kissed when I saw, as soon as I saw you, that I wanted
to win you, if you'd let me. Since then you've chosen the key-note
of our relations, not I, and you don't like my interpretation
of my part."</p>

<p>For a while she sat silent, preoccupied with this totally new
revelation of a man about whom she supposed she had long ago made
up her mind.</p>

<p>"I'm glad we've had this talk," she said at last.</p>

<p>"I am, too. I haven't asked you to fall in love with me; I haven't
asked for your confidence. I've asked you to take an intelligent,
affectionate interest in what I might become, and perhaps you
and I won't be so lonely if you do."</p>

<p>He struck a match in the darkness and lighted a cigarette. Close
inshore Scott Seagrave's electric torch flashed. They heard the
velvety scraping of the canoe, the rattle and thump as he flung
it, bottom upward, on the sandy point.</p>

<p>"Hello, you people! Where are you?"&mdash;sweeping the wood's edge
with his flash-light&mdash;"oh, there you are. Isn't this glorious?
Did you ever see such a sight as those big fellows jumping?"</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," said his sister, rising, "our guests are doubtless
yelling with hunger. What time is it, Duane? Half-past eight?
Please hurry, Scott; we've got to get back and dress in five minutes!"</p>

<p>"I can do it easily," announced her brother, going ahead to light
the path. And all the way home he discussed aloud upon the stripping,
hatching, breeding, care, and diseases of trout, never looking
back, and quite confident that they were listening attentively
to his woodland lecture.</p>

<p>"Duane," she said, lowering her voice, "do you think all our
misunderstandings are ended?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied gaily. "Don't you?"</p>

<p>"But how am I going to make everybody think you are not frivolous?"</p>

<p>"I am frivolous. There's lots of froth to me&mdash;on top. You know
that sort of foam you see on grass-stems in the fields. Hidden
away inside is a very clever and busy little creature. He uses
the froth to protect himself."</p>

<p>"Are you going to froth?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;until&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Until what?"</p>

<p>"You&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"Shall I say it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then, unless you and I find each other intellectually
satisfactory."</p>

<p>"You said only a man&mdash;in love with a woman&mdash;could find her interesting
in that way."</p>

<p>"Yes. What of it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing.... Only I'm afraid you'll have to froth, then," she
said, laughing. "I haven't any intention of falling in love with
you, Duane, and you'll find me stupid if I don't. Do you know
that what you intimate is very horrid?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. Besides, it's a sort of threat&#11834;"</p>

<p>"A threat?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. You threaten to&mdash;you know perfectly well what you
threaten to do unless I immediately consider the possibility of
our&mdash;caring for each other&mdash;sentimentally."</p>

<p>"But what do you care if you don't care?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't. All the same it's horrid and&mdash;and unfair.
Suppose I was frothy and behaved&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Misbehaved?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Just because you wouldn't agree to take a sentimental interest
in me?"</p>

<p>"I <em>would</em> agree! I'll agree now!"</p>

<p>"Suppose you wouldn't?"</p>

<p>"I can't imagine&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Duane, be honest! And I'll tell you flatly&mdash;if you do misbehave.
Just because I don't particularly desire to rush into your arms&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But I haven't threatened to."</p>

<p>Unconsciously she laid her hand on his arm again, slipping it
a little way under.</p>

<p>"You're just as you were years ago&mdash;just the dearest of playmates.
We're not too old to play, are we?"</p>

<p>"I can't with you; it's too dangerous."</p>

<p>"What nonsense! Yes, you can. You like me for my intelligence
in spite of what you say about men and women&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't care for your intelligence if I were not in&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Duane, stop, please!"</p>

<p>"In danger," he continued blandly, "of proving my proposition."</p>

<p>"You are insufferable. I am as intelligent as you."</p>

<p>"I know it, but it wouldn't attract me unless&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It ought to," she said hastily. "And, Duane, I'm going to make
you take me into account. I'm going to exercise a man's privilege
with you by&mdash;by saying frankly&mdash;several things&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What things?"</p>

<p>The amused mockery in his voice gave her courage.</p>

<p>"For one thing, I'm going to tell you that people&mdash;gossip&mdash;that
there are&mdash;are&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Rumours?" he asked in pretended anxiety.</p>

<p>"Yes.... About you and&mdash;of course they are silly and contemptible;
but what's the use of being attentive enough to a woman&mdash;careless
enough to give colour to them?"</p>

<p>After an interval he said: "Perhaps you'll tell me who beside
myself these rumours concern?"</p>

<p>"You know, don't you?"</p>

<p>"There might be several," he said coolly. "Who is it?"</p>

<p>For a moment a tiny flash of anger made her cheeks hot. Then
she said:</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well it's Rosalie. I think we have become
good enough comrades for me to use a man's privilege&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Men wouldn't permit themselves that sort of privilege," he said,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Aren't men frank with their friends?" she demanded hotly.</p>

<p>"About as frank as women."</p>

<p>"I thought&mdash;" She hesitated, tingling with the old desire to
hurt him, flick him in the raw, make him wince in his exasperating
complacency. Then, "I've said it anyhow. I'm trying to show an
interest in you&mdash;as you asked me to do&#11834;"</p>

<p>He turned in the darkness, caught her hand:</p>

<p>"You dear little thing," he whispered, laughing.</p>
