<P>
HAVING warmed his feet to his own entire satisfaction, Horace
turned round from the fireplace, and discovered that he and Lady
Janet were alone.
<P>
"Can I see Grace?" he asked.
<P>
The easy tone in which he put the question--a tone, as it were,
of proprietorship in "Grace"--jarred on Lady Janet at the moment.
For the first time in her life she found herself comparing Horace
with Julian--to Horace's disadvantage. He was rich; he was a
gentleman of ancient lineage; he bore an unblemished character.
But who had the strong brain? who had the great heart? Which was
the Man of the two?
<P>
"Nobody can see her," answered Lady Janet. "Not even you!"
<P>
The tone of the reply was sharp, with a dash of irony in it. But
where is the modern young man, possessed of health and an
independ ent income, who is capable of understanding that irony
can be presumptuous enough to address itself to _him?_ Horace
(with perfect politeness) declined to consider himself answered.
<P>
"Does your ladyship mean that Miss Roseberry is in bed?" he
asked.
<P>
"I mean that Miss Roseberry is in her room. I mean that I have
twice tried to persuade Miss Roseberry to dress and come
downstairs, and tried in vain. I mean that what Miss Roseberry
refuses to do for Me, she is not likely to do for You--"
<P>
How many more meanings of her own Lady Janet might have gone on
enumerating, it is not easy to calculate. At her third sentence a
sound in the library caught her ear through the incompletely
closed door and suspended the next words on her lips. Horace
heard it also. It was the rustling sound (traveling nearer and
nearer over the library carpet) of a silken dress.
<P>
(In the interval while a coming event remains in a state of
uncertainty, what is it the inevitable tendency of every
Englishman under thirty to do? His inevitable tendency is to ask
somebody to bet on the event. He can no more resist it than he
can resist lifting his stick or his umbrella, in the absence of a
gun, and pretending to shoot if a bird flies by him while he is
out for a walk.)
<P>
"What will your ladyship bet that this is not Grace?" cried
Horace.
<P>
Her ladyship took no notice of the proposal; her attention
remained fixed on the library door. The rustling sound stopped
for a moment. The door was softly pushed open. The false Grace
Roseberry entered the room.
<P>
Horace advanced to meet her, opened his lips to speak, and
stopped--struck dumb by the change in his affianced wife since he
had seen her last. Some terrible oppression seemed to have
crushed her. It was as if she had actually shrunk in height as
well as in substance. She walked more slowly than usual; she
spoke more rarely than usual, and in a lower tone. To those who
had seen her before the fatal visit of the stranger from
Mannheim, it was the wreck of the woman that now appeared instead
of the woman herself. And yet there was the old charm still
surviving through it all; the grandeur of the head and eyes, the
delicate symmetry of the features, the unsought grace of every
movement--in a word, the unconquerable beauty which suffering
cannot destroy, and which time itself is powerless to wear out.
Lady Janet advanced, and took her with hearty kindness by both
hands.
<P>
"My dear child, welcome among us again! You have come down stairs
to please me?"
<P>
She bent her head in silent acknowledgment that it was so. Lady
Janet pointed to Horace: "Here is somebody who has been longing
to see you, Grace."
<P>
She never looked up; she stood submissive, her eyes fixed on a
little basket of colored wools which hung on her arm. "Thank you,
Lady Janet," she said, faintly. "Thank you, Horace."
<P>
Horace placed her arm in his, and led her to the sofa. She
shivered as she took her seat, and looked round her. It was the
first time she had seen the dining-room since the day when she
had found herself face to face with the dead-alive.
<P>
"Why do you come here, my love?" asked Lady Janet. "The
drawing-room would have been a warmer and a pleasanter place for
you."
<P>
"I saw a carriage at the front door. I was afraid of meeting with
visitors in the drawing-room."
<P>
As she made that reply, the servant came in, and announced the
visitors' names. Lady Janet sighed wearily. "I must go and get
rid of them," she said, resigning herself to circumstances. "What
will _you_ do, Grace?"
<P>
"I will stay here, if you please."
<P>
"I will keep her company," added Horace.
<P>
Lady Janet hesitated. She had promised to see her nephew in the
dining-room on his return to the house--and to see him alone.
Would there be time enough to get rid of the visitors and to
establish her adopted daughter in the empty drawing-room before
Julian appeared? It was ten minutes' walk to the lodge, and he
had to make the gate-keeper understand his instructions. Lady
Janet decided that she had time enough at her disposal. She
nodded kindly to Mercy, and left her alone with her lover.
<P>
Horace seated himself in the vacant place on the sofa. So far as
it was in his nature to devote himself to any one he was devoted
to Mercy. "I am grieved to see how you have suffered," he said,
with honest distress in his face as he looked at her. "Try to
forget what has happened."
<P>
"I am trying to forget. Do _you_ think of it much?"
<P>
"My darling, it is too contemptible to be thought of."
<P>
She placed her work-basket on her lap. Her wasted fingers began
absently sorting the wools inside.
<P>
"Have you seen Mr. Julian Gray?" she asked, suddenly.
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"What does _he_ say about it?" She looked at Horace for the first
time, steadily scrutinizing his face. Horace took refuge in
prevarication.
<P>
"I really haven't asked for Julian's opinion," he said.
<P>
She looked down again, with a sigh, at the basket on her
lap--considered a little--and tried him once more.
<P>
"Why has Mr. Julian Gray not been here for a whole week?" she
went on. "The servants say he has been abroad. Is that true?"
<P>
It was useless to deny it. Horace admitted that the servants were
right.
<P>
Her fingers, suddenly stopped at their restless work among the
wools; her breath quickened perceptibly. What had Julian Gray
been doing abroad? Had he been making inquiries? Did he alone, of
all the people who saw that terrible meeting, suspect her? Yes!
His was the finer intelligence; his was a clergyman's (a London
clergyman's) experience of frauds and deceptions, and of the
women who were guilty of them. Not a doubt of it now! Julian
suspected her.
<P>
"When does he come back?" she asked, in tones so low that Horace
could barely hear her.
<P>
"He has come back already. He returned last night."
<P>
A faint shade of color stole slowly over the pallor of her face.
She suddenly put her basket away, and clasped her hands together
to quiet the trembling of them, before she asked her next
question.
<P>
"Where is--" She paused to steady her voice. "Where is the
person," she resumed, "who came here and frightened me?"
<P>
Horace hastened to re-assure her. "The person will not come
again," he said. "Don't talk of her! Don't think of her!"
<P>
She shook her head. "There is something I want to know," she
persisted. "How did Mr. Julian Gray become acquainted with her?"
<P>
This was easily answered. Horace mentioned the consul at
Mannheim, and the letter of introduction. She listened eagerly,
and said her next words in a louder, firmer tone.
<P>
"She was quite a stranger, then, to Mr. Julian Gray--before
that?"
<P>
"Quite a stranger," Horace replied. "No more questions--not
another word about her, Grace! I forbid the subject. Come, my own
love!" he said, taking her hand and bending over her tenderly,
"rally your spirits! We are young--we love each other--now is our
time to be happy!"
<P>
Her hand turned suddenly cold, and trembled in his. Her head sank
with a helpless weariness on her breast. Horace rose in alarm.
<P>
"You are cold--you are faint, "he said. "Let me get you a glass
of wine!--let me mend the fire!"
<P>
The decanters were still on the luncheon-table. Horace insisted
on her drinking some port-wine. She barely took half the contents
of the wine-glass. Even that little told on her sensitive
organization; it roused her sinking energies of body and mind.
After watching her anxiously, without attracting her notice,
Horace left her again to attend to the fire at the other end of
the room. Her eyes followed him slowly with a hard and tearless
despair. "Rally your spirits," she repeated to herself in a
whisper. "My spirits! O God!" She looked round her at the luxury
and beauty of the room, as those look who take their leave of
familiar scenes. The moment after, her eyes sank, and rested on
the rich dress that she wore a gift from Lady Janet. She thought
of the past; she thought of the future. Was the time near when
she would be back again in the Refuge, or back again in the
streets?--she who had been Lady Janet's adopted daughter, and
Horace Holmcroft's betrothed wife! A sudden frenzy of
recklessness seized on her as she thought of the coming end.
Horace was right! Why not rally her spirits? Why not make the
most of her time? The l ast hours of her life in that house were
at hand. Why not enjoy her stolen position while she could?
"Adventuress!" whispered the mocking spirit within her, "be true
to your character. Away with your remorse! Remorse is the luxury
of an honest woman." She caught up her basket of wools, inspired
by a new idea. "Ring the bell!" she cried out to Horace at the
fire-place.
<P>
He looked round in wonder. The sound of her voice was so
completely altered that he almost fancied there must have been
another woman in the room.
<P>
"Ring the bell!" she repeated. "I have left my work upstairs. If
you want me to be in good spirits, I must have my work."
<P>
Still looking at her, Horace put his hand mechanically to the
bell and rang. One of the men-servants came in.
<P>
"Go upstairs and ask my maid for my work," she said, sharply.
Even the man was taken by surprise: it was her habit to speak to
the servants with a gentleness and consideration which had long
since won all their hearts. "Do you hear me?" she asked,
impatiently. The servant bowed, and went out on his errand. She
turned to Horace with flashing eyes and fevered cheeks.
<P>
"What a comfort it is," she said, "to belong to the upper
classes! A poor woman has no maid to dress her, and no footman to
send upstairs. Is life worth having, Horace, on less than five
thousand a year?"
<P>
The servant returned with a strip of embroidery. She took it with
an insolent grace, and told him to bring her a footstool. The man
obeyed. She tossed the embroidery away from her on the sofa. "On
second thoughts, I don't care about my work," she said. "Take it
upstairs again." The perfectly trained servant, marveling
privately, obeyed once more. Horace, in silent astonishment,
advanced to the sofa to observe her more nearly. "How grave you
look!" she exclaimed, with an air of flippant unconcern. "You
don't approve of my sitting idle, perhaps? Anything to please
you! _I_ haven't got to go up and downstairs. Ring the bell
again."
<P>
"My dear Grace," Horace remonstrated, gravely, "you are quite
mistaken. I never even thought of your work."
<P>
"Never mind; it's inconsistent to send for my work, and then send
it away again. Ring the bell."
<P>
Horace looked at her without moving. "Grace," he said, "what has
come to you?"
<P>
"How should I know?" she retorted, carelessly. "Didn't you tell
me to rally my spirits? Will you ring the bell, or must I?"
<P>
Horace submitted. He frowned as he walked back to the bell. He
was one of the many people who instinctively resent anything that
is new to them. This strange outbreak was quite new to him. For
the first time in his life he felt sympathy for a servant, when
the much-enduring man appeared once more.
<P>
"Bring my work back; I have changed my mind." With that brief
explanation she reclined luxuriously on the soft sofa-cushions,
swinging one of her balls of wool to and fro above her head, and
looking at it lazily as she lay back. "I have a remark to make,
Horace," she went on, when the door had closed on her messenger.
"It is only people in our rank of life who get good servants. Did
you notice? Nothing upsets that man's temper. A servant in a poor
family should have been impudent; a maid-of-all-work would have
wondered when I was going to know my own mind." The man returned
with the embroidery. This time she received him graciously; she
dismissed him with her thanks. "Have you seen your mother lately,
Horace?" she asked, suddenly sitting up and busying herself with
her work.
<P>
"I saw her yesterday," Horace answered.
<P>
"She understands, I hope, that I am not well enough to call on
her? She is not offended with me?"
<P>
Horace recovered his serenity. The deference to his mother
implied in Mercy's questions gently flattered his self-esteem. He
resumed his place on the sofa.
<P>
"Offended with you!" he answered, smiling." My dear Grace, she
sends you her love. And, more than that, she has a wedding
present for you."
<P>
Mercy became absorbed in her work; she stooped close over the
embroidery--so close that Horace could not see her face. "Do you
know what the present is?" she asked, in lowered tones, speaking
absently.
<P>
"No. I only know it is waiting for you. Shall I go and get it
to-day?"
<P>
She neither accepted nor refused the proposal--she went on with
her work more industriously than ever.
<P>
"There is plenty of time," Horace persisted. "I can go before
dinner."
<P>
Still she took no notice: still she never looked up. "Your mother
is very kind to me," she said, abruptly. "I was afraid, at one
time, that she would think me hardly good enough to be your
wife."
<P>
Horace laughed indulgently: his self-esteem was more gently
flattered than ever.
<P>
"Absurd!" he exclaimed. "My darling, you are connected with Lady
Janet Roy. Your family is almost as good as ours."
<P>
"Almost?" she repeated. "Only almost?"
<P>
The momentary levity of expression vanished from Horace's face.
The family question was far too serious a question to be lightly
treated A becoming shadow of solemnity stole over his manner. He
looked as if it was Sunday, and he was just stepping into church.
<P>
"In OUR family," he said, "we trace back--by my father, to the
Saxons; by my mother, to the Normans. Lady Janet's family is an
old family--on her side only."
<P>
Mercy dropped her embroidery, and looked Horace full in the face.
She, too, attached no common importance to what she had next to
say.
<P>
"If I had not been connected with Lady Janet," she began, "would
you ever have thought of marrying me?"
<P>
"My love! what is the use of asking? You _are_ connected with
Lady Janet."
<P>
She refused to let him escape answering her in that way.
<P>
"Suppose I had not been connected with Lady Janet?" she
persisted. "Suppose I had only been a good girl, with nothing but
my own merits to speak for me. What would your mother have said
then?"
<P>
Horace still parried the question--only to find the point of it
pressed home on him once more.
<P>
"Why do you ask?" he said.
<P>
"I ask to be answered," she rejoined. "Would your mother have
liked you to marry a poor girl, of no family--with nothing but
her own virtues to speak for her?"
<P>
Horace was fairly pressed back to the wall.
<P>
"If you must know," he replied, "my mother would have refused to
sanction such a marriage as that."
<P>
"No matter how good the girl might have been?"
<P>
There was something defiant--almost threatening--in her tone.
Horace was annoyed--and he showed it when he spoke.
<P>
"My mother would have respected the girl, without ceasing to
respect herself," he said. "My mother would have remembered what
was due to the family name."
<P>
"And she would have said, No?"
<P>
"She would have said, No."
<P>
"Ah!"
<P>
There was an undertone of angry contempt in the exclamation which
made Horace start. "What is the matter?" he asked.
<P>
"Nothing," she answered, and took up her embroidery again. There
he sat at her side, anxiously looking at her--his hope in the
future centered in his marriage! In a week more, if she chose,
she might enter that ancient family of which he had spoken so
proudly, as his wife. "Oh!" she thought, "if I didn't love him!
if I had only his merciless mother to think of!"
<P>
Uneasily conscious of some estrangement between them, Horace
spoke again. "Surely I have not offended you?" he said.
<P>
She turned toward him once more. The work dropped unheeded on her
lap. Her grand eyes softened into tenderness. A smile trembled
sadly on her delicate lips. She laid one hand caressingly on his
shoulder. All the beauty of her voice lent its charm to the next
words that she said to him. The woman's heart hungered in its
misery for the comfort that could only come from his lips.
<P>
"_You_ would have loved me, Horace--without stopping to think of
the family name?"
<P>
The family name again! How strangely she persisted in coming back
to that! Horace looked at her without answering, trying vainly to
fathom what was passing in her mind.
<P>
She took his hand, and wrung it hard--as if she would wring the
answer out of him in that way.
<P>
"_You_ would have loved me?" she repeated.
<P>
The double spell of her voice and her touch was on him. He
answered, warmly, "Under any circumstances! under any name!"
<P>
She put one arm round his neck, and fixed her eyes on his. "Is
that true?" she asked.
<P>
"True as t he heaven above us!"
<P>
She drank in those few commonplace words with a greedy delight.
She forced him to repeat them in a new form.
<P>
"No matter who I might have been? For myself alone?"
<P>
"For yourself alone."
<P>
She threw both arms round him, and laid her head passionately on
his breast. "I love you! I love you!! I love you!!!" Her voice
rose with hysterical vehemence at each repetition of the
words--then suddenly sank to a low hoarse cry of rage and
despair. The sense of her true position toward him revealed
itself in all its horror as the confession of her love escaped
her lips. Her arms dropped from him; she flung herself back on
the sofa-cushions, hiding her face in her hands. "Oh, leave me!"
she moaned, faintly. "Go! go!"
<P>
Horace tried to wind his arm round her, and raise her. She
started to her feet, and waved him back from her with a wild
action of her hands, as if she was frightened of him. "The
wedding present!" she cried, seizing the first pretext that
occurred to her. "You offered to bring me your mother's present.
I am dying to see what it is. Go and get it!"
<P>
Horace tried to compose her. He might as well have tried to
compose the winds and the sea.
<P>
"Go!" she repeated, pressing one clinched hand on her bosom. "I
am not well. Talking excites me--I am hysterical; I shall be
better alone. Get me the present. Go!"
<P>
"Shall I send Lady Janet? Shall I ring for your maid?"
<P>
"Send for nobody! ring for nobody! If you love me--leave me here
by myself! leave me instantly!"
<P>
"I shall see you when I come back?"
<P>
"Yes! yes!"
<P>
There was no alternative but to obey her. Unwillingly and
forebodingly, Horace left the room.
<P>
She drew a deep breath of relief, and dropped into the nearest
chair. If Horace had stayed a moment longer--she felt it, she
knew it--her head would have given way; she would have burst out
before him with the terrible truth. "Oh!" she thought, pressing
her cold hands on her burning eyes, "if I could only cry, now
there is nobody to see me!"
<P>
The room was empty: she had every reason for concluding that she
was alone. And yet at that very moment there were ears that
listened--there were eyes waiting to see her.
<P>
Little by little the door behind her which faced the library and
led into the billiard-room was opened noiselessly from without,
by an inch at a time. As the opening was enlarged a hand in a
black glove, an arm in a black sleeve, appeared, guiding the
movement of the door. An interval of a moment passed, and the
worn white face of Grace Roseberry showed itself stealthily,
looking into the dining-room.
<P>
Her eyes brightened with vindictive pleasure as they discovered
Mercy sitting alone at the further end of the room. Inch by inch
she opened the door more widely, took one step forward, and
checked herself. A sound, just audible at the far end of the
conservatory, had caught her ear.
<P>
She listened--satisfied herself that she was not mistaken--and
drawing back with a frown of displeasure, softly closed the door
again, so as to hide herself from view. The sound that had
disturbed her was the distant murmur of men's voices (apparently
two in number) talking together in lowered tones, at the garden
entrance to the conservatory.
<P>
Who were the men? and what would they do next? They might do one
of two things: they might enter the drawing-room, or they might
withdraw again by way of the garden. Kneeling behind the door,
with her ear at the key-hole, Grace Roseberry waited the event.
