<p>Neither Alvin nor Chester asked their companion to explain his
startling words, for there was no need to do so: only one meaning
could be given them.</p>

<p>"How far dare you venture out with the <em>Shark</em>?" asked
Alvin of the master of the little boat.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"She isn't built for rough weather."</p>

<p>"I know that, but the sea is unusually calm, and there isn't
the slightest danger."</p>

<p>"Not just now, but there's no saying when a blow may come up
that will swamp me before I can run to cover."</p>

<p>"I have no wish to ask you to go into danger and will only request
you to push out as far as you are willing."</p>

<p>George must have known something of the youth who had hired him,
that he was the son of a very wealthy father, and willingly paid
a high price for one's services. The boatman scanned the sky and
different points of the compass. So far as he could judge, the
weather would remain fair for hours to come. In the hope of heartening
him Chester said:</p>

<p>"With your boat capable of making twenty miles an hour, you can
turn back whenever you think best and run into one of the many
harbors in half an hour."</p>

<p>"True enough," grinned George, "if I'm within reach of 'em. I
don't mind trying it a little while longer, but not for many miles."</p>

<p>He slowed down, for the spray dashed over the wind-shield, and
it was plain the swells were increasing, or rather the boat was
plunging into a region where they were growing larger.</p>

<p>The chums did not say anything to him for a considerable time.
He could tell them nothing more and they ought not to distract
his attention. They were in a fever of dread, for never before
had the outlook been so gloomy for Mike Murphy. The youths even
hesitated to speak to each other, for neither could say anything
of a cheering nature. Alvin picked up the binoculars and rising
to his feet and steadying himself as the prow rose and dived,
carefully scanned the far-reaching half circle of the Atlantic.
The form of a brig dimly observable by the naked eye, as it headed
toward Pemaquid Point, was brought out with a distinctness that
caused an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>"What a fine instrument! It equals those our government buys
from Germany for the use of the army and navy. Chester, look at
that fishing boat toward Inner Heron Island."</p>

<p>His companion stood up, balanced himself, shaded his brow and
wrinkled his forehead with the strain of the attempt.</p>

<p>"I see the two men as plainly as if they were no more than a
hundred feet away."</p>

<p>He slowly swept the horizon and enjoyed the visual feast to the
full. Far out to sea the smoke of a steamer trailed against the
sky, the hull hidden by the convexity of the earth, and nearer
in a schooner had caught enough wind to belly her sails and cause
her to heel over as she sped outward. Pemaquid Point showed clearly
to the northwest. The fort, more than two centuries old, is at
Pemaquid Beach several miles north. Nearer rose Thrumbcap Island,
south of the Thread of Life ledges, Crow Island, and large Rutherford
Island, almost cut in two by Christmas Cove. To the left was Inner
Heron, and on the other side of the broad mouth of the Damariscotta
River, the long, narrow Linekin Neck reaching northward to East
Boothbay. Scanning the sweep of water to the south and west many
other islands were seen &mdash;Ram, Fisherman, the Hypocrites,
White, Outer Heron, Damariscove, Pumpkin and some so small that
they are not known by any name.</p>

<p>But nowhere on the waste of heaving water did the eager eye discern
the lost <em>Deerfoot</em>, though boats of varying sizes and
models trailed across the field of vision. Alvin joined in the
scrutiny, but with no more success, and was thus engaged when
he became aware of a sharp turn in the course of the <em>Shark</em>.
Looking down at the wheelman, he saw that the boat was making
a circle.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, George?" he asked, though he knew the meaning
of the movement.</p>

<p>"It won't do to go any farther; I've already pushed too many
miles out."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be gained by taking the same route back;
turn south so as to pass below Fisherman Island."</p>

<p>"I don't see any objection to that," muttered George, doing as
requested, and holding the boat to a fairly moderate speed.</p>

<p>The runabout was now heading southwest, with the purpose of thus
continuing for a couple of miles, when she would swing round and
make for Squirrel Island and so on to Boothbay Harbor.</p>

<p>She was still driving in that direction, when George said to
Alvin:</p>

<p>"You have run your motor boat often enough to understand her
pretty well."</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"There isn't much left for him to learn," was the comment of
Chester.</p>

<p>"Take the wheel for a bit; you know the course as well as me."</p>

<p>"I am glad to relieve you," said Alvin, quickly changing places
with the young man.</p>

<p>"It isn't that, but I suspect my eyes are a little better than
yours; I want to use the glass awhile."</p>

<p>For several minutes the silence was broken only by the splash
of the water against the bow of the runabout, which plowed her
way with ease and grace. Chester Haynes resumed his seat and gave
his chief attention to George, who was on his feet and slowly
sweeping the visible horizon. The binoculars moved deliberately
to and fro, with none of the three speaking a word.</p>

<p>By and by the young man held the instrument pointed to the north,
a little to the right of the narrow fringe of islands with the
odd name of the Hypocrites. He was not studying this insignificant
group, but, as has been said, was looking a little to one side,
toward Inner Heron, three miles away. Pausing in the circling
of the glasses, he held them immovable for two or three minutes.</p>

<p>"It looks as if he sees something," reflected Chester, with his
eyes on the man, while Alvin simply peered ahead and held the
<em>Shark</em> to her course. George muttered something, but Chester
could not catch the words. Suddenly he lowered the binoculars
and asked Alvin to change places again with him. When this was
done he handed the instrument to the youth, with the direction:</p>

<p>"Point her that way," indicating the north, "and if you study
closely you'll notice something."</p>

<p>Without reply, Alvin spread his feet apart to steady himself
and levelled the glass at the point named. The next moment he
exclaimed in great excitement:</p>

<p>"By gracious! I certainly believe it's the <em>Deerfoot</em>!"</p>

<p>Chester sprang up and reached for the binoculars, but his chum
was not ready to hand them over.</p>

<p>"It looks like her, but I'm not certain. What do you say, George?"</p>

<p>"It's her," was the ungrammatical but emphatic response.</p>

<p>The news almost overcame Alvin, who, passing the glasses to Chester,
dropped into his seat, that he might pull himself together.</p>

<p>The launch was a mile off and in so plain sight that the wonder
was it had not been seen before. It was headed diagonally toward
Linekin Neck and seemed to be going very slowly.</p>

<p>"Let me have another look," said George, who retained his place
at the wheel, while at the same time manipulating the instrument.</p>

<p>This time he did not continue his scrutiny as long as before.
While so engaged, the youths used their unassisted eyes. The <em>Deerfoot</em>,
as she undoubtedly was, could be seen in the position named, though
of course with less distinctness than through the binoculars.</p>

<p>"She doesn't seem to make much progress," remarked Alvin, with
an inquiring look at George, who swung the wheel over so as to
head toward the motor boat. He did not reply to the words of the
youth, to whom he again handed the instrument. Alvin persisted:</p>

<p>"How do you explain it?"</p>

<p>"She only moves as the current carries her."</p>

<p>"Do you mean she is drifting?"</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>A look told Alvin the young man had spoken the truth.</p>

<p>"That means she has broken down," suggested Chester, uttering
the thought that was in both of the minds of his companions.</p>

<p>"It can't mean anything else," said George, who evidently kept
back some of his fancies.</p>

<p>"Whistle to him," suggested Alvin.</p>

<p>A series of tootings were sent out. They were not loud, but in
the stillness must have gone beyond the <em>Deerfoot</em>. The
three listened, but heard no response.</p>

<p>"I knew there wouldn't be," commented George.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>He shook his head, but did not speak further.</p>

<p>After another study of his own boat through the glass, Alvin
remarked uneasily:</p>

<p>"I don't see anything of Mike. George, did you notice him?"</p>

<p>George shook his head without looking round.</p>

<p>"What do you think, Chester?" asked his friend.</p>

<p>"Probably he has been up all night and has fallen asleep," was
the reply of Chester, spoken with so much confidence that for
the moment it quieted the alarm of the other.</p>

<p>"That would be just like Mike. Something has gone wrong with
the engine and he hasn't the first idea of what he should do to
repair it; so when worn out, he has lain down and gone to sleep.
We shall have the joke on Mike when we see him."</p>

<p>George's lips were compressed and he remained silent until half
the intervening distance was passed; then he looked over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Young men, the reason you don't see Mike <em>is because he isn't
on that boat</em>!"</p>
