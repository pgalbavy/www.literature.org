<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>In that month of June, for the first time in his deliberately
active career, Neville experienced a disinclination to paint.
And when he realised that it was disinclination, it appalled him.
Something&mdash;he didn't understand what&mdash;had suddenly left him satiated&mdash;and
with all the uneasiness and discontent of satiation he forced
matters until he could force no further.</p>

<p>He had commissions, several, and valuable; and let them lie.
For the first time in all his life the blank canvas of an unexecuted
commission left him untempted, unresponsive, weary.</p>

<p>He had, also, his portrait of Valerie to continue. He continued
it mentally, at intervals; but for several days, now, he had not
laid a brush to it.</p>

<p>"It's funny," he said to Querida, going out on the train to his
sister's country home one delicious morning&mdash;"it's confoundedly
odd that I should turn lazy in my old age. Do you think I'm worked
out?" He gulped down a sudden throb of fear smilingly.</p>

<p>"Lie fallow," said Querida, gently. "No soil is deep enough to
yield without rest."</p>

<p>"Yours does."</p>

<p>"Oh, for me," said Querida, showing his snowy teeth, "I often
sicken of my fat sunlight, frying everything to an iridescent
omelette." He shrugged, laughed: "I turn lazy for months every
year. Try it, my friend. Don't you even keep <em>mi-carême</em>?"</p>

<p>Neville stared out of the window at the station platform past
which they were gliding, and rose with Querida as the train stopped.
His sister's touring car was waiting; into it stepped Querida,
and he followed; and away they sped over the beautiful rolling
country, where handsome cattle tried to behave like genuine Troyon's,
and silvery sheep attempted to imitate Mauve, and even the trees,
separately or in groups, did their best to look like sections
of Rousseau, Diaz, and even Corot&mdash;but succeeded only in resembling
questionable imitations.</p>

<p>"There's to be quite a week-end party?" inquired Querida.</p>

<p>"I don't know. My sister telephoned me to fill in. I fancy the
party is for you."</p>

<p>"For <em>me</em>!" exclaimed Querida with delightful enthusiasm.
"That is most charming of Mrs. Collis."</p>

<p>"They'll all think it charming of you. Lord, what a rage you've
become and what a furor you've aroused!... And you deserve it,"
added Neville, coolly.</p>

<p>Querida looked at him, calm intelligence in his dark gaze; and
understood the honesty of the comment.</p>

<p>"That," he said, "if you permit the vigour of expression, is
damn nice of you, Neville. But you can afford to be generous to
other painters."</p>

<p>"Can I?" Neville turned and gazed at Querida, gray eyes clear
in their searching inquiry. Then he laughed a little and looked
out over the sunny landscape.</p>

<p>Querida's olive cheeks had reddened a trifle.</p>

<p>Neville said: "What <em>is</em> the trouble with my work, anyway?
Is it what some of you fellows say?"</p>

<p>Querida did not pretend to misunderstand:</p>

<p>"You're really a great painter, Neville. And you know it. Must
you have <em>everything</em>?"</p>

<p>"Well &mdash;I'm going after it."</p>

<p>"Surely&mdash;surely. I, also. God knows my work lacks many, many
things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it doesn't lack that one essential which mine lacks. <em>What</em>
is it?"</p>

<p>Querida laughed: "I can't explain. For me&mdash;your Byzantine canvas&mdash;there
is in it something not intimate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Austere?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;even in those divine and lovely throngs. There is, perhaps,
an aloofness&mdash;even a self-denial&mdash;" He laughed again: "I deny
myself nothing&mdash;on canvas&mdash;even I have the audacity to try to
draw as you do!"</p>

<p>Neville sat thinking, watching the landscape speed away on either
side in a running riot of green.</p>

<p>"Self-denial&mdash;too much of it&mdash;separates you from your kind,"
said Querida. "The solitary fasters are never personally pleasant;
hermits are the world's public admiration and private abomination.
Oh, the good world dearly loves to rub elbows with a talented
sinner and patronise him and sentimentalise over him&mdash;one whose
miracles don't hurt their eyes enough to blind them to the pleasant
discovery that his halo is tarnished in spots and needs polishing,
and that there's a patch on the seat of his carefully creased
toga."</p>

<p>Neville laughed. Presently he said: "Until recently I've cherished
theories. One of 'em was to subordinate everything in life to
the enjoyment of a single pleasure&mdash;the pleasure of work.... I
guess experience is putting that theory on the blink."</p>

<p>"Surely. You might as well make an entire meal of one favourite
dish. For a day you could stand it, even like it, perhaps. After
that&mdash;" he shrugged.</p>

<p>"But &mdash;I'd <em>rather</em> spend my time painting&mdash;if I
could stand the diet."</p>

<p>"Would you? I don't know what I'd rather do. I like almost everything.
It makes me paint better to talk to a pretty woman, for example.
To kiss her inspires a masterpiece."</p>

<p>"Does it?" said Neville, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Of course. A week or two of motoring&mdash;riding, dancing, white
flannel idleness&mdash;all these I adore. And," tapping his carefully
pinned lilac tie&mdash;"inside of me I know that every pleasant experience,
every pleasure I offer myself, is going to make me a better painter!"</p>

<p>"Experience," repeated the other.</p>

<p>"By all means and every means&mdash;experience in pleasure, in idleness,
in love, in sorrow&mdash;but experience!&mdash;always experience, by hook
or by crook, and at any cost. That is the main idea, Neville&mdash;<em>my</em>
main idea&mdash;like the luscious agglomeration of juicy green things
which that cow is eating; they all go to make good milk. Bah!&mdash;that's
a stupid simile," he added, reddening.</p>

<p>Neville laughed. Presently he pointed across the meadows.</p>

<p>"Is <em>that</em> your sister's place?" asked Querida with enthusiasm,
interested and disappointed. "What a charming house!"</p>

<p>"That is Ashuelyn, my sister's house. Beyond is El Naúar, Cardemon's
place.... Here we are."</p>

<p>The small touring car stopped; the young men descended to a grassy
terrace where a few people in white flannels had gathered after
breakfast. A slender woman, small of bone and built like an undeveloped
girl, came forward, the sun shining on her thick chestnut hair.</p>

<p>"Hello, Lily," said Neville.</p>

<p>"Hello, Louis. Thank you for coming, Mr. Querida&mdash;it is exceedingly
nice of you to come&mdash;" She gave him her firm, cool hand, smiled
on him with unfeigned approval, turned and presented him to the
others &mdash;Miss Aulne, Miss Swift, Miss Annan, a Mr. Cameron,
and, a moment later, to her husband, Gordon Collis, a good-looking,
deeply sun-burned young man whose only passion, except his wife
and baby, was Ashuelyn, the home of his father.</p>

<p>But it was a quiet passion which bored nobody, not even his wife.</p>

<p>When conversation became general, with Querida as the centre
around which it eddied, Neville, who had seated himself on the
gray stone parapet near his sister, said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Well, how goes it, Lily?"</p>

<p>"All right," she replied with boyish directness, but in the same
low tone. "Mother and father have spent a week with us. You saw
them in town?"</p>

<p>"Of course. I'll run up to Spindrift House to see them as often
as I can this summer.... How's the kid?"</p>

<p>"Fine. Do you want to see him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'd like to."</p>

<p>His sister caught his hand, jumped up, and led him into the house
to the nursery where a normal and in nowise extraordinary specimen
of infancy reposed in a cradle, pink with slumber, one thumb inserted
in its mouth.</p>

<p>"Isn't he a wonder," murmured Neville, venturing to release the
thumb.</p>

<p>The young mother bent over, examining her offspring in all the
eloquent silence of pride unutterable. After a little while she
said: "I've got to feed him. Go back to the others, Louis, and
say I'll be down after a while."</p>

<p>He sauntered back through the comfortable but modest house, glancing
absently about him on his way to the terrace, nodding to familiar
faces among the servants, stopping to inspect a sketch of his
own which he had done long ago and which his sister loved and
he hated.</p>

<p>"Rotten," he murmured&mdash;"it has an innocence about it that is
actually more offensive than stupidity."</p>

<p>On the terrace Stephanie Swift came over to him:</p>

<p>"Do you want a single at tennis, Louis? The others are hot for
Bridge&mdash;except Gordon Collis&mdash;and he is going to dicker with a
farmer over some land he wants to buy."</p>

<p>Neville looked at the others:</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you people are going to sit here all
hunched up around a table on a glorious day like this?"</p>

<p>"We are," said Alexander Cameron, calmly breaking the seal of
two fresh, packs. "You artists have nothing to do for a living
except to paint pretty models, and when the week end comes you're
in fine shape to caper and cut up didoes. But we business men
are too tired to go galumphing over the greensward when Saturday
arrives. It's a wicker chair and a 'high one,' and peaceful and
improving cards for ours."</p>

<p>Alice Annan laughed and glanced at Querida degrees Cameron's
idea was her idea of what her brother Harry was doing for a living;
but she wasn't sure that Querida would think it either flattering
or humorous.</p>

<p>But Jose Querida laughed, too, saying: "Quite right, Mr. Cameron.
It's only bluff with, us; we never work. Life is one continual
comic opera."</p>

<p>"It's a cinch," murmured Cameron. "Stocks and bonds are exciting,
but <em>your</em> business puts it all over us. Nobody would have
to drive me to business every morning if there was a pretty model
in a cosey studio awaiting me."</p>

<p>"Sandy, you're rather horrid," said Miss Aulne, watching him
sort out the jokers from the new packs and, with a skilful flip,
send them scaling out, across the grass, for somebody to pick
up.</p>

<p>Cameron said: "How about this Trilby business, anyway, Miss Annan?
You have a brother in it. Is the world of art full of pretty models
clad in ballet skirts&mdash;when they wear anything? Is it all one
mad, joyous melange of high-brow conversation discreetly peppered
with low-brow revelry? Yes? No? Inform an art lover, please&mdash;as
they say in the <em>Times Saturday Review</em>."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Miss Annan, laughing. "Harry never has anybody
interesting in the studio when he lets me take tea there."</p>

<p>Rose Aulne said: "I saw some photographs of a very beautiful
girl in Sam Ogilvy's studio&mdash;a model. What is her name, Alice?&mdash;the
one Sam and Harry are always raving over?"</p>

<p>"They call her Valerie, I believe."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the one &mdash;Valerie West, isn't it? <em>Is</em>
it, Louis? You know her, of course."</p>

<p>Neville nodded coolly.</p>

<p>"Introduce me," murmured Cameron, spreading a pack for cutting.
"Perhaps she'd like to see the Stock Exchange when I'm at my best."</p>

<p>"Is she such a beauty? Do you know her, too, Mr. Querida?" asked
Rose Aulne.</p>

<p>Querida laughed: "I do. Miss West is a most engaging, most amiable
and cultivated girl, and truly very beautiful."</p>

<p>"Oh! They <em>are</em> sometimes educated?" asked Stephanie,
surprised.</p>

<p>"Sometimes they are even equipped to enter almost any drawing-room
in New York. It doesn't always require the very highest equipment
to do that," he added, laughing.</p>

<p>"That sounds like romantic fiction," observed Alice Annan. "You
are a poet, Mr. Querida."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not often a girl like Valerie West crosses our path.
I admit that. Now and then such a comet passes across our sky&mdash;or
is reported. I never before saw any except this one."</p>

<p>"If she's as much of a winner as all that," began Cameron with
decision, "I want to meet her immediately&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mere brokers are out of it," said Alice.... "Cut, please."</p>

<p>Rose Aulne said: "If you painters only knew it, your stupid studio
teas would be far more interesting if you'd have a girl like this
Valerie West to pour for you ... and for us to see."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Alice; "but they're a vain lot. They think we are
unsophisticated enough to want to go to their old studios and
be perfectly satisfied to look at their precious pictures, and
listen to their art patter. I've told Harry that what we want
is to see something of the real studio life; and he tries to convince
me that it's about as exciting as a lawyer's life when he dictates
to his stenographer."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'If she's as much of a winner as all that,' began
Cameron with decision, 'I want to meet her immediately&mdash;'"]</p>

<p>"Is it?" asked Stephanie of Neville.</p>

<p>"Just about as exciting. Some few business men may smirk at their
stenographers; some few painters may behave in the same way to
their models. I fancy it's the exception to the rule in any kind
of business&mdash;isn't it, Sandy?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Cameron, hastily. "I never winked at my stenographer&mdash;never!
never! Will you deal, Mr. Querida?" he asked, courteously.</p>

<p>"I should think a girl like that would be interesting to know,"
said Lily Collis, who had come up behind her brother and Stephanie
Swift and stood, a hand on each of their shoulders, listening
and looking on at the card game.</p>

<p>"That is what I wanted to say, too," nodded Stephanie. "I'd like
to meet a really nice girl who is courageous enough, and romantic
enough to pose for artists&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean poor enough, don't you?" said Neville. "They don't
do it because it's romantic."</p>

<p>"It must be romantic work."</p>

<p>"It isn't, I assure you. It's drudgery&mdash;and sometimes torture."</p>

<p>Stephanie laughed: "I believe it's easy work and a gay existence
full of romance. Don't undeceive me, Louis. And I think you're
selfish not to let us meet your beautiful Valerie at tea."</p>

<p>"Why not?" added his sister. "I'd like to see her myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lily, you know perfectly well that oil and water don't mix,"
he said with a weary shrug.</p>

<p>"I suppose we're the oil," remarked Rose Aulne&mdash;"horrid, smooth,
insinuating stuff. And his beautiful Valerie is the clear, crystalline,
uncontaminated fountain of inspiration."</p>

<p>Lily Collis dropped her hands from Stephanie's and her brother's
shoulders:</p>

<p>"Do ask us to tea to meet her, Louis," she coaxed.</p>

<p>"We've never seen a model&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you want me to exhibit a sensitive girl as a museum freak?"
he asked, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose we know how to behave toward her? Really,
Louis, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Probably you know how to behave. And I can assure you that she
knows perfectly well how to behave toward anybody. But that isn't
the question. You want to see her out of curiosity. You wouldn't
make a friend of her&mdash;or even an acquaintance. And I tell you,
frankly, I don't think it's square to her and I won't do it. Women
are nuisances in studios, anyway."</p>

<p>"What a charming way your brother has of explaining things,"
laughed Stephanie, passing her arm through Lily's: "Shall we reveal
to him that he was seen with his Valerie at the St. Regis a week
ago?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" he said, coolly, but inwardly exasperated. "She's
as ornamental as anybody who dines there."</p>

<p>"I don't do <em>that</em> with <em>my</em> stenographers!" called
out Cameron gleefully, cleaning up three odd in spades. "Oh, don't
talk to me, Louis! You're a gay bunch all right!&mdash;you're qualified,
every one of you, artists and models, to join the merry, merry!"</p>

<p>Stephanie dropped Lily's arm with a light laugh, swung her tennis
bat, tossed a ball into the sunshine, and knocked it over toward
the tennis court.</p>

<p>"I'll take you on if you like, Louis!" she called back over her
shoulder, then continued her swift, graceful pace, white serge
skirts swinging above her ankles, bright hair wind-blown&mdash;a lithe,
full, wholesome figure, very comforting to look at.</p>

<p>"Come upstairs; I'll show you where Gordon's shoes are," said
his sister.</p>

<p>Gordon's white shoes fitted him, also his white trousers. When
he was dressed he came out of the room and joined his sister,
who was seated on the stairs, balancing his racquet across her
knees.</p>

<p>"Louis," she said, "how about the good taste of taking that model
of yours to the St. Regis?"</p>

<p>"It was perfectly good taste," he said, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Stephanie took it like an angel," mused his sister.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't she? If there was anything queer about it, you
don't suppose I'd select the St. Regis, do you?"</p>

<p>"Nobody supposed there was anything queer."</p>

<p>"Well, then," he demanded, impatiently, "what's the row?"</p>

<p>"There is no row. Stephanie doesn't make what you call rows.
Neither does anybody in your immediate family. I was merely questioning
the wisdom of your public appearance&mdash;under the circumstances."</p>

<p>"What circumstances?"</p>

<p>His sister looked at him calmly:</p>

<p>"The circumstances of your understanding with Stephanie.... An
understanding of years, which, in her mind at least, amounts to
a tacit engagement."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you said that," he began, after a moment's steady thinking.
"If that is the way that Stephanie and you still regard a college
affair&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>A&mdash;</em>what!"</p>

<p>"A boy-and-girl preference which became an undergraduate romance&mdash;and
has never amounted to anything more&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Louis!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Don't you <em>care</em> for her?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; as much as I ever did&mdash;as much, as she really and
actually cares for me," he answered, defiantly. "You know perfectly
well what such affairs ever amount to&mdash;in the sentimental-ever-after
line. Infant sweethearts almost never marry. She has no more idea
of it than have I. We are fond of each other; neither of us has
happened, so far, to encounter the real thing. But as soon as
the right man comes along Stephanie will spread her wings and
take flight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't know her! Well&mdash;of all faithless wretches&mdash;your inconstancy
makes me positively ill!"</p>

<p>"Inconstancy! I'm not inconstant. I never saw a girl I liked
better than Stephanie. I'm not likely to. But that doesn't mean
that I want to marry her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For shame!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Why do you talk about inconstancy? It's a ridiculous
word. What is constancy in love? Either an accident or a fortunate
state of mind. To promise constancy in love is promising to continue
in a state of mind over which your will has no control. It's never
an honest promise; it can be only an honest hope. Love comes and
goes and no man can stay it, and no man is its prophet. Coming
unasked, sometimes undesired, often unwelcome, it goes unbidden,
without reason, without logic, as inexorably as it came, governed
by laws that no man has ever yet understood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Louis!" exclaimed his sister, bewildered; "what in the world
are you lecturing about? Why, to hear you expound the anatomy
of love&mdash;"</p>

<p>He began to laugh, caught her hands, and kissed her:</p>

<p>"Little goose, that was all impromptu and horribly trite and
commonplace. Only it was new to me because I never before took
the trouble to consider it. But it's true, even if it is trite.
People love or they don't love, and a regard for ethics controls
only what they do about it."</p>

<p>"That's another Tupperesque truism, isn't it, dear?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing. Who am I to mock at the Proverbial One when I've
never yet evolved anything better?... Listen; you don't want me
to marry Stephanie, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"No, you don't. You think you do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do, I do, Louis! She's the sweetest, finest, most generous,
most suitable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure," he said, hastily, "she's all that except 'suitable'&mdash;and
she isn't that, and I'm not, either. For the love of Mike, Lily,
let me go on admiring her, even loving her in a perfectly harmless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It <em>isn't</em> harmless to caress a girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;you can't call it caressing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you call it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. We've always been on an intimate footing. She's perfectly
unembarrassed about&mdash;whatever impulsive&mdash;er&mdash;fugitive impulses&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You <em>do</em> kiss her!"</p>

<p>"Seldom&mdash;very seldom. At moments the conditions happen accidentally
to&mdash;suggest&mdash;some slight demonstration&mdash;of a very warm friendship&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You positively sicken me! Do you think a nice girl is going
to let a man paw her if she doesn't consider him pledged to her?"</p>

<p>"I don't think anything about it. Nice girls have done madder
things than their eulogists admit. As a plain matter of fact you
can't tell what anybody nice is going to do under theoretical
circumstances. And the nicer they are the bigger the gamble&mdash;particularly
if they're endowed with brains&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>That's</em> cynicism. You seem to be developing several
streaks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Polite blinking of facts never changes them. Conforming to conventional
and accepted theories never yet appealed to intelligence. I'm
not going to be dishonest with myself; that's one of the streaks
I've developed. You ask me if I love Stephanie enough to marry
her, and I say I don't. What's the good of blinking it? I don't
love anybody enough to marry 'em; but I like a number of girls
well enough to spoon with them."</p>

<p>"<em>That</em> is disgusting!"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," he said, with smiling weariness; "it's the unvarnished
truth about the average man. Why wink at it? The average man can
like a lot of girls enough to spoon and sentimentalise with them.
It's the pure accident of circumstance and environment that chooses
for him the one he marries. There are myriads of others in the
world with whom, under proper circumstances and environment, he'd
have been just as happy&mdash;often happier. Choice is a mystery, constancy
a gamble, discontent the one best bet. It isn't pleasant; it isn't
nice fiction and delightful romance; it isn't poetry or precept
as it is popularly inculcated; it's the brutal truth about the
average man.... And I'm going to find Stephanie. Have you any
objection?"</p>

<p>"Louis &mdash;I'm terribly disappointed in you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm disappointed, too. Until you spoke to me so plainly a few
minutes ago I never clearly understood that I couldn't marry Stephanie.
When I thought of it at all it seemed a vague and shadowy something,
too far away to be really impending&mdash;threatening&mdash;like death&mdash;"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Come on, Alice, if you're going to scrub before
luncheon.'"]</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried his sister in revolt. "I shall make it my business
to see that Stephanie understands you thoroughly before this goes
any farther&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish to heaven you would," he said, so heartily that his sister,
exasperated, turned her back and marched away to the nursery.</p>

<p>When he went out to the tennis court he found Stephanie idly
batting the balls across the net with Cameron, who, being dummy,
had strolled down to gibe at her&mdash;a pastime both enjoyed:</p>

<p>"Here comes your Alonzo, fair lady&mdash;lightly skipping o'er the
green&mdash;yes, yes&mdash;wearing the panties of his brother-in-law!" He
fell into an admiring attitude and contemplated Neville with a
simper, his ruddy, prematurely bald head cocked on one side:</p>

<p>"Oh, girls! <em>Ain't</em> he just grand!" he exclaimed. "Honest,
Stephanie, your young man has me in the ditch with two blow-outs
and the gas afire!"</p>

<p>"Get out of this court," said Neville, hurling a ball at him.</p>

<p>"Isn't he the jealous old thing!" cried Cameron, flouncing away
with an affectation of feminine indignation. And presently the
tennis balls began to fly, and the little jets of white dust floated
away on the June breeze.</p>

<p>They were very evenly matched; they always had been, never asking
odds or offering handicaps in anything. It had always been so;
at the traps she could break as many clay birds as he could; she
rode as well, drove as well; their averages usually balanced.
From the beginning&mdash;even as children&mdash;it had been always give
and take and no favour.</p>

<p>And so it was now; sets were even; it was a matter of service.</p>

<p>Luncheon interrupted a drawn game; Stephanie, flushed, smiling,
came around to his side of the net to join him on the way to the
house:</p>

<p>"How do you keep up your game, Louis? Or do I never improve?
It's curious, isn't it, that we are always deadlocked."</p>

<p>Bare-armed, bright hair in charming disorder, she swung along
beside him with that quick, buoyant step so characteristic of
a spirit ever undaunted, saluting the others on the terrace with
high-lifted racquet.</p>

<p>"Nobody won," she said. "Come on, Alice, if you're going to scrub
before luncheon. Thank you, Louis; I've had a splendid game&mdash;"
She stretched out a frank hand to him, going, and the tips of
her fingers just brushed his.</p>

<p>His sister gave him a tragic look, which he ignored, and a little
later luncheon was on and Cameron garrulous, and Querida his own
gentle, expressive, fascinating self, devotedly receptive to any
woman who was inclined to talk to him or to listen.</p>

<p>That evening Neville said to his sister: "There's a train at
midnight; I don't think I'll stay over&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I want to be in town early."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"The early light is the best."</p>

<p>"I thought you'd stopped painting for a while."</p>

<p>"I have, practically. There's one thing I keep on with, in a
desultory sort of way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing of importance&mdash;" he hesitated&mdash;"that Is, it may
be important. I can't be sure, yet."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what it is?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. It's a portrait&mdash;a study&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of whom, dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of nobody you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is it a portrait of Valerie West?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, carelessly.</p>

<p>There was a silence; in the starlight his shadowy face was not
clearly visible to his sister.</p>

<p>"Are you leaving just to continue that portrait?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm interested in it."</p>

<p>"Don't go," she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," he returned shortly.</p>

<p>"Dear, I am not silly, but I suspect you are beginning to be.
And over a model!"</p>

<p>"Lily, you little idiot," he laughed, exasperated; "what in the
world is worrying you?"</p>

<p>"Your taking that girl to the St. Regis. It isn't like you."</p>

<p>"Good Lord! How many girls do you suppose I've taken to various
places?"</p>

<p>"Not many," she said, smiling at him. "Your reputation for gallantries
is not alarming."</p>

<p>Ho reddened. "You're perfectly right. That sort of thing never
appealed to me."</p>

<p>"Then why does it appeal to you now?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't. Can't you understand that this girl is entirely
different&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand. And that is what worries me."</p>

<p>"It needn't. It's precisely like taking any girl you know and
like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then let me know her&mdash;if you mean to decorate-public places
with her."</p>

<p>They looked at one another steadily.</p>

<p>"Louis," she said, "this pretty Valerie is not your sister's
sort, or you wouldn't hesitate."</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>hesitate&mdash;yes, certainly I do. It's absurd on the
face of it. She's too fine a nature to be patronised&mdash;too inexperienced
in the things of your world&mdash;too ignorant of petty conventions
and formalities&mdash;too free and fearless and confident and independent
to appeal to the world you live in."</p>

<p>"Isn't that a rather scornful indictment against my world, dear?"</p>

<p>"No. Your world is all right in its way. You and I were brought
up in it. I got out of it. There are other worlds. The one I now
inhabit is more interesting to me. It's purely a matter of personal
taste, dear. Valerie West inhabits a world that suits her."</p>

<p>"Has she had any choice in the matter?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>yes. She's had the sense and the courage to keep
out of the various unsafe planets where electric light furnishes
the principal illumination."</p>

<p>"But has she had a chance for choosing a better planet than the
one you say she prefers? Your choice was free. Was hers?"</p>

<p>"Look here, Lily! Why on earth are you so significant about a
girl you never saw&mdash;scarcely ever heard of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear, I have not told you everything. I <em>have</em> heard
of her&mdash;of her charm, her beauty, her apparent innocence&mdash;yes,
her audacity, her popularity with men.... Such things are not
unobserved and unreported between your new planet and mine. Harry
Annan is frankly crazy about her, and his sister Alice is scared
to death. Mr. Ogilvy, Mr. Burleson, Clive Gail, dozens of men
I know are quite mad about her.... If it was she whom you used
as model for the figures in the Byzantine decorations, she is
divine&mdash;the loveliest creature to look at! And I don't care, Louis;
I don't care a straw one way or the other except that I know you
have never bothered with the more or less Innocently irregular
gaieties which attract many men of your age and temperament. And
so&mdash;when I hear that you are frequently seen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Frequently?"</p>

<p>"Is that St. Regis affair the only one?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not. But, as for my being with her frequently&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, then, looking up with a laugh:</p>

<p>"I like her immensely. Until this moment I didn't realise how
much I do like her&mdash;how pleasant it is to be with a girl who is
absolutely fearless, clever, witty, intelligent, and unspoiled."</p>

<p>"Are there no girls in your own set who conform to this standard?"</p>

<p>"Plenty. But their very environment and conventional traditions
kill them&mdash;make them a nuisance."</p>

<p>"Louis!"</p>

<p>"That's more plain truth, which no woman likes. Will you tell
me what girl in your world, who approaches the qualitative standard
set by Valerie West, would go about by day or evening with any
man except her brother? Valerie does. What girl would be fearless
enough to ignore the cast-iron fetters of her caste? Valerie West
is a law unto herself&mdash;a law as sweet and good and excellent and
as inflexible as any law made by men to restrain women's liberty,
arouse them to unhappy self-consciousness and infect them with
suspicion. Every one of you are the terrified slaves of custom,
and you know it. Most men like it. I don't. I'm no tea drinker,
no cruncher of macaroons, no gabbler at receptions, no top-hatted
haunter of weddings, no social graduate of the Ecole Turvydrop.
And these places&mdash;if I want to find companionship in any girl
of your world&mdash;must frequent. And I won't. And so there you are."</p>

<p>His sister came up to him and placed her arms around his neck.</p>

<p>"Such&mdash;a&mdash;wrong-headed&mdash;illogical&mdash;boy," she sighed, kissing
him leisurely to punctuate her words. '"If you marry a girl you
love you can have all the roaming and unrestrained companionship
you want. Did that ever occur to you?"</p>

<p>"At that price," he said, laughing, "I'll do without it."</p>

<p>"Wrong head, handsome head! I'm in despair about you. Why in
the world cannot artists conform to the recognised customs of
a perfectly pleasant and respectable world? Don't answer me! You'll
make me very unhappy.... Now go and talk to Stephanie. The child
won't understand your going to-night, but make the best of it
to her."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, Lily! I haven't a string tied to me. It doesn't matter
to Stephanie what I do&mdash;why I go or remain. You're all wrong.
Stephanie and I understand each other."</p>

<p>"I'll see that she understands <em>you</em>" said his sister,
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>He laughed and kissed her again, impatient. But why he was impatient
he himself did not know. Certainly it was not to find Stephanie,
for whom he started to look&mdash;and, on the way, glanced at his watch,
determined not to miss the train that would bring him into town
in time to talk to Valerie West over the telephone.</p>

<p>Passing the lighted and open windows, he saw Querida and Alice
absorbed in a tête-à-tête, ensconced in a corner of the big living
room; saw Gordon playing with Heinz, the dog&mdash;named Heinz because
of the celebrated "57 varieties" of dog in his pedigree&mdash;saw Miss
Aulne at solitaire, exchanging lively civilities with Sandy Cameron
at the piano between charming bits of a classic ballad which he
was inclined to sing:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I'd share my pottage<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With you, dear, but<br/>
True love in a cottage<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is hell in a hut."

</p>
</div>
<p>"Is that you, Stephanie?" he asked, as a dark figure, seated
on the veranda, turned a shadowy head toward him.</p>

<p>"Yes. Isn't this starlight magnificent? I've been up to the nursery
looking at the infant wonder&mdash;just wild to hug him; but he's asleep,
and his nurse glared at me. So I thought I'd come and look at
something else as unattainable&mdash;the stars, Louis," she added,
laughing&mdash;"not you."</p>

<p>"Sure," he said, smiling, "I'm always obtainable. Unlike the
infant upon whom you had designs," he added, "I'm neither asleep
nor will any nurse glare at you if you care to steal a kiss from
me."</p>

<p>"I've no inclination to transfer my instinctively maternal transports
to you," she said, serenely, "though, maternal solicitude might
not be amiss concerning you."</p>

<p>"Do you think I need moral supervision?"</p>

<p>"Not by me."</p>

<p>"By whom?"</p>

<p>"Ask me an easier one, Louis. And &mdash;I didn't <em>say</em>
you needed it at all, did I?"</p>

<p>He sat beside her, silent, head lifted, examining the stars.</p>

<p>"I'm going back on the midnight," he remarked, casually.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry!" she exclaimed, with her winning frankness.</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;there's something I have to attend to in town&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Work?"</p>

<p>"It has to do with my work&mdash;indirectly&mdash;"</p>

<p>She glanced sideways at him, and remained for a moment curiously
observant.</p>

<p>"How is the work going, anyway?" she asked.</p>

<p>He hesitated. "I've apparently come up slap against a blank wall.
It isn't easy to explain how I feel&mdash;but I've no confidence in
myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>You</em>! No confidence? How absurd!"</p>

<p>"It's true," he said a little sullenly.</p>

<p>"You are having a spasm of progressive development," she said,
calmly. "You take it as a child takes teething&mdash;with a squirm
and a mental howl instead of a physical yell."</p>

<p>He laughed. "I suppose it's something of that sort. But there's
more&mdash;a self-distrust amounting to self-disgust at moments....
Stephanie, I <em>want</em> to do something good&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have&mdash;dozens of times."</p>

<p>"People say so. The world forgets what is really good&mdash;" he made
a nervous gesture&mdash;"always before us poor twentieth-century men
looms the goal guarded by the vast, austere, menacing phantoms
of the Masters."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'I know it is <em>you</em>. Is it?'"]</p>

<p>"Nobody ever won a race looking behind him," she Said, gaily;
"let 'em menace and loom!"</p>

<p>He laughed in a half-hearted fashion, then his head fell again
slowly, and he sat there brooding, silent.</p>

<p>"Louis, why are you always dissatisfied?"</p>

<p>"I always will be, I suppose." His discontented gaze grew more
vague.</p>

<p>"Can you never learn to enjoy the moment?"</p>

<p>"It goes too quickly, and there are so many others which promise
more, and will never fulfil their promise; I know it. We painters
know it when we dare to think clearly. It is better not to think
too clearly&mdash;better to go on and pretend to expect attainment....
Stephanie, sometimes I wish I were in an honest business&mdash;selling,
buying&mdash;and could close up shop and go home to pleasant dreams."</p>

<p>"Can't you?"</p>

<p>"No. It's eternal obsession. A painter's work is never ended.
It goes on with some after they are asleep; and then they go crazy,"
he added, and laughed and laid his hand lightly and unthinkingly
over hers where it rested on the arm of her chair. And he remained
unaware of her delicate response to the contact.</p>

<p>The stars were clear and liquid-bright, swarming in myriads in
the June sky. A big meteor fell, leaving an incandescent arc which
faded instantly.</p>

<p>"I wonder what time it is," Be said.</p>

<p>"You mustn't miss your train, must you?"</p>

<p>"No." ... Suddenly it struck him that it would be one o'clock
before he could get to the studio and call up Valerie. That would
be too late. He couldn't awake her just for the pleasure of talking
to her. Besides, he was sure to see her in the morning when she
came to him for her portrait.... Yet&mdash;yet&mdash;he wanted to talk to
her.... There seemed to be no particular reason for this desire.</p>

<p>"I think I'll just step to the telephone a moment." He rose,
and her fingers dropped from his hand. "You don't mind, do you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," she smiled. "The stars are very faithful friends.
I'll be well guarded until you come back, Louis."</p>

<p>What she said, for some reason, made him slightly uncomfortable.
He was thinking of her words as he called up "long distance" and
waited. Presently Central called him with a brisk "Here's your
party!" And very far away he heard her voice:</p>

<p>"I know it is <em>you</em>. Is it?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"It is! I recognise your voice. But <em>which</em> is it &mdash;Kelly
or Louis or Mr. Neville?"</p>

<p>"All three," he replied, laughing.</p>

<p>"But which gentleman is in the ascendant? The god-like one? Or
the conventional Mr. Neville? Or&mdash;the bad and very lovable and
very human Louis?"</p>

<p>"Stop talking-nonsense, Valerie. What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Conversing with an abrupt gentleman called Louis Neville. I
<em>was</em> reading."</p>

<p>"All alone in your room?"</p>

<p>"Naturally. Two people <em>couldn't</em> get into it unless one
of them also got into bed."</p>

<p>"You poor child! What are you reading?"</p>

<p>"Will you promise not to laugh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will."</p>

<p>"Then &mdash;I was reading the nineteenth psalm."</p>

<p>"It's a beauty, isn't it," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, Louis, it is glorious! &mdash;I don't know what in it appeals
most thrillingly to me&mdash;the wisdom or the beauty of the verse&mdash;but
I love it."</p>

<p>"It is fine," he said. "... And are you there in your room all
alone this beautiful starry night, reading the psalms of old King
David?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What are you doing? Where are you?"</p>

<p>"At Ashuelyn, my sister's home."</p>

<p>"Oh! Well, it is perfectly sweet of you to think of me and to
call me up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I usually &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>well, naturally I think of you.
I thought I'd just call you up to say good night. You see my train
doesn't get in until one this morning; and of course I couldn't
wake you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you could. I am perfectly willing to have you wake me."</p>

<p>"But that would be the limit!"</p>

<p>"Is <em>that</em> your limit, Louis? If it is you will never
disturb my peace of mind." He heard her laughing at the other
end of the wire, delighted with her own audacity.</p>

<p>He said: "Shall I call you up at one o'clock when I get into
town?"</p>

<p>"Try it. I may awake."</p>

<p>"Very well then. I'll make them ring till daylight."</p>

<p>"Oh, they won't have to do that! I always know, about five minutes
before you call me, that you are going to."</p>

<p>"You uncanny little thing! You've said that before."</p>

<p>"It's true. I knew before you called me that you would. It's
a vague feeling&mdash;a &mdash;I don't know.... And oh, Louis, it <em>is</em>
hot in this room! Are you cool out there in the country?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I hate to be when I think of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you are. It's one comfort, anyway. John Burleson called
me up and asked me to go to Manhattan Beach, but somehow it didn't
appeal to me.... I've rather missed you."</p>

<p>"Have you?"</p>

<p>"Really."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll admit I've missed you."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>Sure thing! I wish to heaven I were in town now. We would go
somewhere."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish so, too."</p>

<p>"Isn't it the limit!"</p>

<p>"It is, Kelly. Can't you be a real god for a moment and come
floating into my room in a golden cloud?"</p>

<p>"Shall I try?"</p>

<p>"<em>Please</em> do."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll do my god-like best. And anyway I'll call you
up at one. Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night."</p>

<p>He went back to the girl waiting for him in the starlight.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, smiling at his altered expression, "you certainly
have recovered your spirits."</p>

<p>He laughed and took her unreluctant fingers and kissed them&mdash;a
boyishly impulsive expression of the gay spirits which might have
perplexed him or worried him to account for if he had tried to
analyse them. But he didn't; he was merely conscious of a sudden
inrush of high spirits&mdash;of a warm feeling for all the world&mdash;this
star-set world, so still and sweet-scented.</p>

<p>"Stephanie, dear," he said, smiling, "you know perfectly well
that I think&mdash;always have thought&mdash;that there was nobody like
you. You know that, don't you?"</p>

<p>She laughed, but her pulses quickened a little.</p>

<p>"Well, then," he went on. "I take it for granted that our understanding
is as delightfully thorough as it has always been&mdash;a warm, cordial
intimacy which leaves us perfectly unembarrassed&mdash;perfectly free
to express our affection for each other without fear of being
misunderstood."</p>

<p>The girl lifted her blue eyes: "Of course."</p>

<p>"That's what I told Lily," he nodded, delighted. I told her that
you and I understood each other&mdash;that it was silly of her to suspect
anything sentimental in our comradeship; that whenever the real
thing put in an appearance and came tagging down the pike after
you, you'd sink the gaff into him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Rope him and paste your monogram all over him."</p>

<p>"I certainly will," she said, laughing. Eyes and lips and voice
were steady; but the tumult in her brain confused her.</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I told Lily," he said. "She seems to think
that if two people frankly enjoy each other's society they want
to marry each other. All married women are that way. Like clever
decoys they take genuine pleasure in bringing the passing string
under the guns."</p>

<p>He laughed and kissed her pretty fingers again:</p>

<p>"Don't you listen to my sister. Freedom's a good thing; and people
are selfish when happy; they don't set up a racket to attract
others into their private paradise."</p>

<p>"Oh, Louis, that is really horrid of you. Don't you think Lily
is happy?"</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;in a way. You can't have a perfectly good husband and
baby, and have the fun of being courted by other aspirants, too.
Of course married women are happy; but they give up a lot. And
sometimes it slightly irritates them to remember it when they
see the unmarried innocently frisking as they once frisked. And
it's their instinct to call out 'Come in! Matrimony's fine! You
don't know what you are missing!'"</p>

<p>Stephanie laughed and lay back in her steamer chair, her hand
abandoned to him. And when her mirth had passed a slight sense
of fatigue left her silent, inert, staring at nothing.</p>

<p>When the time came to say <em>adieu</em> he kissed her as he
sometimes did, with a smiling and impersonal tenderness&mdash;not conscious
of the source of all this happy, demonstrative, half impatient
animation which seemed to possess him in every fibre.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, you dear girl," he said, as the lights of the motor
lit up the drive. "I've had a bully time, and I'll see you soon
again."</p>

<p>"Come when you can, Louis. There is no man I would rather see."</p>

<p>"And no girl I would rather go to," he said, warmly, scarcely
thinking what he was saying.</p>

<p>Their clasped hands relaxed, fell apart. He went in to take leave
of Lily and Gordon and their guests, then emerged hastily and
sprang into the car.</p>

<p>Overhead the June stars watched him as he sped through the fragrant
darkness. But with him, time lagged; even the train crawled as
he timed it to the ticking seconds of his opened watch.</p>

<p>In the city a taxi swallowed him and his haste; and it seemed
as though he would never get to his studio and to the telephone;
but at last he heard her voice&mdash;a demure, laughing little voice:</p>

<p>"I didn't think you'd be brute enough to do it!"</p>

<p>"But you said I might call you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are many things that a girl says from which she expects
a man to infer, tactfully and mercifully, the contrary."</p>

<p>"Did I wake you, Valerie? I'm terribly sorry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you are sorry I'll retire to my pillow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll ring you up again!"</p>

<p>"Oh, if you employ threats I think I'd better listen to you.
What have you to say to me?"</p>

<p>"What were you doing when I rang you up?"</p>

<p>"I Wish I could say that I was asleep. But I can't. And if I
tell the truth I've got to flatter you. So I refuse to answer."</p>

<p>"You were not waiting up for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kelly! I refuse to answer! Anyway you didn't keep your word
to me."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You promised to appear in a golden cloud!"</p>

<p>"Something went wrong with the Olympian machinery," he explained,
"and I was obliged to take the train.... What are you doing there,
anyway?"</p>

<p>"Now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, now."</p>

<p>"Why, I'm sitting at the telephone in my night-dress talking
to an exceedingly inquisitive gentleman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean were you reading more psalms?"</p>

<p>"No. If you must know, I was reading 'Bocaccio'"</p>

<p>He could hear her laughing.</p>

<p>"I was meaning to ask you how you'd spent the day," he began.
"Haven't you been out at all?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I'm not under vows, Kelly."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Now I wonder whether I'm expected to account for every minute
when I'm not with you? I'm beginning to believe that it's a sort
of monstrous vanity that incites you to such questions. And I'm
going to inform you that I did <em>not</em> spend the day sitting
by the window and thinking about you."</p>

<p>"What <em>did</em> you do?"</p>

<p>"I motored in the Park. I lunched at Woodmanston with a perfectly
good young man. I enjoyed it."</p>

<p>"Who was the man?"</p>

<p>"Sam."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Neville, laughing.</p>

<p>"You make me perfectly furious by laughing," she exclaimed. "I
wish I could tell you that I'd been to Niagara Falls with José
Querida!"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't believe it, anyway."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't believe it myself, even if I had done it," she said,
naïvely. There was a pause; then:</p>

<p>"I'm going to retire. Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night, Valerie."</p>

<p>"Louis!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You say the golden-cloud machinery isn't working?"</p>

<p>"It seems to have slipped a cog."</p>

<p>"Oh! I thought you might have mended it and that&mdash;perhaps &mdash;I
had better not leave my window open."</p>

<p>"That cloud is warranted to float through solid masonry."</p>

<p>"You alarm me, Kelly."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, but the gods never announce their visits."</p>

<p>"I know it.... And I suppose I must sleep in a dinner gown. When
one receives a god it's a full-dress affair, isn't it?"</p>

<p>He laughed, not mistaking her innocent audacity.</p>

<p>"Unexpected Olympians must take their chances," he said. "...
Are you sleepy?"</p>

<p>"Fearfully."</p>

<p>"Then I won't keep you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I hope you won't be rude enough to dismiss me before I have
a chance to give you your <em>congé</em>!"</p>

<p>"You blessed child. I could stay here all night listening to
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Could you? That's a temptation."</p>

<p>"To you, Valerie?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a temptation to make a splendid exit. Every girl adores
being regretted. So I'll hang up the receiver, I think.... Good
night, Kelly, dear.... Good night, Louis. <em>À demain!&mdash;non&mdash;pardon!
à bien tôt!&mdash;parceque il est deux heures de matin! Et&mdash;vous m'avez
rendu bien heureuse.</em>"</p>
