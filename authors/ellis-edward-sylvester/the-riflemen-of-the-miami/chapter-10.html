<p>
The red-breast, perched in arbor green,<br/>
Sad minstrel of the quiet scene,<br/>
While hymning, for the dying sun,<br/>
Strains like a broken-hearted one,<br/>
Raised not her mottled wings to fly,<br/>
As swept those silent warriors by.<br/>
&mdash;W. H. C. <em>HOSMER</em>.

<p>The Huron stood a moment as motionless as a statue; then, bending
slowly forward, still holding one hand partly raised as a signal
for the hunter to retain his immobility, he took several steps
forward, so lightly and cautiously that there was absolutely no
sound at all produced. He then sunk slowly downward, and seemed
to concentrate all his faculties into the single one of sight.
This lasted but a moment, when he arose to the upright position,
and, turning his head, signified to O'Hara that he might approach.
The latter did so, and immediately saw the cause of his cautious
movements. Drawn up on the bank, so as to be entirely free of
the water, with the bottom turned upward, lay an Indian's canoe.
It was made of bark, beautifully shaped, and it was evident had
not been used for a considerable time.</p>

<p>They silently surveyed this object for some time, when Oonamoo,
who had also been examining the earth around it gave vent to a
chuckling, guttural laugh&mdash;a sure sign that he had made some discovery
which delighted him hugely. It would have been an amusing sight
for any one to have seen this expression of pleasure upon the
dark, stoical face of the Huron. There was scarcely a change of
his features, but such as was perceptible would have been mistaken
by an ordinary observer as an evidence that he was undergoing
some physical pain.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? what is it that pleases you, Oonamoo?" asked
O'Hara, considerably puzzled to understand the cause.</p>

<p>"Shawnee fool &mdash;Miami fool&mdash;don't know notting."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"<em>He come out dere!</em>" he replied, pointing at the end
of the canoe which lay nearest the water, and then indulging his
characteristic chuckle again.</p>

<p>As we have hinted in the preceding pages, O'Hara was a most skillful
backwoodsman, having few superiors among those of his own color.
When he chose to exercise his wood-craft, the true cause of his
being termed a lucky hunter was apparent, it being nothing more
than his wonderful skill and shrewdness. But, remarkable as were
those qualities in him, he was by no means equal to the Huron.
Those signs, invisible in the deep labyrinths of the woods to
common eyes, were as plain to him as the printed pages of the
book to the scholar. In the preceding chapter, we have endeavored
to give some idea of the skill he displayed when these qualities
were called into requisition. O'Hara, understanding perfectly
the superior ability of his dusky friend, relied upon him to solve
all difficulties that might arise, scarcely making any effort
himself to do so. This will account for his apparent ignorance
of the secrets of the forest, which, perhaps has been noticed
by the reader.</p>

<p>"Shawnee fool &mdash;Miami fool&mdash;don't know notting," repeated
the Huron.</p>

<p>"They don't know as much as you, that's sartin; but I've found
more than once they knowed enough to satisfy me."</p>

<p>"<em>He come out dere</em>," said Oonamoo, again.</p>

<p>Finding there was little chance of gaining what information he
wished from the Indian, O'Hara set about solving the difficulty
himself. The former having announced that Dernor had left the
creek at this point, it now remained for him to determine by what
means he had thrown his pursuers off the scent, as it was very
manifest he had done. The ground around the canoe was quite wet
and spongy, showing the numerous footprints with considerable
distinctness. Among these, it was very easy to distinguish that
of the leader of the Riflemen. The instant O'Hara saw this, he
became aware of the curious fact that it was more <em>recent than
those of the Indian</em>, proving that Dernor had <em>followed
them</em>, instead of they having followed him! How this was accomplished,
the hunter was at a loss to determine, although, from the expression
of the Indian's face, he knew it was all plain to him.</p>

<p>"Lew has gone over this ground last," said O'Hara, "but how he
has done it, I can't see just now. How was it?"</p>

<p>"<em>Look under canoe</em>," said Oonamoo.</p>

<p>O'Hara's eyes opened, as he began to comprehend matters. He carefully
raised one end of the canoe, and saw at once that his leader had
lain beneath it, while his enemies were searching for him. A few
words more from the Huron, and every thing was explained. Believing
the reader will be interested in the description of the ingenious
artifice adopted by the hunter, we here give it as briefly as
possible.</p>

<p>It may seem incredible that Lewis Dernor should have been concealed
beneath this Indian canoe, when fully a dozen savages were thirsting
for his scalp, and when it would have appeared the height of absurdity
to think that they would fail to look beneath it. Nevertheless,
such was really the case. It happened in the following manner:</p>

<p>When the Rifleman discovered the canoe lying against the bank,
he sprung from the water, coming upon the frail barken structure
with such force that he perceptibly started the bottom. It thus
appeared to have been deserted for its uselessness. Stepping off
of this upon the swampy ground, he walked about twenty yards up
the bank, when he turned to the left, and approached the water
again. The trail which he left was so distinct that no one could
fail to see, he having purposely made it thus. Instead of taking
to the water again, as it would appear he had done, he merely
entered its margin, and then walked backward to the canoe again,
stepping so exactly in his own footsteps, that the wily Shawnees
and Miamis had no suspicion of the stratagem practiced. Reaching
the canoe, he managed to lift it, without changing its position,
when he lowered it again, without making any additional footprints.
This done, he slipped beneath it, drew up his feet, and confidently
awaited the approach of the savages.</p>

<p>In about twenty minutes they came up. The foremost paused, upon
seeing the canoe with its cracked bottom, and were about to overturn
it, when their eyes rested upon the footprints of the fugitive.
There was no need of looking beneath it, for they could see the
direction he had taken. He was going at such speed that they had
no time to pause, and they immediately dashed off in pursuit,
the others following suit, like so many hounds. So soon as he
was satisfied they were out of sight, the Rifleman came from beneath
the canoe, carefully setting it back in its place again, and struck
off in the woods at a more leisurely gait.</p>

<p>"All safe&mdash;nebber git on track agin," said Oonamoo.</p>

<p>"Don't believe they will. By gracious! but I should hate to try
that trick of Lew's. Just s'pose they had looked under! it would
have been all up with him. I daresn't use such means, 'cause I
haven't got legs enough, for emergencies. Where does the trail
lead to now, Oonamoo?"</p>

<p>"Where gal hid&mdash;go get her now &mdash;Injin know notting about
it."</p>

<p>"I s'pose Lew will take his time now, as he knows he's got the
dogs off his track."</p>

<p>"Go slow little ways&mdash;then run fast&mdash;want to see gal."</p>

<p>The Huron certainly displayed some knowledge of the workings
of the heart when he remarked, in substance, that, although the
lover might proceed at a moderate gait for some distance, it would
not be long before the thoughts of Edith would urge him to as
great exertions as he had displayed during the height of the chase.
True to what he had said, O'Hara noticed that his footsteps gradually
lengthened until it was manifest that he had been "letting himself
out" again.</p>

<p>It was now getting well along in the afternoon. The Huron struck
into a sort of a compromise between a walk and a trot, he being
anxious to make what progress he could before darkness set in.
They had come too far to overtake Dernor and Edith the next day,
and O'Hara began really to believe that the two had reached the
settlement by this time. Upon mentioning this supposition to Oonamoo,
the latter shook his head&mdash;meaning that all danger had not been
overcome by the fugitives. The woods were too full of Indians,
and the settlement was too far away for them to accomplish the
rest of their journey without danger.</p>

<p>Objects were just growing indistinct, when O'Hara and the Huron
came upon the bushes where Edith had been concealed. They saw
that Dernor had approached on the opposite side from which he
had left it, and that upon being rejoined by his charge, he had
once more started northward, as if his desire was still to remain
above his enemies, and avoid, as much as lay in his power, all
probabilities of encountering them.</p>

<p>"I s'pose we've got to lay on our oars, as the sailors say, till
daylight," said O'Hara.</p>

<p>The Huron looked at him, as if he failed to comprehend him, and
he added, in explanation:</p>

<p>"There being no light, of course we can't see their tracks, and
will have to wait till morning."</p>

<p>"No wait&mdash;go on all night."</p>

<p>"How will you do that?"</p>

<p>"Oonamoo know which way dey go."</p>

<p>"I don't deny that, but, smart as you are, I don't believe you
can see a trail on such a night as this."</p>

<p>"Don't want to see trail&mdash;know which way go&mdash;go up, then go off
toward settlement."</p>

<p>O'Hara understood that the Huron had formed his idea of the general
direction which the Rifleman had taken, and intended to follow
him in this manner. Being thoroughly well acquainted with the
country, there was no difficulty in doing this; and, without pausing
to think of drink or food, the two resumed their pursuit as hopefully
and confidently as though the matter were already settled.</p>

<p>To follow up thus persistently one of the most skillful border-men
of the period, with the desire of assisting him in whatever strait
he may have gotten himself, would have been the acme of absurdity
upon the part of those undertaking it, and would have gained for
them no thanks for attempting it, had the circumstances been difficult.
But, incommoded as he was by the charge of Edith, and environed
by enemies, it could hardly be expected that he would come through
unscathed. His enemies, fully aware of the difficulties of his
situation, undoubtedly were using every endeavor to thwart him,
it being certain that they were aware of his identity. To have
captured the leader of the Riflemen of the Miami would have been
a feat of which even a war-party would have been proud, and the
Huron well knew they would not give over their efforts until he
was absolutely beyond their reach. This was the reason why he
was so anxious to press forward as far as it would be prudent
to venture during the darkness.</p>

<p>By midnight the two had reached a point above which the Huron
believed the fugitives would not go; and being unable to determine
the precise course which they had taken after this, they concluded
to wait until daylight before going further. Accordingly they
lay down on the ground, both dropping to sleep immediately, and
both waking at precisely the same moment, just as the light of
the day was appearing.</p>

<p>A half-hour's search discovered the trail of their friends within
several hundred yards of where they had slept&mdash;thus close and
exact had been the calculation of the sagacious Huron. He and
O'Hara now began to entertain hopes that, after all, the fugitives
had succeeded in reaching the settlement. The latter, at the most,
was not more than twenty miles distant; and, had Dernor been allowed
the entire night to travel, he could have safely reached it. A
critical examination of his footprints, however, revealed the
fact that they had not been made more than twenty hours before.
If he had reached the settlement, therefore, he must have done
it in the latter part of the preceding day.</p>

<p>The two now pressed on with all haste. They had gone scarcely
a half-mile, when both made a startling discovery. Numerous moccasin-tracks
became suddenly visible, and O'Hara needed no prompting to understand
that the persistent Indians were again upon the trail of the fugitives.
How they had succeeded in regaining it, after being so cleverly
misled, was a mystery. The Huron accounted for it only upon the
supposition that they had come upon it by accident. A slight comparison
of the two trails by Oonamoo showed that the savages were close
behind their friends&mdash;so close that they could overtake them ere
they could reach their destination&mdash;the settlement.</p>
