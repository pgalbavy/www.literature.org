<p>The Indian warrior whom Terry Clark saw advancing stealthily
through the undergrowth, cow-bell in hand, was a frightful object.
His head and shoulders were bent forward, and he was stepping
slowly and silently, while he glanced from right to left, as if
searching for some object, or awaiting the occurrence of an expected
event. His face was daubed with black and red paint, his long
hair, as coarse as that of a horse's tail, dangled about his shoulders
and alongside his neck, so that his eyes, when staring through
it, seemed to be blazing among so much tangled brush. The ordinary
hunting shirt, fringed in front, inclosed his chest, and was gathered
at the waist by a sash or belt into which were thrust his hunting
knife and tomahawk. The usual breechcloth, leggins and moccasins
completed his dress.</p>

<p>He carried a fine rifle in his left hand, in a trailing position,
while a powder horn and bullet pouch were supported by a string
passing over his shoulder. He was what may be called a thoroughly
equipped warrior, without taking into account the cow-bell, which
was suspended by the thumb and fingers of the right hand. It was
thus he must have grasped the implement when he caused it to give
out the sound that caught the ear of Fred Linden and Terry Clark.
But at the moment the Irish lad saw him, and for some minutes
after, he held the bell in such careful poise that it gave no
sound at all.</p>

<p>The Indian probably suspected his imitation of the action of
the animal was so poor that it was likely to cause distrust, and
therefore he was sparing in resorting to the stratagem.</p>

<p>Now, nothing can be clearer than that if the warrior was in such
a plain view of Terry Clark, the latter was equally exposed to
his eye. The Indian was moving in his guarded fashion over a course
at right angles to that followed by the lad, who was quick to
realize his peril. He knew that every second he remained thus
exposed he was likely to be seen. He had hardly taken a glance
of his enemy, when he stooped so that his knees almost touched
the ground, and moved as noiselessly and quickly as he could to
the nearest tree, behind which he took shelter.</p>

<p>This tree was an oak, large enough to hide two such boys, standing
side by side, so that the youth felt secure for the time.</p>

<p>"Ah, if I only had me gun," was the regret that naturally came
to him; "I would quickly settle with the spalpeen that stole old
Brindle, and now wants to run away wid me."</p>

<p>It will be admitted that the situation of Terry was peculiar,
for he was quite close to the warrior, who, there was every reason
to believe, was hunting for him, and who was so nigh that there
was imminent danger of discovery. It might be asked why the redskin
should have taken this course, for in some respects it had more
than one absurd feature. If he wanted to kill a white person,
all this maneuvering with a cow-bell was ridiculous, while his
conduct from first to last was in some respects unreasonable.
The best explanation was that which was made sometime afterward
by a person, who as yet has not been introduced to the reader,
but who, when he does appear, will be admitted to be the best
judge. I allude to Deerfoot the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>The Indian with the cow-bell was a Winnebago warrior, whose home
was a long ways to the northward, but who had gone thither in
company with several others on what may be called a tour of investigation.
The driving off of the cow was probably an inspiration of the
moment. The Indians kept her until they had got all the milk they
wanted, first removing the bell so that her friends could not
recover her until they were through. The stratagem which I have
been describing was an afterthought. None of the Winnebagos except
the one who tried the plan would have any thing to do with it,
though they were willing enough that every white person in the
settlement of Greville should perish, if the same could be brought
about without risk to them.</p>

<p>Left to himself, the Winnebago decided to make a prisoner of
whomsoever should be sent to find the cow. He had reason to believe
that this person would be a youth, and since every thing was so
quiet in that section, he was not likely to be armed. Hence, it
would be an easy matter to decoy him a goodly distance from the
settlement, when the warrior could pounce upon, make him a prisoner
and compel him to go with him. After the couple were far enough
from the settlement the lad could be put to death, if his captor
or the party to which the captor belonged, should so elect.</p>

<p>Terry Clark had stood behind the sheltering tree for perhaps
five minutes, when he became aware of an alarming fact: the warrior
with the bell was slowly approaching him. The faint tinkle that
it gave out once or twice told this, and when finally the lad
ventured to peep around the side of the tree, the sight was a
startling one. The Indian had risen almost to the upright posture,
and holding the gun and bell as described, was moving directly
toward the oak behind which the boy stood. Moreover at the moment
the latter took the cautious look, the visage of the Indian showed
that he was looking straight at the tree.</p>

<p>"By the powers!" gasped Terry, "but the spalpeen observed me,
and I'm thinkin' that he saw me before I did him."</p>

<p>It was not at all unlikely that such was the case. The Indian
may have felt sure of his victim, and so he indulged in a little
by-play, as a cat often does with a mouse. Such a cruel proceeding
was characteristic of his race.</p>

<p>The belief that this was the case placed Terry Clark in a most
trying position. He was without the means with which to defend
himself, and in fact was hopeless. It was useless to try to run
away, for if the warrior could not overtake him at once, he could
bring him down with his rifle.</p>

<p>You know how rare a thing it is for an Irishman to submit meekly,
even when there is no hope in resistance. Terry muttered:</p>

<p>"If he lays hands on me, there's going to be a fight; I wish
Fred was near, that he could see that I git fair play."</p>

<p>No person could have been more in earnest than was the Irish
lad.</p>

<p>"I'll wait till his head comes round the corner of that tree
and then I'll give him a whack that'll tumble him over on his
back, afore he knows what's the matter wid him; then I'll amuse
myself wid hammerin' him after he is down till I git tired and
then I'll take his gun and knife and tomahawk and the bell and
make him walk before me to the sittlement."</p>

<p>The lad had just gone over in his mind this roseate programme,
when a soft tinkle told him that the Winnebago was within a few
steps of the tree; and at the same moment that the youth made
this interesting discovery, another still more astonishing one
broke upon him.</p>

<p>Just fifty feet away and behind a trunk very similar to the one
that sheltered the lad, stood a second Indian warrior. His position
was such that he was in plain view of Terry, though the Winnebago
could not see him except when the latter should approach quite
close to the shelter of the boy. The strange Indian was closely
watching the hostile one, and, with that remarkable intuition
that sometimes comes to a person in grave crises, Terry was convinced
that he was an enemy of the Winnebago, though whether a friend
of the youth was not so certain.</p>

<p>In his amazement, the lad for the moment forgot his own danger
and gave his attention to the stranger, who was the most striking
looking warrior he had ever seen. He seemed to be about eighteen
or twenty years of age, and was the picture of manly grace and
beauty.</p>

<p>He had long, luxuriant black hair which hung about his shoulders,
being gathered by a loose band at the neck, so as to keep it from
getting in front of his eyes. In the crown of this natural covering
were thrust three stained eagle feathers, while there were two
rows of colored beads around the neck. The fringed hunting shirt
which reached almost to his knees was of a dull, yellow color
and the sash or belt around the waist was of a dark red. A small
but handsome bracelet encircled his left wrist, and the fringes
of his leggins were of varied and brilliant hues, as were the
beaded moccasins that incased his shapely feet. A tomahawk and
knife were in his girdle, while he held a finely ornamented rifle
in his right hand, the manner in which he manipulated the weapon
showing that he was left-handed.</p>

<p>The face was strikingly fine, the nose being slightly aquiline,
the cheek bones less prominent, and the whole contour more symmetrical
than is generally the case with his race. There was something
in the situation that evidently amused him, for Terry saw him
smile so unmistakably that he noticed his small and regular white
teeth.</p>

<p>It was plain that he was watching the movements of the Winnebago,
though he said nothing, and made no gesture to the lad, whose
wondering look he must have understood. Be that as it may, the
sight of the strange Indian, and the belief that he was an enemy
of the other with the cow-bell, inspired the Irish lad with a
courage that he would not have known had the other warrior been
absent.</p>

<p>"He's waiting to see how I condooct mesilf when the spalpeen
lays hands on me," thought Terence; "he won't have to wait long."</p>

<p>The youth was right. The crouching Winnebago, doubtless feeling
that he had no immediate use for the bell that had served him
so well, dropped it to the ground beside him, and holding only
his rifle in hand, stepped forward with the same cat-like tread
that had marked his advance from the first. He knew that his victim
was shrinking behind the trunk of the oak, and he was having his
own peculiar sport with him.</p>

<p>So intense was the attention of Terry that he heard distinctly
the footsteps of the warrior, who a moment later was close enough
to touch the tree with his hand, had he been so minded.</p>
