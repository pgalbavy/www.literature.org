<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Marche, buried under a mountain of bed clothes, dreamed that
people were rapping noisily on his door, and grinned in his dream,
meaning to let them rap until they tired of it. Suddenly a voice
sounded through his defiant slumbers, clear and charming as a
golden ray parting thick clouds. The next moment he found himself
awake, bolt upright in the icy dusk of his room, listening.</p>

<p>"Mr. Marche! Won't you <em>please</em> wake up and answer?" came
the clear, young voice again.</p>

<p>"I <em>beg</em> your pardon!" he cried. "I'll be down in a minute!"</p>

<p>He heard her going away downstairs, and for a few seconds he
squatted there, huddled in coverings to the chin, and eying the
darkness in a sort of despair. The feverish drive of Wall Street,
late suppers, and too much good fellowship had not physically
hardened Marche. He was accustomed to have his bath tempered comfortably
for his particular brand of physique. Breakfast, also, was a most
carefully ordered informality with him.</p>

<p>The bitter chill smote him. Cursing the simple life, he crawled
gingerly out of bed, suffered acutely while hunting for a match,
lighted the kerosene lamp with stiffened fingers, and looked about
him, shivering. Then, with a suppressed anathema, he stepped into
his folding tub and emptied the arctic contents of the water pitcher
over himself.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he appeared at the breakfast table, hungrier
than he had been in years. There was nobody there to wait on him,
but the dishes and coffee pot were piping hot, and he madly ate
eggs and razor-back, and drank quantities of coffee, and finally
set fire to a cigarette, feeling younger and happier than he had
felt for ages.</p>

<p>Of one thing he was excitedly conscious: that dreadful and persistent
dragging feeling at the nape of his neck had vanished. It didn't
seem possible that it could have disappeared overnight, but it
had, for the present, at least.</p>

<p>He went into the sitting room. Nobody was there, either, so he
broke his sealed shell boxes, filled his case with sixes and fives
and double B's, drew his expensive ducking gun from its case and
took a look at it, buckled the straps of his hip boots to his
belt, felt in the various pockets of his shooting coat to see
whether matches, pipe, tobacco, vaseline, oil, shell extractor,
knife, handkerchief, gloves, were in their proper places; found
them so, and, lighting another cigarette, strolled contentedly
around the small and almost bare room, bestowing a contented and
patronizing glance upon each humble article and decoration as
he passed.</p>

<p>Evidently this photograph, in an oval frame of old-time water
gilt, was a portrait of Miss Herold's mother. What a charming
face, with its delicate, high-bred nose and lips! The boy, Jim,
had her mouth and nose, and his sister her eyes, slightly tilted
to a slant at the outer corners&mdash;beautifully shaped eyes, he remembered.</p>

<p>He lingered a moment, then strolled on, viewing with tolerant
indifference the few poor ornaments on the mantel, the chromos
of wild ducks and shore birds, and found himself again by the
lamp-lit table from which he had started his explorations.</p>

<p>On it were Jim's Latin book, a Bible, and several last year's
magazines.</p>

<p>Idly he turned the flyleaf of the schoolbook. Written there was
the boy's name&mdash;"Jim, from Daddy."</p>

<p>As he was closing the cover a sudden instinct arrested his hand,
and, not knowing exactly why, he reopened the book and read the
inscription again. He read it again, too, with a vague sensation
of familiarity with it, or with the book, or something somehow
connected with it, he could not tell exactly what; but a slightly
uncomfortable feeling remained as he laid aside the book and stood
with brows knitted and eyes absently bent on the stove.</p>

<p>The next moment Jim came in, wearing a faded overcoat which he
had outgrown.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said Marche, looking up. "Are you ready for me, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What sort of a chance have I?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it is blue-bird weather," said the boy diffidently.</p>

<p>Marche scowled, then smiled. "Your sister said it would probably
be that kind of weather. Well, we all have to take a sporting
chance with things in general, don't we, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Marche picked up his gun case and cartridge box. The boy offered
to take them, but the young man shook his head.</p>

<p>"Lead on, old sport!" he said cheerily. "I'm a beast of more
burdens than you know anything about. How's your father, by the
way?"</p>

<p>"I think father is about the same."</p>

<p>"Doesn't he need a doctor?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I think not."</p>

<p>"What is it, Jim? Fever?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the boy, in a low voice. He led the way,
and Marche followed him out of doors.</p>

<p>A gray light made plain the desolation of the scene, although
the sun had not yet risen. To the south and west the sombre pine
woods stretched away; eastward, a few last year's cornstalks stood,
withered in the clearing, through which a rutted road ran down
to the water.</p>

<p>"It isn't the finest farming land in the world, is it, Jim?"
he said humorously.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen any other land," said the boy quietly.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember the Northern country at all?"</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;except Central Park."</p>

<p>"Oh, you were New-Yorkers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Father&#11834;" and he fell abruptly silent.</p>

<p>They were walking together down the rutted road, and Marche glanced
around at him.</p>

<p>"What were you going to say about your father, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Nothing." Then truth jogged his arm. "I mean I was only going
to say that father and mother and all of us lived there."</p>

<p>"In New York?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Is your&mdash;your mother living?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"I think I saw her picture in the sitting room," he said gently.
"She must have been everything a mother should be."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Was it long ago, Jim?"</p>

<p>"When she died?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Yes, very long ago. Six years ago."</p>

<p>"Before you came here, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>After they had walked in silence for a little while, Marche said,
"I suppose you have arranged for somebody to take me out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>They emerged from the lane to the shore at the same moment, and
Marche glanced about for the expected bayman.</p>

<p>"Oh, there he is!" he said, as a figure came from behind a dory
and waded leisurely shoreward through the shallows&mdash;a slight figure
in hip boots and wool shooting hood and coat, who came lightly
across the sands to meet him. And, astonished, he looked into
the gray eyes of Molly Herold.</p>

<p>"Father could not take you," she said, without embarrassment,
"and Jim isn't quite big enough to manage the swans and geese.
Do you mind my acting as your bayman?"</p>

<p>"Mind?" he repeated. "No, of course not. Only&mdash;it seems rather
rough on you. Couldn't you have hired a bayman for me?"</p>

<p>"I will, if you wish," she said, her cheeks reddening. "But,
really, if you'll let me, I am perfectly accustomed to bayman's
work."</p>

<p>"Do you <em>want</em> to do it?"</p>

<p>She said, without self-consciousness, "If it is the same to you,
Mr. Marche, I had rather that the bayman's wages came to us."</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;of course," he said hurriedly. Then, smiling: "You
look the part. I took you for a young man, at first. Now, tell
me how I can help you."</p>

<p>"Jim can do that. Still, if you don't mind handling the decoys&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Not at all," he said, going up to the fenced inclosures which
ran from a rod or two inland down into the shallow water, making
three separate yards for geese, swans, and ducks.</p>

<p>Jim was already in the duck pen, hustling the several dozen mallard
and black ducks into an inland corral. The indignant birds, quacking
a concerted protest, waddled up from the shore, and, one by one,
the boy seized the suitable ones, and passed them over the fence
to Marche. He handed them to Molly Herold, who waded out to the
dory, a duck tucked under either arm, and slipped them deftly
into the decoy-crates forward and aft.</p>

<p>The geese were harder to manage&mdash;great, sleek, pastel-tinted
birds whose wing blows had the force of a man's fist&mdash;and they
flapped and struggled and buffeted Jim till his blonde head spun;
but at last Marche and Molly had them crated in the dory.</p>

<p>Then the wild swans' turn came&mdash;great, white creatures with black
beaks and feet; and Molly and Marche were laughing as they struggled
to catch them and carry them aboard.</p>

<p>But at last every decoy was squatting in the crates; the mast
had been stepped, guns laid aboard, luncheon stowed away. Marche
set his shoulder to the stern; the girl sprang aboard, and he
followed; the triangular sail filled, and the boat glided out
into the sound, straight into the glittering lens of the rising
sun.</p>

<p>A great winter gull flapped across their bows; in the lee of
Starfish Island, long strings of wild ducks rose like shredded
clouds, and, swarming in the sky, swinging, drifting, sheered
eastward, out toward the unseen Atlantic.</p>

<p>"Bluebills and sprigs," said the girl, resting her elbow on the
tiller. "There are geese on the shoal, yonder. They've come out
from Currituck. Oh, I'm afraid it's to be blue-bird weather, Mr.
Marche."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it is," he assented, smiling. "What do you do in
that case, Miss Herold?"</p>

<p>"Go to sleep in the blind," she admitted, with a faint smile,
the first delicate approach to anything resembling the careless
confidence of camaraderie that had yet come from her.</p>

<p>"See the ducks!" she said, as bunch after bunch parted from the
water, distantly, yet all around them, and, gathering like clouds
of dusky bees, whirled away through the sky until they seemed
like bands of smoke high drifting. Presently she turned and looked
back, signaling adieu to the shore, where her brother lifted his
arm in response, then turned away inland.</p>

<p>"That's a nice boy," said Marche briefly, and glanced up to see
in his sister's face the swift and exquisite transformation that
requires no words as answer.</p>

<p>"You seem to like him," said he, laughing.</p>

<p>Molly Herold's gray eyes softened; pride, that had made the love
in them brilliant, faded until they grew almost sombre. Silent,
her aloof gaze remained fixed on the horizon; her lips rested
on each other in sensitive curves. There was no sound save the
curling of foam under the bows.</p>

<p>Marche looked elsewhere; then looked at her again. She sat motionless,
gray eyes remote, one little, wind-roughened hand on the tiller.
The steady breeze filled the sail; the dory stood straight away
toward the blinding glory of the sunrise.</p>

<p>Through the unreal golden light, raft after raft of wild ducks
rose and whirled into the east; blue herons flopped across the
water; a silver-headed eagle, low over the waves, winged his way
heavily toward some goal, doggedly intent upon his own business.</p>

<p>Outside Starfish Shoal the girl eased the sheet as the wind freshened.
Far away on Golden Bar thousands of wild geese, which had been
tipping their sterns skyward in plunging quest of nourishment,
resumed a more stately and normal posture, as though at a spoken
command; and the long ranks, swimming, and led by age and wisdom,
slowly moved away into the glittering east.</p>

<p>At last, off the starboard bow, the low, reedy levels of Foam
Island came into view, and in a few minutes more the dory lay
in the shallows, oars, mast, and rag stowed; and the two young
people splashed busily about in their hip boots, carrying guns,
ammunition, and food into the blind.</p>

<p>Then Molly Herold, standing on the mud bank, flung, one by one,
a squadron of wooden, painted, canvasback decoys into the water,
where they righted themselves, and presently rode the waves, bobbing
and steering with startling fidelity to the real things.</p>

<p>Then it came the turn of the real things. Marche and Molly, a
struggling bird tucked under each arm, waded out along the lanes
of stools, feeling about under the icy water until their fingers
encountered the wire-cored cords. Then, to the leg rings of each
madly flapping duck and swan and goose they snapped on the leads,
and the tethered birds, released, beat the water into foam and
flapped and splashed and tugged, until, finally reconciled, they
began to souse themselves with great content, and either mounted
their stools or swam calmly about as far as their tethers permitted.</p>

<p>Marche, struggling knee-deep in the water, his arms full of wildly
flapping gander, hailed Molly for instructions.</p>

<p>"That's a mated bird!" she called out to him. "Peg him outside
by himself!"</p>

<p>So Marche pegged out the furious old gander, whose name was Uncle
Dudley, and in a few minutes that dignified and insulted bird,
missing his spouse, began to talk about it.</p>

<p>Every wifely feeling outraged, his spouse replied loudly from
the extreme end of the inner lane, telling her husband, and every
duck, goose, and swan in the vicinity, what she thought of such
an inhuman separation.</p>

<p>Molly laughed, and so did Marche. Duck after duck, goose after
goose, joined indignantly in the conversation. The mallard drakes
twisted their emerald-green heads and began that low, half gurgling,
half quacking conversation in which their mottled brown and gray
mates joined with louder quacks. The geese conversed freely; but
the long-necked swans held their peace, occupied with the problem
of picking to pieces the snaps on their anklets.</p>

<p>"Now," said Molly breathlessly, as the last madly protesting
bird had been stooled, "let's get into the blind as soon as we
can, Mr. Marche. There may be ducks in Currituck still, and every
minute counts now."</p>

<p>So Marche towed the dory around to the westward and drew it into
a channel where it might lie concealed under the reeds.</p>

<p>When he came across to the blind he found Molly there, seated
on the plank in the cemented pit behind the screen of reeds and
rushes, laying out for him his cartridges.</p>

<p>There they were, in neat rows on the rail, fives, sixes, and
a few of swanshot, ranged in front of him. And his 12-gauge, all
ready, save for the loading, lay across the pit to his right.
So he dropped his booted feet into the wooden tub where a foot-warmer
lay, picked up the gun, slid a pair of sixes into it, laid it
beside him, and turned toward Miss Herold.</p>

<p>The wool collar of her sweater was turned up about her delicately
molded throat and face. The wild-rose color ran riot in her cheeks,
and her eyes, sky tinted now, were wide open under the dark lashes,
and the wind stirred her hair till it rippled bronze and gold
under the edge of her shooting hood. She, too, was perfectly ready.
A cheap, heavy, and rather rusty gun lay beside her; a heap of
cheap cartridges before her.</p>

<p>She turned, and, catching Marche's eyes, smiled adorably, with
a slight nod of comradeship. Then, the smile still faintly curving
her lips, she crossed her legs in the pit, and, warming her hands
in the pockets of her coat, leaned back, resting against the rail
behind.</p>

<p>"You haven't a foot-warmer," he said.</p>

<p>"I'm not cold&mdash;only my fingers&mdash;a little&mdash;stooling those birds."</p>

<p>They spoke in low voices, under their breath.</p>

<p>He fished from his pocket a flat Japanese hand-warmer, lighted
the paper-cased punk, snapped it shut, and passed it to her. But
she demurred.</p>

<p>"You need it yourself."</p>

<p>"No, I'm all right. Please take it."</p>

<p>So she shyly took it, dropped it into her pocket, and rested
her shapely little hand on it. "How delightful!" she said presently,
shifting it to the other pocket. "Don't you really need it, Mr.
Marche?"</p>

<p>"No. Does it warm you?"</p>

<p>"It is delicious. I <em>was</em> a little chilled." She drew
out one bare hand and looked at it thoughtfully. Then, with a
little sigh, and quite unconscious of his gaze, she touched her
lips to the wind-roughened skin, as though in atonement for her
maltreatment of herself.</p>

<p>Even as it now was the shape and beauty of the hand held Marche
fascinated; it was so small, yet so firm and strong and competent,
so full of youthful character, such a delicately fashioned little
hand, and so pathetic, somehow&mdash;this woman's hand, with its fineness
of texture and undamaged purity under the chapped and cruelly
bruised, tender skin.</p>

<p>She pocketed it again, looking out from under the wind-blown
hair clustering from the edge of her shooting hood. "Blue-bird
weather," she said, in her low and very sweet voice. "If no birds
swing in by ten o'clock we might as well sleep until four."</p>

<p>Marche leaned forward and scanned the water and sky alternately.
Nothing stirred, save their lazily preening decoys. Uncle Dudley
was still conversing with his wife at intervals; the swans and
the cygnets fed or worried their leash snaps; the ducks paddled,
or dozed on the stools, balanced on one leg.</p>

<p>Far away, on Golden Bar, half a thousand wild geese floated,
feeding; beyond, like snowflakes dotting the water, a few wild
swans drifted. There were ducks, too, off Starfish Island again,
but nothing flying in the blue except a slow hawk or some wandering
gull, or now and then an eagle&mdash;sometimes a mature bird, in all
the splendor of white head and tail, sometimes a young bird, seemingly
larger, and all gray from crest to shank.</p>

<p>Once an eagle threatened the decoys, and Uncle Dudley swore so
lustily at him, and every duck and goose set up such a clamor,
that Molly Herold picked up her gun for the emergency. But the
magnificent eagle, beating up into the wind with bronze wings
aglisten, suddenly sheered off; and, as he passed, Marche could
see his bold head turn toward the blind where the sun had flashed
him its telegraphic warning on the barrel of Molly's lifted gun.</p>

<p>"Fine!" he whispered. "Splendid! I'm glad you didn't kill him."</p>

<p>"I'm glad I didn't have to," she said.</p>

<p>"Do you think you could have?"</p>

<p>She turned toward him, wondering whether he might be serious;
then smiled as he smiled.</p>

<p>At the same instant, coming apparently from nowhere, four canvasbacks
suddenly appeared over the clamoring decoys, so close in that,
as they came driving by the blind and rose slightly, wings bowed,
Marche could almost see their beady little eyes set in the chestnut
red of the turning heads. Mechanically his gun spoke twice; rap-rap,
echoed Miss Herold's gun, and splash! splash! down whirled two
gray-and-red ducks; then a third, uncertain, slowed down, far
out beyond the decoys, and slanted sideways to the water. The
fourth went on.</p>

<p>"Duffer that I am," said Marche good-humoredly. "That was a clean
double of yours, Miss Herold!&mdash;clean-cut work."</p>

<p>She said, slightly knitting her straight brows: "I should have
crossed two of them and killed the one you missed. I think I'd
better get the boat."</p>

<p>"No, I'll go out after that kicker," he said, ashamed of his
slovenly work.</p>

<p>Five minutes later he returned with his kicker and her two ducks&mdash;great,
fat, heavy canvasbacks, beautiful in their red, black, and drab
plumage.</p>

<p>"What about blue-bird weather, now?" he laughed.</p>

<p>But she only smiled and said, "I'm very much afraid."</p>

<p>For a long while they sat there, alert behind their wall of rustling
reeds, watching sky and water. False alarms were not infrequent
from their decoys. Sometimes the outbreak of quacking and honking
was occasioned by some wandering gull, sometimes by a circling
hawk or some eagle loitering in mid-heaven on broad and leisurely
wings, reluctant to remain, unwilling to go; sometimes to a pair
or two of widgeon or pintails speeding eastward high in the blue.
But the sparkling, cloudless hours sped away, and no duck or goose
or swan invaded the vicinity. Only one sly old black duck dropped
into the reeds far back on the island; and Marche went after him
with serious designs upon his fraudulent old life.</p>

<p>When the young man returned, twenty minutes later, perfectly
innocent of duck murder, he found the girl curled up in her corner
of the pit, eyes closed, tired little head cradled in the curve
of her left arm. She waked as he slid into the blind, and smiled
at him, pretending not to have been asleep.</p>

<p>"Did you get him?"</p>

<p>"No. He went off at two hundred yards."</p>

<p>"Blue-bird weather," she sighed; and again they exchanged smiles.
He noticed that her eyes had somehow become exceedingly blue instead
of the clear gray which he had supposed was their color. And,
after her brief slumber, there seemed to be a sort of dewy freshness
about them, and about her slightly pink cheeks, which, at that
time, he had no idea were at all perilous to him. All he was conscious
of was a sensation of pleasure in looking at her, and a slight
surprise in the revelation of elements in her which, he began
to decide, constituted real beauty.</p>

<p>"That's a quaint expression&mdash;'blue-bird weather,'" he said. "It's
a perfect description of a spring-like day in winter. Is it a
local expression?"</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I think so. There's a song about it, along the coast"&mdash;she
laughed uncertainly&mdash;"a rather foolish song."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"If I remember"&mdash;she hesitated, thinking for a moment, then,
with a laugh which he thought a little bashful&mdash;"it's really too
silly to repeat!"</p>

<p>"Please sing it!"</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;if you wish."</p>

<p>And in a low, pretty, half-laughing voice, she sang:</p>

<p>  "Quiet sea and quiet sky,   Idle sail and anchored boat,  
Just a snowflake gull afloat,   Drifting like a feather-  And
the gray hawk crying,   And a man's heart sighing-  That is blue-bird
weather:-  And the high hawk crying,   And a maid's heart sighing  
Till lass and lover come together,-  This is blue-bird weather."</p>

<p>She turned her head and looked steadily out across the waste
of water. "I told you it was silly," she said, very calmly.</p>
