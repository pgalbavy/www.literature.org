<p>"It must have rained here since we left," observed Toady, as
they drew near the town.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Irene curiously.</p>

<p>"'Cause there's a puddle of water in that hollow rock and unless
it had rained, how would it get there?"</p>

<p>"By Jove, the lad is right," muttered Decker Simmons to himself.
"Queer we didn't get any at the canyon, though.  Wonder what's
the trouble ahead.  Town seems excited.  Do you suppose the new
postmaster has embezzled his funds already?"</p>

<p>"Uncle Decker," Tabitha's voice interrupted his meditations.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Something must have happened in town while we were gone."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Main street is full of people and the bank platform is black
with them.  Do you suppose there is another run on the bank, or
can it have failed?"</p>

<p>"Why, so 'tis!" ejaculated the man, noting for the first time
what Tabitha's keen eyes had seen,&mdash;that the greater crowd of
the people were gathered in front of the Silver Bow Bank.  "Wonder
what's up."</p>

<p>"Hello, Simmons," called Dawley, the grocer, from his position
in the doorway of his store.  "You don't look as if you'd heard
the news."</p>

<p>"No.  Let's have it."  The whole party halted and waited curiously.</p>

<p>"Bank robbed."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!  When?"</p>

<p>"Saturday night."</p>

<p>"Get much?"</p>

<p>"Don't know yet, but reckon 'twas only a few hundred.  Brinkley
lost a lot of provisions, too, but fortunately his safe was empty."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!  Any clue?"</p>

<p>"Not so far.  Rain wiped out all tracks that might have been
made.  Had a corker of a thunderstorm that night."</p>

<p>"Well, well!  Now what do you think of that!  What steps are
you taking toward the capture of the thieves?"</p>

<p>"Posse out scouring the desert."</p>

<p>"Humph!"</p>

<p>"Well, what else can we do without clues?"</p>

<p>"<em>Find</em> some clues.  You'll never catch the rascals by
scouring the desert with a handful of men.  They must have gone
into camp close by, or they would never have stocked up.  Bet
they are new at the business. <em>Must</em> be to make a mistake
like that.  I'd laugh if they had never left town."  And gathering
up the reins, he drove on, followed by the cavalcade of burros.</p>

<p>The children were greatly excited.  Burglaries in that lonely
little desert town were unheard of, and this novel experience
furnished food for their lively imaginations to feed upon.  Tabitha
was particularly impressed, for never before in her short life
had a robbery occurred so near home, and she could think of little
else.  A reward of two hundred dollars had been offered for the
capture of the thieves, and as soon as the little brood in the
Eagles' Nest heard of this, they began to amuse themselves by
telling how they would spend the money if by chance they could
win the reward.</p>

<p>"I'd buy me a pony," said Toady, as they sat on the shady side
of the house discussing the all-absorbing topic.  "Ma said she
never should get us another after Spotty kicked her when she struck
it with the whip."</p>

<p>"I'd save it towards a motorcycle," declared Billiard boastfully. 
"No ponies for mine!  With another hundred I could get a dandy
machine, and then wouldn't you see me spinning about the country
just as I pleased!"</p>

<p>"It would almost pay for another term at Ivy Hall," sighed Mercedes,
who, though she never mentioned the matter, knew that the family
purse was too flat to permit of her returning to her beloved school
with the coming of September.</p>

<p>"I'd buy a little house in Los Angeles and go there to live,"
said Irene.  "It must be pretty where there are real trees and
flowers the year around."</p>

<p>"It's not your turn," Susie objected.  "I'd buy &mdash;I'd buy&mdash;what
<em>would</em> I buy?  There are so many things I want, but I
b'lieve I'd go travelling.  Two hundred dollars would take me
quite a piece, and I'd see lots of big cities."</p>

<p>"And I'd go along," breathed Inez in ecstasy, "and we'd beat
our way back on freight cars."</p>

<p>"Ho!  That wouldn't be any fun," scoffed Rosslyn.  "I'd buy candy,
'n' ice-cream, 'n' peanuts, 'n' popcorn."</p>

<p>"And a doctor," laughed Mercedes.</p>

<p>There was a pause, and seven pair of eyes turned expectantly
toward Gloriana, who, perceiving the look, said shyly, "There
are probably heaps of things I'd like to get for myself now and
then, but I think the most of my two hundred would go to Granny
Conover for taking care of me all those years.  I'd like to see
her have plenty of money to do as she pleased with before she
dies."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't that be splendid?" cried the children, who were never
tired of hearing the pitiful tale of Gloriana's life.</p>

<p>"Now,  Tabitha,"  suggested Billiard.  "Why, where <em>is</em>
Tabitha?"</p>

<p>"Gone to put Janie to bed, I guess," said Toady, seeing that
the youngest member of the family was also missing.  "It's her
nap time."</p>

<p>But in reality, Tabitha was far down the mountainside, speeding
like a deer in pursuit of a tiny, white-clad figure toddling in
and out among the sagebrush and greasewood toward a forbidden
playground, where, half-hidden by rocks and rubbish, were several
unprotected prospect holes, mysterious and alluring to the investigative
baby eyes.  Even as Tabitha came within calling distance of the
child, Janie discovered that she was being pursued, and quickened
her steps into a run, heedless of the path she was taking, until
with a shrill cry of fright, she slipped over the brink of one
of the very holes she had stolen away to visit, and disappeared
from sight.</p>

<p>"O, God, don't let her be killed!" prayed the black-eyed girl,
and her feet fairly flew over the uneven ground, till she, too,
reached the edge of the deep excavation.  But before she could
discover the plight of the runaway, she felt the ground give way
beneath her feet, and echoing Janie's cry of alarm, she, too,
shot out of sight. Fortunately, however, little sand fell with
her, and as by a miracle, she landed free and clear of the frightened,
sobbing, but unhurt figure crouching in the opposite corner.</p>

<p>Scrambling to her feet, she seized the scared baby in her arms,
exclaiming over and over again, "Janie, Janie, are you sure you
aren't killed?" till at length she had soothed the child's fright
and had coaxed her into laughing again.  "Now, Miss Mischief,"
she cried, setting the baby down and beginning to investigate
their prison, "we must find some way out of this place.  'Tisn't
very deep, to be sure; but the sides seem pretty crumbly, so I
don't dare to climb out.  I reckon we'll have to shout.  Help,
help, help!"</p>

<p>They screamed themselves hoarse, but no one came to answer their
call, and Janie began to wail dismally, for the minutes seemed
like hours to her, and she was tired and cross.  "Never mind,
honey," Tabitha comforted.  "If they don't find us around the
house by supper time, they will know something has gone wrong
and send General to find us. Now let's amuse ourselves for a while,
and then we'll shout again. Here is a stick.  See if you can dig
a deeper hole than I can.  Why, what's this?"</p>

<p>Stooping over to pick up a fragment of redwood bark at her feet,
she uncovered a small bag, which rattled as she touched it; and
as she untied the drawstring, a shower of glittering gold pieces
fell into her lap.</p>

<p>"Pennies!" cried Janie, making a dive for a share of the shining
coins.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, gold pennies, but Janie mustn't touch," answered
Tabitha, busily sorting the money into various piles according
to its denomination.  "It doesn't belong to us, and we must take
it to the-Say, Janie McKittrick, what will you bet this isn't
the money stolen from the bank Saturday night?  Mr. Dawley said
they got only a few hundred.  Let's count it.  One, two, three,
four, five hundred dollars. Janie, that's just what we've found! 
The robbers didn't dare take it with them, and so hid it here,
thinking it would be absolutely safe."</p>

<p>"Well, Tabitha Catt!  Of all things!  Look, girls, she's as calm
and cool as if she had gone on a picnic, instead of tumbling into
a prospect hole."</p>

<p>So intent had the two prisoners become in their find that neither
had heard the sound of approaching footsteps, and as breathless
Susie's voice rang out above their heads, both started guiltily.</p>

<p>"Why, how did you know where to look for us?" cried Tabitha,
bouncing to her feet, and slipping the bag out of sight, lest
the children see and ask questions.</p>

<p>"Well, when we couldn't find you about the house anywhere, Glory
remembered that Janie had slipped off down the trail while we
were talking, and so we decided that you must have chased her. 
Then Mercy happened to think of these holes.  Janie is always
possessed to play down here, and has run away three times before;
so we came down to look, and here you are in the very first one,"
explained Susie.</p>

<p>"You hauled us out of the abandoned mine one day, and now we
are going to fish you out of a prospect hole," exulted Billiard,
much relieved to find the two girls unhurt, but unable to resist
crowing a little over their mishap.</p>

<p>"How?" asked Tabitha, a frown of anxiety gathering in her forehead.
"Don't get too near the edge there, or some of you may join us
in our retreat.  You must go for help.  You can't get us out all
alone."</p>

<p>"Mercy has gone for the assayer," began Inez.</p>

<p>"And here he is now," Billiard interrupted.  "He has got a long
board and a rope.  Stand back, Irene, so you won't be in the way. 
There, now, Tabby, tie up the baby, and we'll lift her out first."</p>

<p>In a surprisingly short time, both girls were hoisted from the
sultry pit and landed laughing gaily among their mates.</p>

<p>"Well," said the assayer, shaking his gray head in a puzzled
fashion, "I don't understand how you kids work the stunt."</p>

<p>"What stunt?" they all inquired.</p>

<p>"Why, tumbling into every hole you come across and not getting
hurt. You aren't hurt, are you?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed!"</p>

<p>"And Kitty finded a whole sack full of gold pennies down there,
but her won't div Janie any," volunteered the baby quite unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"She&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Gold pennies!"</p>

<p>"What does she mean?"</p>

<p>The children lifted questioning eyes to Tabitha's crimson face,
and even the assayer looked down at her curiously.  She had not
meant to let the children know about the money; at least, not
until she had consulted older and wiser heads than theirs; but
now that Janie had betrayed her secret, she displayed her find,
and explained how it had come into her possession.</p>

<p>The assayer's eyes grew thoughtful, as he examined each coin
minutely, and counted the treasure, to make sure that Tabitha's
figures were right.  "What shall you do with it?" he finally asked,
as he dropped the last piece into the sack and returned it to
Tabitha.</p>

<p>"Take it to the bank.  I thought it might be part of the money
the robbers got."</p>

<p>He glanced at her quickly, keenly; then answered, "That's the
thing to do, all right, and I don't believe your surmise is far
off, either. But see here, children, don't you dare lisp a word
to a single soul about this money until we know for certain whose
it is."</p>

<p>"We won't," hastily promised the wondering, round-eyed flock,
for they stood much in awe of the silent, almost taciturn man
who worked wonders with the rock which the miners brought him;
and the little company set out for home, leaving Tabitha and the
assayer to carry the precious find over to the bank.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Gloriana, as the black-eyed girl finished
relating the afternoon's happenings to her, "I half believe that
man snooping around the pesthouse is the robber."</p>

<p>"What man?" demanded the startled Tabitha.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know who he is, but it is someone I've never seen
here in town.  He was there this morning, but I didn't think much
about it then.  We were so excited over the robbery.  But this
afternoon while the assayer was dragging you out of the prospect
hole, and I was watching through your field glasses, I happened
to turn them in the direction of the pesthouse, and there he was
again, humped up on the doorsill, watching through glasses of
his own.  When you started off toward town, he hustled into the
house and shut the door.  Now, it seems to me no one would stay
in a <em>pesthouse</em> unless he was hiding from someone."</p>

<p>"No one ever had smallpox there."</p>

<p>"Then why does everyone avoid it so?"</p>

<p>"I don't know.  The name, I reckon.  It was built for a pesthouse,
but the doctors decided the patient didn't have smallpox after
all, so the building has never been used."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps he knows there is nothing to be afraid of in the
house."</p>

<p>"That may be, of course.  Is he there yet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think he is.  I've kept a close lookout ever since I
discovered him, and I haven't seen him leave."</p>

<p>Tabitha seemed lost in thought a moment, then turned an eager
face toward her companion.  "Gloriana, the reward!"</p>

<p>"Could we?"</p>

<p>"Can't tell till we try!"</p>

<p>"But how<hr>"</p>

<p>"There are only two small windows in the house,&mdash;funny, isn't
it, when air is so necessary in case of sickness,&mdash;he can't get
out of them.  So all we have to do is guard the door."</p>

<p>"But how shall we get him to the&mdash;police?"</p>

<p>"Sheriff?  I hadn't thought of that part.  We couldn't tie him
up and march him to jail,&mdash;we aren't strong enough, just us girls. 
We'll have to make sure he is there, lock him in, and then while
one of us guards the door, the other must go for help."</p>

<p>Gloriana shuddered.  She hoped it would not fall to her lot to
guard the door, and yet she could not bear to think of Tabitha's
staying there alone with only a flimsy structure between her and
a desperate character.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>we&mdash;had we better try it alone?" she asked timidly. 
"Wouldn't it be wiser to tell the assayer and get him to help?"</p>

<p>"The more people there are connected with his capture, the smaller
our share of the reward will be.  We can do it all right."</p>

<p>Tabitha's daring swept away her objections.  "That's so," she
answered. "Well, we better not wait any longer then, or perhaps
he will get away yet."</p>

<p>"I'm ready," Tabitha replied promptly, and with quaking hearts
but determined steps the two set out, armed with a stout stick
and the rusty old pistol which Gloriana had used the night the
boys had played burglar.</p>

<p>"What is that broom handle for?" questioned the red-haired girl,
wondering if she would be expected to crack the desperado over
the head with it.</p>

<p>"To lock the door with."</p>

<p>"<em>Lock the door</em>?"  Could Tabitha have gone suddenly crazy?</p>

<p>"Yes.  It's the only way we can fasten him in.  The door has
an iron handle on the outside, instead of a knob, you see."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Is that the man?"  The door of the pesthouse had opened abruptly
and a short, portly man roughly dressed, unshaved and florid of
complexion, appeared on the threshold a moment, eyed the approaching
girls indifferently, glanced searchingly toward town, and again
vanished within, closing the door behind him.  Gloriana's heart
seemed to stop beating, then pounded so loudly that it sounded
to her like the pulsing of the engines in the Silver Legion Mine. 
"Yes," she gasped.</p>

<p>"Then we've got him!"  Scared but exultant, Tabitha leaped to
the door, thrust her stick through the handle, and cocked her
revolver, just as the man, hearing the noise outside, grasped
the knob and tried to open the door.</p>

<p>"What the deuce!" they heard him exclaim, and then he wrenched
again. "Who's out there, and what do you want?" he bellowed in
rage, when the door refused to budge.</p>

<p>"You're our prisoner," Tabitha answered boldly, though trembling
like a leaf with nervous dread; "and you might just as well keep
quiet as to make a fuss.  Glory, hurry for the sheriff, the assayer&mdash;anyone! 
He's desperate!"</p>

<p>And indeed he sounded desperate as he kicked and banged the door,
shouted and swore, tearing about his small prison like a madman,
and breathing threats of vengeance against his jailer, who stood
pale but undaunted in front of the door, with a cocked revolver
clinched tightly in both hands, waiting anxiously for the return
of Gloriana with help from town, and thanking her lucky stars
that neither of the small windows was on the door side of the
house.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the tumult ceased within, and terrified Tabitha
began to take courage again.  "He has decided to behave himself
at last," she thought.  "It's the only sensible thing to do, for
he can't get away from here now without being caught.  There comes
Glory at last, but oh, gracious! look at the crowd following her. 
Half the town is out."</p>

<p>Just then a subdued grunt from around the corner of the house
caught her attention, and beckoning wildly to the approaching
throng, she crept cautiously forward to investigate, but paused
again, paralyzed at the sight which met her eyes.  The portly
prisoner had attempted to escape by means of one of the small
windows, and now hung suspended by the middle over the sill, his
hands clawing the air helplessly inside, and his heels waving
frantically without.  At another time, Tabitha, would have shouted
with laughter at the ridiculous figure he cut, but now her only
thought was to prevent his escaping, and flinging aside her pistol,
she plunged toward the body seesawing through the air, and clutched
the feet with a determined grip, while the helpless victim protested
in emphatic language.</p>

<p>Thus the crowd found them and went wild with delight at the spectacle,
much to the discomfiture of both captor and captive, and when
at length the florid prisoner was freed from his uncomfortable
position, his face was purple with rage and exertion.  "What is
the meaning of this outrage?" he exploded as soon as he could
find sufficient breath to voice his indignation.  "Who put you
up to such a trick as that, you young minx?  Do you know who I
am?"</p>

<p>"Why, Jerry Weller!" exclaimed an astonished voice from the interested
throng of onlookers.  "What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I bought this old shack and was to have had it moved onto my
claims to-day, if the movers had showed up," exclaimed the irate
man, his voice thick with anger.  "But along come these jades
and fasten me in<hr>"</p>

<p>"We thought he was the bank robber," Tabitha murmured faintly,
sick at heart over the mistake.  "He was acting so&mdash;so suspiciously."</p>

<p>"Bank robber!" echoed the speaker from the crowd.  "Why, Jeremiah
Weller is owner of the biggest placer mines in the country.  He
made a fortune in Alaska.  He's a millionaire!  Bank robber! 
Ha&mdash;ha!  That's rich!"</p>

<p>The crowd roared appreciatively, but the victim of the mistake
quite unexpectedly lost his glowering look, and gruffly declared,
"Well, you needn't laugh at her.  She's pluck to the backbone. 
Show me another girl who would have undertook to corral a bank
robber as she did.  I don't wonder she thought that was my occupation. 
I certainly look rough enough&mdash;"  Suddenly his roving eyes fell
upon the timid, shrinking Gloriana, so depressed at the way matters
had turned out that she could scarcely keep back the scalding
tears.  If it had not been for her, Tabitha would never have gone
on such a wild-goose chase.  Why hadn't she kept her suspicions
to herself?</p>

<p>"What's your name?" demanded the stranger so abruptly that he
seemed positively rude.</p>

<p>"Gloriana Holliday," she managed to articulate.</p>

<p>"Did you ever have an Uncle Jerry?"</p>

<p>"If I did, he never came near us that I can remember," she candidly
replied.</p>

<p>The purple of his face deepened.  "That's right, too," he muttered.
"But your mother ran away to get married."</p>

<p>"And her folks told her never to let them see her face again,"
supplemented Gloriana bitterly.</p>

<p>"Was her name Weller at one time?  But of course it was.  There
couldn't be two people on earth look as much alike as she and
you unless they were mother and daughter; and besides, she married
a Holliday, &mdash;Jack Holliday."</p>

<p>Gloriana nodded.</p>

<p>"Then, my girl, I'm your Uncle Jerry, and if you didn't catch
your bank robber, you made a pretty good haul anyway.  Your mother&mdash;she&mdash;she's&mdash;dead,
isn't she?  And your father?  You're an orphan<hr>"</p>

<p>"She's not any longer!" Tabitha broke in savagely.  "We've adopted
her and she's my sister."</p>

<p>"Oh!  Well, that simplifies matters, too, for I'm a bachelor
and have no <em>home</em> to offer, but&mdash;  Say, I want to talk
with you.  Where's your adopted father?  Not in town now?  Well,
isn't there some place we can go where we won't be gawked at by
all these hoodlums?  Bring your black-haired sister,&mdash;my jailer. 
I certainly do admire pluck."</p>

<p>At this broad hint, the curious crowd reluctantly withdrew, and
left the trio alone at the pesthouse threshold.  Standing there
bare-headed with the waning sunlight glinting through the heavy,
red locks, Gloriana told what she could remember of the pitiful
struggle of her parents, their deaths, and her unhappy lot until
the scholarship at Ivy Hall had opened the way to better things.</p>

<p>So affected was the bluff stranger by the sad tale that he made
no effort to check the tears which filled his eyes and rolled
down his cheeks.  "Well, the past is passed," he said when the
story was done, "and we can't do anything now to change it.  I've
been downright sorry at the way we treated your mother, but she
effaced herself pretty well. We never got a trace of her whereabouts,
though years afterwards we heard that she was dead.  We never
knew there was a child, but never mind, you shall not want again
as long as I live.  Being a rover and unmarried, I have no home
to offer, as I said before; so I am glad to find you settled with
such good friends.  But I've got all kinds of money, and insist
upon paying for your education from now on.  Here's a check for
pin money."</p>

<p>Drawing a check-book from his pocket, he rapidly scribbled a
few lines, tore out the slip and handed it to Gloriana.  Mechanically
she took it, and her gray eyes grew round with wonder as she read. 
"One hundred dollars!  Oh, you must have made a mistake, Mr.<hr>"</p>

<p>"Uncle Jerry," he corrected her.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jerry," she dutifully repeated.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it!  And what's more, there will be one of those
ready for you every quarter."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's too much!" she protested.  "Whatever would a girl
do with four hundred dollars a year spending money?"  The sum
appalled her, and well it might, for never before had she possessed
more than five dollars at one time.</p>

<p>He laughed at her dismay.  "Why, I often spend that much in a
day.  You can lay in a stock of jimcracks like the other girls
have.  You'll find plenty of ways to dispose of every cent, I
know."</p>

<p>"Maybe," she half whispered.  "You see, I never had so much as
a dollar all my own that I can remember until I came to live with
Tabitha, but perhaps when I get used to knowing it's really mine
and&mdash;genuine, I'll find ways to spend it.  I &mdash;I thank you. 
It's nice to have an Uncle Jerry."</p>

<p>"It's nice to have a Niece Gloriana, too," he answered gruffly,
clearing his throat with much gusto; and as there seemed to be
nothing further to say, the trio turned from the lonely pesthouse,
and silently climbed the hill toward town.</p>
