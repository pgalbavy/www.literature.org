<P>From that moment Boxtel's interest in tulips was no longer a 
stimulus to his exertions, but a deadening anxiety. 
Henceforth all his thoughts ran only upon the injury which 
his neighbour would cause him, and thus his favourite 
occupation was changed into a constant source of misery to him.</P>
<P>Van Baerle, as may easily be imagined, had no sooner begun 
to apply his natural ingenuity to his new fancy, than he 
succeeded in growing the finest tulips. Indeed; he knew 
better than any one else at Haarlem or Leyden  -  the two 
towns which boast the best soil and the most congenial 
climate  -  how to vary the colours, to modify the shape, and 
to produce new species.</P>
<P>He belonged to that natural, humorous school who took for 
their motto in the seventeenth century the aphorism uttered 
by one of their number in 1653,  -  &quot;To despise flowers is to 
offend God.&quot;</P>
<P>From that premise the school of tulip-fanciers, the most 
exclusive of all schools, worked out the following syllogism 
in the same year:  - </P>
<P>&quot;To despise flowers is to offend God.</P>
<P>&quot;The more beautiful the flower is, the more does one offend 
God in despising it.</P>
<P>&quot;The tulip is the most beautiful of all flowers.</P>
<P>&quot;Therefore, he who despises the tulip offends God beyond 
measure.&quot;</P>
<P>By reasoning of this kind, it can be seen that the four or 
five thousand tulip-growers of Holland, France, and 
Portugal, leaving out those of Ceylon and China and the 
Indies, might, if so disposed, put the whole world under the 
ban, and condemn as schismatics and heretics and deserving 
of death the several hundred millions of mankind whose hopes 
of salvation were not centred upon the tulip.</P>
<P>We cannot doubt that in such a cause Boxtel, though he was 
Van Baerle's deadly foe, would have marched under the same 
banner with him.</P>
<P>Mynheer van Baerle and his tulips, therefore, were in the 
mouth of everybody; so much so, that Boxtel's name 
disappeared for ever from the list of the notable 
tulip-growers in Holland, and those of Dort were now 
represented by Cornelius van Baerle, the modest and 
inoffensive savant.</P>
<P>Engaging, heart and soul, in his pursuits of sowing, 
planting, and gathering, Van Baerle, caressed by the whole 
fraternity of tulip-growers in Europe, entertained nor the 
least suspicion that there was at his very door a pretender 
whose throne he had usurped.</P>
<P>He went on in his career, and consequently in his triumphs; 
and in the course of two years he covered his borders with 
such marvellous productions as no mortal man, following in 
the tracks of the Creator, except perhaps Shakespeare and 
Rubens, have equalled in point of numbers.</P>
<P>And also, if Dante had wished for a new type to be added to 
his characters of the Inferno, he might have chosen Boxtel 
during the period of Van Baerle's successes. Whilst 
Cornelius was weeding, manuring, watering his beds, whilst, 
kneeling on the turf border, he analysed every vein of the 
flowering tulips, and meditated on the modifications which 
might be effected by crosses of colour or otherwise, Boxtel, 
concealed behind a small sycamore which he had trained at 
the top of the partition wall in the shape of a fan, 
watched, with his eyes starting from their sockets and with 
foaming mouth, every step and every gesture of his 
neighbour; and whenever he thought he saw him look happy, or 
descried a smile on his lips, or a flash of contentment 
glistening in his eyes, he poured out towards him such a 
volley of maledictions and furious threats as to make it 
indeed a matter of wonder that this venomous breath of envy 
and hatred did not carry a blight on the innocent flowers 
which had excited it.</P>
<P>When the evil spirit has once taken hold of the heart of 
man, it urges him on, without letting him stop. Thus Boxtel 
soon was no longer content with seeing Van Baerle. He wanted 
to see his flowers, too; he had the feelings of an artist, 
the master-piece of a rival engrossed his interest.</P>
<P>He therefore bought a telescope, which enabled him to watch 
as accurately as did the owner himself every progressive 
development of the flower, from the moment when, in the 
first year, its pale seed-leaf begins to peep from the 
ground, to that glorious one, when, after five years, its 
petals at last reveal the hidden treasures of its chalice. 
How often had the miserable, jealous man to observe in Van 
Baerle's beds tulips which dazzled him by their beauty, and 
almost choked him by their perfection!</P>
<P>And then, after the first blush of the admiration which he 
could not help feeling, he began to be tortured by the pangs 
of envy, by that slow fever which creeps over the heart and 
changes it into a nest of vipers, each devouring the other 
and ever born anew. How often did Boxtel, in the midst of 
tortures which no pen is able fully to describe,  -  how 
often did he feel an inclination to jump down into the 
garden during the night, to destroy the plants, to tear the 
bulbs with his teeth, and to sacrifice to his wrath the 
owner himself, if he should venture to stand up for the 
defence of his tulips!</P>
<P>But to kill a tulip was a horrible crime in the eyes of a 
genuine tulip-fancier; as to killing a man, it would not 
have mattered so very much.</P>
<P>Yet Van Baerle made such progress in the noble science of 
growing tulips, which he seemed to master with the true 
instinct of genius, that Boxtel at last was maddened to such 
a degree as to think of throwing stones and sticks into the 
flower-stands of his neighbour. But, remembering that he 
would be sure to be found out, and that he would not only be 
punished by law, but also dishonoured for ever in the face 
of all the tulip-growers of Europe, he had recourse to 
stratagem, and, to gratify his hatred, tried to devise a 
plan by means of which he might gain his ends without being 
compromised himself.</P>
<P>He considered a long time, and at last his meditations were 
crowned with success.</P>
<P>One evening he tied two cats together by their hind legs 
with a string about six feet in length, and threw them from 
the wall into the midst of that noble, that princely, that 
royal bed, which contained not only the &quot;Cornelius de Witt,&quot; 
but also the &quot;Beauty of Brabant,&quot; milk-white, edged with 
purple and pink, the &quot;Marble of Rotterdam,&quot; colour of flax, 
blossoms feathered red and flesh colour, the &quot;Wonder of 
Haarlem,&quot; the &quot;Colombin obscur,&quot; and the &quot;Columbin clair 
terni.&quot;</P>
<P>The frightened cats, having alighted on the ground, first 
tried to fly each in a different direction, until the string 
by which they were tied together was tightly stretched 
across the bed; then, however, feeling that they were not 
able to get off, they began to pull to and fro, and to wheel 
about with hideous caterwaulings, mowing down with their 
string the flowers among which they were struggling, until, 
after a furious strife of about a quarter of an hour, the 
string broke and the combatants vanished.</P>
<P>Boxtel, hidden behind his sycamore, could not see anything, 
as it was pitch-dark; but the piercing cries of the cats 
told the whole tale, and his heart overflowing with gall now 
throbbed with triumphant joy.</P>
<P>Boxtel was so eager to ascertain the extent of the injury, 
that he remained at his post until morning to feast his eyes 
on the sad state in which the two cats had left the 
flower-beds of his neighbour. The mists of the morning 
chilled his frame, but he did not feel the cold, the hope of 
revenge keeping his blood at fever heat. The chagrin of his 
rival was to pay for all the inconvenience which he incurred 
himself.</P>
<P>At the earliest dawn the door of the white house opened, and 
Van Baerle made his appearance, approaching the flower-beds 
with the smile of a man who has passed the night comfortably 
in his bed, and has had happy dreams.</P>
<P>All at once he perceived furrows and little mounds of earth 
on the beds which only the evening before had been as smooth 
as a mirror, all at once he perceived the symmetrical rows 
of his tulips to be completely disordered, like the pikes of 
a battalion in the midst of which a shell has fallen.</P>
<P>He ran up to them with blanched cheek.</P>
<P>Boxtel trembled with joy. Fifteen or twenty tulips, torn and 
crushed, were lying about, some of them bent, others 
completely broken and already withering, the sap oozing from 
their bleeding bulbs: how gladly would Van Baerle have 
redeemed that precious sap with his own blood!</P>
<P>But what were his surprise and his delight! what was the 
disappointment of his rival! Not one of the four tulips 
which the latter had meant to destroy was injured at all. 
They raised proudly their noble heads above the corpses of 
their slain companions. This was enough to console Van 
Baerle, and enough to fan the rage of the horticultural 
murderer, who tore his hair at the sight of the effects of 
the crime which he had committed in vain.</P>
<P>Van Baerle could not imagine the cause of the mishap, which, 
fortunately, was of far less consequence than it might have 
been. On making inquiries, he learned that the whole night 
had been disturbed by terrible caterwaulings. He besides 
found traces of the cats, their footmarks and hairs left 
behind on the battle-field; to guard, therefore, in future 
against a similar outrage, he gave orders that henceforth 
one of the under gardeners should sleep in the garden in a 
sentry-box near the flower-beds.</P>
<P>Boxtel heard him give the order, and saw the sentry-box put 
up that very day; but he deemed himself lucky in not having 
been suspected, and, being more than ever incensed against 
the successful horticulturist, he resolved to bide his time.</P>
<P>Just then the Tulip Society of Haarlem offered a prize for 
the discovery (we dare not say the manufacture) of a large 
black tulip without a spot of colour, a thing which had not 
yet been accomplished, and was considered impossible, as at 
that time there did not exist a flower of that species 
approaching even to a dark nut brown. It was, therefore, 
generally said that the founders of the prize might just as 
well have offered two millions as a hundred thousand 
guilders, since no one would be able to gain it.</P>
<P>The tulip-growing world, however, was thrown by it into a 
state of most active commotion. Some fanciers caught at the 
idea without believing it practicable, but such is the power 
of imagination among florists, that although considering the 
undertaking as certain to fail, all their thoughts were 
engrossed by that great black tulip, which was looked upon 
to be as chimerical as the black swan of Horace or the white 
raven of French tradition.</P>
<P>Van Baerle was one of the tulip-growers who were struck with 
the idea; Boxtel thought of it in the light of a 
speculation. Van Baerle, as soon as the idea had once taken 
root in his clear and ingenious mind, began slowly the 
necessary planting and cross-breeding to reduce the tulips 
which he had grown already from red to brown, and from brown 
to dark brown.</P>
<P>By the next year he had obtained flowers of a perfect 
nut-brown, and Boxtel espied them in the border, whereas he 
had himself as yet only succeeded in producing the light 
brown.</P>
<P>It might perhaps be interesting to explain to the gentle 
reader the beautiful chain of theories which go to prove 
that the tulip borrows its colors from the elements; perhaps 
we should give him pleasure if we were to maintain and 
establish that nothing is impossible for a florist who 
avails himself with judgment and discretion and patience of 
the sun's heat; the clear water, the juices of the earth, 
and the cool breezes. But this is not a treatise upon tulips 
in general; it is the story of one particular tulip which we 
have undertaken to write, and to that we limit ourselves, 
however alluring the subject which is so closely allied to 
ours.</P>
<P>Boxtel, once more worsted by the superiority of his hated 
rival, was now completely disgusted with tulip-growing, and, 
being driven half mad, devoted himself entirely to 
observation.</P>
<P>The house of his rival was quite open to view; a garden 
exposed to the sun; cabinets with glass walls, shelves, 
cupboards, boxes, and ticketed pigeon-holes, which could 
easily be surveyed by the telescope. Boxtel allowed his 
bulbs to rot in the pits, his seedlings to dry up in their 
cases, and his tulips to wither in the borders and 
henceforward occupied himself with nothing else but the 
doings at Van Baerle's. He breathed through the stalks of 
Van Baerle's tulips, quenched his thirst with the water he 
sprinkled upon them, and feasted on the fine soft earth 
which his neighbour scattered upon his cherished bulbs.</P>
<P>But the most curious part of the operations was not 
performed in the garden.</P>
<P>It might be one o'clock in the morning when Van Baerle went 
up to his laboratory, into the glazed cabinet whither 
Boxtel's telescope had such an easy access; and here, as 
soon as the lamp illuminated the walls and windows, Boxtel 
saw the inventive genius of his rival at work.</P>
<P>He beheld him sifting his seeds, and soaking them in liquids 
which were destined to modify or to deepen their colours. He 
knew what Cornelius meant when heating certain grains, then 
moistening them, then combining them with others by a sort 
of grafting,  -  a minute and marvellously delicate 
manipulation,  -  and when he shut up in darkness those which 
were expected to furnish the black colour, exposed to the 
sun or to the lamp those which were to produce red, and 
placed between the endless reflections of two water-mirrors 
those intended for white, the pure representation of the 
limpid element.</P>
<P>This innocent magic, the fruit at the same time of 
child-like musings and of manly genius  -  this patient 
untiring labour, of which Boxtel knew himself to be 
incapable  -  made him, gnawed as he was with envy, centre 
all his life, all his thoughts, and all his hopes in his 
telescope.</P>
<P>For, strange to say, the love and interest of horticulture 
had not deadened in Isaac his fierce envy and thirst of 
revenge. Sometimes, whilst covering Van Baerle with his 
telescope, he deluded himself into a belief that he was 
levelling a never-failing musket at him; and then he would 
seek with his finger for the trigger to fire the shot which 
was to have killed his neighbour. But it is time that we 
should connect with this epoch of the operations of the one, 
and the espionage of the other, the visit which Cornelius de 
Witt came to pay to his native town. </P></article>
