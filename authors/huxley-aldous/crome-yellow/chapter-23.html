<p>Gombauld was by no means so furious at their apparition as Denis
had hoped and expected he would be. Indeed, he was rather pleased
than annoyed when the two faces, one brown and pointed, the other
round and pale, appeared in the frame of the open door. The energy
born of his restless irritation was dying within him, returning
to its emotional elements. A moment more and he would have been
losing his temper again&mdash;and Anne would be keeping hers, infuriatingly.
Yes, he was positively glad to see them.</p>

<p>"Come in, come in," he called out hospitably.</p>

<p>Followed by Mr. Scogan, Denis climbed the little ladder and stepped
over the threshold. He looked suspiciously from Gombauld to his
sitter, and could learn nothing from the expression of their faces
except that they both seemed pleased to see the visitors. Were
they really glad, or were they cunningly simulating gladness?
He wondered.</p>

<p>Mr. Scogan, meanwhile, was looking at the portrait.</p>

<p>"Excellent," he said approvingly, "excellent. Almost too true
to character, if that is possible; yes, positively too true. But
I’m surprised to find you putting in all this psychology business."
He pointed to the face, and with his extended finger followed
the slack curves of the painted figure. "I thought you were one
of the fellows who went in exclusively for balanced masses and
impinging planes."</p>

<p>Gombauld laughed. "This is a little infidelity," he said.</p>

<p>"I’m sorry," said Mr. Scogan. "I for one, without ever having
had the slightest appreciation of painting, have always taken
particular pleasure in Cubismus. I like to see pictures from which
nature has been completely banished, pictures which are exclusively
the product of the human mind. They give me the same pleasure
as I derive from a good piece of reasoning or a mathematical problem
or an achievement of engineering. Nature, or anything that reminds
me of nature, disturbs me; it is too large, too complicated, above
all too utterly pointless and incomprehensible. I am at home with
the works of man; if I choose to set my mind to it, I can understand
anything that any man has made or thought. That is why I always
travel by Tube, never by bus if I can possibly help it. For, travelling
by bus, one can’t avoid seeing, even in London, a few stray works
of God&mdash;the sky, for example, an occasional tree, the flowers
in the window-boxes. But travel by Tube and you see nothing but
the works of man&mdash;iron riveted into geometrical forms, straight
lines of concrete, patterned expanses of tiles. All is human and
the product of friendly and comprehensible minds. All philosophies
and all religions&mdash;what are they but spiritual Tubes bored through
the universe! Through these narrow tunnels, where all is recognisably
human, one travels comfortable and secure, contriving to forget
that all round and below and above them stretches the blind mass
of earth, endless and unexplored. Yes, give me the Tube and Cubismus
every time; give me ideas, so snug and neat and simple and well
made. And preserve me from nature, preserve me from all that’s
inhumanly large and complicated and obscure. I haven’t the courage,
and, above all, I haven’t the time to start wandering in that
labyrinth."</p>

<p>While Mr. Scogan was discoursing, Denis had crossed over to the
farther side of the little square chamber, where Anne was sitting,
still in her graceful, lazy pose, on the low chair.</p>

<p>"Well?" he demanded, looking at her almost fiercely. What was
he asking of her? He hardly knew himself.</p>

<p>Anne looked up at him, and for answer echoed his "Well?" in another,
a laughing key.</p>

<p>Denis had nothing more, at the moment, to say. Two or three canvases
stood in the corner behind Anne’s chair, their faces turned to
the wall. He pulled them out and began to look at the paintings.</p>

<p>"May I see too?" Anne requested.</p>

<p>He stood them in a row against the wall. Anne had to turn round
in her chair to look at them. There was the big canvas of the
man fallen from the horse, there was a painting of flowers, there
was a small landscape. His hands on the back of the chair, Denis
leaned over her. From behind the easel at the other side of the
room Mr. Scogan was talking away. For a long time they looked
at the pictures, saying nothing; or, rather, Anne looked at the
pictures, while Denis, for the most part, looked at Anne.</p>

<p>"I like the man and the horse; don’t you?" she said at last,
looking up with an inquiring smile.</p>

<p>Denis nodded, and then in a queer, strangled voice, as though
it had cost him a great effort to utter the words, he said, "I
love you."</p>

<p>It was a remark which Anne had heard a good many times before
and mostly heard with equanimity. But on this occasion&mdash;perhaps
because they had come so unexpectedly, perhaps for some other
reason&mdash;the words provoked in her a certain surprised commotion.</p>

<p>"My poor Denis," she managed to say, with a laugh; but she was
blushing as she spoke.</p>
