<p>It will be recalled that when Jack and Rob awoke, during the
preceding night, they noticed a marked change in the temperature,
and the sailor prophesied an unwelcome change in the weather.
Following the direction pointed by him, his friends saw what he
meant. The rise had caused one of those fogs that have been fatal
so often to ships off the banks of Newfoundland, and which frequently
wrap the southern coast of Greenland in a mist as impenetrable
as that which overshadows at times the British metropolis.</p>

<p>"You see," added Jack, "it might be that some whaler or other
vessel is cruising in these latitudes, and will come close enough
for us to observe 'em and they us, provided the sun was shining,
but, the way matters are turning out, they might pass within a
biscuit's toss 'out either of us knowing it."</p>

<p>"Well," was the philosophical comment of Fred, "we have so much
to be thankful for that I can't complain over a small matter like
that."</p>

<p>"It may be a bigger matter than you think, but I'm as thankful
as you, all the same."</p>

<p>"Gracious!" exclaimed Rob, with a sigh; "I'm hungry."</p>

<p>"There's your supper."</p>

<p>Both boys, however, shook their heads, and Rob replied:</p>

<p>"I'm not hungry enough to eat raw bear's meat."</p>

<p>"It's a thousand times better than starving to death."</p>

<p>As the sailor spoke, he walked to the carcass and withdrew his
knife from the wound.</p>

<p>"You'll come to it bime-by; I've seed the time when I was ready
to chaw up a pair of leather breeches, but that isn't half as
bad as being in an open boat under the equator, with not a drop
of water for three days."</p>

<p>"We can never suffer from that cause so long as this iceberg
holds out. How is it with you, Fred? Are you ready for bear steak?"</p>

<p>"I would be too glad to dine on it, if there was some means of
cooking it, but that is out of the question. I think I'll wait
awhile."</p>

<p>"I'll keep you company," remarked Jack, who felt no such repugnance
against the primitive meal, but was willing to defer the feast
out of regard for them.</p>

<p>The party watched the fog settling over the sea, until, as the
sailor had told them it would do, it shut out all vision beyond
a hundred feet or less.</p>

<p>"I would give a good deal to know one thing," said Fred, after
several minutes' silence, as he seated himself, "and that is just
where we are."</p>

<p>"I can tell you," said Rob.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"On an iceberg in the Greenland Sea."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that, my hearty," put in Jack; "there's
no doubt, of course, that we're on the berg, but I wouldn't bet
that we're drifting through the Greenland Sea."</p>

<p>"Why, the 'Nautilus' was so far north when we left it, and this
iceberg was moving so slowly that we couldn't have gone as far
as all that."</p>

<p>Jack saw that his meaning was not understood.</p>

<p>"What I was getting at is this: Of course, when them bergs slip
off into the ocean, most of them start southward for a more congen'l
clime, but all of 'em don't do it by any means. There is a current
off the western coast of Greenland which runs toward the North
Pole, and we may be in that."</p>

<p>"But this extends so far down that it must strike the other current,
which flows in the opposite direction."</p>

<p>"That may and may not be, and it may be, too, that if it does,
the upper current is the stronger. I've been calling to mind the
bearing of the ship and berg, and I've an idee we're going northward.
Bime-by the berg may change its mind and flop about and start
for New York or South America, but I don't believe it's doing
so now."</p>

<p>This was important information, provided it was true, and there
was good reason to believe that Jack Cosgrove knew far better
than they what he was talking about.</p>

<p>"Then if we keep on we'll strike the North Pole," remarked Rob,
gravely.</p>

<p>"Yes, if we keep on, but we're pretty sure to stop or change
our course before we get beyond Davis Strait or Christianshaab
or Ivignut. Anyway, this old berg will keep at it till she fetches
up in southern waters."</p>

<p>The words of Jack had opened a new and interesting field for
discussion. Its ending had not been thought of by the boys in
their calculations; and, despite their faith in their more experienced
companion, they believed he was mistaken. They had never heard
of anything of the kind he had mentioned, and it did not seem
reasonable that such a vast mass, after heading southward, should
change its direction. Even though it was drifting north when first
seen, it must have started still farther north in order to reach
the latitude where first observed.</p>

<p>By this time all hope of being rescued by the "Nautilus" had
been given up, unless some happy accident should lead it to come
upon the iceberg. The party, therefore, began considering other
means of escape from their unpleasant quarters.</p>

<p>As is well known, there are a number of Danish settlements scattered
along the west coast of Greenland, the bleak, desolate eastern
shore being inhabited only by wandering Esquimaux. It might be
that the berg would sweep along within sight of land, and the
friends would be able to attract the attention of some of the
native fishing boats, or possibly larger craft. It was a remote
hope, indeed, but it was all they saw before them. At any rate,
the polar bear had provided them with the means of postponing
starvation to an indefinite period, for there was enough meat
in his carcass to afford nourishment for many days to come.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether there are more polar bears on this craft?"
remarked Rob, rising to his feet and looking around as if he half
expected to discover another of the monsters making for them.</p>

<p>"Little danger of that," replied Jack, "and it's so mighty seldom
that any of 'em are fools enough to allow themselves to be carried
off like this one did that I never dreamed of anything of the
kind. It does happen now and then, but not often, though you may
read of such things."</p>

<p>"I suppose he would have stayed here until he starved to death,"
was the inquiring remark of Fred.</p>

<p>"He might and he might not; when he had got it through his skull
that there was nothing to eat on the berg he would have plunged
into the sea and started for land, provided it was in sight, and
he would have reached it, too. When he landed he would have been
hungry enough to attack the first saw-mill he came to, and I wouldn't
like to be the first chap he met."</p>

<p>"I don't see how he could have been fiercer than he was."</p>

<p>"He meant business from the first; and, if he had caught sight
of you when you lay asleep in that cavity in the ice he would
have swallowed you before you could wake."</p>

<p>"Well, he didn't do it," replied Fred, with a half-shudder and
laugh, "so what's the good of thinking about it? Rob, it strikes
me," he added, with a quizzical look at the boy, "that raw bear's
meat might not be so bad after all."</p>

<p>"Of course it isn't!" Jack was quick to say, springing to his
feet and stepping forward, knife in hand.</p>

<p>It was evident from the manner in which he conducted the business
that he had done it before. He extracted a goodly-sized piece
from near the shoulder, and dressed it as well as he could with
the only means at command.</p>

<p>Rob had hit upon what might be called a compromise. When one
of the three slices, into which the portion was divided, was handed
to him, he struck match after match from the rubber safe he carried,
and held the tiny flame against different portions of the meat.</p>

<p>Anything like cooking was out of the question, but he succeeded
in scorching it slightly, and giving it a partial appearance of
having seen the fire.</p>

<p>"There!" he exclaimed, in triumph, holding it aloft; "it's done
to a turn, that is the first turn. It's cooked, but it's a little
rare, I'll admit."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Fred imitated him, using almost all the matches he
possessed.</p>
