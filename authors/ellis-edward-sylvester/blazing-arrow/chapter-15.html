<p>Meanwhile Larry Murphy was not idle. He had never received a
more terrifying shock than that caused by the discovery that the
signal which he was confident was made by Wharton Edwards came
from the lips of Blazing Arrow.</p>

<p>On the first thought there was but one explanation of this: his
friend had called to him and had been overheard by the Shawanoe,
who instantly caught it up, well knowing its significance, and
had deceived Wharton by his clever imitation.</p>

<p>This supposition, as the reader knows, was correct; but when
Larry went further, and decided that his comrade had fallen a
victim to the treacherous red man, the reader also knows he made
a mistake.</p>

<p>Firm in the terrible belief for the time, he was so overcome
that he sat down on a bowlder, too faint and weak to stand, until
several minutes had passed.</p>

<p>"This is a bad go, is this same," he mused with a deep sigh.
"If the Indians had to take one, why didn't they take mesilf?
They're likely to do the same&mdash;it's little I care if they do."</p>

<p>So extreme was his dejection, that had he known that a half dozen
Shawanoes were stealing upon him at that moment he would not have
stirred from his position or attempted to defend himself.</p>

<p>This intense depression, however, could not last. All strong,
rugged natures are quick to rebound from such pressure and soon
reassert themselves. By and by he felt a grain of hope. The rifle
lying across his knees was clasped more firmly; he raised his
head and listened; had he discovered the approach of a foe he
would now have defended himself.</p>

<p>"I wish that Blazing Arrow would walk out in front of me and
dare me to tackle him," he muttered, gnashing his teeth. "I wonder
where he is?"</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and peeped around in the gloom. A while before
he had shunned the chief, and counted himself fortunate because
he was able to escape a meeting. Now he would have felt doubly
fortunate could he have gained a chance to attack him.</p>

<p>When the Shawanoe was wanted he was somewhere else.</p>

<p>"I wonder," continued Larry, as hope grew stronger within him,
"whether Whart wasn't sharp enough to play the trick on Blazing
Arrow that he did on mesilf? He must have heard the call, to larn
how to make the same; but Whart may have give him the slip."</p>

<p>It was a faint hope, but it did the lad good. He had hunted so
much in the company of his friend that they had not only acquired
a good deal of woodcraft, but were familiar with each other's
ways.</p>

<p>Larry recalled that he had heard no gun fired since the discharge
of his weapon. It was fair to believe, therefore, that whatever
the fate of young Edwards might be, he had not been shot. There
were other methods of putting him out of the way, but the belief
to which his friend was rapidly bringing himself was that the
one for whom he was concerned was a prisoner of the Shawanoes.</p>

<p>The way to find out was to discover the camp of the red men,
which must be pitched somewhere in the neighborhood. It will thus
be seen that the lads were reasoning along the same lines, to
the same conclusion.</p>

<p>Larry had risen from the bowlder on which he had seated himself,
and decided to move farther back in the woods in search of the
camp-fire that he knew was burning there. In making the search
he would have to go it blind, since there was no means of finding
guidance.</p>

<p>But, as in more than one previous instance, he fortunately discovered
that others were near him before he was observed. He stood motionless,
peering and listening under the trees, where the gloom was so
intense that he might have brushed by a man without either seeing
the other.</p>

<p>They were there, however, and a moment later were seen more plainly
in the moonlight, across which they passed to reach the torrent
whither they were making their way.</p>

<p>Larry was surprised when he saw two Indians walking with their
light, noiseless tread over the rocks. He had supposed there was
but a solitary warrior.</p>

<p>"I'm hoping that one of them is Blazing Arrow," was his thought.</p>

<p>He was resentful to that degree toward this particular Shawanoe
that, despite the danger from his companion, he would have shot
him down; and there can be little question that in doing so he
would have rendered a service to humanity.</p>

<p>But he could not identify either of the red men in the moonlight,
with their faces turned away from him. He saw them walk to the
edge of the torrent, where the tree lay, and then one followed
the other across.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know the meaning of that; they must be hunting for
Whart or mesilf. I'm pretty sure they won't find mesilf there,
and I don't know about Whart. If they haven't got him already,
it may take more than them to find him."</p>

<p>As yet he could not know whether the war party were on this or
the other side of the stream. It looked as if the couple were
returning to camp. If this was so, the youth must follow them
to obtain the information he wanted.</p>

<p>He had reached this conclusion and was about to venture out in
the moonlight, when he was thrilled by the sound of the signal
which he feared he was never to hear again.</p>

<p>He paused and listened, afraid to reply and yet on the point
of doing so.</p>

<p>At the proper interval the call was repeated, and then, so certain
that everything was right was he that, instead of making the proper
answer, he called in a guarded undertone:</p>

<p>"Is that yersilf, Whart?"</p>

<p>"It is," was the reply of the delighted friend, and the next
minute they were together.</p>

<p>It was a joyous reunion, even though the shadow of great danger
rested upon the two youths. Wharton Edwards and Larry Murphy had
been separated, seemingly, with slight prospect of ever seeing
each other again; they had gone through many perils during the
preceding few hours, and at the moment when despair had almost
taken possession of both, they clasped hands and stood side by
side.</p>

<p>"Are ye sure it's yersilf, Whart?" asked the elder, squeezing
the fingers of his friend, who fully reciprocated the warmth of
feeling.</p>

<p>"I'm as sure, Larry, as you are that it's you."</p>

<p>"Then we'll consider it settled; and how are ye?" he asked, shaking
again the hand which he had not yet released.</p>

<p>"I was never better, and thankful and happy to find you alive
when I feared it was all over with you."</p>

<p>"The same to yersilf; and have ye suffered no harrum?"</p>

<p>"None at all, though matters kept moving; I dodged up the trail,
and the only Shawanoe who followed me was Blazing Arrow."</p>

<p>"And did he catch ye?"</p>

<p>"Not that I am aware of. You remember the natural clearing, a
little way out toward the block-house?"</p>

<p>"That I do."</p>

<p>"Well, when I struck that, Blazing Arrow was not far behind me.
He had my gun and I hadn't any, so that all I could do was to
run, and there he and I had the race that we missed at the settlement."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it," eagerly asked Larry.</p>

<p>"There isn't much to tell, except that I did my best, and I suppose
he did the same, Larry; I beat him badly; I must have gained fifty
yards on him."</p>

<p>"And is that the honest truth now, Whart?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"Heaven bless ye!"</p>

<p>And the enthusiastic fellow struck his friend a resounding whack
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Sh!" warned Wharton, "we must talk low, for some of them may
be near us."</p>

<p>"Why didn't ye sind word to me, so that I could have stood by
ye and cheered ye on and watched the sight? Wouldn't it have been
a treat!"</p>

<p>"I would have been proud if you and the rest of our friends could
have been there, for I did better than I thought I could."</p>

<p>The friends told the particulars of what had happened to each
other since their separation. Happy, indeed, were they in their
reunion.</p>

<p>"Whart," said Larry a few minutes later, "I knowed there was
something I'd forgot."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I'm as hungry as I can be."</p>

<p>"So am I, and have been for hours; I wish there was some way
of getting supper, but I know of none. There is something else,
however, that is more important than supper."</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"We must get away from here at once. We ought to have left long
ago."</p>

<p>"I'm thinking ye're right, and I'm ready to do your bidding whenever
you are ready. I came near crossing over that tree a good while
ago, and I'm prepared to do it now if you say so."</p>

<p>"I'm not satisfied that that is the best course."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"From what you have told me and what I have seen, the Shawanoes
seem to be using that to-night as a bridge. I don't know how many
have come and gone over it to-day. Suppose that a party of them
made up their minds to cross at the same time we do?"</p>

<p>"And that's what some of 'em did when I was about to try it;
if me gun hadn't wobbled behind me shoulder we'd have met on the
log."</p>

<p>"The trees grow to the bank at each end of the log, so that if
these two hadn't slanted across that little, narrow space off
there to the left, we wouldn't have seen them until they stepped
upon the foot-bridge. What I mean to say, Larry, is this: we have
had such good fortune that we must not tempt Providence further
by trying to cross here."</p>

<p>"How shall we manage it?"</p>

<p>"Go farther up the stream till we're well away from this place,
where the Indians seem to be so plentiful."</p>

<p>"And maybe there isn't such a spot."</p>

<p>"There must be; there are not enough of the Shawanoes to be everywhere."</p>

<p>"Not that, but a place where we can cross; ye must bear in mind
that it's not me that can jump like yersilf."</p>

<p>"There must be some spot where the banks come close together.
A stream generally grows narrower the nearer you approach the
source."</p>

<p>"True, if it runs between the rocks all the way, as it does above
the falls."</p>

<p>There was logic in these words, and his friend could not deny
it.</p>

<p>"I agree with you, Larry; but if the rocks disappear and the
torrent widens, then it must be so slow that we can either swim
or wade it. There isn't any chance of our reaching the block-house
except by the trail, and that is on the other side."</p>

<p>"But what about the two that wint across a little while ago?"</p>

<p>"We must look out for them, and for the others, too; we are not
through with them yet."</p>

<p>"I agree with ye now."</p>
