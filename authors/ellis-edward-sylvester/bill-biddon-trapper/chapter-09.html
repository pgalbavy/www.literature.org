<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>During my captivity among the Indians, as stated in the last
chapter, there was considerable suffering on account of the scarcity
of food. The country to the north of Nebraska is the paradise
of all species of game in the summer months, but during the winter
the large animals proceed to the southward, and the deep snows
prevent the capture of the smaller ones, except by means of traps.
Spring, therefore, was looked forward to with eager expectation,
as the harbinger of enjoyment and the season of the chase.</p>

<p>And it came at last. First, the sun grew hotter and blazed more
fiercely; the snow became damp and cloggy, and the dripping of
water could be heard through the day and night. Snow-shoe traveling
was now nearly impossible, as long as the thaw continued. Huge
streams of melted snow poured into the rivers all along the banks,
and the ice became weaker and weaker each moment, till, at last,
with a terrific crashing and thundering, the whole mass started,
and, a week after, the clear, blue running water only was seen.
The thaw continued, until at last all the snow had disappeared,
and with feelings of indescribable joy, we once more saw the face
of the earth. Vegetation now commenced with surprising growth,
and, in an almost incredible short space of time, bright, radiant,
glorious spring held indisputed reign. Indians were departing
and arriving every day with loads of fish, wild fowl, and game,
and the village was a scene of unbridled feasting for many a day.</p>

<p>One forenoon, a savage, who had been absent a day or two, announced
that a herd of buffaloes were quietly browsing a few miles to
the southward. This produced violent commotion throughout the
village, and preparations were at once made for the grand hunt.
Some twenty or thirty splendid Indian ponies were mounted by as
many warriors, and, to my inexpressible delight, Jim informed
me that I should accompany them. A small, high-spirited animal
was given me as my charger. He was of a dark color, and his dappled
haunches glistened in the sun like polished ebony.</p>

<p>About noon we sallied forth from the village, and struck a southward
direction, restraining our animals to a walk, in order to preserve
their wind for the severe test at hand. While riding along by
the side of Jim, the thought of escape&mdash;which had not been absent
from me for the last six months&mdash;came with double force. I was
now mounted upon a fleet, long-winded animal, who could hold his
own with any horse bestrode by the Indians, and what was to prevent
my escape? In the bewilderment and excitement of the chase, I
might wander miles away, and be gone many hours, without exciting
suspicion. My captors, I suppose, had no thoughts of my attempting
a flight, as I had permitted so many opportunities to pass, and
I felt there would be no suspicious eyes watching my motions.
The prairie stretched hundreds of miles to the southward, and
it seemed my animal longed to bound away upon it. At any rate,
I felt the time had come, and resolved that I should never return
to the Indian village a captive.</p>

<p>An hour or so after, we came in sight of the drove, cropping
the new grass of the prairie. So numerous were they, that, as
we looked over them, it was impossible to see their extent. Far
away, until they touched the horizon, the ocean of dark, swarming
bodies could be seen.</p>

<p>Our animals now partook of the excitement of their masters. Arching
their necks, they scented the prey afar, and it was nearly impossible
to restrain their impatience. They snorted, and plunged, champed
their bits, and shook their heads, and seemed determined to rush
forward despite all restraint.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Setting up a wild yell, the Indians scattered
and plunged after them."]</p>

<p>We continued stealthily approaching in a body, preserving strict
silence, in order not to alarm the game. In this way, we came
within a hundred yards, when a bull raised his alarmed gaze at
us, and, giving a loud snort, heaved his huge body round, and
plunged madly into the herd. All took the alarm, and went thundering
away, making the earth tremble with their multitudinous tread.</p>

<p>It was now wholly useless to undertake to check our animals longer,
and, setting up a wild yell, the Indians scattered and plunged
after them. The buffalo is not a runner, and, owing to the shortness
of his fore-legs, appears to roll in his gait. The Indians’ horses
soon bring their riders alongside the bisons, and as soon as the
shot is given, they shy off to avoid the infuriated animal’s horns.
Before I was prepared for it, my animal was abreast of a buffalo,
and waiting for my shot. Here I committed a blunder common to
all beginners of the hunt. I fired while holding the reins in
my hands. The consequence was, my bullet struck the animal somewhere
about the head, got entangled in his mane, where it would drop
out in a day or two. My horse immediately veered to one side,
and allowed the buffalo to run until I could reload. I now saw
my beast knew more of the chase than I did, and dropping the rein
upon his neck, allowed him full freedom.</p>

<p>Cautiously, but rapidly, he came alongside the plunging buffalo,
and taking more care, I sent a bullet through the fore part of
his body. It was his death-wound; and, seemingly conscious of
his fate, and determined on revenge, he wheeled instantly round,
drove his fore-feet into the ground, and dropped his head to rip
up my charger. This movement was so sudden, and we were so close
upon him, that my horse could neither check his speed nor turn
to one side. But he avoided him for all that. Dropping upon his
haunches with a snort, he made a terrific bound upward and went
clean over the buffalo. The maddened animal expected this, and
plunged his horns upward at him, expecting to still kill him.
The instinct of the horse was too much, however; he, too, feared
such a fate, and leaped high enough to avoid him. As he came to
the earth again, he plunged swiftly away, the enraged buffalo
in full pursuit; but he easily kept clear from him, wheeling and
dodging, and still remaining nigh enough for me to give my shot.
My gun was unloaded, and before I could charge it, the buffalo
had fallen to the earth and was fast dying.</p>

<p>I now looked about me. Buffaloes were flying in every direction,
and the forms of the savages could be seen darting to and fro
among them, dealing death and destruction at every turn. The main
herd was pouring simultaneously southward, while the scores which
had been cut off, were endeavoring to rejoin them, carrying us
along with them. In different parts of the prairie could be seen
the dark, motionless forms of the slain buffaloes, showing how
successful the chase had been thus far.</p>

<p>The sky, which in the morning was fair and clear, was now becoming
overcast with heavy clouds, and two or three warning rumbles of
thunder were heard in the distance. Still, the savages were too
excited to notice the interruption, as long as a single buffalo
remained. I saw Jim plunge his horse unhesitatingly into a crowd
of a dozen or so, when, as he commenced dealing destruction, his
horse became entangled, and he was compelled to make a flying
leap over the backs of the animals around him. This he accomplished
successfully, leaping from one back to the other, until he was
clear of them all.</p>

<p>Suddenly, it occurred to me, while holding my fiery horse, that
if I meditated escape it was high time to be about it. Turning
to the southward, I could just descry the drove thundering away,
a vast cloud of dust circling above them. The rein was dropped
upon the neck of my horse, and, stretching out his head, he bounded
away like the wind. He was a noble animal, and was now in his
element. He enjoyed the chase as much as any of the savages; and,
as mile after mile of prairie flew beneath his feet, he was only
warming into the excitement. As I looked back, I could just discern
the Indians, like specks in the distance, still at their bloody
work.</p>

<p>We were now at no great distance from the herd, and my horse
catching sight of an old worried bull, somewhat in the rear, instantly
made toward him. He was too jaded to hasten his pace, and I could
see his fury was roused. I prepared to shoot him, as it would
go to show my pursuers, if I should have any, that the excitement
of the chase had alone carried me away. While yet some distance,
he shied to one side, and turned his head warningly toward us,
but without halting. The horse, however, finding that I still
restrained my shot, continued to bring me closer. At last, the
bison struck into a swifter run, and made desperate efforts to
rejoin his companions. In an instant I was beside him, and holding
my gun to my shoulder, was just on the point of firing, when he
suddenly stood at bay, in precisely the same manner as the other.
My horse, instead of making a running leap this time, stopped
instantaneously, planting his feet firmly in the ground. I was
not prepared for this, and shot a dozen feet over his head, falling
upon my face within a foot of the buffalo. The shock was terrible,
and I was severely injured. I endeavored to rise, fearing that
I should be gored and trampled to death, but was unable, and heard
the buffalo scampering away. I placed my hand to my face, and
found it covered with blood, and a strange bewilderment was coming
over me. I arose to my knees, and gazed about me. The buffalo
was plunging in the rear of his drove, while my horse was galloping
wildly around me, his mane and bridle flying in the wind. I heard
the bursting of thunder overhead, and everything was growing dark
and confused. I tried again to rise, but failed. There was a thick
darkness about me, a heavy hand pressing me to the earth, and
all become chaotic.</p>

<p>When consciousness returned, all was blank darkness. The rain
was pouring down in torrents, and, stunned and bleeding, I lay
on the soaked, cold, spongy earth. Gradually, the remembrance
of my misfortune came over me. I must have been lying several
hours upon the prairie, exposed to the cold, dismal storm. My
clothes were saturated with the chilling rain, and my face and
hands bedabbled with mud and dirt.</p>

<p>I struggled desperately to my feet, and endeavored to pierce
the Stygian gloom around; but it was useless; not the smallest
point of the faintest light could be seen in any direction. Up,
down, on every hand, the same solid walls of darkness enveloped
me. I was many miles from the Indian village, and had lost its
direction. At that moment, I would have given worlds to have been
within Jim’s lodge. Flight, in my present condition, was not to
be thought of, and I must soon receive succor or I should perish.</p>

<p>I listened. In the dismal sweep of the rain something like a
footstep was heard. I called out, but there was no reply. Again
the splash of a foot was heard, now from a different point. Soon
I discovered some animal was walking around me in a circle. Feeling
round in the spongy prairie, I found my rifle, but it was useless
as a means of defense, as the charge was thoroughly wetted. I
clubbed it, and waited for the attack. Still around and around
the same step went. At first I fondly hoped it might be Jim, or
one of his companions, but its footfall showed it to be a quadruped,
and its approach was too cautious. Suddenly it halted and walked
directly toward me. I drew my rifle back, ready to brain it the
minute it was within my reach. A faint neigh was heard&mdash;joy inexpressible!
it was my faithful horse. As I called to him, he approached, and
lowered his head for me to take his bridle. With a feeling of
deep thankfulness and hope, I clambered into the saddle, and he
bounded away, his unerring instinct leading him straight toward
home.</p>

<p>The rain continued to beat, cold and dismal, and I felt already
burning within me a hot, fiery fever, from the terrible suffering
I had undergone. I should soon be prostrated, and without some
kindly hand to nurse me, would inevitably perish. But the horse
was certain; and, after an hour or two, my heart leaped, as we
entered the silent Indian village. But one light was burning,
and that was in the lodge of Jim, showing that he expected my
return. I rode instantly up to the entrance and dismounted, while
my noble horse made off to look out for himself. Jim arose as
he heard my approach, and, lifting his torch, advanced to meet
me.</p>

<p>"You had long hunt&mdash;"</p>

<p>He started back in horror at my appearance. Then, holding his
light over his head, and peering at me, he asked:</p>

<p>"What de matter? Been in fight?"</p>

<p>"No; I was thrown from my horse, and lay senseless upon the prairie
until a short time ago. I feel bad, Jim, and fear I am severely
injured," said I, starting to seat myself.</p>

<p>"Wait minute; am hurt; let me fix ’em."</p>

<p>He clapped his hands, and instantly the bundle of blankets at
the side of the lodge arose to an upright position, and his squaw
walked forth. My wounds were now dressed, my garments changed
for dry ones, and with a hot cup of drink, I was swathed in blankets,
and placed by the fire. Jim said it was not far from morning,
and if at that time I was worse, he would call in the Medicine
Man.</p>

<p>All night the fever burned and raged, and when morning came I
was partially delirious. Jim examined my pulse, shook his head
doubtingly, and departed from the lodge. In a short time he returned,
and with him came the Medicine Man, an Indian considerably advanced
in years, and much loved and honored by his tribe. He, too, looked
grave, and held a consultation in an undertone with Jim. From
these signs, I knew I was dangerously, probably fatally injured.</p>

<p>And now came days of those strange, indescribable visions that
come over one in high fever. I was in all imaginable places, and
saw wonderful persons and scenes. Now and then, there were moments
when reason flitted to its throne. At such times I saw the Medicine
Man or Jim near me; and once, as I wonderingly opened my eyes,
I saw the mysterious captive bending over me. I looked straight
into her dark, liquid eyes, and reached forth and touched her
garment, to satisfy myself that it was no freak of mind. My fixed
stare alarmed her, and she looked inquiringly at the Medicine
Man. He mumbled something, and she departed.</p>

<p>About a week after my accident, as I subsequently learned, I
awoke with my full reason. As I looked wonderingly about me, the
first object that encountered my eyes was the captive to whom
I have alluded. My fixed stare at her seemed to alarm her, and
she arose to pass out.</p>

<p>"Wait," said I; "pray do not leave me."</p>

<p>"But you should not talk," she replied, much agitated; "the Medicine
Man would not allow it; you will surely injure yourself."</p>

<p>"You and the Medicine Man are both mistaken, if he thinks thus.
I know I have been sick and delirious, but my mind was never clearer
than it is this instant, and I know a few moments’ conversation
cannot injure me. Let me beg you not to refuse me this, as I cannot
tell whether the opportunity will ever again be offered."</p>

<p>The being before me was much embarrassed, and for a moment hesitated,
seemingly in doubt between duty and inclination. Seizing the opportunity,
I urged my wish with greater fervor than ever. Finally she glanced
furtively around, as though she expected to meet the twinkling
orbs of the Medicine Man, and then answered:</p>

<p>"I cannot refuse your request, and yet it seems wrong that I
should thus disobey the injunctions that were given for your good.
What is it that you wish to ask me?"</p>

<p>"Am I out of danger?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. You have been crazy for a long time, and more than
once the Medicine Man has shaken his head in doubt when he looked
upon you."</p>

<p>"Have you not watched by me nearly all the time I have been thus?"
I gazed full in her face as I uttered this question, and she dropped
her eyes in confusion, as she replied:</p>

<p>"I have assisted the Medicine Man several times as he wished
me to, and I have done no more to you than I would to any one
in similar circumstances."</p>

<p>"No, sweet being, I know you haven’t," I exclaimed, in admiration;
"your heart is open to any one. Who you are I know not, but I
can see your race is similar to my own, and judge you to be a
willing prisoner among these Indians. Your image has long been
before me, and I can never forget your fair, angelic face. What
first was merely <em>interest</em> upon my part, has grown into
a stronger passion for you, though I fear&mdash;"</p>

<p>I paused as she suddenly arose to her feet, and raised her hand
in a warning manner. Before I could ask the meaning of this, a
shuffling step was heard, and the next minute the Medicine Man
made his appearance. He gesticulated angrily toward her, and she
passed quietly out of the lodge. I followed her with my eyes,
and as she reached the passage way, she turned toward me with
a look that told more than words.</p>

<p>The Medicine Man evidently suspected what I had been doing; for
I could see he was excited, and mumbled continually to himself.
He forced a bitter, scalding drink into my mouth, which was soothing
in its effects, and in a short time I slept.</p>

<p>Now comes a long blank in my memory. After this incident, black
night shut around my mind. There is a faint recollection of again
seeing Jim and the Medicine Man bending over me, and the sweet
pale face of the fair captive, and then again came utter oblivion.</p>
