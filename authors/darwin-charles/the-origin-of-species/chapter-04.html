<P>

How will the struggle for existence,
discussed too briefly in the last chapter, act in regard to variation?
Can the principle of selection, which we have seen is so potent in the
hands of man, apply in nature? I think we shall see that it can act
most effectually. Let it be borne in mind in what an endless number of
strange peculiarities our domestic productions, and, in a lesser
degree, those under nature, vary; and how strong the hereditary
tendency is. Under domestication, it may be truly said that the, whole
organisation becomes in some degree plastic. Let it be borne in mind
how infinitely complex and close-fitting are the mutual relations of
all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of
life. Can it, then, be thought improbable, seeing that variations
useful to man have undoubtedly occurred, that other variations useful
in some way to each being in the great and complex battle of life,
should sometimes occur in the course of thousands of generations?  If
such do occur, can we doubt (remembering 
that many more individuals
are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having any
advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of
 surviving and of procreating their kind? On the other
hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree
injurious would be rigidly destroyed. This preservation of favourable
variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural
Selection. Variations neither useful nor injurious would not be
affected by natural selection, and would be left a fluctuating
element, as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic.
<P>
We shall best understand the probable course of natural selection
by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change, for
instance, of climate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants
would almost immediately undergo a change, and some species might
become extinct. We may conclude, from what we have seen of the
intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country
are bound together, that any change in the numerical proportions of
some of the inhabitants, independently of the change of climate
itself, would most seriously affect many of the others. If the country
were open on its borders, new forms would certainly immigrate, and
this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former
inhabitants. Let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a
single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be. But in the case
of an island, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers, into
which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter, we should
then have 
places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be
better filled up, if some of the original inhabitants were in some
manner modified; for, had the area been open to immigration, these
same places would have been seized on by intruders. In such case,
every slight modification, which in the course of ages chanced to
arise, and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the
species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions, would
tend to be preserved; and natural selection would thus have free scope
for the work of improvement.
<P>
We have reason to believe, as stated in the first chapter, that a
change in the conditions of life, by specially acting on the
reproductive system, causes or increases variability; and in the
foregoing case the conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a
change, and this would manifestly be favourable to 
natural selection, by giving a better chance of profitable variations
occurring; and unless profitable variations do occur, natural
selection can do nothing. Not that, as I believe, any extreme amount
of variability is necessary; as man can certainly produce great
results by adding up in any given direction mere individual
differences, so could Nature, but far more easily, from having
incomparably longer time at her disposal. Nor do I believe that any
great physical change, as of climate, or any unusual degree of
isolation to check immigration, is actually necessary to produce new
and unoccupied places for natural selection to fill up by modifying
and improving some of the varying inhabitants. For as all the
inhabitants of each country are struggling together with nicely
balanced forces, extremely slight modifications in the structure or
habits of one inhabitant would often give it an advantage over others;
and still further modifications of the same kind would often still
further increase the advantage. No country can be named in which all
the native inhabitants are now so perfectly adapted to each other and
to the physical conditions under which they live, that none of 
them
could anyhow be improved; for in all countries, the natives have been
so far conquered by naturalised productions, that they have allowed
foreigners to take firm possession of the land.  And as foreigners
have thus everywhere beaten some of the natives, we may safely
conclude that the natives might have been modified with advantage, so
as to have better resisted such intruders.
<P>
As man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by his
methodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not nature
effect? Man can act only on external and visible characters: nature
cares nothing for appearances, except in so far as they may be useful
to any being. She can act on every internal organ, on every shade of
constitutional difference, on the whole machinery of life.  Man
selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the being
which she tends. Every selected character is fully exercised by her;
and the being is placed under well-suited conditions of life. Man
keeps the natives of many climates in the same country; he seldom
exercises each selected character in some peculiar and fitting manner;
he feeds a long and a short beaked pigeon on the same food; he does
not exercise  a long-backed or long-legged quadruped in
any peculiar manner; he exposes sheep with long and short wool to the
same climate.  He does not allow the most vigorous males to struggle
for the females. He does not rigidly destroy all inferior animals, but
protects during each varying season, as far as lies in his power, all
his productions. He often begins his selection by some half-monstrous
form; or at least by some modification prominent enough to catch his
eye, or to be plainly useful to him. Under nature, the slightest
difference of structure or constitution may well turn the
nicely-balanced scale in the 
struggle for life, and so be preserved.
How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man!  how short his time!
and consequently how poor will his products be, compared with those
accumulated by nature during whole geological periods. Can we wonder,
then, that nature's productions should be far 'truer' in character
than man's productions; that they should be infinitely better adapted
to the most complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the
stamp of far higher workmanship?
<P>
It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly
scrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the
slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all
that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever
opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in
relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life. We see
nothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of time has
marked the long lapses of ages, and then so imperfect is our view into
long past geological ages, that we only see that the forms of life are
now different from what they formerly were.
<P>
Although natural selection can act only through and for the good of
each being, yet characters and structures, which we are apt to
consider as of very trifling importance, may thus be acted on.  When
we see leaf-eating insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the
alpine ptarmigan white in winter, the red-grouse the colour of
heather, and the black-grouse that of peaty earth, we must believe
that these tints are of service to these birds and insects in
preserving them from danger. Grouse, if not destroyed at some period
of their lives, would increase in countless numbers; they are known to
suffer largely from birds of  prey; and hawks are guided
by eyesight to their prey,   so much so, that on 
parts of the
Continent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons, as being the
most liable to destruction.  Hence I can see no reason to doubt that
natural selection might be most effective in giving the proper colour
to each kind of grouse, and in keeping that colour, when once
acquired, true and constant. Nor ought we to think that the occasional
destruction of an animal of any particular colour would produce little
effect: we should remember how essential it is in a flock of white
sheep to destroy every lamb with the faintest trace of black. In
plants the down on the fruit and the colour of the flesh are
considered by botanists as characters of the most trifling importance:
yet we hear from an excellent horticulturist, Downing, that in the
United States smooth-skinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle, a
curculio, than those with down; that purple plums suffer far more from
a certain disease than yellow plums; whereas another disease attacks
yellow-fleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured flesh.
If, with all the aids of art, these slight differences make a great
difference in cultivating the several varieties, assuredly, in a state
of nature, where the trees would have to struggle with other trees and
with a host of enemies, such differences would effectually settle
which variety, whether a smooth or downy, a yellow or purple fleshed
fruit, should succeed.
<P>
In looking at many small points of difference between species,
which, as far as our ignorance permits us to judge, seem to be quite
unimportant, we must not forget that climate, food, &amp;c., probably
produce some slight and direct effect. It is, however, far more
necessary to bear in mind that there are many unknown laws of
correlation of growth, which, when one part of the organisation is
modified through variation, and the modifications are accumulated by
natural selection for 
the good of the being, will cause other
modifications, often of the most unexpected nature.
<P>
As we see that those variations which under domestication appear at
any particular period of life, tend to reappear in the offspring at
the same period;   for instance, in the seeds of the many
varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants; in the 
caterpillar and cocoon stages of the varieties of the silkworm; in the
eggs of poultry, and in the colour of the down of their chickens; in
the horns of our sheep and cattle when nearly adult;   so in a
state of nature, natural selection will be enabled to act on and
modify organic beings at any age, by the accumulation of profitable
variations at that age, and by their inheritance at a corresponding
age. If it profit a plant to have its seeds more and more widely
disseminated by the wind, I can see no greater difficulty in this
being effected through natural selection, than in the cotton-planter
increasing and improving by selection the down in the pods on his
cotton-trees.  Natural selection may modify and adapt the larva of an
insect to a score of contingencies, wholly different from those which
concern the mature insect. These modifications will no doubt affect,
through the laws of correlation, the structure of the adult; and
probably in the case of those insects which live only for a few hours,
and which never feed, a large part of their structure is merely the
correlated result of successive changes in the structure of their
larvae. So, conversely, modifications in the adult will probably often
affect the structure of the larva; but in all cases natural selection
will ensure that modifications consequent on other modifications at a
different period of life, shall not be in the least degree injurious:
for if they became so, they would cause the extinction of the species.
<P>
Natural selection will modify the structure of the 
young in
relation to the parent, and of the parent in relation to the young. In
social animals it will adapt the structure of each individual for the
benefit of the community; if each in consequence profits by the
selected change. What natural selection cannot do, is to modify the
structure of one species, without giving it any advantage, for the
good of another species; and though statements to this effect may be
found in works of natural history, I cannot find one case which will
bear investigation. A structure used only once in an animal's whole
life, if of high importance to it, might be modified to any extent by
natural selection; for instance, the great jaws possessed by certain
insects, and used exclusively for opening the cocoon   or the
hard tip to the beak of nestling birds, used for breaking the egg. It
has been asserted,  that of the best short-beaked
tumbler-pigeons more perish in the egg than are able to get out of it;
so that fanciers assist in the act of hatching. Now, if nature had to
make the beak of a full-grown pigeon very short for the bird's own
advantage, the process of modification would be very slow, and there
would be simultaneously the most rigorous selection of the young birds
within the egg, which had the most powerful and hardest beaks, for all
with weak beaks would inevitably perish: or, more delicate and more
easily broken shells might be selected, the thickness of the shell
being known to vary like every other structure.
<P>
<H4>Sexual Selection</H4> 
<P>
Inasmuch as
peculiarities often appear under domestication in one sex and become
hereditarily attached to that sex, the same fact probably occurs under
nature, and if so, natural selection will be able to modify one sex in
its functional relations to the other sex, or in relation to wholly
different habits of life in the two sexes, as is sometimes the case
with insects. And this leads me to say a few words on what I call
Sexual Selection. This depends, not on a struggle for existence, but
on a struggle between the males for possession of the females; the
result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or no
offspring.  Sexual selection is, therefore, less rigorous than natural
selection. Generally, the most vigorous males, those which are best
fitted for their places in nature, will leave most progeny. But in
many cases, victory will depend not on general vigour, but on having
special weapons, confined to the male sex. A hornless stag or spurless
cock would have a poor chance of leaving offspring. Sexual selection
by always allowing the victor to breed might surely give indomitable
courage, length to the spur, and strength to the wing to strike in the
spurred leg, as well as the brutal cock-fighter, who knows well that
he can improve his breed by careful selection of the best cocks. How
low in the scale of nature this law of battle descends, I know not;
male alligators have been described as fighting, bellowing, and
whirling round, like Indians in a war-dance, for the possession of the
females; male salmons have been seen fighting all day long; male
stag-beetles often bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males.
The war is, perhaps,  severest between the males of
polygamous animals, and these seem oftenest provided with special
weapons. The males of carnivorous animals are already well armed;
though to them and to others, special means of defence may be given
through means of sexual selection, as the mane to the lion, the
shoulder-pad to the boar, and the hooked jaw to the male salmon; for
the shield may be as important for victory, as the sword or spear.
<P>
Amongst birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful character.
All those who have attended to the subject, 
believe that there is the
severest rivalry between the males of many species to attract by
singing the females. The rock-thrush of Guiana, birds of paradise, and
some others, congregate; and successive males display their gorgeous
plumage and perform strange antics before the females, which standing
by as spectators, at last choose the most attractive partner. Those
who have closely attended to birds in confinement well know that they
often take individual preferences and dislikes: thus Sir R. Heron has
described how one pied peacock was eminently attractive to all his hen
birds. It may appear childish to attribute any effect to such
apparently weak means: I cannot here enter on the details necessary to
support this view; but if man can in a short time give elegant
carriage and beauty to his bantams, according to his standard of
beauty, I can see no good reason to doubt that female birds, by
selecting, during thousands of generations, the most melodious or
beautiful males, according to their standard of beauty, might produce
a marked effect. I strongly suspect that some well-known laws with
respect to the plumage of male and female birds, in comparison with
the plumage of the young, can be explained on the view of plumage
having been chiefly modified by sexual selection, acting when the
birds have come to the breeding age or during the breeding season; the
modifications thus produced being inherited at corresponding ages or
seasons, either by the males alone, or by the males and females; but I
have not space here to enter on this subject.
<P>
Thus it is, as I believe, that when the males and females of any
animal have the same general habits of life, but differ in structure,
colour, or ornament, such differences have been mainly caused by
sexual selection; that is, individual males have had, in 
successive generations, some slight advantage over other 
males, in
their weapons, means of defence, or charms; and have transmitted these
advantages to their male offspring.  Yet, I would not wish to
attribute all such sexual differences to this agency: for we see
peculiarities arising and becoming attached to the male sex in our
domestic animals (as the wattle in male carriers, horn-like
protuberances in the cocks of certain fowls, &amp;c.), which we cannot
believe to be either useful to the males in battle, or attractive to
the females. We see analogous cases under nature, for instance, the
tuft of hair on the breast of the turkey-cock, which can hardly be
either useful or ornamental to this bird;   indeed, had the tuft
appeared under domestication, it would have been called a monstrosity.
<P>
<H4>Illustrations of the action of Natural Selection</H4> 
<P>
In order to make it clear how, as I believe, natural
selection acts, I must beg permission to give one or two imaginary
illustrations. Let us take the case of a wolf, which preys on various
animals, securing some by craft, some by strength, and some by
fleetness; and let us suppose that the fleetest prey, a deer for
instance, had from any change in the country increased in numbers, or
that other prey had decreased in numbers, during that season of the
year when the wolf is hardest pressed for food. I can under such
circumstances see no reason to doubt that the swiftest and slimmest
wolves would have the best chance of surviving, and so be preserved or
selected,   provided always that they retained strength to
master their prey at this or at some other period of the year, when
they might be compelled to prey on other animals. I can see no more
reason to doubt this, than that man can improve the fleetness of his
greyhounds by careful and methodical selection, or by that unconscious
selection which results from each man trying 
to keep the best dogs
without any thought of modifying the breed.
<P>
Even without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals
on which our wolf preyed, a cub might be born with an innate tendency
to pursue certain kinds of prey. Nor can this be thought very
improbable; for we often observe great differences in the natural
tendencies of our domestic animals;  one cat, for
instance, taking to catch rats, another mice; one cat, according to Mr.
St. John, bringing home winged game, another hares or rabbits, and
another hunting on marshy ground and almost nightly catching woodcocks
or snipes. The tendency to catch rats rather than mice is known to be
inherited. Now, if any slight innate change of habit or of structure
benefited an individual wolf, it would have the best chance of
surviving and of leaving offspring. Some of its young would probably
inherit the same habits or structure, and by the repetition of this
process, a new variety might be formed which would either supplant or
coexist with the parent-form of wolf. Or, again, the wolves inhabiting
a mountainous district, and those frequenting the lowlands, would
naturally be forced to hunt different prey; and from the continued
preservation of the individuals best fitted for the two sites, two
varieties might slowly be formed.  These varieties would cross and
blend where they met; but to this subject of intercrossing we shall
soon have to return.  I may add, that, according to Mr. Pierce, there
are two varieties of the wolf inhabiting the Catskill Mountains in the
United States, one with a light greyhound-like form, which pursues
deer, and the other more bulky, with shorter legs, which more
frequently attacks the shepherd's flocks.
<P>
Let us now take a more complex case. Certain plants excrete a sweet
juice, apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from
their sap: this is 
effected by glands at the base of the stipules in
some Leguminosae, and at the back of the leaf of the common laurel.
This juice, though small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects.
Let us now suppose a little sweet juice or nectar to be excreted by
the inner bases of the petals of a flower. In this case insects in
seeking the nectar would get dusted with pollen, and would certainly
often transport the pollen from one flower to the stigma of another
flower.  The flowers of two distinct individuals of the same species
would thus get crossed; and the act of crossing, we have good reason
to believe (as will hereafter be more fully alluded to), would produce
very vigorous seedlings, which consequently would have the best chance
of flourishing and surviving. Some of these seedlings would probably
inherit the nectar-excreting power. Those in  individual
flowers which had the largest glands or nectaries, and which excreted
most nectar, would be oftenest visited by insects, and would be
oftenest crossed; and so in the long-run would gain the upper hand.
Those flowers, also, which had their stamens and pistils placed, in
relation to the size and habits of the particular insects which
visited them, so as to favour in any degree the transportal of their
pollen from flower to flower, would likewise be favoured or selected.
We might have taken the case of insects visiting flowers for the sake
of collecting pollen instead of nectar; and as pollen is formed for
the sole object of fertilisation, its destruction appears a simple
loss to the plant; yet if a little pollen were carried, at first
occasionally and then habitually, by the pollen-devouring insects from
flower to flower, and a cross thus effected, although nine-tenths of
the pollen were destroyed, it might still be a great gain to the
plant; and those individuals which produced more and more pollen, and
had larger and larger anthers, would be selected.
<P>
When our plant, by this process of the continued preservation or
natural selection of more and more attractive flowers, had been
rendered highly attractive to insects, they would, unintentionally on
their part, regularly carry pollen from flower to flower; and that
they can most effectually do this, I could easily show by many
striking instances. I will give only one   not as a very
striking case, but as likewise illustrating one step in the separation
of the sexes of plants, presently to be alluded to. Some holly-trees
bear only male flowers, which have four stamens producing rather a
small quantity of pollen, and a rudimentary pistil; other holly-trees
bear only female flowers; these have a full-sized pistil, and four
stamens with shrivelled anthers, in which not a grain of pollen can be
detected. Having found a female tree exactly sixty yards from a male
tree, I put the stigmas of twenty flowers, taken from different
branches, under the microscope, and on all, without exception, there
were pollen-grains, and on some a profusion of pollen. As the wind had
set for several days from the female to the male tree, the pollen
could not thus have been carried. The weather had been cold and
boisterous, and therefore not favourable to bees, nevertheless every
female flower which I examined had been effectually 
fertilised by the bees, accidentally dusted with pollen, having flown
from tree to tree in search of nectar. But to return to our imaginary
case: as soon as the plant had been rendered so highly attractive to
insects that pollen was regularly carried from flower to flower,
another process might commence. No naturalist doubts the advantage of
what has been called the 'physiological division of labour;' hence we
may believe that it would be advantageous to a plant to produce
stamens alone in one flower or on one whole plant, and pistils alone
in 
another flower or on another plant. In plants under culture and
placed under new conditions of life, sometimes the male organs and
sometimes the female organs become more or less impotent; now if we
suppose this to occur in ever so slight a degree under nature, then as
pollen is already carried regularly from flower to flower, and as a
more complete separation of the sexes of our plant would be
advantageous on the principle of the division of labour, individuals
with this tendency more and more increased, would be continually
favoured or selected, until at last a complete separation of the sexes
would be effected.
<P>
Let us now turn to the nectar-feeding insects in our imaginary
case: we may suppose the plant of which we have been slowly increasing
the nectar by continued selection, to be a common plant; and that
certain insects depended in main part on its nectar for food. I could
give many facts, showing how anxious bees are to save time; for
instance, their habit of cutting holes and sucking the nectar at the
bases of certain flowers, which they can, with a very little more
trouble, enter by the mouth. Bearing such facts in mind, I can see no
reason to doubt that an accidental deviation in the size and form of
the body, or in the curvature and length of the proboscis, &amp;c.,
far too slight to be appreciated by us, might profit a bee or other
insect, so that an individual so characterised would be able to obtain
its food more quickly, and so have a better chance of living and
leaving descendants. Its descendants would probably inherit a tendency
to a similar slight deviation of structure. The tubes of the corollas
of the common red and incarnate clovers (Trifolium pratense and
incarnatum) do not on a hasty glance appear to differ in length; yet
the hive-bee can easily suck the nectar out of the 
incarnate clover, but not out of the common red 
clover, which is
visited by humble-bees alone; so that whole fields of the red clover
offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the hive-bee.
Thus it might be a great advantage to the hive-bee to have a slightly
longer or differently constructed proboscis. On the other hand, I have
found by experiment that the fertility of clover greatly depends on
bees visiting and moving parts of the corolla, so as to push the
pollen on to the stigmatic surface. Hence, again, if humble-bees were
to become rare in any country, it might be a great advantage to the
red clover to have a shorter or more deeply divided tube to its
corolla, so that the hive-bee could visit its flowers. Thus I can
understand how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either
simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted in the
most perfect manner to each other, by the continued preservation of
individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of
structure.
<P>
I am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection,
exemplified in the above imaginary instances, is open to the same
objections which were at first urged against Sir Charles Lyell's noble
views on 'the modern changes of the earth, as illustrative of
geology;' but we now very seldom hear the action, for instance, of the
coast-waves, called a trifling and insignificant cause, when applied
to the excavation of gigantic valleys or to the formation of the
longest lines of inland cliffs. Natural selection can act only by the
preservation and accumulation of infinitesimally small inherited
modifications, each profitable to the preserved being; and as modern
geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a great
valley by a single diluvial wave, so will natural selection, if it be
a true principle, banish the belief of the continued creation of new
organic 
beings, or of any great and sudden modification in their
structure.
<P>
<H4>On the Intercrossing of Individuals</H4> 
<P>
 I must here introduce a short digression. In the case of animals and
plants with separated sexes, it is of course obvious that two
individuals must always unite for each birth; but in the case of
hermaphrodites this is far from obvious.  Nevertheless I am strongly
inclined to believe that  with all hermaphrodites two
individuals, either occasionally or habitually, concur for the
reproduction of their kind. This view, I may add, was first suggested
by Andrew Knight.  We shall presently see its importance; but I must
here treat the subject with extreme brevity, though I have the
materials prepared for an ample discussion. All vertebrate animals,
all insects, and some other large groups of animals, pair for each
birth. Modern research has much diminished the number of supposed
hermaphrodites, and of real hermaphrodites a large number pair; that
is, two individuals regularly unite for reproduction, which is all
that concerns us. But still there are many hermaphrodite animals which
certainly do not habitually pair, and a vast majority of plants are
hermaphrodites. What reason, it may be asked, is there for supposing
in these cases that two individuals ever concur in reproduction? As it
is impossible here to enter on details, I must trust to some general
considerations alone.
<P>
In the first place, I have collected so large a body of facts,
showing, in accordance with the almost universal belief of breeders,
that with animals and plants a cross between different varieties, or
between individuals of the same variety but of another strain, gives
vigour and fertility to the offspring; and on the other hand, that
<I>close</I> interbreeding diminishes vigour and
fertility; that 
these facts alone incline me to believe that it is a
general law of nature (utterly ignorant though we be of the meaning of
the law) that no organic being self-fertilises itself for an eternity
of generations; but that a cross with another individual is
occasionally perhaps at very long intervals -- indispensable.
<P>
On the belief that this is a law of nature, we can, I think,
understand several large classes of facts, such as the following,
which on any other view are inexplicable.  Every hybridizer knows how
unfavourable exposure to wet is to the fertilisation of a flower, yet
what a multitude of flowers have their anthers and stigmas fully
exposed to the weather! but if an occasional cross be indispensable,
the fullest freedom for the entrance of pollen from another individual
will explain this state of exposure, more especially as the plant's
own anthers and pistil generally stand so close together that
self-fertilisation seems  almost inevitable. Many flowers,
on the other hand, have their organs of fructification closely
enclosed, as in the great papilionaceous or pea-family; but in
several, perhaps in all, such flowers, there is a very curious
adaptation between the structure of the flower and the manner in which
bees suck the nectar; for, in doing this, they either push the
flower's own pollen on the stigma, or bring pollen from another
flower. So necessary are the visits of bees to papilionaceous flowers,
that I have found, by experiments published elsewhere, that their
fertility is greatly diminished if these visits be prevented. Now, it
is scarcely possible that bees should fly from flower to flower, and
not carry pollen from one to the other, to the great good, as I
believe, of the plant. Bees will act like a camel-hair pencil, and it
is quite sufficient just to touch the anthers of one flower and then
the stigma of another with the same brush to ensure fertilisation; but
it must not be 
supposed that bees would thus produce a multitude of
hybrids between distinct species; for if you bring on the same brush a
plant's own pollen and pollen from another species, the former will
have such a prepotent effect, that it will invariably and completely
destroy, as has been shown by G&auml;rtner, any influence from the foreign
pollen.
<P>
When the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil, or
slowly move one after the other towards it, the contrivance seems
adapted solely to ensure self-fertilisation; and no doubt it is useful
for this end: but, the agency of insects is often required to cause
the stamens to spring forward, as K&ouml;lreuter has shown to be the case
with the barberry; and curiously in this very genus, which seems to
have a special contrivance for self-fertilisation, it is well known
that if very closely-allied forms or varieties are planted near each
other, it is hardly possible to raise pure seedlings, so largely do
they naturally cross.  In many other cases, far from there being any
aids for self-fertilisation, there are special contrivances, as I
could show from the writings of C. C. Sprengel and from my own
observations, which effectually prevent the stigma receiving pollen
from its own flower: for instance, in Lobelia fulgens, there is a
really beautiful and elaborate contrivance by which every one of the
infinitely numerous pollen-granules are swept out of the conjoined
anthers  of each flower, before the stigma of that
individual flower is ready to receive them; and as this flower is
never visited, at least in my garden, by insects, it never sets a
seed, though by placing pollen from one flower on the stigma of
another, I raised plenty of seedlings; and whilst another species of
Lobelia growing close by, which is visited by bees, seeds freely. In
very many other cases, though there be no special mechanical
contrivance to prevent the stigma of a flower receiving its own
pollen, yet, as 
C. C. Sprengel has shown, and as I can confirm, either
the anthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation, or the
stigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready, so that
these plants have in fact separated sexes, and must habitually be
crossed. How strange are these facts! How strange that the pollen and
stigmatic surface of the same flower, though placed so close together,
as if for the very purpose of self-fertilisation, should in so many
cases be mutually useless to each other! How simply are these facts
explained on the view of an occasional cross with a distinct
individual being advantageous or indispensable!
<P>
If several varieties of the cabbage, radish, onion, and of some
other plants, be allowed to seed near each other, a large majority, as
I have found, of the seedlings thus raised will turn out mongrels: for
instance, I raised 233 seedling cabbages from some plants of different
varieties growing near each other, and of these only 78 were true to
their kind, and some even of these were not perfectly true.  Yet the
pistil of each cabbage-flower is surrounded not only by its own six
stamens, but by those of the many other flowers on the same plant.
How, then, comes it that such a vast number of the seedlings are
mongrelised? I suspect that it must arise from the pollen of a
distinct <I>variety</I> having a prepotent effect
over a flower's own pollen; and that this is part of the general law
of good being derived from the intercrossing of distinct individuals
of the same species. When distinct <I>species</I>
are crossed the case is
directly the reverse, for a plant's own pollen is always prepotent
over foreign pollen; but to this subject we shall return in a future
chapter.
<P>
In the case of a gigantic tree covered with innumerable flowers, it
may be objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree
to tree, and at most only from flower to flower on the same
tree, and that flowers on the same tree can be considered as distinct
individuals only in a limited sense. I believe this objection to be
valid, but that nature has largely provided against it by giving to
trees a strong tendency to bear flowers with separated sexes. When the
sexes are separated, although the male and female flowers may be
produced on the same tree, we can see that pollen must be regularly
carried from flower to flower; and this will give a better chance of
pollen being occasionally carried from tree to tree. That trees
belonging to all Orders have their sexes more often separated than
other plants, I find to be the case in this country; and at my request
Dr Hooker tabulated the trees of New Zealand, and Dr Asa Gray those of
the United States, and the result was as I anticipated. On the other
hand, Dr Hooker has recently informed me that he finds that the rule
does not hold in Australia; and I have made these few remarks on the
sexes of trees simply to call attention to the subject.
<P>
Turning for a very brief space to animals: on the land there are
some hermaphrodites, as land-mollusca and earth-worms; but these all
pair. As yet I have not found a single case of a terrestrial animal
which fertilises itself. We can understand this remarkable fact, which
offers so strong a contrast with terrestrial plants, on the view of an
occasional cross being indispensable, by considering the medium in
which terrestrial animals live, and the nature of the fertilising
element; for we know of no means, analogous to the action of insects
and of the wind in the case of plants, by which an occasional cross
could be effected with terrestrial animals without the concurrence of
two individuals. Of aquatic animals, there are many self-fertilising
hermaphrodites; but here currents in the water offer an obvious means
for an occasional cross. And, as in the case of flowers, I have as yet
failed, after consultation with one of the highest authorities,
namely, Professor Huxley, to discover a single case of an
hermaphrodite animal with the organs of reproduction so perfectly
enclosed within the body, that access from without and the occasional
influence of a distinct individual can be shown to be physically
impossible. Cirripedes long appeared to me to present a case of very
great difficulty under this point of view; but I have been enabled, by
 a fortunate chance, elsewhere to prove that two
individuals, though both are self-fertilising hermaphrodites, do
sometimes cross.
<P>
It must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that, in
the case of both animals and plants, species of the same family and
even of the same genus, though agreeing closely with each other in
almost their whole organisation, yet are not rarely, some of them
hermaphrodites, and some of them unisexual. But if, in fact, all
hermaphrodites do occasionally intercross with other individuals, the
difference between hermaphrodites and unisexual species, as far as
function is concerned, becomes very small.
<P>
From these several considerations and from the many special facts
which I have collected, but which I am not here able to give, I am
strongly inclined to suspect that, both in the vegetable and animal
kingdoms, an occasional intercross with a distinct individual is a law
of nature. I am well aware that there are, on this view, many cases of
difficulty, some of which I am trying to investigate. Finally then, we
may conclude that in many organic beings, a cross between two
individuals is an obvious necessity for each birth; in many others it
occurs perhaps only at long intervals; but in none, as I suspect, can
self-fertilisation go on for perpetuity.
<P>
<H4>Circumstances favourable to Natural Selection</H4> 
<P>
This is an extremely intricate subject. A large
amount of inheritable and diversified variability is favourable, but
I believe mere individual differences suffice for the work. A large
number of individuals, by giving a better chance for the appearance
within any given period of profitable variations, will compensate for
a lesser amount of variability in each individual, and is, I believe, an
extremely important element of success. Though nature grants vast
periods of time for the work of natural selection, she does not grant
an indefinite period; for as all organic beings are striving, it may
be said, to seize on each place in the economy of nature, if any one
species does not become modified and improved in a corresponding
degree with its competitors, it will soon be exterminated.  
<P>
In man's methodical selection, a breeder selects for some definite
object, and free intercrossing will wholly stop his work. But when
many men, without intending to alter the breed, have a nearly common
standard of perfection, and all try to get and breed from the best
animals, much improvement and modification surely but slowly follow
from this unconscious process of selection, notwithstanding a large
amount of crossing with inferior animals. Thus it will be in nature;
for within a confined area, with some place in its polity not so
perfectly occupied as might be, natural selection will always tend to
preserve all the individuals varying in the right direction, though in
different degrees, so as better to fill up the unoccupied place. But
if the area be large, its several districts will almost certainly
present different conditions of life; and then if natural selection be
modifying and improving a species in the several districts, there will
be intercrossing with the other individuals of the same species on the
confines of each. And in this case the effects of intercrossing can
hardly be counterbalanced 
by natural selection always tending to
modify all the individuals in each district in exactly the same manner
to the conditions of each; for in a continuous area, the conditions
will generally graduate away insensibly from one district to another.
The intercrossing will most affect those animals which unite for each
birth, which wander much, and which do not breed at a very quick rate.
Hence in animals of this nature, for instance in birds, varieties will
generally be confined to separated countries; and this I believe to be
the case. In hermaphrodite organisms which cross only occasionally,
and likewise in animals which unite for each birth, but which wander
little and which can increase at a very rapid rate, a new and improved
variety might be quickly formed on any one spot, and might there
maintain itself in a body, so that whatever intercrossing took place
would be chiefly between the individuals of the same new variety. A
local variety when once thus formed might subsequently slowly spread
to other districts. On the above principle, nurserymen always prefer
getting seed from a large body of plants of the same variety, as the
chance of intercrossing with other varieties is thus lessened.
<P>
Even in the case of slow-breeding animals, which unite for
each birth, we must not overrate the effects of intercrosses
in retarding natural selection; for I can bring a considerable
catalogue of facts, showing that within the same area, varieties of
the same animal can long remain distinct, from haunting different
stations, from breeding at slightly different seasons, or from
varieties of the same kind preferring to pair together.
<P>
Intercrossing plays a very important part in nature in keeping the
individuals of the same species, or of the same variety, true and
uniform in character. It will obviously thus act far more efficiently
with those animals 
which unite for each birth; but I have already
attempted to show that we have reason to believe that occasional
intercrosses take place with all animals and with all plants. Even if
these take place only at long intervals, I am convinced that the young
thus produced will gain so much in vigour and fertility over the
offspring from long-continued self-fertilisation, that they will have
a better chance of surviving and propagating their kind; and thus, in
the long run, the influence of intercrosses, even at rare intervals,
will be great. If there exist organic beings which never intercross,
uniformity of character can be retained amongst them, as long as their
conditions of life remain the same, only through the principle of
inheritance, and through natural selection destroying any which depart
from the proper type; but if their conditions of life change and they
undergo modification, uniformity of character can be given to their
modified offspring, solely by natural selection preserving the same
favourable variations.
<P>
Isolation, also, is an important element in the process of natural
selection. In a confined or isolated area, if not very large, the
organic and inorganic conditions of life will generally be in a great
degree uniform; so that natural selection will tend to modify all the
individuals of a varying species throughout the area in the same
manner in relation to the same conditions. Intercrosses, also, with
the individuals of the same species, which otherwise would have
inhabited the surrounding and differently circumstanced districts,
will be prevented.  But isolation probably acts more efficiently in
checking the immigration of better adapted organisms, after any
physical change, such as of climate or elevation of the land, &amp;c.;
and thus new places in the natural  economy of the country
are left open for the old inhabitants to struggle for, and become
adapted to, through modifications in their structure and constitution.
Lastly, isolation, by checking immigration and consequently
competition, will give time for any new variety to be slowly improved;
and this may sometimes be of importance in the production of new
species.  If, however, an isolated area be very small, either from
being surrounded by barriers, or from having very peculiar physical
conditions, the total number of the individuals supported on it will
necessarily be very small; and fewness of individuals will greatly
retard the production of new species through natural selection, by
decreasing the chance of the appearance of favourable variations.
<P>
If we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks, and look
at any small isolated area, such as an oceanic island, although the
total number of the species inhabiting it, will be found to be small,
as we shall see in our chapter on geographical distribution; yet of
these species a very large proportion are endemic,   that is,
have been produced there, and nowhere else. Hence an oceanic island at
first sight seems to have been highly favourable for the production of
new species. But we may thus greatly deceive ourselves, for to
ascertain whether a small isolated area, or a large open area like a
continent, has been most favourable for the production of new organic
forms, we ought to make the comparison within equal times; and this we
are incapable of doing.
<P>
Although I do not doubt that isolation is of considerable importance
in the production of new species, on the whole I am inclined to
believe that largeness of area is of more importance, more especially
in the production of species, which will prove capable of enduring for
a long period, and of spreading widely. Throughout a great and open
area, not only will there be a better chance of favourable variations
arising from the large number of individuals of the same species 
there
supported, but the conditions of life are infinitely complex from the
large number of already existing species; and if some of these many
species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved
in a corresponding degree or they will be exterminated. Each new form,
also, as soon as it has been much improved, will be  able
to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into
competition with many others. Hence more new places will be formed,
and the competition to fill them will be more severe, on a large than
on a small and isolated area.  Moreover, great areas, though now
continuous, owing to oscillations of level, will often have recently
existed in a broken condition, so that the good effects of isolation
will generally, to a certain extent, have concurred. Finally, I
conclude that, although small isolated areas probably have been in
some respects highly favourable for the production of new species, yet
that the course of modification will generally have been more rapid on
large areas; and what is more important, that the new forms produced
on large areas, which already have been victorious over many
competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, will give
rise to most new varieties and species, and will thus play an
important part in the changing history of the organic world.
<P>
We can, perhaps, on these views, understand some facts which will
be again alluded to in our chapter on geographical distribution; for
instance, that the productions of the smaller continent of Australia
have formerly yielded, and apparently are now yielding, before those
of the larger Europaeo-Asiatic area. Thus, also, it is that
continental productions have everywhere become so largely naturalised
on islands. On a small island, the race for life will have been less
severe, and there will have been less modification and less
extermination. 
Hence, perhaps, it comes that the flora of Madeira,
according to Oswald Heer, resembles the extinct tertiary flora of
Europe.  All fresh-water basins, taken together, make a small area
compared with that of the sea or of the land; and, consequently, the
competition between fresh-water productions will have been less severe
than elsewhere; new forms will have been more slowly formed, and old
forms more slowly exterminated. And it is in fresh water that we find
seven genera of Ganoid fishes, remnants of a once preponderant order:
and in fresh water we find some of the most anomalous forms now known
in the world, as the Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, which, like
fossils, connect to a certain extent orders now widely separated in
the natural scale. These anomalous forms may almost be called living
fossils; they have  endured to the present day, from
having inhabited a confined area, and from having thus been exposed to
less severe competition.
<P>
To sum up the circumstances favourable and unfavourable to natural
selection, as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits. I
conclude, looking to the future, that for terrestrial productions a
large continental area, which will probably undergo many oscillations
of level, and which consequently will exist for long periods in a
broken condition, will be the most favourable for the production of
many new forms of life, likely to endure long and to spread widely.
For the area will first have existed as a continent, and the
inhabitants, at this period numerous in individuals and kinds, will
have been subjected to very severe competition. When converted by
subsidence into large separate islands, there will still exist many
individuals of the same species on each island: intercrossing on the
confines of the range of each species will thus be checked: after
physical changes of any kind, immigration will be prevented, 
so that
new places in the polity of each island will have to be filled up by
modifications of the old inhabitants; and time will be allowed for the
varieties in each to become well modified and perfected. When, by
renewed elevation, the islands shall be re-converted into a
continental area, there will again be severe competition: the most
favoured or improved varieties will be enabled to spread: there will
be much extinction of the less improved forms, and the relative
proportional numbers of the various inhabitants of the renewed
continent will again be changed; and again there will be a fair field
for natural selection to improve still further the inhabitants, and
thus produce new species.
<P>
That natural selection will always act with extreme slowness, I
fully admit. Its action depends on there being places in the polity of
nature, which can be better occupied by some of the inhabitants of the
country undergoing modification of some kind. The existence of such
places will often depend on physical changes, which are generally very
slow, and on the immigration of better adapted forms having been
checked. But the action of natural selection will probably still
oftener depend on some of the inhabitants becoming slowly modified;
the mutual relations  of many of the other inhabitants
being thus disturbed. Nothing can be effected, unless favourable
variations occur, and variation itself is apparently always a very
slow process.  The process will often be greatly retarded by free
intercrossing. Many will exclaim that these several causes are amply
sufficient wholly to stop the action of natural selection. I do not
believe so. On the other hand, I do believe that natural selection
will always act very slowly, often only at long intervals of time, and
generally on only a very few of the inhabitants of the same region at
the same time. I further believe, that this very slow, intermittent
action of natural selection accords perfectly well with what geology
tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of this world
have changed.
<P>
Slow though the process of selection may be, if feeble man can do
much by his powers of artificial selection, I can see no limit to the
amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the
coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with
their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long
course of time by nature's power of selection.
<P>
<H4>Extinction</H4> 
<P>
This subject will be more
fully discussed in our chapter on Geology; but it must be here alluded
to from being intimately connected with natural selection. Natural
selection acts solely through the preservation of variations in some
way advantageous, which consequently endure. But as from the high
geometrical powers of increase of all organic beings, each area is
already fully stocked with inhabitants, it follows that as each
selected and favoured form increases in number, so will the less
favoured forms decrease and become rare. Rarity, as geology tells us,
is the precursor to extinction. We can, also, see that any form
represented by few individuals will, during fluctuations in the
seasons or in the number of its enemies, run a good chance of utter
extinction. But we may go further than this; for as new forms are
continually and slowly being produced, unless we believe that the
number of specific forms goes on perpetually and almost indefinitely
increasing, numbers inevitably must become extinct. That the number of
specific forms has not indefinitely  increased, geology
shows us plainly; and indeed we can see reason why they should not
have thus increased, for the number of places in the polity of nature
is not indefinitely great,   not that we 
have any means of
knowing that any one region has as yet got its maximum of species.
probably no region is as yet fully stocked, for at the Cape of Good
Hope, where more species of plants are crowded together than in any
other quarter of the world, some foreign plants have become
naturalised, without causing, as far as we know, the extinction of any
natives.
<P>
Furthermore, the species which are most numerous in individuals
will have the best chance of producing within any given period
favourable variations. We have evidence of this, in the facts given in
the second chapter, showing that it is the common species which afford
the greatest number of recorded varieties, or incipient species.
Hence, rare species will be less quickly modified or improved within
any given period, and they will consequently be beaten in the race for
life by the modified descendants of the commoner species.
<P>
From these several considerations I think it inevitably follows,
that as new species in the course of time are formed through natural
selection, others will become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct.
The forms which stand in closest competition with those undergoing
modification and improvement, will naturally suffer most. And we have
seen in the chapter on the Struggle for Existence that it is the most
closely-allied forms,   varieties of the same species, and
species of the same genus or of related genera,   which, from
having nearly the same structure, constitution, and habits, generally
come into the severest competition with each other. Consequently, each
new variety or species, during the progress of its formation, will
generally press hardest on its nearest kindred, and tend to
exterminate them. We see the same process of extermination amongst our
domesticated productions, through the selection of improved forms by
man. Many curious 
instances could be given showing how quickly new
breeds of cattle, sheep, and other animals, and varieties of flowers,
take the place of older and inferior kinds. In Yorkshire, it is
historically known that the ancient black cattle were displaced by the
long-horns, and that these 'were swept  away by the
short-horns' (I quote the words of an agricultural writer) 'as if by
some murderous pestilence.'
<P>
<H4>Divergence of Character</H4> 
<P>
The principle,
which I have designated by this term, is of high importance on my
theory, and explains, as I believe, several important facts.  In the
first place, varieties, even strongly-marked ones, though having
somewhat of the character of species   as is shown by the
hopeless doubts in many cases how to rank them   yet certainly
differ from each other far less than do good and distinct species.
Nevertheless, according to my view, varieties are species in the
process of formation, or are, as I have called them, incipient species.
How, then, does the lesser difference between varieties become
augmented into the greater difference between species? That this does
habitually happen, we must infer from most of the innumerable species
throughout nature presenting well-marked differences; whereas
varieties, the supposed prototypes and parents of future well-marked
species, present slight and ill-defined differences. Mere chance, as
we may call it, might cause one variety to differ in some character
from its parents, and the offspring of this variety again to differ
from its parent in the very same character and in a greater degree;
but this alone would never account for so habitual and large an amount
of difference as that between varieties of the same species and
species of the same genus.
<P>
As has always been my practice, let us seek light on 
this head from
our domestic productions. We shall here find something analogous. A
fancier is struck by a pigeon having a slightly shorter beak; another
fancier is struck by a pigeon having a rather longer beak; and on the
acknowledged principle that 'fanciers do not and will not admire a
medium standard, but like extremes,' they both go on (as has actually
occurred with tumbler-pigeons) choosing and breeding from birds with
longer and longer beaks, or with shorter and shorter beaks. Again, we
may suppose that at an early period one man preferred swifter horses;
another stronger and more bulky horses. The early differences would be
very slight; in the course of time, from the continued selection of
swifter horses by some breeders, and of stronger ones by others, the
differences would become greater, and would be noted as forming two
sub-breeds; finally, after the lapse of centuries, the sub-breeds
would become converted into two well-established and distinct breeds.
As the differences slowly become greater, the inferior animals with
intermediate characters, being neither very swift nor very strong,
will have been neglected, and will have tended to disappear. Here,
then, we see in man's productions the action of what may be called the
principle of divergence, causing differences, at first barely
appreciable, steadily to increase, and the breeds to diverge in
character both from each other and from their common parent.
<P>
 But how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in
nature? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the
simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any
one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much
will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified
places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in
numbers.
<P>
 We can clearly see this in the case of animals with simple
habits. Take the case of a carnivorous quadruped, of which the number
that can be supported in any country has long ago arrived at its full
average. If its natural powers of increase be allowed to act, it can
succeed in increasing (the country not undergoing any change in its
conditions) only by its varying descendants seizing on places at
present occupied by other animals: some of them, for instance, being
enabled to feed on new kinds of prey, either dead or alive; some
inhabiting new stations, climbing trees, frequenting water, and some
perhaps becoming less carnivorous. The more diversified in habits and
structure the descendants of our carnivorous animal became, the more
places they would be enabled to occupy. What applies to one animal
will apply throughout all time to all animals   that is, if they
vary   for otherwise natural selection can do nothing. So it
will be with plants. It has been experimentally proved, that if a plot
of ground be sown with several distinct genera of grasses, a greater
number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage can thus be
raised. The same has been found to hold good when first one 
 variety and then
several mixed varieties of wheat have been sown on equal spaces of
ground. Hence, if any one species of grass were to go on varying, and
those varieties were continually selected which differed from each
other in at all the same manner as distinct species and genera of
grasses differ from each other, a greater number of individual plants
of this species of grass, including its modified descendants, would
succeed in living on the same piece of ground. And we well know that
each species and each variety of grass is annually sowing almost
countless seeds; and thus, as it may be said, is striving its utmost
to increase its numbers.  Consequently, I cannot doubt that in the
course of many thousands of generations, the most distinct varieties
of any one species of grass would always have the best chance of
succeeding and of increasing in numbers, and thus of supplanting the
less distinct varieties; and varieties, when rendered very distinct
from each other, take the rank of species.
<P>
The truth of the principle, that the
greatest amount of life can be supported by great diversification of
structure, is seen under many natural circumstances.  In an extremely
small area, especially if freely open to immigration, and where the
contest between individual and individual must be severe, we always
find great diversity in its inhabitants. For instance, I found that a
piece of turf, three feet by four in size, which had been exposed for
many years to exactly the same conditions, supported twenty species of
plants, and these belonged to eighteen genera and to eight orders,
which shows how much these plants differed from each other. So it is
with the plants and insects on small and uniform islets; and so in
small ponds of fresh water. Farmers find that they can raise most food
by a rotation of plants belonging to the most different orders: nature
follows what may be called a simultaneous rotation.  Most of the
animals and plants which live close round any small piece of ground,
could live on it (supposing it not to be in any way peculiar in its
nature), and may be said to be striving to the utmost to live there;
but, it is seen, that where they come into the closest competition
with each other, the advantages of diversification of structure, with
the accompanying differences of habit and constitution, determine that
the inhabitants, which thus jostle each other most 
closely, shall, as a general rule, belong to what we call different
genera and orders.
<P>
The same principle is seen in the naturalisation of 
plants through
man's agency in foreign lands. It might have been expected that the
plants which have succeeded in becoming naturalised in any land would
generally have been closely allied to the indigenes; for these are
commonly looked at as specially created and adapted for their own
country. It might, also, perhaps have been expected that naturalised
plants would have belonged to a few groups more especially adapted to
certain stations in their new homes.  But the case is very different;
and Alph. De Candolle has well remarked in his great and admirable
work, that floras gain by naturalisation, proportionally with the
number of the native genera and species, far more in new genera than
in new species. To give a single instance:
in the last edition of Dr Asa Gray's 'Manual of the Flora of the
Northern United States,' 260 naturalised plants are enumerated, and
these belong to 162 genera. We thus see that these naturalised plants
are of a highly diversified nature.  They differ, moreover, to a large
extent from the indigenes, for out of the 162 genera, no less than 100
genera are not there indigenous, and thus a large proportional
addition is made to the genera of these States.
<P>
By considering the nature of the plants or animals which have
struggled successfully with the indigenes of any country, and have
there become naturalised, we can gain some crude idea in what manner
some of the natives would have had to be modified, in order to have
gained an advantage over the other natives; and we may, I think, at
least safely infer that diversification of structure, amounting to new
generic differences, would have been profitable to them.
<P>
The advantage of diversification in the inhabitants of the same
region is, in fact, the same as that of the physiological division of
labour in the organs of the same individual body   a subject so
well elucidated by 
Milne Edwards. No physiologist doubts that a
stomach by being adapted to digest vegetable matter alone, or flesh
alone, draws most nutriment from these substances. So in the general
economy of any land, the more widely and perfectly the animals and
plants are diversified for different habits of life,  so
will a greater number of individuals be capable of there supporting
themselves. A set of animals, with their organisation but little
diversified, could hardly compete with a set more perfectly
diversified in structure. It may be doubted, for instance, whether the
Australian marsupials, which are divided into groups differing but
little from each other, and feebly representing, as Mr Waterhouse and
others have remarked, our carnivorous, ruminant, and rodent mammals,
could successfully compete with these well-pronounced orders. In the
Australian mammals, we see the process of diversification in an early
and incomplete stage of development.
<P>
After the foregoing discussion, which ought to have been much
amplified, we may, I think, assume that the modified descendants of
any one species will succeed by so much the better as they become more
diversified in structure, and are thus enabled to encroach on places
occupied by other beings.  Now let us see how this principle of great
benefit being derived from divergence of character, combined with the
principles of natural selection and of extinction, will tend to act.
<P>
The accompanying diagram will aid us in
understanding this rather perplexing subject. Let A to L represent the
species of a genus large in its own country; these species are
supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees, as is so generally
the case in nature, and as is represented in the diagram by the
letters standing at unequal distances. I have said a large genus,
because we have seen in the second chapter, 
that on an average more of
the species of large genera vary than of small genera; and the varying
species of the large genera present a greater number of varieties. We
have, also, seen that the species, which are the commonest and the
most widely-diffused, vary more than rare species with restricted
ranges. Let (A) be a common, widely-diffused, and varying species,
belonging to a genus large in its own country. The little fan of
diverging dotted lines of unequal lengths proceeding from (A), may
represent its varying offspring. The variations are supposed to be
extremely slight, but of the most diversified nature; they are not
supposed all to appear simultaneously, but often after long intervals
of time; nor are they all supposed to endure for equal periods.  Only
those  variations which are in some way profitable will be
preserved or naturally selected. And here the importance of the
principle of benefit being derived from divergence of character comes
in; for this will generally lead to the most different or divergent
variations (represented by the outer dotted lines) being preserved and
accumulated by natural selection. When a dotted line reaches one of
the horizontal lines, and is there marked by a small numbered letter,
a sufficient amount of variation is supposed to have been accumulated
to have formed a fairly well-marked variety, such as would be thought
worthy of record in a systematic work.
<P>
The intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram, may
represent each a thousand generations; but it would have been better
if each had represented ten thousand generations. After a thousand
generations, species (A) is supposed to have produced two fairly
well-marked varieties, namely <I>a</I>1 and <I>m</I>1. These two varieties will
generally continue to be exposed to the same conditions which made
their parents variable, and the tendency to variability is in itself
hereditary, consequently they will tend to vary, and generally to vary
in nearly the same manner as their parents varied. Moreover, these two
varieties, being only slightly modified forms, will tend to inherit
those advantages which made their common parent (A) more numerous than
most of the other inhabitants of the same country; they will likewise
partake of those more general advantages which made the genus to which
the parent-species belonged, a large genus in its own country. And
these circumstances we know to be favourable to the production of new
varieties.
<P>
If, then, these two varieties be variable, the most divergent of
their variations will generally be preserved during the next thousand
generations. And after this interval, variety 
<I>a</I>1 is
supposed in the diagram to have produced variety
<I>a</I>2, which will, owing to the
principle of divergence, differ more from (A) than did variety 
<I>a</I>1. 
Variety <I>m</I>1 is supposed to have
produced two varieties, namely <I>m</I>
2 and <I>s</I>2,
differing from each other, and more
considerably from their common parent (A). We may continue the process
by similar steps for any length of time; some of the varieties, after
each thousand generations, producing only a  single
variety, but in a more and more modified condition, some producing two
or three varieties, and some failing to produce any. Thus the
varieties or modified descendants, proceeding from the common parent
(A), will generally go on increasing in number and diverging in
character. In the diagram the process is represented up to the
ten-thousandth generation, and under a condensed and simplified form
up to the fourteen-thousandth generation.
<P>
But I must here remark that I do not suppose that the process ever goes
on so regularly as is represented in the diagram, though in itself
made somewhat irregular. 
I am far from thinking that the most
divergent varieties will invariably prevail and multiply: a medium
form may often long endure, and may or may not produce more than one
modified descendant; for natural selection will always act according
to the nature of the places which are either unoccupied or not
perfectly occupied by other beings; and this will depend on infinitely
complex relations. But as a general rule, the more diversified in
structure the descendants from any one species can be rendered, the
more places they will be enabled to seize on, and the more their
modified progeny will be increased. In our diagram the line of
succession is broken at regular intervals by small numbered letters
marking the successive forms which have become sufficiently distinct
to be recorded as varieties.  But these breaks are imaginary, and
might have been inserted anywhere, after intervals long enough to have
allowed the accumulation of a considerable amount of divergent
variation.
<P>
As all the modified descendants from a common and widely-diffused
species, belonging to a large genus, will tend to partake of the same
advantages which made their parent successful in life, they will
generally go on multiplying in number as well as diverging in
character: this is represented in the diagram by the several divergent
branches proceeding from (A). The modified offspring from the later
and more highly improved branches in the lines of descent, will, it is
probable, often take the place of, and so destroy, the earlier and
less improved branches: this is represented in the diagram by some of
the lower branches not reaching to the upper horizontal lines. In some
cases I do not  doubt that the process of modification
will be confined to a single line of descent, and the number of the
descendants will not be increased; although the amount 
of divergent
modification may have been increased in the successive generations.
This case would be represented in the diagram, if all the lines
proceeding from (A) were removed, excepting that from
<I>a1</I> to 
<I>a10</I>
In the same way, for instance, the English race-horse and English
pointer have apparently both gone on slowly diverging in character
from their original stocks, without either having given off any fresh
branches or races.
<P>
After ten thousand generations, species (A) is supposed to have
produced three forms, <I>a</I>10,
<I>f</I>10,
and <I>m10</I>, 
which, from having diverged in character
during the successive generations, will have come to differ largely,
but perhaps unequally, from each other and from their common parent.
If we suppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in our
diagram to be excessively small, these three forms may still be only
well-marked varieties; or they may have arrived at the doubtful
category of sub-species; but we have only to suppose the steps in the
process of modification to be more numerous or greater in amount, to
convert these three forms into well-defined species: thus the diagram
illustrates the steps by which the small differences distinguishing
varieties are increased into the larger differences distinguishing
species.  By continuing the same process for a greater number of
generations (as shown in the diagram in a condensed and simplified
manner), we get eight species, marked by the letters between 
<I>a</I>14 and 
<I>m</I>14, all descended from (A).
Thus, as I believe, species are multiplied and genera are formed.
<P>
In a large genus it is probable that more than one species would
vary. In the diagram I have assumed that a second species (I) has
produced, by analogous steps, after ten thousand generations, either
two well-marked varieties (<I>w</I>10 and <I>z</I>10) or two species, according to the amount of change
supposed to be represented between the horizontal lines. After
fourteen thousand generations, six new species, marked by the letters
<I>n</I>14 to <I>z</I>14, are supposed to have been
produced. In each genus, the species, which are already extremely
different in character, will generally tend to produce the greatest
number of modified descendants; for  these will have the
best chance of filling new and widely different places in the polity
of nature: hence in the diagram I have chosen the extreme species (A),
and the nearly extreme species (I), as those which have largely
varied, and have given rise to new varieties and species.  The other
nine species (marked by capital letters) of our original genus, may
for a long period continue transmitting unaltered descendants; and
this is shown in the diagram by the dotted lines not prolonged far
upwards from want of space.
<P>
But during the process of modification, represented in the diagram,
another of our principles, namely that of extinction, will have played
an important part. As in each fully stocked country natural selection
necessarily acts by the selected form having some advantage in the
struggle for life over other forms, there will be a constant tendency
in the improved descendants of any one species to supplant and
exterminate in each stage of descent their predecessors and their
original parent. For it should be remembered that the competition will
generally be most severe between those forms which are most nearly
related to each other in habits, constitution, and structure. Hence
all the intermediate forms between the earlier and later states, that
is between the less and more improved state of a species, as well as
the original parent-species itself, will generally tend to become
extinct. So it probably will be with many whole collateral lines of
descent, which will be conquered by later and improved lines of
descent. If, however, the 
modified offspring of a species get into
some distinct country, or become quickly adapted to some quite new
station, in which child and parent do not come into competition, both
may continue to exist.
<P>
If then our diagram be assumed to represent a considerable amount
of modification, species (A) and all the earlier varieties will have
become extinct, having been replaced by eight new species (<I>a</I>14
to <I>m</I>14); and (I) will have been replaced by six (<I>n</I>14
to <I>z</I>14) new species.
<P>
But we may go further than this. The original species of our genus
were supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees, as is so
generally the case in nature; species (A) being more nearly related to
B, C, and D, than to the other species; and  species (I)
more to G, H, K, L, than to the others. These two species (A) and (I),
were also supposed to be very common and widely diffused species, so
that they must originally have had some advantage over most of the
other species of the genus. Their modified descendants, fourteen in
number at the fourteen-thousandth generation, will probably have
inherited some of the same advantages: they have also been modified
and improved in a diversified manner at each stage of descent, so as
to have become adapted to many related places in the natural economy
of their country. It seems, therefore, to me extremely probable that
they will have taken the places of, and thus exterminated, not only
their parents (A) and (I), but likewise some of the original species
which were most nearly related to their parents.  Hence very few of
the original species will have transmitted offspring to the
fourteen-thousandth generation. We may suppose that only one (F), of
the two species which were least closely related to the other nine
original species, has transmitted descendants to this late stage of
descent.
<P>
The new species in our diagram descended from the original eleven
species, will now be fifteen in number.  Owing to the divergent
tendency of natural selection, the extreme amount of difference in
character between species <I>a</I>14 and <I>z</I>14 will be much greater than that between the most
different of the original eleven species. The new species, moreover,
will be allied to each other in a widely different manner. Of the
eight descendants from (A) the three marked <I>a</I>14, <I>q</I>14,
<I>p</I>14, will be nearly related
from having recently branched off from <I>a</I>14; <I>b</I>14
and <I>f</I>14, from having
diverged at an earlier period from <I>a</I>5, will be in some degree distinct from the three
first-named species; and lastly, <I>o</I>14, <I>e</I>14,
and <I>m</I>14, will be nearly
related one to the other, but from having diverged at the first
commencement of the process of modification, will be widely different
from the other five species, and may constitute a sub-genus or even a
distinct genus.  The six descendants from <I>(I)</I> will form two sub-genera or even genera. But
as the original species (I) differed largely from (A), standing nearly
at the extreme points of the original genus, the six descendants from
(I) will, owing to inheritance, differ considerably from the eight
descendants from (A); the two groups,  moreover, are
supposed to have gone on diverging in different directions. The
intermediate species, also (and this is a very important
consideration), which connected the original species (A) and (I), have
all become, excepting (F), extinct, and have left no descendants.
Hence the six new species descended from (I), and the eight descended
from (A), will have to be ranked as very distinct genera, or even as
distinct sub-families.
<P>
Thus it is, as I believe, that two or more genera are produced by
descent, with modification, from two or more species of the same
genus. And the two or 
more parent-species are supposed to have
descended from some one species of an earlier genus. In our diagram,
this is indicated by the broken lines, beneath the capital letters,
converging in sub-branches downwards towards a single point; this
point representing a single species, the supposed single parent of our
several new sub-genera and genera.
<P>
It is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the
new species F14, which is supposed not to have
diverged much in character, but to have retained the form of (F),
either unaltered or altered only in a slight degree. In this case, its
affinities to the other fourteen new species will be of a curious and
circuitous nature.  Having descended from a form which stood between
the two parent-species (A) and (I), now supposed to be extinct and
unknown, it will be in some degree intermediate in character between
the two groups descended from these species. But as these two groups
have gone on diverging in character from the type of their parents,
the new species (F14) will not be directly
intermediate between them, but rather between types of the two groups;
and every naturalist will be able to bring some such case before his
mind.
<P>
In the diagram, each horizontal line has hitherto been supposed to
represent a thousand generations, but each may represent a million or
hundred million generations, and likewise a section of the successive
strata of the earth's crust including extinct remains. We shall, when
we come to our chapter on Geology, have to refer again to this
subject, and I think we shall then see that the diagram throws light on
the affinities of extinct beings, which, though generally belonging to
the same orders, or families, or genera, with those now living, yet
are often, in  some degree, intermediate in character
between existing groups; and we can understand this fact, for 
the
extinct species lived at very ancient epochs when the branching lines
of descent had diverged less.
<P>
I see no reason to limit the process of modification, as now
explained, to the formation of genera alone. If, in our diagram, we
suppose the amount of change represented by each successive group of
diverging dotted lines to be very great, the forms marked <I>a214 to p</I>14, those marked <I>b</I>14 and <I>f</I>14, and those marked <I>o</I>14 to <I>m</I>14, will form three very distinct genera. We shall also
have two very distinct genera descended from (I) and as these latter
two genera, both from continued divergence of character and from
inheritance from a different parent, will differ widely from the three
genera descended from (A), the two little groups of genera will form
two distinct families, or even orders, according to the amount of
divergent modification supposed to be represented in the diagram. And
the two new families, or orders, will have descended from two species
of the original genus; and these two species are supposed to have
descended from one species of a still more ancient and unknown genus.
<P>
We have seen that in each country it is the species of the larger
genera which oftenest present varieties or incipient species. This,
indeed, might have been expected; for as natural selection acts
through one form having some advantage over other forms in the
struggle for existence, it will chiefly act on those which already
have some advantage; and the largeness of any group shows that its
species have inherited from a common ancestor some advantage in
common.  Hence, the struggle for the production of new and modified
descendants, will mainly lie between the larger groups, which are all
trying to increase in number. One large group will slowly conquer
another large group, reduce its numbers, and thus lessen its chance of
further variation and improvement. Within the same large 
group, the
later and more highly perfected sub-groups, from branching out and
seizing on many new places in the polity of Nature, will constantly
tend to supplant and destroy the earlier and less improved sub-groups.
Small and broken groups and sub-groups will finally tend to disappear.
Looking to the future, we can predict that the groups of 
organic beings which are now large and triumphant, and which are least
broken up, that is, which as yet have suffered least extinction, will
for a long period continue to increase. But which groups will
ultimately prevail, no man can predict; for we well know that many
groups, formerly most extensively developed, have now become extinct.
Looking still more remotely to the future, we may predict that, owing
to the continued and steady increase of the larger groups, a multitude
of smaller groups will become utterly extinct, and leave no modified
descendants; and consequently that of the species living at any one
period, extremely few will transmit descendants to a remote futurity.
I shall have to return to this subject in the chapter on
Classification, but I may add that on this view of extremely few of
the more ancient species having transmitted descendants, and on the
view of all the descendants of the same species making a class, we can
understand how it is that there exist but very few classes in each
main division of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Although extremely
few of the most ancient species may now have living and modified
descendants, yet at the most remote geological period, the earth may
have been as well peopled with many species of many genera, families,
orders, and classes, as at the present day.
<P>
<H4>Summary of Chapter</H4> 
<P>
 If during the long
course of ages and under varying conditions of life, organic beings
vary at all in the several parts of their organisation, and I think this
cannot be disputed; if there be, owing to the high geometrical powers
of increase of each species, at some age, season, or year, a severe
struggle for life, and this certainly cannot be disputed; then,
considering the infinite complexity of the relations of all organic
beings to each other and to their conditions of existence, causing an
infinite diversity in structure, constitution, and habits, to be
advantageous to them, I think it would be a most extraordinary fact if
no variation ever had occurred useful to each being's own welfare, in
the same way as so many variations have occurred useful to man. But if
variations useful to any organic being do occur, assuredly individuals
thus characterised will have the best chance of being preserved in the
struggle for life; and from  the strong principle of
inheritance they will tend to produce offspring similarly
characterised. This principle of preservation, I have called, for the
sake of brevity, Natural Selection. Natural selection, on the
principle of qualities being inherited at corresponding ages, can
modify the egg, seed, or young, as easily as the adult. Amongst many
animals, sexual selection will give its aid to ordinary selection, by
assuring to the most vigorous and best adapted males the greatest
number of offspring. Sexual selection will also give characters useful
to the males alone, in their struggles with other males.
<P>
Whether natural selection has really thus acted in nature, in
modifying and adapting the various forms of life to their several
conditions and stations, must be judged of by the general tenour and
balance of evidence given in the following chapters. But we already
see how it entails extinction; and how largely extinction has acted in
the world's history, geology plainly declares. Natural selection,
also, leads to divergence of 
character; for more living beings can be
supported on the same area the more they diverge in structure, habits,
and constitution, of which we see proof by looking at the inhabitants
of any small spot or at naturalised productions. Therefore during the
modification of the descendants of any one species, and during the
incessant struggle of all species to increase in numbers, the more
diversified these descendants become, the better will be their
chance of succeeding in the battle of life. Thus the small differences
distinguishing varieties of the same species, will steadily tend to
increase till they come to equal the greater differences between
species of the same genus, or even of distinct genera.
<P>
We have seen that it is the common, the widely-diffused, and
widely-ranging species, belonging to the larger genera, which vary
most; and these will tend to transmit to their modified offspring
that superiority which now makes them dominant in their own countries.
Natural selection, as has just been remarked, leads to divergence of
character and to much extinction of the less improved and intermediate
forms of life. On these principles, I believe, the nature of the
affinities of all organic beings may be explained. It is a truly
wonderful fact   the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from
familiarity   that all  animals and all plants
throughout all time and space should be related to each other in group
subordinate to group, in the manner which we everywhere behold  
namely, varieties of the same species most closely related together,
species of the same genus less closely and unequally related together,
forming sections and sub-genera, species of distinct genera much less
closely related, and genera related in different degrees, forming
sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes, and classes. The several
subordinate groups in any class cannot be 
ranked in a single file, but
seem rather to be clustered round points, and these round other
points, and so on in almost endless cycles. On the view that each
species has been independently created, I can see no explanation of
this great fact in the classification of all organic beings; but, to
the best of my judgment, it is explained through inheritance and the
complex action of natural selection, entailing extinction and
divergence of character, as we have seen illustrated in the diagram.
<P>
The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes
been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks
the truth. The green and budding twigs may represent existing species;
and those produced during each former year may represent the long
succession of extinct species. At each period of growth all the
growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop
and kill the surrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as
species and groups of species have tried to overmaster other species
in the great battle for life. The limbs divided into great branches,
and these into lesser and lesser branches, were themselves once, when
the tree was small, budding twigs; and this connexion of the former
and present buds by ramifying branches may well represent the
classification of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate
to groups. Of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere
bush, only two or three, now grown into great branches, yet survive
and bear all the other branches; so with the species which lived
during long-past geological periods, very few now have living and
modified descendants. From the first growth of the tree, many a limb
and branch has decayed and dropped off; and these lost branches of
various sizes may represent those  whole orders, families,
and genera which have now no living representatives, and 
which are
known to us only from having been found in a fossil state. As we here
and there see a thin straggling branch springing from a fork low down
in a tree, and which by some chance has been favoured and is still
alive on its summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the
Ornithorhynchus or Lepidosiren, which in some small degree connects by
its affinities two large branches of life, and which has apparently
been saved from fatal competition by having inhabited a protected
station. As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if
vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch,
so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life,
which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth,
and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful
ramifications.
