They decided to go to Switzerland at the session's end.  "We'll
clean up everything tidy," said Capes. . . .
<P>
For her pride's sake, and to save herself from long day-dreams
and an unappeasable longing for her lover, Ann Veronica worked
hard at her biology during those closing weeks.  She was, as
Capes had said, a hard young woman.  She was keenly resolved to
do well in the school examination, and not to be drowned in the
seas of emotion that threatened to submerge her intellectual
being.
<P>
Nevertheless, she could not prevent a rising excitement as the
dawn of the new life drew near to her--a thrilling of the nerves,
a secret and delicious exaltation above the common circumstances
of existence.  Sometimes her straying mind would become
astonishingly active--embroidering bright and decorative things
that she could say to Capes; sometimes it passed into a state of
passive acquiescence, into a radiant, formless, golden joy.  She
was aware of people--her aunt, her father, her fellow-students,
friends, and neighbors--moving about outside this glowing secret,
very much as an actor is aware of the dim audience beyond the
barrier of the footlights.  They might applaud, or object, or
interfere, but the drama was her very own.  She was going through
with that, anyhow.
<P>
The feeling of last days grew stronger with her as their number
diminished.  She went about the familiar home with a clearer and
clearer sense of inevitable conclusions. She became exceptionally
considerate and affectionate with her father and aunt, and more
and more concerned about the coming catastrophe that she was
about to precipitate upon them.  Her aunt had a once exasperating
habit of interrupting her work with demands for small household
services, but now Ann Veronica rendered them with a queer
readiness of anticipatory propitiation. She was greatly exercised
by the problem of confiding in the Widgetts; they were dears, and
she talked away two evenings with Constance without broaching the
topic; she made some vague intimations in letters to Miss Miniver
that Miss Miniver failed to mark.  But she did not bother her
head very much about her relations with these sympathizers.
<P>
And at length her penultimate day in Morningside Park dawned for
her.  She got up early, and walked about the garden in the dewy
June sunshine and revived her childhood.  She was saying good-bye
to childhood and home, and her making; she was going out into the
great, multitudinous world; this time there would be no
returning.  She was at the end of girlhood and on the eve of a
woman's crowning experience.  She visited the corner that had
been her own little garden--her forget-me-nots and candytuft had
long since been elbowed into insignificance by weeds; she visited
the raspberry-canes that had sheltered that first love affair
with the little boy in velvet, and the greenhouse where she had
been wont to read her secret letters.  Here was the place behind
the shed where she had used to hide from Roddy's persecutions,
and here the border of herbaceous perennials under whose stems
was fairyland.  The back of the house had been the Alps for
climbing, and the shrubs in front of it a Terai.  The knots and
broken pale that made the garden-fence scalable, and gave access
to the fields behind, were still to be traced.  And here against
a wall were the plum-trees.  In spite of God and wasps and her
father, she had stolen plums; and once because of discovered
misdeeds, and once because she had realized that her mother was
dead, she had lain on her face in the unmown grass, beneath the
elm-trees that came beyond the vegetables, and poured out her
soul in weeping.
<P>
Remote little Ann Veronica!  She would never know the heart of
that child again!  That child had loved fairy princes with velvet
suits and golden locks, and she was in love with a real man named
Capes, with little gleams of gold on his cheek and a pleasant
voice and firm and shapely hands.  She was going to him soon and
certainly, going to his strong, embracing arms.  She was going
through a new world with him side by side. She had been so busy
with life that, for a vast gulf of time, as it seemed, she had
given no thought to those ancient, imagined things of her
childhood.  Now, abruptly, they were real again, though very
distant, and she had come to say farewell to them across one
sundering year.
<P>
She was unusually helpful at breakfast, and unselfish about the
eggs: and then she went off to catch the train before her
father's.  She did this to please him.  He hated travelling
second-class with her--indeed, he never did--but he also disliked
travelling in the same train when his daughter was in an inferior
class, because of the look of the thing.  So he liked to go by a
different train.  And in the Avenue she had an encounter with
Ramage.
<P>
It was an odd little encounter, that left vague and dubitable
impressions in her mind.  She was aware of him--a silk-hatted,
shiny-black figure on the opposite side of the Avenue; and then,
abruptly and startlingly, he crossed the road and saluted and
spoke to her.
<P>
"I MUST speak to you," he said.  "I can't keep away from you."
<P>
She made some inane response.  She was struck by a change in his
appearance.  His eyes looked a little bloodshot to her; his face
had lost something of its ruddy freshness.
<P>
He began a jerky, broken conversation that lasted until they
reached the station, and left her puzzled at its drift and
meaning.  She quickened her pace, and so did he, talking at her
slightly averted ear.  She made lumpish and inadequate
interruptions rather than replies.  At times he seemed to be
claiming pity from her; at times he was threatening her with her
check and exposure; at times he was boasting of his inflexible
will, and how, in the end, he always got what he wanted. He said
that his life was boring and stupid without her. Something or
other--she did not catch what--he was damned if he could stand. 
He was evidently nervous, and very anxious to be impressive; his
projecting eyes sought to dominate.  The crowning aspect of the
incident, for her mind, was the discovery that he and her
indiscretion with him no longer mattered very much. Its
importance had vanished with her abandonment of compromise.  Even
her debt to him was a triviality now.
<P>
And of course!  She had a brilliant idea.  It surprised her she
hadn't thought of it before!  She tried to explain that she was
going to pay him forty pounds without fail next week.  She said
as much to him.  She repeated this breathlessly.
<P>
"I was glad you did not send it back again," he said.
<P>
He touched a long-standing sore, and Ann Veronica found herself
vainly trying to explain--the inexplicable. "It's because I mean
to send it back altogether," she said.
<P>
He ignored her protests in order to pursue some impressive line
of his own.
<P>
"Here we are, living in the same suburb," he began. "We have to
be--modern."
<P>
Her heart leaped within her as she caught that phrase.  That knot
also would be cut.  Modern, indeed!  She was going to be as
primordial as chipped flint.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 2
<P>
<P>
In the late afternoon, as Ann Veronica was gathering flowers for
the dinner-table, her father came strolling across the lawn
toward her with an affectation of great deliberation.
<P>
"I want to speak to you about a little thing, Vee," said Mr.
Stanley.
<P>
Ann Veronica's tense nerves started, and she stood still with her
eyes upon him, wondering what it might be that impended.
<P>
"You were talking to that fellow Ramage to-day--in the Avenue. 
Walking to the station with him."
<P>
So that was it!
<P>
"He came and talked to me."
<P>
"Ye--e--es.  "Mr. Stanley considered.  "Well, I don't want you to
talk to him," he said, very firmly.
<P>
Ann Veronica paused before she answered.  "Don't you think I
ought to?" she asked, very submissively.
<P>
"No."  Mr. Stanley coughed and faced toward the house.  "He is
not-- I don't like him.  I think it inadvisable-- I don't want an
intimacy to spring up between you and a man of that type."
<P>
Ann Veronica reflected.  "I HAVE--had one or two talks with him,
daddy."
<P>
"Don't let there be any more.  I-- In fact, I dislike him
extremely."
<P>
"Suppose he comes and talks to me?"
<P>
"A girl can always keep a man at a distance if she cares to do
it.  She-- She can snub him."
<P>
Ann Veronica picked a cornflower.
<P>
"I wouldn't make this objection," Mr. Stanley went on, "but there
are things--there are stories about Ramage.  He's--He lives in a
world of possibilities outside your imagination.  His treatment
of his wife is most unsatisfactory.  Most unsatisfactory.  A bad
man, in fact.  A dissipated, loose-living man."
<P>
"I'll try not to see him again," said Ann Veronica. "I didn't
know you objected to him, daddy."
<P>
"Strongly," said Mr. Stanley, "very strongly."
<P>
The conversation hung.  Ann Veronica wondered what her father
would do if she were to tell him the full story of her relations
with Ramage.
<P>
"A man like that taints a girl by looking at her, by his mere
conversation."  He adjusted his glasses on his nose.  There was
another little thing he had to say. "One has to be so careful of
one's friends and acquaintances," he remarked, by way of
transition.  "They mould one insensibly."  His voice assumed an
easy detached tone.  "I suppose, Vee, you don't see much of those
Widgetts now?"
<P>
"I go in and talk to Constance sometimes."
<P>
"Do you?"
<P>
"We were great friends at school."
<P>
"No doubt. . . .  Still--I don't know whether I quite
like--Something ramshackle about those people, Vee.  While I am
talking about your friends, I feel--I think you ought to know how
I look at it." His voice conveyed studied moderation.  "I don't
mind, of course, your seeing her sometimes, still there are
differences--differences in social atmospheres.  One gets drawn
into things.  Before you know where you are you find yourself in
a complication.  I don't want to influence you
unduly--But--They're artistic people, Vee.  That's the fact about
them.  We're different."
<P>
"I suppose we are," said Vee, rearranging the flowers in her
hand.
<P>
"Friendships that are all very well between school-girls don't
always go on into later life.  It's--it's a social difference."
<P>
"I like Constance very much."
<P>
"No doubt.  Still, one has to be reasonable.  As you admitted to
me--one has to square one's self with the world.  You don't know. 
With people of that sort all sorts of things may happen.  We
don't want things to happen."
<P>
Ann Veronica made no answer.
<P>
A vague desire to justify himself ruffled her father. "I may seem
unduly--anxious.  I can't forget about your sister.  It's that
has always made me--SHE, you know, was drawn into a set--didn't
discriminate Private theatricals."
<P>
Ann Veronica remained anxious to hear more of her sister's story
from her father's point of view, but he did not go on.  Even so
much allusion as this to that family shadow, she felt, was an
immense recognition of her ripening years.  She glanced at him. 
He stood a little anxious and fussy, bothered by the
responsibility of her, entirely careless of what her life was or
was likely to be, ignoring her thoughts and feelings, ignorant of
every fact of importance in her life, explaining everything he
could not understand in her as nonsense and perversity, concerned
only with a terror of bothers and undesirable situations.  "We
don't want things to happen!"  Never had he shown his daughter so
clearly that the womenkind he was persuaded he had to protect and
control could please him in one way, and in one way only, and
that was by doing nothing except the punctual domestic duties and
being nothing except restful appearances.  He had quite enough to
see to and worry about in the City without their doing things. He
had no use for Ann Veronica; he had never had a use for her since
she had been too old to sit upon his knee.  Nothing but the
constraint of social usage now linked him to her.  And the less
"anything" happened the better.  The less she lived, in fact, the
better.  These realizations rushed into Ann Veronica's mind and
hardened her heart against him.  She spoke slowly.  "I may not
see the Widgetts for some little time, father," she said.  "I
don't think I shall."
<P>
"Some little tiff?"
<P>
"No; but I don't think I shall see them."
<P>
Suppose she were to add, "I am going away!"
<P>
"I'm glad to hear you say it," said Mr. Stanley, and was so
evidently pleased that Ann Veronica's heart smote her.
<P>
"I am very glad to hear you say it," he repeated, and refrained
from further inquiry.  "I think we are growing sensible," he
said.  "I think you are getting to understand me better."
<P>
He hesitated, and walked away from her toward the house.  Her
eyes followed him.  The curve of his shoulders, the very angle of
his feet, expressed relief at her apparent obedience.  "Thank
goodness!" said that retreating aspect, "that's said and over. 
Vee's all right.  There's nothing happened at all!"  She didn't
mean, he concluded, to give him any more trouble ever, and he was
free to begin a fresh chromatic novel--he had just finished the
Blue Lagoon, which he thought very beautiful and tender and
absolutely irrelevant to Morningside Park--or work in peace at
his microtome without bothering about her in the least.
<P>
The immense disillusionment that awaited him! The devastating
disillusionment!  She had a vague desire to run after him, to
state her case to him, to wring some understanding from him of
what life was to her.  She felt a cheat and a sneak to his
unsuspecting retreating back.
<P>
"But what can one do?" asked Ann Veronica.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 3
<P>
<P>
She dressed carefully for dinner in a black dress that her father
liked, and that made her look serious and responsible.  Dinner
was quite uneventful.  Her father read a draft prospectus warily,
and her aunt dropped fragments of her projects for managing while
the cook had a holiday.  After dinner Ann Veronica went into the
drawing-room with Miss Stanley, and her father went up to his den
for his pipe and pensive petrography.  Later in the evening she
heard him whistling, poor man!
<P>
She felt very restless and excited.  She refused coffee, though
she knew that anyhow she was doomed to a sleepless night.  She
took up one of her father's novels and put it down again, fretted
up to her own room for some work, sat on her bed and meditated
upon the room that she was now really abandoning forever, and
returned at length with a stocking to darn.  Her aunt was making
herself cuffs out of little slips of insertion under the newly
lit lamp.
<P>
Ann Veronica sat down in the other arm-chair and darned badly for
a minute or so.  Then she looked at her aunt, and traced with a
curious eye the careful arrangement of her hair, her sharp nose,
the little drooping lines of mouth and chin and cheek.
<P>
Her thought spoke aloud.  "Were you ever in love, aunt?" she
asked.
<P>
Her aunt glanced up startled, and then sat very still, with hands
that had ceased to work.  "What makes you ask such a question,
Vee?" she said.
<P>
"I wondered."
<P>
Her aunt answered in a low voice:  "I was engaged to him, dear,
for seven years, and then he died."
<P>
Ann Veronica made a sympathetic little murmur.
<P>
"He was in holy orders, and we were to have been married when he
got a living.  He was a Wiltshire Edmondshaw, a very old family."
<P>
She sat very still.
<P>
Ann Veronica hesitated with a question that had leaped up in her
mind, and that she felt was cruel.  "Are you sorry you waited,
aunt?" she said.
<P>
Her aunt was a long time before she answered.  "His stipend
forbade it," she said, and seemed to fall into a train of
thought.  "It would have been rash and unwise," she said at the
end of a meditation.  "What he had was altogether insufficient."
<P>
Ann Veronica looked at the mildly pensive gray eyes and the
comfortable, rather refined face with a penetrating curiosity. 
Presently her aunt sighed deeply and looked at the clock.  "Time
for my Patience," she said.  She got up, put the neat cuffs she
had made into her work-basket, and went to the bureau for the
little cards in the morocco case.  Ann Veronica jumped up to get
her the card-table.  "I haven't seen the new Patience, dear," she
said.  "May I sit beside you?"
<P>
"It's a very difficult one," said her aunt.  "Perhaps you will
help me shuffle?"
<P>
Ann Veronica did, and also assisted nimbly with the arrangements
of the rows of eight with which the struggle began.  Then she sat
watching the play, sometimes offering a helpful suggestion,
sometimes letting her attention wander to the smoothly shining
arms she had folded across her knees just below the edge of the
table.  She was feeling extraordinarily well that night, so that
the sense of her body was a deep delight, a realization of a
gentle warmth and strength and elastic firmness.  Then she
glanced at the cards again, over which her aunt's many-ringed
hand played, and then at the rather weak, rather plump face that
surveyed its operations.
<P>
It came to Ann Veronica that life was wonderful beyond measure. 
It seemed incredible that she and her aunt were, indeed,
creatures of the same blood, only by a birth or so different
beings, and part of that same broad interlacing stream of human
life that has invented the fauns and nymphs, Astarte, Aphrodite,
Freya, and all the twining beauty of the gods.  The love-songs of
all the ages were singing in her blood, the scent of night stock
from the garden filled the air, and the moths that beat upon the
closed frames of the window next the lamp set her mind dreaming
of kisses in the dusk.  Yet her aunt, with a ringed hand flitting
to her lips and a puzzled, worried look in her eyes, deaf to all
this riot of warmth and flitting desire, was playing
Patience--playing Patience, as if Dionysius and her curate had
died together.  A faint buzz above the ceiling witnessed that
petrography, too, was active.  Gray and tranquil world!  Amazing,
passionless world!  A world in which days without meaning, days
in which "we don't want things to happen" followed days without
meaning--until the last thing happened, the ultimate,
unavoidable, coarse, "disagreeable."  It was her last evening in
that wrappered life against which she had rebelled.  Warm reality
was now so near her she could hear it beating in her ears.  Away
in London even now Capes was packing and preparing; Capes, the
magic man whose touch turned one to trembling fire.  What was he
doing?  What was he thinking?  It was less than a day now, less
than twenty hours.  Seventeen hours, sixteen hours.  She glanced
at the soft-ticking clock with the exposed brass pendulum upon
the white marble mantel, and made a rapid calculation.  To be
exact, it was just sixteen hours and twenty minutes. The slow
stars circled on to the moment of their meeting. The softly
glittering summer stars!  She saw them shining over mountains of
snow, over valleys of haze and warm darkness. . . .  There would
be no moon.
<P>
"I believe after all it's coming out!" said Miss Stanley. "The
aces made it easy."
<P>
Ann Veronica started from her reverie, sat up in her chair,
became attentive.  "Look, dear," she said presently, "you can put
the ten on the Jack."
<P>
