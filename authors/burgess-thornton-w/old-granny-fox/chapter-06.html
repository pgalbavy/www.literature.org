The wisest folks will make mistakes, but<br/>
if they are truly wise they will profit from them.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Old Granny Fox.

</p>
</div>
<p>There is a saying among the little people of the Green Forest
and the Green Meadows which runs something like this:</p>

<p>   "You must your eyes wide open keep    To catch Old Granny
Fox asleep."</p>

<p>Of course this means that Old Granny Fox is so smart, so clever,
so keenly on the watch at all times, that he must be very smart
indeed who fools her or gets ahead of her. Reddy Fox is smart,
very smart. But Reddy isn't nearly as smart as Old Granny Fox.
You see, he hasn't lived nearly as long, so of course there is
much knowledge of many things stored away in Granny's head of
which Reddy knows little.</p>

<p>But once in a while even the smartest people are caught napping.
Yes, Sir, that does happen. They will be careless sometimes. It
was just so with Old Granny Fox. With all her smartness and cleverness
and wisdom she grew careless, and all the smartness and cleverness
and wisdom in the world is useless if the possessor becomes careless.</p>

<p>You see, Old Granny Fox had become so used to thinking that she
was smarter than any one else, unless it was Old Man Coyote, that
she actually believed that no one was smart enough ever to surprise
her. Yes, Sir, she actually believed that. Now, you know when
a person reaches the point of thinking that no one else in all
the Great World is quite so smart, that person is like Peter Rabbit
when he made ready one winter day to jump out on the smooth ice
of the Smiling Pool,&mdash;getting ready for a fall. It was this way
with Old Granny Fox.</p>

<p>Because she had lived near Farmer Brown's so long and had been
hunted so often by Farmer Brown's boy and by Bowser the Hound,
she had got the idea in her head that no matter what she did they
would not be able to catch her. So at last she grew careless.
Yes, Sir, she grew careless. And that is something no Fox or anybody
else can afford to do.</p>

<p>Now on the edge of the Green Forest was a warm, sunny knoll,
which, as you know, is a sort of little hill. It overlooked the
Green Meadows and was quite the most pleasant and comfortable
place for a sun-nap that ever was. At least, that is what Old
Granny Fox thought. She took sun-naps there very often. It was
her favorite resting place. When Bowser the Hound had found her
trail and had chased her until she was tired of running and had
had quite all the exercise she needed or wanted, she would play
one of her clever tricks by which to make Bowser lose her trail.
Then she would hurry straight to that knoll to rest and grin at
her own smartness.</p>

<p>It happened that she did this one day when there was fresh snow
on the ground. Of course, every time she put a foot down she left
a print in the snow. And where she curled up in the sun she left
the print of her body. They were very plain to see, were these
prints, and Farmer Brown's boy saw them.</p>

<p>He had been tramping through the Green Forest late in the afternoon
and just by chance happened across Granny's footprints. Just for
fun he followed them and so came to the sunny knoll. Granny had
left some time before, but of course she couldn't take the print
of her body with her. That remained in the snow, and Farmer Brown's
boy saw it and knew instantly what it meant. He grinned, and could
Granny Fox have seen that grin, she would have been uncomfortable.
You see, he knew that he had found the place where Granny was
in the habit of taking a sun-nap.</p>

<p>"So," said he, "this is the place where you rest, Old Mrs. Fox,
after running Bowser almost off his feet. I think we will give
you a surprise one of these days. Yes, indeed, I think we will
give you a surprise. You have fooled us many times, and now it
is our turn."</p>

<p>The next day Farmer Brown's boy shouldered his terrible gun and
sent Bowser the Hound to hunt for the trail of Old Granny Fox.
It wasn't long before Bowser's great voice told all the Great
World that he had found Granny's tracks. Farmer Brown's boy grinned
just as he had the day before. Then with his terrible gun he went
over to the Green Forest and hid under some pine boughs right
on the edge of that sunny knoll.</p>

<p>He waited patiently a long, long time. He heard Bowser's great
voice growing more and more excited as he followed Old Granny
Fox. By and by Bowser stopped baying and began to yelp impatiently.
Farmer Brown's boy knew exactly what that meant. It meant that
Granny had played one of her smart tricks and Bowser had lost
her trail.</p>

<p>A few minutes later out of the Green Forest came Old Granny Fox,
and she was grinning, for once more she had fooled Bowser the
Hound and now could take a nap in peace. Still grinning, she turned
around two or three times to make herself comfortable and then,
with a sigh of contentment, curled up for a sun-nap, and in a
few minutes was asleep. And just a little way off behind the pine
boughs sat Farmer Brown's boy holding his terrible gun and grinning.
At last he had caught Old Granny Fox napping.</p>
