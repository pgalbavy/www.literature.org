<p>The boys were in no doubt as to the author of this startling
break in the mountain stillness. It was their own burro that had
given out the unearthly roar, and they were confident of being
close upon the trail of the two men who were making off with the
gold. But a moment later, round the corner in front of them, the
donkey's head came into view, his long ears flapping, as if training
themselves for the fight with mosquitoes that would soon come.
The animal was walking slowly, but the astonishing fact immediately
appeared that he was not only without any load on his back, but
was unaccompanied by either Hardman or his confederate.</p>

<p>Suspecting, however, they were close behind him, the boys held
their places, the foremost still on the alert for the criminals.
The burro came forward until within a rod, when he seemed to become
aware for the first time of the presence of the youths in his
path. He halted, twiddled his rabbit-like ears, looked at the
two, and then opened his mouth. The flexible lips fluttered and
vibrated with a second tremendous bray, which rolled back and
forth among the mountains, the wheezing addendum more penetrating
than the first part of the outburst.</p>

<p>As the animal showed a disposition to continue his advance, the
boys stepped aside and he came slowly forward, as if in doubt
whether he was doing a prudent thing; but he kept on, and, passing
both, continued down the trail, evidently anxious to return to
his pasturage.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" asked Roswell.</p>

<p>"I have no idea, unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"They can't make any further use of the burro, and have allowed
him to go home."</p>

<p>"But they can't carry away all the gold."</p>

<p>"Then they are burying it. Let's hurry on, or we shall be too
late."</p>

<p>Lowering his Winchester, Frank led the way up the trail, slackening
his pace as he reached the bend, and partly raising his weapon
again.</p>

<p>Rocks and bowlders were all around, but the trail still showed,
and the donkey could have travelled indefinitely forward, so far
as the boys could see. Nowhere was anything detected of the two
men.</p>

<p>"They may have turned the burro loose a half mile off," said
Frank, chagrined and disappointed beyond expression.</p>

<p>His companion warned him to be careful, as he began pushing forward
at a reckless rate, as if fearful that the men would get away
after all.</p>

<p>Just beyond the point where the burro had appeared the path forked,
each course being equally distinct. The boys scrutinized the ground,
but could not decide from what direction the animal had come.
Had they possessed the patience, they might have settled the question
by kneeling down and making their scrutiny more minute; but Frank
could not wait.</p>

<p>"I'll take the right," he said, "while you follow the left. If
you discover either of them, shoot and shout for me."</p>

<p>It may be doubted whether this was wise counsel, and Roswell
did not feel himself bound by it, but he acted at once upon the
suggestion. His weapon was in his grasp as he hurried over the
path, and the cousins were quickly lost to each other.</p>

<p>The inspiring incentive to both boys was the dread that they
were too late to recover the gold that had been stolen. Since
its weight was too great for a couple of men to carry, the natural
presumption was that they had buried or would bury it in some
secure place, and return when it was safe to take it away.</p>

<p>Because of this, Roswell Palmer sharply scrutinized every part
of his field of vision as it opened before him. There were numerous
breaks in the path which permitted him to look over a space of
several rods, and again he could not see six feet from him.</p>

<p>Reaching an earthy part of the trail, he leaned over and studied
it. There was no sign of a hoof or footprint.</p>

<p>"The burro did not come this far," was his conclusion; "I am
wasting time by wandering from Frank."</p>

<p>He was in doubt whether to turn or to advance farther. He had
paused among the bowlders, where little was visible, and, convinced
of his mistake, he shoved his weapon back in his pocket, so as
to give him the freer use of his hands, and turned back over the
trail along which he had just come.</p>

<p>He had not taken a dozen steps when he was checked by the most
startling summons that could come to him. It was a gruff "Hands
up, younker!"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<em>HANDS UP, YOUNKER</em>!"]</p>

<p>It will be recalled that Roswell was less headstrong than his
cousin, as he now demonstrated by his prompt obedience to the
command, which came from an immense rock at the side of the path,
partly behind him.</p>

<p>Having elevated his hands, the youth turned to look at his master.
One glance at the countenance was sufficient. He was the individual
whom Frank had seen secretly talking with Hardman on the boat
that carried them from the head to the foot of Lake Lindeman,
and whom both had seen on the day of their arrival in this neighborhood.</p>

<p>Roswell Palmer now displayed a quickness of wit that would have
done credit to an older head. His revolver he had placed in a
pocket on the side of him that was turned away from the man, and
it will be remembered that the lad had placed it there before
receiving the peremptory summons to surrender. In the hope that
his captor was not aware that he carried any firearms, Roswell
kept that part of his body farthest from him.</p>

<p>The man was standing at the side of the rock with a similar weapon
in his grasp, and showed that he was elated over the clever manner
in which he had gotten the best of the youth. His own weapon was
not pointed at him, but held so that it could be raised and used
on the instant.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by treating me thus when I am walking peaceably
through the mountains, offering harm to no one?" asked Roswell
with an injured air.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here anyway?" demanded the other, whose unpleasant
face indicated that he did not fully grasp the situation.</p>

<p>"My friend and I set out to look for some men that have stolen
our gold. Have you seen them?"</p>

<p>This sounded as if the boy had no suspicion of the fellow before
him, and taking his cue therefrom, he said:</p>

<p>"No; I don't know anything about it. Did they jump your claim?"</p>

<p>"We had the gold among the rocks where we live, but when we came
home to-day, we found that some persons had been there and taken
it all."</p>

<p>Something seemed to strike the man as very amusing. He broke
into laughter.</p>

<p>"You can put down your hands, my son, if you're getting tired."</p>

<p>"You won't shoot?" asked Roswell in pretended alarm.</p>

<p>"Not much," replied the other, with a laugh; "I haven't a charge
in my weapon nor a single cartridge with me; but all the same,
I'll keep an eye on you."</p>

<p>"Not doubting your word, I have to inform you that my pistol
is loaded, and I now shall take charge of you."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Roswell produced his weapon, and the other was at
his mercy.</p>
