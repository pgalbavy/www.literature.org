<p>A great many people keep their friends in mind by writing to
them, but more do not; and Ward and I belong to the majority.
After my departure from Paris I had but one missive from him,
a short note, written at the request of his sister, asking me
to be on the lookout for Italian earrings, to add to her collection
of old jewels. So, from time to time, I sent her what I could
find about Capri or in Naples, and she responded with neat little
letters of acknowledgment.</p>

<p>Two years I stayed on Capri, eating the lotus which grows on
that happy island, and painting very little&mdash;only enough, indeed,
to be remembered at the Salon and not so much as knowing how kindly
or unkindly they hung my pictures there. But even on Capri, people
sometimes hear the call of Paris and wish to be in that unending
movement: to hear the multitudinous rumble, to watch the procession
from a cafe terrace and to dine at Foyot's. So there came at last
a fine day when I, knowing that the horse-chestnuts were in bloom
along the Champs Elysees, threw my rope-soled shoes to a beggar,
packed a rusty trunk, and was off for the banks of the Seine.</p>

<p>My arrival&mdash;just the drive from the Gare de Lyon to my studio&mdash;was
like the shock of surf on a bather's breast.</p>

<p>The stir and life, the cheerful energy of the streets, put stir
and life and cheerful energy into me. I felt the itch to work
again, to be at it, at it in earnest&mdash;to lose no hour of daylight,
and to paint better than I had painted!</p>

<p>Paris having given me this impetus, I dared not tempt her further,
nor allow the edge of my eagerness time to blunt; therefore, at
the end of a fortnight, I went over into Normandy and deposited
that rusty trunk of mine in a corner of the summer pavilion in
the courtyard of Madame Brossard's inn, Les Trois Pigeons, in
a woodland neighborhood that is there. Here I had painted through
a prolific summer of my youth, and I was glad to find&mdash;as I had
hoped&mdash;nothing changed; for the place was dear to me. Madame Brossard
(dark, thin, demure as of yore, a fine-looking woman with a fine
manner and much the flavour of old Norman portraits) gave me a
pleasant welcome, remembering me readily but without surprise,
while Amedee, the antique servitor, cackled over me and was as
proud of my advent as if I had been a new egg and he had laid
me. The simile is grotesque; but Amedee is the most henlike waiter
in France.</p>

<p>He is a white-haired, fat old fellow, always well-shaved; as
neat as a billiard-ball. In the daytime, when he is partly porter,
he wears a black tie, a gray waistcoat broadly striped with scarlet,
and, from waist to feet, a white apron like a skirt, and so competently
encircling that his trousers are of mere conventionality and no
real necessity; but after six o'clock (becoming altogether a maitre
d'hotel) he is clad as any other formal gentleman. At all times
he wears a fresh table-cloth over his arm, keeping an exaggerated
pile of them ready at hand on a ledge in one of the little bowers
of the courtyard, so that he may never be shamed by getting caught
without one.</p>

<p>His conception of life is that all worthy persons were created
as receptacles for food and drink; and five minutes after my arrival
he had me seated (in spite of some meek protests) in a wicker
chair with a pitcher of the right Three Pigeons cider on the table
before me, while he subtly dictated what manner of dinner I should
eat. For this interval Amedee's exuberance was sobered and his
badinage dismissed as being mere garniture, the questions now
before us concerning grave and inward matters. His suggestions
were deferential but insistent; his manner was that of a prime
minister who goes through the form of convincing the sovereign.
He greeted each of his own decisions with a very loud "Bien!"
as if startled by the brilliancy of my selections, and, the menu
being concluded, exploded a whole volley of "Biens" and set off
violently to instruct old Gaston, the cook.</p>

<p>That is Amedee's way; he always starts violently for anywhere
he means to go. He is a little lame and his progress more or less
sidelong, but if you call him, or new guests arrive at the inn,
or he receives an order from Madame Brossard, he gives the effect
of running by a sudden movement of the whole body like that of
a man <em>ABOUT </em>to run, and moves off using the gestures
of a man who IS running; after which he proceeds to his destination
at an exquisite leisure. Remembering this old habit of his, it
was with joy that I noted his headlong departure. Some ten feet
of his progress accomplished, he halted (for no purpose but to
scratch his head the more luxuriously); next, strayed from the
path to contemplate a rose-bush, and, selecting a leaf with careful
deliberation, placed it in his mouth and continued meditatively
upon his way to the kitchen.</p>

<p>I chuckled within me; it was good to be back at Madame Brossard's.</p>

<p>The courtyard was more a garden; bright with rows of flowers
in formal little beds and blossoming up from big green tubs, from
red jars, and also from two brightly painted wheel-barrows. A
long arbour offered a shelter of vines for those who might choose
to dine, breakfast, or lounge beneath, and, here and there among
the shrubberies, you might come upon a latticed bower, thatched
with straw. My own pavilion (half bedroom, half studio) was set
in the midst of all and had a small porch of its own with a rich
curtain of climbing honeysuckle for a screen from the rest of
the courtyard.</p>

<p>The inn itself is gray with age, the roof sagging pleasantly
here and there; and an old wooden gallery runs the length of each
wing, the guest-chambers of the upper story opening upon it like
the deck-rooms of a steamer, with boxes of tulips and hyacinths
along the gallery railings and window ledges for the gayest of
border-lines.</p>

<p>Beyond the great open archway, which gives entrance to the courtyard,
lies the quiet country road; passing this, my eyes followed the
wide sweep of poppy-sprinkled fields to a line of low green hills;
and there was the edge of the forest sheltering those woodland
interiors which I had long ago tried to paint, and where I should
be at work to-morrow.</p>

<p>In the course of time, and well within the bright twilight, Amedee
spread the crisp white cloth and served me at a table on my pavilion
porch. He feigned anxiety lest I should find certain dishes (those
which he knew were most delectable) not to my taste, but was obviously
so distended with fatuous pride over the whole meal that it became
a temptation to denounce at least some trifling sauce or garnishment;
nevertheless, so much mendacity proved beyond me and I spared
him and my own conscience. This puffed-uppedness of his was to
be observed only in his expression of manner, for during the consumption
of food it was his worthy custom to practise a ceremonious, nay,
a reverential, hush, and he never offered (or approved) conversation
until he had prepared the salad. That accomplished, however, and
the water bubbling in the coffee machine, he readily favoured
me with a discourse on the decline in glory of Les Trois Pigeons.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, it is the automobiles; they have done it. Formerly,
as when monsieur was here, the painters came from Paris. They
would come in the spring and would stay until the autumn rains.
What busy times and what drolleries! Ah, it was gay in those days!
Monsieur remembers well. Ha, Ha! But now, I think, the automobiles
have frightened away the painters; at least they do not come any
more. And the automobiles themselves; they come sometimes for
lunch, a few, but they love better the seashore, and we are just
close enough to be too far away. Those automobiles, they love
the big new hotels and the casinos with roulette. They eat hastily,
gulp down a liqueur, and pouf! off they rush for Trouville, for
Houlgate&mdash;for heaven knows where! And even the automobiles do
not come so frequently as they did. Our road used to be the best
from Lisieux to Beuzeval, but now the maps recommend another.
They pass us by, and yet yonder&mdash;only a few kilometres&mdash;is the
coast with its thousands. We are near the world but out of it,
monsieur."</p>

<p>He poured my coffee; dropped a lump of sugar from the tongs with
a benevolent gesture&mdash;"One lump: always the same. Monsieur sees
that I remember well, ha?"&mdash;and the twilight having fallen, he
lit two orange-shaded candles and my cigar with the same match.
The night was so quiet that the candle-lights burned as steadily
as flames in a globe, yet the air was spiced with a cool fragrance,
and through the honeysuckle leaves above me I saw, as I leaned
back in my wicker chair, a glimmer of kindly stars.</p>

<p>"Very comfortably out of the world, Amedee," I said. "It seems
to me I have it all to myself."</p>

<p>"Unhappily, yes!" he exclaimed; then excused himself, chuckling.
"I should have said that we should be happier if we had many like
monsieur. But it is early in the season to despair. Then, too,
our best suite is already engaged."</p>

<p>"By whom?"</p>

<p>"Two men of science who arrive next week. One is a great man.
Madame Brossard is pleased that he is coming to Les Trois Pigeons,
but I tell her it is only natural. He comes now for the first
time because he likes the quiet, but he will come again, like
monsieur, because he has been here before. That is what I always
say: 'Any one who has been here must come again.' The problem
is only to get them to come the first time. Truly!"</p>

<p>"Who is the great man, Amedee?"</p>

<p>"Ah! A distinguished professor of science. Truly."</p>

<p>"What science?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. But he is a member of the Institute. Monsieur
must have heard of that great Professor Keredec?"</p>

<p>"The name is known. Who is the other?"</p>

<p>"A friend of his. I do not know. All the upper floor of the east
wing they have taken&mdash;the Grande Suite&mdash;those two and their valet-de-chambre.
That is truly the way in modern times&mdash;the philosophers are rich
men."</p>

<p>"Yes," I sighed. "Only the painters are poor nowadays."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, monsieur!" Amedee laughed cunningly.</p>

<p>"It was always easy to see that monsieur only amuses himself
with his painting."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Amedee," I responded. "I have amused other people
with it too, I fear."</p>

<p>"Oh, without doubt!" he agreed graciously, as he folded the cloth.
I have always tried to believe that it was not so much my pictures
as the fact that I paid my bills the day they were presented which
convinced everybody about Les Trois Pigeons that I was an amateur.
But I never became happily enough settled in this opinion to risk
pressing an investigation; and it was a relief that Amedee changed
the subject.</p>

<p>"Monsieur remembers the Chateau de Quesnay&mdash;at the crest of the
hill on the road north of Dives?"</p>

<p>"I remember."</p>

<p>"It is occupied this season by some rich Americans."</p>

<p>"How do you know they are rich?"</p>

<p>"Dieu de Dieu!" The old fellow appealed to heaven. "But they
are Americans!"</p>

<p>"And therefore millionaires. Perfectly, Amedee."</p>

<p>"Perfectly, monsieur. Perhaps monsieur knows them."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know them."</p>

<p>"Truly!" He affected dejection. "And poor Madame Brossard thought
monsieur had returned to our old hotel because he liked it, and
remembered our wine of Beaune and the good beds and old Gaston's
cooking!"</p>

<p>"Do not weep, Amedee," I said. "I have come to paint; not because
I know the people who have taken Quesnay." And I added: "I may
not see them at all."</p>

<p>In truth I thought that very probable. Miss Elizabeth had mentioned
in one of her notes that Ward had leased Quesnay, but I had not
sought quarters at Les Trois Pigeons because it stood within walking
distance of the chateau. In my industrious frame of mind that
circumstance seemed almost a drawback. Miss Elizabeth, ever hospitable
to those whom she noticed at all, would be doubly so in the country,
as people always are; and I wanted all my time to myself&mdash;no very
selfish wish since my time was not conceivably of value to any
one else. I thought it wise to leave any encounter with the lady
to chance, and as the by-paths of the country-side were many and
intricate, I intended, without ungallantry, to render the chance
remote. George himself had just sailed on a business trip to America,
as I knew from her last missive; and until his return, I should
put in all my time at painting and nothing else, though I liked
his sister, as I have said, and thought of her&mdash;often.</p>

<p>Amedee doubted my sincerity, however, for he laughed incredulously.</p>

<p>"Eh, well, monsieur enjoys saying it!"</p>

<p>"Certainly. It is a pleasure to say what one means."</p>

<p>"But monsieur could not mean it. Monsieur will call at the chateau
in the morning"&mdash;the complacent varlet prophesied&mdash;"as early as
it will be polite. I am sure of that. Monsieur is not at all an
old man; no, not yet! Even if he were, aha! no one could possess
the friendship of that wonderful Madame d'Armand and remain away
from the chateau."</p>

<p>"Madame d'Armand?" I said. "That is not the name. You mean Mademoiselle
Ward."</p>

<p>"No, no!" He shook his head and his fat cheeks bulged with a
smile which I believe he intended to express a respectful roguishness.
"Mademoiselle Ward" (he pronounced it "Ware") "is magnificent;
every one must fly to obey when she opens her mouth. If she did
not like the ocean there below the chateau, the ocean would have
to move! It needs only a glance to perceive that Mademoiselle
Ward is a great lady&mdash;but <em>MADAME D'ARMAND! AHA!" </em>He rolled
his round eyes to an effect of unspeakable admiration, and with
a gesture indicated that he would have kissed his hand to the
stars, had that been properly reverential to Madame d'Armand.
"But monsieur knows very well for himself!"</p>

<p>"Monsieur knows that you are very confusing&mdash;even for a maitre
d'hotel. We were speaking of the present chatelaine of Quesnay,
Mademoiselle Ward. I have never heard of Madame d'Armand."</p>

<p>"Monsieur is serious?"</p>

<p>"Truly!" I answered, making bold to quote his shibboleth.</p>

<p>"Then monsieur has truly much to live for. Truly!" he chuckled
openly, convinced that he had obtained a marked advantage in a
conflict of wits, shaking his big head from side to side with
an exasperating air of knowingness. "Ah, truly! When that lady
drives by, some day, in the carriage from the chateau&mdash;eh? Then
monsieur will see how much he has to live for. Truly, truly, truly!"</p>

<p>He had cleared the table, and now, with a final explosion of
the word which gave him such immoderate satisfaction, he lifted
the tray and made one of his precipitate departures.</p>

<p>"Amedee," I said, as he slackened down to his sidelong leisure.</p>

<p>"Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Who is Madame d'Armand?"</p>

<p>"A guest of Mademoiselle Ward at Quesnay. In fact, she is in
charge of the chateau, since Mademoiselle Ward is, for the time,
away."</p>

<p>"Is she a Frenchwoman?"</p>

<p>"It seems not. In fact, she is an American, though she dresses
with so much of taste. Ah, Madame Brossard admits it, and Madame
Brossard knows the art of dressing, for she spends a week of every
winter in Rouen&mdash;and besides there is Trouville itself only some
kilometres distant. Madame Brossard says that Mademoiselle Ward
dresses with richness and splendour and Madame d'Armand with economy,
but beauty. Those were the words used by Madame Brossard. Truly."</p>

<p>"Madame d'Armand's name is French," I observed.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true," said Amedee thoughtfully. "No one can deny
it; it is a French name." He rested the tray upon a stump near
by and scratched his head. "I do not understand how that can be,"
he continued slowly. "Jean Ferret, who is chief gardener at the
chateau, is an acquaintance of mine. We sometimes have a cup of
cider at Pere Baudry's, a kilometre down the road from here; and
Jean Ferret has told me that she is an American. And yet, as you
say, monsieur, the name is French. Perhaps she is French after
all."</p>

<p>"I believe," said I, "that if I struggled a few days over this
puzzle, I might come to the conclusion that Madame d'Armand is
an American lady who has married a Frenchman."</p>

<p>The old man uttered an exclamation of triumph.</p>

<p>"Ha! without doubt! Truly she must be an American lady who has
married a Frenchman. Monsieur has already solved the puzzle. Truly,
truly!" And he trulied himself across the darkness, to emerge
in the light of the open door of the kitchen with the word still
rumbling in his throat.</p>

<p>Now for a time there came the clinking of dishes, sounds as of
pans and kettles being scoured, the rolling gutturals of old Gaston,
the cook, and the treble pipings of young "Glouglou," his grandchild
and scullion. After a while the oblong of light from the kitchen
door disappeared; the voices departed; the stillness of the dark
descended, and with it that unreasonable sense of pathos which
night in the country brings to the heart of a wanderer. Then,
out of the lonely silence, there issued a strange, incongruous
sound as an execrable voice essayed to produce the semblance of
an air odiously familiar about the streets of Paris some three
years past, and I became aware of a smell of some dreadful thing
burning. Beneath the arbour I perceived a glowing spark which
seemed to bear a certain relation to an oval whitish patch suggesting
the front of a shirt. It was Amedee, at ease, smoking his cigarette
after the day's work and convinced that he was singing.</p>

<p>  "Pour qu'j'finisse   Mon service   Au Tonkin je suis parti- 
Ah! quel beau pays, mesdames!   C'est l'paradis des p'tites femmes!"</p>

<p>I rose from the chair on my little porch, to go to bed; but I
was reminded of something, and called to him.</p>

<p>"Monsieur?" his voice came briskly.</p>

<p>"How often do you see your friend, Jean Ferret, the gardener
of Quesnay?"</p>

<p>"Frequently, monsieur. To-morrow morning I could easily carry
a message if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is precisely what I do not wish. And you may as well not
mention me at all when you meet him."</p>

<p>"It is understood. Perfectly."</p>

<p>"If it is well understood, there will be a beautiful present
for a good maitre d'hotel some day."</p>

<p>"Thank you, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Good night, Amedee."</p>

<p>"Good night, monsieur."</p>

<p>Falling to sleep has always been an intricate matter with me:
I liken it to a nightly adventure in an enchanted palace. Weary-limbed
and with burning eyelids, after long waiting in the outer court
of wakefulness, I enter a dim, cool antechamber where the heavy
garment of the body is left behind and where, perhaps, some acquaintance
or friend greets me with a familiar speech or a bit of nonsense&mdash;or
an unseen orchestra may play music that I know. From here I go
into a spacious apartment where the air and light are of a fine
clarity, for it is the hall of revelations, and in it the secrets
of secrets are told, mysteries are resolved, perplexities cleared
up, and sometimes I learn what to do about a picture that has
bothered me. This is where I would linger, for beyond it I walk
among crowding fantasies, delusions, terrors and shame, to a curtain
of darkness where they take my memory from me, and I know nothing
of my own adventures until I am pushed out of a secret door into
the morning sunlight. Amedee was the acquaintance who met me in
the antechamber to-night. He remarked that Madame d'Armand was
the most beautiful woman in the world, and vanished. And in the
hall of revelations I thought that I found a statue of her&mdash;but
it was veiled. I wished to remove the veil, but a passing stranger
stopped and told me laughingly that the veil was all that would
ever be revealed of her to me&mdash;of her, or any other woman!</p>
