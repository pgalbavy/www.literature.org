<p>"There!" she said, after a few minutes. "The storm is over."
</p><p>She raised her beautiful face, now lit with a smile:
</p><p>"No black on my eye-lashes, you see," she added, gaily. "No rouge on my
lips.... Take note, please.... Nothing that comes off!"
</p><p>This versatility of mood, the despair, which he had felt to be real,
followed by a light-heartedness which he felt to be equally sincere; all
this bewildered Philippe.
</p><p>She began to laugh:
</p><p>"Philippe! Philippe! You look as though you did not understand much
about women ... and even less about girls!"
</p><p>She rose and went to the next room, which was her bedroom, as he saw by
the white curtains and the arrangement of the furniture; and she
returned with an album, in which she showed him, on the first page, the
photograph of a child, crying:
</p><p>"Look, Philippe. I haven't changed. At two years old, just as now, I
used to have great big sorrows and eyes that flowed like taps."
</p><p>He turned the pages of the album. There were portraits of Suzanne at all
ages: Suzanne as a child, Suzanne as a little girl, Suzanne as a young
girl; and each was more bewitching than the last.
</p><p>At the bottom of one page, he read:
</p><p>"<u>Suzanne, twenty.</u>"
</p><p>"Lord, how pretty you were!" he muttered, dazed by that image of beauty
and gladness.
</p><p>And he looked at Suzanne, in spite of himself.
</p><p>"I have grown older," she said. "Three long years...."
</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders without replying, for, on the contrary, he
thought her lovelier still; and he turned the pages. Two loose
photographs slipped to the floor. She put out her hand to take them, but
did not complete the movement.
</p><p>"May I?" asked Philippe.
</p><p>"Yes, certainly."
</p><p>He was much astonished when he examined one of the portraits:
</p><p>"This," he said, "makes you look older than you are.... How funny! And
why that old-fashioned dress?... That quaint way of doing your hair....
It's you ... and yet it's not you.... Who is it?"
</p><p>"Mamma," she said.
</p><p>He was surprised, knowing Jorancé's persistent rancour, that he should
have given his daughter the portrait of a mother whom she had been
taught to believe long dead. And he remembered the riotous adventures of
the divorced wife, now the beautiful Mme. de Glaris, who was celebrated
in the chronicles of fast society for her dresses and her jewellery and
whose photographs were displayed in the shop-windows of the Rue de
Rivoli for the admiration of the passers-by.
</p><p>"Yes," he said, awkwardly and not quite knowing what he was saying,
"yes, you are like her.... And is this also ...?"
</p><p>He suppressed a movement of astonishment. This time, he clearly
recognized Suzanne's mother, or rather the Mme. de Glaris of the Rue de
Rivoli, bare-shouldered, decked in her pearls and diamonds, shameless
and magnificent.
</p><p>Suzanne, who kept her eyes raised to his face, did not speak; and they
remained opposite each other, motionless and silent.
</p><p>"Does she know the truth?" Philippe asked himself. "No ... no ... it's
not possible.... She must have bought this photograph, because of the
likeness to herself which she saw in it, and she does not suspect
anything...."
</p><p>But he was not satisfied with his surmise and he dared not question the
girl, for fear of touching upon one of those mysterious griefs which
become more acute when once they are no longer secret.
</p><p>She put the two portraits back in the album and locked the clasp with a
little key. Then, after a long pause, laying her hand on Philippe's arm,
she said to him, in words that corresponded strangely with the thoughts
that troubled him:
</p><p>"Do not be angry with me, dear, and, above all, do not judge me too
severely. There is a Suzanne in me whom I do not know well ... and who
often frightens me.... She is capricious, jealous, wrong-headed, capable
of anything ... yes, of anything.... The real Suzanne is good and
sensible: 'You're <u>my</u> daughter to-day,' papa used to say to me, when I
was a little girl. And he said it in such a happy tone! But, the next
day, I was his daughter no longer; and, struggle and fight as hard as I
might, I could not become so again.... Things prevented me; and I used
to cry because papa seemed to hate me.... And I wanted to be good....
And I still want to and I always do.... But there is nothing in the
world so hard ... because the other ... the other one does not want
to.... And besides ..."
</p><p>"What?"
</p><p>She waited a moment, as though hesitating, and continued:
</p><p>"And, besides, what she wants, what the other Suzanne wants does not
appear to me so very unreasonable. It is an immense longing to love
somebody, but to love madly, boundlessly, to love too well.... Then it
seems to me that life has no other object ... and all the rest bores
me.... You know, Philippe, even when I was ever so small, that word love
used to upset me. And, later ... and now, at certain times, I feel my
brain going and all my soul seeking, waiting...."
</p><p>She hid her face again, as though seized with a sudden feeling of
bashfulness, and Philippe saw, between her fingers, her crimson forehead
and cheeks.
</p><p>His pity swelled within him. Through those desultory confidences, he saw
Suzanne as she was, ignorant, ill-informed about herself and about the
realities of life, troubled with desires which she took for unsatisfied
feelings, torn by the implacable duel between contrary instincts and
possessing nothing to counteract her woman's nature but a wayward and
melancholy virtue.
</p><p>How good it would be to save her! He went up to her and, very gently,
said:
</p><p>"You must get married, Suzanne."
</p><p>She shook her head:
</p><p>"There have been young men here who seemed to like me, but they always
went away after a few days. One would almost think that they were afraid
of me ... or that they had heard things ... against me.... Besides ... I
didn't care for them.... It was not they ... that I was waiting for....
It was somebody else.... And he did not come."
</p><p>He understood the irreparable words which she was about to utter and he
ardently hoped that she would not utter them.
</p><p>Suzanne guessed his wish and was silent. But the avowal was so clear,
even when unexpressed, that Philippe read all its passion in the long
silence that followed. And Suzanne experienced a great joy, as though
the indissoluble bond of words were linking them together. She added:
</p><p>"It was a little your fault, Philippe, and you felt it, in a way, at
dinner. Yes, a little your fault.... In Paris, I lived a dangerous life
beside you.... Just think, we were always together, always by ourselves,
we two; and, for days at a time, I had the right to think that there was
no one in the world but you and I. It was for me that you talked, it was
to make me worthy of yourself that you explained things to me which I
did not know, that you took me to see the beautiful sights in the
churches, in the old towns.... And I, I was amazed. At what I was
learning? Oh, no, Philippe, but at the new world that suddenly opened up
to me. I did not listen to your words, but I listened to the sound of
your voice. My eyes saw only your eyes. It was your admiration that I
admired; your love for the beautiful was what I loved. All that you
taught me to know ... and to love, Philippe, was ... yourself."
</p><p>Notwithstanding his inward rebellion, the words entered into Philippe's
being like a caress; and he too almost forgot himself in the pleasure of
listening to the sound of a soft voice and looking into eyes that are
dear to one.
</p><p>He said, simply:
</p><p>"And Marthe?"
</p><p>She did not answer; and he felt that, like many women, she was
indifferent to considerations of that sort. To them, love is a reason
that excuses everything.
</p><p>Then, seeking to create a diversion, he repeated:
</p><p>"You must get married, Suzanne, you must. That is where your safety
lies."
</p><p>"Oh, I know!" she said, wringing her hands in despair. "I know ... only
..."
</p><p>"Only what?"
</p><p>"I haven't the strength to."
</p><p>"You must find the strength."
</p><p>"I can't.... I ought to have it given me. I ought to have ... oh,
nothing very much, perhaps ... a little gladness ... a glad memory ...
the thought that my life will not have been entirely wasted.... The
thought that I too shall have had my spell of love.... But that short
spell I ask for ... I beg for it, I pray for it."
</p><p>He blurted out:
</p><p>"You will find it in marriage, Suzanne."
</p><p>"No, no," she said, more bitterly, "only the man I love can give it to
me.... I want, once at least, to feel a pair of arms around me, nothing
but that, I assure you ... to lay my head on your shoulder and to remain
like that, for an instant."
</p><p>She was so near to Philippe that the muslin of her bodice touched his
clothes and he breathed the scent of her hair. He felt a mad temptation
to take her in his arms. And it would have been a very small thing, as
she had said: one of those moments of happiness which one plucks like a
flower and remembers.
</p><p>She looked at him, not sadly now, nor resigned, but smiling, archly,
with all the ingenious charm of the woman who is trying to conquer.
</p><p>He turned pale and murmured:
</p><p>"Suzanne, I am your friend. Be my friend, simply, and let your
imagination ..."
</p><p>"You're afraid," she said.
</p><p>He tried to jest:
</p><p>"Afraid! Goodness gracious me, of what?"
</p><p>"Afraid of the one little affectionate action which I ask of you, the
action of a brother kissing his sister. That's what you shrink from,
Philippe."
</p><p>"I shrink from it because it is wrong and wicked," he declared, firmly.
"That is the only reason."
</p><p>"No, Philippe, there is another reason."
</p><p>"Which is that?"
</p><p>"You love me."
</p><p>"I! I love you?... I!"
</p><p>"Yes, you, Philippe, you love me. And I defy you to look me in the face,
to look me straight in the eyes and deny it."
</p><p>And, without giving him time to recover, she continued, bending over him
eagerly:
</p><p>"You were in love with me, before I fell in love with you. It was your
love that created mine. Don't protest, you have no right to do so now,
for you know.... And I, I knew it from the first day. Oh, believe me, a
woman is never mistaken.... Your eyes, when they looked at me, had a new
look in them ... there, the look of just now. You have never looked like
that at any woman, Philippe; not even at Marthe, ... no ... not even at
her.... You never loved her, her nor the others. I was the first. Love
was a thing unknown to you and you do not understand it yet ... and you
sit there in front of me, nonplussed and dumbfoundered, because the
truth appears to you and because you love me, Philippe, because you love
me, my dear Philippe...."
</p><p>She clung to him, in an upheaval of hope and certainty, and he seemed
not to resist.
</p><p>"You were afraid, Philippe. That is why you made up your mind not to see
me again.... That is why you spoke so harshly to me just now.... You
were afraid, because you love me.... Do you understand now?... Oh,
Philippe, I should not have acted with you as I have done, if you did
not love me.... I should never have had the presumption!... But I
knew.... I knew ... and you don't deny it, do you?... Oh, how I
suffered! My jealousy of Marthe!... To-day again, when she kissed
you.... And the thought of going away without as much as saying good-bye
to you!... And the thought of that marriage!... What a torture!... But
it's over now, is it not? I shall suffer no more ... because you love
me."
</p><p>She spoke these last words with a sort of timorous hesitation and
without taking her eyes from Philippe's face, as though expecting him to
give an answer that would calm the sudden anguish with which she was
torn.
</p><p>He was silent. His eyes were dull, his forehead creased with wrinkles.
He seemed to be reflecting and did not appear to reck that Suzanne was
there so close to him, her arms clinging to his arms.
</p><p>She whispered:
</p><p>"Philippe.... Philippe...."
</p><p>Had he heard? He remained impassive. Then, little by little, Suzanne
released her embrace. Her hands fell to her sides. She gazed with
infinite distress upon the man she loved and, suddenly, sank into a
heap, weeping:
</p><p>"Oh, I am mad!... I am mad! Why did I speak?"
</p><p>It was a horrible ordeal for her, after the hope that had excited her,
and this time it was real tears that flowed down her cheeks. The sound
of the sobs roused Philippe from his dream. He listened to it sadly and
then began to pace the room. Moved though he was, what was passing
within him troubled him even more. He loved Suzanne!
</p><p>It did not for a second occur to him to deny the truth. From the first
sentences that Suzanne had spoken and without his having to seek for
further proofs, he had admitted his love even as one admits the presence
of a thing that one sees and touches. And that was why Suzanne, at the
mere sight of Philippe's attitude, had suddenly realized the imprudence
which she had committed in speaking: Philippe, once warned, was escaping
her. He was one of those men who become conscious of their duty at the
very moment when they perceive their fault.
</p><p>"Philippe!" she said, once more. "Philippe!"
</p><p>As he did not reply, she took his hand again and whispered:
</p><p>"You love me, though ... you love me.... Well, then, if you love me ..."
</p><p>The tears did not disfigure her exquisite face. On the contrary, grief
decked her with a new, graver and more touching beauty. And she ended,
ingenuously enough:
</p><p>"Then, if you love me, why do you repel me? Surely, when one loves, one
does not repel the thing one loves.... And you love me...."
</p><p>The pretty mouth was all entreaty. Philippe observed its voluptuous
action. It was as though the two lips delighted in uttering words of
love and as though they could pronounce no others.
</p><p>He turned away his eyes to escape the fascination and, controlling
himself, mastering his voice so that she might not perceive its tremor,
he said:
</p><p>"It is just because I love you, Suzanne, that I am repulsing you ...
because I love you too well...."
</p><p>The phrase implied a breach which she felt to be irreparable. She did
not attempt to protest. It was finished. And she knew this so thoroughly
that, a moment later, when Philippe opened the door and prepared to go
away, she did not even raise her head.
</p><p>He did not go, however, for fear of offending her. He sat down. There
was only a little table between them. But how far he was from her! And
how it must surprise her that all her feminine wiles, her coquetry, the
allurement of her lips were powerless to subjugate the will of that man
who loved her!
</p><p>The belfry-clock struck ten. When Morestal and Jorancé arrived, Suzanne
and Philippe had not exchanged a single word.
</p><pre>
                                   *
                                  * *</pre>
<p>"Ready to start, Philippe?" cried Morestal. "Have you said good-bye to
Suzanne?"
</p><p>She replied:
</p><p>"Yes, we have said good-bye."
</p><p>"Well, then it's my turn," he said, kissing her. "Jorancé, it's settled
that you're coming with us."
</p><p>"As far as the Butte-aux-Loups."
</p><p>"If you go as far as the Butte," said Suzanne to her father, "you may
just as well go on to the Old Mill and come back by the high-road."
</p><p>"That's true. But are you staying behind, Suzanne?"
</p><p>She decided to see them out of Saint-Élophe. She quickly wrapped a silk
scarf round her head:
</p><p>"Here I am," she said.
</p><p>The four of them walked off, along the sleeping streets of the little
town, and Morestal at once began to comment on his interview with
Captain Daspry. A very intelligent man, the captain, who had not failed
to see the importance of the Old Mill as a block-house, to use his
expression. But, from another point of view, he had given something of a
shock to Morestal's opinions on the attitude which a French officer
should maintain towards his inferiors.
</p><p>"Just imagine, Philippe: he refuses to punish the soldiers I told him
about ... you know, the pillagers whom Saboureux complained of.... Well,
he refuses to punish them ... even the leader of the band, one
Duvauchel, a lover of every country but his own, who glories in his
ideas, they say. Can you understand it? The rascal escapes with a fine
of ten francs, an apology, a promise not to do it again and a lecture
from his captain! And Mossieu Daspry pretends that, with kindness and
patience, he succeeds in turning Duvauchel and fellows of his kidney
into his best soldiers! What humbug! As though there were any way of
taming those beggars, short of discipline! A pack of good-for-nothing
scoundrels, who would fly across the frontier the moment the first shot
was fired!"
</p><p>Philippe had instinctively slackened his pace. Suzanne was walking
beside him; and, every now and then, by the light of an electric lamp,
he saw the golden halo of her hair and the delicate profile draped in
the silk scarf.
</p><p>He felt full of gentleness for her, now that he no longer feared her,
and he was tempted to speak kind words to her, as to a little sister of
whom one is very fond. But the silence was sweeter still and he did not
wish to break its charm.
</p><p>They passed the last houses. The street ran into a white country-road,
lined with tall poplars. And they heard scraps of Morestal's
conversation:
</p><p>"Oh, yes! Captain Daspry! Leniency, friendly relations between superiors
and inferiors, the barracks looked upon as a school of brotherhood, with
the officers for instructors! That's all very well; but do you know what
a system of that sort leads to? An army of deserters and renegades...."
</p><p>Suzanne said, in a low voice:
</p><p>"May I have your arm, Philippe?"
</p><p>He at once slipped his arm through hers, happy at the thought of
pleasing her. And he felt, besides, a great relief at seeing that she
leant against him with the confidence of a friend. They were going to
part and nothing would tarnish the pure memory of that day. It was a
comforting impression, which nevertheless caused him a certain sadness.
Duty fulfilled always leaves a taste of bitterness behind. The
intoxication of sacrifice no longer stimulates you; and you begin to
understand what you have refused.
</p><p>In the warm night, amid all the perfumes that stirred in the breeze,
Suzanne's own scent was wafted up to him. He inhaled it long and
greedily and reflected that no scent had ever excited him before:
</p><p>"Good-bye," he said, within himself. "Good-bye, little girl; good-bye to
what was my love."
</p><p>And, during those last minutes, as though he were granting a crowning
grace to his impossible longings and his forbidden dreams, he yielded to
the delights of that love which had blossomed so mysteriously in the
unknown regions of his soul.
</p><p>"Good-bye," Suzanne now said. "Good-bye, Philippe."
</p><p>"Are you going?"
</p><p>"Yes, or else my father would come back with me; and I want nobody ...
nobody...."
</p><p>Jorancé and old Morestal had stopped near a bench, at a place where two
paths met, the wider of which, the one on the left, climbed up towards
the frontier. The spot was known as the Carrefour du Grand Chêne, or
Great Oak Crossways.
</p><p>Morestal kissed the girl again:
</p><p>"Good-bye, for the present, Suzanne. And don't forget that I'm coming to
your wedding."
</p><p>He pressed the spring of his repeater:
</p><p>"I say, Philippe, it's a quarter past ten.... True, there's no hurry....
Your mother and Marthe must be asleep by now. No matter, let's get
on...."
</p><p>"Look here, father, if you don't mind, I would rather take the direct
road.... The path by the Butte-aux-Loups is longer; and I am feeling
rather tired."
</p><p>In reality, like Suzanne, Philippe wanted to go home alone, so that
nothing might disturb the melancholy charm of his dream. Old Morestal's
long speeches terrified him.
</p><p>"As you please, my boy," cried the old man. "But mind you don't put up
the bolt or the chain on the hall-door."
</p><p>Jorancé impressed the same injunctions on Suzanne and the two walked
away.
</p><p>"Good-bye, Philippe," said the girl, once again.
</p><p>He had already entered the path on the right.
</p><p>"Good-bye, Suzanne," he said.
</p><p>"Give me your hand, Philippe."
</p><p>For his hand to reach Suzanne's, he had to turn two or three steps
back. He hesitated. But she had come towards him and, very gently, drew
him to the foot of the path:
</p><p>"Philippe, we must not part like this.... It is too sad! Let us go back
together to Saint-Élophe ... as far as the house.... Please do...."
</p><p>"No," he said, curtly.
</p><p>"Oh!" she moaned. "I asked so that I might be with you a little
longer.... It is so sad! But you are right. Let us part."
</p><p>He said, in a kinder tone:
</p><p>"Suzanne.... Suzanne...."
</p><p>Bending her head a little, she put out her forehead to him:
</p><p>"Kiss me, Philippe."
</p><p>He stooped, intending to kiss the curls of her hair. But she gave a
swift movement and flung her arms round his neck.
</p><p>He felt that he was lost and made a despairing effort. Suzanne's lips
were close to his, offering themselves.
</p><p>"Oh, Suzanne ... Suzanne, my darling ..." he whispered, abandoning all
resistance and pressing the girl to his breast....
