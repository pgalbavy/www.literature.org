<p>As soon as the angry hunter with the terrible gun had disappeared
among the trees of the Green Forest, and Lightfoot was sure that
he had gone for good, Lightfoot came out from his hiding-place
on top of the ridge and walked down to the pond of Paddy the Beaver
for a drink. He knew that it was quite safe to do so, for Sammy
Jay had followed the hunter, all the time screaming, "Thief! thief!
thief!" Every one within hearing could tell just where that hunter
was by Sammy's voice. It kept growing fainter and fainter, and
by that Lightfoot knew that the hunter was getting farther and
farther away.</p>

<p>Paddy the Beaver swam out from his hiding-place and climbed out
on the bank near Lightfoot. There was a twinkle in his eyes. "That
blue-coated mischief-maker isn't such a bad fellow at heart, after
all, is he?" said he.</p>

<p>Lightfoot lifted his beautiful head and set his ears forward
to catch the sound of Sammy's voice in the distance.</p>

<p>"Sammy Jay may be a mischief-maker, as some people say," said
he, "but you can always count on him to prove a true friend in
time of danger. He brought me warning of the coming of the hunter
the other morning. You saw him save Mr. and Mrs. Quack a little
while ago, and then he actually drove that hunter away. I suppose
Sammy Jay has saved more lives than any one I know of. I wish
he would come back here and let me thank him."</p>

<p>Some time later Sammy Jay did come back. "Well," said he, as
he smoothed his feathers, "I chased that fellow clear to the edge
of the Green Forest, so I guess there will be nothing more to
fear from him to-day. I'm glad to see he hasn't got you yet, Lightfoot.
I've been a bit worried about you."</p>

<p>"Sammy," said Lightfoot, "you are one of the best friends I have.
I don't know how I can ever thank you for what you have done for
me."</p>

<p>"Don't try," replied Sammy shortly. "I haven't done anything
but what anybody else would have done. Old Mother Nature gave
me a pair of good eyes and a strong voice. I simply make the best
use of them I can. Just to see a hunter with a terrible gun makes
me angry clear through. I'd rather spoil his hunting than eat."</p>

<p>"You want to watch out, Sammy. One of these days a hunter will
lose his temper and shoot you, just to get even with you," warned
Paddy the Beaver.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me," replied Sammy "I know just how far those
terrible guns can shoot, and I don't take any chances. By the
way, Lightfoot, the Green Forest is full of hunters looking for
you. I've seen a lot of them, and I know they are looking for
you because they do not shoot at anybody else even when they have
a chance."</p>
