<p>At this moment, the cheery voice of Adams called:</p>

<p>"There's only about a hundred yards more of this, but we've now
struck the worst part of the whole trail."</p>

<p>"If it is any worse than what we have just passed, it won't do
to try it," replied Captain Dawson, with the memory of his recent
thrilling experience still vivid with him.</p>

<p>"We can do it, but we must foller a different plan."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"We must lead our animals. There are plenty of places where you
can get off your horses with more comfort, but we can't stand
here doing nothing. Get to the ground the best way you know how."</p>

<p>It was clear that the advice of the guide would have to be followed,
and all four set about the task with the cool daring shown from
the first. Since each man was to lead his animal, it was necessary
to dismount in front, instead of slipping over the tail, as would
have been easier. The beasts showed striking sagacity in this
delicate task. The trail was so narrow that to dismount to the
left, on the side of the dizzying precipice, made it impossible
for a man to keep his poise, while to descend on the right, directly
beside the body of the animal was almost certain to crowd him
over into the gorge. Each, therefore, lowered himself with infinite
care over the right shoulder of his steed, so well forward, that
the horse by turning his head to the left afforded just enough
room for the trick to be done. Every one dismounted in safety,
each drawing a breath of relief when the exquisitely delicate
task was accomplished.</p>

<p>Looking around in the gloom, Vose Adams saw that his friends
stood on the ground.</p>

<p>"Are you all ready?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Brush from the rear.</p>

<p>"Hold the bridle so gentle that you can let go if your animal
slips off: if he has to go over the precipice, there's no need
of your follering him."</p>

<p>Each man took his Winchester in hand, and loosely grasping the
bridle rein, began stealing forward, the captain's loss compelling
him to make his single arm answer for both purposes. The advance
was necessarily slow, for it was made with the utmost care. The
path could not have been more dangerous than for the brief stretch
between them and the broad, safe support beyond.</p>

<p>Several times the trail so narrowed that each trembled through
fear of not being able to keep his balance, while it seemed absolutely
impossible for a horse to do so; but one of the strange facts
connected with that intelligent animal is that, despite his greater
bulk, he is generally able to follow wherever his master leads.
So it was that when a miner carefully turned his head, he saw
his steed following slowly but unfalteringly in his footsteps.</p>

<p>It was soon perceived that this perilous stretch did not take
a straight course, but assumed the form of an immense, partial
circle. When half way around, the plodders came in sight of a
huge rent in the distant mountain wall, through which the sky
showed nearly from the zenith to the horizon. In this immense
V-shaped space shone the moon nearly at its full, and without
a rift or fleck of cloud in front of its face.</p>

<p>A flood of light streamed through and between the encompassing
peaks, tinging the men and animals with its fleecy veil, as if
some of the snow from the crests had been sprinkled over them.
On their left, the craggy wall sloped almost vertically downward,
the projecting masses of rock displaying the same, fairy-like
covering, ending in a vast, yawning pit of night and blackness,
into whose awful depth the human eye could not penetrate.</p>

<p>On the right, the mass of stone, rock and boulder, rugged, broken
and tumbled together, as if flung about by giants in sport, towered
beyond the vision's reach, the caverns, abysses and hollows made
the blacker and more impenetrable by the moonlight glinting against
the protruding masses.</p>

<p>It was as if a party of Titans had run their chisels along the
flinty face of the mountain from the rear, gouging out the stone,
with less and less persistency, until they reached the spot where
the men and animals were creeping forward, when the dulled tools
scarcely made an impression sufficient to support the hesitating
feet.</p>

<p>Captain Dawson was but a few paces to the rear of Vose Adams's
mule, whose surety of step he admired and tried to imitate.</p>

<p>"Training seems able to accomplish anything," reflected the captain;
"I remember how Lieutenant Russell and I stopped on the further
edge of this infernal place when we reached it one forenoon and
spent several hours trying to find a safer path. It kept us in
a tremor until we were across. Had any one told me that on the
next journey I should try it in the night, I would have believed
him crazy, but," he grimly added, "I would have thought the same,
if I had been told that a necessity like this would compel us
to do so."</p>

<p>The bridle rein was looped over his elbow, which extended behind
him, the same hand grasping his rifle, so that he advanced partly
sideways over the treacherous trail. He attempted to do nothing
but look after his own footsteps. Sometimes, when it was a little
harder to pull the rein, he slackened his pace. It would not do
to hurry the animal, since a slight disturbance might cause him
to loose his footing. The horse knew what was required of him
and would do it better by being left wholly to himself.</p>

<p>It was because of this concentration of his mind upon the one
thing that the captain failed to perceive that the mule in his
front had stopped walking, until the rim of his slouched hat touched
the tail of the motionless animal.</p>

<p>"Helloa, Vose, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>The guide said something, but kept his face turned away, and
his words, instead of being in the nature of an answer, were addressed
to some one who confronted him. Adams was of slight stature, so
that, although he stood erect, it was easy for the captain to
look over his head and see what was beyond. That which was thus
revealed was another horseman leading his animal and coming toward
them. He was advancing in the same manner as the miners, that
is by leading his horse, and, meeting our friends thus face to
face, it was impossible for either party to pass: one or the other
must give way and retreat.</p>

<p>A startling feature of this meeting was that the individual who
thus confronted them was an Indian of gigantic stature. He was
more than six feet in height and of massive proportions. He belonged
to what were known as the "mountain Indians," who were brave and
of irrestrainable ferocity. They were the most dangerous people
met by the miners in the early days on the Pacific slope.</p>

<p>Equity demanded that this particular specimen should back his
horse over the few yards to the point where the trail broadened,
for the task was possible of accomplishment, while the white men
were unable to force their animals in safety for one-half of the
distance behind them. Moreover, it was evident that this Indian
had deliberately started over the trail, with the knowledge of
the four white men approaching, so that a meeting was inevitable.
He courted an encounter with them and was in a murderous mood.</p>

<p>Vose Adams knew all this and recognized the warrior as one of
the dreaded Indians, with whom he was better acquainted than were
his friends. He had had several scrimmages with them on his trips
through the mountains, and held them in such wholesome fear that
he contrived to avoid a direct conflict. The diminutive miner
overflowed with pluck, but in a hand to hand encounter, must be
only a child in the grasp of the aboriginal giant. The present
situation, however, was peculiar.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that this savage sought the meeting with
the party, for on no other supposition can his acts be explained.
He must have reasoned that on the narrow ledge his enemies would
have to meet him one by one and engage him single handed. He was
like a chamois that had lived all its life in these wild solitudes
and was surer-footed than any white man. What a triumph it would
be (and was it unreasonable to expect it?) for him to slay the
insignificant pale face immediately in his front, shove his mule
over the precipice, and then serve the remaining three in same
fashion!</p>

<p>"Get out of this!" were the words which Vose Adams addressed
to the Indian, directly after the question of Captain Dawson to
himself, and when the enemies were within six feet of each other;
"there isn't room for both of us; you knew that before you started;
one of us has got to give way and I'll be hanged if I do!"</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the red man did not understand a word of English,
it is not to be supposed that he grasped the whole meaning of
this command, but the situation must have made it evident that
he had been ordered to back his horse and to open a way for the
white men, and inasmuch as he had come upon the trail for the
express purpose of bringing about this encounter, it seems hardly
necessary to say that he failed to obey the order. Instead, he
repeated some words in his own language, which it is not unlikely
were of the same import as those addressed to him, for he resolutely
maintained his place.</p>

<p>"I tell you," added Vose, raising his voice, as if that could
help make his meaning clear; "if you don't do as I say, somebody
is going to get hurt!"</p>

<p>The warrior, who was carrying a rifle, stooped and gently let
it fall beside him. At the same moment he let go of the thong
which served as a bridle. Thus both hands were free and he crouched
down with his hideous face thrust forward and took a slow, half-step
toward Adams.</p>

<p>The coarse black hair dangling loosely about his shoulders, the
broad frightful countenance, which, however, was devoid of paint,
the glittering, basilisk-like eyes, the sinewy half-bent finger,
with the right fingers closed like a vise around the handle of
the knife at his waist, while gently drawing it forth, the catlike
advance,&mdash;all these made him so terrible an enemy that the bravest
man might well doubt the result of a meeting with him.</p>

<p>And yet the closest scrutiny of Vose Adams would not have discovered
any tremor in his frame, or so much as a blanching of his face.
He fully comprehended the nature of the peril that impended, but
with the cool readiness of a veteran, he had fixed upon his line
of action, in the same moment that he read the purpose of his
formidable enemy.</p>

<p>The preliminary actions of the guide were similar to that of
the warrior. The bridle rein dropped from his hand, and, slightly
stooping, he let his Winchester fall to the ground beside him.
Then his knife flashed out and he was ready.</p>

<p>Since only the mule was between Captain Dawson and the combatants,
he observed all this and interpreted its meaning.</p>

<p>"Vose, what do you mean to do?" he sharply asked.</p>

<p>"Have a little dispute with the fellow," replied Adams, without
removing his gaze from the face of the savage.</p>

<p>"You mustn't do it."</p>

<p>"It sorter looks as if it can't be helped, captain."</p>

<p>"I shall prevent it."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Thus!"</p>

<p>The captain had laid down his rifle and drawn his revolver, in
the use of which he was an expert. While thus engaged, he stooped
down, so that the interposing body of the mule, prevented the
Indian from observing what he was doing. When his weapon was ready
and just as he uttered his last word, he straightened up like
a flash. Adams being of short stature and in a stooping posture,
gave him just the chance he needed. His single arm was extended
with the quickness of lightning and he fired. The bullet bored
its way through the bronzed skull of the Indian, who, with an
ear-splitting screech, flung his arms aloft, leaped several feet
from the ground, toppled sideways over the edge of the trail and
went tumbling, rolling and doubling down the precipice far beyond
sight, into the almost fathomless abyss below.</p>

<p>"That's what I call a low down trick!" was the disgusted exclamation
of Adams, looking round with a reproachful expression.</p>

<p>"Do you refer to the Indian?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"No; to you; I had just got ready for him and had everything
fixed when you interfered."</p>

<p>"Vose, you are a fool," was the comment of his friend.</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"That fellow was twice as big as you and you hadn't an earthly
chance in a fight with him."</p>

<p>"Do you 'spose that is the first time I ever met a mountain Injin?"</p>

<p>"You never fought one of that size in this spot."</p>

<p>"What difference does the spot make?"</p>

<p>"I want you to understand," said the captain with assumed gravity,
"that I didn't interfere out of any regard for you."</p>

<p>"What the mischief are you driving at?" demanded the puzzled
guide.</p>

<p>"Under ordinary circumstances, I would have stood by and watched
the flurry, only wishing that the best man might win. That means,
of course, that you would have been the loser. But we need some
one to guide us through the mountains; you haven't done it yet;
when your work is over you may go and live on wild Indians for
all I care."</p>

<p>Vose quickly regained his good nature. He returned his knife
to its resting place, picked up his rifle, grasped the bridle
rein and gently pulled.</p>

<p>"Come, Hercules; I don't know whether they appreciate us or not;
steady now!"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with that horse in front of you?" asked
the captain.</p>

<p>"Hang it! if I didn't forget about him; back with you!" he commanded
with a gesture, moving toward the animal, who showed the intelligence
of his kind, by retrograding carefully until he reached the broad
safe place so anxiously sought by the others. There he wheeled
and trotted off, speedily disappearing from sight.</p>

<p>"Vose, you might have traded Hercules for him."</p>

<p>"Not much! I wouldn't give that mule for a drove of horses that
have belonged to these mountain Injins."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with them? Aren't they as good as ours?"</p>

<p>"They're too good; you can't tell what trick they'll sarve you;
I was once riding through these very mountains, on the back of
a horse that I picked up&mdash;it isn't necessary to say how&mdash;when
his owner gave a signal and the critter was off like a thunderbolt.
If I hadn't slipped from his back at the risk of breaking my neck,
he would have carried me right into a camp of hostiles and you
would have been without your invaluable guide on this trip."</p>

<p>"That is important information&mdash;if true&mdash;helloa! it is growing
light off there in the east!"</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;day is breaking," added Vose.</p>

<p>The captain looked at his watch and found the time considerably
past five o'clock. They had been longer on the road than any one
supposed, and the coming of morning was a vast relief to all.</p>

<p>The party were now grouped together, for the trail was broad
and safe. Parson Brush asked, as he pointed almost directly ahead:</p>

<p>"Isn't that a light off yonder?"</p>

<p>The guide gazed in that direction and replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, but it comes from a camp fire, which isn't more than a
half mile away."</p>

<p>The men looked in one another's faces and the captain asked in
a guarded voice, as if afraid of being overheard:</p>

<p>"Whose fire is it?"</p>

<p>"There's no saying with any sartinty, till we get closer, but
I shouldn't be 'sprised if it belong to the folks you're looking
for."</p>

<p>The same thought had come to each. There was a compression of
lips, a flashing of eyes and an expression of resolution that
boded ill for him who was the cause of it all.</p>

<p>In the early morning at this elevation, the air was raw and chilling.
The wind which blew fitfully brought an icy touch from the peaks
of the snow-clad Sierras. The party had ridden nearly all night,
with only comparatively slight pauses, so that the men would have
welcomed a good long rest but for the startling discovery just
made.</p>

<p>Over the eastern cliffs the sky was rapidly assuming a rosy tinge.
Day was breaking and soon the wild region would be flooded with
sunshine. Already the gigantic masses of stone and rock were assuming
grotesque form in the receding gloom. The dismal night was at
an end.</p>

<p>The twinkling light which had caught the eye of Felix Brush appeared
to be directly ahead and near the trail which they were traveling.
This fact strengthened the belief that the fire had been kindled
by the fugitives. The illumination paled as the sun climbed the
sky, until it was absorbed by the overwhelming radiance that was
everywhere.</p>

<p>The pursuers felt well rewarded for the energy they had displayed
in the face of discouragement and danger. Valuable ground had
been gained, and even now when they had supposed they were fully
a dozen miles behind the fugitives, it looked as if they had really
caught up to them, or at least were within hailing distance.</p>

<p>Every eye was fixed on the point which held so intense an interest
for them. As the day grew, a thin, wavy column of smoke was observed
ascending from the camp fire, which was partly hidden among a
growth of scrub cedars, some distance to the right of the trail,
whither it must have been difficult for the couple to force their
horses.</p>

<p>"That leftenant ought to have knowed better than to do that,"
remarked Vose Adams, "his fire can be seen a long way off."</p>

<p>"What else could they do?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"The rocks give all the cover he needs."</p>

<p>"But they could have no idea that we were so near," suggested
the parson.</p>

<p>"It isn't that, but the leftenant had 'nough 'sperience with
Injins on his way through here before to know he's liable to run
agin them at any time. I never dared to do a thing like that on
my trips."</p>

<p>"Let's push on," said the captain, who saw no reason for tarrying
now that they had located the game.</p>

<p>The ground was so much more favorable that the animals were forced
to a canter, though all were in need of rest. Little was said,
and Captain Dawson spurred forward beside Adams, who as usual
was leading.</p>

<p>Wade Ruggles and Parson Brush also rode abreast. They were far
enough to the rear to exchange a few words without being overheard.</p>

<p>"From the way things look," said Brush; "we shall have to leave
everything with the captain and he isn't likely to give us anything
to do."</p>

<p>"He's mad clean through; I don't b'leve he'll wait to say a word,
but the minute he can draw bead on the leftenant, he'll let fly."</p>

<p>"He is a fine marksman, but he may be in such a hurry that he'll
miss."</p>

<p>"No fear of that; I wonder," added Ruggles, startled by a new
thought, "whether Vose has any idee of stickin' in his oar."</p>

<p>"Likely enough."</p>

<p>"I must git a chance to warn him that we won't stand any nonsense
like that! The best that we'll do is to promise him a chance for
a crack after you and me miss."</p>

<p>"That won't be any chance at all," grimly remarked the parson.</p>

<p>"Wal, it's all he'll have and he mustn't forgit it. There's some
things I won't stand and that's one of 'em."</p>

<p>"We can't do anything now, but we may have a chance to notify
him. If the opportunity comes to me, he shall not remain ignorant."</p>

<p>They were now nearly opposite the camp and the two noticed with
surprise that Adams and the captain were riding past it.</p>

<p>"What's that fur?" asked the puzzled Ruggles.</p>

<p>"That's to prevent them from fleeing toward Sacramento. When
they find we are on the other side, they will have to turn back."</p>

<p>This was apparently the purpose of the men in advance, for they
did not draw rein until a hundred yards beyond the camp. Suddenly
the two halted, and half-facing around, waited until Brush and
Ruggles joined them. The explanation of the guide showed that
his plan had been rightly interpreted by Parson Brush.</p>
