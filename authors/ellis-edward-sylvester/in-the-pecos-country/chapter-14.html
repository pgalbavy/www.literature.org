<p>The Apaches, however, were not quarreling. They were engaged
in a dispute, or rather argument, which concerned them all, and
about which it was all-important that no blunder should be made.</p>

<p>Fred Munson, the instant he found himself upon the ground, moved
timidly back, so as to be out of the way when the expected clash
of arms would come, and he watched the three men with an intensity
of interest which can scarcely be imagined. He now noticed, for
the first time, that as the disputants talked, they all three
pointed and looked, at intervals, up the mountain, showing that
the all-absorbing topic was located there.</p>

<p>Following the direction indicated, the boy noticed the smoke
of a camp-fire rising from the side of the mountain, about a quarter
of a mile in advance. It could be seen plainly and distinctly,
although the fire itself from which the smoke came was imperceptible.
It was evident, therefore, that the discovery of this camp-fire
had produced the excitement among the Apaches.</p>

<p>And why should such be the case?</p>

<p>The fact of it was, that the three Apaches were upon territory
which could by no means be considered the exclusive tramping-ground
of their tribe. Immediately to the eastward roamed the Kiowas
and Comanches, and it was no more than natural that their warriors
should come into occasional collision, especially when none of
them were disposed to recognize any of the presumed rights of
the other.</p>

<p>The dispute, therefore, was regarding the campfire, which had
suddenly appeared to plague them. Did it belong to their friends
or enemies?</p>

<p>Lone Wolf, in sending his three warriors homeward with the captive,
dispatched them by a round-about method through the mountains,
for the reason that it would be more difficult to trail them.
The advantage which they had gained in the start, he was confident,
placed it out of the power of Sut Simpson, or any of his friends,
to do them injury. But here, while carrying out the directions
of their chief, they found themselves confronted by an unexpected
danger.</p>

<p>If the Kiowas or Comanches, as the case might be, discerned the
little company, they would not fail to observe that they had a
prize in their possession, and they very probably would show a
disposition to interfere. The wrangle was as to whether it was
best to go directly ahead upon the route they were pursuing, trusting
not only to the possibility that the strangers there were friends,
but to the prospect of their getting by without detection, or
whether they should go to the trouble of a flank movement.</p>

<p>Waukko was inclined to go directly ahead, while the others were
opposed, and, as is frequently the case with such people, the
dispute was excited and hot for awhile; but the hideous Apache
triumphed by virtue of his official position. Lone Wolf had placed
the lad in his charge, and he was bent upon managing the business
in his own fashion.</p>

<p>It was agreed, therefore, that they should continue on up the
ravine, as this offered so much the better chance for their mustangs
to make good progress. Waukko took the lead, his horse walking
at a steady gait, while he scrutinized the camp-fire as closely
and searchingly as if his life depended on the result.</p>

<p>The flame seemed to have been started directly behind a mass
of rocks, large and compact enough to shelter a dozen men, if
they wished to conceal themselves. The smoke showed that it was
burning so vigorously that fuel must have been placed upon it
but a short time before. It would seem that, if set going by hostile
hands, the owners were short-sighted in thus exposing their location;
but the mischief of such a thing is that the smoke of a camp-fire
in an Indian country may have one or more of a dozen dangerous
meanings.</p>

<p>In the West and Southwest the Indians have a system of telegraphy,
conducted entirely by means of signal fires from mountain top
to mountain top. Treaties signed in Washington in one day have
been known hundreds of miles away at night, by the redskins chiefly
concerned, who had no means of gaining the news except by some
system of telegraphy, understood only by themselves. The most
cunning and effective war movements, where the success depends
upon the cooperation of widely separated parties, have been managed
and conducted by the smoke curling upward from hills and mountain
peaks. Still further, a camp-fire is frequently used as a way
of confusing an approaching enemy, for by what means could the
latter judge whether the parties who had kindled it were in the
immediate neighborhood?</p>

<p>Was there not, in this instance, one stealthy Kiowa carefully
keeping up the blaze, while his companions had stolen around and
across the chasm, where they were ambushed and awaiting the coming
of their victims? Were not the sly dogs successful in hiding their
positions by the very means which would generally be supposed
to betray it?</p>

<p>At any rate, Waukko was not yet abreast of the dangerous point
when he again checked his mustang, and the three Apaches consulted
in a low voice and with every appearance of suppressed excitement.
There was something in the wind which made all three feel anything
but comfortable.</p>

<p>The consultation was brief and decisive. Waukko and one of his
warriors dismounted, leaving Fred and his guardian upon the remaining
horse. Waukko moved off to the right, as though he meant to reconnoiter
the camp-fire, while the other savage stole off to the left. Very
evidently there was something which needed looking after, and
it may have been that Waukko was in quest of information for his
leader, Lone Wolf.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, before Fred Munson fairly suspected it he
found himself alone with another mounted Apache, both the others
having vanished as effectually as if the ground had opened and
swallowed them up.</p>

<p>"Now is my chance, if I could only get an opening," was the truthful
conclusion of the lad, whose heart suddenly beat with an awakened
hope. "If I can manage to get this old fellow off, or if I could
steal a little march on him, so as to gain a chance, I could escape.
Anyhow, I'm going to try it," he added, and his boyish heart was
fired with a renewed determination to make a desperate leap for
liberty.</p>

<p>One Apache, however, if he attended to his business, could guard
him as effectually as a dozen, and it all depended upon the disposition
this warrior should manifest. Just now his great and all absorbing
interest was in the efforts of his comrades to detect the meaning
of the signal fire.</p>

<p>Fred sat behind him upon the horse, and he stealthily looked
to the right and left, in the hope of detecting some place which
offered an opportunity for concealment, for he felt that there
would be but the single chance offered him. If he should fail
in that, the savages would guard him too closely to permit a second
effort.</p>

<p>The ravine at this place was about a hundred feet in width. The
sides sloped abruptly downward, growing nearly perpendicular further
ahead, so that the Apaches, if caught in any trap at all, would
be caught in the worst possible manner. Hence the extreme caution
they displayed before committing themselves.</p>

<p>There were rocks and stones on the right and left, and here and
there some stunted vegetation. A few minutes start would give
any one a chance to hide, but just there was the whole difficulty.
How was the start to be obtained? It seemed, at this juncture,
as if the fates were unusually propitious. Everything conspired
to invite the attempt which the boy was so anxious to make.</p>

<p>Waukko and his companion had not been gone more than ten minutes
when one of them signaled to the Indian left behind. It came in
the shape of a soft low whistle, which could easily be mistaken
for the call of a bird. The horseman started and turned his head
sidewise to listen the instant it fell upon his ear, and this
caused Fred to notice it. The Indian held his head a moment in
the attitude of deep attention, and then he replied in precisely
the same manner without turning his head. A full minute passed.
Then a second call was heard, emitted in precisely the same manner
as before. This was the one which did the business.</p>

<p>The trained ear of the veteran scout could have detected no difference
that had been made, but there was, for all that, and a very wide
one, so far as meaning was concerned. The red-skin had no sooner
caught it than he dismounted and moved carefully forward, his
mustang quietly following him, bearing the lad upon his back.</p>

<p>The warrior glanced backward only once, to satisfy himself that
his steed was there, and understood what was required of it. In
the meantime, the heart of Fred was throbbing painfully with hope.
He felt as if Providence was interfering directly in his behalf.</p>

<p>"Now is my time," he added, a moment later.</p>
