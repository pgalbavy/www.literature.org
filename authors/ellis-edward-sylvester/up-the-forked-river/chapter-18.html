<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The two looked at each other in speechless amaze. This was a
direct interference with their personal freedom, the first either
had known.</p>

<p>The Señorita was the first to find speech. Addressing the soldier,
she said:</p>

<p>"You say this is the order of General Yozarro?"</p>

<p>"Were it not, I should not dare utter the words."</p>

<p>"What is his reason for the command?"</p>

<p>It was essentially a feminine question, but the soldier did not
hesitate with the reply:</p>

<p>"War impends between Zalapata and Atlamalco; we are expecting
at almost any hour an attack upon <em>Castillo Descanso</em>;
the Señorita observes the armed force that has been placed here
by General Yozarro; he cannot allow the Señoritas the danger of
falling into the hands of the perfidious General Bambos and his
barbarians."</p>

<p>It was on the tongue of Miss Starland to declare that she would
prefer a hundred times that eventuality to remaining in charge
of the Atlamalcans, but instead, her companion said what was in
the minds of both:</p>

<p>"The order of General Yozarro may apply to me, but cannot apply
to my friend who owes no allegiance to Atlamalco or Zalapata.
She comes from the Great Republic of the North, and no one elsewhere
has the right to say yea or nay to her."</p>

<p>"It distresses me very much, Señorita Estacardo, that special
weight was laid by General Yozarro upon the order as affecting
<em>la Americana</em>."</p>

<p>And looking toward the latter, he again removed his hat and bowed
low, instead of contenting himself with the military salute that
would have been the proper thing under the circumstances. The
soldier was above the ordinary native in intelligence.</p>

<p>His words showed the futility of further argument. Without a
word, but throwing back her head with a scornful gesture, the
Señorita nodded to her friend to accompany her back into the gloomy
building. Silently and slowly the two went up the sloping stone
steps and re-entered the room which they had left a few minutes
before. The Señorita locked the door and the two faced each other.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Manuela?"</p>

<p>"Only one thing can be made of it; it is as I said; General Yozarro
is determined you shall remain here for some time to come and
he gives no more thought to the foolhardiness of his action than
if he were a child too young to walk."</p>

<p>"What of the story of a war between the republics?"</p>

<p>"I do not believe a word of it."</p>

<p>"Meantime, what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"Sit down, fold our hands and be good; but," she added with a
flash of her eyes, "that is the last thing to do; I long to meet
my uncle face to face. It is the first time he ever offered such
an insult to the daughter of his dead sister and to her friend.
I hope he will not delay his coming."</p>

<p>"I wish to be present when you meet; I, too, shall have something
to say, which I do not think he will soon forget."</p>

<p>But the hours wore slowly away and General Yozarro came not.
Was he not shrinking from her whose fiery temper he well knew?
Which of the two did he fear the most? The northerner may have
been of cooler blood, but her anger, when once set aflame, was
all the more profound. She abominated the man with his sleek smile,
his oily manner and his tempestuous profanity when he thought
himself beyond her hearing. She could not think that the other
Dictator, with all his stupidity and grossness, was one-half as
wicked as he. Were she free to do so, she would not hesitate to
throw herself upon his protection.</p>

<p>"Where can Jack be?" she asked after the mid-day repast, and
when the two had talked over every phase of the situation for
the twentieth time. "Surely he must soon learn of this and he
will be quick to call General Yozarro to account."</p>

<p>"I place little hope on that; do not forget, my dear Warrenia,
that the Major is only one man against hundreds."</p>

<p>"But what of the yacht?"</p>

<p>"It is many miles away; no one can say when it will return; remember,
too, General Yozarro's gunboat."</p>

<p>The lip of the American curled with contempt.</p>

<p>"Let them meet and it will be Manila Bay over again on a small
scale. I only wish Captain Winton knew of this! He would sink
the miserable craft or chase her to the foot of the Andes."</p>

<p>In the momentary reaction, Señorita Estacardo smiled:</p>

<p>"You have full faith in your countrymen."</p>

<p>"So have <em>you</em>; so has every one who knows them, and who
does not? So will General Yozarro and his barbarians, if they
ever rouse the anger of my people. But why do we speculate? It
seems we can do nothing but wait. Manuela, can we not steal away
when night comes?"</p>

<p>"I have asked myself that question, but I cannot see any hope
of doing it. Neither of us can leave without being observed; guards
will be on all sides and we shall be turned back as we were this
morning. Let us go to the upper part of the Castle and look over
the country. It may avail nothing, but it will be a relief to
this monotony."</p>

<p>They climbed to the rooms above, which, as we know, were copies
of those they had just left, with the narrow windows on all sides.
The Señorita walked to the opening on the south which commanded
a view of the densely wooded mountains that stretched clear across
the island to the main branch of the Rio Rubio. She expected to
see nothing in that direction of interest and made the survey
because her companion passed to the windows on the north.</p>

<p>"Come to me!" called the American; "here is something strange."</p>

<p>The Señorita was at her side on the instant. Looking across the
mile of rugged country to where the northern stream wound its
way, they saw a small sailboat speeding to the eastward, the moderate
breeze causing it to careen far to one side. Its prow cut the
curling water and the foam spread out like a fan in its wake.</p>

<p>"If we had a glass we might study it closely," said Miss Starland
regretfully, as she scrutinized the craft.</p>

<p>"I don't think there is anything of the kind in the Castle, but
it can make little difference. The boat is a strange one to us,
and whoever is guiding it is no concern of ours."</p>

<p>"Probably you are right, but it looks to me as if there are two
or three aboard,&mdash;ah! there are three and they are heading toward
shore. They must land near where we left the boat last night."</p>

<p>"And what of that?"</p>

<p>"It looks as if they are coming to the Castle; they will soon
be here!"</p>

<p>"That does not seem likely to me; the only ones whom we expect
are General Yozarro and his friends, and so long as he has the
larger craft, he will not use such a puny boat as that."</p>
