<P>
IT was done. The last tones of her voice died away in silence.
<P>
Her eyes still rested on Horace. After hearing what he had heard
could he resist that gentle, pleading look? Would he forgive her?
A while since Julian had seen tears on his cheeks, and had
believed that he felt for her. Why was he now silent? Was it
possible that he only felt for himself?
<P>
For the last time--at the crisis of her life--Julian spoke for
her. He had never loved her as he loved her at that moment; it
tried even his generous nature to plead her cause with Horace
against himself. But he had promised her, without reserve, all
the help that her truest friend could offer. Faithfully and
manfully he redeemed his promise.
<P>
"Horace!" he said.
<P>
Horace slowly looked up. Julian rose and approached him.
<P>
"She has told you to thank _me_, if her conscience has spoken.
Thank the noble nature which answered when I called upon it! Own
the priceless value of a woman who can speak the truth. Her
heartfelt repentance is a joy in heaven. Shall it not plead for
her on earth? Honor her, if you are a Christian! Feel for her, if
you are a man!"
<P>
He waited. Horace never answered him.
<P>
Mercy's eyes turned tearfully on Julian. _His_ heart was the
heart that felt for her! _His_ words were the words which
comforted and pardoned her! When she looked back again at Horace,
it was with an effort. His last hold on her was lost. In her
inmost mind a thought rose unbidden--a thought which was not to
be repressed. "Can I ever have  loved this man?"
<P>
She advanced a step toward him ; it was not possible, even yet,
to completely forgot the past. She held out her hand.
<P>
He rose on his side--without looking at her.
<P>
"Before we part forever," she said to him, "will you take my hand
as a token that you forgive me?"
<P>
He hesitated. He half lifted his hand. The next moment the
generous impulse died away in him. In its place came the mean
fear of what might happen if he trusted himself to the dangerous
fascination of her touch. His hand dropped again at his side; he
turned away quickly.
<P>
"I can't forgive her!" he said.
<P>
With that horrible confession--without even a last look at
her--he left the room.
<P>
At the moment when he opened the door Julian's contempt for him
burst its way through all restraints.
<P>
"Horace," he said, "I pity you!"
<P>
As the words escaped him he looked back at Mercy. She had turned
aside from both of them--she had retired to a distant part of the
library The first bitter foretaste of what was in store for her
when she faced the world again had come to her from Horace! The
energy which had sustained her thus far quailed before the
dreadful prospect--doubly dreadful to a woman--of obloquy and
contempt. She sank on her knees before a little couch in the
darkest corner of the room. "O Christ, have mercy on me!" That
was her prayer--no more.
<P>
Julian followed her. He waited a little. Then his kind hand
touched her; his friendly voice fell consolingly on her ear.
<P>
"Rise, poor wounded heart! Beautiful, purified soul, God's angels
rejoice over you! Take your place among the noblest of God's
creatures!"
<P>
He raised her as he spoke. All her heart went out to him. She
caught his hand--she pressed it to her bosom; she pressed it to
her lips-- then dropped it suddenly, and stood before him
trembling like a frightened child.
<P>
"Forgive me!" was all she could say. "I was so lost and
lonely--and you are so good to me!"
<P>
She tried to leave him. It was useless--her strength was gone;
she caught at the head of the couch to support herself. He looked
at her. The confession of his love was just rising to his
lips--he looked again, and checked it. No, not at that moment;
not when she was helpless and ashamed; not when her weakness
might make her yield, only to regret it at a later time. The
great heart which had spared her and felt for her from the first
spared her and felt for her now.
<P>
He, too, left her--but not without a word at parting.
<P>
"Don't think of your future life just yet," he said, gently. "I
have something to propose when rest and quiet have restored you."
He opened the nearest door--the door of the dining-room--and went
out.
<P>
The servants engaged in completing the decoration of the
dinner-table noticed, when "Mr. Julian" entered the room, that
his eyes were "brighter than ever." He looked (they remarked)
like a man who "expected good news." They were inclined to
suspect--though he was certainly rather young for it--that her
ladyship's nephew was in a fair way of preferment in the Church.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Mercy seated herself on the couch.
<P>
There are limits, in the physical organization of man, to the
action of pain. When suffering has reached a given point of
intensity the nervous sensibility becomes incapable of feeling
more. The rule of Nature, in this respect, applies not only to
sufferers in the body, but to sufferers in the mind as well.
Grief, rage, terror, have also their appointed limits. The moral
sensibility, like the nervous sensibility, reaches its period of
absolute exhaustion, and feels no more.
<P>
The capacity for suffering in Mercy had attained its term. Alone
in the library, she could feel the physical relief of repose; she
could vaguely recall Julian's parting words to her, and sadly
wonder what they meant--she could do no more.
<P>
An interval passed; a brief interval of perfect rest.
<P>
She recovered herself sufficiently to be able to look at her
watch and to estimate the lapse of time that might yet pass
before Julian returned to her as he had promised. While her mind
was still languidly following this train of thought she was
disturbed by the ringing of a bell in the hall, used to summon
the servant whose duties were connected with that part of the
house. In leaving the library, Horace had gone out by the door
which led into the hall, and had failed to close it. She plainly
heard the bell--and a moment later (more plainly still) she heard
Lady Janet's voice!
<P>
She started to her feet. Lady Janet's letter was still in the
pocket of her apron--the letter which imperatively commanded her
to abstain from making the very confession that had just passed
her lips! It was near the dinner hour, and the library was the
favorite place in which the mistress of the house and her guests
assembled at that time. It was no matter of doubt; it was an
absolute certainty that Lady Janet had only stopped in the hall
on her way into the room.
<P>
The alternative for Mercy lay between instantly leaving the
library by the dining-room door--or remaining where she was, at
the risk of being sooner or later compelled to own that she had
deliberately disobeyed her benefactress. Exhausted by what she
had already suffered, she stood trembling and irresolute,
incapable of deciding which alternative she should choose.
<P>
Lady Janet's voice, clear and resolute, penetrated into the room.
She was reprimanding the servant who had answered the bell.
<P>
"Is it your duty in my house to look after the lamps?"
<P>
"Yes, my lady."
<P>
"And is it my duty to pay you your wages?""
<P>
"If you please, my lady."
<P>
"Why do I find the light in the hall dim, and the wick of that
lamp smoking? I have not failed in my duty to You. Don't let me
find you failing again in your duty to Me."
<P>
(Never had Lady Janet's voice sounded so sternly in Mercy's ear
as it sounded now. If she spoke with that tone of severity to a
servant who had neglected a lamp, what had her adopted daughter
to expect when she discovered that her entreaties and her
commands had been alike set at defiance?)
<P>
Having administered her reprimand, Lady Janet had not done with
the servant yet. She had a question to put to him next.
<P>
"Where is Miss Roseberry?"
<P>
"In the library, my lady."
<P>
Mercy returned to the couch. She could stand no longer; she had
not even resolution enough left to lift her eyes to the door.
<P>
Lady Janet came in more rapidly than usual. She advanced to the
couch, and tapped Mercy playfully on the cheek with two of her
fingers.
<P>
"You lazy child! Not dressed for dinner? Oh, fie, fie!"
<P>
Her tone was as playfully affectionate as the action which had
accompanied her words. In speechless astonishment Mercy looked up
at her.
<P>
Always remarkable for the taste and splendor of her dress, Lady
Janet had on this occasion surpassed herself. There she stood
revealed in her grandest velvet, her richest jewelry, her finest
lace--with no one to entertain at the dinner-table but the
ordinary members of the circle at Mablethorpe House. Noticing
this as strange to begin with, Mercy further observed, for the
first time in her experience, that Lady Janet's eyes avoided
meeting hers. The old lady took her place companionably on the
couch; she ridiculed her "lazy child's" plain dress, without an
ornament of any sort on it, with her best grace; she
affectionately put her arm round Mercy's waist, and rearranged
with her own hand the disordered locks of Mercy's hair--but the
instant Mercy herself looked at her, Lady Janet's eyes discovered
something supremely interesting in the familiar objects that
surrounded her on the library walls.
<P>
How were these changes to be interpreted? To what possible
conclusion did they point?
<P>
Julian's profounder knowledge of human nature, if Julian had been
present, might have found a clew to the mystery. _He_ might have
surmised (incredible as it was) that Mercy's timidity before Lady
Janet was fully reciprocated by Lady Janet's timidity before
Mercy. It was even so. The woman whose immovable composure had
conquered Grace Roseberry's utmost insolence in the hour of her
triumph--the woman who, without once flinching, had faced every
other consequence of her resolution to ignore Mercy's true
position in the house--quailed for the first time when she found
herself face to face with the very person for who m she had
suffered and sacrificed so much. She had shrunk from the meeting
with Mercy, as Mercy had shrunk from the meeting with _her_. The
splendor of her dress meant simply that, when other excuses for
delaying the meeting downstairs had all been exhausted, the
excuse of a long, and elaborate toilet had been tried next. Even
the moments occupied in reprimanding the servant had been moments
seized on as the pretext for another delay. The hasty entrance
into the room, the nervous assumption of playfulness in language
and manner, the evasive and wandering eyes, were all referable to
the same cause. In the presence of others, Lady Janet had
successfully silenced the protest of her own inbred delicacy and
inbred sense of honor. In the presence of Mercy, whom she loved
with a mother's love--in the presence of Mercy, for whom she had
stooped to deliberate concealment of the truth--all that was high
and noble in the woman's nature rose in her and rebuked her. What
will the daughter of my adoption, the child of my first and last
experience of maternal love, think of me, now that I have made
myself an accomplice in the fraud of which she is ashamed? How
can I look her in the face, when I have not hesitated, out of
selfish consideration for my own tranquillity, to forbid that
frank avowal of the truth which her finer sense of duty had
spontaneously bound her to make? Those were the torturing
questions in Lady Janet's mind, while her arm was wound
affectionately round Mercy's waist, while her fingers were
busying themselves familiarly with the arrangement of Mercy's
hair. Thence, and thence only, sprang the impulse which set her
talking, with an uneasy affectation of frivolity, of any topic
within the range of conversation, so long as it related to the
future, and completely ignored the present and the past.
<P>
"The winter here is unendurable," Lady Janet began. "I have been
thinking, Grace, about what we had better do next."
<P>
Mercy started. Lady Janet had called her "Grace." Lady Janet was
still deliberately assuming to be innocent of the faintest
suspicion of the truth.
<P>
" No," resumed her ladyship, affecting to misunderstand Mercy's
movement, "you are not to go up now and dress. There is no time,
and I am quite ready to excuse you. You are a foil to me, my
dear. You have reached the perfection of shabbiness. Ah! I
remember when I had my whims and fancies too, and when I looked
well in anything I wore, just as you do. No more of that. As I
was saying, I have been thinking and planning what we are to do.
We really can't stay here. Cold one day, and hot the next--what a
climate! As for society, what do we lose if we go away? There is
no such thing as society now. Assemblies of well-dressed mobs
meet at each other's houses, tear each other's clothes, tread on
each other's toes. If you are particularly lucky, you sit on the
staircase, you get a tepid ice, and you hear vapid talk in slang
phrases all round you. There is modern society. If we had a good
opera, it would be something to stay in London for. Look at the
programme for the season on that table--promising as much as
possible on paper, and performing as little as possible on the
stage. The same works, sung by the same singers year after year,
to the same stupid people--in short the dullest musical evenings
in Europe. No! the more I think of it, the more plainly I
perceive that there is but one sensible choice before us: we must
go abroad. Set that pretty head to work; choose north or south,
east or west; it's all the same to me. Where shall we go?"
<P>
Mercy looked at her quickly as she put the question.
<P>
Lady Janet, more quickly yet, looked away at the programme of the
opera-house. Still the same melancholy false pretenses! still the
same useless and cruel delay! Incapable of enduring the position
now forced upon her, Mercy put her hand into the pocket of her
apron, and drew from it Lady Janet's letter.
<P>
"Will your ladyship forgive me," she began, in faint, faltering
tones, "if I venture on a painful subject? I hardly dare
acknowledge--" In spite of her resolution to speak out plainly,
the memory of past love and past kindness prevailed with her; the
next words died away on her lips. She could only hold up the
letter.
<P>
Lady Janet declined to see the letter. Lady Janet suddenly became
absorbed in the arrangement of her bracelets.
<P>
"I know what you daren't acknowledge, you foolish child!" she
exclaimed. "You daren't acknowledge that you are tired of this
dull house. My dear! I am entirely of your opinion--I am weary of
my own magnificence; I long to be living in one snug little room,
with one servant to wait on me. I'll tell you what we will do. We
will go to Paris, in the first place. My excellent Migliore,
prince of couriers, shall be the only person in attendance. He
shall take a lodging for us in one of the unfashionable quarters
of Paris. We will rough it, Grace (to use the slang phrase),
merely for a change. We will lead what they call a 'Bohemian
life.' I know plenty of writers and painters and actors in
Paris--the liveliest society in the world, my dear, until one
gets tired of them. We will dine at the restaurant, and go to the
play, and drive about in shabby little hired carriages. And when
it begins to get monotonous (which it is only too sure to do!) we
will spread our wings and fly to Italy, and cheat the winter in
that way. There is a plan for you! Migliore is in town. I will
send to him this evening, and we will start to-morrow."
<P>
Mercy made another effort.
<P>
"I entreat your ladyship to pardon me," she resumed. "I have
something serious to say. I am afraid--"
<P>
"I understand. You are afraid of crossing the Channel, and you
don't like to acknowledge it. Pooh! The passage barely lasts two
hours; we will shut ourselves up in a private cabin. I will send
at once--the courier may be engaged. Ring the bell."
<P>
"Lady Janet, I must submit to my hard lot. I cannot hope to
associate myself again with any future plans of yours--"
<P>
"What! you are afraid of our 'Bohemian life' in Paris? Observe
this, Grace! If there is one thing I hate more than another, it
is 'an old head on young shoulders.' I say no more. Ring the
bell."
<P>
"This cannot go on, Lady Janet! No words can say how unworthy I
feel of your kindness, how ashamed I am--"
<P>
"Upon my honor, my dear, I agree with you. You _ought_ to be
ashamed, at your age, of making me get up to ring the bell."
<P>
Her obstinacy was immovable; she attempted to rise from the
couch. But one choice was left to Mercy. She anticipated Lady
Janet, and rang the bell.
<P>
The man-servant came in. He had his little letter-tray in his
hand, with a card on it, and a sheet of paper beside the card,
which looked like an open letter.
<P>
"You know where my courier lives when he is in London?' asked
Lady Janet.
<P>
"Yes, my lady."
<P>
"Send one of the grooms to him on horseback; I am in a hurry. The
courier is to come here without fail to-morrow morning--in time
for the tidal train to Paris. You understand?"
<P>
"Yes, my lady."
<P>
"What have you got there? Anything for me?"
<P>
"For Miss Roseberry, my lady."
<P>
As he answered, the man handed the card and the open letter to
Mercy.
<P>
"The lady is waiting in the morning-room, miss. She wished me to
say she has time to spare, and she will wait for you if you are
not ready yet."
<P>
Having delivered his message in those terms, he withdrew.
<P>
Mercy read the name on the card. The matron had arrived! She
looked at the letter next. It appeared to be a printed circular,
with some lines in pencil added on the empty page. Printed lines
and written lines swam before her eyes. She felt, rather than
saw, Lady Janet's attention steadily and suspiciously fixed on
her. With the matron's arrival the foredoomed end of the flimsy
false pretenses and the cruel delays had come.
<P>
"A friend of yours, my dear?"
<P>
"Yes, Lady Janet."
<P>
"Am I acquainted with her?"
<P>
"I think not, Lady Janet."
<P>
"You appear to be agitated. Does your visitor bring bad news? Is
there anything that I can do for you?"
<P>
"You can add--immeasurably add, madam-- to all your past
kindness, if you will only bear with me and forgive me."
<P>
"Bear with you and forgive you? I don't understand."
<P>
"I will try to explain . Whatever else you may think of me, Lady
Janet, for God's sake don't think me ungrateful!"
<P>
Lady Janet held up her hand for silence.
<P>
"I dislike explanations," she said, sharply. "Nobody ought to
know that better than you. Perhaps the lady's letter will explain
for you. Why have you not looked at it yet?"
<P>
"I am in great trouble, madam, as you noticed just now--"
<P>
"Have you any objection to my knowing who your visitor is?"
<P>
"No, Lady Janet."
<P>
"Let me look at her card, then."
<P>
Mercy gave the matron's card to Lady Janet, as she had given the
matron's telegram to Horace.
<P>
Lady Janet read the name on the card--considered--decided that it
was a name quite unknown to her--and looked next at the address:
"Western District Refuge, Milburn Road."
<P>
"A lady connected with a Refuge?" she said, speaking to herself;
"and calling here by appointment--if I remember the servant's
message? A strange time to choose, if she has come for a
subscription!"
<P>
She paused. Her brow contracted; her face hardened. A word from
her would now have brought the interview to its inevitable end,
and she refused to speak the word. To the last moment she
persisted in ignoring the truth! Placing the card on the couch at
her side, she pointed with her long yellow-white forefinger to
the printed letter lying side by side with her own letter on
Mercy's lap.
<P>
"Do you mean to read it, or not?" she asked.
<P>
Mercy lifted her eyes, fast filling with tears, to Lady Janet's
face.
<P>
"May I beg that your ladyship will read it for me?" she said--and
placed the matron's letter in Lady Janet's hand.
<P>
It was a printed circular announcing a new development in the
charitable work of the Refuge. Subscribers were informed that it
had been decided to extend the shelter and the training of the
institution (thus far devoted to fallen women alone) so as to
include destitute and helpless children found wandering in the
streets. The question of the number of children to be thus
rescued and protected was left dependent, as a matter of course,
on the bounty of the friends of the Refuge, the cost of the
maintenance of each child being stated at the lowest possible
rate. A list of influential persons who had increased their
subscriptions so as to cover the cost, and a brief statement of
the progress already made with the new work, completed the
appeal, and brought the circular to its end.
<P>
The lines traced in pencil (in the matron's handwriting) followed
on the blank page.
<P>
"Your letter tells me, my dear, that you would like--remembering
your own childhood--to be employed when you return among us in
saving other poor children left helpless on the world. Our
circular will inform you that I am able to meet your wishes. My
first errand this evening in your neighborhood was to take charge
of a poor child--a little girl--who stands sadly in need of our
care. I have ventured to bring her with me, thinking she might
help to reconcile you to the coming change in your life. You will
find us both waiting to go back with you to the old home. I write
this instead of saying it, hearing from the servant that you are
not alone, and being unwilling to intrude myself, as a stranger,
on the lady of the house."
<P>
Lady Janet read the penciled lines, as she had read the printed
sentences, aloud. Without a word of comment she laid the letter
where she had laid the card; and, rising from her seat, stood for
a moment in stern silence, looking at Mercy. The sudden change in
her which the letter had produced--quietly as it had taken
place--was terrible to see. On the frowning brow, in the flashing
eyes, on the hardened lips, outraged love and outraged pride
looked down on the lost woman, and said, as if in words, You have
roused us at last.
<P>
"If that letter means anything,'' she said, "it means you are
about to leave my house. There can be but one reason for your
taking such a step as that."
<P>
"It is the only atonement I can make, madam"
<P>
"I see another letter on your lap. Is it my letter?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Have you read it?"
<P>
"I have read it."
<P>
"Have you seen Horace Holmcroft?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Have you told Horace Holmcroft--"
<P>
"Oh, Lady Janet--"
<P>
"Don't interrupt me. Have you told Horace Holmcroft what my
letter positively forbade you to communicate, either to him or to
any living creature? I want no protestations and excuses. Answer
me instantly, and answer in one word--Yes, or No."
<P>
Not even that haughty language, not even those pitiless tones,
could extinguish in Mercy's heart the sacred memories of past
kindness and past love. She fell on her knees--her outstretched
hands touched Lady Janet's dress. Lady Janet sharply drew her
dress away, and sternly repeated her last words.
<P>
"Yes? or No?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
She had owned it at last! To this end Lady Janet had submitted to
Grace Roseberry; had offended Horace Holmcroft; had stooped, for
the first time in her life, to concealments and compromises that
degraded her. After all that she had sacrificed and suffered,
there Mercy knelt at her feet, self-convicted of violating her
commands, trampling on her feelings, deserting her house! And who
was the woman who had done this? The same woman who had
perpetrated the fraud, and who had persisted in the fraud until
her benefactress had descended to become her accomplice. Then,
and then only, she had suddenly discovered that it was her sacred
duty to tell the truth!
<P>
In proud silence the great lady met the blow that had fallen on
her. In proud silence she turned her back on her adopted daughter
and walked to the door.
<P>
Mercy made her last appeal to the kind friend whom she had
offended--to the second mother whom she had loved.
<P>
"Lady Janet! Lady Janet! Don't leave me without a word. Oh,
madam, try to feel for me a little! I am returning to a life of
humiliation--the shadow of my old disgrace is falling on me once
more. We shall never meet again. Even though I have not deserved
it, let my repentance plead with you! Say you forgive me!"
<P>
Lady Janet turned round on the threshold of the door.
<P>
"I never forgive ingratitude," she said. "Go back to the Refuge."
<P>
The door opened and closed on her. Mercy was alone again in the
room.
<P>
Unforgiven by Horace, unforgiven by Lady Janet! She put her hands
to her burning head and tried to think. Oh, for the cool air of
the night! Oh, for the friendly shelter of the Refuge! She could
feel those sad longings in her: it was impossible to think.
<P>
She rang the bell--and shrank back the instant she had done it.
Had _she_ any right to take that liberty? She ought to have
thought of it before she rang. Habit--all habit. How many
hundreds of times she had rung the bell at Mablethorpe House!
<P>
The servant came in. She amazed the man-- she spoke to him so
timidly: she even apologized for troubling him!
<P>
"I am sorry to disturb you. Will you be so kind as to say to the
lady that I am ready for her?"
<P>
"Wait to give that message," said a voice behind them, "until you
hear the bell rung again."
<P>
Mercy looked round in amazement. Julian had returned to the
library by the dining-room door.
