<p>It seemed to strike all three of the friends at the same moment
that they had shown a strange forgetfulness of the occasion. A
sudden impulse had led them into a test of skill, that had continued
fully a quarter of an hour, during which there was no thought
on the part of any one of the gravity of their situation.</p>

<p>But a little while before, both Fred Linden and Terry Clark were
in distress on account of their friends, while their own position
(believing as they did that there were Winnebagos in front as
well as in the rear), ought to have driven away all inclination
for sport or amusement. One of their strongest desires was the
presence of Deerfoot, that they might have his counsel and help.
Here he was, and no reference had been made to the subjects uppermost
in their minds. Now that he took his seat near them by the camp-fire,
as if to invite their confidence, they quickly returned to the
all important business.</p>

<p>First of all, they asked for his experience since their separation
the night before. He gave only a part of it. He told nothing about
his conflict with the Wolf and his companion, which resulted in
the death of both, but said that he had kept watch of the Winnebagos
until morning, when he saw them start for the camp in the mountains.
He learned from their signaling that they had other warriors in
the neighborhood, and there could be no doubt that an attack was
intended upon the Hunters of the Ozark. Nevertheless the Shawanoe
kept in their vicinity, until they approached the open prairie
of which mention has been make. Then he decided to pass them and
join his young friends.</p>

<p>Feeling no doubt that the latter were following the right trail
(several examinations which he made satisfied him that they were
doing so), he left it altogether, and took a shorter route across
the country. He was so familiar with it that he could easily do
this. His intention was to strike the main path again at the crossing,
where they had such a narrow escape from the cyclone; but he calculated
that by nightfall they would be a considerable distance beyond,
and he wished to test their watchfulness when left to themselves.
So he came back to the trail about half way between that point
and the creek which they had crossed by means of the canoe. He
saw from an examination of the ground that he was ahead of them,
so he sauntered forward, firing off his gun where a turn in the
path made it seem to come from one side instead of in front of
them. He did this as he explained with a view of warning them
to keep their eyes open. It soon began growing dark and he kept
on until he reached the stream, where he decided to wait and see
what they would do.</p>

<p>He was as surprised as they when they brought forth the little
canoe and pushed themselves across by means of the pole which
Fred Linden himself cut. He followed them, easily wading the stream.
After that he indulged in a little diversion with which you are
familiar.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it strange, Deerfoot," said Fred, "that we should have
found that canoe?"</p>

<p>He nodded his head to signify that he thought it was.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea how it got there?"</p>

<p>"He who owned the boat hid it under the bushes."</p>

<p>"But there are no Indian villages within a great many miles of
this place&mdash;is that not so?"</p>

<p>He gave another affirmative nod.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea of who the owner can be?"</p>

<p>A third affirmative nod followed.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Fred in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot."</p>

<p>"What! Does that little canoe belong to <em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>"Deerfoot made it and hid it under the bushes: why did not my
brothers use the paddle?"</p>

<p>"We hunted all round, but could not find it."</p>

<p>"It was within reach of my brother's hands; it was covered with
leaves."</p>

<p>"And so the boat is yer own?" repeated Terry; "why that looks
as if ye lived somewhere in this neighborhood; is such the case,
owld boy?"</p>

<p>The question did not seem to please the Shawanoe. He was sitting
directly in front of his young friends, who looked earnestly in
his face. He made no answer to Terry's question, but continued
looking among the coals, as if he was pondering some other matter
that had thus been brought to mind. Fred shook his head at Terry
as a warning that he should not repeat his query, and the latter
was wise enough not to do so; but the friends concluded from that
moment that the wandering young Shawanoe made his home at no great
distance from where all three were at that moment sitting in the
wilderness. And they were right.</p>

<p>A minute later, Deerfoot raised his head and signified that he
wished to know in turn what had befallen them since they parted
company twenty-four hours before. You will admit that each had
a stirring story to tell and he told it. The Shawanoe first listened
to Terry's account of his ride on the back of the wounded buffalo,
and, when it was finished, he quietly remarked to his young friend
that he had done well.</p>

<p>Though he showed no emotion, it was clear to both boys that he
felt the most concern in the experience of Fred Linden. He said
nothing until the narrator was through, including the account
of the cyclone. Deerfoot had heard the noise made by the latter,
but he was so far removed from its path that he saw none of its
fearful effects, and in fact cared little about it, for he had
seen the same thing more than once before.</p>

<p>But that which interested him was the account of Fred Linden's
meeting with the Winnebago horse thieves. This was the first knowledge
he received that any of their enemies were mounted on animals.
Deerfoot had turned off the main trail so early in the day that
he missed them altogether. When he came back to the path, near
where the three were in camp at that moment, and he examined the
ground for signs of the footprints of the boys, there were none
that had been made by the hoofs of horses. They had struck the
trail further to the north, taking a different course from the
camp where they had stolen the animals.</p>

<p>Fred blushed under the warm compliments of Deerfoot on his coolness,
bravery and skill in the presence of the three Winnebagos. You
will agree that it was a daring exploit indeed, which would have
done credit to a veteran frontiersman. It could not have been
otherwise to draw such warm praise from the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>But the compliments could well be deferred to some other season.
The fact that three Indians had stolen the same number of horses
from the Hunters of the Ozark, and then had ridden leisurely away
to meet their friends, showed that they had great confidence in
themselves, doubtless caused by the belief that they were safe
against any attempt to recover the property.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot," said Fred, after there had been a full exchange of
experiences; "we stopped here only because we could not keep to
the trail in the darkness. Don't you think it best that we should
now go on, since you will not have the same trouble that we did?"</p>

<p>He shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p>"It is not far to the camp of my brothers; the Winnebagos are
a long ways back on the trail; they will not come up with us;
my brothers have a chance to sleep; they may have no chance when
they reach the cabin; let them sleep now."</p>

<p>The natural inference from this remark was that he believed nothing
more was to be apprehended from the Winnebagos, so long as our
three friends were on their way to the cabin of the Hunters of
the Ozark. The danger would now be transferred to that point.</p>

<p>"Is it not likely that some of the red men are between us and
our friends?" asked Fred, as though their guide had not thought
of every contingency.</p>

<p>"There is none," was the quiet answer, and then he added the
explanation. The Winnebagos, as soon as they had captured the
horses, had mounted them and ridden off to meet Black Bear and
the rest, so as to combine with them in the attack upon the cabin
in the mountains. Being so few in numbers, they did not dare stay
in the neighborhood, but were certain to come back with the others.</p>

<p>The theft of the animals was no part of the original plan of
the red men, and was therefore what may be considered poor generalship,
since it was likely to draw attention to the presence of hostiles
and to put the Hunters of the Ozark on their guard.</p>

<p>Deerfoot made no such remark at the time, but he afterward expressed
his regret that he had not joined Fred and Terry earlier in the
day, so that he could have been with them when they met the horse
thieves. Had he done so, there can be no doubt that they would
have recaptured every one of the animals, even if they had had
to shoot each thief from the back of his stolen steed. Such a
result would have changed the whole course of the events that
followed.</p>

<p>Since the Shawanoe advised them to stay where they were until
morning, the natural query of the lads was as to the degree of
danger they ran. They had thought there was little to be feared
from Indians, but after the fire was started, both had misgivings&mdash;afterward
intensified no doubt by the little trick played upon them by Deerfoot.</p>

<p>He assured them that there was nothing to be feared from Indians.
There was and would be none near them through the night. They
were at a safe distance from the trail, so that if any one should
pass back or forth he could not possibly catch a glimpse of the
camp.</p>

<p>"I never dispute a man's sintimints," said Terry, "onless it
happens to disagraa with me own, so I'll say ye are right because
we think the same way; but it's within me own ricolliction that
whin ye enj'yed the honor of our coompany night before last, ye
kipt guard all the night; Frederick and mesilf will now return
the coompliment and take charge of the honors oursilves. If ye
have any disputation that ye want to inter into, we'll sittle
it by maans of a wristling match."</p>

<p>Deerfoot was inclined at first to act as sentinel, just as he
had done before, but he had already declared that there was nothing
to be feared, and his friends were so in earnest that he could
not well refuse their request. He would have preferred that they
should gain all the sleep they could, so as to lay up a stock,
as may be said, against what was likely to come at the cabin,
but he yielded. He agreed to their wishes, and in doing so, indulged
in one of his smiles, the depth of whose meaning neither of the
youths fully comprehended. In fact it simply meant that he understood
their ability in that respect better than they did themselves.</p>

<p>And so, after reading his Bible, a portion of it aloud, he lay
down upon the blanket of Terry, as he did two nights before, and
soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to obsarve the same," remarked Terry; "for the good
lookin' spalpeen must be in naad of slumber. I say, Fred, did
ye iver saa the loikes of him? We must git him to run a race and
jump and swim and stand on his head and show jist what he can
do. I'm glad as I say to obsarve that he is aslaap, for he must
naad the same. I say, Fred, let's stay awake till daylight, so
as to fool him."</p>

<p>"I am glad to do that in return for the watch he kept over us
the other night; but if you and I undertake to sit up at the same
time we shall fail. So I'll lie down and sleep awhile. When you
find yourself getting drowsy, wake me up and then I shall be able
to keep my eyes open until morning. In that way Deerfoot may have
a whole night of rest."</p>

<p>"I'm agraaable to the same."</p>

<p>The plan was carried out, that is, a part of it, Fred Linden
soon dropped asleep, and, within an hour, Terry Clark did the
same. When Deerfoot threw his blanket off his face and assumed
the sitting position, he saw just what he expected to see and
he allowed them to slumber peacefully until daylight.</p>
