<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The young rancher was yet some distance from the prostrate foe,
when his quick eye discovered something. It was a crimson stain
on the snow near the stock of the Indian's rifle.</p>

<p>The miscreant was wounded; he was not shamming.</p>

<p>It was remarkable that with this discovery came an utter revulsion
of feeling on the part of the youth. While he had been ready up
to that moment to drive his bullet through the bronzed skull,
an emotion of pity now took possession of him. He forgot that
the fellow had tried with desperate endeavor to take his life,
and he knew he expected no mercy at his hands. Nevertheless, as
a Christian, he could not withhold his sympathy, nor could he
forget that simple but sublime role of the good Samaritan.</p>

<p>Touching his heels against the ribs of Jack, the pony increased
his pace, but had not yet reached the prostrate figure when Warren
experienced the greatest surprise of all.</p>

<p>The Indian on the ground was Starcus!</p>

<p>The next moment young Starr dropped from his saddle, and was
bending over him.</p>

<p>"I hardly expected this, Starcus," he said, with a gentle reproof
in his voice. "You seem to have changed your mind since this morning,
when you shot the grizzly."</p>

<p>Indian though he was the fellow's painted face was darkened by
an expression of deep pain, whether the result of his hurt or
of his mental disquietude no one can say.</p>

<p>"I am not your friend; I am the enemy of all white men."</p>

<p>"You have proven that since you turned against those who would
do you no harm. But I have no wish to reproach you; your arm is
badly hurt; let me give you what help I can."</p>

<p>"I want no help," replied the Sioux, resolutely compressing his
thin lips; "go away and leave me alone."</p>

<p>"I shall not; I am your master, and shall do as I please with
you."</p>

<p>"I tell you to leave me alone; I do not want your help," added
Starcus fiercely.</p>

<p>"You shan't hinder me, old fellow; this is for old times."</p>

<p>And paying no heed to the sufferer, who struggled with pitiful
awkwardness to keep him off, Starr ripped a piece from the lining
of his coat, and began bandaging the bleeding arm. The Sioux still
resisted, but while doing so showed a weakness rare in one of
his race by fainting dead away.</p>

<p>The youth made no effort to revive him until he had completed
his hasty but rude swathing of the arm, which was badly shattered
by a bullet. Then he flung some snow in the face of the fellow,
who had already shown signs of coming to.</p>

<p>Starcus looked around for a moment in a bewildered way, and then
fixed his gaze on the wounded member, now bound so that the flow
of blood was stopped. Then he turned his dark eyes on the face
of the youth bending over him, with an indescribable expression,
and said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"I tried my best to kill you, Warren."</p>

<p>"But you didn't; and I am unharmed, and am your friend."</p>

<p>"And why are you my friend? I do not deserve it," continued the
Sioux, with his black eyes still centred on the face of the athletic
youth.</p>

<p>"If you and I had what we deserved where would we be? Give it
no further thought."</p>

<p>Starcus now held his peace for a full minute, during which he
never once removed his gaze from the countenance of the good Samaritan.
Strange thoughts must have passed through his brain. When he spoke
it was in a voice as gentle as a girl's.</p>

<p>"Can you forgive me for what I have done?"</p>

<p>"With my whole heart."</p>

<p>"But I tried my best to kill you."</p>

<p>"Are you sorry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sorry as I can be."</p>

<p>"Then I repeat, I forgive you; but are you able to rise to your
feet?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I pretended I was not, so as to bring you closer to me.
Had not my arm been hurt I would have shot you."</p>

<p>"I am not sure of that," replied Warren, with a curious smile;
"I suspected it, and was on my guard. At the first move on your
part I would have fired. I was not sure even that you were hurt
at all until I saw blood on the snow. But it will not do for you
to stay here. Let me help you to your feet."</p>

<p>Starcus proved that the rest of his limbs were uninjured by coming
as nimbly as an acrobat to an upright posture.</p>

<p>"You have done all you can for me, and I thank you; now do not
wait any longer."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Warren, suspecting his meaning, but desirous
of testing him a little further.</p>

<p>"Look toward the ridge," was the significant reply.</p>

<p>The inaction of the other Sioux, as has been intimated, was due
to their belief that Starcus was master of the situation. Even
when they saw him pitch from the back of his pony they must have
thought it a part of the strategy designed to lure the young man
to his death.</p>

<p>But the sight of the youth bending over the prostrate figure
of their comrade told the truth. Starcus had been wounded, and
was at the mercy of his conqueror.</p>

<p>Much as the warriors were disappointed, they were not the ones
to allow the brave fellow to be killed without an effort on their
part to save him.</p>

<p>Warren had suspected the truth, and, while seeming to be unaware
of it, he observed several of the warriors running at full speed
from the ridge out on the snowy prairie. They were still a goodly
distance away, and he calculated just how far it was prudent to
allow them to approach before appealing to Jack, standing within
a few paces and awaiting his pleasure.</p>

<p>He was hoping for just such a warning from Starcus as he had
received. He wanted it as a "guarantee of good faith," and when
it came all doubts of the sincerity of his repentance were gone.</p>

<p>Still, although this particular Sioux might feel gratitude for
the undeserved mercy shown to him, there was no hope of anything
of that nature from his companions. Had Warren counted upon that,
he would have made the mistake of his life. He and his friend
had done the bucks too much ill to be forgiven for an act of kindness
to one of their number, even though it was actuated by a motive
whose nobility they could not fail to understand.</p>

<p>"That is kind of you, to warn me of my danger," remarked the
youth. "I shall not forget it. But they are so far off that I
need not hurry to mount my horse."</p>

<p>"Do not wait too long; they will soon be here."</p>

<p>"I have my pony, and they are on foot."</p>

<p>"But they can run fast."</p>

<p>"I will leave in time; but, Starcus, if you are really a friend
of mine, you have the chance to prove it by being a friend of
Tim; he is a prisoner with your people, and in need of your good
offices."</p>

<p>"I cannot help him," was the reply, accompanied by a shake of
the head.</p>

<p>"I only ask that you shall do what you can; I am sure you will,
whether it results in good to him or not."</p>

<p>"Give yourself no hope of that; it will be hard for me to explain
why I was spared by you."</p>

<p>"But that was my own affair; surely they cannot suspect us of
any collusion."</p>

<p>"You do not know my people as I do."</p>

<p>"But I am not the first white man that has shown mercy to a helpless
foe; they know that as well as you and I."</p>

<p>"You are waiting too long, Warren; they will soon be here," added
the warrior, with an apprehensive glance toward the ridge, from
which his people were approaching with alarming swiftness.</p>

<p>"Well, good-by, Starcus."</p>

<p>He grasped the left hand of the Sioux, who warmly returned the
pressure with the words, "Good-by, Warren."</p>

<p>Then Warren Starr, not a moment too soon, sprang into the saddle
and galloped away.</p>
