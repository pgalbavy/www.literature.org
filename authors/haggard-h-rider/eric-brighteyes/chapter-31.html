<p>Now Eric and Skallagrim came to Mosfell in safety, and during all
that ride Brighteyes spoke no word. He rode in silence, and in silence
Skallagrim rode after him. The heart of Skallagrim was broken because
of the sorrow which his drunkenness had brought about, and the heart of
Eric was buried in Gudruda’s grave.
</p>
<p>On Mosfell Eric found four of his own men, two of whom had been among
those that the people of Gizur and Swanhild had driven from Gudruda’s
ship before they fired her. For no fight had been made on the ship.
There also he found Jon, who had been loosed from his bands in the booth
by one who heard his cries as he rode past. Now when Jon saw Brighteyes,
he told him all, and fell at Eric’s feet and wept because he had
betrayed him in his fear.
</p><p>But Eric spoke no angry word to him. Stooping down he raised him,
saying, “Thou wast never overstout of heart, Jon, and thou art scarcely
to be blamed because thou didst speak rather than die in torment, though
perhaps some had chosen so to die and not to speak. Now I am a luckless
man, and all things happen as they are fated, and the words of Atli come
true, as was to be looked for. The Norns, against whom none may stand,
did but work their will through thy mouth, Jon; so grieve no more for
that which cannot be undone.”
</p><p>Then he turned away, but Jon wept long and loudly.
</p><p>That night Eric slept well and dreamed no dreams. But on the morrow
he woke at dawn, and clothed himself and ate. Then he called his men
together, and with them Skallagrim. They came and stood before him, and
Eric, drawing Whitefire, leaned upon it and spoke:
</p><p>“Hearken, mates,” he said: “I know this, that my hours are short and
death draws on. My years have been few and evil, and I cannot read the
purpose of my life. She whom I loved has been slain by the witchcraft of
Swanhild and the coward hand of Gizur the murderer, and I go to seek
her where she waits. I am very glad to go, for now I have no more joy in
life, being but a luckless man; it is an ill world, friends, and all
the ways are red with blood. I have shed much blood, though but one life
haunts me now at the last, and that is the life of Atli the Earl, for he
was no match for my might and he is dead because of my sin. With my own
blood I will wash away the blood of Atli, and then I seek another place,
leaving nothing but a tale to be told in the ingle when fall the winter
snows. For to this end we all come at the last, and it matters little if
it find us at midday or at nightfall. We live in sorrow, we die in pain
and darkness: for this is the curse that the Gods have laid upon men
and each must taste it in his season. But I have sworn that no more men
shall die for me. I will fight the last great fight alone; for I know
this: I shall not easily be overcome, and with my fallen foes I will
tread on Bifrost Bridge. Therefore, farewell! When the bones of Eric
Brighteyes lie in their barrow, or are picked by ravens on the mountain
side, Gizur will not trouble to hunt out those who clung to him, if
indeed Gizur shall live to tell the tale. Nor need ye fear the hate of
Swanhild, for she aims her spears at me alone. Go, therefore, and when
I am dead, do not forget me, and do not seek to avenge me, for Death the
avenger of all will find them also.”
</p><p>Now Eric’s men heard and groaned aloud, saying that they would die with
him, for they loved Eric one and all. Only Skallagrim said nothing.
</p><p>Then Brighteyes spoke again: “Hear me, comrades. If ye will not go, my
blood will be on your heads, for I will ride out alone, and meet the men
of Gizur in the plain and fall there fighting.”
</p><p>Then one by one they crept away to seek their horses in the dell. And
each man as he went came to Eric and kissed his hand, then passed thence
weeping. Jon was the last to go, except Skallagrim only, and he was so
moved that he could not speak at all.
</p><p>It was this Jon who, in after years, when he was grown very old,
wandered from stead to stead telling the deeds of Eric Brighteyes, and
always finding a welcome because of his tale, till at length, as he
journeyed, he was overtaken by a snowstorm and buried in a drift. For
Jon, who lacked much, had this gift: he had a skald’s tongue. Men have
always held that it was to the honour of Jon that he told the tale thus,
hiding nothing, seeing that some of it is against himself.
</p>
<p>Now when all had gone, Eric looked at Skallagrim, who still stood near
him, axe in hand.
</p><p>“Wherefore goest thou not, drunkard?” he said. “Surely thou wilt find
ale and mead in the vales or oversea. Here there is none. Hasten! I
would be alone!”
</p><p>Now the great body of Skallagrim shook with grief and shame, and the red
blood poured up beneath his dark sin. Then he spoke in a thick voice:
</p><p>“I did not think to live to hear such words from the lips of Eric
Brighteyes. They are well earned, yet it is unmanly of thee, lord, thus
to taunt one who loves thee. I would sooner die as Swanhild said yonder
thrall should die than live to listen to such words. I have sinned
against thee, indeed, and because of my sin my heart is broken. Hast
thou, then, never sinned that thou wouldst tear it living from my breast
as eagles tear a foundered horse? Think on thine own sins, Eric, and
pity mine! Taunt me thus once more or bid me go once more and I will go
indeed! I will go thus--on the edge of yonder gulf thou didst
overcome me by thy naked might, and there I swore fealty to thee, Eric
Brighteyes. Many a year have we wandered side by side, and, standing
back to back, have struck many a blow. I am minded to do this: to stand
by thee in the last great fight that draws on and to die there with
thee. I have loved no other man save thee, and I am too old to seek new
lords. Yet, if still thou biddest me, I will go thus. Where I swore my
oath to thee, there I will end it. For I will lay me down on the brink
of yonder gulf, as once I lay when thy hand was at my throat, and call
out that thou art no more my lord and I am no more thy thrall. Then I
will roll into the depths beneath, and by this death of shame thou shalt
be freed of me, Eric Brighteyes.”
</p><p>Eric looked at the great man--he looked long and sadly. Then he spoke:
</p><p>“Skallagrim Lambstail, thou hast a true heart. I too have sinned, and
now I put away thy sin, although Gudruda is dead through thee and I must
die because of thee. Stay by me if thou wilt and let us fall together.”
</p><p>Then Skallagrim came to Eric, and, kneeling before him, took his hands
and kissed them.
</p><p>“Now I am once more a man,” he said, “and I know this: we two shall die
such a great death that it will be well to have lived to die it!” and he
arose and shouted:
</p><pre>
     “A! hai! A! hai! I see foes pass in pride!
     A! hai! A! hai! Valkyries ride the wind!
     Hear the song of the sword!
     Whitefire is aloft--aloft!
     Bare is the axe of the Baresark!
     Croak, ye nesting ravens;
     Flap your wings, ye eagles,
     For bright is Mosfell’s cave with blood!
     Lap! lap! thou Grey Wolf,
     Laugh aloud, Odin!
     “Laugh till shake the golden doors;
     Heroes’ feet are set on Bifrost,
     Open, ye hundred gates!
     A! hai! A! hai! red runs the fray!
     A! hai! A! hai! Valkyries ride the wind!”</pre>
<p>Then Skallagrim turned and went to clean his harness and the golden helm
of Eric.
</p>
<p>Now at Coldback Gizur spoke with Swanhild.
</p><p>“Thou hast brought the greatest shame upon me,” he said, “for thou hast
caused me to slay a sleeping woman. Knowest thou that my own men will
scarcely speak with me? I have come to this evil pass, through love of
thee, that I have slain a sleeping woman!”
</p><p>“It was not my fault that thou didst kill Gudruda,” answered Swanhild;
“surely I thought it was Eric whom thy sword pierced! I have not sought
thy love, Gizur, and I say this to thee: go, if thou wilt, and leave me
alone!”
</p><p>Now Gizur looked at her, and was minded to go; but, as Swanhild knew
well, she held him too fast in the net of her witcheries.
</p><p>“I would go, if I might go!” answered Gizur; “but I am bound to thee for
good or evil, since it is fated that I shall wed thee.”
</p><p>“Thou wilt never wed me while Eric lives,” said Swanhild.
</p><p>Now she spoke thus truthfully, and by chance, as it were, not as driving
Gizur on to slay Eric--for, now that Gudruda was dead, she was in two
minds as to this matter, since, if she might, she still desired to take
Eric to herself--but meaning that while Eric lived she would wed no
other man. But Gizur took it otherwise.
</p><p>“Eric shall certainly die if I may bring it about,” he answered, and
went to speak with his men.
</p><p>Now all were gathered in the yard at Coldback, and that was a great
company. But their looks were heavy because of the shame that Gizur,
Ospakar’s son, had brought upon them by the murder of Gudruda in her
sleep.
</p><p>“Hearken, comrades!” said Gizur: “great shame is come upon me because of
a deed that I have done unwittingly, for I aimed at the eagle Eric and I
have slain the swan Gudruda.”
</p><p>Then a certain old viking in the company, named Ketel, whom Gizur had
hired for the slaying of Eric, spoke:
</p><p>“Man or woman, it is a niddering deed to kill folk in their sleep,
Gizur! It is murder, and no less, and small luck can be hoped for from
the stroke.”
</p><p>Now Gizur felt that his people looked on him askance and heavily, and
knew that it would be hard to show them that he was driven to this deed
against his will, and by the witchcraft of Swanhild. So, as was his
nature, he turned to guile for shelter, like a fox to his hole, and
spoke to them with the tongue of a lawman; for Gizur had great skill in
speech.
</p><p>“That tale was not all true which Eric Brighteyes told you,” he said.
“He was mad with grief, and moreover it seems that he slept, and only
woke to find Gudruda dead. It came about thus: I stood with the lady
Swanhild, and was about to call aloud on Eric to arm himself and come
forth and meet me face to face----”
</p><p>“Then, lord, methinks thou hadst never met another foe,” quoth the
viking Ketel who had spoken first.
</p><p>“When of a sudden,” went on Gizur, taking no note of Ketel’s words, “one
clothed in white sprang from the bed and rushed on me. Then I, thinking
that it was Eric, lifted sword, not to smite, but to ward him away; but
the linen-wearer met the sword and fell down dead. Then I fled, fearing
lest men should wake and trap us, and that is all the tale. It was no
fault of mine if Gudruda died upon the sword.”
</p><p>Thus he spoke, but still men looked doubtfully upon him, for his eye was
the eye of a liar--and Eric, as they knew, did not lie.
</p><p>“It is hard to find the truth between lawman’s brain and tongue,” said
the old viking Ketel. “Eric is no lawman, but a true man, and he sang
another song. I would slay Eric indeed, for between him and me there is
a blood-feud, since my brother died at his hand when, with Whitefire
for a crook, Brighteyes drove armed men like sheep down the hall of
Middalhof--ay and swordless, slew Ospakar. Yet I say that Eric is a
true man, and, whether or no thou art true, Gizur the Lawman, that thou
knowest best--thou and Swanhild the Fatherless, Groa’s daughter. If thou
didst slay Gudruda as thou tellest, say, how come Gudruda’s blood on
Whitefire’s blade? How did it chance, Gizur, that thou heldest Whitefire
in thy hand and not thine own sword? Now I tell thee this: either thou
shalt go up against Eric and clear thyself by blows, or I leave thee;
and methinks there are others among this company who will do the same,
for we have no wish to be partners with murderers and their wickedness.”
</p><p>“Ay, a good word!” said many who stood by. “Let Gizur go up with us to
Mosfell, and there stand face to face with Eric and clear himself by
blows.”
</p><p>“I ask no more,” said Gizur; “we will ride to-night.”
</p><p>“But much more shalt thou get, liar,” quoth Ketel to himself, “for that
hour when thou lookest once again on Whitefire shall be thy last!”
</p>
<p>So Gizur and Swanhild made ready to go up against Eric. That day they
rode away with a great company, a hundred and one in all, and this was
their plan. They sent six men with that thrall who had shown them the
secret path, bidding him guide them to the mountain-top. Then, when they
were come thither, and heard the shouts of those who sought to gain the
platform from the south, they were to watch till Eric and his folk came
out from the cave, and shoot them with arrows from above or crush them
with stones. But if perchance Eric left the platform and came to meet
his foes in the narrow pass, then they must let themselves down with
ropes from the height above, and, creeping after him round the rock,
must smite him in the back. Moreover, in secret, Gizur promised a great
reward of ten hundreds in silver to him who should kill Eric, for he did
not long to stand face to face with him alone. Swanhild also in secret
made promise of reward to those who should bring Eric to her, bound, but
living; and she bade them do this--to bear him down with shields and tie
him with ropes.
</p>
<p>So they rode away, the seven who should climb the mountain from behind
going first, and on the morrow morning they crossed the sand and came to
Mosfell.
