<p>After entering at break of day the inner roadstead of the Port
of Toulon, exchanging several loud hails with one of the guardboats
of the Fleet, which directed him where he was to take up his berth,
Master-Gunner Peyrol let go the anchor of the sea-worn and battered
ship in his charge, between the arsenal and the town, in full
view of the principal quay. The course of his life, which in the
opinion of any ordinary person might have been regarded as full
of marvellous incidents (only he himself had never marvelled at
them) had rendered him undemonstrative to such a degree, that
he did not even let out a sigh of relief at the rumble of the
chain. And yet it ended a most anxious six months of knocking
about at sea with valuable merchandize in a damaged hull, most
of the time on short rations, always on the lookout for English
cruisers, once or twice on the verge of shipwreck and more than
once on the verge of capture. But as to that, old Peyrol had made
up his mind from the first to blow up his valuable charge&mdash;unemotionally,
for such was his character, formed under the sun of the Indian
seas in lawless contests with his kind for a little loot that
vanished as soon as grasped, but mainly for bare life almost as
precarious to hold through its ups and downs, and which now had
lasted for fifty-eight years.</p>

<p>While his crew of half-starved scarecrows, hard as nails and
ravenous as so many wolves for the delights of the shore, swarmed
aloft to furl the sails nearly as thin and as patched as the grimy
shirts on their backs, Peyrol took a survey of the quay. Groups
were forming along its whole stretch to gaze at the new arrival.
Peyrol noted particularly a good many men in red caps and said
to himself: "Here they are." Amongst the crews of ships that had
brought the tricolour into the seas of the East, there were hundreds
professing sans-culotte principles; boastful and declamatory beggars
he had thought them. But now he was beholding the shore breed.
Those who had made the Revolution safe. The real thing. Peyrol
after taking a good long look, went below into his cabin to make
himself ready to go ashore.</p>

<p>He shaved his big cheeks with a real English razor, looted years
ago from an officer’s cabin in an English East Indiaman, captured
by a ship he was serving in then. He put on a white shirt, a short
blue jacket with metal buttons and a high roll-collar, a pair
of white trousers which he fastened with a red bandana handkerchief,
by way of a belt. With a black, shiny low-crowned hat on his head
he made a very creditable prize-master. He beckoned from the poop
to a boatman and got himself rowed to the quay.</p>

<p>By that time the crowd had grown to a large size. Peyrol’s eyes
ranged over it with no great apparent interest, though it was
a fact that he had never in all his man’s life seen so many idle
white people massed together to stare at a sailor. He had been
a rover of the outer seas; he had grown into a stranger to his
native country. During the few minutes it took the boatman to
row him to the steps, he felt like a navigator about to land on
a newly discovered shore.</p>

<p>On putting his foot on it he was mobbed. The arrival of a prize
made by a squadron of the Republic in distant seas was not an
everyday occurrence in Toulon. The wildest rumours had been already
set flying. Peyrol elbowed himself through the crowd somehow,
but it continued to move after him. A voice cried out, "Where
do you come from, citoyen?" "From the other side of the world,"
Peyrol boomed out.</p>

<p>He did not get rid of his followers till the door of the Port
Office. There he reported himself to the proper officials as master
of a prize taken off the Cape by Citoyen Renaud, Commander-in-Chief
of the Republican Squadron in the Indian Seas. He had been ordered
to make for Dunkerque but, said he, having been chased by the
sacrés Anglais three times in a fortnight between Cape Verde and
Cape Spartel, he had made up his mind to run into the Mediterranean
where, he had understood from a Danish brig he had met at sea,
there were no English men-of-war just then. And here he was; and
there were his ship’s papers and his own papers and everything
in order. He mentioned also that he was tired of rolling about
the seas, and that he longed for a period of repose on shore.
But till all the legal business was settled he remained in Toulon
roaming about the streets at a deliberate gait, enjoying general
consideration as Citizen Peyrol, and looking everybody coldly
in the eye.</p>

<p>His reticence about his past was of that kind which starts a
lot of mysterious stories about a man. No doubt the maritime authorities
of Toulon had a less cloudy idea of Peyrol’s past, though it need
not necessarily have been more exact. In the various offices connected
with the sea where his duties took him, the wretched scribes,
and even some of the chiefs, looked very hard at him as he went
in and out, dressed very neatly, and always with his cudgel, which
he used to leave outside the door of private offices when called
in for an interview with one or another of the "gold-laced lot."
Having, however, cut off his queue and got in touch with some
prominent patriots of the Jacobin type, Peyrol cared little for
people’s stares and whispers. The person that came nearest to
trying his composure, was a certain naval captain with a patch
over one eye and a very threadbare uniform coat, who was doing
some administrative work at the Port Office. That officer, looking
up from some papers, remarked brusquely, "As a matter of fact
you have been the best part of your life skimming the seas, if
the truth were known. You must have been a deserter from the Navy
at one time, whatever you may call yourself now."</p>

<p>There was not a quiver on the large cheeks of the gunner Peyrol.</p>

<p>"If there was anything of the sort it was in the time of kings
and aristocrats," he said steadily. "And now I have brought in
a prize, and a service letter from Citizen Renaud, commanding
in the Indian seas. I can also give you the names of good Republicans
in this town who know my sentiments. Nobody can say I was ever
anti-revolutionary in my life. I knocked about the Eastern seas
for forty-five years&mdash;that’s true. But let me observe that it
was the seamen who stayed at home that let the English into the
Port of Toulon." He paused for a moment and then added, "When
one thinks of that, Citoyen Commandant, any little slips I and
fellows of my kind may have made five thousand leagues from here
and twenty years ago cannot have much importance in these times
of equality and fraternity."</p>

<p>"As to fraternity," remarked the post-captain in the shabby coat,
"the only one you are familiar with is the brotherhood of the
coast, I should say."</p>

<p>"Everybody in the Indian Ocean except milksops and youngsters
had to be," said the untroubled Citizen Peyrol. "And we practised
republican principles long before a republic was thought of; for
the Brothers of the Coast were all equal and elected their own
chiefs."</p>

<p>"They were an abominable lot of lawless ruffians," remarked the
officer venomously, leaning back in his chair. "You will not dare
to deny that."</p>

<p>Citizen Peyrol refused to take up a defensive attitude. He merely
mentioned in a neutral tone that he had delivered his trust to
the Port Office all right, and as to his character he had a certificate
of civism from his section. He was a patriot and entitled to his
discharge. After being dismissed by a nod he took up his cudgel
outside the door and walked out of the building with the calmness
of rectitude. His large face of the Roman type betrayed nothing
to the wretched quill-drivers, who whispered on his passage. As
he went along the streets, he looked as usual everybody in the
eye; but that very same evening he vanished from Toulon. It wasn’t
that he was afraid of anything. His mind was as calm as the natural
set of his florid face. Nobody could know what his forty years
or more of sea life had been, unless he told them himself. And
of that he didn’t mean to tell more than what he had told the
inquisitive captain with the patch over one eye. But he didn’t
want any bother for certain other reasons; and more than anything
else he didn’t want to be sent perhaps to serve in the fleet now
fitting out in Toulon. So at dusk he passed through the gate on
the road to Fréjus in a high two-wheeled cart belonging to a well-known
farmer whose habitation lay that way. His personal belongings
were brought down and piled up on the tailboard of the cart by
some ragamuffin patriots whom he engaged in the street for that
purpose. The only indiscretion he committed was to pay them for
their trouble with a large handful of assignats. From such a prosperous
seaman, however, this generosity was not so very compromising.
He himself got into the cart over the wheel, with such slow and
ponderous movements, that the friendly farmer felt called upon
to remark: "Ah, we are not so young as we used to be&mdash;you and
I." "I have also an awkward wound," said Citizen Peyrol sitting
down heavily.</p>

<p>And so from farmer’s cart to farmer’s cart, getting lifts all
along, jogging in a cloud of dust between stone walls and through
little villages well known to him from his boyhood’s days, in
a landscape of stony hills, pale rocks, and dusty green of olive
trees, Citizen Peyrol went on unmolested till he got down clumsily
in the yard of an inn on the outskirts of the town of Hyères.
The sun was setting to his right. Near a clump of dark pines with
blood-red trunks in the sunset Peyrol perceived a rutty track
branching off in the direction of the sea.</p>

<p>At that spot Citizen Peyrol had made up his mind to leave the
high road. Every feature of the country with the darkly wooded
rises, the barren flat expanse of stones and sombre bushes to
his left, appealed to him with a sort of strange familiarity,
because they had remained unchanged since the days of his boyhood.
The very cartwheel tracks scored deep into the stony ground had
kept their physiognomy; and far away, like a blue thread, there
was the sea of the Hyères roadstead with a lumpy indigo swelling
still beyond&mdash;which was the island of Porquerolles. He had an
idea that he had been born on Porquerolles, but he really did
not know. The notion of a father was absent from his mentality.
What he remembered of his parents was a tall, lean, brown woman
in rags, who was his mother. But then they were working together
at a farm which was on the mainland. He had fragmentary memories
of her shaking down olives, picking stones out of a field, or
handling a manure fork like a man, tireless and fierce, with wisps
of greyish hair flying about her bony face; and of himself running
barefooted in connection with a flock of turkeys, with hardly
any clothes on his back. At night, by the farmer’s favour, they
were permitted to sleep in a sort of ruinous byre built of stones
and with only half a roof on it, lying side by side on some old
straw on the ground. And it was on a bundle of straw that his
mother had tossed ill for two days and had died in the night.
In the darkness, her silence, her cold face had given him an awful
scare. He supposed they had buried her but he didn’t know, because
he had rushed out terror-struck, and never stopped till he got
as far as a little place by the sea called Almanarre, where he
hid himself on board a tartane that was lying there with no one
on board. He went into the hold because he was afraid of some
dogs on shore. He found down there a heap of empty sacks, which
made a luxurious couch, and being exhausted went to sleep like
a stone. Some time during the night the crew came on board and
the tartane sailed for Marseilles. That was another awful scare&mdash;being
hauled out by the scruff of the neck on the deck and being asked
who the devil he was and what he was doing there. Only from that
one he could not run away. There was water all around him and
the whole world, including the coast not very far away, wobbled
in a most alarming manner. Three bearded men stood about him and
he tried to explain to them that he had been working at Peyrol’s.
Peyrol was the farmer’s name. The boy didn’t know that he had
one of his own. Moreover he didn’t know very well how to talk
to people, and they must have misunderstood him. Thus the name
of Peyrol stuck to him for life.</p>

<p>There the memories of his native country stopped, overlaid by
other memories, with a multitude of impressions of endless oceans,
of the Mozambique Channel, of Arabs and negroes, of Madagascar,
of the coast of India, of islands and channels and reefs; of fights
at sea, rows on shore, desperate slaughter and desperate thirst,
of all sorts of ships one after another: merchant ships and frigates
and privateers; of reckless men and enormous sprees. In the course
of years he had learned to speak intelligibly and think connectedly,
and even to read and write after a fashion. The name of the farmer
Peyrol attached to his person on account of his inability to give
a clear account of himself acquired a sort of reputation, both
openly, in the ports of the East and, secretly, amongst the Brothers
of the Coast, that strange fraternity with something masonic and
not a little piratical in its constitution. Round the Cape of
Storms, which is also the Cape of Good Hope, the words Republic,
Nation, Tyranny, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, and the cult
of the Supreme Being came floating on board ships from home: new
cries and new ideas which did not upset the slowly developed intelligence
of the gunner Peyrol. They seemed the invention of landsmen, of
whom the seaman Peyrol knew very little&mdash;nothing, so to speak.
Now after nearly fifty years of lawful and lawless sea-life Citizen
Peyrol, at the yard gate of the roadside inn, looked at the late
scene of his childhood. He looked at it without any animosity
but a little puzzled as to his bearings amongst the features of
the land. "Yes, it must be somewhere in that direction," he thought
vaguely. Decidedly he would go no further along the high road....
A few yards away the woman of the inn stood looking at him, impressed
by the good clothes, the great shaven cheeks, the well-to-do air
of that seaman; and suddenly Peyrol noticed her. With her anxious
brown face, her grey locks, and her rustic appearance she might
have been his mother, as he remembered her, only she wasn’t in
rags.</p>

<p>"Hé! la mère," hailed Peyrol. "Have you got a man to lend a hand
with my chest into the house?"</p>

<p>He looked so prosperous and so authoritative that she piped without
hesitation in a thin voice, "Mais oui, citoyen. He will be here
in a moment."</p>

<p>In the dusk the clump of pines across the road looked very black
against the quiet clear sky; and Citizen Peyrol gazed at the scene
of his young misery with the greatest possible placidity. Here
he was after nearly fifty years, and to look at things it seemed
like yesterday. He felt for all this neither love nor resentment.
He felt a little funny as it were, and the funniest thing was
the thought which crossed his mind that he could indulge his fancy
(if he had a mind to it) to buy up all this land to the furthermost
field, away over there where the track lost itself sinking into
the flats bordering the sea where the small rise at the end of
the Giens peninsula had assumed the appearance of a black cloud.</p>

<p>"Tell me, my friend," he said in his magisterial way to the farmhand
with a tousled head of hair who was awaiting his good pleasure,
"doesn’t this track lead to Almanarre?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the labourer, and Peyrol nodded. The man continued
mouthing his words slowly as if unused to speech. "To Almanarre
and further too, beyond the great pond right out to the end of
the land, to Cape Esterel."</p>

<p>Peyrol was lending his big flat hairy ear. "If I had stayed in
this country," he thought, "I would be talking like this fellow."
And aloud he asked:</p>

<p>"Are there any houses there, at the end of the land?"</p>

<p>"Why, a hamlet, a hole, just a few houses round a church, and
a farm where at one time they would give you a glass of wine."</p>
