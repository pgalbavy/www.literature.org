When the days grow cold and the nights are clear,<br/>
There stalks abroad the spirit of fear.

</p>

<em>Lightfoot the Deer.</em>

<p>It is sad but true. Autumn is often called the sad time of the
year, and it <em>is</em> the sad time. But it shouldn't be. Old
Mother Nature never intended that it should be. She meant it to
be the <em>glad</em> time. It is the time when all the little
people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows have got over
the cares and worries of bringing up families and teaching their
children how to look out for themselves. It is the season when
food is plentiful, and every one is fat and is, or ought to be,
care free. It is the season when Old Mother Nature intended all
her little people to be happy, to have nothing to worry them for
the little time before the coming of cold weather and the hard
times which cold weather always brings.</p>

<p>But instead of this, a grim, dark figure goes stalking over the
Green Meadows and through the Green Forest, and it is called the
Spirit of Fear. It peers into every hiding-place and wherever
it finds one of the little people it sends little cold chills
over him, little chills which jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun cannot
chase away, though he shine his brightest. All night as well as
all day the Spirit of Fear searches out the little people of the
Green Meadows and the Green Forest. It will not let them sleep.
It will not let them eat in peace. It drives them to seek new
hiding-places and then drives them out of those. It keeps them
ever ready to fly or run at the slightest sound.</p>

<p>Peter Rabbit was thinking of this as he sat at the edge of the
dear Old Briar-patch, looking over to the Green Forest. The Green
Forest was no longer just green; it was of many colors, for Old
Mother Nature had set Jack Frost to painting the leaves of the
maple-trees and the beech-trees, and the birch-trees and the poplar-trees
and the chestnut-trees, and he had done his work well. Very, very
lovely were the reds and yellows and browns against the dark green
of the pines and the spruces and the hemlocks. The Purple Hills
were more softly purple than at any other season of the year.
It was all very, very beautiful.</p>

<p>But Peter had no thought for the beauty of it all, for the Spirit
of Fear had visited even the dear Old Briar-patch, and Peter was
afraid. It wasn't fear of Reddy Fox, or Redtail the Hawk, or Hooty
the Owl, or Old Man Coyote. They were forever trying to catch
him, but they did not strike terror to his heart because he felt
quite smart enough to keep out of their clutches. To be sure,
they gave him sudden frights sometimes, when they happened to
surprise him, but these frights lasted only until he reached the
nearest bramble-tangle or hollow log where they could not get
at him. But the fear that chilled his heart now never left him
even for a moment.</p>

<p>And Peter knew that this same fear was clutching at the hearts
of Bob White, hiding in the brown stubble; of Mrs. Grouse, squatting
in the thickest bramble-tangle in the Green Forest; of Uncle Billy
Possum and Bobby Coon in their hollow trees; of Jerry Muskrat
in the Smiling Pool; of Happy Jack Squirrel, hiding in the tree
tops; of Lightfoot the Deer, lying in the closest thicket he could
find. It was even clutching at the hearts of Granny and Reddy
Fox and of great, big Buster Bear. It seemed to Peter that no
one was so big or so small that this terrible Spirit of Fear had
not searched him out.</p>

<p>Far in the distance sounded a sudden bang. Peter jumped and shivered.
He knew that every one else who had heard that bang had jumped
and shivered just as he had. It was the season of hunters with
terrible guns. It was man who had sent this terrible Spirit of
Fear to chill the hearts of the little meadow and forest people
at this very time when Old Mother Nature had made all things so
beautiful and had intended that they should be happiest and most
free from care and worry. It was man who had made the autumn a
sad time instead of a glad time, the very saddest time of all
the year, when Old Mother Nature had done her best to make it
the most beautiful.</p>

<p>"I don't understand these men creatures," said Peter to little
Mrs. Peter, as they stared fearfully out from the dear Old Briar-patch.
"They seem to find pleasure, actually find pleasure, in trying
to kill us. I don't understand them at all. They haven't any hearts.
That must be the reason; they haven't any hearts."</p>
