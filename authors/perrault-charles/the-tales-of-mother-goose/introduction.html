What virtues do these stories possess that have kept them alive for so
long a time? They have to some degree stimulated and nourished qualities
of supreme worth in individual and social life. With the young the
struggle against greed and falsehood and pride and cowardice is a very
real one, and situations in which these homely, fundamental traits are
involved are full of interest and seriousness. Again, to mature people
the reward of well-doing and the punishment of evil conduct portrayed in
these stories are apt to seem too realistic, too much also on the
cut-and-dried pattern; but it is far different with children. They have
a very concrete sense of right and wrong, and they demand a clear,
explicit, tangible outcome for every sort of action. They must have
concrete, living examples, with the appropriate outcome of each, set
before them.

A modest, faithful child will be strengthened in his good qualities;
while one lacking these will have them aroused, to some extent at any
rate, by following Cinderella in her career. Arrogance and selfishness
come to unhappy straits in this fancy world, and they are likely to
fare the same in the real world; so it would be better to part company
with them, and take up with gentleness and kindliness and faithfulness
instead. And every one may be of some help to others if he be only of
the right mind. The brother who thought himself faring badly with only a
cat for a legacy learns betimes that even so small and apparently
helpless a creature may be of much service when he is rightly disposed.
A person might think little Thumb could accomplish nothing of value to
any one, but he again teaches the child that all depends on the
willingness to be of assistance, the good-heartedness, the
fellow-feeling which one has for others.

In making this version anew the translator has endeavored to retain the
characteristics of the style of the early chap-book versions, while
evading the pompous, stilted language and Johnsonian phraseology so
fashionable when they were first translated.
