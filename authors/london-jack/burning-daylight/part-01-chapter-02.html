<P>
It was two in the morning when the dancers, bent on getting
something to eat, adjourned the dancing for half an hour.  And it
was at this moment that Jack Kearns suggested poker.  Jack Kearns
was a big, bluff-featured man, who, along with Bettles, had made
the disastrous attempt to found a post on the head-reaches of the
Koyokuk, far inside the Arctic Circle.  After that, Kearns had
fallen back on his posts at Forty Mile and Sixty Mile and changed
the direction of his ventures by sending out to the States for a
small sawmill and a river steamer.  The former was even then
being sledded across Chilcoot Pass by Indians and dogs, and would
come down the Yukon in the early summer after the ice-run.  Later
in the summer, when Bering Sea and the mouth of the Yukon cleared
of ice, the steamer, put together at St. Michaels, was to be
expected up the river loaded to the guards with supplies.
<P>
Jack Kearns suggested poker.  French Louis, Dan MacDonald, and
Hal Campbell (who had make a strike on Moosehide), all three of
whom were not dancing because there were not girls enough to go
around, inclined to the suggestion.  They were looking for a
fifth man when Burning Daylight emerged from the rear room, the
Virgin on his arm, the train of dancers in his wake.  In response
to the hail of the poker-players, he came over to their table in
the corner.
<P>
"Want you to sit in," said Campbell.  "How's your luck?"
<P>
"I sure got it to-night," Burning Daylight answered with
enthusiasm, and at the same time felt the Virgin press his arm
warningly.  She wanted him for the dancing.  "I sure got my luck
with me, but I'd sooner dance.  I ain't hankerin' to take the
money away from you-all."
<P>
Nobody urged.  They took his refusal as final, and the Virgin was
pressing his arm to turn him away in pursuit of the
supper-seekers, when he experienced a change of heart.  It was
not that he did not want to dance, nor that he wanted to hurt
her; but that insistent pressure on his arm put his free
man-nature in revolt.  The thought in his mind was that he did
not want any woman running him.  Himself a favorite with women,
nevertheless they did not bulk big with him.  They were toys,
playthings, part of the relaxation from the bigger game of life. 
He met women along with the whiskey and gambling, and from
observation he had found that it was far easier to break away
from the drink and the cards than from a woman once the man was
properly entangled.
<P>
He was a slave to himself, which was natural in one with a
healthy ego, but he rebelled in ways either murderous or panicky
at being a slave to anybody else.  Love's sweet servitude was a
thing of which he had no comprehension.  Men he had seen in love
impressed him as lunatics, and lunacy was a thing he had never
considered worth analyzing.  But comradeship with men was
different from love with women.  There was no servitude in
comradeship.  It was a business proposition, a square deal
between men who did not pursue each other, but who shared the
risks of trail and river and mountain in the pursuit of life and
treasure.  Men and women pursued each other, and one must needs
bend the other to his will or hers.  Comradeship was different. 
There was no slavery about it; and though he, a strong man beyond
strength's seeming, gave far more than he received, he gave not
something due but in royal largess, his gifts of toil or heroic
effort falling generously from his hands.  To pack for days over
the gale-swept passes or across the mosquito-ridden marshes, and
to pack double the weight his comrade packed, did not involve
unfairness or compulsion.  Each did his best.  That was the
business essence of it.  Some men were stronger than
others--true;
but so long as each man did his best it was fair exchange, the
business spirit was observed, and the square deal obtained.
<P>
But with women--no.  Women gave little and wanted all.  Women had
apron-strings and were prone to tie them about any man who looked
twice in their direction.  There was the Virgin, yawning her head
off when he came in and mightily pleased that he asked her to
dance.  One dance was all very well, but because he danced twice
and thrice with her and several times more, she squeezed his arm
when they asked him to sit in at poker.  It was the obnoxious
apron-string, the first of the many compulsions she would exert
upon him if he gave in.  Not that she was not a nice bit of a
woman, healthy and strapping and good to look upon, also a very
excellent dancer, but that she was a woman with all a woman's
desire to rope him with her apron-strings and tie him hand and
foot for the branding.  Better poker.  Besides, he liked poker as
well as he did dancing.
<P>
He resisted the pull on his arm by the mere negative mass of him,
and said:-
<P>
"I sort of feel a hankering to give you-all a flutter."
<P>
Again came the pull on his arm.  She was trying to pass the
apron-string around him.  For the fraction of an instant he was a
savage, dominated by the wave of fear and murder that rose up in
him.  For that infinitesimal space of time he was to all purposes
a frightened tiger filled with rage and terror at the
apprehension of the trap.  Had he been no more than a savage, he
would have leapt wildly from the place or else sprung upon her
and destroyed her.  But in that same instant there stirred in him
the generations of discipline by which man had become an
inadequate social animal.  Tact and sympathy strove with him, and
he smiled with his eyes into the Virgin's eyes as he said:-
<P>
"You-all go and get some grub.  I ain't hungry.  And we'll dance
some more by and by.  The night's young yet.  Go to it, old
girl."
<P>
He released his arm and thrust her playfully on the shoulder, at
the same time turning to the poker-players.
<P>
"Take off the limit and I'll go you-all."
<P>
"Limit's the roof," said Jack Kearns.
<P>
"Take off the roof."
<P>
The players glanced at one another, and Kearns announced, "The
roof's off."
<P>
Elam Harnish dropped into the waiting chair, started to pull out
his gold-sack, and changed his mind.  The Virgin pouted a moment,
then followed in the wake of the other dancers.
<P>
"I'll bring you a sandwich, Daylight," she called back over her
shoulder.
<P>
He nodded.  She was smiling her forgiveness.  He had escaped the
apron-string, and without hurting her feelings too severely.
<P>
"Let's play markers," he suggested.  "Chips do everlastingly
clutter up the table....If it's agreeable to you-all?"
<P>
"I'm willing," answered Hal Campbell.  "Let mine run at five
hundred."
<P>
"Mine, too," answered Harnish, while the others stated the values
they put on their own markers, French Louis, the most modest,
issuing his at a hundred dollars each.
<P>
In Alaska, at that time, there were no rascals and no tin-horn
gamblers.  Games were conducted honestly, and men trusted one
another.  A man's word was as good as his gold in the blower.  A
marker was a flat, oblong composition chip worth, perhaps, a
cent.  But when a man betted a marker in a game and said it was
worth five hundred dollars, it was accepted as worth five hundred
dollars.  Whoever won it knew that the man who issued it would
redeem it with five hundred dollars' worth of dust weighed out on
the scales.  The markers being of different colors, there was no
difficulty in identifying the owners.  Also, in that early Yukon
day, no one dreamed of playing table-stakes.  A man was good in a
game for all that he possessed, no matter where his possessions
were or what was their nature.
<P>
Harnish cut and got the deal.  At this good augury, and while
shuffling the deck, he called to the barkeepers to set up the
drinks for the house.  As he dealt the first card to Dan
MacDonald, on his left, he called out:
<P>
"Get down to the ground, you-all, Malemutes, huskies, and Siwash
purps!  Get down and dig in!  Tighten up them traces!  Put your
weight into the harness and bust the breast-bands!  Whoop-la!
Yow!  We're off and bound for Helen Breakfast!  And I tell
you-all clear and plain there's goin' to be stiff grades and fast
goin' to-night before we win to that same lady.  And somebody's
goin' to bump...hard."
<P>
Once started, it was a quiet game, with little or no
conversation, though all about the players the place was a-roar. 
Elam Harnish had ignited the spark.  More and more miners dropped
in to the Tivoli and remained.  When Burning Daylight went on the
tear, no man cared to miss it.  The dancing-floor was full. 
Owing to the shortage of women, many of the men tied bandanna
handkerchiefs around their arms in token of femininity and danced
with other men.  All the games were crowded, and the voices of
the men talking at the long bar and grouped about the stove were
accompanied by the steady click of chips and the sharp whir,
rising and falling, of the roulette-ball.  All the materials of a
proper Yukon night were at hand and mixing.
<P>
The luck at the table varied monotonously, no big hands being
out.  As a result, high play went on with small hands though no
play lasted long.  A filled straight belonging to French Louis
gave him a pot of five thousand against two sets of threes held
by Campbell and Kearns.  One pot of eight hundred dollars was won
by a pair of trays on a showdown.  And once Harnish called Kearns
for two thousand dollars on a cold steal.  When Kearns laid down
his hand it showed a bobtail flush, while Harnish's hand proved
that he had had the nerve to call on a pair of tens.
<P>
But at three in the morning the big combination of hands arrived.
<P>
It was the moment of moments that men wait weeks for in a poker
game.  The news of it tingled over the Tivoli.  The onlookers
became quiet.  The men farther away ceased talking and moved over
to the table.  The players deserted the other games, and the
dancing-floor was forsaken, so that all stood at last, fivescore
and more, in a compact and silent group, around the poker-table. 
The high betting had begun before the draw, and still the high
betting went on, with the draw not in sight.  Kearns had dealt,
and French Louis had opened the pot with one marker--in his case
one hundred dollars.  Campbell had merely "seen" it, but Elam
Harnish, corning next, had tossed in five hundred dollars, with
the remark to MacDonald that he was letting him in easy.
<P>
MacDonald, glancing again at his hand, put in a thousand in
markers.  Kearns, debating a long time over his hand, finally
"saw."  It then cost French Louis nine hundred to remain in the
game, which he contributed after a similar debate.  It cost
Campbell likewise nine hundred to remain and draw cards, but to
the surprise of all he saw the nine hundred and raised another
thousand.
<P>
"You-all are on the grade at last," Harnish remarked, as he saw
the fifteen hundred and raised a thousand in turn.  "Helen
Breakfast's sure on top this divide, and you-all had best look
out for bustin' harness."
<P>
"Me for that same lady," accompanied MacDonald's markers for two
thousand and for an additional thousand-dollar raise.
<P>
It was at this stage that the players sat up and knew beyond
peradventure that big hands were out.  Though their features
showed nothing, each man was beginning unconsciously to tense. 
Each man strove to appear his natural self, and each natural self
was different.  Hal Campbell affected his customary cautiousness.
<P>
French Louis betrayed interest.  MacDonald retained his
whole-souled benevolence, though it seemed to take on a slightly
exaggerated tone.  Kearns was coolly dispassionate and
noncommittal, while Elam Harnish appeared as quizzical and
jocular as ever.  Eleven thousand dollars were already in the
pot, and the markers were heaped in a confused pile in the centre
of the table.
<P>
"I ain't go no more markers," Kearns remarked plaintively.  "We'd
best begin I.O.U.'s."
<P>
"Glad you're going to stay," was MacDonald's cordial response.
<P>
"I ain't stayed yet.  I've got a thousand in already.  How's it
stand now?"
<P>
"It'll cost you three thousand for a look in, but nobody will
stop you from raising."
<P>
"Raise--hell.  You must think I got a pat like yourself."   
Kearns looked at his hand.  "But I'll tell you what I'll do, Mac.
<P>
I've got a hunch, and I'll just see that three thousand."
<P>
He wrote the sum on a slip of paper, signed his name, and
consigned it to the centre of the table.
<P>
French Louis became the focus of all eyes.  He fingered his cards
nervously for a space.  Then, with a "By Gar!  Ah got not one
leetle beet hunch," he regretfully tossed his hand into the
discards.
<P>
The next moment the hundred and odd pairs of eyes shifted to
Campbell.
<P>
"I won't hump you, Jack," he said, contenting himself with
calling the requisite two thousand.
<P>
The eyes shifted to Harnish, who scribbled on a piece of paper
and shoved it forward.
<P>
"I'll just let you-all know this ain't no Sunday-school society
of philanthropy," he said.  "I see you, Jack, and I raise you a
thousand.  Here's where you-all get action on your pat, Mac."
<P>
"Action's what I fatten on, and I lift another thousand," was
MacDonald's rejoinder.  "Still got that hunch, Jack?"
<P>
"I still got the hunch."  Kearns fingered his cards a long
time.  "And I'll play it, but you've got to know how I stand. 
There's my steamer, the Bella--worth twenty thousand if she's
worth an ounce.  There's Sixty Mile with five thousand in stock
on the shelves.  And you know I got a sawmill coming in.  It's at
Linderman now, and the scow is building.  Am I good?"
<P>
"Dig in; you're sure good," was Daylight's answer.  "And while
we're about it, I may mention casual that I got twenty thousand
in Mac's safe, there, and there's twenty thousand more in the
ground on Moosehide.  You know the ground, Campbell.  Is they
that-all in the dirt?"
<P>
"There sure is, Daylight."
<P>
"How much does it cost now?" Kearns asked.
<P>
"Two thousand to see."
<P>
"We'll sure hump you if you-all come in," Daylight warned him.
<P>
"It's an almighty good hunch," Kearns said, adding his slip for
two thousand to the growing heap.  "I can feel her crawlin' up
and down my back."
<P>
"I ain't got a hunch, but I got a tolerable likeable hand,"
Campbell announced, as he slid in his slip; "but it's not a
raising hand."
<P>
"Mine is," Daylight paused and wrote.  "I see that thousand and
raise her the same old thousand."
<P>
The Virgin, standing behind him, then did what a man's best
friend was not privileged to do.  Reaching over Daylight's
shoulder, she picked up his hand and read it, at the same time
shielding the faces of the five cards close to his chest.  What
she saw were three queens and a pair of eights, but nobody
guessed what she saw.  Every player's eyes were on her face as
she scanned the cards, but no sign did she give.  Her features
might have been carved from ice, for her expression was precisely
the same before, during, and after.  Not a muscle quivered; nor
was there the slightest dilation of a nostril, nor the slightest
increase of light in the eyes.  She laid the hand face down again
on the table, and slowly the lingering eyes withdrew from her,
having learned nothing.
<P>
MacDonald smiled benevolently.  "I see you, Daylight, and I hump
this time for two thousand.  How's that hunch, Jack?"
<P>
"Still a-crawling, Mac.  You got me now, but that hunch is a
rip-snorter persuadin' sort of a critter, and it's my plain duty
to ride it.  I call for three thousand.  And I got another hunch:
Daylight's going to call, too."
<P>
"He sure is," Daylight agreed, after Campbell had thrown up his
hand.  "He knows when he's up against it, and he plays accordin'.
<P>
I see that two thousand, and then I'll see the draw."
<P>
In a dead silence, save for the low voices of the three players,
the draw was made.  Thirty-four thousand dollars were already in
the pot, and the play possibly not half over.  To the Virgin's
amazement, Daylight held up his three queens, discarding his
eights and calling for two cards.  And this time not even she
dared look at what he had drawn.  She knew her limit of control. 
Nor did he look.  The two new cards lay face down on the table
where they had been dealt to him.
<P>
"Cards?" Kearns asked of MacDonald.
<P>
"Got enough," was the reply.
<P>
"You can draw if you want to, you know," Kearns warned him.
<P>
"Nope; this'll do me."
<P>
Kearns himself drew two cards, but did not look at them.
<P>
Still Harnish let his cards lie.
<P>
"I never bet in the teeth of a pat hand," he said slowly, looking
at the saloon-keeper.  "You-all start her rolling, Mac."
<P>
MacDonald counted his cards carefully, to make doubles sure it
was not a foul hand, wrote a sum on a paper slip, and slid it
into the pot, with the simple utterance:-
<P>
"Five thousand."
<P>
Kearns, with every eye upon him, looked at his two-card draw,
counted the other three to dispel any doubt of holding more than
five cards, and wrote on a betting slip.
<P>
"I see you, Mac," he said, "and I raise her a little thousand
just so as not to keep Daylight out."
<P>
The concentrated gaze shifted to Daylight.  He likewise examined
his draw and counted his five cards.
<P>
"I see that six thousand, and I raise her five thousand...just to
try and keep you out, Jack."
<P>
"And I raise you five thousand just to lend a hand at keeping
Jack out," MacDonald said, in turn.
<P>
His voice was slightly husky and strained, and a nervous twitch
in the corner of his mouth followed speech.
<P>
Kearns was pale, and those who looked on noted that his hand
trembled as he wrote his slip.  But his voice was unchanged.
<P>
"I lift her along for five thousand," he said.
<P>
Daylight was now the centre.  The kerosene lamps above flung high
lights from the rash of sweat on his forehead.  The bronze of his
cheeks was darkened by the accession of blood.  His black eyes
glittered, and his nostrils were distended and eager.  They were
large nostrils, tokening his descent from savage ancestors who
had survived by virtue of deep lungs and generous air-passages. 
Yet, unlike MacDonald, his voice was firm and customary, and,
unlike Kearns, his hand did not tremble when he wrote.
<P>
"I call, for ten thousand," he said.  "Not that I'm afraid of
you-all, Mac.  It's that hunch of Jack's."
<P>
"I hump his hunch for five thousand just the same," said
MacDonald.  "I had the best hand before the draw, and I still
guess I got it."
<P>
"Mebbe this is a case where a hunch after the draw is better'n
the hunch before," Kearns remarked; "wherefore duty says, 'Lift
her, Jack, lift her,' and so I lift her another five thousand."
<P>
Daylight leaned back in his chair and gazed up at the kerosene
lamps while he computed aloud.
<P>
"I was in nine thousand before the draw, and I saw and raised
eleven thousand--that makes thirty.  I'm only good for ten more."
<P>
He leaned forward and looked at Kearns.  "So I call that ten
thousand."
<P>
"You can raise if you want," Kearns answered.  "Your dogs are
good for five thousand in this game."
<P>
"Nary dawg.  You-all can win my dust and dirt, but nary one of my
dawgs.  I just call."
<P>
MacDonald considered for a long time.  No one moved or whispered.
<P>
Not a muscle was relaxed on the part of the onlookers.  Not the
weight of a body shifted from one leg to the other.  It was a
sacred silence.  Only could be heard the roaring draft of the
huge stove, and from without, muffled by the log-walls, the
howling of dogs.  It was not every night that high stakes were
played on the Yukon, and for that matter, this was the highest in
the history of the country.  The saloon-keeper finally spoke.
<P>
"If anybody else wins, they'll have to take a mortgage on the
Tivoli."
<P>
The two other players nodded.
<P>
"So I call, too."  MacDonald added his slip for five thousand.
<P>
Not one of them claimed the pot, and not one of them called the
size of his hand.  Simultaneously and in silence they faced their
cards on the table, while a general tiptoeing and craning of
necks took place among the onlookers.  Daylight showed four
queens and an ace; MacDonald four jacks and an ace; and Kearns
four kings and a trey.  Kearns reached forward with an encircling
movement of his arm and drew the pot in to him, his arm shaking
as he did so.
<P>
Daylight picked the ace from his hand and tossed it over
alongside MacDonald's ace, saying:-
<P>
"That's what cheered me along, Mac.  I knowed it was only kings
that could beat me, and he had them.
<P>
"What did you-all have?" he asked, all interest, turning to
Campbell.
<P>
"Straight flush of four, open at both ends--a good drawing hand."
<P>
"You bet! You could a' made a straight, a straight flush, or a
flush out of it."
<P>
"That's what I thought," Campbell said sadly.  "It cost me six
thousand before I quit."
<P>
"I wisht you-all'd drawn," Daylight laughed.  "Then I wouldn't a'
caught that fourth queen.  Now I've got to take Billy Rawlins'
mail contract and mush for Dyea.  What's the size of the
killing, Jack?"
<P>
Kearns attempted to count the pot, but was too excited.  Daylight
drew it across to him, with firm fingers separating and stacking
the markers and I.O.U.'s and with clear brain adding the sum.
<P>
"One hundred and twenty-seven thousand," he announced.  "You-all
can sell out now, Jack, and head for home."
<P>
The winner smiled and nodded, but seemed incapable of speech.
<P>
"I'd shout the drinks," MacDonald said, "only the house don't
belong to me any more."
<P>
"Yes, it does," Kearns replied, first wetting his lips with his
tongue.  "Your note's good for any length of time.  But the
drinks are on me."
<P>
"Name your snake-juice, you-all--the winner pays!" Daylight
called
out loudly to all about him, at the same time rising from his
chair
and catching the Virgin by the arm.  "Come on for a reel, you-all
dancers.  The night's young yet, and it's Helen Breakfast and the
mail contract for me in the morning.  Here, you-all Rawlins,
you--I
hereby do take over that same contract, and I start for salt
water
at nine A.M.--savvee?  Come on, you-all!  Where's that fiddler?"
