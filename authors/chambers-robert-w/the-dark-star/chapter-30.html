<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>At midnight the two young men had not yet parted. For, as Sengoun
explained, the hour for parting was already past, and it was too
late to consider it now. And Neeland thought so, too, what with
the laughter and the music, and the soft night breezes to counsel
folly, and the city's haunting brilliancy stretching away in bewitching
perspectives still unexplored.</p>

<p>From every fairy lamp the lustrous capital signalled to youth
her invitation, her challenge, and her menace. Like some jewelled
sorceress&mdash;some dreaming Circe by the river bank, pondering new
spells&mdash;so Paris lay in all her mystery and beauty under the July
stars.</p>

<p>Sengoun, his arm through Neeland's, had become affectionately
confidential. He explained that he really was a nocturnal creature;
that now he had completely waked up; that his habits were due
to a passion for astronomy, and that the stars he had discovered
at odd hours of the early morning were more amazing than any celestial
bodies ever before identified.</p>

<p>But Neeland, whose head and heart were already occupied, declined
to study any constellations; and they drifted through the bluish
lustre of white arc-lights and the clustered yellow glare of incandescent
lamps toward a splash of iridescent glory among the chestnut trees,
where music sounded and tables stood amid flowers and grass and
little slender fountains which balanced silver globes upon their
jets.</p>

<p>The waiters were in Russian peasant dress; the orchestra was
Russian gipsy; the bill of fare was Russian; and there was only
champagne to be had.</p>

<p>Balalaika orchestra and spectators were singing some evidently
familiar song&mdash;one of those rushing, clattering, clashing choruses
of the Steppes; and Sengoun sang too, with all his might, when
he and Neeland were seated, which was thirsty work.</p>

<p>Two fascinating Russian gipsy girls were dancing&mdash;slim, tawny,
supple creatures in their scarlet and their jingling bangles.
After a deafening storm of applause, their flashing smiles swept
the audience, and, linking arms, they sauntered off between the
tables under the trees.</p>

<p>"I wish to dance," remarked Sengoun. "My legs will kick over
something if I don't."</p>

<p>They were playing an American dance&mdash;a sort of skating step;
people rose; couple after couple took the floor; and Sengoun looked
around for a partner. He discovered no eligible partner likely
to favour him without a quarrel with her escort; and he was debating
with Neeland whether a row would be worth while, when the gipsy
girls sauntered by.</p>

<p>"Oh," he said gaily, "a pretty Tzigane can save my life if she
will!"</p>

<p>And the girls laughed and Sengoun led one of them out at a reckless
pace.</p>

<p>The other smiled and looked at Neeland, and, seating herself,
leaned on the table watching the whirl on the floor.</p>

<p>"Don't you dance?" she asked, with a sidelong glance out of her
splendid black eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes; but I'm likely to do most of my dancing on your pretty
feet."</p>

<p>"<em>Merci!</em> In that case I prefer a cigarette."</p>

<p>She selected one from his case, lighted it, folded her arms on
the table, and continued to gaze at the dancers.</p>

<p>"I'm tired tonight," she remarked.</p>

<p>"You dance beautifully."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>Sengoun, flushed and satisfied, came back with his gipsy partner
when the music ceased.</p>

<p>"Now I hope we may have some more singing!" he exclaimed, as
they seated themselves and a waiter filled their great, bubble-shaped
glasses.</p>

<p>And he did sing at the top of his delightful voice when the balalaikas
swept out into a ringing and familiar song, and the two gipsy
girls sang, too&mdash;laughed and sang, holding the frosty goblets
high in the sparkling light.</p>

<p>It was evident to Neeland that the song was a favourite one with
Russians. Sengoun was quite overcome; they all touched goblets.</p>

<p>"Brava, my little Tziganes!" he said with happy emotion. "My
little compatriots! My little tawny panthers of the Caucasus!
What do you call yourselves in this bandbox of a country where
two steps backward take you across any frontier?"</p>

<p>His dancing partner laughed till her sequins jingled from throat
to ankle:</p>

<p>"They call us Fifi and Nini," she replied. "Ask yourself why!"</p>

<p>"For example," added the other girl, "we rise from this table
and thank you. There is nothing further. <em>C'est fini&mdash;c'est
Fifi &mdash;Nini&mdash;comprenez-vous, Prince Erlik?</em>"</p>

<p>"Hi! What?" exclaimed Sengoun. "I'm known, it appears, even to
that devilish name of mine!"</p>

<p>Everybody laughed.</p>

<p>"After all," he said, more soberly, "it's a gipsy's trade to
know everybody and everything. <em>Tiens!</em>" He slapped a goldpiece
on the table. "A kiss apiece against a louis that you don't know
my comrade's name and nation!"</p>

<p>The girl called Nini laughed:</p>

<p>"We're quite willing to kiss you, Prince Erlik, but a <em>louis
d'or</em> is not a copper penny. And your comrade is American
and his name is Tchames."</p>

<p>"James!" exclaimed Sengoun.</p>

<p>"I said so &mdash;Tchames."</p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>"Nilan."</p>

<p>"Neeland?"</p>

<p>"I said so."</p>

<p>Sengoun placed the goldpiece in Nini's hand and looked at Neeland
with an uncomfortable laugh.</p>

<p>"I ought to know a gipsy, but they always astonish me, these
Tziganes. Tell us some more, Nini&#11834;" He beckoned a waiter and
pointed indignantly at the empty goblets.</p>

<p>The girls, resting their elbows on the tables, framed their faces
with slim and dusky hands, and gazed at Sengoun out of humorous,
half-veiled eyes.</p>

<p>"What do you wish to know, Prince Erlik?" they asked mockingly.</p>

<p>"Well, for example, is my country really mobilising?"</p>

<p>"Since the twenty-fifth."</p>

<p>"<em>Tiens!</em> And old Papa Kaiser and the Clown Prince Footit&mdash;what
do they say to that?"</p>

<p>"It must be stopped."</p>

<p>"What! <em>Sang dieu!</em> We must stop mobilising against the
Austrians? But we are not going to stop, you know, while Francis
Joseph continues to pull faces at poor old Servian Peter!"</p>

<p>Neeland said:</p>

<p>"The evening paper has it that Austria is more reasonable and
that the Servian affair can be arranged. There will be no war,"
he added confidently.</p>

<p>"There will be war," remarked Nini with a shrug of her bare,
brown shoulders over which her hair and her gilded sequins fell
in a bright mass.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Neeland, smiling.</p>

<p>"Why? Because, for one thing, you have brought war into Europe!"</p>

<p>"Come, now! No mystery!" said Sengoun gaily. "Explain how my
comrade has brought war into Europe, you little fraud!"</p>

<p>Nini looked at Neeland:</p>

<p>"What else except papers was in the box you lost?" she asked
coolly.</p>

<p>Neeland, very red and uncomfortable, gazed back at the girl without
replying; and she laughed at him, showing her white teeth.</p>

<p>"You brought the Yellow Devil into Europe, M'sieu Nilan! Erlik,
the Yellow Demon. When he travels there is unrest. Where he rests
there is war!"</p>

<p>"You're very clever," retorted Neeland, quite out of countenance.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are," said Fifi, with her quick smile. "And who but
M'sieu Nilan should admit it?"</p>

<p>"Very clever," repeated Neeland, still amazed and profoundly
uneasy. "But this Yellow Devil you say I brought into Europe must
have been resting in America, then. And, if so, why is there no
war there?"</p>

<p>"There would have been&mdash;with Mexico. You brought the Yellow Demon
here, but just in time!"</p>

<p>"All right. Grant that, then. But&mdash;perhaps he was a long time
resting in America. What about that, pretty gipsy?"</p>

<p>The girl shrugged again:</p>

<p>"Is your memory so poor, M'sieu Nilan? What has your country
done but fight since Erlik rested among your people? You fought
in Samoa; in Hawaii; your warships went to Chile, to Brazil, to
San Domingo; the blood of your soldiers and sailors was shed in
Hayti, in Cuba, in the Philippines, in China&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" exclaimed Neeland. "That girl is dead right!"</p>

<p>Sengoun threw back his handsome head and laughed without restraint;
and the gipsies laughed, too, their beautiful eyes and teeth flashing
under their black cascades of unbound hair.</p>

<p>"Show me your palms," said Nini, and drew Sengoun's and Neeland's
hands across the table, holding them in both of hers.</p>

<p>"See," she added, nudging Fifi with her shoulder, "both of them
born under the Dark Star! It is war they shall live to see&mdash;war!"</p>

<p>"Under the Dark Star, Erlik," repeated the other girl, looking
closely into the two palms, "and there is war there!"</p>

<p>"And death?" inquired Sengoun gaily. "I don't care, if I can
lead a <em>sotnia</em> up Achi-Baba and twist the gullet of the
Padisha before I say Fifi &mdash;Nini!"</p>

<p>The gipsies searched his palm with intent and brilliant gaze.</p>

<p>"<em>Zut!</em>" said Fifi. "<em>Je ne vois rien que d'l'amour
et la guerre aux dames!</em>"</p>

<p>"<em>T'en fais pas!</em>" laughed Sengoun. "I ask no further
favour of Fortune; I'll manage my regiment myself. And, listen
to me, Fifi," he added with a frightful frown, "if the war you
predict doesn't arrive, I'll come back and beat you as though
you were married to a Turk!"</p>

<p>While they still explored his palm, whispering together at intervals,
Sengoun caught the chorus of the air which the orchestra was playing,
and sang it lustily and with intense pleasure to himself.</p>

<p>Neeland, unquiet to discover how much these casual strangers
knew about his own and intimate affairs, had become silent and
almost glum.</p>

<p>But the slight gloom which invaded him came from resentment toward
those people who had followed him from Brookhollow to Paris, and
who, in the very moment of victory, had snatched that satisfaction
from him.</p>

<p>He thought of Kestner and of Breslau&mdash;of Scheherazade, and the
terrible episode in her stateroom.</p>

<p>Except that he had seized the box in the Brookhollow house, there
was nothing in his subsequent conduct on which he could plume
himself. He could not congratulate himself on his wisdom; sheer
luck had carried him through as far as the rue Soleil d'Or&mdash;mere
chance, and that capricious fortune which sometimes convoys the
stupid, fatuous, and astigmatic.</p>

<p>Then he thought of Rue Carew. And, in his bosom, an intense desire
to distinguish himself began to burn.</p>

<p>If there were any way on earth to trace that accursed box&#11834;</p>

<p>He turned abruptly and looked at the two gipsies, who had relinquished
Sangoun's hand and who were still conversing together in low tones
while Sangoun beat time on the jingling table top and sang joyously
at the top of his baritone voice:</p>

<p>"Fifi!"</p>

<p>"<em>M'sieu?</em>"</p>

<p>"You're so clever! Where is that Yellow Devil now?"</p>

<p>"Pouf!" giggled Fifi. "On its way to Berlin, <em>pardie</em>!"</p>

<p>"That's easy to say. Tell me something else more expensive."</p>

<p>Nini said, surprised:</p>

<p>"What we know is free to Prince Erlik's friend. Did you think
we sell to Russians?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about you or where you get your information,"
said Neeland. "I suppose you're in the Secret Service of the Russian
Government."</p>

<p>"<em>Mon ami</em>, Nilan," said Fifi, smiling, "we should feel
lonely <em>outside</em> the Secret Service. Few in Europe are
outside&mdash;few in the world, fewer in the half-world. As for us
Tziganes, who belong to neither, the business of everybody becomes
our secret to sell for a silver piece&mdash;but <em>not</em> to Russians
in the moment of peril!... Nor to their comrades.... What do you
desire to know, <em>comrade</em>?"</p>

<p>"Anything," he said simply, "that might help me to regain what
I have lost."</p>

<p>"And what do you suppose!" exclaimed Fifi, opening her magnificent
black eyes very wide. "Did you imagine that nobody was paying
any attention to what happened in the rue Soleil d'Or this noon?"</p>

<p>Nini laughed.</p>

<p>"The word flew as fast as the robber's taxicab. How many thousand
secret friends to the Triple Entente do you suppose knew of it
half an hour after it happened? From the Trocadero to Montparnasse,
from the Point du Jour to Charenton, from the Bois to the Bièvre,
the word flew. Every taxicab, omnibus, <em>sapin</em>, every <em>bateau-mouche</em>,
every train that left any terminal was watched.</p>

<p>"Five embassies and legations were instantly under redoubled
surveillance; hundreds of cafés, bars, restaurants, <em>hôtels</em>;
all the theatres, gardens, cabarets, <em>brasseries</em>.</p>

<p>"Your pigs of Apaches are not neglected, <em>va</em>! But, to
my idea, they got out of Paris before we watchers knew of the
affair at all&mdash;in an automobile, perhaps&mdash;perhaps by rail. God
knows," said the girl, looking absently at the dancing which had
begun again. "But if we ever lay our eyes on Minna Minti, we wear
toys in our garters which will certainly persuade her to take
a little stroll with us."</p>

<p>After a silence, Neeland said:</p>

<p>"Is Minna Minti then so well known?"</p>

<p>"Not at the Opéra Comique," replied Fifi with a shrug, "but <em>since</em>
then."</p>

<p>"An <em>artiste</em>, that woman!" added Nini. "Why deny it?
It appears that she has twisted more than one red button out of
a broadcloth coat."</p>

<p>"She'll get the Seraglio medal for this day's work," said Fifi.</p>

<p>"Or the <em>croix-de-fer</em>," added Nini. "Ah, <em>zut</em>!
She annoys me."</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of a place called the Café des Bulgars?" asked
Neeland, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What sort of place is it?"</p>

<p>"Like any other."</p>

<p>"Quite respectable?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said Nini, smiling. "One drinks good beer there."</p>

<p>"Munich beer," added Fifi.</p>

<p>"Then it is watched?" asked Neeland.</p>

<p>"All German cafés are watched. Otherwise, it is not suspected."</p>

<p>Sengoun, who had been listening, shook his head. "There's nothing
to interest us at the Café des Bulgars," he said. Then he summoned
a waiter and pointed tragically at the empty goblets.</p>
