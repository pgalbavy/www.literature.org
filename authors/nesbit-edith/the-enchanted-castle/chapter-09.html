<p><em>THERE </em>is a curtain, thin as gossamer, clear as glass,
strong as iron, that hangs for ever between the world of magic
and the world that seems to us to be real. And when once people
have found one of the little weak spots in that curtain which
are marked by magic rings, and amulets, and the like, almost anything
may happen. Thus it is not surprising that Mabel and Kathleen,
conscientiously conducting one of the dullest dolls' tea-parties
at which either had ever assisted, should suddenly, and both at
once, have felt a strange, unreasonable, but quite irresistible
desire to return instantly to the Temple of Flora&mdash;even at the
cost of leaving the dolls' tea-service in an unwashed state, and
only half the raisins eaten. They went&mdash;as one has to go when
the magic impulse drives one&mdash;against their better judgment, against
their wills almost.</p>

<p>And the nearer they came to the Temple of Flora, in the golden
hush of the afternoon, the more certain each was that they could
not possibly have done otherwise.</p>

<p>And this explains exactly how it was that when Gerald and Jimmy,
holding hands in the darkness of the passage, uttered their first
concerted yell, "just for the lark of the thing," that yell was
instantly answered from outside.</p>

<p>A crack of light showed in that part of the passage where they
had least expected the door to be. The stone door itself swung
slowly open, and they were out of it, in the Temple of Flora,
blinking in the good daylight, an unresisting prey to Kathleen's
embraces and the questionings of Mabel.</p>

<p>"And you left that Ugly-Wugly loose in London," Mabel pointed
out; "you might have wished it to be with you, too."</p>

<p>"It's all right where it is," said Gerald. "I couldn't think
of everything. And besides, no, thank you! Now we'll go home and
seal up the ring in an envelope."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> haven't done anything with the ring yet," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think you'd want to when you see the sort of things
it does with you," said Gerald.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't do things like that if <em>I</em> was wishing with
it," Kathleen protested.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Mabel, "let's just put it back in the treasure-room
and have done with it. I oughtn't ever to have taken it away,
really. It's a sort of stealing. It's quite as bad, really, as
Eliza borrowing it to astonish her gentleman friend with."</p>

<p>"I don't mind putting it back if you like," said Gerald, "only
if any of us do think of a sensible wish you'll let us have it
out again, of course?"</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," Mabel agreed.</p>

<p>So they trooped up to the castle, and Mabel once more worked
the spring that let down the panelling and showed the jewels,
and the ring was put back among the odd dull ornaments that Mabel
had once said were magic.</p>

<p>"How innocent it looks!" said Gerald. "You wouldn't think there
was any magic about it. It's just like an old silly ring. I wonder
if what Mabel said about the other things is true! Suppose we
try."</p>

<p>"<em>Don't!</em>" said Kathleen. "<em>I</em> think magic things
are spiteful. They just enjoy getting you into tight places."</p>

<p>"I'd like to try," said Mabel, "only&mdash;well, everything's been
rather upsetting, and I've forgotten what I said anything was."</p>

<p>So had the others. Perhaps that was why, when Gerald said that
a bronze buckle laid on the foot would have the effect of seven-league
boots, it didn't; when Jimmy, a little of the City man he had
been clinging to him still, said that the steel collar would ensure
your always having money in your pockets, his own remained empty;
and when Mabel and Kathleen invented qualities of the most delightful
nature for various rings and chains and brooches, nothing at all
happened.</p>

<p>"It's only the ring that's magic," said Mabel at last; "and,
I say!" she added, in quite a different voice.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Suppose even the ring isn't!"</p>

<p>"But we know it is."</p>

<p>"I don't," said Mabel. "I believe it's not to-day at all. I believe
it's the other day&mdash;we've just dreamed all these things. It's
the day I made up that nonsense about the ring."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," said Gerald; "you were in your Princess-clothes
then."</p>

<p>"What Princess-clothes?" said Mabel, opening her dark eyes very
wide.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be silly," said Gerald wearily.</p>

<p>"I'm not silly," said Mabel; "and I think it's time you went.
I'm sure Jimmy wants his tea."</p>

<p>"Of course I do," said Jimmy. "But you had got the Princess-clothes
that day. Come along; let's shut up the shutters and leave the
ring in its long home."</p>

<p>"What ring?" said Mabel.</p>

<p>"Don't take any notice of her," said Gerald. "She's only trying
to be funny."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," said Mabel; "but I'm inspired like a Python or
a Sibylline lady. What ring?"</p>

<p>"The wishing-ring," said Kathleen; "the invisibility ring."</p>

<p>"Don't you see <em>now</em>," said Mabel, her eyes wider than
ever, "the ring's what you <em>say</em> it is? That's how it came
to make us invisible &mdash;I just said it. Oh, we can't leave
it here, if that's what it is. It isn't stealing, really, when
it's as valuable as that, you see. Say what it is."</p>

<p>"It's a wishing-ring," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"We've had that before&mdash;and you had your silly wish," said Mabel,
more and more excited. "I say it isn't a wishing-ring. I say it's
a ring that makes the wearer four yards high."</p>

<p>She had caught up the ring as she spoke, and even as she spoke
the ring showed high above the children's heads on the finger
of an impossible Mabel, who was, indeed, twelve feet high.</p>

<p>"Now you've done it!" said Gerald&mdash;and he was right. It was in
vain that Mabel asserted that the ring was a wishing-ring. It
quite clearly wasn't; it was what she had said it was.</p>

<p>"And you can't tell at all how long the effect will last," said
Gerald. "Look at the invisibleness." This is difficult to do,
but the others understood him.</p>

<p>"It may last for days," said Kathleen. "Oh, Mabel, it <em>was</em>
silly of you!"</p>

<p>"That's right, rub it in," said Mabel bitterly; "you should have
believed me when I said it was what I said it was. Then I shouldn't
have had to show you, and I shouldn't be this silly size. What
am I to do now, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"We must conceal you till you get your right size again&mdash;that's
all," said Gerald practically.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but <em>where</em>?" said Mabel, stamping a foot twenty-four
inches long.</p>

<p>"In one of the empty rooms. You wouldn't be afraid?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Mabel. "Oh, I do wish we'd just put the
ring back and left it."</p>

<p>"Well, it wasn't us that didn't," said Jimmy, with more truth
than grammar.</p>

<p>"I shall put it back now," said Mabel, tugging at it.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't if I were you," said Gerald thoughtfully. "You don't
want to stay that length, do you? And unless the ring's on your
finger when the time's up, I dare say it wouldn't act."</p>

<p>The exalted Mabel sullenly touched the spring. The panels slowly
slid into place, and all the bright jewels were hidden. Once more
the room was merely eight-sided, panelled, sunlit, and unfurnished.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mabel, "where am I to hide? It's a good thing auntie
gave me leave to stay the night with you. As it is, one of you
will have to stay the night with me. I'm not going to be left
alone, the silly height I am."</p>

<p>Height was the right word; Mabel had said "four yards high"&mdash;and
she <em>was</em> four yards high. But she was hardly any thicker
than when her height was four feet seven, and the effect was,
as Gerald remarked, "wonderfully worm-like." Her clothes had,
of course, grown with her, and she looked like a little girl reflected
in one of those long bent mirrors at Rosherville Gardens, that
make stout people look so happily slender, and slender people
so sadly scraggy. She sat down suddenly on the floor, and it was
like a four-fold foot-rule folding itself up.</p>

<p>"It's no use sitting there, girl," said Gerald.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>SHE SAT DOWN SUDDENLY ON THE FLOOR, AND IT
WAS LIKE A FOUR-FOLD FOOT-RULE FOLDING ITSELF UP</em>.]</p>

<p>"I'm not sitting here," retorted Mabel; "I only got down so as
to be able to get through the door. It'll have to be hands and
knees through most places for me now, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Aren't you hungry?" Jimmy asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mabel desolately; "it's&mdash;it's such a long
way off!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll scout," said Gerald; "if the coast's clear<hr>"</p>

<p>"Look here," said Mabel, "I think I'd rather be out of doors
till it gets dark."</p>

<p>"You <em>can't</em>. Some one's certain to see you."</p>

<p>"Not if I go through the yew-hedge," said Mabel. "There's a yew-hedge
with a passage along its inside like the box-hedge in 'The Luck
of the Vails.'"</p>

<p>"In <em>what</em>?"</p>

<p>"'The Luck of the Vails.' It's a ripping book. It was that book
first set me on to hunt for hidden doors in panels and things.
If I crept along that on my front, like a serpent&mdash;it comes out
amongst the rhododendrons, close by the dinosaurus&mdash;we could camp
there."</p>

<p>"There's tea," said Gerald, who had had no dinner.</p>

<p>"That's just what there isn't," said Jimmy, who had had none
either.</p>

<p>"Oh, you <em>won't</em> desert me!" said Mabel. "Look here &mdash;I'll
write to auntie. She'll give you the things for a picnic, if she's
there and awake. If she isn't, one of the maids will."</p>

<p>So she wrote on a leaf of Gerald's invaluable pocket-book:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>DEAREST AUNTIE</em>,&mdash;

</p>
<p>
"Please may we have some things for a picnic?<br/>
Gerald will bring them. I would come myself, but I<br/>
am a little tired. I think I have been growing<br/>
rather fast.<br/>
&mdash;Your loving niece,

</p>
<p>
"<em>MABEL</em>."

</p>
<p>
"<em>P.S.<br/>
&</em>mdash;Lots, please, because some of us are very<br/>
hungry."

</p>
</div>
<p>It was found difficult, but possible, for Mabel to creep along
the tunnel in the yew-hedge. Possible, but slow, so that the three
had hardly had time to settle themselves among the rhododendrons
and to wonder bitterly what on earth Gerald was up to, to be such
a time gone, when he returned, panting under the weight of a covered
basket. He dumped it down on the fine grass carpet, groaned, and
added, "But it's worth it. Where's our Mabel?"</p>

<p>The long, pale face of Mabel peered out from rhododendron leaves,
very near the ground.</p>

<p>"I look just like anybody else like this, don't I?" she asked
anxiously; "all the rest of me's miles away, under different bushes."</p>

<p>"We've covered up the bits between the bushes with bracken and
leaves," said Kathleen, avoiding the question; "don't wriggle,
Mabel, or you'll waggle them off."</p>

<p>Jimmy was eagerly unpacking the basket. It was a generous tea.
A long loaf, butter in a cabbage-leaf, a bottle of milk, a bottle
of water, cake, and large, smooth, yellow gooseberries in a box
that had once held an extra-sized bottle of somebody's matchless
something for the hair and moustache. Mabel cautiously advanced
her incredible arms from the rhododendron and leaned on one of
her spindly elbows, Gerald cut bread and butter, while Kathleen
obligingly ran round, at Mabel's request, to see that the green
coverings had not dropped from any of the remoter parts of Mabel's
person. Then there was a happy, hungry silence, broken only by
those brief, impassioned suggestions natural to such an occasion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"More cake, please."</p>

<p>"Milk ahoy, there."</p>

<p>"Chuck us the goosegogs."</p>

<p>Everyone grew calmer&mdash;more contented with their lot. A pleasant
feeling, half tiredness and half restfulness, crept to the extremities
of the party. Even the unfortunate Mabel was conscious of it in
her remote feet, that lay crossed under the third rhododendron
to the north-north-west of the tea-party. Gerald did but voice
the feelings of the others when he said, not without regret:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I'm a new man, but I couldn't eat so much as another goosegog
if you paid me."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> could," said Mabel: "yes, I know they're all gone,
and I've had my share. But I <em>could</em>. It's me being so
long, I suppose."</p>

<p>A delicious after-food peace filled the summer air. At a little
distance the green-lichened grey of the vast stone dinosaurus
showed through the shrubs. He, too, seemed peaceful and happy.
Gerald caught his stone eye through a gap in the foliage. His
glance seemed somehow sympathetic.</p>

<p>"I dare say he liked a good meal in his day," said Gerald, stretching
luxuriously.</p>

<p>"Who did?"</p>

<p>"The dino what's-his-name," said Gerald.</p>

<p>"He had a meal to-day," said Kathleen, and giggled.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;didn't he?" said Mabel, giggling also.</p>

<p>"You mustn't laugh lower than your chest," said Kathleen anxiously,
"or your green stuff will joggle off."</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;a meal?" Jimmy asked suspiciously. "What are
you sniggering about?"</p>

<p>"He had a meal. Things to put in his inside," said Kathleen,
still giggling.</p>

<p>"Oh, be funny if you want to," said Jimmy, suddenly cross. "We
don't want to know&mdash;do we, Jerry?"</p>

<p>"I do," said Gerald witheringly; "I'm <em>dying</em> to know.
Wake me, you girls, when you've finished pretending you're not
going to tell."</p>

<p>He tilted his hat over his eyes, and lay back in the attitude
of slumber.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be stupid!" said Kathleen hastily. "It's only that
we fed the dinosaurus through the hole in his stomach with the
clothes the Ugly-Wuglies were made of!"</p>

<p>"We can take them home with us, then," said Gerald, chewing the
white end of a grass stalk, "so that's all right."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Kathleen suddenly; "I've got an idea. Let me
have the ring a bit. I won't say what the idea is, in case it
doesn't come off, and then you'd say I was silly. I'll give it
back before we go."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you aren't going yet!" said Mabel, pleading. She pulled
off the ring. "Of course," she added earnestly, "I'm only too
glad for you to try any idea, however silly it is."</p>

<p>Now, Kathleen's idea was quite simple. It was only that perhaps
the ring would change its powers if some one else renamed it&mdash;some
one who was not under the power of its enchantment. So the moment
it had passed from the long, pale hand of Mabel to one of her
own fat, warm, red paws, she jumped up, crying, "Let's go and
empty the dinosaurus <em>now</em>," and started to run swiftly
towards that prehistoric monster. She had a good start. She wanted
to say aloud, yet so that the others could not hear her, "This
is a wishing-ring. It gives you any wish you choose." And she
did say it. And no one heard her, except the birds and a squirrel
or two, and perhaps a stone faun, whose pretty face seemed to
turn a laughing look on her as she raced past its pedestal.</p>

<p>The way was uphill; it was sunny, and Kathleen had run her hardest,
though her brothers caught her up before she reached the great
black shadow of the dinosaurus. So that when she did reach that
shadow she was very hot indeed and not in any state to decide
calmly on the best wish to ask for.</p>

<p>"I'll get up and move the things down, because I know exactly
where I put them," she said.</p>

<p>Gerald made a back, Jimmy assisted her to climb up, and she disappeared
through the hole into the dark inside of the monster. In a moment
a shower began to descend from the opening&mdash;a shower of empty
waistcoats, trousers with wildly waving legs, and coats with sleeves
uncontrolled.</p>

<p>"Heads below!" called Kathleen, and down came walking-sticks
and golf-sticks and hockey-sticks and broom-sticks, rattling and
chattering to each other as they came.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Hold on a bit," said Gerald. "I'm coming up." He caught the
edge of the hole above in his hands and jumped. Just as he got
his shoulders through the opening and his knees on the edge he
heard Kathleen's boots on the floor of the dinosaurus's inside,
and Kathleen's voice saying:</p>

<p>"Isn't it jolly cool in here? I suppose statues are always cool.
I do wish I was a statue. Oh!"</p>

<p>The "oh" was a cry of horror and anguish. And it seemed to be
cut off very short by a dreadful stony silence.</p>

<p>"What's up?" Gerald asked. But in his heart he knew. He climbed
up into the great hollow. In the little light that came up through
the hole he could see something white against the grey of the
creature's sides. He felt in his pockets, still kneeling, struck
a match, and when the blue of its flame changed to clear yellow
he looked up to see what he had known he would see&mdash;the face of
Kathleen, white, stony, and lifeless. Her hair was white, too,
and her hands, clothes, shoes&mdash;everything was white, with the
hard, cold whiteness of marble. Kathleen had her wish: she was
a statue. There was a long moment of perfect stillness in the
inside of the dinosaurus. Gerald could not speak. It was too sudden,
too terrible. It was worse than anything that had happened yet.
Then he turned and spoke down out of that cold, stony silence
to Jimmy, in the green, sunny, rustling, live world outside.</p>

<p>"Jimmy," he said, in tones perfectly ordinary and matter of fact,
"Kathleen's gone and said that ring was a wishing-ring. And so
it was, of course. I see now what she was up to, running like
that. And then the young duffer went and wished she was a statue."</p>

<p>"And is she?" asked Jimmy, below.</p>

<p>"Come up and have a look," said Gerald. And Jimmy came, partly
with a pull from Gerald and partly with a jump of his own.</p>

<p>"She's a statue, right enough," he said, in awestruck tones.
"Isn't it awful!"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Gerald firmly. "Come on&mdash;let's go and tell
Mabel."</p>

<p>To Mabel, therefore, who had discreetly remained with her long
length screened by rhododendrons, the two boys returned and broke
the news. They broke it as one breaks a bottle with a pistol-shot.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>KATHLEEN HAD HER WISH: SHE WAS A STATUE</em>.]</p>

<p>"Oh, my goodness!" said Mabel, and writhed through her long length
so that the leaves and fern tumbled off in little showers, and
she felt the sun suddenly hot on the backs of her legs. "What
next? Oh, my goodness!"</p>

<p>"She'll come all right," said Gerald, with outward calm.</p>

<p>"Yes; but what about <em>me</em>?" Mabel urged. "I haven't got
the ring. And my time will be up before hers is. Couldn't you
get it back? Can't you get it off her hand? I'd put it back on
her hand the very minute I was my right size again&mdash;faithfully
I would."</p>

<p>"Well, it's nothing to blub about," said Jimmy, answering the
sniffs that had served her in this speech for commas and full-stops;
"not for you, anyway."</p>

<p>"Ah! you don't know," said Mabel; "you don't know what it is
to be as long as I am. Do&mdash;do try and get the ring. After all,
it is my ring more than any of the rest of yours, anyhow, because
I did find it, and I did say it was magic."</p>

<p>The sense of justice always present in the breast of Gerald awoke
to this appeal.</p>

<p>"I expect the ring's turned to stone&mdash;her boots have, and all
her clothes. But I'll go and see. Only if I can't, I can't, and
it's no use your making a silly fuss."</p>

<p>The first match lighted inside the dinosaurus showed the ring
dark on the white hand of the statuesque Kathleen.</p>

<p>The fingers were stretched straight out. Gerald took hold of
the ring, and, to his surprise, it slipped easily off the cold,
smooth marble finger.</p>

<p>"I say, Cathy, old girl, I am sorry," he said, and gave the marble
hand a squeeze. Then it came to him that perhaps she could hear
him. So he told the statue exactly what he and the others meant
to do. This helped to clear up his ideas as to what he and the
others did mean to do. So that when, after thumping the statue
hearteningly on its marble back, he returned to the rhododendrons,
he was able to give his orders with the clear precision of a born
leader, as he later said. And since the others had, neither of
them, thought of any plan, his plan was accepted, as the plans
of born leaders are apt to be.</p>

<p>"Here's your precious ring," he said to Mabel. "Now you're not
frightened of anything, are you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mabel, in surprise. "I'd forgotten that. Look here,
I'll stay here or farther up in the wood if you'll leave me all
the coats, so that I sha'n't be cold in the night. Then I shall
be here when Kathleen comes out of the stone again."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gerald, "that was exactly the born leader's idea."</p>

<p>"You two go home and tell Mademoiselle that Kathleen's staying
at the Towers. She is."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jimmy, "she certainly is."</p>

<p>"The magic goes in seven-hour lots," said Gerald; "your invisibility
was twenty-one hours, mine fourteen, Eliza's seven. When it was
a wishing-ring it began with seven. But there's no knowing what
number it will be really. So there's no knowing which of you will
come right first. Anyhow, we'll sneak out by the cistern window
and come down the trellis, after we've said good-night to Mademoiselle,
and come and have a look at you before we go to bed. I think you'd
better come close up to the dinosaurus and we'll leaf you over
before we go."</p>

<p>Mabel crawled into cover of the taller trees, and there stood
up looking as slender as a poplar and as unreal as the wrong answer
to a sum in long division. It was to her an easy matter to crouch
beneath the dinosaurus, to put her head up through the opening,
and thus to behold the white form of Kathleen.</p>

<p>"It's all right, dear,"' she told the stone image; "I shall be
quite close to you. You call me as soon as you feel you're coming
right again."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>MABEL LAY DOWN, WAS COVERED UP, AND LEFT</em>.]</p>

<p>The statue remained motionless, as statues usually do, and Mabel
withdrew her head, lay down, was covered up, and left. The boys
went home. It was the only reasonable thing to do. It would never
have done for Mademoiselle to become anxious and set the police
on their track. Every one felt that. The shock of discovering
the missing Kathleen, not only in a dinosaurus's stomach, but,
further, in a stone statue of herself, might well have unhinged
the mind of any constable, to say nothing of the mind of Mademoiselle,
which, being foreign, would necessarily be a mind more light and
easy to upset. While as for Mabel<hr></p>

<p>"Well, to look at her as she is now," said Gerald, "why, it would
send any one off their chump&mdash;except us."</p>

<p>"We're different," said Jimmy; "our chumps have had to jolly
well get used to things. It would take a lot to upset us now."</p>

<p>"Poor old Cathy! all the same," said Gerald.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>= = = = =</p>

<p>The sun had died away behind the black trees and the moon was
rising. Mabel, her preposterous length covered with coats, waistcoats,
and trousers laid along it, slept peacefully in the chill of the
evening. Inside the dinosaurus Kathleen, alive in her marble,
slept too. She had heard Gerald's words&mdash;had seen the lighted
matches. She was Kathleen just the same as ever, only she was
Kathleen in a case of marble that would not let her move. It would
not have let her cry, even if she wanted to. But she had not wanted
to cry. Inside, the marble was not cold or hard. It seemed, somehow,
to be softly lined with warmth and pleasantness and safety. Her
back did not ache with stooping. Her limbs were not stiff with
the hours that they had stayed moveless. Everything was well&mdash;better
than well. One had only to wait quietly and quite comfortably
and one would come out of this stone case, and once more be the
Kathleen one had always been used to being. So she waited happily
and calmly, and presently waiting changed to not waiting&mdash;to not
anything; and, close held in the soft inwardness of the marble,
she slept as peacefully and calmly as though she had been lying
in her own bed.</p>

<p>She was awakened by the fact that she was not lying in her own
bed&mdash;was not, indeed, lying at all&mdash;by the fact that she was standing
and that her feet had pins and needles in them. Her arms, too,
held out in that odd way, were stiff and tired. She rubbed her
eyes, yawned, and remembered. She had been a statue, a statue
inside the stone dinosaurus.</p>

<p>"Now I'm alive again," was her instant conclusion, "and I'll
get out of it."</p>

<p>She sat down, put her feet through the hole that showed faintly
grey in the stone beast's underside, and as she did so a long,
slow lurch threw her sideways on the stone where she sat. <em>The
dinosaurus was moving!</em></p>

<p>"<em>Oh!</em>" said Kathleen inside it, "how dreadful! It must
be moonlight, and it's come alive, like Gerald said."</p>

<p>It was indeed moving. She could see through the hole the changing
surface of grass and bracken and moss as it waddled heavily along.
She dared not drop through the hole while it moved, for fear it
should crush her to death with its gigantic feet. And with that
thought came another: where was Mabel? Somewhere&mdash;somewhere <em>near</em>?
Suppose one of the great feet planted itself on some part of Mabel's
inconvenient length? Mabel being the size she was now it would
be quite difficult not to step on some part or other of her, if
she should happen to be in one's way&mdash;quite difficult, however
much one tried. And the dinosaurus would not try. Why should it?
Kathleen hung in an agony over the round opening. The huge beast
swung from side to side. It was going faster; it was no good,
she dared not jump out. Anyhow, they must be quite away from Mabel
by now. Faster and faster went the dinosaurus. The floor of its
stomach sloped. They were going downhill. Twigs cracked and broke
as it pushed through a belt of evergreen oaks; gravel crunched,
ground beneath its stony feet. Then stone met stone. There was
a pause. A splash! They were close to water&mdash;the lake where by
moonlight Hermes fluttered and Janus and the dinosaurus swam together.
Kathleen dropped swiftly through the hole on to the flat marble
that edged the basin, rushed sideways, and stood panting in the
shadow of a statue's pedestal. Not a moment too soon, for even
as she crouched the monster lizard slipped heavily into the water,
drowning a thousand smooth, shining lily pads, and swam away towards
the central island.</p>

<p>"Be still, little lady. I leap!" The voice came from the pedestal,
and next moment Phœbus had jumped from the pedestal in his little
temple, clearing the steps, and landing a couple of yards away.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>MABEL LAY DOWN, WAS COVERED UP, AND LEFT</em>.]</p>

<p>"You are new," said Phœbus over his graceful shoulder. "I should
not have forgotten you if once I had seen you."</p>

<p>"I am," said Kathleen, "quite, quite new. And I didn't know you
could talk."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Phœbus laughed. "You can talk."</p>

<p>"But I'm alive."</p>

<p>"Am not I?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I suppose so," said Kathleen, distracted, but not afraid;
"only I thought you had to have the ring on before one could even
see you move."</p>

<p>Phœbus seemed to understand her, which was rather to his credit,
for she had certainly not expressed herself with clearness.</p>

<p>"Ah! that's for mortals," he said. "<em>We</em> can hear and
see each other in the few moments when life is ours. That is a
part of the beautiful enchantment."</p>

<p>"But I am a mortal," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"You are as modest as you are charming," said Phœbus Apollo absently;
"the white water calls me! I go," and the next moment rings of
liquid silver spread across the lake, widening and widening, from
the spot where the white joined hands of the Sun-god had struck
the water as he dived.</p>

<p>Kathleen turned and went up the hill towards the rhododendron
bushes. She must find Mabel, and they must go home at once. If
only Mabel was of a size that one could conveniently take home
with one! Most likely, at this hour of enchantments, she was.
Kathleen, heartened by the thought, hurried on. She passed through
the rhododendron bushes, remembered the pointed painted paper
face that had looked out from the glossy leaves, expected to be
frightened&mdash;and wasn't. She found Mabel easily enough, and much
more easily than she would have done had Mabel been as she wished
to find her. For quite a long way off, in the moonlight, she could
see that long and worm-like form, extended to its full twelve
feet&mdash;and covered with coats and trousers and waistcoats. Mabel
looked like a drain-pipe that has been covered in sacks in frosty
weather. Kathleen touched her long cheek gently, and she woke.</p>

<p>"What's up?" she said sleepily.</p>

<p>"It's only me," Kathleen explained.</p>

<p>"How cold your hands are!" said Mabel.</p>

<p>"Wake up," said Kathleen, "and let's talk."</p>

<p>"Can't we go home now? I'm awfully tired, and it's so long since
tea-time."</p>

<p>"<em>You're</em> too long to go home yet," said Kathleen sadly,
and then Mabel remembered.</p>

<p>She lay with closed eyes&mdash;then suddenly she stirred and cried
out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! Cathy, I feel so funny&mdash;like one of those horn snakes when
you make it go short to get it into its box. I am&mdash;yes &mdash;I
know I am<hr>"</p>

<p>She was; and Kathleen, watching her, agreed that it was exactly
like the shortening of a horn spiral snake between the closing
hands of a child. Mabel's distant feet drew near &mdash;Mabel's
long, lean arms grew shorter &mdash;Mabel's face was no longer
half a yard long.</p>

<p>"You're coming right&mdash;you are! Oh, I am so glad!" cried Kathleen.</p>

<p>"I know <em>I</em> am," said Mabel; and as she said it she became
once more Mabel, not only in herself, which, of course, she had
been all the time, but in her outward appearance.</p>

<p>"You are all right. Oh, hooray! hooray! I <em>am</em> so glad!"
said Kathleen kindly; "and now we'll go home at once, dear."</p>

<p>"Go home?" said Mabel, slowly sitting up and staring at Kathleen
with her big dark eyes. "Go home&mdash;like that?"</p>

<p>"Like what?" Kathleen asked impatiently.</p>

<p>"Why, <em>you</em>," was Mabel's odd reply.</p>

<p>"I'm all right," said Kathleen. "Come on."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you don't know?" said Mabel. "Look at yourself&mdash;your
hands&mdash;your dress&mdash;everything."</p>

<p>Kathleen looked at her hands. They were of marble whiteness.
Her dress, too&mdash;her shoes, her stockings, even the ends of her
hair. She was white as new-fallen snow.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, beginning to tremble. "What am I all
this horrid colour for?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see? Oh, Cathy, don't you see? You've <em>not</em>
come right. You're a statue still."</p>

<p>"I'm not&mdash;I'm alive &mdash;I'm talking to you."</p>

<p>"I know you are, darling," said Mabel, soothing her as one soothes
a fractious child. "That's because it's moonlight."</p>

<p>"But you can see I'm alive."</p>

<p>"Of course I can. I've got the ring."</p>

<p>"But I'm all right; I <em>know</em> I am."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<em>WHAT IS IT?" SHE ASKED, BEGINNING TO TREMBLE.
"WHAT AM I ALL THIS HORRID COLOUR FOR</em>?"]</p>

<p>"Don't you see," said Mabel gently, taking her white marble hand,
"you're not all right? It's moonlight, and you're a statue, and
you've just come alive with all the other statues. And when the
moon goes down you'll just be a statue again. <em>That's</em>
the difficulty, dear, about our going home again. You're just
a statue still, only you've come alive with the other marble things.
Where's the dinosaurus?"</p>

<p>"In his bath," said Kathleen, "and so are all the other stone
beasts."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mabel, trying to look on the bright side of things,
"then we've got one thing, at any rate, to be thankful for!"</p>
