<p>  To risk your life unless there's need   Is downright foolishness
indeed.</p>

<p>Never forget that. Never do such a crazy thing as Peter Rabbit
was doing. What was he doing? Why, he was running the risk of
being caught by Reddy Fox all for the sake of a joke. Did you
ever hear of anything more foolish? Yet Peter was no different
from a lot of people who every day risk their lives in the most
careless and heedless ways just to save a few minutes of time
or for some other equally foolish reason. The fact is, Peter didn't
stop to think what dreadful thing might happen if his plans didn't
work out as he intended. He didn't once think of little Mrs. Peter
over in the dear Old Briar-patch and how she would feel if he
never came home again. That's the trouble with thoughtlessness;
it never remembers other people.</p>

<p>All the time that Reddy Fox was creeping along behind the old
stone wall on the edge of the Old Orchard, Peter knew just where
he was, though Reddy didn't know that. If he had known it, he
would have suspected one of Peter's tricks.</p>

<p>"He'll peep over that wall, and just as soon as he sees me, he
will feel sure that this time he will catch me," thought Peter.
"He will steal along to that place where the wall is lowest and
will jump over it right there. I must be ready to jump the very
second he does."</p>

<p>It all happened just as Peter had expected. While seeming to
be paying no attention to anything but to Sammy Jay, he kept his
eyes on that low place in the old wall, and presently he saw Reddy's
sharp nose, as Reddy peeped over to make sure that he was still
there. The instant that sharp nose dropped out of sight, Peter
made ready to run for his life. A second later, Reddy leaped over
the wall, and Peter was off as hard as he could go, with Reddy
almost at his heels. Sammy Jay, who had been so busy calling Peter
names that he hadn't seen Reddy at all, forgot all about his quarrel
with Peter.</p>

<p>"Go it, Peter! Go it!" he screamed excitedly. That was just like
Sammy.</p>

<p>Peter did go it. He had to. He ran with all his might. Reddy
grinned as he saw Peter start towards the Green Meadows. It was
a long way to the dear Old Briar-patch, and Reddy didn't have
any doubt at all that he would catch Peter before he got there.
He watched sharply for Peter to dodge and try to get back to the
old stone wall. He didn't mean to let Peter do that. But Peter
didn't even try. He ran straight for the edge of the hill above
the Green Meadows. Then, for the first time, Reddy noticed an
old barrel there lying on its side.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he thinks he can hide in that," thought Reddy, and
grinned again, for he remembered that he had passed that old barrel
a few days before, and that one end was open while the other end
was closed. "If he tries that, I will get him without the trouble
of much of a chase," thought Reddy, and chuckled.</p>

<p>Lipperty-lipperty-lip ran Peter, lipperty-lipperty-lip, Reddy
right at his heels! To Sammy Jay it looked as if in a few more
jumps Reddy certainly would catch Peter. "Go it, Peter! Oh, go
it! Go it!" screamed Sammy, for in spite of his quarrels with
Peter, he didn't want to see him come to any real harm.</p>

<p>Just as he reached the old barrel, Reddy was so close to him
that Peter was almost sure that he could feel Reddy's breath.
Then Peter made a splendid flying jump right over the old barrel
and kept on down the hill, lipperty-lipperty-lip, as fast as ever
he could, straight for an old house of Johnny Chuck's of which
he knew. When he reached it, he turned to see what was happening
behind him, for he knew by the screaming of Sammy Jay and by other
sounds that a great deal was happening. In fact, he suspected
that the joke which he had planned was working out just as he
had hoped it would.</p>
