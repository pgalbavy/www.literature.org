<p>The midsummer sun was stinging hot outside the little barber-shop
next to the corner drug store and Penrod, undergoing a toilette
preliminary to his very slowly approaching twelfth birthday, was
adhesive enough to retain upon his face much hair as it fell from
the shears. There is a mystery here: the tonsorial processes are
not unagreeable to manhood; in truth, they are soothing; but the
hairs detached from a boy's head get into his eyes, his ears,
his nose, his mouth, and down his neck, and he does everywhere
itch excruciatingly. Wherefore he blinks, winks, weeps, twitches,
condenses his countenance, and squirms; and perchance the barber's
scissors clip more than intended&mdash;belike an outlying flange of
ear.</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;muh &mdash;OW!" said Penrod, this thing having happened.</p>

<p>"D' I touch y' up a little?" inquired the barber, smiling falsely.</p>

<p>"Ooh &mdash;UH!" The boy in the chair offered inarticulate protest,
as the wound was rubbed with alum.</p>

<p>"<em>THAT </em>don't hurt!" said the barber. "You <em>WILL </em>get
it, though, if you don't sit stiller," he continued, nipping in
the bud any attempt on the part of his patient to think that he
already had "it."</p>

<p>"Pfuff!" said Penrod, meaning no disrespect, but endeavoring
to dislodge a temporary moustache from his lip.</p>

<p>"You ought to see how still that little Georgie Bassett sits,"
the barber went on, reprovingly. "I hear everybody says he's the
best boy in town."</p>

<p>"Pfuff! <em>PHIRR!" </em>There was a touch of intentional contempt
in this.</p>

<p>"I haven't heard nobody around the neighbourhood makin' no such
remarks," added the barber, "about nobody of the name of Penrod
Schofield."</p>

<p>"Well," said Penrod, clearing his mouth after a struggle, "who
wants 'em to? Ouch!"</p>

<p>"I hear they call Georgie Bassett the 'little gentleman,'" ventured
the barber, provocatively, meeting with instant success.</p>

<p>"They better not call ME that," returned Penrod truculently.
"I'd like to hear anybody try. Just once, that's all! I bet they'd
never try it ag-&mdash;<em>OUCH</em>!"</p>

<p>"Why? What'd you do to 'em?"</p>

<p>"It's all right what I'd DO! I bet they wouldn't want to call
me that again long as they lived!"</p>

<p>"What'd you do if it was a little girl? You wouldn't hit her,
would you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'd-&mdash;Ouch!"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't hit a little girl, would you?" the barber persisted,
gathering into his powerful fingers a mop of hair from the top
of Penrod's head and pulling that suffering head into an unnatural
position. "Doesn't the Bible say it ain't never right to hit the
weak sex?"</p>

<p>"Ow! <em>SAY, </em>look <em>OUT</em>!"</p>

<p>"So you'd go and punch a pore, weak, little girl, would you?"
said the barber, reprovingly.</p>

<p>"Well, who said I'd hit her?" demanded the chivalrous Penrod.
"I bet I'd <em>FIX </em>her though, all right. She'd see!"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't call her names, would you?"</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't! What hurt is it to call anybody names?"</p>

<p>"Is that SO!" exclaimed the barber. "Then you was intending what
I heard you hollering at Fisher's grocery delivery wagon driver
fer a favour, the other day when I was goin' by your house, was
you? I reckon I better tell him, because he says to me after-<em>WERDS
</em>if he ever lays eyes on you when you ain't in your own yard,
he's goin' to do a whole lot o' things you ain't goin' to like!
Yessir, that's what he says to ME!"</p>

<p>"He better catch me first, I guess, before he talks so much."</p>

<p>"Well," resumed the barber, "that ain't sayin' what you'd do
if a young lady ever walked up and called you a little gentleman.
<em>I</em> want to hear what you'd do to her. I guess I know,
though&mdash;come to think of it."</p>

<p>"What?" demanded Penrod.</p>

<p>"You'd sick that pore ole dog of yours on her cat, if she had
one, I expect," guessed the barber derisively.</p>

<p>"No, I would not!"</p>

<p>"Well, what <em>WOULD </em>you do?"</p>

<p>"I'd do enough. Don't worry about that!"</p>

<p>"Well, suppose it was a boy, then: what'd you do if a boy come
up to you and says, 'Hello, little gentleman'?"</p>

<p>"He'd be lucky," said Penrod, with a sinister frown, "if he got
home alive."</p>

<p>"Suppose it was a boy twice your size?"</p>

<p>"Just let him try," said Penrod ominously. "You just let him
try. He'd never see daylight again; that's all!"</p>

<p>The barber dug ten active fingers into the helpless scalp before
him and did his best to displace it, while the anguished Penrod,
becoming instantly a seething crucible of emotion, misdirected
his natural resentment into maddened brooding upon what he would
do to a boy "twice his size" who should dare to call him "little
gentleman." The barber shook him as his father had never shaken
him; the barber buffeted him, rocked him frantically to and fro;
the barber seemed to be trying to wring his neck; and Penrod saw
himself in staggering zigzag pictures, destroying large, screaming,
fragmentary boys who had insulted him.</p>

<p>The torture stopped suddenly; and clenched, weeping eyes began
to see again, while the barber applied cooling lotions which made
Penrod smell like a coloured housemaid's ideal.</p>

<p>"Now what," asked the barber, combing the reeking locks gently,
"what would it make you so mad fer, to have somebody call you
a little gentleman? It's a kind of compliment, as it were, you
might say. What would you want to hit anybody fer <em>THAT </em>fer?"</p>

<p>To the mind of Penrod, this question was without meaning or reasonableness.
It was within neither his power nor his desire to analyze the
process by which the phrase had become offensive to him, and was
now rapidly assuming the proportions of an outrage. He knew only
that his gorge rose at the thought of it.</p>

<p>"You just let 'em try it!" he said threateningly, as he slid
down from the chair. And as he went out of the door, after further
conversation on the same subject, he called back those warning
words once more: "Just let 'em try it! Just once&mdash;that's all <em>I</em>
ask 'em to. They'll find out what they <em>GET</em>!"</p>

<p>The barber chuckled. Then a fly lit on the barber's nose and
he slapped at it, and the slap missed the fly but did not miss
the nose. The barber was irritated. At this moment his birdlike
eye gleamed a gleam as it fell upon customers approaching: the
prettiest little girl in the world, leading by the hand her baby
brother, Mitchy-Mitch, coming to have Mitchy-Mitch's hair clipped,
against the heat.</p>

<p>It was a hot day and idle, with little to feed the mind&mdash;and
the barber was a mischievous man with an irritated nose. He did
his worst.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the brooding Penrod pursued his homeward way; no great
distance, but long enough for several one-sided conflicts with
malign insulters made of thin air. "You better <em>NOT </em>call
me that!" he muttered. "You just try it, and you'll get what other
people got when <em>THEY </em>tried it. You better not ack fresh
with ME! Oh, you <em>WILL, </em>will you?" He delivered a vicious
kick full upon the shins of an iron fence-post, which suffered
little, though Penrod instantly regretted his indiscretion. "Oof!"
he grunted, hopping; and went on after bestowing a look of awful
hostility upon the fence-post. "I guess you'll know better next
time," he said, in parting, to this antagonist. "You just let
me catch you around here again and I'll&#11834;" His voice sank to
inarticulate but ominous murmurings. He was in a dangerous mood.</p>

<p>Nearing home, however, his belligerent spirit was diverted to
happier interests by the discovery that some workmen had left
a caldron of tar in the cross-street, close by his father's stable.
He tested it, but found it inedible. Also, as a substitute for
professional chewing-gum it was unsatisfactory, being insufficiently
boiled down and too thin, though of a pleasant, lukewarm temperature.
But it had an excess of one quality&mdash;it was sticky. It was the
stickiest tar Penrod had ever used for any purposes whatsoever,
and nothing upon which he wiped his hands served to rid them of
it; neither his polka-dotted shirt waist nor his knickerbockers;
neither the fence, nor even Duke, who came unthinkingly wagging
out to greet him, and retired wiser.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, tar is tar. Much can be done with it, no matter
what its condition; so Penrod lingered by the caldron, though
from a neighbouring yard could be heard the voices of comrades,
including that of Sam Williams. On the ground about the caldron
were scattered chips and sticks and bits of wood to the number
of a great multitude. Penrod mixed quantities of this refuse into
the tar, and interested himself in seeing how much of it he could
keep moving in slow swirls upon the ebon surface.</p>

<p>Other surprises were arranged for the absent workmen. The caldron
was almost full, and the surface of the tar near the rim.</p>

<p>Penrod endeavoured to ascertain how many pebbles and brickbats,
dropped in, would cause an overflow. Labouring heartily to this
end, he had almost accomplished it, when he received the suggestion
for an experiment on a much larger scale. Embedded at the corner
of a grassplot across the street was a whitewashed stone, the
size of a small watermelon and serving no purpose whatever save
the questionable one of decoration. It was easily pried up with
a stick; though getting it to the caldron tested the full strength
of the ardent labourer. Instructed to perform such a task, he
would have sincerely maintained its impossibility but now, as
it was unbidden, and promised rather destructive results, he set
about it with unconquerable energy, feeling certain that he would
be rewarded with a mighty splash. Perspiring, grunting vehemently,
his back aching and all muscles strained, he progressed in short
stages until the big stone lay at the base of the caldron. He
rested a moment, panting, then lifted the stone, and was bending
his shoulders for the heave that would lift it over the rim, when
a sweet, taunting voice, close behind him, startled him cruelly.</p>

<p>"How do you do, <em>LITTLE GENTLEMAN</em>!"</p>

<p>Penrod squawked, dropped the stone, and shouted, "Shut up, you
dern fool!" purely from instinct, even before his about-face made
him aware who had so spitefully addressed him.</p>

<p>It was Marjorie Jones. Always dainty, and prettily dressed, she
was in speckless and starchy white to-day, and a refreshing picture
she made, with the new-shorn and powerfully scented Mitchy-Mitch
clinging to her hand. They had stolen up behind the toiler, and
now stood laughing together in sweet merriment. Since the passing
of Penrod's Rupe Collins period he had experienced some severe
qualms at the recollection of his last meeting with Marjorie and
his Apache behaviour; in truth, his heart instantly became as
wax at sight of her, and he would have offered her fair speech;
but, alas! in Marjorie's wonderful eyes there shone a consciousness
of new powers for his undoing, and she denied him opportunity.</p>

<p>"Oh, OH!" she cried, mocking his pained outcry. "What a way for
a <em>LITTLE GENTLEMAN </em>to talk! Little gentleman don't say
wicked&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Marjorie!" Penrod, enraged and dismayed, felt himself stung
beyond all endurance. Insult from her was bitterer to endure than
from any other. "Don't you call me that again!"</p>

<p>"Why not, <em>LITTLE GENTLEMAN</em>?"</p>

<p>He stamped his foot. "You better stop!"</p>

<p>Marjorie sent into his furious face her lovely, spiteful laughter.</p>

<p>"Little gentleman, little gentleman, little gentleman!" she said
deliberately. "How's the little gentleman, this afternoon? Hello,
little gentleman!"</p>

<p>Penrod, quite beside himself, danced eccentrically. "Dry up!"
he howled. "Dry up, dry up, dry up, dry UP!"</p>

<p>Mitchy-Mitch shouted with delight and applied a finger to the
side of the caldron&mdash;a finger immediately snatched away and wiped
upon a handkerchief by his fastidious sister.</p>

<p>"'Ittle gellamun!" said Mitchy-Mitch.</p>

<p>"You better look out!" Penrod whirled upon this small offender
with grim satisfaction. Here was at least something male that
could without dishonour be held responsible. "You say that again,
and I'll give you the worst&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You will <em>NOT!" </em>snapped Marjorie, instantly vitriolic.
"He'll say just whatever he wants to, and he'll say it just as
<em>MUCH </em>as he wants to. Say it again, Mitchy-Mitch!"</p>

<p>"'Ittle gellamun!" said Mitchy-Mitch promptly.</p>

<p>"Ow-<em>YAH!" </em>Penrod's tone-production was becoming affected
by his mental condition. "You say that again, and I'll&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Go on, Mitchy-Mitch," cried Marjorie. "He can't do a thing.
He don't <em>DARE! </em>Say it some more, Mitchy-Mitch&mdash;say it
a whole lot!"</p>

<p>Mitchy-Mitch, his small, fat face shining with confidence in
his immunity, complied.</p>

<p>"'Ittle gellamun!" he squeaked malevolently. "'Ittle gellamun!
'Ittle gellamun! 'Ittle gellamun!"</p>

<p>The desperate Penrod bent over the whitewashed rock, lifted it,
and then&mdash;outdoing Porthos, John Ridd, and Ursus in one miraculous
burst of strength&mdash;heaved it into the air.</p>

<p>Marjorie screamed.</p>

<p>But it was too late. The big stone descended into the precise
midst of the caldron and Penrod got his mighty splash. It was
far, far beyond his expectations.</p>

<p>Spontaneously there were grand and awful effects&mdash;volcanic spectacles
of nightmare and eruption. A black sheet of eccentric shape rose
out of the caldron and descended upon the three children, who
had no time to evade it.</p>

<p>After it fell, Mitchy-Mitch, who stood nearest the caldron, was
the thickest, though there was enough for all. Br'er Rabbit would
have fled from any of them.</p>
