<p>These spring days were beautiful days on the Green Meadows. It
seemed to Johnny Chuck that the Green Meadows never had been so
lovely or the songs of the birds so sweet. He had forgotten all
about his old friends, Jimmy Skunk and Peter Rabbit and the other
little meadow people.</p>

<p>You see, he couldn't think of anybody but Polly Chuck, and he
didn't want to be with anybody but Polly Chuck. He had even forgotten
that he had started out to see the world. He didn't care anything
more about the world. All he wanted was to be where Polly Chuck
was. Then he was perfectly happy. That was because Johnny Chuck
had found the greatest thing in the world, which is love. But
Johnny still had one great wish, the wish that he might show Polly
Chuck just how brave and strong he was and how well he could take
care of her.</p>

<p>One morning they were feasting in a patch of sweet clover over
near an old stone wall. It was the same stone wall in which Johnny
Chuck had escaped from old Whitetail the Marshhawk, when Johnny
was a very little fellow.</p>

<p>Suddenly Polly gave a little scream of fright. Johnny Chuck looked
up to see a dog almost upon her. Johnny's first thought was to
run to the old stone wall. He was nearer to it than Polly was.
Then he saw that that dreadful dog would catch Polly before she
could reach the stone wall.</p>

<p>A great rage filled Johnny's heart, just as it had when he had
fought the old gray Chuck. Every hair stood on end, not with fear,
but with anger, and he sprang in front of Polly.</p>

<p>"Run, Polly, run!" he cried, and Polly ran.</p>

<p>But Johnny didn't run. Oh, my, no! Johnny didn't run. He drew
himself together ready to spring. He showed all his sharp teeth
and ground them savagely. Little sparks of fire seemed to snap
out of his eyes. There was no sign of fear in Johnny Chuck then,
not the least little bit. Just in front of him the dog stopped
and barked. He was a little dog, a young and foolish dog, and
he was terribly excited. He barked until he almost lost his breath.
He didn't like the looks of Johnny Chuck's sharp teeth. So he
circled around Johnny, trying to get behind him. But Johnny turned
as the dog circled, and always the little dog found those sharp
teeth directly in front of him. He barked and barked, until it
seemed as if he would bark his head off.</p>

<p>Finally the little dog, who was young and foolish, grew tired
of just dancing around and barking. "Pooh!" said he to himself.
"He's nothing but a Chuck!" Then he stopped barking and sprang
straight at Johnny with an ugly growl.</p>

<p>Johnny Chuck was ready for him and he was quicker than the little
dog. His sharp teeth closed on one of the little dog's ears, and
he held on while with his stout claws he scratched and tore.</p>

<p>The little dog, who was young and foolish and hadn't yet learned
how to fight, couldn't get hold of Johnny Chuck anywhere. Then
he tried to shake Johnny Chuck off, but he couldn't, because Johnny
held on to that ear with his sharp teeth.</p>

<p>"Kiyi-yi-yi-yi!" yelled the little dog, for those teeth hurt
dreadfully. "Kiyi-yi-yi-yi!"</p>

<p>Over and over they rolled and tumbled, the little dog trying
to get away, and Johnny Chuck holding on to the little dog's ear.
Finally Johnny had to let go to get his breath. The little dog
sprang to his feet and started for home across the Green Meadows
as fast as he could run.</p>

<p>Johnny Chuck shook himself and grinned, as he heard the little
dog's "Kiyi-yi-yi" grow fainter and fainter. "I'm glad it wasn't
Bowser the Hound," muttered Johnny Chuck, as he started towards
the old stone wall. There he found Polly Chuck peeping out at
him, and all of a tremble with fright.</p>

<p>"My, how brave you are!" said Polly Chuck.</p>

<p>"Pooh, that's nothing!" replied Johnny Chuck.</p>
