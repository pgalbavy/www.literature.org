<p>"Your overcoat, Mr. Potter!" called that faithful servitor as
Potter was going out through the theatre with old Tinker and Canby.
"You've forgotten your overcoat, sir."</p>

<p>"I don't want it."</p>

<p>"Yes sir; but it's a little raw to-day." He leaped down into
the orchestra from the high stage, striking his knee upon a chair
with violence, but, pausing not an instant for that, came running
up the aisle carrying the overcoat. "You might want it after you
get out into the air, Mr. Potter. I'm sure Mr. Tinker or Mr. Canby
won't mind taking charge of it for you until you feel like putting
it on."</p>

<p>"Lord! Don't make such a fuss, Packer. Put it on me&mdash;put it on
me!"</p>

<p>He extended his arms behind him, and was enveloped solicitously
and reverently in the garment.</p>

<p>"Confound him!" said Potter good-humouredly, as they came out
into the lobby. "It is chilly; he's usually right, the idiot!"</p>

<p>Turning from Broadway, at the corner, they went over to Fifth
Avenue, where Potter's unconsciousness of the people who recognized
and stared at him was, as usual, one of the finest things he did,
either upon the stage or "off." Superb performance as it was,
it went for nothing with Stewart Canby, who did not even see it,
for he walked entranced, not in a town, but through orchards in
bloom.</p>

<p>If Wanda Malone had remained with him, clear and insistent after
yesterday's impersonal vision of her at rehearsal, what was she
now, when every tremulous lilt of the zither-string voice, and
every little gesture of the impulsive hands, and every eager change
of the glowing face, were fresh and living, in all their beautiful
reality, but a matter of minutes past? He no longer resisted the
bewitchment; he wanted all of it. His companions and himself were
as trees walking, and when they had taken their seats at a table
in the men's restaurant of a hotel where he had never been, he
was not roused from his rapturous apathy even by the conduct of
probably the most remarkable maitre d'hotel in the world.</p>

<p>"You don't git 'em!" said this personage briefly, when Potter
had ordered chops and "oeufs a la creole" and lettuce salad, from
a card. "You got to eat partridge and asparagus tips salad!"</p>

<p>And he went away, leaving the terrible Potter resigned and unrebellious.</p>

<p>The partridge was undeniable when it came; a stuffed man would
have eaten it. But Talbot Potter and his two guests did little
more than nibble it; they neither ate nor talked, and yet they
looked anything but unhappy. Detached from their surroundings,
as they sat over their coffee, they might have been taken to be
three poetic gentlemen listening to a serenade.</p>

<p>After a long and apparently satisfactory silence, Talbot Potter
looked at his watch, but not, as it proved, to see if it was time
to return to the theatre, his ensuing action being to send a messenger
to procure a fresh orchid to take the place of the one that had
begun to droop a little from his buttonhold. He attached the new
one with an attentive gravity shared by his companions.</p>

<p>"Good thing, a boutonniere," he explained. "Lighten it up a little.
Rehearsal's dry work, usually. Thinking about it last night. Why
not lighten it up a little? Why shouldn't an actor dress as well
for a company of strangers at a reception? Ought to make it as
cheerful as we can."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tinker, nodding. "Something in that. I believe they
work better. I must say I never saw much better work than those
people were doing this morning. It was a fine rehearsal."</p>

<p>"It's a fine company," Potter said warmly. "They're the best
people I ever had. They're all good, every one of them, and they're
putting their hearts into this play. It's the kind of work that
makes me proud to be an actor. I am proud to be an actor! Is there
anything better?"  He touched the young playwright on the arm,
a gesture that hinted affection. "Stewart Canby," he said, "I
want to tell you I think we're going to make a big thing out of
this play. It's going to be the best I've ever done. It's going
to be beautiful!"</p>

<p>From the doorway into the lobby of the hotel there came a pretty
sound of girlish voices whispering and laughing excitedly, and,
glancing that way, the three men beheld a group of peering nymphs
who fled, delighted.</p>

<p>"Ladies stop to rubber at Mr. Potter," explained the remarkable
headwaiter over the star's shoulder. "Mr. Potter, it's time you
got marrit, anyhow. You git marrit, you don't git stared at so
much!" He paused not for a reply, but hastened away to countermand
the order of another customer.</p>

<p>"Married," said Potter musingly. "Well, there is such a thing
as remaining a bachelor too long&mdash;even for an actor."</p>

<p>"Widower, either," assented Mr. Tinker as from a gentle reverie.
"A man's never too old to get married."</p>

<p>His employer looked at him somewhat disapprovingly, but said
nothing; and presently the three rose, without vocal suggestion
from any of them, and strolled thoughtfully back to the theatre,
pausing a moment by the way, while Tinker bought a white carnation
for his buttonhole. There was a good deal, he remarked absent-mindedly,
in what Mr. Potter had said about lightening up a rehearsal.</p>

<p>Probably there never was a more lightened-up rehearsal than that
afternoon's. Potter's amiability continued;&mdash;nay, it increased:
he was cordial; he was angelic; he was exalted and unprecedented.
A stranger would have thought Packer the person in control; and
the actors, losing their nervousness, were allowed to display
not only their energy but their intelligence. The stage became
a cheery workshop, where ambition flourished and kindness was
the rule. For thus did the starry happiness that glowed within
the beatific bosom of the little "ingenue" make Arcady around
her.</p>

<p>At four o'clock Talbot Potter stepped to the front of the stage
and lifted his hand benevolently. "That will do for to-day," he
said, facing the company. "Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.
I have never had a better rehearsal, and I think it is only your
due to say you have pleased me very much, indeed. I cannot tell
you how much. I feel strongly assured of our success in this play.
Again I thank you. Ladies and gentlemen"&mdash;he waved his hand in
dismissal&mdash;"till to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"By Joles!" old Carson Tinker muttered. "I never knew anything
like it!"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ah &mdash;Packer," called the star, as the actors moved
toward the doors. "Packer, ask Miss&mdash;Malone to wait a moment.
I want &mdash;I'd like to go over a little business in the next
act before tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Potter?" It was she who answered, turning eagerly to
him.</p>

<p>"In a moment, Miss Malone." He spoke to the stage-manager in
a low tone, and the latter came down into the auditorium, where
Canby and Tinker had remained in their seats.</p>

<p>"He says for you not to wait, gentlemen. There's nothing more
to do this afternoon, and he may be detained quite a time."</p>

<p>The violet boutonniere and the white carnation went somewhat
reluctantly up the aisle together, and, after a last glance back
at the stage from the doorway, found themselves in the colder
air of the lobby, a little wilted.</p>

<p>Bidding Tinker farewell, on the steps of the theatre, Canby walked
briskly out to the Park, and there, abating his energy, paced
the loneliest paths he could find until long after dark. They
were not lonely for him; a radiant presence went with him through
the twilight. She was all about him: in the blue brightness of
the afterglow, in the haze of the meadow stretches, and in the
elusive woodland scents that vanished as he caught them;&mdash;she
was in the rosy vapour wreaths on the high horizon, in the laughter
of children playing somewhere in the darkness, in the twinkling
of the lights that began to show&mdash;for now she was wherever a lover
finds his lady, and that is everywhere. He went over and over
their talk of the morning, rehearsing wonderful things he would
say to her upon the morrow, and taking the liberty of suggesting
replies from her even more wonderful. It was a rhapsody; he was
as happy as Tom o'Bedlam.</p>

<p>By and by, he went to a restaurant in the Park and ordered food
to be brought him. Then, after looking at it with an expression
of fixed animation for half an hour, he paid for it and went home.
He let himself into the boarding-house quietly, having hazy impressions
that he was not popular there, also that it might be embarrassing
to encounter Miss Cornish in the hall; and, after reconnoitering
the stairway, went cautiously up to his room.</p>

<p>Three minutes later he came bounding down again, stricken white,
and not caring if he encountered the devil. On his table he had
found a package&mdash;the complete manuscript of "Roderick Hanscom"
and this scrawl:</p>

<p>Canby,</p>

<p>I can't produce your play&mdash;everything off.</p>

<p>Y'rs,</p>

<p>Tal't P'r.</p>
