Those who had seen Edgar Caswall familiarly since his arrival, and
had already estimated his cold-blooded nature at something of its
true value, were surprised that he took so to heart the death of old
Chester.  The fact was that not one of them had guessed correctly at
his character.  They thought, naturally enough, that the concern
which he felt was that of a master for a faithful old servant of his
family.  They little thought that it was merely the selfish
expression of his disappointment, that he had thus lost the only
remaining clue to an interesting piece of family history--one which
was now and would be for ever wrapped in mystery.  Caswall knew
enough about the life of his ancestor in Paris to wish to know more
fully and more thoroughly all that had been.  The period covered by
that ancestor's life in Paris was one inviting every form of
curiosity.
<P>
Lady Arabella, who had her own game to play, saw in the METIER of
sympathetic friend, a series of meetings with the man she wanted to
secure.  She made the first use of the opportunity the day after old
Chester's death; indeed, as soon as the news had filtered in through
the back door of Diana's Grove.  At that meeting, she played her
part so well that even Caswall's cold nature was impressed.
<P>
Oolanga was the only one who did not credit her with at least some
sense of fine feeling in the matter.  In emotional, as in other
matters, Oolanga was distinctly a utilitarian, and as he could not
understand anyone feeling grief except for his own suffering, pain,
or for the loss of money, he could not understand anyone simulating
such an emotion except for show intended to deceive.  He thought
that she had come to Castra Regis again for the opportunity of
stealing something, and was determined that on this occasion the
chance of pressing his advantage over her should not pass.  He felt,
therefore, that the occasion was one for extra carefulness in the
watching of all that went on.  Ever since he had come to the
conclusion that Lady Arabella was trying to steal the treasure-
chest, he suspected nearly everyone of the same design, and made it
a point to watch all suspicious persons and places.  As Adam was
engaged on his own researches regarding Lady Arabella, it was only
natural that there should be some crossing of each other's tracks.
This is what did actually happen.
<P>
Adam had gone for an early morning survey of the place in which he
was interested, taking with him the mongoose in its box.  He arrived
at the gate of Diana's Grove just as Lady Arabella was preparing to
set out for Castra Regis on what she considered her mission of
comfort.  Seeing Adam from her window going through the shadows of
the trees round the gate, she thought that he must be engaged on
some purpose similar to her own.  So, quickly making her toilet, she
quietly left the house, and, taking advantage of every shadow and
substance which could hide her, followed him on his walk.
<P>
Oolanga, the experienced tracker, followed her, but succeeded in
hiding his movements better than she did.  He saw that Adam had on
his shoulder a mysterious box, which he took to contain something
valuable.  Seeing that Lady Arabella was secretly following Adam, he
was confirmed in this idea.  His mind--such as it was--was fixed on
her trying to steal, and he credited her at once with making use of
this new opportunity.
<P>
In his walk, Adam went into the grounds of Castra Regis, and Oolanga
saw her follow him with great secrecy.  He feared to go closer, as
now on both sides of him were enemies who might make discovery.
When he realised that Lady Arabella was bound for the Castle, he
devoted himself to following her with singleness of purpose.  He
therefore missed seeing that Adam branched off the track and
returned to the high road.
<P>
That night Edgar Caswall had slept badly.  The tragic occurrence of
the day was on his mind, and he kept waking and thinking of it.
After an early breakfast, he sat at the open window watching the
kite and thinking of many things.  From his room he could see all
round the neighbourhood, but the two places that interested him most
were Mercy Farm and Diana's Grove.  At first the movements about
those spots were of a humble kind--those that belong to domestic
service or agricultural needs--the opening of doors and windows, the
sweeping and brushing, and generally the restoration of habitual
order.
<P>
From his high window--whose height made it a screen from the
observation of others--he saw the chain of watchers move into his
own grounds, and then presently break up--Adam Salton going one way,
and Lady Arabella, followed by the nigger, another.  Then Oolanga
disappeared amongst the trees; but Caswall could see that he was
still watching.  Lady Arabella, after looking around her, slipped in
by the open door, and he could, of course, see her no longer.
<P>
Presently, however, he heard a light tap at his door, then the door
opened slowly, and he could see the flash of Lady Arabella's white
dress through the opening.
