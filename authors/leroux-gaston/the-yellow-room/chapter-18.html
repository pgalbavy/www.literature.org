<p>(<em>EXTRACT FROM THE NOTE-BOOK OF JOSEPH ROULETABILLE, </em>continued)</p>

<p>"We separated on the thresholds of our rooms, with a melancholy
shake of the hands. I was glad to have aroused in him a suspicion
of error. His was an original brain, very intelligent but&mdash;without
method. I did not go to bed. I awaited the coming of daylight
and then went down to the front of the chateau, and made a detour,
examining every trace of footsteps coming towards it or going
from it. These, however, were so mixed and confusing that I could
make nothing of them. Here I may make a remark, &mdash;I am not
accustomed to attach an exaggerated importance to exterior signs
left in the track of a crime.</p>

<p>"The method which traces the criminal by means of the tracks
of his footsteps is altogether primitive. So many footprints are
identical. However, in the disturbed state of my mind, I did go
into the deserted court and did look at all the footprints I could
find there, seeking for some indication, as a basis for reasoning.</p>

<p>"If I could but find a right starting-point! In despair I seated
myself on a stone. For over an hour I busied myself with the common,
ordinary work of a policeman. Like the least intelligent of detectives
I went on blindly over the traces of footprints which told me
just no more than they could.</p>

<p>"I came to the conclusion that I was a fool, lower in the scale
of intelligence than even the police of the modern romancer. Novelists
build mountains of stupidity out of a footprint on the sand, or
from an impression of a hand on the wall. That’s the way innocent
men are brought to prison. It might convince an examining magistrate
or the head of a detective department, but it’s not proof. You
writers forget that what the senses furnish is not proof. If I
am taking cognisance of what is offered me by my senses I do so
but to bring the results within the circle of my reason. That
circle may be the most circumscribed, but if it is, it has this
advantage&mdash;it holds nothing but the truth! Yes, I swear that I
have never used the evidence of the senses but as servants to
my reason. I have never permitted them to become my master. They
have not made of me that monstrous thing,&mdash;worse than a blind
man,&mdash;a man who sees falsely. And that is why I can triumph over
your error and your merely animal intelligence, Frederic Larsan.</p>

<p>"Be of good courage, then, friend Rouletabille; it is impossible
that the incident of the inexplicable gallery should be outside
the circle of your reason. You know that! Then have faith and
take thought with yourself and forget not that you took hold of
the right end when you drew that circle in your brain within which
to unravel this mysterious play of circumstance.</p>

<p>"To it, once again! Go&mdash;back to the gallery. Take your stand
on your reason and rest there as Frederic Larsan rests on his
cane. You will then soon prove that the great Fred is nothing
but a fool.</p>

<p>&mdash;30th October. Noon.</p>

<p><em>JOSEPH ROULETABILLE</em>."</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>"I acted as I planned. With head on fire, I retraced my way to
the gallery, and without having found anything more than I had
seen on the previous night, the right hold I had taken of my reason
drew me to something so important that I was obliged to cling
to it to save myself from falling.</p>

<p>"Now for the strength and patience to find sensible traces to
fit in with my thinking&mdash;and these must come within the circle
I have drawn between the two bumps on my forehead!</p>

<p>&mdash;30th of October. Midnight."</p>
