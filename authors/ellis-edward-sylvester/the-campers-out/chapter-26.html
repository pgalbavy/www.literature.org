<p>Bob Budd played the part of pendulum to the bear for perhaps
ten minutes or less, during which he kept up his outcries, and
Tom and Jim laughed till they were in danger of falling from their
perch in the tree.</p>

<p>"If Bob had only known what was coming," said Tom, "he could
have had his trousers lined with sheet iron, and then he might
have joined in the laugh too."</p>

<p>"Why don’t he give the bear a kick with his foot and knock him
over? He ought to have knowed enough to climb a big tree like
us."</p>

<p>"Helloa! what’s up now?"</p>

<p>Without any apparent reason bruin at this moment dropped down
on all fours, and, leaving Bob Budd to himself, lumbered over
under the refuge of the other two fugitives.</p>

<p>They felt no special fear, for it seemed impossible that the
animal could do them harm.</p>

<p>Bob’s experience was not lost upon him. He realized the mistake
he made when he took refuge in the sapling, and he now repaired
it before the opportunity passed.</p>

<p>Letting go, he dropped lightly on his feet and ran for another
tree double the size of the hickory, up which he hurriedly climbed
to where the limbs put out a dozen feet above the ground.</p>

<p>Here, as he flung one leg over the strong support, he felt that
at last he was safe against a regiment of bears.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, bruin was giving attention to Messrs. James McGovern
and Thomas Wagstaff.</p>

<p>He first walked deliberately around the tree several times, as
if searching for some vulnerable point, occasionally looking up
at the grinning youngsters and snuffing like one impatient to
secure his dinner.</p>

<p>"I wonder what he means by <em>that</em>" said Jim, with a vague
feeling of alarm.</p>

<p>"He wants us to see what a big fellow he is."</p>

<p>"He is a bouncer and no mistake," was the truthful comment of
Jim.</p>

<p>"I wouldn’t care if he was ten times as large—good gracious!
look at <em>that</em>!"</p>

<p>Well might the boys start in alarm, for at that moment the brute
began climbing the tree!</p>

<p>They had lost sight of the fact, if indeed they ever knew it,
that the black bear is a famous climber when the trunks are big
enough to be grasped without his paws interfering.</p>

<p>While Tom and Jim were congratulating themselves on being safe
beyond all possible harm, they discovered they were not safe at
all.</p>

<p>Bruin was on the point of ascending to their perch, when he was
tempted aside by the shouting of Bob Budd in the sapling, and
he went off to have some sport with him.</p>

<p>Why the brute should have left Bob at the time he had him within
reach it would be hard to say. It may have been he concluded that
the single lad had afforded him enough entertainment, and the
moment had come for the other two to take a hand.</p>

<p>The consternation of Tom and Jim may be imagined when they saw
those massive paws embrace the shaggy bark, which began to crumble
beneath the vigorous clawing of the nails, while the huge black
body slowly but steadily ascended toward the limbs, where the
white-faced youngsters watched his terrifying action.</p>

<p>Bob’s turn had come to laugh, and he called out:</p>

<p>"Wait till he gets up among the branches, then drop and run for
a tree that is too small for him to climb."</p>

<p>This was good advice perhaps, though it occurred to the boys,
for whom it was intended, that if they allowed their foe to approach
that near it would be too late for them to flee.</p>

<p>Bruin had not very far to ascend when his huge, pig-like head
was thrust among the limbs, and he slowly drew his ponderous body
after him.</p>

<p>He was now close to the fugitives, one of whom was perched above
the other, and both as far out on the branches as they could get
without breaking them.</p>

<p>The big, shaggy form being fairly among the limbs, at the point
where they put out from the tree, bruin paused a minute, like
a general surveying the battle plain before him.</p>

<p>There were the two cowering boys about a dozen feet off, apparently
without any hope of escaping his wrathful appetite. All he had
to do was to make his way out on the branches and gather them
in.</p>

<p>It will be seen that there was some difficulty in the bear’s
path, since his weight would not allow him to advance clear to
his victims, unless he used some other limb for his support.</p>

<p>As ill-luck would have it, the very means required was at his
command.</p>

<p>Directly beneath Tom and Jim was another branch, broad and strong
enough to support two large bears. It was so near the ground that
the boys used the limbs immediately above, with a view of making
sure they were beyond the reach of the biggest kind of animal
on <em>terra firma</em>.</p>

<p>"<em>Here he comes!</em>"</p>

<p>It was Tom who uttered the exclamation, and he spoke the truth,
for at that moment bruin began cautiously moving out on the heavy
limb just under them.</p>

<p>"It’s a good time to leave," whispered Jim, who, while the words
were in his mouth, let go and dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>Tom was but an instant behind him, imitating him so quickly,
indeed, that he struck directly upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>But no harm was done, and they were instantly up and off.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this that the couple adopted substantially
the advice of Bob Budd, which contained more wisdom than most
of his utterances.</p>

<p>Like their leader, the fugitives heeded the dearly bought lesson,
and, instead of taking refuge in a large tree or sapling, they
chose one of precisely the right size, each perching himself where
he was as far beyond reach as Bob Budd himself.</p>

<p>The lads were given plenty of time in which to take their new
departure, since the bear, instead of leaping to the ground as
they did, picked his way back to the body of the tree, and slid
down that to the earth, tearing off a lot of the bark in his descent.</p>

<p>This required so much time that when he once more stood on solid
earth all three of the boys were out of his reach, and could afford
to laugh at his anger.</p>

<p>Halting a short distance from the tree, bruin looked at the boys
in turn with such an odd expression that they laughed.</p>

<p>Gradually the idea appeared to work itself into the thick brain
of the animal that there was nothing to be made by remaining in
that particular part of the country, though his reluctance to
leave caused no little misgiving on the part of all three of the
youths.</p>

<p>If he should decide to stay until the party were compelled to
choose between starving to death and coming down, the situation,
to say the least, would have its inconveniences.</p>

<p>"There he goes!" exclaimed Jim, a quarter of an hour after this
possible complication had been discussed by the youngsters from
their different perches.</p>

<p>The bear seemed to have decided that it was useless to hang around
the neighborhood, and began moving off in his lumbering fashion.
He was attentively watched until he vanished in the dense wood.</p>

<p>"We’re all right <em>now</em>" called Bob.</p>

<p>"Maybe he is trying to fool us," suggested Tom; "you had better
stay where you are awhile longer."</p>

<p>"Who’s afraid?" defiantly called back Bob, sliding nimbly down
the sapling; "you don’t catch me running from a bear again; all
I want is a chance to get hold of my gun and load it—Jewhilakens!"</p>

<p>A roar of laughter broke from Jim and Tom, who at that moment
caught sight of the brute coming back at a faster rate than he
had departed.</p>

<p>Bob was equally quick in descrying his danger, and the manner
in which he shinned up the sapling would have surprised a trained
athlete, who could not have surpassed it.</p>

<p>"When is the fraud going to leave?" he growled, looking down
on the intruder that had stopped directly under him; "I don’t
know whether bears are good waiters, but I hope he won’t try to
keep us here more than a week."</p>

<p>Bruin went snuffing around the spot, clawing the guns curiously,
gazing up at each lad in turn, and finally starting off once more.</p>

<p>The boys hoped his departure was for good, but you may be sure
they did not discount it. When, however, a half-hour went by without
his being seen, all felt there was ground for hope.</p>

<p>It seemed safe to experiment a little, and so Bob once more slid
down the sapling, after carefully reconnoitering all the forest
in his field of vision. He held himself ready also to climb again
the instant the beast reappeared.</p>

<p>The boys were too frightened to attempt any jokes on each other,
and when Tom and Jim reported that bruin was not in sight, Bob
believed them.</p>

<p>His gun was lying not far off, and he began timidly making his
way toward it. Step by step he advanced, glancing in every direction,
and ready to dart back the instant he saw or heard anything suspicious.</p>

<p>Finally he stooped over and picked up the weapon. Still the bear
was invisible, and Bob hurriedly reloaded his gun, though it cannot
be claimed that he felt much more secure than before.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Tom and Jim ventured to descend from their respective
trees, and they also recovered their weapons without bringing
their enemy down upon them.</p>

<p>"It must be he’s gone for good," said Jim, in a guarded undertone.</p>

<p>"It looks that way," replied Tom, "and the best thing we can
do is to follow suit."</p>

<p>This was the unanimous sentiment, and it was acted upon without
delay.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that a single member of the Piketon Rangers
breathed freely until fully a half-mile from the scene of their
adventure with the bear.</p>

<p>The slightest noise caused them to start and gaze around with
rapidly-beating hearts; they spoke only a few words and they were
in undertones, while they paused a half-dozen times in the belief
that some stump or dark-colored boulder was the dreaded brute
awaiting their approach.</p>

<p>But by the time the half-mile was passed they grew more confident.
They spoke in ordinary tones, and did not start at the sound of
every rustling leaf.</p>

<p>"That’s the last hunt I ever make up there," said Jim McGovern,
turning about and glaring at the mountainous slope as though it
had done him a personal injury.</p>

<p>"I’m with you," replied Tom Wagstaff; "them as like to have their
brains banged out by bucks ten feet high or chawed up by bears
as big as an elephant are welcome, but not any for me."</p>

<p>"I feel sort of that way myself," assented Bob; "it’s the first
time I’ve tried it since I was a tot of a boy, but I’ve had enough
to last me for the next three hundred and eighty-five years. I
hope Uncle Jim won’t ask too many questions about Hero, because
he thought a good deal of that hound."</p>

<p>"He needn’t ever know that he departed this life through a mysterious
dispensation of Providence," replied Jim; "all that it is necessary
to learn—and I don’t know that there’s any need of <em>that</em>—is
that Hero went off on an exploring expedition and hasn’t yet returned.
The particulars of his shipwreck are unobtainable, as is often
the case with other explorers."</p>

<p>"Oh! I can manage it, I’ve no doubt, for I was never yet caught
in a scrape that I couldn’t get out of," was the cheerful response
of Bob Budd.</p>

<p>The day was well gone when the three reached their tent at the
base of Mount Barclay, and they were glad enough to get back again.</p>

<p>During their absence Aunt Ruth had sent one of the hired men,
as was her custom, with a liberal supply of delicacies, which
were disposed of in the usual vigorous style of the three, who
were honest when they agreed that they had had enough hunting
of bears and deer to last them a lifetime.</p>

<p>"If we could only manage the thing without so much work," said
Bob, "we might find some fun in it; but we had to climb up that
mountain, which is three times as high as I supposed, and when
the danger came, why we hadn’t our usual strength."</p>

<p>"I think we did pretty well," replied Tom Wagstaff, "but all
the same I don’t believe it would read very well in print."</p>

<p>"Who’s going to put it in print?" asked Bob; "we know too much
to tell any one about it, or, if we did, we would get it in a
shape that would do us proud."</p>

<p>"Well, being as we have had all we want of hunting, the next
thing will be—what?"</p>

<p>"Doing nothing," replied Wagstaff.</p>

<p>"We can do the next thing to that, which is just as good."</p>

<p>"What’s that?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Fish; stretch out along-shore in the shade, where there’s no
danger of rolling in, or go out in a boat and wait for the fish
to bite, not caring much whether they do or not. The best thing
about fishing is that you never have to tire yourself—"</p>

<p>"<em>Hark!</em>"</p>

<p>At that moment the three heard a prodigious roar, rapidly increasing
in volume, until the air seemed to be filled with one continuous
reverberating peal of thunder.</p>

<p>"Heaven save us!" exclaimed Bob Budd; "the dam has burst!"</p>

<p>"And it is coming down on us and we can’t get out of its path!"
added white-faced Wagstaff.</p>

<p>He spoke the truth!</p>
