<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>At a quarter-past three in the afternoon of the following Saturday
Ralph Denham sat on the bank of the lake in Kew Gardens, dividing
the dial-plate of his watch into sections with his forefinger.
The just and inexorable nature of time itself was reflected in
his face. He might have been composing a hymn to the unhasting
and unresting march of that divinity. He seemed to greet the lapse
of minute after minute with stern acquiescence in the inevitable
order. His expression was so severe, so serene, so immobile, that
it seemed obvious that for him at least there was a grandeur in
the departing hour which no petty irritation on his part was to
mar, although the wasting time wasted also high private hopes
of his own.</p>

<p>His face was no bad index to what went on within him. He was
in a condition of mind rather too exalted for the trivialities
of daily life. He could not accept the fact that a lady was fifteen
minutes late in keeping her appointment without seeing in that
accident the frustration of his entire life. Looking at his watch,
he seemed to look deep into the springs of human existence, and
by the light of what he saw there altered his course towards the
north and the midnight.... Yes, one’s voyage must be made absolutely
without companions through ice and black water&mdash;towards what goal?
Here he laid his finger upon the half-hour, and decided that when
the minute-hand reached that point he would go, at the same time
answering the question put by another of the many voices of consciousness
with the reply that there was undoubtedly a goal, but that it
would need the most relentless energy to keep anywhere in its
direction. Still, still, one goes on, the ticking seconds seemed
to assure him, with dignity, with open eyes, with determination
not to accept the second-rate, not to be tempted by the unworthy,
not to yield, not to compromise. Twenty-five minutes past three
were now marked upon the face of the watch. The world, he assured
himself, since Katharine Hilbery was now half an hour behind her
time, offers no happiness, no rest from struggle, no certainty.
In a scheme of things utterly bad from the start the only unpardonable
folly is that of hope. Raising his eyes for a moment from the
face of his watch, he rested them upon the opposite bank, reflectively
and not without a certain wistfulness, as if the sternness of
their gaze were still capable of mitigation. Soon a look of the
deepest satisfaction filled them, though, for a moment, he did
not move. He watched a lady who came rapidly, and yet with a trace
of hesitation, down the broad grass-walk towards him. She did
not see him. Distance lent her figure an indescribable height,
and romance seemed to surround her from the floating of a purple
veil which the light air filled and curved from her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Here she comes, like a ship in full sail," he said to himself,
half remembering some line from a play or poem where the heroine
bore down thus with feathers flying and airs saluting her. The
greenery and the high presences of the trees surrounded her as
if they stood forth at her coming. He rose, and she saw him; her
little exclamation proved that she was glad to find him, and then
that she blamed herself for being late.</p>

<p>"Why did you never tell me? I didn’t know there was this," she
remarked, alluding to the lake, the broad green space, the vista
of trees, with the ruffled gold of the Thames in the distance
and the Ducal castle standing in its meadows. She paid the rigid
tail of the Ducal lion the tribute of incredulous laughter.</p>

<p>"You’ve never been to Kew?" Denham remarked.</p>

<p>But it appeared that she had come once as a small child, when
the geography of the place was entirely different, and the fauna
included certainly flamingoes and, possibly, camels. They strolled
on, refashioning these legendary gardens. She was, as he felt,
glad merely to stroll and loiter and let her fancy touch upon
anything her eyes encountered&mdash;a bush, a park-keeper, a decorated
goose&mdash;as if the relaxation soothed her. The warmth of the afternoon,
the first of spring, tempted them to sit upon a seat in a glade
of beech-trees, with forest drives striking green paths this way
and that around them. She sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"It’s so peaceful," she said, as if in explanation of her sigh.
Not a single person was in sight, and the stir of the wind in
the branches, that sound so seldom heard by Londoners, seemed
to her as if wafted from fathomless oceans of sweet air in the
distance.</p>

<p>While she breathed and looked, Denham was engaged in uncovering
with the point of his stick a group of green spikes half smothered
by the dead leaves. He did this with the peculiar touch of the
botanist. In naming the little green plant to her he used the
Latin name, thus disguising some flower familiar even to Chelsea,
and making her exclaim, half in amusement, at his knowledge. Her
own ignorance was vast, she confessed. What did one call that
tree opposite, for instance, supposing one condescended to call
it by its English name? Beech or elm or sycamore? It chanced,
by the testimony of a dead leaf, to be oak; and a little attention
to a diagram which Denham proceeded to draw upon an envelope soon
put Katharine in possession of some of the fundamental distinctions
between our British trees. She then asked him to inform her about
flowers. To her they were variously shaped and colored petals,
poised, at different seasons of the year, upon very similar green
stalks; but to him they were, in the first instance, bulbs or
seeds, and later, living things endowed with sex, and pores, and
susceptibilities which adapted themselves by all manner of ingenious
devices to live and beget life, and could be fashioned squat or
tapering, flame-colored or pale, pure or spotted, by processes
which might reveal the secrets of human existence. Denham spoke
with increasing ardor of a hobby which had long been his in secret.
No discourse could have worn a more welcome sound in Katharine’s
ears. For weeks she had heard nothing that made such pleasant
music in her mind. It wakened echoes in all those remote fastnesses
of her being where loneliness had brooded so long undisturbed.</p>

<p>She wished he would go on for ever talking of plants, and showing
her how science felt not quite blindly for the law that ruled
their endless variations. A law that might be inscrutable but
was certainly omnipotent appealed to her at the moment, because
she could find nothing like it in possession of human lives. Circumstances
had long forced her, as they force most women in the flower of
youth, to consider, painfully and minutely, all that part of life
which is conspicuously without order; she had had to consider
moods and wishes, degrees of liking or disliking, and their effect
upon the destiny of people dear to her; she had been forced to
deny herself any contemplation of that other part of life where
thought constructs a destiny which is independent of human beings.
As Denham spoke, she followed his words and considered their bearing
with an easy vigor which spoke of a capacity long hoarded and
unspent. The very trees and the green merging into the blue distance
became symbols of the vast external world which recks so little
of the happiness, of the marriages or deaths of individuals. In
order to give her examples of what he was saying, Denham led the
way, first to the Rock Garden, and then to the Orchid House.</p>

<p>For him there was safety in the direction which the talk had
taken. His emphasis might come from feelings more personal than
those science roused in him, but it was disguised, and naturally
he found it easy to expound and explain. Nevertheless, when he
saw Katharine among the orchids, her beauty strangely emphasized
by the fantastic plants, which seemed to peer and gape at her
from striped hoods and fleshy throats, his ardor for botany waned,
and a more complex feeling replaced it. She fell silent. The orchids
seemed to suggest absorbing reflections. In defiance of the rules
she stretched her ungloved hand and touched one. The sight of
the rubies upon her finger affected him so disagreeably that he
started and turned away. But next moment he controlled himself;
he looked at her taking in one strange shape after another with
the contemplative, considering gaze of a person who sees not exactly
what is before him, but gropes in regions that lie beyond it.
The far-away look entirely lacked self-consciousness. Denham doubted
whether she remembered his presence. He could recall himself,
of course, by a word or a movement&mdash;but why? She was happier thus.
She needed nothing that he could give her. And for him, too, perhaps,
it was best to keep aloof, only to know that she existed, to preserve
what he already had&mdash;perfect, remote, and unbroken. Further, her
still look, standing among the orchids in that hot atmosphere,
strangely illustrated some scene that he had imagined in his room
at home. The sight, mingling with his recollection, kept him silent
when the door was shut and they were walking on again.</p>

<p>But though she did not speak, Katharine had an uneasy sense that
silence on her part was selfishness. It was selfish of her to
continue, as she wished to do, a discussion of subjects not remotely
connected with any human beings. She roused herself to consider
their exact position upon the turbulent map of the emotions. Oh
yes&mdash;it was a question whether Ralph Denham should live in the
country and write a book; it was getting late; they must waste
no more time; Cassandra arrived to-night for dinner; she flinched
and roused herself, and discovered that she ought to be holding
something in her hands. But they were empty. She held them out
with an exclamation.</p>

<p>"I’ve left my bag somewhere&mdash;where?" The gardens had no points
of the compass, so far as she was concerned. She had been walking
for the most part on grass&mdash;that was all she knew. Even the road
to the Orchid House had now split itself into three. But there
was no bag in the Orchid House. It must, therefore, have been
left upon the seat. They retraced their steps in the preoccupied
manner of people who have to think about something that is lost.
What did this bag look like? What did it contain?</p>

<p>"A purse&mdash;a ticket&mdash;some letters, papers," Katharine counted,
becoming more agitated as she recalled the list. Denham went on
quickly in advance of her, and she heard him shout that he had
found it before she reached the seat. In order to make sure that
all was safe she spread the contents on her knee. It was a queer
collection, Denham thought, gazing with the deepest interest.
Loose gold coins were tangled in a narrow strip of lace; there
were letters which somehow suggested the extreme of intimacy;
there were two or three keys, and lists of commissions against
which crosses were set at intervals. But she did not seem satisfied
until she had made sure of a certain paper so folded that Denham
could not judge what it contained. In her relief and gratitude
she began at once to say that she had been thinking over what
Denham had told her of his plans.</p>

<p>He cut her short. "Don’t let’s discuss that dreary business."</p>

<p>"But I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It’s a dreary business. I ought never to have bothered you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you decided, then?"</p>

<p>He made an impatient sound. "It’s not a thing that matters."</p>

<p>She could only say rather flatly, "Oh!"</p>

<p>"I mean it matters to me, but it matters to no one else. Anyhow,"
he continued, more amiably, "I see no reason why you should be
bothered with other people’s nuisances."</p>

<p>She supposed that she had let him see too clearly her weariness
of this side of life.</p>

<p>"I’m afraid I’ve been absent-minded," she began, remembering
how often William had brought this charge against her.</p>

<p>"You have a good deal to make you absent-minded," he replied.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, flushing. "No," she contradicted herself.
"Nothing particular, I mean. But I was thinking about plants.
I was enjoying myself. In fact, I’ve seldom enjoyed an afternoon
more. But I want to hear what you’ve settled, if you don’t mind
telling me."</p>

<p>"Oh, it’s all settled," he replied. "I’m going to this infernal
cottage to write a worthless book."</p>

<p>"How I envy you," she replied, with the utmost sincerity.</p>

<p>"Well, cottages are to be had for fifteen shillings a week."</p>

<p>"Cottages are to be had&mdash;yes," she replied. "The question is&mdash;"
She checked herself. "Two rooms are all I should want," she continued,
with a curious sigh; "one for eating, one for sleeping. Oh, but
I should like another, a large one at the top, and a little garden
where one could grow flowers. A path&mdash;so&mdash;down to a river, or
up to a wood, and the sea not very far off, so that one could
hear the waves at night. Ships just vanishing on the horizon&mdash;"
She broke off. "Shall you be near the sea?"</p>

<p>"My notion of perfect happiness," he began, not replying to her
question, "is to live as you’ve said."</p>

<p>"Well, now you can. You will work, I suppose," she continued;
"you’ll work all the morning and again after tea and perhaps at
night. You won’t have people always coming about you to interrupt."</p>

<p>"How far can one live alone?" he asked. "Have you tried ever?"</p>

<p>"Once for three weeks," she replied. "My father and mother were
in Italy, and something happened so that I couldn’t join them.
For three weeks I lived entirely by myself, and the only person
I spoke to was a stranger in a shop where I lunched&mdash;a man with
a beard. Then I went back to my room by myself and&mdash;well, I did
what I liked. It doesn’t make me out an amiable character, I’m
afraid," she added, "but I can’t endure living with other people.
An occasional man with a beard is interesting; he’s detached;
he lets me go my way, and we know we shall never meet again. Therefore,
we are perfectly sincere&mdash;a thing not possible with one’s friends."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," Denham replied abruptly.</p>

<p>"Why ‘nonsense’?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Because you don’t mean what you say," he expostulated.</p>

<p>"You’re very positive," she said, laughing and looking at him.
How arbitrary, hot-tempered, and imperious he was! He had asked
her to come to Kew to advise him; he then told her that he had
settled the question already; he then proceeded to find fault
with her. He was the very opposite of William Rodney, she thought;
he was shabby, his clothes were badly made, he was ill versed
in the amenities of life; he was tongue-tied and awkward to the
verge of obliterating his real character. He was awkwardly silent;
he was awkwardly emphatic. And yet she liked him.</p>

<p>"I don’t mean what I say," she repeated good-humoredly. "Well&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I doubt whether you make absolute sincerity your standard in
life," he answered significantly.</p>

<p>She flushed. He had penetrated at once to the weak spot&mdash;her
engagement, and had reason for what he said. He was not altogether
justified now, at any rate, she was glad to remember; but she
could not enlighten him and must bear his insinuations, though
from the lips of a man who had behaved as he had behaved their
force should not have been sharp. Nevertheless, what he said had
its force, she mused; partly because he seemed unconscious of
his own lapse in the case of Mary Datchet, and thus baffled her
insight; partly because he always spoke with force, for what reason
she did not yet feel certain.</p>

<p>"Absolute sincerity is rather difficult, don’t you think?" she
inquired, with a touch of irony.</p>

<p>"There are people one credits even with that," he replied a little
vaguely. He was ashamed of his savage wish to hurt her, and yet
it was not for the sake of hurting her, who was beyond his shafts,
but in order to mortify his own incredibly reckless impulse of
abandonment to the spirit which seemed, at moments, about to rush
him to the uttermost ends of the earth. She affected him beyond
the scope of his wildest dreams. He seemed to see that beneath
the quiet surface of her manner, which was almost pathetically
at hand and within reach for all the trivial demands of daily
life, there was a spirit which she reserved or repressed for some
reason either of loneliness or&mdash;could it be possible&mdash;of love.
Was it given to Rodney to see her unmasked, unrestrained, unconscious
of her duties? a creature of uncalculating passion and instinctive
freedom? No; he refused to believe it. It was in her loneliness
that Katharine was unreserved. "I went back to my room by myself
and I did&mdash;what I liked."  She had said that to him, and in saying
it had given him a glimpse of possibilities, even of confidences,
as if he might be the one to share her loneliness, the mere hint
of which made his heart beat faster and his brain spin. He checked
himself as brutally as he could. He saw her redden, and in the
irony of her reply he heard her resentment.</p>

<p>He began slipping his smooth, silver watch in his pocket, in
the hope that somehow he might help himself back to that calm
and fatalistic mood which had been his when he looked at its face
upon the bank of the lake, for that mood must, at whatever cost,
be the mood of his intercourse with Katharine. He had spoken of
gratitude and acquiescence in the letter which he had never sent,
and now all the force of his character must make good those vows
in her presence.</p>

<p>She, thus challenged, tried meanwhile to define her points. She
wished to make Denham understand.</p>

<p>"Don’t you see that if you have no relations with people it’s
easier to be honest with them?" she inquired. "That is what I
meant. One needn’t cajole them; one’s under no obligation to them.
Surely you must have found with your own family that it’s impossible
to discuss what matters to you most because you’re all herded
together, because you’re in a conspiracy, because the position
is false&mdash;" Her reasoning suspended itself a little inconclusively,
for the subject was complex, and she found herself in ignorance
whether Denham had a family or not. Denham was agreed with her
as to the destructiveness of the family system, but he did not
wish to discuss the problem at that moment.</p>

<p>He turned to a problem which was of greater interest to him.</p>

<p>"I’m convinced," he said, "that there are cases in which perfect
sincerity is possible&mdash;cases where there’s no relationship, though
the people live together, if you like, where each is free, where
there’s no obligation upon either side."</p>

<p>"For a time perhaps," she agreed, a little despondently. "But
obligations always grow up. There are feelings to be considered.
People aren’t simple, and though they may mean to be reasonable,
they end"&mdash;in the condition in which she found herself, she meant,
but added lamely&mdash;"in a muddle."</p>

<p>"Because," Denham instantly intervened, "they don’t make themselves
understood at the beginning. I could undertake, at this instant,"
he continued, with a reasonable intonation which did much credit
to his self-control, "to lay down terms for a friendship which
should be perfectly sincere and perfectly straightforward."</p>

<p>She was curious to hear them, but, besides feeling that the topic
concealed dangers better known to her than to him, she was reminded
by his tone of his curious abstract declaration upon the Embankment.
Anything that hinted at love for the moment alarmed her; it was
as much an infliction to her as the rubbing of a skinless wound.</p>

<p>But he went on, without waiting for her invitation.</p>

<p>"In the first place, such a friendship must be unemotional,"
he laid it down emphatically. "At least, on both sides it must
be understood that if either chooses to fall in love, he or she
does so entirely at his own risk. Neither is under any obligation
to the other. They must be at liberty to break or to alter at
any moment. They must be able to say whatever they wish to say.
All this must be understood."</p>

<p>"And they gain something worth having?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It’s a risk&mdash;of course it’s a risk," he replied. The word</p>

<p>was one that she had been using frequently in her arguments with
herself of late.</p>

<p>"But it’s the only way&mdash;if you think friendship worth having,"
he concluded.</p>

<p>"Perhaps under those conditions it might be," she said reflectively.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "those are the terms of the friendship I wish
to offer you." She had known that this was coming, but, none the
less, felt a little shock, half of pleasure, half of reluctance,
when she heard the formal statement.</p>

<p>"I should like it," she began, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Would Rodney mind?"</p>

<p>"Oh no," she replied quickly.</p>

<p>"No, no, it isn’t that," she went on, and again came to an end.
She had been touched by the unreserved and yet ceremonious way
in which he had made what he called his offer of terms, but if
he was generous it was the more necessary for her to be cautious.
They would find themselves in difficulties, she speculated; but,
at this point, which was not very far, after all, upon the road
of caution, her foresight deserted her. She sought for some definite
catastrophe into which they must inevitably plunge. But she could
think of none. It seemed to her that these catastrophes were fictitious;
life went on and on&mdash;life was different altogether from what people
said. And not only was she at an end of her stock of caution,
but it seemed suddenly altogether superfluous. Surely if any one
could take care of himself, Ralph Denham could; he had told her
that he did not love her. And, further, she meditated, walking
on beneath the beech-trees and swinging her umbrella, as in her
thought she was accustomed to complete freedom, why should she
perpetually apply so different a standard to her behavior in practice?
Why, she reflected, should there be this perpetual disparity between
the thought and the action, between the life of solitude and the
life of society, this astonishing precipice on one side of which
the soul was active and in broad daylight, on the other side of
which it was contemplative and dark as night? Was it not possible
to step from one to the other, erect, and without essential change?
Was this not the chance he offered her&mdash;the rare and wonderful
chance of friendship? At any rate, she told Denham, with a sigh
in which he heard both impatience and relief, that she agreed;
she thought him right; she would accept his terms of friendship.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, "let’s go and have tea."</p>

<p>In fact, these principles having been laid down, a great lightness
of spirit showed itself in both of them. They were both convinced
that something of profound importance had been settled, and could
now give their attention to their tea and the Gardens. They wandered
in and out of glass-houses, saw lilies swimming in tanks, breathed
in the scent of thousands of carnations, and compared their respective
tastes in the matter of trees and lakes. While talking exclusively
of what they saw, so that any one might have overheard them, they
felt that the compact between them was made firmer and deeper
by the number of people who passed them and suspected nothing
of the kind. The question of Ralph’s cottage and future was not
mentioned again.</p>
