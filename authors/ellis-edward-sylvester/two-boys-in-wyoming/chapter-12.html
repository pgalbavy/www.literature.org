<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Jack Dudley, being some paces in advance of Fred Greenwood, and
alarmed for him because of his greater peril, had slightly slackened
his speed, for he was not the one to seek safety at the expense
of his comrade. The instant he saw him fall he stopped short,
and, wheeling about, fired at the grizzly, and pumping a second
cartridge into the chamber of his Winchester, let fly again, both
shots striking the beast, who was so close that a miss was impossible.</p>

<p>It need not be said that Fred, having pitched forward on his
hands and knees, did not remain thus. No hunter, even if a youth,
gives up so long as there is a fighting chance for life. He instantly
leaped to his feet, and a couple of bounds placed him beyond reach,
for the moment, of his terrible enemy.</p>

<p>The bear seemed to understand who had wounded him last, and,
although closer to Fred than to his companion, he swerved to the
left and headed for Jack Dudley. The latter did not stay on the
order of his going, but made off at his highest speed. Brief as
was the halt, it wrought a complete change of situation. Whereas
Fred had been in the greatest danger, Jack was now thus placed,
because the grizzly was closer to him. Not only that, but, ignoring
the younger lad, he gave his whole attention to Jack.</p>

<p>Events were going with such a rush that the boys were almost
overwhelmed before they could help themselves. Fred supposed the
bear was at his heels until, having run a couple of rods, he glanced
over his shoulder and saw the imminent peril of Jack. Then, with
a thrill of alarm, he in his turn checked his flight, and bringing
his Winchester to a level drove a bullet into the immense head
of the brute, which by that time had received a respectable amount
of lead in his carcass.</p>

<p>But "old Ephraim" seemed to have determined to dispose of the
fugitives in the reverse order of their ages; that is to say,
having changed his attentions to Jack Dudley, he did not mean
to be diverted therefrom, even though the younger lad was showing
disagreeable interest in him.</p>

<p>This peculiar turn of affairs gave Fred his favorable chance;
and, standing motionless, he continued his miniature bombardment
as fast as he could shove the cartridges into the chamber of his
weapon, aim, and fire. Surely the bullets, all of which found
a lodgment somewhere in the anatomy of the monster, must have
produced an effect, but they could not divert him from his main
purpose. He bore down upon the apparently doomed Jack Dudley as
if he would not be denied.</p>

<p>This fact caused Fred to be thrown partly to the rear, so that
the remarkable combat took the form of the grizzly pursuing one
of the boys, while the other boy was pursuing the grizzly. The
position of Fred, however, thus became unfavorable, for he was
unable to aim at any vulnerable portion of the creature. He continued
firing into his body, but the bullets produced no perceptible
effect in this fight for life.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the situation of Jack Dudley became perilous to the
last degree. To stop and fire insured his certain seizure by the
grizzly, who would require but a moment to tear the life from
him. Jack saw him so near, indeed, that he did that which no person
would do except in the last extremity. He flung away his rifle,
that it might not impede his flight, and concentrated all his
energies into the one effort of running.</p>

<p>He had no time to look where he was going. He could only strive
with the desperation of despair to preserve the distance between
him and his pursuer, in the faint hope that something would intervene
to save him. Fred was not only firing his gun as fast as he could,
but he shouted to the bear, in the hope of diverting his attention
from Jack, who could not keep up the unequal flight much longer.</p>

<p>The terrified fugitive leaped over boulders, dashed around interposing
rocks, and bounded across open spaces, hardly daring to look over
his shoulder, for he knew from the sounds of pursuit that the
animal was at his heels. It seemed every moment as if the prodigious
paw of the grizzly would smite him to the earth, when no human
power could save him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the fugitive, while dashing forward in this blind, headlong
fashion, found himself confronted by the canyon with which he
and Fred had already had a memorable experience. It yawned at
right angles to the course he was following, its width so great
that it was impossible for him to leap it at that point. But he
knew there must be some such place, and he continued his flight
along the side of the chasm, hunting for a spot that would permit
him to reach the other bank.</p>

<p>He did not stop to think how this could benefit him, for it was
to be supposed that if the grizzly could outrun he could also
outleap him, and the moment the fugitive landed on the further
bank the brute would do the same, without losing an inch of the
advantage already gained. In fact, Jack Dudley had no time to
think of anything except to run with all the vigor which nature
had given him.</p>

<p>All at once he saw a spot where the feat looked possible. There
was no time for him to turn off to gain the momentum, but, measuring
the interval with his eye, he gathered his muscles and leaped
outward. The jump was diagonal, and made under most difficult
circumstances.</p>

<p>Who shall describe the awful thrill that shot through Jack Dudley
when, at the moment of leaving the rocky edge of the rocky wall,
he was sure he was about to fail in his last effort? The other
margin of the canyon wall appeared to recede, and he uttered a
despairing cry, certain that the next instant he would go spinning
down the frightful abyss.</p>

<p>It is at such critical times that the question of life and death
is often decided by incidents so trifling that they are unnoticed.
Had Jack Dudley retained his Winchester in his grasp he would
have been lost. It would not have been alone the weight of the
weapon, but its interference with the free use of his hands. As
it was, the latter were untrammeled, and, though his feet missed
a firm hold, he instinctively clutched the craggy projections,
and, with a supreme effort, drew himself over the margin and beyond
all danger of falling back into the canyon.</p>

<p>And where, all this time, was old Ephraim?</p>

<p>The remark just made concerning the effect of trifles was shown
as strikingly in his case as in that of the fugitive. Despite
his enormous weight and awkwardness of action, the grizzly without
special exertion could have made the leap that had just been exhibited
before his eyes had he been in his usual condition, but it has
been shown that he had been struck by several bullets. Though
most of these inflicted little more than flesh wounds, which under
the circumstances were trifling, yet others did effective work.
This was especially the case with those that found a lodgment
in his head, which, big and tough as it was, lacked the power
of turning aside a rifle-ball, as the indurated back of an alligator
often does.</p>

<p>It is to be supposed that the enraged grizzly did not comprehend
the possible weakening of his colossal power through the effect
of these pellets, and it is quite likely that even with such weakening
he would have accomplished the leap of the canyon, but for the
interference of an incident which cannot be considered in any
other light than providential.</p>

<p>Fred Greenwood's anguish was for his companion, whom it seemed
impossible to help, despite the desperate effort he was making
to do so. He saw the grizzly lumbering after Jack, giving no heed
to the shots he sent after him, but steadily gaining upon the
fugitive, whose fate hung in the passing of the seconds. Fred
knew what it meant when his friend abruptly changed his course
and began skirting the canyon in his frantic hunt for a narrower
place. The bear was so close upon him for several paces that the
terrified Fred stopped short, ceased shooting, and held his breath,
expecting the great beast to strike down his comrade. The younger
lad could do no more, and, staring at the two, he asked in agony
that heaven would not desert his friend.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jack Dudley rose like a bird in air. At the instant
the monster was upon him he made the leap, landing on the further
edge, as has been told, and quickly scrambling upon solid foundation.
Had he been ten seconds later nothing could have saved him, for
the grizzly showed no more hesitation than he in making the jump.</p>

<p>At the instant Fred read the brute's intention he brought his
rifle to his shoulder. Unsuspected by himself, the last cartridge
in the magazine of his Winchester was in the chamber of the weapon,
so that, if it failed to help, the service of the younger lad
was at an end for the time, for it would be all over before he
could bring into use any cartridges from his belt.</p>

<p>To make the leap to which we have referred the grizzly changed
his position. Until that moment he had been running straight away
from Fred, but now, of necessity, he turned partly toward him.
Recalling the words of Hank Hazletine, Fred aimed at a point just
back of the foreleg, as it reached forward. The ball sped true
to its aim, and entering, perhaps, the most vulnerable point of
the body, did more than all the other bullets that had found a
lodging-place in the grizzly, for it inflicted a mortal wound.</p>

<p>It was this fact that destroyed the effort of the bear at the
crisis of its inception. The attempt already put forth carried
him well beyond the side of the canyon, but it failed to land
him firmly on the other margin. His forepaws went over the top,
precisely as the hands of Jack Dudley had done, and began a furious
scratching of the flinty surface, while the hind feet clawed with
equal fierceness the inner side of the wall. The brute was striving
to save himself, and it is to be presumed would have done so but
for the cause named.</p>

<p>That last shot told the story. The shot had seriously weakened
the bear, and his mighty strength was fast oozing away. His struggles
grew less vigorous, though they continued up to the last moment.
Jack Dudley had become aware of what was going on, and, stopping
in his flight, shouted:</p>

<p>"Shoot him, Fred, before he can climb out!"</p>

<p>Fred attempted to do so, but discovered he had no more cartridges
at command. Since the bear at best could not harm the younger,
he ran forward to the side of the canyon, just behind the beast.
Jack had paused, so that both were looking at the grizzly, whose
huge head and massive shoulders protruded above the edge of the
canyon. While they looked the head dropped from sight, followed
by the forefeet, whose claws scratched over the flinty surface
as they slipped backward.</p>

<p>Knowing what had occurred, Jack and Fred ran to the edge and
looked down. They were in time to see the mountainous bulk tumbling
into the vast chasm. The body maintained a horizontal posture,
as in life, until it struck a projecting point which sent it bounding
against the other side, where the impact added to the tendency
of the first blow, and the body turned over and over, like an
immense log rolling down hill. Despite the gloom of the abyss
the sun was shining so brightly, and was in such a favorable position,
that everything was seen with distinctness.</p>

<p>Peering downward, the awed and grateful boys saw the black mass
suddenly strike the foamy waters and send the spray flying in
all directions. It disappeared for a moment and then popped up
like a rubber-ball, and went dancing down the current toward the
break in the walls which they had visited a brief while before.</p>

<p>Still silent and watching, they observed it dancing up and down
with the violence of the stream until its motion was arrested
by striking an obstruction, which held it motionless. There it
stayed for the remaining minutes spent in peering into the abyss.</p>

<p>Jack and Fred looked up and across the canyon at the same instant.
They were directly opposite, and hardly twelve feet apart. The
elder took off his hat and called:</p>

<p>"Are you ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Fred, removing his head-gear.</p>

<p>"All together!"</p>

<p>And then they swung their hats and hurrahed with the vim which,
all things considered, was justified by events. They were happy
and grateful, and neither forgot to thank, with all the fervency
of his nature, the One who had delivered them in safety from the
very jaws of death. No matter what other dangers might come to
them, there could be none narrower or more striking than that
through which they had just passed.</p>

<p>"Do you intend to stay on that side of the canyon?" asked Fred.</p>

<p>"I don't know that there is any choice between our places, but
if you feel lonely I'll come over to your help."</p>

<p>"I thought you might want to pick up the gun you threw away."</p>

<p>Jack looked at each of his hands in turn and laughed.</p>

<p>"Do you know I had forgotten all about that? I don't remember
having thrown it aside."</p>

<p>"I saw you do it, and it was a lucky thing you did."</p>

<p>The two walked beside the canyon until they came to a straight
place, where Jack easily made the leap and joined his friend.
Then they set out to recover the Winchester, which, as matters
stood, was almost beyond value to them.</p>

<p>"I can't recall the spot where I dropped it," remarked Jack,
allowing his companion to take the lead.</p>

<p>"I do; you and I were doing such tall running then, and for some
minutes afterward, that we covered more ground than would be supposed.
That's the spot, just ahead."</p>

<p>He indicated an open space, thirty or forty feet in width, lying
between a ridge of boulders, over which it was astonishing how
the fugitive had managed to make such good progress.</p>

<p>"We shall find it right there&#11834;"</p>

<p>Fred checked his words, for at that moment they came upon the
spot he had in mind and both swept their gaze over it. Their dismay
may be imagined when they saw nothing of the Winchester.</p>

<p>"You must be mistaken as to the place," said Jack.</p>

<p>"I can't be; it was just after you had leaped down from that
low boulder that you gave your right arm a swing and away the
gun went."</p>

<p>"Did you notice where it landed?"</p>

<p>"I can put my hand on the very spot."</p>

<p>"Do so."</p>

<p>Fred led the way a few paces and said:</p>

<p>"It was there, and nowhere else."</p>

<p>Jack bent over and carefully studied the earth.</p>

<p>"My gracious! you are right; that dent in the ground was made
by the stock of my gun, and it couldn't have gone its own length
further."</p>

<p>The space was clear for several yards, and they would have discerned
a small coin lying anywhere on it, but nothing suggesting a weapon
was in sight.</p>

<p>A momentary consternation took possession of them. Only one conclusion
was possible: some person had taken the Winchester.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose it was Hank, who wanted to have some fun with
us?" asked Fred.</p>

<p>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p>"At any other time I might believe it, but Hank isn't one to
look for fun when the lives of two persons are in danger. It wasn't
he."</p>

<p>"Who, then, could it be?"</p>

<p>Again Jack shook his head.</p>

<p>"You know there are a number of Indians hunting in this neighborhood.
Some of them may have been near us, and, hearing our cries and
the reports of our guns, started to find out what it meant. Coming
upon my Winchester, they carried it off."</p>

<p>This was the most reasonable explanation they could think of,
but it did not lessen their disappointment at the loss of the
indispensable weapon.</p>

<p>"I won't stand it!" exclaimed Jack, whose indignation was rising;
"the man who took that gun must give it back!"</p>

<p>It was impossible to know in what direction to look for the pilferer,
but the youth's long strides led him toward the break in the walls
of the canyon where they had seen the three Indians earlier in
the forenoon. Whether it was reasonable to expect to find them,
or rather the thief, there, would be hard to say, but Jack did
find the one for whom he was looking.</p>

<p>Half the intervening distance was passed, when he turned his
head and said in an excited undertone to his companion:</p>

<p>"He's just ahead, and as sure as I live the thief is Motoza!"</p>

<p>Before Fred, slightly at the rear, could gain sight of the Indian,
Jack broke into a lope and called:</p>

<p>"Hold on there, Motoza! You have something that belongs to me."</p>

<p>The dusky vagrant was alone and walking at a moderate pace from
the youth. Although he did not look around until hailed he must
have known he was followed, but he stopped short and wheeled about
with a wondering expression on his painted face.</p>

<p>There could be no mistake by Jack Dudley, for Motoza was carrying
two Winchesters, one in either hand, and a glance enabled the
youth to recognize his own property.</p>

<p>"Howdy, brother?" asked Motoza, with the old grin on his face.</p>

<p>Jack was too angry to be tactful. He continued his rapid strides,
and as he drew near reached out his hand.</p>

<p>"Never mind how I do; give me my rifle."</p>

<p>But with the fingers of Jack almost on the weapon, Motoza shifted
his hand backward, so that the gun was held behind his body. He
did not stir, but continued grinning.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Jack, his face flushed, and his
anger greater than before; "didn't you hear me ask for my gun?"</p>

<p>"Whooh! brother frow way gun&mdash;me pick him up&mdash;he mine."</p>

<p>"I threw it down so as to have a better chance of getting away
from the grizzly bear; I intended to pick it up again. I know
you are a great thief, Motoza, but you can't steal that Winchester
from me; hand it over!"</p>

<p>And Jack extended his hand again; but the Sioux persisted in
keeping the weapon behind him, though his own was in front, where
the lad might have been tempted to snatch it from his grasp.</p>

<p>The youth was fast losing his self-command. He had learned the
character of this vagrant from Hazletine, and it was plain that
he meant to retain the valuable weapon, while Jack was equally
determined he should not.</p>

<p>"I tell you for the last time to give me my gun! <em>Do you hear?</em>"</p>

<p>The demand was made in a loud voice and accompanied by a threatening
step toward the Indian, who showed no fear. The grin, however,
had left his face, and he recoiled a step with such a tigerish
expression on his ugly countenance that his assailant ought to
have been warned of his danger. Motoza, the Sioux, was ready to
commit murder for the sake of retaining that which did not belong
to him.</p>

<p>"Stop!" commanded Fred Greenwood, whom both seemed to have forgotten
in the flurry of the moment.</p>

<p>The younger was standing a little to the rear and to one side,
but his Winchester, it will be remembered, was in his hand, and
was now pointed at the dusky scamp.</p>

<p>"Motoza, if you want to preserve that sweet countenance of yours,
hand that gun to my friend before I let daylight through you!"</p>
