<p>If you wish an illustration of how great events often flow from
trifling causes read what follows. It is one of the many events
which prove that "tall oaks from little acorns grow."</p>

<p>You have not forgotten Jim, the gawky, overgrown boy who had
a verbal contract with Mrs. Friestone which bound him to go to
the store each weekday morning and set out on the front porch
the score or more samples of the goods that were on sale within.
The same agreement required him to come around at dusk each evening
and carry them inside, his weekly wage for such duty being twenty-five
cents. When, therefore, Mike Murphy handed him a silver quarter
and assumed the job for that single night, Jim received a whole
week's pay for turning it over to the Irish lad. It is not so
strange that the youngster was confused at first over his bit
of luck, which he did not fully understand until he reached home
and had eaten his supper.</p>

<p>Now by one of those curious coincidences which occur oftener
in this life than most people think, that day was the anniversary
of Jim's birth. Being a good boy, as such things go, his father
presented him with a fine pocketknife, than which nothing could
have pleased his son better. It was really an excellent article,
having four blades, one of which was a file, two of small size,
and one quite large, the three being almost as keen-edged as a
razor. Straightway the happy lad selected his right hand trousers
pocket as the home of the knife when not in use. The miscellaneous
articles, such as a jewsharp, a piece of twine, a key, three coppers,
a piece of resin, several marbles, two ten-penny nails, a stub
of a lead pencil and a few other things were shifted to the left
side repository, where also he deposited the shining silver coin,
after showing it to his parents and telling them how he fell heir
to it.</p>

<p>The chat of the family shut out reference to the knife for most
of the evening. Both parents were inclined to be gossipy, and
they indulged in many guesses as to the identity of the donor
and what caused him to be so liberal. The mother's first thought
was that the red-haired, freckle-faced youth was a newcomer to
Beartown, and had secured Jim's job, but that fear was removed
by Jim's declaration that the stranger distinctly said he intended
to do the work only for that evening.</p>

<p>It was not very late when Jim went to his bedroom on the second
floor to retire for the night. When ready to disrobe, he took
out the wealth of treasures in his left pocket, including the
bright quarter, and shoved his hand into the other for the prize
that outweighed them all. Then he emitted a gasp of dismay: the
pocket was empty!</p>

<p>For a few moments he could not believe the truth. He frantically
searched his clothing over and over again, but in vain. The explanation
was as clear as noonday. In the bottom of his right-hand pocket
was a gaping rent, through which he pushed two fingers and disgustedly
spread them apart like a fan. He turned the cloth wrong side out
and the dreadful yawn seemed to grin at him.</p>

<p>Weak and faint he sat down on the edge of his trundle bed.</p>

<p>"What made that blamed hole? It wasn't there a little while ago.
It must have wored the hole while I was walking. I wouldn't lose
that knife for ten million dollars. It <em>can't</em> be lost!"</p>

<p>And then he repeated the search, as almost anyone will do in
similar circumstances. He even looked under the jewsharp and among
the marbles on the stand, where a mosquito could not have hidden
itself.</p>

<p>"Oh, what's the use!" he exclaimed, dropping down again despairingly
on the bed. "It's lost! Where did I lose it?"</p>

<p>Pulling himself together, he recalled the experiences of the
day, from the time he received the present directly after breakfast.
He had tested the implement many times in the course of the forenoon
and afternoon, and by and by remembered snapping the big blade
shut and slipping it into his pocket as he was going out of the
house to the post office to perform his daily task. He reasoned
well.</p>

<p>"I lost it somewhere atween here and the store. I can't see how
it slipped down my trousers leg without me feeling it, but that's
what it done. It's a-laying on the ground atween here and there,
onless," he added, with a catch of his breath, "that ugly looking
willain seen me drop it inside the store. I wonder if he give
me that quarter so as to hurry me out that he might git my knife!"</p>

<p>He shivered at the probability, but rather singularly the dread
was dissipated by a few minutes more of thought.</p>

<p>"If he'd seen it, so would Nora and she'd told me. It's somewhere
along the street."</p>

<p>Such being his conclusion, the all-important question was what
should he do to retrieve his crushing loss. His first inclination
was to tell his parents and then hurry back over the route to
look for the treasure. But it was night. There was no such thing
as a lantern in the house, he could not carry an ordinary light
in the breeze, and the search would be hopeless.</p>

<p>"I'll get up as soon as it is light," he said, "and hunt till
I find it."</p>

<p>Trying to gain hope from this decision, he knelt at the side
of his bed to say his prayers, which he never omitted. His petition
was longer than usual and I need not tell you what its chief if
not its whole burden was.</p>

<p>Despite the depressing weight upon his spirits, Jim fell asleep
and remained so for several hours, though his slumber was tortured
by dreams of his knife. Sometimes it was tiny as a pin and then
bigger than himself, but it always slipped from his grasp when
he reached out to seize it.</p>

<p>Suddenly he awoke. It took a minute or two to recall his situation,
but soon the startling truth came back to him. He had lost his
knife, and, remembering his resolve before going to sleep, he
bounded out of bed, certain that day not only had dawned but that
it had been light for some time. He soon discovered, however,
that what he took for the glow of the rising sun came from the
moon, whose vivid illumination made the mistake natural.</p>

<p>"I never seen it so bright," he said, stepping to the window
and peering out.</p>

<p>And then as if by inspiration he whispered:</p>

<p>"It's the right time to hunt for my knife."</p>

<p>He did not know what time it was nor did he care to know. There
was so much moongleam in his room that he easily dressed without
any artificial light. Then, too, the night was mild and his covering
scanty. Shirt and trousers were his only garments. He left his
straw hat where he had "hung" it on the floor in one corner beside
his shoes and stockings. The chief cause for now going barefoot
was that his steps would be lighter, though as a rule he saved
his shoes for Sunday and his trips to and from the store.</p>

<p>He knew his father was a light sleeper, and if awakened would
probably forbid him to go out before morning. So Jim opened his
bedroom door so softly that not the slightest noise was caused.
He went down the stairs as if he were a real burglar in rubber
shoes. He stopped several times with a faster beating heart, for
although he had never known the steps to squeak before they now
did so with such loudness that he was sure his father heard him.
But the snoring continued unbroken and Jim reached the door, where
he stealthily slid back the bolt and reversed the key, without
causing any betraying sound.</p>

<p>This side of the house was in shadow, and he stood for a minute
or two on the small, covered porch looking out upon the highway
or main street. Not a soul was in sight, nor did he see a twinkle
of light from any of the windows. It cannot be said that Jim felt
any fear, nor did he reflect upon the risk caused by leaving the
door unlocked behind him. He was thinking only of that loved knife.</p>

<p>He had walked to and from the store so many times that he knew
every step taken earlier in the evening. It was impossible to
go wrong, and he was quite confident of finding the knife unless
the brilliant moonlight had disclosed it to some late passerby.</p>

<p>Jim always crossed the street at a certain point, the post office
being on the other side, so he trod in his own footsteps, which
would have worn a path long before but for those of others, including
horses and wagons. He walked slowly, scanning every inch of the
ground and clay pavement in front of him, but when he drew near
the well-remembered building he had not caught sight of the prize.
He was within a few paces of the steps of the porch of the store,
when he was suddenly startled by a gruff voice:</p>

<p>"Hello, there! Where you going?"</p>

<p>He turned his head as a man stepped from under the small elm
behind him. Both being on the same level the slouch hat only partially
hid the grim face and big mustache. Jim would have been more scared
had he not caught sight an instant before of his knife lying at
the foot of the steps of the porch. He sprang forward, caught
it up and then faced the stranger, who had stepped into the street.</p>

<p>"I'm looking fur my knife that I dropped and I've found it too!"
he replied gleefully, holding up the cool, shiny implement. "Gee!
aint I lucky?"</p>

<p>"Well, you get out of here as quick as you can. Go back home
and stay there till morning. Do ye hear me?"</p>

<p>"Yaws; I'm going."</p>

<p>A strange discovery had come to Jim the instant before. As he
stooped to seize his property, his eyes were at the same height
as the bottom of the door leading into the store. It was only
for a second or two, but in that brief space he saw a faint glimmer
through the crevice, which he knew was caused by a light within.
With a shrewdness that no one would have expected from him he
said nothing of his discovery to the man who had accosted him.</p>

<p>"Mind what I told you!" added the stranger, "and don't show your
nose outside your house before morning. Understand?"</p>

<p>"Yaws; I don't want to, 'cause I've got my knife. Hooray!"</p>

<p>"Shut up! Off with you!"</p>

<p>"Yaws;" and Jim broke into a trot which he kept up until he reached
his own porch. In his exuberance of spirits, he was careless and
awoke his father. He came into the hall and roared out a demand
for an explanation, which his son gave in a few hurried words.</p>

<p>"Hooh!" exclaimed his parent; "there's robbers in the post office
and I think I'll take a hand as soon as I can get hold of my shotgun."</p>

<p>Which may serve to explain how it was that Gerald Buxton became
involved in the incidents that speedily followed.</p>
