<p>I must tell you how it was that Deerfoot the Shawanoe came to
bring the important letter of George Linden to his son Frederick.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that it was the custom of a party
of hunters and trappers to leave the settlement of Greville in
the autumn of each year and spend most of the cold weather among
the streams at the foot of a certain part of the Ozark Mountains.
At that period, the fur bearing animals abounded in the section,
as they were found in hundreds of other portions of the vast area
known under the general name of the Louisiana Territory. You must
bear in mind that there were thousands of square miles that had
not been trodden by a white man, and so sparse were the Indian
villages that large portions of the country remained to be visited
even by them.</p>

<p>Beaver, otter, foxes, bears, and buffaloes were the chief animals
that were afterward driven west by the advancing tide of civilization,
until the agents of the Missouri and Western Fur Companies were
forced to do most of their work in the far west and north-west,
where they came in collision with that vast monopoly known as
the Hudson Bay Company, which, until recent years, not only trapped
and hunted throughout Oregon, but along the Pacific coast as far
south as California.</p>

<p>George Linden, Rufus Hardin and James Bowlby composed the party
who, in the autumn of the year of which I am writing, rode each
a horse a hundred miles to the south of the frontier settlement
of Greville, and pitched their tent at the foot of the Ozark range.
Beside the animals ridden, each hunter took a pack-horse to help
bring back the peltries that were to be gathered during the cold
weather. As a matter of course, they were provided with guns and
plenty of munitions, and indeed with every necessity for their
limited wants. They had spent several winters there and knew what
was before them. They had hunted and trapped for years in other
parts of the great west, and more than once had made the long
journey to the post of St. Louis to dispose of their furs, a necessity
that, as I have explained, was removed by the annual visit of
the agents with their long train of pack-horses to gather up the
peltries.</p>

<p>And so, without giving any of the interesting particulars of
the ride southward from Greville, let us take a look at the little
party gathered at their primitive camp in the wild Ozark region.</p>

<p>The six horses had been relieved of their burdens on reaching
the place, and were turned loose to crop the grass that was plentiful
in many places. Although there was snow now and then through the
winter, there was hardly enough to cause any suffering on the
part of the animals. When the storms, however, were violent or
prolonged, the hardy beasts were provided with some of the stores
of dried grass that was kept in stock, as may be said. In case
that gave out they could make shift with the cottonwood and other
trees, whose bark was not lacking in succulent qualities.</p>

<p>Although a tolerable shelter could have been found in any one
of the numerous caves within reach, the hunters preferred to erect
a rough cabin, that was almost strong enough to withstand a cyclone.
The keen axes enabled them to trim off the interfering limbs,
and they were joined at the corners so well that very little,
if any, rain or snow could force its way through. Other logs and
branches were laid across the top and ends fastened to the logs
beneath by means of withes, so that the roof was not likely to
be carried away unless the cabin itself went with it.</p>

<p>On the top of the roof was a thick layer of branches and leaves,
packed so closely that little moisture could find its way through.
There were no windows, for none was needed. The single door in
front was large enough to allow free egress and ingress. At night,
when there was a possibility that some curious wild animal might
come snuffing around, the door was closed by means of a framework
of thick limbs, also fastened together with withes, swinging on
leathern hinges, and made secure by a brace leaning against it
from the inside.</p>

<p>Within this structure were stored their supplies, and the blankets
on which they slept were spread upon the bare ground. Their slumber
was sweeter, too, than it would have been had they stretched themselves
on "downy beds of ease," for health and weariness are two soporifics
which art can never supplant.</p>

<p>The traps and appurtenances used in their toil were never taken
away from the place, for there was no call to do so. Such repairs
as were needed from time to time were made in the cabin or on
the spot, as the necessity arose. The rifles, of course, furnished
the food needed, while an abundance of fish could be taken at
any time from the streams in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>A diet solely of flesh and fish is not acceptable to any one.
Therefore, among the supplies annually brought to the cabin, were
a quantity of coarse flour, meal, sugar, coffee, salt and tea.
It may be said, that in one respect they were like modern campers
out, except that they took the wrong season of the year for what
so many boys consider the acme of enjoyment.</p>

<p>There was little in the appearance of the three men to call for
special description. All were in middle life, strong, rugged,
and inured to hardship. Linden was rather tall, his face covered
by a heavy beard in which not a gray hair had yet appeared. Hardin
was fully as tall, with shoulders somewhat bent, and his scant,
dark beard was plentifully sprinkled with gray. Bowlby was short
and stocky in appearance. When in the woods he allowed his black
beard to grow all over his face, but at home he was always smooth-shaven.
He was of a swarthy complexion, inclined to be silent, and often
moody, but like his companions he was brave, industrious and patient,
holding a strong dislike of all Indians, though not inclined to
go to any unjustifiable length in his feelings.</p>

<p>The dress of the three men was similar to that of Fred and Terry,
which has already been described. No one of them knew any thing
about the modern overcoat or cloak. If there should come a spell
of unusually severe weather, they had only to wrap a blanket or
buffalo robe about the shoulders when compelled to visit the traps
or remain long outdoors. Should it become necessary to kindle
a fire within the cabin for the sake of warmth, a broad, flat
stone was removed from an opening in the roof directly over the
blaze, and the smoke, if so inclined, found its way to the clear
air outside. The cooking was done under the adjoining trees. Of
course it was of the most primitive character, but it suited,
and that is all that is necessary.</p>

<p>The hunters reached their cabin about the middle of the forenoon
of an autumn day. They had eaten their regular morning meal, and
they got to work without delay. The horses were unloaded and turned
adrift, the stores safely housed, the blankets spread on the floor
of simple earth in the cabin, and then the men scattered to look
after their traps. This was a large job, for the implements had
to be examined and many of them slightly repaired, after which
they must be carried long distances and set.</p>

<p>These traps were of the ordinary pattern, such as have been in
general use for hundreds of years. The iron jaws was forced wide
apart and kept in place by a catch, which was sprung by a slight
pressure on the broad, flat portion in the middle. The trap being
carefully hidden from sight, the unsuspecting animal had hardly
time to rest one paw on this plate, when the fierce jaws, impelled
by steel springs of prodigious strength, came together with the
suddenness of lightning, and the animal, whatever he be, was in
a grip from which there was no escape.</p>

<p>You can understand the care required to set these traps so that
they would do their work. The beaver is highly intelligent, and
quick to detect the signs of man's presence. Nothing can tempt
him to venture where he sees that his worst enemy has been before
him. The fox is the synonym of cunning, and will often outwit
the shrewdest trapper. He will walk around the trap and stealthily
secure the bait without harm to himself. One of those animals
has been known to reach forward and spring the implement, jerking
back his paw quickly enough to escape the sharp teeth. A fox,
too, when caught in a steel trap will sometimes gnaw off the leg
just above where it is imprisoned, and afterward go through life
with little inconvenience on three legs. You may be sure that
he is never caught again in that fashion.</p>

<p>It was easy to see where the sagacious beavers were in the habit
of leaving the water and climbing the bank. The trap was carefully
placed below the surface out of sight, and often it had no bait
at all, for it would seem that the bait itself was liable to awaken
the suspicion of the beavers. Occasionally, however, when it was
desirable to attract them to the spot, an oily odoriferous substance
obtained from the animal itself was smeared over the ground near
the bank.</p>

<p>The otters were scarcer than the beavers, but were hunted much
in the same manner. For foxes and fur-bearing animals that roamed
the the woods, the steel trap was baited with such food as they
were fond of (which was about every thing), and they were so numerous
through that part of the territory that the hunters had little
difficulty in securing what was wanted.</p>

<p>At the end of the second day all the traps were in position,
and the three friends were grouped on the outside of the cabin
smoking their pipes and talking over the outlook for the winter,
which all agreed was favorable.</p>

<p>The bison or buffaloes, of which mention has been made, were
found in the open spaces or prairies where there was plenty of
grass. No such multitudinous herds were seen as have been gathered
in later years on the western prairies, but there were enough
to make very lively hunting for the trio, who had shot and skinned
several while on their way to the beaver runs.</p>

<p>Within a half hour's walk of the camp was a beaver dam fully
half a mile wide, built with astonishing skill and strength. The
backwater flooded the country for many square miles, and gave
the remarkable animals just the place they wanted for their curious
huts, of which I shall have something to tell you further on.</p>
