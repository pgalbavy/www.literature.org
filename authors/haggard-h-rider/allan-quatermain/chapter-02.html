<p>In due course we left Lamu, and ten days afterwards we found ourselves
at a spot called Charra, on the Tana River, having gone through many
adventures which need not be recorded here. Amongst other things we
visited a ruined city, of which there are many on this coast, and
which must once, to judge from their extent and the numerous remains of
mosques and stone houses, have been very populous places. These ruined
cities are immeasurably ancient, having, I believe, been places of
wealth and importance as far back as the Old Testament times, when they
were centres of trade with India and elsewhere. But their glory has
departed now--the slave trade has finished them--and where wealthy
merchants from all parts of the then civilized world stood and bargained
in the crowded market-places, the lion holds his court at night, and
instead of the chattering of slaves and the eager voices of the
bidders, his awful note goes echoing down the ruined corridors. At this
particular place we discovered on a mound, covered up with rank growth
and rubbish, two of the most beautiful stone doorways that it is
possible to conceive. The carving on them was simply exquisite, and I
only regret that we had no means of getting them away. No doubt they had
once been the entrances to a palace, of which, however, no traces were
now to be seen, though probably its ruins lay under the rising mound.
</p>
<p>Gone! quite gone! the way that everything must go. Like the nobles and
the ladies who lived within their gates, these cities have had their
day, and now they are as Babylon and Nineveh, and as London and Paris
will one day be. Nothing may endure. That is the inexorable law. Men
and women, empires and cities, thrones, principalities, and powers,
mountains, rivers, and unfathomed seas, worlds, spaces, and universes,
all have their day, and all must go. In this ruined and forgotten place
the moralist may behold a symbol of the universal destiny. For this
system of ours allows no room for standing still--nothing can loiter on
the road and check the progress of things upwards towards Life, or the
rush of things downwards towards Death. The stern policeman Fate moves
us and them on, on, uphill and downhill and across the level; there is
no resting-place for the weary feet, till at last the abyss swallows us,
and from the shores of the Transitory we are hurled into the sea of the
Eternal.
</p><p>At Charra we had a violent quarrel with the headman of the bearers we
had hired to go as far as this, and who now wished to extort large extra
payment from us. In the result he threatened to set the Masai--about
whom more anon--on to us. That night he, with all our hired bearers,
ran away, stealing most of the goods which had been entrusted to them
to carry. Luckily, however, they had not happened to steal our rifles,
ammunition, and personal effects; not because of any delicacy of feeling
on their part, but owing to the fact that they chanced to be in the
charge of the five Wakwafis. After that, it was clear to us that we had
had enough of caravans and of bearers. Indeed, we had not much left for
a caravan to carry. And yet, how were we to get on?
</p><p>It was Good who solved the question. ‘Here is water,’ he said, pointing
to the Tana River; ‘and yesterday I saw a party of natives hunting
hippopotami in canoes. I understand that Mr Mackenzie’s mission station
is on the Tana River. Why not get into canoes and paddle up to it?’
</p><p>This brilliant suggestion was, needless to say, received with
acclamation; and I instantly set to work to buy suitable canoes from
the surrounding natives. I succeeded after a delay of three days in
obtaining two large ones, each hollowed out of a single log of some
light wood, and capable of holding six people and baggage. For these two
canoes we had to pay nearly all our remaining cloth, and also many other
articles.
</p><p>On the day following our purchase of the two canoes we effected a
start. In the first canoe were Good, Sir Henry, and three of our
Wakwafi followers; in the second myself, Umslopogaas, and the other two
Wakwafis. As our course lay upstream, we had to keep four paddles at
work in each canoe, which meant that the whole lot of us, except Good,
had to row away like galley-slaves; and very exhausting work it was. I
say, except Good, for, of course, the moment that Good got into a boat
his foot was on his native heath, and he took command of the party. And
certainly he worked us. On shore Good is a gentle, mild-mannered man,
and given to jocosity; but, as we found to our cost, Good in a boat was
a perfect demon. To begin with, he knew all about it, and we didn’t. On
all nautical subjects, from the torpedo fittings of a man-of-war down
to the best way of handling the paddle of an African canoe, he was a
perfect mine of information, which, to say the least of it, we were not.
Also his ideas of discipline were of the sternest, and, in short, he
came the royal naval officer over us pretty considerably, and paid us
out amply for all the chaff we were wont to treat him to on land;
but, on the other hand, I am bound to say that he managed the boats
admirably.
</p><p>After the first day Good succeeded, with the help of some cloth and a
couple of poles, in rigging up a sail in each canoe, which lightened our
labours not a little. But the current ran very strong against us, and at
the best we were not able to make more than twenty miles a day. Our
plan was to start at dawn, and paddle along till about half-past ten,
by which time the sun got too hot to allow of further exertion. Then we
moored our canoes to the bank, and ate our frugal meal; after which
we ate or otherwise amused ourselves till about three o’clock, when we
again started, and rowed till within an hour of sundown, when we called
a halt for the night. On landing in the evening, Good would at once set
to work, with the help of the Askari, to build a little ‘scherm’, or
small enclosure, fenced with thorn bushes, and to light a fire. I, with
Sir Henry and Umslopogaas, would go out to shoot something for the pot.
Generally this was an easy task, for all sorts of game abounded on the
banks of the Tana. One night Sir Henry shot a young cow-giraffe, of
which the marrow-bones were excellent; on another I got a couple of
waterbuck right and left; and once, to his own intense satisfaction,
Umslopogaas (who, like most Zulus, was a vile shot with a rifle) managed
to kill a fine fat eland with a Martini I had lent him. Sometimes
we varied our food by shooting some guinea-fowl, or bush-bustard
(paau)--both of which were numerous--with a shot-gun, or by catching
a supply of beautiful yellow fish, with which the waters of the Tana
swarmed, and which form, I believe, one of the chief food-supplies of
the crocodiles.
</p><p>Three days after our start an ominous incident occurred. We were just
drawing in to the bank to make our camp as usual for the night, when
we caught sight of a figure standing on a little knoll not forty
yards away, and intensely watching our approach. One glance was
sufficient--although I was personally unacquainted with the tribe--to
tell me that he was a Masai Elmoran, or young warrior. Indeed, had I
had any doubts, they would have quickly been dispelled by the terrified
ejaculation of ‘<u>Masai</u>!’ that burst simultaneously from the lips of our
Wakwafi followers, who are, as I think I have said, themselves bastard
Masai.
</p><p>And what a figure he presented as he stood there in his savage war-gear!
Accustomed as I have been to savages all my life, I do not think that I
have ever before seen anything quite so ferocious or awe-inspiring. To
begin with, the man was enormously tall, quite as tall as Umslopogaas, I
should say, and beautifully, though somewhat slightly, shaped; but with
the face of a devil. In his right hand he held a spear about five and a
half feet long, the blade being two and a half feet in length, by nearly
three inches in width, and having an iron spike at the end of the
handle that measured more than a foot. On his left arm was a large
and well-made elliptical shield of buffalo hide, on which were painted
strange heraldic-looking devices. On his shoulders was a huge cape of
hawk’s feathers, and round his neck was a ‘naibere’, or strip of cotton,
about seventeen feet long, by one and a half broad, with a stripe of
colour running down the middle of it. The tanned goatskin robe, which
formed his ordinary attire in times of peace, was tied lightly round his
waist, so as to serve the purposes of a belt, and through it were stuck,
on the right and left sides respectively, his short pear-shaped sime, or
sword, which is made of a single piece of steel, and carried in a wooden
sheath, and an enormous knobkerrie. But perhaps the most remarkable
feature of his attire consisted of a headdress of ostrich-feathers,
which was fixed on the chin, and passed in front of the ears to the
forehead, and, being shaped like an ellipse, completely framed the face,
so that the diabolical countenance appeared to project from a sort of
feather fire-screen. Round the ankles he wore black fringes of hair,
and, projecting from the upper portion of the calves, to which they were
attached, were long spurs like spikes, from which flowed down tufts of
the beautiful black and waving hair of the Colobus monkey. Such was the
elaborate array of the Masai Elmoran who stood watching the approach of
our two canoes, but it is one which, to be appreciated, must be seen;
only those who see it do not often live to describe it. Of course I
could not make out all these details of his full dress on the occasion
of this my first introduction, being, indeed, amply taken up with the
consideration of the general effect, but I had plenty of subsequent
opportunities of becoming acquainted with the items that went to make it
up.
</p><p>Whilst we were hesitating what to do, the Masai warrior drew himself
up in a dignified fashion, shook his huge spear at us, and, turning,
vanished on the further side of the slope.
</p><p>‘Hulloa!’ holloaed Sir Henry from the other boat; ‘our friend the
caravan leader has been as good as his word, and set the Masai after us.
Do you think it will be safe to go ashore?’
</p><p>I did not think it would be at all safe; but, on the other hand, we had
no means of cooking in the canoes, and nothing that we could eat raw,
so it was difficult to know what to do. At last Umslopogaas simplified
matters by volunteering to go and reconnoitre, which he did, creeping
off into the bush like a snake, while we hung off in the stream waiting
for him. In half an hour he returned, and told us that there was not a
Masai to be seen anywhere about, but that he had discovered a spot where
they had recently been encamped, and that from various indications he
judged that they must have moved on an hour or so before; the man we saw
having, no doubt, been left to report upon our movements.
</p><p>Thereupon we landed; and, having posted a sentry, proceeded to cook and
eat our evening meal. This done, we took the situation into our serious
consideration. Of course, it was possible that the apparition of the
Masai warrior had nothing to do with us, that he was merely one of a
band bent upon some marauding and murdering expedition against another
tribe. But when we recalled the threat of the caravan leader, and
reflected on the ominous way in which the warrior had shaken his spear
at us, this did not appear very probable. On the contrary, what did
seem probable was that the party was after us and awaiting a favourable
opportunity to attack us. This being so, there were two things that
we could do--one of which was to go on, and the other to go back. The
latter idea was, however, rejected at once, it being obvious that we
should encounter as many dangers in retreat as in advance; and, besides,
we had made up our minds to journey onwards at any price. Under these
circumstances, however, we did not consider it safe to sleep ashore, so
we got into our canoes, and, paddling out into the middle of the stream,
which was not very wide here, managed to anchor them by means of big
stones fastened to ropes made of coconut-fibre, of which there were
several fathoms in each canoe.
</p><p>Here the mosquitoes nearly ate us up alive, and this, combined with
anxiety as to our position, effectually prevented me from sleeping as
the others were doing, notwithstanding the attacks of the aforesaid Tana
mosquitoes. And so I lay awake, smoking and reflecting on many things,
but, being of a practical turn of mind, chiefly on how we were to give
those Masai villains the slip. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and,
notwithstanding the mosquitoes, and the great risk we were running from
fever from sleeping in such a spot, and forgetting that I had the cramp
very badly in my right leg from squatting in a constrained position
in the canoe, and that the Wakwafi who was sleeping beside me smelt
horribly, I really began to enjoy myself. The moonbeams played upon the
surface of the running water that speeded unceasingly past us towards
the sea, like men’s lives towards the grave, till it glittered like
a wide sheet of silver, that is in the open where the trees threw no
shadows. Near the banks, however, it was very dark, and the night wind
sighed sadly in the reeds. To our left, on the further side of the
river, was a little sandy bay which was clear of trees, and here I could
make out the forms of numerous antelopes advancing to the water,
till suddenly there came an ominous roar, whereupon they all made off
hurriedly. Then after a pause I caught sight of the massive form of His
Majesty the Lion, coming down to drink his fill after meat. Presently he
moved on, then came a crashing of the reeds about fifty yards above us,
and a few minutes later a huge black mass rose out of the water, about
twenty yards from me, and snorted. It was the head of a hippopotamus.
Down it went without a sound, only to rise again within five yards
of where I sat. This was decidedly too near to be comfortable, more
especially as the hippopotamus was evidently animated by intense
curiosity to know what on earth our canoes were. He opened his great
mouth, to yawn, I suppose, and gave me an excellent view of his ivories;
and I could not help reflecting how easily he could crunch up our frail
canoe with a single bite. Indeed, I had half a mind to give him a ball
from my eight-bore, but on reflection determined to let him alone unless
he actually charged the boat. Presently he sank again as noiselessly as
before, and I saw no more of him. Just then, on looking towards the bank
on our right, I fancied that I caught sight of a dark figure flitting
between the tree trunks. I have very keen sight, and I was almost sure
that I saw something, but whether it was bird, beast, or man I could not
say. At the moment, however, a dark cloud passed over the moon, and I
saw no more of it. Just then, too, although all the other sounds of
the forest had ceased, a species of horned owl with which I was well
acquainted began to hoot with great persistency. After that, save for
the rustling of trees and reeds when the wind caught them, there was
complete silence.
</p><p>But somehow, in the most unaccountable way, I had suddenly become
nervous. There was no particular reason why I should be, beyond the
ordinary reasons which surround the Central African traveller, and yet I
undoubtedly was. If there is one thing more than another of which I
have the most complete and entire scorn and disbelief, it is of
presentiments, and yet here I was all of a sudden filled with and
possessed by a most undoubted presentiment of approaching evil. I would
not give way to it, however, although I felt the cold perspiration stand
out upon my forehead. I would not arouse the others. Worse and worse I
grew, my pulse fluttered like a dying man’s, my nerves thrilled with
the horrible sense of impotent terror which anybody who is subject to
nightmare will be familiar with, but still my will triumphed over my
fears, and I lay quiet (for I was half sitting, half lying, in the
bow of the canoe), only turning my face so as to command a view of
Umslopogaas and the two Wakwafi who were sleeping alongside of and
beyond me.
</p><p>In the distance I heard a hippopotamus splash faintly, then the owl
hooted again in a kind of unnatural screaming note {Endnote 4}, and
the wind began to moan plaintively through the trees, making a
heart-chilling music. Above was the black bosom of the cloud, and
beneath me swept the black flood of the water, and I felt as though I
and Death were utterly alone between them. It was very desolate.
</p><p>Suddenly my blood seemed to freeze in my veins, and my heart to stand
still. Was it fancy, or were we moving? I turned my eyes to look for
the other canoe which should be alongside of us. I could not see it, but
instead I saw a lean and clutching black hand lifting itself above
the gunwale of the little boat. Surely it was a nightmare! At the same
instant a dim but devilish-looking face appeared to rise out of the
water, and then came a lurch of the canoe, the quick flash of a knife,
and an awful yell from the Wakwafi who was sleeping by my side (the
same poor fellow whose odour had been annoying me), and something warm
spurted into my face. In an instant the spell was broken; I knew that it
was no nightmare, but that we were attacked by swimming Masai. Snatching
at the first weapon that came to hand, which happened to be Umslopogaas’
battleaxe, I struck with all my force in the direction in which I
had seen the flash of the knife. The blow fell upon a man’s arm, and,
catching it against the thick wooden gunwale of the canoe, completely
severed it from the body just above the wrist. As for its owner, he
uttered no sound or cry. Like a ghost he came, and like a ghost he went,
leaving behind him a bloody hand still gripping a great knife, or rather
a short sword, that was buried in the heart of our poor servant.
</p><p>Instantly there arose a hubbub and confusion, and I fancied, rightly
or wrongly, that I made out several dark heads gliding away towards the
right-hand bank, whither we were rapidly drifting, for the rope by which
we were moored had been severed with a knife. As soon as I had realized
this fact, I also realized that the scheme had been to cut the boat
loose so that it should drift on to the right bank (as it would have
done with the natural swing of the current), where no doubt a party of
Masai were waiting to dig their shovel-headed spears into us. Seizing
one paddle myself, I told Umslopogaas to take another (for the remaining
Askari was too frightened and bewildered to be of any use), and together
we rowed vigorously out towards the middle of the stream; and not an
instant too soon, for in another minute we should have been aground, and
then there would have been an end of us.
</p><p>As soon as we were well out, we set to work to paddle the canoe upstream
again to where the other was moored; and very hard and dangerous work
it was in the dark, and with nothing but the notes of Good’s stentorian
shouts, which he kept firing off at intervals like a fog-horn, to guide
us. But at last we fetched up, and were thankful to find that they
had not been molested at all. No doubt the owner of the same hand that
severed our rope should have severed theirs also, but was led away from
his purpose by an irresistible inclination to murder when he got the
chance, which, while it cost us a man and him his hand, undoubtedly
saved all the rest of us from massacre. Had it not been for that ghastly
apparition over the side of the boat--an apparition that I shall never
forget till my dying hour--the canoe would undoubtedly have drifted
ashore before I realized what had happened, and this history would never
have been written by me.
