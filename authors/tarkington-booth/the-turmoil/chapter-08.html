<p>Edith, glancing casually into the "ready-made" library, stopped
abruptly, seeing Bibbs there alone. He was standing before the
pearl-framed and golden-lettered poem, musingly inspecting it.
He read it:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>FUGITIVE</em>

</p>
<p>
I will forget the things that sting:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The lashing look, the barbed word.<br/>
I know the very hands that fling<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The stones at me had never stirred<br/>
To anger but for their own scars.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They've suffered so, that's why they strike.<br/>
I'll keep my heart among the stars<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where none shall hunt it out.  Oh, like<br/>
These wounded ones I must not be,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For, wounded, I might strike in turn!<br/>
So, none shall hurt me.  Far and free<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where my heart flies no one shall learn.

<p>"Bibbs!" Edith's voice was angry, and her color deepened suddenly
as she came into the room, preceded by a scent of violets much
more powerful than that warranted by the actual bunch of them
upon the lapel of her coat.</p>

<p>Bibbs did not turn his head, but wagged it solemnly, seeming
depressed by the poem. "Pretty young, isn't it?" he said. "There
must have been something about your looks that got the prize,
Edith; I can't believe the poem did it."</p>

<p>She glanced hurriedly over her shoulder and spoke sharply, but
in a low voice: "I don't think it's very nice of you to bring
it up at all, Bibbs. I'd like a chance to forget the whole silly
business. I didn't want them to frame it, and I wish to goodness
papa'd quit talking about it; but here, that night, after the
dinner, didn't he go and read it aloud to the whole crowd of 'em!
And then they all wanted to know what other poems I'd written
and why I didn't keep it up and write some more, and if I didn't,
why didn't I, and why this and why that, till I thought I'd die
of shame!"</p>

<p>"You could tell 'em you had writer's cramp," Bibbs suggested.</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell 'em anything! I just choke with mortification
every time anybody speaks of the thing."</p>

<p>Bibbs looked grieved. "The poem isn't <em>THAT </em>bad, Edith.
You see, you were only seventeen when you wrote it."</p>

<p>"Oh, hush up!" she snapped. "I wish it had burnt my fingers the
first time I touched it. Then I might have had sense enough to
leave it where it was. I had no business to take it, and I've
been ashamed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, comfortingly. "It was the very most flattering
thing ever happen to me. It was almost my last flight before I
went to the machine-shop, and it's pleasant to think somebody
liked it enough to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I <em>DON'T </em>like it!" she exclaimed. "I don't even
understand it&mdash;and papa made so much fuss over its getting the
prize, I just hate it! The truth is I never dreamed it'd get the
prize."</p>

<p>"Maybe they expected father to endow the school," Bibbs murmured.</p>

<p>"Well, I had to have something to turn in, and I couldn't write
a <em>LINE! I </em>hate poetry, anyhow; and Bobby Lamhorn's always
teasing me about how I 'keep my heart among the stars.' He makes
it seem such a mushy kind of thing, the way he says it. I hate
it!"</p>

<p>"You'll have to live it down, Edith. Perhaps abroad and under
another name you might find&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush up! I'll hire some one to steal it and burn it the
first chance I get." She turned away petulantly, moving to the
door. "I'd like to think I could hope to hear the last of it before
I die!"</p>

<p>"Edith!" he called, as she went into the hall.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"I want to ask you: Do I really look better, or have you just
got used to me?"</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean?" she said, coming back as far as
the threshold.</p>

<p>"When I first came you couldn't look at me," Bibbs explained,
in his impersonal way. "But I've noticed you look at me lately.
I wondered if I'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's because you look so much better," she told him, cheerfully.
"This month you've been here's done you no end of good. It's the
change."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what they said at the sanitarium&mdash;the change."</p>

<p>"You look worse than 'most anybody I ever saw," said Edith, with
supreme candor. "But I don't know much about it. I've never seen
a corpse in my life, and I've never even seen anybody that was
terribly sick, so you mustn't judge by me. I only know you do
look better, I'm glad to say. But you're right about my not being
able to look at you at first. You had a kind of whiteness that
&mdash;Well, you're almost as thin, I suppose, but you've got
more just ordinarily pale; not that ghastly look. Anybody could
look at you now, Bibbs, and no&mdash;not get&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sick?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;almost that!" she laughed. "And you're getting a better
color every day, Bibbs; you really are. You're getting along splendidly."</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I'm afraid so," he said, ruefully.</p>

<p>"'Afraid so'! Well, if you aren't the queerest! I suppose you
mean father might send you back to the machine-shop if you get
well enough. I heard him say something about it the night of the&mdash;"
The jingle of a distant bell interrupted her, and she glanced
at her watch. "Bobby Lamhorn! I'm going to motor him out to look
at a place in the country. Afternoon, Bibbs!"</p>

<p>When she had gone, Bibbs mooned pessimistically from shelf to
shelf, his eye wandering among the titles of the books. The library
consisted almost entirely of handsome "uniform editions": Irving,
Poe, Cooper, Goldsmith, Scott, Byron, Burns, Longfellow, Tennyson,
Hume, Gibbon, Prescott, Thackeray, Dickens, De Musset, Balzac,
Gautier, Flaubert, Goethe, Schiller, Dante, and Tasso. There were
shelves and shelves of encyclopedias, of anthologies, of "famous
classics," of "Oriental masterpieces," of "masterpieces of oratory,"
and more shelves of "selected libraries" of "literature," of "the
drama," and of "modern science." They made an effective decoration
for the room, all these big, expensive books, with a glossy binding
here and there twinkling a reflection of the flames that crackled
in the splendid Gothic fireplace; but Bibbs had an impression
that the bookseller who selected them considered them a relief,
and that white-jacket considered them a burden of dust, and that
nobody else considered them at all. Himself, he disturbed not
one.</p>

<p>There came a chime of bells from a clock in another part of the
house, and white-jacket appeared beamingly in the doorway, bearing
furs. "Awready, Mist' Bibbs," he announced. "You' ma say wrap
up wawm f' you' ride, an' she cain' go with you to-day, an' not
f'git go see you' pa at fo' 'clock. Aw ready, suh."</p>

<p>He equipped Bibbs for the daily drive Dr. Gurney had commanded;
and in the manner of a master of ceremonies unctuously led the
way. In the hall they passed the Moor, and Bibbs paused before
it while white-jacket opened the door with a flourish and waved
condescendingly to the chauffeur in the car which stood waiting
in the driveway.</p>

<p>"It seems to me I asked you what you thought about this 'statue'
when I first came home, George," said Bibbs, thoughtfully. "What
did you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Yessuh!" George chuckled, perfectly understanding that for some
unknown reason Bibbs enjoyed hearing him repeat his opinion of
the Moor. "You ast me when you firs' come home, an' you ast me
nex' day, an' mighty near ev'y day all time you been here; an'
las' Sunday you ast me twicet." He shook his head solemnly. "Look
to me mus' be somep'm might lami<em>DAL '</em>bout 'at statue!"</p>

<p>"Mighty what?"</p>

<p>"Mighty lami<em>DAL!" </em>George, burst out laughing. "What
DO 'at word mean, Mist' Bibbs?"</p>

<p>"It's new to me, George. Where did you hear it?"</p>

<p>"I nev' <em>DID </em>hear it!" said George. "I uz dess sittin'
thinkum to myse'f an' she pop in my head&mdash;'lami<em>DAL,' </em>dess
like 'at! An' she soun' so good, seem like she <em>GOTTA </em>mean
somep'm!"</p>

<p>"Come to think of it, I believe she does mean something. Why,
yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do she?" cried George. "<em>WHAT </em>she mean?"</p>

<p>"It's exactly the word for the statue," said Bibbs, with conviction,
as he climbed into the car. "It's a lami<em>DAL </em>statue."</p>

<p>"Hiyi!" George exulted. "Man! Man! Listen! Well, suh, she mighty
lami<em>DAL </em>statue, but lami<em>DAL </em>statue heap o' trouble
to dus'!" "I expect she is!"  said Bibbs, as the engine began
to churn; and a moment later he was swept from sight.</p>

<p>George turned to Mist' Jackson, who had been listening benevolently
in the hallway. "Same he aw-ways say, Mist' Jackson&mdash;'I expec'
she is!' Ev'y day he try t' git me talk 'bout 'at lami<em>DAL
</em>statue, an' aw-ways, las' thing HE say, 'I expec' she is!'
You know, Mist' Jackson, if he git well, 'at young man go' be
pride o' the family, Mist' Jackson. Yes-suh, right now I pick
'im fo' firs' money!"</p>

<p>"Look out with all 'at money, George!" Jackson warned the enthusiast.
"White folks 'n 'is house know 'im heap longer'n you. You the
on'y man bettin' on 'im!"</p>

<p>"I risk it!" cried George, merrily. "I put her all on now&mdash;ev'y
cent! 'At boy's go' be flower o' the flock!"</p>

<p>This singular prophecy, founded somewhat recklessly upon gratitude
for the meaning of "lami<em>DAL," </em>differed radically from
another prediction concerning Bibbs, set forth for the benefit
of a fair auditor some twenty minutes later.</p>

<p>Jim Sheridan, skirting the edges of the town with Mary Vertrees
beside him, in his own swift machine, encountered the invalid
upon the highroad. The two cars were going in opposite directions,
and the occupants of Jim's had only a swaying glimpse of Bibbs
sitting alone on the back seat&mdash;his white face startlingly white
against cap and collar of black fur&mdash;but he flashed into recognition
as Mary bowed to him.</p>

<p>Jim waved his left hand carelessly. "It's Bibbs, taking his constitutional,"
he explained.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Mary. "I bowed to him, too, though I've never
met him. In fact, I've only seen him once&mdash;no, twice. I hope he
won't think I'm very bold, bowing to him."</p>

<p>"I doubt if he noticed it," said honest Jim.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she cried.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"I'm almost sure people notice it when I bow to them."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see!" said Jim. "Of course they would ordinarily, but
Bibbs is funny."</p>

<p>"Is he? How?" she asked. "He strikes me as anything but funny."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm his brother," Jim said, deprecatingly, "but I don't
know what he's like, and, to tell the truth, I've never felt exactly
like I <em>WAS </em>his brother, the way I do Roscoe. Bibbs never
did seem more than half alive to me. Of course Roscoe and I are
older, and when we were boys we were too big to play with him,
but he never played anyway, with boys his own age. He'd rather
just sit in the house and mope around by himself. Nobody could
ever get him to DO anything; you can't get him to do anything
now. He never had any <em>LIFE </em>in him; and honestly, if he
is my brother, I must say I believe Bibbs Sheridan is the laziest
man God ever made! Father put him in the machine-shop over at
the Pump Works&mdash;best thing in the world for him&mdash;and he was just
plain no account. It made him sick! If he'd had the right kind
of energy&mdash;the kind father's got, for instance, or Roscoe, either&mdash;why,
it wouldn't have made him sick. And suppose it was either of them&mdash;yes,
or me, either&mdash;do you think any of us would have stopped if we
<em>WERE </em>sick? Not much! I hate to say it, but Bibbs Sheridan'll
never amount to anything as long as he lives."</p>

<p>Mary looked thoughtful. "Is there any particular reason why he
should?"  she asked.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" he exclaimed. "You don't mean that, do you?
Don't you believe in a man's knowing how to earn his salt, no
matter how much money his father's got? Hasn't the business of
this world got to be carried on by everybody in it? Are we going
to lay back on what we've got and see other fellows get ahead
of us? If we've got big things already, isn't it every man's business
to go ahead and make 'em bigger? Isn't it his duty? Don't we always
want to get bigger and bigger?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es &mdash;I don't know. But I feel rather sorry for your
brother. He looked so lonely&mdash;and sick."</p>

<p>"He's gettin' better every day," Jim said. "Dr. Gurney says so.
There's nothing much the matter with him, really&mdash;it's nine-tenths
imaginary. 'Nerves'! People that are willing to be busy don't
have nervous diseases, because they don't have time to imagine
'em."</p>

<p>"You mean his trouble is really mental?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's not a lunatic," said Jim. "He's just queer. Sometimes
he'll say something right bright, but half the time what he says
is 'way off the subject, or else there isn't any sense to it at
all. For instance, the other day I heard him talkin' to one of
the darkies in the hall. The darky asked him what time he wanted
the car for his drive, and anybody else in the world would have
just said what time they <em>DID </em>want it, and that would
have been all there was to it; but here's what Bibbs says, and
I heard him with my own ears. 'What time do I want the car?' he
says. 'Well, now, that depends&mdash;that depends,' he says. He talks
slow like that, you know. 'I'll tell you what time I want the
car, George,' he says, 'if you'll tell ME what you think of this
statue!' That's exactly his words! Asked the darky what he thought
of that Arab Edith and mother bought for the hall!"</p>

<p>Mary pondered upon this. "He might have been in fun, perhaps,"
she suggested.</p>

<p>"Askin' a darky what he thought of a piece of statuary&mdash;of a
work of art! Where on earth would be the fun of that? No, you're
just kind-hearted&mdash;and that's the way you <em>OUGHT </em>to be,
of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Sheridan!" she laughed.</p>

<p>"See here!" he cried. "Isn't there any way for us to get over
this Mister and Miss thing? A month's got thirty-one days in it;
I've managed to be with you a part of pretty near all the thirty-one,
and I think you know how I feel by this time&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked panic-stricken immediately. "Oh, no," she protested,
quickly. "No, I don't, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you do," he said, and his voice shook a little. "You couldn't
help knowing."</p>

<p>"But I do!" she denied, hurriedly. "I do help knowing. I mean
&mdash;Oh, wait!"</p>

<p>"What for? You do know how I feel, and you&mdash;well, you've certainly
<em>WANTED </em>me to feel that way&mdash;or else pretended&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, now!" she lamented. "You're spoiling such a cheerful afternoon!"</p>

<p>"'Spoilin' it!'" He slowed down the car and turned his face to
her squarely. "See here, Miss Vertrees, haven't you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop the car a minute." And when he had complied she faced
him as squarely as he evidently desired her to face him. "Listen.
I don't want you to go on, to-day."</p>

<p>"Why not?" he asked, sharply.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"You mean it's just a whim?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she repeated. Her voice was low and troubled
and honest, and she kept her clear eyes upon his.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me something?"</p>

<p>"Almost anything."</p>

<p>"Have you ever told any man you loved him?"</p>

<p>And at that, though she laughed, she looked a little contemptuous.
"No,"  she said. "And I don't think I ever shall tell any man
that&mdash;or ever know what it means. I'm in earnest, Mr. Sheridan."</p>

<p>"Then you&mdash;you've just been flirting with me!" Poor Jim looked
both furious and crestfallen.</p>

<p>"Not one bit!" she cried. "Not one word! Not one syllable! I've
meant every single thing!"</p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course you don't!" she said. "Now, Mr. Sheridan, I want you
to start the car. Now! Thank you. Slowly, till I finish what I
have to say. I have not flirted with you. I have deliberately
courted you. One thing more, and then I want you to take me straight
home, talking about the weather all the way. I said that I do
not believe I shall ever 'care' for any man, and that is true.
I doubt the existence of the kind of 'caring' we hear about in
poems and plays and novels. I think it must be just a kind of
emotional <em>TALK&mdash;</em>most of it. At all events, I don't feel
it. Now, we can go faster, please."</p>

<p>"Just where does that let me out?" he demanded. "How does that
excuse you for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It isn't an excuse," she said, gently, and gave him one final
look, wholly desolate. "I haven't said I should never marry."</p>

<p>"What?" Jim gasped.</p>

<p>She inclined her head in a broken sort of acquiescence, very
humble, unfathomably sorrowful.</p>

<p>"I promise nothing," she said, faintly.</p>

<p>"You needn't!" shouted Jim, radiant and exultant. "You needn't!
By George! I know you're square; that's enough for me! You wait
and promise whenever you're ready!"</p>

<p>"Don't forget what I asked," she begged him.</p>

<p>"Talk about the weather? I will! God bless the old weather!"
cried the happy Jim.</p>
