The chief attendant of the three dynamos that buzzed and rattled at
Camberwell, and kept the electric railway going, came out of
Yorkshire, and his name was James Holroyd.  He was a practical
electrician, but fond of whisky, a heavy red-haired brute with
irregular teeth.  He doubted the existence of the deity, but
accepted Carnot's cycle, and he had read Shakespeare and found him
weak in chemistry.  His helper came out of the mysterious East, and
his name was Azuma-zi.  But Holroyd called him Pooh-bah.  Holroyd
liked a nigger because he would stand kicking--a habit with
Holroyd--and did not pry into the machinery and try to learn the
ways of it.  Certain odd possibilities of the negro mind brought
into abrupt contact with the crown of our civilisation Holroyd
never fully realised, though just at the end he got some inkling of
them.
<P>
To define Azuma-zi was beyond ethnology.  He was, perhaps,
more negroid than anything else, though his hair was curly rather
than frizzy, and his nose had a bridge.  Moreover, his skin was
brown rather than black, and the whites of his eyes were yellow. 
His broad cheekbones and narrow chin gave his face something of the
viperine V. His head, too, was broad behind, and low and narrow at
the forehead, as if his brain had been twisted round in the reverse
way to a European's.  He was short of stature and still shorter of
English.  In conversation he made numerous odd noises of no known
marketable value, and his infrequent words were carved and wrought
into heraldic grotesqueness.  Holroyd tried to elucidate his
religious beliefs, and--especially after whisky--lectured to him
against superstition and missionaries.  Azuma-zi, however, shirked
the discussion of his gods, even though he was kicked for it.
<P>
Azuma-zi had come, clad in white but insufficient raiment, out
of the stokehole of the Lord Clive, from the Straits
Settlements, and beyond, into London.  He had heard even in his
youth of the greatness and riches of London, where all the women
are white and fair, and even the beggars in the streets are white,
and he arrived, with newly earned gold coins in his pocket, to
worship at the shrine of civilisation.  The day of his landing was
a dismal one; the sky was dun, and a wind-worried drizzle filtered
down to the greasy streets, but he plunged boldly into the delights
of Shadwell, and was presently cast up, shattered in health,
civilised in costume, penniless and, except in matters of the
direst necessity, practically a dumb animal, to toil for James
Holroyd and to be bullied by him in the dynamo shed at Camberwell. 
And to James Holroyd bullying was a labour of love.
<P>
There were three dynamos with their engines at Camberwell. 
The two that had been there since the beginning were small
machines; the larger one was new.  The smaller machines made a
reasonable noise; their straps hummed over the drums, every now and
then the brushes buzzed and fizzled, and the air churned steadily,
whoo! whoo! whoo! between their poles.  One was loose in its
foundations and kept the shed vibrating.  But the big dynamo
drowned these little noises altogether with the sustained drone of
its iron core, which somehow set part of the ironwork humming.  The
place made the visitor's head reel with the throb, throb, throb of
the engines, the rotation of the big wheels, the spinning
ball-valves, the occasional spittings of the steam, and over all
the deep, unceasing, surging note of the big dynamo.  This last
noise was from an engineering point of view a defect, but Azuma-zi
accounted it unto the monster for mightiness and pride.
<P>
If it were possible we would have the noises of that shed
always about the reader as he reads, we would tell all our story to
such an accompaniment.  It was a steady stream of din, from which
the ear picked out first one thread and then another; there was the
intermittent snorting, panting, and seething of the steam engines,
the suck and thud of their pistons, the dull beat on the air as the
spokes of the great driving-wheels came round, a note the leather
straps made as they ran tighter and looser, and a fretful tumult
from the dynamos; and over all, sometimes inaudible, as the ear
tired of it, and then creeping back upon the senses again, was this
trombone note of the big machine.  The floor never felt steady and
quiet beneath one's feet, but quivered and jarred.  It was a
confusing, unsteady place, and enough to send anyone's thoughts
jerking into odd zigzags.  And for three months, while the big
strike of the engineers was in progress, Holroyd, who was a
blackleg, and Azuma-zi, who was a mere black, were never out of the
stir and eddy of it, but slept and fed in the little wooden shanty
between the shed and the gates.
<P>
Holroyd delivered a theological lecture on the text of his big
machine soon after Azuma-zi came.  He had to shout to be heard in
the din.  "Look at that," said Holroyd; "where's your 'eathen idol
to match 'im?"  And Azuma-zi looked.  For a moment Holroyd was
inaudible, and then Azuma-zi heard: "Kill a hundred men.  Twelve
per cent. on the ordinary shares," said Holroyd, "and that's
something like a Gord!"
<P>
Holroyd was proud of his big dynamo, and expatiated upon its
size and power to Azuma-zi until heaven knows what odd currents of
thought that and the incessant whirling and shindy set up within
the curly black cranium.  He would explain in the most graphic
manner the dozen or so ways in which a man might be killed by it,
and once he gave Azuma-zi a shock as a sample of its quality. 
After that, in the breathing-times of his labour--it was heavy
labour, being not only his own, but most of Holroyd's--Azuma-zi
would sit and watch the big machine.  Now and then the brushes
would sparkle and spit blue flashes, at which Holroyd would swear,
but all the rest was as smooth and rhythmic as breathing.  The band
ran shouting over the shaft, and ever behind one as one watched was
the complacent thud of the piston.  So it lived all day in this big
airy shed, with him and Holroyd to wait upon it; not prisoned up
and slaving to drive a ship as the other engines he knew--mere
captive devils of the British Solomon--had been, but a machine
enthroned.  Those two smaller dynamos, Azuma-zi by force of
contrast despised; the large one he privately christened the Lord
of the Dynamos.  They were fretful and irregular, but the big
dynamo was steady.  How great it was!  How serene and easy in its
working!  Greater and calmer even than the Buddhas he had seen at
Rangoon, and yet not motionless, but living!  The great black coils
spun, spun, spun, the rings ran round under the brushes, and the
deep note of its coil steadied the whole.  It affected Azuma-zi
queerly.
<P>
Azuma-zi was not fond of labour.  He would sit about and watch
the Lord of the Dynamos while Holroyd went away to persuade the
yard porter to get whisky, although his proper place was not in the
dynamo shed but behind the engines, and, moreover, if Holroyd
caught him skulking he got hit for it with a rod of stout copper
wire.  He would go and stand close to the colossus and look up at
the great leather band running overhead.  There was a black patch
on the band that came round, and it pleased him somehow among all
the clatter to watch this return again and again.  Odd thoughts
spun with the whirl of it.  Scientific people tell us that savages
give souls to rocks and trees--and a machine is a thousand times
more alive than a rock or a tree.  And Azuma-zi was practically a
savage still; the veneer of civilisation lay no deeper than his
slop suit, his bruises, and the coal grime on his face and hands. 
His father before him had worshipped a meteoric stone, kindred
blood it may be had splashed the broad wheels of Juggernaut.
<P>
He took every opportunity Holroyd gave him of touching and
hand, ling the great dynamo that was fascinating him.  He polished
and cleaned it until the metal parts were blinding in the sun.  He
felt a mysterious sense of service in doing this.  He would go up
to it and touch its spinning coils gently.  The gods he had
worshipped were all far away.  The people in London hid their gods.
<P>
At last his dim feelings grew more distinct, and took shape in
thoughts and at last in acts.  When he came into the roaring shed
one morning he salaamed to the Lord of the Dynamos, and then when
Holroyd was away, he went and whispered to the thundering machine
that he was its servant, and prayed it to have pity on him and save
him from Holroyd.  As he did so a rare gleam of light came in
through the open archway of the throbbing machine-shed, and the
Lord of the Dynamos, as he whirled and roared, was radiant with
pale gold.  Then Azuma-zi knew that his service was acceptable to
his Lord.  After that he did not feel so lonely as he had done, and
he had indeed been very much alone in London.  And even when his
work time was over, which was rare, he loitered about the shed.
<P>
Then, the next time Holroyd maltreated him, Azuma-zi went
presently to the Lord of the Dynamos and whispered, "Thou seest, O
my Lord!" and the angry whir of the machinery seemed to answer him. 
Thereafter it appeared to him that whenever Holroyd came into the
shed a different note came into the sounds of the dynamo.  "My Lord
bides his time," said Azuma-zi to himself.  "The iniquity of the
fool is not yet ripe."  And he waited and watched for the day of
reckoning.  One day there was evidence of short circuiting, and
Holroyd, making an unwary examination--it was in the afternoon--got
a rather severe shock.  Azuma-zi from behind the engine saw him
jump off and curse at the peccant coil.
<P>
"He is warned," said Azuma-zi to himself.  "Surely my Lord is
very patient."
<P>
Holroyd had at first initiated his "nigger" into such
elementary conceptions of the dynamo's working as would enable him
to take temporary charge of the shed in his absence.  But when he
noticed the manner in which Azuma-zi hung about the monster he
became suspicious.  He dimly perceived his assistant was "up to
something," and connecting him with the anointing of the coils with
oil that had rotted the varnish in one place, he issued an edict,
shouted above the confusion of the machinery, "Don't 'ee go nigh
that big dynamo any more, Pooh-bah, or a'll take thy skin off!"
Besides, if it pleased Azuma-zi to be near the big machine, it was
plain sense and decency to keep him away from it.
<P>
Azuma-zi obeyed at the time, but later he was caught bowing
before the Lord of the Dynamos.  At which Holroyd twisted his arm
and kicked him as he turned to go away.  As Azuma-zi presently
stood behind the engine and glared at the back of the hated
Holroyd, the noises of the machinery took a new rhythm, and sounded
like four words in his native tongue.
<P>
It is hard to say exactly what madness is.  I fancy Azuma-zi
was mad.  The incessant din and whirl of the dynamo shed may have
churned up his little store of knowledge and his big store of
superstitious fancy, at last, into something akin to frenzy.  At
any rate, when the idea of making Holroyd a sacrifice to the Dynamo
Fetich was thus suggested to him, it filled him with a strange
tumult of exultant emotion.
<P>
That night the two men and their black shadows were alone in
the shed together.  The shed was lit with one big arc light that
winked and flickered purple.  The shadows lay black behind the
dynamos, the ball governors of the engines whirled from light to
darkness, and their pistons beat loud and steady.  The world
outside seen through the open end of the shed seemed incredibly dim
and remote.  It seemed absolutely silent, too, since the riot of
the machinery drowned every external sound.  Far away was the black
fence of the yard with grey shadowy houses behind, and above was
the deep blue sky and the pale little stars.  Azuma-zi suddenly
walked across the centre of the shed above which the leather bands
were running, and went into the shadow by the big dynamo.  Holroyd
heard a click, and the spin of the armature changed.
<P>
"What are you dewin' with that switch?" he bawled in surprise. 
"Han't I told you--"
<P>
Then he saw the set expression of Azuma-zi's eyes as the
Asiatic came out of the shadow towards him.
<P>
In another moment the two men were grappling fiercely in front
of the great dynamo.
<P>
"You coffee-headed fool!" gasped Holroyd, with a brown hand at
his throat.  "Keep off those contact rings."  In another moment he
was tripped and reeling back upon the Lord of the Dynamos.  He
instinctively loosened his grip upon his antagonist to save himself
from the machine.
<P>
The messenger, sent in furious haste from the station to find
out what had happened in the dynamo shed, met Azuma-zi at the
porter's lodge by the gate.  Azuma-zi tried to explain something,
but the messenger could make nothing of the black's incoherent
English, and hurried on to the shed.  The machines were all noisily
at work, and nothing seemed to be disarranged.  There was, however,
a queer smell of singed hair.  Then he saw an odd-looking crumpled
mass clinging to the front of the big dynamo, and, approaching,
recognised the distorted remains of Holroyd.
<P>
The man stared and hesitated a moment.  Then he saw the face,
and shut his eyes convulsively.  He turned on his heel before he
opened them, so that he should not see Holroyd again, and went out
of the shed to get advice and help.
<P>
When Azuma-zi saw Holroyd die in the grip of the Great Dynamo
he had been a little scared about the consequences of his act.  Yet
he felt strangely elated, and knew that the favour of the Lord
Dynamo was upon him.  His plan was already settled when he met the
man coming from the station, and the scientific manager who
speedily arrived on the scene jumped at the obvious conclusion of
suicide.  This expert scarcely noticed Azuma-zi, except to ask a
few questions.  Did he see Holroyd kill himself?  Azuma-zi
explained that he had been out of sight at the engine furnace until
he heard a difference in the noise from the dynamo.  It was not a
difficult examination, being untinctured by suspicion.
<P>
The distorted remains of Holroyd, which the electrician
removed from the machine, were hastily covered by the porter with
a coffee-stained tablecloth.  Somebody, by a happy inspiration,
fetched a medical man.  The expert was chiefly anxious to get the
machine at work again, for seven or eight trains had stopped midway
in the stuffy tunnels of the electric railway.  Azuma-zi, answering
or misunderstanding the questions of the people who had by
authority or impudence come into the shed, was presently sent back
to the stoke-hole by the scientific manager.  Of course a crowd
collected outside the gates of the yard--a crowd, for no known
reason, always hovers for a day or two near the scene of a sudden
death in London; two or three reporters percolated somehow into the
engine-shed, and one even got to Azuma-zi; but the scientific
expert cleared them out again, being himself an amateur journalist.
<P>
Presently the body was carried away, and public interest
departed with it. Azuma-zi remained very quietly at his furnace,
seeing over and over again in the coals a figure that wriggled
violently and became still.  An hour after the murder, to anyone
coming into the shed it would have looked exactly as if nothing had
ever happened there.  Peeping presently from his engine-room the
black saw the Lord Dynamo spin and whirl beside his little
brothers, and the driving wheels were beating round, and the steam
in the pistons went thud, thud, exactly as it had been earlier in
the evening.  After all, from the mechanical point of view, it had
been a most insignificant incident--the mere temporary deflection
of a current.  But now the slender form and slender shadow of the
scientific manager replaced the sturdy outline of Holroyd
travelling up and down the lane of light upon the vibrating floor
under the straps between the engines and the dynamos.
<P>
"Have I not served my Lord?" said Azuma-zi inaudibly, from his
shadow, and the note of the great dynamo rang out full and clear. 
As he looked at the big whirling mechanism the strange fascination
of it that had been a little in abeyance since Holroyd's death,
resumed its sway.
<P>
Never had Azuma-zi seen a man killed so swiftly and
pitilessly.  The big humming machine had slain its victim without
wavering for a second from its steady beating.  It was indeed a
mighty god.
<P>
The unconscious scientific manager stood with his back to him,
scribbling on a piece of paper.  His shadow lay at the foot of the
monster.
<P>
"Was the Lord Dynamo still hungry?  His servant was ready."
<P>
Azuma-zi made a stealthy step forward; then stopped.  The
scientific manager suddenly stopped writing, and walked down the
shed to the endmost of the dynamos, and began to examine the
brushes.
<P>
Azuma-zi hesitated, and then slipped across noiselessly into
shadow by the switch.  There he waited.  Presently the manager's
footsteps could be heard returning.  He stopped in his old
position, unconscious of the stoker crouching ten feet away from
him.  Then the big dynamo suddenly fizzled, and in another moment
Azuma-zi had sprung out of the darkness upon him.
<P>
First, the scientific manager was gripped round the body and
swung towards the big dynamo, then, kicking with his knee and
forcing his antagonist's head down with his hands, he loosened the
grip on his waist and swung round away from the machine.  Then the
black grasped him again, putting a curly head against his chest,
and they swayed and panted as it seemed for an age or so.  Then the
scientific manager was impelled to catch a black ear in his teeth
and bite furiously.  The black yelled hideously.
<P>
They rolled over on the floor, and the black, who had
apparently slipped from the vice of the teeth or parted with some
ear--the scientific manager wondered which at the time--tried to
throttle him.  The scientific manager was making some ineffectual
attempts to claw something with his hands and to kick, when the
welcome sound of quick footsteps sounded on the floor.  The next
moment Azuma-zi had left him and darted towards the big dynamo. 
There was a splutter amid the roar.
<P>
The officer of the company who had entered, stood staring as
Azuma-zi caught the naked terminals in his hands, gave one horrible
convulsion, and then hung motionless from the machine, his face
violently distorted.
<P>
"I'm jolly glad you came in when you did," said the scientific
manager, still sitting on the floor.
<P>
He looked at the still quivering figure.
<P>
"It's not a nice death to die, apparently--but it is quick."
<P>
The official was still staring at the body.  He was a man of
slow apprehension.
<P>
There was a pause.
<P>
The scientific manager got up on his feet rather awkwardly. 
He ran his fingers along his collar thoughtfully, and moved his
head to and fro several times.
<P>
"Poor Holroyd!  I see now."  Then almost mechanically he went
towards the switch in the shadow and turned the current into the
railway circuit again.  As he did so the singed body loosened its
grip upon the machine and fell forward on its face.  The core of
the dynamo roared out loud and clear, and the armature beat the
air.
<P>
So ended prematurely the Worship of the Dynamo Deity, perhaps
the most short-lived of all religions.  Yet withal it could at
least boast a Martyrdom and a Human Sacrifice.
