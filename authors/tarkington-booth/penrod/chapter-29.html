<p>"Aunt Sarah's a funny old lady," Penrod observed, on the way
back to the town. "What's she want me to give papa this old sling
for? Last thing she said was to be sure not to forget to give
it to him. HE don't want it; and she said, herself, it ain't any
good. She's older than you or papa, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"About fifty years older," answered Mrs. Schofield, turning upon
him a stare of perplexity. "Don't cut into the leather with your
new knife, dear; the livery man might ask us to pay if-&mdash;No.
I wouldn't scrape the paint off, either&mdash;nor whittle your shoe
with it. <em>COULDN'T </em>you put it up until we get home?"</p>

<p>"We goin' straight home?"</p>

<p>"No. We're going to stop at Mrs. Gelbraith's and ask a strange
little girl to come to your party, this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Her name is Fanchon. She's Mrs. Gelbraith's little niece."</p>

<p>"What makes her so queer?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say she's queer."</p>

<p>"You said&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No; I mean that she is a stranger. She lives in New York and
has come to visit here."</p>

<p>"What's she live in New York for?"</p>

<p>"Because her parents live there. You must be very nice to her,
Penrod; she has been very carefully brought up. Besides, she doesn't
know the children here, and you must help to keep her from feeling
lonely at your party."</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>When they reached Mrs. Gelbraith's, Penrod sat patiently humped
upon a gilt chair during the lengthy exchange of greetings between
his mother. and Mrs. Gelbraith. That is one of the things a boy
must learn to bear: when his mother meets a compeer there is always
a long and dreary wait for him, while the two appear to be using
strange symbols of speech, talking for the greater part, it seems
to him, simultaneously, and employing a wholly incomprehensible
system of emphasis at other times not in vogue. Penrod twisted
his legs, his cap and his nose.</p>

<p>"Here she is!" Mrs. Gelbraith cried, unexpectedly, and a dark-haired,
demure person entered the room wearing a look of gracious social
expectancy. In years she was eleven, in manner about sixty-five,
and evidently had lived much at court. She performed a curtsey
in acknowledgment of Mrs. Schofield's greeting, and bestowed her
hand upon Penrod, who had entertained no hope of such an honour,
showed his surprise that it should come to him, and was plainly
unable to decide what to do about it.</p>

<p>"Fanchon, dear," said Mrs. Gelbraith, "take Penrod out in the
yard for a while, and play."</p>

<p>"Let go the little girl's hand, Penrod," Mrs. Schofield laughed,
as the children turned toward the door.</p>

<p>Penrod hastily dropped the small hand, and exclaiming, with simple
honesty, "Why, <em>I</em> don't want it!" followed Fanchon out
into the sunshiny yard, where they came to a halt and surveyed
each other.</p>

<p>Penrod stared awkwardly at Fanchon, no other occupation suggesting
itself to him, while Fanchon, with the utmost coolness, made a
very thorough visual examination of Penrod, favouring him with
an estimating scrutiny which lasted until he literally wiggled.
Finally, she spoke.</p>

<p>"Where do you buy your ties?" she asked.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Where do you buy your neckties? Papa gets his at Skoone's. You
ought to get yours there. I'm sure the one you're wearing isn't
from Skoone's."</p>

<p>"Skoone's?" Penrod repeated. "Skoone's?"</p>

<p>"On Fifth Avenue," said Fanchon. "It's a very smart shop, the
men say."</p>

<p>"Men?" echoed Penrod, in a hazy whisper. "Men?"</p>

<p>"Where do your people go in summer?" inquired the lady. "WE go
to Long Shore, but so many middle-class people have begun coming
there, mamma thinks of leaving. The middle classes are simply
awful, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"They're so boorjaw. You speak French, of course?"</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"We ran over to Paris last year. It's lovely, don't you think?
Don't you <em>LOVE </em>the Rue de la Paix?"</p>

<p>Penrod wandered in a labyrinth. This girl seemed to be talking,
but her words were dumfounding, and of course there was no way
for him to know that he was really listening to her mother. It
was his first meeting with one of those grown-up little girls,
wonderful product of the winter apartment and summer hotel; and
Fanchon, an only child, was a star of the brand. He began to feel
resentful.</p>

<p>"I suppose," she went on, "I'll find everything here fearfully
Western. Some nice people called yesterday, though. Do you know
the Magsworth Bittses? Auntie says they're charming. Will Roddy
be at your party?"</p>

<p>"I guess he will," returned Penrod, finding this intelligible.
"The mutt!"</p>

<p>"Really!" Fanchon exclaimed airily. "Aren't you great pals with
him?"</p>

<p>"What's 'pals'?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens! Don't you know what it means to say you're 'great
pals' with any one? You <em>ARE </em>an odd child!"</p>

<p>It was too much.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bugs!" said Penrod.</p>

<p>This bit of ruffianism had a curious effect. Fanchon looked upon
him with sudden favour.</p>

<p>"I like you, Penrod!" she said, in an odd way, and, whatever
else there may have been in her manner, there certainly was no
shyness.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bugs!" This repetition may have lacked gallantry, but it
was uttered in no very decided tone. Penrod was shaken.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do!" She stepped closer to him, smiling. "Your hair is
ever so pretty."</p>

<p>Sailors' parrots swear like mariners, they say; and gay mothers
ought to realize that all children are imitative, for, as the
precocious Fanchon leaned toward Penrod, the manner in which she
looked into his eyes might have made a thoughtful observer wonder
where she had learned her pretty ways.</p>

<p>Penrod was even more confused than he had been by her previous
mysteries: but his confusion was of a distinctly pleasant and
alluring nature: he wanted more of it. Looking intentionally into
another person's eyes is an act unknown to childhood; and Penrod's
discovery that it could be done was sensational. He had never
thought of looking into the eyes of Marjorie Jones.</p>

<p>Despite all anguish, contumely, tar, and Maurice Levy, he still
secretly thought of Marjorie, with pathetic constancy, as his
"beau"&mdash;though that is not how he would have spelled it. Marjorie
was beautiful; her curls were long and the colour of amber; her
nose was straight and her freckles were honest; she was much prettier
than this accomplished visitor. But beauty is not all.</p>

<p>"I do!" breathed Fanchon, softly.</p>

<p>She seemed to him a fairy creature from some rosier world than
this. So humble is the human heart, it glorifies and makes glamorous
almost any poor thing that says to it: "I like you!"</p>

<p>Penrod was enslaved. He swallowed, coughed, scratched the back
of his neck, and said, disjointedly:</p>

<p>"Well &mdash;I don't care if you want to. I just as soon."</p>

<p>"We'll dance together," said Fanchon, "at your party."</p>

<p>"I guess so. I just as soon."</p>

<p>"Don't you want to, Penrod?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm willing to."</p>

<p>"No. Say you <em>WANT </em>to!"</p>

<p>"Well&#11834;"</p>

<p>He used his toe as a gimlet, boring into the ground, his wide
open eyes staring with intense vacancy at a button on his sleeve.</p>

<p>His mother appeared upon the porch in departure, calling farewells
over her shoulder to Mrs. Gelbraith, who stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Say it!" whispered Fanchon.</p>

<p>"Well, I just as <em>SOON</em>."</p>

<p>She seemed satisfied.</p>
