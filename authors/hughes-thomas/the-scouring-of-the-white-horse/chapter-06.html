<p>Next morning I got up early, for I wasn’t quite easy in my mind
about riding Joe’s old horse, and so I thought I would just go
round and look at him, and ask the fogger something about his
ways. It was a splendid morning, not a cloud to be seen. I found
the fogger strapping away at the horses. Everybody had been up
and about since daylight, to get their day’s work done, so that
they might get away early to the pastime. All the cows had been
milked and turned out again, and Joe was away in the fields, looking
after his men.</p>

<p>I stood beating about the bush for some time, for I didn’t want
to let the man see what I was thinking of if I could help it.
However, when he brought out the old brown horse to clean him
down, I went up and patted him, and asked whether he was a good
saddle horse.</p>

<p>[Illustration]</p>

<p>"Ees, there warn’t much fault to find wi’ un," said the fogger,
stopping his hissing and rubbing for a moment, "leastways for
them as didn’t mind a high goer."</p>

<p>I didn’t quite know what he meant by a high goer, so I asked
him if the brown was up to my weight.</p>

<p>"Lor’ bless ’ee, ees. He’d make no account o’ vivteen stun. Be
you to ride un up the hill, Sir, make so bold?" said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, at least I think so," said I.</p>

<p>"Hev ’ee got arra loose tooth, Sir?" said he, grinning.</p>

<p>"No," said I, "why?"</p>

<p>"’Cause he’ll be as likely as not to shake un out for ’ee, Sir,
if you lets un hev his head up on the downs."</p>

<p>I didn’t like this account of the brown horse, for as I hadn’t
ridden much, he might take his head perhaps whether I let him
have it or not. So I made up my mind not to ride. I thought I
would go behind in the four-wheel, for I didn’t like to leave
Miss Lucy all alone with the Parson for so long; but then I found
out that one of the carter-boys was to go behind to look after
the horses, and I didn’t choose to be put up side by side with
him, to look ridiculous. There was a big wagon going up, too,
full of the farm servants, but that didn’t seem to suit me any
better, so I settled with myself that I would just start and walk
up.</p>

<p>Joe, luckily for me, thought he had settled every thing, and
so at breakfast said nothing more about the old horse; though
I was afraid he would every minute, and then I should have had
to pretend I was going to ride, or they might have found out that
I didn’t quite like the notion. I was very glad when I saw him
fairly off after breakfast, cantering away on the chestnut; and,
very soon afterwards, I took a good stout stick of Joe’s in my
hand, put my note-book in my pocket, and started off quietly by
myself.</p>

<p>At first as I walked along I didn’t enjoy myself much for thinking
of the four-wheel, and I was almost getting jealous of the Parson
again. But I soon got over it, when I remembered how kind he had
been the night before. And I felt, too, that if he really was
making up to her there was very little chance for me, so I had
better make up my mind anyhow to see and enjoy every thing I could.
I don’t think I was very much in love at the time; if it had been
a week later I should have found it much harder perhaps.</p>

<p>I kept along the shady side of the road, for it was getting hot
already, and crossed the canal, and kept making up towards the
hills. I wasn’t sure of the way, but I knew that if once I got
up the hill I should find the Ridgeway, and could follow it all
the way up to the Castle. After a bit I fell in with groups of
people, all going the same way; and so, following on with them,
after about an hour’s walk, I came to the foot of the hills; and
found a pretty little inn, standing back from the road, nestled
into a plantation, where everybody else seemed to be stopping;
and so I stopped too, and sat down on the bench before the door
to have a glass of beer before facing the pull up to the top.</p>

<p>In front of the door was an oak tree, and under the tree a big
stone with some curious holes in it, into which pieces of wood
were fitted, secured by a padlock and chain. I was wondering what
it could be, when the landlord came out with some of his guests,
and pulling out a key unlocked the padlock, and took the pieces
of wood out of the holes. Then there was some talk between the
young men and their sweethearts, and first one and then another
stooped down and blew into the hole at the top, and the stone
made a dull moaning sound, unlike any thing I had ever heard.
The landlord told me that when it was well blown on a still day,
it could be heard for four or five miles, and I should think it
could; for I left them blowing away when I started again, and
heard the sound every now and then until I was close up to the
Castle, though the wind blew from the south, and down the hill.</p>

<p>I should think a dozen parties, in all sorts of odd go-carts
and other vehicles, or on foot, must have passed the Blowing-Stone
in the ten minutes which I spent on the bench. So I got quite
eager to be up at the Castle, and paid for my beer and started
again. It is a very long stiff pull up Blowing-Stone Hill, and
the road is not a very good one; so I soon began to pass the gigs
and carts, most of which had to stop every hundred yards or so,
to let the horses and donkeys get their wind. Half-way up, in
the worst part of the hill, I found an old huckstering woman and
a boy in great trouble. They had a little cart laden with poles
and boards for a stall, and two great sacks of nuts and sweet-stuff;
and only one donkey in the shafts, who had got one wheel of the
cart into a deep chalk rut, and stood there like a post. The woman
and boy were quite beat with dragging at his head, and trying
to lift the wheel out of the rut, and as I came up she was "fairly
giving out."</p>

<p>"Lawk-a-massy! how ever be I to scawt[29] up? Do’ee lend a help,
there’s a good soul," said she to me.</p>

<p>Well, I couldn’t go by and leave her there, though I didn’t half
like having to stop; so I helped to lift the wheel out, and then
we pushed the cart up a few yards, and the old donkey tried to
sidle it into another rut, and we had another fight with him.
My blood got up at his obstinacy; I don’t believe there ever was
another such a donkey in the world; so the more he backed and
sidled, the more I and the old woman and the boy fought. And then
the people that passed us began to laugh and joke at us, and I
got very angry at them, and the old woman, and everybody; but
I set my teeth, and made up my mind to get him up to the top if
I stayed there all day.</p>

<p>I should think we must have been nearly half an hour at work,
and had got on about three hundred yards or so, when a fine dog-cart
on high wheels came up. I heard the gentlemen in it talking and
laughing as they came near us; but I didn’t look up, and kept
working away at the donkey, for I was afraid they would only joke
at us.</p>

<p>"Oh deary me, deary me, Master Gaarge, be that you?" I heard
the old woman call out; "now do’ee stop some o’ the chaps, and
tell ’em to help. I be nigh caddled to death wi’ this drattled
old jackass&mdash;oh dear, oh dear!"</p>

<p>"Why, Betty! what in the world are you after?" said a merry voice,
which I thought I had heard before; and, looking up, I saw the
young gentleman who had promised me the song.</p>

<p>"Oh, you see, Master Gaarge, I thought as I might turn a honest
penny if I could only win up to the pastime wi’ some nuts and
brandy-balls. So I loaned neighbour Tharne’s cart as he fetches
coals from the canal wi’, and his ass&mdash;and if ’twas Balaam’s ass
hisself he couldn’t be no wus&mdash;and here I be; and if it hadn’t
a been for this kind gentleman"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, stop your talk, Betty, and take hold of his head," said
he, jumping out of his dog-cart and giving the reins to the one
who was beside him. "Ah, good morning," nodding to me, as he came
to the back of the cart, "now then, with a will! shove away!"</p>

<p>So we shoved the cart hard against the donkey’s legs. "Don’t
pull, Betty, let him have his head; just keep hold of the reins.
Look out, boy; stop him making for the ditch;" and away went Master
Neddy scrambling up hill, for he found that the cart was coming
over his back if he didn’t move on. Master George was as strong
as a ballast heaver, and the donkey seemed to find it out quick
enough, for we were up the hill in no time.</p>

<p>"Bless your kind heart, Master Gaarge!" almost sobbed the old
woman; "I be all straight now. Do’ee hev summat to suck now, or
some nuts, and this kind gentleman too; you allus wur fond o’
suck;" and she began untying the neck of one of her sacks.</p>

<p>"Oh, Betty, you wicked old lone woman!" said he, "haven’t you
made me ill often enough with your nastinesses fifteen years ago?"</p>

<p>"Dwont’ee, now, call ’em names, Master Gaarge."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Betty, and make haste up to the Castle before all
the small boys are poisoned. I can give you a lift, Sir," said
he to me, "if you’ll jump up behind."</p>

<p>I thanked him, and got up behind, by the side of one of the other
young gentlemen, who I thought didn’t seem much to like having
me there; and I felt very pleased, as we bowled along the Ridgeway,
passing all the people who had been laughing at me and the donkey,
that they should see that I was in such good company, and should
be up at the Castle before any of them.</p>

<p>The whole Ridgeway was alive with holiday folk, some walking
with their coats and bonnets off, some in great wagons, some in
all sorts of strange vehicles, such as I had never seen before
(many of which Master George declared had been impressed by Alfred’s
commissariat and hospital staff, in his wars against the Danes,
when they were strong young traps); but from one and all there
rose up a hum of broad Berkshire, and merry laughter, as we shot
by them. Sometimes a yeoman in his gig, or on his stout hackney,
would try to keep up with us, or to stop us from passing him,
but Master George was a reckless driver, and somehow or another,
galloping or trotting, on the right side or the wrong, he <em>would</em>
pass; so in about ten minutes we had got over the two miles of
downs, and were close up to the Castle.</p>

<p>Here the first thing I saw was Joe, with two other farmers, carrying
a lot of little white and pink flags, and measuring ground.</p>

<p>"Please put me down, Sir," said I, "there’s my friend."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said Master George, pulling up, "I see&mdash;you’re staying
with Farmer Hurst. Well, I’m much obliged to you for helping poor
old Betty&mdash;she’s a good struggling old widow body in our village;
I’ve known her ever since I could walk and suck. Good morning,
Mr. Hurst; likely to be a good muster to-day."</p>

<p>"Mornin’, Sir," said Joe, touching his hat, "I think so&mdash;there’s
a smart lot of folk in the Castle already."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope we may meet again," said Master George to me, "I
won’t forget the song for you,"&mdash;and away he drove towards the
Castle.</p>

<p>"Why, Dick man, where’s the old horse?" said Joe, looking as
if I had come from the moon.</p>

<p>"Oh, I walked," said I, "I prefer it, when I have time."</p>

<p>"Come own it, Dick," said he, "thou wast ashamed of the old horse’s
long rough coat &mdash;I didn’t think thou hadst been such a dandy."</p>

<p>"Upon my honour it was nothing of the sort," said I, glad enough
that he wasn’t on the right scent.</p>

<p>"And how did you get along with one of our young squires?" said
he.</p>

<p>"Oh, he offered me a lift," said I; and then I told him my story.</p>

<p>"Well, you always seem to fall on your legs," said he; "who are
they with him?"</p>

<p>"Oxford scholars, I think," said I, "from their talk; but I didn’t
get on much with them, they’re not so free spoken as he is. But
what are you about here, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Oh, helping the umpires to measure out the course for the cart-horse
race; look, there are the flags right along for half a mile, and
the finish is to be up there by the side of the Castle, for all
the folk to see. But come along, for I must be after the umpires;
I see they want me."</p>

<p>"I think," said I, "I should like to go and see what’s going
on in the Castle."</p>

<p>"Very good," said he, "then I’ll look after you when we’ve done
this job;" and away he went.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t take time to go round by either of the entrances,
but made straight across to the nearest point of the great earthworks,
and scrambled over the outer bank, and down into the deep ditch,
and up the inner bank, and stood there on the top, looking down
on all the fun of the fair; for fair it was already, though it
was very little past eleven o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>There was the double line of booths and stalls which I had seen
putting up the day before, making a long and broad street, and
all decked out with nuts and apples, and ginger-bread, and all
sorts of sucks and food, and children’s toys, and cheap ribbons,
knives, braces, straps, and all manner of gaudy-looking articles.
Opposite, on the north side, all the shows had got their great
pictures up of the wonders which were to be seen inside, and the
performers were strutting about on the stages outside, and before
one of them an acrobat was swinging backwards and forwards on
the slack rope, and turning head over heels at the end of each
swing. And every show had its own music, if it were only a drum
and pan pipes, and all the musicians were playing, as loud as
they could play, different tunes. Then, on the east side, were
the great booths of the publicans, all decked out now with flowers
and cheap flags, with their skittle-grounds behind; and lots of
gypsies, and other tramps, with their "three sticks a penny,"
and other games. The west side was only occupied, as I said before,
by the great white tent of the County Police, where the Committee
were sitting, and Lord Craven’s tents some way in front; but these
looked pretty and gay now, for they had hoisted some good flags;
and there in the middle stood the great ugly stage, and the greasy
pole. The whole space was filled with all sorts of people, from
ladies looking as if they had just come from Kensington Gardens,
down to the ragged little gypsy children, with brown faces and
brick-coloured hair, all moving about, and looking very much as
if they were enjoying themselves. So after looking a minute, I
got down into the crowd, and set to work to see every thing I
could.</p>

<p>I hadn’t been pushing about amongst the rest above five minutes,
when two men stopped close by me, one (who was the Wantage crier,
I found out afterwards) with his hand full of papers, and the
other carrying a gong, which he began to beat loud enough to deafen
one. When the crowd had come round him, the crier began, and I
should think he might have been heard at Elm Close:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh yes! oh yes! by order of the Committee, all persons who mean
to play for prizes, must enter their names on the umpires’ lists.
Oh yes! oh yes! the umpires’ lists are open in the tent, and names
may be entered from now till half-past twelve. Oh yes! a list
of the umpires for the different games and sports may be seen
on the board outside the tent-door. God save the Queen!"</p>

<p>As soon as he had done, he and the man with the gong went off
to another part of the Castle, but I could see some of the men
and boys, who had been standing round, sidling off towards the
great tent to enter for some of the games, as I guessed. So I
followed across the Castle to the space in front of the tent.</p>

<p>I could see, through the entrance, two or three of the Committee
sitting at a table, with paper and pens and ink before them; and
every now and then, from the little groups which were standing
about, some man would make a plunge in, and go up to the table;
and, after a word or two with them, would enter his name on one
or more of the lists, and then come out, sometimes grinning, but
generally looking as if he were half ashamed of himself. I remarked
more and more through the day what a shy, shamefaced fellow the
real countryman was, while the gypsies and racing boys and tramps,
who entered for the races, but not for the backsword or wrestling
prizes, were all as bold as brass, and stood chattering away to
the Committee-men, till they were almost ordered out of the tent.</p>

<p>I sat down on the turf outside the tent to watch; for I felt
very much interested in the games, and liked to see the sort of
men who came to enter. There were not many very stout or tall
men amongst them; I should say they averaged about eleven stone
in weight, and five feet eight inches in height; but they looked
a very tough race; and I could quite believe, while looking at
them, what Joe told me one day&mdash;"Though there’s plenty of quicker
men, and here and there stronger ones, scarce any man that ever
comes down our way&mdash;either at navigator’s work or loafing about,
like the gypsies and tramps&mdash;can ever come up to our chaps in
<em>last</em>, whether at fighting or working."</p>

<p>There was one man amongst them who struck me particularly, I
suppose because he wore a Crimean medal with four clasps, and
went quite lame on a crutch. I found out his history. Old Mattingly,
the blacksmith of Uffington, had three sons when the Russian war
broke out. They all went for soldiers. The first was shot through
the hand, as that gray, deadly dawn broke over Inkermann, on the
5th of November, 1854. Had he gone to the rear he would probably
have lived. He fought till the last Russian vanished along the
distant road, and over the bridge heaped with slain, like a gallant
Berkshire lad&mdash;and then went to hospital and died of his wounds
within a week. The second lies before Sebastopol in the advanced
trenches of the right attack. The third, the young artilleryman,
went through the whole war, and after escaping bayonet and shot
and shell, was kicked by the horse of a wounded officer, and probably
lamed for life. According to the rules of the service, my informant
seemed to think, he was not entitled to a pension for life, "but
they had given him one for eighteen months after his discharge,
so that he had almost a year of it to run; and perhaps he might
learn blacksmith-work in that time, if he could stand at all,
for that was mostly arm-work."</p>

<p>I didn’t know what the regulations as to pensions were, or how
long young Mattingly would take to learn blacksmith-work, but
I did feel rather ashamed that England couldn’t afford to do a
little more for such as he; and should be glad for my part to
pay something towards it, if the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
or somebody, would find out a way to set this right. Or perhaps
if this should ever meet the eye of the Commander-in-Chief, or
of any of the gentlemen who were made <em>K.C.B’</em>s in the
war-time, or of any other person who has interest in the army,
they may see whether any thing more can be done for young Mattingly.</p>

<p>Many of the younger ones I could see hadn’t made up their minds
whether or no they should enter, and were larking and pushing
one another about; and I saw several good trials of strength,
and got an idea of what the wrestling was like before the lists
were closed.</p>

<p>"Bi’st in for young geamsters prize at wrastlin’, shepherd?"
asked a young carter with his hat full of ribbons, of a tight-made,
neatly-dressed fellow, who had already won a second prize, I heard,
at his village revel.</p>

<p>The shepherd nodded.</p>

<p>"Mose, mun," went on the carter, "thee shouldst go in. Thee bi’st
big enough."</p>

<p>Moses was an overgrown, raw-boned fellow, of about eighteen,
in a short smock-frock and a pair of very dilapidated militia-trousers.
He had been turning the matter over in his own mind for some time,
and now, after looking the shepherd over for a minute, pulled
his great hands out of his pockets, hunched up his shoulders,
and grunted out&mdash;</p>

<p>"’Zay! Try a file[30] wi’ thee, shepherd."</p>

<p>The bystanders all cheered. Moses, the militiaman, was rather
a joke to them. The shepherd looked scornful, but was ready to
try a file; but he stipulated that Mose must borrow some shoes
instead of his great, iron-clouted high-lows, (no man is allowed
to wrestle, I found, with any iron on his shoes.)</p>

<p>This seemed likely to stop the fun. Moses pulled off his high-lows,
and appeared in sinkers,[31] at which everybody roared; but no
shoes were to be had. Then he offered to wrestle without shoes;
but at last a pair were found, and Moses advanced with his great
hands stretched out towards the shepherd, who, not deigning to
take one hand out of his pocket, caught Mose’s elbow with the
other. After one or two awkward attempts, and narrowly escaping
some well-meant trips, Mose bored in; and before the shepherd
could seize the militiaman’s collar with his second hand, over
he went, and Mose was proclaimed winner of a file, amid shouts
of laughter. Then they buckled to again, the shepherd doing his
best; but somehow Mose managed to keep his legs; and when they
went down, both fell on their sides, and it was only a dog-fall.</p>

<p>In another minute I saw the militiaman in the tent before the
table.</p>

<p>"Plaze, Sur, put down Moses Tilling&mdash;young geamster&mdash;wrastlin’."</p>

<p>After watching the tent till the lists were just closing, I started
off to see if I could find Miss Lucy, who ought to have been up
by this time, and to get something to eat before the sports began.
The luncheon I managed easily enough, for I went over to the great
booth in which I had dined the day before, and sat down at the
long table, where Peter welcomed me, and soon gave me as much
as I could eat and drink. But when I had finished, and went out
to look for my friends, I found it a very difficult business,
and no wonder, for there were more than 20,000 people up on the
Hill.</p>

<p>First I went to the outside of the Castle, where all the carriages
were drawn up in long rows, to see if I could find the four-wheel
amongst them. As I was poking about, I came close to a fine open
carriage, and hearing a shout of merry laughter, looked up. There
were a party at lunch; two ladies and some quite young girls inside,
some boys on the box, and several gentlemen standing round, holding
bottles and sandwiches; and they were all eating and drinking,
and laughing at an old gypsy woman, who was telling the fortune
of one of the ladies.</p>

<p>"Love’ll never break your heart, my pretty lady," said the old
woman; "let the Norwood gypsy see your hand, my pretty lady."</p>

<p>The lady held out her right hand, and the little girls glanced
at the lady, and one another, brimming with fun.</p>

<p>"It’s the other hand the gypsy ought to see. Ah, well, then,
never mind," she went on, as the lady looked quietly in her face,
without moving a muscle, "the old Norwood gypsy can read it all
in your eyes. There’s a dark gentleman, and a light gentleman,
who’ll both be coming before long; there’ll be sore hearts over
it, but the richest will win before a year’s out&mdash;" Here the girls
clapped their hands, and burst into shouts, and the lady showed
her other hand with a wedding-ring on, and went on quietly with
her lunch.</p>

<p>"Ah! I never said she wasn’t married!" said the gipsy to the
girls, who only laughed the more. I had got quite close up to
the carriage, and at this moment caught the eye of the lady, who
was laughing too; then I felt awkward all at once, and as if I
was where I had no right to be. But she didn’t look the least
annoyed, and I was passing on, when I saw that Mr. Warton was
amongst the gentlemen on the other side of the carriage. "Ah,"
thought I, "I wonder if he’ll know me now he’s with his fine friends?"
But the next minute I was ashamed of myself for doubting, for
I heard him wish them good-bye, and before I was ten yards from
the carriage, he put his arm in mine.</p>

<p>"Well, you never rode after all," he began.</p>

<p>"No, Sir," said I. "But where are they? I haven’t seen Joe this
two hours."</p>

<p>"Oh, not far off," said he; "feeding, like the rest of us."</p>

<p>And further down the line we found Joe, and Miss Lucy, and several
friends of theirs, lunching on the turf by the four-wheel. So
we sat down with them, but I didn’t half like the way in which
Miss Lucy was running on with two young farmers, one on each side
of her. She told me afterwards that she had known them ever since
they were children together, but somehow that didn’t seem to me
to mend the matter much. And then again, when Joe got up, and
said it was time to move, for the sports would be just beginning,
nothing would serve her but to walk off to Wayland Smith’s cave.
I wonder whether she did it a little bit to provoke me; for she
knew that I had been to see it the day before, and that I wanted
particularly to see all the sports. But I don’t think it could
have been that after all, for when I said I should stay with Joe,
she was just as pleasant as ever, and didn’t seem to mind a bit
whether I or any one else went with her or not.</p>

<p>I am afraid I shall make a very poor hand at telling about the
sports, because I couldn’t be in five or six places at once; and
so I was kept running about, from the stage in the middle of the
Castle out on to the downs to see the cart-horse race, and then
back again into the Castle for the jingling match, and then out
on the other side to the manger for the cheese races, and so on
backwards and forwards; seeing the beginning of one sport, and
the end of another, and the middle of a third. I wish the Committee
would let the sports begin earlier, and then one might be able
to see them all. However I must do the best I can, and just put
down what I saw myself.</p>

<p>The first move for the sports was made a little before one, just
as I got back into the Castle, after seeing Miss Lucy start for
Wayland Smith’s cave. The Committee came out of their tent in
a body, each man carrying the lists of the entries for the sports
over which he was to preside. But instead of going different ways,
each to his own business, they walked across in a body to the
stage, and stopped just underneath it, in the middle of a great
crowd of men and boys; and then they shouted for silence, and
the chairman spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We wish to say a few words, my men, to those who are going to
play with the sticks or wrestle to-day. There has been a good
deal of talk about these sports, as you all know; and many persons
think they shouldn’t be allowed at all now-a-days&mdash;that the time
for them has gone by. They say, that men always lose their tempers
and get brutal at these sports. We have settled, however, to give
the old-fashioned games a fair trial; and it will rest with yourselves
whether we shall ever be able to offer prizes for them again.
For, depend upon it, if there is any savage work to-day, if you
lose your tempers, and strike or kick one another unfairly, you
will never see any more wrestling or backsword on White Horse
Hill. But we are sure we can trust you, and that there won’t be
any thing to find fault with. Only remember again, you are on
your trial, and the stage will be cleared at once, and no prizes
given, if any thing objectionable happens. And now, you can put
to as soon as you like."</p>

<p>The Committee then marched off, leaving a very large crowd round
the stage, all eager for the play to begin.</p>

<p>The two umpires got up on to the stage, and walked round, calling
out, "Two old gamesters at backsword, and two old gamesters at
wrastlin’, wanted to put to." But I suppose the chairman’s speech
had rather taken the men by surprise, for no one came forward,
though there was a crowd twenty deep round the stage.</p>

<p>"Who are the old gamesters?" I asked of the man next me.</p>

<p>"Them as has won or shared a first prize at any revel," answered
he, without looking round.</p>

<p>After a minute the chairman’s brother, who didn’t seem to have
much scruple about these sports, jumped up on the stage, and blew
an old French hunting-horn, till the young ones began to laugh;
and then told the men not to be afraid to come up, for if they
didn’t begin at once there wouldn’t be light to play out the ties.</p>

<p>At last there was a stir amongst the knot of Somersetshire men,
who stood together at one corner of the stage; and one of them,
stepping up, pitched on to it his stumpy black hat, and then climbed
up after it himself, spoke a word to the umpires, and began handling
the sticks, to choose one which balanced to his mind, while the
umpires proclaimed, "An old gamester wanted, to play with John
Bunn of Wedmore."</p>

<p>"There he stands, you see," said Master George, who was close
by me, though I hadn’t seen him before, "the only remaining representative
of the old challenger at tourneys ready to meet all comers. He
ought to have a herald to spout out his challenge in verse. Why
not?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know what he could say more than the umpire has, Sir,"
said I.</p>

<p>"He might blow his own trumpet at any rate," said he; "somehow
thus;" and he repeated, after a false start or two,&mdash;</p>

<p>John Bunn looked by no means a safe man to play with. He stood
about five feet eleven, with spare long muscular limbs, a sallow
complexion, and thick shock head of black hair,&mdash;a good defence
in itself against any common blow of a stick. But now that the
ice was broken, his challenge was soon answered; and George Gregory,
of Stratton, one of the best mowers in the Vale, appeared to uphold
the honour of Berks and Wilts. He stood half a head shorter than
his opponent, but was, probably, the stronger man of the two,
and had a sturdy and confident look, which promised well, and
was fair-haired, and, like David, ruddy to look upon.</p>

<p>[Illustration]</p>

<p>While they were taking off coats and waistcoats, and choosing
sticks, two wrestlers got up on the stage, and showed the shoes
in which they were going to wrestle to the umpires, for approval;
and stood at the ropes, ready to begin as soon as the first bout
at backsword was over. The crowd drew a long breath, while Bunn
and Gregory came forward, shook hands; and then throwing up their
guards, met in the middle of the stage.</p>

<p>At the first rattle of the sticks, the crowd began cheering again,
and pressed in closer to the stage; and I with them, for it was
very exciting, <em>that</em> I felt at once. The coolness and
resolution in the faces of the two men, as they struck and parried
with those heavy sticks, trying all the points of each other’s
play in a dozen rapid exchanges; the skill and power which every
turn of the wrist showed; and the absolute indifference with which
they treated any chance blow which fell on arm or shoulder, made
it really a grand sight; and with all my prejudices I couldn’t
help greatly admiring the players. "Bout," cried Bunn, after a
minute or so, and down came their guards, and they walked to the
side of the stage to collect coppers from the crowd below in the
baskets of their sticks, while the two first wrestlers put to
in the middle.</p>

<p>I suppose there are more unsettled points in wrestling, or it
is harder to see whether the men are playing fair, for the crowd
was much more excited now than at the backsword play, a hundred
voices shouting to the umpires every moment to stop this or that
practice. Besides, the kicking, which is allowed at elbow and
collar wrestling, makes it look brutal very often; and so I didn’t
like it so much as the backsword play, though the men were fine,
good-tempered fellows, and, when most excited, only seemed to
want what they called "fair doos."</p>

<p>I stopped by the stage until Gregory had lost his head. How it
happened I couldn’t see, but suddenly the umpires cried out "Blood!"
The men stopped; Gregory put up his hand to his hair, found that
the blood was really coming, and then dropped his stick and got
down, quite as much surprised as I was. And two more old gamesters
were called up, the first head being to Somersetshire.</p>

<p>But now I heard that the cart-horse race was just coming off,
and so following the crowd, made my way across to the east of
the Castle.</p>

<p>I scrambled up to the highest part of the bank, and so got a
capital view of the scene below. The course was marked out all
the way down to the starting-post by rows of little pink and white
flags, and the Committee-men were riding slowly up and down, trying
to get the people to keep back behind the flags. The line was,
on the whole, pretty well kept; but as the crowd got thicker every
minute, every now and then a woman with two or three children
would wander out to escape the pressure from behind; or a young
couple keeping company would run across, hoping to better their
position; or a lot of uproarious boys would start out for a lark,
to try the tempers, and very possibly the whips, of the Committee.</p>

<p>Joe presently rode by the place where I was standing, and called
out to me to come down and see the mounting. So I slipped out
of the crowd, and ran down the back of the line to the starting-place.
There I found the Squire and the umpires, passing the men and
horses. Five or six were all ready; the great horses in their
thill harness, which jingled and rattled with every movement;
and the carters perched up in the middle of the wood and leather
and brass, in their white smock-frocks, with the brims of their
break-of-days turned up in front, and a bunch of ribbons fluttering
from the side, and armed with the regular long cart-whip. Just
as I came up, Mr. Avery Whitfield’s bay horse, "King of the Isle,"
was passed, and took his place with the others. He was one of
the three favourites, I heard people say.</p>

<p>"Call the next horse."</p>

<p>"Mr. Davenport’s gray mare, Dairymaid," shouts the umpire. Here
she comes with old Joe Humphries, the jockey and horse breaker,
on her back. He is in full jockey costume&mdash;cap, jacket, and tops,
with a racing whip and spurs. The umpires look doubtfully at him,
and consult the Squire. At first they seem inclined not to let
Joe ride at all, but as the owners of the other horses don’t object,
they only insist on his taking off his spurs and changing his
whip for a common long carter’s whip. Then Dairymaid is passed,
and then one other horse; eight in all. Two of the Committee gallop
down in front to clear the course for the last time; the word
"Off" is given; and away go the great steeds in furious plunging
gallop, making the whole hill shake beneath them, and looking
(as I heard one of the Oxford scholars remark) like a charge of
German knights in some old etching. Close after them came the
umpires, the Committee-men, and all the mounted farmers, cheering
and shouting pieces of advice to the riders; and the crowd, as
they pass, shout and wave their hats, and then rush after the
horses. How everybody isn’t killed, and how those men can sit
those great beasts in the middle of that rattling mass of harness,
were my puzzles, as I scrambled along after the rest.</p>

<p>Meantime, in the race, Dairymaid shoots at once some yards ahead,
and improves her lead at every stride; for she is a famous mare,
and old Joe Humphries understands the tricks of the course, and
can push her and lift her in ways unknown to the honest carters
and foggers, who come lumbering behind him &mdash;Joe even has
time for a contemptuous glance over his shoulder at his pursuers.
But the race is not always to the swift, at least not to those
who are swiftest at starting. Half-way up the course, Dairymaid
ceases to gain; then she shows signs of distress, and scarcely
answers to Joe’s persuasions. "King of the Isle" is creeping up
to her&mdash;the carter shakes his bridle, and begins to ply his long
cart-whip&mdash;they are crossing the Ridgeway, where stand the carter’s
fellow-servants, Mr. Whitfield’s fogger, shepherd, ploughboys,
&amp;c. who set up a shout as he passes, which sends the bay right
up abreast of the mare. No wonder they are excited, for the master
has promised that the three guineas, the price of the new thill
harness, shall be divided between them, if the bay wins.</p>

<p>In another fifty yards he is drawing ahead. All old Joe’s efforts
are in vain; his jockeyship has only done him harm, whereas the
carter’s knowledge of what his steed’s real powers are, has been
the making of him, and he rides in, brandishing his long cart-whip,
an easy winner.</p>

<p>Dairymaid is second, but only just before the ruck; and old Joe
creeps away, let us hope, a humbler and a wiser man.</p>

<p>Of course I couldn’t see all this myself, because I was behind,
but Joe told me all about the race directly afterwards. When I
got up there was a great crowd round "King of the Isle," from
whose back the carter was explaining something about the race.
But I couldn’t stay to listen, for I heard that the races for
the "prime coated Berkshire fives" (as they called the cheeses),
were just coming off; so I hurried away to the brow of the hill,
just above the Horse, where it is steepest; for I wanted of all
things to see how men could run down this place, which I couldn’t
get up without using both hands.</p>

<p>There stood Mr. William Whitfield, of Uffington, the umpire who
had to start the race, in his broad-brimmed beaver, his brown
coat and waistcoat with brass buttons, and drab breeches and gaiters.
I thought him a model yeoman to look at, but I didn’t envy him
his task. Two wild-looking gypsy women, with their elf-locks streaming
from under their red handkerchiefs, and their black eyes flashing,
were rushing about amongst the runners, trying to catch some of
their relations who were going to run; and screaming out that
their men should never break their limbs down that break-neck
place. The gypsies dodged about, and kept out of their reach,
and the farmer remonstrated, but the wild women still persevered.
Then, losing all patience, he would turn and poise the wheel,
ready to push it over the brow, when a shout from the bystanders
warns him to pause, and, a little way down the hill, just in the
line of the race, appear two or three giggling lasses, hauled
along by their sweethearts, and bent on getting a very good view.
Luckily at this moment the Chairman appeared, and rode his white
horse down to the front of the line of men, where there seemed
to me to be footing for nothing but a goat. Then the course was
cleared for a moment, he moved out of the line, making a signal
to the farmer, who pushed the wheel at once over the brow, and
cried, "Off." The wheel gained the road in three bounds, cleared
it in a fourth monster bound which measured forty yards, and hurried
down far away to the bottom of the manger, where the other two
umpires were waiting to decide who is the winner of the race.</p>

<p>[Illustration]</p>

<p>Away go the fourteen men in hot pursuit, gypsies, shepherds,
and light-heeled fellows of all sorts, helter-skelter; some losing
their foothold at once, and rolling or slipping down; some still
keeping their footing, but tottering at every step; one or two,
with their bodies well thrown back, striking their heels firmly
into the turf, and keeping a good balance. They are all in the
road together, but here several fall on their faces, and others
give in; the rest cross it in a moment, and are away down the
manger. Here the sheep-walks, which run temptingly along the sides
of the manger, but if they would look forward will take the runners
very little nearer the bottom where the wheel lies, mislead many;
and amongst the rest, the fleetest of the gypsies, who makes off
at full speed along one of them. Two or three men go still boldly
down the steep descent, falling and picking themselves up again;
and Jonathan Legg, of Childrey, is the first of these. He has
now gained the flat ground at the bottom, where after a short
stagger he brings himself up, and makes straight for the umpires
and the wheel. The gypsy now sees his error; and turning short
down the hill, comes into the flat, running some twenty yards
behind Jonathan. In another hundred yards he would pass him, for
he gains at every stride; but it is too late; and we, at the top
of the hill, cheer loudly when we see Jonathan, the man who had
gone straight all the way, touch the wheel a clear ten yards before
his more active rival.</p>

<p>I should have liked to have seen the boys’ races down the manger,
but was afraid of missing some other sport, so I left farmer Whitfield
at his troublesome post, shouting out the names of the boys and
trying to get them into line, and went back into the Castle, where
I found a crowd round the greased pole; and when I got up to it,
saw a heavy-looking fellow, standing some five feet up the pole,
with one foot in a noose of cord depending from a large gimlet,
and the other leg hooked round the pole. He held in his right
hand another large gimlet, which he was preparing to screw into
the pole to support a second noose, and gazed stolidly down at
a Committee-man, who was objecting "that this wasn’t fair climbing&mdash;that
if gimlets and nooses were to be allowed, he could get up himself."
I thought he was right; but public feeling seemed to side with
the climber; so the Committee-man gave in, declaring that there
would be no more legs of mutton to climb for, if any thing but
arms and legs were to be used.</p>

<p>"Rather a slow bit of sport this," I said to an old gray-headed
man, who was leaning on his stick at my side, and staring up at
the performer.</p>

<p>"Ees, Zur," answered he, "I dwon’t knaow but what it be."</p>

<p>"Do you call it fair climbing, now?"</p>

<p>"Auh, bless’ee, not I. I minds seein’ the young chaps when I
wur a buoy, climin’ maypowls a deal higher nor that, dree at a
time. But now-a-days ’um be lazy, and afraid o’ spwiling their
breeches wi’ the grase."</p>

<p>"Are there any maypoles about here now?"</p>

<p>"Never a one as I knows on, Zur, for twenty mile round. The last
as I remembers wur the Longcott one, and Parson Watts of Uffington
had he sawed up nigh forty year ago, for fear lest there should
ha’ been some murder done about ’un."</p>

<p>"Murder about a maypole! Why, how was that?"</p>

<p>"Auh! you see, Zur, this here Longcott maypowl wur the last in
all these parts, and a wur the envy of a zight o’ villages round
about. Zo, one cluttery[34] night in November, thirty of our Ashbury
chaps thay started down to Longcott, and dug ’un up, and brought
’un cler away on handspikes, all the waay to the Crown’d Inn at
Ashbury, and ’tis quite vour mil’d."</p>

<p>"On handspikes! Why, how big was he, then?"</p>

<p>"Augh! a fyeightish sized ’un. How big? whoy a sight bigger,
bless’ee, nor that ’un, and all the bottom half on ’un solid oak.
When thay cum to put ’un up afore the bar winder of the Crown’d,
a reached right up auver the tops o’ the housen. But zoon arter
a wur put up, the Uffington chaps cum up, and tuk and carried
’un down ther’. Ther’ was a smartish row or two about ’un at Uffington
arter that, but they watched ’un night and day; and when the Lambourn
chaps cum arter ’un one night, they chucked scaldin’ water right
auver’m. Zo then Parson Watts, he tuk and sawed ’un up, and guv
’un to the owld women at Christmas for virewood."</p>

<p>I walked away from the pole, turning over in my mind whether
Parson Watts was right or wrong in his summary method of restoring
peace to his parish, and, somehow or other, found myself again
close under the stage. Now, and throughout the day, I found no
flagging there; whenever I passed there was the crowd of men standing
round, and the old and young gamesters hard at work. So I began
to believe what Joe had said, that the countrymen thought more
about these games than any thing else, and wouldn’t care to go
to the pastime if they were stopped.</p>

<p>I found that the Ashbury men were carrying it all their own way
in the wrestling, and that their champion, old Richens (the rat-catcher,
an old gamester in his fiftieth year), would probably not even
have to wrestle at all; for his own men were throwing all the
gamesters of the other parishes, and of course would give up to
him when it came to the last ties. The men all wrestle in sides,
at least the old gamesters do; so that a man generally plays for
his parish, and not for his own head, which is a better thing,
I think.</p>

<p>As to the backsword play, the stage was strewed with splinters
of sticks and pieces of broken baskets, and many a young gamester
has had his first broken head in public. But, for the chief prize,
matters are going hard with Berks and Wilts. The Somersetshire
old gamesters have won two heads to one; and, as they have six
men in, and Berks and Wilts only four, the odds are all in favour
of the cider county, and against the beer drinkers.</p>

<p>In good time up gets an old gamester, who looks like the man
to do credit to the royal county. It is Harry Seeley, of Shrivenham,
the only Berkshire man in; for there has been some difference
between Berks and Wilts, and Harry’s two mates haven’t entered
at all. So he, being one of the true bull-dog breed, is in for
his own head, against all odds, and is up to play the next Somersetshire
man.</p>

<p>Harry is a fine specimen of an Englishman. Five feet eight high,
with a bullet head, and light blue eye; high-couraged, cool, and
with an absolutely imperturbable temper. He plays in a blue shirt,
thin from age and wear, through which you may see the play of
his splendid arms and chest. His opponent is a much younger man,
about the same size; but a great contrast to Harry, for he has
a savage and sly look about him.</p>

<p>They shake hands, throw themselves into position, and the bout
begins. Harry is clearly the finer player, and his adversary feels
this at once; and the shouts of anticipated victory, in the Berkshire
tongue, rouse his temper.</p>

<p>Now comes a turn of the savage play, which ought never to be
seen on a stage. The Somerset man bends far back, and strikes
upper cuts at the face and arms, and then savagely at the body.
He is trying to maim and cow, and not to win by fair brave play.
The crowd soon begin to get savage too; upper-cutting is not thought
fair in Berks and Wilts; a storm begins to brew, hard words are
bandied, and a cry of "Foul," and "Pull him down," is heard more
than once, and the Committee man, who watches from below, is on
the point of stopping the bout.</p>

<p>But nothing puts out old Harry Seeley; no upper cut can reach
his face, for his head is thrown well back, and his guard is like
a rock; and though the old blue shirt is cut through and through,
he makes no more of the welts of the heavy stick than if it were
a cat’s tail. Between the bouts his face is cheery and confident,
and he tells his friends to "hold their noise, and let him alone
to tackle the chap," as he hands round his basket for the abounding
coppers.</p>

<p>Now I could see well enough why the parsons don’t like these
games. It gave me a turn, to watch the faces round the stage getting
savage, and I could see what it might soon get to if there was
much of this wild work. And there were Master George, and the
two Oxford scholars, at the opposite corner of the stage, shouting
till they were hoarse for old Seeley, and as savage and wicked-looking
as any of the men round them; setting such a bad example, too,
as I thought,&mdash;whereas it didn’t matter for a fellow like me,
who was nobody,&mdash;so I shouted, and threw my coppers to old Seeley,
and felt as wild as any of them, I do believe. Three bouts, four
bouts pass; Harry’s stick gets in oftener and oftener. Has the
fellow no blood in him? There it comes at last! In the fifth bout,
Harry’s stick goes flashing in again, a fair down blow from the
wrist, which puts the matter beyond all question, as the Somersetshire
man staggers back across the stage, the blood streaming from under
his hair. Loud are the shouts which greet the fine-tempered old
gamester, as he pulls on his velveteen coat, and gets down from
the stage.</p>

<p>"Why, Harry, thou’dst broke his yead second bout, mun, surely!"
shout his admirers.</p>

<p>"No," says Harry, dogmatically, "you see, mates, there’s no ’cumulation
of blood belongs to thay cider-drinking chaps, as there does to
we as drinks beer. Besides, thay drinks vinegar allus for a week
afore playin’, which dries up most o’ the blood as they <em>has</em>
got; so it takes a ’mazin’ sight of cloutin’ to break their yeads
as should be."</p>

<p>After this bout all the other play seemed to be tasteless; so,
promising myself to come back and see the ties played off, (unless
Miss Lucy turned up in the mean time, in which case I shouldn’t
have dared to go near the stage, and in fact I felt rather nervous
already, lest she should have seen or heard of me there,) I marched
off, and joined the crowd which was collecting round the jingling
ring. That crowd was one of the pleasantest sights of the whole
day. The jingling match seemed a very popular sport, especially
with the women. There they were, of all ranks&mdash;for I’m certain
I saw some young ladies in riding habits, and others in beautiful
muslins, whom I, and Jem Fisher, and little Neddy have often seen
riding with very great people in the Park, when we have managed
to get down to Rotten Row on summer evenings&mdash;seated on the grass
or standing round the ring, in all sorts of dresses, from fine
silks down to cottons at 2_d._ a yard, and all looking pleasant
and good-tempered, and as if they were quite used to being mixed
up like this every day&mdash;which I’m sure I wish they were, for my
part, especially if the men were allowed to join in the crowd
too, as we were round the jingling ring. For there were gentlemen,
both parsons and others, and farmers, and ploughboys, and all
manner of other men and boys.</p>

<p>I don’t know what sort of fun a jingling match is in general,
but I thought this one much the slowest game I saw. The ring must
have been forty yards across, or thereabouts, and there were only
eight blindfolded men running after the bellman. To make it good
fun, there should have been twenty-five or thirty at least. Then
the bellman, who has his hands tied behind him, ought to have
the bell tied round his neck, or somewhere where he can’t get
at it to stop the ringing; but our bellman had the bell tied to
his waistband behind, so that he could catch hold of it with his
hands, and stop it when he was in danger. Then half the men could
see, I’m sure, by the way they carried their heads up in the air,
especially one gypsy, who, I think, won the prize at last. The
men who couldn’t see were worth watching, for they kept catching
and tumbling over one another. One time they made a rush to the
rope, just where some of the young ladies were sitting, and, as
nearly as could be, tumbled over among them. I thought there would
have been a great scrambling and screaming; not a bit of it&mdash;they
never flinched an inch, or made the least cry, and I was very
proud to think they were my countrywomen. After the bellman had
been caught about a minute, there was a great laugh at one of
the blinded men, who made a rush, and caught a Committee-man,
who was standing in the ring, in his arms. But on the whole, I
thought the game a poor one, and was glad when it was over.</p>

<p>I hurried away directly after the jingling match, and went across
the Castle, and out on to the down where the cart-horse race had
been run to see the foot-races, which were run over the last half
of the same course, on which ten good stiff sets of hurdles, at
short distances apart, had been set up. I found a debate going
on between the umpires and some of the men as to whether they
were all to start together. The regular agricultural labourers
were remonstrating as to some of the candidates.</p>

<p>"It bean’t narra mossel o’ use for we chaps to start along wi’
thay light-heeled gentry," said one,&mdash;"Whoy, look ’ee here, zur’s
one, and yander’s another, wi’ a kind o’ dancin’ pumps on, and
that ’un at tother end wi’ a cricketin’ waistcut."</p>

<p>"And there’s two o’ them little jockey chaps amongst ’em, sumweres,
Zur," said another, looking about for these young gentlemen, who
dodged behind some of the bigger candidates.</p>

<p>"How can we help that?" said the umpire.</p>

<p>"Auh, Zur, thay be all too nimble by half for we to be of any
account to ’em," persisted the first speaker. "If twur for the
sticks now, or wrastling&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, but what shall we do then?" interrupted the umpire.</p>

<p>"Let I pick out ten or a dozen on ’em to run by theirselves."
The umpires proposed this to the rest, and, no one objecting,
told Giles, the protester, to pick out the ten he was most afraid
of. This Giles proceeded to do with a broad grin on his face,
and generally seemed to make a good selection. But presently he
arrived at, and after a short inspection passed over, a young
fellow in his blue shirt-sleeves and a cloth cap, who to the umpire’s
eye seemed a dangerous man.</p>

<p>"Why, Giles," said he, "you’re never going to pass him over?"</p>

<p>"Auh, ees, Zur," said Giles, "let he ’bide along wi’ we chaps.
Dwont’ee zee, he’s a tipped and naayled ’un?"</p>

<p>When Giles had finished his selection, the first lot were started,
and made a grand race; which was won by a Hampshire man from Kingsclere,
the second man, not two feet behind, being a young Wiltshire farmer,
who, having never been beaten in his own neighbourhood, had come
to lose his laurels honourably at the Scouring.</p>

<p>The running in the second race was, of course, not so good, but
much more amusing. The "tipped and naayled ’uns" were a rushing
lot, but very bad at rising. Hurdle after hurdle went down before
them with a crash, and the most wonderful summersaults were executed.
The second hurdle finished poor Giles, who charged it manfully,
and found himself the next moment on his broad back, gazing placidly
up into the evening sky. The cloth cap, notwithstanding his shoes,
went easily ahead, and won in a canter. I heard one of the umpires
rallying Giles afterwards at his want of eyes.</p>

<p>"Ees, Zur," said Giles, hunching up his great shoulders, "I wur
tuk in, zure enough. He wur a town chap, arter all, as wouldn’t
ha’ knowed a piece o’ clumpers afore he cum across to White Hos
Hill."</p>

<p>I left the umpires now to start the other races, and got back
once again into the Castle. I was now beginning to get very tired
in my legs, though not in my spirits, so I went and sat down outside
the crowd, which was thicker than ever round the stage, for the
ties were being played out. I could hear the umpires call every
now and then for some gamester who was not forthcoming to play
out his tie&mdash;"John Giles, if you beant on the stage in five minutes,
to put to with James Higgins, you shall lose your head"&mdash;through
all the cheers and shouts, which rose louder and louder now that
every blow or trip might decide the prizes. And while I was sitting,
the donkey races were run outside, and I heard were very good
fun; especially the last one, in which no man rode his own donkey,
and the last donkey had the prize. I hope my friend, the old suck-woman,
entered neighbour Thorne’s beast, for if she did, I’ll be bound
he carried off the prize for her. They were the only sports that
I didn’t manage to see something of.</p>

<p>It was now just five o’clock, the hour for the pig-race, which
seemed to be a most popular sport, for most of the lookers-on
at the stage went off to see it, leaving only a select crowd of
old and young gamesters, most of whom had been playing themselves,
and whom nothing could drag five yards from the posts until the
ties were all played out. I was just considering whether I should
move or stay where I was, when Master George came striding by
and caught sight of me.</p>

<p>"Hullo," said he, "how is it you’re not on the move? You must
see the pig-race; come along." So I got up and shambled along
with him.</p>

<p>The pig was to be started on the slope below the west entrance,
where the old gentleman had stood and lectured me the day before
about Earl Sidroc. There was the spring cart, covered with a net,
with a fine young Berkshire pig in it, just at the place where
the Bersirkir (as he called them) made their last stand. When
we came up, the runners, thirty in number, with their coats and
waistcoats off, were just being drawn up in line inside the Castle,
from which place they were to be started, and run down through
the west entrance out on to the open down, at the word "off."
It was thought that this rush down between the double banks, covered
thickly with the crowd, would be the finest sight of the race.
But the rush never came. Piggy was to have five minutes law, and
the Committee-man who went down to turn him out put his snout
towards Ashdown Park, and gave him a push in hopes that he would
take straight away over the downs, and so get a good start. Of
course, he turned right round and came trotting and grunting up
towards the Castle, to see what all the bustle could be about.
Then the crowd began to shout at him, and to press further and
further down the outer earthworks, though all the Committee were
there to keep the course clear for the regular runners; and at
last, before half of the five minutes were over, the whole line
broke up with a great shout, and the down was covered in a moment
with countless men and boys in full chase of Piggy. Then the lawful
candidates could stand it no longer, and away they went too, cleaving
their way through the press, the Committee riding after them as
fast as was safe in such a crowd, to see fair play if possible
at the finish.</p>

<p>In a minute or two, Piggy was mobbed, surrounded, seized first
by one of the crowd, and then by a lawful runner. These tumbled
over in their struggle without loosing their hold and more of
their friends over them, and from the middle of the mass poor
Piggy sent up the most vigorous and dismal squeals, till the Committee-men
rode in, laying about with their whips; and Farmer Whitfield,
springing off, seized Piggy, and in another minute was cantering
away with him towards Wayland Smith’s cave. Here he was turned
out again for a fair race, and was won by Charles Ebury, of Fernham;
who, fearing the results of his racing performances, sold him
at once for 10_s._ to the Woolston carrier. But I am happy to
say that he wasn’t really hurt, for I went to see him some days
afterwards, and found him as hearty as pig could be.</p>

<p>Master George and I agreed, as we walked back to the Castle,
that it is a shame to have a pig-race.</p>

<p>"No," said he, "let men run any risk they like of broken heads
or limbs for themselves; they may play or not as they like. But
Piggy has no choice, and to let him run the risk of having the
legs pulled out of his body before he is wanted for pork, isn’t
fair."</p>

<p>"He didn’t seem to think it was, certainly, Sir," I said.</p>

<p>"No," said he, laughing; "did you ever hear such a song as he
made? No animal can talk like a pig. He can scold or remonstrate
just as well as a Christian. Any one who knows the language can
tell you just what he is saying. Well," he went on, "I see you
don’t believe me; now I will go and hear what he has to say about
this proceeding, and give you it word for word."</p>

<p>This was what he gave me afterwards, with the other songs he
had promised me:&mdash;</p>

"Vathers, mothers, mothers’ zons!<br/>
You as loves yer little wuns!<br/>
Happy pegs among the stubble,<br/>
Listen to a tale of trouble;<br/>
Listen, pegs in yeard and stye,<br/>
How the Barkshire chaps zard I.

Wher I vrolicked var a while,<br/>
As vine a peg as e’er wur zeen<br/>
(One of a litter o’ thirteen)<br/>
Till zome chaps wi’ cussed spite<br/>
Aimed ov I to make a zite,<br/>
And to have a ‘bit o’ vun,’<br/>
Took I up to Uffington.

"Up, vorights[35] the Castle mound<br/>
They did zet I on the ground;<br/>
Then a thousand chaps, or nigh,<br/>
Runned and hollered arter <em>I&mdash;<br/>
</em>Ther, then, I till I wur blowed,<br/>
Runned and hollered all I knowed,<br/>
When, zo zure as pegs is pegs,<br/>
Eight chaps ketched I by the legs,<br/>
Two to each&mdash;’tis truth I tell ’ee&mdash;<br/>
Dree more clasped I round the belly!<br/>
Under all they fellers lyin’&mdash;<br/>
Pegs!<br/>

Fot I out o’ all thuck caddle,<br/>
Stretched athurt the varmer’s zaddle&mdash;<br/>
Bless ’em, pegs in yeard and stye,<br/>
Them two vrends as stuck to I.

"Barkshire men, vrom Hill and Vale,<br/>
All as ever hears this tale,<br/>

Be zhart o’ wind, and tight o’ skin,<br/>
Dwont’ee hunt ’em, but instead<br/>
At backswyrd break each other’s yead<br/>
Cheezes down the manger rowl&mdash;<br/>
Or try and clim the greasy powl.

May you be never zard like I,<br/>
