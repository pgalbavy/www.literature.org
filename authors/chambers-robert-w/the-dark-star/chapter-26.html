<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Marotte, the butler, in dry clothes, had served luncheon&mdash;a silent,
respectable, self-respecting man, calm in his fury at the incredible
outrage perpetrated upon his person.</p>

<p>And now luncheon was over; the Princess at the telephone in her
boudoir; Rue in the music-room with Neeland, still excited, anxious,
confused.</p>

<p>Astonishment, mortification, anger, had left Neeland silent;
and the convention known as luncheon had not appealed to him.</p>

<p>But very little was said during that formality; and in the silence
the serious nature of the episode which so suddenly had deprived
the Princess of the olive-wood box and the papers it contained
impressed Neeland more and more deeply.</p>

<p>The utter unexpectedness of the outrage&mdash;the helpless figure
he had cut&mdash;infuriated him. And the more he reflected the madder
he grew when he realised that all he had gone through meant nothing
now&mdash;that every effort had been sterile, every hour wasted, every
step he had taken from Brookhollow to Paris&mdash;to the very doorstep
where his duty ended&mdash;had been taken in vain.</p>

<p>It seemed to him in his anger and humiliation that never had
any man been so derided, so heartlessly mocked by the gods.</p>

<p>And now, as he sat there behind lowered blinds in the cool half-light
of the music-room, he could feel the hot blood of resentment and
chagrin in his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Nobody could have foreseen it," repeated Rue Carew in a pretty,
bewildered voice. "And if the Princess Naïa had no suspicions,
how could I harbour any&mdash;or how could you?"</p>

<p>"I've been sufficiently tricked&mdash;or I thought I had been&mdash;to
be on my guard. But it seems not. I ought never to have been caught
in such a disgusting trap&mdash;such a simple, silly, idiotic cage!
But&mdash;good Lord! How on earth was a man to suspect anything so&mdash;so
naturally planned and executed&mdash;so simply done. It was an infernal
masterpiece, Rue. But&mdash;that is no consolation to a man who has
been made to appear like a monkey!"</p>

<p>The Princess, entering, overheard; and she seated herself and
looked tranquilly at Neeland as he resumed his place on the sofa.</p>

<p>"You were not to blame, Jim," she said. "It was my fault. I had
warning enough at the railroad terminal when an accident to my
car was reported to me by the control through you." She added,
calmly: "There was no accident."</p>

<p>"No accident?" exclaimed Neeland, astonished.</p>

<p>"None at all. My new footman, who followed us to the waiting
salon for incoming trains, returned to my chauffeur, Caron, saying
that he was to go back to the garage and await orders. I have
just called the garage and I had Caron on the wire. There was
no accident; he has not been injured; and&mdash;the new footman has
disappeared!"</p>

<p>"It was a clear case of treachery?" exclaimed Neeland.</p>

<p>"Absolutely a plot. The pretended official at the terminal control
was an accomplice of my footman, of the taxicab driver, of the
pretended street-cleaners&mdash;and of whom else I can, perhaps, imagine."</p>

<p>"Did you call the terminal control?"</p>

<p>"I did. The official in charge and the starter had seen no such
accident; had given no such information. Some masquerader in uniform
must have intercepted you, Jim."</p>

<p>"I found him coming toward me on the sidewalk not far from the
kiosque. He was in uniform; I never dreamed he was not the genuine
thing."</p>

<p>"There is no blame attached to you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Naïa, it actually sickens me to discover how little sense I
possess. I've been through enough to drive both suspicion and
caution into this wooden head of mine&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What have you been through, Jim?" asked the Princess calmly.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you. I didn't play a brilliant rôle, I'm sorry to
admit. Not common sense but sheer luck pulled me through as far
as your own doorstep. And there," he added disgustedly, "the gods
no doubt grew tired of such an idiot, and they handed me what
was coming to me."</p>

<p>He was so thoroughly and so boyishly ashamed and angry with himself
that a faint smile flitted over the Princess Naïa's lips.</p>

<p>"Proceed, James," she said.</p>

<p>"All right. Only first may I ask&mdash;who is Ilse Dumont?"</p>

<p>For a moment the Princess sat silent, expressionless, intent
on the man whose clear, inquiring eyes still questioned her.</p>

<p>The Princess finally answered with a question:</p>

<p>"Did <em>she</em> cause you any trouble, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Every bit I had was due to her. Also&mdash;and here's a paradox &mdash;I
shouldn't be here now if Ilse Dumont had not played square with
me. Who is she?"</p>

<p>The Princess Naïa did not reply immediately. Instead, she dropped
one silken knee over the other, lighted a cigarette, and sat for
a few moments gazing into space. Then:</p>

<p>"Ilse Dumont," she said, "is a talented and exceedingly pretty
young woman who was born in Alsace of one German and one thoroughly
Germanised parent.</p>

<p>"She played two seasons in Chicago in light opera under another
name. She had much talent, an acceptable voice and she became
a local favourite."</p>

<p>The Princess looked at her cigarette; continued speaking as though
addressing it:</p>

<p>"She sang at the Opéra Comique here in Paris the year before
last and last year. Her rôles were minor ones. Early this spring
she abruptly broke her contract with the management and went to
New York."</p>

<p>Neeland said bluntly:</p>

<p>"Ilse Dumont is an agent in the service of the Turkish Government."</p>

<p>The Princess nodded.</p>

<p>"Did you know it, Naïa?"</p>

<p>"I began to suspect it recently."</p>

<p>"May I ask how?"</p>

<p>The Princess glanced at Rue and smiled:</p>

<p>"Ruhannah's friend, Colonel Izzet Bey, was very devoted to Minna
Minti&#11834;"</p>

<p>"To <em>whom</em>!" exclaimed Neeland, astounded.</p>

<p>"To Ilse Dumont. Minna Minti is her stage name," said the Princess.</p>

<p>Neeland turned and looked at Rue, who, conscious of his excitement,
flushed brightly, yet never suspecting what he was about to say.</p>

<p>The Princess said quietly:</p>

<p>"Yes, tell her, Jim. It is better she should know. Until now
it has not been necessary to mention the matter, or I should have
done so."</p>

<p>Rue, surprised, still prettily flushed with expectancy, looked
with new curiosity from one to the other.</p>

<p>Neeland said:</p>

<p>"Ilse Dumont, known on the stage as Minna Minti, is the divorced
wife of Eddie Brandes."</p>

<p>At the mention of a name so long hidden away, buried in her memory,
and almost forgotten, the girl quivered and straightened up, as
though an electric shock had passed through her body.</p>

<p>Then a burning colour flooded her face as at the swift stroke
of a lash, and her grey eyes glimmered with the starting tears.</p>

<p>"You'll have to know it, darling," said the Princess in a low
voice. "There is no reason why you should not; it no longer can
touch you. Don't you know that?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes&#11834;" Ruhannah's slowly drooping head was lifted again;
held high; and the wet brilliancy slowly dried in her steady eyes.</p>

<p>"Before I tell you," continued Neeland, "what happened to me
through Ilse Dumont, I must tell you what occurred in the train
on my way to Paris.... May I have a cigarette, Princess Naïa?"</p>

<p>"At your elbow in that silver box."</p>

<p>Rue Carew lighted it for him with a smile, but her hand still
trembled.</p>

<p>"First," he said, "tell me what particular significance those
papers in the olive-wood box have. Then I can tell you more intelligently
what happened to me since I went to Brookhollow to find them."</p>

<p>"They are the German plans for the fortification of the mainland
commanding the Dardanelles, and for the forts dominating the Gallipoli
peninsula."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that. But of what interest to England or France
or Russia&#11834;"</p>

<p>"If there is to be war, can't you understand the importance to
us of those plans?" asked the Princess in a low, quiet voice.</p>

<p>"To&mdash;'us'?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes, to <em>us</em>. I am Russian, am I not?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I now understand how very Russian you are, Princess. But
what has Turkey&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What <em>is</em> Turkey?"</p>

<p>"An empire&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No. A German province."</p>

<p>"I did not know&#11834;"</p>

<p>"That is what the Ottoman Empire is today," continued the Princess
Mistchenka, "a Turkish province fortified by Berlin, governed
from Berlin through a Germanised Turk, Enver Pasha; the army organised,
drilled, equipped, officered, and paid by the Kaiser Wilhelm;
every internal resource and revenue and development and projected
development mortgaged to Germany and under German control; and
the Sultan a nobody!"</p>

<p>"I did not know it," repeated Neeland.</p>

<p>"It is the truth, <em>mon ami</em>. It is inevitable that Turkey
fights if Germany goes to war. England, France, Russia know it.
Ask yourself, then, how enormous to us the value of those plans&mdash;tentative,
sketchy, perhaps, yet the inception and foundation of those German-made
and German-armed fortifications which today line the Dardanelles
and the adjacent waters within the sphere of Ottoman influence!"</p>

<p>"So <em>that</em> is why you wanted them," he said with an unhappy
glance at Rue. "What idiotic impulse prompted me to put them back
in the box I can't imagine. You saw me do it, there in the taxicab."</p>

<p>Ruhannah said:</p>

<p>"The chauffeur saw you, too. He was looking at you in his steering
mirror; I saw his face. But it never entered my mind that anything
except idle curiosity possessed him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said the Princess to Neeland, "what you did with the
papers saved your life. Had that chauffeur not seen you place
them in the box, he might have shot and robbed you as you left
the cab, merely on the chance of your having them on your person."</p>

<p>There was a silence; then Neeland said:</p>

<p>"This is a fine business! As far as I can see murder seems to
be the essence of the contract."</p>

<p>"It is often incidental to it," said the Princess Mistchenka
serenely. "But you and Ruhannah will soon be out of this affair."</p>

<p>"I?" said the girl, surprised.</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"Why, dear?"</p>

<p>"I think there is going to be war. And if there is, France will
be concerned. And that means that you and Ruhannah, too, will
have to leave France."</p>

<p>"But you?" asked the girl, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I expect to remain. How long can you stay here, Jim?"</p>

<p>Neeland cast an involuntary glance at Rue as he replied:</p>

<p>"I intended to take the next steamer. Why? Can I be of any service
to you, Princess Naïa?"</p>

<p>The Princess Mistchenka let her dark eyes rest on him for a second,
then on Rue Carew.</p>

<p>"I was thinking," she said, "that you might take Ruhannah back
with you if war is declared."</p>

<p>"Back to America!" exclaimed the girl. "But where am I to go
in America? What am I to do there? I &mdash;I didn't think I was
quite ready to earn my own living"&mdash;looking anxiously at the Princess
Naïa&mdash;"do you think so, dear?"</p>

<p>The Princess said:</p>

<p>"I wanted you to remain. And you must not worry, darling. Some
day I shall want you back&#11834; But if there is to be war in Europe
you cannot remain here."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, only useful people would be wanted in Paris&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But, Naïa, darling! Couldn't I be useful to you?" The girl jumped
up from the sofa and came and knelt down by the Princess Mistchenka,
looking up into her face.</p>

<p>The Princess laid aside her cigarette and put both hands on Rue's
shoulders, looking her gravely, tenderly in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Dear," she said, "I want James Neeland to hear this, too. For
it is partly a confession.</p>

<p>"When I first saw you, Rue, I was merely sorry for you, and willing
to oblige Jim Neeland by keeping an eye on you until you were
settled somewhere here in Paris.</p>

<p>"Before we landed I liked you. And, because I saw wonderful possibilities
in the little country girl who shared my stateroom, I deliberately
made up my mind to develop you, make use of your excellent mind,
your quick intelligence, your amazing capacity for absorbing everything
that is best, and your very unusual attractions for my own purposes.
I meant&mdash;to train you&mdash;educate you&mdash;to aid me."</p>

<p>There was a silence; the girl looked up at her, flushed, intent,
perplexed; the Princess Mistchenka, her hands on the girl's shoulders,
looked back at her out of grave and beautiful dark eyes.</p>

<p>"That is the truth," said the Princess. "My intention was to
develop you along the lines which I follow as a&mdash;profession; teach
you to extract desirable information through your wit, intelligence,
and beauty&mdash;using your youth as a mask. But I &mdash;I can't do
it&#11834;" She shook her head slightly. "Because I've lost my heart
to you.... And the business I follow is a&mdash;a rotten game."</p>

<p>Again silence fell among those three; Rue, kneeling at the elder
woman's feet, looked up into her face in silence; Neeland, his
elbows resting on his knees, leaned slightly forward from the
sofa, watching them.</p>

<p>"I'll help you, if you wish," said Rue Carew.</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear. No."</p>

<p>"Let me. I owe you everything since I have been here&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, dear. What I said to you&mdash;and to James&mdash;is true. It's a
merciless, stealthy, treacherous business; it's dangerous to a
woman, body and soul. It is one long lifetime of experience with
treachery, with greed, with baser passions, with all that is ignoble
in mankind.</p>

<p>"There is no reason for you to enter such a circle; no excuse
for it; no duty urges you; no patriotism incites you to such self-sacrifice;
no memory of wrong done to your nearest and dearest inspires you
to dedicate your life to aiding&mdash;if only a little, in the downfall
and destruction of the nation and the people who encompassed it!"</p>

<p>The Princess Mistchenka's dark eyes began to gleam, and her beautiful
face lost its colour; and she took Rue's little hands in both
of hers and held them tightly against her breast.</p>

<p>"Had I not lost my heart to you, perhaps I should not have hesitated
to develop and make use of you.</p>

<p>"You are fitted for the rôle I might wish you to play. Men are
fascinated by you; your intelligence charms; your youth and innocence,
worn as a mask, might make you invaluable to the Chancellerie
which is interested in the information I provide for it.</p>

<p>"But, Rue, I have come to understand that I cannot do this thing.
No. Go back to your painting and your clever drawing and your
music; any one of these is certain to give you a living in time.
And in that direction alone your happiness lies."</p>

<p>She leaned forward and kissed the girl's hair where it was fine
and blond, close to the snowy forehead.</p>

<p>"If war comes," she said, "you and James will have to go home,
like two good children when the curfew rings."</p>

<p>She laughed, pushed Rue away, lighted another cigarette, and,
casting a glance partly ironical, partly provocative, at the good-looking
young man on the sofa, said:</p>

<p>"As for you, James, I don't worry about you. Impudence will always
carry you through where diplomacy fails you. Now, tell me all
about these three unpleasant sporting characters who occupied
the train with you."</p>

<p>Neeland laughed.</p>

<p>"It seems that a well-known gambler in New York, called Captain
Quint, is backing them; and somebody higher up is backing Quint&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Probably the Turkish Embassy at Washington," interposed the
Princess, coolly. "I'm sorry, Jim; pray go on."</p>

<p>"The Turkish Embassy?" he repeated, surprised that she should
guess.</p>

<p>"Yes; and the German Embassy is backing that. There you are,
Jim. That is the sequence as far as your friend, Captain Quint.
Now, who comes next in the scale?"</p>

<p>"This man &mdash;Brandes&mdash;and the little chalk-faced creature,
Stull; and the other one, with the fox face &mdash;Doc Curfoot."</p>

<p>"I see. And then?"</p>

<p>"Then, as I gathered, there are several gentlemen wearing Teutonic
names&mdash;who are to go into partnership with them&mdash;one named Kestner,
one called Theodore Weishelm, and an exceedingly oily Eurasian
gentleman with whom I became acquainted on the <em>Volhynia</em>&mdash;one
Karl Breslau&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Breslau!" exclaimed the Princess. "<em>Now</em> I understand."</p>

<p>"Who is he, Princess?"</p>

<p>"He is the most notorious international spy in the world&mdash;a protean
individual with aliases, professions, and experiences sufficient
for an entire jail full of criminals. His father was a German
Jew; his mother a Circassian girl; he was educated in Germany,
France, Italy, and England. He has been a member of the socialist
group in the Reichstag under one name, a member of the British
Parliament under another; he did dirty work for Abdul Hamid; dirtier
for Enver Bey.</p>

<p>"He is here, there, everywhere; he turns up in Brazil one day,
and is next in evidence in Moscow. What he is so eternally about
God only knows: what Chancellery he serves, which he betrays,
is a question that occupies many uneasy minds this very hour,
I fancy.</p>

<p>"But of this I, personally, am now satisfied; Karl Breslau is
responsible for the robbery of your papers today, and the entire
affair was accomplished under his direction!"</p>

<p>"And yet I know," said Neeland, "that after he and Kestner tried
to blow up the captain's cabin and the bridge aboard the <em>Volhynia</em>
yesterday morning at a little after two o'clock, he and Kestner
must have jumped overboard in the Mersey River off Liverpool."</p>

<p>"Without doubt a boat was watching your ship."</p>

<p>"Yes; Weishelm had a fishing smack to pick them up. Ilse Dumont
must have gone with them, too."</p>

<p>"All they had to do was to touch at some dock, go ashore, and
telegraph to their men here," said the Princess.</p>

<p>"That, evidently, is what they did," admitted Neeland ruefully.</p>

<p>"Certainly. And by <em>this</em> time they may be here, too.
They could do it. I haven't any doubt that Breslau, Kestner, and
Ilse Dumont are here in Paris at this moment."</p>

<p>"Then I'll wager I know where they are!"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In the Hôtel des Bulgars, rue Vilna. That's where they are to
operate a gaming house. That is where they expect to pluck and
fleece the callow and the aged who may have anything of political
importance about them worth stealing. That is their plan. Agents,
officials, employees of all consulates, legations, and embassies
are what they're really after. I heard them discussing it there
in the train today."</p>

<p>The Princess had fallen very silent, musing, watching Neeland's
animated face as he detailed his knowledge of what had occurred.</p>

<p>"Why not notify the police?" he added. "There might be a chance
to recover the box and the papers."</p>

<p>The Princess shook her pretty head.</p>

<p>"We have to be very careful how we use the police, James. It
seems simple, but it is not. I can't explain the reasons, but
we usually pit spy against spy, and keep very clear of the police.
Otherwise," she added, smiling, "there would be the deuce to pay
among the embassies and legations." She added: "It's a most depressing
situation; I don't exactly know what to do.... I have letters
to write, anyway&#11834;"</p>

<p>She rose, turned to Rue and took both her hands:</p>

<p>"No; you must go back to New York and to your painting and music
if there is to be war in Europe. But you have had a taste of what
goes on in certain circles here; you have seen what a chain of
consequences ensue from a chance remark of a young girl at a dinner
table."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It's amusing, isn't it? A careless and innocent word to that
old busybody, Ahmed Mirka Pasha, at my table&mdash;that began it. Then
another word to Izzet Bey. And I had scarcely time to realise
what had happened&mdash;barely time to telegraph James in New York&mdash;before
their entire underground machinery was set in motion to seize
those wretched papers in Brookhollow!"</p>

<p>Neeland said:</p>

<p>"You don't know even yet, Princess, how amazingly fast that machinery
worked."</p>

<p>"Tell me now, James. I have time enough to write my warning since
it is already too late." And she seated herself on the sofa and
drew Ruhannah down beside her.</p>

<p>"Listen, dear," she said with pretty mockery, "here is a most
worthy young man who is simply dying to let us know how picturesque
a man can be when he tries to."</p>

<p>Neeland laughed:</p>

<p>"The only trouble with me," he retorted, "is that I've a rather
hopeless habit of telling the truth. Otherwise there'd be some
chance for me as a hero in what I'm going to tell you."</p>

<p>And he began with his first encounter with Ilse Dumont in Rue
Carew's house at Brookhollow. After he had been speaking for less
than a minute, Rue Carew's hands tightened in the clasp of the
Princess Naïa, who glanced at the girl and noticed that she had
lost her colour.</p>

<p>And Neeland continued his partly playful, partly serious narrative
of "moving accidents by flood and field," aware of the girl's
deep, breathless interest, moved by it, and, conscious of it,
the more inclined to avoid the picturesque and heroic, and almost
ashamed to talk of himself at all under the serious beauty of
the girl's clear eyes.</p>

<p>But he could scarcely tell his tale and avoid mentioning himself;
he was the centre of it all, the focus of the darts of Fate, and
there was no getting away from what happened to himself.</p>

<p>So he made the melodrama a comedy, and the moments of deadly
peril he treated lightly. And one thing he avoided altogether,
and that was how he had kissed Ilse Dumont.</p>

<p>When he finished his account of his dreadful situation in the
stateroom of Ilse Dumont, and how at the last second her unerring
shots had shattered the bomb clock, cut the guy-rope, and smashed
the water-jug which deluged the burning fuses, he added with a
very genuine laugh:</p>

<p>"If only some photographer had taken a few hundred feet of film
for me I could retire on an income in a year and never do another
stroke of honest work!"</p>

<p>The Princess smiled, mechanically, but Rue Carew dropped her
white face on the Princess Naïa's shoulder as though suddenly
fatigued.</p>
