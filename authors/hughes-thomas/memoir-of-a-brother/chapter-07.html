<p>At the time when my brother’s Harrow engagement came to an end,
I had just settled in a London house, and, to my great delight,
he proposed to come and live with us, and occupy our spare room
in Upper Berkeley Street. Besides all my other reasons for rejoicing
at this arrangement, which you may easily imagine for yourselves
when you have read thus far, there was a special one just at this
time, which I must now explain. The years 1848-9 had been years
of revolution, and, as always happens at such times, the minds
of men had been greatly stirred on many questions, and specially
on the problem of the social condition of the great mass of the
poor in all European countries. In Paris, the revolution had been
the signal for a great effort on the part of the workmen; and
some remarkable experiments had been made, both by the Provisional
Government of 1848, and by certain employers of labour, and bodies
of skilled mechanics, with a view to place the conditions of labour
upon a more equitable and satisfactory footing; or, to use the
common phrase of the day, to reconcile the interests of capital
and labour. The Government experiment of "national workshops"
had failed disastrously, but a number of the private associations
were brilliantly successful. The history of some of these associations—of
the sacrifices which had been joyfully made by the associates
in order to collect the small funds necessary to start them—of
the ability and industry with which they were conducted, and of
their marvellous effect on the habits of all those engaged in
the work—had deeply interested many persons in England. It was
resolved to try an experiment of the same kind here, but the conditions
were very different. The seed there had already taken root amongst
the industrial classes, and the movement had come from them. Here
the workpeople, as a rule, had no belief in association except
for defensive purposes. It was chiefly amongst young professional
men that the idea was working, and it was necessary to preach
it to those whom it most concerned. Accordingly a society was
formed, chiefly of young barristers, under the presidency of the
late Mr. Maurice, who was then Chaplain of Lincoln’s Inn, for
the purpose of establishing associations similar to those in Paris.
It was called the Society for Promoting Working Men’s Associations,
and I happened to be one of the original members, and on the Council.
We were all full of enthusiasm and hope in our work, and of propagandist
zeal: anxious to bring in all the recruits we could. I cannot
even now think of my own state of mind at the time without wonder
and amusement. I certainly thought (and for that matter have never
altered my opinion to this day) that here we had found the solution
of the great labour question; but I was also convinced that we
had nothing to do but just to announce it, and found an association
or two, in order to convert all England, and usher in the millennium
at once, so plain did the whole thing seem to me. I will not undertake
to answer for the rest of the Council, but I doubt whether I was
at all more sanguine than the majority. Consequently we went at
it with a will: held meetings at six o’clock in the morning (so
as not to interfere with our regular work) for settling the rules
of our central society, and its offshoots, and late in the evening,
for gathering tailors, shoemakers, and other handicraftsmen, whom
we might set to work; started a small publishing office, presided
over by a diminutive one-eyed costermonger, a rough and ready
speaker and poet (who had been in prison as a Chartist leader),
from which we issued tracts and pamphlets, and ultimately a small
newspaper; and, as the essential condition of any satisfactory
progress, commenced a vigorous agitation for such an amendment
in the law as would enable our infant Associations to carry on
their business in safety, and without hindrance. We very soon
had our hands full. Our denunciations of unlimited competition
brought on us attacks in newspapers and magazines, which we answered,
nothing loth. Our opponents called us Utopians and Socialists,
and we retorted that at any rate we were Christians; that our
trade principles were on all-fours with Christianity, while theirs
were utterly opposed to it. So we got, or adopted, the name of
Christian Socialists, and gave it to our tracts, and our paper.
We were ready to fight our battle wherever we found an opening,
and got support from the most unexpected quarters. I remember
myself being asked by Mr. Senior, an old friend of your grandfather,
to meet Archbishop Whately, and several eminent political economists,
and explain what we were about. After a couple of hours of hard
discussion, in which I have no doubt I talked much nonsense, I
retired, beaten, but quite unconvinced. Next day, the late Lord
Ashburton, who had been present, came to my chambers and gave
me a cheque for £50 to help our experiment; and a few days later
I found another nobleman, sitting on the counter of our shoemakers’
association, arguing with the manager, and giving an order for
boots.</p>

<p>It was just in the midst of all this that my brother came to
live with us. I had already converted him, as I thought. He was
a subscribing member of our Society, and dealt with our Associations;
and I had no doubt would now join the Council, and work actively
in the new crusade. I knew how sound his judgment was, and that
he never went back from a resolution once taken, and therefore
was all the more eager to make sure of him, and, as a step in
this direction, had already placed his name on committees, and
promised his attendance. But I was doomed to disappointment. He
attended one or two of our meetings, but I could not induce him
to take any active part with us. At a distance of twenty-two years
it is of course difficult to recall very accurately what passed
between us, but I can remember his reasons well enough to give
the substance of them. And first, as he had formerly objected
to the violent language of the leaders of the Anti-Corn-Law agitation,
so he now objected to what he looked upon as our extravagance.
"You don’t want to divide other people’s property?" "No." "Then
why call yourselves Socialists?" "But we couldn’t help ourselves:
other people called us so first." "Yes; but you needn’t have accepted
the name. Why acknowledge that the cap fitted?" "Well, it would
have been cowardly to back out. We borrow the ideas of these Frenchmen,
of association as opposed to competition as the true law of industry;
and of organizing labour—of securing the labourer’s position by
organizing production and consumption—and it would be cowardly
to shirk the name. It is only fools who know nothing about the
matter, or people interested in the competitive system of trade,
who believe, or say, that a desire to divide other people’s property
is of the essence of Socialism." "That may be very true: but nine-tenths
of mankind, or, at any rate, of Englishmen, come under one or
the other of those categories. If you are called Socialists, you
will never persuade the British public that this is not your object.
There was no need to take the name. You have weight enough to
carry already, without putting that on your shoulders." This was
his first objection, and he proved to be right. At any rate, after
some time we dropped the name, and turned the "Christian Socialist"
into the "Journal of Association." And English Socialists generally
have instinctively avoided it ever since, and called themselves
"co-operators," thereby escaping much abuse in the intervening
years. And, when I look back, I confess I do not wonder that we
repelled rather than attracted many men who, like my brother,
were inclined theoretically to agree with us. For I am bound to
admit that a strong vein of fanaticism and eccentricity ran through
our ranks, which the marvellous patience, gentleness, and wisdom
of our beloved president were not enough to counteract, or control.
Several of our most active and devoted members were also strong
vegetarians, and phonetists. In a generation when beards and wide-awakes
were looked upon as insults to decent society, some of us wore
both, with a most heroic indifference to public opinion. In the
same way, there was often a trenchant, and almost truculent, tone
about us, which was well calculated to keep men of my brother’s
temperament at a distance. I rather enjoyed it myself, but learnt
its unwisdom when I saw its effect on him, and others, who were
inclined to join us, and would have proved towers of strength.
It was right and necessary to denounce the evils of unlimited
competition, and the falsehood of the economic doctrine of "every
man for himself;" but quite unnecessary, and therefore unwise,
to speak of the whole system of trade as "the disgusting vice
of shop-keeping," as was the habit of several of our foremost
and ablest members.</p>

<p>But what really hindered my brother from taking an active share
in our work was not these eccentricities, which soon wore off,
and were, at the worst, superficial. When he came to look the
work fairly in the face, he found that he could not heartily sympathise
with it; and the quality of thoroughness in him, which your grandfather
notices, would not let him join half-heartedly. His conclusion
was reached somehow in this way: "It comes to this, then. What
you are all aiming at is, the complete overthrow of the present
trade system, and the substitution of what, you say, will prove
a more honest and righteous one. It is not simply a question of
setting up, and getting a legal status for, these half-dozen associations
of tailors and shoemakers, and these grocery stores. If the principle
is good for anything, it must spread everywhere, and into every
industrial process. It can’t live peaceably side by side with
the present system. They are absolutely antagonistic, and the
one must cast out the other. Isn’t that so?" I, of course, could
not deny the conclusion. "Well, then," his argument went on, "I
don’t see my way clearly enough to go on. Your principle I can’t
object to. It certainly seems truer, and stronger, and more in
accord with Christianity, than the other. But, after all, the
business of the world has always gone on upon the other, and the
world has had plenty of time to get to understand its own business.
You may say the results are not satisfactory, are proofs that
the world has done nothing but blunder. It may be so: but, after
all, experience must count for something, and the practical wear
and tear of centuries. Self-interest may be a low motive, but
the system founded upon it has managed somehow, with all its faults,
to produce a very tolerable kind of world. When yours comes to
be tried practically, just as great abuses may be found inseparable
from it. You may only get back the old evils under new forms.
The long and short of it is, I hate upsetting things, which seems
to be your main object. You say that you like to see people discontented
with society as it is, and are ready to help to make them so,
because it is full of injustice, and abuses of all kinds, and
will never be better till men are thoroughly discontented. I don’t
see these evils so strongly as you do; don’t believe in heroic
remedies; and would sooner see people contented, and making the
best of society as they find it. In fact, I was born and bred
a Tory, and can’t help it."</p>

<p>I remember it all very vividly, because it was a great grief
to me at the time, chiefly because I was very anxious to have
him with us; but, partly, because I had made so sure of getting
him that I had boasted of it to our Council, which included several
of our old school and college friends. They were delighted, knowing
what a valuable recruit he would prove, and now I had to make
the humiliating confession, that I had reckoned without my host.
He continued to pay his subscription, and to get his clothes at
our tailors’ association till it failed, which was more than some
of our number did, for the cut was so bad as to put the sternest
principles to a severe test. But I could see that this was done
out of kindness to me, and not from sympathy with what we were
doing.</p>

<p>But my disappointment had at least this good result, that it
opened my eyes thoroughly, and made me tolerant of opposition
to my own most earnest, and deepest, convictions. I have been
what I suppose would be called an advanced Liberal ever since
I was at Oxford, but have never been able to hate or despise the
old-fashioned Tory creed; for it was the creed of almost the kindest,
and bravest, and ablest man I have ever known intimately—my own
brother.</p>

<p>I must, however, add here, that he always watched with great
interest the social revolution in which he could not take an active
part. In 1851, the Industrial and Provident Societies’ Act, under
which the co-operative societies of different kinds first obtained
legal recognition, was passed, chiefly owing to the exertions
of Mr. Ludlow and other members of our old Council. There are
now more than 1,000 societies registered under that Act in England
alone, doing a yearly business of ten millions and owning property
of the amount of £2,500,000 and upwards; and as he saw the principle
spreading, and working practically, and, wherever it took root,
educating the people in self-control, and thrift, and independence,
he was far too good an Englishman not to rejoice at, and sympathise
with, the result, though I doubt whether he ever quite got over
the feeling of distrust and anxiety with which he regarded even
a peaceful, and apparently beneficent, revolution.</p>

<p>You all know how much I wish that you should take a thorough
and intelligent interest, and, in due time, an active part, in
public affairs. I don’t mean that you should adopt politics as
a profession, because, as matters stand in this country, poor
men, as most of you will be, are not able, as a rule, to do this
and retain their independence. But I want you to try to understand
politics, and to study important questions as they arise, so that
you may be always ready to support, with all the influence you
may happen to have, the measures and policy which you have satisfied
yourselves will be best for your country. Of course I should like
to see you all of my own way of thinking; but this is not at all
likely to happen, and I care comparatively little whether you
turn out Liberals or Tories, so that you take your sides conscientiously,
and hold to them through good and evil report; always remembering,
at the same time, that those who are most useful and powerful
in supporting a cause, are those who know best what can be said
against it; and that your opponents are just as likely to be upright
and honest men as yourselves, or those with whom you agree. My
brother’s example taught me this, and I hope it may do as much
for you.</p>

<p>There is a little poem of Lowell’s, which brings out so well
the contrast between the two forces constantly at work in human
affairs, and illustrates so beautifully the tempers which should
underlie all action in them, that I am sure you will thank me
for quoting it here. It is called "Above and Below:"—</p>

I.

</p>
<p>
O dwellers in the valley land,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who in deep twilight grope and cower,<br/>
Till the slow mountain’s dial-hand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortens to noon’s triumphant hour—<br/>
While ye sit idle, do ye think<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord’s great work sits idle too,<br/>
That light dare not o’erleap the brink<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of morn, because ’tis dark with you?

</p>
<p>
Though yet your valleys skulk in night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In God’s ripe fields the day is cried,<br/>
And reapers, with their sickles bright,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Troop, singing, down the mountain-side:<br/>
Come up, and feel what health there is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the frank Dawn’s delighted eyes,<br/>
As, bending with a pitying kiss,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The night-shed tears of earth she dries.

</p>
<p>
The Lord wants reapers: oh, mount up,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Night comes, and cries "Too late!"<br/>
Stay not for taking scrip or cup,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master hungers while ye wait;<br/>
’Tis from these heights alone your eyes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The advancing spears of day may see,<br/>
Which o’er the eastern hill-tops rise<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To break your long captivity.

II.

</p>
<p>
Lone watcher on the mountain height!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is right precious to behold<br/>
The first long surf of climbing light<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flood all the thirsty east with gold:<br/>
But we, who in the twilight sit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Know also that the day is nigh,<br/>
Seeing thy shining forehead lit<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his inspiring prophecy.

</p>
<p>
Thou hast thine office: we have ours:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;God lacks not early service here,<br/>
But what are thine eleventh hours<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He counts with us as morning cheer;<br/>
Our day for Him is long enough,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And when He giveth work to do,<br/>
The bruisèd reed is amply tough<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To pierce the shield of error through.

</p>
<p>
But not the less do thou aspire<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Light’s earlier messages to teach,<br/>
Keep back no syllable of fire—<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunge deep the rowels of thy speech.<br/>
Yet God deems not thine aëried flight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More worthy than our twilight dim—<br/>
For brave obedience, too, is Light,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And following that is finding Him.
