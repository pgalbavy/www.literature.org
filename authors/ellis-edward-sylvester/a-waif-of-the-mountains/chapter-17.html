<p>The parson expressed his disappointment in vigorous language,
when, instead of the horses, the hybrids proved to be the only
animals near them.</p>

<p>"I am afraid this proves one thing," he said.</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"I have had a dread all along that the Indians would run off
the horses, but it seems to me that if they had done so, they
would have taken the mules."</p>

<p>"It strikes me as more likely that the leftenant took the horses,
so as to prevent our follering him and the gal."</p>

<p>"That sounds reasonable," said the parson thoughtfully; "the
plan is so simple that it must have occurred to him. The mules
are too slow to be of any use to us, and it may be as well that
we shall have to go afoot."</p>

<p>"How do you figure that out?"</p>

<p>"They will conclude that, if we haven't any horses, we won't
follow them; they will, therefore, take their time and travel
so slow, that we'll have the chance to swoop down on them when
they are not expecting it."</p>

<p>"I s'pose there's what you call philosophy in that, but it doesn't
hit me very favorable. We'll see what the cap thinks&mdash;helloa!"</p>

<p>Clearly and distinctly through the still air came the signal
by which Captain Dawson was to announce his discovery of the animals.
The call scattered all thoughts of making the journey on foot,
and, wheeling about, the two started off at a rapid pace to join
their friend. At the same moment the call sounded again, and they
answered it to let it be known they understood the situation.
In a brief time they came upon Captain Dawson impatiently awaiting
them. There was no need for him to tell them he had been successful
in his search, for he was standing beside the three horses, which
were quickly saddled and bridled. A minute later the men vaulted
upon their backs and the captain said crisply:</p>

<p>"Now we are off!"</p>

<p>Each seemed to be inspired by the spirit of adventure. They sat
erect in the saddles, drew in a deep inhalation of the keen night
air, and moved off with their horses on a brisk walk, which almost
immediately became a canter. For a mile, the trail through Dead
Man's Gulch was nearly as hard and even as a country highway.
The width of the cañon varied from a few rods to a quarter of
a mile, with the mountain ridges on either hand towering far up
into cloudland, the tallest peaks crowned with snow which the
sun never dissolved.</p>

<p>The tiny stream wound like a silvery serpent through the stretch
of green, succulent grass, narrowing gorge and obtruding rock
and boulder. Now and then the path led across the water, which
was so shallow that it only plashed about the fetlocks of the
horses. Captain Dawson, in his impetuosity, kept a few paces in
front of the other two, as if he were the leader. When the space
increased too much he reined up his animal and waited until his
friends joined him. They were grim, resolute and for most of the
time had little to say to one another, though, as may be supposed,
their thoughts were of anything but a pleasant nature.</p>

<p>So long as the moon held her place near the zenith, the cañon
was suffused and flooded with its soft radiance, but the rifts
of clouds drifting before its face rendered the light at times
treacherous and uncertain. The horses had rested so long, and
had had such extensive browsing on the rich pasturage, that they
were in fine condition, and the gallop seemed more grateful to
them than an ordinary walking gait. The air was cool and the fine
trail, at this portion of the journey, made all the conditions
favorable. After a time however, the ascent and descent would
appear, the ground would become rough and the best the animals
could do would be to walk.</p>

<p>When Parson Brush remarked that Lieutenant Russell had proved
himself an idiot when he left these horses behind for his pursuers
to use, the captain and Ruggles agreed with him.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it," said Brush; "he must have expected we
would be hot after him, within the very hour we learned of what
he had done, or can it be that he and she concluded we would say,
'Depart in peace?' If so, the young man shall have a terrible
awakening."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Ruggles, "that it is more likely he believed
that with the start he would gain, it didn't matter whether we
follered or not, feelin' sure that he could keep out of reach
and get to Sacramento so fur ahead of us, that he needn't give
us a thought."</p>

<p>"I am not very familiar with the trail," remarked the captain,
"for, as you know, I have passed over it only twice; first, nearly
five years ago, when I went to the war, and a few months since
when I came back."</p>

<p>"But you and Russell did not lose your way," said the parson.</p>

<p>"That was because we did our traveling by day. We tried it once
at night, but came within a hair of tumbling over a precipice
a thousand feet deep. This will be easy enough, so long as we
have the sun to help us."</p>

<p>"You probably know as much about the trail as Wade and I, for
neither of us has been over it often. Consequently, when we travel
by night, we shall have to go it blind, or rather shall do so
after awhile, since all is plain sailing now."</p>

<p>"I ain't so sure of that," observed Ruggles doubtfully; "we must
have come a mile already and ought to have made a turn by this
time."</p>

<p>Captain Dawson checked his horse and peered ahead.</p>

<p>"Can it be we are off the track? We have come nearer two miles
than one&mdash;ah!"</p>

<p>Just then the moon emerged from the obscuring clouds and their
field of vision so broadened that they saw themselves face to
face with an impassable barrier. The cañon closed directly in
front of them like an immense gate of stone. It was impossible
to advance a hundred feet further.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blessed if this isn't a pretty situation!" exclaimed
the captain.</p>

<p>"We have passed the opening, but we haven't far to return, and
you know that a bad beginning brings a good ending."</p>

<p>"Humph! I would rather chance it on a good beginning."</p>

<p>Ruggles was the first to wheel and strike his horse into a gallop,
which he did with the remark that he knew where the right passage
was located. His companions were almost beside him. The cañon
was of that peculiar conformation that, while it terminated directly
in front, it contained an abrupt angle between where the party
had halted and the mining settlement. At that point it was so
wide that the little stream, which might have served for a guide,
was lost sight of. Had they followed the brook, they would not
have gone astray. The only inconvenience was the slight delay,
which in their restless mood tried their spirits to the utmost.
Captain Dawson muttered to himself and urged his horse so angrily
that he again placed himself in advance. His mood was no more
savage than that of his companions, but he chafed at everything
which caused delay, no matter how trifling, in the pursuit.</p>

<p>Fearing that he might go wrong, Ruggles spurred up beside him.
The distance passed was less than any one expected it to be, when
Ruggles called out:</p>

<p>"Here we are!"</p>

<p>The exclamation was caused by the hoofs of their horses plashing
in the water. They seemed to share the impatience of their riders;
"all we have to do now is to keep to the stream; obsarve its turn."</p>

<p>Its course was almost at right angles to that which they had
been following. The animals were cantering easily, when suddenly
a deeper gloom than usual overspread the valley like a pall. This
came from a heavy bank of clouds sweeping before the moon. The
steeds were drawn down to a walk, but the obscurity was not dense
enough to shut out the chasm-like opening, where the mountains
seemed to part, riven by some terrific convulsion ages before.
The enormous walls drew back the door as if to invite them to
enter and press the pursuit of the couple that were fleeing from
a just and righteous wrath.</p>

<p>The width of the cañon had now dwindled to a few yards, and the
stream expanding and shallow, occupied so much of the space that
the horses were continually splashing through it, but the rise
and fall of the trail was so slight that the gallop might have
continued with little danger of mishap.</p>

<p>The formation of the party was in "Indian file," with Captain
Dawson leading, Ruggles next and Brush bringing up the rear. All
three animals were walking, for the light of the moon was variable
and often faint, while the danger of a mis-step was ever present,
and was likely to bring a fatal ending of the pursuit almost before
it had fairly begun. Occasionally the gloom in the narrow gorge
was so deep that they distinguished one another's figures indistinctly,
but the animals were left mostly to themselves. They seemed to
know what was expected of them and showed no hesitation. It was
impossible for them to go wrong, for it was much the same as if
crossing a bridge, with its protecting barrier on either hand.
The horse of the captain showed his self-confidence once or twice
by a faint whinney and a break from the walk into a trot, but
his rider checked him.</p>

<p>"Not yet; heaven knows that I am as anxious to push on as you,
but we have already made one blunder and we can't afford another;
when the time comes that it is safe to trot you shall do so and
perhaps run."</p>

<p>"Hush!" called Brush from the rear; "I hear a curious sound."</p>

<p>"What does it seem to be?"</p>

<p>"It is impossible to tell; let's stop for a moment."</p>

<p>As the three animals stood motionless, the strange noise was
audible. It was a deep, hollow roar rapidly increasing in volume
and intensity, and resembled the warning of a tornado or cyclone
advancing through the forest. The animals, as is the case at such
times, were nervous and frightened. They elevated their heads,
pricked their ears, snuffed the air and the animal of the parson
trembled with terror.</p>

<p>The three believed that something in the nature of a cyclone
was approaching, or it might be a cloudburst several miles away,
whose deluge had swollen the stream into a rushing torrent that
would overwhelm them where they stood, caught inextricably in
a trap.</p>

<p>The terrifying roar, however, was neither in front nor at the
rear, but above them,&mdash;over their heads! From the first warning
to the end was but a few seconds. The sound increased with appalling
power and every eye was instinctively turned upward.</p>

<p>In the dim obscurity they saw a dark mass of rock, weighing hundreds
of tons, descending like a prodigious meteor, hurled from the
heavens. It had been loosened on the mountain crest a half mile
above, and was plunging downward with inconceivable momentum.
Striking some obstruction, it rebounded like a rubber ball against
the opposite side of the gorge, then recoiled, still diving downward,
oscillating like a pendulum from wall to wall, whirling with increasing
speed until it crashed to the bottom of the gorge with a shock
so terrific that the earth and mountain trembled.</p>

<p>Landing in the stream, the water was flung like bird shot right
and left, stinging the faces of the men fifty feet distant. They
sat awed and silent until Ruggles spoke:</p>

<p>"Now if that stone had hit one of us on the head it would have
hurt."</p>

<p>"Probably it would," replied the captain, who had difficulty
in quieting his horse; "at any rate, I hope no more of them will
fall till we are out of the way."</p>

<p>"I wonder whether that could have been done on purpose," remarked
the parson.</p>

<p>"No," said Ruggles; "the leftenant couldn't know anything about
our being purty near the right spot to catch it."</p>

<p>"I alluded to Indians,&mdash;not to him."</p>

<p>But Ruggles and the captain did not deem such a thing credible.
A whole tribe of red men could not have loosened so enormous a
mass of stone, while, if poised as delicately as it must have
been, they would have known nothing of the fact. Sometimes an
immense oak, sound and apparently as firm as any in the forest
around it, suddenly plunges downward and crashes to the earth,
from no imaginable cause. So, vast masses of rock on the mountain
side which have held their places for centuries, seem to leap
from their foundations and tear their way with resistless force
into the valley below. This was probably one of those accidental
displacements, liable to occur at any hour of the day or night,
which had come so startlingly near crushing the three men to death.</p>

<p>Captain Dawson drew a match from his pocket and scraping it along
his thigh, held it to the face of his watch.</p>

<p>"Just midnight and we are not more than half a dozen miles from
home."</p>

<p>"And how far do you suppose <em>they</em> are?" asked the parson.</p>

<p>"Probably five times as much, if not more."</p>

<p>"But they will not travel at night, and by sunrise we ought to
be considerably nearer to them than now."</p>

<p>"You can't be certain about that. Lieutenant Russell knows me
too well to loiter on the road; he has a good horse and the pony
of Nellie is a tough animal; both will be urged to the utmost;
for they must be sure the pursuit will be a hard one."</p>

<p>The discomforting fact in the situation was that if the fugitives,
as they may be considered, pushed their flight with vigor, there
was no reason why they should not prevent any lessening of the
distance between them and their pursuers, and since they would
naturally fear pursuit, it was to be expected that they would
use all haste. The hope was that on account of Nellie, the animals
would not keep up the flight for so many hours out of the twenty-four,
as the pursuers would maintain it.</p>

<p>The trail steadily ascended and became so rough and uneven that
the horses frequently stumbled. This made their progress slow
and compelled the three men, despite themselves, to feel the prudence
of resting until daylight, but not one of them wished to do so,
since the night pursuit was the only phase of the business which
brought with it the belief that they were really lessening the
distance separating them from the two in advance.</p>

<p>Eager as the couple were to get through the mountains and reach
Sacramento, where for the first time they could feel safe from
their pursuers, the young officer was too wise to incur the risk
of breaking down their horses, for such a mishap would be a most
serious one indeed, and fraught with fatal consequences.</p>

<p>There was little fear of the pursuers going astray. Captain Dawson
had an extraordinary memory for places, as he repeatedly proved
by recalling some landmark that he had noticed on his previous
trip. Furthermore, the gorge was so narrow that in a certain sense,
it may be said, they were fenced in, and would have found it hard
to wander to the right or left, had they made the effort.</p>

<p>After an hour of steady climbing they reached an altitude which
brought with it a sharp change of temperature. The air became
so chilly that Ruggles and Brush flung their blankets about their
shoulders and found the protection added to their comfort. The
horses, too, began to show the effects of their severe exertion.
Their long rest had rendered them somewhat "soft," though the
hardening would be rapid. After a few days' work they would not
mind such exertion as that to which they were now forced.</p>

<p>When a sort of amphitheatre was reached, it was decided to draw
rein for a brief while, out of sympathy for their panting animals.</p>

<p>"I thought if we failed to find our horses," remarked the parson,
"we wouldn't find it hard to keep up the pursuit on foot; I have
changed my mind."</p>

<p>He looked back over the sloping trail, which speedily vanished
in the gloom and the eyes of the other two were turned in the
same direction. At the moment of doing so, the animals again became
frightened, so that, despite their fatigue, it was hard to restrain
them.</p>

<p>"There's something down there," remarked the captain slipping
from his saddle; "Wade, you are the nearest, can you see anything?"</p>

<p>Ruggles was out of the saddle in an instant, Winchester in hand.</p>

<p>"I catched sight of something," he said in an undertone; "look
after my horse, while I find out what it is."</p>

<p>"Have a care," cautioned the parson; "it may be an Indian."</p>

<p>"That's what I think it is," replied Ruggles, who instantly started
down the trail rifle in hand, his posture a crouching one and
his senses strung to the highest point.</p>

<p>He passed from view almost on the instant, and his companions
listened with intense anxiety for what was to follow. Suddenly
the sharp crack of their friend's rifle rang out in the solemn
stillness, the report echoing again and again through the gorge,
with an effect that was startling even to such experienced men.
It was the only sound that came to them, and, while they were
wondering what it meant, Ruggles reappeared among them with the
noiselessness of a shadow.</p>

<p>"It was a bear," he explained; "I think he scented the animals
and was follering on the lookout for a chance at 'em."</p>

<p>"Did you kill him?"</p>

<p>"Don't think I did; he must have heard me comin' and was scared;
he went down the trail faster than I could; when I seen that I
couldn't catch him, I let fly without taking much aim. Maybe I
hit him; leastways, he traveled so much faster that I give it
up and come back."</p>

<p>The party lingered for half an hour more, but as the horses showed
no further fear, they concluded that bruin had taken to heart
the lesson he received and would bother them no further.</p>

<p>The mountains still towered on every hand. The stream had long
since disappeared among the rocks and the gorge had become narrower.
Generally it was no more than a dozen feet in width, occasionally
expanding to two or three times that extent. The moon had moved
over so far that only its faint reflection against the dark walls
and masses of rock availed the horsemen. The sky seemed to contain
an increasing number of clouds and there were indications of a
storm, which might not break for a day or two, and as likely as
not would not break at all.</p>

<p>The traveling, despite its difficulty, was comparatively safe.
The trail did not lead along the sides of precipices, with a climbing
wall on one side and a continuous descent on the other, but it
was solid and extended across from one ridge to the other. Because
of this fact the three pushed their animals hard, knowing that
it would not be long before they would have to be favored.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether we are wise to keep this up as we are doing,"
said the captain, "but I know there are few places where we can
travel in the darkness and I feel like making the most of them."</p>

<p>"It is only a question of what the horses are able to stand,"
replied Brush; "it is easy enough for us to ride, but a very different
thing for them to carry us. We must guard against their breaking
down."</p>

<p>"I will look out for that, but it is strange that when we were
making ready to start we forgot one important matter."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"We did not bring a mouthful of food."</p>

<p>"We shall have little trouble in shooting what game we need."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not and perhaps we shall. The lieutenant and I found
on our way from Sacramento that, although game appeared to be
plenty, it had an exasperating habit of keeping out of range when
we particularly needed it. Delay will be necessary to get food,
and the reports of our guns are likely to give warning, just when
it is dangerous."</p>

<p>"It was a bad slip," assented the parson; "for there was plenty
of meat and bread at home; but we shall have to stop now and then
to rest our animals and to allow them to feed and we can utilize
such intervals by getting something for ourselves in the same
line."</p>

<p>"It isn't that, so much as the risk of apprising the two of their
danger. In addition, it will be strange if we get through the
mountains without a fight with the Indians. According to my recollection,
we shall strike a region to-morrow or on the next day, where there
will be the mischief to pay."</p>

<p>Two miles more of laborious work and another halt. For the first
time Parson Brush showed excitement.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said, "that some one is following us? There
may be several, but I am sure of one at least and he is on a horse."</p>
