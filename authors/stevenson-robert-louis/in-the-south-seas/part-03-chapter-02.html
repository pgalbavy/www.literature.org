<p>The kingdom of Tebureimoa includes two islands, Great and Little Makin;
some two thousand subjects pay him tribute, and two semi-independent
chieftains do him qualified homage.  The importance of the office is
measured by the man; he may be a nobody, he may be absolute; and both
extremes have been exemplified within the memory of residents.
</p>
<p>On the death of king Tetimararoa, Tebureimoa’s father, Nakaeia, the
eldest son, succeeded.  He was a fellow of huge physical strength,
masterful, violent, with a certain barbaric thrift and some intelligence
of men and business.  Alone in his islands, it was he who dealt and
profited; he was the planter and the merchant; and his subjects toiled
for his behoof in servitude.  When they wrought long and well their
taskmaster declared a holiday, and supplied and shared a general debauch.
The scale of his providing was at times magnificent; six hundred dollars’
worth of gin and brandy was set forth at once; the narrow land resounded
with the noise of revelry: and it was a common thing to see the subjects
(staggering themselves) parade their drunken sovereign on the fore-hatch
of a wrecked vessel, king and commons howling and singing as they went.
At a word from Nakaeia’s mouth the revel ended; Makin became once more an
isle of slaves and of teetotalers; and on the morrow all the population
must be on the roads or in the taro-patches toiling under his bloodshot
eye.
</p><p>The fear of Nakaeia filled the land.  No regularity of justice was
affected; there was no trial, there were no officers of the law; it seems
there was but one penalty, the capital; and daylight assault and midnight
murder were the forms of process.  The king himself would play the
executioner: and his blows were dealt by stealth, and with the help and
countenance of none but his own wives.  These were his oarswomen; one
that caught a crab, he slew incontinently with the tiller; thus
disciplined, they pulled him by night to the scene of his vengeance,
which he would then execute alone and return well-pleased with his
connubial crew.  The inmates of the harem held a station hard for us to
conceive.  Beasts of draught, and driven by the fear of death, they were
yet implicitly trusted with their sovereign’s life; they were still wives
and queens, and it was supposed that no man should behold their faces.
They killed by the sight like basilisks; a chance view of one of those
boatwomen was a crime to be wiped out with blood.  In the days of Nakaeia
the palace was beset with some tall coco-palms which commanded the
enclosure.  It chanced one evening, while Nakaeia sat below at supper
with his wives, that the owner of the grove was in a tree-top drawing
palm-tree wine; it chanced that he looked down, and the king at the same
moment looking up, their eyes encountered.  Instant flight preserved the
involuntary criminal.  But during the remainder of that reign he must
lurk and be hid by friends in remote parts of the isle; Nakaeia hunted
him without remission, although still in vain; and the palms, accessories
to the fact, were ruthlessly cut down.  Such was the ideal of wifely
purity in an isle where nubile virgins went naked as in paradise.  And
yet scandal found its way into Nakaeia’s well-guarded harem.  He was at
that time the owner of a schooner, which he used for a pleasure-house,
lodging on board as she lay anchored; and thither one day he summoned a
new wife.  She was one that had been sealed to him; that is to say (I
presume), that he was married to her sister, for the husband of an elder
sister has the call of the cadets.  She would be arrayed for the
occasion; she would come scented, garlanded, decked with fine mats and
family jewels, for marriage, as her friends supposed; for death, as she
well knew.  ‘Tell me the man’s name, and I will spare you,’ said Nakaeia.
But the girl was staunch; she held her peace, saved her lover and the
queens strangled her between the mats.
</p><p>Nakaeia was feared; it does not appear that he was hated.  Deeds that
smell to us of murder wore to his subjects the reverend face of justice;
his orgies made him popular; natives to this day recall with respect the
firmness of his government; and even the whites, whom he long opposed and
kept at arm’s-length, give him the name (in the canonical South Sea
phrase) of ‘a perfect gentleman when sober.’
</p><p>When he came to lie, without issue, on the bed of death, he summoned his
next brother, Nanteitei, made him a discourse on royal policy, and warned
him he was too weak to reign.  The warning was taken to heart, and for
some while the government moved on the model of Nakaeia’s.  Nanteitei
dispensed with guards, and walked abroad alone with a revolver in a
leather mail-bag.  To conceal his weakness he affected a rude silence;
you might talk to him all day; advice, reproof, appeal, and menace alike
remained unanswered.
</p><p>The number of his wives was seventeen, many of them heiresses; for the
royal house is poor, and marriage was in these days a chief means of
buttressing the throne.  Nakaeia kept his harem busy for himself;
Nanteitei hired it out to others.  In his days, for instance, Messrs.
Wightman built a pier with a verandah at the north end of the town.  The
masonry was the work of the seventeen queens, who toiled and waded there
like fisher lasses; but the man who was to do the roofing durst not begin
till they had finished, lest by chance he should look down and see them.
</p><p>It was perhaps the last appearance of the harem gang.  For some time
already Hawaiian missionaries had been seated at Butaritari—Maka and
Kanoa, two brave childlike men.  Nakaeia would none of their doctrine; he
was perhaps jealous of their presence; being human, he had some affection
for their persons.  In the house, before the eyes of Kanoa, he slew with
his own hand three sailors of Oahu, crouching on their backs to knife
them, and menacing the missionary if he interfered; yet he not only
spared him at the moment, but recalled him afterwards (when he had fled)
with some expressions of respect.  Nanteitei, the weaker man, fell more
completely under the spell.  Maka, a light-hearted, lovable, yet in his
own trade very rigorous man, gained and improved an influence on the king
which soon grew paramount.  Nanteitei, with the royal house, was publicly
converted; and, with a severity which liberal missionaries disavow, the
harem was at once reduced.  It was a compendious act.  The throne was
thus impoverished, its influence shaken, the queen’s relatives mortified,
and sixteen chief women (some of great possessions) cast in a body on the
market.  I have been shipmates with a Hawaiian sailor who was
successively married to two of these <u>impromptu</u> widows, and successively
divorced by both for misconduct.  That two great and rich ladies (for
both of these were rich) should have married ‘a man from another island’
marks the dissolution of society.  The laws besides were wholly
remodelled, not always for the better.  I love Maka as a man; as a
legislator he has two defects: weak in the punishment of crime, stern to
repress innocent pleasures.
</p><p>War and revolution are the common successors of reform; yet Nanteitei
died (of an overdose of chloroform), in quiet possession of the throne,
and it was in the reign of the third brother, Nabakatokia, a man brave in
body and feeble of character, that the storm burst.  The rule of the high
chiefs and notables seems to have always underlain and perhaps alternated
with monarchy.  The Old Men (as they were called) have a right to sit
with the king in the Speak House and debate: and the king’s chief
superiority is a form of closure—‘The Speaking is over.’  After the long
monocracy of Nakaeia and the changes of Nanteitei, the Old Men were
doubtless grown impatient of obscurity, and they were beyond question
jealous of the influence of Maka.  Calumny, or rather caricature, was
called in use; a spoken cartoon ran round society; Maka was reported to
have said in church that the king was the first man in the island and
himself the second; and, stung by the supposed affront, the chiefs broke
into rebellion and armed gatherings.  In the space of one forenoon the
throne of Nakaeia was humbled in the dust.  The king sat in the maniap’
before the palace gate expecting his recruits; Maka by his side, both
anxious men; and meanwhile, in the door of a house at the north entry of
the town, a chief had taken post and diverted the succours as they came.
They came singly or in groups, each with his gun or pistol slung about
his neck.  ‘Where are you going?’ asked the chief.  ‘The king called us,’
they would reply.  ‘Here is your place.  Sit down,’ returned the chief.
With incredible disloyalty, all obeyed; and sufficient force being thus
got together from both sides, Nabakatokia was summoned and surrendered.
About this period, in almost every part of the group, the kings were
murdered; and on Tapituea, the skeleton of the last hangs to this day in
the chief Speak House of the isle, a menace to ambition.  Nabakatokia was
more fortunate; his life and the royal style were spared to him, but he
was stripped of power.  The Old Men enjoyed a festival of public
speaking; the laws were continually changed, never enforced; the commons
had an opportunity to regret the merits of Nakaeia; and the king, denied
the resource of rich marriages and the service of a troop of wives, fell
not only in disconsideration but in debt.
</p><p>He died some months before my arrival on the islands, and no one
regretted him; rather all looked hopefully to his successor.  This was by
repute the hero of the family.  Alone of the four brothers, he had issue,
a grown son, Natiata, and a daughter three years old; it was to him, in
the hour of the revolution, that Nabakatokia turned too late for help;
and in earlier days he had been the right hand of the vigorous Nakaeia.
Nontemat’, <u>Mr. Corpse</u>, was his appalling nickname, and he had earned it
well.  Again and again, at the command of Nakaeia, he had surrounded
houses in the dead of night, cut down the mosquito bars and butchered
families.  Here was the hand of iron; here was Nakaeia <u>redux</u>.  He came,
summoned from the tributary rule of Little Makin: he was installed, he
proved a puppet and a trembler, the unwieldy shuttlecock of orators; and
the reader has seen the remains of him in his summer parlour under the
name of Tebureimoa.
</p><p>The change in the man’s character was much commented on in the island,
and variously explained by opium and Christianity.  To my eyes, there
seemed no change at all, rather an extreme consistency.  Mr. Corpse was
afraid of his brother: King Tebureimoa is afraid of the Old Men.  Terror
of the first nerved him for deeds of desperation; fear of the second
disables him for the least act of government.  He played his part of
bravo in the past, following the line of least resistance, butchering
others in his own defence: to-day, grown elderly and heavy, a convert, a
reader of the Bible, perhaps a penitent, conscious at least of
accumulated hatreds, and his memory charged with images of violence and
blood, he capitulates to the Old Men, fuddles himself with opium, and
sits among his guards in dreadful expectation.  The same cowardice that
put into his hand the knife of the assassin deprives him of the sceptre
of a king.
</p><p>A tale that I was told, a trifling incident that fell in my observation,
depicts him in his two capacities.  A chief in Little Makin asked, in an
hour of lightness, ‘Who is Kaeia?’  A bird carried the saying; and
Nakaeia placed the matter in the hands of a committee of three.  Mr.
Corpse was chairman; the second commissioner died before my arrival; the
third was yet alive and green, and presented so venerable an appearance
that we gave him the name of Abou ben Adhem.  Mr. Corpse was troubled
with a scruple; the man from Little Makin was his adopted brother; in
such a case it was not very delicate to appear at all, to strike the blow
(which it seems was otherwise expected of him) would be worse than
awkward.  ‘I will strike the blow,’ said the venerable Abou; and Mr.
Corpse (surely with a sigh) accepted the compromise.  The quarry was
decoyed into the bush; he was set to carrying a log; and while his arms
were raised Abou ripped up his belly at a blow.  Justice being thus done,
the commission, in a childish horror, turned to flee.  But their victim
recalled them to his side.  ‘You need not run away now,’ he said.  ‘You
have done this thing to me.  Stay.’  He was some twenty minutes dying,
and his murderers sat with him the while: a scene for Shakespeare.  All
the stages of a violent death, the blood, the failing voice, the
decomposing features, the changed hue, are thus present in the memory of
Mr. Corpse; and since he studied them in the brother he betrayed, he has
some reason to reflect on the possibilities of treachery.  I was never
more sure of anything than the tragic quality of the king’s thoughts; and
yet I had but the one sight of him at unawares.  I had once an errand for
his ear.  It was once more the hour of the siesta; but there were
loiterers abroad, and these directed us to a closed house on the bank of
the canal where Tebureimoa lay unguarded.  We entered without ceremony,
being in some haste.  He lay on the floor upon a bed of mats, reading in
his Gilbert Island Bible with compunction.  On our sudden entrance the
unwieldy man reared himself half-sitting so that the Bible rolled on the
floor, stared on us a moment with blank eyes, and, having recognised his
visitors, sank again upon the mats.  So Eglon looked on Ehud.
</p><p>The justice of facts is strange, and strangely just; Nakaeia, the author
of these deeds, died at peace discoursing on the craft of kings; his tool
suffers daily death for his enforced complicity.  Not the nature, but the
congruity of men’s deeds and circumstances damn and save them; and
Tebureimoa from the first has been incongruously placed.  At home, in a
quiet bystreet of a village, the man had been a worthy carpenter, and,
even bedevilled as he is, he shows some private virtues.  He has no
lands, only the use of such as are impignorate for fines; he cannot
enrich himself in the old way by marriages; thrift is the chief pillar of
his future, and he knows and uses it.  Eleven foreign traders pay him a
patent of a hundred dollars, some two thousand subjects pay capitation at
the rate of a dollar for a man, half a dollar for a woman, and a shilling
for a child: allowing for the exchange, perhaps a total of three hundred
pounds a year.  He had been some nine months on the throne: had bought
his wife a silk dress and hat, figure unknown, and himself a uniform at
three hundred dollars; had sent his brother’s photograph to be enlarged
in San Francisco at two hundred and fifty dollars; had greatly reduced
that brother’s legacy of debt and had still sovereigns in his pocket.  An
affectionate brother, a good economist; he was besides a handy carpenter,
and cobbled occasionally on the woodwork of the palace.  It is not
wonderful that Mr. Corpse has virtues; that Tebureimoa should have a
diversion filled me with surprise.
