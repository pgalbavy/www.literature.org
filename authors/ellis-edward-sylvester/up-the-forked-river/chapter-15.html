<p>Suddenly her plodding pony stood still, with a slight neigh and
ears erect. They were at that moment winding around the face of
a precipice, with the wall on the left rising to a height of a
hundred feet or more, and sloping downward on the right into a
gorge of Stygian blackness. The path was a yard or over in width,
so there was plenty of foothold, and the halt could not be due
to any lack of that nature.</p>

<p>The guide was motionless, a dozen paces in advance. Something
seemed to have caught his notice and caused him to hesitate. Peering
beyond his head in the vivid moonlight, Miss Starland discerned
a crouching form, lithe and sinewy, and resembling a huge hound.
It had been approaching from the opposite direction, when it was
checked by sight of the man. A growl pierced the stillness, as
it stood lashing its sides with its long tail. Then it began inching
forward with intent to attack the obstacle in its path. The latter
maintained his stationary pose, but at sight of the beast stealthily
creeping upon him, he raised his gun to his shoulder, took a quick
aim and fired.</p>

<p>[Illustration: AN <em>OBSTACLE IN THE PATH</em>.]</p>

<p>The space was short and the shot sped true. Upon receiving the
bullet, the beast emitted a rasping screech and leaped directly
upward, as if impelled from a springboard, and falling on its
side, rolled over the edge of the precipice, down which it sped,
clawing, snarling and bringing the loose dirt streaming after
it, until it vanished in the gloomy depths and all became as it
was before.</p>

<p>The soldier coolly reloaded his gun, without stirring from his
position, turned his head and said in a conversational tone: "Come
on; all is well." Then he resumed his walk, and the pony of Miss
Starland, as if all had been clear to him from the first, plodded
onward.</p>

<p>"Do you know what that animal was?" called the Señorita from
the rear.</p>

<p>"How should I know anything about him?"</p>

<p>"It was a jaguar."</p>

<p>"Said to be one of the most dangerous animals of your country."</p>

<p>"I hope you have no fear of that particular one."</p>

<p>"No, but there must be others."</p>

<p>"They are not plentiful in these mountains; at any rate, the
guide will take good care of you."</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the procession began descending the trail,
which broadened and was partly hidden by undergrowth and trees,
that lined the sides and overshadowed the party at intervals.
Several times Miss Starland had heard an odd chattering, which
she could not identify, but which did not disturb the others.
This showed that the soldiers understood and so long as that was
the case, she need not be disturbed in mind.</p>

<p>In the lowest part of the valley-like depression, where she could
catch only dim glimpses of her guide, she was dreadfully startled
by an object alighting like a feather on her horse directly in
front. It was so close that she instantly saw it was a monkey,
which in pure mischief had dropped from one of the branches and
perched itself on the shoulders of the pony. Looking round at
her it chattered and seemed on the point of climbing upon her
head when she struck it so sharp a cuff that it toppled over sideways
from the horse upon the trail, down which it went clawing and
chattering its anger; but, though, it dropped from sight, it must
be believed it suffered no harm, because of its own nimbleness.</p>

<p>Her friend saw enough to understand what had taken place and
called out:</p>

<p>"I hope you are not frightened, Warrenia; the little fellow meant
no harm."</p>

<p>"But I do not wish his company; you are welcome to it."</p>

<p>"I care little either way, but they are revengeful, and when
you cuff the next one's ears, don't do it too hard, or it may
rouse the others to attack you; heigho! here's another!" exclaimed
the Señorita, as one of the agile creatures bounded from somewhere
upon her horse and whisked out of sight again.</p>

<p>A soft murmur stole through the night, and gradually increased
in depth of volume, until when the party rounded a bend in the
trail, they came upon the cause. To the right and a hundred feet
above them, a sheet of crystalline water poured over the edge
of the rocks and tumbled into the valley below, whence it wound
its course to the Rio Rubio, only a short distance away. The falls
were twenty feet in width, with a descent perhaps twice as great,
and in the moonlight they looked like a motionless sheen of silver,
which might have been believed to be the case but for the churning
of the snowy foam below. From this a fleecy mist was continually
ascending, and a little way above, it displayed a faint rainbow,
whose exquisitely delicate beauty caused an exclamation of delight
from the visitor who saw the picture for the first time in her
life.</p>

<p>But to the escort it was a familiar sight, and they gave it only
a glance, as they trudged onward. They were unemotional automata,
who knew nothing except to obey the orders of their terrible chief.
He had commanded them to give safe conduct to the young women
to the Castle, and that was their sole task. So far as the American
was aware, not a word had been spoken by the man at the rear,
and the guide opened his lips only when necessary.</p>

<p>Several times while pressing over the trail, they had caught
sight of the stone structure, and noted the twinkling of the lights
from the upper story. Making another turn, and climbing a slight
ascent, they came to the small plateau on which it stood, only
a few rods in advance.</p>

<p>Proof again appeared that this journey had been pre-arranged.
Instead of two guards, some eight or ten men were patrolling and
lounging on the outside of the grim building. One of these came
forward and spoke for several minutes, in low tones, with the
guide. A call was made to the man at the rear and he advanced
and took part in the conversation.</p>

<p>The ponies halted of their own accord. While Miss Starland was
waiting and wondering, her friend dropped lightly from the saddle
and came to her side.</p>

<p>"Give me your hand, Warrenia; we are done riding for tonight."</p>

<p>The next moment the two young women stood beside each other on
the ground. Naturally the Señorita took charge of her guest and
led the way through the broad opening to the lower part of the
Castle, where a native woman was standing. Manuela recognized
her as a servant of her uncle's household, and addressed her by
name. She replied that their apartment was ready and conducted
the two into the lower division of the building, which was dimly
lit up by a lamp fastened to a bracket in the wall. Still under
the lead of Juanita, as she was called, the couple passed up the
steps to the principal apartment, which they had inspected the
day before.</p>

<p>"You will wish to be together," said the servant with a broad
smile, "and this is your home, so long as you honor the Castle
with your company."</p>

<p>"Yes, we shall stay together," the Señorita hastened to say,
slipping her arm under that of her friend, who pressed it affectionately.
"You may leave us now, Juanita, and when we want you, we will
call."</p>

<p>The apartment was the one that had been provided with conveniences
and appointments, such as two young ladies were likely to need,
even to the little knick-knacks that are considered indispensable
by them. A glance around the room, in the mellow light of the
lamp on the mantel, showed nothing lacking.</p>

<p>"It seems to have been specially prepared for us," said the Señorita.</p>

<p>"And that, my dear friend, is the one thing that troubles me;
I do not understand it; do you?"</p>
