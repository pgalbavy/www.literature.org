<p>The clear ring of an ax was echoing through the arches of a forest,
three-quarters of a century ago; and an athletic man was swinging
the instrument, burying its glittering blade deep in the heart
of the mighty kings of the wood.</p>

<p>Alfred Haverland was an American, who, a number of years before,
had emigrated from the more settled provinces in the East, to
this then remote spot in western New York. Here, in the wilderness,
he had reared a humble home, and, with his loving partner, and
a sister, laid the foundation for a settlement. True, this "settlement"
was still small, consisting only of the persons mentioned, and
a beautiful blue-eyed maiden, their daughter; but Haverland saw
that the tide of emigration was rolling rapidly and surely to
the west, and, ere many years, the villages and cities would take
the place of the wild forest, while the Indians would be driven
farther on toward the setting sun.</p>

<p>The woodman was a splendid specimen of "nature’s noblemen." His
heavy coat lay upon a log a short distance away, and his swelling,
ponderous chest was covered only by a close-fitting under garment,
with the collar thrown open, showing the glowing neck and heaving
breast. Substantial pants met the strong moccasins which encased
his feet. A small raccoon-skin cap rested upon the back of his
head, exposing his forehead, while his black hair swept around
his shoulders. His features were regular and strongly marked.
The brow was rather heavy, the nose of the Roman cast, and the
eyes of a glittering blackness. So he stood with one foot thrust
forward; his muscles, moving and ridging as they were called in
to play, betrayed their formidable strength.</p>

<p>Still the flashing ax sank deeper and deeper into the oak’s red
heart, until it had gone clean through and met the breach upon
the opposite side. Then the grand old forest king began to totter.
Haverland stepped back and ran his eye to the top, as he noticed
it yielding. Slowly it leaned, increasing each second, until it
rushed seemingly forward, and came down to the earth with a thundering
crash and rebound. He stood a moment, his hot breath issuing like
steam from his chest, and then moved forward toward its branches.
At that instant his trained ear detected a suspicious sound, and
dropping his ax, he caught up his rifle and stood on the defensive.</p>

<p>"How de do? how de do? ain’t frightened I hope; it’s nobody but
me, <em>SETH JONES, </em>from New Hampshire," said the new-comer
in a peculiar accent. As the woodman looked up he saw a curious
specimen of the <em>genus homo</em> before him. He is what is
termed a <em>Yankee</em>, being from New Hampshire; but he was
such a person as is rarely met with, and yet which is too often
described now-a-days. He possessed a long, thin Roman nose, a
small twinkling gray eye, with a lithe muscular frame, and long
dangling limbs. His feet were encased in well-fitting shoes, while
the rest of his dress was such as was in vogue on the frontiers
at the time of which we write. His voice was in that peculiar,
uncertain state, which is sometimes seen when it is said to be
"changing." When excited, it made sounds singular and unimaginable.</p>

<p>The woodman, with characteristic penetration, read the man before
him at a glance. Changing his rifle to his left hand, he extended
the other.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, my friend; but then, you know, these are times,
in which it behooves us all to use caution and prudence; and where
one is placed in such a remote section as this it would be criminal
to be careless, when more than one life is dependent upon me for
support and protection."</p>

<p>"Very true, very true, you’re right there, Mr. &#11834; ah! I declare,
I don’t know your name."</p>

<p>"Haverland."</p>

<p>"You’re right, as I said, Mr. Have-your-land, or Haverland as
the case may be. I tell <em>you</em> these <em>are</em> dubious
times&mdash;no disputin’ that, and I am considerably s’prised when
I heard the ring of an ax down in these parts."</p>

<p>"And I was equally surprised to meet your visage when I looked
up. Jones, I believe you said was your name."</p>

<p>"Exactly: &mdash;Seth Jones, from New Hampshire. The Jones’ are
a numerous family up there&mdash;rather too many of them for comfort,&mdash;so
I migrated. Mought be acquainted perhaps?"</p>

<p>"No; I have no acquaintances, to my knowledge, in that section."</p>

<p>"Haven’t, eh? Thought the Jones’ were pretty generally known
through the country. Some remarkable geniuses have sprung from
the family? But what under the sun keeps you out in this heathen
country? What brought you here?"</p>

<p>"Enterprise, sir; I was tired of the civilized portion of our
country, and, when such glorious fields were offered to the emigrant,
as are here spread before him, I considered it a duty to avail
myself of them, and I have done so. And now, sir, be equally frank
with me, and let me know what induced you to visit this perilous
region when you had no reason to suppose that a settlement had
yet been commenced by the whites. You look to me as if you were
an Indian hunter or scout."</p>

<p>"Wal, perhaps I am. At any rate I have been. I was scout among
the Green Mountain Boys, under Colonel Allen, and staid with them
till the Revolution was finished. After that, I went down on the
farm and worked a while with the old man. Something occurred in
our neighborhood that led me to think, it was best for me to leave,
I won’t say what it was, but I will say it was no crime I committed.
I stopped at the settlement down the river a few days, and then
come to the conclusion to take a tramp in these parts."</p>

<p>"I am very glad you have come, for it isn’t often you get sight
of a white face. I hope you will take the welcome of a backwoodsman,
and make your home with us as long a time as you can&mdash;remembering
that the longer you stay, the more welcome you will be."</p>

<p>"I shall probably stay till you git tired of me, at any rate,"
laughed the eccentric Seth Jones.</p>

<p>"As you are from the East, probably you can give information
of the state of feeling among the Indians between that section
and us. From your remarks, I should infer, however, that nothing
very serious threatens."</p>

<p>"Don’t know ’bout that," replied Seth, shaking his head and looking
to the ground.</p>

<p>"Why so, my friend?"</p>

<p>"I tell you what, you, I heerd orful stories ’long the way. They
say since this war, the darned red-coats have kept the Injins
at work. Leastways it’s pretty sartin they are at work, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" asked the woodman, betraying an anxiety in his
speech.</p>

<p>"Purty sure. There’s a little settlement down here some miles,
(I have forgot the name,) sot on by the imps, and burned all up."</p>

<p>"Is it possible? Reports have reached me during the past three
or four months, of the deadly hostility existing between the whites
and reds, but I was glad to doubt it. Although, I sometimes felt
it was wrong."</p>

<p>"’Twas so; and if you vally that ar wife of your bussum, and
your little cherubims, (as I allow you’ve got,) you’d better be
makin’ tracks for safer quarters. Why, how have you stood it so
long?"</p>

<p>"My conduct toward the Indians has ever been characterized by
honesty and good will upon my part, and they have ever evinced
a friendly feeling toward me, and my helpless ones. I place great
reliance upon this state of feeling, in fact, my <em>only reliance</em>.</p>

<p>"Just so; but I tell you, it won’t do to trust an Ingin. They’re
obstropertous. Go to put your finger on them, and they ain’t thar.
Jest so, by gracious."</p>

<p>"I fear there is too much truth in your suspicions," replied
Haverland, in a saddened tone.</p>

<p>"I’m glad I’ve tumbled onto you, coz I begin to git skeerish,
and I like to do a feller a good turn, and I’ll stick to you,
bein’ I’ve found you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, friend, and let us now proceed homeward. I intended
to spend the day in work, but your words have taken away all desire."</p>

<p>"Sorry to do it; but it’s best, ain’t it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, it would have been wrong, had you not warned me of
impending danger. Let us go home."</p>

<p>So saying, Alfred drew on his coat, slung his rifle and ax over
his shoulder, and struck into a path in the forest, which he himself
had used, and with a thoughtful tread, made his way homeward.
Close behind him, followed his new-made friend.</p>
