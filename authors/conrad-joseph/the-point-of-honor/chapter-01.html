<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Napoleon the First, whose career had the quality of a duel against
the whole of Europe, disliked duelling between the officers of
his army. The great military emperor was not a swashbuckler, and
had little respect for tradition.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a story of duelling which became a legend in the
army runs through the epic of imperial wars. To the surprise and
admiration of their fellows, two officers, like insane artists
trying to gild refined gold or paint the lily, pursued their private
contest through the years of universal carnage. They were officers
of cavalry, and their connection with the high-spirited but fanciful
animal which carries men into battle seems particularly appropriate.
It would be difficult to imagine for heroes of this legend two
officers of infantry of the line, for example, whose fantasy is
tamed by much walking exercise and whose valour necessarily must
be of a more plodding kind. As to artillery, or engineers whose
heads are kept cool on a diet of mathematics, it is simply unthinkable.</p>

<p>The names of the two officers were Feraud and D'Hubert, and they
were both lieutenants in a regiment of hussars, but not in the
same regiment.</p>

<p>Feraud was doing regimental work, but Lieutenant D'Hubert had
the good fortune to be attached to the person of the general commanding
the division, as <em>officier d'ordonnance</em>. It was in Strasbourg,
and in this agreeable and important garrison, they were enjoying
greatly a short interval of peace. They were enjoying it, though
both intensely warlike, because it was a sword-sharpening, firelock-cleaning
peace dear to a military heart and undamaging to military prestige
inasmuch that no one believed in its sincerity or duration.</p>

<p>Under those historical circumstances so favourable to the proper
appreciation of military leisure Lieutenant D'Hubert could have
been seen one fine afternoon making his way along the street of
a cheerful suburb towards Lieutenant Feraud's quarters, which
were in a private house with a garden at the back, belonging to
an old maiden lady.</p>

<p>His knock at the door was answered instantly by a young maid
in Alsatian costume. Her fresh complexion and her long eyelashes,
which she lowered modestly at the sight of the tall officer, caused
Lieutenant D'Hubert, who was accessible to esthetic impressions,
to relax the cold, on-duty expression of his face. At the same
time he observed that the girl had over her arm a pair of hussar's
breeches, red with a blue stripe.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Feraud at home?" he inquired benevolently.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir. He went out at six this morning."</p>

<p>And the little maid tried to close the door, but Lieutenant D'Hubert,
opposing this move with gentle firmness, stepped into the anteroom
jingling his spurs.</p>

<p>"Come, my dear. You don't mean to say he has not been home since
six o'clock this morning?"</p>

<p>Saying these words, Lieutenant D'Hubert opened without ceremony
the door of a room so comfortable and neatly ordered that only
from internal evidence in the shape of boots, uniforms and military
accoutrements, did he acquire the conviction that it was Lieutenant
Feraud's room. And he saw also that Lieutenant Feraud was not
at home. The truthful maid had followed him and looked up inquisitively.</p>

<p>"H'm," said Lieutenant D'Hubert, greatly disappointed, for he
had already visited all the haunts where a lieutenant of hussars
could be found of a fine afternoon. "And do you happen to know,
my dear, why he went out at six this morning?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered readily. "He came home late at night and snored.
I heard him when I got up at five. Then he dressed himself in
his oldest uniform and went out. Service, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Service? Not a bit of it!" cried Lieutenant D'Hubert. "Learn,
my child, that he went out so early to fight a duel with a civilian."</p>

<p>She heard the news without a quiver of her dark eyelashes. It
was very obvious that the actions of Lieutenant Feraud were generally
above criticism. She only looked up for a moment in mute surprise,
and Lieutenant D'Hubert concluded from this absence of emotion
that she must have seen Lieutenant Feraud since the morning. He
looked around the room.</p>

<p>"Come," he insisted, with confidential familiarity. "He's perhaps
somewhere in the house now?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"So much the worse for him," continued Lieutenant D'Hubert, in
a tone of anxious conviction. "But he has been home this morning?"</p>

<p>This time the pretty maid nodded slightly.</p>

<p>"He has!" cried Lieutenant D'Hubert. "And went out again? What
for? Couldn't he keep quietly indoors? What a lunatic! My dear
child...."</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Hubert's natural kindness of disposition and strong
sense of comradeship helped his powers of observation, which generally
were not remarkable. He changed his tone to a most insinuating
softness; and gazing at the hussar's breeches hanging over the
arm of the girl, he appealed to the interest she took in Lieutenant
Feraud's comfort and happiness. He was pressing and persuasive.
He used his eyes, which were large and fine, with excellent effect.
His anxiety to get hold at once of Lieutenant Feraud, for Lieutenant
Feraud's own good, seemed so genuine that at last it overcame
the girl's discretion. Unluckily she had not much to tell. Lieutenant
Feraud had returned home shortly before ten; had walked straight
into his room and had thrown himself on his bed to resume his
slumbers. She had heard him snore rather louder than before far
into the afternoon. Then he got up, put on his best uniform and
went out. That was all she knew.</p>

<p>She raised her candid eyes up to Lieutenant D'Hubert, who stared
at her incredulously.</p>

<p>"It's incredible. Gone parading the town in his best uniform!
My dear child, don't you know that he ran that civilian through
this morning? Clean through as you spit a hare."</p>

<p>She accepted this gruesome intelligence without any signs of
distress. But she pressed her lips together thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"He isn't parading the town," she remarked, in a low tone. "Far
from it."</p>

<p>"The civilian's family is making an awful row," continued Lieutenant
D'Hubert, pursuing his train of thought. "And the general is very
angry. It's one of the best families in the town. Feraud ought
to have kept close at least...."</p>

<p>"What will the general do to him?" inquired the girl anxiously.</p>

<p>"He won't have his head cut off, to be sure," answered Lieutenant
D'Hubert. "But his conduct is positively indecent. He's making
no end of trouble for himself by this sort of bravado."</p>

<p>"But he isn't parading the town," the maid murmured again.</p>

<p>"Why, yes! Now I think of it. I haven't seen him anywhere. What
on earth has he done with himself?"</p>

<p>"He's gone to pay a call," suggested the maid, after a moment
of silence.</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Hubert was surprised. "A call! Do you mean a call
on a lady? The cheek of the man. But how do you know this?"</p>

<p>Without concealing her woman's scorn for the denseness of the
masculine mind, the pretty maid reminded him that Lieutenant Feraud
had arrayed himself in his best uniform before going out. He had
also put on his newest dolman, she added in a tone as if this
conversation were getting on her nerves and turned away brusquely.
Lieutenant D'Hubert, without questioning the accuracy of the implied
deduction, did not see that it advanced him much on his official
quest. For his quest after Lieutenant Feraud had an official character.
He did not know any of the women this fellow who had run a man
through in the morning was likely to call on in the afternoon.
The two officers knew each other but slightly. He bit his gloved
finger in perplexity.</p>

<p>"Call!" he exclaimed. "Call on the devil." The girl, with her
back to him and folding the hussar's breeches on a chair, said
with a vexed little laugh:</p>

<p>"Oh, no! On Madame de Lionne." Lieutenant D'Hubert whistled softly.
Madame de Lionne, the wife of a high official, had a well-known
salon and some pretensions to sensibility and elegance. The husband
was a civilian and old, but the society of the salon was young
and military for the greater part. Lieutenant D'Hubert had whistled,
not because the idea of pursuing Lieutenant Feraud into that very
salon was in the least distasteful to him, but because having
but lately arrived in Strasbourg he had not the time as yet to
get an introduction to Madame de Lionne. And what was that swashbuckler
Feraud doing there? He did not seem the sort of man who...</p>

<p>"Are you certain of what you say?" asked Lieutenant D'Hubert.</p>

<p>The girl was perfectly certain. Without turning round to look
at him she explained that the coachman of their next-door neighbours
knew the <em>maitre-d'hôtel</em> of Madame de Lionne. In this
way she got her information. And she was perfectly certain. In
giving this assurance she sighed. Lieutenant Feraud called there
nearly every afternoon.</p>

<p>"Ah, bah!" exclaimed D'Hubert ironically. His opinion of Madame
de Lionne went down several degrees. Lieutenant Feraud did not
seem to him specially worthy of attention on the part of a woman
with a reputation for sensibility and elegance. But there was
no saying. At bottom they were all alike&mdash;very practical rather
than idealistic. Lieutenant D'Hubert, however, did not allow his
mind to dwell on these considerations. "By thunder!" he reflected
aloud. "The general goes there sometimes. If he happens to find
the fellow making eyes at the lady there will be the devil to
pay. Our general is not a very accommodating person, I can tell
you."</p>

<p>"Go quickly then. Don't stand here now I've told you where he
is," cried the girl, colouring to the eyes.</p>

<p>"Thanks, my dear. I don't know what I would have done without
you."</p>

<p>After manifesting his gratitude in an aggressive way which at
first was repulsed violently and then submitted to with a sudden
and still more repellent indifference, Lieutenant D'Hubert took
his departure.</p>

<p>He clanked and jingled along the streets with a martial swagger.
To run a comrade to earth in a drawing-room where he was not known
did not trouble him in the least. A uniform is a social passport.
His position as <em>officier d'ordonnance</em> of the general
added to his assurance. Moreover, now he knew where to find Lieutenant
Feraud, he had no option. It was a service matter.</p>

<p>Madame de Lionne's house had an excellent appearance. A man in
livery opening the door of a large drawing-room with a waxed floor,
shouted his name and stood aside to let him pass. It was a reception
day. The ladies wearing hats surcharged with a profusion of feathers,
sheathed in clinging white gowns from their armpits to the tips
of their low satin shoes, looked sylphlike and cool in a great
display of bare necks and arms. The men who talked with them,
on the contrary, were arrayed heavily in ample, coloured garments
with stiff collars up to their ears and thick sashes round their
waists. Lieutenant D'Hubert made his unabashed way across the
room, and bowing low before a sylphlike form reclining on a couch,
offered his apologies for this intrusion, which nothing could
excuse but the extreme urgency of the service order he had to
communicate to his comrade Feraud. He proposed to himself to come
presently in a more regular manner and beg forgiveness for interrupting
this interesting conversation....</p>

<p>A bare arm was extended to him with gracious condescension even
before he had finished speaking. He pressed the hand respectfully
to his lips and made the mental remark that it was bony. Madame
de Lionne was a blonde with too fine a skin and a long face.</p>

<p>"<em>C'est ça!</em>" she said, with an ethereal smile, disclosing
a set of large teeth. "Come this evening to plead for your forgiveness."</p>

<p>"I will not fail, madame."</p>

<p>Meantime Lieutenant Feraud, splendid in his new dolman and the
extremely polished boots of his calling, sat on a chair within
a foot of the couch and, one hand propped on his thigh, with the
other twirled his moustache to a point without uttering a sound.
At a significant glance from D'Hubert he rose without alacrity
and followed him into the recess of a window.</p>

<p>"What is it you want with me?" he asked in a tone of annoyance,
which astonished not a little the other. Lieutenant D'Hubert could
not imagine that in the innocence of his heart and simplicity
of his conscience Lieutenant Feraud took a view of his duel in
which neither remorse nor yet a rational apprehension of consequences
had any place. Though Lieutenant Feraud had no clear recollection
how the quarrel had originated (it was begun in an establishment
where beer and wine are drunk late at night), he had not the slightest
doubt of being himself the outraged party. He had secured two
experienced friends or his seconds. Everything had been done according
to the rules governing that sort of adventure. And a duel is obviously
fought for the purpose of someone being at least hurt if not killed
outright. The civilian got hurt. That also was in order. Lieutenant
Feraud was perfectly tranquil. But Lieutenant D'Hubert mistook
this simple attitude for affectation and spoke with some heat.</p>

<p>"I am directed by the general to give you the order to go at
once to your quarters and remain there under close arrest."</p>

<p>It was now the turn of Lieutenant Feraud to be astonished.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you telling me there?" he murmured faintly,
and fell into such profound wonder that he could only follow mechanically
the motions of Lieutenant D'Hubert. The two officers&mdash;one tall,
with an interesting face and a moustache the colour of ripe corn,
the other short and sturdy, with a hooked nose and a thick crop
of black, curly hair&mdash;approached the mistress of the house to
take their leave. Madame de Lionne, a woman of eclectic taste,
smiled upon these armed young men with impartial sensibility and
an equal share of interest. Madame de Lionne took her delight
in the infinite variety of the human species. All the eyes in
the drawing-room followed the departing officers, one strutting,
the other striding, with curiosity. When the door had closed after
them one or two men who had already heard of the duel imparted
the information to the sylphlike ladies, who received it with
little shrieks of humane concern.</p>

<p>Meantime the two hussars walked side by side, Lieutenant Feraud
trying to fathom the hidden reason of things which in this instance
eluded the grasp of his intellect; Lieutenant D'Hubert feeling
bored by the part he had to play; because the general's instructions
were that he should see personally that Lieutenant Feraud carried
out his orders to the letter and at once.</p>

<p>"The chief seems to know this animal," he thought, eyeing his
companion, whose round face, the round eyes and even the twisted-up
jet black little moustache seemed animated by his mental exasperation
before the incomprehensible. And aloud he observed rather reproachfully,
"The general is in a devilish fury with you."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Feraud stopped short on the edge of the pavement and
cried in the accents of unmistakable sincerity: "What on earth
for?" The innocence of the fiery Gascon soul was depicted in the
manner in which he seized his head in both his hands as if to
prevent it bursting with perplexity.</p>

<p>"For the duel," said Lieutenant D'Hubert curtly. He was annoyed
greatly by this sort of perverse fooling.</p>

<p>"The duel! The..."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Feraud passed from one paroxysm of astonishment into
another. He dropped his hands and walked on slowly trying to reconcile
this information with the state of his own feelings. It was impossible.
He burst out indignantly:</p>

<p>"Was I to let that sauerkraut-eating civilian wipe his boots
on the uniform of the Seventh Hussars?"</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Hubert could not be altogether unsympathetic toward
that sentiment. This little fellow is a lunatic, he thought to
himself, but there is something in what he says.</p>

<p>"Of course, I don't know how far you were justified," he said
soothingly. "And the general himself may not be exactly informed.
A lot of people have been deafening him with their lamentations."</p>

<p>"Ah, he is not exactly informed," mumbled Lieutenant Feraud,
walking faster and faster as his choler at the injustice of his
fate began to rise. "He is not exactly.... And he orders me under
close arrest with God knows what afterward."</p>

<p>"Don't excite yourself like this," remonstrated the other. "That
young man's people are very influential, you know, and it looks
bad enough on the face of it. The general had to take notice of
their complaint at once. I don't think he means to be over-severe
with you. It is best for you to be kept out of sight for a while."</p>

<p>"I am very much obliged to the general," muttered Lieutenant
Feraud through his teeth.</p>

<p>"And perhaps you would say I ought to be grateful to you too
for the trouble you have taken to hunt me up in the drawing-room
of a lady who..."</p>

<p>"Frankly," interrupted Lieutenant D'Hubert, with an innocent
laugh, "I think you ought to be. I had no end of trouble to find
out where you were. It wasn't exactly the place for you to disport
yourself in under the circumstances. If the general had caught
you there making eyes at the goddess of the temple.... Oh, my
word!... He hates to be bothered with complaints against his officers,
you know. And it looked uncommonly like sheer bravado."</p>

<p>The two officers had arrived now at the street door of Lieutenant
Feraud's lodgings. The latter turned toward his companion. "Lieutenant
D'Hubert," he said, "I have something to say to you which can't
be said very well in the street. You can't refuse to come in."</p>

<p>The pretty maid had opened the door. Lieutenant Feraud brushed
past her brusquely and she raised her scared, questioning eyes
to Lieutenant D'Hubert, who could do nothing but shrug his shoulders
slightly as he followed with marked reluctance.</p>

<p>In his room Lieutenant Feraud unhooked the clasp, flung his new
dolman on the bed, and folding his arms across his chest, turned
to the other hussar.</p>

<p>"Do you imagine I am a man to submit tamely to injustice?" he
inquired in a boisterous voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, do be reasonable," remonstrated Lieutenant D'Hubert.</p>

<p>"I am reasonable. I am perfectly reasonable," retorted the other,
ominously lowering his voice. "I can't call the general to account
for his behaviour, but you are going to answer to me for yours."</p>

<p>"I can't listen to this nonsense," murmured Lieutenant D'Hubert,
making a slightly contemptuous grimace.</p>

<p>"You call that nonsense. It seems to me perfectly clear. Unless
you don't understand French."</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean," screamed suddenly Lieutenant Feraud, "to cut off your
ears to teach you not to disturb me, orders or no orders, when
I am talking to a lady."</p>

<p>A profound silence followed this mad declaration&mdash;and through
the open window Lieutenant D'Hubert heard the little birds singing
sanely in the garden. He said coldly:</p>

<p>"Why! If you take that tone, of course I will hold myself at
your disposal whenever you are at liberty to attend to this affair.
But I don't think you will cut off my ears."</p>

<p>"I am going to attend to it at once," declared Lieutenant Feraud,
with extreme truculence. "If you are thinking of displaying your
airs and graces to-night in Madame de Lionne's salon you are very
much mistaken."</p>

<p>"Really," said Lieutenant D'Hubert, who was beginning to feel
irritated, "you are an impracticable sort of fellow. The general's
orders to me were to put you under arrest, not to carve you into
small pieces. Good-morning." Turning his back on the little Gascon
who, always sober in his potations, was as though born intoxicated,
with the sunshine of his wine-ripening country, the northman,
who could drink hard on occasion, but was born sober under the
watery skies of Picardy, made calmly for the door. Hearing, however,
the unmistakable sound, behind his back, of a sword drawn from
the scabbard, he had no option but to stop.</p>

<p>"Devil take this mad Southerner," he thought, spinning round
and surveying with composure the warlike posture of Lieutenant
Feraud with the unsheathed sword in his hand.</p>

<p>"At once. At once," stuttered Feraud, beside himself.</p>

<p>"You had my answer," said the other, keeping his temper very
well.</p>

<p>At first he had been only vexed and somewhat amused. But now
his face got clouded. He was asking himself seriously how he could
manage to get away. Obviously it was impossible to run from a
man with a sword, and as to fighting him, it seemed completely
out of the question.</p>

<p>He waited awhile, then said exactly what was in his heart:</p>

<p>"Drop this; I won't fight you now. I won't be made ridiculous."</p>

<p>"Ah, you won't!" hissed the Gascon. "I suppose you prefer to
be made infamous. Do you hear what I say?... Infamous! Infamous!
Infamous!" he shrieked, raising and falling on his toes and getting
very red in the face. Lieutenant D'Hubert, on the contrary, became
very pale at the sound of the unsavoury word, then flushed pink
to the roots of his fair hair.</p>

<p>"But you can't go out to fight; you are under arrest, you lunatic,"
he objected, with angry scorn.</p>

<p>"There's the garden. It's big enough to lay out your long carcass
in,"  spluttered out Lieutenant Feraud with such ardour that somehow
the anger of the cooler man subsided.</p>

<p>"This is perfectly absurd," he said, glad enough to think he
had found a way out of it for the moment. "We will never get any
of our comrades to serve as seconds. It's preposterous."</p>

<p>"Seconds! Damn the seconds! We don't want any seconds. Don't
you worry about any seconds. I will send word to your friends
to come and bury you when I am done. This is no time for ceremonies.
And if you want any witnesses, I'll send word to the old girl
to put her head out of a window at the back. Stay! There's the
gardener. He'll do. He's as deaf as a post, but he has two eyes
in his head. Come along. I will teach you, my staff officer, that
the carrying about of a general's orders is not always child's
play."</p>

<p>While thus discoursing he had unbuckled his empty scabbard. He
sent it flying under the bed, and, lowering the point of the sword,
brushed past the perplexed Lieutenant D'Hubert, crying: "Follow
me." Directly he had flung open the door a faint shriek was heard,
and the pretty maid, who had been listening at the keyhole, staggered
backward, putting the backs of her hands over her eyes. He didn't
seem to see her, but as he was crossing the anteroom she ran after
him and seized his left arm. He shook her off and then she rushed
upon Lieutenant D'Hubert and clawed at the sleeve of his uniform.</p>

<p>"Wretched man," she sobbed despairingly. "Is this what you wanted
to find him for?"</p>

<p>"Let me go," entreated Lieutenant D'Hubert, trying to disengage
himself gently. "It's like being in a madhouse," he protested
with exasperation. "Do let me go, I won't do him any harm."</p>

<p>A fiendish laugh from Lieutenant Feraud commented that assurance.
"Come along," he cried impatiently, with a stamp of his foot.</p>

<p>And Lieutenant D'Hubert did follow. He could do nothing else.
But in vindication of his sanity it must be recorded that as he
passed out of the anteroom the notion of opening the street door
and bolting out presented itself to this brave youth, only, of
course, to be instantly dismissed: for he felt sure that the other
would pursue him without shame or compunction. And the prospect
of an officer of hussars being chased along the street by another
officer of hussars with a naked sword could not be for a moment
entertained. Therefore he followed into the garden. Behind them
the girl tottered out too. With ashy lips and wild, scared eyes,
she surrendered to a dreadful curiosity. She had also a vague
notion of rushing, if need be, between Lieutenant Feraud and death.</p>

<p>The deaf gardener, utterly unconscious of approaching footsteps,
went on watering his flowers till Lieutenant Feraud thumped him
on the back. Beholding suddenly an infuriated man, flourishing
a big sabre, the old chap, trembling in all his limbs, dropped
the watering pot. At once Lieutenant Feraud kicked it away with
great animosity; then seizing the gardener by the throat, backed
him against a tree and held him there shouting in his ear:</p>

<p>"Stay here and look on. You understand you've got to look on.
Don't dare budge from the spot."</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Hubert, coming slowly down the walk, unclasped his
dolman with undisguised reluctance. Even then, with his hand already
on his sword, he hesitated to draw, till a roar "<em>En garde,
fichtre!</em> What do you think you came here for?" and the rush
of his adversary forced him to put himself as quickly as possible
in a posture of defence.</p>

<p>The angry clash of arms filled that prim garden, which hitherto
had known no more warlike sound than the click of clipping shears;
and presently the upper part of an old lady's body was projected
out of a window upstairs. She flung her arms above her white cap,
and began scolding in a thin, cracked voice. The gardener remained
glued to the tree looking on, his toothless mouth open in idiotic
astonishment, and a little farther up the walk the pretty girl,
as if held by a spell, ran to and fro on a small grass plot, wringing
her hands and muttering crazily. She did not rush between the
combatants. The onslaughts of Lieutenant Feraud were so fierce
that her heart failed her.</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Hubert, his faculties concentrated upon defence,
needed all his skill and science of the sword to stop the rushes
of his adversary. Twice already he had had to break ground.</p>

<p>[Illustration: 028.jpg "The angry clash of arms filled that prim
garden"]</p>

<p>It bothered him to feel his foothold made insecure by the round
dry gravel of the path rolling under the hard soles of his boots.
This was most unsuitable ground, he thought, keeping a watchful,
narrowed gaze shaded by long eyelashes upon the fiery staring
eyeballs of his thick-set adversary. This absurd affair would
ruin his reputation of a sensible, steady, promising young officer.
It would damage, at any rate, his immediate prospects and lose
him the good will of his general. These worldly preoccupations
were no doubt misplaced in view of the solemnity of the moment.
For a duel whether regarded as a ceremony in the cult of honour
or even when regrettably casual and reduced in its moral essence
to a distinguished form of manly sport, demands perfect singleness
of intention, a homicidal austerity of mood. On the other hand,
this vivid concern for the future in a man occupied in keeping
sudden death at sword's length from his breast, had not a bad
effect, inasmuch as it began to rouse the slow anger of Lieutenant
D'Hubert. Some seventy seconds had elapsed since they had crossed
steel and Lieutenant D'Hubert had to break ground again in order
to avoid impaling his reckless adversary like a beetle for a cabinet
of specimens. The result was that, misapprehending the motive,
Lieutenant Feraud, giving vent to triumphant snarls, pressed his
attack with renewed vigour.</p>

<p>This enraged animal, thought D'Hubert, will have me against the
wall directly. He imagined himself much closer to the house than
he was; and he dared not turn his head, such an act under the
circumstances being equivalent to deliberate suicide. It seemed
to him that he was keeping his adversary off with his eyes much
more than with his point. Lieutenant Feraud crouched and bounded
with a tigerish, ferocious agility&mdash;enough to trouble the stoutest
heart. But what was more appalling than the fury of a wild beast
accomplishing in all innocence of heart a natural function, was
the fixity of savage purpose man alone is capable of displaying.
Lieutenant D'Hubert in the midst of his worldly preoccupations
perceived it at last. It was an absurd and damaging affair to
be drawn into. But whatever silly intention the fellow had started
with, it was clear that by this time he meant to kill&mdash;nothing
else. He meant it with an intensity of will utterly beyond the
inferior faculties of a tiger.</p>

<p>As is the case with constitutionally brave men, the full view
of the danger interested Lieutenant D'Hubert. And directly he
got properly interested, the length of his arm and the coolness
of his head told in his favour. It was the turn of Lieutenant
Feraud to recoil. He did this with a blood-curdling grunt of baffled
rage. He made a swift feint and then rushed straight forward.</p>

<p>"Ah! you would, would you?" Lieutenant D'Hubert exclaimed mentally
to himself. The combat had lasted nearly two minutes, time enough
for any man to get embittered, apart from the merits of the quarrel.
And all at once it was over. Trying to close breast to breast
under his adversary's guard, Lieutenant Feraud received a slash
on his shortened arm. He did not feel it in the least, but it
checked his rush, and his feet slipping on the gravel, he fell
backward with great violence. The shock jarred his boiling brain
into the perfect quietude of insensibility. Simultaneously with
his fall the pretty servant girl shrieked piercingly; but the
old maiden lady at the window ceased her scolding and with great
presence of mind began to cross herself.</p>

<p>In the first moment, seeing his adversary lying perfectly still,
his face to the sky and his toes turned up, Lieutenant D'Hubert
thought he had killed him outright. The impression of having slashed
hard enough to cut his man clean in two abode with him for awhile
in an exaggerated impression of the right good will he had put
into the blow. He went down on his knees by the side of the prostrate
body. Discovering that not even the arm was severed, a slight
sense of disappointment mingled with the feeling of relief. But,
indeed, he did not want the death of that sinner. The affair was
ugly enough as it stood. Lieutenant D'Hubert addressed himself
at once to the task of stopping the bleeding. In this task it
was his fate to be ridiculously impeded by the pretty maid. The
girl, filling the garden with cries for help, flung herself upon
his defenceless back and, twining her fingers in his hair, tugged
at his head. Why she should choose to hinder him at this precise
moment he could not in the least understand. He did not try. It
was all like a very wicked and harassing dream. Twice, to save
himself from being pulled over, he had to rise and throw her off.
He did this stoically, without a word, kneeling down again at
once to go on with his work. But when the work was done he seized
both her arms and held them down. Her cap was half off, her face
was red, her eyes glared with crazy boldness. He looked mildly
into them while she called him a wretch, a traitor and a murderer
many times in succession. This did not annoy him so much as the
conviction that in her scurries she had managed to scratch his
face abundantly. Ridicule would be added to the scandal of the
story. He imagined it making its way through the garrison, through
the whole army, with every possible distortion of motive and sentiment
and circumstance, spreading a doubt upon the sanity of his conduct
and the distinction of his taste even into the very bosom of his
honourable family. It was all very well for that fellow Feraud,
who had no connections, no family to speak of, and no quality
but courage which, anyhow, was a matter of course, and possessed
by every single trooper in the whole mass of French cavalry. Still
holding the wrists of the girl in a strong grip, Lieutenant D'Hubert
looked over his shoulder. Lieutenant Feraud had opened his eyes.
He did not move. Like a man just waking from a deep sleep he stared
with a drowsy expression at the evening sky.</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Hubert's urgent shouts to the old gardener produced
no effect&mdash;not so much as to make him shut his toothless mouth.
Then he remembered that the man was stone deaf. All that time
the girl, attempting to free her wrists, struggled, not with maidenly
coyness but like a sort of pretty dumb fury, not even refraining
from kicking his shins now and then. He continued to hold her
as if in a vice, his instinct telling him that were he to let
her go she would fly at his eyes. But he was greatly humiliated
by his position. At last she gave up, more exhausted than appeased,
he feared. Nevertheless he attempted to get out of this wicked
dream by way of negotiation.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," he said as calmly as he could. "Will you promise
to run for a surgeon if I let you go?"</p>

<p>He was profoundly afflicted when, panting, sobbing, and choking,
she made it clear that she would do nothing of the kind. On the
contrary, her incoherent intentions were to remain in the garden
and fight with her nails and her teeth for the protection of the
prostrate man. This was horrible.</p>

<p>"My dear child," he cried in despair, "is it possible that you
think me capable of murdering a wounded adversary? Is it.... Be
quiet, you little wildcat, you," he added.</p>

<p>She struggled. A thick sleepy voice said behind him:</p>

<p>"What are you up to with that girl?"</p>

<p>Lieutenant Feraud had raised himself on his good arm. He was
looking sleepily at his other arm, at the mess of blood on his
uniform, at a small red pool on the ground, at his sabre lying
a foot away on the path. Then he laid himself down gently again
to think it all out as far as a thundering headache would permit
of mental operations.</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Hubert released the girl's wrists. She flew away
down the path and crouched wildly by the side of the vanquished
warrior. The shades of night were falling on the little trim garden
with this touching group whence proceeded low murmurs of sorrow
and compassion with other feeble sounds of a different character
as if an imperfectly awake invalid were trying to swear. Lieutenant
D'Hubert went away, too exasperated to care what would happen.</p>

<p>He passed through the silent house and congratulated himself
upon the dusk concealing his gory hands and scratched face from
the passers-by. But this story could by no means be concealed.
He dreaded the discredit and ridicule above everything, and was
painfully aware of sneaking through the back streets to his quarters.
In one of these quiet side streets the sounds of a flute coming
out of the open window of a lighted upstairs room in a modest
house interrupted his dismal reflections. It was being played
with a deliberate, persevering virtuosity, and through the <em>fioritures</em>
of the tune one could even hear the thump of the foot beating
time on the floor.</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Hubert shouted a name which was that of an army
surgeon whom he knew fairly well. The sounds of the flute ceased
and the musician appeared at the window, his instrument still
in his hand, peering into the street.</p>

<p>"Who calls? You, D'Hubert! What brings you this way?"</p>

<p>He did not like to be disturbed when he was playing the flute.
He was a man whose hair had turned gray already in the thankless
task of tying up wounds on battlefields where others reaped advancement
and glory.</p>

<p>"I want you to go at once and see Feraud. You know Lieutenant
Feraud? He lives down the second street. It's but a step from
here."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with him?"</p>

<p>"Wounded."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" cried D'Hubert. "I come from there."</p>

<p>"That's amusing," said the elderly surgeon. Amusing was his favourite
word; but the expression of his face when he pronounced it never
corresponded. He was a stolid man. "Come in," he added. "I'll
get ready in a moment."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I will. I want to wash my hands in your room."</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Hubert found the surgeon occupied in unscrewing
his flute and packing the pieces methodically in a velvet-lined
case. He turned his head.</p>

<p>"Water there&mdash;in the corner. Your hands do want washing."</p>

<p>"I've stopped the bleeding," said Lieutenant D'Hubert. "But you
had better make haste. It's rather more than ten minutes ago,
you know."</p>

<p>The surgeon did not hurry his movements.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Dressing came off? That's amusing. I've been
busy in the hospital all day, but somebody has told me that he
hadn't a scratch."</p>

<p>"Not the same duel probably," growled moodily Lieutenant D'Hubert,
wiping his hands on a coarse towel.</p>

<p>"Not the same.... What? Another? It would take the very devil
to make me go out twice in one day." He looked narrowly at Lieutenant
D'Hubert. "How did you come by that scratched face? Both sides
too&mdash;and symmetrical. It's amusing."</p>

<p>"Very," snarled Lieutenant D'Hubert. "And you will find his slashed
arm amusing too. It will keep both of you amused for quite a long
time."</p>

<p>The doctor was mystified and impressed by the brusque bitterness
of Lieutenant D'Hubert's tone. They left the house together, and
in the street he was still more mystified by his conduct.</p>

<p>"Aren't you coming with me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," said Lieutenant D'Hubert. "You can find the house by yourself.
The front door will be open very likely."</p>

<p>"All right. Where's his room?"</p>

<p>"Ground floor. But you had better go right through and look in
the garden first."</p>

<p>This astonishing piece of information made the surgeon go off
without further parley. Lieutenant D'Hubert regained his quarters
nursing a hot and uneasy indignation. He dreaded the chaff of
his comrades almost as much as the anger of his superiors. He
felt as though he had been entrapped into a damaging exposure.
The truth was confoundedly grotesque and embarrassing to justify;
putting aside the irregularity of the combat itself which made
it come dangerously near a criminal offence. Like all men without
much imagination, which is such a help in the processes of reflective
thought, Lieutenant D'Hubert became frightfully harassed by the
obvious aspects of his predicament. He was certainly glad that
he had not killed Lieutenant Feraud outside all rules and without
the regular witnesses proper to such a transaction. Uncommonly
glad. At the same time he felt as though he would have liked to
wring his neck for him without ceremony.</p>

<p>He was still under the sway of these contradictory sentiments
when the surgeon amateur of the flute came to see him. More than
three days had elapsed. Lieutenant D'Hubert was no longer <em>officier
d'ordonnance</em> to the general commanding the division. He had
been sent back to his regiment. And he was resuming his connection
with the soldiers' military family, by being shut up in close
confinement not at his own quarters in town, but in a room in
the barracks. Owing to the gravity of the incident, he was allowed
to see no one. He did not know what had happened, what was being
said or what was being thought. The arrival of the surgeon was
a most unexpected event to the worried captive. The amateur of
the flute began by explaining that he was there only by a special
favour of the colonel who had thought fit to relax the general
isolation order for this one occasion.</p>

<p>"I represented to him that it would be only fair to give you
authentic news of your adversary," he continued. "You'll be glad
to hear he's getting better fast."</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Hubert's face exhibited no conventional signs of
gladness. He continued to walk the floor of the dusty bare room.</p>

<p>"Take this chair, doctor," he mumbled.</p>

<p>The doctor sat down.</p>

<p>"This affair is variously appreciated in town and in the army.
In fact the diversity of opinions is amusing."</p>

<p>"Is it?" mumbled Lieutenant D'Hubert, tramping steadily from
wall to wall. But within himself he marvelled that there could
be two opinions on the matter. The surgeon continued:</p>

<p>"Of course as the real facts are not known&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should have thought," interrupted D'Hubert, "that the fellow
would have put you in possession of the facts."</p>

<p>"He did say something," admitted the other, "the first time I
saw him. And, by-the-bye, I did find him in the garden. The thump
on the back of his head had made him a little incoherent then.
Afterwards he was rather reticent than otherwise."</p>

<p>"Didn't think he would have the grace to be ashamed," grunted
D'Hubert, who had stood still for a moment. He resumed his pacing
while the doctor murmured.</p>

<p>"It's very amusing. Ashamed? Shame was not exactly his frame
of mind. However, you may look at the matter otherwise<hr>"</p>

<p>"What are you talking about? What matter?" asked D'Hubert with
a sidelong look at the heavy-faced, gray-haired figure seated
on a wooden chair.</p>

<p>"Whatever it is," said the surgeon, "I wouldn't pronounce an
opinion on your conduct...."</p>

<p>"By heavens, you had better not," burst out D'Hubert.</p>

<p>"There! There! Don't be so quick in flourishing the sword. It
doesn't pay in the long run. Understand once for all that I would
not carve any of you youngsters except with the tools of my trade.
But my advice is good. Moderate your temper. If you go on like
this you will make for yourself an ugly reputation."</p>

<p>"Go on like what?" demanded Lieutenant D'Hubert, stopping short,
quite startled. "I! I! make for myself a reputation.... What do
you imagine<hr>"</p>

<p>"I told you I don't wish to judge of the rights and wrongs of
this incident. It's not my business. Nevertheless...."</p>

<p>"What on earth has he been telling you?" interrupted Lieutenant
D'Hubert in a sort of awed scare.</p>

<p>"I told, you already that at first when I picked him up in the
garden he was incoherent. Afterwards he was naturally reticent.
But I gather at least that he could not help himself...."</p>

<p>"He couldn't?" shouted Lieutenant D'Hubert. Then lowering his
voice, "And what about me? Could I help myself?"</p>

<p>The surgeon rose. His thoughts were running upon the flute, his
constant companion, with a consoling voice. In the vicinity of
field ambulances, after twenty-four hours' hard work, he had been
known to trouble with its sweet sounds the horrible stillness
of battlefields given over to silence and the dead. The solacing
hour of his daily life was approaching and in peace time he held
on to the minutes as a miser to his hoard.</p>

<p>"Of course! Of course!" he said perfunctorily. "You would think
so. It's amusing. However, being perfectly neutral and friendly
to you both, I have consented to deliver his message. Say that
I am humouring an invalid if you like. He says that this affair
is by no means at an end. He intends to send you his seconds directly
he has regained his strength&mdash;providing, of course, the army is
not in the field at that time."</p>

<p>"He intends&mdash;does he? Why certainly," spluttered Lieutenant D'Hubert
passionately. The secret of this exasperation was not apparent
to the visitor; but this passion confirmed him in the belief which
was gaining ground outside that some very serious difference had
arisen between these two young men. Something serious enough to
wear an air of mystery. Some fact of the utmost gravity. To settle
their urgent difference those two young men had risked being broken
and disgraced at the outset, almost, of their career. And he feared
that the forthcoming inquiry would fail to satisfy the public
curiosity. They would not take the public into their confidence
as to that something which had passed between them of a nature
so outrageous as to make them face a charge of murder&mdash;neither
more nor less. But what could it be?</p>

<p>The surgeon was not very curious by temperament; but that question,
haunting his mind, caused him twice that evening to hold the instrument
off his lips and sit silent for a whole minute&mdash;right in the middle
of a tune&mdash;trying to form a plausible conjecture.</p>
