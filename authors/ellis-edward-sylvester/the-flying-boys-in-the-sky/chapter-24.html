<p>Simmons Pendar had the reputation of being one of the best officers
in the detective service. Several of his exploits proved that
he possessed a brilliant mind, was quick in reading the vaguest
clues and marvelously successful in following them up. It is not
my purpose to explain by what subtle means he convinced himself
that the kidnappers of little Grace Hastings had their headquarters
in the extensive wilderness to the westward of the country town
of Chesterton. Had he confessed the truth he would have admitted
that a trifling occurrence, one of those insignificant incidents
which figure oftener than is believed in important matters, gave
him the key. Being human like the rest of us, he made his mistakes
now and then, but felt absolutely sure he had not blundered in
the present instance.</p>

<p>Pendar shared his secret with no one. The surety of a magnificent
money reward, the glory of succeeding where others of his profession
had failed, and his deep sympathy with the victims of the unspeakable
cruelty, inspired him to do everything in his power to right one
of the most diabolical wrongs to which society has been forced
to submit in these later days.</p>

<p>It may be said that the greatest difficulty of all confronted
the detective when he had thus located the miscreants. The letters
which they sent at intervals to the afflicted family were accompanied
by terrifying threats and the demand for an increase of the ransom
rose until it reached the stupendous total of fifty thousand dollars.
To prevent the criminals from carrying out their threats of vengeance,
cunning attempts were made to convince them that the father was
doing all he could to comply with their terms. The difficulty
of transferring so large a sum made the delay seem reasonable
if not unavoidable. In one instance, a large package of genuine
bills was placed where directed, but unfortunately for the success
of the scheme two carefully disguised detectives were hidden in
the vicinity. They were certain they had managed the affair so
skilfully that they were not suspected, but the claimants did
not go forward and a day later a letter reached Mr. Hastings telling
him the trick had been detected and one more repetition of anything
of that nature would close all dealings between them, with the
certainty that they would never see their child again. A last
chance was offered him. He was to place the money in large unmarked
bills inside of a traveling bag and throw it off from the rear
of the midnight train on a date named, two miles west of Chesterton,
at a point indicated so clearly by a pile of towering rocks that
no mistake could be made. A failure to comply with this proposal
would end all dealings between the kidnappers and the parent.</p>

<p>The night fixed upon was the one succeeding the talk which Detective
Pendar held with Harvey Hamilton as related in the preceding chapter.
Thus the crisis was at hand,—so near indeed that Pendar had with
him the bag and its enormously valuable contents, prepared to
carry out, if it could not be avoided, the plan of the miscreants.
He had promised that if success was not reached by him before
the hour set, he would throw off the money at the point named.
Mr. Hastings assured him that if he did not make such a pledge,
he himself would do so. He could not suffer the torture any longer,
and his wife was already at death’s door under the pressure of
the grief that was crushing her to the dust.</p>

<p>These frightful letters were mailed from different points, the
first reaching the family from a substation in Philadelphia. The
last was postmarked at Chesterton, as if the senders wished it
to be known they were near the spot where the deal was to be consummated.</p>

<p>A test of Detective Pendar’s acumen came in the same hour that
he reached the town on the train. At the hotel he quickly fixed
upon the two Italians who were registered under the names of Amasi
Catozzi and Giuseppe Caprioni, and who spent most of their time
in smoking cigarettes and lounging in the sitting-room or on the
front porch. Pendar, as has been stated, assumed the character
of a commercial traveler for a hardware house, and with no unnecessary
delay entered energetically upon his duties. Like a true artist
he did not over-do his part, and it is no small proof of his ability
to say that he succeeded where almost any other one would have
failed. The alert Italians agreed that he was what he represented
himself to be, though they by no means relaxed their vigilance.</p>

<p>A point had been reached in the delicate business where a mistake
was certain to be fatal. The detective must succeed or fail disastrously.
Convinced that the child was held at some point in the adjoining
forest, she must be rescued, if rescued at all, by a rush,—a charge,
as might be said, that would scatter the wretches in such headlong
flight as to compel them to abandon their little prisoner, whom
they would not be likely to harm, since their own peril would
be increased thereby.</p>

<p>It will be seen, however, that to carry out this coup, the officer
must know the exact spot to assail. He could not spend hours in
groping through the wood in search of the place, with the certain
result that the abductors would take alarm and carry their captive
to a secure refuge.</p>

<p>Such was the situation when the arrival of Harvey Hamilton in
his aeroplane gave an unexpected turn to affairs. The plan of
an aerial hunt for the kidnappers had never occurred to the detective
until it forced itself upon him. Here was the means thrust into
his hands, and it has been shown how he turned it to account,
or, more properly, how he tried to turn it to account, for its
success was alarmingly problematical.</p>

<p>The bag with its treasure was deposited in the big safe at the
hotel, no one suspecting its contents. Before this time Pendar
had reached the pleasing certainty that the two Italians felt
no suspicion of him. When he strolled down the long, broad street,
smoking a cigar, and now and then halting to look into the store
windows, neither of the men shadowed him, as they had done earlier
in his visit to Chesterton. The couple were warranted in believing
that since Mr. Pendar was all he claimed to be and there were
no other suspicious characters in town, they had nothing to fear,
the game was still their own.</p>

<p>Thus matters stood when the detective reached the end of the
street, and still leisurely walking, passed into the open country.
It will be remembered that the moon was near its full and the
sky was still unclouded. It was all-important at this point that
the kidnappers should not have their attention drawn to him. A
scrutiny of the road to the rear removed all doubt on that point.</p>

<p>"It was a pretty hard job," he reflected, "but I have thrown
them off the scent and that’s a big thing at this stage of the
game."</p>

<p>He had passed over the road several times in a carriage on business
trips to nearby towns, and was familiar with the forest as viewed
from the highway. He knew the precise spot where a path turned
in among the trees, which presumably led to the cabin where Bohunkus
Johnson had seen the little girl.</p>

<p>Under the shadow of the foliage at the roadside, Pendar stood
for fifteen minutes scrutinizing every point in his field of vision.
His heart gave a quicker throb when, while looking in the opposite
direction from the town, he discerned the dim outlines of a man
coming toward him. Pendar whisked back among the shadows, where
he could not be seen by the individual approaching.</p>

<p>Whether he was Catozzi or Caprioni remained to be learned. If
either of them, the meaning was sinister. From his concealment
the watcher observed that the stranger was smoking a pipe. Moreover,
he was bulky of frame, stooped with age and had a slouching gait.
All this might have been assumed by a young man, but he would
fling aside such disguises when believing he was under the eye
of no one.</p>

<p>The man passed within ten feet of where Pendar stood behind the
trunk of a maple, and in the vivid moonlight the watcher plainly
saw the other’s profile. The snub nose and retreating chin could
not belong to either of the Italians, and this being the fact,
the detective had no cause to give the stranger further thought.</p>

<p>The point at which Pendar had stopped was where the path turned
into the wood. As nearly as he could judge from the account of
Harvey Hamilton, he had about a mile to walk in order to reach
the headquarters of the kidnappers, though if the path were winding
in its course the distance might be greater. He set out without
delay.</p>

<p>It being the summer time, the foliage excluded most of the moonlight
and his journey was mainly in darkness, relieved at intervals
by spaces where the moonbeams partly penetrated. Even with such
occasional help, his progress would have been difficult had he
not possessed the skill of an American Indian in threading his
way through a trackless forest. No one was ever gifted with keener
eyesight or hearing, and he used the two senses to the utmost.
He was liable to meet a stranger or to be shadowed by someone.
Thus the front and rear had to be guarded. Above all things, he
must avoid being discovered while traversing the path, where for
most of the way he had to depend upon his sense of feeling. No
stronger proof of his subtle woodcraft could be asked than the
fact that he never once strayed from his course. He could not
have advanced more smoothly had the sun been shining.</p>

<p>While doing this it was his practice to stop at intervals and
listen. He reasoned that if some one was approaching from the
front, he would not use the extreme caution of an enemy who was
following him, for the latter would know of his presence, while
an individual coming toward him would not.</p>

<p>The detective had traversed one-half the distance, when in the
moonlight he saw a small stream, not more than a rivulet in fact,
which wound across the path from the trees on the left and disappeared
among those on the right. It was at the bottom of a slight declivity,
where a small area was shown in the moonlight. He reflected that
if anyone was near, he would see him as he crossed the illuminated
space. This could be averted by turning into the wood on either
hand, but listening revealed nothing except the faint rustling
of the night breeze among the branches. With little hesitation,
therefore, he leaped lightly across, hurried up the gentle slope
and plunged into the gloom on the other side.</p>

<p>He had gone less than a dozen rods when he abruptly paused, turned
his head and listened intently. A minute or two were enough.</p>

<p>"Someone is following me," was his conclusion. </p>
