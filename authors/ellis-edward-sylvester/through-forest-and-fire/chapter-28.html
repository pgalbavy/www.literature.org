<p>The boys did as directed, and, also stooping down, saw in the
soft earth near the water the prints of the feet of a large animal,
such tracks indeed as could have been made only by the bear.</p>

<p>All agreed that it was that much desired and yet dreaded animal,
and that it was more than likely he had moved to the southward,
so that in point of fact the hunters and hunted had exchanged
relative positions.</p>

<p>Sam sternly directed the attention of Bowser to the trail, and
ordered him to "look into the matter."</p>

<p>The hound sniffed the ground, ran back and forth several times,
and then gazed up at his master, as if awaiting further orders.</p>

<p>"I won't stand any such nonsense as that," said his impatient
master, grasping him by the baggy skin at the back of the neck
and giving him several sharp blows with a switch.</p>

<p>Bowser yelped and kicked lustily, and, when released, placed
his nose to the ground, emitted several more cries, and then trotted
off, taking a direction leading almost directly back over the
path Herbert had followed the day before.</p>

<p>"He's on the trail <em>this</em> time," said Sam, with restored
admiration for the hound, "and if he does well, I'll consider
him a great deal better hunting dog than he has shown himself
yet."</p>

<p>In fact, Bowser acted as if anxious to redeem his tainted reputation,
and, trotting quite briskly, was soon out of sight among the trees,
the lads hurrying after him.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the yelping of the hound ceased, but the
young hunters kept up their pursuit, the fresh trail made by the
dog being easily followed, as he turned over and rumpled the abundant
leaves on the ground, so that it was plainly discernible.</p>

<p>"I wonder why he has stopped barking," said Sam.</p>

<p>"I guess he has got tired," was the rather original reply of
Herbert, who was ready to give information, whether reliable or
not.</p>

<p>"Bowser seems to have a way of doing things which is different
from other dogs&mdash;hallo! there he goes again."</p>

<p>The resounding cries of the hound echoed through the woods, seemingly
at a distance of a half mile, and a little to the east of south.</p>

<p>"I guess he has treed him!" said Herbert, striking into a trot,
the others doing the same, and very much doubting whether the
odd dog had ever treed anything in his life.</p>

<p>A short run only was necessary, when, by stopping and listening,
they learned that the hound was standing instead of running. If
he had been a regular hunting dog, this fact would have proven
that he had brought the game to bay.</p>

<p>As respecting Bowser, it was uncertain what it signified.</p>

<p>It did not take the lads long to hurry over the intervening space,
when they came upon the hound, who was standing under a large
red oak, looking up and barking with all the vigor he possessed.</p>

<p>"He has treed the bear, I do believe!" exclaimed Sam Harper,
breaking ahead of the others in his excitement.</p>

<p>Nick Ribsam also thought the indications pointed that way.</p>
