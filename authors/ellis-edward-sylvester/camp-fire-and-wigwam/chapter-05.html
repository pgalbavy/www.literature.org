<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It never occurred to Jack and Otto that their captors meant to
separate until the division actually took place. As if by a general
understanding, one half of the party moved to the right, and the
rest partly to the left, the course of the former being due west,
and of the latter directly south.</p>

<p>"Halloo, Otto!" called Jack, turning his head and stopping among
the members of his own division who were moving off; "they're
going to part company."</p>

<p>"Dot is vot it looks like; but I guess it ain't going to be for
one great vile. Good-by!"</p>

<p>Jack was unwilling to part with his friend in this abrupt fashion,
and he started toward him with a view of shaking his hand. He
did not dream that his movement would awaken the least opposition;
but he presumed too much on the indulgence of the red men, for,
before he could take three steps, one of the warriors caught his
arm, and, with a violent wrench, flung him in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>It required the utmost effort of Jack to save himself from falling,
and a stinging pain ran through his shoulder. His hot Kentucky
blood was aflame, and the instant he could poise his body he drew
his knife and rushed upon the Indian with the fury of a tiger.</p>

<p>"I'll show you that you can't treat me that way!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The warrior whom he was about to assail faced him in a crouching
posture, both hands resting on his knees, while his ugly countenance
was bisected by a tantalizing grin which showed the molars of
both jaws. His black eyes gleamed like those of a rattlesnake,
and his whole attitude and manner showed that he was seeking to
goad the lad to attack him.</p>

<p>The impetus was not needed. Jack Carleton had no thought of hesitation,
though even in his rage he felt that there was scarcely a shadow
of hope that he would escape with his life from such an encounter.</p>

<p>The moment Jack was close enough he bounded forward and made
a sweeping blow, with the knife gripped in his right hand. Had
the weapon struck where it was aimed, there would have been one
Indian less before the spectators could have realized what had
taken place. The other warriors were looking upon the picture
as though in doubt of what was coming. Among those watching the
scene was Otto Relstaub, whose eyes were riveted on his friend.
The thrilling encounter had opened so suddenly that he fairly
held his breath, certain that Jack would not live two minutes
longer.</p>

<p>But the knife of the boy missed its mark altogether. The keen
point whizzed through empty air, the spiteful force of the blow
turning the lad half way around on his feet, and leaving him utterly
at the mercy of the warrior; the latter could have smitten him
to the earth with the suddenness of the lightning stroke.</p>

<p>But the Indian did not so much as draw his weapon. With a quickness
which the eye could scarcely follow, he snatched the wrist of
the boy's hand and bent it back with such force that poor Jack
was glad to let the weapon fall to the ground. He was discomfited
and helpless.</p>

<p>Jack folded his arms, so as to bring the injured wrist against
his left side and under his elbow. Pressing it close to his body,
he shut his white lips and forced back the cry that struggled
for utterance.</p>

<p>With wonderful coolness the triumphant red man stooped to the
ground, picked up the hunting-knife, and with the same expanse
of grin, presented it to Jack, the handle toward him.</p>

<p>"Takes him, Jack!" called out Otto, who was probably the most
astounded spectator of the scene; "but don't try to kills him
ag'in."</p>

<p>Young Carleton for a moment was as bewildered as a child; but
his good sense rapidly returned, and, with a smile in answer to
that of the Indian, he accepted the weapon and shoved it back
in its place.</p>

<p>Jack was mortified beyond expression at the sorry show he had
made. He had cut a ridiculous figure, and no wonder a general
smile lighted up the faces of the red men gathered around.</p>

<p>But the youth made a mistake when he believed he had lowered
himself in the eyes of his captors. The American race (like all
others) admire true courage and pluck, even though judgment may
be lacking, and the dauntless style in which the young captive
attacked his tormentor, when there was no prospect of success,
awoke a responsive chord in the breast of all. Had Jack shown
himself a coward, they might have treated him as they often did
such captives; but the brave young fellow was in no danger, at
least for the present.</p>

<p>The occurrence took but a fraction of the time that has been
occupied in the telling, and Jack was only given opportunity to
replace the knife, when his captors, arranging themselves so as
to surround him, resumed their march to the westward. Precisely
at the same instant the other half of the company did the same
in the other direction, and once more Otto Relstaub called out:</p>

<p>"Good-by, Jack! good-by to you!"</p>

<p>"Good-by, my friend!" shouted Jack, his heart filled with a deep
misgiving over the singular event. "Keep up a good heart, though
there's no telling whether we shall ever meet again."</p>

<p>"If I get home before you gets dere I will tell Colonel Martin,
and we'll follow you to the Rocky Mountains&#11834;"</p>

<p>Even in that serious moment Jack Carleton broke into laughter
when he saw that the usual fortune of Otto clung to him. His foot
caught in some obstruction, and while in the act of waving his
hand and exchanging greetings with his friend, he stumbled forward
and went down. Clambering to his feet he turned to complete his
words, but his captors seemed to have lost patience on account
of the delay. One seized his right and another his left arm and
began walking him rapidly off. The last sight which Jack gained
of the fellow showed him between two Indians, who were hurrying
him along with such vigor that his head rose and sank with each
unwilling footstep, as though he was alternately lifted from and
pressed down to the ground. A few seconds later and the intervening
trees hid him from sight.</p>

<p>It would have been difficult for Jack Carleton to describe his
varied emotions when forced to admit the fact that he was an actual
prisoner among a band of wandering Indians. The memorable journey
from Kentucky into Louisiana had been attended by many stirring
experiences, and more than once every avenue of escape seemed
to be closed, but, now for the first time, he found himself a
captive within a few miles of his own home.</p>

<p>Whither would these red men take him? Did they mean to hold him
a permanent captive, or, as is often the case with their race,
would they put him to torture and finally to death? The settlements
of Kentucky and Ohio were crimsoned with the deeds of the red
men, and, though some tribes were less warlike than others, it
was not to be supposed that any of them were distinguished for
mercy and forbearance.</p>

<p>"If Colonel Martin only knew this," thought Jack, while tramping
forward, "it wouldn't take him long to gather the men together,
and they would come down on these folks like a whirlwind; but
Otto and I may be gone for weeks before any one will suspect we
are in trouble. Even then they won't know what to do. No, sir,"
added Jack, compressing his lips, "whatever is done must be done
by myself, and, with the help of heaven, I shall part company
with these red men just as soon as the chance presents itself."</p>

<p>Any one in the situation of Jack Carleton cannot lack for themes
on which to employ his brain. It is safe to assert that the boy
did more thinking while on that eventful march than he had done
in the same space of time for years.</p>

<p>It may be said that while the party were on the march, and the
warriors were together, it was utterly out of the question for
Jack to leave against their will. Three strode along in front,
while two were in the rear. Every one was fleeter of foot than
he, and they had six rifles in their possession, while he had
none at all. Could he secure several hundred yards' start, they
would have no difficulty in trailing and running him down, for
the sky was clear, the sun bright, and the footprints of the boy
would show as distinctly to the keen eyes of the red men as though
made in the dust of the highway.</p>

<p>No, he must wait for the darkness of the night, when a few yards
between him and his enemies would prove like a stone wall; when
insidious sleep would seal the eyes of the dusky barbarians, and
he could steal out in the gloom, leaving them to wait for hours
before taking up his trail.</p>

<p>One person was continually in the thoughts of Jack Carleton&mdash;<em>Deerfoot</em>.
"Where is he? Is he days' journey to the south? Is there any hope
of him playing the part of a friend for Otto and me?"</p>

<p>These and similar questions were asked again and again while
the youth was tramping through the wood in the company of his
captors, and his heart sank when his own good sense obliged him
to answer each one in the most unsatisfactory manner.</p>

<p>He recalled that Deerfoot parted with them only a few days before
in a manner which implied that considerable time must pass before
they would see each other again. The young Shawanoe could not
suspect that when his friends reached home, they would immediately
proceed to get into trouble, as they had just done.</p>

<p>"No," added Jack, with a sigh, "from what I know and have heard
of Deerfoot, he has a wonderful way of turning up when wanted,
but it's no use to look for him in this case."</p>

<p>The conclusion of the boy was a sensible one, and he resolutely
faced the situation as it presented itself to him. It was most
serious, and it may be said that every passing hour rendered it
more so, for he was moving away from home, and thereby increasing
the difficulties of returning thither, should it become his good
fortune to gain the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>The warriors who were walking in front, followed the usual custom
of their people&mdash;that is, they proceeded in Indian file, so that
the boy was given a fair view only of the one immediately before
him&mdash;the glimpses of the others being fragmentary. Glancing behind,
he observed the same fact, so that the entire party made but the
single trail, for Jack himself was wise enough to fall in with
their custom.</p>

<p>"It may be," he muttered, after traveling several miles in silence,
"that they live hundreds of miles off and that I won't have a
chance to leave them for weeks or months or&mdash;years," he added
in a hushed voice, and with an additional heart-throb, "but I
shall never be reconciled to live in the wigwams of the red men."</p>

<p>It seemed curious to the young captive that a party of friends,
like the Indians, should tramp mile after mile as they did without
speaking a single word. Now and then, some one would utter an
exclamation which sounded more like the grunt of a porker than
anything else, but frequently they advanced steadily for an hour
or more in perfect silence.</p>

<p>Sometimes the forest was open and free from undergrowth, then
it was cluttered up with running vines which would have annoyed
any one unaccustomed to them, but which proved no obstacle to
the Indians. In fact, they walked without showing the least regard
to them. Where Jack, if leading, would have lifted his feet, they
shoved ahead and without effort snapped and turned them aside
as though they were so many cobwebs.</p>

<p>"It all comes from training," concluded our friend, as he attempted
to catch a switch which swung back and struck him across the face;
"if I was alone, it would take me twice as long as it takes them,
and then I would fare worse than they do."</p>

<p>All at once, they came upon a creek. It was barely twenty feet
in width, but muddy, swift and deep. There was something impressive
in the speed with which the volume of water rushed through the
woods, as if fleeing in a panic from some peril at its heels.</p>

<p>The entire party came to a halt, ranging themselves along the
bank and surveying the turbid torrents, as though they wished
to talk with each other upon the best method of placing themselves
on the other side.</p>

<p>"I hope they won't swim it," Jack said to himself, "for their
people make no allowance for those that are not as skillful as
they, and I will get into trouble."</p>
