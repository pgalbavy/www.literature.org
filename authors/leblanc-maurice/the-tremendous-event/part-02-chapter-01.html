<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The expedition so gaily launched, in which Simon saw merely a
picturesque adventure, such as one reads of in novels, had suddenly
become the most formidable tragedy. It was no longer a matter of
cinema Indians and circus cow-boys, nor of droll discoveries in fabled
lands, but of real dangers, of ruthless brigands operating in regions
where no organized force could thwart their enterprises. What could
Isabel and her father do, beset by criminals of the worst type?
</p><p>"Good God!" exclaimed Simon. "How could Lord Bakefield be so rash as
to risk this journey? Look here, Antonio, the lady's-maid told you
that Lord Bakefield had gone to London by train, with his wife and
daughter. . . ."
</p><p>"A misunderstanding," declared the Indian. "He must have seen the
duchess to the station and arranged the expedition with Miss
Bakefield."
</p><p>"Then they're alone, those two?"
</p><p>"No, they have two men-servants with them. It's the four riders whose
tracks we picked up."
</p><p>"What imprudence!"
</p><p>"Imprudence, yes. Miss Bakefield told you of it in the intercepted
letter, counting on you to take the necessary measures to protect her.
Moreover, Lord Bakefield had given orders to his secretary, Williams,
and his valet, Charles, to join them. That is why those two poor
fellows were put out of action on the road by Rolleston and his six
accomplices."
</p><p>"Those are the men I'm afraid of," said Simon, hoarsely. "Have Lord
Bakefield and his daughter escaped them? Did the departure of which
Miss Bakefield speaks take place before their arrival? How can we find
out? Where are we to look for them?"
</p><p>"Here," said Antonio.
</p><p>"On this deserted wreck?"
</p><p>"There's a whole crowd inside the wreck," the Indian affirmed. "Here,
we'll begin by questioning the boy who is watching us over there."
</p><p>Leaning against the stump of a broken mast, stood a lean, pasty-faced
gutter-snipe, with his hands in his pockets, smoking a huge cigar.
Simon went up to him, muttering:
</p><p>"Very like one of Lord Bakefield's favourite Havanas. . . . Where did
you sneak that cigar?" he asked.
</p><p>"I ain't sneaked nuffin, sure as my name's Jim. It was giv' me."
</p><p>"Who gave it you?"
</p><p>"My old man."
</p><p>"Where is he, your old man?"
</p><p>"Listen. . . ."
</p><p>They listened. A noise echoed beneath their feet in the bowels of the
wreck. It sounded like the regular blows of a hammer.
</p><p>"That's my old man, smashin' 'er up," said the urchin, grinning.
</p><p>"Tell me," said Simon, "have you seen an elderly gentleman and a young
lady who came here on horseback?"
</p><p>"Dunno," said the boy, carelessly. "Ask my old man."
</p><p>Simon drew Antonio to where a companion-ladder led from the deck to
the first-class cabins, as a still legible inscription informed them.
They were going down the ladder when Simon, leading the way, struck
his foot against something and nearly fell. By the light of a
pocket-torch he saw the dead body of a woman. Though the face, which
was swollen and bloated and half eaten away, was unrecognizable,
certain signs, such as the colour and material of clothes, enabled
Simon to identify the French lady whom he had seen with her husband
and children. On stooping, he saw that the left hand had been severed
at the wrist and that two fingers were lacking on the right hand.
</p><p>"Poor woman!" he faltered. "Unable to remove her rings and bracelets,
the blackguards mutilated her!" And he added. "To think that Isabel
was here, that night, in this hell!"
</p><p>The corridor which they entered as they followed the sound of
hammering led them astern. At a sudden turning a man appeared, holding
in his hand a lump of iron with which he was striking furiously at the
partition-wall of a cabin. Through the ground-glass panes in the
ceiling filtered a pale white light which fell full upon the most
loathsome face imaginable, a scoundrelly, pallid, cruel face, with a
pair of bloodshot eyes and an absolutely bald skull dripping with
sweat.
</p><p>"Keep your distance, mates! Everybody do the best he can in his own!
There's plenty of stuff to go round!"
</p><p>"The old man ain't much of a talker," said the urchin's shrill voice.
</p><p>The boy had accompanied them and stood, with a bantering air, puffing
great whiffs of smoke. The Indian handed him a fifty-franc note:
</p><p>"Jim, you have something to tell us. Out with it."
</p><p>"That's all right," said the boy. "I'm beginnin' to twig this
business. Come along 'ere!"
</p><p>Guided by the boy, Antonio and Simon passed along other corridors
where they found the same fury of destruction. Everywhere
fierce-looking ruffians were forcing locks, tearing, splitting,
smashing, looting. Everywhere they were seen creeping into dark
corners, crawling on their hands and knees, sniffing out booty and
seeking, in default of gold or silver, bits of leather or scrap-metal
that might prove marketable.
</p><p>They were beasts of prey, carrion brutes, like those which prowl about
a battlefield. Mutilated and stripped corpses bore witness to their
ferocity. There were no rings left upon the bodies, no bracelets,
watches, or pocket-books; no pins in the men's ties; no brooches at
the women's throats.
</p><p>From time to time, here and there, in this workyard of death and
hideous theft, the sound of a quarrel arose; two bodies rolling on the
ground; shouts, yells of pain, ending in the death-rattle. Two
plunderers came to grips; and in a moment one of them was a murderer.
</p><p>Jim halted in front of a roomy cabin, the lower part of whose sloping
floor was under water; but on the upper part were several cane-deck
chairs which were almost dry.
</p><p>"That's where they spent the night," he said.
</p><p>"Who?" asked Simon.
</p><p>"The three what come on horseback. I was the first on the wreck with
my old man. I saw 'em come."
</p><p>"But there were four of them."
</p><p>"There was one what lay down outside to guard the horses. The other
three went to get something out of the rug where you didn't find
nuffin; and they 'ad their grub and slept in 'ere. This mornin', after
they left, my old man come to go through the cabin and found the old
gent's cigar-case here.
</p><p>"So they went away again?"
</p><p>The boy was silent.
</p><p>"Answer my question, can't you, boy? They left on horseback, didn't
they, before the others got here? And they're out of danger?"
</p><p>The boy held out his hand:
</p><p>"Two notes," he demanded.
</p><p>Simon was on the point of flying at him. But he restrained himself,
gave the boy the notes and pulled out his revolver:
</p><p>"Now then!"
</p><p>The boy shrugged his shoulders:
</p><p>"It's the notes is making me talk, not that thing! . . . Well, it's
like this: when the old gent wanted to start this mornin', he couldn't
find the old chap what was guarding the four horses near the stern of
the vessel, what you got up by."
</p><p>"But the horses?"
</p><p>"Gone!"
</p><p>"You mean, stolen?"
</p><p>"'Arf a mo! The old gent, his daughter and the other gent went off to
look for him, following the track of the 'osses alongside the wreck.
That took them to the other part of the <u>Queen Mary</u>, just to the
place where the starboard lifeboat was stove in. And then--I was on
deck, like I was just now, and I see the whole business as if it was
the movies--there was five or six devils got up from behind the
lifeboat and rushed at 'em; and a great tall bloke a-leadin' of 'em
with a revolver in each fist. I wouldn't say everythink passed off
quiet, not on neither side. The old gent, 'e defended himself. There
was some shootin'; and I see two of 'em fall in the scrimmage."
</p><p>"And then? And then?" Simon rapped out, breathlessly.
</p><p>"I don't know nuffin about then. A change of pickshers, like at the
movies. The old man wanted me for somefink; he took me by the scruff
o' the neck and I lost the end o' the film like."
</p><p>It was now Simon's turn to seize the young hooligan by the scruff of
the neck. He dragged him up the companion-ladder and, having reached a
part of the deck where the whole wreck was visible, he said:
</p><p>"It was over there, the lifeboat?"
</p><p>"Yuss, over there."
</p><p>Simon rushed to the stern of the vessel, slid down the rope and,
followed by the Indian and the boy, ran alongside the steamer to the
lifeboat which had been torn from the <u>Queen Mary's</u> deck and cast on
the sands some twenty yards from the wreck. It was here that the
attack had taken place. Traces of it remained. The body of one of
those whom the boy had described as "devils" was half-hidden in a
hollow.
</p><p>But a cry of pain rose from behind the boat. Simon and the Indian ran
round it and saw a man cowering there, with his forehead bound up in a
bloodstained handkerchief.
</p><p>"Rolleston!" cried Simon, stopping short in bewilderment. "Edward
Rolleston!"
</p><p>Rolleston! The man whom all accused! The man who had planned the whole
affair and recruited the Hastings blackguards in order to make a dash
for the wreck and steal the miniature! Rolleston, the murderer of
Dolores' uncle, the murderer of William and Charles! Rolleston,
Isabel's persecutor!
</p><p>Nevertheless Simon hesitated, profoundly troubled by the sight of his
friend. Fearing an outburst of anger on the Indian's part, he seized
him by the arm:
</p><p>"Wait a moment, Antonio! . . . First, are you really certain?"
</p><p>For some seconds, neither stirred. Simon was thinking that
Rolleston's presence on the battle-field was the most convincing proof
of his guilt. But Antonio declared:
</p><p>"This is not the man I met in the corridor of the hotel."
</p><p>"Ah!" cried Simon. "I was sure of it! In spite of all appearances, I
could not admit. . . ."
</p><p>And he rushed up to his friend, saying:
</p><p>"Wounded, Ted? It's not serious, is it, old man?"
</p><p>The Englishman murmured:
</p><p>"Is that you, Simon? I didn't recognize you. My eyes are all misty."
</p><p>"You're not in pain?"
</p><p>"I should think I was in pain! The bullet must have struck against the
skull and then glanced off; and here I've been since this morning,
half dead. But I shall get over it."
</p><p>Simon questioned him anxiously:
</p><p>"Isabel? What has become of her?"
</p><p>"I don't know. . . . I don't know," the Englishman said, with an
effort. "No . . . no . . . I don't know. . . ."
</p><p>"But where do you come from? How do you come to be here?"
</p><p>"I was with Lord Bakefield and Isabel."
</p><p>"Ah!" said Simon. "Then you were of their party?"
</p><p>"Yes. We spent the night on the <u>Queen Mary</u> . . . and this morning we
were set upon here, by the gang. We were retreating, when I dropped.
Lord Bakefield and Isabel fell back on the <u>Queen Mary</u>, where it
would have been easier for them to defend themselves. Rolleston and
his men were not firing at them, however."
</p><p>"Rolleston?" echoed Simon.
</p><p>"A cousin of mine . . . Wilfred Rolleston, a damned brute, capable of
anything . . . a scoundrel . . . a crook . . . oh, a madman! A real
madman . . . a dipsomaniac. . . ."
</p><p>"And he's like you in appearance isn't he?" asked Simon, understanding
the mistake that had been made.
</p><p>"I suppose so."
</p><p>"And it was to steal the miniature and the pearls that he attacked
you?"
</p><p>"That . . . and something else that he's even more keen on."
</p><p>"What?"
</p><p>"He's in love with Isabel. He asked her to marry him at a time when he
hadn't fallen so low. Then Bakefield kicked him out."
</p><p>"Oh, it would be too awful," stammered Simon, "if that man had
succeeded in kidnapping Isabel!"
</p><p>He stood up. Rolleston, exhausted, said:
</p><p>"Save her, Simon."
</p><p>"But you, Ted? We can't leave you. . . ."
</p><p>"She comes first. He has sworn to have his revenge; he has sworn that
Isabel shall be his wife."
</p><p>"But what are we to do? Where are we to look for her?" cried Simon, in
despair.
</p><p>At that moment Jim came up, all out of breath. He was followed by a
man whom Simon at once recognized as a groom in Lord Bakefield's
service.
</p><p>"The bloke!" cried Jim. "The one what looked after the horses. . . . I
found him among the rocks . . . d'you see? Over there? They'd tied him
up and the horses were tied up in a sort of cave like. . . ."
</p><p>Simon lost no time:
</p><p>"Miss Bakefield?"
</p><p>"Carried off," replied the man. "Carried off . . . and his lordship as
well."
</p><p>"Ah!" cried Simon, overwhelmed.
</p><p>The man continued:
</p><p>"Rolleston is their leader, Wilfred Rolleston. He came up to me this
morning at sunrise, as I was seeing to the horses, and asked me if
Lord Bakefield was still there. Then, without waiting for an answer,
he knocked me flat, with the help of his men, and had me carried here,
where they laid an ambush for his lordship. They didn't mind what they
said before me; and I learnt that Mr. Williams, the secretary, and
Charles, my fellow-servant, who were to have joined us and increased
the escort, had been attacked by them and, most likely, killed. I
learnt too that Rolleston's idea was to keep Miss Bakefield as a
hostage and to send his lordship to his Paris banker's to get the
ransom. Later on, they left me alone. Then I heard two shots and, a
little after, they returned with his lordship and Miss Bakefield. Both
of them had their hands and feet tied."
</p><p>"At what time did all this happen?" asked Simon, quivering with
impatience.
</p><p>"Nine o'clock, sir, or thereabouts."
</p><p>"Then they have a day's start of us?"
</p><p>"Oh, no! There were provisions in the saddle-bags. They sat eating and
drinking and then went to sleep. It was at least two o'clock in the
afternoon when they strapped his lordship and Miss Bakefield to a
couple of horses and started."
</p><p>"In what direction?"
</p><p>"That way," said the man-servant, pointing.
</p><p>"Antonio," cried Simon, "we must catch them before night! The
ruffian's escort is on foot. Three hours' gallop will be enough.
. . ."
</p><p>"Our horses are badly done up," objected the Indian.
</p><p>"They've got to get there, if it kills them."
</p><p>Simon Dubosc gave the servant his instructions:
</p><p>"Get Mr. Rolleston under shelter in the wreck, look after him and
don't leave him for a second. Jim, can I count on you?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"And on your father?"
</p><p>"All depends."
</p><p>"Fifty pounds for him if the wounded man is in Brighton, safe and
sound, in two days' time."
</p><p>"Make it a hundred," said Jim. "Not a penny less."
</p><p>"Very well, a hundred."
</p><p>At six o'clock in the evening, Simon and Antonio returned to the
Indians' camp. They quickly bridled and saddled their horses, while
Old Sandstone, who was strolling around, ran up to them shouting:
</p><p>"My fault, Simon! I swear we are over my fault, the fault in the Paris
basin, which I traced to Maromme and near the Ridin de Dieppe . . .
the one whose fracture caused the whole upheaval. Get on your horse,
so that I may give you my proofs. There's a regular Eocene and
Pliocene mixture over there which is really typical. . . . Heavens,
man, listen to me, can't you?"
</p><p>Simon stepped up to him and, with drawn features, shouted:
</p><p>"This is no time to listen to your nonsense!"
</p><p>"What do you mean?" stammered the old fellow, utterly bewildered.
</p><p>"Mean? Why, shut up!"
</p><p>And the young man leapt into the saddle:
</p><p>"Are you coming, Antonio?"
</p><p>"Yes. My mates will follow our trail. I shall leave a mark from spot
to spot; and I hope we shall all be united again to-morrow."
</p><p>As they were starting, Dolores, on horseback, brought up her mount
alongside theirs.
</p><p>"No!" said Antonio. "You come on with the others. The professor can't
walk all the time."
</p><p>She made no reply.
</p><p>"I insist on your keeping with the others," repeated the half-breed,
more severely.
</p><p>But she set her horse at a trot and caught up with Simon.
</p><p>For more than an hour they followed a direction which Simon took to be
south by south-east, that is to say, the direction of France. The
half-breed thought the same:
</p><p>"The main thing," he said, "is to get near the coast, as our beasts
have only enough food to last them till to-morrow evening. The water
question also might become troublesome."
</p><p>"I don't care what happens to-morrow," Simon rejoined.
</p><p>They made much slower progress than they had hoped to do. Their mounts
were poor, spiritless stuff. Moreover, they had to stop at intervals
to decipher the tracks which crossed one another in the wet sand or to
pick them up on rocky ground. Simon became incensed at each of these
halts.
</p><p>All around them the scene was like that which they had observed early
in the afternoon; the land rose and fell in scarcely perceptible
undulations; it was a dismal, monotonous world, with its graveyards of
ships and skeleton steamers. Prowling figures crossed it in all
directions. Antonio shouted questions to them as he passed. One of
them said that he had met two horsemen and four pedestrians leading a
couple of horses on which were bound a man and a woman whose fair hair
swept the ground.
</p><p>"How long ago was this?" asked Simon, in a hoarse voice.
</p><p>"Forty minutes, or fifty at the most."
</p><p>He dug his heels into his horse's flanks and set off at a gallop,
stooping over the animal's neck in order not to lose the scoundrel's
track. Antonio found it difficult to follow him, while Dolores erect
in her saddle, with a serious face and eyes fixed on the distant
horizon, kept up with him without an effort.
</p><p>Meanwhile the light was failing, and the riders felt as though the
darkness were about to swoop down on them from the heavy clouds in
which it was gathering.
</p><p>"We shall get there . . . we must," repeated Simon. "I feel certain we
shall see them in ten minutes. . . ."
</p><p>He told Dolores in a few words what he had heard of Isabel's
abduction. The thought that she was in pain caused unendurable
torture. His overwrought mind pictured her a captive among savages
torturing her for their amusement, while her blood-bedabbled head was
gashed by the stones along the track. He followed in imagination all
the stages of her last agony; and he had such a keen impression of
speed contending with death, he searched the horizon with so eager a
gaze, that he scarcely heeded a strident call from the half-breed, a
hundred yards in the rear.
</p><p>Dolores turned and calmly observed:
</p><p>"Antonio's horse has fallen."
</p><p>"Antonio can follow us," said Simon.
</p><p>For a few moments, they had been riding through a rather more uneven
tract of land, covered with a sort of downs with precipitous sides,
like cliffs. A fairly steep incline led to a long valley, filled with
water, on the brink of which the bandits' trail was plainly visible.
They entered the water, making for a place on the opposite edge which
seemed to them, at a distance, to be trampled in the same way.
</p><p>The water, which barely reached the horses' hocks, flowed in a gentle
current from left to right. But, when they had covered a third of the
distance, Dolores struck Simon's horse with her long reins:
</p><p>"Hurry!" she commanded. "Look . . . on the left. . . ."
</p><p>On the left the whole width of the valley was blocked by a lofty wave
which was gathering at either end into a long, foaming breaker. It was
merely a natural phenomenon; as a result of the great upheaval, the
waters were seeking their level and invading the lower tracts.
Moreover, the flow was so gradual that there was no reason to fear its
effects. The horses, however, seemed to be gradually sinking. Dragged
by the current, they were forced to sheer off to the right; and at the
same time the opposite bank was moving away from them, changing its
aspect, shifting back as the new stream rose. And, when they had
reached it, they were still obliged, in order to escape the water,
which pursued them incessantly, to quicken their pace and trot along
the narrow lane enclosed between two little cliffs of dried mud, in
which thousands upon thousands of shells were encrusted like the cubes
of a mosaic.
</p><p>Only after half an hour's riding were they able to clamber to a
table-land where they were out of reach. It was as well, for their
horses refused to go any farther.
</p><p>The darkness was increasing. How were they to recover the tracks of
Isabel and her kidnappers? And how could their own tracks, buried
beneath this enormous sheet of water, be recovered by Antonio and his
men?
</p><p>"We are separated from the others," said Simon, "and I don't see how
our party can be got together again."
</p><p>"Not before to-morrow, at all events," said Dolores.
</p><p>"Not before. . . ."
</p><p>And so these two were alone in the night, in the depths of this
mysterious land.
</p><p>Simon strode to and fro on the plateau, like a man who does not know
on what course to decide and who knows, moreover, that there is no
course on which he can decide. But Dolores unsaddled the horses,
unbuckled the saddle-bags and said:
</p><p>"Our food will hold out, but we have nothing to drink. The spare
water-bottles were strapped to Antonio's saddle."
</p><p>And she added, after spreading out the two horse-rugs:
</p><p>"We will sleep here, Simon."
