<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was between Whitefield Street and the Tottenham Court Road,
in a ‘heavenly Mews,’ as he liked to call it (for he had a characteristic
weakness for philosophical paronomasia), that Casimir Lypiatt
lived and worked. You passed under an archway of bald and sooty
brick—and at night, when the green gas-lamp underneath the arch
threw livid lights and enormous architectural shadows, you could
fancy yourself at the entrance of one of Piranesi’s prisons—and
you found yourself in a long cul-de-sac, flanked on either side
by low buildings, having stabling for horses below and, less commodiously,
stabling for human beings in the attics above. An old-fashioned
smell of animals mingled with the more progressive stink of burnt
oil. The air was a little thicker here, it seemed, than in the
streets outside; looking down the mews on even the clearest day,
you could see the forms of things dimming and softening, the colours
growing richer and deeper with every yard of distance. It was
the best place in the world, Lypiatt used to say, for studying
aerial perspective; that was why he lived there. But you always
felt about poor Lypiatt that he was facing misfortune with a jest
a little too self-consciously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash’s taxi drove in under the Piranesian arch, drove
in slowly and as though with a gingerly reluctance to soil its
white wheels on pavements so sordid. The cabman looked round inquiringly.</p>

<p>"This right?" he asked.</p>

<p>With a white-gloved finger Mrs. Viveash prodded the air two or
three times, indicating that he was to drive straight on. Half-way
down the mews she rapped the glass; the man drew up.</p>

<p>"Never been down <em>’ere</em> before," he said, for the sake
of making a little conversation, while Mrs. Viveash fumbled for
her money. He looked at her with a polite and slightly ironic
curiosity that was frankly mingled with admiration.</p>

<p>"You’re lucky," said Mrs. Viveash. "We poor decayed gentlewomen—you
see what we’re reduced to." And she handed him a florin.</p>

<p>Slowly the taxi-man unbuttoned his coat and put the coin away
in an inner pocket. He watched her as she crossed the dirty street,
placing her feet with a meticulous precision one after the other
in the same straight line, as though she were treading a knife
edge between goodness only knew what invisible gulfs. Floating
she seemed to go, with a little spring at every step and the skirt
of her summery dress—white it was, with a florid pattern printed
in black all over it—blowing airily out around her swaying march.
Decayed gentlewomen indeed! The driver started his machine with
an unnecessary violence; he felt, for some reason, positively
indignant.</p>

<p>Between the broad double-doors through which the horses passed
to their fodder and repose were little narrow human doors—for
the Yahoos, Lypiatt used to say in his large allusive way; and
when he said it he laughed with the loud and bell-mouthed cynicism
of one who sees himself as a misunderstood and embittered Prometheus.
At one of these little Yahoo doors Mrs. Viveash halted and rapped
as loudly as a small and stiff-hinged knocker would permit. Patiently
she waited; several small and dirty children collected to stare
at her. She knocked again and again waited. More children came
running up from the farther end of the mews; two young girls of
fifteen or sixteen appeared at a neighbouring doorway and immediately
gave tongue in whoops of mirthless, hyena-like laughter.</p>

<p>"Have you ever read about the pied piper of Hamelin?" Mrs. Viveash
asked the nearest child. Terrified, it shrank away. "I thought
not," she said, and knocked again.</p>

<p>There was a sound, at last, of heavy feet slowly descending steep
stairs; the door opened.</p>

<p>"Welcome to the palazzo!" It was Lypiatt’s heroic formula of
hospitality.</p>

<p>"Welcome at last," Mrs. Viveash corrected, and followed him up
a narrow, dark staircase that was as steep as a ladder. He was
dressed in a velveteen jacket and linen trousers that should have
been white, but needed washing. He was dishevelled and his hands
were dirty.</p>

<p>"Did you knock more than once?" he asked, looking back over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"More than twenty times," Mrs. Viveash justifiably exaggerated.</p>

<p>"I’m infinitely sorry," protested Lypiatt. "I get so deeply absorbed
in my work, you know. Did you wait long?"</p>

<p>"The children enjoyed it, at any rate." Mrs. Viveash was irritated
by a suspicion, which was probably, after all, quite unjustified,
that Casimir had been rather consciously absorbed in his work;
that he had heard her first knock and plunged the more profoundly
into those depths of absorption where the true artist always dwells,
or at any rate ought to dwell; to rise at her third appeal with
a slow, pained reluctance, cursing, perhaps, at the importunity
of a world which thus noisily interrupted the flow of his inspiration.
"Queer, the way they stare at one," she went on, with a note in
her dying voice of a petulance that the children had not inspired.
"Does one look such a guy?"</p>

<p>Lypiatt threw open the door at the head of the stairs and stood
there on the threshold, waiting for her. "Queer?" he repeated.
"Not a bit." And as she moved past him into the room, he laid
his hand on her shoulder and fell into step with her, leaving
the door to slam behind them. "Merely an example of the mob’s
instinctive dislike of the aristocratic individual. That’s all.
‘Oh, why was I born with a different face?’ Thank God I was, though.
And so were you. But the difference has its disadvantages; the
children throw stones."</p>

<p>"They didn’t throw stones." Mrs. Viveash was too truthful, this
time.</p>

<p>They halted in the middle of the studio. It was not a very large
room and there were too many things in it. The easel stood near
the centre of the studio; round it Lypiatt kept a space permanently
cleared. There was a broad fairway leading to the door, and another,
narrower and tortuously winding between boxes and piled-up furniture
and tumbled books, gave access to his bed. There was a piano and
a table permanently set with dirty plates and strewed with the
relics of two or three meals. Bookshelves stood on either side
of the fireplace and lying on the floor were still more books,
piles on dusty piles. Mrs. Viveash stood looking at the picture
on the easel (abstract again—she didn’t like it), and Lypiatt,
who had dropped his hand from her shoulder, had stepped back the
better to see her, stood earnestly looking at Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"May I kiss you?" he asked after a silence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash turned towards him, smiling agonizingly, her eyebrows
ironically lifted, her eyes steady and calm and palely, brightly
inexpressive. "If it really gives you any pleasure," she said.
"It won’t, I may say, to me."</p>

<p>"You make me suffer a great deal," said Lypiatt, and said it
so quietly and unaffectedly, that Myra was almost startled; she
was accustomed, with Casimir, to noisier and more magniloquent
protestations.</p>

<p>"I’m very sorry," she said; and, really, she felt sorry. "But
I can’t help it, can I?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you can’t," he said. "You can’t," he repeated and
his voice had now become the voice of Prometheus in his bitterness.
"Nor can tigresses." He had begun to pace up and down the unobstructed
fairway between his easel and the door; Lypiatt liked pacing while
he talked. "You like playing with the victim," he went on; "he
must die slowly."</p>

<p>Reassured, Mrs. Viveash faintly smiled. This was the familiar
Casimir. So long as he could talk like this, could talk like an
old-fashioned French novel, it was all right; he couldn’t really
be so very unhappy. She sat down on the nearest unencumbered chair.
Lypiatt continued to walk back and forth, waving his arms as he
walked.</p>

<p>"But perhaps it’s good for one to suffer," he went on, "perhaps
it’s unavoidable and necessary. Perhaps I ought to thank you.
Can an artist do anything if he’s happy? Would he ever want to
do anything? What is art, after all, but a protest against the
horrible inclemency of life?" He halted in front of her, with
arms extended in a questioning gesture. Mrs. Viveash slightly
shrugged her shoulders. She really didn’t know; she couldn’t answer.
"Ah, but that’s all nonsense," he burst out again, "all rot. I
want to be happy and contented and successful; and of course I
should work better if I were. And I want, oh, above everything,
everything, I want you: to possess you completely and exclusively
and jealously and for ever. And the desire is like rust corroding
my heart, it’s like moth eating holes in the fabric of my mind.
And you merely laugh." He threw up his hands and let them limply
fall again.</p>

<p>"But I don’t laugh," said Mrs. Viveash. On the contrary, she
was very sorry for him; and, what was more, he rather bored her.
For a few days, once, she had thought she might be in love with
him. His impetuosity had seemed a torrent strong enough to carry
her away. She had found out her mistake very soon. After that
he had rather amused her: and now he rather bored her. No, decidedly,
she never laughed. She wondered why she still went on seeing him.
Simply because one must see some one? or why? "Are you going to
go on with my portrait?" she asked.</p>

<p>Lypiatt sighed. "Yes," he said, "I suppose I’d better be getting
on with my work. Work—it’s the only thing. ‘Portrait of a Tigress.’"
The cynical Titan spoke again. "Or shall I call it, ‘Portrait
of a Woman who has never been in Love?’"</p>

<p>"That would be a very stupid title," said Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"Or, ‘Portrait of the Artist’s Heart Disease’? That would be
good, that would be damned good!" Lypiatt laughed very loudly
and slapped his thighs. He looked, Mrs. Viveash thought, peculiarly
ugly when he laughed. His face seemed to go all to pieces; not
a corner of it but was wrinkled and distorted by the violent grimace
of mirth. Even the forehead was ruined when he laughed. Foreheads
are generally the human part of people’s faces. Let the nose twitch
and the mouth grin and the eyes twinkle as monkeyishly as you
like; the forehead can still be calm and serene, the forehead
still knows how to be human. But when Casimir laughed, his forehead
joined in the general disintegrating grimace. And sometimes even
when he wasn’t laughing, when he was just vivaciously talking,
his forehead seemed to lose its calm and would twitch and wrinkle
itself in a dreadful kind of agitation. ‘Portrait of the Artist’s
Heart Disease’—she didn’t find it so very funny.</p>

<p>"The critics would think it was a problem picture," Lypiatt went
on. "And so it would be, by God, so it would be. You <em>are</em>
a problem. You’re the Sphinx. I wish I were Œdipus and could kill
you."</p>

<p>All this mythology! Mrs. Viveash shook her head.</p>

<p>He made his way through the intervening litter and picked up
a canvas that was leaning with averted face against the wall near
the window. He held it out at arm’s length and examined it, his
head critically cocked on one side. "Oh, it’s good," he said softly.
"It’s good. Look at it." And, stepping out once more into the
open, he propped it up against the table so that Mrs. Viveash
could see it without moving from her chair.</p>

<p>It was a stormy vision of her; it was Myra seen, so to speak,
through a tornado. He had distorted her in the portrait, had made
her longer and thinner than she really was, had turned her arms
into sleek tubes and put a bright, metallic polish on the curve
of her cheek. The figure in the portrait seemed to be leaning
backwards a little from the surface of the canvas, leaning sideways
too, with the twist of an ivory statuette carved out of the curving
tip of a great tusk. Only somehow in Lypiatt’s portrait the curve
seemed to lack grace, it was without point, it had no sense.</p>

<p>"You’ve made me look," said Mrs. Viveash at last, "as though
I were being blown out of shape by the wind." All this show of
violence—what was the point of it? She didn’t like it, she didn’t
like it at all. But Casimir was delighted with her comment. He
slapped his thighs and once more laughed his restless, sharp-featured
face to pieces.</p>

<p>"Yes, by God," he shouted, "by God, that’s right! Blown out of
shape by the wind. That’s it: you’ve said it." He began stamping
up and down the room again, gesticulating. "The wind, the great
wind that’s in me." He struck his forehead. "The wind of life,
the wild west wind. I feel it inside me, blowing, blowing. It
carries me along with it; for though it’s inside me, it’s more
than I am, it’s a force that comes from somewhere else, it’s Life
itself, it’s God. It blows me along in the teeth of opposing fate,
it makes me work on, fight on." He was like a man who walks along
a sinister road at night and sings to keep up his own spirits,
to emphasize and magnify his own existence. "And when I paint,
when I write or improvise my music, it bends the things I have
in my mind, it pushes them in one direction, so that everything
I do has the look of a tree that streams north-east with all its
branches and all its trunk from the root upwards, as though it
were trying to run from before the Atlantic gale."</p>

<p>Lypiatt stretched out his two hands and, with fingers splayed
out to the widest and trembling in the excessive tension of the
muscles, moved them slowly upwards and sideways, as though he
were running his palms up the stem of a little wind-wizened tree
on a hilltop above the ocean.</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash continued to look at the unfinished portrait. It
was as noisy and easy and immediately effective as a Vermouth
advertisement in the streets of Padua. Cinzano, Bonomelli, Campari—illustrious
names. Giotto and Mantegna mouldered meanwhile in their respective
chapels.</p>

<p>"And look at this," Lypiatt went on. He took down the canvas
that was clamped to the easel and held it out for her inspection.
It was one of Casimir’s abstract paintings: a procession of machine-like
forms rushing up diagonally from right to left across the canvas,
with as it were a spray of energy blowing back from the crest
of the wave towards the top right-hand corner. "In this painting,"
he said, "I symbolize the Artist’s conquering spirit—rushing on
the universe, making it its own." He began to declaim:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Look down, Conquistador,<br/>
There on the valley’s broad green floor,<br/>
There lies the lake, the jewelled cities gleam,<br/>
Chalco and Tlacopan<br/>
Awaiting the coming Man;<br/>
Look down on Mexico, Conquistador,<br/>
Land of your golden dream.

</p>
</div>
<p>Or the same idea in terms of music——" and Lypiatt dashed to the
piano and evoked a distorted ghost of Scriabin. "You see?" he
asked feverishly, when the ghost was laid again and the sad cheap
jangling had faded again into silence. "You <em>feel</em>? The
artist rushes on the world, conquers it, gives it beauty, imposes
a moral significance." He returned to the picture. "This will
be fine when it’s finished," he said. "Tremendous. You feel the
wind blowing there, too." And with a pointing finger he followed
up the onrush of the forms. "The great southwester driving them
on. ‘Like leaves from an enchanter fleeing.’ Only not chaotically,
not in disorder. They’re blown, so to speak, in column of four—by
a conscious wind." He leaned the canvas against the table and
was free again to march and brandish his conquering fists.</p>

<p>"Life," he said, "life—that’s the great, essential thing. You’ve
got to get life into your art, otherwise it’s nothing. And life
only comes out of life, out of passion and feeling; it can’t come
out of theories. That’s the stupidity of all this chatter about
art for art’s sake and the æsthetic emotions and purely formal
values and all that. It’s only the formal relations that matter;
one subject is just as good as another—that’s the theory. You’ve
only got to look at the pictures of the people who put it into
practice to see that it won’t do. Life comes out of life. You
must paint with passion and the passion will stimulate your intellect
to create the right formal relations. And to paint with passion,
you must paint things that passionately interest you, moving things,
human things. Nobody, except a mystical pantheist, like Van Gogh,
can seriously be as much interested in napkins, apples and bottles
as in his lover’s face, or the resurrection, or the destiny of
man. Could Mantegna have devised his splendid compositions if
he had painted arrangements of Chianti flasks and cheeses instead
of Crucifixions, martyrs and triumphs of great men? Nobody but
a fool could believe it. And could I have painted that portrait
if I hadn’t loved you, if you weren’t killing me?"</p>

<p>Ah, Bonomelli and illustrious Cinzano!</p>

<p>"Passionately I paint passion. I draw life out of life. And I
wish them joy of their bottles and their Canadian apples and their
muddy table napkins with the beastly folds in them that look like
loops of tripe." Once more Lypiatt disintegrated himself with
laughter; then was silent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash nodded, slowly and reflectively. "I think you’re
right," she said. Yes, he was surely right; there must be life,
life was the important thing. That was precisely why his paintings
were so bad—she saw now; there was no life in them. Plenty of
noise there was, and gesticulation and a violent galvanized twitching;
but no life, only the theatrical show of it. There was a flaw
in the conduit; somewhere between the man and his work life leaked
out. He protested too much. But it was no good; there was no disguising
the deadness. Her portrait was a dancing mummy. He bored her now.
Did she even positively dislike him? Behind her unchanging pale
eyes Mrs. Viveash wondered. But in any case, she reflected, one
needn’t always like the people with whom one associates. There
are music halls as well as confidential boudoirs; some people
are admitted to the tea-party and the <em>tête-à-tête</em>, others,
on a stage invisible, poor things! to themselves, do their little
song-and-dance, roll out their characteristic patter, and having
provided you with your entertainment are dismissed with their
due share of applause. But then, what if they become boring?</p>

<p>"Well," said Lypiatt at last—he had stood there, motionless,
for a long time, biting his nails, "I suppose we’d better begin
our sitting." He picked up the unfinished portrait and adjusted
it on the easel. "I’ve wasted a lot of time," he said, "and there
isn’t, after all, so much of it to waste." He spoke gloomily,
and his whole person had become, all of a sudden, curiously shrunken
and deflated. "There isn’t so much of it," he repeated, and sighed.
"I still think of myself as a young man, young and promising,
don’t you know. Casimir Lypiatt—it’s a young, promising sort of
name, isn’t it? But I’m not young, I’ve passed the age of promise.
Every now and then I realize it, and it’s painful, it’s depressing."</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash stepped up on to the model’s dais and took her seat.
"Is that right?" she asked.</p>

<p>Lypiatt looked first at her, then at his picture. Her beauty,
his passion—were they only to meet on the canvas? Opps was her
lover. Time was passing; he felt tired. "That’ll do," he said
and began painting. "How young are you?" he asked after a moment.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five, I should imagine," said Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five? Good Lord, it’s nearly fifteen years since I was
twenty-five. Fifteen years, fighting all the time. God, how I
hate people sometimes! Everybody. It’s not their malignity I mind;
I can give them back as good as they give me. It’s their power
of silence and indifference, it’s their capacity for making themselves
deaf. Here am I with something to say to them, something important
and essential. And I’ve been saying it for more than fifteen years,
I’ve been shouting it. They pay no attention. I bring them my
head and heart on a charger, and they don’t even notice that the
things are there. I sometimes wonder how much longer I can manage
to go on." His voice had become very low, and it trembled. "One’s
nearly forty, you know...." The voice faded huskily away into
silence. Languidly and as though the business exhausted him, he
began mixing colours on his palette.</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash looked at him. No, he wasn’t young; at the moment,
indeed, he seemed to have become much older than he really was.
An old man was standing there, peaked and sharp and worn. He had
failed, he was unhappy. But the world would have been unjuster,
less discriminating if it had given him success.</p>

<p>"Some people believe in you," she said; there was nothing else
for her to say.</p>

<p>Lypiatt looked up at her. "You?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash nodded, deliberately. It was a lie. But was it possible
to tell the truth? "And then there is the future," she reassured
him, and her faint death-bed voice seemed to prophesy with a perfect
certainty. "You’re not forty yet; you’ve got twenty, thirty years
of work in front of you. And there were others, after all, who
had to wait—a long time—sometimes till after they were dead. Great
men; Blake, for instance...." She felt positively ashamed; it
was like a little talk by Doctor Frank Crane. But she felt still
more ashamed, when she saw that Casimir had begun to cry and that
the tears were rolling, one after another, slowly down his face.</p>

<p>He put down his palette, he stepped on to the dais, he came and
knelt at Mrs. Viveash’s feet. He took one of her hands between
his own and he bent over it, pressing it to his forehead, as though
it were a charm against unhappy thoughts, sometimes kissing it;
soon it was wet with tears. He wept almost in silence.</p>

<p>"It’s all right," Mrs. Viveash kept repeating, "it’s all right,"
and she laid her free hand on his bowed head, she patted it comfortingly
as one might pat the head of a large dog that comes and thrusts
its muzzle between one’s knees. She felt, even as she made it,
how meaningless and unintimate the gesture was. If she had liked
him, she would have run her fingers through his hair; but somehow
his hair rather disgusted her. "It’s all right, all right." But,
of course, it wasn’t all right; and she was comforting him under
false pretences and he was kneeling at the feet of somebody who
simply wasn’t there—so utterly detached, so far away she was from
all this scene and all his misery.</p>

<p>"You’re the only person," he said at last, "who cares or understands."</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash could almost have laughed.</p>

<p>He began once more to kiss her hand.</p>

<p>"Beautiful and enchanting Myra—you were always that. But now
you’re good and dear as well, now I know you’re kind."</p>

<p>"Poor Casimir!" she said. Why was it that people always got involved
in one’s life? If only one could manage things on the principle
of the railways! Parallel tracks—that was the thing. For a few
miles you’d be running at the same speed. There’d be delightful
conversation out of the windows; you’d exchange the omelette in
your restaurant car for the vol-au-vent in theirs. And when you’d
said all there was to say, you’d put on a little more steam, wave
your hand, blow a kiss and away you’d go, forging ahead along
the smooth, polished rails. But instead of that, there were these
dreadful accidents; the points were wrongly set, the trains came
crashing together; or people jumped on as you were passing through
the stations and made a nuisance of themselves and wouldn’t allow
themselves to be turned off. Poor Casimir! But he irritated her,
he was a horrible bore. She ought to have stopped seeing him.</p>

<p>"You can’t wholly dislike me, then?"</p>

<p>"But of course not, my poor Casimir!"</p>

<p>"If you knew how horribly I loved you!" He looked up at her despairingly.</p>

<p>"But what’s the good?" said Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"Have you ever known what it’s like to love some one so much
that you feel you could die of it? So that it hurts all the time.
As though there were a wound. Have you ever known that?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash smiled her agonizing smile, nodded slowly and said,
"Perhaps. And one doesn’t die, you know. One doesn’t die."</p>

<p>Lypiatt was leaning back, staring fixedly up at her. The tears
were dry on his face, his cheeks were flushed. "Do you know what
it is," he asked, "to love so much, that you begin to long for
the anodyne of physical pain to quench the pain in the soul? You
don’t know that." And suddenly, with his clenched fist, he began
to bang the wooden dais on which he was kneeling, blow after blow,
with all his strength.</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash leant forward and tried to arrest his hand. "You’re
mad, Casimir," she said. "You’re mad. Don’t do that." She spoke
with anger.</p>

<p>Lypiatt laughed till his face was all broken up with the grimace,
and proffered for her inspection his bleeding knuckles. The skin
hung in little white tags and tatters, and from below the blood
was slowly oozing up to the surface. "Look," he said, and laughed
again. Then suddenly, with an extraordinary agility, he jumped
to his feet, bounded from the dais and began once more to stride
up and down the fairway between his easel and the door.</p>

<p>"By God," he kept repeating, "by God, by God. I feel it in me.
I can face the whole lot of you; the whole damned lot. Yes, and
I shall get the better of you yet. An Artist"—he called up that
traditional ghost and it comforted him; he wrapped himself with
a protective gesture within the ample folds of its bright mantle—"an
Artist doesn’t fail under unhappiness. He gets new strength from
it. The torture makes him sweat new masterpieces...."</p>

<p>He began to talk about his books, his poems and pictures; all
the great things in his head, the things he had already done.
He talked about his exhibition—ah, by God, that would astonish
them, that would bowl them over, this time. The blood mounted
to his face; there was a flush over the high projecting cheek-bones.
He could feel the warm blood behind his eyes. He laughed aloud;
he was a laughing lion. He stretched out his arms; he was enormous,
his arms reached out like the branches of a cedar. The Artist
walked across the world and the mangy dogs ran yelping and snapping
behind him. The great wind blew and blew, driving him on; it lifted
him and he began to fly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash listened. It didn’t look as though he would get
much further with the portrait. </p>
