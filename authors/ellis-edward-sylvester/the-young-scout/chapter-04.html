<p>Having descended the elevation to meet his three friends, Captain
Freeman, like them, was on a broad open plain, which bore some
suggestion of a valley. For a mile to the westward a ridge rose
to a height of several hundred feet. On the other side of this
ridge and close to it, wound a tributary of the Salt River. The
stream was narrow, but of uncertain depth, being shallow in many
places, while in others it could be crossed only by swimming.</p>

<p>To the westward the sandy plain extended, slightly undulating,
until it faded from view in the distant horizon. Ten miles to
the northeast was Fort Reno, and at a somewhat less distance,
and almost due south, in the Sutra Valley, were the ranches of
Captain Freeman and his friend Captain Murray, a Union veteran
of the war. The two were strongly attached to each other and their
families were intimate.</p>

<p>The reader will note the peculiar condition of things. If Geronimo
or any of his fierce Apaches made a raid into the section, they
would come from the westward, that is from the direction of Prescott
or Phœnix, or possibly from the south. Should they succeed in
passing the scouts that were out searching for them, the country
to the east would be exposed, and in that section were a number
of families, besides the two already named.</p>

<p>The great point, therefore, was to prevent the red men from penetrating
so far to the east. If they could be checked or turned back, the
scattered settlers would be safe but if the subtle and merciless
warriors flanked and passed in behind the soldiers and scouts,
serious mischief was sure to follow.</p>

<p>Tidings that Geronimo had left the reservation and was on the
war path was brought to Fort Reno by Mendez and Cemuri, who had
caught glimpses of several of the terrible raiders. It must not
be supposed that the colonel at the post contented himself with
sending out Lieutenant Decker and the two scouts alone, for that
would have been a piece of folly which the experienced Indian
fighter could not have committed. The supposition was that twenty
at least of Geronimo’s savage followers were ranging through the
country, and fully that number of white men and scouts were seeking
to checkmate them.</p>

<p>Decker and his two White Mountain guides formed only one of several
parties engaged on the same business. These parties expected to
keep within signalling or communicating distance and to join forces,
should it become necessary.</p>

<p>It has been said that while Lieutenant Decker and Captain Freeman
were holding their brief, spirited conversation, the two friendly
Apaches, sat their horses a short distance back, taking no part
in what was said, and for a time not even speaking to each other.</p>

<p>It would have been an interesting study, however, could any one
have watched them. They continually turned their heads, as if
trying to decide from what point of the compass, some slight almost
indistinguishable sound came. Their fine sense of hearing was
supplemented by a vision trained to the highest conceivable point,
and the keen black eyes were scarcely at rest for an instant.
Here, there, everywhere the penetrating glances shot, flitting
from point to point so quickly that it would seem they could not
grasp anything in their field of vision. All the same, however,
nothing escaped them.</p>

<p>It should be said that each of the four men was heavily armed.
Freeman and the young officer carried respectively a fine Winchester
and revolver, while the scouts had a formidable knife apiece in
addition to those weapons. The officer was in uniform, with his
sword, and Freeman’s costume suggested that of the professional
cowboy, with the broad-brimmed hat, loose, flowing shirt, cartridge
belt, excellent accouterments for his horse and large spurs for
himself.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "’Pache ober dere," was the reply, accompanied
by a pointing of his dusky finger at the ridge.—Page 35.</p>

<p>—<em>The Young Scout.</em>]</p>

<p>Mendez and Cemuri made some pretense of wearing civilized costume,
though their clothing could hardly have found a purchaser at a
second-hand sale. They never covered their heads, the long, coarse
black hair dangling about their faces and shoulders, with occasionally
a stained feather projecting from the crown. No paint disfigured
the countenances, which in fact could not have been made to look
uglier, but they had the cartridge belt, trousers and leggings
of the cowboy, most of which they would have been glad to dispense
with, but respect for the prejudices of their white brethren forbade.</p>

<p>Mendez was glancing toward all points of the compass, in that
quick, fitful way named, when he suddenly fixed his eyes on the
ridge to the westward. The fact that he did not change his gaze
for fully a minute was proof that something had attracted his
suspicion, and the faint exclamation which followed was proof
that an additional discovery had been made or that the suspicion
had become conviction.</p>

<p>The two white men instantly ceased talking and looked at him.
He did not turn his head, but peered with the same intensity as
at first.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Mendez?" asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Huh! ’Pache ober dere," was the reply, accompanied by a pointing
of his dusky finger at the ridge.</p>

<p>The other three were gazing in the same direction. Whether Cemuri
was equally fortunate could not be decided, for he gave no sign.
Neither the lieutenant nor captain detected anything with the
naked eye. The former drew out his fieldglass and directed it
at the point of interest, holding it leveled for several minutes.</p>

<p>The ridge like the plain was of sand. Not so much as a mesquite
bush was to be seen in any direction. Here and there grew a species
of sand grass, which seems to thrive where there is no earth nourishment,
while an occasional prickly cactus added to the desolateness of
the scene. There was nothing, therefore, to interfere with the
vision in any direction.</p>

<p>"I’m blessed if I can see anything unusual!" exclaimed the lieutenant,
passing his instrument to Freeman, with the remark, "Maybe you
can do better."</p>

<p>But the elder was no more successful than the younger. The latter
turned to Mendez, upon whose face were the faint indications of
a smile, and asked:</p>

<p>"What was it you saw?"</p>

<p>"One—two—tree ’Pache crawl up ridge—look ober—see dere eyes!"</p>

<p>It seemed incredible that the scout should have been able to
detect this fact—if it was a fact—at that distance, and yet we
have the record that Tycho Brahe, hundreds of years ago, did as
well in the same line and his visual powers could not have received
finer training than those of this White Mountain Apache.</p>

<p>"That won’t do," remarked the lieutenant, smilingly shaking his
head; "I had the record at the Point of being able to see a professor
further than any of the cadets, but I wasn’t equal to that."</p>

<p>"By heavens! he’s right!" exclaimed Freeman, who was still holding
the instrument pointed toward the ridge; "<em>he</em> doesn’t
need a spyglass."</p>

<p>"When you are through, let me try it again."</p>

<p>Freeman handed the glass to the lieutenant, who, being shown
the exact point toward which to direct it, did so with much doubt
and misgiving as to the result.</p>

<p>"Just as I supposed!" he muttered impatiently; "all imagination——"</p>

<p>When he first used the instrument he saw nothing besides the
bare, sandy elevation, but the words were yet in his mouth, when,
on the very crest of the ridge, something resembling a crow came
into sight. His first thought was that one of those birds or a
buzzard had hopped up from the other side, and was peering over,
but a moment’s scrutiny left no doubt that it was the head of
an Apache Indian, for it could belong to no other tribe and act
in this manner, the circumstances being as they were.</p>

<p>While Decker was studying the miscreant, who took care to expose
only his forehead down to his eyes, a second head appeared at
its side, the movements being precisely the same. The third, however,
of which Mendez had spoken, did not show itself.</p>

<p>The hostiles must have believed their presence unsuspected, or
at least not known of a certainty to the four horsemen, for they
lay on their faces and peered for a long time over the crest of
the elevation.</p>

<p>"I apologize, Mendez," said the lieutenant in his cheery manner;
"your powers of vision surpass anything I ever met. Will you please
tell me when the Apache on the right winks his eye?"</p>

<p>The scout, however, was too dignified to pay attention to this
attempted witticism. He gazed long and steadily at the two heads
faintly showing, and then Freeman, who was watching his countenance,
noted that his eyes were wandering along the ridge, evidently
in search of other ominous evidence.</p>

<p>All at once his gaze was arrested. He was looking at a point
fully a hundred yards to the right of where the crowns of the
enemies had been discerned and had detected something.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mendez?" asked the lieutenant, bringing his glass
again into use.</p>

<p>"’Pache," was the response; "look dere!"</p>

<p>The scout was right, as Decker was quick to learn. In this instance,
however, the buck did not content himself with simply peering
over the elevation. He seemed to be creeping forward until he
reached the crest of the ridge, when he raised the upper part
of his body, so that his face and shoulders were in sight. In
this posture he was evidently studying the four horsemen.</p>

<p>"Mendez," said the lieutenant; "you have the best pair of eyes
I ever heard of, but no person has eyes which cannot be helped
by a glass like this. You know that as well as I, for I’ve seen
you use a fieldglass. Now, since that buck off yonder isn’t afraid
to show his ugly countenance, see what you can make of him with
the aid of the instrument."</p>

<p>The scout complied with the request. As the officer had stated
the scout knew how to use the glass and it brought a revelation.
He leveled it at that hard, wrinkled, peering countenance lifted
above the distant ridge, and scrutinized it with the intensity
of a man seeking to read his own fate.</p>

<p>Only a few moments were thus occupied, when he passed the instrument
back to its owner who observed the peculiar half-smiling expression
on his usually stolid countenance.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen that buck before?" asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Seen him—one—two—tree—hundred times."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Geronimo!"</p>
