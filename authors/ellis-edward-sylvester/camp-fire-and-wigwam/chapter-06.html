<p>It was not to be supposed that a party of Indians could be checked
by a stream of water. If necessary they could swim across, but,
inasmuch as the party separated, and while several went up, the
rest walked down the stream, it was evident they were searching
for a more suitable spot in which to make the passage.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton followed the larger party, which had gone only
a few rods when a whoop from the others made known they had found
what was wanted. The rest immediately turned around and joined
them.</p>

<p>Jack saw at once that the means were provided for passing over
dry shod. A tree, some six or eight inches in diameter, lay with
the butt on one shore and the upper portion on the opposite bank.
A glance showed that it had been felled by the axe of some pioneer,
who probably thus formed a bridge for himself and friends. The
limbs had been trimmed away, and the abraded bark proved that
it had served a similar purpose for many wild beasts in passing
to and fro. The faded color of the gashes in the trunk showed
that a long time had passed since the bridge was made by the woodman's
axe.</p>

<p>Nothing better could be required, and several grunts of satisfaction
escaped the warriors during the minute they stood together viewing
the support that awaited the pressing of their feet.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton stepped forward, but one of the Indians grasped
his arm and drew him back so violently as almost to throw him
to the ground. The boy looked wonderingly in his face, and saw
that it was aglow with passion. He shook his head rapidly and
spoke fast and furious.</p>

<p>"I think I can guess what you mean," said Jack, stepping back,
so as to allow the others to precede him, "and I will now await
your commands."</p>

<p>He stood still until three had gone over, when they beckoned
him to follow. Jack had noticed that when the Indians were walking
on the log, they were obliged to move carefully, for their foothold
was narrow and the swift running current was apt to make one dizzy.
The lad, however, stepped forward without hesitation and advanced
slowly but with certainty.</p>

<p>The three warriors, who stood facing him on the shore, showed
that like Deerfoot the Shawanoe, they possessed a certain vein
of waggery, for at the moment Jack was over the middle of the
stream, one of them stooped, and, grasping the head of the trunk,
moved it quickly fully a couple of feet to the right, all three
bursting into an audible snicker at the same moment. The lad was
looking downward, meanwhile stepping carefully, when he glanced
across to learn the meaning of the action, the stooping Indian
being in his field of vision.</p>

<p>Jack understood the trick, but he was without the means of defeating
it. He stooped quickly with the intention of grasping the support
with both hands, but before he could do so, he lost his balance,
flung his arms aloft, and down he went with a loud splash that
sent the spray flying in all directions.</p>

<p>No audience of countrymen ever laughed more heartily at the ancient
jokes of a clown than did the five Indians when the boy disappeared
under the water, his eyes staring with the shock of affright which
came with his sudden contact with the current.</p>

<p>Jack was a capital swimmer, and he was satisfied there was no
wish to drown him; but he had scarcely passed below the surface,
when it occurred to him that there was a possibility of turning
the jest upon his captors. The water was very deep, and he kept
sinking until his feet softly touched the bottom. As he gave himself
the slight impulse which sent him upward again, he not only swam
swiftly with the rapid current, but moved as close to shore as
possible, and began creeping up the side of the bank.</p>

<p>In doing this, he over-estimated his own strength. It took him
a longer time to reach the surface than he calculated upon, and
he narrowly escaped strangling; but he resolutely held out to
the last second.</p>

<p>At the moment the rushing waters seemed to roar through his brain,
his crown cleft the surface, and he drew a deep inspiration of
the blessed air; but, even in that trying moment, he kept his
self-possession, and the breath was taken so softly that no ear
beside his own knew it.</p>

<p>He had emerged close to shore and directly under some overhanging
brush, which was not so dense as he could wish, since he was able
to see the warriors standing on the land and looking for him.
It followed, therefore, that if they should scrutinize the bank
very closely they would discover him; but the boy's hope lay in
their lack of suspicion that such an artifice was in his mind.</p>

<p>Several circumstances united to help the youth; the water was
roiled, as has already been said, while the friction of the swift
current against the shore made a noise which overcame the slight
ripple caused by his own movements. Only his nose and eyes were
kept above the surface, and the shrubbery which inclosed them
made a tolerable screen, though less effective than he desired.</p>

<p>Jack had landed, as may be said, a dozen yards below the log
from which he had been thrown and on the side from which he set
out, consequently he was opposite the five Indians who stood on
the shore. He was led to do this from a natural desire to get
as far away as he could from his captors, but it was a mistake
on his part, for had he crawled under the other bank he would
have been hidden altogether from the sight of the Indians.</p>

<p>Holding to a wire-like root with his left hand, he swung around
so as to face up stream, and, through the slight spaces in the
shrubbery kept his eyes fixed intently on the brawny red men.</p>

<p>[Illustration: A <em>NARROW ESCAPE</em>.]</p>

<p>Very soon the warriors looked at each other, and talked rapidly
and with growing excitement. There could be no doubt they were
discussing the unexpected shape matters had taken; the joke played
on their captive had proven a very serious matter to him. It must
have been that the pale-faced youth was unable to swim and was
drowned. The white warrior was a pappoose.</p>

<p>"By and by they will make search for me," was the thought of
Jack Carleton, still retaining his hold, "and then will come the
tug of war. It won't be the live boy they'll expect to find, but
his dead body, bobbing up and down and back and forth, and yet
I don't see why they will care to hunt me up."</p>

<p>Whatever might be the issue, Jack was warranted in feeling hopeful,
for he was sure the incident had taken a turn entirely unexpected
to the warriors.</p>

<p>"If I had only floated a little further down stream," he thought
more than once, noticing a sharp bend made by the current, "I
would have been in a good deal better situation than this, for
I would have been out of their sight altogether."</p>

<p>Several times he was on the point of letting go and dropping
further down, but he dreaded some mistake which would draw attention
to the spot. If he should try to swim under the surface, he might
be forced to come up too soon, or might strike some obstruction
in the stream that would fling him over as though he was a porpoise.
It was the fear of a catastrophe of this nature which held him
where he was, while he peered through the shrubbery like some
wild animal glaring out from his covert upon his enemies.</p>

<p>The face of every Indian was in sight, and he studied the expression
of each broad, coppery countenance. He knew they were talking
by the movements of the thin lips, and, despite the noise of the
rushing stream, he heard one of them grunt several times. This
particular warrior was shorter and more solidly built than the
rest, and appeared to be some kind of a leader, for he had the
most to say, and the boy noticed, while on the march, that he
directed the actions of the rest.</p>

<p>This Indian, as he stood, held his rifle in his right hand, while
the thumb of his left was hooked over the belt at his waist, which
supported his knife and tomahawk. His stomach protruded somewhat,
and, when he spoke in his sententious manner, the belt would rise
and sink in a spasmodic fashion which kept time with his words.</p>

<p>Jack kept close watch of the black eyes, which, like those of
professional hunters and scouts, were never at rest. They flitted
hither and thither, up and down stream and even to the rear, as
though danger were apprehended from that direction.</p>

<p>What the boy was expecting and dreading was a search on the part
of the Indians. None could know better than they how brief a time
is required for a person to drown, and they were not long in arriving
at the conclusion that the boy either was dead, or had left the
stream at a point below. Three savages walked hastily over the
creek on the log and began moving along shore, their serpent-like
eyes scanning every foot of land and water that came in their
field of vision. At the same time, the other two did the same
from the opposite shore, and Jack Carleton knew that the crisis
had come.</p>

<p>He felt quite secure against being seen by the two who were traveling
together, for he was able to dispose of the undergrowth so as
to increase its usefulness. While one hand held fast to the tough
root, he softly drew down the bush with the other, so that it
interposed between him and the couple who were held in such dread.
If the others should step to the edge of the stream and part the
bushes, it would be all up with the frightened lad.</p>

<p>The necessities of the case forced Jack to raise his head until
both ears were above the surface, and thus, while he employed
his eyes to follow the movements of the couple, he sought to use
his ears to discover the approach of the trio, though the rushing
torrent forbade full success in that respect.</p>

<p>The two warriors were in plain sight as they slowly picked their
way downward. Jack saw the upper parts of their bodies, and his
heart throbbed faster when they faced about and came down to the
edge of the water. However, they were still several yards above
him, so that he was quite certain they did not suspect his hiding-place.
When they halted and leaned over the stream, the fugitive gave
no thought to those who were undoubtedly much closer, but sank
until only forehead, eyes and nose were in the air, while the
scanty bush was drawn still closer to his face.</p>

<p>All at once, Jack's heart seemed to stand still; he saw that
one of the Indians was looking straight at the spot where he was
in hiding. The black orbs were centered upon him with such an
inquiring expression, that he was sure he had been discovered.
All hope was gone, until a moment after he observed that the savage
was peering at the undergrowth below him, as though suspicious
of everything which could afford any sort of a hiding-place.</p>

<p>"He didn't see me after all," was the conclusion of the delighted
boy, "and now if the others let me alone, I shall have a chance
to give them the slip."</p>

<p>Again the waists and shoulders of the two were observed moving
slowly among the trees and undergrowth, until they passed out
of sight, a considerable distance below the crouching fugitive.
The relief of the latter was unspeakable, though he could not
forget that other foes were also to be avoided.</p>

<p>But minute after minute passed, and still Jack saw and heard
nothing of the red men. With each passing minute his hopes rose,
until at the end of half an hour, he felt that his safety was
well nigh secured.</p>

<p>"They have concluded I was drowned and my body is not likely
to come to the surface for some time&mdash;anyway not until it is a
long way from this spot. If they don't return, I'm safe."</p>

<p>But a thrill of alarm passed through him more than once, when
he recalled that the strategy he had employed was of such a simple
nature that it ought to suggest itself to the red men. If such
was the case they would be certain to return to the fallen tree,
renew their search, and prosecute it with greater care.</p>

<p>It was the dread of the latter which led Jack to creep carefully
out of the stream, after he had been in hiding perhaps half an
hour. Of course his clothing was saturated, and he had become
chilled from his long submersion, so that his teeth rattled, and
he trembled in every limb. Extended flat on the ground, he crawled
with the utmost care until a couple of rods from the water. Then
he stopped and listened. He was so far from the stream that its
noise did not prevent him detecting any slight noise which might
have been made by some other cause, but he heard nothing at all.</p>

<p>There was still considerable undergrowth around him, so that
he felt screened from the observation of any other Indians wandering
in the vicinity.</p>

<p>"They thought they were very cunning," muttered Jack, with a
chuckle, "when they tumbled me into the water, but I played a
trick on them worth two of their kind. I only wish there was some
way of letting them know how completely I have outwitted them&#11834;"</p>

<p>A cold shiver passed down the spine of Jack Carleton, when he
distinctly heard a guttural, grunting laugh behind him. Turning
like a flash, he saw the five Indian warriors from whom, up to
that moment, he had believed he was free, standing within a rod,
and all grinning to an extent that seemed to take the corners
of their mouths around to their ears.</p>

<p>The truth broke upon Jack: the red men had never lost sight of
him, except for the moment he was under the water. They knew where
he was when he supposed himself invisible, and they had been amusing
themselves at his expense.</p>
