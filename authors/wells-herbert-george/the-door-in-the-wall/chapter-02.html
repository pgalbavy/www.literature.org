It was on the first day of the New Year that the announcement
was made, almost simultaneously from three observatories, that the
motion of the planet Neptune, the outermost of all the planets
that wheel about the sun, had become very erratic.  Ogilvy had
already called attention to a suspected retardation in its velocity
in December.  Such a piece of news was scarcely calculated to
interest a world the greater portion of whose inhabitants were
unaware of the existence of the planet Neptune, nor outside the
astronomical profession did the subsequent discovery of a faint
remote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet cause
any very great excitement.  Scientific people, however, found the
intelligence remarkable enough, even before it became known that
the new body was rapidly growing larger and brighter, that its
motion was quite different from the orderly progress of the
planets, and that the deflection of Neptune and its satellite was
becoming now of an unprecedented kind.
<P>
Few people without a training in science can realise the huge
isolation of the solar system.  The sun with its specks of planets,
its dust of planetoids, and its impalpable comets, swims in a
vacant immensity that almost defeats the imagination.  Beyond the
orbit of Neptune there is space, vacant so far as human observation
has penetrated, without warmth or light or sound, blank emptiness,
for twenty million times a million miles.  That is the smallest
estimate of the distance to be traversed before the very nearest of
the stars is attained.  And, saving a few comets more unsubstantial
than the thinnest flame, no matter had ever to human knowledge
crossed this gulf of space, until early in the twentieth century
this strange wanderer appeared.  A vast mass of matter it was,
bulky, heavy, rushing without warning out of the black mystery of
the sky into the radiance of the sun.  By the second day it was
clearly visible to any decent instrument, as a speck with a barely
sensible diameter, in the constellation Leo near Regulus.  In a
little while an opera glass could attain it.
<P>
On the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two
hemispheres were made aware for the first time of the real
importance of this unusual apparition in the heavens.  "A Planetary
Collision," one London paper headed the news, and proclaimed
Duchaine's opinion that this strange new planet would probably
collide with Neptune.  The leader writers enlarged upon the topic;
so that in most of the capitals of the world, on January 3rd, there
was an expectation, however vague of some imminent phenomenon in
the sky; and as the night followed the sunset round the globe,
thousands of men turned their eyes skyward to see--the old familiar
stars just as they had always been.
<P>
Until it was dawn in London and Pollux setting and the stars
overhead grown pale.  The Winter's dawn it was, a sickly filtering
accumulation of daylight, and the light of gas and candles shone
yellow in the windows to show where people were astir.  But the
yawning policeman saw the thing, the busy crowds in the markets
stopped agape, workmen going to their work betimes, milkmen, the
drivers of news-carts, dissipation going home jaded and pale,
homeless wanderers, sentinels on their beats, and in the country,
labourers trudging afield, poachers slinking home, all over the
dusky quickening country it could be seen--and out at sea by seamen
watching for the day--a great white star, come suddenly into the
westward sky!
<P>
Brighter it was than any star in our skies; brighter than the
evening star at its brightest.  It still glowed out white and
large, no mere twinkling spot of light, but a small round clear
shining disc, an hour after the day had come.  And where science
has not reached, men stared and feared, telling one another of the
wars and pestilences that are foreshadowed by these fiery signs in
the Heavens.  Sturdy Boers, dusky Hottentots, Gold Coast Negroes,
Frenchmen, Spaniards, Portuguese, stood in the warmth of the
sunrise watching the setting of this strange new star.
<P>
And in a hundred observatories there had been suppressed
excitement, rising almost to shouting pitch, as the two remote
bodies had rushed together; and a hurrying to and fro, to gather
photographic apparatus and spectroscope, and this appliance and
that, to record this novel astonishing sight, the destruction of a
world.  For it was a world, a sister planet of our earth, far
greater than our earth indeed, that had so suddenly flashed into
flaming death.  Neptune it was, had been struck, fairly and
squarely, by the strange planet from outer space and the heat of
the concussion had incontinently turned two solid globes into one
vast mass of incandescence.  Round the world that day, two hours
before the dawn, went the pallid great white star, fading only as
it sank westward and the sun mounted above it.  Everywhere men
marvelled at it, but of all those who saw it none could have
marvelled more than those sailors, habitual watchers of the stars,
who far away at sea had heard nothing of its advent and saw it now
rise like a pigmy moon and climb zenithward and hang overhead and
sink westward with the passing of the night.
<P>
And when next it rose over Europe everywhere were crowds of
watchers on hilly slopes, on house-roofs, in open spaces, staring
eastward for the rising of the great new star.  It rose with a
white glow in front of it, like the glare of a white fire, and
those who had seen it come into existence the night before cried
out at the sight of it.  "It is larger," they cried.  "It is
brighter!"  And, indeed the moon a quarter full and sinking in the
west was in its apparent size beyond comparison, but scarcely in
all its breadth had it as much brightness now as the little circle
of the strange new star.
<P>
"It is brighter!" cried the people clustering in the streets. 
But in the dim observatories the watchers held their breath and
peered at one another IT IS NEARER," they said.  "NEARER!"
<P>
And voice after voice repeated, "It is nearer," and the
clicking telegraph took that up, and it trembled along telephone
wires, and in a thousand cities grimy compositors fingered the
type.  "It is nearer."  Men writing in offices, struck with a
strange realisation, flung down their pens, men talking in a
thousand places suddenly came upon a grotesque possibility in
those words, "It is nearer."  It hurried along wakening streets, it
was shouted down the frost-stilled ways of quiet villages; men who
had read these things from the throbbing tape stood in yellow-lit
doorways shouting the news to the passersby.  "It is nearer." 
Pretty women, flushed and glittering, heard the news told jestingly
between the dances, and feigned an intelligent interest they did
not feel.  "Nearer!  Indeed.  How curious!  How very, very clever
people must be to find out things like that!"
<P>
Lonely tramps faring through the wintry night murmured those
words to comfort themselves--looking skyward.  "It has need to be
nearer, for the night's as cold as charity.  Don't seem much warmth
from it if it IS nearer, all the same."
<P>
"What is a new star to me?" cried the weeping woman kneeling
beside her dead.
<P>
The schoolboy, rising early for his examination work, puzzled
it out for himself--with the great white star shining broad and
bright through the frost-flowers of his window.  "Centrifugal,
centripetal," he said, with his chin on his fist.  "Stop a planet
in its flight, rob it of its centrifugal force, what then? 
Centripetal has it, and down it falls into the sun!  And this--!
<P>
"Do WE come in the way?  I wonder--"
<P>
The light of that day went the way of its brethren, and with
the later watches of the frosty darkness rose the strange star
again.  And it was now so bright that the waxing moon seemed but a
pale yellow ghost of itself, hanging huge in the sunset.  In a
South African City a great man had married, and the streets were
alight to welcome his return with his bride.  "Even the skies have
illuminated," said the flatterer.  Under Capricorn, two negro
lovers, daring the wild beasts and evil spirits, for love of one
another, crouched together in a cane brake where the fire-flies
hovered.  "That is our star," they whispered, and felt strangely
comforted by the sweet brilliance of its light.
<P>
The master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed
the papers from him.  His calculations were already finished.  In
a small white phial there still remained a little of the drug that
had kept him awake and active for four long nights.  Each day,
serene, explicit, patient as ever, he had given his lecture to his
students, and then had come back at once to this momentous
calculation.  His face was grave, a little drawn and hectic from
his drugged activity.  For some time he seemed lost in thought. 
Then he went to the window, and the blind went up with a click. 
Half way up the sky, over the clustering roofs, chimneys and
steeples of the city, hung the star.
<P>
He looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave
enemy.  "You may kill me," he said after a silence.  "But I can
hold you--and all the universe for that matter--in the grip of this
little brain.  I would not change.  Even now."
<P>
He looked at the little phial.  "There will be no need of
sleep again," he said.  The next day at noon--punctual to the
minute, he entered his lecture theatre, put his hat on the end of
the table as his habit was, and carefully selected a large piece of
chalk.  It was a joke among his students that he could not lecture
without that piece of chalk to fumble in his fingers, and once he
had been stricken to impotence by their hiding his supply.  He came
and looked under his grey eyebrows at the rising tiers of young
fresh faces, and spoke with his accustomed studied commonness of
phrasing.  "Circumstances have arisen--circumstances beyond my
control," he said and paused, "which will debar me from completing
the course I had designed.  It would seem, gentlemen, if I may put
the thing clearly and briefly, that--Man has lived in vain."
<P>
The students glanced at one another.  Had they heard aright? 
Mad?  Raised eyebrows and grinning lips there were, but one or two
faces remained intent upon his calm grey-fringed face.  "It will be
interesting," he was saying, "to devote this morning to an
exposition, so far as I can make it clear to you, of the
calculations that have led me to this conclusion.  Let us assume--"
<P>
He turned towards the blackboard, meditating a diagram in the
way that was usual to him.  "What was that about 'lived in vain?'"
whispered one student to another.  "Listen," said the other,
nodding towards the lecturer.
<P>
And presently they began to understand.
<P>
That night the star rose later, for its proper eastward motion
had carried it some way across Leo towards Virgo, and its
brightness was so great that the sky became a luminous blue as it
rose, and every star was hidden in its turn, save only Jupiter near
the zenith, Capella, Aldebaran, Sirius and the pointers of the
Bear.  It was very white and beautiful.  In many parts of the world
that night a pallid halo encircled it about.  It was perceptibly
larger; in the clear refractive sky of the tropics it seemed as if
it were nearly a quarter the size of the moon.  The frost was still
on the ground in England, but the world was as brightly lit as if
it were midsummer moonlight.  One could see to read quite ordinary
print by that cold clear light, and in the cities the lamps burnt
yellow and wan.
<P>
And everywhere the world was awake that night, and throughout
Christendom a sombre murmur hung in the keen air over the country
side like the belling of bees in the heather, and this murmurous
tumult grew to a clangour in the cities.  It was the tolling of the
bells in a million belfry towers and steeples, summoning the people
to sleep no more, to sin no more, but to gather in their churches
and pray.  And overhead, growing larger and brighter as the earth
rolled on its way and the night passed, rose the dazzling star.
<P>
And the streets and houses were alight in all the cities, the
shipyards glared, and whatever roads led to high country were lit
and crowded all night long.  And in all the seas about the
civilised lands, ships with throbbing engines, and ships with
bellying sails, crowded with men and living creatures, were
standing out to ocean and the north.  For already the warning of
the master mathematician had been telegraphed all over the world,
and translated into a hundred tongues.  The new planet and Neptune,
locked in a fiery embrace, were whirling headlong, ever faster and
faster towards the sun.  Already every second this blazing mass
flew a hundred miles, and every second its terrific velocity
increased.  As it flew now, indeed, it must pass a hundred million
of miles wide of the earth and scarcely affect it.  But near its
destined path, as yet only slightly perturbed, spun the mighty
planet Jupiter and his moons sweeping splendid round the sun.  
Every moment now the attraction between the fiery star and the
greatest of the planets grew stronger.  And the result of that
attraction?  Inevitably Jupiter would be deflected from its orbit
into an elliptical path, and the burning star, swung by his
attraction wide of its sunward rush, would "describe a curved path"
and perhaps collide with, and certainly pass very close to, our
earth.  "Earthquakes, volcanic outbreaks, cyclones, sea waves,
floods, and a steady rise in temperature to I know not what
limit"--so prophesied the master mathematician.
<P>
And overhead, to carry out his words, lonely and cold and
livid, blazed the star of the coming doom.
<P>
To many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached, it
seemed that it was visibly approaching.  And that night, too, the
weather changed, and the frost that had gripped all Central Europe
and France and England softened towards a thaw.
<P>
But you must not imagine because I have spoken of people
praying through the night and people going aboard ships and people
fleeing toward mountainous country that the whole world was already
in a terror because of the star.  As a matter of fact, use and wont
still ruled the world, and save for the talk of idle moments and
the splendour of the night, nine human beings out of ten were still
busy at their common occupations.  In all the cities the shops,
save one here and there, opened and closed at their proper hours,
the doctor and the undertaker plied their trades, the workers
gathered in the factories, soldiers drilled, scholars studied,
lovers sought one another, thieves lurked and fled, politicians
planned their schemes.  The presses of the newspapers roared
through the night, and many a priest of this church and that would
not open his holy building to further what he considered a foolish
panic.  The newspapers insisted on the lesson of the year 1000--for
then, too, people had anticipated the end.  The star was no
star--mere gas--a comet; and were it a star it could not possibly
strike the earth.  There was no precedent for such a thing.  Common
sense was sturdy everywhere, scornful, jesting, a little inclined
to persecute the
obdurate fearful.  That night, at seven-fifteen by Greenwich time,
the star would be at its nearest to Jupiter.  Then the world would
see the turn things would take.  The master mathematician's grim
warnings were treated by many as so much mere elaborate
self-advertisement.  Common sense at last, a little heated by
argument, signified its unalterable convictions by going to bed. 
So, too, barbarism and savagery, already tired of the novelty, went
about their nightly business, and save for a howling dog here and
there, the beast world left the star unheeded.
<P>
And yet, when at last the watchers in the European States saw
the star rise, an hour later it is true, but no larger than it had
been the night before, there were still plenty awake to laugh at
the master mathematician--to take the danger as if it had passed.
<P>
But hereafter the laughter ceased.  The star grew--it grew
with a terrible steadiness hour after hour, a little larger each
hour, a little nearer the midnight zenith, and brighter and
brighter, until it had turned night into a second day.  Had it come
straight to the earth instead of in a curved path, had it lost no
velocity to Jupiter, it must have leapt the intervening gulf in a
day, but as it was it took five days altogether to come by our
planet.  The next night it had become a third the size of the moon
before it set to English eyes, and the thaw was assured.  It rose
over America near the size of the moon, but blinding white to look
at, and HOT; and a breath of hot wind blew now with its
rising and gathering strength, and in Virginia, and Brazil, and
down the St. Lawrence valley, it shone intermittently through a
driving reek of thunder-clouds, flickering violet lightning,
and hail unprecedented.  In Manitoba was a thaw and devastating
floods.  And upon all the mountains of the earth the snow and ice
began to melt that night, and all the rivers coming out of high
country flowed thick and turbid, and soon--in their upper reaches
--with swirling trees and the bodies of beasts and men.  They rose
steadily, steadily in the ghostly brilliance, and came trickling
over their banks at last, behind the flying population of their
valleys.
<P>
And along the coast of Argentina and up the South Atlantic the
tides were higher than had ever been in the memory of man, and the
storms drove the waters in many cases scores of miles inland,
drowning whole cities.  And so great grew the heat during the night
that the rising of the sun was like the coming of a shadow.  The
earthquakes began and grew until all down America from the Arctic
Circle to Cape Horn, hillsides were sliding, fissures were opening,
and houses and walls crumbling to destruction.  The whole side of
Cotopaxi slipped out in one vast convulsion, and a tumult of lava
poured out so high and broad and swift and liquid that in one day
it reached the sea.
<P>
So the star, with the wan moon in its wake, marched across the
Pacific, trailed the thunderstorms like the hem of a robe, and the
growing tidal wave that toiled behind it, frothing and eager,
poured over island and island and swept them clear of men.  Until
that wave came at last--in a blinding light and with the breath of
a furnace, swift and terrible it came--a wall of water, fifty feet
high, roaring hungrily, upon the long coasts of Asia, and swept
inland across the plains of China.  For a space the star, hotter
now and larger and brighter than the sun in its strength, showed
with pitiless brilliance the wide and populous country; towns and
villages with their pagodas and trees, roads, wide cultivated
fields, millions of sleepless people staring in helpless terror at
the incandescent sky; and then, low and growing, came the murmur of
the flood.  And thus it was with millions of men that night--a
flight nowhither, with limbs heavy with heat and breath fierce and
scant, and the flood like a wall swift and white behind.  And then
death.
<P>
China was lit glowing white, but over Japan and Java and all
the islands of Eastern Asia the great star was a ball of dull red
fire because of the steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were
spouting forth to salute its coming.  Above was the lava, hot gases
and ash, and below the seething floods, and the whole earth swayed
and rumbled with the earthquake shocks.  Soon the immemorial snows
of Thibet and the Himalaya were melting and pouring down by ten
million deepening converging channels upon the plains of Burmah and
Hindostan.  The tangled summits of the Indian jungles were aflame
in a thousand places, and below the hurrying waters around the
stems were dark objects that still struggled feebly and reflected
the blood-red tongues of fire.  And in a rudderless confusion a
multitude of men and women fled down the broad river-ways to that
one last hope of men--the open sea.
<P>
Larger grew the star, and larger, hotter, and brighter with a
terrible swiftness now.  The tropical ocean had lost its
phosphorescence, and the whirling steam rose in ghostly wreaths
from the black waves that plunged incessantly, speckled with
storm-tossed ships.
<P>
And then came a wonder.  It seemed to those who in Europe
watched for the rising of the star that the world must have ceased
its rotation.  In a thousand open spaces of down and upland the
people who had fled thither from the floods and the falling houses
and sliding slopes of hill watched for that rising in vain.  Hour
followed hour through a terrible suspense, and the star rose not. 
Once again men set their eyes upon the old constellations they had
counted lost to them forever.  In England it was hot and clear
overhead, though the ground quivered perpetually, but in the
tropics, Sirius and Capella and Aldebaran showed through a veil of
steam.  And when at last the great star rose near ten hours late,
the sun rose close upon it, and in the centre of its white heart
was a disc of black.
<P>
Over Asia it was the star had begun to fall behind the
movement of the sky, and then suddenly, as it hung over India, its
light had been veiled.  All the plain of India from the mouth of
the Indus to the mouths of the Ganges was a shallow waste of
shining water that night, out of which rose temples and palaces,
mounds and hills, black with people.  Every minaret was a
clustering mass of people, who fell one by one into the turbid
waters, as heat and terror overcame them.  The whole land seemed
a-wailing and suddenly there swept a shadow across that furnace of
despair, and a breath of cold wind, and a gathering of clouds, out
of the cooling air.  Men looking up, near blinded, at the star, saw
that a black disc was creeping across the light.  It was the moon,
coming between the star and the earth.  And even as men cried to
God at this respite, out of the East with a strange inexplicable
swiftness sprang the sun.  And then star, sun and moon rushed
together across the heavens.
<P>
So it was that presently, to the European watchers, star and
sun rose close upon each other, drove headlong for a space and then
slower, and at last came to rest, star and sun merged into one
glare of flame at the zenith of the sky.  The moon no longer
eclipsed the star but was lost to sight in the brilliance of the
sky.  And though those who were still alive regarded it for the
most part with that dull stupidity that hunger, fatigue, heat and
despair engender, there were still men who could perceive the
meaning of these signs.  Star and earth had been at their nearest,
had swung about one another, and the star had passed.  Already it
was receding, swifter and swifter, in the last stage of its
headlong journey downward into the sun.
<P>
And then the clouds gathered, blotting out the vision of the
sky, the thunder and lightning wove a garment round the world; all
over the earth was such a downpour of rain as men had never before
seen, and where the volcanoes flared red against the cloud canopy
there descended torrents of mud.  Everywhere the waters were
pouring off the land, leaving mud-silted ruins, and the earth
littered like a storm-worn beach with all that had floated, and the
dead bodies of the men and brutes, its children.  For days the
water streamed off the land, sweeping away soil and trees and
houses in the way, and piling huge dykes and scooping out Titanic
gullies
over the country side.  Those were the days of darkness that
followed the
star and the heat.  All through them, and for many weeks and
months, the
earthquakes continued.
<P>
But the star had passed, and men, hunger-driven and gathering
courage only slowly, might creep back to their ruined cities,
buried granaries, and sodden fields.  Such few ships as had escaped
the storms of that time came stunned and shattered and sounding
their way cautiously through the new marks and shoals of once
familiar ports.  And as the storms subsided men perceived that
everywhere the days were hotter than of yore, and the sun larger,
and the moon, shrunk to a third of its former size, took now
fourscore days between its new and new.
<P>
But of the new brotherhood that grew presently among men, of
the saving of laws and books and machines, of the strange change
that had come over Iceland and Greenland and the shores of Baffin's
Bay, so that the sailors coming there presently found them green
and gracious, and could scarce believe their eyes, this story does
not tell.  Nor of the movement of mankind now that the earth was
hotter, northward and southward towards the poles of the earth.  It
concerns itself only with the coming and the passing of the Star.
<P>
The Martian astronomers--for there are astronomers on Mars,
although they are very different beings from men--were naturally
profoundly interested by these things.  They saw them from their
own standpoint of course.  "Considering the mass and temperature of
the missile that was flung through our solar system into the sun,"
one wrote, "it is astonishing what a little damage the earth, which
it missed so narrowly, has sustained.  All the familiar continental
markings and the masses of the seas remain intact, and indeed the
only difference seems to be a shrinkage of the white discoloration
(supposed to be frozen water) round either pole."  Which only shows
how small the vastest of human catastrophes may seem, at a distance
of a few million miles.
