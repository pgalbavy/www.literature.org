<p>It was borne in upon Gideon Landon when he rounded the half century
mark that he must let up in his intense application to his vast
moneyed interests or break down. He hated to think of stopping,
even for a brief season, but nature gave her unerring warning
and the specialist whom he consulted spoke tersely and to the
point:</p>

<p>"Take a vacation every year or die."</p>

<p>The capitalist recalled the habit of Bismarck, the great German
Chancellor, who when worn out by the crushing cares of office
hied away to his cabin in the pine woods, and gave orders to the
sentinels at the gate to shoot all visitors unless they came directly
from the King. So Landon built him a palatial bungalow, as he
called it, near the southern end of Southport Island. The logs,
all with their bark on, were a foot in diameter. From the outside,
the structure looked rough and rugged, and little more than a
good imitation of the dwellings of the New England pioneers; but
you had only to peep through the windows to note its splendid
furnishings. The finest of oriental rugs covered the floor; chairs,
tables and lounges were of the richest make, and the hundreds
of choice books in their mahogany cases cost twice as many dollars.
A modern machine furnished the acetylene light, the broad fireplace
could take in a half cord of wood when the weather was too cool
for comfort without it, and the beds on the upper floors were
as soft and inviting as those in the banker's city residence.
In short, everything that wealth could provide and for which there
was a wish was at the service of the inmates. He offered to send
a Chickering piano, but his wife did not think it worth while,
as she had no daughter and neither she nor her husband played.
Alvin had been taking lessons, for several years, but he objected
to keeping up practice during vacation and his parents decided
that his views were well founded.</p>

<p>"Here I shall loaf and rest for six weeks!" exclaimed the owner,
when the chauffeur carried him, his wife and two servants from
the town of Southport to the new home.</p>

<p>Alvin had gone thither the week before, and was looked after
by Pat Murphy, the caretaker, and his wife, who had been long
in the service of the banker.</p>

<p>One cause of Landon taking this step was the example of his old
friend Franklin Haynes, who had only one child &mdash;Chester,
with whom you have become acquainted. His enthusiastic accounts
of the tonic effect of the air, confirmed by his own renewed vigor
and tanned skin, decided the elder in his course. The Haynes bungalow
was smaller and more modest than Landon's, the two being separated
by a half mile of woods and open country. This, however, was of
no account, for the Landon auto skimmed over the interval in a
few minutes and the interchange of visits went on day and night.
The two families played bridge, dined, automobiled and cruised
with each other, while the boys were inseparable.</p>

<p>This went on for a fortnight, when a break came. Landon and Haynes
were interested in a large financial deal, in which the latter
believed he was wronged. There was a sharp quarrel and the friendly
relations between the two, including their wives, snapped apart.
All bridge playing ceased, and the long summer hours became so
deadly dull for Mrs. Landon that she gladly accepted the invitation
of a friend, hurried to New York and sailed with her for England
and the continent. Haynes spent his time mainly in fishing and
reading, but kept away from the home of his rich neighbor, who
was equally careful not to approach the other's residence.</p>

<p>Both men, however, were too sensible to let their quarrel affect
their sons. Not the slightest shadow could come between those
chums, who visited back and forth, just as they had always done,
stopping over night wherever convenient, and as happy as two clean-minded,
healthy youngsters ought to be. The Landon auto was at the disposal
of the lads whenever they cared for it, but the youths had become
interested in motor boating and gave little attention to the land
vehicle.</p>

<p>The unpleasant break to which I have referred occurred about
a fortnight before my introduction of the two lads to you. Landon
never had any liking for athletics or sport. Every favorable morning
his chauffeur took him to the little cluster of houses called
Southport, at the head of the island, where he got his letters,
New York newspapers and such supplies as happened to be needed
at the house. This used up most of the first half of the day.
After lunch he read, slept and loafed, never using the auto and
caring nothing for the motor launch which was continually cruising
over the water.</p>

<p>This went well enough for ten days or so, by which time the banker
grew restless. Sleeping so much robbed him of rest at night. Classic
works lost their charm and the "best sellers" bored him. He yawned,
strolled about his place, and pitied every man who was doomed
to spend his life in the Pine Tree State. True, he was gaining
weight and his appetite became keen, but he smoked too much and
was discontented. The lure of Wall Street was drawing him more
powerfully every day. He longed to plunge into the excitement
with his old time zest, and to enjoy the thrill that came when
success ended a financial battle.</p>

<p>He was lolling in his hammock at the front of the bungalow one
afternoon, trying to read and to smoke one of his heavy black
cigars, and succeeding in neither task, when Davis Dunning, his
chauffeur, glummer than usual because there was no excuse for
his taking any more joy rides, halted the machine at the side
of the roadway. Throwing out the clutch, he hurried up the walk
and handed his employer a telegram that had been 'phoned over
from Boothbay Harbor to Southport, where the chauffeur found it
awaiting him when he made his daily run thither, this time unaccompanied
by his employer.</p>

<p>No message could have been more welcome. It told the banker that
the recent stir in steel and other stocks made it necessary for
him to return to New York as soon as possible and to stay "a few
days." He was alert on the instant. If he could reach Portland
that evening he would board the express and be in New York the
next morning.</p>

<p>"It must be done!" he exclaimed, aware that there was no necessity
for such haste. Consultation with Dunning, however, convinced
him that the course for an automobile was too roundabout and there
was too much ferrying to make the hurried journey feasible. He
decided to go to Bath by steamer, and then by rail on the morrow,
easily reaching Portland in time for the ride by night to the
metropolis.</p>

<p>This gave him opportunity to explain matters to Alvin, who was
told to remain at Southport until the time came for him to re-enter
school. The son was sorry to lose the company of his father, whose
affection he returned, but it is not in boy nature to mourn for
one from whom he did not expect to be parted long. The only thing
in creation in which he felt pleasure and interest just then was
in sailing his motor boat.</p>

<p>At the time of leaving Southport, Mr. Landon expected to return
in the course of a week and said so to his son, but the call of
business was stronger than that of the fine woods and salt water
of Maine. He easily found the necessity for staying in New York
until the time remaining for his vacation was so brief that he
wrote Alvin it was not worth while to rejoin him.</p>

<p>So it came about that his son remained in the big bungalow, looked
after by two servants, not to mention Pat Murphy the caretaker
and his wife. Chester Haynes stayed with his parents in their
modest home a mile to the southward, while the irrepressible Mike
was at both homes more than his own. He had become as fond of
boating as his two friends and set out to learn all about the
craft. It did not take him long to become a good steersman and
by and by he could start and stop the <em>Deerfoot</em>, though
he shrank from attempting to bring her beside a wharf or float.
In threading through the shipping at the different harbors, either
Alvin or Chester took the wheel, one boy being almost equal in
expertness to the other, both in handling the launch and taking
care of the machinery.</p>

<p>There seemed no end to the romantic excursions that tempted the
young navigators forth. Sometimes they fished, but preferred to
glide through the smooth inland waters, where every scene was
new and seemingly more romantic than the others. They landed at
Pemaquid Beach and listened to the story of the old fort as told
by the local historian, who proved that the date was correct which
is painted on the stone wall and says a settlement was made there
before the one at Jamestown. They passed up the short wide inlet
known as John's River, and turning round cut across to the Damariscotta,
which they ascended to Newcastle, with picturesque scenery all
the way.</p>

<p>The boys were somewhat late in starting one morning and the sky
was threatening, but with the folding top as a protection if needed,
and the opportunity to halt when and wherever they choose, the
agreement was unanimous that they should go up the Sheepscot to
Wiscasset, eat dinner there and return at their leisure.</p>

<p>"It is well worth the trip," said Alvin, whose eyes sparkled
with the memory of the passage which he had made more than once.
Chester was equally enthusiastic.</p>

<p>"I'm riddy to sarve as a sacrifice," replied Mike, "as me friend
Terry McGarrity remarked whin he entered the strife that was to
prove which could ate the most mince pie inside of half an hour."</p>
