<P>D'Artagnan's apartment was not unoccupied, for the Comte de
la Fere, seated in the recess of a window, awaited him.
&quot;Well,&quot; said he to D'Artagnan, as he saw him enter.</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; said the latter, &quot;M. de Wardes has done me the honor
to pay me a visit, in company with some of his own friends,
as well as of ours.&quot; In fact, behind the musketeer appeared
De Wardes and Manicamp followed by De Guiche and Buckingham,
who looked surprised, not knowing what was expected of them.
Raoul was accompanied by two or three gentlemen; and, as he
entered, glanced round the room, and perceiving the count,
he went and placed himself by his side. D'Artagnan received
his visitors with all the courtesy he was capable of; he
preserved his unmoved and unconcerned look. All the persons
present were men of distinction, occupying posts of honor
and credit at the court. After he had apologized to each of
them for any inconvenience he might have put them to, he
turned towards De Wardes, who, in spite of his customary
self-command, could not prevent his face betraying some
surprise mingled with not a little uneasiness.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, monsieur,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;since we are no longer
within the precincts of the king's palace, and since we can
speak out without failing in respect to propriety, I will
inform you why I have taken the liberty to request you to
visit me here, and why I have invited these gentlemen to be
present at the same time. My friend, the Comte de la Fere,
has acquainted me with the injurious reports you are
spreading about myself. You have stated that you regard me
as your mortal enemy, because I was, so you affirm, that of
your father.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Perfectly true, monsieur, I have said so,&quot; replied De
Wardes, whose pallid face became slightly tinged with color.</P>
<P>&quot;You accuse me, therefore, of a crime, or a fault, or of
some mean and cowardly act. Have the goodness to state your
charge against me in precise terms.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In the presence of witnesses?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Most certainly in the presence of witnesses; and you see I
have selected them as being experienced in affairs of
honor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You do not appreciate my delicacy, monsieur. I have accused
you, it is true; but I have kept the nature of the
accusation a perfect secret. I entered into no details; but
have rested satisfied by expressing my hatred in the
presence of those on whom a duty was almost imposed to
acquaint you with it. You have not taken the discreetness I
have shown into consideration, although you were interested
in remaining silent. I can hardly recognize your habitual
prudence in that, M. d'Artagnan.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan, who was quietly biting the corner of his
mustache, said, &quot;I have already had the honor to beg you to
state the particulars of the grievances you say you have
against me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Aloud?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly, aloud.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In that case, I will speak.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Speak, monsieur,&quot; said D'Artagnan, bowing; &quot;we are all
listening to you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, monsieur, it is not a question of a personal injury
towards myself, but one towards my father.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That you have already stated.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but there are certain subjects which are only
approached with hesitation.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If that hesitation, in your case, really does exist, I
entreat you to overcome it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Even if it refer to a disgraceful action?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; in every and any case.&quot;</P>
<P>Those who were present at this scene had, at first, looked
at each other with a good deal of uneasiness. They were
reassured, however, when they saw that D'Artagnan manifested
no emotion whatever.</P>
<P>De Wardes still maintained the same unbroken silence.
&quot;Speak, monsieur,&quot; said the musketeer; &quot;you see you are
keeping us waiting.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Listen, then:  -  My father loved a lady of noble birth, and
this lady loved my father.&quot; D'Artagnan and Athos exchanged
looks. De Wardes continued: &quot;M. d'Artagnan found some
letters which indicated a rendezvous, substituted himself,
under disguise, for the person who was expected, and took
advantage of the darkness.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is perfectly true,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>A slight murmur was heard from those present. &quot;Yes, I was
guilty of that dishonorable action. You should have added,
monsieur, since you are so impartial, that, at the period
when the circumstance which you have just related, happened,
I was not one-and-twenty years of age.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Such an action is not the less shameful on that account,&quot;
said De Wardes; &quot;and it is quite sufficient for a gentleman
to have attained the age of reason, to avoid committing an
act of indelicacy.&quot;</P>
<P>A renewed murmur was heard, but this time of astonishment,
and almost of doubt.</P>
<P>&quot;It was a most shameful deception, I admit,&quot; said
D'Artagnan, &quot;and I have not waited for M. de Wardes's
reproaches to reproach myself for it, and very bitterly,
too. Age has, however, made me more reasonable, and above
all, more upright; and this injury has been atoned for by a
long and lasting regret. But I appeal to you, gentlemen;
this affair took place in 1626, at a period, happily for
yourselves, known to you by tradition only, at a period when
love was not over scrupulous, when consciences did not
distill, as in the present day, poison and bitterness. We
were young soldiers, always fighting, or being attacked, our
swords always in our hands, or at least ready to be drawn
from their sheaths. Death then always stared us in the face,
war hardened us, and the cardinal pressed us sorely. I have
repented of it, and more than that  -  I still repent it, M.
de Wardes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I can well understand that, monsieur, for the action itself
needed repentance; but you were not the less the cause of
that lady's disgrace. She, of whom you have been speaking,
covered with shame, borne down by the affront you brought
upon her, fled, quitted France, and no one ever knew what
became of her.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Stay,&quot; said the Comte de la Fere, stretching his hand
towards De Wardes, with a peculiar smile upon his face, &quot;you
are mistaken; she was seen; and there are persons even now
present, who, having often heard her spoken of, will easily
recognize her by the description I am about to give. She was
about five-and-twenty years of age, slender in form, of a
pale complexion, and fair-haired; she was married in
England.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Married?&quot; exclaimed De Wardes.</P>
<P>&quot;So, you were not aware she was married? You see we are far
better informed than yourself. Do you happen to know she was
usually styled `My Lady,' without the addition of any name
to that description?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I know that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good Heavens!&quot; murmured Buckingham.</P>
<P>&quot;Very well, monsieur. That woman, who came from England,
returned to England after having thrice attempted M.
d'Artagnan's life. That was but just, you will say, since M.
d'Artagnan had insulted her. But that which was not just
was, that, when in England, this woman, by her seductions,
completely enslaved a young man in the service of Lord de
Winter, by name Felton. You change color, my lord,&quot; said
Athos turning to the Duke of Buckingham, &quot;and your eyes
kindle with anger and sorrow. Let your Grace finish the
recital, then, and tell M. de Wardes who this woman was who
placed the knife in the hand of your father's murderer.&quot;</P>
<P>A cry escaped from the lips of all present. The young duke
passed his handkerchief across his forehead, which was
covered with perspiration. A dead silence ensued among the
spectators.</P>
<P>&quot;You see, M. de Wardes,&quot; said D'Artagnan, whom this recital
had impressed more and more, as his own recollection revived
as Athos spoke, &quot;you see that my crime did not cause the
destruction of any one's soul, and that the soul in question
may fairly be considered to have been altogether lost before
my regret. It is, however, an act of conscience on my part.
Now this matter is settled, therefore, it remains for me to
ask with the greatest humility, your forgiveness for this
shameless action, as most certainly I should have asked it
of your father, if he were still alive, and if I had met him
after my return to France, subsequent to the death of King
Charles I.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is too much, M. d'Artagnan,&quot; exclaimed many voices,
with animation.</P>
<P>&quot;No, gentlemen,&quot; said the captain. &quot;And now, M. de Wardes, I
hope all is finished between us, and that you will have no
further occasion to speak ill of me again. Do you consider
it completely settled?&quot;</P>
<P>De Wardes bowed, and muttered to himself inarticulately.</P>
<P>&quot;I trust also,&quot; said D'Artagnan, approaching the young man
closely, &quot;that you will no longer speak ill of any one, as
it seems you have the unfortunate habit of doing; for a man
so puritanically conscientious as you are, who can reproach
an old soldier for a youthful freak five-and-thirty years
after it happened, will allow me to ask whether you who
advocate such excessive purity of conscience, will undertake
on your side to do nothing contrary either to conscience or
the principle of honor. And now, listen attentively to what
I am going to say, M. de Wardes, in conclusion. Take care
that no tale, with which your name may be associated,
reaches my ear.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said De Wardes, &quot;it is useless threatening to no
purpose.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have not yet finished, M. de Wardes, and you must listen
to me still further.&quot; The circle of listeners, full of eager
curiosity, drew closer. &quot;You spoke just now of the honor of
a woman, and of the honor of your father. We were glad to
hear you speak in that manner; for it is pleasing to think
that such a sentiment of delicacy and rectitude, and which
did not exist, it seems, in our minds, lives in our
children; and it is delightful too, to see a young man, at
an age when men from habit become the destroyers of the
honor of women, respect and defend it.&quot;</P>
<P>De Wardes bit his lips and clenched his hands, evidently
much disturbed to learn how this discourse, the commencement
of which was announced in so threatening a manner, would
terminate.</P>
<P>&quot;How did it happen, then, that you allowed yourself to say
to M. de Bragelonne that he did not know who his mother
was?&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul's eye flashed, as, darting forward, he exclaimed,  - 
&quot;Chevalier, this is a personal affair of my own!&quot; At which
exclamation, a smile, full of malice, passed across De
Wardes's face.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan put Raoul aside, saying,  -  &quot;Do not interrupt me,
young man.&quot; And looking at De Wardes in an authoritative
manner, he continued:  -  &quot;I am now dealing with a matter
which cannot be settled by means of the sword. I discuss it
before men of honor, all of whom have more than once had
their swords in their hands in affairs of honor. I selected
them expressly. These gentlemen well know that every secret
for which men fight ceases to be a secret. I again put my
question to M. de Wardes. What was the subject of
conversation when you offended this young man, in offending
his father and mother at the same time?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It seems to me,&quot; returned De Wardes, &quot;that liberty of
speech is allowed, when it is supported by every means which
a man of courage has at his disposal.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tell me what the means are by which a man of courage can
sustain a slanderous expression.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The sword.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You fail, not only in logic, in your argument, but in
religion and honor. You expose the lives of many others,
without referring to your own, which seems to be full of
hazard. Besides, fashions pass away, monsieur, and the
fashion of duelling has passed away, without referring in
any way to the edicts of his majesty which forbid it.
Therefore, in order to be consistent with your own
chivalrous notions, you will at once apologize to M. de
Bragelonne; you will tell him how much you regret having
spoken so lightly, and that the nobility and purity of his
race are inscribed, not in his heart alone, but still more
in every action of his life. You will do and say this, M. de
Wardes, as I, an old officer, did and said just now to your
boy's mustache.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And if I refuse?&quot; inquired De Wardes.</P>
<P>&quot;In that case the result will be  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That which you think you will prevent,&quot; said De Wardes,
laughing; &quot;the result will be that your conciliatory address
will end in a violation of the king's prohibition.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not so,&quot; said the captain, &quot;you are quite mistaken.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What will be the result, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The result will be that I shall go to the king, with whom I
am on tolerably good terms, to whom I have been happy enough
to render certain services dating from a period when you
were not born, and who at my request, has just sent me an
order in blank for M. Baisemeaux de Montlezun, governor of
the Bastile; and I shall say to the king: `Sire, a man has
in a most cowardly way insulted M. de Bragelonne by
insulting his mother; I have written this man's name upon
the lettre de cachet which your majesty has been kind enough
to give me, so that M. de Wardes is in the Bastile for three
years.'&quot; And D'Artagnan drawing the order signed by the king
from his pocket, held it towards De Wardes.</P>
<P>Remarking that the young man was not quite convinced, and
received the warning as an idle threat, he shrugged his
shoulders and walked leisurely towards the table, upon which
lay a writing-case and a pen, the length of which would have
terrified the topographical Porthos. De Wardes then saw that
nothing could well be more seriously intended than the
threat in question for the Bastile, even at that period, was
already held in dread. He advanced a step towards Raoul,
and, in an almost unintelligible voice, said,  -  &quot;I offer my
apologies in the terms which M. d'Artagnan just now
dictated, and which I am forced to make to you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;One moment, monsieur,&quot; said the musketeer, with the
greatest tranquillity, &quot;you mistake the terms of the
apology. I did not say, `and which I am forced to make'; I
said, `and which my conscience induces me to make.' This
latter expression, believe me, is better than the former;
and it will be far preferable, since it will be the most
truthful expression of your own sentiments.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I subscribe to it,&quot; said De Wardes; &quot;but submit, gentlemen,
that a thrust of a sword through the body, as was the custom
formerly, was far better than tyranny like this.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, monsieur,&quot; replied Buckingham; &quot;for the sword-thrust,
when received, was no indication that a particular person
was right or wrong; it only showed that he was more or less
skillful in the use of the weapon.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur!&quot; exclaimed De Wardes.</P>
<P>&quot;There, now,&quot; interrupted D'Artagnan, &quot;you are going to say
something very rude, and I am rendering you a service by
stopping you in time.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is that all, monsieur?&quot; inquired De Wardes.</P>
<P>&quot;Absolutely everything,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, &quot;and these
gentlemen, as well as myself, are quite satisfied with you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Believe me monsieur, that your reconciliations are not
successful.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In what way?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because, as we are now about to separate. I would wager
that M. de Bragelonne and myself are greater enemies than
ever.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are deceived, monsieur, as far as I am concerned,&quot;
returned Raoul; &quot;for I do not retain the slightest animosity
in my heart against you.&quot;</P>
<P>This last blow overwhelmed De Wardes. He cast his eyes
around him like a man bewildered. D'Artagnan saluted most
courteously the gentlemen who had been present at the
explanation; and every one, on leaving the room, shook hands
with him; but not one hand was held out towards De Wardes.
&quot;Oh!&quot; exclaimed the young man, abandoning himself to the
rage which consumed him, &quot;can I not find some one on whom to
wreak my vengeance?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You can, monsieur, for I am here,&quot; whispered a voice full
of menace in his ear.</P>
<P>De Wardes turned round, and saw the Duke of Buckingham, who,
having probably remained behind with that intention, had
just approached him. &quot;You, monsieur?&quot; exclaimed De Wardes.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I! I am no subject of the king of France; I am not
going to remain on the territory, since I am about setting
off for England. I have accumulated in my heart such a mass
of despair and rage, that I, too, like yourself, need to
revenge myself upon some one. I approve M. d'Artagnan's
principles profoundly, but I am not bound to apply them to
you. I am an Englishman, and, in my turn, I propose to you
what you proposed to others to no purpose. Since you,
therefore, are so terribly incensed, take me as a remedy. In
thirty-four hours' time I shall be at Calais. Come with me;
the journey will appear shorter if together, than if alone.
We will fight, when we get there, upon the sands which are
covered by the rising tide, and which form part of the
French territory during six hours of the day, but belong to
the territory of Heaven during the other six.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I accept willingly,&quot; said De Wardes.</P>
<P>&quot;I assure you,&quot; said the duke, &quot;that if you kill me, you
will be rendering me an infinite service.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will do my utmost to make myself agreeable to you, duke,&quot;
said De Wardes.</P>
<P>&quot;It is agreed, then, that I carry you off with me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I shall be at your commands. I needed some real danger and
some mortal risk to run, to tranquilize me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In that case, I think you have met with what you are
looking for. Farewell, M. de Wardes; to-morrow morning, my
valet will tell you the exact hour of our departure; we can
travel together like two excellent friends. I generally
travel as fast as I can. Adieu.&quot;</P>
<P>Buckingham saluted De Wardes, and returned towards the
king's apartments; De Wardes, irritated beyond measure, left
the Palais-Royal, and hurried through the streets homeward
to the house where he lodged.</P></div>
