<p>Qualla Battoo is the name of a small Malay town, which stood
on the northwestern coast of Sumatra. In the month of February,
1831, the <em>Friendship</em>, a trading vessel from Salem, Mass.,
lay at anchor off the town, taking on board a cargo of pepper.
Her captain, Mr. Endicott, and crew numbered fifteen men. There
being no harbor, the vessel was about half a mile from shore.
The day was oppressively hot and no one on the <em>Friendship</em>
put forth more exertion than was absolutely necessary. Even the
swarthy natives seemed to languish in the flaming heat and displayed
less vigor in bringing out the pepper in their boats than they
did when the sun beat down upon them with its usual rigor.</p>

<p>Captain Endicott understood the treacherous nature of the Malays,
and he and his crew kept sharp watch of those who were given the
management of the vessel's boats, owing to the difficult character
of the coast which made such a course necessary.</p>

<p>The trade in pepper was almost the only one in which Qualla Battoo
engaged. Captain Endicott, his second mate and four seamen were
on shore at the trading station, a little way up the river, superintending
the weighing of the pepper. The first mate and the rest of the
crew waited on the vessel to receive and stow away the cargo.
The work had hardly begun when a suspicious proceeding caught
the eye of Captain Endicott.</p>

<p>The first boat, after receiving its load, passed the short distance
necessary down the river to the sea, where, instead of rowing
directly out to the ship, it turned up the coast and took on board
more men. The Captain concluded the crew needed this additional
help to work their way through the heavy surf. But, not wholly
satisfied, he told two of his men to go nearer the shore, keep
their eyes on the boat and report to him anything that looked
wrong.</p>

<p>Captain Endicott, from his position, was unable to catch the
full significance of the first action of the natives in charge
of the outgoing boat, for, instead of taking on board more help,
the whole unarmed party stepped ashore and twice as many fully
armed warriors took their places. They carefully concealed their
weapons and the Americans on the vessel made the same mistake
as their captain in believing they were merely the additions necessary
to help work the craft through the surf.</p>

<p>They tied fast to the gangway and most of them climbed over the
side with their daggers hidden in their clothing. The mate would
have stopped them, but they pretended not to understand his words
and acted as if interested in the appearance of the guns and rigging.
Their conduct was so natural that the mate and his men gave their
whole attention to taking the pepper on board and stowing it away.
The mate was absorbed in his work, when suddenly several Malays
sprang with lightning-like quickness at him and buried their daggers
in his back. He turned and attempted to defend himself, but was
quickly despatched. Five men rushed to the help of the mate, but
they were unarmed and outnumbered four to one. Two were quickly
killed and three made prisoners. The other four seamen sprang
overboard and swam for land. They saw that the beach was lined
with warriors waiting for them. Accordingly they turned to one
side and swam several miles to a promontory, where they were safe
for the time.</p>

<p>Seeing that their friends had gained possession of the ship,
several boatloads of natives rowed out to it, took possession,
plundered and then tried to run it ashore, that they might break
out the metal work at their leisure.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two seamen stationed near shore by the captain
saw what had taken place and ran back to him with the alarming
news. He instantly ordered all into the second boat and hurried
down the river, hoping to reach the vessel in time to recapture
it. The boat was pursued by the natives along the bank, but it
managed to reach the mouth of the river, where it would have perished
in the surf but for the help of a friendly member of an adjoining
tribe, who sprang from his armed coasting schooner and swam to
their assistance. He helped them through the surf, and, when confronted
by the native armed boats, made such threats and flourishes with
his sword (none of the Americans being armed) that he kept the
miscreants at bay and the white men succeeded in reaching the
open sea.</p>

<p>Seeing that it would be sure death to go to the vessel, the boat
was rowed to a small town about twenty miles distant, where the
occupants found three American merchant vessels. The officers
and crews were enraged upon learning what had taken place, and,
although it was night, they made sail at once for Qualla Battoo,
reaching it next day. In reply to the demand that the <em>Friendship</em>
should be returned, the insolent Rajah told them to take her if
they could. The three ships moved as close to shore as was safe
and opened fire with such guns as they had. All merchant vessels
carried some kind of armament against pirates in that part of
the world. Impatient with the delay involved in recapturing the
<em>Friendship</em>, by attacking at long range, as it may be
called, three boats were filled with armed men who rowed straight
for the vessel. It was swarming with armed natives, who kept up
a vicious but ill directed fire, the result of which was the sailors
rowed the faster, eager to get close enough to punish the miscreants
for their murderous work.</p>

<p>When they were almost to the ship the Malays sprang overboard
and swam frantically for land. Captain Endicott regained possession
of his vessel, and, upon examination, found it had been rifled
from stem to stern. Among the plunder taken away was $12,000 in
specie. Altogether the loss was $40,000 to the owners of the ship
and the captain was compelled to give up his voyage and return
home.</p>

<p>It took a long time for news to travel in those days, but it
finally reached the United States, where Andrew Jackson happened
to be President. He immediately ordered the 44-gun frigate <em>Potomac</em>
to that out of the way corner of the world, with instructions
to punish the guilty parties concerned in the outrage. Captain
Downes lost no time in getting under way and arrived off Qualla
Battoo in February, 1832, just a year after the treacherous attack
upon the <em>Friendship</em>.</p>

<p>Anxious to prevent his errand becoming known so that he might
surprise the Malays, Captain Downes disguised his ship as a merchantman,
closing his ports and taking every precaution possible. He displayed
the Danish colors, still maintaining the guise of a merchantman,
and sent a boat's crew to take soundings along shore. The natives
on the beach displayed so hostile a disposition that no landing
was made, and, having gained the necessary information, the boat
returned to the frigate. Captain Downes then informed them that
the expedition would leave the ship at midnight.</p>

<p>A strong armed force in several boats secretly rowed to land
at the time named, but day was approaching when they reached the
beach, where the men landed under the guidance of the former second
mate of the <em>Friendship</em> and started inland. One division
turned to the left to attack the fort at the northern end of the
town. The Malays received them with a brisk discharge of cannon,
muskets, javelins and arrows. But, returning the fire, the Americans
burst open the gate of the stockade, fought hand to hand with
the fierce Malays and drove them out of the open space into the
citadel. There they were attacked with the same impetuosity, but
they fought like tigers, and it was not until twelve had been
killed and a great many wounded that they were overcome. The Rajah
in command, after a desperate defence in which he wounded several
Americans, was finally despatched.</p>

<p>In the meantime the fort in the middle of the town had been attacked
by the other division and carried after a bloody fight in which
a marine was killed and a number wounded. But the strongest fort
of all stood on the bank of the river near the beach. There the
Rajah of Qualla Battoo, who was the real author of the attack
on the <em>Friendship</em>, had gathered a large force of his
best warriors and announced that he would fight to the death.</p>

<p>The strength of the force which marched against the fort was
eighty-five men. One of the officers who took part in this attack
said: "The natives were brave and fought with a fierceness bordering
on desperation. They would not yield while a drop of their savage
blood warmed their bosoms or while they had strength to wield
a weapon, fighting with that undaunted firmness which is the characteristic
of bold and determined spirits and displaying such an utter carelessness
of life as would have been honored in a better cause. Instances
of the bravery of these people were numerous, so much so that
were I to give the detail of each event my description would probably
become tiresome."</p>

<p>The barricades stoutly resisted the fire. Leaving a force to
engage the fort in front, Lieutenant Shubrick led a body of sailors
through the woods to the rear with the 6-pounder which had been
brought from the frigate. When they reached their position they
came upon three heavily armed schooners, swarming with warriors,
awaiting a chance to take part in the fight. Shubrick promptly
opened upon them with his cannon, followed by a destructive fire
of musketry, which sent the Malays leaping overboard and into
the woods. They succeeded, however, in warping one of the schooners
beyond range.</p>

<p>The Americans now being at the front and rear of the fort, a
simultaneous attack was made. The gate was wrenched from its fastenings,
but the first American who tried to enter was killed and three
others badly wounded. Undaunted the remainder of the assailants
rushed through and drove the defenders to a high platform, where
they made their final stand. The other stockade was in flames,
which were burning so fast that the Americans themselves were
in danger from them. The little cannon was brought into play from
a neighboring elevation and poured canister and grape into the
Malays. Meanwhile the Americans, who had performed their part
so well, came up and joined in the attack on the main fort. The
Malays, still fighting, shrieked out their defiant cries. In the
ardor of the assault the little cannon was too heavily loaded
and dismounted. Amid the wild confusion the flames of the second
fort reached the magazine and the whole structure blew up with
a tremendous explosion.</p>

<p>The cannon being useless, Lieutenant Shubrick ordered a general
assault upon the citadel, and it was made with a resistless rush.
The men scrambled upon the platform, in the face of the swarthy
wild cats, and despatched them in a whirlwind fashion. The work
being apparently completed, the bugle was sounded for retreat
and the Americans returned to the beach. On the way they were
fired upon by another fort for which they had searched without
being able to find it. Returning the fire, the Americans charged
through the jungle and after another desperate fight it was captured,
most of the garrison slain and the remainder sent scurrying through
the woods.</p>

<p>The roll call revealed that two Americans had been killed and
eleven wounded. All were gently lifted into the boats and carried
to the ship. A moderate estimate made 100 of the Malays killed
and fully double the number wounded.</p>

<p>Captain Downes now brought his long 32-pounders to bear and opened
a bombardment of Qualla Battoo which spread destruction and death
among the natives. Many were killed and others sent scurrying
in terror to the jungle. Toward the close of the day white flags
were displayed and the firing ceased. Immediately after a boat
was sent out by the remaining rajahs, with a white flag fluttering
at the bow. On coming aboard the messengers were presented to
Captain Downes and they humbly prayed that he would stop the firing
of his big guns, which were killing all their people. He promised
to do so on their pledge never again to molest an American. He
assured them that if they ever did his country would send larger
and more terrible ships across the ocean that would lay their
towns in ashes and slay hundreds of their men. The subsequent
history of that quarter of the world leaves no doubt that the
impressive warning of Captain Downes produced the best of results,
for Sumatra has never required any further attention from our
navy.</p>
