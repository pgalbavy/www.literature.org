<p>The following day Clive replied to his wife by cable: "As it
seems to make no unpleasant difference to you I have concluded
to remain in New York. Please take whatever steps you may find
most convenient and agreeable for yourself."</p>

<p>And, following this he wrote her:</p>

<p>   "I am inexpressibly sorry to cause you any new annoyance and   
to arouse once more your just impatience and resentment. But   
I see no use in a recapitulation of my shortcomings and of   
your own many disappointments in the man you married.</p>

<p>   "Please remember that I have always assumed all blame for
our    marriage; and that I shall always charge myself with it.
I    have no reply to make to your reproaches,&mdash;no defence; I
was    not in love with you when I married you&mdash;which is as serious   
an offence as any man can perpetrate toward any woman. And I   
do not now blame you for a very natural refusal to tolerate   
anything approaching the sympathy and intimacy that ought to   
exist between husband and wife.</p>

<p>   "I did entertain a hazy idea that affection and perhaps love   
might be ultimately possible even under the circumstances of   
such a marriage as ours; and in a youthful, ignorant, and    inexperienced
way I attempted to bring it about. My notions    of our mutual
obligations were very vague and indefinite.</p>

<p>   "Please believe I did not realise how utterly distasteful
any    such ideas were to you, and how deep was your personal   
disinclination for the man you married.</p>

<p>   "I understand now how many mistakes I made before I finally   
rid you of myself, and gave you a chance to live your life in   
your own way unharassed by the interference of a young,    ignorant,
and probably aggressive man.</p>

<p>   "Your aversion to motherhood was, after all, your own affair.   
Man has no right to demand that of woman. I took a very    bullying
and intolerant attitude toward you&mdash;not, as I now    realise,
from any real conviction on the subject, but because    I liked
and wanted children, and also because I was    influenced by the
cant of the hour&mdash;the fashion being to    demand of woman, on
ethical grounds, quantitative    reproduction as a marriage offering
to the Almighty. As    though indiscriminate and wholesale addition
to humanity were    an admirable and religious duty. Nothing,
even in the Old    Testament, is more stupid than such a doctrine;
no child    should ever be born unwelcome to both parents.</p>

<p>   "I am sorry I could not find your circle of friends    interesting.
I sometimes think I might have, had you and I    been mutually
sympathetic. But the situation was impossible;    our ideas, interests,
convictions, tastes, were radically at    variance; we had absolutely
nothing in common to build on.    What marriage ties could endure
the strain of such    conditions? The fault was mine, Winifred;
I am sorry for    you.</p>

<p>   "I don't know much about anything, but, thinking as clearly   
and as impersonally as it is in me to think, I begin to    believe
that divorce, far from deserving the stigma attached    to it,
is a step forward in civilisation.</p>

<p>   "Perhaps it may be only a temporary substitute for something   
better&mdash;say for more wholesome and more honest social    conditions
where the proposition for mating and the selection    of a mate
may lie as freely with your sex as with mine.</p>

<p>   "Until then I know of nothing more honest and more sensible   
than to undo the wrong that ignorance and inexperience has   
accomplished. No woman's moral or spiritual salvation is    dependent
upon her wearing the fetters of a marriage    abhorred. Such a
stupid sacrifice is unthinkable to modesty    and decency, and
is repulsive to common sense. And any god    who is supposed to
demand that of humanity is not the true    God, but is as grotesque
and false as any African idol or any    deity ever worshipped
by Puritan or Pagan or by any orthodox    assassin of free minds
since the first murder was perpetrated    on account of creed.</p>

<p>   "You are entitled to divorce. I don't know whether I am or   
not, having done this thing. Nobody likes to endure unhappy   
consequences. I don't. But it was my own doing and I have no   
ground for complaint.</p>

<p>   "You, however, have. You ought to be free of me. Of course,   
I'd be very glad to have my freedom; I shall not lie about   
it; but the difference is that you deserve yours and I don't.   
But I'll be very grateful if you care to give it to me.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Don't write any more bitterly than you can help. I don't<br/>
believe it really affords you any satisfaction; and it<br/>
depresses me more than you could realise. I know only too<br/>
well what I have been and wherein I have failed so miserably.<br/>
Let me forget it whenever I can, Winifred. And if, for me,<br/>
there remains any chance, any outlook, be generous enough to<br/>
let me try to take it.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your husband,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"C. <em>BAILEY</em>."

</div>
<p>The consequences of this letter did not seem to be very fortunate.
There came a letter from her so bitter and menacing that a cleverer
man might have read in it enough of menace between the lines to
forearm him with caution at least.</p>

<p>But Clive merely read it once and destroyed it and tried to forget
it.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>It was not until some time afterward that, gradually, some instinct
in him awoke suspicion. But for a long while he was not perfectly
sure that he was being followed.</p>

<p>However, when he could no longer doubt it, and when the lurking
figures and faces of at least two of the men who dogged him everywhere
had become sufficiently familiar to him, he wrote a short note
to his wife asking for an explanation.</p>

<p>But he got none&mdash;principally because his wife had already sailed.</p>

<p>The effect of Winifred's letters on an impressionable, sensitive,
and self-distrustful character, was never very quickly effaced.</p>

<p>Whatever was morbid in the man became apparent after he had received
such letters, and took the form of a quiet withdrawal from the
circles which he affected, until such time as mortification and
shame had subsided.</p>

<p>He had written briefly to Athalie saying that business would
take him out of town for a few weeks. Which it did as a matter
of fact, landing him at Spring Pond, Long Island, where he completed
the purchase of the Greensleeve tavern and took title in his own
name.</p>

<p>Old Ledlie had died; his only heir appeared to be glad enough
to sell; the title was free and clear; the possibilities of the
place fascinating.</p>

<p>Clive prowled around the place in two minds whether he might
venture to call in a local builder and have him strip the protuberances
from the house, which was all that was necessary to restore it
to its original form; or whether he ought to leave that for Athalie
to manage.</p>

<p>But there remained considerable to be done; May was in full bud
and blossom already; and if Athalie was to enjoy the place at
all that summer it ought to be made livable.</p>

<p>So Clive summoned several people to his aid with the following
quick results: A New York general contractor took over the entire
job guaranteeing quick results or forfeiture. A local nurseryman
and an emergency gang started in. They hedged the entire front
with privet for immediate effect, cleared, relocated, and restored
the ancient flower garden on its quaint original lines; planted
its borders thickly with old time perennials, peonies, larkspurs,
hollyhocks, clove pinks, irises, and lilies; replanted the rose
beds with old-fashioned roses, set the wall beds with fruit trees
and gay annuals, sodded, trimmed, raked, levelled, cleaned up,
and pruned, until the garden was a charming and logical thing.</p>

<p>Fortunately the newness was not apparent because the old stucco
walls remained laden with wistaria and honeysuckle, and the alley
of ancient box trees required clipping only.</p>

<p>In the centre of the lawn he built a circular pool and piped
the water from Spring Brook. It fell in a slender jet, icy cold,
powdering pool, basin and grass with spray.</p>

<p>Where half-dead locust and cedar trees had to be felled Clive
set tall arbor vitæ and soft maples. He was an expensive young
man where Athalie's pleasure was concerned; and as he worked there
in the lovely May weather his interest and enthusiasm grew with
every fresh fragrant spadeful of brown earth turned.</p>

<p>The local building genius repainted the aged house after bay
window and gingerbread had been stripped from its otherwise dignified
facade; replaced broken slates on the roof, mended the great fat
chimneys, matched the traces of pale bluish-green that remained
on the window shutters, filled in the sashes with small, square
panes, instituted modern plumbing, drainage, sewage, and electric
lights&mdash;all of which was emergency work and not too difficult
as the city improvements had now been extended as far as the village
a mile to the eastward. But it was expensive.</p>

<p>At first Clive had decided to leave the interior to Athalie,
but he finally made up his mind to restore the place on its original
lines with the exception of her mother's room. This room he recognised
from her frequent description of it; and he locked it, pocketed
the key, and turned loose his men.</p>

<p>All that they did was to plaster where it was needed, re-kalsomine
all walls and ceilings, scrape, clean, mend, and re-enamel the
ancient woodwork. Trim, casings, wainscot, and stairs were restored
to their original design and finish; dark hardwood floors replaced
the painted boards which had rotted; wherever a scrap of early
wall-paper remained he matched it as closely as possible, having
an expert from New York to do the business; and the fixtures he
chose were simple and graceful and reflected the period as nearly
as electric light fixtures can simulate an era of candle-sticks
and tallow dips.</p>

<p>He was tremendously tempted to go ahead, so fascinating had the
work become to him, but he realised that it was not fair to Athalie.
All that he could reasonably do he had done; the place was clean
and fresh, and restored to its original condition outside and
in, except for the modern necessities of lighting, heating, plumbing,
and running water in pantry, laundry, kitchen, and bathrooms.
Two of the latter had replaced two clothes-presses; the ancient
cellar had been cemented and whitewashed, and heavily stocked
with furnace and kitchen coal and kindling.</p>

<p>Also there were fire-dogs for the three fine old-fashioned fireplaces
in the house which had been disinterred from under bricked-in
and plastered surfaces where only the aged mantel shelves and
a hole for a stove pipe revealed their probable presence.</p>

<p>The carpets were too ragged and soiled to retain; the furniture
too awful. But he replaced the latter, leaving its disposition
and the pleasure of choosing new furniture and new floor coverings
to Athalie.</p>

<p>Hers also was to be the pleasure of re-stocking the house with
linen; of selecting upholstery and curtains and the requisites
for pantry, kitchen, and dining-room.</p>

<p>Once she told him what she had meant to do with the bar. And
he took the liberty of doing it, turning the place into a charming
sun-parlour, where, in a stone basin, gold-fish swam and a forest
of feathery and flowering semi-tropical plants spread a fretwork
of blue shadows over the cool stone floor.</p>

<p>But he left the big stove as it had been; and the rather quaint
old chairs with their rush-bottoms renovated and their lustrous
wood stained and polished by years of use.</p>

<p>Every other day he went to Spring Pond from his office in New
York to watch the progress of the work. The contractor was under
penalty; Clive had not balked at the expense; and the work was
put through with a rush.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile he called on Athalie occasionally, pretending
always whenever she spoke of it, that negotiations were still
under way concerning the property in question, and that such transactions
required patience and time.</p>

<p>One matter, too, was gradually effaced from his mind. The tall
man and the short man who had been following him so persistently
had utterly disappeared. And nobody else seemed to have taken
their places. Eventually he forgot it altogether.</p>

<p>Two months was the period agreed upon for the completion of Athalie's
house and garden, and the first week in July found the work done.</p>

<p>It had promised to be a hot week in the city: Athalie, who had
been nowhere except for an evening at some suburban restaurant,
had begun to feel fagged and listless and in need of a vacation.</p>

<p>And that morning she had decided to go away for a month to some
quiet place in the mountains, and she was already consulting various
folders and advertisements which she had accumulated since early
spring, when the telephone in her bedroom rang.</p>

<p>She had never heard Clive's voice so gay over the wire. She told
him so; and she could hear his quick and rather excited laugh.</p>

<p>"Are you very busy to-day?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No; I'm going to close up shop for a month, Clive. I'm hot and
tired and dying for a glimpse of something green. I was just looking
over a lot of advertisements&mdash;cottages and hotels. Come up and
help me."</p>

<p>"I want you to spend the day with me in the country. Will you?"</p>

<p>"I'd love to. Where?"</p>

<p>"At Spring Pond."</p>

<p>"Clive! Do you really want to go there?"</p>

<p>"Yes. As your guest."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"If you will invite me. Will you?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Have you bought the place for me?"</p>

<p>"I have the deed in my pocket, all ready to be transferred to
you."</p>

<p>"You darling! Clive, I am so excited&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So am I. Shall I come for you in my brand new car? I've invested
in an inexpensive Stinger runabout. May I drive you down? It won't
take much longer than by train. And it will cool us off."</p>

<p>"Come as soon as you can get here!" she cried, delighted. "This
is going to be the happiest day of my entire life!"</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</div>
<p>And so it came about that Athalie in her pretty new gown and
hat of lilac lingerie, followed by a maid bearing three suit-cases,
hat-box, toilet satchel, and automobile coat, emerged from the
main entrance of the building where Clive sat waiting in a smart
Stinger runabout. When he saw her he sprang out and came forward,
hat in hand.</p>

<p>"You darling," she said in a low, happy voice. "You've made me
happier than I ever dreamed of being. I don't know what to say
to you; I simply don't know how to thank you for doing this wonderful
thing for me."</p>

<p>He, too, was happier than he had ever been in all his life; and
so much in love that he found nothing to say for a moment save
the few trite phrases in which a man in love says many commonplaces,
all of which only mean, "I love you."</p>


<p>Doubtless she understood the complicated code, for she laughed
and blushed a trifle and looked around at her maid laden with
luggage.</p>

<p>"Where can we put these, Clive?" she asked.</p>

<p>"What on earth is all that luggage?" he asked, surprised.</p>

<p>"I'm going to remain a few days," she explained, "so I've brought
a few things."</p>

<p>"But do you imagine there is anything to eat or anywhere to lay
your head in that tumble down old house?" he demanded, secretly
enchanted with her rash enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"I propose to camp. I can buy milk, crackers, and sardines at
Spring Pond village; also sufficient bathroom and bed linen. That
is all I require to be perfectly comfortable."</p>

<p>There was no rumble on the Stinger, only a baggage rack and boot.
Here he secured, covered, and strapped Athalie's impedimenta;
the maid slipped on her travelling coat; she sprang lightly into
the seat; and Clive went around and climbed in beside her, taking
the wheel.</p>

<p>The journey downtown and across the Queensboro Bridge was the
usual uncomfortable and exasperating progress familiar to all
who pilot cars to Long Island. Brooklyn was negotiated prayerfully;
they swung into the great turnpike, through the ugliest suburbs
this humiliated world ever endured, on through the shabby, filthy,
sordid environment of the gigantic Burrough, past ignoble villages,
desolate wastes, networks of railway tracks where grade crossings
menaced them, and on along the purlieus of suburban deserts until
the flat green Long Island country spread away on either side
dotted with woods and greenhouses and quaint farm-houses and old-time
spires.</p>

<p>"It is pretty when you get here," he said, "but it's like climbing
over a mile of garbage to get out of one's front door. No European
city would endure being isolated by such a desert of squalor and
abominable desolation."</p>

<p>But Athalie merely smiled. She had been far too excited to notice
the familiar ugliness and filth of the dirty city's soiled and
ragged outskirts.</p>

<p>And now the car sped on amid the flat, endless acres of cultivated
land, and already her dainty nose was sniffing familiar but half-forgotten
odours&mdash;the faintest hint of ocean, the sun-warmed scent of freshly
cut salt hay; perfumes from woodlands in heavy foliage, and the
more homely smell from barn-yard and compost-heap; from the sunny,
dusty village streets through which they rolled; from village
lanes heavy with honeysuckle.</p>

<p>"I seem to be speeding back toward my childhood," she said. "Every
breath of this air, every breeze, every odour is making it more
real to me.... I wonder whatever became of my ragged red hood
and cloak. I can't remember."</p>

<p>"I'd like to have them," he said. "I'd fold them and lay them
away for&mdash;"</p>

<p>He checked himself, sobered, suddenly and painfully aware that
the magic of the moment had opened for him an unreal vista where,
in the false dawn, the phantom of Hope stood smiling. Her happy
smile had altered, too; and her gloved hand stole out and rested
on his own for a moment in silence. Neither said anything for
a while, and yet the sky was so blue, the wind so soft and aromatic,
and the sun's splendour was turning the very earth to powdered
gold. And maybe the gods would yet be kind. Maybe, one day, others,
with Athalie's hair and eyes, might smooth the faded scarlet hood
and cloak with softly inquiring fingers.</p>

<p>He spoke almost harshly from his brief dream: "There is the Bay!"</p>

<p>But she had turned to look back at the quiet little cemetery
already behind them, and a moment or two passed before she lifted
her eyes and looked out across the familiar stretch of water.
Azure and silver it glimmered there in the sun. Red-shouldered
blackbirds hovered, fluttered, dropped back into the tall reeds;
meadow larks whistled sweetly, persistently; a slow mouse-hawk
sailed low over the fields, his broad wings tipped up like a Japanese
kite, the silver full-moon flashing on his back as he swerved.
And then the old tavern came into sight behind its new hedge of
privet.</p>

<p>Athalie caught sight of it,&mdash;of the tall hedge, the new posts
of stone through which a private road now curved into the grounds
and around a circle before the porch; saw the new stone wall inclosing
it ablaze with nasturtiums, the brilliant loveliness of the old
and long neglected garden beyond; saw the ancient house in all
its quaint and charming simplicity bereft of bow-window, spindle,
and gingerbread fretwork,&mdash;saw the white front of it, the green
shutters, the big, thick chimneys, the sunlight sparkling on small
square panes, and on the glass of the sun parlour.</p>

<p>The girl was trembling when he stopped the car at the front door,
sprang out, and aided her to descend.</p>

<p>A man in overalls came up, diffidently, and touched his broad
straw hat. To him Clive gave a low-voiced order or two, then stepped
forward to where the girl was standing.</p>

<p>"It is too beautiful&mdash;" she began, but her voice failed, and
he saw the sensitive lips tremulous in their silence and the eyes
brilliant with the menace of tears.</p>

<p>He drew her arm through his and they went in, moving slowly and
in silence from room to room. Only the almost convulsive pressure
of her arm on his told him of a happiness too deep for expression.</p>

<p>On the landing above he offered her the key to her mother's room.</p>

<p>"Nothing is changed there," he said; and, fitting the key, unlocked
the door, and turned away.</p>

<p>But the girl caught his hand in hers and drew him with her into
the faded, shabby room where her mother's chair stood in its accustomed
place, and the faded hassock lay beside it.</p>

<p>"Sit here," she said. And when he was seated she dropped on the
hassock at his feet and laid her cheek on his knees.</p>

<p>The room was very still and sunny; her lover remained silent
and unstirring; and the girl's eyes wandered from carpet to ceiling
and from wall to wall, resting on familiar objects; then, passing
dreamily, remained fixed on space&mdash;sweet, brooding eyes, dim with
the deepest emotion she had ever known.</p>

<p>A new, profound, and thrilling peace possessed her&mdash;a heavenly
sense of tranquillity and security, as though, somehow, all problems
had been solved for her and for him.</p>

<p>Presently in a low, hushed, happy voice she began to speak about
her mother. Little unimportant, unconnected incidents came to
her mind&mdash;brief moments, episodes as ephemeral as they had been
insignificant.</p>

<p>Sitting on the faded hassock at his feet she lifted her head
and rested both arms across his knees.</p>

<p>"It is all so perfect now," she said,&mdash;"you here in mother's
room, and I at your feet: and the sunny world waiting for us outside.
How mellow is this light! Always in the demi-dusk of this house
there seemed to me to linger a golden tint&mdash;even on dark days&mdash;even
at night&mdash;as though somewhere a ray of sun had been lost and had
not entirely faded out."</p>

<p>"It came from your own heart, Athalie&mdash;that wonderful and golden
heart of yours where light and warmth can never die.... Dear,
are you contented with what I have ventured to do?"</p>

<p>She looked silently into his eyes, then with a little sigh dropped
her head on his knees again.</p>

<p>Far away somewhere in the depths of the house somebody was moving.
And presently she asked him who it was.</p>

<p>"Connor, the man of all work. I sent him to Spring Pond village
to buy bed linen and bath towels. I ventured to install a brass
bed or two in case you had thought of coming here with your maid.
You see," he added, smiling, "it was fortunate that I did."</p>

<p>"You are the most wonderful man in the world, Clive," she murmured,
her eyes fixed dreamily on his face. "Always you have been making
life delightful for me; smoothing my path, helping me where the
road is rough."... She sighed: "Clive, you are very wonderful
to me."</p>

</div>
<p>Mrs. Jim Connor had come to help; and now, at high noon, she
sought them where they were standing in the garden, &mdash;Athalie
in ecstasy before the scented thickets of old-fashioned rockets
massed in a long, broad border against a background of trees.</p>

<p>So they went in to luncheon, which was more of a dinner; and
Mrs. Connor served them with apology, bustle, and not too garrulously
for the humour they were in.</p>

<p>High spirits had returned to them when they stepped out of doors;
and they came back to the house for luncheon in the gayest of
humour, Athalie chattering away blithe as a linnet in a thorn
bush, and Clive not a whit more reticent.</p>

<p>"Hafiz is going to adore this!" exclaimed the girl. "My angel
pussy!&mdash;why was I mean enough to leave you in the city!... I'll
have a dog, too&mdash;a soft, roly-poly puppy, who shall grow up with
a wholesome respect for Hafiz. And, Clive! I shall have a nice
fat horse, a safe and sane old Dobbin&mdash;so I can poke about the
countryside at my leisure, through byways and lanes and disused
roads."</p>

<p>"You need a car, too."</p>

<p>"No, no, I really don't. Anyway," she said airily, "your car
is sufficient, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Of course," he smiled.</p>

<p>"I think so, too. I shall not require or desire a car unless
you also are to be in it. But I'd love to possess a Dobbin and
a double buckboard. Also I shall, in due time, purchase a sail-boat&mdash;"
She checked herself, laughed at the sudden memory, and said with
delightful malice: "I suppose you have not yet learned to sail
a boat, have you?"</p>

<p>He laughed, too: "How you scorned me for my ignorance, didn't
you? Oh, but I've learned a great many things since those days,
Athalie."</p>

<p>"To sail a boat, too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I had to learn. There's a lot of water in the world;
and I've been very far afield."</p>

<p>"I know," she said. There was a subtle sympathy in her voice,&mdash;an
exquisite recognition of the lonely years which now seemed to
lie far, far behind them both.</p>

<p>She glanced down at her fresh plate which Mrs. Connor had just
placed before her.</p>

<p>"Clive!" she exclaimed, enchanted, "do you see! Peach turnovers!"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Do you suppose this housewarming could be a proper
one without peach turnovers?" And to Mrs. Connor he said: "That
is all, thank you. Miss Greensleeve and I will eat our turnovers
by the stove in the sun-parlour."</p>

<p>And there they ate their peach turnovers, seated on the old-time
rush-bottomed chairs beside the stove&mdash;just as they had sat so
many years ago when Athalie was a child of twelve and wore a ragged
cloak and hood of red.</p>

<p>Sometimes, leisurely consuming her pastry, she glanced demurely
at her lover, sometimes her blue eyes wandered to the sunny picture
outside where roses grew and honeysuckle trailed and the blessed
green grass enchanted the tired eyes of those who dwelt in the
monstrous and arid city.</p>

<p>Presently she went away to the room he had prepared for her;
and he lay back lazily in his chair and lighted a cigarette, and
watched the thin spirals of smoke mounting through the sunshine.
When she returned to him she was clad in white from crown to toe,
and he told her she was enchanting, which made her eyes sparkle
and the dimples come.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Connor is going to remain and help me," she said. "All
my things are unpacked, and the bed is made very nicely, and it
is all going to be too heavenly for words. Oh, I <em>wish</em>
you could stay!"</p>

<p>"To-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But I suppose it would ruin us if anybody knew."</p>

<p>He said nothing as they walked back into the main hallway.</p>

<p>"What a charming old building it is!" she exclaimed. "Isn't it
odd that I never before appreciated the house from an esthetic
angle? I don't suppose you'd call this architecture, but whatever
else it may be it certainly is dignified. I adore the simplicity
of the rooms; don't you? I shall have some pretty silk curtains
made; and, in the bedrooms, chintz. And maybe you will help me
hunt for furniture and rugs. Will you, dear?"</p>

<p>"We'll find some old mahogany for this floor and white enamel
for the bedrooms if you like. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"Enchanting! I adore antique mahogany! You know how crazy I am
about the furniture of bygone days. I shall squander every penny
on things Chippendale and Sheraton and Hepplewhite. Oh, it is
going to be a darling house and I'm the happiest girl in the world.
And you have made me so!&mdash;dearest of men!"</p>

<p>She caught his hand to her lips as he bent to kiss hers, and
their faces came together in a swift and clinging embrace. Which
left her flushed and wordless for the moment, and disposed to
hang her head as she walked slowly beside him to the front door.</p>

<p>Out in the sunshine, however, her self-possession returned in
a pretty exclamation of delight; and she called his attention
to a tiny rainbow formed in the spray of the garden hose where
Connor was watering the grass.</p>

<p>"Symbol of hope for us," he said under his breath.</p>

<p>She nodded, and stood inhaling the fragrance of the garden.</p>

<p>"I know a path&mdash;if it still exists&mdash;where I used to go as a child.
Would you care to follow it with me?"</p>

<p>So they walked down to the causeway bridge spanning the outlet
to Spring Pond, turned to the right amid a tangle of milk-weed
in heavy bloom, and grapevines hanging in festoons from rock and
sapling.</p>

<p>The path had not changed; it wound along the wooded shore of
the pond, then sloped upward and came out into a grassy upland,
where it followed the woods' edge under the cool shadow of the
trees.</p>

<p>And as they walked she told him of her childish journeys along
this path until it reached the wooded and pebbly height of land
beyond, which is one of the vertebræ in the backbone of Long Island.</p>

<p>To reach that ridge was her ultimate ambition in those youthful
days; and when on one afternoon of reckless daring she had attained
it, and far to the northward she saw the waters of the great Sound
sparkling in the sun, she had felt like Balboa in sight of the
Pacific, awed to the point of prayer by her own miraculous achievement.</p>

<p>Where the path re-entered the woods, far down the slope, they
could hear the waters of Spring Brook flowing; and presently they
could see the clear glint of the stream; and she told him tales
of alder-poles and home-made hooks, and of dusky troutlings that
haunted the woodland pools far in the dusk of leafy and mysterious
depths.</p>

<p>On the brink of the slope, but firmly imbedded, there had been
a big mossy log. She discovered it presently, and drew him down
to a seat beside her, taking possession of one of his arms and
drawing it closely under her own. Then she crossed one knee over
the other and looked out into the magic half-light of a woodland
which, to her childish eyes, had once seemed a vast and depthless
forest. A bar of sunlight fell across her slim shoe and ankle
clothed in white, and across the log, making the moss greener
than emeralds.</p>

<p>From far below came pleasantly the noise of the brook; overhead
leaves stirred and whispered in the breezes; shadows moved; sun-spots
waxed and waned on tree-trunk and leaf and on the brown ground
under foot. A scarlet-banded butterfly&mdash;he they call the Red Admiral&mdash;flitted
persistently about an oak tree where the stain of sap darkened
the bark.</p>

<p>From somewhere came the mellow tinkle of cow-bells, which moved
Athalie to speech; and she poured out her heart to Clive on the
subject of domestic kine and of chickens and ducks.</p>

<p>"I'm a country girl; there can be no doubt about it," she admitted.
"I do not think a day passes in the city but I miss the cock-crow
and the plaint of barn-yard fowl, and the lowing of cattle and
the whimper and coo of pigeons. And my country eyes grow weary
for a glimpse of green, Clive,&mdash;and for wide horizons and the
vast flotillas of white clouds that sail over pastures and salt
meadows and bays and oceans. Never have I been as contented as
I am at this moment&mdash;here&mdash;under the sky alone with you."</p>

<p>"That also is all I ask in life&mdash;the open world, and you."</p>

<p>"Maybe it will happen."</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>"With everything&mdash;desirable&mdash;"</p>

<p>She dropped her eyes and remained very still. For the first time
in her life she had thought of children as her own&mdash;and his. And
the thought which had flashed unbidden through her mind left her
silent, and a little bewildered by its sweetness.</p>

<p>He was saying: "You should, by this time, have the means which
enable you to live in the country."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Cecil Reeve had advised her in her investments. The girl's financial
circumstances were modest, but adequate and sound.</p>

<p>"I never told you how much I have," she said. "May I?"</p>

<p>"If you care to."</p>

<p>She told him, explaining every detail very carefully; and he
listened, fascinated by this charming girl's account of how in
four years, she had won from the world the traditional living
to which all are supposed to be entitled.</p>

<p>"You see," she said, "that gives me a modest income. I could
live here very nicely. It has always been my dream.... But of
course everything now depends on where you are."</p>

<p>Surprised and touched he turned toward her: she flushed and smiled,
suddenly realising the naïveté of her avowal.</p>

<p>"It's true," she said. "Every day I seem to become more and more
entangled with you. I'm wondering whether I've already crossed
the bounds of friendship, and how far I am outside. I can't seem
to realise any longer that there is no bond between us stronger
than preference.... I was thinking&mdash;very unusual and very curious
thoughts&mdash;about us both." She drew a deep, unsteady, but smiling,
breath: "Clive, I wish you could marry me."</p>

<p>"You <em>wish</em> it, Athalie?" he asked, profoundly moved.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>After a silence she leaned over and rested her cheek against
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," she said under her breath,&mdash;"that is what I begin
to wish for. A home, and <em>you</em>.... And&mdash;children."</p>

<p>He put his arm around her.</p>

<p>"Isn't it strange, Clive, that I should think about children&mdash;at
my age&mdash;and with little chance of ever having any. I don't know
what possesses me to suddenly want them.... Wouldn't they be wonderful
in that house? And they'd have that darling garden to play in....
There ought to be a boy&mdash;several in fact, and some girls.... <em>I'd</em>
know what to do for them. Isn't it odd that I should know exactly
how to bring them up. But I do. I know I do.... I can almost see
them playing in the garden &mdash;I can see their dear little
faces&mdash;hear their voices&mdash;"</p>

<p>His arm was clasping her slim body very tightly, but she suddenly
sat upright, resting one slender hand on his shoulder; and her
gaze became steady and fixed.</p>

<p>Presently he noticed it and turned his head in the same direction,
but saw nothing except the sunlight sifting through the trees
and the golden half-light of the woods beyond.</p>

<p>"What is it, Athalie?" he asked.</p>

<p>She said in a curiously still voice: "Children."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Playing in the woods."</p>

<p>"Where?" he repeated; "I do not see them."</p>

<p>She did not answer. Presently she closed her eyes and rested
her face against his shoulder again, pressing close to him as
though lonely.</p>

<p>"They went away," she said in answer to his question.... "I feel
a little tired, Clive.... Do you care for me a great deal?"</p>

<p>"Can you ask?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... Because of the years ahead of us. I think there are
to be many&mdash;for us both. The future is so bewildering&mdash;like a
tangled and endless forest, and very dim to see in.... But sometimes
there comes a rift in the foliage&mdash;and there is a glimpse of far
skies shining. And for a moment one&mdash;'sees clearly'&mdash;into the
depths&mdash;a little way.... And surmises something of what remains
unseen. And imagines more, perhaps.... I wonder if you love me&mdash;enough."</p>

<p>"Dearest&mdash;dearest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let it remain unsaid, Clive. A girl must learn one day. But
never from the asking. And the same sun shall continue to rise
and set, whatever her answer is to be; and the moon, too; and
the stars shall remain unchanged&mdash;whatever changes us. How still
the woods are&mdash;as still as dreams."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "She suddenly sat upright, resting one slender
hand on his shoulder."]</p>

<p>She lifted her head, looked at him, smiled, then, freeing herself,
sprang to her feet and stood a moment drawing her slim hand across
her eyes.</p>

<p>"I shall have a tennis court, Clive. And a canoe on Spring Pond....
What kind of puppy was that I said I wanted?"</p>

<p>"One which would grow up with proper fear and respect for Hafiz,"
he said, smilingly, perplexed by the rapid sequence of her moods.</p>

<p>"A collie?"</p>

<p>"If you like."</p>

<p>"I wonder," she murmured, "whether they are safe for children&mdash;"
She looked up laughing: "<em>Isn't</em> it odd! I simply cannot
seem to free my mind of children whenever I think about that house."</p>

<p>As they moved along the path toward the new home he said: "What
was it you saw in the woods?"</p>

<p>"Children."</p>

<p>"Were they&mdash;real?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Had they died?"</p>

<p>"They have not yet been born," she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I did not know you could see such things."</p>

<p>"I am not sure that I can. It is very difficult for me, sometimes,
to distinguish between vividly imaginative visualisation and&mdash;other
things."</p>

<p>Walking back through the soft afternoon light the girl tried
to tell him all that she knew about herself and her clairvoyance&mdash;strove
to explain, to make him understand, and, perhaps, to understand
herself.</p>

<p>But after a while silence intervened between them; and when they
spoke again they spoke of other things. For the isolation of souls
is a solitude inviolable; there can be no intimacy there, only
the longing for it&mdash;the craving, endless, unsatisfied.</p>
