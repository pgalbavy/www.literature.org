<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was not until later that Rouletabille sent me the note-book
in which he had written at length the story of the phenomenon
of the inexplicable gallery. On the day I arrived at the Glandier
and joined him in his room, he recounted to me, with the greatest
detail, all that I have now related, telling me also how he had
spent several hours in Paris where he had learned nothing that
could be of any help to him.</p>

<p>The event of the inexplicable gallery had occurred on the night
between the 29th and 30th of October, that is to say, three days
before my return to the chateau. It was on the 2nd of November,
then, that I went back to the Glandier, summoned there by my friend’s
telegram, and taking the revolvers with me.</p>

<p>I am now in Rouletabille’s room and he has finished his recital.</p>

<p>While he had been telling me the story I noticed him continually
rubbing the glass of the eyeglasses he had found on the side table.
From the evident pleasure he was taking in handling them I felt
they must be one of those sensible evidences destined to enter
what he had called the circle of the right end of his reason.
That strange and unique way of his, to express himself in terms
wonderfully adequate for his thoughts, no longer surprised me.
It was often necessary to know his thought to understand the terms
he used; and it was not easy to penetrate into Rouletabille’s
thinking.</p>

<p>This lad’s brain was one of the most curious things I have ever
observed. Rouletabille went on the even tenor of his way without
suspecting the astonishment and even bewilderment he roused in
others. I am sure he was not himself in the least conscious of
the originality of his genius. He was himself and at ease wherever
he happened to be.</p>

<p>When he had finished his recital he asked me what I thought of
it. I replied that I was much puzzled by his question. Then he
begged me to try, in my turn, to take my reason in hand "by the
right end."</p>

<p>"Very well," I said. "It seems to me that the point of departure
of my reason would be this&mdash;there can be no doubt that the murderer
you pursued was in the gallery." I paused.</p>

<p>"After making so good a start, you ought not to stop so soon,"
he exclaimed. "Come, make another effort."</p>

<p>"I’ll try. Since he disappeared from the gallery without passing
through any door or window, he must have escaped by some other
opening."</p>

<p>Rouletabille looked at me pityingly, smiled carelessly, and remarked
that I was reasoning like a postman, or&mdash;like Frederic Larsan.</p>

<p>Rouletabille had alternate fits of admiration and disdain for
the great Fred. It all depended as to whether Larsan’s discoveries
tallied with Rouletabille’s reasoning or not. When they did he
would exclaim: "He is really great!" When they did not he would
grunt and mutter, "What an ass!" It was a petty side of the noble
character of this strange youth.</p>

<p>We had risen, and he led me into the park. When we reached the
court and were making towards the gate, the sound of blinds thrown
back against the wall made us turn our heads, and we saw, at a
window on the first floor of the chateau, the ruddy and clean
shaven face of a person I did not recognise.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" muttered Rouletabille. "Arthur Rance!" &mdash;He lowered
his head, quickened his pace, and I heard him ask himself between
his teeth: "Was he in the chateau that night? What is he doing
here?"</p>

<p>We had gone some distance from the chateau when I asked him who
this Arthur Rance was, and how he had come to know him. He referred
to his story of that morning and I remembered that Mr. Arthur
W. Rance was the American from Philadelphia with whom he had had
so many drinks at the Elysee reception.</p>

<p>"But was he not to have left France almost immediately?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No doubt; that’s why I am surprised to find him here still,
and not only in France, but above all, at the Glandier. He did
not arrive this morning; and he did not get here last night. He
must have got here before dinner, then. Why didn’t the concierges
tell me?"</p>

<p>I reminded my friend, apropos of the concierges, that he had
not yet told me what had led him to get them set at liberty.</p>

<p>We were close to their lodge. Monsieur and Madame Bernier saw
us coming. A frank smile lit up their happy faces. They seemed
to harbour no ill-feeling because of their detention. My young
friend asked them at what hour Mr. Arthur Rance had arrived. They
answered that they did not know he was at the chateau. He must
have come during the evening of the previous night, but they had
not had to open the gate for him, because, being a great walker,
and not wishing that a carriage should be sent to meet him, he
was accustomed to get off at the little hamlet of Saint-Michel,
from which he came to the chateau by way of the forest. He reached
the park by the grotto of Sainte-Genevieve, over the little gate
of which, giving on to the park, he climbed.</p>

<p>As the concierges spoke, I saw Rouletabille’s face cloud over
and exhibit disappointment&mdash;a disappointment, no doubt, with himself.
Evidently he was a little vexed, after having worked so much on
the spot, with so minute a study of the people and events at the
Glandier, that he had to learn now that Arthur Rance was accustomed
to visit the chateau.</p>

<p>"You say that Monsieur Arthur Rance is accustomed to come to
the chateau. When did he come here last?"</p>

<p>"We can’t tell you exactly," replied Madame Bernier&mdash;that was
the name of the concierge&mdash;"we couldn’t know while they were keeping
us in prison. Besides, as the gentleman comes to the chateau without
passing through our gate he goes away by the way he comes."</p>

<p>"Do you know when he came the first time?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Monsieur!&mdash;nine years ago."</p>

<p>"He was in France nine years ago, then," said Rouletabille, "and,
since that time, as far as you know, how many times has he been
at the Glandier?"</p>

<p>"Three times."</p>

<p>"When did he come the last time, as far as you know?"</p>

<p>"A week before the attempt in "The Yellow Room"."</p>

<p>Rouletabille put another question&mdash;this time addressing himself
particularly to the woman:</p>

<p>"In the grove of the parquet?"</p>

<p>"In the grove of the parquet," she replied.</p>

<p>"Thanks!" said Rouletabille. "Be ready for me this evening."</p>

<p>He spoke the last words with a finger on his lips as if to command
silence and discretion.</p>

<p>We left the park and took the way to the Donjon Inn.</p>

<p>"Do you often eat here?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes."</p>

<p>"But you also take your meals at the chateau?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Larsan and I are sometimes served in one of our rooms."</p>

<p>"Hasn’t Monsieur Stangerson ever invited you to his own table?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Does your presence at the chateau displease him?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know; but, in any case, he does not make us feel that
we are in his way."</p>

<p>"Doesn’t he question you?"</p>

<p>"Never. He is in the same state of mind as he was in at the door
of The "Yellow Room" when his daughter was being murdered, and
when he broke open the door and did not find the murderer. He
is persuaded, since he could discover nothing, that there’s no
reason why we should be able to discover more than he did. But
he has made it his duty, since Larsan expressed his theory, not
to oppose us."</p>

<p>Rouletabille buried himself in thought again for some time. He
aroused himself later to tell me of how he came to set the two
concierges free.</p>

<p>"I went recently to see Monsieur Stangerson, and took with me
a piece of paper on which was written: ‘I promise, whatever others
may say, to keep in my service my two faithful servants, Bernier
and his wife.’ I explained to him that, by signing that document,
he would enable me to compel those two people to speak out; and
I declared my own assurance of their innocence of any part in
the crime. That was also his opinion. The examining magistrate,
after it was signed, presented the document to the Berniers, who
then did speak. They said, what I was certain they would say,
as soon as they were sure they would not lose their place.</p>

<p>"They confessed to poaching on Monsieur Stangerson’s estates,
and it was while they were poaching, on the night of the crime,
that they were found not far from the pavilion at the moment when
the outrage was being committed. Some rabbits they caught in that
way were sold by them to the landlord of the Donjon Inn, who served
them to his customers, or sent them to Paris. That was the truth,
as I had guessed from the first. Do you remember what I said,
on entering the Donjon Inn?&mdash;‘We shall have to eat red meat&mdash;now!’
I had heard the words on the same morning when we arrived at the
park gate. You heard them also, but you did not attach any importance
to them. You recollect, when we reached the park gate, that we
stopped to look at a man who was running by the side of the wall,
looking every minute at his watch. That was Larsan. Well, behind
us the landlord of the Donjon Inn, standing on his doorstep, said
to someone inside: ‘We shall have to eat red meat&mdash;now.’</p>

<p>"Why that ‘now’? When you are, as I am, in search of some hidden
secret, you can’t afford to have anything escape you. You’ve got
to know the meaning of everything. We had come into a rather out-of-the-way
part of the country which had been turned topsy-turvey by a crime,
and my reason led me to suspect every phrase that could bear upon
the event of the day. ‘Now,’ I took to mean, ‘since the outrage.’
In the course of my inquiry, therefore, I sought to find a relation
between that phrase and the tragedy. We went to the Donjon Inn
for breakfast; I repeated the phrase and saw, by the surprise
and trouble on Daddy Mathieu’s face, that I had not exaggerated
its importance, so far as he was concerned.</p>

<p>"I had just learned that the concierges had been arrested. Daddy
Mathieu spoke of them as of dear friends&mdash;people for whom one
is sorry. That was a reckless conjunction of ideas, I said to
myself. ‘Now,’ that the concierges are arrested, ‘we shall have
to eat red meat.’ No more concierges, no more game! The hatred
expressed by Daddy Mathieu for Monsieur Stangerson’s forest-keeper&mdash;a
hatred he pretended was shared by the concierges led me easily
to think of poaching. Now as all the evidence showed the concierges
had not been in bed at the time of the tragedy, why were they
abroad that night? As participants in the crime? I was not disposed
to think so. I had already arrived at the conclusion, by steps
of which I will tell you later&mdash;that the assassin had had no accomplice,
and that the tragedy held a mystery between Mademoiselle Stangerson
and the murderer, a mystery with which the concierges had nothing
to do.</p>

<p>"With that theory in my mind, I searched for proof in their lodge,
which, as you know, I entered. I found there under their bed,
some springs and brass wire. ‘Ah!’ I thought, ‘these things explain
why they were out in the park at night!’ I was not surprised at
the dogged silence they maintained before the examining magistrate,
even under the accusation so grave as that of being accomplices
in the crime. Poaching would save them from the Assize Court,
but it would lose them their places; and, as they were perfectly
sure of their innocence of the crime they hoped it would soon
be established, and then their poaching might go on as usual.
They could always confess later. I, however, hastened their confession
by means of the document Monsieur Stangerson signed. They gave
all the necessary ‘proofs,’ were set at liberty, and have now
a lively gratitude for me. Why did I not get them released sooner?
Because I was not sure that nothing more than poaching was against
them. I wanted to study the ground. As the days went by, my conviction
became more and more certain. The day after the events of the
inexplicable gallery I had need of help I could rely on, so I
resolved to have them released at once."</p>

<p>That was how Joseph Rouletabille explained himself. Once more
I could not but be astonished at the simplicity of the reasoning
which had brought him to the truth of the matter. Certainly this
was no big thing; but I think, myself, that the young man will,
one of these days, explain with the same simplicity, the fearful
tragedy in "The Yellow Room" as well as the phenomenon of the
inexplicable gallery.</p>

<p>We reached the Donjon Inn and entered it.</p>

<p>This time we did not see the landlord, but were received with
a pleasant smile by the hostess. I have already described the
room in which we found ourselves, and I have given a glimpse of
the charming blonde woman with the gentle eyes who now immediately
began to prepare our breakfast.</p>

<p>"How’s Daddy Mathieu?" asked Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"Not much better&mdash;not much better; he is still confined to his
bed."</p>

<p>"His rheumatism still sticks to him, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Last night I was again obliged to give him morphine&mdash;the
only drug that gives him any relief."</p>

<p>She spoke in a soft voice. Everything about her expressed gentleness.
She was, indeed, a beautiful woman; somewhat with an air of indolence,
with great eyes seemingly black and blue&mdash;amorous eyes. Was she
happy with her crabbed, rheumatic husband? The scene at which
we had once been present did not lead us to believe that she was;
yet there was something in her bearing that was not suggestive
of despair. She disappeared into the kitchen to prepare our repast,
leaving on the table a bottle of excellent cider. Rouletabille
filled our earthenware mugs, loaded his pipe, and quietly explained
to me his reason for asking me to come to the Glandier with revolvers.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, contemplatively looking at the clouds of smoke
he was puffing out, "yes, my dear boy, I expect the assassin to-night."
A brief silence followed, which I took care not to interrupt,
and then he went on:</p>

<p>"Last night, just as I was going to bed, Monsieur Robert Darzac
knocked at my room. When he came in he confided to me that he
was compelled to go to Paris the next day, that is, this morning.
The reason which made this journey necessary was at once peremptory
and mysterious; it was not possible for him to explain its object
to me. ‘I go, and yet,’ he added, ‘I would give my life not to
leave Mademoiselle Stangerson at this moment.’ He did not try
to hide that he believed her to be once more in danger. ‘It will
not greatly astonish me if something happens to-morrow night,’
he avowed, ‘and yet I must be absent. I cannot be back at the
Glandier before the morning of the day after to-morrow.’</p>

<p>"I asked him to explain himself, and this is all he would tell
me. His anticipation of coming danger had come to him solely from
the coincidence that Mademoiselle Stangerson had been twice attacked,
and both times when he had been absent. On the night of the incident
of the inexplicable gallery he had been obliged to be away from
the Glandier. On the night of the tragedy in "The Yellow Room"
he had also not been able to be at the Glandier, though this was
the first time he had declared himself on the matter. Now a man
so moved who would still go away must be acting under compulsion&mdash;must
be obeying a will stronger than his own. That was how I reasoned,
and I told him so. He replied ‘Perhaps.’ &mdash;I asked him if
Mademoiselle Stangerson was compelling him. He protested that
she was not. His determination to go to Paris had been taken without
any conference with Mademoiselle Stangerson.</p>

<p>"To cut the story short, he repeated that his belief in the possibility
of a fresh attack was founded entirely on the extraordinary coincidence.
‘If anything happens to Mademoiselle Stangerson,’ he said, ‘it
would be terrible for both of us. For her, because her life would
be in danger; for me because I could neither defend her from the
attack nor tell of where I had been. I am perfectly aware of the
suspicions cast on me. The examining magistrate and Monsieur Larsan
are both on the point of believing in my guilt. Larsan tracked
me the last time I went to Paris, and I had all the trouble in
the world to get rid of him.’</p>

<p>"‘Why do you not tell me the name of the murderer now, if you
know it?’ I cried.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Darzac appeared extremely troubled by my question,
and replied to me in a hesitating tone:</p>

<p>"‘I? &mdash;I know the name of the murderer? Why, how could I
know his name?’</p>

<p>"I at once replied: ‘From Mademoiselle Stangerson.’</p>

<p>"He grew so pale that I thought he was about to faint, and I
saw that I had hit the nail right on the head. Mademoiselle and
he knew the name of the murderer! When he recovered himself, he
said to me: ‘I am going to leave you. Since you have been here
I have appreciated your exceptional intelligence and your unequalled
ingenuity. But I ask this service of you. Perhaps I am wrong to
fear an attack during the coming night; but, as I must act with
foresight, I count on you to frustrate any attempt that may be
made. Take every step needful to protect Mademoiselle Stangerson.
Keep a most careful watch of her room. Don’t go to sleep, nor
allow yourself one moment of repose. The man we dread is remarkably
cunning&mdash;with a cunning that has never been equalled. If you keep
watch his very cunning may save her; because it’s impossible that
he should not know that you are watching; and knowing it, he may
not venture.’</p>

<p>"‘Have you spoken of all this to Monsieur Stangerson?’</p>

<p>"‘No. I do not wish him to ask me, as you just now did, for the
name of the murderer. I tell you all this, Monsieur Rouletabille,
because I have great, very great, confidence in you. I know that
you do not suspect me.’</p>

<p>"The poor man spoke in jerks. He was evidently suffering. I pitied
him, the more because I felt sure that he would rather allow himself
to be killed than tell me who the murderer was. As for Mademoiselle
Stangerson, I felt that she would rather allow herself to be murdered
than denounce the man of "The Yellow Room" and of the inexplicable
gallery. The man must be dominating her, or both, by some inscrutable
power. They were dreading nothing so much as the chance of Monsieur
Stangerson knowing that his daughter was ‘held’ by her assailant.
I made Monsieur Darzac understand that he had explained himself
sufficiently, and that he might refrain from telling me any more
than he had already told me. I promised him to watch through the
night. He insisted that I should establish an absolutely impassable
barrier around Mademoiselle Stangerson’s chamber, around the boudoir
where the nurses were sleeping, and around the drawing-room where,
since the affair of the inexplicable gallery, Monsieur Stangerson
had slept. In short, I was to put a cordon round the whole apartment.</p>

<p>"From his insistence I gathered that Monsieur Darzac intended
not only to make it impossible for the expected man to reach the
chamber of Mademoiselle Stangerson, but to make that impossibility
so visibly clear that, seeing himself expected, he would at once
go away. That was how I interpreted his final words when we parted:
‘You may mention your suspicions of the expected attack to Monsieur
Stangerson, to Daddy Jacques, to Frederic Larsan, and to anybody
in the chateau.’</p>

<p>"The poor fellow left me hardly knowing what he was saying. My
silence and my eyes told him that I had guessed a large part of
his secret. And, indeed, he must have been at his wits’ end, to
have come to me at such a time, and to abandon Mademoiselle Stangerson
in spite of his fixed idea as to the consequence.</p>

<p>"When he was gone, I began to think that I should have to use
even a greater cunning than his so that if the man should come
that night, he might not for a moment suspect that his coming
had been expected. Certainly! I would allow him to get in far
enough, so that, dead or alive, I might see his face clearly!
He must be got rid of. Mademoiselle Stangerson must be freed from
this continual impending danger.</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy," said Rouletabille, after placing his pipe on the
table, and emptying his mug of cider, "I must see his face distinctly,
so as to make sure to impress it on that part of my brain where
I have drawn my circle of reasoning."</p>

<p>The landlady re-appeared at that moment, bringing in the traditional
bacon omelette. Rouletabille chaffed her a little, and she took
the chaff with the most charming good humour.</p>

<p>"She is much jollier when Daddy Mathieu is in bed with his rheumatism," 
Rouletabille said to me.</p>

<p>But I had eyes neither for Rouletabille nor for the landlady’s
smiles. I was entirely absorbed over the last words of my young
friend and in thinking over Monsieur Robert Darzac’s strange behaviour.</p>

<p>When he had finished his omelette and we were again alone, Rouletabille
continued the tale of his confidences.</p>

<p>"When I sent you my telegram this morning," he said, "I had only
the word of Monsieur Darzac, that ‘perhaps’ the assassin would
come to-night. I can now say that he will certainly come. I expect
him."</p>

<p>"What has made you feel this certainty?"</p>

<p>"I have been sure since half-past ten o’clock this morning that
he would come. I knew that before we saw Arthur Rance at the window
in the court."</p>

<p>"Ah!" I said, "But, again&mdash;what made you so sure? And why since
half-past ten this morning?"</p>

<p>"Because, at half-past ten, I had proof that Mademoiselle Stangerson
was making as many efforts to permit of the murderer’s entrance
as Monsieur Robert Darzac had taken precautions against it."</p>

<p>"Is that possible!" I cried. "Haven’t you told me that Mademoiselle
Stangerson loves Monsieur Robert Darzac?"</p>

<p>"I told you so because it is the truth."</p>

<p>"Then do you see nothing strange&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everything in this business is strange, my friend; but take
my word for it, the strangeness you now feel is nothing to the
strangeness that’s to come!"</p>

<p>"It must be admitted, then," I said, "that Mademoiselle Stangerson
and her murderer are in communication&mdash;at any rate in writing?"</p>

<p>"Admit it, my friend, admit it! You don’t risk anything! I told
you about the letter left on her table, on the night of the inexplicable
gallery affair,&mdash;the letter that disappeared into the pocket of
Mademoiselle Stangerson. Why should it not have been a summons
to a meeting? Might he not, as soon as he was sure of Darzac’s
absence, appoint the meeting for ‘the coming night?"</p>

<p>And my friend laughed silently. There are moments when I ask
myself if he is not laughing at me.</p>

<p>The door of the inn opened. Rouletabille was on his feet so suddenly
that one might have thought he had received an electric shock.</p>

<p>"Mr. Arthur Rance!" he cried.</p>

<p>Mr. Arthur Rance stood before us calmly bowing.</p>
