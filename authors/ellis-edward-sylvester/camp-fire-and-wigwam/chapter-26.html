<p>When the war party grew weary of the furious dance, they stopped,
formed themselves in Indian file, and with the leader at the head,
marched to the tepee, where they had left their rifles. They reappeared
a moment later, each bearing his weapon in hand, and quickly reformed
as before. Then all uttered several loud whoops, to which the
enthusiastic supporters responded with equal vim, and they marched
in the same file and with the same steady step toward the forest
on the other side the clearing. Right soon they vanished from
view among the trees. They had gone in quest of scalps, but in
the hunt more than one proud spirited brave was to lose his own
natural head-gear, and of those who went forth, the majority never
came back again.</p>

<p>Now that the main cause of the hullabaloo was removed, the Sauks
gained more time to view their immediate surroundings. When Jack
tottered to one side to obtain the needed rest, he separated himself
from Ogallah, who showed no signs of wearying of the terrific
exercise.</p>

<p>"I guess it will be as well for me to hunt him up," was the decision
of the youth, "for he may need my care."</p>

<p>But when the boy rose to his feet and looked around he saw nothing
of the sachem, though all the rest of the village appeared to
be in the immediate neighborhood. None of them had offered to
molest Jack, but he felt great misgiving. Fortunately the lodge
of the chieftain was not distant.</p>

<p>While the dance was going on, an experience befell young Carleton
which has not been told, but which should be given. In the bright
glare of the morning sun, the countenance of every one was distinctly
visible, and Jack was impressed by the fact that one heavy, squat
redskin was viewing him with peculiar interest. He passed in front
of the boy several times, and on each occasion cast a piercing
glance at him.</p>

<p>This of itself might not have been so noticeable but for the
impression which deepened on Jack that he and the warrior had
met at some other time and in some other place.</p>

<p>He was impatient with himself because he could not recall the
circumstances. Had it been on the other side of the Mississippi,
it would have been no wonder, for, from his earliest boyhood he
had been accustomed to seeing red men, and it would be impossible
to remember them all; but he was convinced he had met the Indian
since he and Otto had immigrated to Louisiana.</p>

<p>Possibly Jack might have answered the question had he been given
time to think over it without disturbance; but he had scarcely
begun to look around for Ogallah, when he was alarmed by the demonstrations
of the crowd around him. They began pushing forward, and the squaws
and children showed an unpleasant disposition to lay hands on
him.</p>

<p>There was no use of standing on dignity. In a few minutes he
would be hemmed in so he could not move, and the lodge of the
chieftain was not far away. Shoving a little screeching girl from
his path, Jack bounded away like a deer, straight for the shelter.
The act was so sudden that it threw him in advance of the rest,
but there were plenty of runners as fleet as he, and despite the
start he gained, several were at his heels, and one of them came
very near tripping him. Jack pressed on, and, within a rod of
the entrance to the kingly wigwam, the Indian who made the attempt
to trip him appeared at his side, and then threw himself directly
in front.</p>

<p>One glance showed the fugitive that it was the youth whom he
had overthrown in the wrestling bout.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, is it?" exclaimed Jack; "you haven't had enough
yet!"</p>

<p>And, quick as a flash, he drove his fist straight into the grinning
visage with all the force he could concentrate in his good right
arm. The amazed youth described a back somerset, his moccasins
up in the air, and his ugly nose flattened to the shape of a crimson
turnip. Then leaping over the prostrate figure, Jack made several
bounds, and dove into the lodge just in time to avoid colliding
with Ogallah, who had approached the door from the inside to learn
the cause of the new tumult.</p>

<p>The chief went far enough to obtain a good view of the audacious
youth who was in the act of climbing to his feet, and groping
for his nose and principal features in a blind way, as though
doubtful whether any of them were left. The clamoring rioters
were scattered once more, Ogallah adding a few words, probably
meant as a warning against their persecuting his ward, for it
may as well be stated that from that time forward the demonstrations
against Jack were of a much less serious nature.</p>

<p>"I suppose I've got to fight every time I go out of the lodge,"
said young Carleton, with a dogged shake of the head; "they mean
to kill me whenever they gain the chance, and more than likely
I'll have to go, but I'll make it cost them more than they count
on. When I can't use my fists I'll use my knife."</p>

<p>The mistress of the establishment, seating herself at the other
end of the lodge, lit her pipe with as much indifference as though
nothing unusual had taken place. Her mongrel pup came trotting
along the space in his sidelong fashion and lay down with his
nose against her slouchy moccasins, thereby proving his bravery,
so far as any offense against his olfactories was concerned. Ogallah
having made his speech and scattered the rabble, turned about
and came slowly after the dog, seating himself near the middle
of the lodge, where he also lit his long-stemmed pipe.</p>

<p>Just then some one pushed the bison skin aside, and stepped within
the residence. Despite his sluggish manner, Ogallah flirted his
head like a flash, probably suspecting that one of Jack's tormentors
had dared to follow him within his shelter. But the individual
was a full-grown warrior, who would not have descended to such
business, and the grunt of the sachem was meant as a cordial welcome
to him who grunted in return.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton also glanced at him, and was astonished not a little
to observe that he was the same warrior who had scrutinized him
so closely while the war feast was going on, and whom, the youth
was well convinced, he had met elsewhere.</p>

<p>There could be no mistake as to the interest which the visitor
felt in the captive, for his black, penetrating eyes were not
removed from him during the several minutes which followed his
entry into the lodge. Not only that, but halting in front of the
lad, he began talking and gesticulating with useless vigor, inasmuch
as Jack could not gain an inkling of what was meant. Indeed, had
the youth attempted afterward to describe the gestures, he would
have referred to them all as pointless, excepting the series which
consisted of a violent sweep of both arms to the westward, after
pointing his finger at the wondering Jack Carleton. Altogether
at a loss as to their significance, it was fortunate (as will
appear hereafter), that the lad was able to recall and describe
the motions to another, who had a hundred fold more woodcraft
and mental acumen than he.</p>

<p>Poor Jack could only shake his head and smile sadly by way of
reply to this performance, and, after Ogallah had added something,
the warrior ceased, took his seat beside the chief and employed
himself in smoking and talking.</p>

<p>"Who <em>can</em> he be? He knows me and <em>I&mdash;</em>ah! I remember!"</p>

<p>Sure enough, and why had he not thought of it before? He was
one of the five Indians who had left the other five and gone off
with Otto Relstaub, on the day that he and Jack Carleton were
captured by the band so near their own home. More than that, Jack
had seen the others that same morning in the village at the war
feast, though the recollection of them was so shadowy that it
had not caused him the perplexity produced by the appearance of
the warrior before him.</p>

<p>With the truth came the startling question &mdash;Where was Otto?
While his captors were in the village, he certainly was elsewhere.
What had become of him?</p>

<p>The question fairly took away the breath of Jack and made him
faint at heart.</p>

<p>"He can't be at home, for Otto never could have made his escape
from them; <em>he must be dead!</em>"</p>

<p>The first declaration of the youth my reader knows was true,
for the visit of Deerfoot, several days later to Martinsville,
as has been described, proved it. As to the second theory, that
will be investigated in due time.</p>

<p>One of the most trying features of this occurrence was the certainty
Jack felt that the Indian visitor was trying to tell him something
about Otto. Those swinging arms, swaying head and apoplectic grunting
carried a message within themselves, which, if translated would
be found of great importance; but alas! the interpreter had not
come.</p>

<p>While the lad sat on the bison robe, reflecting over the matter,
he became aware of the peculiar sensations that alarmed him some
time before. His head was dizzy, a curious lightness took possession
of his limbs, and he felt that if he should undertake to cross
the lodge, he would stagger and fall like a drunken man.</p>

<p>"I'm going to be ill," he said, pressing his hand to his forehead;
"something is wrong with me."</p>

<p>The shock which came with the conviction was deepened by the
belief that he was about to go through the experience that had
befallen poor Otto Relstaub.</p>

<p>"He fell sick while tramping through the woods with the Indians,
and they have either tomahawked or left him to die. These people
with all their Medicine Men and Women know nothing about curing
sick folks, and if I <em>do</em> become ill that will be the end
of me."</p>

<p>The boy was in anything but a cheerful frame of mind, but he
faced the position like a hero. He did not lose heart, though
he was sure that his situation was worse than ever before, and
he did not forget any of the incidents of the journey from Kentucky
to Louisiana, when many a time there seemed not the slightest
ground for hope.</p>

<p>After smoking awhile Ogallah and his visitor got up and went
out doors. The chief was gone but a short time when he came back,
and, as he resumed his seat, grunted out something to his squaw,
who immediately laid down her pipe, tenderly shoved the nose of
her dog aside and left the place.</p>

<p>While Jack was wondering what the meaning of these movements
could be, the attack of weakness which had alarmed him passed
off, like the fleeing shadow of a cloud. It was followed by a
natural rebound of spirits, and he too rose to his feet and walked
toward the door.</p>

<p>The sachem looked inquiringly at him, but showed no objection
to his departure. The boy placed his hand at his waist to make
sure his hunting knife was there, and at the entrance paused a
moment in doubt.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether they will set on me again," he said to himself;
"if they do I will use my weapon&mdash;that's certain, and then there
will be a bigger rumpus than before."</p>

<p>The knowledge that the chief who had served so many times as
friend was near at hand added much to Jack's courage, when he
finally let the bison-skin door drop behind him.</p>

<p>The explanation of the squaw's departure was manifest at once.
She had a long sharpened stick in her hands, with which she was
stirring the earth around some hills of corn growing on a small
plot near their lodge. Extending his gaze, Jack saw many other
squaws engaged in the same manner, but among them all was not
a single man. They were lolling in their wigwams, smoking or dozing,
or hunting in the woods for game or scalps.</p>

<p>The younger members of the community seemed to be the happiest
of all. A number were playing by the river, and some were plunging
into the stream, swimming, diving, and disporting themselves like
porpoises; others were deep in some kind of game, on the clearing
near the woods, and all were as shouting and demonstrative as
so many civilized youngsters engaged in a game of ball.</p>

<p>Anxious to learn whether his last affray with his persecutors
was likely to lessen or increase their hostility, Jack Carleton
gradually advanced from the lodge until he was close to the group
playing on the large cleared space, while those by the river were
much nearer his refuge than he.</p>

<p>This was assuming considerable risk, as all must admit, but the
boy took it with much caution and with his eyes wide open, meaning
to make the most hurried kind of retreat the instant it might
become necessary.</p>
