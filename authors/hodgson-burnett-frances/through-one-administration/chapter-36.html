<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The great social event of the following week was to be the ball given
yearly for the benefit of a certain popular and fashionable charity.
There was no charity so fashionable, and consequently no ball so well
attended; everybody was more or less interested; everybody of importance
appeared at it, showing themselves for a few moments at least. Even Mrs.
Merriam, who counted among the privileges earned by a long and
unswervingly faithful social career, the one of immunity from all
ordinary society duties, found herself drawn into the maelstrom, and
enrolled on the list of patronesses.
</p>
<p>"You may do all the work, my dear," she said to Mrs. Sylvestre, "and I
will appropriate the credit."
</p><p>But she was not so entirely idle as she professed to be, and indeed
spent several mornings briskly driving from place to place in her
comfortable carriage, and distinguished herself by exhibiting an
executive ability, a promptness and decision in difficulty, which were
regarded with secret awe and admiration by her younger and less
experienced colleagues. She had been out doing such work on the
afternoon of the day before the ball, and returned home at her usual
hour; but not in her usual equable frame of mind. This was evident when
she entered the room where Mrs. Sylvestre sat talking to Colonel
Tredennis, who had called. There were indeed such signs of mental
disturbance in her manner that Mrs. Sylvestre, rising to greet her,
observed them at once.
</p><p>"I am afraid you have had an exciting morning," she said, "and have done
too much work."
</p><p>"My dear," was the reply, "nothing could be more true than that I have
had an exciting morning."
</p><p>"I am sorry for that," said Agnes.
</p><p>"I am sorry for it," said Mrs. Merriam; "more sorry than I can say."
Then turning to Tredennis, "I am glad to find you here. I have been
hearing some most extraordinary stories; perhaps you can tell me what
they mean."
</p><p>"Whom do they concern?" asked Agnes. "We are entertained by many
stories."
</p><p>"They will disturb you as much as they have disturbed me," Mrs. Merriam
answered. "They have disturbed me very much. They concern our little
friend, Mrs. Amory."
</p><p>"Bertha!" exclaimed Agnes.
</p><p>Her tender heart beat quickly, and a faint flush showed itself on her
cheek; she looked up at Colonel Tredennis with quick, questioning eyes.
Perhaps she was not as unprepared for the statement as she might have
been. She had seen much during the last few weeks which had startled and
alarmed her. Mrs. Merriam looked at Tredennis also.
</p><p>"You may be able to guess something of what the rumors form themselves
upon," she said. "Heaven knows there has been enough foundation for
anything in that miserable Westoria land scheme."
</p><p>"You have heard something of it this morning?" said Tredennis.
</p><p>"I have heard nothing else," was the answer. "The Westoria land scheme
has come to an untimely end, with a flavor of scandal about it, which
may yet terminate in an investigation. The whole city is full of it, and
stories of Mrs. Amory and her husband are the entertainment offered you
on all sides. I say 'Mrs. Amory and her husband,' because it is Mrs.
Amory who is the favorite topic. She has been making the most desperate
efforts to influence people; her parlors have been filled with
politicians and lobbyists all the season; the husband was deeply
involved in the matter; bribes have been offered and taken; there are
endless anecdotes of Senator Planefield and his infatuation, and the
way in which it has been used. She would have accomplished wonders if it
had not been for Senator Blundel, who suspected her and led her into
betraying herself. It is Senator Blundel who is credited with having
been the means of exploding the whole affair. He has been privately
investigating the matter for months, and had an interview with Mrs.
Amory the other night, in which he accused her of the most terrible
things, and threatened her with exposure. That is the way the stories
run."
</p><p>"Oh, this is very cruel," said Agnes. "We must do something. We must
try; we cannot let such things be said without making an effort against
them."
</p><p>"Whatever is done must be done at once," replied Mrs. Merriam. "The
conclusion of the matter is that there seems actually to be a sort of
cabal formed against her."
</p><p>"You mean"--began Agnes, anxiously.
</p><p>"I mean," said Mrs. Merriam, "that my impression is that if she appears
at the ball there are those who will be so rude to her that she will be
unable to remain."
</p><p>"Aunt Mildred!" exclaimed Agnes, in deep agitation. "Surely such a thing
is impossible."
</p><p>"It is not only not impossible," returned Mrs. Merriam, "but it is
extremely probable. I heard remarks which assured me of that."
</p><p>"She must not go!" said Agnes. "We must manage to keep her at home.
Colonel Tredennis"--
</p><p>"The remedy must go deeper than that," he answered. "The fact that she
did not appear would only postpone the end. The slights she avoided one
night would be stored up for the future, we may be sure."
</p><p>He endeavored to speak calmly, but it was not easy, and he knew too well
that such a change had come upon his face as the two women could not but
see. Though he had feared this climax so long, though he had even seen
day by day the signs of its approach, it fell upon him as a blow at
last, and seemed even worse than in his most anxious hour he had thought
it might be.
</p><p>"She has friends," he said; "her friends have friends. I think there are
those--besides ourselves--who will defend her."
</p><p>"They must be strong," remarked Mrs. Merriam.
</p><p>"There are some of them," he answered, "who are strong. I think I know a
lady whose opinion will not go for nothing, who is generous enough to
use her influence in the right direction."
</p><p>"And that direction?" said Mrs. Merriam.
</p><p>"If the opposing party finds itself met by a party more powerful than
itself," he said, "its tone will change; and as for the story of Senator
Blundel I think I can arrange that he will attend to that himself."
</p><p>"Mere denial would not go very far, I am afraid," said Mrs. Merriam. "He
cannot deny it to two or three score of people."
</p><p>"He can deny it to the entire community," he answered, "by showing that
their intimacy remains unbroken."
</p><p>"Ah!" cried Agnes, "if he would only go to the ball, and let people see
him talking to her as he used to; but I am sure he never went to a ball
in his life!"
</p><p>"My dear," said Mrs. Merriam, "that is really a very clever idea, if he
could be induced to go."
</p><p>"He is an honest man," said Tredennis, flushing. "And he is her friend.
I believe that sincerely; and I believe he would prove it by going
anywhere to serve her."
</p><p>"If that is true," said Mrs. Merriam, "a great deal will be
accomplished, though it is a little difficult to figure to one's self
how he would enjoy a ball."
</p><p>"I think we shall have the pleasure of seeing," replied the colonel. "I
myself"--He paused a moment, and then added: "I chance to have a rather
intimate acquaintance with him; he has interested himself in some work
of mine lately, and has shown himself very friendly to me. It would
perhaps be easier for me to speak to him than for any other friend of
Mrs. Amory."
</p><p>"I think you would do it better than any other friend," Mrs. Merriam
said, with a kindly look at him.
</p><p>The truth was that, since his first introduction to Colonel Tredennis,
Blundel had taken care that the acquaintance should not drop. He had
found the modest warrior at once useful and entertaining. He had been
able to gather from him information which it was his interest to count
among his stores, and, having obtained it, was not ungrateful, and,
indeed, was led by his appreciation of certain good qualities he
recognized in him into something bordering on an attachment for his new
friend.
</p><p>"I like that fellow," he used to say, energetically.
</p><p>And realizing something of this friendliness, and more of the honor and
worth of his acquaintance, the colonel felt that he might hope to reach
his heart by telling his story simply and with dignity, leaving the rest
to him. As for the lady of whom he had spoken, he had but little doubt
that that kind and generous heart might be reached; he had seen
evidences of its truth and charity too often to distrust them. It was,
of course, the wife of the Secretary of State he was thinking of,--that
good and graceful gentlewoman, whose just and clear judgment he knew he
could rely upon, and whose friendship would grant him any favor.
</p><p>"She is very generous and sympathetic," he said, "and I have heard her
speak most kindly of Mrs. Amory. Her action in the matter must have
weight, and I have confidence that she will show her feeling in a manner
which will make a deep impression. She has always been fond of Professor
Herrick."
</p><p>"That is as clever an idea as the other," said Mrs. Merriam. "She has
drawn her lines so delicately heretofore that she has an influence even
greater than was wielded by most of those who have occupied her
position. And she is a decided and dignified person, capable of social
subtleties."
</p><p>"Oh!" exclaimed Mrs. Sylvestre, "it seems very hard that it should be
Bertha who should need such defence."
</p><p>"It is miserable," said Mrs. Merriam, impatiently. "It is disgraceful
when one considers who is the person to blame. It is very delicate of us
not to use names, I suppose; but there has been enough delicacy--and
indelicacy--and I should like to use them as freely as other people do.
I think you remember that I have not been very fond of Mr. Richard
Amory."
</p><p>When Colonel Tredennis left them he turned his steps at once toward the
house of the woman who was his friend, and upon whose assistance so much
depended. To gain her sympathy seemed the first thing to be done, and
one thought repeated itself again and again in his mind, "How shall I
say it best?"
</p><p>But fortune favored him, and helped him to speak as he had not
anticipated that it would.
</p><p>The lady sat alone in her favorite chair in her favorite room, when he
was ushered into her presence, as he had frequently happened to be
before somewhere about the same hour. A book lay open upon her lap, but
she was not reading it, and, he fancied, had not been doing so for some
time. He also fancied that when she saw him her greeting glance had a
shade of relief in it, and her first words seemed to certify that he was
not mistaken.
</p><p>"I am more than usually glad to see you," she said. "I think that if you
had not appeared so opportunely I should have decided in about half an
hour that I must send for you."
</p><p>"I am very fortunate to have come," he answered, and he held her kind
hand a moment, and there came into his face a look so anxious that,
being in the habit of observing him, she saw it.
</p><p>"Are you very well?" she asked, gently. "I am afraid not. You are
rather pale. Sit down by my chair and let me look at you."
</p><p>"Am I pale?" said the colonel. "You are very good to notice it, though I
am not ill. I am only--only"--
</p><p>She looked at him with grave interest.
</p><p>"Have you," she said,--"have you heard ill news of some friend? Is that
it? I am afraid it is!"
</p><p>"Yes," he answered, "that is it; and I am afraid you have heard of it,
too."
</p><p>"I am afraid I have," she returned. "Such things travel quickly. I have
heard something which has distressed me very much. It is something I
have heard faint rumors of before, but now it has taken on a definite
form. This morning I was out, and this afternoon I have had some callers
who were not averse to speaking plainly. I have heard a great many
things said which have given me pain, and which embarrass me seriously.
That was the reason I was wishing to see you. I felt that you would at
least tell me a story without prejudice. There is a great deal of
prejudice shown, of course. We need expect nothing else. I am sure
Professor Herrick can know nothing of this. Will you tell me what you
yourself know?"
</p><p>"That is what I came to do," said the colonel, still paler, perhaps.
"There is a great deal to tell--more than the world will ever know. It
is only to such as you that it could be told."
</p><p>There was more emotion in his voice and face than he had meant to
reveal; perhaps something in the kind anxiousness of his companion's
eyes moved him; he found that he could not sit still and speak as if his
interest was only the common one of an outsider, so he rose and stood
before her.
</p><p>"I cannot even tell you how it is that I know what I do to be true," he
said. "I have only my word, but I <u>know</u> you will believe me."
</p><p>"You may be sure of that," she answered.
</p><p>"I <u>am</u> sure of it," he returned, "or I should not be here, for I have
no other proof to offer. I came to make an appeal to you in behalf of a
person who has been wronged."
</p><p>"In behalf of Mrs. Amory?" she said.
</p><p>"Yes," he replied, "though she does not know I am here, and will never
know it. It scarcely seems my business, perhaps; she should have others
to defend her; but there are no others who, having the interest of
relationship, might not be accused of self-interest too. There is a
slight tie of kinship between us, but it is only a slight one, and we
have not always been very good friends, perhaps, though it must have
been my own fault. I think I never pleased her very well, even when I
saw her oftenest. She was used to brighter companionship. But her father
liked me; we were friends, warm and close. I have felt almost as if I
was his son, and have tried to spare him the knowledge of what would
have hurt him. During the last few weeks I think he has had suspicions
which have disturbed him, but they have not been suspicions of trouble
to his child."
</p><p>"I felt sure of that," the lady remarked.
</p><p>"<u>She</u> has no suspicions of the true aspect of affairs," he continued,
"though she has lately gained knowledge of the wrong done her. It has
been a great wrong. She has not been spared. Her inexperience made her a
child in the hands of those who used her as their tool. She understands
now that it is too late--and it is very bitter to her."
</p><p>"You knew her when she was a girl," his companion said, with her kind
eyes on his sad, stern face.
</p><p>"Yes," he answered, "when she was a girl and happy, and with all of life
before her, and--she did not fear it."
</p><p>"I knew her, too," she replied. "She has greatly changed since then."
</p><p>"I saw that when I returned here," he said. And he turned his head aside
and began to take up and set down a trifle on the mantel. "At first I
did not understand it," he added. "Now I do. She has not changed without
reason. If she has seemed light, there are women, I suppose, who hide
many a pain in that way. She has loved her children, and made them
happy--I know that, at least--and--and she has been a kind wife and an
innocent woman. It is her friends who must defend her."
</p><p>"She needs their defence," said his hearer. "I felt that when I was out
this morning, and when my callers were with me, an hour ago." She held
out her hand with sympathetic frankness. "I am her friend," she said,
"and her father's--and yours. I think you have some plan; there is
something you wish me to do. Tell me what it is."
</p><p>"Yes," he answered, "there is something I wish you to do. No one else
can do it so well. There are people who intend to testify to their
belief in the stories they have heard by offering her open slights. It
is likely that the attempt will be made to-morrow night at the ball. If
you testify to your disbelief and disapproval by giving her your
protection, the popular theory will be shaken, and there will be a
reaction in her favor."
</p><p>"It is not to be denied," she said, "that it is only women who can aid
her. It is women who say these things, as a rule, and who can unsay
them. The actions of men in such matters are of less weight than they
should be, though it is true there is one man who might do her a
service"--
</p><p>"You are thinking of Senator Blundel," he said. "I--we have thought of
that. We think--hope that he will come to the ball."
</p><p>"If he does, and shows himself friendly toward her," she returned,
"nothing more can be said which could be of much importance. He is the
hero of the story, as I dare say you have heard. If he remains her
friend, that proves that he did not accuse her of plotting against him,
and that he has no cause for offence. If the story of the grand scene
between them is untrue, the foundation-stone is taken away, and, having
the countenance of a few people who show their confidence with tact and
discretion, she is safe. I will go to the ball, my friend, and I will
use what influence I possess to insure that she is not badly treated."
</p><p>"I knew you would be kind to her," Tredennis said, with kindling eyes.
"I have seen you kind before to those who needed kindness, even to those
who did not deserve it--and she does!"
</p><p>"Yes, yes, I am sure she does!" she answered. "Poor child! Poor child!"
</p><p>And she gave him her hand again, and, as he wrung it in his, her eyes
were fuller of sympathy than ever.
</p>
<p>He reached Senator Blundel's rooms an hour later, and found him in the
midst of his papers and pigeon-holes,--letters and pamphlets to right of
him, to left of him, before and behind him.
</p><p>"Well," he said, by way of greeting, "our Westoria friends are out of
humor this morning."
</p><p>"So I have heard," Tredennis answered.
</p><p>"And they may well be--they may well be," he said, nodding sharply. "And
there are some fine stories told, of course."
</p><p>"I have come to tell you one myself, sir," said Tredennis.
</p><p>"What!" cried Blundel, turning on his chair,--"you have a story?"
</p><p>"Yes," returned the colonel, "not a pleasant one, and as it concerns you
I will waste as few words as possible."
</p><p>He wasted no words at all. The story was a brief one, but as forcible as
simple words could make it. There was no effort to give it
effectiveness, and yet there were touches here and there which appealed
to the man who heard it as he had been rarely appealed to before. They
brought before him things which had found a lodging in corners of his
practical political mind, and had haunted him rather pathetically since
the night he had shrugged himself into his overcoat, and left the
slight, desolate-looking figure behind him. He had enjoyed his
friendship too much not to regret it now that he felt it was a thing of
the past; he had felt the loss more than once of the new element it had
introduced into his life, and had cast about in his mind in vain for a
place where he could spend a spare hour or so as pleasantly as he had
often spent such hours in a bright parlor he knew of. Before Tredennis
had half finished his relation he was moving restlessly in his chair,
and uttering occasional gruff ejaculations, and when it came to an end
he sprang up, looking not a trifle heated.
</p><p>"That's it, is it?" he exclaimed. "They have been inventing something
new about her, have they, and dragged me into it into the bargain? And
they are making up plots against her,--poor little woman!--as if she
hadn't been treated badly enough. A lot of gossips, I'll wager!"
</p><p>"Some of them are good enough," said the colonel. "They only mean to
signify their disapproval of what they would have the right to condemn
if it were a truth instead of a lie."
</p><p>"Well, they shall not do it at my expense, that's all," was the answer.
"It is a lie from beginning to end, and I will do something toward
proving it to them. I don't disapprove of her,--they shall see that.
She's a genuine good little thing. She's a lady. Any fool can see that.
She won <u>me</u> over, by George! when everything was against her. And she
accused nobody when she might have said some pretty hard true things,
and nine women out of ten would have raised the very deuce. She's got
courage, and--yes, and dignity, and a spirit of her own that has helped
her to bear many a bitter thing without losing her hold on herself, I'd
be willing to swear. Look here," he added, turning suddenly and facing
Tredennis, "how much do you know of her troubles? Something, I know, or
you wouldn't be here."
</p><p>"Yes," answered the colonel, "I know something."
</p><p>"Well," he continued, in an outburst of feeling, "I don't ask how much.
It's enough, I dare say, to make it safe for me to speak my mind,--I
mean safe for her, not for myself. There's a fellow within a hundred
miles of here I should like to thrash within an inch of his life; and an
elegant, charming, amiable fellow he is too, who, possibly, persuaded
himself that he was doing her very little injury."
</p><p>"The injury has been done nevertheless," said Tredennis, gravely. "And
it is her friends who must right it."
</p><p>"I'm willing to do my share," said Blundel. "And let that fellow keep
out of my way. As to this ball--I never went to a ball in my life, but I
will appear at this one, and show my colors. Wait a minute!" As if an
idea had suddenly struck him. "Go to the ball?--I'll <u>take her</u> there
myself."
</p><p>The spirit of combat was aroused within him; the idea presented itself
to him with such force that he quite enjoyed it. Here, arraigned on one
side, were these society scandal-mongers and fine ladies; here, on the
other, was himself, Samuel Blundel, rough and blunt, but determined
enough to scatter them and their lies to the four winds. He rather
revelled in the thought of the struggle, if struggle there was to be. He
had taken active part in many a row in the House in which the odds had
been against him, and where his obstinate strength had outlived the
subtle readiness of a dozen apparently better equipped men. And his
heart was in this deed of valor too; it glowed within him as he thought
how much really depended upon him. Now, this pretty, bright creature
must turn to him for protection and support. He almost felt as if he
held her gloved hand resting upon his burly arm already with a clinging
touch.
</p><p>"I'll take her myself," he repeated. "I'll go and see her myself, and
explain the necessity of it--if she does not know all."
</p><p>"She does not know all yet," said Tredennis, "and I think she was
scarcely inclined to go to the ball; but I am sure it will be better
that she should go."
</p><p>"She will go," said Blundel, abruptly. "I'll make her. She knows <u>me</u>.
She will go if I tell her she must. That is what comes of being an old
fellow, you see, and not a lady's man."
</p><p>He had not any doubt of his success with her, and, to tell the truth,
neither had Colonel Tredennis. He saw that his blunt honesty and
unceremonious, half-paternal domineering would prove to her that he was
in the right, even if she were at first reluctant; and this being
settled, and the matter left in Blundel's hands, the colonel went away.
Only before going he said a few words, rather awkwardly.
</p><p>"There would be nothing to be gained by mentioning my name," he said.
"It is mere accident that--that I chance to know what I have spoken of.
She does not know that I know it. I should prefer that she should not."
</p><p>"What!" said Blundel,--"she is not to know how you have been standing by
her?"
</p><p>"She knows that I would stand by her if she needed me. She does not need
me; she needs you. I have nothing to do with the matter. I don't wish to
be mentioned."
</p><p>When he was gone Blundel rubbed his hair backward and then forward by
way of variety.
</p><p>"Queer fellow!" he said, meditatively. "Not quite sure I've exactly got
at him yet. Brave as a lion and shy as a boy. Absolutely afraid of
women."
