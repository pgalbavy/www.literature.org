TWO MEN were journeying together.  One of them picked up an axe
that lay upon the path, and said, "I have found an axe."  "Nay, my
friend," replied the other, "do not say 'I,' but 'We' have found
an axe."  They had not gone far before they saw the owner of the
axe pursuing them, and he who had picked up the axe said, "We are
undone."  "Nay," replied the other, "keep to your first mode of
speech, my friend; what you thought right then, think right now. 
Say 'I,' not 'We' are undone."  
 
He who shares the danger ought to share the prize.
