<p>On one of Brownie Beaver's long excursions down the stream he came
upon a tree to which a sign was nailed. Now, Brownie had never learned
to read. But he had heard that Uncle Jerry Chuck could tell what a
sign said. So Brownie asked a pleasant young fellow named Frisky
Squirrel if he would mind asking Uncle Jerry to come over to Swift
River on a matter of important business.
</p>
<p>When Uncle Jerry Chuck appeared, Brownie Beaver said he was glad to
see him and that Uncle Jerry was looking very well.
</p><p>"I've sent for you," said Brownie, "because I wanted you to see this
sign. I can tell by the tracks under the tree that the sign was put up
only to-day. And I thought you ought to know about it at once, Uncle
Jerry."
</p><p>As soon as he heard that, Uncle Jerry Chuck stepped close to the tree
and began to read the sign.
</p><p>Now, there was something about Uncle Jerry's reading that Brownie
Beaver had heard. People had told him that Uncle Jerry Chuck couldn't
tell what a sign said unless he read it <u>aloud</u>. That was why Brownie
Beaver had sent for him, for Brownie knew Uncle Jerry well enough to
guess that if anybody <u>asked</u> Uncle Jerry to read the sign, Uncle
Jerry would insist on being paid for his trouble.
</p><p>But now Uncle Jerry was going to read the sign for himself. And
Brownie Beaver moved up beside him, to hear what he said.
</p><p>The sign looked like this:
</p><p><strong>NO HUNTING</strong>
</p><p><strong>OR FISHING</strong>
</p><p><strong>ALOUD</strong>
</p><p>Uncle Jerry repeated the words in a sing-song tone.
</p><p>"I don't think much of that," he said. "It's bad enough to be hunted
by people who make a noise, though you have <u>some</u> chance of getting
away then. But if they can't make a noise it will be much more
dangerous for all of us forest-people."
</p><p>If Tommy Fox hadn't happened to come along just then Uncle Jerry
wouldn't have found out his mistake. But Tommy Fox soon set him right.
As soon as he had talked a bit with Uncle Jerry he said:
</p><p>"What the sign really means is that no hunting or fishing will be
permitted. That last word should be 'allowed,' instead of 'aloud.'
It's spelled wrong," he explained.
</p><p>"That's better!" Uncle Jerry cried. "Now there'll be no more hunting
in the neighborhood and we'll all be quite safe.... Farmer Green is
kinder than I supposed."
</p><p>When Brownie Beaver heard that, he said good-by and started home at
once to tell the good news to all his friends. He had leaped into the
river and was swimming up-stream rapidly when Uncle Jerry called to
him to stop.
</p><p>"There's something I want to say," Uncle Jerry shouted. "I think you
ought to pay me for reading the sign."
</p><p>But Brownie Beaver shook his head.
</p><p>"I didn't ask you to read the sign for me," he declared. "You read it
for <u>yourself</u>, Uncle Jerry. And besides, you didn't know what it
meant until Tommy Fox came along and told you.... If you want to know
what I think, I'll tell you. I think you ought to pay Tommy Fox
something."
</p><p>Uncle Jerry at once began to look worried. He said nothing more, but
plunged out of sight into some bushes, as if he were afraid Tommy Fox
might come back and find him.
