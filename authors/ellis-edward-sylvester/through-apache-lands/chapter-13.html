<p>Ned had enough sense not to undertake to run away from the Apaches
until there was a reasonably good chance of succeeding. He had
played the game of lameness so well that he had secured considerable
liberty thereby; and when, therefore, he went limping beyond the
further limit of the Indians, no one supposed he had any other
purpose in view than to obtain a better place in which to help
himself to water. The trees among which he entered were almost
without undergrowth, and, fortunately, were in exactly the opposite
direction from where the mustangs were grazing. This left the
way entirely open for him to do his utmost in the way of his dash
for freedom. It may seem to have been unfortunate in the one thing,
that it caused the lad to go away without his horse; but he would
have left the latter had he been given his chance, for he believed
that while the trail of the animal could be followed without trouble,
and might secure his being run to the ground in the end, yet he
could readily find the means of hiding his own footsteps from
the most skillful of the Apaches.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the instant he found himself
beyond the immediate sight of his captors, his lameness disappeared
as if by magic, and he dashed down the stream with all the speed
at his command. After running nearly two hundred yards he suddenly
paused and listened. Nothing could be heard but his own hurried
breathing and throbbing heart.</p>

<p>"They haven't found out anything about me yet," was his hurried
exclamation, as he started off again, continually ejaculating
a prayer that he might succeed, for he needed no one to tell him
that it was really a matter of life and death; for, if Lone Wolf
should place hands upon him again, he would never forgive the
attempt.</p>

<p>A hundred yards further in this headlong fashion, and all at
once he found himself at the termination of the wood, which had
been such an advantage to him thus far. On the right and left,
over the high, precipitous mountains back of him, was the small
wood, on the other border of which was the Apache camp. The gorge
or valley, in the center of which he found himself standing, wound
in and out among the mountains before him,&mdash;a Devil's Pass on
a smaller scale,&mdash;so sinuous in its course that he could trace
it only a short distance ahead with the eye. Directly at his side
flowed a mountain stream, varying from a dozen to twenty feet
in width, so clear that in every place he could see distinctly
the bottom. The current was quite swift, and in some places it
dashed and foamed over the rocks almost like a cascade.</p>

<p>Ned dared not hesitate, but, pausing only an instant to catch
breath, he dashed away again until he reached the curve in the
ravine, beyond which he would be hid from view of the encampment.
The moment this was reached he paused long enough to cast back
a searching glance. But all looked as calm and peaceful as if
no human being had ever entered the ravine.</p>

<p>"They haven't found it out yet! They haven't found it out yet!"
he exclaimed, his heart rising with hope. "That was a pretty smart
thing in me to pretend to be lame, and if it hadn't been for that
I wouldn't have got half the start."</p>

<p>Passing the turn in the ravine, he felt that it would not do
to wait any longer without some effort to hide his trail. There
was but one feasible way of accomplishing this, and that was by
entering the stream and keeping along it far enough to throw the
wolves off the scent. It was not a very pleasant task to enter
the water and move along, where, at any moment, he was liable
to drop down over his head; but he did not dare to stand upon
trifles, and in he went. By keeping close to the shore, he managed
to avoid any such unpleasant ducking, while at the same time he
effectually hid his footsteps from the eyes of the keenest-sighted
Indian. A short distance ahead he found the trees were growing
fully as thickly as in the grove which he had left but a short
time before, and he made all haste thither, continually glancing
back, dreading least he should catch sight of some of the Apaches
on the hunt for him.</p>

<p>Imagine his consternation, when, on the very margin of the wood,
he looked back and saw the forms of two Indians only a short distance
away! They were mounted upon their mustangs and riding at a walk
almost in a direct line toward him, and, as he stared at them
he was sure that their slow pace was due to their careful scrutiny
of the trail which he was satisfied he must have left.</p>

<p>"They have found me out," he gasped, as he turned and hurried
down stream again.</p>

<p>Ned was too frightened to reflect that their actions were such
as to indicate that they were hunters, who were out merely for
game, and there is no telling how far he would have kept up his
flight in the stream, had he not been checked by what he believed
to be a providential interference in his behalf.</p>

<p>The water was broad, moderately deep, and quite clear; but the
overhanging trees threw out so much shade that the bottom was
invisible, so that, scrutinize as much as they chose, the redskins
could not detect the slightest trace of his footprints upon the
bed of the stream. The only difficulty that remained was to leave
the water in such a way that his pursuers should be baffled in
any attempt to discover the point. This was an exceedingly difficult
question to solve, and while he was searching for some suitable
place, and growing terribly frightened lest his two foes should
pounce down upon him, he noticed a large tree that projected over
the water. The foliage was dense and the tree seemed to be hollow.
Besides this, one of the limbs hung so low that, by making an
upward spring, he was able to catch it with both hands. He then
drew himself upward, and carefully crawled along until he reached
the trunk. To his surprise and delight, he found it the very concealment
he needed above all others. The trunk was large and hollow, and
on the upper side was an aperture, probably caused by the rotting
away of a limb, large enough to permit the passage of his body.</p>

<p>After peering for a few seconds into the impenetrable darkness,
Ned shoved his feet through, and carefully followed with his body.
He cautiously shoved himself along, until his head was below the
level of the opening, when he paused, believing that he was concealed
in the best manner possible. The lad had absolutely left no trace
behind him; the searching Apaches were without any means of discovering
what he had done, and all he had to do was to remain where he
was until the hunt was over. The tree, slanting out over the water,
made his posture a half reclining one, and as comfortable as it
is possible to imagine. His limbs were somewhat chilled by the
wetting they had received, but that troubled him very little,
his whole thoughts, naturally, being centered upon the one of
getting away from the Apaches. It seemed to him that his senses
were preternaturally sharpened, and the rustling of a fallen leaf
startled him into the belief that one of the redskins was crawling
out upon the trunk; but a full half hour passed without presenting
anything of a tangible nature, and hope became very strong in
his breast again.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether those horsemen were hunting for me?" he muttered,
as he became more deliberate in his speculations. "I was sure
a little while ago that they were, but it may be that I was mistaken.
I don't think they would come on their mustangs if they wanted
to find me, for they couldn't make much use of them in following
me to a place like this."</p>

<p>Whether or not these two men were his pursuers mattered very
little; for there could be no doubt that his absence had been
noticed or that the most skillful trailers were in pursuit. They
could not fail to learn that he had taken to the stream and would
naturally hunt along the shore to discover where he had left it.
This would be likely to bring them very close to where he was
hidden, and he trembled as he reflected upon the possible, if
not probable, result.</p>

<p>The sun was going down in the west; the shadows in the wood gradually
deepened; in his reclining position, Ned Chadmund found a heavy
drowsiness stealing over him. The afternoon was no more than half
gone when his eyes closed in a refreshing sleep, which continued
several hours, and might have lasted still longer had it not been
broken. It was far into the night when the sleeping lad suddenly
opened his eyes without understanding the cause of his doing so.
Something had aroused him, but he could not divine what it was.
His posture had become somewhat cramped from his long continuance
in it and he shifted about so as to rest upon the other side.
As he did so, he became aware that some one or something else
was near him. The slightest possible rustling at the base of the
trunk directed his attention there, but there was too much intervening
shrubbery for him to detect anything at all. Everything in that
direction was shrouded in the densest gloom. The moon was directly
overhead, and shining so that he was able to see for some little
distance when he turned his glance from the trunk. Remembering
his revolver, the boy reached down and drew it from within his
waistcoat, where he had concealed it.</p>

<p>"If anybody wants to run against that, let him do so," he said
to himself. "It has five good charges which I will use up before
they shall lay hands upon me or Lone Wolf shall call me his prisoner
again."</p>

<p>It seemed to him that, in case of discovery, his position might
place him at a great disadvantage, so he carefully drew his head
and shoulders out of the trunk, so as to leave his arms free to
use. This was scarcely done when he caught the same sound below
him, repeated so distinctly that he knew on the instant what it
meant. It was a scratching, rattling of bark, such as would be
made by the claws of an animal in picking its way along, and as
he strained his eyes through the gloom, he saw very faintly the
outlines of some wild animal approaching him, a low, threatening
growl at the same time establishing the identity of the bear beyond
question.</p>

<p>Ned was about to give him the contents of one barrel, when he
was restrained by the recollection that his ammunition was exceedingly
precious and that the report of the pistol was likely to bring
some one whom he dreaded more than the fiercest wild beasts of
the forest. So he decided to try milder means at first. Accordingly,
the endangered lad tried to see whether the animal could not be
frightened away without really hurting him. Breaking off a piece
of bark, he flung it in his face, giving utterance, at the same
time, to a growl as savage as that of the beast himself. The latter
instantly paused, as if puzzled to understand what it meant, but
he did not retreat. He merely stood his ground and growled back
again. Encouraged even by this dubious success, Ned threw more
bark, made more noise, and flung his arms so wildly that he came
very near throwing his revolver out of his grasp into the creek.</p>

<p>But it would not work. The bear was not born in the woods to
be frightened by any such trifles, and, halting for scarcely twenty
seconds, he advanced with the calm deliberation of a brute bent
upon clearing up the mystery without any unnecessary delay. Instead
of giving him the contents of one of the chambers of the revolver,
the young hunter drew back within the hollow of the tree, as a
turtle is seen to retreat within his shell when affrighted at
the approach of some enemy. It was a tight squeeze, but he insinuated
himself along the open space until quite sure that he was beyond
the reach of the monster. There he found he had barely room to
use his arms, but, pointing his weapon toward the opening, he
awaited the action of bruin.</p>

<p>There was sufficient moonlight to perceive the opening, but he
had scarcely time to glance at it when it was darkened by the
bear, which thrust its head in with a thunderous growl that made
the lad shiver from head to foot. Certain that it would not do
to wait any longer, and believing that he meant to force his entire
body through, the sorely frightened Ned discharged one barrel
squarely in the face of the bear.</p>

<p>This settled matters. The latter had his snout and enough of
his head shoved into the opening to receive a bad wound from the
weapon, discharged within a foot or two of his face. He gave a
sort of snarling howl, and jerked out his feet so suddenly that
he must have injured himself still more by doing so, and, with
a relief that can hardly be understood, Ned heard him clawing
hastily along the trunk until he reached the land, when he scampered
away into the woods, and nothing more was seen of him.</p>

<p>"If I had plenty of ammunition, I would not begrudge that shot,"
muttered Ned, as he carefully worked his way along the hollow
again. "But that leaves me only four shots, and there's no telling
how soon I'll have to use the rest."</p>

<p>He found, upon reaching the opening again, that the night was
past and the day was breaking. He had obtained a good night's
rest, but he was anxious to get ahead.</p>

<p>"I wonder where Lone Wolf is?" he thought, hesitating whether
he had better descend from his hiding place or not. "It is all
of twelve hours since I ran away and they must have done a good
deal of hunting. Some of them have passed close to where I am,
and they must be lurking about this very minute."</p>

<p>It was this uncertainty which caused the lad to wait some little
time longer before venturing forth. He had been so fortunate up
to this time that he could not afford to throw the chances away.
When he found that the sun was far above the treetops, however,
he began to grow impatient, and finally came to the conclusion
that he was losing valuable time. So he began crawling carefully
out, with the idea of resuming his flight homeward.</p>

<p>Ned was not yet fairly out from the tree, when he paused, for
his ear detected something alarming. It was the soft splash of
water, such as is made by a person who is carefully wading along,
and it sounded fearfully near to where he was.</p>

<p>He assumed at once, because of the peculiar sound, that it must
be caused by some one who was hunting for him, and no one could
be hunting for him except some of the Apaches from whom he fled.
If any doubt remained in his mind, it was removed a moment later,
when he heard a whistle from the same quarter whence came the
sound of the wading. The signal was instantly responded to in
the same manner by some one upon shore.</p>

<p>"They're Indians," he said. "They know that I must be somewhere
in this neighborhood and they've made up their minds to search
until they find me."</p>

<p>For two or three minutes all was as still as the tomb. It seemed
as if the redskins were listening, in the hope of learning something
of the fugitive through their sense of hearing when their eyes
had failed them so long. If such were the case, they were disappointed,
for the boy crouching in the gnarled tree would have suspended
his very breathing, had it been in his power to do so, lest he
should betray himself.</p>

<p>When the splashing noise was heard again, it sounded almost beneath
him, and, yielding to a most dangerous curiosity, which, however,
he could not restrain, he reached one hand into the foliage, drew
it aside and looked down.</p>

<p>Not more than twenty feet distant he saw the figure of Lone Wolf,
the Apache chief!</p>

<p>He stood in the water up to his knees, and, at the moment the
fugitive looked, had passed a short distance beyond the tree,
so that his back only was visible. Had it been a few minutes sooner,
the warrior would have assuredly seen the white, scared face that
peered upon him from among the leaves. But, as it was, he was
all unconscious of the fact that he was so near the prize for
which he and several of his best warriors had been searching for
hours.</p>

<p>Two of them had paused beneath the tree and carefully examined
the branches without discerning the hiding place, and they were
now moving forward again, carefully examining everything on each
side of the stream where it seemed possible for a cat, even, to
conceal itself. Lone Wolf would have given his right arm, almost,
rather than have his prisoner elude him. He had been completely
deceived by that little artifice of lameness, and it was not until
a full half hour after Ned's disappearance that he began to suspect
that something was amiss. The trail was taken up at once and followed
without trouble to where it entered the water. Here the real task
began, for the hardness of the bed of the creek prevented them
from tracing the footsteps where the clearness of the current
would have enabled them to do so, had the circumstances been otherwise.</p>

<p>Consequently, the only thing possible for them to do was to find
the place where he had taken to the land again. For this they
hunted until dark and renewed the work again in the morning. But
as Ned had not yet placed his foot upon dry land, the enterprise
up to that moment was not a success.</p>
