<p><em>AFTER </em>ringing up Sir James, Tommy’s next procedure was
to make a call at South Audley Mansions. He found Albert discharging
his professional duties, and introduced himself without more ado
as a friend of Tuppence’s. Albert unbent immediately.</p>

<p>"Things has been very quiet here lately," he said wistfully.
"Hope the young lady’s keeping well, sir?"</p>

<p>"That’s just the point, Albert. She’s disappeared."</p>

<p>"You don’t mean as the crooks have got her?"</p>

<p>"They have."</p>

<p>"In the Underworld?"</p>

<p>"No, dash it all, in this world!"</p>

<p>"It’s a h’expression, sir," explained Albert. "At the pictures
the crooks always have a restoorant in the Underworld. But do
you think as they’ve done her in, sir?"</p>

<p>"I hope not. By the way, have you by any chance an aunt, a cousin,
a grandmother, or any other suitable female relation who might
be represented as being likely to kick the bucket?"</p>

<p>A delighted grin spread slowly over Albert’s countenance.</p>

<p>"I’m on, sir. My poor aunt what lives in the country has been
mortal bad for a long time, and she’s asking for me with her dying
breath."</p>

<p>Tommy nodded approval.</p>

<p>"Can you report this in the proper quarter and meet me at Charing
Cross in an hour’s time?"</p>

<p>"I’ll be there, sir. You can count on me."</p>

<p>As Tommy had judged, the faithful Albert proved an invaluable
ally. The two took up their quarters at the inn in Gatehouse.
To Albert fell the task of collecting information. There was no
difficulty about it.</p>

<p>Astley Priors was the property of a Dr. Adams. The doctor no
longer practiced, had retired, the landlord believed, but he took
a few private patients&mdash;here the good fellow tapped his forehead
knowingly&mdash;"balmy ones! You understand!" The doctor was a popular
figure in the village, subscribed freely to all the local sports&mdash;"a
very pleasant, affable gentleman." Been there long? Oh, a matter
of ten years or so&mdash;might be longer. Scientific gentleman, he
was. Professors and people often came down from town to see him.
Anyway, it was a gay house, always visitors.</p>

<p>In the face of all this volubility, Tommy felt doubts. Was it
possible that this genial, well-known figure could be in reality
a dangerous criminal? His life seemed so open and aboveboard.
No hint of sinister doings. Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake?
Tommy felt a cold chill at the thought.</p>

<p>Then he remembered the private patients&mdash;"balmy ones." He inquired
carefully if there was a young lady amongst them, describing Tuppence.
But nothing much seemed to be known about the patients&mdash;they were
seldom seen outside the grounds. A guarded description of Annette
also failed to provoke recognition.</p>

<p>Astley Priors was a pleasant red-brick edifice, surrounded by
well-wooded grounds which effectually shielded the house from
observation from the road.</p>

<p>On the first evening Tommy, accompanied by Albert, explored the
grounds. Owing to Albert’s insistence they dragged themselves
along painfully on their stomachs, thereby producing a great deal
more noise than if they had stood upright. In any case, these
precautions were totally unnecessary. The grounds, like those
of any other private house after nightfall, seemed untenanted.
Tommy had imagined a possible fierce watchdog. Albert’s fancy
ran to a puma, or a tame cobra. But they reached a shrubbery near
the house quite unmolested.</p>

<p>The blinds of the dining-room window were up. There was a large
company assembled round the table. The port was passing from hand
to hand. It seemed a normal, pleasant company. Through the open
window scraps of conversation floated out disjointedly on the
night air. It was a heated discussion on county cricket!</p>

<p>Again Tommy felt that cold chill of uncertainty. It seemed impossible
to believe that these people were other than they seemed. Had
he been fooled once more? The fair-bearded, spectacled gentleman
who sat at the head of the table looked singularly honest and
normal.</p>

<p>Tommy slept badly that night. The following morning the indefatigable
Albert, having cemented an alliance with the greengrocer’s boy,
took the latter’s place and ingratiated himself with the cook
at Malthouse. He returned with the information that she was undoubtedly
"one of the crooks," but Tommy mistrusted the vividness of his
imagination. Questioned, he could adduce nothing in support of
his statement except his own opinion that she wasn’t the usual
kind. You could see that at a glance.</p>

<p>The substitution being repeated (much to the pecuniary advantage
of the real greengrocer’s boy) on the following day, Albert brought
back the first piece of hopeful news. There <em>was</em> a French
young lady staying in the house. Tommy put his doubts aside. Here
was confirmation of his theory. But time pressed. To-day was the
27th. The 29th was the much-talked-of "Labour Day," about which
all sorts of rumours were running riot. Newspapers were getting
agitated. Sensational hints of a Labour <em>coup d’état</em> were
freely reported. The Government said nothing. It knew and was
prepared. There were rumours of dissension among the Labour leaders.
They were not of one mind. The more far-seeing among them realized
that what they proposed might well be a death-blow to the England
that at heart they loved. They shrank from the starvation and
misery a general strike would entail, and were willing to meet
the Government half-way. But behind them were subtle, insistent
forces at work, urging the memories of old wrongs, deprecating
the weakness of half-and-half measures, fomenting misunderstandings.</p>

<p>Tommy felt that, thanks to Mr. Carter, he understood the position
fairly accurately. With the fatal document in the hands of Mr.
Brown, public opinion would swing to the side of the Labour extremists
and revolutionists. Failing that, the battle was an even chance.
The Government with a loyal army and police force behind them
might win&mdash;but at a cost of great suffering. But Tommy nourished
another and a preposterous dream. With Mr. Brown unmasked and
captured he believed, rightly or wrongly, that the whole organization
would crumble ignominiously and instantaneously. The strange permeating
influence of the unseen chief held it together. Without him, Tommy
believed an instant panic would set in; and, the honest men left
to themselves, an eleventh-hour reconciliation would be possible.</p>

<p>"This is a one-man show," said Tommy to himself. "The thing to
do is to get hold of the man."</p>

<p>It was partly in furtherance of this ambitious design that he
had requested Mr. Carter not to open the sealed envelope. The
draft treaty was Tommy’s bait. Every now and then he was aghast
at his own presumption. How dared he think that he had discovered
what so many wiser and clever men had overlooked? Nevertheless,
he stuck tenaciously to his idea.</p>

<p>That evening he and Albert once more penetrated the grounds of
Astley Priors. Tommy’s ambition was somehow or other to gain admission
to the house itself. As they approached cautiously, Tommy gave
a sudden gasp.</p>

<p>On the second floor window some one standing between the window
and the light in the room threw a silhouette on the blind. It
was one Tommy would have recognized anywhere! Tuppence was in
that house!</p>

<p>He clutched Albert by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Stay here! When I begin to sing, watch that window."</p>

<p>He retreated hastily to a position on the main drive, and began
in a deep roar, coupled with an unsteady gait, the following ditty:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
I am a Soldier<br/>
A jolly British Soldier;<br/>
You can see that I’m a Soldier by my feet....

</p>
</div>
<p>It had been a favourite on the gramophone in Tuppence’s hospital
days. He did not doubt but that she would recognize it and draw
her own conclusions. Tommy had not a note of music in his voice,
but his lungs were excellent. The noise he produced was terrific.</p>

<p>Presently an unimpeachable butler, accompanied by an equally
unimpeachable footman, issued from the front door. The butler
remonstrated with him. Tommy continued to sing, addressing the
butler affectionately as "dear old whiskers." The footman took
him by one arm, the butler by the other. They ran him down the
drive, and neatly out of the gate. The butler threatened him with
the police if he intruded again. It was beautifully done&mdash;soberly
and with perfect decorum. Anyone would have sworn that the butler
was a real butler, the footman a real footman&mdash;only, as it happened,
the butler was Whittington!</p>

<p>Tommy retired to the inn and waited for Albert’s return. At last
that worthy made his appearance.</p>

<p>"Well?" cried Tommy eagerly.</p>

<p>"It’s all right. While they was a-running of you out the window
opened, and something was chucked out." He handed a scrap of paper
to Tommy. "It was wrapped round a letterweight."</p>

<p>On the paper were scrawled three words: "To-morrow&mdash;same time."</p>

<p>"Good egg!" cried Tommy. "We’re getting going."</p>

<p>"I wrote a message on a piece of paper, wrapped it round a stone,
and chucked it through the window," continued Albert breathlessly.</p>

<p>Tommy groaned.</p>

<p>"Your zeal will be the undoing of us, Albert. What did you say?"</p>

<p>"Said we was a-staying at the inn. If she could get away, to
come there and croak like a frog."</p>

<p>"She’ll know that’s you," said Tommy with a sigh of relief. "Your
imagination runs away with you, you know, Albert. Why, you wouldn’t
recognize a frog croaking if you heard it."</p>

<p>Albert looked rather crest-fallen.</p>

<p>"Cheer up," said Tommy. "No harm done. That butler’s an old friend
of mine &mdash;I bet he knew who I was, though he didn’t let on.
It’s not their game to show suspicion. That’s why we’ve found
it fairly plain sailing. They don’t want to discourage me altogether.
On the other hand, they don’t want to make it too easy. I’m a
pawn in their game, Albert, that’s what I am. You see, if the
spider lets the fly walk out too easily, the fly might suspect
it was a put-up job. Hence the usefulness of that promising youth,
Mr. T. Beresford, who’s blundered in just at the right moment
for them. But later, Mr. T. Beresford had better look out!"</p>

<p>Tommy retired for the night in a state of some elation. He had
elaborated a careful plan for the following evening. He felt sure
that the inhabitants of Astley Priors would not interfere with
him up to a certain point. It was after that that Tommy proposed
to give them a surprise.</p>

<p>About twelve o’clock, however, his calm was rudely shaken. He
was told that some one was demanding him in the bar. The applicant
proved to be a rude-looking carter well coated with mud.</p>

<p>"Well, my good fellow, what is it?" asked Tommy.</p>

<p>"Might this be for you, sir?" The carter held out a very dirty
folded note, on the outside of which was written: "Take this to
the gentleman at the inn near Astley Priors. He will give you
ten shillings."</p>

<p>The handwriting was Tuppence’s. Tommy appreciated her quick-wittedness
in realizing that he might be staying at the inn under an assumed
name. He snatched at it.</p>

<p>"That’s all right."</p>

<p>The man withheld it.</p>

<p>"What about my ten shillings?"</p>

<p>Tommy hastily produced a ten-shilling note, and the man relinquished
his find. Tommy unfastened it.</p>

<p>"<em>DEAR TOMMY</em>,</p>

<p>"I knew it was you last night. Don’t go this evening. They’ll
be lying in wait for you. They’re taking us away this morning.
I heard something about Wales &mdash;Holyhead, I think. I’ll drop
this on the road if I get a chance. Annette told me how you’d
escaped. Buck up.</p>

<p>"Yours,</p>

<p>"<em>TWOPENCE</em>."</p>

<p>Tommy raised a shout for Albert before he had even finished perusing
this characteristic epistle.</p>

<p>"Pack my bag! We’re off!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." The boots of Albert could be heard racing upstairs.
Holyhead? Did that mean that, after all&#11834; Tommy was puzzled.
He read on slowly.</p>

<p>The boots of Albert continued to be active on the floor above.</p>

<p>Suddenly a second shout came from below.</p>

<p>"Albert! I’m a damned fool! Unpack that bag!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Tommy smoothed out the note thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, a damned fool," he said softly. "But so’s some one else!
And at last I know who it is!"</p>
