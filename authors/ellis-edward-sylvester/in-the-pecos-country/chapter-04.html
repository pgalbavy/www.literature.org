<p>Fred's few weeks spent in crossing the plains on his way to the
valley of the Rio Pecos had taught him much of the ways of the
Indians, and he knew that if any of the scamps were in his immediate
neighborhood, it would be almost impossible for him to stir from
his position by the tree without betraying himself. The lad half
suspected that the sound was made by some wild animal that was
stealing through the wood, or what was more likely, that it was
no more than a falling leaf; but, whatever it was, he was determined
to learn if the thing were among the possibilities.</p>

<p>A veteran Comanche, himself, could not have picked his way through
the undergrowth any better than did he; and, when at last he stood
upon the edge of the open space and looked around, he was morally
certain that no other creature was aware of his movement. Nor
was he aware of the action of the other party, if there was really
such a one, which had been the means of bringing him thither.
If some wild animal or wild Indian were lurking in the vicinity,
he knew how to remain invisible.</p>

<p>"I'll stay here a little while&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fred at that moment was looking at the cottonwood tree, which,
it will be remembered, had been felled directly across the opening,
when, to his speechless terror, the figure of an Indian warrior
suddenly rose upright from behind it, and stood as motionless
as a statue. His action indicated that he was not aware that any
one was standing so near him. He had probably crept up to the
log behind which he crouched, until, believing he was not in danger
of being seen, he arose to his feet and assumed the attitude of
one who was using his eyes and ears to their utmost extent.</p>

<p>He was of ordinary stature, without any blanket, his long, black
hair hanging loosely down upon his shoulders, his scarred and
ugly countenance daubed and smeared with different colored paint,
his chest bare, and ornamented in the same fashion, a knife at
his girdle, and a long, formidable rifle in his hand&mdash;such were
the noticeable characteristics, to a superficial observer, of
Lone Wolf, the Apache chief&mdash;for the Indian confronting Fred Munson
was really he, and no one else.</p>

<p>The lad suspected the identity of the red-skin, although, having
never seen him, it amounted only to a suspicion. No matter who
he was, however, he was prepared for him.</p>

<p>The Apache showed his usual cunning. He was evidently attempting
to steal upon the sentinels, and, having risen to his feet, he
remained motionless and upright, listening for any sign that might
betray any motion of the individuals whom he was seeking to slay,
as does the assassin at night.</p>

<p>"He must have been after <em>me</em>, for he is right behind
where I stood,"  thought the boy, as he grasped his rifle more
firmly than ever, resolved to fire upon the wretch the moment
he attempted to advance.</p>

<p>Lone Wolf stood but a minute in the position described, when,
seemingly, he was satisfied that the way was clear, and, throwing
one moccasin on the trunk, he climbed over as silently as a shadow,
and stood again holt upright upon the other side. This brought
the Indian and boy within ten feet of each other, and still the
advantage was all upon the side of the latter, who stood in such
deep shadow that he was not only invisible, but his presence was
unsuspected.</p>

<p>The Indian was not gazing in the direction of the lad, but seemed
to turn his attention more to the left, toward the spot where
Mickey O'Rooney, the Irishman, was stationed. In ignoring the
proximity of a boy, it cannot be said that he acted unreasonably.</p>

<p>Lone Wolf remained like a carven statue for a few seconds longer,
and then began a cautious movement forward. In the moonlight,
Fred could observe the motion of the foot, and the gradual advance
of the body. He felt that it would not do to defer any longer
his intention of obstructing him. If permitted to go on in this
manner, he might kill Mickey O'Rooney, and bring down a whole
host of red-skins upon the sleeping settlers, cutting them off
to a man.</p>

<p>Fred had his rifle to his shoulder, and pointed toward the Indian.
Suddenly stepping forward, he placed himself in the moonlight,
and, with the muzzle of his piece almost at the breast of the
chief, he said:</p>

<p>"Another step forward, and I'll bore you through!"</p>

<p>The lad did not stop to consider whether it was likely that the
Indian understood the English tongue; but, as it happened, Lone
Wolf could use it almost as if to the manner born; and it would
have required no profound linguistic knowledge upon the part of
anyone to have comprehended the meaning of the young hero. It
was one of those situations in which gesture told the meaning
more plainly than mere words could have done. But if ever there
was an astonished aborigine, Lone Wolf was the same.</p>

<p>It was not often that such a wily warrior as he was caught napping,
but he was completely outwitted on the present occasion. When
he saw the muzzle of the rifle pointed straight at his breast,
he knew what it meant, even though the weapon was in the hands
of a boy. It meant that any attempt on his part to raise his gun
or draw his tomahawk or knife, would be met by the discharge of
the threatening weapon, and his own passage from time into eternity.
So he stared at the lad a moment, and then demanded in good English:</p>

<p>"What does my brother want?"</p>

<p>"I want you to leave, just as quickly as you know how, and never
show yourself here again."</p>

<p>"Lone Wolf's wigwam is many miles away," supplied the Indian,
pointing northward, "and he is on his way there now."</p>

<p>Fred started a little at this terrible chieftain's name; but
he held his gun pointed steadily towards him, determined to fire
the instant he attempted the least hostile movement, for his own
salvation depended upon such a prompt check-mating of his enemy.</p>

<p>An Indian is always ready to make the best of his situation,
and Lone Wolf saw that he was fairly caught. Still, he acted cautiously,
in the hope of throwing the young hero off his guard, so as to
permit him to crush him as suddenly as if by a panther's spring.</p>

<p>"If your wigwam is there, it is time you were home," said Fred.
"We are on the lookout for such customers as you, and if any of
the others see you they won't let you off so easy as I do. So
the best thing is for you to leave."</p>

<p>Lone Wolf made no direct reply to this, except to take a step
toward the side of the lad, as if it were involuntary, and intended
to further the convenience of conversation; but Fred suspected
his purpose, and warned him back.</p>

<p>"Lone Wolf, if you want to carry your life away with you, you
will go at once. I do n't want to shoot you, but if you come any
nearer or wait any longer, I'll fire. I'm tired of holding this
gun, and it may go off itself."</p>

<p>The Apache chief made no answer, but, with his eyes fixed upon
the lad, took a step backward, as an earnest of his intention
of obeying. Reaching the log, he hastily clambered over it and
speedily vanished like a phantom in the gloom of the wood beyond,
leaving the boy master of the field.</p>
