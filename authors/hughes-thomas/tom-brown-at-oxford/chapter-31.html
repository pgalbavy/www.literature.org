<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Brown had a long way to drive home that evening,
including some eight miles of very indifferent chalky road over
the downs, which separate the Vale of Kennet from the Vale of
White Horse. Mr. Brown was an early man, and careful of his horses,
who responded to his care by being always well up to much more
work than they were ever put to. The drive to Barton Manor and
back in a day was a rare event in their lives. Their master, taking
this fact into consideration, was bent on giving them plenty of
time for the return journey, and had ordered his groom to be ready
to start by eight o'clock. But, that they might not disturb the
rest, by their early departure, he had sent the carriage to the
village inn, instead of to the Porter's stables.</p>

<p>At the appointed time, therefore, and when the evening's amusements
were just beginning at the manor house, Mr. Brown sought out his
wife; and, after a few words of leave-taking to their host and
hostess, the two slipped quietly away; and walked down the village.
The carriage was standing before the inn all ready for them, with
the hostler and Mr. Brown's groom at the horses' heads. The carriage
was a high phaeton having a roomy front seat with a hood to it,
specially devised by Mr. Brown with a view to his wife's comfort,
and that he might with a good conscience enjoy at the same time
the pleasures of her society and of driving his own horses. When
once in her place, Mrs. Brown was as comfortable as she would
have been in the most luxurious barouche with C springs, but the
ascent was certainly rather a drawback. The pleasure of sitting
by her husband and of receiving his assiduous help in the preliminary
climb, however, more than compensated to Mrs. Brown for this little
inconvenience.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown helped her up as usual, and arranged a plaid carefully
over her knees, the weather being too hot for the apron. He then
proceeded to walk round the horses, patting them, examining the
bits, and making inquiries as to how they had fed. Having satisfied
himself on these points, and fee'd the hostler, he took the reins,
seated himself by his wife, and started at a steady pace towards
the hills at the back of Barton village.</p>

<p>For a minute or two neither of them spoke, Mr. Brown being engrossed
with his horses and she with her thoughts. Presently, however,
he turned to her, and, having ascertained that she was quite comfortable,
went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, what do you think of them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I think they are agreeable people," answered Mrs. Brown;
"but one can scarcely judge from seeing them to-day. It is too
far for a drive; we shall not be home till midnight."</p>

<p>"But I am very glad we came. After all, they are connexions through
poor Robert, and he seems anxious that they should start well
in the county. Why, he has actually written twice, you know, about
our coming up to-day. We must try to show them some civility."</p>

<p>"It is impossible to come so far often," Mrs. Brown persisted.</p>

<p>"It is too far for ordinary visiting. What do you say to asking
them to come and spend a day or two with us?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear, if you wish it," answered Mrs. Brown, but
without much cordiality in her voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, I should like it; and it will please Robert so much. We
might have him and Katie over to meet them, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Mrs. Brown, with much more alacrity, "Mr.
and Mrs. Porter will have the best bed-room and dressing-room;
Robert must have the south room, and Katie the chintz. Yes, that
will do; I can manage it very well."</p>

<p>"And their daughter; you have forgotten her."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, dear, there is no more room."</p>

<p>"Why; there is the dressing-room, next to the south room, with
a bed in it. I'm sure nobody can want a better room."</p>

<p>"You know, John, that Robert cannot sleep if there is the least
noise. I could never put any-one into his dressing-room; there
is only a single door between the rooms, and even if they made
no noise, the fancy that some one was sleeping there would keep
him awake all night."</p>

<p>"Plague take his fancies! Robert has given way to them till he
is fit for nothing. But you can put him in the chintz room, and
give the two girls the south bed room and dressing-room."</p>

<p>"What, put Robert in a room which looks north? My dear John;
what can you be thinking about?"</p>

<p>Mr. Brown uttered an impatient grunt, and, as a vent to his feelings
more decorous on the whole than abusing his brother-in-law, drew
his whip more smartly than usual across the backs of his horses.
The exertion of muscle necessary to reduce those astonished animals
to their accustomed steady trot restored his temper, and he returned
to the charge&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose we must manage it on the second floor, then, unless
you could get a bed run up in the school-room."</p>

<p>"No, dear; I really should not like to do that&mdash;it would be so
very inconvenient. We are always wanting the room for workwomen
or servants; besides, I keep my account books and other things
there."</p>

<p>"Then I'm afraid it must be on the second floor. Some of the
children must be moved. The girl seems a nice girl with no nonsense
about her, and won't mind sleeping up there. Or, why not put Katie
upstairs?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I should not think of it. Katie is a dear good girl,
and I will not put anyone over her head."</p>

<p>"Nor I, dear. On the contrary, I was asking you to put her over
another person's head," said Mr. Brown, laughing at his own joke,
This unusual reluctance on the part of his wife to assist in carrying
out any hospitable plans of his began to strike him; so, not being
an adept at concealing his thoughts, or gaining his point by any
attack except a direct one, after driving on for a minute in silence,
he turned suddenly on his wife, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, Lizzie, you seem not to want to ask the girl?"</p>

<p>"Well, John, I do not see the need of it at all."</p>

<p>"No, and you don't want to ask her?"</p>

<p>"If you must know, then, I do not."</p>

<p>"Don't you like her?"</p>

<p>"I do not know her well enough either to like or dislike."</p>

<p>"Then, why not ask her, and see what she is like? But the truth
is, Lizzie, you have taken a prejudice against her?"</p>

<p>"Well, John, I think she is a thoughtless girl, and extravagant;
not the sort of girl, in fact, that I should wish to be much with
us."</p>

<p>"Thoughtless and extravagant!" said Mr. Brown, looking grave;
"how you women can be so sharp on one another! Her dress seemed
to me simple and pretty, and her manners very lady-like and pleasing."</p>

<p>"You seem to have quite forgotten about Tom's hat," said Mrs.
Brown.</p>

<p>"Tom's white hat&mdash;so I had," said Mr. Brown, and he relapsed
into a low laugh at the remembrance of the scene. "I call that
<em>his</em> extravagance, and not hers."</p>

<p>"It was a new hat, and a very expensive one, which he had bought
for the vacation, and it is quite spoilt."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear; really, if Tom will let girls shoot at his hats,
he must take the consequences. He must wear it with the holes,
or buy another."</p>

<p>"How can he afford another, John? you know how poor he is."</p>

<p>Mr. Brown drove on now for several minutes without speaking.
He knew perfectly well what his wife was coming to now, and, after
weighing in his mind the alternatives of accepting battle or making
sail and changing the subject altogether, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You know, my dear, he has brought it on himself. A headlong,
generous sort of youngster, like Tom, must be taught early that
he can't have his cake and eat his cake. If he likes to lend his
money, he must find out that he hasn't it to spend."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I quite agree with you. But 50L a year is a great
deal to make him pay."</p>

<p>"Not a bit too much, Lizzie. His allowance is quite enough without
it to keep him like a gentleman. Besides, after all, he gets it
in meal or in malt; I have just paid 25L for his gun."</p>

<p>"I know how kind and liberal you are to him; only I am so afraid
of his getting into debt."</p>

<p>"I wonder what men would do, if they hadn't some soft-hearted
woman always ready to take their parts and pull them out of scrapes,"
said Mr. Brown. "Well, dear, how much do you want to give the
boy!"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five pounds, just for this year. But out of my own allowance,
John."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" replied Mr. Brown; "you want your allowance for yourself
and the children."</p>

<p>"Indeed, dear John, I would sooner not do it at all, then, if
I may not do it out of my own money."</p>

<p>"Well, have it your own way. I believe you would always look
well-dressed, if you never bought another gown. Then, to go back
to what we were talking about just now&mdash;you will find a room for
the girl somehow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, certainly, as I see you are bent on it."</p>

<p>"I think it would be scarcely civil not to ask her, especially
if Katie comes. And I own I think her very pretty, and have taken
a great fancy to her."</p>

<p>"Isn't it odd that Tom should never have said anything about
her to us? He has talked of all the rest till I knew them quite
well before I went there."</p>

<p>"No; it seems to me the most natural thing in the world."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, very natural. But I can't help wishing he had talked
about her more; I should think it less dangerous."</p>

<p>"Oh, you think Master Tom is in love with her, eh?" said Mr.
Brown, laughing.</p>

<p>"More unlikely things have happened. You take it very easily,
John."</p>

<p>"Well, we have all been boys and girls, Lizzie. The world hasn't
altered much, I suppose, since I used to get up at five on winter
mornings, to ride some twenty miles to cover, on the chance of
meeting a young lady on a grey pony. I remember how my poor dear
old father used to wonder at it, when our hounds met close by
in a better country. I'm afraid I forgot to tell him what a pretty
creature 'Gipsy' was, and how well she was ridden."</p>

<p>"But Tom is only twenty, and he must go into a profession."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; much to young, I know&mdash;too young for anything serious.
We had better see them together and then if there is anything
in it, we can keep them apart. There cannot be much the matter
yet."</p>

<p>"Well, dear, if you are satisfied, I am sure I am."</p>

<p>And so the conversation turned on other subjects, and Mr. and
Mrs. Brown enjoyed their moonlight drive home through the delicious
summer night, and were quite sorry when the groom got down from
the hind-seat to open their own gates, at half-past twelve.</p>

<p>About the same time the festivities at Barton Manor were coming
to a close. There had been cold dinner in the tent at six, after
the great match of the day; and, after dinner, the announcement
of the scores, and the distribution of prizes to the winners.
A certain amount of toasts and speechifying followed, which the
ladies sat through with the most exemplary appearance of being
amused. When their healths had been proposed and acknowledged
they retired, and were soon followed by the younger portion of
the male sex; and, while the J. P.'s and clergymen sat quietly
at their wine, which Mr. Porter took care should be remarkably
good, and their wives went to look over the house and have tea,
their sons and daughters split up into groups, and some shot handicaps,
and some walked about and flirted, and some played at bowls and
lawn billiards. And soon the band appeared again from the servants'
hall, mightily refreshed; and dancing began on the grass, and
in due time was transferred to the tent, when the grass got damp
with the night dew; and then to the hall of the house, when the
lighting of the tent began to fail. And then there came a supper,
extemporized out of the remains of the dinner; after which, papas
and mammas began to look at their watches, and remonstrate with
daughters, coming up with sparkling eyes and hair a little shaken
out of place, and pleading for "just one more dance."</p>

<p>"You have been going on ever since one o'clock," remonstrate
the parents; "And are ready to go on till one to-morrow," replied
the children. By degrees, however, the frequent sound of wheels
was heard, and the dancers got thinner and thinner, till, for
the last half hour, some half-dozen couples of young people danced
at interminable reel, while Mr. and Mrs. Porter, and a few of
the most good-natured matrons of the neighborhood looked on. Soon
after midnight the band struck; no amount of negus could get anything
more out of them but "God save the Queen," which they accordingly
played and departed; and then came the final cloaking and driving
off of the last guests. Tom and Mary saw the last of them into
their carriage at the hall-door, and lingered a moment in the
porch.</p>

<p>"What a lovely night!" said Mary. "How I hate going to bed!"</p>

<p>"It is a dreadful bore," answered Tom; "but here is the butler
waiting to shut up; we must go in."</p>

<p>"I wonder where papa and mama are."</p>

<p>"Oh, they are only seeing things put a little to rights. Let
us sit here till they come; they must pass by to get to their
rooms."</p>

<p>So the two sat down on some hall chairs.</p>

<p>"Oh dear! I wish it were all coming over again to-morrow," said
Tom, leaning back, and looking up at the ceiling. "By the way,
remember I owe you a pair of gloves; what color shall they be?"</p>

<p>"Any color you like. I can't bear to think of it. I felt so dreadfully
ashamed when they all came up, and your mother looked so grave;
I am sure she was very angry."</p>

<p>"Poor mother! she was thinking of my hat with three arrow-holes
in it."</p>

<p>"Well, I am very sorry, because I wanted them to like me."</p>

<p>"And so they will; I should like to know who can help it."</p>

<p>"Now, I won't have any of your nonsensical compliments. Do you
think they enjoyed the day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure they did. My father said he had never liked an
archery meeting so much."</p>

<p>"But they went away so early."</p>

<p>"They had a very long drive, you know. Let me see," he said,
feeling in his breast-pocket, "mother left me a note, and I have
never looked at it till now." He took a slip of paper out and
read it, and his face fell.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said Mary leaning forward.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing; only I must go to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"There, I was sure she was angry."</p>

<p>"No, no; it was written this morning before she came here. I
can tell by the paper."</p>

<p>"But she will not let you stay here a day, you see."</p>

<p>"I have been here a good deal, considering all things. I should
like never to go away."</p>

<p>"Perhaps papa might find a place for you, if you asked him. Which
should you like,&mdash;to be tutor to the boys or gamekeeper?"</p>

<p>"On the whole, I should prefer the tutorship at present; you
take so much interest in the boys."</p>

<p>"Yes, because they have no one to look after them now in the
holidays. But, when you come as tutor, I shall wash my hands of
them."</p>

<p>"Then I shall decline the situation."</p>

<p>"How are you going home to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I shall ride round by Englebourn. They wish me to go round and
see Katie and Uncle Robert. You talked about riding over there
yourself this morning."</p>

<p>"I should like it so much. But how can we manage it? I can't
ride back again by myself."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you stay and sleep there?"</p>

<p>"I will ask mamma. No, I'm afraid it can hardly be managed;"
and so saying, Mary leant back in her chair and began to pull
to pieces some flowers she held in her hand.</p>

<p>"Don't pull them to pieces; give them to me," said Tom. "I have
kept the rosebud you gave me at Oxford folded up in"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Which you took, you mean to say. No, I won't give you any of
them&mdash;or, let me see&mdash;yes, here is a sprig of lavender; you may
have that."</p>

<p>"Thank you. But, why lavender?"</p>

<p>"Lavender stands for sincerity. It will remind you of the lecture
you gave me."</p>

<p>"I wish you would forget that. But you know what flowers mean,
then? Do give me a lecture; you owe me one. What do those flowers
mean which you will not give me,&mdash;the piece of heather for instance?"</p>

<p>"Heather signifies constancy."</p>

<p>"And the carnations?"</p>

<p>"Jealousy."</p>

<p>"And the heliotrope?"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind the heliotrope."</p>

<p>"But it is such a favorite of mine. Do tell me what it means?"</p>

<p>"<em>Je vous aime</em>," said Mary with a laugh, and a slight
blush; "it is all nonsense. Oh, here's mamma at last," and she
jumped up and went to meet her mother, who came out of the drawing-room,
candle in hand.</p>

<p>"My dear Mary, I thought you were gone to bed," said Mrs. Porter,
looking from one to the other seriously.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not the least tired, and I couldn't go without wishing
you and papa good night, and thanking you for all the trouble
you have taken."</p>

<p>"Indeed we ought all to thank you," said Tom; "everybody said
it was the pleasantest party they had ever been at."</p>

<p>"I am very glad it went off so well," said Mrs. Porter, gravely;
"and now, Mary, you must go to bed."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I must leave you to-morrow morning," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes; Mrs. Brown said they expect you at home tomorrow."</p>

<p>"I am to ride round by Uncle Robert's; would you like one of
the boys to go with me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear mamma, could not Charley and I ride over to Englebourn?
I do so long to see Katie."</p>

<p>"No, dear; it is much too far for you. We will drive over in
a few days' time."</p>

<p>And so saying, Mrs. Porter wished Tom good night, and led off
her daughter.</p>

<p>Tom went slowly up stairs to his room, and, after packing his
portmanteau for the carrier to take in the morning, threw up his
window and leant out into the night, and watched the light clouds
swimming over the moon, and the silver mist folding the water-meadows
and willows in its soft cool mantle. His thoughts were such as
will occur to any reader who has passed the witching age of twenty;
and the scent of the heliotrope-bed in the flower-garden below,
seemed to rise very strongly on the night air.</p>
