WE MUST HAVE TRAVELED SEVERAL MILES THROUGH the dark
and dismal wood when we came suddenly upon a dense
village built high among the branches of the trees.
As we approached it my escort broke into wild shouting
which was immediately answered from within, and a moment
later a swarm of creatures of the same strange race
as those who had captured me poured out to meet us.
Again I was the center of a wildly chattering horde.
I was pulled this way and that.  Pinched, pounded,
and thumped until I was black and blue, yet I do not
think that their treatment was dictated by either cruelty
or malice--I was a curiosity, a freak, a new plaything,
and their childish minds required the added evidence of all
their senses to back up the testimony of their eyes.
<P>
Presently they dragged me within the village,
which consisted of several hundred rude shelters
of boughs and leaves supported upon the branches of the trees.
<P>
Between the huts, which sometimes formed crooked streets,
were dead branches and the trunks of small trees which connected
the huts upon one tree to those within adjoining trees;
the whole network of huts and pathways forming an almost
solid flooring a good fifty feet above the ground.
<P>
I wondered why these agile creatures required connecting
bridges between the trees, but later when I saw the motley
aggregation of half-savage beasts which they kept within
their village I realized the necessity for the pathways.
There were a number of the same vicious wolf-dogs
which we had left worrying the dyryth, and many goatlike
animals whose distended udders explained the reasons
for their presence.
<P>
My guard halted before one of the huts into which I was pushed;
then two of the creatures squatted down before the entrance--to
prevent my escape, doubtless.  Though where I should have
escaped to I certainly had not the remotest conception.
I had no more than entered the dark shadows of the interior
than there fell upon my ears the tones of a familiar voice,
in prayer.
<P>
"Perry!" I cried.  "Dear old Perry!  Thank the Lord you
are safe."
<P>
"David!  Can it be possible that you escaped?" And the old
man stumbled toward me and threw his arms about me.
<P>
He had seen me fall before the dyryth, and then he had been
seized by a number of the ape-creatures and borne through
the tree tops to their village.  His captors had been
as inquisitive as to his strange clothing as had mine,
with the same result.  As we looked at each other we
could not help but laugh.
<P>
"With a tail, David," remarked Perry, "you would make
a very handsome ape."
<P>
"Maybe we can borrow a couple," I rejoined.  "They seem
to be quite the thing this season.  I wonder what the
creatures intend doing with us, Perry.  They don't seem
really savage.  What do you suppose they can be?  You
were about to tell me where we are when that great hairy
frigate bore down upon us--have you really any idea at all?"
<P>
"Yes, David," he replied, "I know precisely where we are.
We have made a magnificent discovery, my boy!  We have
proved that the earth is hollow.  We have passed entirely
through its crust to the inner world."
<P>
"Perry, you are mad!"
<P>
"Not at all, David.  For two hundred and fifty miles our
prospector bore us through the crust beneath our outer world.
At that point it reached the center of gravity of the
five-hundred-mile-thick crust.  Up to that point we had been
descending--direction is, of course, merely relative.
Then at the moment that our seats revolved--the thing
that made you believe that we had turned about and were
speeding upward--we passed the center of gravity and,
though we did not alter the direction of our progress,
yet we were in reality moving upward--toward the surface
of the inner world.  Does not the strange fauna and flora
which we have seen convince you that you are not in the
world of your birth?  And the horizon--could it present
the strange aspects which we both noted unless we were
indeed standing upon the inside surface of a sphere?"
<P>
"But the sun, Perry!" I urged.  "How in the world can
the sun shine through five hundred miles of solid crust?"
<P>
"It is not the sun of the outer world that we see here.
It is another sun--an entirely different sun--that
casts its eternal noonday effulgence upon the face
of the inner world.  Look at it now, David--if you can
see it from the doorway of this hut--and you will see
that it is still in the exact center of the heavens.
We have been here for many hours--yet it is still noon.
<P>
"And withal it is very simple, David.  The earth was once
a nebulous mass.  It cooled, and as it cooled it shrank.
At length a thin crust of solid matter formed upon
its outer surface--a sort of shell; but within it was
partially molten matter and highly expanded gases.
As it continued to cool, what happened?  Centrifugal
force hurled the particles of the nebulous center toward
the crust as rapidly as they approached a solid state.
You have seen the same principle practically applied
in the modern cream separator.  Presently there was only
a small super-heated core of gaseous matter remaining
within a huge vacant interior left by the contraction
of the cooling gases.  The equal attraction of the solid
crust from all directions maintained this luminous core
in the exact center of the hollow globe.  What remains
of it is the sun you saw today--a relatively tiny thing
at the exact center of the earth.  Equally to every part
of this inner world it diffuses its perpetual noonday light
and torrid heat.
<P>
"This inner world must have cooled sufficiently to
support animal life long ages after life appeared upon
the outer crust, but that the same agencies were at work
here is evident from the similar forms of both animal
and vegetable creation which we have already seen.
Take the great beast which attacked us, for example.
Unquestionably a counterpart of the Megatherium of the
post-Pliocene period of the outer crust, whose fossilized
skeleton has been found in South America."
<P>
"But the grotesque inhabitants of this forest?" I urged.
"Surely they have no counterpart in the earth's history."
<P>
"Who can tell?" he rejoined.  "They may constitute the
link between ape and man, all traces of which have been
swallowed by the countless convulsions which have racked
the outer crust, or they may be merely the result of evolution
along slightly different lines--either is quite possible."
<P>
Further speculation was interrupted by the appearance
of several of our captors before the entrance of the hut.
Two of them entered and dragged us forth.  The perilous
pathways and the surrounding trees were filled with
the black ape-men, their females, and their young.
There was not an ornament, a weapon, or a garment among
the lot.
<P>
"Quite low in the scale of creation," commented Perry.
<P>
"Quite high enough to play the deuce with us, though,"
I replied.  "Now what do you suppose they intend doing
with us?"
<P>
We were not long in learning.  As on the occasion of our
trip to the village we were seized by a couple of the
powerful creatures and whirled away through the tree tops,
while about us and in our wake raced a chattering,
jabbering, grinning horde of sleek, black ape-things.
<P>
Twice my bearers missed their footing, and my heart ceased
beating as we plunged toward instant death among the tangled
deadwood beneath.  But on both occasions those lithe,
powerful tails reached out and found sustaining branches,
nor did either of the creatures loosen their grasp upon me.
In fact, it seemed that the incidents were of no greater
moment to them than would be the stubbing of one's toe
at a street crossing in the outer world--they but laughed
uproariously and sped on with me.
<P>
For some time they continued through the forest--how long
I could not guess for I was learning, what was later
borne very forcefully to my mind, that time ceases to be
a factor the moment means for measuring it cease to exist.
Our watches were gone, and we were living beneath a
stationary sun.  Already I was puzzled to compute the period
of time which had elapsed since we broke through the crust
of the inner world.  It might be hours, or it might be
days--who in the world could tell where it was always
noon!  By the sun, no time had elapsed--but my judgment
told me that we must have been several hours in this
strange world.
<P>
Presently the forest terminated, and we came out upon
a level plain.  A short distance before us rose a few low,
rocky hills.  Toward these our captors urged us, and after
a short time led us through a narrow pass into a tiny,
circular valley.  Here they got down to work, and we
were soon convinced that if we were not to die to make
a Roman holiday, we were to die for some other purpose.
The attitude of our captors altered immediately as they
entered the natural arena within the rocky hills.
Their laughter ceased.  Grim ferocity marked their bestial
faces--bared fangs menaced us.
<P>
We were placed in the center of the amphitheater--the
thousand creatures forming a great ring about us.
Then a wolf-dog was brought--hyaenadon Perry called it--and
turned loose with us inside the circle.  The thing's
body was as large as that of a full-grown mastiff,
its legs were short and powerful, and its jaws broad
and strong.  Dark, shaggy hair covered its back and sides,
while its breast and belly were quite white.  As it slunk
toward us it presented a most formidable aspect with its
upcurled lips baring its mighty fangs.
<P>
Perry was on his knees, praying.  I stooped and picked
up a small stone.  At my movement the beast veered off
a bit and commenced circling us.  Evidently it had been
a target for stones before.  The ape-things were dancing
up and down urging the brute on with savage cries,
until at last, seeing that I did not throw, he charged us.
<P>
At Andover, and later at Yale, I had pitched on winning
ball teams.  My speed and control must both have been
above the ordinary, for I made such a record during
my senior year at college that overtures were made
to me in behalf of one of the great major-league teams;
but in the tightest pitch that ever had confronted me
in the past I had never been in such need for control
as now.
<P>
As I wound up for the delivery, I held my nerves and muscles
under absolute command, though the grinning jaws were
hurtling toward me at terrific speed.  And then I let go,
with every ounce of my weight and muscle and science in back
of that throw.  The stone caught the hyaenodon full upon
the end of the nose, and sent him bowling over upon his back.
<P>
At the same instant a chorus of shrieks and howls arose
from the circle of spectators, so that for a moment
I thought that the upsetting of their champion was
the cause; but in this I soon saw that I was mistaken.
As I looked, the ape-things broke in all directions
toward the surrounding hills, and then I distinguished
the real cause of their perturbation.  Behind them,
streaming through the pass which leads into the valley,
came a swarm of hairy men--gorilla-like creatures armed
with spears and hatchets, and bearing long, oval shields.
Like demons they set upon the ape-things, and before
them the hyaenodon, which had now regained its senses
and its feet, fled howling with fright.  Past us swept
the pursued and the pursuers, nor did the hairy ones accord
us more than a passing glance until the arena had been
emptied of its former occupants.  Then they returned to us,
and one who seemed to have authority among them directed
that we be brought with them.
<P>
When we had passed out of the amphitheater onto the
great plain we saw a caravan of men and women--human
beings like ourselves--and for the first time hope
and relief filled my heart, until I could have cried
out in the exuberance of my happiness.  It is true
that they were a half-naked, wild-appearing aggregation;
but they at least were fashioned along the same lines
as ourselves--there was nothing grotesque or horrible about
them as about the other creatures in this strange,
weird world.
<P>
But as we came closer, our hearts sank once more, for we
discovered that the poor wretches were chained neck to neck
in a long line, and that the gorilla-men were their guards.
With little ceremony Perry and I were chained at the end
of the line, and without further ado the interrupted
march was resumed.
<P>
Up to this time the excitement had kept us both up;
but now the tiresome monotony of the long march
across the sun-baked plain brought on all the agonies
consequent to a long-denied sleep.  On and on we stumbled
beneath that hateful noonday sun.  If we fell we were
prodded with a sharp point.  Our companions in chains
did not stumble.  They strode along proudly erect.
Occasionally they would exchange words with one another
in a monosyllabic language.  They were a noble-appearing
race with well-formed heads and perfect physiques.
The men were heavily bearded, tall and muscular; the women,
smaller and more gracefully molded, with great masses
of raven hair caught into loose knots upon their heads.
The features of both sexes were well proportioned--there
was not a face among them that would have been called
even plain if judged by earthly standards.  They wore
no ornaments; but this I later learned was due to the
fact that their captors had stripped them of everything
of value.  As garmenture the women possessed a single
robe of some light-colored, spotted hide, rather similar
in appearance to a leopard's skin.  This they wore either
supported entirely about the waist by a leathern thong,
so that it hung partially below the knee on one side,
or possibly looped gracefully across one shoulder.
Their feet were shod with skin sandals.  The men wore
loin cloths of the hide of some shaggy beast, long ends
of which depended before and behind nearly to the ground.
In some instances these ends were finished with the
strong talons of the beast from which the hides had
been taken.
<P>
Our guards, whom I already have described as gorilla-like men,
were rather lighter in build than a gorilla, but even so
they were indeed mighty creatures.  Their arms and legs
were proportioned more in conformity with human standards,
but their entire bodies were covered with shaggy, brown hair,
and their faces were quite as brutal as those of the few stuffed
specimens of the gorilla which I had seen in the museums at home.
<P>
Their only redeeming feature lay in the development
of the head above and back of the ears.  In this
respect they were not one whit less human than we.
They were clothed in a sort of tunic of light cloth which
reached to the knees.  Beneath this they wore only a loin
cloth of the same material, while their feet were shod
with thick hide of some mammoth creature of this inner world.
<P>
Their arms and necks were encircled by many ornaments of
metal--silver predominating--and on their tunics were sewn
the heads of tiny reptiles in odd and rather artistic designs.
They talked among themselves as they marched along on
either side of us, but in a language which I perceived
differed from that employed by our fellow prisoners.
When they addressed the latter they used what appeared
to be a third language, and which I later learned is
a mongrel tongue rather analogous to the Pidgin-English
of the Chinese coolie.
<P>
How far we marched I have no conception, nor has Perry.
Both of us were asleep much of the time for hours before
a halt was called--then we dropped in our tracks.
I say "for hours," but how may one measure time where time
does not exist!  When our march commenced the sun stood
at zenith.  When we halted our shadows still pointed
toward nadir.  Whether an instant or an eternity of
earthly time elapsed who may say.  That march may have
occupied nine years and eleven months of the ten years
that I spent in the inner world, or it may have been
accomplished in the fraction of a second--I cannot tell.
But this I do know that since you have told me that ten
years have elapsed since I departed from this earth
I have lost all respect for time--I am commencing to
doubt that such a thing exists other than in the weak,
finite mind of man.
