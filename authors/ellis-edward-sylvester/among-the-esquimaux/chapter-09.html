<p>As may be supposed, Jack Cosgrove was all excitement on the instant.
He had not expected any such reply, and he was eager to learn
the cause. As he started forward, he instinctively glanced down
in quest of evidence that Fred had passed there. There was none
so far as he could see, and, if there had been, it is not likely
he would have been able to identify it, since all the party had
been over the same spot, and some of them more than once.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked, as he reached his friend.</p>

<p>"It may mean nothing, but a little distance beyond where we camped
the ice is broken and scratched as though some one has been that
way."</p>

<p>"So there has, we were there yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"I haven't forgotten that, but these marks are at a place where
we haven't been, that is unless it was Fred."</p>

<p>"How did you manage to find them in the dark?"</p>

<p>"I didn't; I groped over the ice as far as I could, and then
sat down and waited for day. I must have slept awhile, but when
it was growing light I happened to look around, and there, within
a few feet of me, on my right hand, I noticed the ice scratched
and broken, as though some one had found it hard work to get along.
I was about to start right after him, when I thought it best to
tarry for you. It is now so much lighter that we shall learn something
worth knowing."</p>

<p>Even in their excitement they paused a few minutes to gaze out
upon the ocean, as it was rapidly illumined by the rising sun.
Before long their vision extended for miles, but the looked-for
sight was not there. On every hand, as far as the eye could penetrate,
was nothing but the heaving expanse of icy water.</p>

<p>Whether they were within a comparatively short distance of Greenland
or not, they were not nigh enough to catch the first glimpse of
the coast.</p>

<p>Several miles to the eastward towered an iceberg, apparently
as large as the one upon which they were drifting. Its pinnacles,
domes, arches, plateaus, spires, and varied forms sparkled and
scintillated in the growing sunlight, displaying at times all
the colors of the spectrum, and making a picture beautiful beyond
description.</p>

<p>To the northward and well down in the horizon, was another berg,
smaller than the first, and too far off to attract interest. A
still smaller one was visible midway between the two, and a peculiar
appearance of the sea in the same direction, Jack said, was caused
by a great ice field.</p>

<p>Not a ship was to be seen anywhere. Their view to the southward
was excluded by the bulk of the iceberg, on which they were floating.</p>

<p>"There's nothing there for us," remarked Rob with a sigh.</p>

<p>"You're right; lead the way and let's see what you found."</p>

<p>It took them but a few minutes to reach the place the lad had
in mind, and they had no sooner done so than the sailor was certain
an important discovery had been made.</p>

<p>Where there was so much irregularity of shape as on an iceberg,
a clear description is impossible; but, doing the best we can,
it may be said that the spot was a hundred feet back from where
the three huddled together with an expectation of spending the
night until morning. It was only a little higher, and was attained
by carefully picking one's way over the jagged ice, which afforded
secure footing, now that day had come.</p>

<p>Adjoining the place, from which the party diverged to the left,
was a lift or shelf on the right, and distant only two or three
paces. It was no more than waist high, and, therefore, was readily
reached by any one who chose to clamber upon it.</p>

<p>It is no easy matter to trace one over the ice, but the signs
of which Rob had spoken were too plain to be mistaken. There were
scratches, such as would have been made by a pair of shoes, a
piece of the edge was broken off, and marks beyond were visible
similar to those which it would be supposed any one would make
in clambering over the flinty surface.</p>

<p>Jack stood a minute or two studying these signs as eagerly as
an American Indian might scrutinize the faint trail of an enemy
through the forest.</p>

<p>"By the great horned spoon!" he finally exclaimed; "but that
does look encouraging; I shouldn't wonder if the chap did make
his way along there in the night, but why he done it only he can
tell. Howsumever, where has he gone?"</p>

<p>That was the question which Rob Carrol had asked himself more
than once, and was unable to answer. The ice, for a distance of
another hundred feet, looked as if it might be scaled, but, just
beyond that, towered a perpendicular wall, like the side of a
glass mountain. There could be no progress any farther in that
direction, nor, so far as could be judged, could any one advance
by turning to the right or left.</p>

<p>There must be numerous depressions and cavities, sufficient to
hide a dozen men, and it was in one of these the couple believed
they would find the dead or senseless body of their friend.</p>

<p>"Jack," said Rob, "take my gun."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I'll push on ahead as fast as I can; I can't wait, and the weapon
will only hinder me."</p>

<p>"I've an idee of doing something of the kind myself, so we'll
leave 'em here. I don't think they'll wash away like the boat,"
he added, as he carefully placed them on the shelf, up which they
proceeded to climb.</p>

<p>But Rob was in advance and maintained his place, gaining all
the time upon his slower companion, who allowed him to draw away
from him without protest.</p>

<p>"There's no need of a chap tiring himself to death," concluded
Jack, as he fell back to a more moderate pace; "he's younger nor
me, and it won't hurt him to get a bump or so."</p>

<p>Rob was climbing with considerable skill. In his eagerness he
slipped several times, but managed to maintain his footing and
to advance with a steadiness which caused considerable admiration
on the part of his more sluggish companion.</p>

<p>He used his eyes for all they were worth, and the signs that
had roused his hope at first were still seen at intervals, and
cheered him with the growing belief that he was on the right track.</p>

<p>"But why don't we hear something of him?" he abruptly asked himself,
stopping short with shuddering dread in his heart; "he could not
have remained asleep all this time, and, if he has been hurt so
as to make him senseless, more than likely he is dead."</p>

<p>The youth was now nearing the ice wall, to which we have referred,
and beyond which it looked impossible to go. The furtive glances
into the depressions on his right and left showed nothing of his
loved friend, and the evidences of his progress were still in
front. The solution of the singular mystery must be at hand.</p>

<p>Unconsciously Rob slowed his footsteps, and looked and listened
with greater care than before.</p>

<p>"What can it mean? Where can he have gone? I see no way by which
he could have pushed farther, and yet he is not in sight&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, for he discovered his error. The path, if such it
may be termed, which he had been following, turned so sharply
to the right that it could not be seen until one was upon it.
How far it penetrated in that direction remained to be learned.</p>

<p>Rob turned about and looked at Jack, who was several rods to
the rear, making his way upward with as much deliberation as though
he felt no personal interest in the business.</p>

<p>"I'm going a little farther, Jack, but I think we're close upon
him now. Hurry after me!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," called the sailor, in return; "when you run afoul of
the lad give him my love and tell him I'm coming."</p>

<p>This remark proved that he shared the hope of Rob, who was now
acting the part of pioneer, and it did not a little to encourage
the boy to push on with the utmost vigor at his command.</p>

<p>The sailor was somewhat winded from his unusual exertions, and,
believing there was no immediate need of his help, sat down for
a few minutes to regain his breath.</p>

<p>"He'll yell the moment he catches sight of anything, and he can
do that so well that he don't need any help from me&mdash;by the great
horned spoon! what's the meaning of that?"</p>

<p>Rob Carrol, who had been out of sight but a few seconds, now
burst to view again, the picture of terror. He was plunging toward
the sailor with such desperate haste that he continually stumbled
and bruised himself. But he instantly scrambled up again, glancing
in mortal fright over his shoulder, and barely able to gasp as
he dashed toward the sailor:</p>

<p>"O Jack! we're lost! we're lost! Heaven help us!"</p>
