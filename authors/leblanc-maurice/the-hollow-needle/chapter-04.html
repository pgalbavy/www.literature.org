<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>One evening, five weeks later, I had given my man leave to go out. It
was the day before the 14th of July. The night was hot, a storm
threatened and I felt no inclination to leave the flat. I opened wide
the glass doors leading to my balcony, lit my reading lamp and sat down
in an easy-chair to look through the papers, which I had not yet seen.
</p><p>It goes without saying that there was something about Arsene Lupin in
all of them. Since the attempt at murder of which poor Isidore
Beautrelet had been the victim, not a day had passed without some
mention of the Ambrumesy mystery. It had a permanent headline devoted
to it. Never had public opinion been excited to that extent, thanks to
the extraordinary series of hurried events, of unexpected and
disconcerting surprises. M. Filleul, who was certainly accepting the
secondary part allotted to him with a good faith worthy of all praise,
had let the interviewers into the secret of his young advisor's
exploits during the memorable three days, so that the public was able
to indulge in the rashest suppositions. And the public gave itself free
scope. Specialists and experts in crime, novelists and playwrights,
retired magistrates and chief-detectives, erstwhile Lecocqs and budding
Holmlock Shearses, each had his theory and expounded it in lengthy
contributions to the press. Everybody corrected and supplemented the
inquiry of the examining magistrate; and all on the word of a child, on
the word of Isidore Beautrelet, a sixth-form schoolboy at the Lycee
Janson-de-Sailly!
</p><p>For really, it had to be admitted, the complete elements of the truth
were now in everybody's possession. What did the mystery consist of?
They knew the hiding-place where Arsene Lupin had taken refuge and lain
a-dying; there was no doubt about it: Dr. Delattre, who continued to
plead professional secrecy and refused to give evidence, nevertheless
confessed to his intimate friends--who lost no time in blabbing--that
he really had been taken to a crypt to attend a wounded man whom his
confederates introduced to him by the name of Arsene Lupin. And, as the
corpse of Etienne de Vaudreix was found in that same crypt and as the
said Etienne de Vaudreix was none other than Arsene Lupin--as the
official examination went to show--all this provided an additional
proof, if one were needed, of the identity of Arsene Lupin and the
wounded man. Therefore, with Lupin dead and Mlle. de Saint-Veran's body
recognized by the curb-bracelet on her wrist, the tragedy was finished.
</p><p>It was not. Nobody thought that it was, because Beautrelet had said the
contrary. Nobody knew in what respect it was not finished, but, on the
word of the young man, the mystery remained complete. The evidence of
the senses did not prevail against the statement of a Beautrelet. There
was something which people did not know, and of that something they
were convinced that he was in position to supply a triumphant
explanation.
</p><p>It is easy, therefore, to imagine the anxiety with which, at first,
people awaited the bulletins issued by the two Dieppe doctors to whose
care the Comte de Gesvres entrusted his patient; the distress that
prevailed during the first few days, when his life was thought to be in
danger; and the enthusiasm of the morning when the newspapers announced
that there was no further cause for fear. The least details excited the
crowd. People wept at the thought of Beautrelet nursed by his old
father, who had been hurriedly summoned by telegram, and they also
admired the devotion of Mlle. Suzanne de Gesvres, who spent night after
night by the wounded lad's bedside.
</p><p>Next came a swift and glad convalescence. At last, the public were
about to know! They would know what Beautrelet had promised to reveal
to M. Filleul and the decisive words which the knife of the would-be
assassin had prevented him from uttering! And they would also know
everything, outside the tragedy itself, that remained impenetrable or
inaccessible to the efforts of the police.
</p><p>With Beautrelet free and cured of his wound, one could hope for some
certainty regarding Harlington, Arsene Lupin's mysterious accomplice,
who was still detained at the Sante prison. One would learn what had
become, after the crime, of Bredoux the clerk, that other accomplice,
whose daring was really terrifying.
</p><p>With Beautrelet free, one could also form a precise idea concerning the
disappearance of Ganimard and the kidnapping of Shears. How was it
possible for two attempts of this kind to take place? Neither the
English detectives nor their French colleagues possessed the slightest
clue on the subject. On Whit-Sunday, Ganimard did not come home, nor on
the Monday either, nor during the five weeks that followed. In London,
on Whit-Monday, Holmlock Shears took a cab at eight o'clock in the
evening to drive to the station. He had hardly stepped in, when he
tried to alight, probably feeling a presentiment of danger. But two men
jumped into the hansom, one on either side, flung him back on the seat
and kept him there between them, or rather under them. All this
happened in sight of nine or ten witnesses, who had no time to
interfere. The cab drove off at a gallop. And, after that, nothing.
Nobody knew anything.
</p><p>Perhaps, also, Beautrelet would be able to give the complete
explanation of the document, the mysterious paper to which. Bredoux,
the magistrate's clerk, attached enough importance to recover it, with
blows of the knife, from the person in whose possession it was. The
problem of the Hollow Needle it was called, by the countless solvers of
riddles who, with their eyes bent upon the figures and dots, strove to
read a meaning into them. The Hollow Needle! What a bewildering
conjunction of two simple words! What an incomprehensible question was
set by that scrap of paper, whose very origin and manufacture were
unknown! The Hollow Needle! Was it a meaningless expression, the puzzle
of a schoolboy scribbling with pen and ink on the corner of a page? Or
were they two magic words which could compel the whole great adventure
of Lupin the great adventurer to assume its true significance? Nobody
knew.
</p><p>But the public soon would know. For some days, the papers had been
announcing the approaching arrival of Beautrelet. The struggle was on
the point of recommencing; and, this time, it would be implacable on
the part of the young man, who was burning to take his revenge. And, as
it happened, my attention, just then, was drawn to his name, printed in
capitals. The Grand Journal headed its front page with the following
paragraph:
</p><hr/>
<p><strong>WE HAVE PERSUADED</strong>
</p><p><strong>M. ISIDORE BEAUTRELET</strong>
</p><p><strong>TO GIVE US THE FIRST RIGHT OF PRINTING HIS REVELATIONS. TO-MORROW,</strong>
TUESDAY, BEFORE THE POLICE THEMSELVES ARE INFORMED, THE Grand Journal
<strong>WILL PUBLISH THE WHOLE TRUTH OF THE AMBRUMESY MYSTERY.</strong>
</p><hr/>
<p>"That's interesting, eh? What do you think of it, my dear chap?"
</p><p>I started from my chair. There was some one sitting beside me, some one
I did not know. I cast my eyes round for a weapon. But, as my visitor's
attitude appeared quite inoffensive, I restrained myself and went up to
him.
</p><p>He was a young man with strongly-marked features, long, fair hair and a
short, tawny beard, divided into two points. His dress suggested the
dark clothes of an English clergyman; and his whole person, for that
matter, wore an air of austerity and gravity that inspired respect.
</p><p>"Who are you?" I asked. And, as he did not reply, I repeated, "Who are
you? How did you get in? What are you here for?"
</p><p>He looked at me and said:
</p><p>"Don't you know me?"
</p><p>"No--no!"
</p><p>"Oh, that's really curious! Just search your memory--one of your
friends--a friend of a rather special kind--however--"
</p><p>I caught him smartly by the arm:
</p><p>"You lie! You lie! No, you're not the man you say you are--it's not
true."
</p><p>"Then why are you thinking of that man rather than another?" he asked,
with a laugh.
</p><p>Oh, that laugh! That bright and clear young laugh, whose amusing irony
had so often contributed to my diversion! I shivered. Could it be?
</p><p>"No, no," I protested, with a sort of terror. "It cannot be."
</p><p>"It can't be I, because I'm dead, eh?" he retorted. "And because you
don't believe in ghosts." He laughed again. "Am I the sort of man who
dies? Do you think I would die like that, shot in the back by a girl?
Really, you misjudge me! As though I would ever consent to such a death
as that!"
</p><p>"So it is you!" I stammered, still incredulous and yet greatly excited.
"So it is you! I can't manage to recognize you."
</p><p>"In that case," he said, gaily, "I am quite easy. If the only man to
whom I have shown myself in my real aspect fails to know me to-day,
then everybody who will see me henceforth as I am to-day is bound not
to know me either, when he sees me in my real aspect--if, indeed, I
have a real aspect--"
</p><p>I recognized his voice, now that he was no longer changing its tone,
and I recognized his eyes also and the expression of his face and his
whole attitude and his very being, through the counterfeit appearance
in which he had shrouded it:
</p><p>"Arsene Lupin!" I muttered.
</p><p>"Yes, Arsene Lupin!" he cried, rising from his chair. "The one and only
Arsene Lupin, returned from the realms of darkness, since it appears
that I expired and passed away in a crypt! Arsene Lupin, alive and
kicking, in the full exercise of his will, happy and free and more than
ever resolved to enjoy that happy freedom in a world where hitherto he
has received nothing but favors and privileges!"
</p><p>It was my turn to laugh:
</p><p>"Well, it's certainly you, and livelier this time than on the day when
I had the pleasure of seeing you, last year--I congratulate you."
</p><p>I was alluding to his last visit, the visit following on the famous
adventure of the diadem,[1] his interrupted marriage, his flight with
Sonia Kirchnoff and the Russian girl's horrible death. On that day, I
had seen an Arsene Lupin whom I did not know, weak, down-hearted, with
eyes tired with weeping, seeking for a little sympathy and affection.
</p>
<p>[1] Arsene Lupin, play in three acts and four scenes, by Maurice
Leblanc and Francis de Croisset.
</p>
<p>"Be quiet," he said. "The past is far away."
</p><p>"It was a year ago," I observed.
</p><p>"It was ten years ago," he declared. "Arsene Lupin's years count for
ten times as much as another man's."
</p><p>I did not insist and, changing the conversation:
</p><p>"How did you get in?"
</p><p>"Why, how do you think? Through the door, of course. Then, as I saw
nobody, I walked across the drawing room and out by the balcony, and
here I am."
</p><p>"Yes, but the key of the door--?"
</p><p>"There are no doors for me, as you know. I wanted your flat and I came
in."
</p><p>"It is at your disposal. Am I to leave you?"
</p><p>"Oh, not at all! You won't be in the way. In fact, I can promise you an
interesting evening."
</p><p>"Are you expecting some one?"
</p><p>"Yes. I have given him an appointment here at ten o'clock." He took out
his watch. "It is ten now. If the telegram reached him, he ought to be
here soon."
</p><p>The front-door bell rang.
</p><p>"What did I tell you? No, don't trouble to get up: I'll go."
</p><p>With whom on earth could he have made an appointment? And what sort of
scene was I about to assist at: dramatic or comic? For Lupin himself to
consider it worthy of interest, the situation must be somewhat
exceptional.
</p><p>He returned in a moment and stood back to make way for a young man,
tall and thin and very pale in the face.
</p><p>Without a word and with a certain solemnity about his movements that
made me feel ill at ease. Lupin switched on all the electric lamps, one
after the other, till the room was flooded with light. Then the two men
looked at each other, exchanged profound and penetrating glances, as
if, with all the effort of their gleaming eyes, they were trying to
pierce into each other's souls.
</p><p>It was an impressive sight to see them thus, grave and silent. But who
could the newcomer be?
</p><p>I was on the point of guessing the truth, through his resemblance to a
photograph which had recently appeared in the papers, when Lupin turned
to me:
</p><p>"My dear chap, let me introduce M. Isidore Beautrelet." And, addressing
the young man, he continued, "I have to thank you, M. Beautrelet,
first, for being good enough, on receipt of a letter from me, to
postpone your revelations until after this interview and, secondly, for
granting me this interview with so good a grace."
</p><p>Beautrelet smiled:
</p><p>"Allow me to remark that my good grace consists, above all, in obeying
your orders. The threat which you made to me in the letter in question
was the more peremptory in being aimed not at me, but at my father."
</p><p>"My word," said Lupin laughing, "we must do the best we can and make
use of the means of action vouchsafed to us. I knew by experience that
your own safety was indifferent to you, seeing that you resisted the
arguments of Master Bredoux. There remained your father--your father
for whom you have a great affection--I played on that string."
</p><p>"And here I am," said Beautrelet, approvingly.
</p><p>I motioned them to be seated. They consented and Lupin resumed, in that
tone of imperceptible banter which is all his own:
</p><p>"In any case, M. Beautrelet, if you will not accept my thanks, you will
at least not refuse my apologies."
</p><p>"Apologies! Bless my soul, what for?"
</p><p>"For the brutality which Master Bredoux showed you."
</p><p>"I confess that the act surprised me. It was not Lupin's usual way of
behaving. A stab--"
</p><p>"I assure you I had no hand in it. Bredoux is a new recruit. My
friends, during the time that they had the management of our affairs,
thought that it might be useful to win over to our cause the clerk of
the magistrate himself who was conducting the inquiry."
</p><p>"Your friends were right."
</p><p>"Bredoux, who was specially attached to your person, was, in fact, most
valuable to us. But, with the ardor peculiar to any neophyte who wishes
to distinguish himself, he pushed his zeal too far and thwarted my
plans by permitting himself, on his own initiative, to strike you a
blow."
</p><p>"Oh, it was a little accident!"
</p><p>"Not at all, not at all! And I have reprimanded him severely! I am
bound, however, to say in his favor that he was taken unawares by the
really unexpected rapidity of your investigation. If you had only left
us a few hours longer, you would have escaped that unpardonable
attempt."
</p><p>"And I should doubtless have enjoyed the enormous advantage of
undergoing the same fate as M. Ganimard and Mr. Holmlock Shears?"
</p><p>"Exactly," said Lupin, laughing heartily. "And I should not have known
the cruel terrors which your wound caused me. I have had an atrocious
time because of it, believe me, and, at this moment, your pallor fills
me with all the stings of remorse. Can you ever forgive me?"
</p><p>"The proof of confidence which you have shown me in delivering yourself
unconditionally into my hands--it would have been so easy for me to
bring a few of Ganimard's friends with me--that proof of confidence
wipes out everything."
</p><p>Was he speaking seriously? I confess frankly that I was greatly
perplexed. The struggle between the two men was beginning in a manner
which I was simply unable to understand. I had been present at the
first meeting between Lupin and Holmlock Shears, in the cafe near the
Gare Montparnesse,[2] and I could not help recalling the haughty
carriage of the two combatants, the terrific clash of their pride under
the politeness of their manners, the hard blows which they dealt each
other, their feints, their arrogance.
</p>
<p>[2] Arsene Lupin versus Holmlock Shears, by Maurice Leblanc.
</p>
<p>Here, it was quite different. Lupin, it is true, had not changed; he
exhibited the same tactics, the same crafty affability. But what a
strange adversary he had come upon! Was it even an adversary? Really,
he had neither the tone of one nor the appearance. Very calm, but with
a real calmness, not one assumed to cloak the passion of a man
endeavoring to restrain himself; very polite, but without exaggeration;
smiling, but without chaff, he presented the most perfect contrast to
Arsene Lupin, a contrast so perfect even that, to my mind, Lupin
appeared as much perplexed as myself.
</p><p>No, there was no doubt about it: in the presence of that frail
stripling, with cheeks smooth as a girl's and candid and charming eyes,
Lupin was losing his ordinary self-assurance. Several times over, I
observed traces of embarrassment in him. He hesitated, did not attack
frankly, wasted time in mawkish and affected phrases.
</p><p>It also looked as though he wanted something. He seemed to be seeking,
waiting. What for? Some aid?
</p><p>There was a fresh ring of the bell. He himself ran and opened the door.
He returned with a letter:
</p><p>"Will you allow me, gentlemen?" he asked.
</p><p>He opened the letter. It contained a telegram. He read it--and became
as though transformed. His face lit up, his figure righted itself and I
saw the veins on his forehead swell. It was the athlete who once more
stood before me, the ruler, sure of himself, master of events and
master of persons. He spread the telegram on the table and, striking it
with his fist, exclaimed:
</p><p>"Now, M. Beautrelet, it's you and I!"
</p><p>Beautrelet adopted a listening attitude and Lupin began, in measured,
but harsh and masterful tones:
</p><p>"Let us throw off the mask--what say you?--and have done with
hypocritical compliments. We are two enemies, who know exactly what to
think of each other; we act toward each other as enemies; and therefore
we ought to treat with each other as enemies."
</p><p>"To treat?" echoed Beautrelet, in a voice of surprise.
</p><p>"Yes, to treat. I did not use that word at random and I repeat it, in
spite of the effort, the great effort, which it costs me. This is the
first time I have employed it to an adversary. But also, I may as well
tell you at once, it is the last. Make the most of it. I shall not
leave this flat without a promise from you. If I do, it means war."
</p><p>Beautrelet seemed more and more surprised. He said very prettily:
</p><p>"I was not prepared for this--you speak so funnily! It's so different
from what I expected! Yes, I thought you were not a bit like that! Why
this display of anger? Why use threats? Are we enemies because
circumstances bring us into opposition? Enemies? Why?"
</p><p>Lupin appeared a little out of countenance, but he snarled and, leaning
over the boy:
</p><p>"Listen to me, youngster," he said. "It's not a question of picking
one's words. It's a question of a fact, a positive, indisputable fact;
and that fact is this: in all the past ten years, I have not yet
knocked up against an adversary of your capacity. With Ganimard and
Holmlock Shears I played as if they were children. With you, I am
obliged to defend myself, I will say more, to retreat. Yes, at this
moment, you and I well know that I must look upon myself as worsted in
the fight. Isidore Beautrelet has got the better of Arsene Lupin. My
plans are upset. What I tried to leave in the dark you have brought
into the full light of day. You annoy me, you stand in my way. Well,
I've had enough of it--Bredoux told you so to no purpose. I now tell
you so again; and I insist upon it, so that you may take it to heart:
I've had enough of it!"
</p><p>Beautrelet nodded his head:
</p><p>"Yes, but what do you want?"
</p><p>"Peace! Each of us minding his own business, keeping to his own side!"
</p><p>"That is to say, you free to continue your burglaries undisturbed, I
free to return to my studies."
</p><p>"Your studies--anything you please--I don't care. But you must leave me
in peace--I want peace."
</p><p>"How can I trouble it now?"
</p><p>Lupin seized his hand violently:
</p><p>"You know quite well! Don't pretend not to know. You are at this moment
in possession of a secret to which I attach the highest importance.
This secret you were free to guess, but you have no right to give it to
the public."
</p><p>"Are you sure that I know it?"
</p><p>"You know it, I am certain: day by day, hour by hour, I have followed
your train of thought and the progress of your investigations. At the
very moment when Bredoux struck you, you were about to tell all.
Subsequently, you delayed your revelations, out of solicitude for your
father. But they are now promised to this paper here. The article is
written. It will be set up in an hour. It will appear to-morrow."
</p><p>"Quite right."
</p><p>Lupin rose, and slashing the air with his hand,
</p><p>"It shall not appear!" he cried.
</p><p>"It shall appear!" said Beautrelet, starting up in his turn.
</p><p>At last, the two men were standing up to each other. I received the
impression of a shock, as if they had seized each other round the body.
Beautrelet seemed to burn with a sudden energy. It was as though a
spark had kindled within him a group of new emotions: pluck,
self-respect, the passion of fighting, the intoxication of danger. As
for Lupin, I read in the radiance of his glance the joy of the duellist
who at length encounters the sword of his hated rival.
</p><p>"Is the article in the printer's hands?"
</p><p>"Not yet."
</p><p>"Have you it there--on you?"
</p><p>"No fear! I shouldn't have it by now, in that case!"
</p><p>"Then--"
</p><p>"One of the assistant editors has it, in a sealed envelope. If I am not
at the office by midnight, he will have set it up."
</p><p>"Oh, the scoundrel!" muttered Lupin. "He has provided for everything!"
</p><p>His anger was increasing, visibly and frightfully. Beautrelet chuckled,
jeering in his turn, carried away by his success.
</p><p>"Stop that, you brat!" roared Lupin. "You're forgetting who I am--and
that, if I wished--upon my word, he's daring to laugh!"
</p><p>A great silence fell between them. Then Lupin stepped forward and, in
muttered tones, with his eyes on Beautrelet's:
</p><p>"You shall go straight to the Grand Journal."
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"Tear up your article."
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"See the editor."
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"Tell him you made a mistake."
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"And write him another article, in which you will give the official
version of the Ambrumesy mystery, the one which every one has accepted."
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>Lupin took up a steel ruler that lay on my desk and broke it in two
without an effort. His pallor was terrible to see. He wiped away the
beads of perspiration that stood on his forehead. He, who had never
known his wishes resisted, was being maddened by the obstinacy of this
child. He pressed his two hands on Beautrelet's shoulder and,
emphasizing every syllable, continued:
</p><p>"You shall do as I tell you, Beautrelet. You shall say that your latest
discoveries have convinced you of my death, that there is not the least
doubt about it. You shall say so because I wish it, because it has to
be believed that I am dead. You shall say so, above all, because, if
you do not say so--"
</p><p>"Because, if I do not say so--?"
</p><p>"Your father will be kidnapped to-night, as Ganimard and Holmlock
Shears were."
</p><p>Beautrelet gave a smile.
</p><p>"Don't laugh--answer!"
</p><p>"My answer is that I am very sorry to disappoint you, but I have
promised to speak and I shall speak."
</p><p>"Speak in the sense which I have told you."
</p><p>"I shall speak the truth," cried Beautrelet, eagerly. "It is something
which you can't understand, the pleasure, the need, rather, of saying
the thing that is and saying it aloud. The truth is here, in this brain
which has guessed it and discovered it; and it will come out, all naked
and quivering. The article, therefore, will be printed as I wrote it.
The world shall know that Lupin is alive and shall know the reason why
he wished to be considered dead. The world shall know all." And he
added, calmly, "And my father shall not be kidnapped."
</p><p>Once again, they were both silent, with their eyes still fixed upon
each other. They watched each other. Their swords were engaged up to
the hilt. And it was like the heavy silence that goes before the mortal
blow. Which of the two was to strike it?
</p><p>Lupin said, between his teeth:
</p><p>"Failing my instructions to the contrary, two of my friends have orders
to enter your father's room to-night, at three o'clock in the morning,
to seize him and carry him off to join Ganimard and Holmlock Shears."
</p><p>A burst of shrill laughter interrupted him:
</p><p>"Why, you highwayman, don't you understand," cried Beautrelet, "that I
have taken my precautions? So you think that I am innocent enough, ass
enough, to have sent my father home to his lonely little house in the
open country!" Oh, the gay, bantering laughter that lit up the boy's
face! It was a new sort of laugh on his lips, a laugh that showed the
influence of Lupin himself. And the familiar form of address which he
adopted placed him at once on his adversary's level. He continued:
</p><p>"You see, Lupin, your great fault is to believe your schemes
infallible. You proclaim yourself beaten, do you? What humbug! You are
convinced that you will always win the day in the end--and you forget
that others can have their little schemes, too. Mine is a very simple
one, my friend."
</p><p>It was delightful to hear him talk. He walked up and down, with his
hands in his pockets and with the easy swagger of a boy teasing a caged
beast. Really, at this moment, he was revenging, with the most terrible
revenges, all the victims of the great adventurer. And he concluded:
</p><p>"Lupin, my father is not in Savoy. He is at the other end of France, in
the centre of a big town, guarded by twenty of our friends, who have
orders not to lose sight of him until our battle is over. Would you
like details? He is at Cherbourg, in the house of one of the keepers of
the arsenal. And remember that the arsenal is closed at night and that
no one is allowed to enter it by day, unless he carries an
authorization and is accompanied by a guide."
</p><p>He stopped in front of Lupin and defied him, like a child making faces
at his playmate:
</p><p>"What do you say to that, master?"
</p><p>For some minutes, Lupin had stood motionless. Not a muscle of his face
had moved. What were his thoughts? Upon what action was he resolving?
To any one knowing the fierce violence of his pride the only possible
solution was the total, immediate, final collapse of his adversary. His
fingers twitched. For a second, I had a feeling that he was about to
throw himself upon the boy and wring his neck.
</p><p>"What do you say to that, master?" Beautrelet repeated.
</p><p>Lupin took up the telegram that lay on the table, held it out and said,
very calmly:
</p><p>"Here, baby, read that."
</p><p>Beautrelet became serious, suddenly, impressed by the gentleness of the
movement. He unfolded the paper and, at once, raising his eyes,
murmured:
</p><p>"What does it mean? I don't understand."
</p><p>"At any rate, you understand the first word," said Lupin, "the first
word of the telegram--that is to say, the name of the place from which
it was sent--look--'Cherbourg.'"
</p><p>"Yes--yes," stammered Beautrelet. "Yes--I understand--'Cherbourg'-and
then?"
</p><p>"And then?--I should think the rest is quite plain: 'Removal of luggage
finished. Friends left with it and will wait instructions till eight
morning. All well.' Is there anything there that seems obscure? The
word 'luggage'? Pooh, you wouldn't have them write 'M. Beautrelet,
senior'! What then? The way in which the operation was performed? The
miracle by which your father was taken out of Cherbourg Arsenal, in
spite of his twenty body-guards? Pooh, it's as easy as A B C! And the
fact remains that the luggage has been dispatched. What do you say to
that, baby?"
</p><p>With all his tense being, with all his exasperated energy, Isidore
tried to preserve a good countenance. But I saw his lips quiver, his
jaw shrink, his eyes vainly strive to fix upon a point. He lisped a few
words, then was silent and, suddenly, gave way and, with his hands
before his face, burst into loud sobs:
</p><p>"Oh, father! Father!"
</p><p>An unexpected result, which was certainly the collapse which Lupin's
pride demanded, but also something more, something infinitely touching
and infinitely artless. Lupin gave a movement of annoyance and took up
his hat, as though this unaccustomed display of sentiment were too much
for him. But, on reaching the door, he stopped, hesitated and then
returned, slowly, step by step.
</p><p>The soft sound of the sobs rose like the sad wailing of a little child
overcome with grief. The lad's shoulders marked the heart-rending
rhythm. Tears appeared through the crossed fingers. Lupin leaned
forward and, without touching Beautrelet, said, in a voice that had not
the least tone of pleasantry, nor even of the offensive pity of the
victor:
</p><p>"Don't cry, youngster. This is one of those blows which a man must
expect when he rushes headlong into the fray, as you did. The worst
disasters lie in wait for him. The destiny of fighters will have it so.
We must suffer it as bravely as we can." Then, with a sort of
gentleness, he continued, "You were right, you see: we are not enemies.
I have known it for long. From the very first, I felt for you, for the
intelligent creature that you are, an involuntary sympathy--and
admiration. And that is why I wanted to say this to you--don't be
offended, whatever you do: I should be extremely sorry to offend
you--but I must say it: well, give up struggling against me. I am not
saying this out of vanity--nor because I despise you--but, you see, the
struggle is too unequal. You do not know--nobody knows all the
resources which I have at my command. Look here, this secret of the
Hollow Needle which you are trying so vainly to unravel: suppose, for a
moment, that it is a formidable, inexhaustible treasure--or else an
invisible, prodigious, fantastic refuge--or both perhaps. Think of the
superhuman power which I must derive from it! And you do not know,
either, all the resources which I have within myself--all that my will
and my imagination enable me to undertake and to undertake
successfully. Only think that my whole life--ever since I was born, I
might almost say--has tended toward the same aim, that I worked like a
convict before becoming what I am and to realize, in its perfection,
the type which I wished to create--which I have succeeded in creating.
That being so--what can you do? At that very moment when you think that
victory lies within your grasp, it will escape you--there will be
something of which you have not thought--a trifle--a grain of sand
which I shall have put in the right place, unknown to you. I entreat
you, give up--I should be obliged to hurt you; and the thought
distresses me." And, placing his hand on the boy's forehead, he
repeated, "Once more, youngster, give up. I should only hurt you. Who
knows if the trap into which you will inevitably fall has not already
opened under your footsteps?"
</p><p>Beautrelet uncovered his face. He was no longer crying. Had he heard
Lupin's words? One might have doubted it, judging by his inattentive
air.
</p><p>For two or three minutes, he was silent. He seemed to weigh the
decision which he was about to take, to examine the reasons for and
against, to count up the favorable and unfavorable chances. At last, he
said to Lupin:
</p><p>"If I change the sense of the article, if I confirm the version of your
death and if I undertake never to contradict the false version which I
shall have sanctioned, do you swear that my father will be free?"
</p><p>"I swear it. My friends have taken your father by motor car to another
provincial town. At seven o'clock to-morrow morning, if the article in
the Grand Journal is what I want it to be, I shall telephone to them
and they will restore your father to liberty."
</p><p>"Very well," said Beautrelet. "I submit to your conditions."
</p><p>Quickly, as though he saw no object in prolonging the conversation
after accepting his defeat, he rose, took his hat, bowed to me, bowed
to Lupin and went out. Lupin watched him go, listened to the sound of
the door closing and muttered:
</p><p>"Poor little beggar!"
</p><hr/>
<p>At eight o'clock the next morning, I sent my man out to buy the Grand
Journal. It was twenty minutes before he brought me a copy, most of the
kiosks being already sold out.
</p><p>I unfolded the paper with feverish hands. Beautrelet's article appeared
on the front page. I give it as it stood and as it was quoted in the
press of the whole world:
</p><hr/>
<p><strong>THE AMBRUMESY MYSTERY</strong>
</p><p>I do not intend in these few sentences to set out in detail the mental
processes and the investigations that have enabled me to reconstruct
the tragedy--I should say the twofold tragedy--of Ambrumesy. In my
opinion, this sort of work and the judgments which it entails,
deductions, inductions, analyses and so on, are only interesting in a
minor degree and, in any case, are highly commonplace. No, I shall
content myself with setting forth the two leading ideas which I
followed; and, if I do that, it will be seen that, in so setting them
forth and in solving the two problems which they raise, I shall have
told the story just as it happened, in the exact order of the different
incidents.
</p><p>It may be said that some of these incidents are not proved and that I
leave too large a field to conjecture. That is quite true. But, in my
view, my theory is founded upon a sufficiently large number of proved
facts to be able to say that even those facts which are not proved must
follow from the strict logic of events. The stream is so often lost
under the pebbly bed: it is nevertheless the same stream that reappears
at intervals and mirrors back the blue sky.
</p><p>The first riddle that confronted me, a riddle not in detail, but as a
whole, was how came it that Lupin, mortally wounded, one might say,
managed to live for five or six weeks without nursing, medicine or
food, at the bottom of a dark hole?
</p><p>Let us start at the beginning. On Thursday the sixteenth of April, at
four o'clock in the morning, Arsene Lupin, surprised in the middle of
one of his most daring burglaries, runs away by the path leading to the
ruins and drops down shot. He drags himself painfully along, falls
again and picks himself up in the desperate hope of reaching the
chapel. The chapel contains a crypt, the existence of which he has
discovered by accident. If he can burrow there, he may be saved. By
dint of an effort, he approaches it, he is but a few yards away, when a
sound of footsteps approaches. Harassed and lost, he lets himself go.
The enemy arrives. It is Mlle. Raymonde de Saint-Veran.
</p><p>This is the prologue or rather the first scene of the drama.
</p><p>What happened between them? This is the easier to guess inasmuch as the
sequel of the adventure gives us all the necessary clues. At the girl's
feet lies a wounded man, exhausted by suffering, who will be captured
in two minutes. THIS MAN HAS BEEN WOUNDED BY HERSELF. Will she also
give him up?
</p><p>If he is Jean Daval's murderer, yes, she will let destiny take its
course. But, in quick sentences, he tells her the truth about this
awful murder committed by her uncle, M. de Gesvres. She believes him.
What will she do?
</p><p>Nobody can see them. The footman Victor is watching the little door.
The other, Albert, posted at the drawing-room window, has lost sight of
both of them. Will she give up the man she has wounded?
</p><p>The girl is carried away by a movement of irresistible pity, which any
woman will understand. Instructed by Lupin, with a few movements she
binds up the wound with his handkerchief, to avoid the marks which the
blood would leave. Then, with the aid of the key which he gives her,
she opens the door of the chapel. He enters, supported by the girl. She
locks the door again and walks away. Albert arrives.
</p><p>If the chapel had been visited at that moment or at least during the
next few minutes, before Lupin had had time to recover his strength, to
raise the flagstone and disappear by the stairs leading to the crypt,
he would have been taken. But this visit did not take place until six
hours later and then only in the most superficial way. As it is, Lupin
is saved; and saved by whom? By the girl who very nearly killed him.
</p><p>Thenceforth, whether she wishes it or no, Mlle. de Saint-Veran is his
accomplice. Not only is she no longer able to give him up, but she is
obliged to continue her work, else the wounded man will perish in the
shelter in which she has helped to conceal him. Therefore she continues.
</p><p>For that matter, if her feminine instinct makes the task a compulsory
one, it also makes it easy. She is full of artifice, she foresees and
forestalls everything. It is she who gives the examining magistrate a
false description of Arsene Lupin (the reader will remember the
difference of opinion on this subject between the cousins). It is she,
obviously, who, thanks to certain signs which I do not know of,
suspects an accomplice of Lupin's in the driver of the fly. She warns
him. She informs him of the urgent need of an operation. It is she, no
doubt, who substitutes one cap for the other. It is she who causes the
famous letter to be written in which she is personally threatened. How,
after that, is it possible to suspect her?
</p><p>It is she, who at that moment when I was about to confide my first
impressions to the examining magistrate, pretends to have seen me, the
day before, in the copsewood, alarms M. Filleul on my score and reduces
me to silence: a dangerous move, no doubt, because it arouses my
attention and directs it against the person who assails me with an
accusation which I know to be false; but an efficacious move, because
the most important thing of all is to gain time and close my lips.
</p><p>Lastly, it is she who, during forty days, feeds Lupin, brings him his
medicine (the chemist at Ouville will produce the prescriptions which
he made up for Mlle. de Saint-Veran), nurses him, dresses his wound,
watches over him AND CURES HIM.
</p><p>Here we have the first of our two problems solved, at the same time
that the Ambrumesy mystery is set forth. Arsene Lupin found, close at
hand, in the chateau itself, the assistance which was indispensable to
him in order, first, not to be discovered and, secondly, to live.
</p><p>He now lives. And we come to the second problem, corresponding with the
second Ambrumesy mystery, the study of which served me as a conducting
medium. Why does Lupin, alive, free, at the head of his gang,
omnipotent as before, why does Lupin make desperate efforts, efforts
with which I am constantly coming into collision, to force the idea of
his death upon the police and the public?
</p><p>We must remember that Mlle. de Saint-Veran was a very pretty girl. The
photographs reproduced in the papers after her disappearance give but
an imperfect notion of her beauty. That follows which was bound to
follow. Lupin, seeing this lovely girl daily for five or six weeks,
longing for her presence when she is not there, subjected to her charm
and grace when she is there, inhaling the cool perfume of her breath
when she bends over him, Lupin becomes enamored of his nurse. Gratitude
turns to love, admiration to passion. She is his salvation, but she is
also the joy of his eyes, the dream of his lonely hours, his light, his
hope, his very life.
</p><p>He respects her sufficiently not to take advantage of the girl's
devotion and not to make use of her to direct his confederates. There
is, in fact, a certain lack of decision apparent in the acts of the
gang. But he loves her also, his scruples weaken and, as Mlle. de
Saint-Veran refuses to be touched by a love that offends her, as she
relaxes her visits when they become less necessary, as she ceases them
entirely on the day when he is cured--desperate, maddened by grief, he
takes a terrible resolve. He leaves his lair, prepares his stroke and,
on Saturday the sixth of June, assisted by his accomplices, he carries
off the girl.
</p><p>This is not all. The abduction must not be known. All search, all
surmises, all hope, even, must be cut short. Mlle. de Saint-Veran must
pass for dead. There is a mock murder: proofs are supplied for the
police inquiries. There is doubt about the crime, a crime, for that
matter, not unexpected, a crime foretold by the accomplices, a crime
perpetrated to revenge the chief's death. And, through this very
fact--observe the marvelous ingenuity of the conception--through this
very fact, the belief in this death is, so to speak, stimulated.
</p><p>It is not enough to suggest a belief; it is necessary to compel a
certainty. Lupin foresees my interference. I am sure to guess the
trickery of the chapel. I am sure to discover the crypt. And, as the
crypt will be empty, the whole scaffolding will come to the ground.
</p><p><strong>THE CRYPT SHALL NOT BE EMPTY.</strong>
</p><p>In the same way, the death of Mlle. de Saint-Veran will not be
definite, unless the sea gives up her corpse.
</p><p><strong>THE SEA SHALL GIVE UP THE CORPSE OF MLLE. DE SAINT-VERAN.</strong>
</p><p>The difficulty is tremendous. The double obstacle seems insurmountable.
Yes, to any one but Lupin, but not to Lupin.
</p><p>As he had foreseen, I guess the trickery of the chapel, I discover the
crypt and I go down into the lair where Lupin has taken refuge. His
corpse is there!
</p><p>Any person who had admitted the death of Lupin as possible would have
been baffled. But I had not admitted this eventuality for an instant
(first, by intuition and, secondly, by reasoning). Pretense thereupon
became useless and every scheme vain. I said to myself at once that the
block of stone disturbed by the pickaxe had been placed there with a
very curious exactness, that the least knock was bound to make it fall
and that, in falling, it must inevitably reduce the head of the false
Arsene Lupin to pulp, in such a way as to make it utterly
irrecognizable.
</p><p>Another discovery: half an hour later, I hear that the body of Mlle. de
Saint-Veran has been found on the rocks at Dieppe--or rather a body
which is considered to be Mlle. de Saint-Veran's, for the reason that
the arm has a bracelet similar to one of that young lady's bracelets.
This, however, is the only mark of identity, for the corpse is
irrecognizable.
</p><p>Thereupon I remember and I understand. A few days earlier, I happened
to read in a number of the Vigie de Dieppe that a young American couple
staying at Envermeu had committed suicide by taking poison and that
their bodies had disappeared on the very night of the death. I hasten
to Envermeu. The story is true, I am told, except in so far as concerns
the disappearance, because the brothers of the victims came to claim
the corpses and took them away after the usual formalities. The name of
these brothers, no doubt, was Arsene Lupin &amp; Co.
</p><p>Consequently, the thing is proved. We know why Lupin shammed the murder
of the girl and spread the rumor of his own death. He is in love and
does not wish it known. And, to reach his ends, he shrinks from
nothing, he even undertakes that incredible theft of the two corpses
which he needs in order to impersonate himself and Mlle. de
Saint-Veran. In this way, he will be at ease. No one can disturb him.
No one will ever suspect the truth which he wishes to suppress.
</p><p>No one? Yes--three adversaries, at the most, might conceive doubts:
Ganimard, whose arrival is hourly expected; Holmlock Shears, who is
about to cross the Channel; and I, who am on the spot. This constitutes
a threefold danger. He removes it. He kidnaps Ganimard. He kidnaps
Holmlock Shears. He has me stabbed by Bredoux.
</p><p>One point alone remains obscure. Why was Lupin so fiercely bent upon
snatching the document about the Hollow Needle from me? He surely did
not imagine that, by taking it away, he could wipe out from my memory
the text of the five lines of which it consists! Then why? Did he fear
that the character of the paper itself, or some other clue, could give
me a hint?
</p><p>Be that as it may, this is the truth of the Ambrumesy mystery. I repeat
that conjecture plays a certain part in the explanation which I offer,
even as it played a great part in my personal investigation. But, if
one waited for proofs and facts to fight Lupin, one would run a great
risk either of waiting forever or else of discovering proofs and facts
carefully prepared by Lupin, which would lead in a direction
immediately opposite to the object in view. I feel confident that the
facts, when they are known, will confirm my surmise in every respect.
</p><hr/>
<p>So Isidore Beautrelet, mastered for a moment by Arsene Lupin,
distressed by the abduction of his father and resigned to defeat,
Isidore Beautrelet, in the end, was unable to persuade himself to keep
silence. The truth was too beautiful and too curious, the proofs which
he was able to produce were too logical and too conclusive for him to
consent to misrepresent it. The whole world was waiting for his
revelations. He spoke.
</p><hr/>
<p>On the evening of the day on which his article appeared, the newspapers
announced the kidnapping of M. Beautrelet, senior. Isidore was informed
of it by a telegram from Cherbourg, which reached him at three o'clock.
