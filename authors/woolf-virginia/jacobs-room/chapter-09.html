<p>The Countess of Rocksbier sat at the head of the table alone
with Jacob. Fed upon champagne and spices for at least two centuries
(four, if you count the female line), the Countess Lucy looked
well fed. A discriminating nose she had for scents, prolonged,
as if in quest of them; her underlip protruded a narrow red shelf;
her eyes were small, with sandy tufts for eyebrows, and her jowl
was heavy. Behind her (the window looked on Grosvenor Square)
stood Moll Pratt on the pavement, offering violets for sale; and
Mrs. Hilda Thomas, lifting her skirts, preparing to cross the
road. One was from Walworth; the other from Putney. Both wore
black stockings, but Mrs. Thomas was coiled in furs. The comparison
was much in Lady Rocksbier's favour. Moll had more humour, but
was violent; stupid too. Hilda Thomas was mealy-mouthed, all her
silver frames aslant; egg-cups in the drawing-room; and the windows
shrouded. Lady Rocksbier, whatever the deficiencies of her profile,
had been a great rider to hounds. She used her knife with authority,
tore her chicken bones, asking Jacob's pardon, with her own hands.</p>

<p>"Who is that driving by?" she asked Boxall, the butler.</p>

<p>"Lady Firtlemere's carriage, my lady," which reminded her to
send a card to ask after his lordship's health. A rude old lady,
Jacob thought. The wine was excellent. She called herself "an
old woman"&mdash;"so kind to lunch with an old woman"&mdash;which flattered
him. She talked of Joseph Chamberlain, whom she had known. She
said that Jacob must come and meet&mdash;one of our celebrities. And
the Lady Alice came in with three dogs on a leash, and Jackie,
who ran to kiss his grandmother, while Boxall brought in a telegram,
and Jacob was given a good cigar.</p>

<p>A few moments before a horse jumps it slows, sidles, gathers
itself together, goes up like a monster wave, and pitches down
on the further side. Hedges and sky swoop in a semicircle. Then
as if your own body ran into the horse's body and it was your
own forelegs grown with his that sprang, rushing through the air
you go, the ground resilient, bodies a mass of muscles, yet you
have command too, upright stillness, eyes accurately judging.
Then the curves cease, changing to downright hammer strokes, which
jar; and you draw up with a jolt; sitting back a little, sparkling,
tingling, glazed with ice over pounding arteries, gasping: "Ah!
ho! Hah!" the steam going up from the horses as they jostle together
at the cross-roads, where the signpost is, and the woman in the
apron stands and stares at the doorway. The man raises himself
from the cabbages to stare too.</p>

<p>So Jacob galloped over the fields of Essex, flopped in the mud,
lost the hunt, and rode by himself eating sandwiches, looking
over the hedges, noticing the colours as if new scraped, cursing
his luck.</p>

<p>He had tea at the Inn; and there they all were, slapping, stamping,
saying, "After you," clipped, curt, jocose, red as the wattles
of turkeys, using free speech until Mrs. Horsefield and her friend
Miss Dudding appeared at the doorway with their skirts hitched
up, and hair looping down. Then Tom Dudding rapped at the window
with his whip. A motor car throbbed in the courtyard. Gentlemen,
feeling for matches, moved out, and Jacob went into the bar with
Brandy Jones to smoke with the rustics. There was old Jevons with
one eye gone, and his clothes the colour of mud, his bag over
his back, and his brains laid feet down in earth among the violet
roots and the nettle roots; Mary Sanders with her box of wood;
and Tom sent for beer, the half-witted son of the sexton&mdash;all
this within thirty miles of London.</p>

<p>Mrs. Papworth, of Endell Street, Covent Garden, did for Mr. Bonamy
in New Square, Lincoln's Inn, and as she washed up the dinner
things in the scullery she heard the young gentlemen talking in
the room next door. Mr. Sanders was there again; Flanders she
meant; and where an inquisitive old woman gets a name wrong, what
chance is there that she will faithfully report an argument? As
she held the plates under water and then dealt them on the pile
beneath the hissing gas, she listened: heard Sanders speaking
in a loud rather overbearing tone of voice: "good," he said, and
"absolute" and "justice" and "punishment," and "the will of the
majority." Then her gentleman piped up; she backed him for argument
against Sanders. Yet Sanders was a fine young fellow (here all
the scraps went swirling round the sink, scoured after by her
purple, almost nailless hands). "Women"&mdash;she thought, and wondered
what Sanders and her gentleman did in <em>THAT </em>line, one
eyelid sinking perceptibly as she mused, for she was the mother
of nine&mdash;three still-born and one deaf and dumb from birth. Putting
the plates in the rack she heard once more Sanders at it again
("He don't give Bonamy a chance," she thought). "Objective something,"
said Bonamy; and "common ground" and something else&mdash;all very
long words, she noted. "Book learning does it," she thought to
herself, and, as she thrust her arms into her jacket, heard something&mdash;might
be the little table by the fire&mdash;fall; and then stamp, stamp,
stamp&mdash;as if they were having at each other&mdash;round the room, making
the plates dance.</p>

<p>"To-morrow's breakfast, sir," she said, opening the door; and
there were Sanders and Bonamy like two bulls of Bashan driving
each other up and down, making such a racket, and all them chairs
in the way. They never noticed her. She felt motherly towards
them. "Your breakfast, sir," she said, as they came near. And
Bonamy, all his hair touzled and his tie flying, broke off, and
pushed Sanders into the arm-chair, and said Mr. Sanders had smashed
the coffee-pot and he was teaching Mr. Sanders&mdash;</p>

<p>Sure enough, the coffee-pot lay broken on the hearthrug.</p>

<p>"Any day this week except Thursday," wrote Miss Perry, and this
was not the first invitation by any means. Were all Miss Perry's
weeks blank with the exception of Thursday, and was her only desire
to see her old friend's son? Time is issued to spinster ladies
of wealth in long white ribbons. These they wind round and round,
round and round, assisted by five female servants, a butler, a
fine Mexican parrot, regular meals, Mudie's library, and friends
dropping in. A little hurt she was already that Jacob had not
called.</p>

<p>"Your mother," she said, "is one of my oldest friends."</p>

<p>Miss Rosseter, who was sitting by the fire, holding the Spectator
between her cheek and the blaze, refused to have a fire screen,
but finally accepted one. The weather was then discussed, for
in deference to Parkes, who was opening little tables, graver
matters were postponed. Miss Rosseter drew Jacob's attention to
the beauty of the cabinet.</p>

<p>"So wonderfully clever in picking things up," she said. Miss
Perry had found it in Yorkshire. The North of England was discussed.
When Jacob spoke they both listened. Miss Perry was bethinking
her of something suitable and manly to say when the door opened
and Mr. Benson was announced. Now there were four people sitting
in that room. Miss Perry aged 66; Miss Rosseter 42; Mr. Benson
38; and Jacob 25.</p>

<p>"My old friend looks as well as ever," said Mr. Benson, tapping
the bars of the parrot's cage; Miss Rosseter simultaneously praised
the tea; Jacob handed the wrong plates; and Miss Perry signified
her desire to approach more closely. "Your brothers," she began
vaguely.</p>

<p>"Archer and John," Jacob supplied her. Then to her pleasure she
recovered Rebecca's name; and how one day "when you were all little
boys, playing in the drawing-room&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But Miss Perry has the kettle-holder," said Miss Rosseter, and
indeed Miss Perry was clasping it to her breast. (Had she, then,
loved Jacob's father?)</p>

<p>"So clever"&mdash;"not so good as usual"&mdash;"I thought it most unfair,"
said Mr. Benson and Miss Rosseter, discussing the Saturday Westminster.
Did they not compete regularly for prizes? Had not Mr. Benson
three times won a guinea, and Miss Rosseter once ten and sixpence?
Of course Everard Benson had a weak heart, but still, to win prizes,
remember parrots, toady Miss Perry, despise Miss Rosseter, give
tea-parties in his rooms (which were in the style of Whistler,
with pretty books on tables), all this, so Jacob felt without
knowing him, made him a contemptible ass. As for Miss Rosseter,
she had nursed cancer, and now painted water-colours.</p>

<p>"Running away so soon?" said Miss Perry vaguely. "At home every
afternoon, if you've nothing better to do&mdash;except Thursdays."</p>

<p>"I've never known you desert your old ladies once," Miss Rosseter
was saying, and Mr. Benson was stooping over the parrot's cage,
and Miss Perry was moving towards the bell....</p>

<p>The fire burnt clear between two pillars of greenish marble,
and on the mantelpiece there was a green clock guarded by Britannia
leaning on her spear. As for pictures&mdash;a maiden in a large hat
offered roses over the garden gate to a gentleman in eighteenth-century
costume. A mastiff lay extended against a battered door. The lower
panes of the windows were of ground glass, and the curtains, accurately
looped, were of plush and green too.</p>

<p>Laurette and Jacob sat with their toes in the fender side by
side, in two large chairs covered in green plush. Laurette's skirts
were short, her legs long, thin, and transparently covered. Her
fingers stroked her ankles.</p>

<p>"It's not exactly that I don't understand them," she was saying
thoughtfully. "I must go and try again."</p>

<p>"What time will you be there?" said Jacob.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"To-morrow?"</p>

<p>No, not to-morrow.</p>

<p>"This weather makes me long for the country," she said, looking
over her shoulder at the back view of tall houses through the
window.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd been with me on Saturday," said Jacob.</p>

<p>"I used to ride," she said. She got up gracefully, calmly. Jacob
got up. She smiled at him. As she shut the door he put so many
shillings on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>Altogether a most reasonable conversation; a most respectable
room; an intelligent girl. Only Madame herself seeing Jacob out
had about her that leer, that lewdness, that quake of the surface
(visible in the eyes chiefly), which threatens to spill the whole
bag of ordure, with difficulty held together, over the pavement.
In short, something was wrong.</p>

<p>Not so very long ago the workmen had gilt the final "y" in Lord
Macaulay's name, and the names stretched in unbroken file round
the dome of the British Museum. At a considerable depth beneath,
many hundreds of the living sat at the spokes of a cart-wheel
copying from printed books into manuscript books; now and then
rising to consult the catalogue; regaining their places stealthily,
while from time to time a silent man replenished their compartments.</p>

<p>There was a little catastrophe. Miss Marchmont's pile overbalanced
and fell into Jacob's compartment. Such things happened to Miss
Marchmont. What was she seeking through millions of pages, in
her old plush dress, and her wig of claret-coloured hair, with
her gems and her chilblains? Sometimes one thing, sometimes another,
to confirm her philosophy that colour is sound&mdash;or, perhaps, it
has something to do with music. She could never quite say, though
it was not for lack of trying. And she could not ask you back
to her room, for it was "not very clean, I'm afraid," so she must
catch you in the passage, or take a chair in Hyde Park to explain
her philosophy. The rhythm of the soul depends on it&mdash;("how rude
the little boys are!" she would say), and Mr. Asquith's Irish
policy, and Shakespeare comes in, "and Queen Alexandra most graciously
once acknowledged a copy of my pamphlet," she would say, waving
the little boys magnificently away. But she needs funds to publish
her book, for "publishers are capitalists&mdash;publishers are cowards."
And so, digging her elbow into her pile of books it fell over.</p>

<p>Jacob remained quite unmoved.</p>

<p>But Fraser, the atheist, on the other side, detesting plush,
more than once accosted with leaflets, shifted irritably. He abhorred
vagueness&mdash;the Christian religion, for example, and old Dean Parker's
pronouncements. Dean Parker wrote books and Fraser utterly destroyed
them by force of logic and left his children unbaptized&mdash;his wife
did it secretly in the washing basin&mdash;but Fraser ignored her,
and went on supporting blasphemers, distributing leaflets, getting
up his facts in the British Museum, always in the same check suit
and fiery tie, but pale, spotted, irritable. Indeed, what a work&mdash;to
destroy religion!</p>

<p>Jacob transcribed a whole passage from Marlowe.</p>

<p>Miss Julia Hedge, the feminist, waited for her books. They did
not come. She wetted her pen. She looked about her. Her eye was
caught by the final letters in Lord Macaulay's name. And she read
them all round the dome&mdash;the names of great men which remind us&mdash;"Oh
damn," said Julia Hedge, "why didn't they leave room for an Eliot
or a Bronte?"</p>

<p>Unfortunate Julia! wetting her pen in bitterness, and leaving
her shoe laces untied. When her books came she applied herself
to her gigantic labours, but perceived through one of the nerves
of her exasperated sensibility how composedly, unconcernedly,
and with every consideration the male readers applied themselves
to theirs. That young man for example. What had he got to do except
copy out poetry? And she must study statistics. There are more
women than men. Yes; but if you let women work as men work, they'll
die off much quicker. They'll become extinct. That was her argument.
Death and gall and bitter dust were on her pen-tip; and as the
afternoon wore on, red had worked into her cheek-bones and a light
was in her eyes.</p>

<p>But what brought Jacob Flanders to read Marlowe in the British
Museum? Youth, youth&mdash;something savage&mdash;something pedantic. For
example, there is Mr. Masefield, there is Mr. Bennett. Stuff them
into the flame of Marlowe and burn them to cinders. Let not a
shred remain. Don't palter with the second rate. Detest your own
age. Build a better one. And to set that on foot read incredibly
dull essays upon Marlowe to your friends. For which purpose one
most collate editions in the British Museum. One must do the thing
oneself. Useless to trust to the Victorians, who disembowel, or
to the living, who are mere publicists. The flesh and blood of
the future depends entirely upon six young men. And as Jacob was
one of them, no doubt he looked a little regal and pompous as
he turned his page, and Julia Hedge disliked him naturally enough.</p>

<p>But then a pudding-faced man pushed a note towards Jacob, and
Jacob, leaning back in his chair, began an uneasy murmured conversation,
and they went off together (Julia Hedge watched them), and laughed
aloud (she thought) directly they were in the hall.</p>

<p>Nobody laughed in the reading-room. There were shirtings, murmurings,
apologetic sneezes, and sudden unashamed devastating coughs. The
lesson hour was almost over. Ushers were collecting exercises.
Lazy children wanted to stretch. Good ones scribbled assiduously&mdash;ah,
another day over and so little done! And now and then was to be
heard from the whole collection of human beings a heavy sigh,
after which the humiliating old man would cough shamelessly, and
Miss Marchmont hinnied like a horse.</p>

<p>Jacob came back only in time to return his books.</p>

<p>The books were now replaced. A few letters of the alphabet were
sprinkled round the dome. Closely stood together in a ring round
the dome were Plato, Aristotle, Sophocles, and Shakespeare; the
literature of Rome, Greece, China, India, Persia. One leaf of
poetry was pressed flat against another leaf, one burnished letter
laid smooth against another in a density of meaning, a conglomeration
of loveliness.</p>

<p>"One does want one's tea," said Miss Marchmont, reclaiming her
shabby umbrella.</p>

<p>Miss Marchmont wanted her tea, but could never resist a last
look at the Elgin Marbles. She looked at them sideways, waving
her hand and muttering a word or two of salutation which made
Jacob and the other man turn round. She smiled at them amiably.
It all came into her philosophy&mdash;that colour is sound, or perhaps
it has something to do with music. And having done her service,
she hobbled off to tea. It was closing time. The public collected
in the hall to receive their umbrellas.</p>

<p>For the most part the students wait their turn very patiently.
To stand and wait while some one examines white discs is soothing.
The umbrella will certainly be found. But the fact leads you on
all day through Macaulay, Hobbes, Gibbon; through octavos, quartos,
folios; sinks deeper and deeper through ivory pages and morocco
bindings into this density of thought, this conglomeration of
knowledge.</p>

<p>Jacob's walking-stick was like all the others; they had muddled
the pigeon-holes perhaps.</p>

<p>There is in the British Museum an enormous mind. Consider that
Plato is there cheek by jowl with Aristotle; and Shakespeare with
Marlowe. This great mind is hoarded beyond the power of any single
mind to possess it. Nevertheless (as they take so long finding
one's walking-stick) one can't help thinking how one might come
with a notebook, sit at a desk, and read it all through. A learned
man is the most venerable of all&mdash;a man like Huxtable of Trinity,
who writes all his letters in Greek, they say, and could have
kept his end up with Bentley. And then there is science, pictures,
architecture,&mdash;an enormous mind.</p>

<p>They pushed the walking-stick across the counter. Jacob stood
beneath the porch of the British Museum. It was raining. Great
Russell Street was glazed and shining&mdash;here yellow, here, outside
the chemist's, red and pale blue. People scuttled quickly close
to the wall; carriages rattled rather helter-skelter down the
streets. Well, but a little rain hurts nobody. Jacob walked off
much as if he had been in the country; and late that night there
he was sitting at his table with his pipe and his book.</p>

<p>The rain poured down. The British Museum stood in one solid immense
mound, very pale, very sleek in the rain, not a quarter of a mile
from him. The vast mind was sheeted with stone; and each compartment
in the depths of it was safe and dry. The night-watchmen, flashing
their lanterns over the backs of Plato and Shakespeare, saw that
on the twenty-second of February neither flame, rat, nor burglar
was going to violate these treasures&mdash;poor, highly respectable
men, with wives and families at Kentish Town, do their best for
twenty years to protect Plato and Shakespeare, and then are buried
at Highgate.</p>

<p>Stone lies solid over the British Museum, as bone lies cool over
the visions and heat of the brain. Only here the brain is Plato's
brain and Shakespeare's; the brain has made pots and statues,
great bulls and little jewels, and crossed the river of death
this way and that incessantly, seeking some landing, now wrapping
the body well for its long sleep; now laying a penny piece on
the eyes; now turning the toes scrupulously to the East. Meanwhile,
Plato continues his dialogue; in spite of the rain; in spite of
the cab whistles; in spite of the woman in the mews behind Great
Ormond Street who has come home drunk and cries all night long,
"Let me in! Let me in!"</p>

<p>In the street below Jacob's room voices were raised.</p>

<p>But he read on. For after all Plato continues imperturbably.
And Hamlet utters his soliloquy. And there the Elgin Marbles lie,
all night long, old Jones's lantern sometimes recalling Ulysses,
or a horse's head; or sometimes a flash of gold, or a mummy's
sunk yellow cheek. Plato and Shakespeare continue; and Jacob,
who was reading the Phaedrus, heard people vociferating round
the lamp-post, and the woman battering at the door and crying,
"Let me in!" as if a coal had dropped from the fire, or a fly,
falling from the ceiling, had lain on its back, too weak to turn
over.</p>

<p>The Phaedrus is very difficult. And so, when at length one reads
straight ahead, falling into step, marching on, becoming (so it
seems) momentarily part of this rolling, imperturbable energy,
which has driven darkness before it since Plato walked the Acropolis,
it is impossible to see to the fire.</p>

<p>The dialogue draws to its close. Plato's argument is done. Plato's
argument is stowed away in Jacob's mind, and for five minutes
Jacob's mind continues alone, onwards, into the darkness. Then,
getting up, he parted the curtains, and saw, with astonishing
clearness, how the Springetts opposite had gone to bed; how it
rained; how the Jews and the foreign woman, at the end of the
street, stood by the pillar-box, arguing.</p>

<p>Every time the door opened and fresh people came in, those already
in the room shifted slightly; those who were standing looked over
their shoulders; those who were sitting stopped in the middle
of sentences. What with the light, the wine, the strumming of
a guitar, something exciting happened each time the door opened.
Who was coming in?</p>

<p>"That's Gibson."</p>

<p>"The painter?"</p>

<p>"But go on with what you were saying."</p>

<p>They were saying something that was far, far too intimate to
be said outright. But the noise of the voices served like a clapper
in little Mrs. Withers's mind, scaring into the air blocks of
small birds, and then they'd settle, and then she'd feel afraid,
put one hand to her hair, bind both round her knees, and look
up at Oliver Skelton nervously, and say:</p>

<p>"Promise, <em>PROMISE, </em>you'll tell no one." ... so considerate
he was, so tender. It was her husband's character that she discussed.
He was cold, she said.</p>

<p>Down upon them came the splendid Magdalen, brown, warm, voluminous,
scarcely brushing the grass with her sandalled feet. Her hair
flew; pins seemed scarcely to attach the flying silks. An actress
of course, a line of light perpetually beneath her. It was only
"My dear" that she said, but her voice went jodelling between
Alpine passes. And down she tumbled on the floor, and sang, since
there was nothing to be said, round ah's and oh's. Mangin, the
poet, coming up to her, stood looking down at her, drawing at
his pipe. The dancing began.</p>

<p>Grey-haired Mrs. Keymer asked Dick Graves to tell her who Mangin
was, and said that she had seen too much of this sort of thing
in Paris (Magdalen had got upon his knees; now his pipe was in
her mouth) to be shocked. "Who is that?" she said, staying her
glasses when they came to Jacob, for indeed he looked quiet, not
indifferent, but like some one on a beach, watching.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, let me lean on you," gasped Helen Askew, hopping
on one foot, for the silver cord round her ankle had worked loose.
Mrs. Keymer turned and looked at the picture on the wall.</p>

<p>"Look at Jacob," said Helen (they were binding his eyes for some
game).</p>

<p>And Dick Graves, being a little drunk, very faithful, and very
simple-minded, told her that he thought Jacob the greatest man
he had ever known. And down they sat cross-legged upon cushions
and talked about Jacob, and Helen's voice trembled, for they both
seemed heroes to her, and the friendship between them so much
more beautiful than women's friendships. Anthony Pollett now asked
her to dance, and as she danced she looked at them, over her shoulder,
standing at the table, drinking together.</p>

<p>The magnificent world&mdash;the live, sane, vigorous world .... These
words refer to the stretch of wood pavement between Hammersmith
and Holborn in January between two and three in the morning. That
was the ground beneath Jacob's feet. It was healthy and magnificent
because one room, above a mews, somewhere near the river, contained
fifty excited, talkative, friendly people. And then to stride
over the pavement (there was scarcely a cab or policeman in sight)
is of itself exhilarating. The long loop of Piccadilly, diamond-stitched,
shows to best advantage when it is empty. A young man has nothing
to fear. On the contrary, though he may not have said anything
brilliant, he feels pretty confident he can hold his own. He was
pleased to have met Mangin; he admired the young woman on the
floor; he liked them all; he liked that sort of thing. In short,
all the drums and trumpets were sounding. The street scavengers
were the only people about at the moment. It is scarcely necessary
to say how well-disposed Jacob felt towards them; how it pleased
him to let himself in with his latch-key at his own door; how
he seemed to bring back with him into the empty room ten or eleven
people whom he had not known when he set out; how he looked about
for something to read, and found it, and never read it, and fell
asleep.</p>

<p>Indeed, drums and trumpets is no phrase. Indeed, Piccadilly and
Holborn, and the empty sitting-room and the sitting-room with
fifty people in it are liable at any moment to blow music into
the air. Women perhaps are more excitable than men. It is seldom
that any one says anything about it, and to see the hordes crossing
Waterloo Bridge to catch the non-stop to Surbiton one might think
that reason impelled them. No, no. It is the drums and trumpets.
Only, should you turn aside into one of those little bays on Waterloo
Bridge to think the matter over, it will probably seem to you
all a muddle&mdash;all a mystery.</p>

<p>They cross the Bridge incessantly. Sometimes in the midst of
carts and omnibuses a lorry will appear with great forest trees
chained to it. Then, perhaps, a mason's van with newly lettered
tombstones recording how some one loved some one who is buried
at Putney. Then the motor car in front jerks forward, and the
tombstones pass too quick for you to read more. All the time the
stream of people never ceases passing from the Surrey side to
the Strand; from the Strand to the Surrey side. It seems as if
the poor had gone raiding the town, and now trapesed back to their
own quarters, like beetles scurrying to their holes, for that
old woman fairly hobbles towards Waterloo, grasping a shiny bag,
as if she had been out into the light and now made off with some
scraped chicken bones to her hovel underground. On the other hand,
though the wind is rough and blowing in their faces, those girls
there, striding hand in hand, shouting out a song, seem to feel
neither cold nor shame. They are hatless. They triumph.</p>

<p>The wind has blown up the waves. The river races beneath us,
and the men standing on the barges have to lean all their weight
on the tiller. A black tarpaulin is tied down over a swelling
load of gold. Avalanches of coal glitter blackly. As usual, painters
are slung on planks across the great riverside hotels, and the
hotel windows have already points of light in them. On the other
side the city is white as if with age; St. Paul's swells white
above the fretted, pointed, or oblong buildings beside it. The
cross alone shines rosy-gilt. But what century have we reached?
Has this procession from the Surrey side to the Strand gone on
for ever? That old man has been crossing the Bridge these six
hundred years, with the rabble of little boys at his heels, for
he is drunk, or blind with misery, and tied round with old clouts
of clothing such as pilgrims might have worn. He shuffles on.
No one stands still. It seems as if we marched to the sound of
music; perhaps the wind and the river; perhaps these same drums
and trumpets&mdash;the ecstasy and hubbub of the soul. Why, even the
unhappy laugh, and the policeman, far from judging the drunk man,
surveys him humorously, and the little boys scamper back again,
and the clerk from Somerset House has nothing but tolerance for
him, and the man who is reading half a page of Lothair at the
bookstall muses charitably, with his eyes off the print, and the
girl hesitates at the crossing and turns on him the bright yet
vague glance of the young.</p>

<p>Bright yet vague. She is perhaps twenty-two. She is shabby. She
crosses the road and looks at the daffodils and the red tulips
in the florist's window. She hesitates, and makes off in the direction
of Temple Bar. She walks fast, and yet anything distracts her.
Now she seems to see, and now to notice nothing.</p>
