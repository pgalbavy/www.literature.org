<p>Her mother's wailing could still be heard from overhead, though
more faintly; and old Charley Lohr was coming down the stairs
alone.</p>

<p>He looked at Alice compassionately. "I was just comin' to suggest
maybe you'd excuse yourself from your company," he said. "Your
mother was bound not to disturb you, and tried her best to keep
you from hearin' how she's takin' on, but I thought probably you
better see to her."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll come. What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "<em>I</em> only stepped over to offer my sympathy
and services, as it were. <em>I</em> thought of course you folks
knew all about it. Fact is, it was in the evening paper&mdash;just
a little bit of an item on the back page, of course."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>He coughed. "Well, it ain't anything so terrible," he said. "Fact
is, your brother Walter's got in a little trouble&mdash;well, I suppose
you might call it quite a good deal of trouble. Fact is, he's
quite considerable short in his accounts down at Lamb and Company."</p>

<p>Alice ran up the stairs and into her father's room, where Mrs.
Adams threw herself into her daughter's arms. "Is he gone?" she
sobbed. "He didn't hear me, did he? I tried so hard&#11834;"</p>

<p>Alice patted the heaving shoulders her arms enclosed. "No, no,"
she said. "He didn't hear you&mdash;it wouldn't have mattered&mdash;he doesn't
matter anyway."</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>POOR </em>Walter!" The mother cried. "Oh, the <em>POOR
</em>boy! Poor, poor Walter! Poor, poor, poor, <em>POOR</em>&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear, hush!" Alice tried to soothe her, but the lament
could not be abated, and from the other side of the room a repetition
in a different spirit was as continuous. Adams paced furiously
there, pounding his fist into his left palm as he strode. "The
dang boy!" he said. "Dang little fool! Dang idiot! Dang fool!
Whyn't he <em>TELL </em>me, the dang little fool?"</p>

<p>"He <em>DID!" </em>Mrs. Adams sobbed. "He <em>DID </em>tell you,
and you wouldn't <em>GIVE </em>it to him."</p>

<p>"He <em>DID, </em>did he?" Adams shouted at her. "What he begged
me for was money to run away with! He never dreamed of putting
back what he took. What the dangnation you talking about&mdash;accusing
me!"</p>

<p>"He <em>NEEDED </em>it," she said. "He needed it to run away
with! How could he expect to <em>LIVE, </em>after he got away,
if he didn't have a little money? Oh, poor, poor, <em>POOR </em>Walter!
Poor, poor, poor&#11834;"</p>

<p>She went back to this repetition; and Adams went back to his
own, then paused, seeing his old friend standing in the hallway
outside the open door.</p>

<p>"Ah &mdash;I'll just be goin', I guess, Virgil," Lohr said. "I
don't see as there's any use my tryin' to say any more. I'll do
anything you want me to, you understand."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," Adams said, and, groaning, came and went down
the stairs with him. "You say you didn't see the old man at all?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't know a thing about what he's going to do," Lohr
said, as they reached the lower floor. "Not a thing. But look
here, Virgil, I don't see as this calls for you and your wife
to take on so hard about&mdash;anyhow not as hard as the way you've
started."</p>

<p>"No," Adams gulped. "It always seems that way to the other party
that's only looking on!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I know that, of course," old Charley returned, soothingly.
"But look here, Virgil: they may not catch the boy; they didn't
even seem to be sure what train he made, and if they do get him,
why, the ole man might decide not to prosecute if&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>HIM?" </em>Adams cried, interrupting. "Him not prosecute?
Why, that's what he's been waiting for, all along! He thinks my
boy and me both cheated him! Why, he was just letting Walter walk
into a trap! Didn't you say they'd been suspecting him for some
time back? Didn't you say they'd been watching him and were just
about fixing to arrest him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Lohr; "but you can't tell, especially if
you raise the money and pay it back."</p>

<p>"Every cent!" Adams vociferated. "Every last penny! I can raise
it &mdash;I <em>GOT </em>to raise it! I'm going to put a loan
on my factory to-morrow. Oh, I'll get it for him, you tell him!
Every last penny!"</p>

<p>"Well, ole feller, you just try and get quieted down some now."
Charley held out his hand in parting. "You and your wife just
quiet down some. You <em>AIN'T </em>the healthiest man in the
world, you know, and you already been under quite some strain
before this happened. You want to take care of yourself for the
sake of your wife and that sweet little girl upstairs, you know.
Now, good-night," he finished, stepping out upon the veranda.
"You send for me if there's anything I can do."</p>

<p>"Do?" Adams echoed. "There ain't anything <em>ANYBODY </em>can
do!" And then, as his old friend went down the path to the sidewalk,
he called after him, "You tell him I'll pay him every last cent!
Every last, dang, dirty <em>PENNY</em>!"</p>

<p>He slammed the door and went rapidly up the stairs, talking loudly
to himself. "Every dang, last, dirty penny! Thinks <em>EVERYBODY
</em>in this family wants to steal from him, does he? Thinks we're
<em>ALL </em>yellow, does he? I'll show him!" And he came into
his own room vociferating, "Every last, dang, dirty penny!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams had collapsed, and Alice had put her upon his bed,
where she lay tossing convulsively and sobbing, "Oh, <em>POOR
</em>Walter!" over and over, but after a time she varied the sorry
tune. "Oh, poor Alice!" she moaned, clinging to her daughter's
hand. "Oh, poor, <em>POOR </em>Alice to have <em>THIS </em>come
on the night of your dinner&mdash;just when everything seemed to be
going so well&mdash;at last&mdash;oh, poor, poor, <em>POOR</em>&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" Alice said, sharply. "Don't say 'poor Alice!' I'm all
right."</p>

<p>"You <em>MUST </em>be!" her mother cried, clutching her. "You've
just <em>GOT </em>to be! <em>ONE </em>of us has got to be all
right&mdash;surely God wouldn't mind just <em>ONE </em>of us being
all right&mdash;that wouldn't hurt Him&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, mother! Hush!"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Adams only clutched her the more tightly. "He seemed
<em>SUCH </em>a nice young man, dearie! He may not see this in
the paper &mdash;Mr. Lohr said it was just a little bit of an
item&mdash;he <em>MAY </em>not see it, dearie&#11834;"</p>

<p>Then her anguish went back to Walter again; and to his needs
as a fugitive&mdash;she had meant to repair his underwear, but had
postponed doing so, and her neglect now appeared to be a detail
as lamentable as the calamity itself. She could neither be stilled
upon it, nor herself exhaust its urgings to self-reproach, though
she finally took up another theme temporarily. Upon an unusually
violent outbreak of her husband's, in denunciation of the runaway,
she cried out faintly that he was cruel; and further wearied her
broken voice with details of Walter's beauty as a baby, and of
his bedtime pieties throughout his infancy.</p>

<p>So the hot night wore on. Three had struck before Mrs. Adams
was got to bed; and Alice, returning to her own room, could hear
her father's bare feet thudding back and forth after that. "Poor
papa!" she whispered in helpless imitation of her mother. "Poor
papa! Poor mama! Poor Walter! Poor all of us!"</p>

<p>She fell asleep, after a time, while from across the hall the
bare feet still thudded over their changeless route; and she woke
at seven, hearing Adams pass her door, shod. In her wrapper she
ran out into the hallway and found him descending the stairs.</p>

<p>"Papa!"</p>

<p>"Hush," he said, and looked up at her with reddened eyes. "Don't
wake your mother."</p>

<p>"I won't," she whispered. "How about you? You haven't slept any
at all!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did. I got some sleep. I'm going over to the works now.
I got to throw some figures together to show the bank. Don't worry:
I'll get things fixed up. You go back to bed. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Wait!" she bade him sharply.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"You've got to have some breakfast."</p>

<p>"Don't want 'ny."</p>

<p>"You wait!" she said, imperiously, and disappeared to return
almost at once. "I can cook in my bedroom slippers," she explained,
"but I don't believe I could in my bare feet!"</p>

<p>Descending softly, she made him wait in the dining-room until
she brought him toast and eggs and coffee. "Eat!" she said. "And
I'm going to telephone for a taxicab to take you, if you think
you've really got to go."</p>

<p>"No, I'm going to walk &mdash;I <em>WANT </em>to walk."</p>

<p>She shook her head anxiously. "You don't look able. You've walked
all night."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," he returned. "I tell you I got some sleep. I
got all I wanted anyhow."</p>

<p>"But, papa&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Here!" he interrupted, looking up at her suddenly and setting
down his cup of coffee. "Look here! What about this Mr. Russell?
I forgot all about him. What about him?"</p>

<p>Her lip trembled a little, but she controlled it before she spoke.
"Well, what about him, papa?" she asked, calmly enough.</p>

<p>"Well, we could hardly&#11834;" Adams paused, frowning heavily. "We
could hardly expect he wouldn't hear something about all this."</p>

<p>"Yes; of course he'll hear it, papa."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, what?" she asked, gently.</p>

<p>"You don't think he'd be the&mdash;the cheap kind it'd make a difference
with, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; he isn't cheap. It won't make any difference with him."</p>

<p>Adams suffered a profound sigh to escape him. "Well &mdash;I'm
glad of that, anyway."</p>

<p>"The difference," she explained&mdash;"the difference was made without
his hearing anything about Walter. He doesn't know about <em>THAT
</em>yet."</p>

<p>"Well, what does he know about?"</p>

<p>"Only," she said, "about me."</p>

<p>"What you mean by that, Alice?" he asked, helplessly.</p>

<p>"Never mind," she said. "It's nothing beside the real trouble
we're in &mdash;I'll tell you some time. You eat your eggs and
toast; you can't keep going on just coffee."</p>

<p>"I can't eat any eggs and toast," he objected, rising. "I can't."</p>

<p>"Then wait till I can bring you something else."</p>

<p>"No," he said, irritably. "I won't do it! I don't want any dang
food! And look here"&mdash;he spoke sharply to stop her, as she went
toward the telephone&mdash;"I don't want any dang taxi, either! You
look after your mother when she wakes up. I got to be at <em>WORK</em>!"</p>

<p>And though she followed him to the front door, entreating, he
could not be stayed or hindered. He went through the quiet morning
streets at a rickety, rapid gait, swinging his old straw hat in
his hands, and whispering angrily to himself as he went. His grizzled
hair, not trimmed for a month, blew back from his damp forehead
in the warm breeze; his reddened eyes stared hard at nothing from
under blinking lids; and one side of his face twitched startlingly
from time to time;&mdash;children might have run from him, or mocked
him.</p>

<p>When he had come into that fallen quarter his industry had partly
revived and wholly made odorous, a negro woman, leaning upon her
whitewashed gate, gazed after him and chuckled for the benefit
of a gossiping friend in the next tiny yard. "Oh, good Satan!
Wha'ssa matter that ole glue man?"</p>

<p>"Who? Him?" the neighbour inquired. "What he do now?"</p>

<p>"Talkin' to his ole se'f!" the first explained, joyously. "Look
like gone distracted&mdash;ole glue man!"</p>

<p>Adams's legs had grown more uncertain with his hard walk, and
he stumbled heavily as he crossed the baked mud of his broad lot,
but cared little for that, was almost unaware of it, in fact.
Thus his eyes saw as little as his body felt, and so he failed
to observe something that would have given him additional light
upon an old phrase that already meant quite enough for him.</p>

<p>There are in the wide world people who have never learned its
meaning; but most are either young or beautifully unobservant
who remain wholly unaware of the inner poignancies the words convey:
"a rain of misfortunes." It is a boiling rain, seemingly whimsical
in its choice of spots whereon to fall; and, so far as mortal
eye can tell, neither the just nor the unjust may hope to avoid
it, or need worry themselves by expecting it. It had selected
the Adams family for its scaldings; no question.</p>

<p>The glue-works foreman, standing in the doorway of the brick
shed, observed his employer's eccentric approach, and doubtfully
stroked a whiskered chin.</p>

<p>"Well, they ain't no putticular use gettin' so upset over it,"
he said, as Adams came up. "When a thing happens, why, it happens,
and that's all there is to it. When a thing's so, why, it's so.
All you can do about it is think if there's anything you <em>CAN
</em>do; and that's what you better be doin' with this case."</p>

<p>Adams halted, and seemed to gape at him. "What&mdash;case?" he said,
with difficulty. "Was it in the morning papers, too?"</p>

<p>"No, it ain't in no morning papers. My land! It don't need to
be in no papers; look at the <em>SIZE </em>of it!"</p>

<p>"The size of what?"</p>

<p>"Why, great God!" the foreman exclaimed. "He ain't even seen
it. Look! Look yonder!"</p>

<p>Adams stared vaguely at the man's outstretched hand and pointing
forefinger, then turned and saw a great sign upon the facade of
the big factory building across the street. The letters were large
enough to be read two blocks away.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"<em>AFTER THE FIFTEENTH OF NEXT MONTH<br/>
THIS BUILDING WILL BE OCCUPIED BY<br/>
THE J. A. LAMB LIQUID GLUE CO.  INC</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>A gray touring-car had just come to rest before the principal
entrance of the building, and J. A. Lamb himself descended from
it. He glanced over toward the humble rival of his projected great
industry, saw his old clerk, and immediately walked across the
street and the lot to speak to him.</p>

<p>"Well, Adams," he said, in his husky, cheerful voice, "how's
your glue-works?"</p>

<p>Adams uttered an inarticulate sound, and lifted the hand that
held his hat as if to make a protective gesture, but failed to
carry it out; and his arm sank limp at his side. The foreman,
however, seemed to feel that something ought to be said.</p>

<p>"Our glue-works, hell!" he remarked. "I guess we won't <em>HAVE
</em>no glue-works over here not very long, if we got to compete
with the sized thing you got over there!"</p>

<p>Lamb chuckled. "I kind of had some such notion," he said. "You
see, Virgil, I couldn't exactly let you walk off with it like
swallering a pat o' butter, now, could I? It didn't look exactly
reasonable to expect me to let go like that, now, did it?"</p>

<p>Adams found a half-choked voice somewhere in his throat. "Do
you&mdash;would you step into my office a minute, Mr. Lamb?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly I'm willing to have a little talk with you,"
the old gentleman said, as he followed his former employee indoors,
and he added, "I feel a lot more like it than I did before I got
<em>THAT </em>up, over yonder, Virgil!"</p>

<p>Adams threw open the door of the rough room he called his office,
having as justification for this title little more than the fact
that he had a telephone there and a deal table that served as
a desk. "Just step into the office, please," he said.</p>

<p>Lamb glanced at the desk, at the kitchen chair before it, at
the telephone, and at the partition walls built of old boards,
some covered with ancient paint and some merely weatherbeaten,
the salvage of a house-wrecker; and he smiled broadly. "So these
are your offices, are they?" he asked. "You expect to do quite
a business here, I guess, don't you, Virgil?"</p>

<p>Adams turned upon him a stricken and tortured face. "Have you
seen Charley Lohr since last night, Mr. Lamb?"</p>

<p>"No; I haven't seen Charley."</p>

<p>"Well, I told him to tell you," Adams began;&mdash;"I told him I'd
pay you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Pay me what you expect to make out o' glue, you mean, Virgil?"</p>

<p>"No," Adams said, swallowing. "I mean what my boy owes you. That's
what I told Charley to tell you. I told him to tell you I'd pay
you every last&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well, well!" the old gentleman interrupted, testily. "I don't
know anything about that."</p>

<p>"I'm expecting to pay you," Adams went on, swallowing again,
painfully. "I was expecting to do it out of a loan I thought I
could get on my glue-works."</p>

<p>The old gentleman lifted his frosted eyebrows. "Oh, out o' the
<em>GLUE-</em>works? You expected to raise money on the glue-works,
did you?"</p>

<p>At that, Adams's agitation increased prodigiously. "How'd you
<em>THINK I </em>expected to pay you?" he said. "Did you think
I expected to get money on my own old bones?" He slapped himself
harshly upon the chest and legs. "Do you think a bank'll lend
money on a man's ribs and his broken-down old knee-bones? They
won't do it! You got to have some <em>BUSINESS </em>prospects
to show 'em, if you haven't got any property nor securities; and
what business prospects have I got now, with that sign of yours
up over yonder? Why, you don't need to make an <em>OUNCE </em>o'
glue; your sign's fixed ME without your doing another lick! <em>THAT'S
</em>all you had to do; just put your sign up! You needn't to&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Just let me tell you something, Virgil Adams," the old man interrupted,
harshly. "I got just one right important thing to tell you before
we talk any further business; and that's this: there's some few
men in this town made their money in off-colour ways, but there
aren't many; and those there are have had to be a darn sight slicker
than you know how to be, or ever <em>WILL </em>know how to be!
Yes, sir, and they none of them had the little gumption to try
to make it out of a man that had the spirit not to let 'em, and
the <em>STRENGTH </em>not to let 'em! I know what you thought.
'Here,' you said to yourself, 'here's this ole fool J. A. Lamb;
he's kind of worn out and in his second childhood like; I can
put it over on him, without his ever&#11834;'"</p>

<p>"I did not!" Adams shouted. "A great deal <em>YOU </em>know about
my feelings and all what I said to myself! There's one thing I
want to tell <em>YOU, </em>and that's what I'm saying to myself
<em>NOW, </em>and what my feelings are this <em>MINUTE</em>!"</p>

<p>He struck the table a great blow with his thin fist, and shook
the damaged knuckles in the air. "I just want to tell you, whatever
I did feel, I don't feel <em>MEAN </em>any more; not to-day, I
don't. There's a meaner man in this world than <em>I</em> am,
Mr. Lamb!"</p>

<p>"Oh, so you feel better about yourself to-day, do you, Virgil?"</p>

<p>"You bet I do! You worked till you got me where you want me;
and I wouldn't do that to another man, no matter what he did to
me! I wouldn't&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What you talkin' about! How've I 'got you where I want you?'"</p>

<p>"Ain't it plain enough?" Adams cried. "You even got me where
I can't raise the money to pay back what my boy owes you! Do you
suppose anybody's fool enough to let me have a cent on this business
after one look at what you got over there across the road?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't."</p>

<p>"No, you don't," Adams echoed, hoarsely. "What's more, you knew
my house was mortgaged, and my&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I did not," Lamb interrupted, angrily. "What do <em>I</em> care
about your house?"</p>

<p>"What's the use your talking like that?" Adams cried. "You got
me where I can't even raise the money to pay what my boy owes
the company, so't I can't show any reason to stop the prosecution
and keep him out the penitentiary. That's where you worked till
you got ME!"</p>

<p>"What!" Lamb shouted. "You accuse me of&#11834;"</p>

<p>"'Accuse you?' What am I telling you? Do you think I got no <em>EYES?"
</em>And Adams hammered the table again. "Why, you knew the boy
was weak&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I did not!"</p>

<p>"Listen: you kept him there after you got mad at my leaving the
way I did. You kept him there after you suspected him; and you
had him watched; you let him go on; just waited to catch him and
ruin him!"</p>

<p>"You're crazy!" the old man bellowed. "I didn't know there was
anything against the boy till last night. You're <em>CRAZY, I
</em>say!"</p>

<p>Adams looked it. With his hair disordered over his haggard forehead
and bloodshot eyes; with his bruised hands pounding the table
and flying in a hundred wild and absurd gestures, while his feet
shuffled constantly to preserve his balance upon staggering legs,
he was the picture of a man with a mind gone to rags.</p>

<p>"Maybe I AM crazy!" he cried, his voice breaking and quavering.
"Maybe I am, but I wouldn't stand there and taunt a man with it
if I'd done to him what you've done to me! Just look at me: I
worked all my life for you, and what I did when I quit never harmed
you&mdash;it didn't make two cents' worth o' difference in your life
and it looked like it'd mean all the difference in the world to
my family&mdash;and now look what you've <em>DONE </em>to me for it!
I tell you, Mr. Lamb, there never was a man looked up to another
man the way I looked up to you the whole o' my life, but I don't
look up to you any more! You think you got a fine day of it now,
riding up in your automobile to look at that sign&mdash;and then over
here at my poor little works that you've ruined. But listen to
me just this one last time!" The cracking voice broke into falsetto,
and the gesticulating hands fluttered uncontrollably. "Just you
listen!" he panted. "You think I did you a bad turn, and now you
got me ruined for it, and you got my works ruined, and my family
ruined; and if anybody'd 'a' told me this time last year I'd ever
say such a thing to you I'd called him a dang liar, but I DO say
it: I say you've acted toward me like&mdash;like a&mdash;a doggone mean&mdash;man!"</p>

<p>His voice, exhausted, like his body, was just able to do him
this final service; then he sank, crumpled, into the chair by
the table, his chin down hard upon his chest.</p>

<p>"I tell you, you're crazy!" Lamb said again. "I never in the
world&#11834;"  But he checked himself, staring in sudden perplexity
at his accuser. "Look here!" he said. "What's the matter of you?
Have you got another of those&#11834;?" He put his hand upon Adams's
shoulder, which jerked feebly under the touch.</p>

<p>The old man went to the door and called to the foreman.</p>

<p>"Here!" he said. "Run and tell my chauffeur to bring my car over
here. Tell him to drive right up over the sidewalk and across
the lot. Tell him to hurry!"</p>

<p>So, it happened, the great J. A. Lamb a second time brought his
former clerk home, stricken and almost inanimate.</p>
