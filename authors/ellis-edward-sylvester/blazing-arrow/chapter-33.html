<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Red Crow, the friendly Shawanoe, who had proved his loyalty to
the whites in so many striking instances, left the little party
where he had halted them in the wood and walked rapidly toward
the gorge, which he intended should be crossed by the fugitives
and their animals.</p>

<p>It followed that, if such was his intention, the means of crossing
was at his command. So it proved.</p>

<p>He struck the gorge at a place where it was so narrow that Larry
Murphy, and even Mrs. Edwards herself, would have found no difficulty
in leaping it. The horses, if stripped of their loads and sharply
urged, would no doubt have done the same; but to meet such an
emergency some one had caused the trunks of two trees to lie as
close as possible side by side, the "dip" between the logs being
packed with dirt and gravel, so that a space of fully two feet
wide and quite level was presented. It was strong, and any horse
could walk over without trouble.</p>

<p>It was curious that the youths, while searching for just such
a spot the previous evening, should have missed it. They must
have passed quite near to it.</p>

<p>Red Crow stood a moment calmly contemplating the rude work of
art, his eyes roving from where he stood to the other side and
beyond. It would seem as if he ought to have been satisfied with
the strength of the bridge, but he appeared to be in doubt, and
to test it he started to walk across.</p>

<p>At the moment of doing so a figure stepped from behind one of
the large trees and advanced to him. Red Crow looked up and saw
Blazing Arrow, who, detecting his approach, had dodged behind
shelter. The face of the miscreant was the embodiment of rage
as he ground out the words: "Dog of a Shawanoe! friend of the
white man! you shall die! rot at the bottom of the water!"</p>

<p>The words were loud enough to be heard above the dull roar of
the current. Red Crow recoiled for a moment on catching sight
of his execrated relative, but it was through surprise rather
than fear. The next moment he took a step forward.</p>

<p>"Blazing Arrow is a rattlesnake! Arqu-wao does not fear him!
he hurt him when he was young and weak like a squaw, but Arqu-wao
is now a man and a warrior!"</p>

<p>While speaking, Red Crow hung his bow behind him and drew his
knife. Blazing Arrow had left his rifle leaning against the tree
where he was hiding, and his hunting-knife was in his hand when
he stepped upon the bridge.</p>

<p>Had the two been obliged to stay apart for a few minutes they
would have used the time in taunting each other, an art in which
the American race is hardly less adept than the Caucasian; but
they were eager to come together; their hatred was too burning
for either to waste any time.</p>

<p>They met in the middle of the bridge, directly over the sweeping
current, and assailed each other like a couple of catamounts.
It was a fight to the death, and was fiercely waged by each. Neither
would ask or show mercy, and one or both must succumb.</p>

<p>It would be distressing to describe the terrific encounter in
detail. Nothing could have been fiercer, but it continued only
a few minutes, when a spectator would have seen that Arqu-wao
was overmatched. Blazing Arrow was much the larger, and not only
was fully as active, but more powerful. He pressed his advantage
remorselessly, and, though he was severely wounded by the weapon
of the other, he conquered.</p>

<p>The swaying bodies kept their places on the narrow bridge, though
sometimes they narrowly missed rolling into the torrent beneath,
until finally the efforts of Arqu-wao relaxed. Then, seizing him
in his brawny arms, Blazing Arrow lifted him high in the air,
and holding him aloft for a moment, hissed:</p>

<p>"Die, dog of a Shawanoe, your blood is white!"</p>

<p>He swung the senseless body outward, and it shot downward like
a bowlder, and with a loud splash vanished beneath the surface.</p>

<p>But the bloody form of Blazing Arrow was scarcely ten seconds
behind it. The furious exclamations were yet trembling on the
dusky lips when the crack of a rifle broke the stillness. The
miscreant, with a resounding shriek, leaped clear of the bridge
and sped downward like a meteor, the spray flying high in the
air as he, too, vanished from human sight.</p>

<p>"Confound it!" muttered the enraged Simon Kenton, "why didn't
I get hyar jes' a minute sooner? I've give Blazing Arrer his last
sickness; but afore I done that he put poor Red Crow to sleep;
but it's all over now, and thar's no use of kickin'."</p>

<p>Advancing to the edge of the torrent, he looked in the direction
of the falls to see the bodies disappear. Once he thought he saw
a dark object for a moment, which he fancied might be one of them,
but it disappeared before he could make certain, and was not seen
again.</p>

<p>As he had remarked to himself, there was nothing to be gained
by "kicking," and with a sigh of regret over the unfortunate Red
Crow, or, as he was known among his own people, Arqu-wao, he turned
about and hurriedly rejoined his friends, who were greatly agitated
at the tragedy that they knew had taken place near them.</p>

<p>The scout told, in as few words as he could, what had occurred,
and added:</p>

<p>"It's too bad for Red Crow, but I'm afeared that rifle-shot and
the beautiful yell of Blazing Arrer has been heard by the rest
of the varmints; leastwise we don't want to stay hyar any longer."</p>

<p>Before allowing the party to cross the rude bridge with the animals,
Kenton preceded them and made a careful reconnoisance. He could
discover no signs of Shawanoes, and, picking up Blazing Arrow's
rifle from where it rested against the tree, he signalled the
pioneer and the rest to follow him over.</p>

<p>It was easy for all to obey, but a vexatious delay was caused
by the reluctance of the horses to trust themselves on the narrow
foot-bridge, with the rushing current below. In the very middle
of the support the leader became panic-stricken, and, in attempting
to back to the shore from whence he started, lost his balance,
and that was the last of him. The other reached the bank in safety.</p>

<p>There was no semblance of a path on the other side, and what
Red Crow would have done, had he lived, after crossing, cannot
be known; but Kenton did not hesitate. His knowledge of the country
enabled him to proceed intelligently. He explained the route clearly
to the pioneer, and leaving him to follow orders, he again assumed
the duties of rear guard, adding:</p>

<p>"Push ahead, Brigham, as best you can; to-night will settle whether
the folks get to the settlement or not. If we can dodge the varmints
till after the sun goes down we'll be all right."</p>

<p>"Suppose we get into trouble?"</p>

<p>"I'll signal you. If you hear this gun go off, don't pay any
'tention to it except to travel faster, if you can."</p>

<p>With an exchange of these brief sentences, the pioneer set out,
closely followed by his wife, the boys and the scout.</p>

<p>Fortunately the horse that went off the bridge did not take all
the lunch with him. Mr. Edwards brought out what was left and
divided it among his companions, and they ate as they walked.</p>

<p>They were now pursuing a clearly defined policy. It was to come
back to the regular trail at a point well beyond where the Indians
were believed to be waiting in ambush. If the hostiles could thus
be thrown behind them, there was reason to hope for the best.</p>

<p>The chief trouble was because of the horse. Without any path
for his feet, and with the trees now and then interfering, and
with places so impassable that they were compelled to make laborious
detours, the progress was exasperatingly slow; but with the passing
of the afternoon and the approach of night, hope strengthened.
Safety lay in darkness, which was close at hand.</p>

<p>At intervals the listening ear of the pioneer caught a familiar
signal from Kenton, but in every instance it was interpreted "All
right," and served to add to the buoyancy of the spirits of all.</p>

<p>The scout was strongly inclined to place a favorable explanation
on this immunity from attack. The Shawanoe war party was small
in numbers; it had suffered the loss of three or four of their
best men, among them their leader, Blazing Arrow. This weakened
them greatly.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the Shawanoes were hunting for the two
boys, or for the pioneer and his wife, they were confronted by
a marked change in the situation. Not only had the two couples
been united, but the most dreaded ranger of the border was with
them. There were five rifles among the whites instead of two,
and every person holding a weapon was not only ready, but was
skilled in its use. They knew of the threatened peril, and were
on the alert to guard against it.</p>

<p>In other words, the whites had increased and the red men decreased
to that extent that Kenton half believed the Shawanoes hesitated
to attack them. It was certain that they would not do so unless
they could gain some great advantage over them, which was what
the scout determined should not be gained if it lay in his power
to prevent it. Certainly, if skill and woodcraft could avail,
it never would come about.</p>

<p>The veteran ranger employed all the consummate art of which he
was master. He fell farther behind than any of his friends ever
suspected; he made long half way circuits through the woods, and
as they neared the trail he once passed entirely round the company
without their knowledge. Nothing escaped his lynx eyes, but, when
the sun at last went down and twilight stole through the forest,
he had not caught the first suspicious sign.</p>

<p>It was only fairly dark when Edwards stopped, as he had agreed
to do, on reaching the trail. Kenton was with them a few minutes
later.</p>

<p>"Things look powerful well," was his encouraging remark; "I haven't
catched sight of hide or hair of the varmints since that hoss
of yours turned summersets off the bridge."</p>

<p>"That is something to be grateful for," was the response of the
pioneer. "I feel more hopeful than at any time since leaving the
block-house."</p>

<p>"It is a purty good tramp yet afore we reach the settlement;
can you all stand it?"</p>

<p>"You know better than to ask me that question," replied the settler
with a laugh; "we have been on too many tramps ourselves, but
I don't know about the rest."</p>

<p>"Excepting me," was the cheery response of the wife. "I am so
glad to have Wharton and Larry safe with me that I know not what
fatigue is; I believe I could walk all night without suffering."</p>

<p>"If you give out, make the hoss help."</p>

<p>"No; he has had it harder than any of us. He'll be the first
to stop; but, Wharton, what about you?"</p>

<p>"I'll never let my mother beat me walking," he said with a laugh,
affectionately kissing her ruddy cheek.</p>

<p>"And as for Larry Murphy," added the young gentleman alluded
to, "it'll be a few years from now before he allows any one to
beat him in walking towards home, when he knows that a good supper
and bed is awaiting him there. I'm riddy, gintlemen, when ye say
the word."</p>

<p>The good fortune which attended the members of the party did
not desert them. What movements were made by the Shawanoes and
what their intentions were could never be known, but not a hostile
shot was fired within hearing of the fugitives, who at last reached
the settlement in safety, all profoundly grateful to heaven for
its mercy.</p>
