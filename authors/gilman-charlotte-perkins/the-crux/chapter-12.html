      There are some folk born to beauty,
        And some to plenteous gold,
      Some who are proud of being young,
        Some proud of being old.
      Some who are glad of happy love,
        Enduring, deep and true,
      And some who thoroughly enjoy
        The little things they do.</pre>

<p>Upon all this Grandma Pettigrew cast an observant eye, and meditated
sagely thereupon. Coming to a decision, she first took a course of
reading in some of Dr. Bellair's big books, and then developed a
series of perplexing symptoms, not of a too poignant or perilous
nature, that took her to Dr. Hale's office frequently.
</p><p>"You haven't repudiated Dr. Bellair, have you?" he asked her.
</p><p>"I have never consulted Jane Bellair as a physician," she replied,
"though I esteem her much as a friend."
</p><p>The old lady's company was always welcome to him; he liked her
penetrating eye, her close-lipped, sharp remarks, and appreciated the
real kindness of her heart.
</p><p>If he had known how closely she was peering into the locked recesses
of his own, and how much she saw there, he would perhaps have avoided
her as he did Vivian, and if he had known further that this ingenious
old lady, pursuing long genealogical discussions with him, had finally
unearthed a mutual old-time friend, and had forthwith started a
correspondence with that friend, based on this common acquaintance in
Carston, he might have left that city.
</p><p>The old-time friend, baited by Mrs. Pettigrew's innocent comment on Dr.
Hale's persistence in single blessedness, poured forth what she knew of
the cause with no more embellishment than time is sure to give.
</p><p>"I know why he won't marry," wrote she. "He had reason good to begin
with, but I never dreamed he'd be obstinate enough to keep it up
sixteen years. When he was a boy in college here I knew him well--he
was a splendid fellow, one of the very finest. But he fell desperately
in love with that beautiful Mrs. James--don't you remember about her?
She married a St. Cloud later, and he left her, I think. She was as
lovely as a cameo--and as hard and flat. That woman was the saintliest
thing that ever breathed. She wouldn't live with her husband because
he had done something wrong; she wouldn't get a divorce, nor let him,
because that was wicked--and she always had a string of boys round
her, and talked about the moral influence she had on them.
</p><p>"Young Hale worshipped her--simply worshipped her--and she let him.
She let them all. She had that much that was god-like about her--she
loved incense. You need not ask for particulars. She was far too
'particular' for that. But one light-headed chap went and drowned
himself--that was all hushed up, of course, but some of us felt pretty
sure why. He was a half-brother to Dick Hale, and Dick was awfully
fond of him. Then he turned hard and hateful all at once--used to talk
horrid about women. He kept straight enough--that's easy for a
mysogynist, and studying medicine didn't help him any--doctors and
ministers know too much about women. So there you are. But I'm
astonished to hear he's never gotten over it; he always was
obstinate--it's his only fault. They say he swore never to marry--if
he did, that accounts. Do give my regards if you see him again."
</p><p>Mrs. Pettigrew considered long and deeply over this information, as she
slowly produced a jersey striped with Roman vividness. It was noticeable
in this new life in Carston that Mrs. Pettigrew's knitted jackets had
grown steadily brighter in hue from month to month. Whereas, in
Bainville, purple and brown were the high lights, and black, slate and
navy blue the main colors; now her worsteds were as a painter's palette,
and the result not only cheered, but bade fair to inebriate.
</p><p>"A pig-headed man," she said to herself, as her needle prodded
steadily in and out; "a pig-headed man, with a pig-headedness of
sixteen years' standing. His hair must 'a turned gray from the strain
of it. And there's Vivian, biddin' fair to be an old maid after all.
What on <u>earth</u>!" She appeared to have forgotten that marriages are
made in heaven, or to disregard that saying. "The Lord helps those
that help themselves," was one of her favorite mottoes. "And much more
those that help other people!" she used to add.
</p><p>Flitting in and out of Dr. Hale's at all hours, she noted that he had
a fondness for music, with a phenomenal incapacity to produce any. He
encouraged his boys to play on any and every instrument the town
afforded, and to sing, whether they could or not; and seemed never to
weary of their attempts, though far from satisfied with the product.
</p><p>"Huh!" said Mrs. Pettigrew.
</p><p>Vivian could play, "Well enough to know better," she said, and seldom
touched the piano. She had a deep, full, contralto voice, and a fair
degree of training. But she would never make music unless she felt
like it--and in this busy life, with so many people about her, she had
always refused.
</p><p>Grandma meditated.
</p><p>She selected an evening when most of the boarders were out at some
entertainment, and selfishly begged Vivian to stay at home with
her--said she was feeling badly and wanted company. Grandma so seldom
wanted anything that Vivian readily acquiesced; in fact, she was quite
worried about her, and asked Dr. Bellair if she thought anything was
the matter.
</p><p>"She has seemed more quiet lately," said that astute lady, "and I've
noticed her going in to Dr. Hale's during office hours. But perhaps
it's only to visit with him."
</p><p>"Are you in any pain, Grandma?" asked the girl, affectionately.
"You're not sick, are you?"
</p><p>"O, no--I'm not sick," said the old lady, stoutly. "I'm just--well, I
felt sort of lonesome to-night--perhaps I'm homesick."
</p><p>As she had never shown the faintest sign of any feeling for their
deserted home, except caustic criticism and unfavorable comparison,
Vivian rather questioned this theory, but she began to think there was
something in it when her grandmother, sitting by the window in the
spring twilight, began to talk of how this time of year always made
her think of her girlhood.
</p><p>"Time for the March peepers at home. It's early here, and no peepers
anywhere that I've heard. 'Bout this time we'd be going to evening
meeting. Seems as if I could hear that little old organ--and the
singing!"
</p><p>"Hadn't I better shut that window," asked Vivian. "Won't you get cold?"
</p><p>"No, indeed," said her grandmother, promptly. "I'm plenty warm--I've
got this little shawl around me. And it's so soft and pleasant out."
</p><p>It was soft and pleasant, a delicious May-like night in March, full of
spring scents and hints of coming flowers. On the dark piazza across the
way she could make out a still figure sitting alone, and the thump of
Balzac's heel as he struggled with his intimate enemies told her who it
was.
</p><p>"Come Ye Disconsolate," she began to hum, most erroneously. "How does
that go, Vivian? I was always fond of it, even if I can't sing any
more'n a peacock."
</p><p>Vivian hummed it and gave the words in a low voice.
</p><p>"That's good!" said the old lady. "I declare, I'm kinder hungry for
some of those old hymns. I wish you'd play me some of 'em, Vivian."
</p><p>So Vivian, glad to please her, woke the yellow keys to softer music
than they were accustomed to, and presently her rich, low voice, sure,
easy, full of quiet feeling, flowed out on the soft night air.
</p><p>Grandma was not long content with the hymns. "I want some of those
old-fashioned songs--you used to know a lot of 'em. Can't you do that
'Kerry Dance' of Molloy's, and 'Twickenham Ferry'--and 'Lauriger
Horatius?'"
</p><p>Vivian gave her those, and many another, Scotch ballads, English songs
and German Lieder--glad to please her grandmother so easily, and quite
unconscious of a dark figure which had crossed the street and come
silently to sit on the farthest corner of their piazza.
</p><p>Grandma, meanwhile, watched him, and Vivian as well, and then, with the
most unsuspected suddenness, took to her bed. Sciatica, she said. An
intermittent pain that came upon her so suddenly she couldn't stand up.
She felt much better lying down. And Dr. Hale must attend her
unceasingly.
</p><p>This unlooked for overthrow of the phenomenally active old lady was a
great blow to Mr. Skee; he showed real concern and begged to be
allowed to see her.
</p><p>"Why not?" said Mrs. Pettigrew. "It's nothing catching."
</p><p>She lay, high-pillowed, as stiff and well arranged as a Knight Templar
on a tombstone, arrayed for the occasion in a most decorative little
dressing sack and ribbony night-cap.
</p><p>"Why, ma'am," said Mr. Skee, "it's highly becomin' to you to be sick.
It leads me to hope it's nothin' serious."
</p><p>She regarded him enigmatically. "Is Dr. Hale out there, or Vivian?"
she inquired in a low voice.
</p><p>"No, ma'am--they ain't," he replied, after a glance in the next room.
</p><p>Then he bent a penetrating eye upon her. She met it unflinchingly, but
as his smile appeared and grew, its limitless widening spread
contagion, and her calm front was broken.
</p><p>"Elmer Skee," said she, with sudden fury, "you hold your tongue!"
</p><p>"Ma'am!" he replied, "I have said nothin'--and I don't intend to. But
if the throne of Europe was occupied by you, Mrs. Pettigrew, we would
have a better managed world."
</p><p>He proved a most agreeable and steady visitor during this period of
confinement, and gave her full accounts of all that went on outside,
with occasional irrelevant bursts of merriment which no rebuke from
Mrs. Pettigrew seemed wholly to check.
</p><p>He regaled her with accounts of his continuous consultations with Mrs.
St. Cloud, and the wisdom and good taste with which she invariably
advised him.
</p><p>"Don't you admire a Platonic Friendship, Mrs. Pettigrew?"
</p><p>"I do not!" said the old lady, sharply. "And what's more I don't
believe you do."
</p><p>"Well, ma'am," he answered, swaying backward and forward on the hind
legs of his chair, "there are moments when I confess it looks
improbable."
</p><p>Mrs. Pettigrew cocked her head on one side and turned a gimlet eye
upon him. "Look here, Elmer Skee," she said suddenly, "how much money
have you really got?"
</p><p>He brought down his chair on four legs and regarded her for a few
moments, his smile widening slowly. "Well, ma'am, if I live through
the necessary expenses involved on my present undertaking, I shall
have about two thousand a year--if rents are steady."
</p><p>"Which I judge you do not wish to be known?"
</p><p>"If there's one thing more than another I have always admired in you,
ma'am, it is the excellence of your judgment. In it I have absolute
confidence."
</p><p>Mrs. St. Cloud had some time since summoned Dr. Hale to her side for a
severe headache, but he had merely sent word that his time was fully
occupied, and recommended Dr. Bellair.
</p><p>Now, observing Mrs. Pettigrew's tactics, the fair invalid resolved to
take the bull by the horns and go herself to his office. She found him
easily enough. He lifted his eyes as she entered, rose and stood with
folded arms regarding her silently. The tall, heavy figure, the full
beard, the glasses, confused even her excellent memory. After all it was
many years since they had met, and he had been but one of a multitude.
</p><p>She was all sweetness and gentle apology for forcing herself upon him,
but really she had a little prejudice against women doctors--his
reputation was so great--he was so temptingly near--she was in such
pain--she had such perfect confidence in him--
</p><p>He sat down quietly and listened, watching her from under his bent
brows. Her eyes were dropped, her voice very weak and appealing; her
words most perfectly chosen.
</p><p>"I have told you," he said at length, "that I never treat women for
their petty ailments, if I can avoid it."
</p><p>She shook her head in grieved acceptance, and lifted large eyes for
one of those penetrating sympathetic glances so frequently successful.
</p><p>"How you must have suffered!" she said.
</p><p>"I have," he replied grimly. "I have suffered a long time from having
my eyes opened too suddenly to the brainless cruelty of women, Mrs.
James."
</p><p>She looked at him again, searchingly, and gave a little cry. "Dick
Hale!" she said.
</p><p>"Yes, Dick Hale. Brother to poor little Joe Medway, whose foolish
young heart you broke, among others; whose death you are responsible
for."
</p><p>She was looking at him with widening wet eyes. "Ah! If you only knew
how I, too, have suffered over that!" she said. "I was scarce more
than a girl myself, then. I was careless, not heartless. No one knew
what pain I was bearing, then. I liked the admiration of those nice
boys--I never realized any of them would take it seriously. That has
been a heavy shadow on my life, Dr. Hale--the fear that I was the
thoughtless cause of that terrible thing. And you have never forgiven
me. I do not wonder."
</p><p>He was looking at her in grim silence again, wishing he had not
spoken.
</p><p>"So that is why you have never been to The Cottonwoods since I came,"
she pursued. "And I am responsible for all your loneliness. O, how
dreadful!"
</p><p>Again he rose to his feet.
</p><p>"No, madam, you mistake. You were responsible for my brother's death,
and for a bitter awakening on my part, but you are in no way
responsible for my attitude since. That is wholly due to myself. Allow
me again to recommend Dr. Jane Bellair, an excellent physician and
even more accessible."
</p><p>He held the door for her, and she went out, not wholly dissatisfied
with her visit. She would have been far more displeased could she have
followed his thoughts afterward.
</p><p>"What a Consummate Ass I have been all my life!" he was meditating.
"Because I met this particular type of sex parasite, to deliberately
go sour--and forego all chance of happiness. Like a silly girl. A
fool girl who says, 'I will never marry!' just because of some quarrel
* * * But the girl never keeps her word. A man must."
</p><p>The days were long to Vivian now, and dragged a little, for all her
industry.
</p><p>Mrs. St. Cloud tried to revive their former intimacy, but the girl could
not renew it on the same basis. She, too, had sympathized with Mr.
Dykeman, and now sympathized somewhat with Mr. Skee. But since that
worthy man still volubly discoursed on Platonism, and his fair friend
openly agreed in this view, there seemed no real ground for distress.
</p><p>Mrs. Pettigrew remained ailing and rather captious. She had a
telephone put at her bedside, and ran her household affairs
efficiently, with Vivian as lieutenant, and the ever-faithful Jeanne
to uphold the honor of the cuisine. Also she could consult her
physician, and demanded his presence at all hours.
</p><p>He openly ignored Mrs. St. Cloud now, who met his rude treatment with
secret, uncomplaining patience.
</p><p>Vivian spoke of this. "I do not see why he need be so rude, Grandma. He
may hate women, but I don't see why he should treat her so shamefully."
</p><p>"Well, I do," replied the invalid, "and what's more I'm going to show
you; I've always disliked that woman, and now I know why. I'd turn
her out of the house if it wasn't for Elmer Skee. That man's as good
as gold under all his foolishness, and if he can get any satisfaction
out of that meringue he's welcome. Dr. Hale doesn't hate women, child,
but a woman broke his heart once--and then he made an idiot of himself
by vowing never to marry."
</p><p>She showed her friend's letter, and Vivian read it with rising color.
"O, Grandma! Why that's worse than I ever thought--even after what Dr.
Bellair told us. And it was his brother! No wonder he's so fond of
boys. He tries to warn them, I suppose."
</p><p>"Yes, and the worst of it is that he's really got over his grouch; and
he's in love--but tied down by that foolish oath, poor man."
</p><p>"Is he, Grandma? How do you know? With whom?"
</p><p>"You dear, blind child!" said the old lady, "with you, of course. Has
been ever since we came."
</p><p>The girl sat silent, a strange feeling of joy rising in her heart, as
she reviewed the events of the last two years. So that was why he
would not stay that night. And that was why. "No wonder he wouldn't
come here!" she said at length. "It's on account of that woman. But
why did he change?"
</p><p>"Because she went over there to see him. He wouldn't come to her. I
heard her 'phone to him one evening." The old lady chuckled. "So she
marched herself over there--I saw her, and I guess she got her
needin's. She didn't stay long. And his light burned till morning."
</p><p>"Do you think he cares for her, still?"
</p><p>"Cares for her!" The old lady fairly snorted her derision. "He can't
bear the sight of her--treats her as if she wasn't there. No, indeed.
If he did she'd have him fast enough, now. Well! I suppose he'll
repent of that foolishness of his all the days of his life--and stick
it out! Poor man."
</p><p>Mrs. Pettigrew sighed, and Vivian echoed the sigh. She began to
observe Dr. Hale with new eyes; to study little matters of tone and
manner--and could not deny her grandmother's statement. Nor would she
admit it--yet.
</p><p>The old lady seemed weaker and more irritable, but positively forbade
any word of this being sent to her family.
</p><p>"There's nothing on earth ails me," she said. "Dr. Hale says there's
not a thing the matter that he can see--that if I'd only eat more I'd
get stronger. I'll be all right soon, my dear. I'll get my appetite
and get well, I have faith to believe."
</p><p>She insisted on his coming over in the evening, when not too busy, and
staying till she dropped asleep, and he seemed strangely willing to
humor her; sitting for hours in the quiet parlor, while Vivian played
softly, and sang her low-toned hymns.
</p><p>So sitting, one still evening, when for some time no fretful "not so
loud" had come from the next room, he turned suddenly to Vivian and
asked, almost roughly--"Do you hold a promise binding?--an oath, a
vow--to oneself?"
</p><p>She met his eyes, saw the deep pain there, the long combat, the
irrepressible hope and longing.
</p><p>"Did you swear to keep your oath secret?" she asked.
</p><p>"Why, no," he said, "I did not. I will tell you. I did not swear never
to tell a woman I loved her. I never dreamed I should love again.
Vivian, I was fool enough to love a shallow, cruel woman, once, and
nearly broke my heart in consequence. That was long years ago. I have
never cared for a woman since--till I met you. And now I must pay
double for that boy folly."
</p><p>He came to her and took her hand.
</p><p>"I love you," he said, his tense grip hurting her. "I shall love you as
long as I live--day and night--forever! You shall know that at any
rate!"
</p><p>She could not raise her eyes. A rich bright color rose to the soft
border of her hair. He caught her face in his hands and made her look
at him; saw those dark, brilliant eyes softened, tear-filled, asking,
and turned sharply away with a muffled cry.
</p><p>"I have taken a solemn oath," he said in a strained, hard voice,
"never to ask a woman to marry me."
</p><p>He heard a little gasping laugh, and turned upon her. She stood there
smiling, her hands reached out to him.
</p><p>"You don't have to," she said.
</p><hr/>
<p>A long time later, upon their happy stillness broke a faint voice from
the other room:
</p><p>"Vivian, I think if you'd bring me some bread and butter--and a cup of
tea--and some cold beef and a piece of pie--I could eat it."
</p><hr/>
<p>Upon the rapid and complete recovery of her grandmother's health, and
the announcement of Vivian's engagement, Mr. and Mrs. Lane decided to
make a visit to their distant mother and daughter, hoping as well that
Mr. Lane's cough might be better for a visit in that altitude. Mr. and
Mrs. Dykeman also sent word of their immediate return.
</p><p>Jeanne, using subtle powers of suggestion, caused Mrs. Pettigrew to
decide upon giving a dinner, in honor of these events. There was the
betrothed couple, there were the honored guests; there were Jimmie and
Susie, with or without the baby; there were the Dykemans; there was
Dr. Bellair, of course; there was Mr. Skee, an even number.
</p><p>"I'm sorry to spoil that table, but I've got to take in Mrs. St.
Cloud," said the old lady.
</p><p>"O, Grandma! Why! It'll spoil it for Dick."
</p><p>"Huh!" said her grandmother. "He's so happy you couldn't spoil it with
a mummy. If I don't ask her it'll spoil it for Mr. Skee."
</p><p>So Mrs. St. Cloud made an eleventh at the feast, and neither Mr.
Dykeman nor Vivian could find it in their happy hearts to care.
</p><p>Mr. Skee arose, looking unusually tall and shapely in immaculate
every-day dress, his well-brushed hair curling vigorously around the
little bald spots; his smile wide and benevolent.
</p><p>"Ladies and Gentlemen, both Domestic and Foreign, Friends and
Fellowtownsmen and Women--Ladies, God Bless 'em; also Children, if
any: I feel friendly enough to-night to include the beasts of the
fields--but such would be inappropriate at this convivial board--among
these convivial boarders.
</p><p>"This is an occasion of great rejoicing. We have many things to
rejoice over, both great <u>and</u> small. We have our healths; all of us,
apparently. We are experiencing the joys of reunion--in the matter of
visiting parents that is, and long absent daughters.
</p><p>"We have also the Return of the Native, in the shape of my old friend
Andy--now become a Benedict--and seeming to enjoy it. About this same
Andy I have a piece of news to give you which will cause you
astonishment and gratification, but which involves me in a profuse
apology--a most sincere and general apology.
</p><p>"You know how a year or more ago it was put about in this town that
Andrew Dykeman was a ruined man?" Mrs. St. Cloud darted a swift glance
at Mr. Dykeman, but his eyes rested calmly on his wife; then at Mr.
Skee--but he was pursuing his remorseful way.
</p><p>"I do not wish to blame my friend Andy for his reticence--but he
certainly did exhibit reticence on this occasion--to beat the band! He
never contradicted this rumor--not once. <u>He</u> just went about looking
kind o' down in the mouth for some reason or other, and when for the
sake o' Auld Lang Syne I offered him a job in my office--the cuss took
it! I won't call this deceitful, but it sure was reticent to a degree.
</p><p>"Well, Ladies--and Gentlemen--the best of us are liable to mistakes,
and I have to admit--I am glad to humble myself and make this public
admission--I was entirely in error in this matter.
</p><p>"It wasn't so. There was nothing in it. It was rumor, pure and simple.
Andy Dykeman never lost no mine, it appears; or else he had another up
his sleeve concealed from his best friends. Anyhow, the facts are
these; not only that A. Dykeman as he sits before you is a prosperous
and wealthy citizen, but that he has been, for these ten years back,
and we were all misled by a mixture of rumor and reticence. If he has
concealed these facts from the wife of his bosom I submit that that is
carrying reticence too far!" Again Mrs. St. Cloud sent a swift glance
at the reticent one, and again caught only his tender apologetic look
toward his wife, and her utter amazement.
</p><p>Mr. Dykeman rose to his feet.
</p><p>"I make no apologies for interrupting my friend," he said. "It is
necessary at times. He at least can never be accused of reticence.
Neither do I make apologies for letting rumor take its course--a
course often interesting to observe. But I do apologize--in this
heartfelt and public manner, to my wife, for marrying her under false
pretenses. But any of you gentlemen who have ever had any experience
in the attitude of," he hesitated mercifully, and said, "the World,
toward a man with money, may understand what it meant to me, after
many years of bachelorhood, to find a heart that not only loved me for
myself alone, but absolutely loved me better because I'd lost my
money--or she thought I had. I have hated to break the charm. But now
my unreticent friend here has stated the facts, and I make my
confession. Will you forgive me, Orella?"
</p><p>"Speech! Speech!" cried Mr. Skee. But Mrs. Dykeman could not be
persuaded to do anything but blush and smile and squeeze her husband's
hand under the table, and Mr. Skee arose once more.
</p><p>"This revelation being accomplished," he continued cheerfully; "and no
one any the worse for it, as I see," he was not looking in the
direction of Mrs. St. Cloud, whose slippered foot beat softly under
the table, though her face wore its usual sweet expression, possibly a
trifle strained; "I now proceed to a proclamation of that happy event
to celebrate which we are here gathered together. I allude to the
Betrothal of Our Esteemed Friend, Dr. Richard Hale, and the Fairest of
the Fair! Regarding the Fair, we think he has chosen well. But
regarding Dick Hale, his good fortune is so clear, so evidently
undeserved, and his pride and enjoyment thereof so ostentatious, as to
leave us some leeway to make remarks.
</p><p>"Natural remarks, irresistible remarks, as you might say, and not
intended to be acrimonious. Namely, such as these: It's a long lane
that has no turning; There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip;
The worm will turn; The pitcher that goes too often to the well gets
broken at last; Better Late than Never. And so on and so forth. Any
other gentleman like to make remarks on this topic?"
</p><p>Dr. Hale rose, towering to his feet.
</p><p>"I think I'd better make them," he said. "No one else could so fully,
so heartily, with such perfect knowledge point out how many kinds of a
fool I've been for all these years. And yet of them all there are only
two that I regret--this last two in which if I had been wiser, perhaps
I might have found my happiness sooner. As that cannot be proven,
however, I will content myself with the general acknowledgment that
Bachelors are Misguided Bats, I myself having long been the worst
instance; women, in general, are to be loved and honored; and that I
am proud and glad to accept your congratulations because the sweetest
and noblest woman in the world has honored me with her love."
</p><p>"I never dreamed you could put so many words together, Doc--and really
make sense!" said Mr. Skee, genially, as he rose once more. "You
certainly show a proper spirit at last, and all is forgiven. But now,
my friends; now if your attention is not exhausted, I have yet another
Event to confide to you."
</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Lane wore an aspect of polite interest. Susie and Jim
looked at each other with a sad but resigned expression. So did Mrs.
Dykeman and her husband. Vivian's hand was in her lover's and she
could not look unhappy, but they, too, deprecated this last
announcement, only too well anticipated. Only Mrs. St. Cloud, her fair
face bowed in gentle confusion, showed anticipating pleasure.
</p><p>Mr. Skee waved his hand toward her with a large and graceful gesture.
</p><p>"You must all of you have noticed the amount of Platonic Friendship
which has been going on for some time between my undeserving self and
this lovely lady here. Among so many lovely ladies perhaps I'd better
specify that I refer to the one on my left.
</p><p>"What she has been to me, in my lonely old age, none of you perhaps
realize." He wore an expression as of one long exiled, knowing no one
who could speak his language.
</p><p>"She has been my guide, counsellor and friend; she has assisted me
with advice most wise and judicious; she has not interfered with my
habits, but has allowed me to enjoy life in my own way, with the
added attraction of her companionship.
</p><p>"Now, I dare say, there may have been some of you who have questioned
my assertion that this friendship was purely Platonic. Perhaps even
the lady herself, knowing the heart of man, may have doubted if my
feeling toward her was really friendship."
</p><p>Mr. Skee turned his head a little to one side and regarded her with a
tender inquiring smile.
</p><p>To this she responded sweetly: "Why no, Mr. Skee, of course, I
believed what you said."
</p><p>"There, now," said he, admiringly. "What is so noble as the soul of
woman? It is to this noble soul in particular, and to all my friends
here in general, that I now confide the crowning glory of a long and
checkered career, namely, and to wit, that I am engaged to be married
to that Peerless Lady, Mrs. Servilla Pettigrew, of whose remarkable
capacities and achievements I can never sufficiently express my
admiration."
</p><p>A silence fell upon the table. Mr. Skee sat down smiling, evidently in
cheerful expectation of congratulations. Mrs. Pettigrew wore an alert
expression, as of a skilled fencer preparing to turn any offered
thrusts. Mrs. St. Cloud seemed to be struggling with some emotion,
which shook her usual sweet serenity. The others, too, were visibly
affected, and not quick to respond.

and pour forth good-humored nonsense with congratulations all around,
till a pleasant atmosphere was established, in which Mrs. St. Cloud
could so far recover as to say many proper and pretty things; sadly
adding that she regretted her imminent return to the East would end so
many pleasant friendships.
