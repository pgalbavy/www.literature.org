<P>On the same evening Gryphus, as he brought the prisoner his 
mess, slipped on the damp flags whilst opening the door of 
the cell, and fell, in the attempt to steady himself, on his 
hand; but as it was turned the wrong way, he broke his arm 
just above the wrist.</P>
<P>Cornelius rushed forward towards the jailer, but Gryphus, 
who was not yet aware of the serious nature of his injury, 
called out to him,  - </P>
<P>&quot;It is nothing: don't you stir.&quot;</P>
<P>He then tried to support himself on his arm, but the bone 
gave way; then only he felt the pain, and uttered a cry.</P>
<P>When he became aware that his arm was broken, this man, so 
harsh to others, fell swooning on the threshold, where he 
remained motionless and cold, as if dead.</P>
<P>During all this time the door of the cell stood open and 
Cornelius found himself almost free. But the thought never 
entered his mind of profiting by this accident; he had seen 
from the manner in which the arm was bent, and from the 
noise it made in bending, that the bone was fractured, and 
that the patient must be in great pain; and now he thought 
of nothing else but of administering relief to the sufferer, 
however little benevolent the man had shown himself during 
their short interview.</P>
<P>At the noise of Gryphus's fall, and at the cry which escaped 
him, a hasty step was heard on the staircase, and 
immediately after a lovely apparition presented itself to 
the eyes of Cornelius.</P>
<P>It was the beautiful young Frisian, who, seeing her father 
stretched on the ground, and the prisoner bending over him, 
uttered a faint cry, as in the first fright she thought 
Gryphus, whose brutality she well knew, had fallen in 
consequence of a struggle between him and the prisoner.</P>
<P>Cornelius understood what was passing in the mind of the 
girl, at the very moment when the suspicion arose in her 
heart.</P>
<P>But one moment told her the true state of the case and, 
ashamed of her first thoughts, she cast her beautiful eyes, 
wet with tears, on the young man, and said to him,  - </P>
<P>&quot;I beg your pardon, and thank you, sir; the first for what I 
have thought, and the second for what you are doing.&quot;</P>
<P>Cornelius blushed, and said, &quot;I am but doing my duty as a 
Christian in helping my neighbour.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, and affording him your help this evening, you have 
forgotten the abuse which he heaped on you this morning. Oh, 
sir! this is more than humanity,  -  this is indeed Christian 
charity.&quot;</P>
<P>Cornelius cast his eyes on the beautiful girl, quite 
astonished to hear from the mouth of one so humble such a 
noble and feeling speech.</P>
<P>But he had no time to express his surprise. Gryphus 
recovered from his swoon, opened his eyes, and as his 
brutality was returning with his senses, he growled &quot;That's 
it, a fellow is in a hurry to bring to a prisoner his 
supper, and falls and breaks his arm, and is left lying on 
the ground.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hush, my father,&quot; said Rosa, &quot;you are unjust to this 
gentleman, whom I found endeavouring to give you his aid.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;His aid?&quot; Gryphus replied, with a doubtful air.</P>
<P>&quot;It is quite true, master! I am quite ready to help you 
still more.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You!&quot; said Gryphus, &quot;are you a medical man?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It was formerly my profession.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And so you would be able to set my arm?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Perfectly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And what would you need to do it? let us hear.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Two splinters of wood, and some linen for a bandage.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you hear, Rosa?&quot; said Gryphus, &quot;the prisoner is going to 
set my arm, that's a saving; come, assist me to get up, I 
feel as heavy as lead.&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa lent the sufferer her shoulder; he put his unhurt arm 
around her neck, and making an effort, got on his legs, 
whilst Cornelius, to save him a walk, pushed a chair towards 
him.</P>
<P>Gryphus sat down; then, turning towards his daughter, he 
said,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Well, didn't you hear? go and fetch what is wanted.&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa went down, and immediately after returned with two 
staves of a small barrel and a large roll of linen bandage.</P>
<P>Cornelius had made use of the intervening moments to take 
off the man's coat, and to tuck up his shirt sleeve.</P>
<P>&quot;Is this what you require, sir?&quot; asked Rosa.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, mademoiselle,&quot; answered Cornelius, looking at the 
things she had brought,  -  &quot;yes, that's right. Now push this 
table, whilst I support the arm of your father.&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa pushed the table, Cornelius placed the broken arm on it 
so as to make it flat, and with perfect skill set the bone, 
adjusted the splinters, and fastened the bandages.</P>
<P>At the last touch, the jailer fainted a second time.</P>
<P>&quot;Go and fetch vinegar, mademoiselle,&quot; said Cornelius; &quot;we 
will bathe his temples, and he will recover.&quot;</P>
<P>But, instead of acting up to the doctor's prescription, 
Rosa, after having satisfied herself that her father was 
still unconscious, approached Cornelius and said,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Service for service, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you mean, my pretty child?&quot; said Cornelius.</P>
<P>&quot;I mean to say, sir, that the judge who is to examine you 
to-morrow has inquired to-day for the room in which you are 
confined, and, on being told that you are occupying the cell 
of Mynheer Cornelius de Witt, laughed in a very strange and 
very disagreeable manner, which makes me fear that no good 
awaits you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; asked Cornelius, &quot;what harm can they do to me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Look at that gibbet.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But I am not guilty,&quot; said Cornelius.</P>
<P>&quot;Were they guilty whom you see down there gibbeted, mangled, 
and torn to pieces?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's true,&quot; said Cornelius, gravely.</P>
<P>&quot;And besides,&quot; continued Rosa, &quot;the people want to find you 
guilty. But whether innocent or guilty, your trial begins 
to-morrow, and the day after you will be condemned. Matters 
are settled very quickly in these times.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, and what do you conclude from all this?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I conclude that I am alone, that I am weak, that my father 
is lying in a swoon, that the dog is muzzled, and that 
consequently there is nothing to prevent your making your 
escape. Fly, then; that's what I mean.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you say?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I say that I was not able to save Mynheer Cornelius or 
Mynheer John de Witt, and that I should like to save you. 
Only be quick; there, my father is regaining his breath, one 
minute more, and he will open his eyes, and it will be too 
late. Do you hesitate?&quot;</P>
<P>In fact, Cornelius stood immovable, looking at Rosa, yet 
looking at her as if he did not hear her.</P>
<P>&quot;Don't you understand me?&quot; said the young girl, with some 
impatience.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; said Cornelius, &quot;but  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will not, they would accuse you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Never mind,&quot; said Rosa, blushing, &quot;never mind that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are very good, my dear child,&quot; replied Cornelius, &quot;but 
I stay.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You stay, oh, sir! oh, sir! don't you understand that you 
will be condemned to death, executed on the scaffold, 
perhaps assassinated and torn to pieces, just like Mynheer 
John and Mynheer Cornelius. For heaven's sake, don't think 
of me, but fly from this place, Take care, it bears ill luck 
to the De Witts!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Halloa!&quot; cried the jailer, recovering his senses, &quot;who is 
talking of those rogues, those wretches, those villains, the 
De Witts?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't be angry, my good man,&quot; said Cornelius, with his 
good-tempered smile, &quot;the worst thing for a fracture is 
excitement, by which the blood is heated.&quot;</P>
<P>Thereupon, he said in an undertone to Rosa  - </P>
<P>&quot;My child, I am innocent, and I shall await my trial with 
tranquillity and an easy mind.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hush,&quot; said Rosa.</P>
<P>&quot;Why hush?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My father must not suppose that we have been talking to 
each other.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What harm would that do?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What harm? He would never allow me to come here any more,&quot; 
said Rosa.</P>
<P>Cornelius received this innocent confidence with a smile; he 
felt as if a ray of good fortune were shining on his path.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, then, what are you chattering there together about?&quot; 
said Gryphus, rising and supporting his right arm with his 
left.</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing,&quot; said Rosa; &quot;the doctor is explaining to me what 
diet you are to keep.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Diet, diet for me? Well, my fine girl, I shall put you on 
diet too.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On what diet, my father?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Never to go to the cells of the prisoners, and, if ever you 
should happen to go, to leave them as soon as possible. 
Come, off with me, lead the way, and be quick.&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa and Cornelius exchanged glances.</P>
<P>That of Rosa tried to express,  - </P>
<P>&quot;There, you see?&quot;</P>
<P>That of Cornelius said,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Let it be as the Lord wills.&quot; </P></div>
