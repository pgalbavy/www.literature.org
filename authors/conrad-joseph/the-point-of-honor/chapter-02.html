<p>He succeeded in this object no better than the rest of the garrison
and the whole of society. The two young officers, of no especial
consequence till then, became distinguished by the universal curiosity
as to the origin of their quarrel. Madame de Lionne's salon was
the centre of ingenious surmises; that lady herself was for a
time assailed with inquiries as the last person known to have
spoken to these unhappy and reckless young men before they went
out together from her house to a savage encounter with swords,
at dusk, in a private garden. She protested she had noticed nothing
unusual in their demeanour. Lieutenant Feraud had been visibly
annoyed at being called away. That was natural enough; no man
likes to be disturbed in a conversation with a lady famed for
her elegance and sensibility» But, in truth, the subject bored
Madame de Lionne since her personality could by no stretch of
imagination be connected with this affair. And it irritated her
to hear it advanced that there might have been some woman in the
case. This irritation arose, not from her elegance or sensibility,
but from a more instinctive side of her nature. It became so great
at last that she peremptorily forbade the subject to be mentioned
under her roof. Near her couch the prohibition was obeyed, but
farther off in the salon the pall of the imposed silence continued
to be lifted more or less. A diplomatic personage with a long
pale face resembling the countenance of a sheep, opined, shaking
his head, that it was a quarrel of long standing envenomed by
time. It was objected to him that the men themselves were too
young for such a theory to fit their proceedings. They belonged
also to different and distant parts of France. A subcommissary
of the Intendence, an agreeable and cultivated bachelor in keysermere
breeches, Hessian boots and a blue coat embroidered with silver
lace, who affected to believe in the transmigration of souls,
suggested that the two had met perhaps in some previous existence.
The feud was in the forgotten past. It might have been something
quite inconceivable in the present state of their being; but their
souls remembered the animosity and manifested an instinctive antagonism.
He developed his theme jocularly. Yet the affair was so absurd
from the worldly, the military, the honourable, or the prudential
point of view, that this weird explanation seemed rather more
reasonable than any other.</p>

<p>The two officers had confided nothing definite to any one. Resentment,
humiliation at having been worsted arms in hand, and an uneasy
feeling of having been involved into a scrape by the injustice
of fate, kept Lieutenant Feraud savagely dumb. He mistrusted the
sympathy of mankind. That would of course go to that dandified
staff officer. Lying in bed he raved to himself in his mind or
aloud to the pretty maid who ministered to his needs with devotion
and listened to his horrible imprecations with alarm. That Lieutenant
D'Hubert should be made to "pay for it,"  whatever it was, seemed
to her just and natural. Her principal concern was that Lieutenant
Feraud should not excite himself. He appeared so wholly admirable
and fascinating to the humility of her heart that her only concern
was to see him get well quickly even if it were only to resume
his visits to Madame de Lionne's salon.</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Hubert kept silent for the immediate reason that
there was no one except a stupid young soldier servant to speak
to. But he was not anxious for the opportunities of which his
severe arrest deprived him. He would have been uncommunicative
from dread of ridicule. He was aware that the episode, so grave
professionally, had its comic side. When reflecting upon it he
still felt that he would like to wring Lieutenant Feraud's neck
for him. But this formula was figurative rather than precise,
and expressed more a state of mind than an actual physical impulse.
At the same time there was in that young man a feeling of comradeship
and kindness which made him unwilling to make the position of
Lieutenant Feraud worse than it was.</p>

<p>He did not want to talk at large about this wretched affair.
At the inquiry he would have, of course, to speak the truth in
self-defence. This prospect vexed him.</p>

<p>But no inquiry took place. The army took the field instead. Lieutenant
D'Hubert, liberated without remark, returned to his regimental
duties, and Lieutenant Feraud, his arm still in a sling, rode
unquestioned with his squadron to complete his convalescence in
the smoke of battlefields and the fresh air of night bivouacs.
This bracing treatment suited his case so well that at the first
rumour of an armistice being signed he could turn without misgivings
to the prosecution of his private warfare.</p>

<p>This time it was to be regular warfare. He dispatched two friends
to Lieutenant D'Hubert, whose regiment was stationed only a few
miles away. Those friends had asked no questions of their principal.
"I must pay him off, that pretty staff officer," he had said grimly,
and they went away quite contentedly on their mission. Lieutenant
D'Hubert had no difficulty in finding two friends equally discreet
and devoted to their principal. "There's a sort of crazy fellow
to whom I must give another lesson," he had curtly declared, and
they asked for no better reasons.</p>

<p>On these grounds an encounter with duelling swords was arranged
one early morning in a convenient field. At the third set-to,
Lieutenant D'Hubert found himself lying on his back on the dewy
grass, with a hole in his side. A serene sun, rising over a German
landscape of meadows and wooded hills, hung on his left. A surgeon&mdash;not
the flute-player but another&mdash;was bending over him, feeling around
the wound.</p>

<p>"Narrow squeak. But it will be nothing," he pronounced.</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Hubert heard these words with pleasure. One of his
seconds&mdash;the one who, sitting on the wet grass, was sustaining
his head on his lap-said:</p>

<p>"The fortune of war, <em>mon pauvre vieux</em>. What will you
have? You had better make it up, like two good fellows. Do!"</p>

<p>"You don't know what you ask," murmured Lieutenant D'Hubert in
a feeble voice. "However, if he..."</p>

<p>In another part of the meadow the seconds of Lieutenant Feraud
were urging him to go over and shake hands with his adversary.</p>

<p>"You have paid him off now&mdash;<em>que diable</em>. It's the proper
thing to do. This D'Hubert is a decent fellow."</p>

<p>"I know the decency of these generals' pets," muttered Lieutenant
Feraud through his teeth for all answer. The sombre expression
of his face discouraged further efforts at reconciliation. The
seconds, bowing from a distance, took their men off the field.
In the afternoon, Lieutenant D'Hubert, very popular as a good
comrade uniting great bravery with a frank and equable temper,
had many visitors. It was remarked that Lieutenant Feraud did
not, as customary, show himself much abroad to receive the felicitations
of his friends. They would not have failed him, because he, too,
was liked for the exuberance of his southern nature and the simplicity
of his character. In all the places where officers were in the
habit of assembling at the end of the day the duel of the morning
was talked over from every point of view. Though Lieutenant D'Hubert
had got worsted this time, his sword-play was commended. No one
could deny that it was very close, very scientific. If he got
touched, some said, it was because he wished to spare his adversary.
But by many the vigour and dash of Lieutenant Feraud's attack
were pronounced irresistible.</p>

<p>The merits of the two officers as combatants were frankly discussed;
but their attitude to each other after the duel was criticised
lightly and with caution. It was irreconcilable, and that was
to be regretted. After all, they knew best what the care of their
honour dictated. It was not a matter for their comrades to pry
into overmuch. As to the origin of the quarrel, the general impression
was that it dated from the time they were holding garrison in
Strasburg. Only the musical surgeon shook his head at that. It
went much farther back, he hinted discreetly.</p>

<p>"Why! You must know the whole story," cried several voices, eager
with curiosity. "You were there! What was it?"</p>

<p>He raised his eyes from his glass deliberately and said:</p>

<p>"Even if I knew ever so well, you can't expect me to tell you,
since both the principals choose to say nothing."</p>

<p>He got up and went out, leaving the sense of mystery behind him.
He could not stay longer because the witching hour of flute-playing
was drawing near. After he had gone a very young officer observed
solemnly:</p>

<p>"Obviously! His lips are sealed."</p>

<p>Nobody questioned the high propriety of that remark. Somehow
it added to the impressiveness of the affair. Several older officers
of both regiments, prompted by nothing but sheer kindness and
love of harmony, proposed to form a Court of Honour to which the
two officers would leave the task of their reconciliation. Unfortunately,
they began by approaching Lieutenant Feraud. The assumption was,
that having just scored heavily, he would be found placable and
disposed to moderation.</p>

<p>The reasoning was sound enough; nevertheless, the move turned
out unfortunate. In that relaxation of moral fibre which is brought
about by the ease of soothed vanity, Lieutenant Feraud had condescended
in the secret of his heart to review the case, and even to doubt
not the justice of his cause, but the absolute sagacity of his
conduct. This being so, he was disinclined to talk about it. The
suggestion of the regimental wise men put him in a difficult position.
He was disgusted, and this disgust by a sort of paradoxical logic
reawakened his animosity against Lieutenant D'Hubert. Was he to
be pestered with this fellow for ever&mdash;the fellow who had an infernal
knack of getting round people somehow? On the other hand, it was
difficult to refuse point-blank that sort of mediation sanctioned
by the code of honour.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Feraud met the difficulty by an attitude of fierce
reserve. He twisted his moustache and used vague words. His case
was perfectly clear. He was not ashamed to present it, neither
was he afraid to defend it personally. He did not see any reason
to jump at the suggestion before ascertaining how his adversary
was likely to take it.</p>

<p>Later in the day, his exasperation growing upon him, he was heard
in a public place saying sardonically "that it would be the very
luckiest thing for Lieutenant D'Hubert, since next time of meeting
he need not hope to get off with a mere trifle of three weeks
in bed."</p>

<p>This boastful phrase might have been prompted by the most profound
Machiavelism. Southern natures often hide under the outward impulsiveness
of action and speech a certain amount of astuteness.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Feraud, mistrusting the justice of men, by no means
desired a Court of Honour. And these words, according so well
with his temperament, had also the merit of serving his turn.
Whether meant for that purpose or not, they found their way in
less than four-and-twenty hours into Lieutenant D'Hubert's bedroom.
In consequence, Lieutenant D'Hubert, sitting propped up with pillows,
received the overtures made to him next day by the statement that
the affair was of a nature which could not bear discussion.</p>

<p>The pale face of the wounded officer, his weak voice which he
had yet to use cautiously, and the courteous dignity of his tone,
had a great effect on his hearers. Reported outside, all this
did more for deepening the mystery than the vapourings of Lieutenant
Feraud. This last was greatly relieved at the issue. He began
to enjoy the state of general wonder, and was pleased to add to
it by assuming an attitude of moody reserve.</p>

<p>The colonel of Lieutenant D'Hubert's regiment was a gray-haired,
weather-beaten warrior who took a simple view of his responsibilities.
"I can't"&mdash;he thought to himself&mdash;"let the best of my subalterns
get damaged like this for nothing. I must get to the bottom of
this affair privately. He must speak out, if the devil were in
it. The colonel should be more than a father to these youngsters."
And, indeed, he loved all his men with as much affection as a
father of a large family can feel for every individual member
of it. If human beings by an oversight of Providence came into
the world in the state of civilians, they were born again into
a regiment as infants are born into a family, and it was that
military birth alone which really counted.</p>

<p>At the sight of Lieutenant D'Hubert standing before him bleached
and hollow-eyed, the heart of the old warrior was touched with
genuine compassion. All his affection for the regiment&mdash;that body
of men which he held in his hand to launch forward and draw back,
who had given him his rank, ministered to his pride and commanded
his thoughts&mdash;seemed centred for a moment on the person of the
most promising subaltern. He cleared his throat in a threatening
manner and frowned terribly.</p>

<p>"You must understand," he began, "that I don't care a rap for
the life of a single man in the regiment. You know that I would
send the 748 of you men and horses galloping into the pit of perdition
with no more compunction than I would kill a fly."</p>

<p>"Yes, colonel. You would be riding at our head," said Lieutenant
D'Hubert with a wan smile.</p>

<p>The colonel, who felt the need of being very diplomatic, fairly
roared at this.</p>

<p>"I want you to know, Lieutenant D'Hubert, that I could stand
aside and see you all riding to Hades, if need be. I am a man
to do even that, if the good of the service and my duty to my
country required it from me. But that's unthinkable, so don't
you even hint at such a thing."</p>

<p>He glared awfully, but his voice became gentle. "There's some
milk yet about that moustache of yours, my boy. You don't know
what a man like me is capable of. I would hide behind a haystack
if... Don't grin at me, sir. How dare you? If this were not a
private conversation, I would... Look here. I am responsible for
the proper expenditure of lives under my command for the glory
of our country and the honour of the regiment. Do you understand
that? Well, then, what the devil do you mean by letting yourself
be spitted like this by that fellow of the Seventh Hussars? It's
simply disgraceful!"</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Hubert, who expected another sort of conclusion,
felt vexed beyond measure. His shoulders moved slightly. He made
no other answer. He could not ignore his responsibility. The colonel
softened his glance and lowered his voice.</p>

<p>"It's deplorable," he murmured. And again he changed his tone.
"Come,"  he went on persuasively, but with that note of authority
which dwells in the throat of a good leader of men, "this affair
must be settled. I desire to be told plainly what it is all about.
I demand, as your best friend, to know."</p>

<p>The compelling power of authority, the softening influence of
the kindness affected deeply a man just risen from a bed of sickness.
Lieutenant D'Hubert's hand, which grasped the knob of a stick,
trembled slightly. But his northern temperament, sentimental but
cautious and clear-sighted, too, in its idealistic way, predominated
over his impulse to make a clean breast of the whole deadly absurdity.
According to the precept of transcendental wisdom, he turned his
tongue seven times in his mouth before he spoke. He made then
only a speech of thanks, nothing more. The colonel listened interested
at first, then looked mystified. At last he frowned.</p>

<p>"You hesitate&mdash;<em>mille tonerres!</em> Haven't I told you that
I will condescend to argue with you&mdash;as a friend?"</p>

<p>"Yes, colonel," answered Lieutenant D'Hubert softly, "but I am
afraid that after you have heard me out as a friend, you will
take action as my superior officer."</p>

<p>The attentive colonel snapped his jaws.</p>

<p>"Well, what of that?" he said frankly. "Is it so damnably disgraceful?"</p>

<p>"It is not," negatived Lieutenant D'Hubert in a faint but resolute
voice.</p>

<p>"Of course I shall act for the good of the service&mdash;nothing can
prevent me doing that. What do you think I want to be told for?"</p>

<p>"I know it is not from idle curiosity," tested Lieutenant D'Hubert.
"I know you will act wisely. But what about the good fame of the
regiment?"</p>

<p>"It cannot be affected by any youthful folly of a lieutenant,"
the colonel said severely.</p>

<p>"No, it cannot be; but it can be by evil tongues. It will be
said that a lieutenant of the Fourth Hussars, afraid of meeting
his adversary, is hiding behind his colonel. And that would be
worse than hiding behind a haystack&mdash;for the good of the service.
I cannot afford to do that, colonel."</p>

<p>"Nobody would dare to say anything of the kind," the colonel,
beginning very fiercely, ended on an uncertain note. The bravery
of Lieutenant D'Hubert was well known; but the colonel was well
aware that the duelling courage, the single combat courage, is,
rightly or wrongly, supposed to be courage of a special sort;
and it was eminently necessary that an officer of his regiment
should possess every kind of courage&mdash;and prove it, too. The colonel
stuck out his lower lip and looked far away with a peculiar glazed
stare. This was the expression of his perplexity, an expression
practically unknown to his regiment, for perplexity is a sentiment
which is incompatible with the rank of colonel of cavalry. The
colonel himself was overcome by the unpleasant novelty of the
sensation. As he was not accustomed to think except on professional
matters connected with the welfare of men and horses and the proper
use thereof on the field of glory, his intellectual efforts degenerated
into mere mental repetitions of profane language. "<em>Mille tonerres!...
Sacré nom de nom...</em>" he thought.</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Hubert coughed painfully and went on, in a weary
voice:</p>

<p>"There will be plenty of evil tongues to say that I've been cowed.
And I am sure you will not expect me to pass that sort of thing
over. I may find myself suddenly with a dozen duels on my hands
instead of this one affair."</p>

<p>The direct simplicity of this argument came home to the colonel's
understanding. He looked at his subordinate fixedly.</p>

<p>"Sit down, lieutenant," he said gruffly. "This is the very devil
of a... sit down."</p>

<p>"<em>Mon colonel</em>" D'Hubert began again. "I am not afraid
of evil tongues. There's a way of silencing them. But there's
my peace of mind too. I wouldn't be able to shake off the notion
that I've ruined a brother officer. Whatever action you take it
is bound to go further. The inquiry has been dropped&mdash;let it rest
now. It would have been the end of Feraud."</p>

<p>"Hey? What? Did he behave so badly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was pretty bad," muttered Lieutenant D'Hubert. Being
still very weak, he felt a disposition to cry.</p>

<p>As the other man did not belong to his own regiment the colonel
had no difficulty in believing this. He began to pace up and down
the room. He was a good chief and a man capable of discreet sympathy.
But he was human in other ways, too, and they were apparent because
he was not capable of artifice.</p>

<p>"The very devil, lieutenant!" he blurted out in the innocence
of his heart, "is that I have declared my intention to get to
the bottom of this affair. And when a colonel says something...
you see..."</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Hubert broke in earnestly.</p>

<p>"Let me entreat you, colonel, to be satisfied with taking my
word of honour that I was put into a damnable position where I
had no option. I had no choice whatever consistent with my dignity
as a man and an officer.... After all, colonel, this fact is the
very bottom of this affair. Here you've got it. The rest is a
mere detail...."</p>

<p>The colonel stopped short. The reputation of Lieutenant D'Hubert
for good sense and good temper weighed in the balance. A cool
head, a warm heart, open as the day. Always correct in his behaviour.
One had to trust him. The colonel repressed manfully an immense
curiosity.</p>

<p>"H'm! You affirm that as a man and an officer.... No option?
Eh?"</p>

<p>"As an officer, an officer of the Fourth Hussars, too," repeated
Lieutenant D'Hubert, "I had not. And that is the bottom of the
affair, colonel."</p>

<p>"Yes. But still I don't see why to one's colonel... A colonel
is a father&mdash;<em>que diable</em>."</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Hubert ought not to have been allowed out as yet.
He was becoming aware of his physical insufficiency with humiliation
and despair&mdash;but the morbid obstinacy of an invalid possessed
him&mdash;and at the same time he felt, with dismay, his eyes filling
with water. This trouble seemed too big to handle. A tear fell
down the thin, pale cheek of Lieutenant D'Hubert. The colonel
turned his back on him hastily. You could have heard a pin drop.</p>

<p>"This is some silly woman story&mdash;is it not?"</p>

<p>The chief spun round to seize the truth, which is not a beautiful
shape living in a well but a shy bird best caught by stratagem.
This was the last move of the colonel's diplomacy, and he saw
the truth shining unmistakably in the gesture of Lieutenant D'Hubert,
raising his weak arms and his eyes to heaven in supreme protest.</p>

<p>"Not a woman affair&mdash;eh?" growled the colonel, staring hard.
"I don't ask you who or where. All I want to know is whether there
is a woman in it?"</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Hubert's arms dropped and his weak voice was pathetically
broken.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind, mon colonel."</p>

<p>"On your honour?" insisted the old warrior.</p>

<p>"On my honour."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the colonel thoughtfully, and bit his lip.
The arguments of Lieutenant D'Hubert, helped by his liking for
the person, had convinced him. Yet it was highly improper that
his intervention, of which he had made no secret, should produce
no visible effect. He kept Lieutenant D'Hubert a little longer
and dismissed him kindly.</p>

<p>"Take a few days more in bed, lieutenant. What the devil does
the surgeon mean by reporting you fit for duty?"</p>

<p>On coming out of the colonel's quarters, Lieutenant D'Hubert
said nothing to the friend who was waiting outside to take him
home. He said nothing to anybody. Lieutenant D'Hubert made no
confidences. But in the evening of that day the colonel, strolling
under the elms growing near his quarters in the company of his
second in command opened his lips.</p>

<p>"I've got to the bottom of this affair," he remarked.</p>

<p>The lieutenant-colonel, a dry brown chip of a man with short
side-whiskers, pricked up his ears without letting a sound of
curiosity escape him.</p>

<p>"It's no trifle," added the colonel oracularly. The other waited
for a long while before he murmured:</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir!"</p>

<p>"No trifle," repeated the colonel, looking straight before him.
"I've, however, forbidden D'Hubert either to send to or receive
a challenge from Feraud for the next twelve months."</p>

<p>He had imagined this prohibition to save the prestige a colonel
should have. The result of it was to give an official seal to
the mystery surrounding this deadly quarrel. Lieutenant D'Hubert
repelled by an impassive silence all attempts to worm the truth
out of him. Lieutenant Feraud, secretly uneasy at first, regained
his assurance as time went on. He disguised his ignorance of the
meaning of the imposed truce by little sardonic laughs as though
he were amused by what he intended to keep to himself. "But what
will you do?" his chums used to ask him. He contented himself
by replying, "<em>Qui vivra verra</em>," with a truculent air.
And everybody admired his discretion.</p>

<p>Before the end of the truce, Lieutenant D'Hubert got his promotion.
It was well earned, but somehow no one seemed to expect the event.
When Lieutenant Feraud heard of it at a gathering of officers,
he muttered through his teeth, "Is that so?" Unhooking his sword
from a peg near the door, he buckled it on carefully and left
the company without another word. He walked home with measured
steps, struck a light with his flint and steel, and lit his tallow
candle. Then, snatching an unlucky glass tumbler off the mantelpiece,
he dashed it violently on the floor.</p>

<p>Now that D'Hubert was an officer of a rank superior to his own,
there could be no question of a duel. Neither could send nor receive
a challenge without rendering himself amenable to a court-martial.
It was not to be thought of. Lieutenant Feraud, who for many days
now had experienced no real desire to meet Lieutenant D'Hubert
arms in hand, chafed at the systematic injustice of fate. "Does
he think he will escape me in that way?" he thought indignantly.
He saw in it an intrigue, a conspiracy, a cowardly manoeuvre.
That colonel knew what he was doing. He had hastened to recommend
his pet for promotion. It was outrageous that a man should be
able to avoid the consequences of his acts in such a dark and
tortuous manner.</p>

<p>Of a happy-go-lucky disposition, of a temperament more pugnacious
than military, Lieutenant Feraud had been content to give and
receive blows for sheer love of armed strife and without much
thought of advancement. But after this disgusting experience an
urgent desire of promotion sprang up in his breast. This fighter
by vocation resolved in his mind to seize showy occasions and
to court the favourable opinion of his chiefs like a mere worldling.
He knew he was as brave as any one and never doubted his personal
charm. It would be easy, he thought. Nevertheless, neither the
bravery nor the charm seemed to work very swiftly. Lieutenant
Feraud's engaging, careless truculence of a "<em>beau sabreur</em>"
underwent a change. He began to make bitter allusions to "clever
fellows who stick at nothing to get on." The army was full of
them, he would say, you had only to look round. And all the time
he had in view one person only, his adversary D'Hubert. Once he
confided to an appreciative friend: "You see I don't know how
to fawn on the right sort of people. It isn't in me."</p>

<p>He did not get his step till a week after Austerlitz. The light
cavalry of the <em>Grande Armée</em> had its hands very full of
interesting work for a little while. But directly the pressure
of professional occupation had been eased by the armistice, Captain
Feraud took measures to arrange a meeting without loss of time.
"I know his tricks," he observed grimly. "If I don't look sharp
he will take care to get himself promoted over the heads of a
dozen better men than himself. He's got the knack of that sort
of thing." This duel was fought in Silesia. If not fought out
to a finish, it was at any rate fought to a standstill. The weapon
was the cavalry sabre, and the skill, the science, the vigour,
and the determination displayed by the adversaries compelled the
outspoken admiration of the beholders. It became the subject of
talk on both shores of the Danube, and as far south as the garrisons
of Gratz and Laybach. They crossed blades seven times. Both had
many slight cuts&mdash;mere scratches which bled profusely. Both refused
to have the combat stopped, time after time, with what appeared
the most deadly animosity. This appearance was caused on the part
of Captain D'Hubert by a rational desire to be done once for all
with this worry; on the part of Feraud by a tremendous exaltation
of his pugnacious instincts and the rage of wounded vanity. At
last, dishevelled, their shirts in rags, covered with gore and
hardly able to stand, they were carried forcibly off the field
by their marvelling and horrified seconds. Later on, besieged
by comrades avid of details, these gentlemen declared that they
could not have allowed that sort of hacking to go on. Asked whether
the quarrel was settled this time, they gave it out as their conviction
that it was a difference which could only be settled by one of
the parties remaining lifeless on the ground. The sensation spread
from army to army corps, and penetrated at last to the smallest
detachments of the troops cantoned between the Rhine and the Save.
In the cafés in Vienna where the masters of Europe took their
ease it was generally estimated from details to hand that the
adversaries would be able to meet again in three weeks' time,
on the outside. Something really transcendental in the way of
duelling was expected.</p>

<p>These expectations were brought to naught by the necessities
of the service which separated the two officers. No official notice
had been taken of their quarrel. It was now the property of the
army, and not to be meddled with lightly. But the story of the
duel, or rather their duelling propensities, must have stood somewhat
in the way of their advancement, because they were still captains
when they came together again during the war with Prussia. Detached
north after Jena with the army commanded by Marshal Bernadotte,
Prince of Ponte-Corvo, they entered Lubeck together. It was only
after the occupation of that town that Captain Feraud had leisure
to consider his future conduct in view of the fact that Captain
D'Hubert had been given the position of third aide-de-camp to
the marshal. He considered it a great part of a night, and in
the morning summoned two sympathetic friends.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking it over calmly," he said, gazing at them
with bloodshot, tired eyes. "I see that I must get rid of that
intriguing personage. Here he's managed to sneak onto the personal
staff of the marshal. It's a direct provocation to me. I can't
tolerate a situation in which I am exposed any day to receive
an order through him, and God knows what order, too! That sort
of thing has happened once before&mdash;and that's once too often.
He understands this perfectly, never fear. I can't tell you more
than this. Now go. You know what it is you have to do."</p>

<p>This encounter took place outside the town of Lubeck, on very
open ground selected with special care in deference to the general
sense of the cavalry division belonging to the army corps, that
this time the two officers should meet on horseback. After all,
this duel was a cavalry affair, and to persist in fighting on
foot would look like a slight on one's own arm of the service.
The seconds, startled by the unusual nature of the suggestion,
hastened to refer to their principals. Captain Feraud jumped at
it with savage alacrity. For some obscure reason, depending, no
doubt, on his psychology, he imagined himself invincible on horseback.
All alone within the four walls of his room he rubbed his hands
exultingly. "Aha! my staff officer, I've got you now!"</p>

<p>Captain D'Hubert, on his side, after staring hard for a considerable
time at his bothered seconds, shrugged his shoulders slightly.
This affair had hopelessly and unreasonably complicated his existence
for him. One absurdity more or less in the development did not
matter. All absurdity was distasteful to him; but, urbane as ever,
he produced a faintly ironic smile and said in his calm voice:</p>

<p>"It certainly will do away to some extent with the monotony of
the thing."</p>

<p>But, left to himself, he sat down at a table and took his head
into his hands. He had not spared himself of late, and the marshal
had been working his aides-de-camp particularly hard. The last
three weeks of campaigning in horrible weather had affected his
health. When overtired he suffered from a stitch in his wounded
side, and that uncomfortable sensation always depressed him. "It's
that brute's doing," he thought bitterly.</p>

<p>The day before he had received a letter from home, announcing
that his only sister was going to be married. He reflected that
from the time she was sixteen, when he went away to garrison life
in Strasburg, he had had but two short glimpses of her. They had
been great friends and confidants; and now they were going to
give her away to a man whom he did not know&mdash;a very worthy fellow,
no doubt, but not half good enough for her. He would never see
his old Léonie again. She had a capable little head and plenty
of tact; she would know how to manage the fellow, to be sure.
He was easy about her happiness, but he felt ousted from the first
place in her affection which had been his ever since the girl
could speak. And a melancholy regret of the days of his childhood
settled upon Captain D'Hubert, third aide-de-camp to the Prince
of Ponte-Corvo.</p>

<p>He pushed aside the letter of congratulation he had begun to
write, as in duty bound but without pleasure. He took a fresh
sheet of paper and wrote: "This is my last will and testament."
And, looking at these words, he gave himself up to unpleasant
reflection; a presentiment that he would never see the scenes
of his childhood overcame Captain D'Hubert. He jumped up, pushing
his chair back, yawned leisurely, which demonstrated to himself
that he didn't care anything for presentiments, and, throwing
himself on the bed, went to sleep. During the night he shivered
from time to time without waking up. In the morning he rode out
of town between his two seconds, talking of indifferent things
and looking right and left with apparent detachment into the heavy
morning mists, shrouding the flat green fields bordered by hedges.
He leaped a ditch, and saw the forms of many mounted men moving
in the low fog. "We are to fight before a gallery," he muttered
bitterly.</p>

<p>His seconds were rather concerned at the state of the atmosphere,
but presently a pale and sympathetic sun struggled above the vapours.
Captain D'Hubert made out in the distance three horsemen riding
a little apart; it was his adversary and his seconds. He drew
his sabre and assured himself that it was properly fastened to
his wrist. And now the seconds, who had been standing in a close
group with the heads of their horses together, separated at an
easy canter, leaving a large, clear field between him and his
adversary. Captain D'Hubert looked at the pale sun, at the dismal
landscape, and the imbecility of the impending fight filled him
with desolation. From a distant part of the field a stentorian
voice shouted commands at proper intervals: <em>Au pas &mdash;Au
trot &mdash;Chargez!</em> Presentiments of death don't come to
a man for nothing he thought at the moment he put spurs to his
horse.</p>

<p>And therefore nobody was more surprised than himself when, at
the very first set-to, Captain Feraud laid himself open to a cut
extending over the forehead, blinding him with blood, and ending
the combat almost before it had fairly begun. The surprise of
Captain Feraud might have been even greater. Captain D'Hubert,
leaving him swearing horribly and reeling in the saddle between
his two appalled friends, leaped the ditch again and trotted home
with his two seconds, who seemed rather awestruck at the speedy
issue of that encounter. In the evening, Captain D'Hubert finished
the congratulatory letter on his sister's marriage.</p>

<p>He finished it late. It was a long letter. Captain D'Hubert gave
reins to his fancy. He told his sister he would feel rather lonely
after this great change in her life. But, he continued, "the day
will come for me, too, to get married. In fact, I am thinking
already of the time when there will be no one left to fight in
Europe, and the epoch of wars will be over. I shall expect then
to be within measurable distance of a marshal's baton and you
will be an experienced married woman. You shall look out a nice
wife for me. I will be moderately bald by then, and a little blasé;
I will require a young girl&mdash;pretty, of course, and with a large
fortune, you know, to help me close my glorious career with the
splendour befitting my exalted rank." He ended with the information
that he had just given a lesson to a worrying, quarrelsome fellow,
who imagined he had a grievance against him. "But if you, in the
depth of your province," he continued, "ever hear it said that
your brother is of a quarrelsome disposition, don't you believe
it on any account. There is no saying what gossip from the army
may reach your innocent ears; whatever you hear, you may assure
our father that your ever loving brother is not a duellist." Then
Captain D'Hubert crumpled up the sheet of paper with the words,
"This is my last will and testament," and threw it in the fire
with a great laugh at himself. He didn't care a snap for what
that lunatic fellow could do. He had suddenly acquired the conviction
that this man was utterly powerless to affect his life in any
sort of way, except, perhaps, in the way of putting a certain
special excitement into the delightful gay intervals between the
campaigns.</p>

<p>From this on there were, however, to be no peaceful intervals
in the career of Captain D'Hubert. He saw the fields of Eylau
and Friedland, marched and countermarched in the snow, the mud,
and the dust of Polish plains, picking up distinction and advancement
on all the roads of northeastern Europe. Meantime, Captain Feraud,
despatched southward with his regiment, made unsatisfactory war
in Spain. It was only when the preparations for the Russian campaign
began that he was ordered north again. He left the country of
mantillas and oranges without regret.</p>

<p>The first signs of a not unbecoming baldness added to the lofty
aspect of Colonel D'Hubert's forehead. This feature was no longer
white and smooth as in the days of his youth, and the kindly open
glance of his blue eyes had grown a little hard, as if from much
peering through the smoke of battles. The ebony crop on Colonel
Feraud's head, coarse and crinkly like a cap of horsehair, showed
many silver threads about the temples. A detestable warfare of
ambushes and inglorious surprises had not improved his temper.
The beaklike curve of his nose was unpleasantly set off by deep
folds on each side of his mouth. The round orbits of his eyes
radiated fine wrinkles. More than ever he recalled an irritable
and staring fowl&mdash;something like a cross between a parrot and
an owl. He still manifested an outspoken dislike for "intriguing
fellows." He seized every opportunity to state that he did not
pick up his rank in the anterooms of marshals.</p>

<p>The unlucky persons, civil or military, who, with an intention
of being pleasant, begged Colonel Feraud to tell them how he came
by that very apparent scar on the forehead, were astonished to
find themselves snubbed in various ways, some of which were simply
rude and others mysteriously sardonic. Young officers were warned
kindly by their more experienced comrades not to stare openly
at the colonel's scar. But, indeed, an officer need have been
very young in his profession not to have heard the legendary tale
of that duel originating in some mysterious, unforgivable offence.</p>
