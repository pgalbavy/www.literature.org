<p></p>

<p>There was a terrific rumpus down at the rectory, on account of
Yvette and the Window Fund.  After the war, Aunt Cissie had set her
heart on a stained glass window in the church, as a memorial for
the men of the parish who had fallen.  But the bulk of the fallen
had been non-conformists, so the memorial took the form of an ugly
little monument in front of the Wesleyan chapel.</p>

<p>This did not vanquish Aunt Cissie.  She canvassed, she had bazaars,
she made the girls get up amateur theatrical shows, for her
precious window.  Yvette, who quite liked the acting and showing-
off part of it, took charge of the farce called Mary in the Mirror,
and gathered in the proceeds, which were to be paid to the Window
Fund when accounts were settled.  Each of the girls was supposed to
have a money-box for the Fund.</p>

<p>Aunt Cissie, feeling that the united sums must now almost suffice,
suddenly called in Yvette's box.  It contained fifteen shillings.
There was a moment of green horror.</p>

<p>&quot;Where is all the rest?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Yvette, casually.  &quot;I just borrowed it.  It wasn't so
awfully much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about the three pounds thirteen for Mary in the Mirror?&quot;
asked Aunt Cissie, as if the jaws of Hell were yawning.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh quite!  I just borrowed it.  I can pay it back.&quot;</p>

<p>Poor Aunt Cissie!  The green tumour of hate burst inside her, and
there was a ghastly, abnormal scene, which left Yvette shivering
with fear and nervous loathing.</p>

<p>Even the rector was rather severe.</p>

<p>&quot;If you needed money, why didn't you tell me?&quot; he said coldly.
&quot;Have you ever been refused anything in reason?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I - I thought it didn't matter,&quot; stammered Yvette.</p>

<p>&quot;And what have you done with the money?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose I've spent it,&quot; said Yvette, with wide, distraught eyes
and a peaked face.</p>

<p>&quot;Spent it, on what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't remember everything: stockings and things, and I gave some
of it away.&quot;</p>

<p>Poor Yvette!  Her lordly airs and ways were already hitting back at
her, on the reflex.  The rector was angry: his face had a snarling,
doggish look, a sort of sneer.  He was afraid his daughter was
developing some of the rank, tainted qualities of She-who-was-
Cynthia.</p>

<p>&quot;You WOULD do the large with somebody else's money, wouldn't you?&quot;
he said, with a cold, mongrel sort of sneer, which showed what an
utter unbeliever he was, at the heart.  The inferiority of a heart
which has no core of warm belief in it, no pride in life.  He had
utterly no belief in her.</p>

<p>Yvette went pale, and very distant.  Her pride, that frail,
precious flame which everybody tried to quench, recoiled like a
flame blown far away, on a cold wind, as if blown out, and her
face, white now and still like a snowdrop, the white snowflower of
his conceit, seemed to have no life in it, only this pure, strange
abstraction.</p>

<p>&quot;He has no belief in me!&quot; she thought in her soul.  &quot;I am really
nothing to him.  I am nothing, only a shameful thing.  Everything
is shameful, everything is shameful!&quot;</p>

<p>A flame of passion or rage, while it might have overwhelmed or
infuriated her, would not have degraded her as did her father's
unbelief, his final attitude of a sneer against her.</p>

<p>He became a little afraid, in the silence of sterile thought.
After all, he needed the APPEARANCE of love and belief and bright
life, he would never dare to face the fat worm of his own unbelief,
that stirred in his heart.</p>

<p>&quot;What have you to say for yourself?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>She only looked at him from that senseless snowdrop face which
haunted him with fear, and gave him a helpless sense of guilt.
That other one, She-who-was-Cynthia, she had looked back at him
with the same numb, white fear, the fear of his degrading unbelief,
the worm which was his heart's core.  He KNEW his heart's core was
a fat, awful worm.  His dread was lest anyone else should know.
His anguish of hate was against anyone who knew, and recoiled.</p>

<p>He saw Yvette recoiling, and immediately his manner changed to the
worldly old good-humoured cynic which he affected.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah well!&quot; he said.  &quot;You have to pay it back, my girl, that's all.
I will advance you the money out of your allowance.  But I shall
charge you four per-cent a month interest.  Even the devil himself
must pay a percentage on his debts.  Another time, if you can't
trust yourself, don't handle money which isn't your own.
Dishonesty isn't pretty.&quot;</p>

<p>Yvette remained crushed, and deflowered and humiliated.  She crept
about, trailing the rays of her pride.  She had a revulsion even
from herself.  Oh, why had she ever touched the leprous money!  Her
whole flesh shrank as if it were defiled.  Why was that?  Why, why
was that?</p>

<p>She admitted herself wrong in having spent the money.  &quot;Of course I
shouldn't have done it.  They are quite right to be angry,&quot; she
said to herself.</p>

<p>But where did the horrible wincing of her flesh come from?  Why did
she feel she had caught some physical contagion?</p>

<p>&quot;Where you're so SILLY, Yvette,&quot; Lucille lectured her: poor Lucille
was in great distress - &quot;is that you give yourself away to them all.
You might KNOW they'd find out.  I could have raised the money for
you, and saved all this bother.  It's perfectly awful!  But you
never will think beforehand where your actions are going to land
you!  Fancy Aunt Cissie saying all those things to you!  How AWFUL!
Whatever would Mamma have said, if she'd heard it?&quot;</p>

<p>When things went very wrong, they thought of their mother, and
despised their father and all the low brood of the Saywells.  Their
mother, of course, had belonged to a higher, if more dangerous and
&quot;immoral&quot; world.  More selfish, decidedly.  But with a showier
gesture.  More unscrupulous and more easily moved to contempt: but
not so humiliating.  Yvette always considered that she got her
fine, delicate flesh from her mother.  The Saywells were all a bit
leathery, and grubby somewhere inside.  But then the Saywells never
let you down.  Whereas the fine She-who-was-Cynthia had let the
rector down with a bang, and his little children along with him.
Her little children!  They could not quite forgive her.</p>

<p>Only dimly, after the row, Yvette began to realise the other
sanctity of herself, the sanctity of her sensitive, clean flesh and
blood, which the Saywells with their so-called morality, succeeded
in defiling.  They always wanted to defile it.  They were the life
unbelievers.  Whereas, perhaps She-who-was-Cynthia had only been a
moral unbeliever.</p>

<p>Yvette went about dazed and peaked and confused.  The rector paid
in the money to Aunt Cissie, much to that lady's rage.  The
helpless tumour of her rage was still running.  She would have
liked to announce her niece's delinquency in the parish magazine.
It was anguish to the destroyed woman that she could not publish
the news to all the world.  The selfishness!  The selfishness!  The
selfishness!</p>

<p>Then the rector handed his daughter a little account with himself:
her debt to him, interest thereon, the amount deducted from her
small allowance.  But to her credit he had placed a guinea, which
was the fee he had to pay for complicity.</p>

<p>&quot;As father of the culprit,&quot; he said humorously, &quot;I am fined one
guinea.  And with that I wash the ashes out of my hair.&quot;</p>

<p>He was always generous about money.  But somehow, he seemed to
think that by being free about money he could absolutely call
himself a generous man.  Whereas he used money, even generosity, as
a hold over her.</p>

<p>But he let the affair drop entirely.  He was by this time more
amused than anything, to judge from appearances.  He thought still
he was safe.</p>

<p>Aunt Cissie, however, could not get over her convulsion.  One night
when Yvette had gone rather early, miserably, to bed, when Lucille
was away at a party, and she was lying with soft, peaked limbs
aching with a sort of numbness and defilement, the door softly
opened, and there stood Aunt Cissie, pushing her grey-green face
through the opening of the door.  Yvette started up in terror.</p>

<p>&quot;Liar!  Thief!  Selfish little beast!&quot; hissed the maniacal face of
Aunt Cissie.  &quot;You little hypocrite!  You liar!  You selfish beast!
You greedy little beast!&quot;</p>

<p>There was such extraordinary impersonal hatred in that grey-green
mask, and those frantic words, that Yvette opened her mouth to
scream with hysterics.  But Aunt Cissie shut the door as suddenly
as she had opened it, and disappeared.  Yvette leaped from her bed
and turned the key.  Then she crept back, half demented with fear
of the squalid abnormal, half numbed with paralysis of damaged
pride.  And amid it all, up came a bubble of distracted laughter.
It WAS so filthily ridiculous!</p>

<p>Aunt Cissie's behaviour did not hurt the girl so very much.  It was
after all somewhat fantastic.  Yet hurt she was: in her limbs, in
her body, in her sex, hurt.  Hurt, numbed, and half destroyed, with
only her nerves vibrating and jangled.  And still so young, she
could not conceive what was happening.</p>

<p>Only she lay and wished she were a gipsy.  To live in a camp, in a
caravan, and never set foot in a house, not know the existence
of a parish, never look at a church.  Her heart was hard with
repugnance, against the rectory.  She loathed these houses
with their indoor sanitation and their bathrooms, and their
extraordinary repulsiveness.  She hated the rectory, and everything
it implied.  The whole stagnant, sewerage sort of life, where
sewerage is never mentioned, but where it seems to smell from the
centre of every two-legged inmate, from Granny to the servants, was
foul.  If gipsies had no bathrooms, at least they had no sewerage.
There was fresh air.  In the rectory there was NEVER fresh air.
And in the souls of the people, the air was stale till it stank.</p>

<p>Hate kindled her heart, as she lay with numbed limbs.  And she
thought of the words of the gipsy woman:  &quot;There is a dark man who
never lived in a house.  He loves you.  The other people are
treading on your heart.  They will tread on your heart till you
think it is dead.  But the dark man will blow the one spark up into
fire again, good fire.  You will see what good fire.&quot;</p>

<p>Even as the woman was saying it, Yvette felt there was some
duplicity somewhere.  But she didn't mind.  She hated with the
cold, acrid hatred of a child the rectory interior, the sort of
putridity in the life.  She liked that big, swarthy, wolf-like
gipsy-woman, with the big gold rings in her ears, the pink scarf
over her wavy black hair, the tight bodice of brown velvet, the
green, fan-like skirt.  She liked her dusky, strong, relentless
hands, that had pressed so firm, like wolf's paws, in Yvette's own
soft palm.  She liked her.  She liked the danger and the covert
fearlessness of her.  She liked her covert, unyielding sex, that
was immoral, but with a hard, defiant pride of its own.  Nothing
would ever get that woman under.  She would despise the rectory and
the rectory morality, utterly!  She would strangle Granny with one
hand.  And she would have the same contempt for Daddy and for Uncle
Fred, as men, as she would have for fat old slobbery Rover, the
Newfoundland dog.  A great, sardonic female contempt, for such
domesticated dogs, calling themselves men.</p>

<p>And the gipsy man himself!  Yvette quivered suddenly, as if she had
seen his big, bold eyes upon her, with the naked insinuation of
desire in them.  The absolutely naked insinuation of desire made
her life prone and powerless in the bed, as if a drug had cast her
in a new molten mould.</p>

<p>She never confessed to anybody that two of the ill-starred Window
Fund pounds had gone to the gipsy woman.  What if Daddy and Aunt
Cissie knew THAT!  Yvette stirred luxuriously in the bed.  The
thought of the gipsy had released the life of her limbs, and
crystallised in her heart the hate of the rectory: so that now she
felt potent, instead of impotent.</p>

<p>When, later, Yvette told Lucille about Aunt Cissie's dramatic
interlude in the bedroom doorway, Lucille was indignant.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, hang it all!&quot; cried she.  &quot;She might let it drop now.  I
should think we've heard enough about it by now!  Good heavens,
you'd think Aunt Cissie was a perfect bird of paradise!  Daddy's
dropped it, and after all, it's his business if it's anybody's.
Let Aunt Cissie shut up!&quot;</p>

<p>It was the very fact that the rector had dropped it, and that he
again treated the vague and inconsiderate Yvette as if she were
some specially-licensed being, that kept Aunt Cissie's bile
flowing.  The fact that Yvette really was most of the time unaware
of other people's feelings, and being unaware, couldn't care about
them, nearly sent Aunt Cissie mad.  Why should that young creature,
with a delinquent mother, go through life as a privileged being,
even unaware of other people's existence, though they were under
her nose.</p>

<p>Lucille at this time was very irritable.  She seemed as if she
simply went a little unbalanced, when she entered the rectory.
Poor Lucille, she was so thoughtful and responsible.  She did all
the extra troubling, thought about doctors, medicines, servants,
and all that sort of thing.  She slaved conscientiously at her job
all day in town, working in a room with artificial light from ten
till five.  And she came home to have her nerves rubbed almost to a
frenzy by Granny's horrible and persistent inquisitiveness and
parasitic agedness.</p>

<p>The affair of the Window Fund had apparently blown over, but there
remained a stuffy tension in the atmosphere.  The weather continued
bad.  Lucille stayed at home on the afternoon of her half holiday,
and did herself no good by it.  The rector was in his study, she
and Yvette were making a dress for the latter young woman, Granny
was resting on the couch.</p>

<p>The dress was of blue silk velours, French material, and was going
to be very becoming.  Lucille made Yvette try it on again: she was
nervously uneasy about the hang, under the arms.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh bother!&quot; cried Yvette, stretching her long, tender, childish
arms, that tended to go bluish with the cold.  &quot;Don't be so
frightfully FUSSY, Lucille!  It's quite all right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If that's all the thanks I get, slaving my half day away making
dresses for you, I might as well do something for myself!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Lucille!  You know I never ASKED you!  You know you can't
bear it unless you DO supervise,&quot; said Yvette, with that irritating
blandness of hers, as she raised her naked elbows and peered over
her shoulder into the long mirror.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes! you never ASKED me!&quot; cried Lucille.  &quot;As if I didn't know
what you meant, when you started sighing and flouncing about.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I!&quot; said Yvette, with vague surprise.  &quot;Why, when did I start
sighing and flouncing about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course you know you did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did I?  No, I didn't know!  When was it?&quot;  Yvette could put a
peculiar annoyance into her mild, straying questions.</p>

<p>&quot;I shan't do another thing to this frock, if you don't stand still
and STOP it,&quot; said Lucille, in her rather sonorous, burning voice.</p>

<p>&quot;You know you are most awfully nagging and irritable, Lucille,&quot;
said Yvette, standing as if on hot bricks.</p>

<p>&quot;Now Yvette!&quot; cried Lucille, her eyes suddenly flashing in her
sister's face, with wild flashes.  &quot;Stop it at once!  Why should
everybody put up with your abominable and overbearing temper!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I don't know about MY temper,&quot; said Yvette, writhing slowly
out of the half-made frock, and slipping into her dress again.</p>

<p>Then, with an obstinate little look on her face, she sat down again
at the table, in the gloomy afternoon, and began to sew at the blue
stuff.  The room was littered with blue clippings, the scissors
were lying on the floor, the work-basket was spilled in chaos all
over the table, and a second mirror was perched perilously on the
piano.</p>

<p>Granny, who had been in a semi-coma, called a doze, roused herself
on the big, soft couch and put her cap straight.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't get much peace for my nap,&quot; she said, slowly feeling her
thin white hair, to see that it was in order.  She had heard vague
noises.</p>

<p>Aunt Cissie came in, fumbling in a bag for a chocolate.</p>

<p>&quot;I never saw such a mess!&quot; she said.  &quot;You'd better clear some of
that litter away, Yvette.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Yvette.  &quot;I will in a minute.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Which means never!&quot; sneered Aunt Cissie, suddenly darting and
picking up the scissors.</p>

<p>There was silence for a few moments, and Lucille slowly pushed her
hands in her hair, as she read a book.</p>

<p>&quot;You'd better clear away, Yvette,&quot; persisted Aunt Cissie.</p>

<p>&quot;I will, before tea,&quot; replied Yvette, rising once more and pulling
the blue dress over her head, flourishing her long, naked arms
through the sleeveless armholes.  Then she went between the
mirrors, to look at herself once more.</p>

<p>As she did so, she sent the second mirror, that she had perched
carelessly on the piano, sliding with a rattle to the floor.
Luckily it did not break.  But everybody started badly.</p>

<p>&quot;She's smashed the mirror!&quot; cried Aunt Cissie.</p>

<p>&quot;Smashed a mirror!  Which mirror!  Who's smashed it?&quot; came Granny's
sharp voice.</p>

<p>&quot;I haven't smashed anything,&quot; came the calm voice of Yvette.  &quot;It's
quite all right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'd better not perch it up there again,&quot; said Lucille.</p>

<p>Yvette, with a little impatient shrug at all the fuss, tried making
the mirror stand in another place.  She was not successful.</p>

<p>&quot;If one had a fire in one's own room,&quot; she said crossly, &quot;one
needn't have a lot of people fussing when one wants to sew.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Which mirror are you moving about?&quot; asked Granny.</p>

<p>&quot;One of our own, that came from the Vicarage,&quot; said Yvette rudely.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't break it in THIS house, wherever it came from,&quot; said Granny.</p>

<p>There was a sort of family dislike for the furniture that had
belonged to She-who-was-Cynthia.  It was most of it shoved into the
kitchen, and the servants' bedrooms.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I'M not superstitious,&quot; said Yvette, &quot;about mirrors or any of
that sort of thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps you're not,&quot; said Granny.  &quot;People who never take the
responsibility for their own actions usually don't care what
happens.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After all,&quot; said Yvette, &quot;I may say it's my own looking-glass,
even if I did break it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I say,&quot; said Granny, &quot;that there shall be no mirrors broken in
THIS house, if we can help it; no matter who they belong to, or did
belong to.  Cissie, have I got my cap straight?&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Cissie went over and straightened the old lady.  Yvette loudly
and irritatingly trilled a tuneless tune.</p>

<p>&quot;And now, Yvette, will you please clear away,&quot; said Aunt Cissie.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh bother!&quot; cried Yvette angrily.  &quot;It's simply AWFUL to live with
a lot of people who are always nagging and fussing over trifles.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What people, may I ask?&quot; said Aunt Cissie ominously.</p>

<p>Another row was imminent.  Lucille looked up with a queer cast in
her eyes.  In the two girls, the blood of She-who-was-Cynthia was
roused.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course you may ask!  You know quite well I mean the people in
this beastly house,&quot; said the outrageous Yvette.</p>

<p>&quot;At least,&quot; said Granny, &quot;we don't come of half-depraved stock.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a second's electric pause.  Then Lucille sprang from her
low seat, with sparks flying from her.</p>

<p>&quot;You shut up!&quot; she shouted, in a blast full upon the mottled
majesty of the old lady.</p>

<p>The old woman's breast began to heave with heaven knows what
emotions.  The pause this time, as after the thunderbolt, was icy.</p>

<p>Then Aunt Cissie, livid, sprang upon Lucille, pushing her like a
fury.</p>

<p>&quot;Go to your room!&quot; she cried hoarsely.  &quot;Go to your room!&quot;</p>

<p>And she proceeded to push the white but fiery-eyed Lucille from the
room.  Lucille let herself be pushed, while Aunt Cissie
vociferated:</p>

<p>&quot;Stay in your room till you've apologised for this! - till you've
apologised to the Mater for this!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shan't apologise!&quot; came the clear voice of Lucille, from the
passage, while Aunt Cissie shoved her.</p>

<p>Aunt Cissie drove her more wildly upstairs.</p>

<p>Yvette stood tall and bemused in the sitting-room, with the air of
offended dignity, at the same time bemused, which was so odd on
her.  She still was bare-armed, in the half-made blue dress.  And
even SHE was half-aghast at Lucille's attack on the majesty of age.
But also, she was coldly indignant against Granny's aspersion of
the maternal blood in their veins.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course I meant no offense,&quot; said Granny.</p>

<p>&quot;Didn't you!&quot; said Yvette coolly.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course not.  I only said we're not depraved, just because we
happen to be superstitious about breaking mirrors.&quot;</p>

<p>Yvette could hardly believe her ears.  Had she heard right?  Was it
possible!  Or was Granny, at her age, just telling a barefaced lie?</p>

<p>Yvette knew that the old woman was telling a cool, barefaced lie.
But already, so quickly, Granny believed her own statement.</p>

<p>The rector appeared, having left time for a lull.</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot; he asked cautiously, genially.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, nothing!&quot; drawled Yvette.  &quot;Lucille told Granny to shut up,
when she was saying something.  And Aunt Cissie drove her up to her
room.  Tant de bruit pour une omelette!  Though Lucille WAS a bit
over the mark, that time.&quot;</p>

<p>The old lady couldn't quite catch what Yvette said.</p>

<p>&quot;Lucille really will have to learn to control her nerves,&quot; said the
old woman.  &quot;The mirror fell down, and it worried me.  I said so to
Yvette, and she said something about superstitions and the people
in the beastly house.  I told her the people in the house were not
depraved, if they happened to mind when a mirror was broken.  And
at that Lucille flew at me and told me to shut up.  It really is
disgraceful how these children give way to their nerves.  I know
it's nothing but nerves.&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Cissie had come in during this speech.  At first even she was
dumb.  Then it seemed to her, it was as Granny had said.</p>

<p>&quot;I have forbidden her to come down until she comes to apologise to
the Mater,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;I doubt if she'll apologise,&quot; said the calm, queenly Yvette,
holding her bare arms.</p>

<p>&quot;And I don't want any apology,&quot; said the old lady.  &quot;It is merely
nerves.  I don't know what they'll come to, if they have nerves
like that, at their age!  She must take Vibrofat. - I am sure Arthur
would like his tea, Cissie!&quot;</p>

<p>Yvette swept her sewing together, to go upstairs.  And again she
trilled her tune, rather shrill and tuneless.  She was trembling
inwardly.</p>

<p>&quot;More glad rags!&quot; said her father to her, genially.</p>

<p>&quot;More glad rags!&quot; she re-iterated sagely, as she sauntered
upstairs, with her day dress over one arm.  She wanted to console
Lucille, and ask her how the blue stuff hung now.</p>

<p>At the first landing, she stood as she nearly always did, to gaze
through the window that looked to the road and the bridge.  Like
the Lady of Shalott, she seemed always to imagine that someone
would come along singing Tirra-lirra! or something equally
intelligent, by the river.</p>
