<p>I am at some disadvantage in giving an account of the remarkable
interview between the little Delaware girl, Linna, and the three
hostile warriors who had trailed the Ripleys to the stream in
the wilderness across which they had just leaped in the effort
to continue their flight from Wyoming to the Upper Delaware.</p>

<p>There were no witnesses to the interview except the parties named,
but when Linna in after years had become a woman, with her very
strong memory she gave a description of what passed, and it has
come down through the descendants of the pioneers to the present
day.</p>

<p>You will permit me to found my narrative upon her testimony,
and to be quite liberal in the interpretation of what took place.</p>

<p>The fears of the fugitives were well founded. The three red men
were near them for a long while before they showed themselves.
It was very much as Mrs. Ripley had said. They were so sure of
the prize that they trifled with them.</p>

<p>Linna reached the spot where the warriors were standing directly
after one of the number had sent a bullet through the bear. Young
as she was, she understood the peril of her friends, and set out
to do all she could for them.</p>

<p>She knew that Omas, her father, was a great warrior. He belonged
to the Delaware tribe, which years before had been soundly beaten
by the Iroquois and reduced almost to slavery; but among the conquered
people were many without superiors in bravery, skill, and prowess.
Omas was one of the most noted examples.</p>

<p>The first thrill of hope came to the young child when she recognised
the one that had killed the bear. He was Red Wolf, a member of
her own tribe, who often had been in her father's wigwam, and
was therefore well known to his child. The others were of the
Seneca tribe, one of those composing the Iroquois, or Six Nations,
the most powerful confederation of Indians that ever existed on
the American continent.</p>

<p>The three looked at the little girl in amazement, as she came
running between the trees. She dropped to a rapid walk, and did
not stop until she was among them.</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?" asked Red Wolf, in the Delaware tongue.</p>

<p>"My father, the great Omas, brought me to see my friend Alice.
He left me with her people, and you must not harm them."</p>

<p>"Why did Omas leave you with them?"</p>

<p>"They are my friends."</p>

<p>It should be said the Senecas, who calmly listened to the conversation,
understood all that was said.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"A long way through the wood."</p>

<p>"Why does Omas leave you with the palefaces? You should be in
your own wigwam many miles away."</p>

<p>"He knows I am safe with them. He led us through the woods until
he could leave us; then he went back to the great river between
the mountains to help the other warriors fight."</p>

<p>None of the three could doubt that the child was speaking the
truth. They held the prowess of Omas in high respect; but they
were not the ones to surrender such a prize as was already theirs.</p>

<p>"We will take them back to Wyoming with us," said Red Wolf; "then
Omas may do as he thinks best with them."</p>

<p>With a shrewdness far beyond her years, Linna said&mdash;"He wants
them to go to the other big river, off yonder"&mdash;pointing eastward.
"Why do you wish to take them back to Wyoming?"</p>

<p>"If he wants them to go to the other big river, he can send them
after he sees them again."</p>

<p>"You will make Omas angry; he will strike you down with his tomahawk,"
said Linna.</p>

<p>Although these words were the words of a child, they produced
their effect. Red Wolf knew how deeply the grim warrior loved
his only daughter, and he knew, too, how terrible was the wrath
of the warrior. Omas had chosen to spare this family from the
cruelty visited upon so many others. If Red Wolf dared to run
the risk of rousing the vengeance of Omas, he must take the consequences.
He shrank from doing so.</p>

<p>The Delaware beckoned to one of the Senecas, and they stepped
aside and talked a few minutes, in tones too low for the listening
Linna to hear what was said. Subsequent events, however, made
clear the meaning of their conversation.</p>

<p>Red Wolf proposed to spare the fugitives. He wished to go away
with his companions and leave them to pursue their flight without
molestation, so far as they were concerned.</p>

<p>But the Senecas held Omas in less dread than did Red Wolf. They
were unwilling to let the whites escape. The third warrior, who
joined them, was as strenuous as the first. While one might have
shrunk from stirring the anger of the famous Delaware, the two
together did not hesitate to run counter to his wishes. They refused
to be dissuaded by Red Wolf.</p>

<p>They remained apart from the girl for ten minutes, earnestly
conversing, while she could not overhear a word.</p>

<p>Finally one of the three&mdash;a Seneca&mdash;turned about and walked away,
as if impatient with the dispute. He took a course leading from
the stream, and deeper into the woods.</p>

<p>Linna noticed the curious act, but, great as was her acumen for
one of her years, she did not suspect its meaning. It would have
been passing strange had she done so, for the movement was meant
to deceive her and bring the disputation to an end.</p>

<p>The couple remaining walked to where Linna awaited them. The
Seneca turned aside and sauntered to the carcass of the bear as
if that had more interest just then for him.</p>

<p>"What will Omas do if my brother warriors take your friends back
to the other river, but Red Wolf does not help?"</p>

<p>"He will strike them down with his tomahawk; my father, Omas,
is a great warrior."</p>

<p>The black eyes flashed as the girl proudly uttered these words,
and she looked defiantly in the painted face towering above her.</p>

<p>"But what will he do with Red Wolf?"</p>

<p>"He will strike down Red Wolf, because he is a coward, and did
not keep all harm from his white friends."</p>

<p>This intimation that the Delaware could not shelter himself behind
the plea of neutrality, but must be either an active friend or
foe, was a little more than he could accept. While he held Omas
in wholesome dread, he dared not array himself against the two
Senecas, who were determined not to spare the hapless fugitives.</p>

<p>Red Wolf was a fair specimen of his tribe, who, as I have stated,
were beaten by the Iroquois. These conquerors, indeed, carried
matters with so high a hand that they once forbade the Delawares
to use firearms, but made them keep to the old fashioned bow and
arrow.</p>

<p>Red Wolf, therefore, having squared accounts, so to speak, with
his present companions, was anxious to win the good will of Linna,
and thereby that of her fierce parent, who was a hurricane in
his wrath, and likely to brain Red Wolf before he could explain
matters.</p>

<p>"Omas is the greatest warrior of the Delawares," he said to Linna;
"Red Wolf and he are brothers. But the Senecas will not listen
to the words of Red Wolf: they love not Omas as does Red Wolf."</p>

<p>The Delaware child now found herself in a quandary. She had made
her plea, but, so far as she could see, it was in vain, since
the friendship of Red Wolf alone was not enough. One of the Senecas
was studying the body of the dead bear and paying no heed to her
words; the other had gone off, she knew not where.</p>

<p>What remained for her to do?</p>

<p>While the little one asked herself the question, and was trying,
to think what course she should follow, the absent Seneca was
working out the mischievous plot he had formed, and which was
fully known to his companions.</p>

<p>An uprooted tree lay extended on the ground, near where Mrs.
Ripley and her children saw Linna run off to plead with the Indians.
Since they could do nothing but wait, helpless and almost despairing,
for the return of the child, they sat down on the prostrate trunk.</p>

<p>Ben was near the base, close to the mass of upturned roots, which
spread out like an enormous fan, with its dirt and prong-like
roots projecting in all directions. He was tired, depressed, and
worn out. It will be remembered he had not slept a wink during
the preceding night, or eaten a mouthful of food since then. Strong,
sturdy, and lusty as he was, he could not help feeling the effects
of all this.</p>

<p>He leaned his rifle against a huge, gnarled root, within arm's
length of where he half reclined, with his feet extended along
the trunk. He had but to reach out his hand, without moving his
body, to grasp the weapon whatever moment it might be needed.</p>

<p>Exhausted as he was, his condition was too nervous to permit
slumber. His mother had said she thought the end was at hand,
and he believed the same.</p>

<p>She was but a few feet away, sitting more erect on the tree,
with Alice leaning against her.</p>

<p>The eyes of all were turned toward the point where Linna had
vanished, and whence she was expected every minute to come into
view again.</p>

<p>She was not far off. Once or twice the mother and son caught
the sounds of their voices, though the exuberant vegetation shut
them from sight.</p>

<p>"It was idle for her to go," said Ben; "and I cannot see any
chance of her helping us."</p>

<p>"They will not harm her, nor will they be denied the pleasure
of doing what they choose with us."</p>

<p>"Some persons might believe the delay was favorable, but I cannot
think that way."</p>

<p>Neither felt like conversation. It was an effort to say anything;
but mother and son, in their unselfishness, pitied each other,
and strove vainly to lift the gloomy thoughts that were oppressing
both.</p>

<p>Had Ben Ripley seen the departure of the Seneca, he might have
suspected its meaning; but, unaware of it, he never dreamed of
the new form which the ever present danger thus assumed.</p>

<p>The Seneca, after leaving Red Wolf and the other warrior, walked
directly over the path leading away from the stream until well
beyond the sight of those thus left behind. He looked back, and,
seeing nothing of them, turned aside and moved off, until he arrived
at a point beyond the group of three resting on the fallen tree.</p>

<p>Thus, as will be seen, the Ripleys were between the two and Linna
on the one hand, and the single Seneca on the other. He knew the
precise location of the fugitives as well as if they had been
in his field of vision from the first.</p>

<p>He now began approaching them from the rear. Their faces turned
away from him, and everything favored his stealthy advance.</p>

<p>The huge spread of dirt and roots made by the overturning of
the big tree served as a screen, though even without this help
he would probably have succeeded in his effort to steal upon them
unawares.</p>

<p>He stepped so carefully upon the dried leaves that no sound was
made, and the most highly trained ear, therefore, would not have
detected him.</p>

<p>If Ben had once risen from his reclining posture and looked around,
if Mrs. Ripley had stood up and done the same, or if little Alice
had indulged in her natural sportiveness, assuredly one of them
would have observed that crouching warrior, gradually drawing
closer, like the moving of a hand over the face of a clock; but
none saw him. Nearer and nearer he came, step by step, until at
last he stood just on the other side of the mass of roots, and
not ten feet from the boy.</p>

<p>With the same noiselessness, the crouching form bent over sideways
and peered around the screen. Then the dusky arm glided forward
until the iron fingers clasped the barrel of the rifle leaning
against the root, and the weapon was withdrawn.</p>

<p>He now had two guns, and Ben Ripley none.</p>

<p>Then the Seneca advanced, a weapon in either hand, and, presenting
himself in front of the amazed group, exclaimed&mdash;"Huh! how do,
bruder?&mdash;how do sister?"</p>

<p>Ben Ripley sprang up as if shot, and his startled mother, with
a gasp of affright, turned her head.</p>

<p>For one moment the boy meditated leaping upon the warrior, in
the desperate attempt to wrench his gun from his grasp; but the
mother, reading his intention, interposed.</p>

<p>"Do nothing, my son: we are in the hands of Heaven."</p>
