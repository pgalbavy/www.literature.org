<p>I did not profit by Alan’s pilotage as he had done by his marchings
under General Cope; for I can scarce tell what way we went. It
is my excuse that we travelled exceeding fast. Some part we ran,
some trotted, and the rest walked at a vengeance of a pace. Twice,
while we were at top speed, we ran against country-folk; but though
we plumped into the first from round a corner, Alan was as ready
as a loaded musket.</p>

<p>"Has ye seen my horse?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Na, man, I haenae seen nae horse the day," replied the countryman.</p>

<p>And Alan spared the time to explain to him that we were travelling
"ride and tie"; that our charger had escaped, and it was feared
he had gone home to Linton. Not only that, but he expended some
breath (of which he had not very much left) to curse his own misfortune
and my stupidity which was said to be its cause.</p>

<p>"Them that cannae tell the truth," he observed to myself as we
went on again, "should be aye mindful to leave an honest, handy
lee behind them. If folk dinnae ken what ye’re doing, Davie, they’re
terrible taken up with it; but if they think they ken, they care
nae mair for it than what I do for pease porridge."</p>

<p>As we had first made inland, so our road came in the end to lie
very near due north; the old Kirk of Aberlady for a landmark on
the left; on the right, the top of the Berwick Law; and it was
thus we struck the shore again, not far from Dirleton. From north
Berwick west to Gillane Ness there runs a string of four small
islets, Craiglieth, the Lamb, Fidra, and Eyebrough, notable by
their diversity of size and shape. Fidra is the most particular,
being a strange grey islet of two humps, made the more conspicuous
by a piece of ruin; and I mind that (as we drew closer to it)
by some door or window of these ruins the sea peeped through like
a man’s eye. Under the lee of Fidra there is a good anchorage
in westerly winds, and there, from a far way off, we could see
the <em>Thistle</em> riding.</p>

<p>The shore in face of these islets is altogether waste. Here is
no dwelling of man, and scarce any passage, or at most of vagabond
children running at their play. Gillane is a small place on the
far side of the Ness, the folk of Dirleton go to their business
in the inland fields, and those of North Berwick straight to the
sea-fishing from their haven; so that few parts of the coast are
lonelier. But I mind, as we crawled upon our bellies into that
multiplicity of heights and hollows, keeping a bright eye upon
all sides, and our hearts hammering at our ribs, there was such
a shining of the sun and the sea, such a stir of the wind in the
bent grass, and such a bustle of down-popping rabbits and up-flying
gulls, that the desert seemed to me, like a place alive. No doubt
it was in all ways well chosen for a secret embarcation, if the
secret had been kept; and even now that it was out, and the place
watched, we were able to creep unperceived to the front of the
sandhills, where they look down immediately on the beach and sea.</p>

<p>But here Alan came to a full stop.</p>

<p>"Davie," said he, "this is a kittle passage! As long as we lie
here we’re safe; but I’m nane sae muckle nearer to my ship or
the coast of France. And as soon as we stand up and signal the
brig, it’s another matter. For where will your gentry be, think
ye?"</p>

<p>"Maybe they’re no come yet," said I. "And even if they are, there’s
one clear matter in our favour. They’ll be all arranged to take
us, that’s true. But they’ll have arranged for our coming from
the east and here we are upon their west."</p>

<p>"Ay," says Alan, "I wish we were in some force, and this was
a battle, we would have bonnily out-manœuvred them! But it isnae,
Davit; and the way it is, is a wee thing less inspiring to Alan
Breck. I swither, Davie."</p>

<p>"Time flies, Alan," said I.</p>

<p>"I ken that," said Alan. "I ken naething else, as the French
folk say. But this is a dreidful case of heids or tails. O! if
I could but ken where your gentry were!"</p>

<p>"Alan," said I, "this is no like you. It’s got to be now or never."</p>

<p>"This is no me, quo’ he,"</p>

<p>sang Alan, with a queer face betwixt shame and drollery.</p>

<p>"Neither you nor me, quo’ he, neither you nor me. Wow, na, Johnnie
man! neither you nor me."</p>

<p>And then of a sudden he stood straight up where he was, and with
a handkerchief flying in his right hand, marched down upon the
beach. I stood up myself, but lingered behind him, scanning the
sand-hills to the east. His appearance was at first unremarked:
Scougal not expecting him so early, and <em>my gentry</em> watching
on the other side. Then they awoke on board the <em>Thistle</em>,
and it seemed they had all in readiness, for there was scarce
a second’s bustle on the deck before we saw a skiff put round
her stern and begin to pull lively for the coast. Almost at the
same moment of time, and perhaps half a mile away towards Gillane
Ness, the figure of a man appeared for a blink upon a sandhill,
waving with his arms; and though he was gone again in the same
flash, the gulls in that part continued a little longer to fly
wild.</p>

<p>Alan had not seen this, looking straight to seaward at the ship
and skiff.</p>

<p>"It maun be as it will!" said he, when I had told him, "Weel
may yon boatie row, or my craig’ll have to thole a raxing."</p>

<p>That part of the beach was long and flat, and excellent walking
when the tide was down; a little cressy burn flowed over it in
one place to the sea; and the sandhills ran along the head of
it like the rampart of a town. No eye of ours could spy what was
passing behind there in the bents, no hurry of ours could mend
the speed of the boat’s coming: time stood still with us through
that uncanny period of waiting.</p>

<p>"There is one thing I would like to ken," say Alan. "I would
like to ken these gentry’s orders. We’re worth four hunner pound
the pair of us: how if they took the guns to us, Davie! They would
get a bonny shot from the top of that lang sandy bank."</p>

<p>"Morally impossible," said I. "The point is that they can have
no guns. This thing has been gone about too secret; pistols they
may have, but never guns."</p>

<p>"I believe ye’ll be in the right," says Alan. "For all which
I am wearing a good deal for yon boat."</p>

<p>And he snapped his fingers and whistled to it like a dog.</p>

<p>It was now perhaps a third of the way in, and we ourselves already
hard on the margin of the sea, so that the soft sand rose over
my shoes. There was no more to do whatever but to wait, to look
as much as we were able at the creeping nearer of the boat, and
as little as we could manage at the long impenetrable front of
the sandhills, over which the gulls twinkled and behind which
our enemies were doubtless marshalling.</p>

<p>"This is a fine, bright, caller place to get shot in," says Alan
suddenly; "and, man, I wish that I had your courage!"</p>

<p>"Alan!" I cried, "what kind of talk is this of it! You’re just
made of courage; it’s the character of the man, as I could prove
myself if there was nobody else."</p>

<p>"And you would be the more mistaken," said he. "What makes the
differ with me is just my great penetration and knowledge of affairs.
But for auld, cauld, dour, deadly courage, I am not fit to hold
a candle to yourself. Look at us two here upon the sands. Here
am I, fair hotching to be off; here’s you (for all that I ken)
in two minds of it whether you’ll no stop. Do you think that I
could do that, or would? No me! Firstly, because I havenae got
the courage and wouldnae daur; and secondly, because I am a man
of so much penetration and would see ye damned first."</p>

<p>"It’s there ye’re coming, is it?" I cried. "Ah, man Alan, you
can wile your old wives, but you never can wile me."</p>

<p>Remembrance of my temptation in the wood made me strong as iron.</p>

<p>"I have a tryst to keep," I continued. "I am trysted with your
cousin Charlie; I have passed my word."</p>

<p>"Braw trysts that you’ll can keep," said Alan. "Ye’ll just mistryst
aince and for a’ with the gentry in the bents. And what for?"
he went on with an extreme threatening gravity. "Just tell me
that, my mannie! Are ye to be speerited away like Lady Grange?
Are they to drive a dirk in your inside and bury ye in the bents?
Or is it to be the other way, and are they to bring ye in with
James? Are they folk to be trustit? Would ye stick your head in
the mouth of Sim Fraser and the ither Whigs?" he added with extraordinary
bitterness.</p>

<p>"Alan," cried I, "they’re all rogues and liars, and I’m with
ye there. The more reason there should be one decent man in such
a land of thieves! My word is passed, and I’ll stick to it. I
said long syne to your kinswoman that I would stumble at no risk.
Do ye mind of that?—the night Red Colin fell, it was. No more
I will, then. Here I stop. Prestongrange promised me my life:
if he’s to be mansworn, here I’ll have to die."</p>

<p>"Aweel aweel," said Alan.</p>

<p>All this time we had seen or heard no more of our pursuers. In
truth we had caught them unawares; their whole party (as I was
to learn afterwards) had not yet reached the scene; what there
was of them was spread among the bents towards Gillane. It was
quite an affair to call them in and bring them over, and the boat
was making speed. They were besides but cowardly fellows: a mere
leash of Highland cattle-thieves, of several clans, no gentleman
there to be the captain and the more they looked at Alan and me
upon the beach, the less (I must suppose) they liked the look
of us.</p>

<p>Whoever had betrayed Alan it was not the captain: he was in the
skiff himself, steering and stirring up his oarsmen, like a man
with his heart in his employ. Already he was near in, and the
boat securing—already Alan’s face had flamed crimson with the
excitement of his deliverance, when our friends in the bents,
either in their despair to see their prey escape them or with
some hope of scaring Andie, raised suddenly a shrill cry of several
voices.</p>

<p>This sound, arising from what appeared to be a quite deserted
coast, was really very daunting, and the men in the boat held
water instantly.</p>

<p>"What’s this of it?" sings out the captain, for he was come within
an easy hail.</p>

<p>"Freens o’mine," says Alan, and began immediately to wade forth
in the shallow water towards the boat. "Davie," he said, pausing,
"Davie, are ye no coming? I am swier to leave ye."</p>

<p>"Not a hair of me," said I.</p>

<p>"He stood part of a second where he was to his knees in the salt
water, hesitating.</p>

<p>"He that will to Cupar, maun to Cupar," said he, and swashing
in deeper than his waist, was hauled into the skiff, which was
immediately directed for the ship.</p>

<p>I stood where he had left me, with my hands behind my back; Alan
sat with his head turned watching me; and the boat drew smoothly
away. Of a sudden I came the nearest hand to shedding tears, and
seemed to myself the most deserted solitary lad in Scotland. With
that I turned my back upon the sea and faced the sandhills. There
was no sight or sound of man; the sun shone on the wet sand and
the dry, the wind blew in the bents, the gulls made a dreary piping.
As I passed higher up the beach, the sand-lice were hopping nimbly
about the stranded tangles. The devil any other sight or sound
in that unchancy place. And yet I knew there were folk there,
observing me, upon some secret purpose. They were no soldiers,
or they would have fallen on and taken us ere now; doubtless they
were some common rogues hired for my undoing, perhaps to kidnap,
perhaps to murder me outright. From the position of those engaged,
the first was the more likely; from what I knew of their character
and ardency in this business, I thought the second very possible;
and the blood ran cold about my heart.</p>

<p>I had a mad idea to loosen my sword in the scabbard; for though
I was very unfit to stand up like a gentleman blade to blade,
I thought I could do some scathe in a random combat. But I perceived
in time the folly of resistance. This was no doubt the joint "expedient"
on which Prestongrange and Fraser were agreed. The first, I was
very sure, had done something to secure my life; the second was
pretty likely to have slipped in some contrary hints into the
ears of Neil and his companions; and if I were to show bare steel
I might play straight into the hands of my worst enemy and seal
my own doom.</p>

<p>These thoughts brought me to the head of the beach. I cast a
look behind, the boat was nearing the brig, and Alan flew his
handkerchief for a farewell, which I replied to with the waving
of my hand. But Alan himself was shrunk to a small thing in my
view, alongside of this pass that lay in front of me. I set my
hat hard on my head, clenched my teeth, and went right before
me up the face of the sand-wreath. It made a hard climb, being
steep, and the sand like water underfoot. But I caught hold at
last by the long bent-grass on the brae-top, and pulled myself
to a good footing. The same moment men stirred and stood up here
and there, six or seven of them, ragged-like knaves, each with
a dagger in his hand. The fair truth is, I shut my eyes and prayed.
When I opened them again, the rogues were crept the least thing
nearer without speech or hurry. Every eye was upon mine, which
struck me with a strange sensation of their brightness, and of
the fear with which they continued to approach me. I held out
my hands empty; whereupon one asked, with a strong Highland brogue,
if I surrendered.</p>

<p>"Under protest," said I, "if ye ken what that means, which I
misdoubt."</p>

<p>At that word, they came all in upon me like a flight of birds
upon a carrion, seized me, took my sword, and all the money from
my pockets, bound me hand and foot with some strong line, and
cast me on a tussock of bent. There they sat about their captive
in a part of a circle and gazed upon him silently like something
dangerous, perhaps a lion or a tiger on the spring. Presently
this attention was relaxed. They drew nearer together, fell to
speech in the Gaelic, and very cynically divided my property before
my eyes. It was my diversion in this time that I could watch from
my place the progress of my friend’s escape. I saw the boat come
to the brig and be hoisted in, the sails fill, and the ship pass
out seaward behind the isles and by North Berwick.</p>

<p>In the course of two hours or so, more and more ragged Highlandmen
kept collecting. Neil among the first, until the party must have
numbered near a score. With each new arrival there was a fresh
bout of talk, that sounded like complaints and explanations; but
I observed one thing, none of those who came late had any share
in the division of my spoils. The last discussion was very violent
and eager, so that once I thought they would have quarrelled;
on the heels of which their company parted, the bulk of them returning
westward in a troop, and only three, Neil and two others, remaining
sentries on the prisoner.</p>

<p>"I could name one who would be very ill pleased with your day’s
work, Neil Duncanson," said I, when the rest had moved away.</p>

<p>He assured me in answer I should be tenderly used, for he knew
he was "acquent wi’ the leddy."</p>

<p>This was all our talk, nor did any other son of man appear upon
that portion of the coast until the sun had gone down among the
Highland mountains, and the gloaming was beginning to grow dark.
At which hour I was aware of a long, lean, bony-like Lothian man
of a very swarthy countenance, that came towards us among the
bents on a farm horse.</p>

<p>"Lads," cried he, "has ye a paper like this?" and held up one
in his hand. Neil produced a second, which the newcomer studied
through a pair of horn spectacles, and saying all was right and
we were the folk he was seeking, immediately dismounted. I was
then set in his place, my feet tied under the horse’s belly, and
we set forth under the guidance of the Lowlander. His path must
have been very well chosen, for we met but one pair—a pair of
lovers—the whole way, and these, perhaps taking us to be free-traders,
fled on our approach. We were at one time close at the foot of
Berwick Law on the south side; at another, as we passed over some
open hills, I spied the lights of a clachan and the old tower
of a church among some trees not far off, but too far to cry for
help, if I had dreamed of it. At last we came again within sound
of the sea. There was moonlight, though not much; and by this
I could see the three huge towers and broken battlements of Tantallon,
that old chief place of the Red Douglases. The horse was picketed
in the bottom of the ditch to graze, and I was led within, and
forth into the court, and thence into the tumble-down stone hall.
Here my conductors built a brisk fire in the midst of the pavement,
for there was a chill in the night. My hands were loosed, I was
set by the wall in the inner end, and (the Lowlander having produced
provisions) I was given oatmeal bread and a pitcher of French
brandy. This done, I was left once more alone with my three Highlandmen.
They sat close by the fire drinking and talking; the wind blew
in by the breaches, cast about the smoke and flames, and sang
in the tops of the towers; I could hear the sea under the cliffs,
and, my mind being reassured as to my life, and my body and spirits
wearied with the day’s employment, I turned upon one side and
slumbered.</p>

<p>I had no means of guessing at what hour I was wakened, only the
moon was down and the fire was low. My feet were now loosed, and
I was carried through the ruins and down the cliff-side by a precipitous
path to where I found a fisher’s boat in a haven of the rocks.
This I was had on board of, and we began to put forth from the
shore in a fine starlight.</p>
