<p>Sheridan waited until he heard the sound of the outer door closing;
then he rose and pushed a tiny disk set in the wall. Jackson appeared.</p>

<p>"Has Bibbs got home from work?"</p>

<p>"Mist' Bibbs? No, suh."</p>

<p>"Tell him I want to see him, soon as he comes."</p>

<p>"Yessuh."</p>

<p>Sheridan returned to his chair and fixed his attention fiercely
upon the newspaper. He found it difficult to pursue the items
beyond their explanatory rubrics&mdash;there was nothing unusual or
startling to concentrate his attention:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>Bibbs came through the hall whistling, and entered the room briskly.
"Well, father, did you want me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Sit down." Sheridan got up, and Bibbs took a seat by the
fire, holding out his hands to the crackling blaze, for it was
cold outdoors.</p>

<p>"I came within seven of the shop record to-day," he said. "I
handled more strips than any other workman has any day this month.
The nearest to me is sixteen behind."</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed his father, greatly pleased. "What'd I tell
you? I'd like to hear Gurney hint again that I wasn't right in
sending you there &mdash;I would just like to hear him! And you&mdash;ain't
you ashamed of makin' such a fuss about it? Ain't you?"</p>

<p>"I didn't go at it in the right spirit the other time," Bibbs
said, smiling brightly, his face ruddy in the cheerful firelight.
"I didn't know the difference it meant to like a thing."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I've pretty thoroughly vindicated my judgement.
I guess I <em>HAVE! I </em>said the shop'd be good for you, and
it was. I said it wouldn't hurt you, and it hasn't. It's been
just exactly what I said it would be. Ain't that so?"</p>

<p>"Looks like it!" Bibbs agreed, gaily.</p>

<p>"Well, I'd like to know any place I been wrong, first and last!
Instead o' hurting you, it's been the makin' of you&mdash;physically.
You're a good inch taller'n what I am, and you'd be a bigger man
than what I am if you'd get some flesh on your bones; and you
<em>ARE </em>gettin' a little. Physically, it's started you out
to be the huskiest one o' the whole family. Now, then, mentally&mdash;that's
different. I don't say it unkindly, Bibbs, but you got to do something
for yourself mentally, just like what's begun physically. And
I'm goin' to help you."</p>

<p>Sheridan decided to sit down again. He brought his chair close
to his son's, and, leaning over, tapped Bibbs's knee confidentially.
"I got plans for you, Bibbs," he said.</p>

<p>Bibbs instantly looked thoroughly alarmed. He drew back. "I &mdash;I'm
all right now, father."</p>

<p>"Listen." Sheridan settled himself in his chair, and spoke in
the tone of a reasonable man reasoning. "Listen here, Bibbs. I
had another blow to-day, and it was a hard one and right in the
face, though I <em>HAVE </em>been expectin' it some little time
back. Well, it's got to be met. Now I'll be frank with you. As
I said a minute ago, mentally I couldn't ever called you exactly
strong. You been a little weak both ways, most of your life. Not
but what I think you <em>GOT </em>a mentality, if you'd learn
to use it. You got will-power, I'll say that for you. I never
knew boy or man that could be stubborner&mdash;never one in my life!
Now, then, you've showed you could learn to run that machine best
of any man in the shop, in no time at all. That looks to me like
you could learn to do other things. I don't deny but what it's
an encouragin' sign. I don't deny that, at all. Well, that helps
me to think the case ain't so hopeless as it looks. You're all
I got to meet this blow with, but maybe you ain't as poor material
as I thought. Your tellin' me about comin' within seven strips
of the shop's record to-day looks to me like encouragin' information
brought in at just about the right time. Now, then, I'm goin'
to give you a raise. I wanted to send you straight on up through
the shops&mdash;a year or two, maybe&mdash;but I can't do it. I lost Jim,
and now I've lost Roscoe. He's quit. He's laid down on me. If
he ever comes back at all, he'll be a long time pickin' up the
strings, and, anyway, he ain't the man I thought he was. I can't
count on him. I got to have <em>SOMEBODY I KNOW I </em>can count
on. And I'm down to this: you're my last chance. Bibbs, I got
to learn you to use what brains you got and see if we can't develop
'em a little. Who knows? And I'm goin' to put my time in on it.
I'm goin' to take you right down-town with ME, and I won't be
hard on you if you're a little slow at first. And I'm goin' to
do the big thing for you. I'm goin' to make you feel you got to
do the big thing for me, in return. I've vindicated my policy
with you about the shop, and now I'm goin' to turn right around
and swing you 'way over ahead of where the other boys started,
and I'm goin' to make an appeal to your ambition that'll make
you dizzy!" He tapped his son on the knee again. "Bibbs, I'm goin'
to start you off this way: I'm goin' to make you a director in
the Pump Works Company; I'm goin' to make you vice-president of
the Realty Company and a vice-president of the Trust Company!"</p>

<p>Bibbs jumped to his feet, blanched. "Oh no!" he cried.</p>

<p>Sheridan took his dismay to be the excitement of sudden joy.
"Yes, sir! And there's some pretty fat little salaries goes with
those vice-presidencies, and a pinch o' stock in the Pump Company
with the directorship. You thought I was pretty mean about the
shop&mdash;oh, I know you did!&mdash;but you see the old man can play it
both ways. And so right now, the minute you've begun to make good
the way I wanted you to, I deal from the new deck. And I'll keep
on handin' it out bigger and bigger every time you show me you're
big enough to play the hand I deal you. I'm startin' you with
a pretty big one, my boy!"</p>

<p>"But I don't&mdash;I don't &mdash;I don't want it!" Bibbs stammered.</p>

<p>"What'd you say?" Sheridan thought he had not heard aright.</p>

<p>"I don't want it, father. I thank you &mdash;I do thank you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sheridan looked perplexed. "What's the matter with you? Didn't
you understand what I was tellin' you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You sure? I reckon you didn't. I offered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, I know! But I can't take it."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" Sheridan was half amazed, half
suspicious. "Your head feel funny?"</p>

<p>"I've never been quite so sane in my life," said Bibbs, "as I
have lately. And I've got just what I want. I'm living exactly
the right life. I'm earning my daily bread, and I'm happy in doing
it. My wages are enough. I don't want any more money, and I don't
deserve any&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damnation!" Sheridan sprang up. "You've turned Socialist! You
been listening to those fellows down there, and you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I think there's a great deal in what they say, but
that isn't it."</p>

<p>Sheridan tried to restrain his growing fury, and succeeded partially.
"Then what is it? What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," his son returned, nervously. "Nothing&mdash;except that
I'm content. I don't want to change anything."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>Bibbs had the incredible folly to try to explain. "I'll tell
you, father, if I can. I know it may be hard to understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think it may be," said Sheridan, grimly. "What you say
usually is a <em>LITTLE </em>that way. Go on!"</p>

<p>Perturbed and distressed, Bibbs rose instinctively; he felt himself
at every possible disadvantage. He was a sleeper clinging to a
dream&mdash;a rough hand stretched to shake him and waken him. He went
to a table and made vague drawings upon it with a finger, and
as he spoke he kept his eyes lowered. "You weren't altogether
right about the shop&mdash;that is, in one way you weren't, father."
He glanced up apprehensively. Sheridan stood facing him, expressionless,
and made no attempt to interrupt. "That's difficult to explain,"
Bibbs continued, lowering his eyes again, to follow the tracings
of his finger. "I &mdash;I believe the shop might have done for
me this time if I hadn't&mdash;if something hadn't helped me to&mdash;oh,
not only to bear it, but to be happy in it. Well, I AM happy in
it. I want to go on just as I am. And of all things on earth that
I don't want, I don't want to live a business life &mdash;I don't
want to be drawn into it. I don't think it IS living&mdash;and now
I AM living. I have the healthful toil&mdash;and I can think. In business
as important as yours I couldn't think anything but business.
I don't &mdash;I don't think making money is worth while."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Sheridan, curtly, as Bibbs paused timidly.</p>

<p>"It hasn't seemed to get anywhere, that I can see," said Bibbs.
"You think this city is rich and powerful&mdash;but what's the use
of its being rich and powerful? They don't teach the children
any more in the schools because the city is rich and powerful.
They teach them more than they used to because some people&mdash;not
rich and powerful people&mdash;have thought the thoughts to teach the
children. And yet when you've been reading the paper I've heard
you objecting to the children being taught anything except what
would help them to make money. You said it was wasting the taxes.
You want them taught to make a living, but not to live. When I
was a little boy this wasn't an ugly town; now it's hideous. What's
the use of being big just to be hideous? I mean I don't think
all this has meant really going ahead&mdash;it's just been getting
bigger and dirtier and noisier. Wasn't the whole country happier
and in many ways wiser when it was smaller and cleaner and quieter
and kinder? I know you think I'm an utter fool, father, but, after
all, though, aren't business and politics just the housekeeping
part of life? And wouldn't you despise a woman that not only made
her housekeeping her ambition, but did it so noisily and dirtily
that the whole neighborhood was in a continual turmoil over it?
And suppose she talked and thought about her housekeeping all
the time, and was always having additions built to her house when
she couldn't keep clean what she already had; and suppose, with
it all, she made the house altogether unpeaceful and unlivable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just one minute!" Sheridan interrupted, adding, with terrible
courtesy, "If you will permit me? Have you ever been right about
anything?"</p>

<p>"I don't quite&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I ask the simple question: Have you ever been right about anything
whatever in the course of your life? Have you ever been right
upon any subject or question you've thought about and talked about?
Can you mention one single time when you were proved to be right?"</p>

<p>He was flourishing the bandaged hand as he spoke, but Bibbs said
only, "If I've always been wrong before, surely there's more chance
that I'm right about this. It seems reasonable to suppose something
would be due to bring up my average."</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought you wouldn't see the point. And there's another
you probably couldn't see, but I'll take the liberty to mention
it. You been balkin' all your life. Pretty much everything I ever
wanted you to do, you'd let out <em>SOME </em>kind of a holler,
like you are now&mdash;and yet I can't seem to remember once when you
didn't have to lay down and do what I said. But go on with your
remarks about our city and the business of this country. Go on!"</p>

<p>"I don't want to be a part of it," said Bibbs, with unwonted
decision. "I want to keep to myself, and I'm doing it now. I couldn't,
if I went down there with you. I'd be swallowed into it. I don't
care for money enough to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," his father interrupted, still dangerously quiet. "You've
never had to earn a living. Anybody could tell that by what you
say. Now, let me remind you: you're sleepin' in a pretty good
bed; you're eatin' pretty fair food; you're wearin' pretty fine
clothes. Just suppose one o' these noisy housekeepers&mdash;me, for
instance&mdash;decided to let you do your own housekeepin'. May I ask
what your proposition would be?"</p>

<p>"I'm earning nine dollars a week," said Bibbs, sturdily. "It's
enough. I shouldn't mind at all."</p>

<p>"Who's payin' you that nine dollars a week?"</p>

<p>"My work!" Bibbs answered. "And I've done so well on that clipping-machine
I believe I could work up to fifteen or even twenty a week at
another job. I could be a fair plumber in a few months, I'm sure.
I'd rather have a trade than be in business &mdash;I should, infinitely!"</p>

<p>"You better set about learnin' one pretty dam' quick!" But Sheridan
struggled with his temper and again was partially successful in
controlling it. "You better learn a trade over Sunday, because
you're either goin' down with me to my office Monday morning&mdash;or&mdash;you
can go to plumbing!"</p>

<p>"All right," said Bibbs, gently. "I can get along."</p>

<p>Sheridan raised his hands sardonically, as in prayer. "O God,"
he said, "this boy was crazy enough before he began to earn his
nine dollars a week, and now his money's gone to his head! Can't
You do nothin' for him?" Then he flung his hands apart, palms
outward, in a furious gesture of dismissal. "Get out o' this room!
You got a skull that's thicker'n a whale's thigh-bone, but it's
cracked spang all the way across! You hated the machine-shop so
bad when I sent you there, you went and stayed sick for over two
years&mdash;and now, when I offer to take you out of it and give you
the mint, you holler for the shop like a calf for its mammy! You're
cracked! Oh, but I got a fine layout here! One son died, one quit,
and one's a loon! The loon's all I got left! H. P. Ellersly's
wife had a crazy brother, and they undertook to keep him at the
house. First morning he was there he walked straight though a
ten-dollar plate-glass window out into the yard. He says, 'Oh,
look at the pretty dandelion!' That's what you're doin'! You want
to spend your life sayin', 'Oh, look at the pretty dandelion!'
and you don't care a tinker's dam' what you bust! Well, mister,
loon or no loon, cracked and crazy or whatever you are, I'll take
you with me Monday morning, and I'll work you and learn you&mdash;yes,
and I'll lam you, if I got to&mdash;until I've made something out of
you that's fit to be called a business man! I'll keep at you while
I'm able to stand, and if I have to lay down to die I'll be whisperin'
at you till they get the embalmin'-fluid into me! Now go on, and
don't let me hear from you again till you can come and tell me
you've waked up, you poor, pitiful, dandelion-pickin' <em>SLEEP-WALKER</em>!"</p>

<p>Bibbs gave him a queer look. There was something like reproach
in it, for once; but there was more than that&mdash;he seemed to be
startled by his father's last word.</p>
