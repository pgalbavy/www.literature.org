<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>And so it came about that on a sharp, crisp day early in the
month of October, two sturdy youths left the Union Pacific train
at Fort Steele, which is situated in a broad depression between
two divisions of the Wind River Mountains, themselves forming
a part of the vast Rocky Mountain chain, which, under different
names, stretches along the western portion of the two continents
from the Arctic Ocean on the north to the extreme southern end
of South America.</p>

<p>Like the sensible youths they were, Jack Dudley and Fred Greenwood
had made the fullest preparation possible for the experience which
was destined to prove tenfold more eventful than either anticipated.
Mr. Dudley, in accordance with his promise, had presented each
with a fine repeating Winchester rifle, an excellent revolver,
an abundant supply of cartridges, and various knick-knacks which
the hunter is sure to find are more in the nature of necessities
than luxuries.</p>

<p>They had tough corduroy suits, a material which, as everyone
knows, wears like leather, though it is unpopular in the West
because of its unpleasant odor when wet. From the knees downward
the lower part of the legs were protected by strong leathern leggings,
and the shoes were made for wear rather than display. The coats
were rather short and gathered at the waists by a belt, while
beneath the garment it was intended to wear the cartridge-belt.
The revolver rested in a sheath, instead of being thrust into
a trouser's-pocket at the hip, while their hats suggested the
sombrero pattern, so popular among cowboys and cattlemen. The
brim was broad and stiff, so that it was not liable to bother
their vision when the wind was blowing, and it could be depended
upon to protect the eyes and face from the sun and rain. Their
whole outfit, in short, was strong, comfortable and serviceable.</p>

<p>The two were generously furnished with money, while Mr. Dudley
arranged with a banker at Laramie City to furnish the boys with
whatever funds they might need through accident or robbery. They
were going into a region where there were many lawless characters,
and everything was done to provide against all possible contingencies.</p>

<p>Their extra clothing and articles were contained in a couple
of valises, which were put off the train upon the lonely platform
at Fort Steele. But while this marked the farthest distance they
could travel by rail, a long ride still confronted them before
reaching the ranch, which was almost half-way between the railroad
and the Big Horn Mountains to the northeast. Several streams had
to be crossed, the country in many places was rough, and there
was no stage line to help them. All this, however, had been discounted
before the boys left the city of Chicago, and what they encountered
was only what was expected, and only that for which they were
prepared.</p>

<p>Word having been sent in advance of their expected arrival, the
first act of the youths was to look around for the man or men
who were to meet and conduct them to the ranch. A few people were
moving about the long, low platform, several in the uniform of
United States infantry and cavalry, while a couple of Indians
in blankets, untidy and sullen, surveyed them with scowls. Few
passengers were in the habit of leaving the train at this point,
so that some curiosity on the part of the loungers was natural.
Perhaps the agent at the station suspected them of being runaways
whose heads had been turned by stories of wild adventure, and
who had set out to annihilate the aborigines of the West; but
if such a fancy came to the man, it must have vanished when he
noticed their intelligent appearance and the completeness of their
outfit. Boys who start on such whimsical careers are never rightly
prepared, and have no conception of the absurdity of their schemes
until it is forced upon them by sad and woeful experience.</p>

<p>"Are you looking for any one?" asked the agent; respectfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Jack Dudley; "we are on our way to a ranch
which lies to the eastward of Camp Brown, not far from Wind River."</p>

<p>"May I ask your errand thither?"</p>

<p>"My father is part owner of the ranch, and we wish to visit it
for a few weeks."</p>

<p>"Ah, you are the young men that Hank Hazletine was asking about
yesterday. He has charge of Bowman's ranch."</p>

<p>"That's the place. What has become of Mr. Hazletine?"</p>

<p>"I think he is over at the fort, and will soon be here. He brought
a couple of horses for you to ride. Ah, here he comes now."</p>

<p>The boys saw the man at the same moment. He was walking rapidly
from the direction of the fort, and looking curiously at the youths,
who surveyed him with interest as he approached. He was full-bearded,
tall, and as straight as an arrow, dressed in cowboy costume,
and the picture of rugged strength and activity. His manner was
that of a man who, having made a mistake as to the hour of the
arrival of the train, was doing his best to make up for lost time.</p>

<p>Stepping upon the long, low platform, he walked toward the lads,
his Winchester in his left hand, while he extended his right in
salutation.</p>

<p>"Howdy?" he said, heartily, as he took the hand of Fred Greenwood,
who advanced several paces to meet him. "I reckon you're the younkers
I'm waiting for."</p>

<p>"If you are Hank Hazletine, you are the man."</p>

<p>"That's the name I gin'rally go by; which one of you is Jack
Dudley?"</p>

<p>"I am," replied that young gentleman.</p>

<p>"Then t'other one is Fred Greenwood, eh?" he asked, turning toward
the younger.</p>

<p>"You have our names right."</p>

<p>"Glad to know it; I got your letter and looked for you yesterday;
have been loafing 'round here since then."</p>

<p>"We were not sure of the exact time of our arrival and missed
it by twenty-four hours," said Jack; "I hope it caused you no
inconvenience."</p>

<p>"Not at all&mdash;not at all. Wal, I s'pose you're ready to start
for the ranch, younkers?"</p>

<p>"We are at your disposal; we have quite a long ride before us."</p>

<p>"We have; it'll take us two or three days to git there, if all
goes well."</p>

<p>"Suppose all doesn't go well?" remarked Fred.</p>

<p>"We shall be longer on the road; and if it goes too bad we'll
never git there; but I ain't looking for anything like that. Where's
your baggage?"</p>

<p>Jack pointed to the two plump valises lying on the platform,
near the little building.</p>

<p>"That and what we have on us and in our hands make up our worldly
possessions."</p>

<p>"That's good," said Hazletine. "I was afeard you might bring
a load of trunks, which we'd had a purty time getting to the ranch;
but there won't be any trouble in managing them; I'll be right
back."</p>

<p>He turned away, and soon reappeared, mounted on a fine, wiry
pony, and leading on either side a tough little animal, saddled
and bridled and ready for the boys.</p>

<p>"There ain't any better animals in Wyoming or Colorado," he explained;
"they can travel fast and fur a long time. We'll strap on that
stuff and be off."</p>

<p>There was no trouble in securing the baggage to the rear of the
saddles, when Jack and Fred swung themselves upon the backs of
the ponies, adjusted their Winchesters across the saddles in front,
following the suggestions of Hazletine, and announced themselves
ready to set out on the long ride northward. The animals struck
into an easy canter, and a few minutes later all signs of civilization
were left behind them.</p>

<p>The boys were in buoyant spirits. There was just enough coolness
in the air to make the exercise invigorating. Here and there a
few snowy flecks dotted the blue sky, but the sun shone with undimmed
splendor, the warmth slightly increasing as the orb climbed the
heavens. To the northward the undulating plain was unbroken by
hill or stream, so far as the eye could note, while to the eastward
the prospect was similar, though they knew that the North Platte
curved over in that direction, and, after winding around the upper
end of the Laramie Mountains, joined the main stream far over
in Nebraska.</p>

<p>To the westward the prospect was romantic and awe-inspiring.
The Wind River range towered far up in the sky in rugged grandeur,
following a course almost parallel with their own, though gradually
trending more to the left, in the direction of Yellowstone Park.
The snow-crowned peaks looked like vast banks of clouds in the
sky, while the craggy portions below the frost-line were mellowed
by the distance and softly tinted in the clear, crystalline atmosphere.
The mountains formed a grand background to the picture which more
closely environed them.</p>

<p>As the three galloped easily forward they kept nearly abreast,
with the ranchman between them. He was in a pleasant mood, and
seemed to have formed a fancy for the youths, who felt a natural
admiration for the big, muscular veteran of the plains and mountains.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, in answer to their inquiries; "I've spent all
my life as a cattleman, cowboy, hunter or trapper. I left the
States with my parents, when a small younker, with an emigrant
train fur Californy. Over in Utah, when crawling through the mountains,
and believing the worst of the bus'ness was over, the Injins come
down on us one rainy night and wiped out nearly all. My father,
mother and an older brother was killed, and I don't understand
how I got off with my scalp, but I did, with half a dozen others."</p>

<p>"Did you go on to California?"</p>

<p>"No; I've never been in that country, which I s'pose you'll think
strange; but I was on my way there, when I met the great scout
Kit Carson and several hunters. They took me along with 'em, and
the next twenty years of my life was spent in New Mexico, Arizona
and Texas. Since then I've ranged from the Panhandle to Montana,
most of the time in the cattle bus'ness."</p>

<p>"At what are you engaged just now?" inquired Jack.</p>

<p>"The same&mdash;that is, the cattle bus'ness. You may know that after
thousands of the critters have spent the summer in Texas, New
Mexico and Arizona, they drive 'em north into Wyoming, Montana
and the Dakotas, to git their finishing touches. The grazing is
so much better than in the south that in a few months they're
ready for the market, and are either killed and their carcasses
shipped to the East, or they are took there by train in as fine
condition as anybody could ask. You obsarve that the grass under
our feet is powerful good."</p>

<p>The boys replied that it seemed to be.</p>

<p>"Wal, there's hundreds of thousands of acres better than this;
there's thirty thousand of 'em in Bowman's ranch, where we're
going, and it's the best kind of grazing land."</p>

<p>"I believe it extends to the Wind River Mountains," said Jack.</p>

<p>"It takes in a part of the foot-hills; there are plenty of streams
there, and some of the finest grass in the world."</p>

<p>Jack Dudley did not forget the real object of the coming of himself
and companion to this section, and he could not gather the information
too soon.</p>

<p>"How does Bowman's ranch compare with others in Central Wyoming?"</p>

<p>"You may ride over the whole State without finding a better.
If you doubt it, look at the country for yourself."</p>

<p>"We don't doubt anything you tell us," said Fred Greenwood. "I
suppose you know that Mr. Dudley, the father of my friend, owns
half the ranch?"</p>

<p>"I've heerd that."</p>

<p>"He didn't intend to buy it, but matters so shaped themselves
that he couldn't help doing so. Before selling it, he sent us
to take a look at it and find out whether it is all that was claimed.
We have come to do that, but, at the same time, are eager to have
some hunting among the mountains."</p>

<p>"You won't have any trouble about that. As I was saying, we're
close to the mountains, and when you're ready I'll go with you,
and promise that you'll have something to talk about as long as
you live."</p>

<p>The eyes of the boys sparkled as they looked across at each other,
and Jack said:</p>

<p>"Nothing could delight us more. We need a veteran like yourself,
and are happy to know you can serve us."</p>

<p>"How many months can you stay in Wyoming?"</p>

<p>"How many months?" laughed Jack. "We are under promise to be
back at school in New York on the first of November."</p>

<p>"Whew! I wish the time was longer."</p>

<p>"So do we; but we had a hard enough task to get the month, so
we must make the best use of it."</p>

<p>"Wal, we can crowd a good 'eal into two or three weeks, and I
won't let you go to sleep in the daytime &mdash;I'll promise you
that."</p>

<p>Hazletine produced a brierwood pipe and pressed some tobacco
in the bowl. Although the motion of their ponies caused quite
a brisk breeze, he lighted a match and communicated the flame
to the tobacco without checking the speed of his animal. Then
he glanced admiringly to the right and left, at his companions.</p>

<p>"You're a couple of as fine-looking younkers as I've seed in
a long time; but you're almost as tall as me, and it seems to
me you orter be through with school."</p>

<p>"We expect to stay in school another year and then spend four
in college, after which several years will be needed to get ready
for some profession."</p>

<p>"Great Jiminy!" exclaimed the astonished ranchman; "you must
be powerful dumb, or else there's more to larn than I ever dreamed
of."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jack, with a laugh at the simplicity of the fellow,
"there are plenty of boys a great deal smarter then we, but the
smartest of them can spend their whole lives in study and not
learn a hundredth part of what is to be learned."</p>

<p>Hank puffed his pipe slowly and looked seriously at the youth
for a minute without speaking. Then he said, as if partly speaking
to himself:</p>

<p>"I s'pose that's so; a chap can go on larning forever, and then
die without knowing half of it. I never had much chance at eddycation,
but managed to pick up 'nough to read and write a letter and to
do a little figgering, but that's all."</p>

<p>"That is what you may call your book education; but how much
more you know of the rivers, the mountains, the climate, the soil,
the game, the Indians, and everything relating to the western
half of our country! In that respect we are but as babes compared
with you."</p>

<p>"I s'pose that's so, too," replied the hunter, evidently impressed
by the fact that these youths were destined, if their lives were
spared, to become excellent scholars. He was so thoughtful that
they did not interrupt his meditations, and for a considerable
while the three rode in silence.</p>

<p>It need not be said that Jack and Fred kept their wits about
them and took note of everything in their field of vision. The
season had been an unusually favorable one for Wyoming, the rains
having been all that was required to make the grass succulent,
nourishing and abundant. They could have turned their ponies loose
at any point, after leaving the railway behind them, and the animals
would have been able to crop their fill. It was the same over
hundreds of square miles, a fact which readily explains why many
portions of Wyoming rank as the best grazing country in the world.</p>

<p>It was not yet noon when they rode down a slight declivity to
a stream several rods in width. The water was so clear that the
bottom could be plainly seen from their saddles, the depth being
no more than two or three feet. The ponies paused to drink, and,
as they emerged on the other side and started up the gentle slope,
Hazletine suggested that for a time at least they should be held
down to a walk.</p>

<p>One anxiety began to impress itself upon the minds of Jack and
Fred. They were not only hungrier than they had been for months,
but that hunger was increasing at an alarming rate. Neither had
brought any lunch with them, and they wondered how food was to
be obtained. Jack almost fainted at the awful suspicion that perhaps
their friend intended to break them in by making the two or three
days' journey to the ranch without eating anything at all!</p>

<p>"I suppose it would be no trouble for <em>him</em>," was the
lugubrious thought of the youth, "but it will be the death of
us!"</p>

<p>Happily this dread proved unfounded. The sun had hardly crossed
the meridian when both lads were thrilled by the declaration of
Hazletine:</p>

<p>"Wal, if you younkers are as hungry as me, we'll have a bite."</p>

<p>They were in the middle of the undulating plain, with no wood
or water in sight; but that was a small matter. In a twinkling
all three were out of their saddles, and the guide unstrapped
a large bundle from its fastening to the saddle of his pony. This,
being unwrapped, disclosed a goodly portion of cooked and tender
steak and plenty of well-baked brown bread. Furthermore, there
were a couple of bottles of milk&mdash;enough for two meals at least.</p>

<p>These having been placed on the grass, the bits were removed
from the mouths of their horses, who were allowed to graze while
their masters were partaking of one of the most enjoyable meals
they had ever eaten.</p>

<p>"If I'd expected to be alone," explained Hazletine, "I wouldn't
have brought this stuff with me, but we may not see a maverick
or any game all the way home. I wouldn't mind it, but I don't
s'pose you are used to it."</p>

<p>"I should say not," replied Jack, as well as he could, while
his mouth was filled with bread, meat and milk; "I'm hungry enough
to eat a mule."</p>

<p>"And I feel as if I could chew his saddle," added Fred, laboring
under the same difficulty in speaking clearly. "If our appetites
keep up at this rate, there will be a shrinkage among the cattle
in Wyoming before we go home."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by a maverick?" asked Jack of their guide.</p>

<p>"It's an unbranded cow or calf that don't b'long to nobody, and
consequently it don't make no difference whether nobody or somebody
brands or kills it."</p>

<p>The rhetoric of this sentence may not have been faultless, but
its meaning was clear to the boys. They ate until they wished
no more, and were vastly relieved to note that something was left
for another meal.</p>

<p>"That'll see us through till morning," said Jack, "but how about
to-morrow and the next day?"</p>

<p>"If we don't see anything to kill, we must wait till we git to
the ranch."</p>

<p>Fred groaned.</p>

<p>"You'll have to tie me in the saddle, for I shan't be able to
sit up."</p>

<p>The smile on the face of the guide raised the hope that he was
not in earnest in making this dreadful announcement, but neither
Jack nor Fred were quite easy in mind.</p>

<p>The halt was less than an hour, when the three were in the saddle
again. Hazletine, instead of pressing directly toward the ranch
that was their destination, bore to the left, thus approaching
the Wind River range.</p>

<p>"There's a little settlement off to the right," he said, "of
the name of Sweetwater; we could reach it by night, but it takes
us a good many miles out of our path, and there's nothing to be
gained by losing the time."</p>

<p>"Are you following a straight course to the ranch?"</p>

<p>"Pretty near; but I'm edging to the left, toward the foot-hills,
'cause there's better camping-ground over there."</p>

<p>This was satisfactory, and the youths were not the ones to question
a decision of so experienced a guide and mountaineer. Besides,
they had hope that one reason for the slight change of course
was that it increased the chance of obtaining game. For the present,
the question of food supply was the most absorbing one that demanded
attention. Other matters could wait, but a sturdy, growing lad
finds his appetite something whose cravings can be soothed only
by the one method that nature intended.</p>
