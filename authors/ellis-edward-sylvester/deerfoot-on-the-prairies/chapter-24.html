<p><em>THE </em>sound was like that of a score of bison charging
through the undergrowth. The affrighted lads glanced around and
saw the grizzly crashing down upon them. Possibly he had awakened
to the fancy that they were enemies, and one of them had sought
to do him harm. At any rate, here he was!</p>

<p>George and Victor instinctively did what any two persons with
loaded guns in their hands will do when assailed by a furious
wild beast. They brought their weapons to a level and blazed away
straight into his face, but they might as well have sent their
bullets against a solid rock for all the good it accomplished
in the way of checking the rush of the monster, who emitted his
hog-like grunts and swept down upon them like a whirlwind.</p>

<p>Without any thought of the wisdom of what they were doing, the
brothers separated, their line of flight being almost at right
angles from the beginning. Since it was impossible for the beast
to pursue both at the same time, he had to select his victim.
His choice fell upon Victor, but it is not to be supposed that
he recognized him as the original offender in this business.</p>

<p>The gait of a grizzly bear, or for that matter of any of his
species, is awkward when he is running at full speed. He has a
grotesque way of doubling and humping his body, which seems fatal
to high speed. Nevertheless, he can get forward at an astonishing
rate, faster than a man can run at his best. If it should ever
fall to your lot to meet a grizzly in his western haunts, don’t
fancy you can escape him simply by running. Keep out of his way
from the first.</p>

<p>George Shelton ran and tumbled and scrambled over the rough ground
for a considerable distance before he glanced behind him. Then
he discovered he was not pursued. Panting from his exertions,
he halted and began reloading his gun with a haste which made
the work doubly as long as it would have lasted on any other occasion.
As soon as his weapon was ready he hurried back to the help of
his brother, who was having a perilous time indeed. As he ran
he called as loud as he could for Deerfoot and Mul-tal-la, for
the crisis could not have been more serious.</p>

<p>Less than fifty feet separated Victor Shelton from the grizzly
when the race for life opened. For a little way the ground was
favorable, and the lad ran fully as fast as when fleeing from
the wounded antelope. A glance over his shoulder showed the vast
hulk doubling and lumbering along and gaining rapidly. In a straightaway
race the fugitive was sure to be overtaken within a few minutes.</p>

<p>Something must be done without an instant’s delay. There was
no time to reload his old-fashioned gun, nor could he descry any
refuge. A sapling appeared a little to his right, but he dared
not resort to that. He believed the bear would jerk it up by the
roots to get at him, and he was probably right in his supposition.
So he kept on.</p>

<p>The situation was so critical that Victor Shelton did a desperate
thing. Throwing away the rifle which impeded his flight, he turned
to the left and headed, still on a dead run, for the edge of a
cliff. Of the depth of the ravine beyond he had not the faintest
idea. It might be a few feet or it might be a hundred. He had
no time to find out. Over he must go, and without checking his
flight in the least, he dashed to the edge and made the leap.</p>

<p>Providentially the distance was barely a score of feet, and instead
of alighting upon a rock almost in his line of flight, he landed
on the comparatively soft earth. He was severely shaken, but in
his fright he heeded it not. He fell forward on his hands and
knees, scrambled up instantly, and was off again. He had dropped
into a gorge only a few yards in width, which wound indefinitely
to the right and left. There was no way of knowing the better
line of flight, and he turned to the right.</p>

<p>He had gone only a few paces when he looked back to see what
had become of the grizzly. He had stopped on the margin of the
bluff and was looking down at the terrified youngster, who was
striving so frantically to get beyond his reach. For a moment
Victor believed the brute was about to follow him; but instead
of doing that he lumbered, growling and grunting, along the side
of the ravine, easily keeping pace with the fugitive, despite
the fact that the surface was more broken than in the bottom of
the gorge.</p>

<p>Still, so long as the relative positions of the grizzly and fugitive
remained the same, no harm could come to the latter. But a change
speedily took place.</p>

<p>Victor had not gone far when to his dismay he noticed that the
ground over which he was running began to slope upward. If this
continued he must soon rise to the level of the bear, who acted
as if he saw how the situation favored him. The plum which for
the moment was out of his reach must soon pass into his maws.</p>

<p>The fugitive slackened his speed, wondering what he could do.
He glanced at the opposite side of the ravine in search of a way
of climbing out and thus interposing the chasm between him and
his enemy. But the wall was perpendicular and comparatively smooth.
If he kept on he would soon be brought face to face with the beast.
He must turn back, with no certainty that the same hopeless condition
would not confront him in that direction.</p>

<p>Just then a shout fell upon his ear. George Shelton appeared
on the edge of the cliff within a hundred feet of the bear. A
flash and report followed. He had fired at their terrible enemy
and the bullet could not miss; but the grizzly seemed as unaware
of it as of the former pin pricks. Giving no heed to the shouts,
the report and the slight sting, he saw only the lad below him,
upon whom he had centered his wrath.</p>

<p>Victor had halted, glanced up, and was in the act of turning
back over his own trail when the brute took advantage of the decreased
depth of the gorge, leaped the short distance necessary to land
him on the bottom, not more than eight or ten feet below, and
tumbling, rolling, grunting, scrambling and flinging the pebbles
and dirt in every direction, renewed his direct pursuit of the
fugitive, with less distance than before separating them.</p>

<p>All that Victor could do was to run, and if ever a youngster
did that it was he. Unquestionably he must have exceeded the pace
he showed when fleeing from the wounded antelope. And yet it did
not equal that of the grizzly, who lumbered forward like a locomotive
running down a panic-stricken dog between the rails.</p>

<p>Suddenly another form dropped lightly into the gorge, landing
on his feet a few paces behind the fugitive, who, as he sped past,
recognized Deerfoot the Shawanoe. Neither spoke, for it was not
necessary. The lad did not slacken his speed, which was at the
highest tension, and the lithe young Indian, standing motionless,
raised his rifle and fired at the grizzly when the space separating
the two was barely a rod.</p>

<p>Deerfoot aimed at one of the eyes. He must have brought down
the terrific brute had not the latter at the very instant of the
discharge started to rise on his hind legs, as his species do
when about to seize their victim. Despite the brief distance separating
the two there was just enough deflection in the aim to save the
eye. The bullet struck below that organ and did no more harm than
the missiles that had preceded it.</p>

<p>But Deerfoot had interposed between his friend and the grizzly,
and the fight was now between him and the furious Goliath. Never
was a more thrilling sight witnessed than that upon which George
Shelton gazed from the top of the ravine, and which his brother
viewed from a safe point within the gorge.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe saw on the instant the cause of his failure to kill
the bear. His gun was of no further use for the time, and, like
Victor Shelton, he flung it aside. He did not doubt that he could
outrun the grizzly in a fair race, and he would have fled had
he thought Victor was beyond reach, but there was no saying whether
the gorge was not in the nature of a blind alley or cage, from
which the lad could not escape. To save him the Shawanoe held
his ground.</p>

<p>At the instant of flinging aside his rifle Deerfoot drew his
knife from his girdle and gripped it in his good left hand. The
grizzly, as I have said, had risen on his haunches and reached
out for his victim, but the space was too great. He sagged down
on all fours, plunged a few paces forward, and reared again.</p>

<p>As he went up he must have caught the flash of flying black hair,
of a fringed hunting shirt and a gleaming face. And as he saw
all this like a phantom of his dull brain, he awoke to the fact
that a dagger was driven with merciless force into his chest and
withdrawn again, both movements being of lightning-like quickness.</p>

<p>He had seen that face almost against his nose, and the ponderous
fore legs circled outward and swept together in a clasp that seemingly
would have crushed a stone statue had it been caught by those
mighty legs. But Deerfoot ducked with inimitable agility and leaped
back a dozen feet.</p>

<p>If the grizzly had not felt the bullets he now felt that knife
thrust, and all the tempestuous fury of his nature was roused.
He dropped on all fours, charged forward, rose again and grasped
at the audacious individual that had seriously wounded him and
dared still to keep his place an arm’s length away.</p>

<p>Precisely that which took place before occurred again. As the
shaggy monster reared, his head towering far above that of the
Shawanoe, the latter bounded forward past the guard, as it may
be called, and drove his dripping knife with fierce power into
the massive hulk, dropping and slipping beyond grasp before the
brute could touch him.</p>

<p>Deerfoot knew where to thrust to reach the seat of life, but
the enormous size of the grizzly actually seemed to hold it beyond
reach of an ordinary weapon, for after several blows the bear
showed no evidence of harm beyond that caused by the crimson staining
of his great hairy coat. Apparently he was as strong as ever.</p>

<p>George and Victor Shelton held their breath at times when viewing
this remarkable combat. They knew that if the bear once seized
the Shawanoe he would not live a minute. Repeatedly it looked
as if the youth had been caught. Once when the huge fore leg showed
outside the shoulder of Deerfoot and seemingly against it, and
his head almost touched the snout of the bear, both lads uttered
a wail of agony, and George, from his place at the top of the
gorge, called to his brother below:</p>

<p>"Poor Deerfoot! He is gone!"</p>

<p>"So he is!" chuckled Victor; "gone from the claws of the grizzly."</p>

<p>Just then Mul-tal-la hurried forward to the side of George Shelton.
The youth suspected the truth. The Blackfoot, although ordinarily
a brave man, had no wish for a close acquaintance with so overwhelming
a specimen of "Old Ephraim," as he is now often called. He knew
too well the tremendous prowess of the monarch of the western
solitudes.</p>

<p>But Mul-tal-la could not stay in the back ground when his friend
was in danger. Standing beside George Shelton, it took but a glance
for him to understand the situation. Deerfoot was engaged in a
hand-to-hand fight with the most formidable grizzly bear upon
which the Blackfoot had ever looked or of which he had ever heard.</p>

<p>A minute told the Blackfoot further that the youth was certain
to win, for, while he was continually thrusting and wounding his
antagonist, who must soon succumb, the latter had not harmed a
hair of the other’s head.</p>

<p>To such a struggle there could be but one issue, provided no
accident intervened. But a mishap is always possible in the case
of the bravest and most skilful combatant. Deerfoot might slip
at a critical moment and be caught. Amazing as was his prowess,
he was not infallible, and death was likely to seize him at any
moment.</p>

<p>The action of the Blackfoot, therefore, was to be commended,
when he knelt on one knee and aimed with the utmost care at the
brute. While he and the youth were interlocked there was danger
of injuring Deerfoot. Mul-tal-la, therefore, waited until a brief
space separated the two and just before the Shawanoe made another
bound forward.</p>

<p>Mul-tal-la held his aim for several minutes, for he was resolved
not to make any mistake. He aimed just behind the ear, and when
he pressed the trigger the little sphere of lead bored its way
into a vital part, and then it was all over.</p>

<p>Deerfoot had struck again and leaped back when he heard the report
of the rifle, saw the outreaching paws droop, the snout dip, and
the mountainous mass sag downwards and sideways, tumble over,
and that was the end.</p>

<p>"Mul-tal-la only hastened the death of the bear", remarked the
Blackfoot when he and the boys clambered down into the ravine
and stood beside the victor; "my brother had done the work, and
the bear could not have lasted much longer."</p>

<p>"Perhaps my brother is right," replied the Shawanoe. Then he
looked sternly at the lads and added:</p>

<p>"If my brothers do not heed the words of Deerfoot he will not
be their friend."</p>

<p>The boys succeeded after much talking in putting matters in such
a light that Deerfoot finally agreed to soften his rebuke, though
they felt it hardly the less keenly.</p>
