<p>At 2.30 a little party met together in the Council Chamber: Bundle,
Virginia, Superintendent Battle, M. Lemoine and Anthony Cade.</p>

<p>"No good waiting until we can get hold of Mr. Lomax," said Battle.
"This is the kind of business one wants to get on with quickly."</p>

<p>"If you’ve got any idea that Prince Michael was murdered by some
one who got in this way, you’re wrong," said Bundle. "It can’t
be done. The other end’s blocked completely."</p>

<p>"There is no question of that, milady," said Lemoine quickly.
"It is quite a different search that we make."</p>

<p>"Looking for something, are you?" asked Bundle quickly. "Not
the historic what-not, by any chance?"</p>

<p>Lemoine looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Explain yourself, Bundle," said Virginia encouragingly. "You
can when you try."</p>

<p>"The thingummybob," said Bundle. "The historic diamond of purple
princes that was pinched in the dark ages before I grew to years
of discretion."</p>

<p>"Who told you this, Lady Eileen?" asked Battle.</p>

<p>"I’ve always known. One of the footmen told me when I was twelve
years old."</p>

<p>"A footman," said Battle. "Lord! I’d like Mr. Lomax to have heard
that!"</p>

<p>"Is it one of George’s closely guarded secrets?" asked Bundle.
"How perfectly screaming! I never really thought it was true.
George always was an ass—he must know that servants always know
everything."</p>

<p>She went across to the Holbein portrait, touched a spring concealed
somewhere at the side of it, and immediately, with a creaking
noise, a section of the panelling swung inward, revealing a dark
opening.</p>

<p>"Entrez, Messieurs et Mesdames," said Bundle dramatically. "Walk
up, walk up, dearies. Best show of the season, and only a tanner."</p>

<p>Both Lemoine and Battle were provided with torches. They entered
the dark aperture first, the others close on their heels.</p>

<p>"Air’s nice and fresh," remarked Battle. "Must be ventilated
somehow."</p>

<p>He walked on ahead. The floor was of rough uneven stone, but
the walls were bricked. As Bundle had said, the passage extended
for a bare hundred yards. Then it came to an abrupt end with a
fallen heap of masonry. Battle satisfied himself that there was
no way of egress beyond, and then spoke over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"We’ll go back, if you please. I wanted just to spy out the land,
so to speak."</p>

<p>In a few minutes they were back again at the panelled entrance.</p>

<p>"We’ll start from here," said Battle. "Seven straight, eight
left, three right. Take the first as paces."</p>

<p>He paced seven steps carefully, and bending down examined the
ground.</p>

<p>"About right, I should fancy. At one time or another, there’s
been a chalk mark made here. Now then, eight left. That’s not
paces, the passage is only wide enough to go Indian file anyway."</p>

<p>"Say it in bricks," suggested Anthony.</p>

<p>"Quite right, Mr. Cade. Eight bricks from the bottom or the top
on the left-hand side. Try from the bottom first—it’s easier."</p>

<p>He counted up eight bricks.</p>

<p>"Now three to the right of that. One, two, three—Hullo—— Hullo,
what’s this?"</p>

<p>"I shall scream in a minute," said Bundle, "I know I shall. <em>What</em>
is it?"</p>

<p>Superintendent Battle was working at the brick with the point
of his knife. His practised eye had quickly seen that this particular
brick was different from the rest. A minute or two’s work, and
he was able to pull it right out. Behind was a small dark cavity.
Battle thrust in his hand.</p>

<p>Every one waited in breathless expectancy.</p>

<p>Battle drew out his hand again.</p>

<p>He uttered an exclamation of surprise and anger.</p>

<p>The others crowded round and stared uncomprehendingly at the
three articles he held. For a moment it seemed as though their
eyes must have deceived them.</p>

<p>A card of small pearl buttons, a square of coarse knitting and
a piece of paper on which were inscribed a row of capital E’s!</p>

<p>"Well," said Battle. "I’m—I’m danged! What’s the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>"<em>Mon Dieu</em>," muttered the Frenchman. "<em>Ça, c’est un
peu trop fort!</em>"</p>

<p>"But what does it mean?" cried Virginia, bewildered.</p>

<p>"Mean?" said Anthony. "There’s only one thing it can mean. The
late Count Stylptitch must have had a sense of humour! This is
an example of that humour. I may say that I don’t consider it
particularly funny myself."</p>

<p>"Do you mind explaining your meaning a little more clearly, sir?"
said Superintendent Battle.</p>

<p>"Certainly. This was the Count’s little joke. He must have suspected
that his memorandum had been read. When the crooks came to recover
the jewel, they were to find instead this extremely clever conundrum.
It’s the sort of thing you pin on to yourself at Book Teas, when
people have to guess what you are."</p>

<p>"It has a meaning, then?"</p>

<p>"I should say, undoubtedly. If the Count had meant to be merely
offensive, he would have put a placard with ‘Sold’ on it, or a
picture of a donkey or something crude like that."</p>

<p>"A bit of knitting, some capital E’s, and a lot of buttons,"
muttered Battle discontentedly.</p>

<p>"<em>C’est inoui</em>," said Lemoine angrily.</p>

<p>"Cipher No. 2," said Anthony. "I wonder whether Professor Wynward
would be any good at this one?"</p>

<p>"When was this passage last used, milady?" asked the Frenchman
of Bundle.</p>

<p>Bundle reflected.</p>

<p>"I don’t believe anyone’s been into it for over two years. The
Priest’s Hole is the show exhibit for Americans and tourists generally."</p>

<p>"Curious," murmured the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"Why curious?"</p>

<p>Lemoine stooped and picked up a small object from the floor.</p>

<p>"Because of this," he said. "This match has not lain here for
two years—not even for two days."</p>

<p>Battle looked at the match curiously. It was of pink wood, with
a yellow head.</p>

<p>"Any of you ladies or gentlemen drop this, by any chance?" he
asked.</p>

<p>He received a negative all round.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Superintendent Battle, "we’ve seen all there
is to see. We might as well get out of here."</p>

<p>The proposal was assented to by all. The panel had swung to,
but Bundle showed them how it was fastened from the inside. She
unlatched it, swung it noiselessly open, and sprang through the
opening, alighting in the Council Chamber with a resounding thud.</p>

<p>"Damn!" said Lord Caterham, springing up from an arm-chair in
which he appeared to have been taking forty winks.</p>

<p>"Poor old father," said Bundle. "Did I startle you?"</p>

<p>"I can’t think," said Lord Caterham, "why nobody nowadays ever
sits still after a meal. It’s a lost art. God knows Chimneys is
big enough, but even here there doesn’t seem to be a single room
where I can be sure of a little peace. Good Lord, how many of
you are there? Reminds me of the Pantomimes I used to go to as
a boy when hordes of demons used to pop up out of trapdoors."</p>

<p>"Demon No. 7," said Virginia, approaching him, and patting him
on the head. "Don’t be cross. We’re just exploring secret passages,
that’s all."</p>

<p>"There seems to be a positive boom in secret passages to-day,"
grumbled Lord Caterham, not yet completely mollified. "I’ve had
to show that fellow Fish round them all this morning."</p>

<p>"When was that?" asked Battle quickly.</p>

<p>"Just before lunch. It seems he’d heard of the one in here. I
showed him that, and then took him up to the White Gallery, and
we finished up with the Priest’s Hole. But his enthusiasm was
waning by that time. He looked bored to death. But I made him
go through with it." Lord Caterham chuckled at the remembrance.</p>

<p>Anthony put a hand on Lemoine’s arm.</p>

<p>"Come outside," he said softly. "I want to speak to you."</p>

<p>The two men went out together through the window. When they had
gone a sufficient distance from the house, Anthony drew from his
pocket the scrap of paper that Boris had given him that morning.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said. "Did you drop this?"</p>

<p>Lemoine took it and examined it with some interest.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "I have never seen it before. Why?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely sure, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"That’s very odd."</p>

<p>He repeated to Lemoine what Boris had said. The other listened
with close attention.</p>

<p>"No, I did not drop it. You say he found it in that clump of
trees?"</p>

<p>"Well, I assumed so, but he did not actually say so."</p>

<p>"It is just possible that it might have fluttered out of M. Isaacstein’s
suit-case. Question Boris again." He handed the paper back to
Anthony. After a minute or two he said: "What exactly do you know
of this man Boris?"</p>

<p>Anthony shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I understood he was the late Prince Michael’s trusted servant."</p>

<p>"It may be so, but make it your business to find out. Ask some
one who knows, such as the Baron Lolopretjzyl. Perhaps this man
was engaged but a few weeks ago. For myself, I have believed him
honest. But who knows? King Victor is quite capable of making
himself into a trusted servant at a moment’s notice."</p>

<p>"Do you really think——"</p>

<p>Lemoine interrupted him.</p>

<p>"I will be quite frank. With me, King Victor is an obsession.
I see him everywhere. At this moment even I ask myself—this man
who is talking to me, this M. Cade, is he, perhaps, King Victor?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord," said Anthony, "you have got it badly."</p>

<p>"What do I care for the diamond? For the discovery of the murderer
of Prince Michael? I leave those affairs to my colleague of Scotland
Yard whose business it is. Me, I am in England for one purpose,
and one purpose only, to capture King Victor and to capture him
red-handed. Nothing else matters."</p>

<p>"Think you’ll do it?" asked Anthony, lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" said Lemoine, with sudden despondency.</p>

<p>"H’m!" said Anthony.</p>

<p>They had regained the terrace. Superintendent Battle was standing
near the French window in a wooden attitude.</p>

<p>"Look at poor old Battle," said Anthony. "Let’s go and cheer
him up." He paused a minute, and said, "You know, you’re an odd
fish in some ways, M. Lemoine."</p>

<p>"In what ways, M. Cade?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Anthony, "in your place, I should have been inclined
to note down that address that I showed you. It may be of no importance—quite
conceivably. On the other hand, it might be very important indeed."</p>

<p>Lemoine looked at him for a minute or two steadily. Then, with
a slight smile, he drew back the cuff of his left coat sleeve.
Pencilled on the white shirt-cuff beneath were the words "Hurstmere,
Langly Road, Dover."</p>

<p>"I apologize," said Anthony. "And I retire worsted."</p>

<p>He joined Superintendent Battle.</p>

<p>"You look very pensive, Battle," he remarked.</p>

<p>"I’ve got a lot to think about, Mr. Cade."</p>

<p>"Yes, I expect you have."</p>

<p>"Things aren’t dovetailing. They’re not dovetailing at all."</p>

<p>"Very trying," sympathized Anthony. "Never mind, Battle, if the
worst comes to the worst, you can always arrest me. You’ve got
my guilty footprints to fall back upon, remember."</p>

<p>But the superintendent did not smile.</p>

<p>"Got any enemies here that you know of, Mr. Cade?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I’ve an idea that the third footman doesn’t like me," replied
Anthony lightly. "He does his best to forget to hand me the choicest
vegetables. Why?"</p>

<p>"I’ve been getting anonymous letters," said Superintendent Battle.
"Or rather an anonymous letter, I should say."</p>

<p>"About me?"</p>

<p>Without answering Battle took a folded sheet of cheap notepaper
from his pocket, and handed it to Anthony. Scrawled on it in an
illiterate handwriting were the words:</p>

<p>"Look out for Mr. Cade. He isn’t wot he seems."</p>

<p>Anthony handed it back with a light laugh.</p>

<p>"That’s all? Cheer up, Battle. I’m really a King in disguise,
you know."</p>

<p>He went into the house, whistling lightly as he walked along.
But as he entered his bedroom and shut the door behind him, his
face changed. It grew set and stern. He sat down on the edge of
the bed and stared moodily at the floor.</p>

<p>"Things are getting serious," said Anthony to himself. "Something
must be done about it. It’s all damned awkward...."</p>

<p>He sat there for a minute or two, then strolled to the window.
For a moment or two he stood looking out aimlessly, and then his
eyes became suddenly focused on a certain spot, and his face lightened.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said. "The Rose Garden! That’s it! The Rose Garden."</p>

<p>He hurried downstairs again and out into the garden by a side
door. He approached the Rose Garden by a circuitous route. It
had a little gate at either end. He entered by the far one, and
walked up to the sundial which was on a raised hillock in the
exact centre of the garden.</p>

<p>Just as Anthony reached it, he stopped dead and stared at another
occupant of the Rose Garden who seemed equally surprised to see
him.</p>

<p>"I didn’t know that you were interested in roses, Mr. Fish,"
said Anthony gently.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Mr. Fish, "I am considerably interested in roses."</p>

<p>They looked at each other warily, as antagonists seek to measure
their opponents’ strength.</p>

<p>"So am I," said Anthony.</p>

<p>"Is that so?"</p>

<p>"In fact, I dote upon roses," said Anthony airily.</p>

<p>A very slight smile hovered upon Mr. Fish’s lips and at the same
time Anthony also smiled. The tension seemed to relax.</p>

<p>"Look at this beauty now," said Mr. Fish, stooping to point out
a particularly fine bloom. "Madame Abel Chatenay, I pressoom it
to be. Yes, I am right. This white rose, before the war, was known
as Frau Carl Drusky. They have, I believe, renamed it. Over sensitive,
perhaps but truly patriotic. The La France is always popular.
Do you care for red roses at all, Mr. Cade? A bright scarlet rose
now——"</p>

<p>Mr. Fish’s slow, drawling voice was interrupted. Bundle was leaning
out of a first-floor window.</p>

<p>"Care for a spin to town, Mr. Fish? I’m just off."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Lady Eileen, but I am vurry happy here."</p>

<p>"Sure you won’t change your mind, Mr. Cade?"</p>

<p>Anthony laughed and shook his head. Bundle disappeared.</p>

<p>"Sleep is more in my line," said Anthony, with a wide yawn. "A
good after luncheon nap!" He took out a cigarette. "You haven’t
got a match, have you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Fish handed him a match-box. Anthony helped himself, and
handed back the box with a word of thanks.</p>

<p>"Roses," said Anthony, "are all very well. But I don’t feel particularly
horticultural this afternoon."</p>

<p>With a disarming smile, he nodded cheerfully.</p>

<p>A thundering noise sounded from just outside the house.</p>

<p>"Pretty powerful engine she’s got in that car of hers," remarked
Anthony. "There, off she goes."</p>

<p>They had a view of the car speeding down the long drive.</p>

<p>Anthony yawned again, and strolled towards the house.</p>

<p>He passed in through the door. Once inside, he seemed as though
changed to quicksilver. He raced across the hall, out through
one of the windows on the farther side, and across the park. Bundle,
he knew, had to make a big détour by the lodge gates, and through
the village.</p>

<p>He ran desperately. It was a race against time. He reached the
park wall just as he heard the car outside. He swung himself up
and dropped into the road.</p>

<p>"Hi!" cried Anthony.</p>

<p>In her astonishment, Bundle swerved half across the road. She
managed to pull up without accident. Anthony ran after the car,
opened the door, and jumped in beside Bundle.</p>

<p>"I’m coming to London with you," he said. "I meant to all along."</p>

<p>"Extraordinary person," said Bundle. "What’s that you’ve got
in your hand?"</p>

<p>"Only a match," said Anthony.</p>

<p>He regarded it thoughtfully. It was pink, with a yellow head.
He threw away his unlighted cigarette, and put the match carefully
into his pocket.</p>
