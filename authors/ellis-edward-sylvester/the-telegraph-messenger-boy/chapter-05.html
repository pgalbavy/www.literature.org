<p>"Yes, it's the last message he'll ever deliver," repeated the
policeman; "Ben Mayberry has probably been killed!"</p>

<p>These were the terrible words spoken by the man who had rung
my bell in the middle of the night, and startled me almost out
of my senses. I swallowed the lump in my throat, and with a voice
tremulous with emotion, said:</p>

<p>"No, no! it cannot be. Who would kill him?"</p>

<p>"I don't mean he was murdered," the officer hastened to add,
seeing my mistake. "He was on the middle span of the bridge when
it was carried away by the flood, and that's the last of him!"</p>

<p>I drew a great sigh of relief. There was something unspeakably
dreadful in the thought of noble Ben Mayberry being killed by
anyone, and it lifted a vast burden from my shoulders to be told
that no such awful fate had overtaken him.</p>

<p>But instantly came the staggering terror that the boy had gone
down in the wreck and ruin, and at that moment was floating among
the great masses of ice and d√©bris that were sweeping swiftly
down the river toward the sea.</p>

<p>"How was it?" I asked, after the officer had refused my invitation
to enter.</p>

<p>"The river began rising very fast at dark, but the bridge has
stood so many freshets we were hopeful of this. The water was
at the top of the abutments at nine o'clock and was still creeping
up. Jack Sprall, who is off duty to-night, was down by the bridge
watching things. A little after ten o'clock, Ben Mayberry came
along and said he had a message which he had promised to deliver
to a gentleman at the hotel in Moorestown. Jack told him the bridge
was unsafe, but Ben said he knew how to swim, and started across,
whistling and jolly as usual. Jack said at the same time he heard
the sound of wheels, which showed that a wagon or carriage had
driven on from the other side, which never ought to have been
allowed when things were looking so shaky. Ben had just about
time to reach the middle of the bridge when the crash came, and
the big span was wiped out, as though it was a chalk mark on a
blackboard."</p>

<p>"How do you know of a surety that Ben Mayberry did not save himself?"</p>

<p>"He is very active and strong, I know, which made Jack hope he
had pulled through. In spite of the danger of the rest of the
bridge going, Jack crept out over it to the abutment, and shouted
to Ben.</p>

<p>"It seemed that a couple of men had done the same from Moorestown,
and they stood on the other abutment, with the middle of the river
sweeping between and threatening to take away the rest of the
tottering bridge every minute.</p>

<p>"When Jack called, they answered, though it was too dark to see
each other, and they asked Jack whom he was looking for. He told
them that Ben Mayberry had gone on the bridge a few minutes before
from this side, and he was afraid he had been swept away. They
said there could be no doubt of it, as he had not reached the
span on which they were standing. They then asked Jack whether
he had seen anything of a horse and carriage, which drove on the
bridge from the Moorestown side, and which they had come out to
see about. Of course Jack could only make the same answer, and
when they explained, it was learned that the carriage contained
a lady and small child&mdash;so three lives have been lost from people
not doing their duty in keeping folks out of danger."</p>

<p>"Does the mother of Ben know anything about this?" I asked, with
a shudder at the thought of her terrible grief.</p>

<p>"Yes; I went up to her house and told her first, as I thought
it my duty to do."</p>

<p>"Poor woman! she must have been overcome."</p>

<p>"She was at first, and then when she asked me to tell her all
about it, and I had done so, she said very quietly that she didn't
believe her boy was drowned."</p>

<p>"Nor do I believe it!" I exclaimed, with a sudden thrill of hope.
"Ben Mayberry is one of the best swimmers I ever saw; he went
down with the lumber of the central span, and even if he could
not swim, he had a good chance to float himself on some of the
timbers or blocks of ice which are buoyant enough to support a
dozen men."</p>

<p>"All that is very true," replied the policeman, who seemed to
have thought of everything; "and I don't deny that there is just
the barest possibility in the world that you're right. But you
mustn't forget that the roof of the bridge was over him, and has
shut out the chance of his helping himself. Don't you believe
that, if he was alive, he would have answered the calls that Jack
made to him? Jack has a voice like a fog-horn, and Ben would have
heard him if he was able to hear anything."</p>

<p>This view of the case staggered me, and I hardly knew what to
say, except to suggest that possibly Ben had answered the call,
and was unheard in the rushing waters; but the officer shook his
head, and I confess I shared his doubts.</p>

<p>"Just as the splintering timbers went down, Jack did hear the
shout of Ben; he heard, too, the scream of a woman, and that awful
cry which a horse sometimes makes when in the very extremity of
peril, but that was all."</p>

<p>I could not sleep after such horrifying tidings, when the policeman
had gone; I went into the house and donned my overshoes and rubber
coat. Fortunately my family had not been awakened by the ringing
of the bell, and I did not disturb them; but, carefully closing
and locking the door after me, I went out in the storm and darkness,
oppressed by a grief which I had not known for years, for Ben
Mayberry was as dear to me as my own son, and my heart bled for
the stricken mother who, when she most needed a staff to lean
upon during her declining years, found it cruelly snatched from
her.</p>
