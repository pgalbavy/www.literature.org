<p>"I happen to know," said he, "that Betsy Butterfly has a picture of
herself."
</p><p>"Are you sure?" Freddie asked him eagerly.
</p><p>"I ought to be," replied Jimmy Rabbit, "because I painted it myself, the
very next day after I finished a portrait of old Mr. Crow."
</p><p>"It ought to be a good one, if you made it," said Freddie. "But wasn't
it some time ago that you were an artist?"
</p><p>"It was earlier in the summer," Jimmy Rabbit admitted. "Of course,
Betsy Butterfly has changed somewhat since then. But this picture was a
fine likeness of her at the time I painted it.... I suppose," he added,
"I was the first one in the whole valley to perceive that she was going
to be a beauty when she got her full growth."
</p><p>"Do you suppose she'll send me the picture, if I ask her, so I can show
it to Dusty Moth?" Freddie asked.
</p><p>Jimmy Rabbit looked a bit doubtful. He pondered for a few moments. And
then he said:
</p><p>"I'll tell you what I'll do! To-morrow morning I'll see Betsy and I've
no doubt that she'll loan me the picture if I promise to return it to
her."
</p><p>"That'll be great!" cried Freddie. "Meet me near the duck pond as soon
as it's dark to-morrow night; and be sure to bring Betsy's picture with
you!"
</p><p>Then Freddie Firefly hurried off to find Dusty Moth, who happened
likewise to be looking for him, because he had a question to ask.
</p><p>They met shortly. And Dusty Moth immediately cried:
</p><p>"Have you heard from her?"--meaning Betsy Butterfly, of course.
</p><p>"Now, see here!" Freddie Firefly said. "It's plain enough that Betsy
doesn't care to meet you. But I have a plan that ought to suit you well
enough. If you could look at her picture once you'd be satisfied,
wouldn't you?"
</p><p>"I would--" replied Dusty Moth--"if I got my appetite back afterward."
</p><p>"Well, will you promise to stop pestering me about Betsy Butterfly if I
let you see this picture of her?"
</p><p>"Yes! yes!" Dusty promised impatiently. "Where is it? Quick! Let me see
it!"
</p><p>"Oh! You'll have to wait till to-morrow night," Freddie explained.
</p><p>"I shall not be able to eat a single mouthful till then!" Dusty Moth
groaned.
</p><p>"Well--you can suit yourself about that," Freddie told him impatiently.
"And please don't speak to me again to-night! I've been troubled enough
on your account without being bothered by you any more."
</p><p>"One moment!" cried Dusty, as Freddie Firefly started to leave him.
</p><p>"Well--what do you want now?" Freddie growled, flashing his light
impatiently in Dusty Moth's eyes.
</p><p>"Are you sure she will let you take the picture?" Dusty asked him.
</p><p>"Yes! yes! Of course she will! Why shouldn't she, I should like to know?
You certainly do ask the silliest questions!"
</p><p>And yet Freddie Firefly had put the same query himself, to Jimmy Rabbit,
only a short time before. But now he was quite certain that his worries
were almost at an end.
</p><p>"Betsy Butterfly has caused me a powerful lot of trouble!" Freddie
grumbled, as he hurried over the hollow, to join in the dance of the
Firefly family.
