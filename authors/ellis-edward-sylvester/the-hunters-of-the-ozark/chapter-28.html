<p>When the boys had eaten their fill, there was a quantity of meat
left. This was cooked still more over the coals, wrapped about
with the greenest leaves that could be got, and then packed in
the bundle which Terry Clark strapped to his back.</p>

<p>"There's enough of the same," he explained, "to presarve us from
pinin' away with starvation, which reminds me now that I promised
ye that I'd show ye the properest way in which to bring down a
buffalo."</p>

<p>"I'm willing to wait until some other time," said Fred, who feared
there would be dangerous delay; "I am more anxious to get forward
than I am to see you make an exhibition of yourself."</p>

<p>"It will not take me long," replied Terry, who was sure there
could be no miss where the animals were so plentiful, while of
course the delay ought to be slight.</p>

<p>"If thim Winnebagos that we obsarved last night have started
this way, they ain' t any more than fairly goin', which puts thim
at the laast calculation a dozen good miles behind us; they won't
walk any faster than we do, so we'll git to the camp a long ways
ahead of 'em."</p>

<p>"All this sounds reasonable, but you know we have learned that
they are not the only Winnebagos in these parts; but then they
are under the eye of Deerfoot and he would give us warning."</p>

<p>"That sittles it, as I previously remarked some time ago, in
token of which we will shake hands on the same."</p>

<p>The Irish lad had made such an enjoyable meal that he was in
the highest spirits. He extended his hand to his friend and shook
it warmly, as he was inclined to do for slight cause.</p>

<p>"Now stand still, obsarve, admire and remimber."</p>

<p>And with this high flown counsel, Terry with his gun in position
began moving toward an enormous bull. The latter really was not
so close to him as was a cow, but he thought it beneath his dignity
to spend his ammunition on such game as had served for their dinner.</p>

<p>Although Terry Clark's natural love of humor often led him to
assume what he failed to feel, he was hopeful in the present instance
that he would be able to carry out the little scheme in mind.
He knew that the weapon in his hand was a good one, and he was
already so close to the buffalo that he was sure of bringing it
down at the first fire.</p>

<p>While he was willing to admit that Fred's shot could not have
been improved, so far as effectiveness was concerned, yet he was
in earnest in his intention of firing at the head. He knew that
no animal is of any account after its brain has been perforated,
and it seemed to him that it was more appropriate for a true sportsman
to bring down his game by that means instead of firing at its
body.</p>

<p>Terry made a mistake from which his experience on the border
ought to have saved him. Had he driven his bullet into the eye
of the buffalo, he could have slain him, but he was almost certain
to fail by firing simply at the head. It would have been far better
had he followed the example that his companion set.</p>

<p>The bull upon which he had cast his eyes was about twenty yards
from the wood. He did not raise his head until this distance was
diminished by one half. Just then a cow showed some alarm of the
approaching figure and walked hastily away. This caused the bull
to throw up his head and stare at Terry.</p>

<p>"Obsarve!" called the latter to his friend, who began to feel
uneasy over the appearance of things.</p>

<p>A dozen spears of grass seemed to be dripping from the mouth
of the magnificent bull, who glared at the figure of the young
man in the act of leveling his gun as though he had some curiosity
to know what was going on.</p>

<p>Terry aimed at the head, making the part between and above the
eyes his target. This was probably the most invulnerable spot
of the animal.</p>

<p>The bull was still staring at the intruder, when the latter,
aiming at the point named, fired. The bullet struck the bony ridge
at the upper part of the head and glanced off into space, inflicting
no more real injury than a paper wad.</p>

<p>But the impingement of the lead must have given the stupid brute
an idea that harm was meant. His anger was roused, and, dropping
his head with a savage bellow, he charged the young hunter at
full speed.</p>

<p>This was giving the matter an unpleasant turn, but there was
no time to argue, and flinging his gun aside, Terry gave the finest
exhibition of running he had ever shown. No one could have realized
better than did he that the bull "meant business" and it would
never do to allow himself to be caught.</p>

<p>Fred Linden himself was so startled by the sudden onslaught of
the animal that he was flurried and fired without taking proper
aim. He struck him, but he was unable to check his charge: indeed
he rather added to his fury. Stepping back, so as to shield himself
as much as he could behind the nearest tree, he began reloading
his weapon with the utmost haste.</p>

<p>Meantime Terry, by desperate running, reached the tree at which
he aimed a few steps in advance of his formidable foe. He had
no time to climb the trunk, but believing the lowermost limb was
within reach, he made a leap, seized it with both hands and swung
himself out of reach, just as the bull thundered beneath like
a runaway engine.</p>

<p>Finding he had missed his victim, the savage beast snorted with
rage, wheeled about, came back a few paces and was passing beneath
the limb again, when a singular accident gave an astonishing turn
to the whole business.</p>

<p>The limb which afforded Terry Clark his temporary safety was
unable to bear his weight, and, while he was struggling to raise
himself to the upper side and it was bending low with him, it
broke like a pipe stem close to the body of the tree.</p>

<p>This took place so suddenly that the youth had not the slightest
warning. Indeed it would not have availed him had he known what
was coming, for the time was too brief in which to help himself.</p>

<p>Down he came with the limb grasped in both hands and fell squarely
on the back of the buffalo bull. Fortunately the bewildered animal
had just shifted his position, so that the lad fell with his face
turned toward the head instead of in "reverse order."</p>

<p>Even in that exciting moment Terry saw the grotesqueness of the
situation. His legs were stretched apart so as to span the animal
just back of his enormous neck. Letting go of the branch that
had played him the trick, he grasped the bushy mane with both
hands and yelled in a voice that might have been heard a mile
away:</p>

<p>"<em>All aboard! off wid ye!</em>"</p>

<p>So far as a bull is capable of feeling emotion, that particular
specimen must have been in a peculiar frame of mind. He glared
about him, here and there, turned part way round, as if the whole
thing was more than he could understand, and then as his bulging
eyes caught sight of the remarkable load on his back and he felt
the weight of the burden, he was seized with a panic.</p>

<p>He emitted a single whiffing snort, and flinging his tail high
in air, made for the other side of the prairie as if Death himself
was racing at his heels. His actions were of that pronounced character
that his fright communicated itself to the rest of the herd. There
was a general uplifting of heads, and then, as the bulls and cows
saw their most eminent leader tearing across the prairie with
a live boy astride of his back, the sight was too much for them.
A wholesale series of snorts and bellows followed, tails were
flirted aloft, and away the whole herd went, fairly making the
ground tremble beneath their tread.</p>

<p>By the time the alarmed Fred Linden had his rifle reloaded there
was not a buffalo within a hundred yards of him. The one that
bore his friend on his back was making as good time as the fleetest
and was well toward the head of the drove. The panic began like
an eddy of the sea; there was a surging of the animals toward
the other side of the prairie and away they went, as I have said,
with their tails and heels in the air, as if they meant to keep
up their headlong flight for twenty miles, as is sometimes the
case, when an immense drove become stampeded on the great plains
of the west.</p>

<p>Whatever feelings of amusement might have been first aroused
by the figure that Terry cut on the back of the terrified bull
were lost in the dreadful fear of Fred that it would prove a fatal
ride for his friend.</p>

<p>He could see him plainly for a fourth of a mile, but by that
time the trampling hoofs raised a dust in the dry grass which
partly obscured the herd and made it impossible to distinguish
the figure of the lad clinging to the mane of his novel charger.</p>

<p>"He will fall off," was the exclamation of Fred, "and will be
trampled to death by the others."</p>

<p>He recalled that the bull must have been wounded by his own shot,
but that knowledge gave him concern instead of relief; for if
the bull should give out, he would be trampled by those who were
thundering so close at his heels.</p>

<p>The buffaloes did not preserve the open order which marked them
when they were grazing, but crowded together, so that their backs
looked like brown dusty waves, rising and falling rapidly from
the motions of their bodies.</p>

<p>Fred quickly recovered from his astonishment. He had reloaded
his gun, but when ready to fire, was afraid to do so. Too many
other buffaloes interposed between him and the bull, and had he
discharged his weapon, he would have been as likely to hit Terry
as to wound the brute that was carrying him away with such speed.</p>

<p>Running to where the rifle of the boy lay, Fred picked it up,
hastily reloaded it, and started after the herd. He broke into
a loping trot such as an Indian shows when hurriedly following
a trail. He kept his eyes on the fast receding animals, his interest
being now centered on the moment when they should reach the wood
on the other side of the prairie.</p>

<p>"It will be the death of him if they dash among the trees," he
thought; "for he will be struck by some limb and have his brains
dashed out."</p>

<p>But such a catastrophe did not take place. The fleeing animals
must have known that their headlong speed could not be kept up
among the trees and undergrowth; so, when those at the head of
the drove were close to the edge of the wood they swerved to the
left, and the others followed with the same furious swiftness
with which they had sped across the open.</p>

<p>Fred Linden at this time was not a third of the way across the
prairie, and he stopped and viewed the sight. He could distinguish
the animals much better than when they were tearing straight away
from him. They ran, so to speak, from under the cloud of dust
that had obscured his vision, which, sweeping backward, left all
in plain view.</p>

<p>What he saw, too, showed that the buffaloes possessed varying
rates of speed. A dozen were well to the front, still crowding
close together, while the rest, also in close order, were strung
along at different distances. Still, they were so far from Fred
that his view was any thing but satisfactory. Shading his eyes
with his hand, he peered through the autumn air in the search
for his friend.</p>

<p>"There he is!" he exclaimed, but the words were hardly out of
his mouth when he saw he was mistaken. The distance was too great
for him to see clearly.</p>

<p>"How long will this keep up?" was the question which he would
have been glad to answer, for it included the fate of Terence
Clark. If his steed should grow weary and fall behind the others,
possibly he would give his rider a chance to leap to the ground
and make off; but the likelihood of that taking place was so remote
that Fred could feel no hope.</p>
