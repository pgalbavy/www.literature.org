<p>It was not the thin, meek-looking woman who uttered these words
of welcome. The tones were so thunderous that both the lads were
startled, and they did not see the speaker, until they stepped
across the threshold. He was an old man, one who must have been
near eighty, who was sitting near the front window, smoking a
corncob pipe. His face was weazened and wrinkled, his white hair
thin and his shoulders stooping, but his little eyes twinkled
kindly and he wore no glasses. He was in his shirt sleeves and
his waistcoat hung loosely and unbuttoned down the front. His
clean, coarse white shirt showed no necktie, but there was a pleasing
neatness about his trousers and thick shoes.</p>

<p>Alvin and Chester removed their caps and saluted the couple.
The woman had not spoken and for a long time kept silent.</p>

<p>"Take a cheer! take a cheer!" added the old man, holding his
pipe in one hand while he waved the other toward seats; "take
a couple if you like."</p>

<p>The wonder about the old fellow was his voice. Never had the
callers heard so deep and resounding a bass. It was literally
like thunder. Each asked himself what it was a half century before.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking his hospitality. Probably in his loneliness
he welcomed any callers, no matter who they might be. He smiled
upon the youths, who noticed that there was not a tooth visible.</p>

<p>"Bless my heart! It does my old eyes good to look upon two such
handsome chaps as you! Your faces be clean, your eyes bright,
you wear purty good clothes and I don't b'lieve you use terbacker."</p>

<p>"No," said Alvin; "we haven't begun yet."</p>

<p>"My! my! you don't know what you've missed, but there's time
'nough; wait till you're as old as me afore you start. How old
do you think I am?"</p>

<p>The pleased lads scanned the wrinkled countenance as if trying
to make up their minds. It was Chester who answered for both:</p>

<p>"You must be past sixty-five&mdash;pretty close to seventy."</p>

<p>The remark was diplomatic, for both knew he was a good deal older.
The man threw back his head and shook with mirth.</p>

<p>"Do you hear that, Peggy? They think I'm purty close to seventy!
That's the best joke I've heerd since I was a boy. He! he! Why,
young man," he added, abruptly checking his laughter, "I'll be
eighty-three come next Christmas. I was a Christmas gift to my
father and mother."</p>

<p>"You don't mean it!" replied Alvin, with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>The wife paused in crossing the floor and laughed, but without
the least sound.</p>

<p>"I don't mean it, eh? Ask Peggy."</p>

<p>The youths looked inquiringly and she nodded several times in
confirmation, but remained mute.</p>

<p>"We can't doubt <em>her</em>," said Chester. "You are surely
a wonder, Mr.&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Folks don't call me mister; I'm Uncle Ben &mdash;Ben Trotwood.
Who might you be?"</p>

<p>There was no need of evasion, and Alvin briefly told all the
important facts. Having given their names, he related how their
motor boat had been stolen while they were taking lunch that day
in the woods near the blockhouse. It was not worth while to mention
Mike Murphy.</p>

<p>"Consarn such scamps!" exclaimed Uncle Ben. "They oughter be
made to smart. But when Peggy opened the door I think you said
something 'bout devouring food."</p>

<p>"We are hungry."</p>

<p>"Wal," said the old man, rising briskly from his chair in answer
to a nod from his wife, "supper's ready and we'll all set by.
If you want to please us you won't leave a crumb on the table."</p>

<p>"Then we'll be sure to please you."</p>

<p>It was a most enjoyable meal of which our young friends partook,
after Uncle Ben had said grace as was his invariable custom. The
food was plain but excellently cooked and there was an abundance.
The host was as spry as a man of half his years, and presided,
his wife pouring out tea which never tasted better to Alvin and
Chester. Each of the lads, when no one was watching him, slipped
a dollar bill under his plate, where it was not likely to be seen
until after they had gone.</p>

<p>The kindliness of the old man as well as that of the mute wife
made the guests feel at home. Toward the close of the meal Chester
said:</p>

<p>"Uncle Ben, you've got the most wonderful voice I ever heard."</p>

<p>Plainly the old man was pleased.</p>

<p>"It ain't a sarcumstance to what it was when I was younger. They
asked me to sing bass in the church at Trevett, but I nearly busted
proceedings. The folks said that when I let out my voice, they
couldn't hear anybody else in the choir."</p>

<p>"It is easy to believe that."</p>

<p>"Then," added Uncle Ben whimsically, "they made me pay for several
panes of glass that they insisted my voice had broke. I stood
that, till one Sunday, a boy begun yelling that he was afeard
of that big black bear in the gallery and he like to have went
into fits ontil I put on the brakes. Then I quit, plumb disgusted."</p>

<p>"Don't you find it rather lonely here?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes when the children wait too long to visit us."</p>

<p>"How many children have you?"</p>

<p>"Seven boys and six girls. We lost three afore they growed up."</p>

<p>"You are rich indeed," said Chester admiringly.</p>

<p>And then the wife spoke for the first time:</p>

<p>"We ought to be thankful and <em>we are</em>!"</p>

<p>It came out that all the sons and daughters were well married
and lived within a radius of little more than fifty miles. Each
family had often urged the old couple to make their home with
it, but they preferred to live by themselves. There was no danger
of their suffering for anything that affection could provide.</p>

<p>Alvin and Chester would have been glad to stay over night, as
they were urged to do, but they decided to push on and learn what
they could with the least possible delay. While daylight would
have been more favorable, in many respects, for their task, they
feared that the thieves would make off with the <em>Deerfoot</em>
before daylight. The intrusion of the man in gray added a zest
to the search that had something to do with their haste.</p>

<p>Since Uncle Ben rarely went beyond sight of his humble home,
he could tell them nothing of the launch. He admitted that most
of the time when he sat by the front window smoking, he dozed
or was fully asleep. He had seen no one pass the house during
the afternoon except the boy, Henry Perkins. The man in gray might
have gone by, but Uncle Ben knew nothing of it.</p>

<p>Promising to call if they ever came into the neighborhood again,
the youths bade the old couple good night. They hurried, for the
wife had begun clearing away the things from the table, and was
sure to discover the tip that each had left. They chuckled because
they got clear of the home without such mishap.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that night had descended some time before,
and the clouded sky veiled the moon. The path of which Uncle Ben
told them was well defined, but in the dense gloom it was hard
to keep it. Alvin, taking the lead, spread out his arms and swept
them in front of his face to prevent collisions with projecting
limbs. Once or twice he strayed to one side, but with the help
of Chester regained the trail and they pushed on in good spirits,
glad that they had not far to go. The temperature was so mild
that they felt no discomfort from the lack of extra clothing.</p>

<p>As they drew near the inlet their caution increased. Alvin in
front stepped as softly as an Indian scout entering the camp of
an enemy. Chester was equally careful and for some time neither
spoke. With the deep gloom inclosing them on every hand, they
were mutually invisible.</p>

<p>Suddenly Chester bumped lightly into his companion.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>"I'm out of the path again."</p>

<p>"I don't see that that makes any difference; we must be close
to the bay. Push on!"</p>

<p>They felt their way in silence for a few minutes and then stopped
once more. Not the slightest sound was given out by the water
that was somewhere near them. Alvin hesitated, as he was afraid
of a mis-step.</p>

<p>At this juncture, when the two stood motionless and uncertain,
nature, singularly enough, came to their relief. The laboring
moon for a few seconds shone partly through the heavy clouds that
were drifting before its face, and the dim illumination revealed
that two paces farther would have taken them into the inlet. Scarcely
was this discovery made when blank night again shut them in.</p>

<p>"Well, here we are," said Alvin; "and what comes next?"</p>

<p>After all that had been said and done, it dawned upon both at
this moment that their whole venture was foolish to the last degree.
Suppose they located the <em>Deerfoot</em>, they would be powerless
to do anything more. Two unarmed youths could not retake it from
the thieves, and they might grope around the place for the whole
night without learning the truth. If they had been able to reach
the spot before night, or, failing in that, had waited till the
morrow, their eyes would have quickly told them all they wished
to know.</p>

<p>Standing side by side nonplussed for the moment, Alvin sniffed
several times.</p>

<p>"Do you notice it?" he asked in a guarded undertone.</p>

<p>"Notice what?"</p>

<p>"I smell a cigar; somebody is near us."</p>

<p>Chester tested his smelling apparatus and replied:</p>

<p>"You are right; the odor is in the air."</p>

<p>"It reminds me of the kind the governor smokes; and is therefore
a mighty good one."</p>

<p>"It is the man in gray; he smoked nearly all the time on the
boat."</p>
