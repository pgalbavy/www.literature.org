<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Gumbril had spent the afternoon at Bloxam Gardens. His chin was
still sore from the spirit gum with which he had attached to it
the symbol of the Complete Man; he was feeling also a little fatigued.
Rosie had been delighted to see him; St. Jerome had gone on solemnly
communicating all the time.</p>

<p>His father had gone out to dine, and Gumbril had eaten his rump
steak and drunk his bottle of stout alone. He was sitting now
in front of the open French windows which led from his father’s
workroom on to the balcony, with a block on his knee and a fountain-pen
in his hand, composing advertisements for the Patent Small-Clothes.
Outside, in the plane trees of the square, the birds had gone
through their nightly performance. But Gumbril had paid no attention
to them. He sat there, smoking, sometimes writing a word or two—sunk
in the quagmire of his own drowsy and comfortable body. The flawless
weather of the day had darkened into a blue May evening. It was
agreeable merely to be alive.</p>

<p>He sketched out two or three advertisements in the grand idealistic
transatlantic style. He imagined one in particular with a picture
of Nelson at the head of the page and ‘England expects ...’ printed
large beneath it. "England ... Duty ... these are solemn words."
That was how it would begin. "These are solemn words, and we use
them solemnly as men who realize what Duty is, and who do all
that in them lies to perform it as Englishmen should. The Manufacturer’s
is a sacred trust. The guide and ruler of the modern world, he
has, like the Monarch of other days, responsibilities towards
his people; he has a Duty to fulfil. He rules, but he must also
serve. We realize our responsibilities, we take them seriously.
Gumbril’s Patent Small-Clothes have been brought into the world
that they may serve. Our Duty towards you is a Duty of Service.
Our proud boast is that we perform it. But besides his Duty towards
Others, every man has a duty towards Himself. What is that Duty?
It is to keep himself in the highest possible state of physical
and spiritual fitness. Gumbril’s Patent Small-Clothes protect
the lumbar ganglia...." After that it would be plain medical and
mystical sailing.</p>

<p>As soon as he got to the ganglia, Gumbril stopped writing. He
put down the block, sheathed his pen, and abandoned himself to
the pleasures of pure idleness. He sat, he smoked his cigar. In
the basement, two floors down, the cook and the house-parlourmaid
were reading—one the <em>Daily Mirror</em>, the other the <em>Daily
Sketch</em>. For them, Her Majesty the Queen spoke kindly words
to crippled female orphans; the jockeys tumbled at the jumps;
Cupid was busy in Society, and the murderers who had disembowelled
their mistresses were at large. Above him was the city of models,
was a bedroom, a servant’s bedroom, an attic of tanks and ancient
dirt, the roof and, after that, two or three hundred light-years
away, a star of the fourth magnitude. On the other side of the
party-wall on his right, a teeming family of Jews led their dark,
compact, Jewish lives with a prodigious intensity. At this moment
they were all passionately quarrelling. Beyond the wall on the
left lived the young journalist and his wife. To-night it was
he who had cooked the supper. The young wife lay on the sofa,
feeling horribly sick; she was going to have a baby, there could
be no doubt about it now. They had meant not to have one; it was
horrible. And, outside, the birds were sleeping in the trees,
the invading children from the slum tumbled and squealed. Ships
meanwhile were walloping across the Atlantic freighted with more
cigars. Rosie at this moment was probably mending Shearwater’s
socks. Gumbril sat and smoked, and the universe arranged itself
in a pattern about him, like iron filings round a magnet.</p>

<p>The door opened, and the house-parlourmaid intruded Shearwater
upon his lazy felicity, abruptly, in her unceremonious old way,
and hurried back to the <em>Daily Sketch</em>.</p>

<p>"Shearwater! This is very agreeable," said Gumbril. "Come and
sit down." He pointed to a chair.</p>

<p>Clumsily, filling the space that two ordinary men would occupy,
Shearwater came zigzagging and lurching across the room, bumped
against the work-table and the sofa as he passed, and finally
sat down in the indicated chair.</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to Gumbril that this was Rosie’s husband:
he had not thought of that before. Could it be in the marital
capacity that he presented himself so unexpectedly now? After
this afternoon.... He had come home; Rosie had confessed all....
Ah! but then she didn’t know who he was. He smiled to himself
at the thought. What a joke! Perhaps Shearwater had come to complain
to him of the unknown Complete Man—to him! It was delightful.
Anon—the author of all those ballads in the <em>Oxford Book of
English Verse</em>: the famous Italian painter—Ignoto. Gumbril
was quite disappointed when his visitor began to talk of other
themes than Rosie. Sunk in the quagmire of his own comfortable
guts, he felt good-humouredly obscene. The dramatic scabrousness
of the situation would have charmed him in his present mood. Good
old Shearwater—but what an ox of a man! If he, Gumbril, took the
trouble to marry a wife, he would at least take some interest
in her.</p>

<p>Shearwater had begun to talk in general terms about life. What
could he be getting at, Gumbril wondered? What particulars were
ambushed behind these generalizations? There were silences. Shearwater
looked, he thought, very gloomy. Under his thick moustache the
small, pouting, babyish mouth did not smile. The candid eyes had
a puzzled, tired expression in them.</p>

<p>"People are queer," he said after one of his silences. "Very
queer. One has no idea how queer they are."</p>

<p>Gumbril laughed. "But I have a very clear idea of their queerness,"
he said. "Every one’s queer, and the ordinary, respectable, bourgeois
people are the queerest of the lot. How do they manage to live
like that? It’s astonishing. When I think of all my aunts and
uncles...." He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it’s because I’m rather incurious," said Shearwater.
"One ought to be curious, I think. I’ve come to feel lately that
I’ve not been curious enough about people." The particulars began
to peep, alive and individual, out of the vagueness, like rabbits;
Gumbril saw them in his fancy, at the fringe of a wood.</p>

<p>"Quite," he said encouragingly. "Quite."</p>

<p>"I think too much of my work," Shearwater went on, frowning.
"Too much physiology. There’s also psychology. People’s minds
as well as their bodies.... One shouldn’t be limited. Not too
much, at any rate. People’s minds...." He was silent for a moment.
"I can imagine," he went on at last, as in the tone of one who
puts a very hypothetical case, "I can imagine one’s getting so
much absorbed in somebody else’s psychology that one could really
think of nothing else." The rabbits seemed ready to come out into
the open.</p>

<p>"That’s a process," said Gumbril, with middle-aged jocularity,
speaking out of his private warm morass, "that’s commonly called
falling in love."</p>

<p>There was another silence. Shearwater broke it to begin talking
about Mrs. Viveash. He had lunched with her three or four days
running. He wanted Gumbril to tell him what she was really like.
"She seems to me a very extraordinary woman," he said.</p>

<p>"Like everybody else," said Gumbril irritatingly. It amused him
to see the rabbits scampering about at last.</p>

<p>"I’ve never known a woman like that before."</p>

<p>Gumbril laughed. "You’d say that of any woman you happened to
be interested in," he said. "You’ve never known any women at all."
He knew much more about Rosie, already, than Shearwater did, or
probably ever would.</p>

<p>Shearwater meditated. He thought of Mrs. Viveash, her cool, pale,
critical eyes; her laughter, faint and mocking; her words that
pierced into the mind, goading it into thinking unprecedented
thoughts.</p>

<p>"She interests me," he repeated. "I want you to tell me what
she’s really like." He emphasized the word really, as though there
must, in the nature of things, be a vast difference between the
apparent and the real Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>Most lovers, Gumbril reflected, picture to themselves, in their
mistresses, a secret reality, beyond and different from what they
see every day. They are in love with somebody else—their own invention.
And sometimes there is a secret reality; and sometimes reality
and appearance are the same. The discovery, in either case, is
likely to cause a shock. "I don’t know," he said. "How should
I know? You must find out for yourself."</p>

<p>"But you knew her, you know her well," said Shearwater, almost
with anxiety in his voice.</p>

<p>"Not so well as all that."</p>

<p>Shearwater sighed profoundly, like a whale in the night. He felt
restless, incapable of concentrating. His mind was full of a horrible
confusion. A violent eruptive bubbling up from below had shaken
its calm clarity to pieces. All this absurd business of passion—he
had always thought it nonsense, unnecessary. With a little strength
of will one could shut it out. Women—only for half an hour out
of the twenty-four. But she had laughed, and his quiet, his security
had vanished. "I can imagine," he had said to her yesterday, "I
can imagine myself giving up everything, work and all, to go running
round after you." "And do you suppose I should enjoy that?" Mrs.
Viveash had asked. "It would be ridiculous," he said, "it would
be almost shameful." And she had thanked him for the compliment.
"And at the same time," he went on, "I feel that it might be worth
it. It might be the only thing." His mind was confused, full of
new thoughts. "It’s difficult," he said after a pause, "arranging
things. Very difficult. I thought I had arranged them so well...."</p>

<p>"I never arrange anything," said Gumbril, very much the practical
philosopher. "I take things as they come." And as he spoke the
words, suddenly he became rather disgusted with himself. He shook
himself; he climbed up out of his own morass. "It would be better,
perhaps, if I arranged things more," he added.</p>

<p>"Render therefore unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar’s," said
Shearwater, as though to himself; "and to God, and to sex, and
to work.... There must be a working arrangement." He sighed again.
"Everything in proportion. In proportion," he repeated, as though
the word were magical and had power. "In proportion."</p>

<p>"Who’s talking about proportion?" They turned round. In the doorway
Gumbril Senior was standing, smoothing his ruffled hair and tugging
at his beard. His eyes twinkled cheerfully behind his spectacles.
"Poaching on my architectural ground?" he said.</p>

<p>"This is Shearwater," Gumbril Junior put in, and explained who
he was.</p>

<p>The old gentleman sat down. "Proportion," he said—"I was just
thinking about it, now, as I was walking back. You can’t help
thinking about it in these London streets, where it doesn’t exist.
You can’t help pining for it. There are some streets ... oh, my
God!" And Gumbril Senior threw up his hands in horror. "It’s like
listening to a symphony of cats to walk along them. Senseless
discords and a horrible disorder all the way. And the one street
that was really like a symphony by Mozart—how busily and gleefully
they’re pulling it down now! Another year and there’ll be nothing
left of Regent Street. There’ll only be a jumble of huge, hideous
buildings at three-quarters of a million apiece. A concert of
Brobdingnagian cats. Order has been turned into a disgusting chaos.
We need no barbarians from outside; they’re on the premises, all
the time."</p>

<p>The old man paused and pulled his beard meditatively. Gumbril
Junior sat in silence, smoking; and in silence Shearwater revolved
within the walls of his great round head his agonizing thoughts
of Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"It has always struck me as very curious," Gumbril Senior went
on, "that people are so little affected by the vile and discordant
architecture around them. Suppose, now, that all these brass bands
of unemployed ex-soldiers that blow so mournfully at all the street
corners were suddenly to play nothing but a series of senseless
and devilish discords—why, the first policeman would move them
on, and the second would put them under arrest, and the passers-by
would try to lynch them on their way to the police station. There
would be a real spontaneous outcry of indignation. But when at
these same street corners the contractors run up enormous palaces
of steel and stone that are every bit as stupid and ignoble and
inharmonious as ten brass bandsmen each playing a different tune
in a different key, there is no outcry. The police don’t arrest
the architect; the passing pedestrians don’t throw stones at the
workmen. They don’t notice that anything’s wrong. It’s odd," said
Gumbril Senior. "It’s very odd."</p>

<p>"Very odd," Gumbril Junior echoed.</p>

<p>"The fact is, I suppose," Gumbril Senior went on, smiling with
a certain air of personal triumph, "the fact is that architecture
is a more difficult and intellectual art than music. Music—that’s
just a faculty you’re born with, as you might be born with a snub
nose. But the sense of plastic beauty—though that’s, of course,
also an inborn faculty—is something that has to be developed and
intellectually ripened. It’s an affair of the mind; experience
and thought have to draw it out. There are infant prodigies in
music; but there are no infant prodigies in architecture." Gumbril
Senior chuckled with a real satisfaction. "A man can be an excellent
musician and a perfect imbecile. But a good architect must also
be a man of sense, a man who knows how to think and to profit
by experience. Now, as almost none of the people who pass along
the streets in London, or any other city of the world, do know
how to think or to profit by experience, it follows that they
cannot appreciate architecture. The innate faculty is strong enough
in them to make them dislike discord in music; but they haven’t
the wits to develop that other innate faculty—the sense of plastic
beauty—which would enable them to see and disapprove of the same
barbarism in architecture. Come with me," Gumbril Senior added,
getting up from his chair, "and I’ll show you something that will
illustrate what I’ve been saying. Something you’ll enjoy, too.
Nobody’s seen it yet," he said mysteriously as he led the way
upstairs. "It’s only just finished—after months and years. It’ll
cause a stir when they see it—when I let them see it, if ever
I do, that is. The dirty devils!" Gumbril Senior added good-humouredly.</p>

<p>On the landing of the next floor he paused, felt in his pocket,
took out a key and unlocked the door of what should have been
the second best bedroom. Gumbril Junior wondered, without very
much curiosity, what the new toy would turn out to be. Shearwater
wondered only how he could possess Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"Come on," called Gumbril Senior from inside the room. He turned
on the light. They entered.</p>

<p>It was a big room; but almost the whole of the floor was covered
by an enormous model, twenty feet long by ten or twelve wide,
of a complete city traversed from end to end by a winding river
and dominated at its central point by a great dome. Gumbril Junior
looked at it with surprise and pleasure. Even Shearwater was roused
from his bitter ruminations of desire to look at the charming
city spread out at his feet.</p>

<p>"It’s exquisite," said Gumbril Junior. "What is it? The capital
of Utopia, or what?"</p>

<p>Delighted, Gumbril Senior laughed. "Don’t you see something rather
familiar in the dome?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I had thought ..." Gumbril Junior hesitated, afraid that
he might be going to say something stupid. He bent down to look
more closely at the dome. "I had thought it looked rather like
St. Paul’s—and now I see that it is St. Paul’s."</p>

<p>"Quite right," said his father. "And this is London."</p>

<p>"I wish it were," Gumbril Junior laughed.</p>

<p>"It’s London as it might have been if they’d allowed Wren to
carry out his plans of rebuilding after the Great Fire."</p>

<p>"And why didn’t they allow him to?" Shearwater asked.</p>

<p>"Chiefly," said Gumbril Senior, "because, as I’ve said before,
they didn’t know how to think or profit by experience. Wren offered
them open spaces and broad streets; he offered them sunlight and
air and cleanliness; he offered them beauty, order and grandeur.
He offered to build for the imagination and the ambitious spirit
of man, so that even the most bestial, vaguely and remotely, as
they walked those streets, might feel that they were of the same
race—or very nearly—as Michelangelo; that they too might feel
themselves, in spirit at least, magnificent, strong and free.
He offered them all these things; he drew a plan for them, walking
in peril among the still smouldering ruins. But they preferred
to re-erect the old intricate squalor; they preferred the mediæval
darkness and crookedness and beastly irregular quaintness; they
preferred holes and crannies and winding tunnels; they preferred
foul smells, sunless, stagnant air, phthisis and rickets; they
preferred ugliness and pettiness and dirt; they preferred the
wretched human scale, the scale of the sickly body, not of the
mind. Miserable fools! But I suppose," the old man continued,
shaking his head, "we can’t blame them." His hair had blown loose
from its insecure anchorage; with a gesture of resignation he
brushed it back into place. "We can’t blame them. We should have
done the same in the circumstances—undoubtedly. People offer us
reason and beauty; but we will have none of them, because they
don’t happen to square with the notions that were grafted into
our souls in youth, that have grown there and become a part of
us. <em>Experientia docet</em>—nothing falser, so far as most
of us are concerned, was ever said. You, no doubt, my dear Theodore,
have often in the past made a fool of yourself with women...."</p>

<p>Gumbril Junior made an embarrassed gesture that half denied,
half admitted the soft impeachment. Shearwater turned away, painfully
reminded of what, for a moment, he had half forgotten. Gumbril
Senior swept on.</p>

<p>"Will that prevent you from making as great a fool of yourself
again to-morrow? It will not. It will most assuredly not." Gumbril
Senior shook his head. "The inconveniences and horrors of the
pox are perfectly well known to every one; but still the disease
flourishes and spreads. Several million people were killed in
a recent war and half the world ruined; but we all busily go on
in courses that make another event of the same sort inevitable.
<em>Experientia docet? Experientia</em> doesn’t. And that is why
we must not be too hard on these honest citizens of London who,
fully appreciating the inconveniences of darkness, disorder and
dirt, manfully resisted any attempt to alter conditions which
they had been taught from childhood onwards to consider as necessary,
right and belonging inevitably to the order of things. We must
not be too hard. We are doing something even worse ourselves.
Knowing by a century of experience how beautiful, how graceful,
how soothing to the mind is an ordered piece of town-planning,
we pull down almost the only specimen of it we possess and put
up in its place a chaos of Portland stone that is an offence against
civilization. But let us forget about these old citizens and the
labyrinth of ugliness and inconvenience which we have inherited
from them, and which is called London. Let us forget the contemporaries
who are making it still worse than it was. Come for a walk with
me through this ideal city. Look."</p>

<p>And Gumbril Senior began expounding it to them.</p>

<p>In the middle, there, of that great elliptical Piazza at the
eastern end of the new City, stands, four-square, the Royal Exchange.
Pierced only with small dark windows, and built of rough ashlars
of the silvery Portland stone, the ground floor serves as a massy
foundation for the huge pilasters that slide up, between base
and capital, past three tiers of pedimented windows. Upon them
rest the cornice, the attic and the balustrade, and on every pier
of the balustrade a statue holds up its symbol against the sky.
Four great portals, rich with allegory, admit to the courtyard
with its double tier of coupled columns, its cloister and its
gallery. The statue of Charles the Martyr rides triumphantly in
the midst, and within the windows one guesses the great rooms,
rich with heavy garlands of plaster, panelled with carved wood.</p>

<p>Ten streets give on to the Piazza, and at either end of its ellipse
the water of sumptuous fountains ceaselessly blows aloft and falls.
Commerce, in that to the north of the Exchange, holds up her cornucopia,
and from the midst of its grapes and apples the master jet leaps
up; from the teats of all the ten Useful Arts, grouped with their
symbols about the central figure, there spouts a score of fine
subsidiary streams. The dolphins, the sea-horses and the Tritons
sport in the basin below. To the south, the ten principal cities
of the Kingdom stand in a family round the Mother London, who
pours from her urn an inexhaustible Thames.</p>

<p>Ranged round the Piazza are the Goldsmiths’ Hall, the Office
of Excise, the Mint, the Post Office. Their flanks are curved
to the curve of the ellipse. Between pilasters, their windows
look out on to the Exchange, and the sister statues on the balustrades
beckon to one another across the intervening space.</p>

<p>Two master roads of ninety feet from wall to wall run westwards
from the Exchange. New Gate ends the more northern vista with
an Arch of Triumph, whose three openings are deep, shadowy and
solemn as the entries of caverns. The Guildhall and the halls
of the twelve City Companies in their livery of rose-red brick,
with their lacings of white stone at the coigns and round the
windows, lend to the street an air of domestic and comfortable
splendour. And every two or three hundred paces the line of the
houses is broken, and in the indentation of a square recess there
rises, conspicuous and insular, the fantastic tower of a parish
church. Spire out of dome; octagon on octagon diminishing upwards;
cylinder on cylinder; round lanterns, lanterns of many sides;
towers with airy pinnacles; clusters of pillars linked by incurving
cornices, and above them, four more clusters and above once more;
square towers pierced with pointed windows; spires uplifted on
flying buttresses; spires bulbous at the base—the multitude of
them beckons, familiar and friendly, on the sky. From the other
shore, or sliding along the quiet river, you see them all, you
tell over their names; and the great dome swells up in the midst
overtopping them all.</p>

<p>The dome of St. Paul’s.</p>

<p>The other master street that goes westward from the Piazza of
the Exchange slants down towards it. The houses are of brick,
plain-faced and square, arcaded at the base, so that the shops
stand back from the street and the pedestrian walks dry-shod under
the harmonious succession of the vaultings. And there at the end
of the street, at the base of a triangular space formed by the
coming together of this with another master street that runs eastwards
to Tower Hill, there stands the Cathedral. To the north of it
is the Deanery and under the arcades are the booksellers’ shops.</p>

<p>From St. Paul’s the main road slopes down under the swaggering
Italianate arches of Ludgate, past the wide lime-planted boulevards
that run north and south within and without the city wall, to
the edge of the Fleet Ditch—widened now into a noble canal, on
whose paved banks the barges unload their freights of country
stuff—leaps it on a single flying arch to climb again to a round
circus, a little to the east of Temple Bar, from which, in a pair
of diagonally superimposed crosses, eight roads radiate: three
northwards towards Holborn, three from the opposite arc towards
the river, one eastward to the City, and one past Lincoln’s Inn
Fields to the west. The piazza is all of brick and the houses
that compose it are continuous above the ground-floor level; for
the roads lead out under archways. To one who stands in the centre
at the foot of the obelisk that commemorates the victory over
the Dutch, it seems a smooth well of brickwork pierced by eight
arched conduits at the base and diversified above by the three
tiers of plain, unornamented windows.</p>

<p>Who shall describe all the fountains in the open places, all
the statues and monuments? In the circus north of London Bridge,
where the four roads come together, stands a pyramid of nymphs
and Tritons—river goddesses of Polyolbion, sea-gods of the island
beaches—bathing in a ceaseless tumble of white water. And here
the city griffon spouts from its beak, the royal lion from between
its jaws. St. George at the foot of the Cathedral rides down a
dragon whose nostrils spout, not fire, but the clear water of
the New River. In front of the India House, four elephants of
black marble, endorsed with towers of white, blow through their
upturned trunks the copious symbol of Eastern wealth. In the gardens
of the Tower sits Charles the Second, enthroned among a troop
of Muses, Cardinal Virtues, Graces and Hours. The tower of the
Customs-House is a pharos. A great water-gate, the symbol of naval
triumph, spans the Fleet at its junction with the Thames. The
river is embanked from Blackfriars to the Tower, and at every
twenty paces a grave stone angel looks out from the piers of the
balustrade across the water....</p>

<p>Gumbril Senior expounded his city with passion. He pointed to
the model on the ground, he lifted his arms and turned up his
eyes to suggest the size and splendour of his edifices. His hair
blew wispily loose and fell into his eyes, and had to be brushed
impatiently back again. He pulled at his beard; his spectacles
flashed, as though they were living eyes. Looking at him, Gumbril
Junior could imagine that he saw before him the passionate and
gesticulating silhouette of one of those old shepherds who stand
at the base of Piranesi’s ruins demonstrating obscurely the prodigious
grandeur and the abjection of the human race. </p>
