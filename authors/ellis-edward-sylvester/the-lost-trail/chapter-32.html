<p>Although Jack Carleton and Otto Relstaub understood nothing of
the conversation (excepting the few words of mangled English)
between Wish-o-wa-tum, the Osage chieftain, and the Shawanoe who
entered his lodge, little was lost upon Deerfoot.</p>

<p>Without quoting the language, it may be said that Arorara declared
the two boys to be thieves and wretches of the worst imaginable
degree.  They had stolen the horses of the Shawanoes and Miamis,
and had treacherously shot, not only the warriors, but the squaws
and papooses, when they lay asleep by their camp-fires.</p>

<p>Arorara said he had been sent by his people to follow across
the river, and punish them for their many crimes.  His purpose
in placing the guns as he had done, near the entrance of the lodge,
was to tempt the boys to make a rush to escape.</p>

<p>When they did so, Arorara proposed that he and Wish-o-wa-tum
should leap upon them with knives.</p>

<p>When this plan was fully explained to the chief, he nodded his
head and signified that he would willingly lend his hand.  It
was a matter of indifference to him, and, but for the coming of
the Shawanoe, he probably would have allow the boys to depart
without harm.  With Wish-o-wa-tum the whole question resolved
itself into one of policy.  He lived alone and had never been
disturbed by the white settlers, who were locating in different
parts of the territory. If he should help in the taking off of
youngsters, their friends would not be likely to suspect him,
and there was little probability of the truth ever reaching their
ears.</p>

<p>But, if he refused the request of the guest, the fierce tribe
to which he belonged would be sure to go out of their way to punish
him.  He therefore gave his assent, and added that he was ready
do his part whenever Arorara wished.</p>

<p>It was at that juncture that the two red men essayed expression
in English, and Deerfoot saw that he must interfere at once. 
While moving to the front of the lodge, he scanned his immediate
surroundings, so far as he could, but neither saw nor heard anything
of the other Shawanoe.  In short, from what has already been told,
it will be seen that it was impossible for him to be in that vicinity.</p>

<p>Throwing back the deerskin, the youthful warrior stepped quickly
within the wigwam.  His bow was flung over his back, and, being
perfectly familiar with the interior, he extended his hand and
caught up the weapon nearest him, standing erect and facing all
the occupants as did Arorara a short time before.  This movement
and the entrance itself were made with such deftness that no one
observed his presence, with the exception of Otto Relstaub, who
by accident happened to look toward him just as he entered.</p>

<p>But the startling words of the German lad, accompanied by the
extension of his arm and finger toward the door, turned every
eye like a flash in that direction.  They were just in time to
catch a glimpse of the arms of Deerfoot, as they were raised like
the flitting of the wings of a bird, and almost in the same breath
the youth was seen to be looking along the gleaming barrel pointed
the breast of the astounded warrior.</p>

<p>"Dog of a Shawanoe!" exclaimed Deerfoot, his voice as firm and
unwavering as his nerves; "coward!  Serpent that creeps in the
grass and strikes the heel of the hunter; Arorara speaks with
a double tongue; he says he took the scalp of Deerfoot, but the
scalp of Deerfoot is here, and he dares Arorara and Waughtauk
and Tecumseh and all the chiefs and sachems and warriors of the
Shawanoes, to take it!"</p>

<p>The rifle, with the hammer drawn back, was flung to the ground,
and whipping out his hunting knife, the youth grasped the handle
with fingers of steel and assumed a defiant attitude. His face
was aflame with passion, and his breast became a raging volcano
of wrath.</p>

<p>In truth, Deerfoot had lost control of himself for the moment. 
An overwhelming sense of his persecution caused his nature to
revolt, and he longed for the excuse to leap upon the Shawanoe
who had followed him across the Mississippi.  There was a single
moment when he gathered his muscles for a tiger-like bound at
his enemy, he was restrained only by the pitiful expression on
the terrified countenance.</p>

<p>The youth addressed his words to Arorara and his blazing eyes
were fixed on him.  He had no quarrel with Wish-o-wa-tum and understood
his position, but he would not have shrunk from an attack by both.
Deerfoot knew that either was more powerful than he, but in cat-like
agility there could be no comparison between them.</p>

<p>Man-not-Afraid-of-Thunder, however, showed very plainly that
he held the invader of his lodge in great fear.  He displayed
visible emotion, when listening to the ringing words of defiance;
but he possessed sense enough to perceive they were not addressed
to him, and he continued to smoke his pipe in silence.</p>

<p>The squaw at the further end of the wigwam started, and with
the pipe in her grasp, stared with a dazed expression at the daring
intruder; then, like the true mother the world over, she leaned
forward, caught up her sleeping infant and held him to her breast,
ready to defend him with her life.</p>

<p>Arorara looked in turn straight into the burning countenance
of Deerfoot.  The elder warrior had unconsciously assumed an admirable
pose, his left foot forward, his hand resting on the handle of
his tomahawk, his whole position that of a gathering his strength
for a tremendous leap.  But though his fingers toyed with the
weapon at his waist, they did not draw it forth; it was for that
precise signal the youth was waiting.</p>

<p>While in this attitude, which might have been accepted as indicating
the most heroic courage, Deerfoot saw the lump or Adam's apple
rise sink in his throat, precisely as if he were to swallow something.
It was done twice, and was a sign of weakness on the part of Arorara.</p>

<p>The consuming anger of Deerfoot burned out like a flash of powder.
Hatred became contempt; enmity turned to scorn, and the mortal
peril of the warrior vanished.</p>

<p>"Who now is the dog?" asked Deerfoot in English, with a curl
of his lip.  "Arorara is brave when he stands before the youths
who have no weapons; he then speaks with the double tongue; he
cannot utter the truth.  Arorara has his tomahawk and knife, Deerfoot
has his; let them fight and see whose scalp shall remain."</p>

<p>"Don't you do dot, old Roarer," exclaimed Otto Relstaub, stepping
forward in much excitement; "if you does, den you won't be old
Roarer not any more, as nefer vose-yaw!  Dunderation!"</p>

<p>"Let them alone," commanded Jack Carleton, catching his arm and
drawing him back; "don't interfere."</p>

<p>"Don't you sees?" asked Otto, turning his head and speaking in
a whisper; "I want to scare old Roarer."</p>

<p>"There's no call for doing that, for he's so seared now he can't
speak; he won't fight Deerfoot."</p>

<p>Arorara possessed less courage than Tecumseh, who, when challenged
by Deerfoot in almost the same manner, would have fought him to
the death had not others interposed.  The Shawanoe was now in
mortal terror of such an encounter.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot and Arorara are brothers," said he, swallowing again
the lump that rose in his throat; "they belong to the same totem;
they are Shawanoes; the Great Spirit would frown to see them harm
each other."</p>

<p>The words were spoken in Shawanoe, but Jack and Otto saw, from
the looks and manner of the elder warrior, that he was subdued
and could not be forced into a struggle with the lithe and willowy
youth.</p>

<p>It was not flattering to the pride of the young Kentuckian and
his companion that while Arorara felt no fear of them jointly,
he was terrified by the bearing of Deerfoot, who voluntarily relinquished
the advantage he possessed in the hope that it would induce the
other to fight.</p>

<p>The abject words of Arorara caused a reaction in the feelings
of Deerfoot.  His conscience condemned him for his outburst of
passion, and had the situation permitted, he would have prostrated
himself in prayer and begged the forgiveness of  the Great Spirit
whom he had offended.</p>

<p>But nothing in his face or voice or manner betrayed the change.</p>

<p>He remained standing in front of the deerskin, which was thrown
back, so that the light from the camp-fire shone against the gloom
beyond; his left hand held the knife with the same rigid grasp,
and the limbs, which in the American Indian rarely show much muscular
development, were as drawn as steel.</p>

<p>The squaw clasped the sleeping infant to her husky bosom and
glared at Deerfoot, like a lioness at bay.  Had he advanced to
do harm to her offspring, she would have sprang upon him with
the fierceness of that beast and defended the little one to the
death.  Had the youth assailed Man-not-Afraid-of-Thunder, probably
she would have sat an interested spectator of the scene until
it became clear which way it was going, when she might have wrapped
her baby in bison-skin, placed him carefully away, and taken a
part in the struggle.</p>

<p>The Osage resumed the deliberate puffing of his pipe, but glanced
from one face to the other of the two Shawanoes.  Stolid and lazy
as he was, by nature and training, he could not help feeling stirred
by the curious scene.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton and Otto were on their feet, studying the two countenances
with equal intentness.  Both were cheered by the consciousness
that danger no longer threatened them, and that whatever followed
must accord with the fact that Deerfoot the Shawanoe was master
of the situation.</p>
