<p>To the westward the Black Hills thrust their vast rugged summits
against the wintry sky; to the south, a spur of the same mountains
put out toward the frontier town of Buffalo Gap; to the north-east
wound the Big Cheyenne, on its way to the Missouri, and marking
through a part of its course the southern boundary of the Cheyenne
Reservation, while creek, stream, and river crossed the rolling
plain that intervened, and over all stretched the sunless sky,
from which the snow-flakes were eddying and whirling to the frozen
earth below.</p>

<p>But Brinton Kingsland had no eye for any of these things, upon
which he had looked many a time and oft.  His thoughts were with
those loved ones in the humble cabin, still miles away, toward
the towering mountains, while his immediate anxiety was about
the hostiles that had appeared in his front and were now circling
to the northward as if to meet Wolf Ear, the young Ogalalla, who
was galloping in the face of the biting gale and rapidly drawing
toward them.</p>

<p>Brinton's expectation that they would lose no time in coming
together was not precisely fulfilled, for while the horsemen were
yet a long way off, they swerved sharply, as though they identified
the youth for the first time.</p>

<p>"They intend to give me some attention," was his thought, "without
waiting for Wolf Ear to join them.  They know that I belong to
the white race, and that is enough."</p>

<p>The youth did not feel any special alarm for himself, for he
was confident that Jack was as fleet-footed as any of the animals
bestrode by the hostiles, and would leave them behind in a fair
race. He noticed that the Ogalalla was mounted on a superior beast,
but he did not believe he could outspeed Jack.</p>

<p>But it would never do to meet those half-dozen horsemen that
had faced toward him, and were approaching at the same swinging
gallop. Brinton diverged more to the left, thus leaving the trail,
and they also changed their course, as if to head him off.</p>

<p>"If it is to be a race, I am throwing away my chances by helping
to shorten the distance between us."</p>

<p>The fugitive now headed directly away from the horsemen, so that
both parties were pursuing the same line.  The youth looked back,
at the moment that several blue puffs of smoke showed over the
backs of the horses.  The thudding reports came through the chilly
air, and a peculiar whistling sound overhead left no doubt that
the hostiles, great as was the separating space, had fired at
the fugitive, who turned to take a look at Wolf Ear.</p>

<p>That individual discharged his gun the next moment.  Brinton
heard nothing of the bullet, but smiled grimly&mdash;</p>

<p>"He has changed his mind soon, but they have got to come closer
before they hurt me.  He is no great marksman anyway, or he would
not have missed me a little while ago."</p>

<p>It was singular that it did not occur to young Kingsland that
it was possible the Ogalalla had not fired at him at all.  Not
even when the horsemen checked their pursuit, and reining up their
animals awaited the coming of the buck, who was riding like a
hurricane, could he bring himself to think of Wolf Ear except
as a bitter enemy, who for some subtle purpose of his own had
declared a temporary truce.</p>

<p>"I suppose they think I shall be along this way again pretty
soon, and they can afford to wait till I run into their trap,"
was the conclusion of Brinton, who headed his pony once more toward
his home, and put him to his best paces.</p>

<p>"Come, Jack, there's no time to throw away; hard work is before
you, and you must struggle as never before."</p>

<p>The snowfall which seemed for ever impending did not come.  The
few scattering flakes still circled and eddied through the air,
as if reluctant to touch the earth, but no perceptible increase
appeared in their number.  The nipping air seemed to have become
too cold to permit a snow-storm.</p>

<p>Brinton had set out fully prepared for such change of temperature.
He wore a thick woollen cap, whose flaps were drawn down to his
ears, while they were more than met by the heavy coat collar that
was turned up, the garment itself being closely buttoned around
his body. His rifle rested across the pommel of his saddle in
front, and his gloved hands scarcely ever touched the rein which
lay loose on his pony's neck.  He was a capital horseman, and,
with the understanding between him and his intelligent beast,
could have got along without any bit at all.</p>

<p>Strapped behind him was a substantial lunch, and his keen appetite
would have made it enjoyable, but he did not disturb it.  It could
wait until he learned the truth about the folk at home, which
he was now rapidly drawing near.</p>

<p>Over a swell in the prairie, across a small creek, whose icy
waters hardly came above Jack's fetlocks, up a second rise, and
then Brinton Kingsland uttered an exclamation of amazement and
sharply checked his animal.</p>

<p>"My gracious! what is the meaning of that?"</p>

<p>Over another swell, and only a few hundred yards away, two other
horses rode to view, coming directly toward him.  Each sustained
a heavily muffled figure, and they were moving at a rapid walk.</p>

<p>Suspecting their identity, he waited a minute, and then started
his horse forward again.  A few paces, and despite the arctic
temperature, he raised his cap from his head and called out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hurrah! thank Heaven, you are alive, and have started for the
agency."</p>

<p>His father sat on one horse, swathed in heavy clothing, and a
blanket which the faithful wife had fastened around his emaciated
and weak form, while she, with Edith in front, and both also protected
against the severe weather, were on the other animal.  He had
a rifle across his saddle front, like the son, and they had brought
with them nothing but a small amount of food, barely enough to
last them until they could reach the agency, provided there was
no unexpected delay on the road.</p>

<p>The discovery that they were alive and secure for the time, though
the shadow of a great peril was over all, so delighted the son
that he could not repress the shout of joy, as he rode forward
and greeted them, little more than their eyes and noses showing
through the thick coverings.</p>

<p>"What made you leave before I got back?" was the first inquiry
of Brinton, after a few congratulatory words.</p>

<p>"We concluded it was high time to do so," replied the father,
showing more vigour in his voice than the son expected.</p>

<p>"How did you find it out?"</p>

<p>"A half-dozen hostiles fired several times at the house, and
then, as if they feared they were not strong enough to capture
us and burn the cabin, rode off for help."</p>

<p>"They are hardly out of sight now; they gave me half a dozen
shots, and I had a short chase with them.  But you are off the
trail."</p>

<p>"And so are you," said his father.</p>

<p>"Which is a mighty good thing for us both.  You had to abandon
everything?"</p>

<p>"Of course; I have no doubt though," added the father grimly,
"that the Indians will look after the live stock for us."</p>

<p>"Whom do you suppose I saw?" asked Brinton, turning to his mother
and sister.</p>

<p>"A big bear?" ventured Edith from the depths of her wrappings.</p>

<p>"No; he was an old friend of yours &mdash;Wolf Ear, who used
to come to our house and have such good times with you."</p>

<p>The excited child flung her arms about in the effort to free
herself of the encumbering wrappings.</p>

<p>"Oh, where is he?  Why didn't he come with you?  Didn't he want
to see me?  I am so sorry; isn't he with you?"</p>

<p>And she peered around, as if she suspected the young Ogalalla
was hiding behind the saddle of her brother.</p>

<p>Brinton smiled, and then gravely shook his head.  He said, addressing
his parents more than the little one&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was never more astonished than to find that Wolf Ear, despite
the training he has had at Carlisle, has joined the hostiles,
and is now an enemy of those who were such good friends of his."</p>

<p>The youth did not think it wise to tell, in the presence of his
sister, the particulars of their first meeting.</p>

<p>"You grieve me more than I can express," replied the father;
"are you sure you are not mistaken?"</p>

<p>"Not when he told me so himself."</p>

<p>"But you must have met as friends."</p>

<p>"He said he would not harm any one of us, if the fortunes of
war should give him the chance; but he declares himself the enemy
of all others of our race.  He has a twin brother, and he and
his father and mother, as Wolf Ear coolly told me, would be pleased
to scalp us.  I have no more faith in <em>him</em> than in <em>them</em>. 
We parted as friends, but he has joined that very party which
fired on you, and will go back to the house with them."</p>

<p>"And finding us gone, what then?"</p>

<p>"He will lead them on our trail and be among the foremost to
shoot us down, every one of us."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!" called Edith from her wraps, which her
mother had put around her again; "I like Wolf Ear and want to
see him."</p>

<p>Brinton did not think it worth while to discuss the matter with
his sister, for a far more important matter pressed upon them.</p>

<p>"It won't do to follow the trail," remarked the father, "since
they will be on the look-out for us.  We will bear to the south,
so as to strike the Cheyenne further up stream."</p>

<p>"We may not be able to ford it."</p>

<p>"We can follow it down till we find a place.  It may be frozen
over nearer its source.  The agency is so far off that we shall
have to go into camp before we can get half-way there."</p>

<p>"How do you feel, father?" abruptly asked his son, glancing keenly
at him.  "Are you strong enough to stand this hard ride?"</p>

<p>"I am much stronger than you would suppose; you know a crisis
like this will rouse any man, even if he is a good deal more unwell
than I am."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you talk that way, but you will be tried hard
before we reach Pine Ridge."</p>

<p>"Give yourself no uneasiness about me; the only thing we are
to think about is how we shall get to the agency without meeting
with the hostiles, who seem to be roaming everywhere."</p>

<p>While they sat talking, at the base of the swell, on the summit
of which the parents had first appeared, all partook of lunch,
for it was not likely they would have a more favourable opportunity
before the coming of night.</p>

<p>It was decided to bear still more to the south, with a view of
avoiding the party that was at no great distance.  Indeed, less
than half an hour had passed since they vanished from the view
of the youth, who believed they were waiting in the vicinity of
the trail for his return, and would attack the whites the moment
they discovered them.</p>

<p>The halt lasted little more than a quarter of an hour, when they
resumed their journey toward the agency, which they hoped, rather
than expected, to reach by the morrow's set of sun.  The mother
was without any weapon, though she was quite skilful in the use
of a rifle.  Her husband said that if he found himself compelled
to yield to weakness, he would turn over his Winchester to her,
believing as he did that she was sure to give a good account of
herself.</p>

<p>They were plentifully supplied with cartridges, but the reader
does not need to be reminded of their almost helpless situation.
Kingsland, despite his brave efforts to keep up, was unable to
ride his pony at full speed for any length of time, while the
wife, burdened with the care of Edith, could not expect to do
much better.</p>

<p>If the company were attacked by any party of hostiles, however
slight in numbers, deplorable consequences were almost certain. 
Their hope would be in finding some sort of shelter which might
be turned to account as a screen or barricade.</p>

<p>But their only safety, it may be said, lay in avoiding the Indians
altogether, and it was to that task that Brinton, as the strongest
one of the party, addressed himself with all the energy and skill
of his nature.</p>

<p>The course was up and down continually, though none of the swells
in the prairie was of much height.  The youth rode slightly in
advance and never made his way to the top of one of the slight
elevations without a quicker throbbing of the heart and a misgiving
which made the situation of the most trying nature.</p>

<p>It was the dread of the hostiles, with whom Wolf Ear had joined
himself, that led him to make a longer bend to the south than
even his father had contemplated.  True, as he well knew, they
were not the sole Indians to be dreaded, but they were the only
ones of whom he had positive knowledge.  Others were likely to
be encountered at any time, and it may be said that as they drew
nearer the agency, the peril increased.</p>

<p>A half-dozen miles from where the family had been reunited, they
approached a higher elevation than any that had yet been crossed.
Brinton asked the rest to halt at the base, while he dismounted
and carefully went to the top on foot.</p>

<p>It was well he took this precaution, for his friends, who were
watching his crouching figure as he cautiously went up the incline,
saw him abruptly halt and peer over the ridge, in a way which
showed he had perceived something.  He remained but a minute,
when he hurried back, pale and excited.</p>

<p>"There are fifty hostiles!" he exclaimed in an undertone, "and
they are only a little way off!"</p>
