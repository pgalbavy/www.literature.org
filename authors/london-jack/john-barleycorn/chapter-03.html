I was five years old the first time I got drunk.  It was on a hot
day, and my father was ploughing in the field.  I was sent from
the house, half a mile away, to carry to him a pail of beer.  "And
be sure you don't spill it," was the parting injunction.
<P>
It was, as I remember it, a lard pail, very wide across the top,
and without a cover.  As I toddled along, the beer slopped over
the rim upon my legs.  And as I toddled, I pondered.  Beer was a
very precious thing.  Come to think of it, it must be wonderfully
good.  Else why was I never permitted to drink of it in the house?
Other things kept from me by the grown-ups I had found good.  Then
this, too, was good.  Trust the grown-ups.  They knew.  And,
anyway, the pail was too full.  I was slopping it against my legs
and spilling it on the ground.  Why waste it? And no one would
know whether I had drunk or spilled it.
<P>
I was so small that, in order to negotiate the pail, I sat down
and gathered it into my lap.  First I sipped the foam.  I was
disappointed.  The preciousness evaded me.  Evidently it did not
reside in the foam.  Besides, the taste was not good.  Then I
remembered seeing the grown-ups blow the foam away before they
drank.  I buried my face in the foam and lapped the solid liquid
beneath.  It wasn't good at all.  But still I drank.  The grown-
ups knew what they were about.  Considering my diminutiveness, the
size of the pail in my lap, and my drinking out of it my breath
held and my face buried to the ears in foam, it was rather
difficult to estimate how much I drank.  Also, I was gulping it
down like medicine, in nauseous haste to get the ordeal over.
<P>
I shuddered when I started on, and decided that the good taste
would come afterward.  I tried several times more in the course of
that long half-mile.  Then, astounded by the quantity of beer that
was lacking, and remembering having seen stale beer made to foam
afresh, I took a stick and stirred what was left till it foamed to
the brim.
<P>
And my father never noticed.  He emptied the pail with the wide
thirst of the sweating ploughman, returned it to me, and started
up the plough.  I endeavoured to walk beside the horses.  I
remember tottering and falling against their heels in front of the
shining share, and that my father hauled back on the lines so
violently that the horses nearly sat down on me.  He told me
afterward that it was by only a matter of inches that I escaped
disembowelling.  Vaguely, too, I remember, my father carried me in
his arms to the trees on the edge of the field, while all the
world reeled and swung about me, and I was aware of deadly nausea
mingled with an appalling conviction of sin.
<P>
I slept the afternoon away under the trees, and when my father
roused me at sundown it was a very sick little boy that got up and
dragged wearily homeward.  I was exhausted, oppressed by the
weight of my limbs, and in my stomach was a harp-like vibrating
that extended to my throat and brain.  My condition was like that
of one who had gone through a battle with poison.  In truth, I had
been poisoned.
<P>
In the weeks and months that followed I had no more interest in
beer than in the kitchen stove after it had burned me.  The grown-
ups were right.  Beer was not for children.  The grown-ups didn't
mind it; but neither did they mind taking pills and castor oil. 
As for me, I could manage to get along quite well without beer. 
Yes, and to the day of my death I could have managed to get along
quite well without it.  But circumstance decreed otherwise.  At
every turn in the world in which I lived, John Barleycorn
beckoned.  There was no escaping him.  All paths led to him.  And
it took twenty years of contact, of exchanging greetings and
passing on with my tongue in my cheek, to develop in me a sneaking
liking for the rascal.
