<p>As the light of morning overspread the stream and prairie, I
felt an unspeakable sense of relief. Not a moment of sleep had
visited me that night, although Nat’s extreme fear toward midnight
gave way to his drowsiness, and he slept long and heavily.</p>

<p>"Come, wake up, Nat!" said I, shaking him as soon as I saw that
day was at hand.</p>

<p>"How? what’s the matter?" said he, rubbing his eyes, and gaping
confusedly about him.</p>

<p>"Day is at hand, and we must be on our way to Oregon."</p>

<p>He hastily rose, and we commenced our simple preparations. I
ran up the river bank, and swept the prairie to the south of us
to satisfy myself that no wandering Indians were in sight. The
whole plain was visible, and with a feeling akin to joy, I reported
the fact to Nat. He, however, was not satisfied with my survey,
as he had more than once before detected objects that had escaped
my vision, and he ascended a high roll in the bank, some distance
up, and took a long, careful, scrutinizing sweep of the whole
horizon. Feeling satisfied that he would be no more rewarded for
his pains than I was, I started the fire, and commenced cooking
some of our buffalo, I had been engaged in this for a minute or
so, when I heard Nat call, in a hoarse, anxious, half-whisper:</p>

<p>"Come here, quick!"</p>

<p>I hurried to his side and eagerly asked him the cause of agitation.</p>

<p>"Why, just look yonder, if that ain’t enough to agitate one,
then I don’t know what is."</p>

<p>He pointed across the river, out upon the prairie; and following
the direction of his finger, I saw not more than a mile or two
away a single horseman proceeding leisurely from us.</p>

<p>"Who can that be?" I asked half to myself, still watching the
receding figure.</p>

<p>"Why he’s the one that sent that bullet across the water after
us, and I’m thinking it’s lucky for him, he’s going another way.
If I should get my hands on him, he would remember the time."</p>

<p>And Nat extended his arms energetically, and shook his head spitefully
by way of emphasizing his remark.</p>

<p>I continued gazing after the unknown person. At first I supposed
it was an Indian, but at that distance, and with his back toward
us, it was almost impossible to judge accurately. A moment’s thought
convinced me that it was a white man. I could make out the hunting-cap
of the trapper, and was soon satisfied he belonged to that class.
His horse was walking leisurely along, and he seemed totally unaware
of the proximity of strangers.</p>

<p>But who could it be? Was it he who had fired the well-nigh fatal
shot? And what meant his actions in thus willfully leaving us?
These and similar questions I asked myself, without taking my
eyes from him, or heeding the numerous questions and remarks my
companion was uttering. But, of course, I could give no satisfactory
solution, and when his figure had grown to be but a dim speck
in the distance, I turned to Nat.</p>

<p>"We may see him again; but, if I don’t know him, I know one thing,
I’m wonderfully hungry just now."</p>

<p>We partook of a hearty breakfast, my appetite for which was considerably
weakened by the occurrence just narrated. Without much difficulty
we forded the Republican Fork, being compelled only to swim a
few strokes in the channel, and reached the opposite side, with
dry powder and food.</p>

<p>Here we made a careful search of the shore, and ascertained enough
to settle beyond a doubt the identity of the horseman with the
would-be assassin of the night before. His footprints could be
seen, and the place where he had slept upon the ground, together
with the scraps of meat. By examining the tracks of his horse,
we discovered that both hind feet were shod; this decided our
question of his being a white man; and although it cleared up
one doubt, left us in a greater one. He could not have avoided
the knowledge that we were of the same blood, and what demoniacal
wish could lead him to seek the life of two harmless wanderers?
Be he who he might, it was with no very Christian feelings toward
him that we took the trail of his horse, and pursued it.</p>

<p>Our course after the first five miles, swerved considerably to
the northwest. From the actions of the stranger, it was evident
he understood the character of the country, and we judged the
shortest way of reaching the Oregon trail would be by following
him. The footprints of his animal were distinctly marked, and
we had no difficulty in keeping them.</p>

<p>At noon we forded a stream, and shortly after another, both considerably
less than the Republican Fork. On the northern bank of the latter,
were the still glowing coals of the stranger’s camp-fire, and
we judged he could be at no great distance. The country here was
of a slightly different character from the rolling prairie over
which we had journeyed thus far. There were hills quite elevated,
and, now and then, groves of timber. In the river bottoms were
numerous cottonwoods and elder; these natural causes so obstructed
our view, that we might approach our unknown enemy very nigh without
knowing it. Nat was quite nervous, and invariably sheered off
from the forbidding groves of timber, striking the trail upon
the opposite side at a safe distance.</p>

<p>In this way we traveled onward through the entire day. No signs
of Indians were seen, and we anticipated little trouble from them,
as they were friendly at this time, and the most they would do
would be to rob us of some of our trinkets or rifles.</p>

<p>At sundown we left our guiding trail and struck off toward a
small stream to camp for the night. When we reached it, and decided
upon the spot, Nat remarked seriously:</p>

<p>"I say, Relmond, that feller might be near enough to give us
another shot afore morning, and I’m going to see whether his trail
crosses the brook out there or not."</p>

<p>So saying, he wheeled and ran back to the spot where we had left
it. It was still bright enough to follow it, and bending his head
down to keep it in view, he continued upon a rapid run. I was
upon the point of warning him against thus running into danger,
but not feeling much apprehension for his safety, I turned my
back toward him. A minute after, I heard his footsteps again,
and, looking up, saw him coming with full speed toward me, his
eyes dilated to their utmost extent, and with every appearance
of terror.</p>

<p>"He’s there!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Where?" I asked, catching his excitement.</p>

<p>"Just across the stream up there; I liked to have run right into
him afore I knowed it. See there!"</p>

<p>As Nat spoke, I saw the glimmering of a fire through the trees,
and heard the whinny of a horse.</p>

<p>"Didn’t he see you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know he did. When I splashed into the water like a fool,
he looked up at me and grunted; I seen him pick up his rifle,
and then I put, expecting each moment to feel a ball in me."</p>

<p>"I thought you intended laying hands on him if an opportunity
offered," I remarked, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"I declare, I forgot that," he replied, somewhat crestfallen.</p>

<p>After some further conversation, I decided to make the acquaintance
of the person who had occupied so much of our thoughts. Nat opposed
this, and urged me to get farther from him; but a meaning hint
changed his views at once, and he readily acquiesced. He would
not be prevailed upon, however, to accompany me, but promised
to come to my aid if I should need help during the interview.
So leaving him, I started boldly up the stream.</p>

<p>When I reached the point opposite the stranger’s camp-fire, I
stumbled and coughed so as to attract his attention. I saw him
raise his eyes and hurriedly scan me, but he gave no further evidence
of anxiety, and I unhesitatingly sprang across the stream, and
made my way toward him. Before I halted, I saw that he was a trapper.
He was reclining upon the ground, before a small fire, and smoking
a short black pipe, in a sort of dreamy reverie.</p>

<p>"Good evening, my friend," I said, cheerfully, approaching within
a few feet of him. He raised his eyes a moment, and then suffered
them lazily to fall again, and continue their vacant stare into
the fire. "Quite a pleasant evening," I continued, seating myself
near him.</p>

<p>"Umph!" he grunted, removing his pipe, and rising to the upright
position. He looked at me a second with a pair of eyes of sharp,
glittering blackness, and then asked: "Chaw, stranger?"</p>

<p>"I sometimes use the weed, but not in that form," I replied,
handing a piece to him. He wrenched off a huge mouthful with a
vigorous twist of his head, and returned it without a word. This
done, he sank back to his former position and reverie.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, friend," said I, moving rather impatiently, and determined
to force a conversation upon him, "but I hope you will permit
a few questions?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead, stranger," he answered, gruffly.</p>

<p>"Are you traveling alone in this section?"</p>

<p>"I reckon I ar’, ’cept the hoss which ’ar a team."</p>

<p>"Follow trapping and hunting, I presume?"</p>

<p>"What’s yer handle, stranger?" he suddenly asked, as he came
to the upright position, and looking at me with more interest.</p>

<p>"William Relmond, from New Jersey."</p>

<p>"Whar’s that place?"</p>

<p>"It is one of the Middle States, quite a distance from here."</p>

<p>"What mought you be doin’ in these parts?"</p>

<p>"I and my friend out yonder are on our way to Oregon."</p>

<p>"Umph! you’re pretty green ’uns."</p>

<p>"Now I suppose you will have no objection to giving me your name."</p>

<p>"My handle’s Bill Biddon, and I’m on my way to trappin’-grounds
up country."</p>

<p>"How far distant?"</p>

<p>"A heap; somewhar up ’bove the Yallerstone."</p>

<p>"Do you generally go upon these journeys alone?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "What’s your handle, stranger?"]</p>

<p>"Sometimes I does, and sometimes I doesn’t."</p>

<p>I ceased my questions for a few moments, for fear of provoking
him. As his route, as far as it extended, would be in our direction,
I determined to keep his company if I could gain his consent.
He was a splendid specimen of the physical man. He was rather
short, but heavy and thick-set, with a compactness of frame that
showed a terrible strength slumbering in his muscles. His face
was broad, covered by a thin, straggling beard of grizzled gray,
and several ridged scars were visible in different parts of it.
His brows were beetling and lowering, and beneath them a couple
of black eyes fairly snapt at times with electric fire. His mouth
was broad, and though one could plainly see a whirlwind of terrific
passion might be called into life within his breast, yet there
was, also in his face, the index of a heart alive to good humor
and frankness. I saw that, if approached skillfully, his heart
could be reached. He was evidently the creature of odd whims and
fancies and caprice, feeling as well satisfied without the society
of his fellow-man as with it&mdash;one of those strange beings, a hero
of a hundred perils, who was satisfied to lose his life in the
mighty wilderness of the Far West, without a single one suspecting
or caring for his fate.</p>

<p>"Would you have any objections to my friend and myself accompanying
you, that is, as far as you should proceed in our direction?"</p>

<p>He looked steadily at me a moment, and answered, "You kin go
with me ef you wants; but I knows as how you’re green, and yer
needn’t s’pose I’m goin’ to hold in fur yer. Yers as never does
that thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shouldn’t expect you to. Of course, we will make it a
point not to interfere in the least with your plans and movements."</p>

<p>"Whar is yer other chap? S’pose it war him what come peakin’
through yer a while ago; had a notion of spilin’ his picter fur
his imperdence."</p>

<p>"I will go bring him," I answered, rising and moving off. But
as I stepped across the stream, I discerned the top of Nat’s white
hat, just above a small box-elder; and moving on, saw his eye
fixed with an eager stare upon the trapper.</p>

<p>"Don’t he look savage?" he whispered, as I came to him.</p>

<p>"Not very. Are you afraid of him?"</p>

<p>"No; but I wonder whether he&mdash;whether he knows anything about
the old mare and my knife."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so; come and see. He just now asked for you."</p>

<p>"Asked for me?" repeated Nat, stepping back. "What does he want
of me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing in particular. I just mentioned your name, and he asked
where you were. Come along; I hope you ain’t afraid?"</p>

<p>"Afraid! I should like to see the man I’m afraid of!" exclaimed
my companion in an almost inaudible whisper, as he tremblingly
followed me across the brook, and to the spot where Biddon, the
trapper, was lying.</p>

<p>"My friend, Nathan Todd, Biddon."</p>

<p>"How are you? Very happy to make your acquaintance," and Nat
nervously extended his hand.</p>

<p>"How’re yer?" grunted Biddon, with a slight jerk of his head,
and not noticing the proffered hand.</p>

<p>"Been a most exceedingly beautiful day," ventured Nat, quickly
and nervously.</p>

<p>I saw the trapper was not particularly impressed with him, and
I took up the conversation. I made several unimportant inquiries,
and learned in the course of them, that our friend, Bill Biddon,
was about forty years of age, and had followed trapping and hunting
for over twenty years. He was a native of Missouri, and Westport
was the depot for his peltries. For the last two or three years
he had made all his excursions alone. He was quite a famous trapper,
and the fur company which he patronized gave him a fine outfit
and paid him well for his skins. He possessed a magnificently-mounted
rifle, and his horse, he informed me, had few superiors among
the fleetest mustangs of the south. Both of these were presented
him by the company mentioned.</p>

<p>"Why ain’t you got horses?" he asked, looking toward me.</p>

<p>"They were both stolen from us."</p>

<p>"I don’t s’pose you’ve seen anything of a company with a mare,
short-tailed, that limped a little, and an overcoat that had a
knife in the pocket?" asked Nat, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not that I knows on," answered Biddon, with a twinkle of humor.</p>

<p>I gave the particulars of our loss, and then asked, without due
thought:</p>

<p>"Did you not camp upon the banks of the Republican Fork last
night?"</p>

<p>"Yas; what’d yer want to know fur?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, nothing," quickly answered Nat.</p>

<p>I believe the trapper understood my allusion, and I hoped he
would give an explanation of his act; but he made no reference
to it, and, after further conversation, we all lay down in slumber.</p>
