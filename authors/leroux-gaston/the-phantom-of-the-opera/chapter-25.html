<p><em>THE PERSIAN'S NARRATIVE CONCLUDED</em></p>

<p>The discovery flung us into a state of alarm that made us forget
all our past and present sufferings.  We now knew all that the
monster meant to convey when he said to Christine Daae:</p>

<p>"Yes or no!  If your answer is no, everybody will be dead <em>AND
BURIED</em>!"</p>

<p>Yes, buried under the ruins of the Paris Grand Opera!</p>

<p>The monster had given her until eleven o'clock in the evening. 
He had chosen his time well.  There would be many people, many
"members of the human race," up there, in the resplendent theater. 
What finer retinue could be expected for his funeral?  He would
go down to the tomb escorted by the whitest shoulders in the world,
decked with the richest jewels.</p>

<p>Eleven o'clock to-morrow evening!</p>

<p>We were all to be blown up in the middle of the performance ... 
if Christine Daae said no!</p>

<p>Eleven o'clock to-morrow evening! ...</p>

<p>And what else could Christine say but no?  Would she not prefer
to espouse death itself rather than that living corpse?  She did
not know that on her acceptance or refusal depended the awful
fate of many members of the human race!</p>

<p>Eleven o'clock to-morrow evening!</p>

<p>And we dragged ourselves through the darkness, feeling our way
to the stone steps, for the light in the trap-door overhead that
led to the room of mirrors was now extinguished; and we repeated
to ourselves:</p>

<p>"Eleven o'clock to-morrow evening!"</p>

<p>At last, I found the staircase.  But, suddenly I drew myself
up on the first step, for a terrible thought had come to my mind:</p>

<p>"What is the time?"</p>

<p>Ah, what was the time? ... For, after all, eleven o'clock to-morrow
evening might be now, might be this very moment!  Who could tell
us the time?  We seemed to have been imprisoned in that hell for
days and days ... for years ... since the beginning of the world. 
Perhaps we should be blown up then and there!  Ah, a sound!  A
crack!  "Did you hear that? ... There, in the corner ... good
heavens! ...  Like a sound of machinery! ... Again! ... Oh, for
a light! ...  Perhaps it's the machinery that is to blow everything
up! ...  I tell you, a cracking sound:  are you deaf?"</p>

<p>M. de Chagny and I began to yell like madmen.  Fear spurred us
on.  We rushed up the treads of the staircase, stumbling as we
went, anything to escape the dark, to return to the mortal light
of the room of mirrors!</p>

<p>We found the trap-door still open, but it was now as dark in
the room of mirrors as in the cellar which we had left.  We dragged
ourselves along the floor of the torture-chamber, the floor that
separated us from the powder-magazine. What was the time?  We
shouted, we called: M. de Chagny to Christine, I to Erik.  I reminded
him that I had saved his life.  But no answer, save that of our
despair, of our madness: what was the time?  We argued, we tried
to calculate the time which we had spent there, but we were incapable
of reasoning.  If only we could see the face of a watch! ... 
Mine had stopped, but M. de Chagny's was still going ...  He told
me that he had wound it up before dressing for the Opera ... 
We had not a match upon us ...  And yet we must know ... M. de
Chagny broke the glass of his watch and felt the two hands...
He questioned the hands of the watch with his finger-tips, going
by the position of the ring of the watch ...  Judging by the space
between the hands, he thought it might be just eleven o'clock!</p>

<p>But perhaps it was not the eleven o'clock of which we stood in
dread. Perhaps we had still twelve hours before us!</p>

<p>Suddenly, I exclaimed:  "Hush!"</p>

<p>I seemed to hear footsteps in the next room.  Some one tapped
against the wall.  Christine Daae's voice said:</p>

<p>"Raoul!  Raoul!"  We were now all talking at once, on either
side of the wall.  Christine sobbed; she was not sure that she
would find M. de Chagny alive.  The monster had been terrible,
it seemed, had done nothing but rave, waiting for her to give
him the "yes" which she refused.  And yet she had promised him
that "yes," if he would take her to the torture-chamber. But he
had obstinately declined, and had uttered hideous threats against
all the members of the human race!  At last, after hours and hours
of that hell, he had that moment gone out, leaving her alone to
reflect for the last time.</p>

<p>"Hours and hours?  What is the time now?  What is the time, Christine?"</p>

<p>"It is eleven o'clock! Eleven o'clock, all but five minutes!"</p>

<p>"But which eleven o'clock?"</p>

<p>"The eleven o'clock that is to decide life or death! ... He told
me so just before he went ...  He is terrible ...  He is quite
mad: he tore off his mask and his yellow eyes shot flames! ...
He did nothing but laugh! ... He said, 'I give you five minutes
to spare your blushes! Here,' he said, taking a key from the little
bag of life and death, 'here is the little bronze key that opens
the two ebony caskets on the mantelpiece in the Louis-Philippe
room...  In one of the caskets, you will find a scorpion, in the
other, a grasshopper, both very cleverly imitated in Japanese
bronze: they will say yes or no for you.  If you turn the scorpion
round, that will mean to me, when I return, that you have said
yes.  The grasshopper will mean no.'  And he laughed like a drunken
demon.  I did nothing but beg and entreat him to give me the key
of the torture-chamber, promising to be his wife if he granted
me that request ...  But he told me that there was no future need
for that key and that he was going to throw it into the lake!
...  And he again laughed like a drunken demon and left me.  Oh,
his last words were, 'The grasshopper!  Be careful of the grasshopper! 
A grasshopper does not only turn:  it hops!  It hops!  And it
hops jolly high!'"</p>

<p>The five minutes had nearly elapsed and the scorpion and the
grasshopper were scratching at my brain.  Nevertheless, I had
sufficient lucidity left to understand that, if the grasshopper
were turned, it would hop ... and with it many members of the
human race! There was no doubt but that the grasshopper controlled
an electric current intended to blow up the powder-magazine!</p>

<p>M. de Chagny, who seemed to have recovered all his moral force
from hearing Christine's voice, explained to her, in a few hurried
words, the situation in which we and all the Opera were.  He told
her to turn the scorpion at once.</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Christine," I cried, "where are you?"</p>

<p>"By the scorpion."</p>

<p>"Don't touch it!"</p>

<p>The idea had come to me&mdash;for I knew my Erik&mdash;that the monster
had perhaps deceived the girl once more.  Perhaps it was the scorpion
that would blow everything up.  After all, why wasn't he there? 
The five minutes were long past ... and he was not back...  Perhaps
he had taken shelter and was waiting for the explosion!  ... Why
had he not returned? ... He could not really expect Christine
ever to consent to become his voluntary prey! ... Why had he not
returned?</p>

<p>"Don't touch the scorpion!"  I said.</p>

<p>"Here he comes!" cried Christine.  "I hear him!  Here he is!"</p>

<p>We heard his steps approaching the Louis-Philippe room.  He came
up to Christine, but did not speak.  Then I raised my voice:</p>

<p>"Erik!  It is I!  Do you know me?"</p>

<p>With extraordinary calmness, he at once replied:</p>

<p>"So you are not dead in there?  Well, then, see that you keep
quiet."</p>

<p>I tried to speak, but he said coldly:</p>

<p>"Not a word, daroga, or I shall blow everything up."  And he
added, "The honor rests with mademoiselle ...  Mademoiselle has
not touched the scorpion"&mdash;how deliberately he spoke!&mdash;"mademoiselle
has not touched the grasshopper"&mdash;with that composure!&mdash;"but it
is not too late to do the right thing.  There, I open the caskets
without a key, for I am a trap-door lover and I open and shut
what I please and as I please. I open the little ebony caskets:
mademoiselle, look at the little dears inside.  Aren't they pretty? 
If you turn the grasshopper, mademoiselle, we shall all be blown
up.  There is enough gun-powder under our feet to blow up a whole
quarter of Paris.  If you turn the scorpion, mademoiselle, all
that powder will be soaked and drowned. Mademoiselle, to celebrate
our wedding, you shall make a very handsome present to a few hundred
Parisians who are at this moment applauding a poor masterpiece
of Meyerbeer's ... you shall make them a present of their lives
...  For, with your own fair hands, you shall turn the scorpion
...  And merrily, merrily, we will be married!"</p>

<p>A pause; and then:</p>

<p>"If, in two minutes, mademoiselle, you have not turned the scorpion,
I shall turn the grasshopper ... and the grasshopper, I tell you,
<em>HOPS JOLLY HIGH</em>!"</p>

<p>The terrible silence began anew.  The Vicomte de Chagny, realizing
that there was nothing left to do but pray, went down on his knees
and prayed.  As for me, my blood beat so fiercely that I had to
take my heart in both hands, lest it should burst.  At last, we
heard Erik's voice:</p>

<p>"The two minutes are past ...  Good-by, mademoiselle...  Hop,
grasshopper!  "Erik," cried Christine, "do you swear to me, monster,
do you swear to me that the scorpion is the one to turn?</p>

<p>"Yes, to hop at our wedding."</p>

<p>"Ah, you see!  You said, to hop!"</p>

<p>"At our wedding, ingenuous child! ... The scorpion opens the
ball... But that will do! ... You won't have the scorpion?  Then
I turn the grasshopper!"</p>

<p>"Erik!"</p>

<p>"Enough!"</p>

<p>I was crying out in concert with Christine.  M. de Chagny was
still on his knees, praying.</p>

<p>"Erik!  I have turned the scorpion!"</p>

<p>Oh, the second through which we passed!</p>

<p>Waiting!  Waiting to find ourselves in fragments, amid the roar
and the ruins!</p>

<p>Feeling something crack beneath our feet, hearing an appalling
hiss through the open trap-door, a hiss like the first sound of
a rocket!</p>

<p>It came softly, at first, then louder, then very loud.  But it
was not the hiss of fire.  It was more like the hiss of water. 
And now it became a gurgling sound:  "Guggle!  Guggle!"</p>

<p>We rushed to the trap-door. All our thirst, which vanished when
the terror came, now returned with the lapping of the water.</p>

<p>The water rose in the cellar, above the barrels, the powder-barrels&mdash;"Barrels!
...  Barrels!  Any barrels to sell?"&mdash;and we went down to it with
parched throats.  It rose to our chins, to our mouths. And we
drank.  We stood on the floor of the cellar and drank. And we
went up the stairs again in the dark, step by step, went up with
the water.</p>

<p>The water came out of the cellar with us and spread over the
floor of the room.  If, this went on, the whole house on the lake
would be swamped.  The floor of the torture-chamber had itself
become a regular little lake, in which our feet splashed.  Surely
there was water enough now!  Erik must turn off the tap!</p>

<p>"Erik!  Erik!  That is water enough for the gunpowder!  Turn
off the tap!  Turn off the scorpion!"</p>

<p>But Erik did not reply.  We heard nothing but the water rising:
it was half-way to our waists!</p>

<p>"Christine!" cried M. de Chagny.  "Christine!  The water is up
to our knees!"</p>

<p>But Christine did not reply ...  We heard nothing but the water
rising.</p>

<p>No one, no one in the next room, no one to turn the tap, no one
to turn the scorpion!</p>

<p>We were all alone, in the dark, with the dark water that seized
us and clasped us and froze us!</p>

<p>"Erik!  Erik!"</p>

<p>"Christine!  Christine!"</p>

<p>By this time, we had lost our foothold and were spinning round
in the water, carried away by an irresistible whirl, for the water
turned with us and dashed us against the dark mirror, which thrust
us back again; and our throats, raised above the whirlpool, roared
aloud.</p>

<p>Were we to die here, drowned in the torture-chamber? I had never
seen that.  Erik, at the time of the rosy hours of Mazenderan,
had never shown me that, through the little invisible window.</p>

<p>"Erik!  Erik!"  I cried.  "I saved your life!  Remember! ...
You were sentenced to death!  But for me, you would be dead now!
...  Erik!"</p>

<p>We whirled around in the water like so much wreckage.  But, suddenly,
my straying hands seized the trunk of the iron tree!  I called
M. de Chagny, and we both hung to the branch of the iron tree.</p>

<p>And the water rose still higher.</p>

<p>"Oh!  Oh!  Can you remember?  How much space is there between
the branch of the tree and the dome-shaped ceiling?  Do try to
remember! ...  After all, the water may stop, it must find its
level! ... There, I think it is stopping! ... No, no, oh, horrible!
... Swim!  Swim for your life!"</p>

<p>Our arms became entangled in the effort of swimming; we choked;
we fought in the dark water; already we could hardly breathe the
dark air above the dark water, the air which escaped, which we
could hear escaping through some vent-hole or other.</p>

<p>"Oh, let us turn and turn and turn until we find the air hole
and then glue our mouths to it!"</p>

<p>But I lost my strength; I tried to lay hold of the walls!  Oh,
how those glass walls slipped from under my groping fingers! ...
We whirled round again! ... We began to sink!  ... One last effort!
... A last cry:  "Erik! ... Christine! ..."</p>

<p>"Guggle, guggle, guggle!" in our ears.  "Guggle!  Guggle!"  At
the bottom of the dark water, our ears went, "Guggle!  Guggle!"</p>

<p>And, before losing consciousness entirely, I seemed to hear,
between two guggles:</p>

<p>"Barrels!  Barrels!  Any barrels to sell?"</p>
