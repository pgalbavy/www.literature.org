<p>Ah, but Harvey Hamilton was sly. He began slowly creeping up
until his machine was directly over the rear passenger coach,
there being three beside the express car. Had he dropped a stone
from his perch, it would have fallen upon the roof of the last
one. The exultant expression on the myriad of faces took on a
tint of anxiety. The fireman yanked open the door of the fire-box
and shoveled in coal. No need of that, for 39 was already blowing
off, even when running at so high speed. Jim Halpine had drawn
over the long reversing lever till it stood within a few inches
of perpendicular and another shift would have choked the engine.</p>

<p>The young aviator held his place for a brief while and then began
gradually drifting back again. Bohunkus Johnson groaned.</p>

<p>"Confound it! what’s de use ob trying to be good?" he wailed;
"dem folks will grin dere heads off. Harv! make tings hum!"</p>

<p>Heedless of him, Harvey was carrying out his own scheme. He saw
that the game was his and he was playing with the locomotive.
When gaining on it, the airship was not doing its best, and his
slight retrogression was in order to make his victory more impressive.
Each contestant was going fully sixty miles an hour. No. 39 could
do no more, but the aeroplane had not yet extended herself. She
now proceeded to do so, inasmuch as in the circumstances the struggle
must soon terminate.</p>

<p>Having dropped well to the rear again, Harvey called upon the
motor to do its best. Its humming took on the character of a musical
tone, and the propeller spun around, twelve hundred revolutions
to the minute. The keenest eye could detect nothing of the ends
of the blades, and only faintly discern them nearer the shaft,
as if they were so much mist.</p>

<p>And then the biplane forged bravely ahead. She moved steadily
along over the roofs of the cars, one after the other, and pulled
away from the engine whose ponderous drivers appeared to be spinning
around with the dizzying swiftness of the propeller overhead.
Jim Halpine was utilizing every ounce of power, but could do no
more, for he was already doing his best. It humiliated him to
be thus left behind, but there was no help for it. In his chagrin
he tried a little trick which deceived no one, not even the two
victors. Pretending he detected something amiss on the rails,
he emitted a couple of blasts from his whistle and shut off steam.
It looked as if he was actuated by prudence, but the obstruction
was imaginary.</p>

<p>Most of the passengers like true sportsmen cheered the winner.
Even the grinning fireman circled his cap again about his tousled
head, but the engineer was glum and acted as if the only thing
in the world of interest to him was the rails stretching away
in front. What did he care for airships bobbing overhead? They
were only toys and could never amount to anything in the economy
of life.</p>

<p>As for Bohunkus Johnson he could not contain himself. Harvey
remained as calm as a veteran, and gave no attention to anything
except his machine, but his companion stood up in the hurricane
at the imminent risk of playing the mischief with the aeroplane’s
center of gravity, waved his cap and furiously beckoned the engineer
not to lag behind. His thick lips could be seen contorting themselves
and evidently he was saying something. Had the laughing passengers
been able to catch his words—which they were not—they would have
heard something like the following:</p>

<p>"Why doan’ yo’ trabel? Yo’s only walking; we ain’t half trying;
can’t yo’ put on more steam and make us show what we can do? I’m
plum disgusted wid yo’."</p>

<p>Harvey Hamilton did not speak. He was "letting out" the machine.
He meant to learn what it could do. When several hundred yards
ahead of the train, he lifted the lip of the rudder in front,
and the structure glided upward until he was a quarter of a mile
above the earth. Even then Bohunkus behaved so extravagantly that
the aviator turned his head and motioned to him to cease.</p>

<p>"Can’t doot, Harv! My mouf am so wide open dat it’ll take me
a good while to bring my jaws togeder agin, and I’m ready to tumble
out head fust."</p>

<p>By and by the colored youth toned down enough to resume his seat
and check his explosions of delight, though he looked around and
waved his hand several times at the train which was now so far
to the rear that his action was not understood.</p>

<p>"Gee! but it’s getting cold!" he exclaimed some minutes later,
with a shiver. He buttoned his thick coat to the chin, donned
his mittens, and wondered what it all meant. He had never understood,
though he had been told more than once, that temperature decreases
with increasing altitude. He had objected to donning such thick
garments when about to start on their flight, but Harvey was the
boss and insisted.</p>

<p>Bohunkus’s next surprise came when he looked between his feet.
They were directly over the city noticed some time before, but
the buildings were shrunken and mixed together in a way that even
he understood.</p>

<p>The anemometer suspended at the side of Harvey Hamilton showed
that the aeroplane was coursing through the air at the rate of
not quite a mile a minute. With the low temperature caused by
the altitude, the wind created in the still atmosphere cut the
faces of the two like a knife, and even penetrated their thick
clothing. Bohunkus turned up his coat collar, and drew his cap
over his ears, but his feet ached. He hoped the aviator would
soon strike milder weather, though the colored youth did not know
whether it was to be sought for above or below.</p>

<p>"If it gits colder as yo’ go up," he reflected between his chattering
teeth, "it must be orful cold when yo’ reach heben; I remember
now dat I was tole something ’bout dat, but I thought dey was
fooling me."</p>

<p>The front rudder still sloped upward, and Harvey showed no intention
of dropping lower or even of maintaining the level already reached.
He and his companion had started on a week or ten days’ outing,
and it struck him that now was as good a time as he was likely
to have for making a notable record.</p>

<p>So the propeller kept humming and they continued to climb. A
glance at the barograph by his side showed that he had reached
five thousand feet; to this he added another thousand, then another,
and he felt a thrill when the indicator made known he was close
to nine thousand.</p>

<p>Although, as you may know, several aviators have mounted almost
two miles, none had done so at the time of which I am now speaking.
Harvey was near the limit, and he had but to persevere a little
longer to achieve a grand triumph. But the cold was becoming almost
unbearable. In the hope of moderating the piercing chill, he lessened
his speed, but was not sensible of much improvement.</p>

<p>His unremitting attention was not needed and he turned his head
and looked at Bohunkus. The sight made him laugh. The negro had
not only drawn his upturned collar about his ears, with his cap
sunk low over them, and his mittened hands shoved into his pockets,
but he had shrunk within himself to that degree that only his
staring eyes and the tip of his nose were visible. He was hunched
together, and gave one of the best imitations imaginable of a
young man freezing to death.</p>

<p>"I know his race doesn’t like cold weather, but it won’t hurt
him," reflected Harvey with another look at his barograph. To
his astonishment, he had made no perceptible gain during the last
several minutes. He turned on full power and kept the forward
rudder inclined upward. He waited awhile before examining the
instrument again. So far as it could indicate he was not a foot
higher than before.</p>

<p>He was mystified. What could it mean? With the propeller revolving
more than a thousand times a minute, he ought to have risen a
half mile higher.</p>

<p>"I never heard of anything like it; the explanation is beyond
me."</p>

<p>With a thrill of misgiving, he glanced at the different parts
of the machine. There were the two slightly curving wings, measuring
thirty-five feet from tip to tip; the horizontal rudder on the
front outrigger responded easily to the levers, as he proved by
test; the ailerons or wing tips, one above the other, worked simultaneously
and with the same ease; the ash which formed the foundation of
the engine, the whitewood of the ribs, and the sprucewood of most
of the structure, all scraped and highly varnished, did not show
the least flaw. The rigidity which is indispensable in the framework
was maintained throughout. The rubberized linen covering of the
wings was taut and as smooth as silk, and the eye could not detect
the slightest wire or thing out of gear.</p>

<p>"Professor Sperbeck never told me anything of this, though if
he were here, he would understand it. I wonder whether we have
climbed any farther."</p>

<p>Another inspection of the instrument failed to show that the
biplane had ascended an inch.</p>

<p>"Can it be that our height has anything to do with it——"</p>

<p>Harvey Hamilton uttered an exclamation. The mystery was solved.
The aeroplane had risen so high that the rarefied air refused
to lift it farther. The propeller was whirling at its utmost velocity,
but the cold, thin atmosphere could sustain no more. It was impossible,
situated as he was, to go any higher.</p>

<p>"If Bohunkus wasn’t with me, I could rise a half mile or more,
but there’s no use of trying it now. Some time I’ll do it alone."</p>

<p>The limit marked was a trifle under nine thousand feet. It was
a notable exploit, but, as we know, it has been surpassed by other
aeroplanes, and more than doubled by aeronauts.</p>

<p>Another fact flashed upon Harvey: it was two hours since he and
his companion had started on the flight that was destined to be
a memorable one, and they were a hundred miles from home. There
could be only a small amount of gasoline left in the tank, and
it would be impossible to return without procuring more. Prudence
urged that he should lose no time in doing so. He slowly advanced
the control lever, the front rudder dipped downward and he began
approaching the earth. Some minutes must pass before they should
feel the pleasant change of temperature, but it could not be long
delayed.</p>

<p>In the midst of his pleasant anticipations, Harvey was startled
by a shriek from Bohunkus:</p>

<p>"We’s gone, Harv!" he shouted; "nuffin can sabe us!" </p>
