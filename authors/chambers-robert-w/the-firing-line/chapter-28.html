<p>Late in the autumn his aunt wrote Hamil from Sapphire Springs:</p>

<p>   "There seems to be a favourable change in Shiela. Her aversion
to    people is certainly modified. Yesterday on my way to the
hot    springs I met her with her trained nurse, Miss Lester,
face to    face, and of course meant to pass on as usual, apparently
without    seeing her; but to my surprise she turned and spoke
my name very    quietly; and I said, as though we had parted the
day before&mdash;'I    hope you are better'; and she said, 'I think
I am'&mdash;very slowly    and precisely like a person who strives
to speak correctly in a    foreign tongue. Garry, dear, it was
too pathetic; she is so    changed&mdash;beautiful, even more beautiful
than before; but the last    childish softness has fled from the
delicate and almost undecided    features you remember, and her
face has settled into a nobler    mould. Do you recollect in the
Munich Museum an antique marble,    by some unknown Greek sculptor,
called 'Head of a Young Amazon'?    You must recall it because
you have spoken to me of its noble and    almost immortal loveliness.
Dear, it resembles Shiela as she is    now&mdash;with that mysterious
and almost imperceptible hint of sorrow    in the tenderly youthful
dignity of the features.</p>

<p>   "We exchanged only the words I have written you; she passed
her    way leaning on Miss Lester's arm; I went for a mud bath
as a    precaution to our inherited enemy. If rheumatism gets
me at last    it will not be the fault of your aged and timorous
aunt.</p>

<p>   "So that was all, yesterday. But to-day as I was standing
on the    leafy path above the bath-houses, listening to the chattering
of    some excited birds recently arrived from the North in the
first    batch of migrants, Miss Lester came up to me and said
that Shiela    would like to see me, and that the doctors said
there was no harm    in her talking to anybody if she desired
to do so.</p>

<p>   "So I took my book to a rustic seat under the trees, and   
presently our little Shiela came by, leaning on Miss Lester's   
arm; and Miss Lester walked on, leaving her seated beside me.</p>

<p>   "For quite five minutes she neither spoke nor even looked
at me,    and I was very careful to leave the quiet unbroken.</p>

<p>   "The noise of the birds&mdash;they were not singing, only chattering   
to each other about their trip&mdash;seemed to attract her notice,
and    she laid her hand on mine to direct my attention. Her hand   
remained there&mdash;she has the same soft little hands, as dazzlingly   
white as ever, only thinner.</p>

<p>   "She said, not looking at me: 'I have been ill. You understand   
that.'</p>

<p>   "'Yes,' I said, 'but it is all over now, isn't it?'</p>

<p>   "She nodded listlessly: 'I think so.'</p>

<p>   "Again, but not looking at me she spoke of her illness as
dating    from a shock received long ago. She is a little confused
about    the lapse of time, vague as to dates. You see it is four
months    since Louis&mdash;did what he did. She said nothing more,
and in a few    minutes Miss Lester came back for her.</p>

<p>   "Now as to her mental condition: I have had a thorough   
understanding with the physicians and one and all assure me that   
there is absolutely nothing the matter with her except the   
physical consequences of the shock; and those are wearing off.</p>

<p>   "What she did, what she lived through with him&mdash;the dreadful   
tension, the endless insomnia&mdash;all this&mdash;and then, when the   
searching party was out all night long in the rain and all the   
next day&mdash;and <em>then</em>, Garry, to have her stumble on him
at    dusk&mdash;that young girl, all alone, nerves strung to the breaking   
point&mdash;and to find him, <em>that</em> way! Was it not enough to
account    for this nervous demoralisation? The wonder is that
it has not    permanently injured her.</p>

<p>   "But it has not; she is certainly recovering. The dread of
seeing    a familiar face is less poignant; her father was here
to-day with    Gray and she saw them both.</p>

<p>   "Now, dear, as for your coming here, it will not do. I can
see    that. She has not yet spoken of you, nor have I ventured
to. What    her attitude toward you may be I cannot guess from
her speech or    manner.</p>

<p>   "Miss Lester told me that at first, in the complete nervous   
prostration, she seemed to have a morbid idea that you had been   
unkind to her, neglected and deserted her&mdash;left her to face some   
endless horror all alone. The shock to her mind had been    terrible,
Garry; everything was grotesquely twisted&mdash;she had some    fever,
you know&mdash;and Miss Lester told me that it was too pitiful    to
hear her talk of you and mix up everything with military    jargon
about outpost duty and the firing line, and some comrade    who
had deserted her under fire.</p>

<p>   "All of which I mention, dear, so that you may, in a measure,   
comprehend how very ill she has been; and that she is not yet   
well by any means, and perhaps will not be for a long time to   
come.</p>

<p>   "To-night I had a very straight talk with Mr. Cardross. One
has    to talk straight when one talks to him. There is not in
my mind    the slightest doubt that he knows exactly now what
misguided    impulse drove Shiela to that distressing sacrifice
of herself and    you. And at first I was afraid that what she
had done from a    mistaken sense of duty might have hastened
poor Louis' end; but    Mr. Cardross told me that from the day
of his father's death he    had determined to follow in the same
fashion; and had told Mr.    Cardross of his intention more than
once.</p>

<p>   "So you see it was in him&mdash;in the blood. See what his own
sister    did to herself within a month of Louis' death!</p>

<p>   "A strange family; an utterly incomprehensible race. And Mr.   
Cardross says that it happened to his father's father; and <em>his</em>   
father before him died by his own hand!</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>   "Now there is little more news to write you&mdash;little more that   
could interest you because you care only to hear about Shiela,   
and that is perfectly reasonable."</p>

<p>   "However, what there is of news I will write you as faithfully
as    I have done ever since I came here on your service under
pretence    of fighting gout which, Heaven be praised, has never
yet waylaid    me!&mdash;<em>unberufen</em>!"</p>

<p>   "So, to continue: the faithful three, Messieurs Classon, Cuyp,   
and Vetchen, do valiantly escort me on my mountain rides and   
drives. They are dears, all three, Garry, and it does not become   
you to shrug your shoulders. When I go to Palm Beach in January   
they, as usual, are going too. I don't know what I should do   
without them, Virginia having decided to remain in Europe this   
winter.</p>

<p>   "Yes, to answer your question, Mr. Wayward expects to cruise
as    far South as Palm Beach in January. I happen to have a note
from    him here on my desk in which he asks me whether he may
invite you    to go with him. Isn't it a tactful way of finding
out whether you    would care to be at Palm Beach this winter?</p>

<p>   "So I shall write him that I think you would like to be asked.   
Because, Garry, I do believe that it is all turning out    naturally,
inevitably, as it was meant to turn out from the    first, and
that, some time this winter, there can be no reason    why you
should not see Shiela again.</p>

<p>   "I know this, that Mr. Cardross is very fond of you&mdash;that
Mrs.    Cardross is also&mdash;that every member of that most wholesome
family    cares a great deal about you.</p>

<p>   "As for their not being very fashionable people, their amiable   
freedom from social pretension, their very simple origin&mdash;all   
that, in their case, affects me not at all&mdash;where any happiness   
of yours is concerned.</p>

<p>   "I <em>do</em> like old-time folk, and lineage smacking of
New    Amsterdam; but even my harmless snobbishness is now so
completely    out of fashion that nobody cares. You are modern
enough to laugh    at it; I am not; and I still continue faithful
to my Classons and    Cuyps and Vetchens and Suydams; and to all
that they stand for in    Manhattan&mdash;the rusty vestiges of by-gone
pomp and fussy    circumstance&mdash;the memories that cling to the
early lords of the    manors, the old Patroons, and titled refugees&mdash;all
this I still    cling to&mdash;even to their shabbiness and stupidity
and bad manners.</p>

<p>   "Don't be too bitter in your amusement, for after all, you
are    kin to us; don't be too severe on us; for we are passing,
Garry,    the descendants of Patroon and refugee alike&mdash;the Cuyps,
the    Classons, the Van Diemans, the Vetchens, the Suydams&mdash;and
James    Wayward is the last of his race, and I am the last of
the French    refugees, and the Malcourts are already ended. Pax!</p>

<p>   "True it begins to look as if the gentleman adventurer stock   
which terminates in the Ascotts and Portlaws might be revived
to    struggle on for another generation; but, Garry, we all,
who    intermarry, are doomed.</p>

<p>   "Louis Malcourt was right; we are destined to perish; Still
we    have left our marks on the nation I care for no other epitaph   
than the names of counties, cities, streets which we have named   
with our names.</p>

<p>   "But you, dear, you are wise in your generation and fortunate
to    love as you love. For, God willing, your race will begin
the    welding of the old and new, the youngest and best of the
nation.    And at the feet of such a race the whole world lies."</p>

<p>These letters from Constance Palliser to her nephew continued
during the autumn and early winter while he was at work on that
series of public parks provided for by the metropolis on Long
Island.</p>

<p>Once he was obliged to return to Pride's Hall to inspect the
progress of work for Mrs. Ascott; and it happened during his brief
stay there that her engagement was announced.</p>

<p>"I tell you what, Hamil," said Portlaw confidentailly over their
cigars, "I never thought I could win her, never in the world.
Besides poor Louis was opposed to it; but you know when I make
up my mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," said Hamil.</p>

<p>"That's it! First, a man must have a mind to make up; then he
must have enough intelligence to make it up."</p>

<p>"Certainly," nodded Hamil.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you understand me," said Portlaw, gratified. "Alida
understands me; why, do you know that, somehow, everything I think
of she seems to agree to; in fact, sometimes&mdash;on one or two unimportant
matters, I actually believe that Mrs. Ascott thought of what I
thought of, a few seconds before I thought of it," he ended generously;
"but," and his expression became slyly portentous, "it would never
do to have her suspect it. I intend to be Caesar in my own house!"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Hamil solemnly; "and Caesar's wife must have
no suspicions."</p>

</div>
<p>It was early November before he returned to town. His new suite
of offices in Broad Street hummed with activity, although the
lingering aftermath of the business depression prevented for the
time being any hope of new commissions from private sources.</p>

<p>But fortunately he had enough public work to keep the office
busy, and his dogged personal supervision of it during the racking
suspense of Shiela's illness was his salvation.</p>

<p>Twice a week his aunt wrote him from Sapphire Springs; every
day he went to his outdoor work on Long Island and forced himself
to a minute personal supervision of every detail, never allowing
himself a moment's brooding, never permitting himself to become
panic-stricken at the outlook which varied from one letter to
another. For as yet, according to these same letters, the woman
he loved had never once mentioned his name.</p>

<p>He found little leisure for amusement, even had he been inclined
that way. Night found him very tired; morning brought a hundred
self-imposed and complicated tasks to be accomplished before the
advent of another night.</p>

<p>He lived at his club and wrote to his aunt from there. Sundays
were more difficult to negotiate; he went to St. George's in the
morning, read in the club library until afternoon permitted him
to maintain some semblance of those social duties which no man
has a right to entirely neglect.</p>

<p>Now and then he dined out; once he went to the opera with the
O'Haras; but it nearly did for him, for they sang "Madame Butterfly,"
and Farrar's matchless voice and acting tore him to shreds. Only
the happy can endure such tragedy.</p>

<p>And one Sunday, having pondered long that afternoon over the
last letter Malcourt had ever written him, he put on hat and overcoat
and went to Greenlawn Cemetery&mdash;a tedious journey through strange
avenues and unknown suburbs, under a wet sky from which occasionally
a flake or two of snow fell through the fine-spun drizzle.</p>

<p>In the cemetery the oaks still bore leaves which were growing
while Malcourt was alive; here and there a beech-tree remained
in full autumn foliage and the grass on the graves was intensely
green; but the few flowers that lifted their stalks were discoloured
and shabby; bare branches interlaced overhead; dead leaves, wet
and flattened, stuck to slab and headstone or left their stained
imprints on the tarnished marble.</p>

<p>He had bought some flowers&mdash;violets and lilies&mdash;at a florist's
near the cemetery gates. These he laid, awkwardly, at the base
of the white slab from which Malcourt's newly cut name stared
at him.</p>

<p>Louis Malcourt lay, as he had wished, next to his father. Also,
as he had desired, a freshly planted tree, bereft now of foliage,
rose, spindling, to balance an older one on the other corner of
the plot. His sister's recently shaped grave lay just beyond.
As yet, Bertie had provided no headstone for the late Lady Tressilvain.</p>

<p>Hamil stood inspecting Malcourt's name, finding it impossible
to realise that he was dead&mdash;or for that matter, unable to comprehend
death at all. The newly chiselled letters seemed vaguely instinct
with something of Malcourt's own clean-cut irony; they appeared
to challenge him with their mocking legend of death, daring him,
with sly malice, to credit the inscription.</p>

<p>To look at them became almost an effort, so white and clear they
stared back at him&mdash;as though the pallid face of the dead himself,
set for ever in raillery, was on the watch to detect false sentiment
and delight in it. And Hamil's eyes fell uneasily upon the flowers,
then lifted. And he said aloud, unconsciously:</p>

<p>"You are right; it's too late, Malcourt."</p>

<p>There was a shabby, neglected grave in the adjoining plot; he
bent over, gathered up his flowers, and laid them on the slab
of somebody aged ninety-three whose name was blotted out by wet
dead leaves. Then he slowly returned to face Malcourt, and stood
musing, gloved hands deep in his overcoat pockets.</p>

<p>"If I could have understood you&mdash;" he began, under his breath,
then fell silent. A few moments later he uncovered.</p>

<p>It was snowing heavily when he turned to leave; and he stood
back and aside, hat in hand, to permit a young woman to pass the
iron gateway&mdash;a slim figure in black, heavy veil drawn, arms piled
high with lilies. He knew her at once and she knew him.</p>

<p>"I think you are Mr. Hamil," she said timidly.</p>

<p>"You are Miss Wilming?" he said in his naturally pleasant voice,
which brought old memories crowding upon her and a pale flush
to her cheeks.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence; she dropped some flowers and he
recovered them for her. Then she knelt down in the sleet, unconscious
of it, and laid the flowers on the mound, arranging them with
great care, while the thickening snow pelted her and began to
veil the white blossoms on the grave.</p>

<p>Hamil hesitated after the girl had risen, and, presently, as
she did not stir, he quietly asked if he might be of any use to
her.</p>

<p>At first she made no reply, and her gaze remained remote; then,
turning:</p>

<p>"Was he your friend?" she asked wistfully.</p>

<p>"I think he meant to be."</p>

<p>"You quarrelled&mdash;down there&mdash;in the South"&mdash;she made a vague
gesture toward the gray horizon. "Do you remember that night,
Mr. Hamil?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you ever become friends again?"</p>

<p>"No.... I think he meant to be.... The fault was probably mine.
I misunderstood."</p>

<p>She said: "I know he cared a great deal for you."</p>

<p>The man was silent.</p>

<p>She turned directly toward him, pale, clear-eyed, and in the
poise of her head a faint touch of pride.</p>

<p>"Please do not misunderstand his friendship for me, then. If
you were his friend I would not need to say this. He was very
kind to me, Mr. Hamil."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt it," said Hamil gravely.</p>

<p>"And you do not mistake, what I say?"</p>

<p>He looked her in the eyes, curious&mdash;and, in a moment, convinced.</p>

<p>"No," he said gently.... And, offering his hand: "Men are very
ignorant concerning one another. Women are wiser, I think."</p>

<p>He took the slender black-gloved hand in his.</p>

<p>"Can I be of the least use to you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You have been," she sighed, "if what I said has taught you to
know him a little better."</p>

<p>A week later when the curtain fell on the second act of the new
musical comedy, "The Inca," critics preparing to leave questioned
each other with considerable curiosity concerning this newcomer,
Dorothy Wilming, who had sung so intelligently and made so much
out of a subordinate part.</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to know very much about her; several nice-looking
young girls and exceedingly respectable young men sent her flowers.
Afterward they gathered at the stage entrance, evidently expecting
to meet and congratulate her; but she had slipped away. And while
they hunted high and low, and the last figurante had trotted off
under the lamp-lights, Dolly lay in her own dark room, face among
the pillows, sobbing her heart out for a dead man who had been
kind to her for nothing.</p>

<p>And, at the same hour, across an ocean, another woman awoke to
take up the ravelled threadings of her life again and, through
another day, remember Louis Malcourt and all that he had left
undone for kindness' sake.</p>

<p>There were others, too, who were not likely to forget him, particularly
those who had received, with some astonishment, a legacy apiece
of one small Chinese gilded idol&mdash;images all of the <em>Pa-hsien</em>
or of <em>Kwan-Yin</em>, who rescues souls from hell with the
mystic lotus-prayer, "<em>Om mane padme hum</em>."</p>

<p>But the true Catholicism, which perplexed the eighteen legatees
lay in the paradox of the Mohammedan inscriptions across each
lotus written in Malcourt's hand:</p>

<p>"I direct my face unto Him who hath created.</p>

<p>"Who maketh His messengers with two and three and four pairs
of wings.</p>

<p>"And thou shall see them going in procession.</p>

<p>"This is what ye are promised: 'For the last hour will surely
come; there is no doubt thereof; but the greater part of men believe
it not.'</p>

<p>"Thus, facing the stars, I go out among them into darkness.</p>

<p>"Say not for me the Sobhat with the ninety-nine; for the hundredth
pearl is the <em>Iman</em>&mdash;pearl beyond praise, pearl of the
five-score names in one, more precious than mercy, more priceless
than compassion &mdash;Iman! Iman! thy splendid name is Death!"</p>

<p>So lingered the living memory of Malcourt among men&mdash;a little
while&mdash;longer among women&mdash;then faded as shadows die at dusk when
the <em>mala</em> is told for the soul that waits the Rosary of
a Thousand Beads.</p>

<p>In January the <em>Ariani</em> sailed with her owner aboard;
but Hamil was not with him.</p>

<p>In February Constance Palliser wrote Hamil from Palm Beach:</p>

<p>   "It is too beautiful here and you must come.</p>

<p>   "As for Shiela, I do not even pretend to understand her. I
see    her every day; to-day I lunched with Mrs. Cardross, and
Shiela    was there, apparently perfectly well and entirely her
former    lovely self. Yet she has never yet spoken of you to
me; and, I    learn from Mrs. Cardross, never to anybody as far
as she knows.</p>

<p>   "She seems to be in splendid health; I have seen her swimming,   
galloping, playing tennis madly. The usual swarm of devoted youth   
and smitten middle-age is in attendance. She wears neither black   
nor colours; only white; nor does she go to any sort of    functions.
At times, to me, she resembles a scarcely grown girl    just freed
from school and playing hard every minute with every    atom of
heart and soul in her play.</p>

<p>   "Gray has an apology for a polo field and a string of ponies,
and    Shiela plays with the men&mdash;a crazy, reckless, headlong
game, in    which every minute my heart is in my mouth for fear
somebody will    cannon into her, or some dreadful swing of a
mallet will injure    her for life.</p>

<p>   "But everybody is so sweet to her&mdash;and it is delightful to
see    her with her own family&mdash;their pride and tenderness for
her, and    her devotion to them.</p>

<p>   "Mrs. Cardross asked me to-day what I thought might be the
effect    on Shiela if you came. And, dear, I could not answer.
Mr.    Cardross joined us, divining the subject of our furtive
confab in    the <em>patio</em>, and he seemed to think that you
ought to come.</p>

<p>   "There is no reason to hesitate in saying that the family
would    be very glad to count you as one of them. Even a little
snob like    myself can see that there is, in this desire of theirs,
no motive    except affection for you and for Shiela; and, in
a way, it's    rather humiliating to recognise that they don't
care a fig for    the social advantage that must, automatically,
accrue to the    House of Cardross through such connections.</p>

<p>   "I never thought that I should so earnestly hope for such
an    alliance for you; but I do, Garry. They are such simple
folk with    all their riches&mdash;simple as gentle folk&mdash;kind, sincere,
utterly    without self-consciousness, untainted by the sordid
social    ambitions which make so many of the wealthy abhorrent.
There is    no pretence about them, nothing of that uncertainty
of self    mingled with vanity which grows into arrogance or servility
as    the social weather-vane veers with the breeze of fashion.
Rather    flowery that, for an old-fashioned spinster.</p>

<p>   "But, dear, there are other flowers than those of speech eloquent   
in the soft Southern air&mdash;flowers everywhere outside my open   
window where I sit writing you.</p>

<p>   "I miss Virginia, but Shiela compensates when she can find
time    from her breathless pleasure chase to give me an hour
or two at    tea-time.</p>

<p>   "And Cecile, too, is very charming, and I know she likes me.
Such    a coquette! She has her own court among the younger set;
and from    her very severe treatment of young Gatewood on all
occasions I    fancy she may be kinder to him one day.</p>

<p>   "Mrs. Carrick is not here this winter, her new baby keeping
her    in town; and Acton, of course, is only too happy to remain
with    her.</p>

<p>   "As for Gray, he is a nice boy&mdash;a little slow, a trifle shy
and    retiring and over-studious; but his devotion to Shiela
makes me    love him. And he, too, ventured to ask me whether
you were not    coming down this winter to hunt along the Everglades
with him and    Little Tiger.</p>

<p>   "So, dear, I think perhaps you had better come. It really   
frightens me to give you this advice. I could not endure it if   
anything went wrong&mdash;if your coming proved premature.</p>

<p>   "For it is true, Garry, that I love our little Shiela with
all my    aged, priggish, and prejudiced heart, and I should simply
expire    if your happiness, which is bound up in her, were threatened
by    any meddling of mine.</p>

<p>   "Jim Wayward and I discuss the matter every day; I don't know   
what he thinks&mdash;he's so obstinate some days&mdash;and sometimes he
is    irritable when Gussie Vetchen and Cuyp talk <em>too</em>
inanely&mdash;bless    their hearts! I really don't know what I shall
do with James    Wayward. What would you suggest?"</p>

<p>On the heels of this letter went another.</p>

<p>   "Garry, dear, read this and then make up your mind whether
to    come here or not.</p>

<p>   "This morning I was sitting on the Cardrosses' terrace knitting
a    red four-in-hand for Mr. Wayward&mdash;he is <em>too</em> snuffy
in his    browns and grays!&mdash;and Mrs. Cardross was knitting one
for    Neville, and Cecile was knitting one for Heaven knows who,
and    Shiela, swinging her polo-mallet, sat waiting for her pony&mdash;the   
cunning little thing in her boots and breeches!    &mdash;I mean
the girl,    not the pony, dear    &mdash;Oh, my, I'm getting
involved and you're    hurrying through this scrawl perfectly
furious, trying to find    out what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>   "Well, then; I forgot for a moment that Shiela was there within   
ear-shot; and eyes on my knitting, I began talking about you to   
Mrs. Cardross; and I had been gossiping away quite innocently
for    almost a minute when I chanced to look up and notice the
peculiar    expressions of Mrs. Cardross and Cecile. They weren't
looking at    me; they were watching Shiela, who had slipped down
from the    parapet where she had been perched and now stood beside
my chair    listening.</p>

<p>   "I hesitated, faltered, but did not make the mistake of stopping   
or changing the subject, but went on gaily telling about your   
work on the new Long Island park system.</p>

<p>   "And as long as I talked she remained motionless beside me.
They    brought around her pony&mdash;a new one&mdash;but she did not stir.</p>

<p>   "Her mother and sister continued their knitting, asking questions   
about you now and then, apparently taking no notice of her. My   
monologue in praise of you became a triangular discussion; and   
all the while the pony was cutting up the marl drive with    impatience,
and Shiela never stirred.</p>

<p>   "Then Cecile said to me quite naturally: 'I wish Garry were   
here.' And, looking up at Shiela, she added: 'Don't you?'</p>

<p>   "For a second or two there was absolute silence; and then
Shiela    said to me:</p>

<p>   "'Does he know I have been ill?'</p>

<p>   "'Of course,' I said, 'and he knows that you are now perfectly   
well.'</p>

<p>   "She turned slowly to her mother: 'Am I?' she asked.</p>

<p>   "'What, dear?'</p>

<p>   "'Perfectly well.'</p>

<p>   "'Certainly,' replied her mother, laughing; 'well enough to
break    your neck on that horrid, jigging, little pony. If Garry
wants to    see you alive he'd better come pretty soon&mdash;'</p>

<p>   "'Come <em>here?</em>'</p>

<p>   "We all looked up at her. Oh, Garry! For a moment something
came    into her eyes that I never want to see there again&mdash;and,
please    God, never shall!&mdash;a momentary light like a pale afterglow
of    terror.</p>

<p>   "It went as it came; and the colour returned to her face.</p>

<p>   "'Is he coming here?' she asked calmly.</p>

<p>   "'Yes,' I made bold to say.</p>

<p>   "'When?'</p>

<p>   "'In a few days, I hope.'</p>

<p>   "She said nothing more about you, nor did I. A moment later
she    sent away her pony and went indoors.</p>

<p>   "After luncheon I found her lying in the hammock in the <em>patio</em>,   
eyes closed as though asleep. She lay there all the afternoon&mdash;an   
unusual thing for her.</p>

<p>   "Toward sundown, as I was entering my chair to go back to
the    hotel, she came out and stood beside the chair looking
at me as    though she was trying to say something. I don't know
what it    might have been, for she never said it, but she bent
down and    laid her cheek against mine for a moment, and drew
my head    around, searching my eyes.</p>

<p>   "I don't know whether I was right or wrong, but I said: 'There
is    no one to compare with you, Shiela, in your new incarnation
of    health and youth. I never before knew you; I don't think
you ever    before knew yourself.'</p>

<p>   "'Not entirely,' she said.</p>

<p>   "'Do you now?'</p>

<p>   "'I think so.... May I ask you something?'</p>

<p>   "I nodded, smiling.</p>

<p>   "'Then&mdash;there is only one thing I care for now&mdash;to'&mdash;she looked   
up toward the house&mdash;'to make them contented&mdash;to make up to them   
what I can for&mdash;for all that I failed in. Do you understand?'</p>

<p>   "'Yes,' I said, 'you sweet thing.' And gave her a little hug,   
adding: 'And that's why I'm going to write a letter to-night&mdash;at   
your mother's desire&mdash;and my own.'</p>

<p>   "She said nothing more; my chair rolled away; and here's the   
letter that I told her I meant to write.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"'Now, dear, come if you think best. I don't know of any<br/>
reason why you should not come; if you know of any you must<br/>
act on your own responsibility.'

</p>
</div>
<p>   "Last winter, believing that she cared for you, I did an   
extraordinary thing&mdash;in fact I intimated to her that it was   
agreeable for me to believe you cared for each other. And she   
told me very sweetly that I was in error.</p>

<p>   "So I'm not going to place Constance Palliser in such a position   
again. If there's any chance of her caring for you you ought to   
know it and act accordingly. Personally I think there is and that   
you should take that chance and take it now. But for goodness'   
sake don't act on my advice. I'm a perfect fool to meddle this   
way; besides I'm having troubles of my own which you know nothing   
about.</p>

<p>   "O Garry, dear, if you'll come down I may perhaps have something   
very, very foolish to tell you.</p>

<p>   "Truly there is no idiot like an old one, but    &mdash;I'm
close, I    think, to being happier than I ever was in all my
life. God help    us both, my dear, dear boy.</p>
