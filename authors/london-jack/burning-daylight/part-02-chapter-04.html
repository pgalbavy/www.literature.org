Back in San Francisco, Daylight quickly added to his reputation
In ways it was not an enviable reputation.  Men were afraid of
him.  He became known as a fighter, a fiend, a tiger.  His play
was a ripping and smashing one, and no one knew where or how his
next blow would fall.  The element of surprise was large.  He
balked on the unexpected, and, fresh from the wild North, his
mind not operating in stereotyped channels, he was able in
unusual degree to devise new tricks and stratagems.  And once he
won the advantage, he pressed it remorselessly.  "As relentless
as a Red Indian," was said of him, and it was said truly.
<P>
On the other hand, he was known as "square."  His word was as
good as his bond, and this despite the fact that he accepted
nobody's word.  He always shied at propositions based on
gentlemen's agreements, and a man who ventured his honor as a
gentleman, in dealing with Daylight, inevitably was treated to an
unpleasant time.  Daylight never gave his own word unless he held
the whip-hand.  It was a case with the other fellow taking it or
nothing.
<P>
Legitimate investment had no place in Daylight's play.  It tied
up his money, and reduced the element of risk.  It was the
gambling side of business that fascinated him, and to play in his
slashing manner required that his money must be ready to hand. 
It was never tied up save for short intervals, for he was
principally engaged in turning it over and over, raiding here,
there, and everywhere, a veritable pirate of the financial main. 
A five-per cent safe investment had no attraction for him; but to
risk millions in sharp, harsh skirmish, standing to lose
everything or to win fifty or a hundred per cent, was the savor
of life to him.  He played according to the rules of the game,
but
he played mercilessly.  When he got a man or a corporation down
and
they squealed, he gouged no less hard.  Appeals for financial
mercy
fell on deaf ears.  He was a free lance, and had no friendly
business associations.  Such alliances as were formed
from time to time were purely affairs of expediency, and he
regarded his allies as men who would give him the double-cross or
ruin him if a profitable chance presented.  In spite of this
point of view, he was faithful to his allies.  But he was
faithful just as long as they were and no longer.  The treason
had to come from them, and then it was 'Ware Daylight.
<P>
The business men and financiers of the Pacific coast never forgot
the lesson of Charles Klinkner and the California & Altamont
Trust Company.  Klinkner was the president.  In partnership with
Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.  The powerful
Lake Power & Electric Lighting corporation came to the rescue,
and Klinkner, seeing what he thought was the opportunity, went
over to the enemy in the thick of the pitched battle.  Daylight
lost three millions before he was done with it, and before he was
done with it he saw the California & Altamont Trust Company
hopelessly wrecked, and Charles Klinkner a suicide in a felon's
cell.  Not only did Daylight lose his grip on San Jose
Interurban, but in the crash of his battle front he lost heavily
all along the line.  It was conceded by those competent to judge
that he could have compromised and saved much.  But, instead, he
deliberately threw up the battle with San Jose Interurban and
Lake Power, and, apparently defeated, with Napoleonic suddenness
struck at Klinkner.  It was the last unexpected thing Klinkner
would have dreamed of, and Daylight knew it.  He knew, further,
that the California & Altamont Trust Company has an intrinsically
sound institution, but that just then it was in a precarious
condition due to Klinkner's speculations with its money.  He
knew, also, that in a few months the Trust Company would be more
firmly on its feet than ever, thanks to those same speculations,
and that if he were to strike he must strike immediately.  "It's
just that much money in pocket and a whole lot more," he was
reported to have said in connection with his heavy losses.  "It's
just so much insurance against the future.  Henceforth, men who
go in with me on deals will think twice before they try to
double-cross me, and then some."
<P>
The reason for his savageness was that he despised the men with
whom he played.  He had a conviction that not one in a hundred of
them was intrinsically square; and as for the square ones, he
prophesied that, playing in a crooked game, they were sure to
lose and in the long run go broke.  His New York experience had
opened his eyes.  He tore the veils of illusion from the business
game, and saw its nakedness.  He generalized upon industry and
society somewhat as follows:--
<P>
Society, as organized, was a vast bunco game.  There were many
hereditary inefficients--men and women who were not weak enough
to
be confined in feeble-minded homes, but who were not strong
enough to be ought else than hewers of wood and drawers of water.
<P>
Then there were the fools who took the organized bunco game
seriously, honoring and respecting it.  They were easy game for
the others, who saw clearly and knew the bunco game for what it
was.
<P>
Work, legitimate work, was the source of all wealth.  That was to
say, whether it was a sack of potatoes, a grand piano, or a
seven-passenger touring car, it came into being only by the
performance of work.  Where the bunco came in was in the
distribution of these things after labor had created them.  He
failed to see the horny-handed sons of toil enjoying grand pianos
or riding in automobiles.  How this came about was explained by
the bunco.  By tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands men
sat up nights and schemed how they could get between the workers
and the things the workers produced.  These schemers were the
business men.  When they got between the worker and his product,
they took a whack out of it for themselves The size of the whack
was determined by no rule of equity; but by their own strength
and swinishness.  It was always a case of "all the traffic can
bear."  He saw all men in the business game doing this.
<P>
One day, in a mellow mood (induced by a string of cocktails and
a hearty lunch), he started a conversation with Jones, the
elevator boy.  Jones was a slender, mop-headed, man-grown,
truculent flame of an individual who seemed to go out of his way
to insult his passengers.  It was this that attracted Daylight's
interest, and he was not long in finding out what was the matter
with Jones.  He was a proletarian, according to his own
aggressive classification, and he had wanted to write for a
living.  Failing to win with the magazines, and compelled to find
himself in food and shelter, he had gone to the little valley of
Petacha, not a hundred miles from Los Angeles.  Here, toiling in
the day-time, he planned to write and study at night.  But the
railroad charged all the traffic would bear.  Petacha was a
desert valley, and produced only three things: cattle, fire-wood,
and charcoal.  For freight to Los Angeles on a carload of
cattle the railroad charged eight dollars.  This, Jones
explained, was due to the fact that the cattle had legs and could
be driven to Los Angeles at a cost equivalent to the charge per
car load.  But firewood had no legs, and the railroad charged
just precisely twenty-four dollars a carload.
<P>
This was a fine adjustment, for by working hammer-and- tongs
through a twelve-hour day, after freight had been deducted from
the selling price of the wood in Los Angeles, the wood-chopper
received one dollar and sixty cents.  Jones had thought to get
ahead of the game by turning his wood into charcoa.  His
estimates
were satisfactory.  But the railroad also made estimates.  It
issued a rate of forty-two dollars a car on charcoal.  At the end
of three months, Jones went over his figures, and found that he
was
still making one dollar and sixty cents a day.
<P>
"So I quit," Jones concluded.  "I went hobbling for a year, and I
got back at the railroads.  Leaving out the little things, I came
across the Sierras in the summer and touched a match to the
snow-sheds.  They only had a little thirty- thousand-dollar fire.
<P>
I guess that squared up all balances due on Petacha."    
<P>
"Son, ain't you afraid to be turning loose such information?" 
Daylight gravely demanded.
<P>
"Not on your life," quoth Jones.  "They can't prove it.  You
could say I said so, and I could say I didn't say so, and a hell
of a lot that evidence would amount to with a jury."
<P>
Daylight went into his office and meditated awhile.  That was it:
<P>
all the traffic would bear.  From top to bottom, that was the
rule of the game; and what kept the game going was the fact that
a sucker was born every minute.  If a Jones were born every
minute, the game wouldn't last very long.  Lucky for the players
that the workers weren't Joneses.
<P>
But there were other and larger phases of the game.  Little
business men, shopkeepers, and such ilk took what whack they
could out of the product of the worker; but, after all, it was
the large business men who formed the workers through the little
business men.  When all was said and done, the latter, like Jones
in Petacha Valley, got no more than wages out of their whack.  In
truth, they were hired men for the large business men.  Still
again, higher up, were the big fellows.  They used vast and
complicated paraphernalia for the purpose, on a large scale of
getting between hundreds of thousands of workers and their
products.  These men were not so much mere robbers as gamblers. 
And, not content with their direct winnings, being essentially
gamblers, they raided one another.  They called this feature of
the game HIGH FINANCE.  They were all engaged primarily in
robbing the worker, but every little while they formed
combinations and robbed one another of the accumulated loot. 
This explained the fifty-thousand-dollar raid on him by
Holdsworthy and the ten-million-dollar raid on him by Dowsett,
Letton, and Guggenhammer.  And when he raided Panama Mail he had
done exactly the same thing.  Well, he concluded, it was finer
sport robbing the robbers than robbing the poor stupid workers.
<P>
Thus, all unread in philosophy, Daylight preempted for himself
the position and vocation of a twentieth-century superman.  He
found, with rare and mythical exceptions, that there was no
noblesse oblige among the business and financial supermen.  As
a clever traveler had announced in an after-dinner speech at the
Alta-Pacific, "There was honor amongst thieves, and this was what
distinguished thieves from honest men."  That was it.  It hit
the nail on the head.  These modern supermen were a lot of sordid
banditti who had the successful effrontery to preach a code of
right and wrong to their victims which they themselves did not
practise.  With them, a man's word was good just as long as he
was compelled to keep it.  THOU SHALT NOT STEAL was only
applicable to the honest worker.  They, the supermen, were above
such commandments.  They certainly stole and were honored by
their fellows according to the magnitude of their stealings.
<P>
The more Daylight played the game, the clearer the situation
grew.  Despite the fact that every robber was keen to rob every
other robber, the band was well organized.  It practically
controlled the political machinery of society, from the ward
politician up to the Senate of the United States.  It passed laws
that gave it privilege to rob.  It enforced these laws by means
of the police, the marshals, the militia and regular army, and
the courts.  And it was a snap.  A superman's chiefest danger was
his fellow-superman.  The great stupid mass of the people did not
count.  They were constituted of such inferior clay that the
veriest chicanery fooled them.  The superman manipulated the
strings, and when robbery of the workers became too slow or
monotonous, they turned loose and robbed one another.
<P>
Daylight was philosophical, but not a philosopher.  He had never
read the books.  He was a hard-headed, practical man, and
farthest from him was any intention of ever reading the books. 
He had lived life in the simple, where books were not necessary
for an understanding of life, and now life in the complex
appeared just as simple.  He saw through its frauds and fictions,
and found it as elemental as on the Yukon.  Men were made of the
same stuff.  They had the same passions and desires.  Finance was
poker on a larger scale.  The men who played were the men who had
stakes.  The workers were the fellows toiling for grubstakes.  He
saw the game played out according to the everlasting rules, and
he played a hand himself.  The gigantic futility of humanity
organized and befuddled by the bandits did not shock him.  It was
the natural order.  Practically all human endeavors were futile. 
He had seen so much of it.  His partners had starved and died on
the Stewart.  Hundreds of old-timers had failed to locate on
Bonanza and Eldorado, while Swedes and chechaquos had come in
on the moose-pasture and blindly staked millions.  It was life,
and life was a savage proposition at best.  Men in civilization
robbed because they were so made.  They robbed just as cats
scratched, famine pinched, and frost bit.
<P>
So it was that Daylight became a successful financier.  He did
not
go in for swindling the workers.  Not only did he not have the
heart for it, but it did not strike him as a sporting
proposition.  The workers were so easy, so stupid. It was more
like slaughtering fat hand-reared pheasants on the English
preserves he had heard about.  The sport to him, was in waylaying
the successful robbers and taking their spoils from them.  There
was fun and excitement in that, and sometimes they put up the
very devil of a fight. Like Robin Hood of old, Daylight proceeded
to rob the rich; and, in a small way, to distribute to the needy.
<P>
But he was charitable after his own fashion.  The great mass of
human misery meant nothing to him.  That was part of the
everlasting order.  He had no patience with the organized
charities and the professional charity mongers.  Nor, on the
other hand, was what he gave a conscience dole.  He owed no man,
and restitution was unthinkable.  What he gave was a largess, a
free, spontaneous gift; and it was for those about him.  He never
contributed to an earthquake fund in Japan nor to an open-air
fund in New York City.  Instead, he financed Jones, the elevator
boy, for a year that he might write a book.  When he learned that
the wife of his waiter at the St. Francis was suffering from
tuberculosis, he sent her to Arizona, and later, when her case
was declared hopeless, he sent the husband, too, to be with her
to the end.  Likewise, he bought a string of horse-hair bridles
from a convict in a Western penitentiary, who spread the good
news until it seemed to Daylight that half the convicts in that
institution were making bridles for him.  He bought them all,
paying from twenty to fifty dollars each for them.  They were
beautiful and honest things, and he decorated all the available
wall-space of his bedroom with them.
<P>
The grim Yukon life had failed to make Daylight hard.  It
required civilization to produce this result.  In the fierce,
savage game he now played, his habitual geniality imperceptibly
slipped away from him, as did his lazy Western drawl.  As his
speech became sharp and nervous, so did his mental processes.  In
the swift rush of the game he found less and less time to spend
on being merely good-natured.  The change marked his face itself.
<P>
The lines grew sterner.  Less often appeared the playful curl of
his lips, the smile in the wrinkling corners of his eyes.  The
eyes themselves, black and flashing, like an Indian's, betrayed
glints of cruelty and brutal consciousness of power.  His
tremendous vitality remained, and radiated from all his being,
but it was vitality under the new aspect of the man-trampling
man-conqueror.  His battles with elemental nature had been, in a
way, impersonal; his present battles were wholly with the males
of his species, and the hardships of the trail, the river, and
the frost marred him far less than the bitter keenness of the
struggle with his fellows.
<P>
He still had recrudescence of geniality, but they were largely
periodical and forced, and they were usually due to the cocktails
he took prior to meal-time.  In the North, he had drunk deeply
and at irregular intervals; but now his drinking became
systematic and disciplined.  It was an unconscious development,
but it was based upon physical and mental condition.  The
cocktails served as an inhibition.  Without reasoning or thinking
about it, the strain of the office, which was essentially due to
the daring and audacity of his ventures, required check or
cessation; and he found, through the weeks and months, that the
cocktails supplied this very thing.  They constituted a stone
wall.  He never drank during the morning, nor in office hours;
but the instant he left the office he proceeded to rear this wall
of alcoholic inhibition athwart his consciousness.  The office
became immediately a closed affair.  It ceased to exist.  In the
afternoon, after lunch, it lived again for one or two hours,
when, leaving it, he rebuilt the wall of inhibition.  Of course,
there were exceptions to this; and, such was the rigor of his
discipline, that if he had a dinner or a conference before him in
which, in a business way, he encountered enemies or allies and
planned or prosecuted campaigns, he abstained from drinking.  But
the instant the business was settled, his everlasting call went
out for a Martini, and for a double-Martini at that, served in a
long glass so as not to excite comment.
