<p>It may have been Mr. Frog's words that dismayed Long Bill Wren, or it
may have been his manner--or perhaps both. Anyhow, Long Bill looked
frightened.
</p>
<p>"Where can I get a fresh skin if I pull off the one I'm wearing?" he
wanted to know.
</p><p>"Why, there's another skin just beneath your old one," Mr. Frog informed
him glibly. "Just pull hard and you'll see that I know what I'm talking
about."
</p><p>But Long Bill was puzzled.
</p><p>"I--I don't know where to begin," he stammered.
</p><p>"Maybe you need help," Mr. Frog suggested.
</p><p>And Long Bill agreed that he did need help--and a good deal of it, too.
</p><p>"Well," Mr. Frog said with a giggle, "I'll get old Mr. Turtle to assist
me. And between us we'll have your old skin off before you know it."
</p><p>He began to bellow Mr. Turtle's name at the top of his lungs. And soon
the old gentleman's black head popped out of the water. And presently
Mr. Turtle waddled up the bank of Black Creek and listened to Ferdinand
Frog's directions.
</p><p>"You take hold of Long Bill's tail," Mr. Frog ordered him, while to the
frightened owner of the tail he said cheerfully, "Anything Mr. Turtle
takes hold of just <u>has</u> to come. He never lets go until it does."
</p><p>Now, Long Bill Wren had suddenly made up his mind that he wouldn't take
a mud bath, after all. He didn't like the prospect of having his skin
pulled off. Suppose Mr. Frog should be mistaken about that second skin,
which the tailor claimed lay underneath the old one?
</p><p>Long Bill believed that with no skin at all he would find his rheumatism
much worse than before. And he would certainly be a queer-looking
object.
</p><p>So as old Mr. Turtle crawled slowly towards him, he drew away.
</p><p>"I'm going to wait----" Long Bill announced.
</p><p>"Why?" Mr. Frog demanded.
</p><p>"Going to wait till the weather is warmer," Long Bill faltered.
</p><p>Of course Mr. Frog was disappointed by having his plans so upset.
</p><p>And Mr. Turtle was disappointed too.
</p><p>"My mouth is open," he told Mr. Frog. "I must grab something. And it
might as well be you."
</p><p>But Mr. Frog jumped nimbly out of Mr. Turtle's reach. And a moment later
he thrust the free end of a tree-root between Mr. Turtle's jaws.
</p><p>They closed with a snap. And Mr. Turtle began to pull.
</p><p>"Come on!" Mr. Frog urged Long Bill Wren. "The tree may fall at any
moment. It's safer elsewhere." And without waiting to see what happened,
he leaped into Black Creek and swam away.
</p><p>As for Long Bill Wren, he hurried home. He knew his wife would be
wondering where he was, for he had been away from the house in the reeds
much longer than his usual ten minutes.
</p><p>Arriving there, he was not surprised that she asked him a few
questions. And he explained to her that he had been on the bank of the
creek, watching old Mr. Turtle pulling at the root of a willow.
</p><p>"And I can tell you that I'm well pleased that it wasn't my tail Mr.
Turtle had in his jaws," he said solemnly.
</p><p>Mrs. Wren shuddered at the mere mention of such an unlucky accident. And
then she said: "I hope that dangerous Mr. Frog was not with you."
</p><p>"I believe he was there for a time," her husband replied. "But he left
before I did."
</p><p>"I wish you would keep away from him," she remarked.
</p><p>"I'm going to," Long Bill Wren promised. "Although Mr. Frog is our
newest neighbor, I shall have nothing more to do with him."
