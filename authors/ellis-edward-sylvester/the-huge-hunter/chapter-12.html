<p><em>FROM WHERE </em>young Brainerd was perched on the tree it
was impossible to catch a glimpse of the steam man, so patiently
awaiting his return. The distance was also too great for him to
make himself beard by the miners, who were hard at work twenty
miles away.</p>

<p>Fruitful in expedients, it was not long before the boy found
a resource in his trouble. Tearing a large strip from his coat,
he tore this into smaller strips, until he had secured a rope
half a dozen yards in length. Upon the end of this he placed a
loop, and then, descending to the lowest limb, he devoted himself
to the task of drooping it over the end of his gun. It fortunately
had fallen in such a manner that the muzzle was somewhat elevated,
so that here was a good opportunity for the exercise of his skill
and patience.</p>

<p>When the first attempt was made the bear suddenly clawed at it
and tore it from the boy's hand before he could jerk it beyond
his reach. So he was compelled to make another one.</p>

<p>Nothing discouraged, the boy soon had this completed, and it
was dropped down more cautiously than before. When the grizzly
made a lunge at it, it was deftly twitched out of his way.</p>

<p>This was repeated several times, until the brute became disgusted
with the sport, and dropping down behind the tree, let the boy
do all the fishing he chose.</p>

<p>Now was his time, but the boy did not allow his eagerness to
overcome the steadiness of his nerves. It required no little skill,
but he finally succeeded in dropping the noose over the muzzle
of the gun and jerked it up taut.</p>

<p>With a heart beating high with hope, Johnny saw it lifted clear
of the ground, and he began carefully drawing it up. The grizzly
looked curiously at his maneuvers, and once made as if to move
toward the dangling rifle; but, ere his mind was settled, it was
drawn beyond his reach, and the cold muzzle was grasped in the
hand of the eagerly waiting boy.</p>

<p>While drawing it up, he had been debating with himself as to
the best means of killing the brute. Remembering that his first
shot had done no harm, he sensibly concluded that he had not yet
learned the vulnerable part of the monster.</p>

<p>His gun was loaded very carefully, and when everything was ready
he made a noise, to attract the attention of the brute. The bear
looked up instantly, when the gun was aimed straight at his right
eye.</p>

<p>Ere the grizzly could withdraw his gaze, the piece was discharged,
and the bullet sped true, crashing into the skull of the colossal
brute. With a howling grunt, he rose upon his hind feet, clawed
the air a few moments, and then dropped dead.</p>

<p>Young Brainerd waited until he was certain that the last spark
of life had fled, when he cautiously descended the tree, scarcely
able to realize the truth that he had slain a grizzly bear, the
monarch of the western wilderness. But such was the fact, and
he felt more pride at the thought than if he had slain a dozen
buffaloes.</p>

<p>'If I only had him in the wagon,' he reflected, 'I'd take him
into camp, for they will never believe I killed a grizzly bear.'</p>

<p>However, it occurred to him that he might secure some memento,
and accordingly he cut several claws and placed them in his pocket.
This done, he concluded that, as the afternoon was well advanced,
it was time he started homeward.</p>

<p>His hurried flight from the ferocious brute had bewildered him
somewhat, and, when he took the direction he judged to be the
right one, he found nothing familiar or remembered, from which
fact he concluded he was going astray.</p>

<p>But a little computation on his part, and he soon righted himself,
and was walking along quite hopefully, when he received another
severe shock of terror, at hearing the unmistakable whoop of an
Indian, instantly followed by several others.</p>

<p>Immediately he recalled the warning given by the trapper, and
looked furtively about, to make sure that he was not already in
their hands. His great anxiety now was to reach the steam man
and leave the neighborhood, which was rapidly becoming untenable.</p>

<p>So he began stealing forward as rapidly as possible, at the same
time keeping a sharp lookout for danger. It required a half-hour,
proceeding at this rate, before reaching the base of the mountain.
The moment he did so, he looked all around in quest of the steam
man, whom he had been compelled to desert for so long a time.</p>

<p>He discovered it standing several hundred yards away; but, to
his dismay, there were fully a dozen Indians standing and walking
about it, examining every portion with the greatest curiosity.</p>

<p>Here was a dilemma indeed, and the boy began to believe that
he had gotten himself into an inextricable difficulty, for how
to reach the steam man and renew the fire, under the circumstances,
was a question which might well puzzle an older head to answer.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate that the machine should have been taken at
this great disadvantage, for it was stripping it of its terror
to those Indians, who were such inveterate enemies to the whites.
They had probably viewed it with wonder and fear at first; but
finding it undemonstrative, had gradually gathered courage, until
they had congregated around it, and made as critical a scrutiny
as they know how.</p>

<p>Whatever fear or terror they had felt at first sight was now
gone; for they seemed on the most familiar terms with it.</p>

<p>Several climbed into the wagon, others passed in and around the
helpless giant, and one valiant follow bit him a thwack on the
stomach with his tomahawk.</p>

<p>This blow hurt the boy far more than it did the iron man, and
he could hardly repress a cry of pain, as he looked upon the destruction
of his wonderful friend as almost inevitable.</p>

<p>The savage, however, contented himself with this demonstration,
and immediately after walked away toward the mountain. The observant
boy knew what this meant, and he withdrew from his temporary hiding-place,
and started to watch him.</p>

<p>The fact that the Indian followed precisely the path taken by
him, did not remove the uneasiness, and he made up his mind that
nothing but danger was to come to him from this proceeding.</p>

<p>When the Indian had reached the spot where the dead grizzly bear
lay, he paused in the greatest wonderment. Here was something
which he did not understand.</p>

<p>The dead carcass showed that somebody had slain him, and the
shot in the eye looked as though it had been done by an experienced
hunter. A few minutes' examination of the ground showed further
that he who had fired the shot was in the tree at the time, after
which he had descended and fled.</p>

<p>All this took but a few minutes for the savage to discover, when
he gave a whoop of triumph at his success in probing the matter,
and started off on the trail.</p>

<p>Unluckily, this led straight toward the bowlder behind which
the boy had concealed himself; and ere he could find a new hiding-place
the Indian was upon him.</p>

<p>At sight of the boy, the savage gave a whoop, and raised his
tomahawk; but the youngster was expecting this, and instantly
raising his gun, he discharged it full into his heart.</p>

<p>As he heard the shriek of the Indian, and saw him throw up his
arms, he did not wait to bear or see anything else, but instantly
fled with might and main, scarcely looking or knowing whither
he was going.</p>

<p>A short time after he found himself at the base of the mountain,
very near the spot where he had first come, and glancing again
toward the steam man, he saw him standing motion less, as before,
and with not a single Indian in sight! </p>
