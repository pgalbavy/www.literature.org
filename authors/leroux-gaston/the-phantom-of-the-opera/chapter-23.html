<p><em>THE PERSIAN'S NARRATIVE CONTINUED</em>.</p>

<p>The voice repeated angrily:  "What have you done with my bag? 
So it was to take my bag that you asked me to release you!"</p>

<p>We heard hurried steps, Christine running back to the Louis-Philippe
room, as though to seek shelter on the other side of our wall.</p>

<p>"What are you running away for?" asked the furious voice, which
had followed her.  "Give me back my bag, will you?  Don't you
know that it is the bag of life and death?"</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Erik," sighed the girl.  "As it is settled that
we are to live together ... what difference can it make to you?"</p>

<p>"You know there are only two keys in it," said the monster. 
"What do you want to do?"</p>

<p>"I want to look at this room which I have never seen and which
you have always kept from me ...  It's woman's curiosity!" she
said, in a tone which she tried to render playful.</p>

<p>But the trick was too childish for Erik to be taken in by it.</p>

<p>"I don't like curious women," he retorted, "and you had better
remember the story of <em>BLUE-BEARD </em>and be careful ... 
Come, give me back my bag! ... Give me back my bag! ... Leave
the key alone, will you, you inquisitive little thing?"</p>

<p>And he chuckled, while Christine gave a cry of pain.  Erik had
evidently recovered the bag from her.</p>

<p>At that moment, the viscount could not help uttering an exclamation
of impotent rage.</p>

<p>"Why, what's that?" said the monster.  "Did you hear, Christine?"</p>

<p>"No, no," replied the poor girl.  "I heard nothing."</p>

<p>"I thought I heard a cry."</p>

<p>"A cry!  Are you going mad, Erik?  Whom do you expect to give
a cry, in this house? ... I cried out, because you hurt me!  I
heard nothing."</p>

<p>"I don't like the way you said that! ... You're trembling... 
You're quite excited ...  You're lying! ... That was a cry, there
was a cry! ... There is some one in the torture-chamber! ... 
Ah, I understand now!"</p>

<p>"There is no one there, Erik!"</p>

<p>"I understand!"</p>

<p>"No one!"</p>

<p>"The man you want to marry, perhaps!"</p>

<p>"I don't want to marry anybody, you know I don't."</p>

<p>Another nasty chuckle.  "Well, it won't take long to find out.
Christine, my love, we need not open the door to see what is happening
in the torture-chamber. Would you like to see?  Would you like
to see? Look here!  If there is some one, if there is really some
one there, you will see the invisible window light up at the top,
near the ceiling.  We need only draw the black curtain and put
out the light in here.  There, that's it ...  Let's put out the
light!  You're not afraid of the dark, when you're with your little
husband!"</p>

<p>Then we heard Christine's voice of anguish:</p>

<p>"No! ... I'm frightened! ... I tell you, I'm afraid of the dark!
...  I don't care about that room now ...  You're always frightening
me, like a child, with your torture-chamber! ... And so I became
inquisitive... But I don't care about it now ... not a bit ...
not a bit!"</p>

<p>And that which I feared above all things began, <em>AUTOMATICALLY. 
</em>We were suddenly flooded with light!  Yes, on our side of
the wall, everything seemed aglow.  The Vicomte de Chagny was
so much taken aback that he staggered.  And the angry voice roared:</p>

<p>"I told you there was some one!  Do you see the window now? 
The lighted window, right up there?  The man behind the wall can't
see it! But you shall go up the folding steps:  that is what they
are there for! ... You have often asked me to tell you; and now
you know! ... They are there to give a peep into the torture-chamber
... you inquisitive little thing!"</p>

<p>"What tortures? ... Who is being tortured? ... Erik, Erik, say
you are only trying to frighten me! ... Say it, if you love me,
Erik! ... There are no tortures, are there?"</p>

<p>"Go and look at the little window, dear!"</p>

<p>I do not know if the viscount heard the girl's swooning voice,
for he was too much occupied by the astounding spectacle that
now appeared before his distracted gaze.  As for me, I had seen
that sight too often, through the little window, at the time of
the rosy hours of Mazenderan; and I cared only for what was being
said next door, seeking for a hint how to act, what resolution
to take.</p>

<p>"Go and peep through the little window!  Tell me what he looks
like!"</p>

<p>We heard the steps being dragged against the wall.</p>

<p>"Up with you! ... No! ... No, I will go up myself, dear!"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, I will go up.  Let me go!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling, my darling! ... How sweet of you! ... How nice
of you to save me the exertion at my age! ... Tell me what he
looks like!"</p>

<p>At that moment, we distinctly heard these words above our heads:</p>

<p>"There is no one there, dear!"</p>

<p>"No one? ... Are you sure there is no one?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course not ... no one!"</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right! ... What's the matter, Christine?  You're
not going to faint, are you ... as there is no one there? ... 
Here ... come down ... there! ... Pull yourself together ... as
there is no one there! ... <em>BUT HOW DO YOU LIKE THE LANDSCAPE</em>?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very much!"</p>

<p>"There, that's better! ... You're better now, are you not? ... 
That's all right, you're better! ... No excitement! ... And what
a funny house, isn't it, with landscapes like that in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's like the Musee Grevin ...  But, say, Erik ... there
are no tortures in there! ... What a fright you gave me!"</p>

<p>"Why ... as there is no one there?"</p>

<p>"Did you design that room?  It's very handsome.  You're a great
artist, Erik."</p>

<p>"Yes, a great artist, in my own line."</p>

<p>"But tell me, Erik, why did you call that room the torture-chamber?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's very simple.  First of all, what did you see?"</p>

<p>"I saw a forest."</p>

<p>"And what is in a forest?"</p>

<p>"Trees."</p>

<p>"And what is in a tree?"</p>

<p>"Birds."</p>

<p>"Did you see any birds?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not see any birds."</p>

<p>"Well, what did you see?  Think!  You saw branches And what are
the branches?" asked the terrible voice.  "<em>THERE'S A GIBBET! 
</em>That is why I call my wood the torture-chamber! ... You see,
it's all a joke.  I never express myself like other people.  But
I am very tired of it! ... I'm sick and tired of having a forest
and a torture-chamber in my house and of living like a mountebank,
in a house with a false bottom! ... I'm tired of it!  I want to
have a nice, quiet flat, with ordinary doors and windows and a
wife inside it, like anybody else!  A wife whom I could love and
take out on Sundays and keep amused on week-days ... Here, shall
I show you some card-tricks? That will help us to pass a few minutes,
while waiting for eleven o'clock to-morrow evening ...  My dear
little Christine! ... Are you listening to me? ... Tell me you
love me! ...  No, you don't love me ... but no matter, you will!
... Once, you could not look at my mask because you knew what
was behind... And now you don't mind looking at it and you forget
what is behind! ... One can get used to everything ... if one
wishes...  Plenty of young people who did not care for each other
before marriage have adored each other since!  Oh, I don't know
what I am talking about!  But you would have lots of fun with
me.  For instance, I am the greatest ventriloquist that ever lived,
I am the first ventriloquist in the world! ... You're laughing
...  Perhaps you don't believe me?  Listen."</p>

<p>The wretch, who really was the first ventriloquist in the world,
was only trying to divert the child's attention from the torture-chamber;
but it was a stupid scheme, for Christine thought of nothing but
us! She repeatedly besought him, in the gentlest tones which she
could assume:</p>

<p>"Put out the light in the little window! ... Erik, do put out
the light in the little window!"</p>

<p>For she saw that this light, which appeared so suddenly and of
which the monster had spoken in so threatening a voice, must mean
something terrible.  One thing must have pacified her for a moment;
and that was seeing the two of us, behind the wall, in the midst
of that resplendent light, alive and well.  But she would certainly
have felt much easier if the light had been put out.</p>

<p>Meantime, the other had already begun to play the ventriloquist. 
He said:</p>

<p>"Here, I raise my mask a little ...  Oh, only a little! ... 
You see my lips, such lips as I have?  They're not moving! ...
My mouth is closed&mdash;such mouth as I have&mdash;and yet you hear my
voice... Where will you have it?  In your left ear?  In your right
ear?  In the table?  In those little ebony boxes on the mantelpiece?
...  Listen, dear, it's in the little box on the right of the
mantelpiece: what does it say? '<em>SHALL I TURN THE SCORPION?'
... </em>And now, crack!  What does it say in the little box on
the left?  '<em>SHALL I TURN THE GRASSHOPPER?' ... </em>And now,
crack!  Here it is in the little leather bag ...  What does it
say?  'I AM <em>THE LITTLE BAG OF LIFE AND DEATH!' ...  </em>And
now, crack!  It is in Carlotta's throat, in Carlotta's golden
throat, in Carlotta's crystal throat, as I live!  What does it
say?  It says, 'It's I, Mr. Toad, it's I singing!  I <em>FEEL
WITHOUT ALARM&mdash;CO-ACK &</em>mdash;<em>WITH ITS MELODY ENWIND ME
&</em>mdash;<em>CO-ACK!' ...  </em>And now, crack!  It is on a
chair in the ghost's box and it says, '<em>MADAME CARLOTTA IS
SINGING TO-NIGHT TO BRING THE CHANDELIER DOWN!' ... </em>And now,
crack!  Aha!  Where is Erik's voice now?  Listen, Christine, darling! 
Listen!  It is behind the door of the torture-chamber! Listen! 
It's myself in the torture-chamber! And what do I say?  I say,
'Woe to them that have a nose, a real nose, and come to look round
the torture-chamber! Aha, aha, aha!'"</p>

<p>Oh, the ventriloquist's terrible voice!  It was everywhere, everywhere.
It passed through the little invisible window, through the walls. 
It ran around us, between us.  Erik was there, speaking to us! 
We made a movement as though to fling ourselves upon him.  But,
already, swifter, more fleeting than the voice of the echo, Erik's
voice had leaped back behind the wall!</p>

<p>Soon we heard nothing more at all, for this is what happened:</p>

<p>"Erik!  Erik!" said Christine's voice.  "You tire me with your
voice. Don't go on, Erik!  Isn't it very hot here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Erik's voice, "the heat is unendurable!"</p>

<p>"But what does this mean? ... The wall is really getting quite
hot! ... The wall is burning!"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, Christine, dear:  it is because of the forest
next door."</p>

<p>"Well, what has that to do with it?  The forest?"</p>

<p>"<em>WHY, DIDN'T YOU SEE THAT IT WAS AN AFRICAN FOREST</em>?"</p>

<p>And the monster laughed so loudly and hideously that we could
no longer distinguish Christine's supplicating cries!  The Vicomte
de Chagny shouted and banged against the walls like a madman. 
I could not restrain him.  But we heard nothing except the monster's
laughter, and the monster himself can have heard nothing else. 
And then there was the sound of a body falling on the floor and
being dragged along and a door slammed and then nothing, nothing
more around us save the scorching silence of the south in the
heart of a tropical forest!</p>
