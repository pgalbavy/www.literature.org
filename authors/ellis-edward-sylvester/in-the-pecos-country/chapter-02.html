<p>Sut Simpson was thoroughly impatient and angry. Knowing, as well
as he did, the dangerous character of Arizona, New Mexico, Northwestern
Texas and Indian Territory, he could not excuse such a foolhardy
proceeding as that of a small colony settling in the very heart
of that section. The nearest point where they could hope for safety
was Fort Severn, fifty miles distant. There was a company of soldiers
under command of an experienced United States officer, and they
knew well enough to keep within the protection of their stockades,
except when making reconnoissances in force.</p>

<p>All those who were acquainted with the veteran scout were accustomed
to defer to his judgment, where Indians were concerned, and he
was so used to receiving this deference, that when he was contradicted
and gainsayed by these new settlers, he lost his patience, and
started to leave them in a sort of mild passion.</p>

<p>The place fixed for the location of New Boston was in a gently
sloping valley, with the Rio Pecos running on the right. The soil
was fertile, as was shown in the abundance of rich, succulent
grass which grew about them, while, only a few hundred yards up
the river, was a grove of timber, filled in with dense undergrowth
and brush&mdash;the most favorable location possible for a band of
daring red-skins, when preparing to make a raid upon the settlement.
The hunter turned the head of his mustang in the direction of
this wood, and rode away at a slow walk. He had nearly reached
the margin, when some one called to him:</p>

<p>"Hist, there, ye spalpeen! Won't ye howld on a minute?"</p>

<p>Turning his head, he saw the Irishman walking rapidly toward
him, after the manner of one who had something important to say.
He instantly checked his horse, and waited for him to come up.</p>

<p>"Do you know," struck in Mickey, "that I belaved in Misther Barnwell
till we reached Kansas City? There we met people that had been
all through this country and that knew all about it, and every
one of the spalpeens told us that we'd lose our sculps if we comed
on. I did n't consider it likely that all of them folks would
talk in that style unless they meant it, and half a dozen of us
made up our minds that the best thing we could do was to go back,
or stop where we was. We wint to Misther Barnwell and plaided
with him, and I was ready to break a shillalah over his head by
way of convincin' him of the truth of me remarks, but it was no
use. He just grinned and shook his head. The folks all seem to
be afeard of him, as though he were St. Patrick or some other
sensible gintleman, and so we comed on."</p>

<p>"What made <em>you</em> come?" asked Sut, throwing his knee upon
the saddle and looking down upon the Irishman. "You could do as
you choosed."</p>

<p>"No, I could n't. I hired out to Mr. Moonson for a year, and
there ain't half a year gone yet, and I've got to stick to him
till the time is up."</p>

<p>"Whose little boy is that I seed standing by you?"</p>

<p>"That's Mr. Moonson's boy, Fred, one of the foinest, liveliest
lads ye ever sot eyes on, and I'm much worried on his account."</p>

<p>"Are his parents with you?"</p>

<p>"Naither of 'em."</p>

<p>The hunter looked surprised, and the Irishman hastened to explain.</p>

<p>"I never knowed his mother&mdash;she havin' been dead afore I lift
owld Ireland&mdash;and his father was taken down with a sort of fever
a week ago, when we was t'other side of Fort Aubray. It was n't
anything dangerous at all but it sort of weakened him, so that
it was belaved best for him to tarry there awhile until he could
regain his strength."</p>

<p>"Why did n't you and the younker stay with him?"</p>

<p>"That's what orter been done," replied the disgusted Irishman.
"But as it was n't, here we are. The owld gintleman, Mr. Moonson,
had considerable furniture and goods that went best with the train,
and he needed me to look after it. He thought the boy would be
safer with the train than with him, bein' that when he comes on,
as he hopes to do, in the course of a week, be the same more or
less, he will not have more than two or three companions. What
I wanted to ax yez," said Mickey, checking his disposition to
loquacity, "is whether ye are in dead airnest 'bout saying the
copper-colored gentleman will be down here for the purpose of
blotting out the metropolis of New Boston?"</p>

<p>"Be here? Of course they will, just as sure as you're a livin'
man. And you won't have to wait long, either."</p>

<p>"How long?"</p>

<p>"Inside of a week, mebbe within three days. The last I heard
of Lone Wolf, he was down in the direction of the Llano Estaeado,
some two or three hundred miles from here, and it won't take him
long to come that distance."</p>

<p>"Is he the only Indian chief in this country, that ye talk so
much about him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! there are plenty of 'em, but Lone Wolf has a special
weakness for such parties as this."</p>

<p>"When he does come, what is best for us to do?"</p>

<p>"You'll make the best fight you can, of course, and if you get
licked, as I've no doubt you will, and you're well mounted, you
must all strike a bee-line for Fort Severn, and never stop till
you reach the stockades. You can't miss the road, for you've only
got to ride toward the setting sun, as though you meant to dash
your animal right through it."</p>

<p>"Where will the spalpeen come from?"</p>

<p>The hunter pointed toward the woods before them.</p>

<p>"That's just the place the varmints would want&mdash;they could n't
want any nicer. You may be lookin' at that spot, and they'll crawl
right in afore you'r eyes, and lay thar for hours without your
seein' 'em. You want to get things fixed, so that you can make
a good fight when they do swoop down on you. I guess that long-legged
chap that I was talkin' to knows enough for that. You seem to
have more sense than any of 'em, and I'll give you a little advice.
Let's see, what's your name?"</p>

<p>The Irishman gave it, and the hunter responded by mentioning
his own.</p>

<p>"Do you put some one in here to keep watch night and day, and
the minute you see the redskins comin' give the signal and run
for your friends there. Then if the red-skins foller, you must
let 'em have it right and left. If you find you can't hold your
own agin 'em, you must make all haste to Fort Severn, as you heard
me say a while ago. Aim for the setting sun, and after you've
gone fifty miles or so you'll be thar. Good by to you, now; I'm
watching the Injin movements in these parts, and, if the signs
are bad, and I have the chance, I'll give you notice; but you
must n't depend on me."</p>

<p>The hunter leaned over the saddle, and warmly shook the hand
of the Irishman, the two having conceived a strong liking for
each other.</p>

<p>Then he wheeled his mustang about, and gave him a word that caused
him at once to break into a swift gallop, which quickly carried
him up the slope, until he reached the margin of the valley, over
which he went at the same rate, and speedily vanished from view.</p>

<p>The Irishman stood gazing at the spot where he had vanished,
and then he walked thoughtfully back toward the settlement, where
all were as busy as beavers, getting their rude huts and homes
in condition for living. In doing this Caleb Barnwell was guided
by a desire to be prepared for the Indian visitation, which he
knew was likely soon to be made. They had gathered an immense
quantity of driftwood along the banks of the Rio Pecos, and the
other timber that they needed had already been cut and dragged
from the woods, so that about all the material they needed was
at hand.</p>

<p>Even with their huts a third or a half finished, they would be
in a much better condition to receive the attack of the Apaches
than if compelled to place their heavy luggage-wagons in a semi-circle
and fight from behind them.</p>

<p>"The gentleman spakes the thruth," muttered Mickey, as he walked
along, "and I'm not the one to forgit such a favor, when he took
so much pains to tell me. I'll remember and fix a watch in the
wood."</p>
