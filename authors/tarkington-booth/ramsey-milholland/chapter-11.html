<p>"If I <em>could</em> do it," he vociferated, "if I <em>could</em>
stand up there and debate one o' their darn ole debates in the
first place&mdash;if I had the gall to even try it, why, my gosh! you
don't suppose I'm goin' to get up there and argue with <em>that
girl</em>, do you? That's a hot way to get an education: stand
up there and argue with a girl before a couple o' hundred people!
My <em>gosh!</em>"</p>

<p>"You got to!" his prostrate companion cackled, weakly. "You can't
get out of it. You're a goner, ole Buddy!"</p>

<p>"I'll be sick. I'll be sick as a dog! I'll be sick as the sickest
dog that ever&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No use, ole man. The frat seniors'll be on the job. They'll
know whether you're sick or not, and they'll have you there, right
on the spot to the minute!"</p>

<p>The prediction was accurate. The too fatherly "frat seniors"
did all that Fred said they would, and more. For the honour of
the "frat," they coached the desperate Ramsey in the technic of
Lumen debate, told him many more things to say than could be said
in six minutes, and produced him, despairing, ghastly, and bedewed,
in the large hall of the Lumen Society at eight o'clock on Friday
evening.</p>

<p>Four other "twelve-minute debates" preceded his and the sound
of these, in Ramsey's ears, was the sound of Gabriel practising
on his horn in the early morning of Judgment Day. The members
of the society sat, three rows deep, along the walls of the room,
leaving a clear oblong of green carpet in the centre, where were
two small desks, twenty feet apart, the rostrums of the debaters.
Upon a platform at the head of the room sat dreadful seniors,
the officers of the society, and, upon benches near the platform,
the debaters of the evening were aligned. One of the fraternal
seniors sat with sweltering Ramsey; and the latter, as his time
relentlessly came nearer, made a last miserable squirm.</p>

<p>"Look here, Brother Colburn, I got to get out o' here."</p>

<p>"No, you don't, young fellow."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do!" Ramsey whispered, passionately. "Honest, I do. Honest,
Brother Colburn, I got to get a drink of water. I <em>got</em>
to!"</p>

<p>"No. You can't."</p>

<p>"Honest, Colburn, I <em>got</em>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!"</p>

<p>Ramsey grunted feebly, and cast his dilating eyes along the rows
of faces. Most of them were but as blurs, swimming, yet he was
aware (he thought) of a formidable and horrible impassive scrutiny
of himself, a glare seeming to pierce through him to the back
of the belt round his waist, so that he began to have fearful
doubts about that belt, about every fastening and adjustment of
his garments, about the expression of his countenance, and about
many other things jumbling together in his consciousness. Over
and over he whispered gaspingly to himself the opening words of
the sentence with which Colburn had advised him to begin his argument.
And as the moment of supreme agony drew close, this whispering
became continuous: "In making my first appearance before this
honor'ble membership I feel constrained to say in making my first
appearance before this honor'ble membership I feel constrained
to say in making my first appearance before this honor'ble mem&mdash;"</p>

<p>...It had come. The chairman announced the subject of the fourth
freshman twelve-minute debate; and Dora Yocum, hitherto unperceived
by Ramsey, rose and went forward to one of the small desks in
the open space, where she stood composedly, a slim, pretty figure
in white. Members in Ramsey's neighbourhood were aware of a brief
and hushed commotion, and of Colburn's fierce whisper, "You can't!
You get up there!" And the blanched Ramsey came forth and placed
himself at the other desk.</p>

<p>He stood before the silent populace of that morgue, and it seemed
to him that his features had forgotten that he was supposed to
be their owner and in control of them; he felt that they were
slipping all over his face, regardless of his wishes. His head,
as a whole, was subject to an agitation not before known by him;
it desired to move rustily in eccentric ways of its own devising;
his legs alternately limbered and straightened under no direction
but their own; and his hands clutched each other fiercely behind
his back; he was not one cohesive person, evidently, but an assembled
collection of parts which had relapsed each into its own individuality.
In spite of them, he somehow contrived the semblance of a bow
toward the chairman and the semblance of another toward Dora,
of whom he was but hazily conscious. Then he opened his mouth,
and, not knowing how he had started his voice going, heard it
as if from a distance.</p>

<p>"In making my first appearance before this honor'ble membership
I feel restrained to say&mdash;" He stopped short, and thenceforward
shook visibly. After a long pause, he managed to repeat his opening,
stopped again, swallowed many times, produced a handkerchief and
wiped his face, an act of necessity&mdash;then had an inspiration.</p>

<p>"The subject assigned to me," he said, "is resolved that Germany
is mor'ly and legally justified in Belgians &mdash;Belgiums! This
subject was assigned to me to be the subject of this debate."
He interrupted himself to gasp piteously; found breathing difficult,
but faltered again: "This subject is the subject. It is the subject
that was assigned to me on a postal card." Then, for a moment
or so, he had a miraculous spurt of confidence, and continued
rather rapidly: "I feel constrained to say that the country of
Belgian &mdash;Belgium, I mean&mdash;this country has been constrained
by the&mdash;invaded I mean&mdash;invaded by the imperial German Impire
and my subject in this debate is whether it ought to or not, my
being the infernative&mdash;affirmative, I mean&mdash;that I got to prove
that Germany is mor'ly and legally justified. I wish to state
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused again, lengthily, then struggled on. "I have been requested
to state that the German Imp &mdash;Empire&mdash;that it certainly
isn't right for those Dutch &mdash;Germans, I mean&mdash;they haven't
got any more business in Belgium than I have myself, but I &mdash;I
feel constrained to say that I had to accept whatever side of
this debate I got on the postal card, and so I am constrained
to take the side of the Dutch. I mean the Germans. The Dutch are
sometimes called &mdash;I mean the Germans are sometimes called
the Dutch in this country, but they aren't Dutch, though sometimes
called Dutch in this country. Well, and so&mdash;so, well, the war
began last August or about then, anyway, and the German army invaded
the Belgian army. After they got there, the invasion began. First,
they came around there and then they commenced invading. Well,
what I feel constrained&mdash;"</p>

<p>He came to the longest of all his pauses here, and the awful
gravity of the audience almost suffocated him. "Well," he concluded,
"it don't look right to me."</p>

<p>"Four minutes!" the chairman announced, for Ramsey's pauses had
worn away a great deal more of this terrible interval than had
his eloquence. "Opening statement for the negative: Miss D. Yocum.
Four minutes."</p>

<p>As Dora began to speak, Ramsey experienced a little relief, but
only a little&mdash;about the same amount of relief as that felt by
a bridegroom when it is the bride's turn to "respond," not really
relief at all, but merely the slight relaxation of a continuing
strain. The audience now looked at Ramsey no more than people
look at a bridegroom, but he failed to perceive any substantial
mitigation of his frightful conspicuousness. He had not the remotest
idea of what he had said in setting forth his case for Germany,
and he knew that it was his duty to listen closely to Dora, in
order to be able to refute her argument when his two-minute closing
speech fell due but he was conscious of little more than his own
condition. His legs had now gone wild beyond all devilry, and
he had to keep shifting his weight from one to the other in order
even to hope that their frenzy might escape general attention.</p>

<p>He realized that Dora was speaking rapidly and confidently, and
that somewhere in his ill-assembled parts lurked a familiar bit
of him that objected to her even more than usual; but she had
used half of her time, at least, before he was able to gather
any coherent meaning from what she was saying. Even then he caught
only a fragment, here and there, and for the rest&mdash;so far as Ramsey
was concerned&mdash;she might as well have been reciting the Swedish
alphabet.</p>

<p>In spite of the rather startling feebleness of her opponent's
statement, Dora went at her task as earnestly as if it were to
confute some monster of casuistry. "Thus, having demonstrated
that <em>all</em> war is wrong," she said, approaching her conclusion,
"it is scarcely necessary to point out that whatever the actual
circumstances of the invasion, and whatever the status of the
case in international law, or by reason of treaty, or the German
oath to respect the neutrality of Belgium, which of course was
grossly and dishonorably violated&mdash;all this, I say, ladies and
gentlemen of the Lumen Society, all this is beside the point of
morals. Since, as I have shown, <em>all</em> war is wrong, the
case may be simplified as follows: All war is morally wrong. <em>Quod
erat demonstrandum</em>. Germany invaded Belgium. Invasion is
war. Germany, therefore, did moral wrong. Upon the legal side,
as I began by pointing out, Germany confessed in the Reichstag
the violation of law. Therefore, Germany was justified in the
invasion neither morally nor legally; but was both morally and
legally wrong and evil. Ladies and gentlemen of the Lumen Society,
I await the refutation of my opponent!"</p>

<p>Her opponent appeared to be having enough trouble with his legs,
without taking any added cares upon himself in the way of refutations.
But the marvellous Dora had calculated the length of her statement
with such nicety that the chairman announced "Four minutes," almost
upon the instant of her final syllable; and all faces turned once
more to the upholder of the affirmative. "Refutation and conclusion
by the affirmative," said the chairman. "Mr. R. Milholland. Two
minutes."</p>

<p>Therewith, Ramsey coughed as long as he could cough, and when
he felt that no more should be done in this way, he wiped his
face&mdash;again an act of necessity&mdash;and quaveringly began:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen and ladies, or ladies and gentlemen, in making the
refutation of my opponent, I feel that &mdash;I feel that hardly
anything more ought to be said."</p>

<p>He paused, looked helplessly at his uncontrollable legs, and
resumed: "I am supposed to make the reputa&mdash;the refutation of
my opponent, and I feel that I ought to say quite a good deal
more. In the first place, I feel that the invasion has taken place.
I am supposed&mdash;anyhow I got a postal card that I am supposed to
be here to-night. Well, in talking over this matter with a couple
of seniors, they told me I was supposed to claim this invasion
was mor'ly and legally all right. Well&mdash;" Here, by some chance,
the recollection of a word of Dora's flickered into his chaotic
mind, and he had a brighter moment. "My opponent said she proved
all war is wrong&mdash;or something like that, anyhow. She said she
proved it was wrong to fight, no matter what. Well, if she wasn't
a girl, anybody that wanted to get her into a fight could prob'ly
do it." He did not add that he would like to be the person to
make the experiment (if Dora weren't a girl), nor did the thought
enter his mind until an hour or so later. "Well," he added, "I
suppose there is little more to be said."</p>

<p>He was so right, in regard to his own performance, at least,
that, thereupon drying up utterly, he proceeded to stand, a speechless
figure in the midst of a multitudinous silence, for an eternity
lasting forty-five seconds. He made a racking effort, and at the
end of this epoch found words again. "In making my argument in
this debate, I would state that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two minutes!" said the chairman. "Refutation by the negative.
Miss D. Yocum. Two minutes."</p>

<p>"I waive them," said Dora, primly. "I submit that the affirmative
has not refuted the argument of the negative."</p>

<p>"Very well." With his gavel the chairman sharply tapped the desk
before him, "The question is now before the house. 'Resolved,
that Germany is both morally and legally justified in her invasion
of Belgium.' All those in favour of the&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here there was an interruption of a kind never before witnessed
during any proceedings of the Lumen Society. It came from neither
of the debaters, who still remained standing at their desks until
the vote settling their comparative merits in argument should
be taken. The interruption was from the rear row of seats along
the wall, where sat new members of the society, freshmen not upon
the program for the evening. A loud voice was heard from this
quarter, a loud but nasal voice, shrill as well as nasal, and
full of a strange hot passion. "Mr. Chairman!" it cried. "Look-a-here,
Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman, I demand to be heard! You gotta gimme
my say, Mr. Chairman! I'm a-gunna have my <em>say</em>! You look-a-here,
Mr. Chairman!"</p>

<p>Shocked by such a breach of order, and by the unseemly violence
of the speaker, not only the chairman but everyone else looked
there. A short, strong figure was on its feet, gesticulating fiercely;
and the head belonging to it was a large one with too much curly
black hair, a flat, swarthy face, shiny and not immaculately shaven;
there was an impression of ill-chosen clothes, too much fat red
lip, too much tooth, too much eyeball. Fred Mitchell, half-sorrowing,
yet struggling to conceal tears of choked mirth over his roommate's
late exhibition, recognized this violent interrupter as one Linski,
a fellow freshman who sat next to him in one of his classes. "What's
<em>that</em> cuss up to?" Fred wondered, and so did others. Linski
showed them.</p>

<p>He pressed forward, shoving himself through the two rows in front
of him till he emerged upon the green carpet of the open space,
and as he came, he was cyclonic with words.</p>

<p>"You don't put no such stuff as this over, I tell you!" he shouted
in his hot, nasal voice. "This here's a free country, and you
call yourself a debating society, do you? Lemme tell you <em>I</em>
belong to a debating society in Chicago, where I come from, and
them fellas up there, they'd think they'd oughta be shot fer a
fake like what you people are tryin' to put over, here, to-night.
I come down here to git some more education, and pay fer it, too,
in good hard money I've made sweatin' in a machine shop up there
in Chicago; but if <em>this</em> is the kind of education I'm
a-gunna git, I better go on back there. You call this a square
debate, do you?"</p>

<p>He advanced toward the chairman's platform, shaking a frantic
fist. "Well, if you do, you got another think comin', my capitalis'
frien'! you went and give out the question whether it's right
fer Choimuny to go through Belgium; and what do you do fer the
Choimun side? You pick out this here big stiff"&mdash;he waved his
passionate hand at the paralyzed Ramsey&mdash;"you pick out a boob
like that for the Choimun side, a poor fish that gits stagefright
so bad he don't know whether he's talkin' or dead; or else he
fakes it; because he's a speaker so bum it looks more to me like
he was faking. You get this big stiff to fake the Choimun side,
and then you go and stick up a goil agains' him that's got brains
and makes a pacifis' argument that wins the case agains' the Choimuns
like cuttin' through hog lard! But you ain't a-gunna git away
with it, mister! Lemme tell you right here and now, I may be a
mix blood, but I got some Choimun in me with the rest what I got,
and before you vote on this here question you gotta hear a few
woids from somebody that can <em>talk!</em> This whole war is
a capitalis' war, Belgium as much as Choimuny, and the United
States is sellin' its soul to the capitalis' right now, I tell
you, takin' sides agains' Choimuny. Orders fer explosives and
ammanition and guns and Red Cross supplies is comin' into this
country by the millions, and the capitalis' United States is fat
already on the blood of the workers of Europe! Yes, it is, and
I'll have my <em>say,</em> you boorjaw faker, and you can hammer
your ole gavel to pieces at me!"</p>

<p>He had begun to shriek; moisture fell from his brow and his mouth;
the scandalized society was on its feet, nervously into groups.
Evidently the meeting was about to disintegrate. "I'll have my
<em>say</em>!" the frenzied Linski screamed. "You try to put up
this capitalis' trick and work a fake to carry over this debate
agains' Choimuny, but you can't work it on <em>me</em>, lemme
tell you! I'll have my <em>say!</em>"</p>

<p>The outraged chairman was wholly at a loss how to deal with the
"unprecedented situation"&mdash;so he defined it, quite truthfully;
and he continued to pound upon the desk, while other clamours
began to rival Linski's; shouts of "Put him out!" "Order!" "Shut
up, Freshman!" "Turn him over to the sophomores!"</p>

<p>"This meeting is <em>adjourned!</em>" bellowed the chairman,
and there was a thronging toward the doors, while the frothing
Linski asseverated: "I'm a-gunna git my say, I tell you! I'll
have my say! I'll have my <em>say!</em>"</p>

<p>He had more than that, before the hour was over. A moment after
he emerged from the building and came out, still hot, upon the
cool, dark campus, he found himself the centre of a group of his
own classmates whom he at first mistook for sophomores, such was
their manner.</p>

<p>...As this group broke up, a few minutes later, a youth running
to join it, scenting somewhat of interest, detained one of those
who were departing.</p>

<p>"What's up? What was that squealing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. We just talked to that Linski. Nobody else touched
him, but Ramsey Milholland gave him a <em>peach</em> of a punch
on the snoot."</p>

<p>"Whoopee!"</p>

<p>Ramsey was laconic in response to inquiries upon this subject.
When someone remarked: "You served him right for calling you a
boob and a poor fish and so on before all the society, girls and
all," Ramsey only said:</p>

<p>"That wasn't what I hit him for."</p>

<p>He declined to explain further.</p>
