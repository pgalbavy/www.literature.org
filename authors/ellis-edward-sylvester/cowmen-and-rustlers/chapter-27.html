<p>A new matter of interest claimed the immediate attention of the
defenders within the home of ranchman Whitney.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the sister had reported the approach
of a horseman, whom she believed to be her brother. The rider
was now in plain sight, and a brief scrutiny through the glass
by Hawkridge removed all doubt; she was right.</p>

<p>He was coming at an easy, swinging gallop, straight toward his
home. He must have seen the rustlers while yet a considerable
way off, for he quickened the pace of his animal, stirred by a
natural anxiety for his loved ones and by a curiosity to know
the meaning of the strange condition of affairs.</p>

<p>Had he understood matters fully, while yet at a distance, he
would have avoided a mistake which occasioned him and his friends
intense regret, and which proved irreparable.</p>

<p>He did not cease his advance until within a hundred yards, when
the cattlemen, who were watching his every movement, saw him bring
his horse to a sudden halt. At the same moment a couple of rustlers
moved into view, their guns held so as to cover him. He sat motionless
until they came up, one on either side, when he was seen to be
conversing earnestly with them.</p>

<p>"They have made him prisoner," remarked Hawkridge, "just as I
was sure they would."</p>

<p>"Will they do him harm?" asked Mrs. Whitney, who, with Jennie,
had descended the stairs and stood with the group near the front
door.</p>

<p>"No," was Hawkridge's reassuring reply; "he must see the uselessness
of resistance, and we are not fighting Indians who learned warfare
from the late lamented Sitting Bull."</p>

<p>It was noticed that Fred Whitney, despite the wound of a couple
of days before, no longer wore his arm in a sling. As he had said,
he was ashamed to do so.</p>

<p>Brave as was the young man, he had judgment. He knew that he
was at the mercy of a score of rustlers, and quickly learned the
situation. Capt. Asbury, Monteith Sterry, Dick Hawkridge and a
number of cattlemen were besieged in his home.</p>

<p>While he was holding earnest converse with his captors one of
them turned and addressed Inman, who was out of sight of the besieged,
because of the intervening ridge. His reply caused Whitney to
dismount and walk in that direction, he, too, passing out of the
field of vision.</p>

<p>He was invisible for perhaps ten minutes, when he was seen coming
over the ridge toward his own door, but without his Winchester
or revolvers. A moment later he was admitted. He kissed his mother
and sister and grasped the hands of his friends, who crowded around
to congratulate him and hear what he had to say.</p>

<p>"They told me everything," he replied, looking into the glowing
faces, and smiling at the anxiety depicted on several. "I have
made a woeful mistake, boys."</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked several in the same breath.</p>

<p>"Hankinson and Weber have moved several miles further into the
mountains, so nothing will be seen of them for several days, and
perhaps not for a week. The trouble with the rustlers makes it
necessary that we should keep closer watch than usual upon the
stock, and it is understood that they are not to leave the cattle
until they get word from me. So, as I said, they are out of the
question."</p>

<p>"Is that the mistake you refer to?" asked Sterry.</p>

<p>"I wish it was; but a couple of hours ago, Hankinson, who had
ridden a considerable distance beyond the grazing grounds, came
in with the report that a large body of men were camped in a valley
a mile or so further on. There must be fifty at least."</p>

<p>Capt. Asbury emitted a low whistle.</p>

<p>"Rustlers again! By and by we'll have all there are in Wyoming
swarming about this house."</p>

<p>"No; Budd visited them, and found they were cattlemen on the
hunt for rustlers. Had he known of Inman's party out here he would
have given them a pointer, but of course he doesn't dream of anything
of the kind. Now, the mistake I made is this: When I saw the horsemen
gathered about the buildings and ridge, I ought to have wheeled
and ridden as hard as I could to the stockmen. They would have
been here before night and wound up this business in a jiffy.
But I kept on and rode right into the trap set for me, and can
do nothing."</p>

<p>No one could question the justice of Whitney's self-condemnation,
but there was no help for it.</p>

<p>"How is it you were allowed to join us?" asked Capt. Asbury.</p>

<p>"I am here under parole; you see they took my horse, rifle and
pistols from me. I would not have been allowed to come to you
except upon my pledge to return within fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>"And what will they do with you, my boy?" asked his mother, alarmed
by the information.</p>

<p>"Nothing, so long as I remain a model prisoner; but how are you
fixed for defence?"</p>

<p>He was quickly made acquainted with the situation of affairs.</p>

<p>"Ah," he added, with a sigh, "if there was some way of getting
word to the stockmen; but I see none."</p>

<p>"They will not be likely to give you a chance?"</p>

<p>Fred shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I overdid the thing. I asked them to be allowed to
go back to my cattlemen, but they would not listen to it. They
acted as if they were suspicious, and told me I must stay with
them until the trouble ended, which they assured me would be soon."</p>

<p>Sterry glanced significantly at Asbury and Hawkridge. He recalled
that singular message from Duke Vesey. If all went well, it might
contain a shadow of hope. It was deemed best, however, to make
no reference to it, even for the benefit of Whitney, who was questioned
until he described as exactly as he could the location of the
cattlemen.</p>

<p>The grace had expired. No one thought of advising Whitney to
disregard his parole, and no urging could have induced him to
do it. He affectionately kissed and embraced mother and sister,
warmly shook the hands of his friends again, assured them of his
hope that all would come out right, and then, passing through
the door, was seen to walk up the ridge and pass over the summit,
to take his place among his captors, there to await their pleasure.</p>

<p>"Sterry," said Asbury, drawing him and Hawkridge aside, "you
were saying awhile ago that nothing could induce you to accept
the offer of Vesey to slip out in the darkness of the night."</p>

<p>"No; as he presented it, such a flight would have been a piece
of cowardice altogether different from my flight last night. It
would have weakened your defensive force and helped no one but
me."</p>

<p>"Now, however, it wears a different aspect."</p>

<p>"Yes, it looks providential, and promises to open the way for
the escape of all. I hardly think," added Sterry, with a smile,
"that with all of Vesey's gratitude to me he would do what he
intends if he foresaw the probable consequences, for it means
nothing less than the overthrow of Inman's plans."</p>

<p>"And the baffling of his charitable intentions concerning myself,"
grimly added the captain.</p>

<p>"It seems to me we forgot one phase of the business," remarked
Hawkridge, "and that is the fact that the chances of failure are
a hundredfold greater than those of success."</p>

<p>His companions looked questioningly at him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will not be difficult for Vesey to secure the placing
of himself and friend at the stables, as he promises to do, but
it seems unlikely that, with a dark night and the temptation for
some of us to try to get away, they will be the only couple that
will be on the lookout at that time. But, supposing they are,"
added Hawkridge, "Sterry will have to mount his horse and ride
off. There will be some of the rustlers beyond him, and how can
he pass them unchallenged?"</p>

<p>"If it proves too risky to try on horseback I can do it on foot,"
replied Sterry; "in the darkness I will be taken for one of them,
and, if questioned, can throw them off their guard. The tramp
to where the stockmen are in camp I judge to be little if any
more than five miles, and it won't take me long to travel that
after getting clear of these people."</p>

<p>"I have a strong belief that the whole scheme is doomed to failure,"
said Hawkridge, and Capt. Asbury agreed with him.</p>
