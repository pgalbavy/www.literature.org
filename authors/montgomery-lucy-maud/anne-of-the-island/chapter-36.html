"Here is a letter with an Indian stamp for you, Aunt Jimsie,"
said Phil.  "Here are three for Stella, and two for Pris, and a
glorious fat one for me from Jo.  There's nothing for you, Anne,
except a circular."
<P>
Nobody noticed Anne's flush as she took the thin letter Phil tossed
her carelessly.  But a few minutes later Phil looked up to see a
transfigured Anne.
<P>
"Honey, what good thing has happened?"
<P>
"The Youth's Friend has accepted a little sketch I sent them a
fortnight ago," said Anne, trying hard to speak as if she were
accustomed to having sketches accepted every mail, but not
quite succeeding.
<P>
"Anne Shirley!  How glorious!  What was it?  When is it to be
published?  Did they pay you for it?"
<P>
"Yes; they've sent a check for ten dollars, and the editor writes
that he would like to see more of my work.  Dear man, he shall.
It was an old sketch I found in my box.  I re-wrote it and sent
it in -- but I never really thought it could be accepted because
it had no plot," said Anne, recalling the bitter experience of
Averil's Atonement.
<P>
"What are you going to do with that ten dollars, Anne?  Let's all
go up town and get drunk," suggested Phil.
<P>
"I AM going to squander it in a wild soulless revel of some sort,"
declared Anne gaily.  "At all events it isn't tainted money --
like the check I got for that horrible Reliable Baking Powder story.
I spent IT usefully for clothes and hated them every time I put them on."
<P>
"Think of having a real live author at Patty's Place," said Priscilla.
<P>
"It's a great responsibility," said Aunt Jamesina solemnly.
<P>
"Indeed it is," agreed Pris with equal solemnity.  "Authors are
kittle cattle.  You never know when or how they will break out.
Anne may make copy of us."
<P>
"I meant that the ability to write for the Press was a great
responsibility," said Aunt Jamesina severely.  "and I hope Anne
realizes, it.  My daughter used to write stories before she went
to the foreign field, but now she has turned her attention to
higher things.  She used to say her motto was `Never write a line
you would be ashamed to read at your own funeral.'  You'd better
take that for yours, Anne, if you are going to embark in literature.
Though, to be sure," added Aunt Jamesina perplexedly, "Elizabeth
always used to laugh when she said it.  She always laughed so much
that I don't know how she ever came to decide on being a missionary.
I'm thankful she did -- I prayed that she might -- but -- I wish
she hadn't."
<P>
Then Aunt Jamesina wondered why those giddy girls all laughed.
<P>
Anne's eyes shone all that day; literary ambitions sprouted and
budded in her brain; their exhilaration accompanied her to Jennie
Cooper's walking party, and not even the sight of Gilbert and
Christine, walking just ahead of her and Roy, could quite subdue
the sparkle of her starry hopes.  Nevertheless, she was not so
rapt from things of earth as to be unable to notice that
Christine's walk was decidedly ungraceful.
<P>
"But I suppose Gilbert looks only at her face.  So like a man,"
thought Anne scornfully.
<P>
"Shall you be home Saturday afternoon?" asked Roy.
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"My mother and sisters are coming to call on you," said Roy quietly.
<P>
Something went over Anne which might be described as a thrill, but
it was hardly a pleasant one.  She had never met any of Roy's family;
she realized the significance of his statement; and it had, somehow,
an irrevocableness about it that chilled her.
<P>
"I shall be glad to see them," she said flatly; and then wondered
if she really would be glad.  She ought to be, of course.  But
would it not be something of an ordeal?  Gossip had filtered to
Anne regarding the light in which the Gardners viewed the
"infatuation" of son and brother.  Roy must have brought pressure
to bear in the matter of this call.  Anne knew she would be
weighed in the balance.  From the fact that they had consented to
call she understood that, willingly or unwillingly, they regarded
her as a possible member of their clan.
<P>
"I shall just be myself.  I shall not TRY to make a good impression,"
thought Anne loftily.  But she was wondering what dress she would
better wear Saturday afternoon, and if the new style of high
hair-dressing would suit her better than the old; and the walking
party was rather spoiled for her.  By night she had decided that she
would wear her brown chiffon on Saturday, but would do her hair low.
<P>
Friday afternoon none of the girls had classes at Redmond.
Stella took the opportunity to write a paper for the Philomathic
Society, and was sitting at the table in the corner of the
living-room with an untidy litter of notes and manuscript on the
floor around her.  Stella always vowed she never could write
anything unless she threw each sheet down as she completed it.
Anne, in her flannel blouse and serge skirt, with her hair rather
blown from her windy walk home, was sitting squarely in the
middle of the floor, teasing the Sarah-cat with a wishbone.
Joseph and Rusty were both curled up in her lap.  A warm plummy
odor filled the whole house, for Priscilla was cooking in the
kitchen.  Presently she came in, enshrouded in a huge work-apron,
with a smudge of flour on her nose, to show Aunt Jamesina the
chocolate cake she had just iced.
<P>
At this auspicious moment the knocker sounded.  Nobody paid any
attention to it save Phil, who sprang up and opened it, expecting
a boy with the hat she had bought that morning.  On the doorstep
stood Mrs. Gardner and her daughters.
<P>
Anne scrambled to her feet somehow, emptying two indignant cats
out of her lap as she did so, and mechanically shifting her
wishbone from her right hand to her left.  Priscilla, who would
have had to cross the room to reach the kitchen door, lost her
head, wildly plunged the chocolate cake under a cushion on the
inglenook sofa, and dashed upstairs.  Stella began feverishly
gathering up her manuscript.  Only Aunt Jamesina and Phil
remained normal.  Thanks to them, everybody was soon sitting at
ease, even Anne.  Priscilla came down, apronless and smudgeless,
Stella reduced her corner to decency, and Phil saved the
situation by a stream of ready small talk.
<P>
Mrs. Gardner was tall and thin and handsome, exquisitely
gowned, cordial with a cordiality that seemed a trifle forced.
Aline Gardner was a younger edition of her mother, lacking the
cordiality.  She endeavored to be nice, but succeeded only in
being haughty and patronizing.  Dorothy Gardner was slim and
jolly and rather tomboyish.  Anne knew she was Roy's favorite
sister and warmed to her.  She would have looked very much like
Roy if she had had dreamy dark eyes instead of roguish hazel
ones.  Thanks to her and Phil, the call really went off very
well, except for a slight sense of strain in the atmosphere
and two rather untoward incidents.  Rusty and Joseph, left to
themselves, began a game of chase, and sprang madly into
Mrs. Gardner's silken lap and out of it in their wild career.
Mrs. Gardner lifted her lorgnette and gazed after their flying
forms as if she had never seen cats before, and Anne, choking
back slightly nervous laughter, apologized as best she could.
<P>
"You are fond of cats?" said Mrs. Gardner, with a slight
intonation of tolerant wonder.
<P>
Anne, despite her affection for Rusty, was not especially fond of
cats, but Mrs. Gardner's tone annoyed her.  Inconsequently she
remembered that Mrs. John Blythe was so fond of cats that she
kept as many as her husband would allow.
<P>
"They ARE adorable animals, aren't they?" she said wickedly.
<P>
"I have never liked cats," said Mrs. Gardner remotely.
<P>
"I love them," said Dorothy.  "They are so nice and selfish.
Dogs are TOO good and unselfish.  They make me feel uncomfortable.
But cats are gloriously human."
<P>
"You have two delightful old china dogs there.  May I look at
them closely?" said Aline, crossing the room towards the fireplace
and thereby becoming the unconscious cause of the other accident.
Picking up Magog, she sat down on the cushion under which was
secreted Priscilla's chocolate cake.  Priscilla and Anne exchanged
agonized glances but could do nothing.  The stately Aline continued to
sit on the cushion and discuss china dogs until the time of departure.
<P>
Dorothy lingered behind a moment to squeeze Anne's hand and
whisper impulsively.
<P>
"I KNOW you and I are going to be chums.  Oh, Roy has told me all
about you.  I'm the only one of the family he tells things to,
poor boy -- nobody COULD confide in mamma and Aline, you know.
What glorious times you girls must have here!  Won't you let me
come often and have a share in them?"
<P>
"Come as often as you like," Anne responded heartily, thankful
that one of Roy's sisters was likable.  She would never like
Aline, so much was certain; and Aline would never like her,
though Mrs. Gardner might be won.  Altogether, Anne sighed with
relief when the ordeal was over.
<P>
            "`Of all sad words of tongue or pen
            The saddest are it might have been,'"
<P>
quoted Priscilla tragically, lifting the cushion.  "This cake is
now what you might call a flat failure.  And the cushion is
likewise ruined.  Never tell me that Friday isn't unlucky."
<P>
"People who send word they are coming on Saturday shouldn't come
on Friday," said Aunt Jamesina.
<P>
"I fancy it was Roy's mistake," said Phil.  "That boy isn't really
responsible for what he says when he talks to Anne.  Where IS Anne?"
<P>
Anne had gone upstairs.  She felt oddly like crying.  But she
made herself laugh instead.  Rusty and Joseph had been TOO awful!
And Dorothy WAS a dear.
