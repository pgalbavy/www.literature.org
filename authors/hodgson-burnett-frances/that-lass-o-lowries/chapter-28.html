<p>It was even later than usual this evening when Fergus Derrick left the
Rectory. When Mr. Barholm was in his talkative mood, it was not easy for
him to break away. So Derrick was fain to listen and linger, and then
supper was brought in and he was detained again, and at eleven o'clock
Mr. Barholm suddenly hit upon a new topic.
</p>
<p>“By the by,” he said, “where is that fellow, Lowrie? I thought he had
left Riggan.”
</p><p>“He did leave Riggan,” answered Derrick.
</p><p>“So I heard,” returned the Rector, “and I suppose I was mistaken in
fancying I caught sight of him to-day. I don't know the man very well
and I might easily be deceived. But where is he?”
</p><p>“I think,” said Derrick, quietly, “that he is in Riggan. I am not of
the opinion that you were mistaken at all. I am sure he is here, but for
reasons of his own he is keeping himself quiet. I know him too well to
be deceived by any fancied resemblance.”
</p><p>“But what are his reasons?” was the next question. “That looks bad, you
know. He belongs to a bad crew.”
</p><p>“Bad enough,” said Derrick.
</p><p>“Is it a grudge? He is just the rascal to bear a grudge.”
</p><p>“Yes,” said Derrick. “It is a grudge against <u>me</u>.”
</p><p>He looked up then across the table at Anice and smiled reassuringly.
</p><p>“You did not tell us that you had seen him,” she said.
</p><p>“No. You think I ought to be afraid of him, and I am too vain to like
to admit the possibility that it would be better to fear any man, even a
Riggan collier.”
</p><p>“But such a man!” put in Mrs. Barholm. “It seems to me he is a man to be
feared.”
</p><p>“I can thrash him,” said Derrick. He could not help feeling some
enjoyment in this certainty. “I <u>did</u> thrash him upon one occasion, you
know, and a single combat with a fellow of that kind is oftener than not
decisive.”
</p><p>“Yes,” said the Rector, “that is the principal cause of his grudge, I
think. He might forgive you for getting him into trouble, but he will
never forgive you for thrashing him.”
</p><p>They were still sitting at the table discussing the matter, when Anice,
who sat opposite a window, rose from her seat, and crossing the room to
it, drew aside the curtain and looked out.
</p><p>“There was somebody there,” she said, in answer to the questioning in
the faces of her companions. “There was a face pressed close against the
glass for a minute, and I am sure it was Jud Bates.”
</p><p>Derrick sprang from his chair. To his mind, it did not appear at all
unlikely that Jud Bates had mischief in hand. There were apples enough
in the Rectory garden to be a sore trial to youthful virtue.
</p><p>He opened the door and stepped into the night, and in a short time
a sharp familiar yelp fell upon the ears of the listeners. Almost
immediately after, Derrick returned, holding the trespasser by the arm.
</p><p>It was Jud Bates, but he did not look exactly like a convicted culprit,
though his appearance was disordered enough. He was pale and out of
breath, he had no cap on, and he was holding Nib, panting and excited,
in his arms.
</p><p>“Jud,” exclaimed Anice, “what have you been doing? Why did you come to
the window?”
</p><p>Jud drew Nib closer, and turned, if possible, a trifle paler.
</p><p>“I coom,” he said, tremulously, “to look in.”
</p><p>Nobody smiled.
</p><p>“To look in?” said Anice. “Why, whom did you want to see?”
</p><p>Jud jerked his elbow at Derrick.
</p><p>“It was <u>him</u>” he answered. “I wanted to see if he had gone home yet.”
</p><p>“But why?” she asked again.
</p><p>He shuffled his feet uneasily and his eyes fell. He looked down at Nib's
head and faltered.
</p><p>“I--” he said. “I wanted to stop him. I--I dunnot know----” And then the
rest came in a burst. “He munnot go,” he cried, trembling afresh. “He
mun keep away fro' th' Knoll Road.”
</p><p>The party exchanged glances.
</p><p>“There is mischief in hand,” said Mr. Barholm; “that is plain enough.”
</p><p>“<u>He</u> munnot go,” persisted Jud; “<u>he</u> mun keep away fro' th' Knoll
Road. I'm gettin' myself i' trouble,” he added, the indifference of
despair in his pale face. “If I'm fun out they'll mill me.”
</p><p>Derrick stepped aside into the hall and returned with his hat in his
hand. He looked roused and determined.
</p><p>“There are two or three stout colliers in Riggan who are my friends, I
think,” he said, “and I am going to ask them to face the Knoll Road
with me. I should like to settle this matter to-night. If I give these
fellows the chance to attack me, they will be the more easily disposed
of. A few years in jail might have a salutary effect upon Lowrie.”
</p><p>In his momentary heat, he forgot all but the strife into which he was
forced. He did not question Jud closely. He knew Riggan and the mining
districts too well not to have a clear enough idea of what means of
vengeance would be employed.
</p><p>But when he got out into the night he had not gone many yards before
a new thought flashed upon him, and quickened his pulse. It was not a
pleasant thought because it checked him, and he was in a mood to feel
impatient of a check. But he could not throw it off. There arose within
his mind a picture of a silent room in a cottage,--of a girl sitting by
the hearth. He seemed to see quite clearly the bent head, the handsome
face, the sad eyes. He had a fancy that Liz was not with her to-night,
that the silence of the room was only broken by the soft breathing of
the child upon Joan's knee.
</p><p>He stopped with an impatient gesture.
</p><p>“What was I thinking of?” he demanded of himself, “to have forgotten
<u>her</u>, and what my madness would bring upon her? I am a selfish fool!
Let it go. I will give it up. I will stay in Riggan for the future--it
will not be long, and she need torture herself no more. I will give it
up. Let them think I am afraid to face him. I am afraid--afraid to wound
the woman I--yes--the woman I <u>love</u>.”
