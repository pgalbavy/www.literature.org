<P>
The great room was dimly enough lit, for the windows looking out
upon the street were high and heavily curtained, The man who sat
at the desk was almost in the shadow.  Yet every now and then a
shaft of sunlight fell across his pale, worn face.  A strange
combination this of the worker, the idealist, the man of affairs.
&gt;From outside came the hum of a great city.  At times, too, there
came to his ears as he sat here the roar of nations at strife,
the fierce underneath battle of the great countries of the world
struggling for supremacy.  And here at this cabinet this man sat
often, and listened, strenuous, romantic, with the heart of a lion
and the lofty imagination of an eagle, he steered unswervingly on
to her destiny a great people.  Others might rest, hut never he.
<P>
He looked up from the letter spread out before him.  Lucille was
seated at his command, a few yards away.  Mr. Sabin stood
respectfully before him.
<P>
"Monsieur le Duc," he said, "this letter, penned by my illustrious
father to you, is sufficient to secure my good offices.  In what
manner can I serve you?"
<P>
"Your Majesty," Mr. Sabin answered, "in the first place by
receiving me here.  In the second by allowing me to lay before
you certain grave and very serious charges against the Order of
the Yellow Crayon, of which your Majesty is the titular head."
<P>
"The Order of the Yellow Crayon," the Emperor said thoughtfully,
"is society composed of aristocrats pledged to resist the march of
socialism.  It is true that I am the titular head of this
organisation.  What have you to say about it?"
<P>
"Only that your Majesty has been wholly deceived," Mr. Sabin said
respectfully, "concerning the methods and the working of this
society.  Its inception and inauguration were above reproach.  I
myself at once became a member.  My wife, Countess of Radantz, and
sole representative of that ancient family, has been one all her
life."
<P>
The Emperor inclined his head towards Lucille.
<P>
"I see no reason," he said, "when our capitals are riddled with
secret societies, all banded together against us, why the great
families of Europe should not in their turn come together and
display a united front against this common enemy.  The Order of
the Yellow Crayon has had more than my support.  It has had the
sanction of my name.  Tell me what you have against it."
<P>
"I have grave things to say concerning it," Mr. Sahin answered,
"and concerning those who have wilfully deceived your Majesty.
The influences to be wielded by the society were mainly, I believe,
wealth, education, and influence.  There was no mention made of
murder, of an underground alliance with the 'gamins' of Paris, the
dregs of humanity, prisoners, men skilled in the art of secret
death."
<P>
The Emperor's tone was stern, almost harsh.
<P>
"Duc de Souspennier, what are these things which you are saying?"
he asked.
<P>
"Your Majesty, I speak the truth," Mr. Sabin answered firmly.
"There are in the Order of the Yellow Crayon three degrees of
membership.  The first, which alone your Majesty knows of, simply
corresponds with what in England is known as the Primrose League.
The second knows that beneath is another organisation pledged to
frustrate the advance of socialism, if necessary by the use of
their own weapons.  The third, whose meetings and signs and whose
whole organisation is carried on secretly, is allied in every
capital in Europe with criminals and murderers.  With its great
wealth it has influence in America as well as in every city of
the world where there are police to be suborned, or desperate men
to be bought for tools.  At the direction of this third order
Lavinski died suddenly in the Hungarian House of Parliament, Herr
Krettingen was involved in a duel, the result of which was assured
beforehand, and Reginald Brott, the great English statesman, was
ruined and disgraced.  I myself have just narrowly escaped death
at his hands, and in my place my servant has been driven to death.
Of all these things, your Majesty, I have brought proofs."
<P>
The Emperor's face was like a carven image, but his tone was cold
and terrible.
<P>
"If these things have been sanctioned," he said, "by those who are
responsible for my having become the head of the Order; they shall
feel my vengeance."
<P>
"Your Majesty," Mr. Sabin said earnestly, "a chance disclosure, and
all might come to light.  I myself could blazon the story through
Europe.  Those who are responsible for the third degree of the Order
of the Yellow Crayon, and for your Majesty's ignorance concerning
its existence, have trifled with the destiny of the greatest
sovereign of modern times."
<P>
"The Prince of Saxe Leinitzer," the Emperor said, "is the acting
head of the Order."
<P>
"The Prince of Saxe Leinitzer," Mr. Sabin said firmly, "is
responsible for the existence of the third degree.  It is he who
has connected the society with a system of corrupt police or
desperate criminals in every great city.  It is the Prince of Saxe
Leinitzer, your Majesty, and his horde of murderers from whom I
have come to seek your Majesty's protection.  I have yet another
charge to make against him.  He has made, and is making still, use
of the society to further his own private intrigues.  In the name
of the Order he brought my wife from America.  She faithfully
carried out the instructions of the Council.  She brought about
the ruin of Reginald Brott.  By the rules of the society she was
free then to return to her home.  The Prince, who had been her
suitor, declined to let her go.  My life was attempted.  The story
of the Prince's treason is here, with the necessary proofs.  I
know that orders have been given to the hired murderers of the
society for my assassination.  My life even here is probably an
uncertain thing.  But I have told your Majesty the truth, and the
papers which I have brought with me contain proof of my words."
<P>
The Emperor struck a bell and gave a few orders to the young officer
who immediately answered it.  Then he turned again to Mr. Sabin.
<P>
"I have summoned Saxe Leinitzer to Berlin," he said.  "These matters
shall be gone into most thoroughly.  In the meantime what can I do
for you?"
<P>
"We will await the coming of the Prince," Mr. Sabin answered grimly.
<P>

Lady Carey passed from her bath-room into a luxurious little
dressing-room.  Her letters and coffee were on a small table near
the fire, an easy-chair was drawn up to the hearthrug.  She fastened
the girdle of her dressing-gown, and dismissed her maid.
<P>
"I will ring for you in half an hour, Annette," she said.  "See that
I am not disturbed."
<P>
On her way to the fireplace she paused for a moment in front of a
tall looking-glass, and looked steadily at her own reflection.
<P>
"I suppose," she murmured to herself, "that I am looking at my best
now.  I slept well last night, and a bath gives one colour, and
white is so becoming.  Still, I don't know why I failed.  She may
be a little better looking, but my figure is as good.  I can talk
better, I have learnt how to keep a man from feeling dull, and there
is my reputation.  Because I played at war correspondence, wore a
man's clothes, and didn't shriek when I was under fire, people have
chosen to make a heroine of me.  That should have counted for
something with him - and it didn't.  I could have taken my choice
of any man in London - and I wanted him.  And I have failed!" 
<P>
She threw herself back in her easy-chair and laughed softly.
<P>
"Failed!  What an ugly word!  He is old, and he limps, and I - well,
I was never a very bashful person.  He was beautifully polite, but
he wouldn't have anything to say to me."
<P>
She began to tear open her letters savagely.
<P>
"Well, it is over.  If ever anybody speaks to me about it I think
that I shall kill them.  That fool Saxe Leinitzer will stroke his
beastly moustache, and smile at me out of the corners of his eyes.
The Dorset woman, too - bah, I shall go away.  What is it, Annette?"
<P>
"His Highness the Prince of Saxe Leinitzer has called, milady."
<P>
"Called!  Does he regard this as a call?" she exclaimed, glancing
towards the clock.  "Tell him, Annette, that your mistress does not
receive at such an hour.  Be quick, child.  Of course I know that
he gave you a sovereign to persuade me that it was important, but I
won't see him, so be off."
<P>
"But yes, milady," Annette answered, and disappeared.
<P>
Lady Carey sipped her coffee.
<P>
"I think," she said reflectively, "that it must be Melton."
<P>
Annette reappeared.
<P>
"Milady," she exclaimed, "His Highness insisted upon my bringing
you this card.  He was so strange in his manner, milady, that I
thought it best to obey."
<P>
Lady Carey stretched out her hand.  A few words were scribbled on
the back of his visiting card in yellow crayon.  She glanced at it,
tore the card up, and threw the pieces into the fire.
<P>
"My shoes and stockings, Annette," she said, "and just a morning
wrap - anything will do."
<P>
The Prince was walking restlessly up and down the room, when Lady
Carey entered.  He welcomed her with a little cry of relief.
<P>
"Heavens!"  he exclaimed.  "I thought that you were never coming."
<P>
"I was in no hurry," she answered calmly.  "I could guess your news,
so I had not even the spur of curiosity."
<P>
He stopped short.
<P>
"You have heard nothing!  It is not possible?"
<P>
She shrugged her shoulders.
<P>
"No, but I know you, and I know him.  I am quite prepared to hear
that you are outwitted.  Indeed, to judge from your appearance
there can be no doubt about it.  Remember I warned you."
<P>
The Prince was pale with fury.
<P>
"No one could foresee this," he exclaimed.  "He has walked into the
lion's den."
<P>
"Then," Lady Carey said, "I am quite prepared to hear that he tamed
the lion."
<P>
"If there was one person living whom I could have sworn that this
man dared not visit, it was our Emperor," the Prince said.  "It is
only a few years since, through this man's intrigues, Germany was
shamed before the world."
<P>
"And yet," Lady Carey said sweetly, "the Emperor has received him."
<P>
"I have private intelligence from Berlin," Saxe Leinitzer answered.
"Mr. Sabin was in possession of a letter written to him by the
Emperor Frederick, thanking him for some service or other; and the
letter was a talisman."
<P>
"How like him," Lady Carey murmured, "to have the letter."
<P>
"What a pity," the Prince sneered, "that such devotion should remain
unrewarded."
<P>
Lady Carey sighed.
<P>
"He has broken my heart," she replied.
<P>
The Prince threw out his hands.
<P>
"You and I," he cried, "why do we behave like children!  Let us
start afresh.  Listen!  The Emperor has summoned me to Berlin."
<P>
"Dear me," Lady Carey murmured.  "I am afraid you will have a most
unpleasant visit."
<P>
"I dare not go," the Prince said slowly.  "It was I who induced
the Emperor to become the titular head of this cursed Order.  Of
course he knew nothing about the second or third degree members and
our methods.  Without doubt he is fully informed now.  I dare not
face him."
<P>
"What shall you do?" Lady Carey asked curiously.
<P>
"I am off to South America," he said.  "It is a great undeveloped
country, and there is room for us to move there.  Muriel, you know
what I want of you."
<P>
"My good man," she answered, "I haven't the faintest idea."
<P>
"You will come with me," he begged.  "You will not send me into
exile so lonely, a wanderer!  Together there may be a great future
before us.  You have ambition, you love intrigue, excitement, danger.
None of these can you find here.  You shall come with me.  You shall
not say no.  Have I not been your devoted slave?  Have - "
<P>
She stopped him.  Her lips were parted in a smile of good-natured
scorn.
<P>
"Don't be absurd, Saxe Leinitzer.  It is true that I love intrigue,
excitement and danger.  That is what made me join your Order, and
really I have had quite a little excitement out of it, for which
I suppose I ought to thank you.  But as for the rest, why, you are
talking rubbish.  I would go to South America to-morrow with the
right man, but with you, why, it won't bear talking about.  It makes
me angry to think that you should believe me capable of such shocking
taste as to dream of going away with you."
<P>
He flung himself from the room.  Lady Carey went back to her coffee
and letters.  She sent for Annette.
<P>
"Annette," she directed, "we shall go to Melton to-morrow.  Wire
Haggis to have the Lodge in order, and carriages to meet the midday
train.  I daresay I shall take a few people down with me.  Let
George go around to Tattershalls at once and make an appointment
for me there at three o'clock this afternoon.  Look out my habits
and boots, too, Annette."
<P>
Lady Carey leaned back in her chair for a moment with half-closed
eyes.
<P>
"I think," she murmured, "that some of us in our youth must have
drunk from some poisoned cup, something which turned our blood into
quicksilver.  I must live, or I must die.  I must have excitement
every hour, every second, or break down.  There are others too
 - many others.  No wonder that that idiot of a man in Harley
Street talked to me gravely about my heart.  No excitement.  A
quiet life!  Bah!  Such wishy-washy coffee and only one cigarette."
<P>
She lit it and stood up on the hearthrug.  Her eyes were half
closed, every vestige of colour had left her cheeks, her hand was
pressed hard to her side.  For a few minutes she seemed to struggle
for breath.  Then with a little lurch as though still giddy, she
stooped, and picking up her fallen cigarette, thrust it defiantly
between her teeth.
<P>
"Not this way," she muttered.  "From a horse's back if I can with
the air rushing by, and the hot joy of it in one's heart ... Only
I hope it won't hurt the poor old gee ... Come in, Annette.  What
a time you've been, child.
<P>
***'**
<P>
The Emperor sent for Mr. Sabin.  He declined to recognise his
incognito.
<P>
"Monsieur le Duc," he said, "if proof of your story were needed
it is here.  The Prince of Saxe Leinitzer has ignored my summons.
He has fled to South America."
<P>
Mr. Sabin bowed.
<P>
"A most interesting country," he murmured, "for the Prince."
<P>
"You yourself are free to go when and where you will.  You need no
longer have any fears.  The Order does not exist.  I have crushed it."
<P>
Mr. Sabin bowed.
<P>
"Your Majesty," he said, "has shown exemplary wisdom."
<P>
"From its inception," the Emperor said, "I believe that the idea was
a mistaken one.  I must confess that its originality pleased me; my
calmer reflections, however, show me that I was wrong.  It is not
for the nobles of the earth to copy the methods of socialists and
anarchists.  These men are a pest upon humanity, but they may have
their good uses.  They may help us to govern alertly, vigorously,
always with our eyes and ears strained to catch the signs of the
changing times.  Monsieur le Duc, should you decide to take up your
residence in this country I shall at all times be glad to receive
you.  But your future is entirely your own."
<P>
Mr. Sabin accepted his dismissal from audience, and went back to
Lucille.
<P>
"The Prince," he told her, "has gone-to South America.  The Order
does not exist any longer.  Will you dine in Vienna, or in
Frankfort?"
<P>
She held out her arms.
<P>
"You wonderful man!"  she cried.
