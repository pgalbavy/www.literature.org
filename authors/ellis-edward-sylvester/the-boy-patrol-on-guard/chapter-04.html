<p>Uncle Elk turned around and stepped off with a moderate but firm
tread, using his staff more for pleasure than from necessity.
He did not look around, taking it for granted that his young friend
was at his heels. The ground was so high that the carpet of leaves
and moss was dry, with so little undergrowth that walking was
as easy and pleasant as upon an oriental rug in one’s parlor.</p>

<p>The two tramped silently for a half mile or more, and Mike was
peering ahead among the shaggy tree columns, wondering how much
farther they had to go, when the guide halted, turned and in his
gentle voice said:</p>

<p>"Well, here we are, Michael, at last."</p>

<p>They stood on the margin of a natural clearing of upward of an
acre in extent, every square foot of which was under fine cultivation.
Corn, potatoes, various kinds of vegetables and fruits grew under
the training of a master hand. The soft ripple of a rivulet of
clear, icy water was heard from the other side of the clearing,
and was an unfailing source of supply during a drought.</p>

<p>Rather curiously, however, there was not a horse, cow, dog, cat,
pig, chicken or any kind of domestic animal on the premises. Uncle
Elk had never owned anything of the kind. Such supplies as he
had to have were brought in his catboat from one of the near-by
towns to a point on the Sheepscott, where he landed and carried
them overland to his home.</p>

<p>In the center of the open space stood a log cabin, some twenty
feet square and a single story in height. It was strongly made,
with the crevices filled with moss and clay and had a stone chimney
running up on the outside. The butts of the lower logs were a
foot or more in diameter, and the whole structure showed a compactness,
neatness and a certain artistic taste that pleased the eye at
the first glance. It was self-evident that some parts of the labor
were beyond the ability of a single man unless he were endowed
with the strength of a Samson. It may be added that Uncle Elk
received the help of several sturdy friends who were glad to do
any favor possible for him.</p>

<p>The man paused on the edge of the clearing only long enough to
give Mike a general view of the picture, when he led the way over
the short, well-marked path to the single door that served as
an entrance. It was of solid oaken slabs, from which a latchstring
dangled, as a perpetual invitation to whoever chose to enter and
find himself at home. At the front as well as the back, two small
windows, each with four square panes, served to admit light.</p>

<p>If Mike Murphy was surprised by his first sight of the humble
dwelling and grounds, he was amazed when he stepped across the
threshold. The floor was of smooth planking, without carpet or
rugs, but as clean as the kitchen of one of the <em>vrouws</em>
of old Amsterdam. The broad fireplace held a crane from whose
gallows-like arm was suspended a kettle, while a poker and pair
of tongs leaned at one side. On a shelf to the right of the fireplace
inclined a number of blue-tinted dishes besides various cooking
utensils. From the wooden staples driven into the logs over the
hearth hung a long-barreled percussion rifle, with powder flask
and several other articles near. Three chairs, one with rockers,
strongly made and evidently of home manufacture, sat promiscuously
around the room, while a table or large stand of circular form
stood in the middle of the apartment and a number of fishing poles
with lines winding spirally around them leaned in one corner.</p>

<p>Perhaps the strangest feature of this lonely home was what may
be called its library. Three shelves of unpainted wood stood against
the wall, facing the door, and each shelf was compactly filled
with well-bound books, and on the top rested a dozen magazines
and papers. Nearly all the volumes were of a classical, scientific
or theological character, the names of the authors being wholly
unfamiliar to the visitor.</p>

<p>When Mike had become somewhat acquainted with the curious interior,
he walked across the room and halted in front of the books, not
to learn their titles, but to read a printed slip tacked into
the wood. And this is what so impressed him that he committed
the sentences to memory:</p>

<p>
The Fourteen Errors of Life

</p>
<p>
To attempt to set up our own standard of right and wrong and<br/>
expect everybody to conform to it.

</p>
<p>
To try to measure the enjoyment of others by our own.

</p>
<p>
To expect uniformity of opinion in this world.

</p>
<p>
To look for judgment and experience in youth.

</p>
<p>
To endeavor to mould all dispositions alike.

</p>
<p>
Not to yield in unimportant trifles.

</p>
<p>
To look for perfection in our own actions.

</p>
<p>
To worry ourselves and others about what cannot be remedied.

</p>
<p>
Not to alleviate if we can all that needs alleviation.

</p>
<p>
Not to make allowances for the weaknesses of others.

</p>
<p>
To consider anything impossible that we cannot ourselves<br/>
perform.

</p>
<p>
To believe only what our finite minds can grasp.

</p>
<p>
To live as if the moment, the time, the day were so important<br/>
that it would live forever.

</p>
<p>
To estimate people by some outside quality, for it is that<br/>
within which makes the man.

</p>

<p>There were two apartments of about the same size. The second
was the bedroom. It had a looped curtain in the doorway and was
provided with two of the small windows referred to. It was clear
that Elkanah Sisum was a person of taste and education, who, as
he said, had taken up his abode in the wilderness, not because
he was soured against his fellow men, but on account of some crushing
grief that had fallen upon him long years before. His words and
what he had done proved his warm regard for boys, and, hermit
though he undoubtedly was, his nature was as sweet as that of
a devoted mother.</p>

<p>I have been thus particular in my reference to him, because through
one of the strange freaks of fate his fortunes became involved
with those of the Boy Patrols and others, and resulted in a remarkable
drama which can never be forgotten by those who took part therein.</p>

<p>Mike had removed his hat upon entering the dwelling, and as he
now faced the old man, who was watching him, the youth made the
Boy Scout salute.</p>

<p>"I would utter me admiration, Uncle Elk, but in truth I’m that
plaised that I’m unable to spake a single word."</p>

<p>"A neatly turned compliment; suppose now I start the fire and
we have supper."</p>

<p>"Show me some way by the which I can offer ye a little help."</p>

<p>"There is none unless you choose to bring me a pail of water
from the brook beyond."</p>

<p>"I’ll bring ye a barrelful if ye wish it," replied the pleased
Mike, accepting the empty tin pail, which sat on the floor beside
the door. He strode along the path to the small stream of sparkling
cold water, in which was a cavity deep enough to make a dipper
or cup unnecessary. When he returned, Uncle Elk had the fire blazing
on the broad hearth.</p>

<p>In a brief while the meal was placed upon the table and the two
sat down. The food consisted of slices of crisp, fried bacon,
coarse brown bread, clear, amber coffee with sugar and condensed
milk. Mike could not have asked for anything better and praised
the culinary skill of his host.</p>

<p>The old gentleman did not use tobacco, and after the dishes had
been cleared away, the guest helping, the two seated themselves
in front of the fire, for the night air was crisp enough to make
the slight additional warmth pleasant. Although the cabin was
provided with a kerosene lamp it was not lighted. The mellow illumination
from the blaze on the hearth filled the room and showed each one
the face of the other, as they talked of the Boy Patrols.</p>

<p>The hermit gently swayed back and forth for a few inches, as
he looked into the embers or the countenance of his young friend,
who was keenly interested in everything that was told him. Mike
had an excellent memory, and aware of the importance of the instruction
he received, treasured every word that was said, asking a question
now and then when the meaning was not clear. His teacher drilled
him patiently, and when necessary to illustrate some of the points,
stirred the glowing logs which sent up myriads of sparks and leaned
forward in the yellow glow.</p>

<p>Now, instead of putting down everything, I shall adopt the plan
of Uncle Elk, who, when he had impressed upon the lad all that
he could clearly remember, said:</p>

<p>"I shall ask you no questions to-night, but give you your examination
to-morrow morning after breakfast, when you are ready to start
for Gosling Lake. All the knowledge you then possess you will
carry with you. It will crystallize while you sleep."</p>

<p>"And the same would have been true wid me barring I niver had
the knowledge to crystallize during me dreams."</p>

<p>With his fine-grained courtesy, the host insisted upon giving
up his bed to Mike, who of course refused the favor, declaring
that before consenting to such foolishness he would sleep in the
woods with the risk of being devoured by elephants and tigers.
So a compromise was effected by which the lad slumbered soundly
upon a blanket spread on the floor.</p>

<p>Thus it came about after the morning’s meal—in which flapjacks
took the place of bread—Uncle Elk put his pupil "through his paces."
Here is a condensation of the questions and answers:</p>

<p>"What are the twelve points of the scout law?"</p>

<p>"To be trustworthy, loyal, friendly, helpful, courteous, kind,
obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent."</p>

<p>"Of what does a Patrol consist?"</p>

<p>"Of eight boys, all more than twelve years old, one of whom is
patrol leader and another corporal."</p>

<p>"What is a troop?"</p>

<p>"Three or more patrols, whose leader is Scout Master; he must
be at least twenty-one years old and the assistant Scout Master
cannot be under eighteen years of age."</p>

<p>"It isn’t necessary to go further into the details of the organization,
as it would confuse you. What is the Boy Scout motto?"</p>

<p>"<em>Be Prepared.</em>"</p>

<p>"Pretty comprehensive counsel; suppose you give something in
the way of explanation."</p>

<p>"He must be prepared in mind by learning obedience and by thinking
out beforehand what should be done in case of any accident or
situation, and in body by making himself healthful, strong and
active."</p>

<p>"It will be time enough to learn the various badges when you
are ready for them. That of the tenderfoot is of gilt and seven-eighths
of an inch wide, and it is made for the button hole or with a
safety pin clasp. Now reverently repeat the scout oath:</p>

<p>"On me honor I will do me bist:</p>

<p>"1. To do me dooty to God and me country, and to obey the scout
laws;</p>

<p>"2. To hilp ither people at all times;</p>

<p>"3. To kaap mesilf physically strong, mentally awake and morally
straight."</p>

<p>"Give the scout sign and salute."</p>

<p>(These have been described. The sign is merely holding up the
three fingers in position, while the salute requires that the
fingers shall be raised to the forehead.)</p>

<p>"You glibly rolled off the twelve points of the scout law, but
their meaning should sink deep into the understanding. We all
admit that it is our duty to be helpful to others, but we neglect
such duty shamefully. I have often reflected that if certain rigid
rules were laid down much more would be accomplished. What is
the wise provision of the Boy Scouts?"</p>

<p>"That aich must do at least one good turn every day to somebody."</p>

<p>"What little trick do many of the Boy Scouts adopt to keep this
duty in mind?"</p>

<p>"They lave the ends of their nickties hangin’ outside till the
good turn is done, though I’m thinking," added Mike with a grin,
"that it would be as well to tie a string round his finger; that’s
what me mither used to do wid me."</p>

<p>"How did it work?" asked Uncle Elk, yielding to the diversion.</p>

<p>"I can’t say it was a succiss," replied Mike with a sigh; "me
good mither tied the cord so tight that it hurt that much I furgot
what it was there fur; so me wise mither adopted a better plan."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"She ixplained the matter to me dad and he——"</p>

<p>Mike with a grin pointed at his buckthorn which leaned against
the wall.</p>

<p>"I understand, and now what of being courteous?"</p>

<p>"The Boy Scout must show courtesy to ivery one, espicially women,
childer, old people, the waak and hilpless and he must accipt
no tip or pay for such services."</p>

<p>"What are the different classes of Boy Scouts of America?"</p>

<p>"They are the tenderfut, second-class scout and first-class scout."</p>

<p>"For the present your interest lies in the tenderfoot or lowest
grade, which is the first step and in which grade you must serve
at least a month before you can advance to the next. You have
given the scout law, the sign and salute, and may now tell me
something about our national flag. How old is it?"</p>

<p>"It was born in June, 1777, and was first flung to the breeze
at the battle of Germantown, in Siptimber of that year. A star
is added in the blue field on the Fourth of July, nixt after a
new State comes into the Union. ’Tis fur this raison that the
flag now has forty-eight stars."</p>

<p>"What about the stripes?"</p>

<p>"They be niver changed; all the same, at the first off the government
added two stripes whin Kaintucky and Vermont were admitted, but
they were taken off in 1818."</p>

<p>"I think that will be news to a good many of the Boy Scouts,"
commented Uncle Elk. "For an Irish lad who never set foot in America
until last year, you can put more than one of our youths to shame."</p>

<p>Mike rose, bowed and made the Boy Scout salute, his red face
as grave as that of a deacon during service.</p>

<p>"Axcoose me blushes, Uncle Elk."</p>

<p>"I am unable to see that you are blushing, since your face could
not be any redder than it seems always to be," said the old gentleman
with a twinkle of his bright eyes.</p>

<p>"I am thrying me bist; angels could do no more, as Jim O’Brien
remarked whin he agraad to lick five men in five minutes and aich
one got the bist of him."</p>

<p>"Now, Michael, as to showing respect for the flag: what can you
tell me of raising and lowering it?"</p>

<p>"It should be h’isted before sunrise and not be left aloft after
sunset."</p>

<p>"What is the rule for ‘retreat’ at sunset?"</p>

<p>"Civilian spectators must stand at attintion and uncover while
the band plays ‘The Star Spangled Banner’; military spectators
must stand at attintion and give the army salute."</p>

<p>"When the national colors are passing on parade or in review?"</p>

<p>"The spectators if walking should halt, and, if sitting rise,
uncover and stand at attintion."</p>

<p>"You know that a flag is flown at half-mast as a sign of mourning:
what should be done at the close of the funeral?"</p>

<p>"The flag should be hoisted to full staff."</p>

<p>"How should a flag be placed at half-mast?"</p>

<p>"It should be hoisted first to the top of the staff and then
lowered to position, and before lowering from half-staff, it should
be first lifted to the top."</p>

<p>"We have a beautiful custom of observing Memorial Day on May
30 each year. What is the law for displaying the flag throughout
that day?"</p>

<p>"The same should fly at half-mast from sunrise to noon, and at
full staff from noon till sunset."</p>

<p>"I repeat ‘Well done!’ All that now remains is for you to show
your skill in tying at least four out of eight knots known as
square or reef, sheet-bend, bowline, weaver’s or fisherman’s,
sheepshank, halter, clove hitch, timber hitch or two half hitches.
When I was a boy we called a few of these by different names.
You have told me that some of the seamen on the steamer showed
you how several knots are tied. So I think you will find no difficulty
in meeting the requirements in this respect. Let us begin."</p>

<p>Uncle Elk brought forward several coils of small rope and handed
them to Mike, who grinningly set to work. He was absorbed for
less than half an hour, when he leaned back and looked into the
kindly face.</p>

<p>"Fetch on what is lift, as me grandfather said whin he finished
the last of half a bushel of praties."</p>

<p>"There is none left; you have tied every one; you’ll pass, young
man."</p>

<p>Every one knows how to tie a few simple knots, but I am sure
you would like to learn the method of tying the more complicated
ones. They are very useful and are easily learned, but I do not
think I can make my explanations clear by means of description
alone. Mr. Samuel A. Moffat, Field Commissioner of the Boy Scouts
of America, in their official handbook illustrates these various
knots and has kindly given me permission to use the same, so to
Mr. Moffat belongs the credit of what follows in the next chapter. </p>
