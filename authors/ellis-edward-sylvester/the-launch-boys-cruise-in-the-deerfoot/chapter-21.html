<p>You will remember that Mike Murphy, the Irish laddie, was brimful
of pluck, powerful and sturdy of build and with little in the
nature of fear in his make-up. His short legs, however, were not
meant for fleetness, and he never would have won fame as a sprinter.
When he parted company with Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes, only
one purpose controlled him&mdash;that was to regain possession of the
stolen motor boat <em>Deerfoot</em> and incidentally to administer
proper punishment to the thieves who had so boldly stolen the
craft.</p>

<p>He loped down the road, until he was panting from the exertion,
when he dropped to a rapid walk, still burning with high resolve.
With no clearly defined plan in mind, he turned off at the intersection
of the highways, and soon reached Charmount, one of the regular
landings where the little steamers for Boothbay Harbor halted
to let off and take on passengers.</p>

<p>"The right thing for mesilf to do is to sind a tilegram," was
his conclusion. "I don't mind that I ever done anything ov the
kind excipt to forward one by wireless when our steamer was in
the middle of the Atlantic. Howsumiver, that was sint by other
folks and I hadn't anything to do wid it excipt to listen to the
crackling and spitting and sparkling of the machine and to watch
for the message flying out the windy, which the same I didn't
observe."</p>

<p>His naturally red face was redder than usual, and he breathed
fast, when he stepped up to the little window.</p>

<p>"I have a message that I wish to go over the wires as fast as
lightning," was his announcement, after raising his cap and saluting
the young lady.</p>

<p>"That's the way all telegrams go," she replied, looking smilingly
up from her chair in front of the instrument.</p>

<p>"Thank ye kindly."</p>

<p>"All you have to do is to write it out and pay the cost."</p>

<p>"And how much will the same be?"</p>

<p>"That depends on the number of words and the distance it has
to be sent. Write it out."</p>

<p>A pile of yellow blanks lay on the inclined planed board which
served as a desk, and there was a cheap pencil secured by a string,
but no chair. A sender had to stand while writing his message.
Mike tried to act as if he was used to such things. First he thrust
the end of the pencil in his mouth to moisten the lead and began
his hard task.</p>

<p>He was so long at it that the bright young miss looked up several
times to see how he was getting on. Through the narrow window
she saw him laboring harder than he had ever labored in his life.
His tongue was out, his eyes rolling, his cap shoved back from
his perspiring forehead and he grunted, standing first on one
foot and then on the other, crossing out words, writing them over
again and scratching his head in sore perplexity. She made no
comment, but busied herself with other work until more than a
quarter of an hour had passed.</p>

<p>Finally the toil was over and he shoved the little sheet of paper
through the window.</p>

<p>"Whew! but that was a big job, as me uncle said when he tipped
over the house of Pat O'Keily. You'll excuse me bad penmanship,
if you plaise."</p>

<p>The operator took the paper from him and with wrinkled brow read
the following amazing effusion:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>CHARMOUNT, MAIN, </em>Orgust&#11834;

</p>
<p>
"<em>General George Washington,<br/>
President of the U. S. America</em>:

</p>
<p>
"<em>RESPICTED SIR AND BROTHER</em>:

</p>
<p>
"There has been the biggest outrage that has happened in a thousand<br/>
years. A pirut ship come up the Sheepscot River to-day and while me<br/>
and Captain Landon and Second Mate Haynes&mdash;it's mesilf that is<br/>
first mate&mdash;was eating our frugle repast behind the blockhouse, the<br/>
same piruts boarded our frigate the <em>Deerfut</em> and run off wid her.<br/>
If we had seen the thaives we would have knocked their heads off.<br/>
Send one of your torpeder distroyers or a battleship and go for the<br/>
piruts bald-headed.

</p>
<p>
"Kind regards to the missis and hoping you are well I subscribe<br/>
mesilf yours with great respict,

</p>
<p>
"<em>MIKE MURPHY</em>."

</p>

<p>The Irish youth watched the face of the miss as she studied the
message for several minutes. Mike had a fair education, and although
he limped in his spelling, on the whole he did well. By and by
the operator looked into his face with perplexity and asked:</p>

<p>"Why under the sun do you address your message to General Washington?"</p>

<p>"Isn't he Prisident of the United States? I remimber reading
the same in me school history at home in Tipperary."</p>

<p>"He was the first President, but that was a long time ago and
he has been dead more than a hundred years."</p>

<p>"Then he isn't in the City of Washington, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, he is in heaven, where you may be sure he has a front seat."</p>

<p>"You couldn't forward the same to him?" asked Mike, his eyes
twinkling.</p>

<p>"I am afraid not; that station isn't in our line, though I hope
you and I will arrive there one of these days."</p>

<p>She drew her pencil through the immortal name.</p>

<p>"You wish to have this sent to the President?"</p>

<p>"Av coorse; what might his name be?"</p>

<p>"William H. Taft."</p>

<p>"And his addriss is Washington?"</p>

<p>"That's his official address, but he stops there only now and
then each year."</p>

<p>"Where might he be now?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere out West or on the Pacific coast or down at Panama&mdash;in
fact, almost anywhere except at the capital of our country."</p>

<p>"Then can't he be raiched by telegraph?" asked Mike in dismay.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; all you have to do is to address your telegram to Washington,
just as you have done. They know there where to find him and your
message will be forwarded."</p>

<p>"Very well. There is the money to pay for the same."</p>

<p>Mike laid a silver quarter on the stand-up desk where she could
reach it. But she was busy just then counting the words by tipping
them off with the point of her pencil. When through she beamed
upon him and announced that the cost would be a little more than
five dollars.</p>

<p>"Woorah! woorah! what is it you're sayin'? All the funds I have
wid me is about half what you jist named."</p>

<p>"You can save three-fourths of the cost by striking out the unnecessary
words. Let me help you."</p>

<p>She obligingly edited the copy. It seemed to Mike that every
word was indispensable, but she convinced him to the contrary
and finally succeeded in boiling down the message so that the
cost of the transmission was reduced to a dollar and a half. Although,
as the lad had intimated, his funds were moderate, he paid the
sum and the miss lost no time in placing the telegram on the wire.</p>

<p>We have no record of its fate after reaching the national capital.
It may have started to find the President on his never ending
travels. If so, it no doubt caused him a hearty laugh, but I am
afraid he speedily forgot it and the money expended by Mike was
wasted.</p>

<p>He thanked the miss for her aid and bade her good-day. Just then
the hoarse whistle of a steamer fell upon their ears.</p>

<p>"Phwat's that?" asked Mike, stopping short and looking at her.
She glanced through the window before replying.</p>

<p>"It's the <em>Nahanada</em> on her way to Boothbay Harbor."</p>

<p>"Ain't that lucky now!" he exclaimed, hurrying to the landing
where he joined the half dozen passengers in boarding her.</p>

<p>The well-known steamer <em>Nahanada</em> was returning from an
excursion to Wiscasset, with a large party from Boothbay Harbor.
You will bear in mind that Mike Murphy's departure down the Sheepscot
from Charmount preceded that of his friends by more than an hour.</p>

<p>Now that he had time to rest and think, he did both. Like the
other two youths, he chose his seat on the upper deck at the extreme
rear, where he had a good view of both shores in descending the
Sheepscot. He was not in a mood for conversation, and though several
were seated near him, he gave them no attention. In this respect,
he had the advantage over his friends, who as you will recall
not only said a good many things to each other, but were overheard,
as they discovered too late, by the man dressed in gray, who mixed
strangely in their affairs afterward.</p>

<p>It was impossible that the steamer should overtake the motor
boat, provided the latter held her usual speed. Mike did not expect
anything of the kind, but, like Alvin and Chester, thought the
<em>Deerfoot</em> was likely to stop on its way and wait until
darkness in which to continue its flight. The thieves would know
that strenuous efforts would be made quickly to recover the launch,
and would try to escape recognition by the simple method named.</p>

<p>This was shrewd reasoning, and was justified by what followed.
A few miles below Sawyer Island, where Chester and Alvin left
the steamer, projects the southern end of Westport, which intrudes
like a vast wedge between the Sheepscot on the right and Montsweag
Bay and Knubble Bay on the left. The island is about a dozen miles
long, with a width at its broadest part of three miles or so.
Around the lower end sweeps Goose Rock Passage, through which
boats make their way to the Kennebec to the westward. The width
of the Sheepscot at that portion is nearly two miles. Mike Murphy
was on the alert and scanned the shores to the right and left
as well as every craft that suggested any resemblance to the <em>Deerfoot</em>,
but saw nothing to awaken hope until the <em>Nahanada</em> turned
to call at Isle of Springs.</p>

<p>Knowing nothing of interest was there, Mike rose to his feet
and scanned the opposite shore. He saw a boat disappearing in
a small bay, a little to the north of Brooks Point, as the southern
extremity of Westport is called. He caught only a passing glimpse
when the intervening land shut it from sight, but he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Begorrah! it's the <em>Deerfut</em>, or me name isn't Mike Murphy!"</p>
