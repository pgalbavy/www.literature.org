<p>"I think I dumped that Apache down there just as nicely as any
one could have done it," said Fred, as he sat upon the ground.
"It must have taken him by surprise when I banged into his back
that way. I'd like to know whether he fell on his head or feet.
He hadn't much time to get ready for the fall, and so maybe it
wasn't just as he wanted it. I don't think it was, either, with
Mickey or me. Such things ain't generally in this part of the
world. Maybe some of the others were standing around, and this
fellow went down on their heads. If he did, it must have shaken
all their dinners up. That's a pretty good way to fall down there,
and although I didn't get hurt much, I wouldn't want to try it
again."</p>

<p>Fred had had remarkable success, but there was a question as
to what he was going to do with it. He was on the outside of the
cavern, with the means at command for assisting Mickey to the
surface, but, the Indians being down below, it was not clear how
this was to be done, as they were likely to take a hand in the
matter.</p>

<p>As preliminary to any elaborate attempts in that direction, it
was necessary that he should apprise him of his presence, and
establish some sort of communication with him. This, under the
circumstances, was exceedingly difficult, as it was not likely
that the Irishman would suspect that his young friend had succeeded
in reaching the outside until he had received strong proof of
it. Very fortunately, however, the couple possessed a code of
signals which were easily understood, if they were only heard.</p>

<p>"I will try him on our old call," said Fred, as he crept as close
to the edge as he deemed safe, and emitted a whistle that must
have extended far within the cave.</p>

<p>"If he hears that, he will understand it," he added, turning
his ear, so that he could catch any response; but the dim, soothing
murmur of the cascade was the only sound that came up from the
cavernous depths.</p>

<p>"He must be there&mdash;he must be there, and he will come back, so
he will catch the signal sooner or later."</p>

<p>There was one aspect of the business which had not yet occurred
to Fred, and which was likely to inure to the benefit of Mickey
O'Rooney, the gentleman who just then stood in need of everything
that came along in that line. The Apaches were skillful and wise
enough to learn from the trail which had first told them the story,
that a boy and man had been caught in the cavern, and it was very
evident that they all believed that there was no other avenue
of escape except that by which they had entered. At the same time,
their knowledge of the peculiarities of their own country must
have convinced them that it was possible that other openings,
of which they knew nothing, might exist, and might become known
to the prisoners.</p>

<p>The last Indian who went down must have known that the lad who
assisted him was one of the parties for whom they were yearning,
and his presence was proof that he had made the fortunate discovery
which was denied the natives of the territory. If the lad had
emerged by that means into the outer world, the natural supposition
would be that his companion had done the same, and that, therefore,
neither of the fugitives were below, the inevitable conclusion
being that the tables had been completely turned upon them. Such
was certain to be the conclusion of the Apaches, and it remained
for Mickey O'Rooney to use ordinary prudence and keep himself
out of the way of the redskins, to secure a chance of further
outwitting them by a bold piece of generalship.</p>

<p>Fred repeated his whistle four or five times, with an interval
of ten minutes, when his hopes were raised to the highest pitch
by hearing it answered. In his excitement he thrust his head far
over the opening, gave the signal again to prevent mistakes, and
listened.</p>

<p>A full minute elapsed, when the reply came, sounding faint and
far away. It showed that Mickey was at a considerable distance
from the opening, and that he heard and understood the situation.
To make matters still more certain, the lad now shouted at the
top of his voice, holding both hands so as to inclose his mouth
like a tunnel.</p>

<p>"Mickey, I'm up here with a lasso! Nobody else is here! Whenever
you can get the chance, get hold of the lasso, and climb up! I
will let it down after a while!"</p>

<p>It cannot be said that this was a very wise proceeding upon the
part of the lad; for it was likely that some one of the half dozen
Apaches understood English well enough to comprehend what he said.
To clinch the business, Fred yelled a few more words.</p>

<p>"If you understand me, Mickey, whistle!"</p>

<p>The words were no more than fairly uttered when the desired response
was made, faintly, but, nevertheless, distinctly.</p>

<p>"That's good," concluded the delighted lad. "Now all I have to
do is to wait for him to get the chance, and he will come up the
lasso, and then we'll be done with the cave."</p>

<p>This, certainly, was all that he had to do, but, at the same
time, this amounted to a good deal.</p>

<p>"Now, if I let this rope down," added the lad, as he thought
the matter over, "one of those Apaches will try to climb up it,
and I will have to cut it, and that will leave it in his hands,
and then what will become of Mickey?"</p>

<p>He debated a long time as to the best plan of overcoming this
serious difficulty; but none presented itself, and he concluded
that it was an inevitable contingency, which he must prepare himself
to defeat, at all hazards.</p>

<p>Fred had been so absorbed with the business which had succeeded
admirably up to this hour, that he scarcely noted the passage
of time. He was not a little amazed when he came to look at the
sun and to note, from its position, that the afternoon was considerably
advanced, and that night was much nearer than he supposed. Nearly
twenty-four hours had elapsed since he had tasted food, and, although
he felt somewhat faint, he was not troubled with hunger. He made
up his mind to make no effort to obtain food until he should succeed
in bringing the Irishman from his prison&mdash;as he hoped to do before
the night should pass away. But he was thirsty, and, believing
that he could quench his thirst without going very far, and without
jeopardizing the safety of his friend, he started off on a little
hunt for water.</p>

<p>"That stream runs out of the cave not very far from here, and,
if I can find that, it will be just what I want."</p>

<p>Fixing in his mind the direction of the stream, he started off,
taking an almost opposite direction from that which led to the
ridge, where he had lain so long watching the movements of the
Apaches. This led him directly behind a mass of boulders and rocks,
tossed irregularly together, and surrounded by a peculiar growth
of stunted vegetation, with rich, succulent grass beyond.</p>

<p>Fred was hurrying along, with no thought of seeing anything unusual,
when he was startled by coming directly upon a half dozen mustangs,
all bound to the limbs or trunks of trees with strong lariats,
while they were lazily cropping the grass where they had been
left undisturbed for several hours. They were all fine-looking
animals, every one of them&mdash;not one having saddle or bridle, and
nothing, indeed, excepting the long thong, which, like the lasso,
was made of bull's hide, and which prevented them from straying
beyond their appointed limits. There could be no doubt that the
animals belonged to the little party taking an airing in the cave,
and the eyes of the lad sparkled as they rested upon them.</p>

<p>"Oh! if Mickey were only here!" he exclaimed to himself; "we
couldn't want anything nicer. We would just pick out two of the
best here, stampede the others, and then gallop toward home as
fast as we could, and we'd be there inside of two or three days;
but I must wait, and so must he."</p>

<p>The place selected by the Indians for their horses could not
have been better chosen. In addition to the rich pasture, a rivulet
of clear, cold water flowed by, within reach of each and all,
so that all their wants were supplied in the best manner possible.</p>

<p>Every one of the mustangs raised their heads and looked up at
the stranger, and one or two gave a faint whinney, as if to inquire
the business of such a character with them.</p>

<p>"I don't believe any of you can go like my Hurricane that I had
to leave at home; but I can't have him, and I would be mighty
glad to take one of you&mdash;that is, if Mickey could go along, for
I don't intend to leave him, so long as I know he's alive. You
seem pretty well fixed, so I'll let you alone till we get a chance
to turn you to account, and you can eat and get yourself in good
condition."</p>

<p>He took a good long draught of the refreshing water, and then
made a little survey of his surroundings.</p>

<p>"I should like to know whether those six Indians were all looking
for <em>me</em>. Maybe Lone Wolf has found out that I gave the
three the slip, and he sent a half-dozen fresh ones to look me
up. They were all strangers to me, and I am sure I never saw them
before. Lone Wolf seems to want me very bad, and if these don't
bring me back pretty soon, he may send somebody after them."</p>

<p>A careful survey of all the suspicious points failed to show
him anything alarming, and he made his way back to the mouth of
the cavern, where he sat down to await the moment for him to lower
the lasso that he hoped was to give Mickey O'Rooney a chance for
his life. It seemed to him that it would not be safe to attempt
it until the sun went down. His theory was that the Apaches would
not remain directly beneath the opening all the time, but that
there would be a chance for the Irishman to creep up without detection.
He would be looking for the lasso, and in the darkness might be
able to ascend it without discovery.</p>

<p>The lad hoped that all the redskins had reached the conclusion
that both he and the man were outside; and, finding that it was
out of the question for them to escape by the opening, which was
at such a distance over their heads, had scattered to search for
some other egress. It was not impossible that such was the case,
and if it were, it placed the situation in a light by no means
discouraging.</p>

<p>It was hardly dark when Fred Munson carefully shoved the end
of the rope over the edge of the opening, and let it descend slowly,
gently and noiselessly to the bottom, permitting it to pass through
his hands in such a way that he could tell the instant it was
disturbed. When he knew that it had struck, he waited for a "bite."</p>

<p>To his astonishment, it came within the next five minutes. He
was startled by feeling a decided pull repeated several times.</p>

<p>The situation was so delicately critical that it would not do
to speak nor whisper, nor even to utter their whistle, no matter
how cautiously made. So, by way of reply, Fred gave the lasso,
several responsive jerks, intended to signify that everything
was ready, and his friend might come ahead.</p>

<p>A moment later the lariat was jerked from his hand, showing that
a heavy weight had suddenly fastened upon it, and the man was
making his way upward from the cave.</p>
