<p>IN <em>WHICH THERE IS A FURTHER ACCOUNT OF THE SHAWNEES, THE
SPEAKERS, AND JENKINS</em>.</p>

<p><em>AFTER </em>receiving the summary reply of the commander of
the block-house, McGable arose, and without a word walked toward
the wood. Here he seemed to spend a short time in consultation
with the Indians; for they immediately after separated and disappeared
among the trees.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" asked Mansfield.</p>

<p>"They've drawn off, and will wait till night 'fore they try any
of their games," replied Peterson. "We ain't done with 'em yet."</p>

<p>Such seemed to be the impression of all the others who had had
any experience in Indian warfare. The Indians were too eager and
well-prepared to be satisfied with anything short of an attempt
to carry the block-house.</p>

<p>The night set in cold and stormy. The rain poured down in torrents,
and the wind hurled it rattling against the block-house. The air,
too, was of inky darkness, and the dismal sighing of the forest,
the dull, murmuring roar of the Ohio, made the scene gloomy enough
to the settlers. Had it not been for the incessant lightning,
the time could not have been more favorable for the assault of
the Indians. But the sharp, trembling streams of fire played constantly
overhead, lighting up the forest and clearing as if at noonday,
and the "near crashing of the thunderbolt" seemed to inspire the
timid with a sort of valor&mdash;a peculiar bravery that they were
strangers to at other times.</p>

<p>Dingle, Peterson, and the most experienced Indian-fighters never
removed from their stations at the loop-holes during the night.
The terrible storm that prevailed was of incalculable benefit
to the whites in another particular. It prevented their assailants
from using that most dreaded of all agencies&mdash;fire, in the assault.</p>

<p>The sentinels mentioned kept a continual watch from all sides
of the block-house upon the wood and clearing. They knew too well
that the continued silence of their enemies was more dangerous
than open demonstration. Some deep-laid plan was hatching which
was expected momently to develop itself.</p>

<p>Now and then a few syllables were exchanged between those within,
but these fragments of conversation only seemed to make the gloom
more impressive. No lights were burning, and none could see his
neighbor. The men had all been assigned stations by the commander,
which they did not offer to leave or exchange, while some of the
women and younger portion, overcome by watching and the confined
air, gave way to their drowsiness and slept feverishly and fitfully.</p>

<p>The hours between midnight and morning are the invariable ones
selected by the North American Indian for making his attack upon
his enemy. This strange being, so similar to the wild animal in
more than one respect, seems to have learned many a lesson from
him. Darkness, the stealthy approach and blow; the inevitable
yell and leap in death; the howl of rage and disappointment; the
chilling war-whoop; the persisting trailing of an enemy; the patient,
silent watch; the black passions of revenge; the reveling in blood;
all these are passions common to and a part of both.</p>

<p>It was at that hour, just beyond midnight, the most weird and
gloomy of all, when a sort of stupor or indifference had fallen
upon all except the most experienced, that Dingle gave the intelligence
of the Indians having been seen upon the clearing, in the rear
of the block-house. Almost at the same instant, Peterson added
that they were also upon the front. Their course of action was
now suspected at once; it was to attack the rear until the attention
was concentrated in this direction, when a rush would be made
upon the front, and an attempt to scale the palisades.</p>

<p>Every man was now upon the alert. The lightning, as if ordered
of Providence, inflamed more incessantly, and nearly every step
of the approaching savages could be seen. Some twenty were halting
just beneath the edge of the wood, and evidently waiting for a
moment of darkness in which to make a rush.</p>

<p>"H'yer they come!" said Peterson.</p>

<p>The same instant all saw them half way across the clearing, and
almost immediately a dozen spouts of flame flashed from as many
port-holes, and nearly half the Indians leaped wildly in the air
and rolled quivering to the ground. The others wavered for a moment,
and then scattered and took to the wood again.</p>

<p>"H'yer they am now, sartain!" called out Dingle.</p>

<p>The real attack was now attempted. Nearly the whole pack, yelling
like so many tigers, rushed forward, and came up against the palisades
like a hurricane. Here, as their heads appeared, by the aid of
the friendly lightning, they were shot down by the cool and deliberate
fire of the whites. The firing was as incessant as the lightning,
and told with frightful effect upon the assailants. But the Shawnees
are brave, when excited, and they maintained the assault most
determinedly. McGable was soon seen several times, and three of
the soldiers, as they afterward said, aimed nearly all of their
shots at him. But fate seemed to protect him.</p>

<p>As the darkness blazed forth with the living fire, the block-house
loomed forth, clear and defined, standing as it did, like a large,
dark, motionless animal brought at bay by his dogged pursuers,
and from whose hundred eyes the red bolts of destruction were
hurled incessantly and wrathfully.</p>

<p>The Shawnees continued their desperate attempts to scale the
palisades, growing more furious and revengeful at their repeated
failures. But the steady, continual fire of the whites made dreadful
slaughter, and they finally broke and fled in the wildest confusion
to the wood. The shots from the block-house continued as long
as a single Indian was visible.</p>

<p>"What do they now propose to do?" asked Mansfield.</p>

<p>"To git home 'bout as quick as their legs will let them."</p>

<p>"Good! Our success has been better than we could have hoped."</p>

<p>"Don't git excited now, 'cause it ain't noways sartin they've
left yet."</p>

<p>"It makes no difference whether they have or not; it is all the
same to us. We haven't lost a single man, while they have had
twenty killed. They can't make a more vigorous attack than this
last one, and they cannot possibly meet with a more complete repulse."</p>

<p>"I tell <em>you</em> that ef it hadn't been for the rain and
the lightning, we'd have found things considerably summat different.
In the first place, we wouldn't had the light to shoot by, and
in the next they would've had some chance to give us a taste of
what they had larned to do with fire."</p>

<p>"They've gone for home," said Dingle, decisively; "they won't
bother us again very soon."</p>

<p>So it proved. An hour or two later, it began to become gray and
misty in the east, the rain ceased falling, and gradually the
light of morning stole over the wood and settlement. As the day
broke, the scene was dismal and cheerless. The appearance of the
forest, after a cold storm of rain has passed over it, always
seems to wear its most disagreeable look. The dripping twigs,
the branches loaded overhead with water, every rustle of which
brings it down in torrents. The cold, sticky leaves, the wet,
shining bark of the trees, and the chilling wind that soughs through
the wood, all induce a feeling of desolation and dislike.</p>

<p>Such appeared the forest the morning after the attack. In the
clearing, the bare, charred stumps seemed blacker than usual,
and the beautiful river was now turbulent and muddy. Not a sign
of the savages was seen. They had disappeared, carrying with them
their dead and wounded; and the only vestiges of the conflict
were numerous red spots in the clayey earth which the storm had
not completely washed away.</p>

<p>Before it was light, Dingle and Peterson entered the wood to
ascertain whether the Shawnees had really fled or not. They now
made their appearance with the intelligence that they were not
in the neighborhood, and there was no further cause for fear.
The settlers, thankful and joyous, poured out of the block-house,
carrying back their furniture and valuables, and by noon the settlement
wore its usual appearance again.</p>

<p>One of the sentinels reported to the commander about this time,
that there was still an Indian in the wood, apparently bent upon
mischief.</p>

<p>"Draw bead and shoot him the first chance you get," was the reply.</p>

<p>With this determination, the sentinel betook himself to watching
again. He was the only person acting in that capacity at this
time, the commander deeming the assurance of Dingle and Peterson
of enough weight to allow his men a good half day's rest.</p>

<p>Occasional glimpses of the supposed savage could be obtained;
but it was a long time before the sentinel could bring his rifle
to bear upon him. He dodged and flitted so rapidly that it seemed
impossible; but becoming impatient and provoked, the sentinel
at last raised his gun, took a quick aim at what he supposed to
be his head, and blazed away.</p>

<p>"Consarn your old picter, who you shooting at?" called out the
indignant Jenkins, as he stepped into the clearing.</p>

<p>The sentinel dropped his gun in amazement, and stared all agape
at the speaker as he recognized him. Jenkins supposing his silence
the result of fear, suddenly became valiant and again demanded,</p>

<p>"Say, who you shooting at? S'pose you'd have hit me. Smart, ain't
you. You needn't look so innocent and drop that gun, and pretend
you didn't do it. I seen you take aim and shoot, and I'll pay
you for it, danged if I don't!"</p>

<p>By this time Peterson and several others appeared on the platform,
and understanding how matters stood, their laughter was loud and
continued. Jenkins indeed presented a comical and curious appearance.
Naturally thin and bony, he now seemed doubly elongated, from
the fact that his clothes were completely saturated, and clung
tightly to his limbs. As he straddled indignantly forward, they
flapped together, and it would have been no great stretch of imagination
to suppose him a post gliding over the ground.</p>

<p>"Can't you answer? <em>WHO YOU SHOOTING AT</em>?"</p>

<p>"Why at you, of course," replied the commander, striving vainly
to restrain his gravity. Jenkins was heard to give a loud "umph!"
and seen to shake his hand in a warning manner, when he was admitted
into the gate and strode hurriedly toward the fort. The sentinel,
who had gained his senses by this time, enjoyed the fun as much
as the others, and determined to carry the joke through. He made
no reply for the very purpose of giving Jenkins the idea he was
sorely frightened at his mistake.</p>

<p>The indignant Jenkins soon made his appearance upon the platform,
and observing the cowering sentinel shrinking behind the others,
called out,</p>

<p>"You're the man, yes, sir! Come out here, and get half killed!"</p>

<p>"That's right, Jenkins, give it to him. He'll larn better than
to fire at you agin," said Dingle, with an appearance of just
indignation.</p>

<p>"Go in, long-legs, and hammer him," repeated the others.</p>

<p>"Yes! come out here and take it, you old coward, you!" shouted
Jenkins, stepping around and rubbing his fore-arms as though he
were rolling up his sleeves. "Come out here, I tell you!"</p>

<p>The men now pushed the trembling man from behind them, and retreated
so as to leave the two in an open space and facing each other.
The sentinel now put off all semblance of fear, and demanded in
a gruff tone,</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Why, I want you to stand still while I hammer you half to death!"</p>

<p>"Hammer away, but if your head isn't cracked before five minutes,
I'll stand treat, boys."</p>

<p>The astonishment shown by Jenkins at this unexpected change was
ludicrous in the extreme. His hands suddenly unclinched, and he
stammered out,</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what did you say?"</p>

<p>"Why, come on and fight," replied the sentinel, blustering as
vigorously as did Jenkins at first.</p>

<p>"You shot at me, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and will do it again, too."</p>

<p>"I don't think it was the right thing. I wouldn't do it to you."</p>

<p>"Because you are <em>afraid</em>."</p>

<p>"No, &mdash;I don't think I would."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?"</p>

<p>"I s'pose you didn't do it on purpose, and I won't say anything
about it this time. But you mustn't do it again."</p>

<p>"Yes I will, if I want to. I shot at you, and am sorry I didn't
hit you. Come, I thought you was going to whip me."</p>

<p>"Yes, Jenkins, give it to him. You said you were going to," cried
the others.</p>

<p>"I don't s'pose he done it on purpose," he replied, turning toward
the others.</p>

<p>"Yes I did, I told you so, and would as lief do it again as not."</p>

<p>"Jerusalem! here I'm standing in my wet clothes and catching
cold every minute. This'll never do!"</p>

<p>And in spite of the jeers and laughs of the others, Jenkins with
an anxious look, hurried away to "change his clothes."</p>
