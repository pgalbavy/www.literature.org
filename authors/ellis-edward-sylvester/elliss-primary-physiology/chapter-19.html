<p>The bones are the frame-work of the body. Like the muscles, they
are generally found in pairs, one for each side of the body. Their
number is more than two hundred. When joined together, in their
proper position, they make a skeleton, as shown in the picture
on page 115, where the names of the principal bones are given.</p>

<p>A bone is composed of animal and mineral substance. The animal
part gives it elasticity, and the mineral, hardness. In youth
there is more of the animal substance, but it grows less as a
person becomes older. This explains why the bones of a child do
not break so readily as those of an aged person, and why, when
broken, they heal much sooner. Sometimes when a very old man or
woman has a limb broken, the bone will not "knit," or heal at
all.</p>

<p>The movable joints are joined by bands or ligaments, which are
very strong. They often refuse to yield, when the bone to which
they are fastened is broken. If a ligament is strained or hurt,
a "sprain" is caused, which may be as bad as a broken bone.</p>

<p>Boys and girls are apt to form bad habits by which some of the
bones become misshapen. You should hold your head erect, but not
thrust forward; keep the chest expanded and the shoulders well
back. You will find, after awhile, that this healthful posture
is the most pleasant you can take, and it will give you the form
which nature intends all of us to have.</p>

<p>  What are the bones? How are they generally placed? How many
bones   have you? What is a skeleton?</p>

<p>  Of what is a bone composed? What does the animal part give?
The   mineral? Why is the bone of a child less liable to break
than that   of an older person? What takes place sometimes when
the bone of an   old person is broken?</p>

<p>  How are the movable joints joined? What is said of the strength
of a   ligament? What is a "sprain"?</p>

<p>  What are boys and girls apt to do? What is the proper posture?
What   will you find? </p>
