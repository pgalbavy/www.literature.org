<p>Along the eastern bank a small Indian canoe, containing a single
individual, was stealing its way&mdash;"hugging" the shore so as to
take advantage of the narrow band of shadow that followed the
winding of the stream. There were no trees on either side of the
river, but this portion was walled in by bluffs, rising from three
or four to fully twenty feet in height. The current was sluggish
and not a breath of air wrinkled the surface on this mild summer
night.</p>

<p>It was in the wildest part of the Indian country, and Tom Hardynge,
the hunter, runner and bearer of all dispatches between the frontier
posts in the extreme southwest, knew very well that for three
days past it had been his proverbial good fortune, or rather a
special Providence, that had kept his scalp from ornamenting the
lodge of some marauding Comanche or Apache. Tom was one of the
bravest and most skillful of borderers in those days, and had
been up in the Indian country to learn the truth of numerous rumors
which had come to the stations, reports of a general uprising
among the redskins, with whom the peace commissioners had succeeded
in negotiating treaties after months of diplomacy. After spending
more than a week in dodging back and forth, in the disguise of
an Indian he had learned enough to feel that there was good foundation
for these rumors, and that the exposed stations and settlements
were in imminent peril. As soon as he was assured of this fact
he started on his return to Fort Havens, which still lay a good
three days' travel to the southwest. It was Tom's purpose to continue
his descent until the following night, when, if nothing unexpected
should intervene, he hoped to reach the point where he had left
his mustang, and thence it would be plain sailing for the rest
of the way. He knew the country thoroughly, and was confident
that it was safer to perform a part of the journey by water than
by land, which explains how it was that he was still in the paint
and garb of an Indian, and still stealing his way down toward
the Gulf of California.</p>

<p>"Them Apaches are a cute set," he muttered, as he glided along
through the bank of shadow; "I believe they've larned I've been
up among them lookin' around. I can't tell 'zactly how they larned
it. I've played Injun so often that I know I can do it purty well;
but they know there's somethin' in the air, and them signs I spied
yesterday showed plain 'nough that they was lookin' for me. They'd
give a dozen of their best warriors, with a chief throwed in to
make good weight, to keep me from reachin' Fort Havens with the
news that the Apaches are makin' ready to raise Old Ned along
the border. Fact is, I do carry big news, that's sartin. Hello!"</p>

<p>This exclamation was caused by the appearance of a bright point
of light on the edge of the bluff, several hundred yards down
the river, and upon the opposite side. At first glance it resembled
some star of the first magnitude, which a sudden depression of
the bluff had made visible. The scout ceased paddling, and, suffering
the canoe to drift slowly with the tide, fixed his keen gray eyes
upon the fiery point.</p>

<p>"That ain't any more of a star than I am," he added, a second
later. "There she goes again!"</p>

<p>The torch, for such it was, remained stationary for scarcely
a minute, when it began revolving swiftly from right to left,
the gyration being of such a nature as to prove that it was swung
by the hand of some person. Three revolutions, and then it suddenly
reversed and made three in the opposite direction, then two back,
then two forward, then one back and forth, and then it vanished
in the gloom of the night. Tom scarcely breathed while viewing
this pantomime, and when it ended he still held the paddle motionless
while he chuckled to himself, for he knew what it all meant. He
had seen Indian telegraphy before, and had learned to comprehend
a great deal of those mysterious signs and signals by which news
is carried across mountain and prairie with incredible speed.
He had ridden his fleet mustang to death to head off some of these
telegrams, and yet in every case the Indians, by some trickery
unexplained to him, had outsped him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can read that," Tom growled, still drifting with the
current. "That ere redskin is signalin' to some other scamp, and
it's all about <em>me</em>. It says that I'm on the river somewhere,
and a lookout must be kept for me."</p>

<p>Such was the fact. The Indian who swayed the torch meant thereby
to appraise some confederate that the scout who had dared to penetrate
such a distance into their country, and to unearth their most
important secrets, was seeking to make his way down the Rio Gila
and out of their country again. This much said the torch in language
that could not be mistaken. Although it added no more, yet the
sequence was inevitable, and Tom needed no one to apprise him
that the river both above and below him was closely watched, and
that he was in the greatest peril of his life. Being entirely
shrouded in shadow, he could not see the moon, which rode high
in the sky, scarcely touched by a floating cloud.</p>

<p>"I wish the moon would go out of sight altogether," he said to
himself, as he viewed the clear sky. "I'd like to see it as black
as a wolf's mouth, and then I'd teach these scamps somethin';
but there's too much confounded moonlight layin' loose for a chap
to show any scientific tricks."</p>

<p>The fact that a redskin had indulged in signaling suggested that
there must be some one to whom he had signaled, and the hunter
devoted himself to learning where the second Apache was located.</p>

<p>"As near as I kin calc'late, the chap must be on this side of
the stream, and purty close to where I'm rockin' in the cradle
of the deep this very minute."</p>

<p>He now moved his paddle slightly&mdash;just enough to hold the boat
motionless while he looked and listened. The stillness was profound;
not even the soft sighing of the wind reaching his ears. He had
peered around in the gloom only a few minutes when he discerned
the reply to the signal already described, and so close that he
was startled. Scarcely fifty feet below him, and on the edge of
the bluff, several yards in height, a light flashed into view.
A second glance showed him that it was a flaming torch held in
the hand of an Indian, who began whirling it around his head with
a swiftness that made it seem like a revolving wheel of fire.
The rapid motion of the torch, as the reader may infer, caused
an equally rapid increase of the flame upon it, so that it revealed
the Indian himself; and the hunter, as he looked toward it, saw
the figure of the warrior standing like some pyrotechnist in the
center of his own display.</p>

<p>A better target could not have been asked, and Tom, quick as
thought, raised his rifle and sighted it; but with his finger
upon the trigger, he refrained, lowered the piece and shook his
head, muttering as he did so:</p>

<p>"He deserves it, and I'd like to give it to him, but it won't
do. They'd know what the rifle-crack meant, and I'd have a hornet's
nest about my head quick as lightnin'."</p>

<p>Tom was not certain of the meaning of the exhibition he had just
seen, but believed that it was intended as a mere reply to the
other&mdash;the same as if the Apache had shouted "All right!" in response
to the notification. The Indian must have circled the torch in
this manner for more than a score of times, when he threw it from
his hand into the river, where it fell with a hiss, and was instantly
extinguished.</p>

<p>The scout was in a quandary. If he continued down stream he must
pass directly beneath the spot where his foe was standing, and
the shadow was by no means dense enough to make it possible for
him to escape observation. He was confident, however, that if
he could change places with the warrior, he could discern the
canoe without any closer approach. He was at a disadvantage, for
the bluff was perfectly perpendicular and so high that he could
not reach the ground above without retreating up the river for
at least a quarter of a mile, where the bluff was depressed enough
to permit him to draw himself upward upon it. Had the bank been
low and wooded, it would have been the easiest matter in the world
to have shoved the canoe into the shelter, or to have circumvented
the Indian by lifting it bodily from the water and going around
him, and striking the river again below. But Tom hesitated only
a few minutes. He was anxious to get forward, for delay was dangerous
and he felt annoyed at the manner in which he was dogged.</p>

<p>"Here goes," he exclaimed, starting the canoe forward again.
"If that Apache is anxious for a scrimmage, he can have one."</p>
