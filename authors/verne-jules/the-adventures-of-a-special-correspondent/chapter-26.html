<P>&quot;Pekin!&quot; shouted Popof. &quot;All change here.&quot;</P>
<P>And Caterna replied with truly Parisian unction:</P>
<P>&quot;I believe you, my boy!&quot;</P>
<P>And we all changed.</P>
<P>It was four o&apos;clock in the afternoon. For people fatigued with three hundred
and twelve hours of traveling, it was no time for running about the town&mdash;what do
I say?&mdash;the four towns inclosed one within the other. Besides, I had plenty of
time. I was going to stop some weeks in this capital.</P>
<P>The important thing was to find a hotel in which one could live passably.
From information received I was led to believe that the hotel of <I>Ten Thousand
Dreams</I>, near the railway station, might be sufficiently in accord with
Western notions.</P>
<P>As to Mademoiselle Klork, I will postpone my visit till tomorrow. I will call
on her before the box arrives, and even then I shall be too soon, for I shall
take her the news of Kinko&apos;s death.</P>
<P>Major Noltitz will remain in the same hotel as I do. I have not to bid him
farewell, nor have I to part with the Caternas, who are going to stay a
fortnight before starting for Shanghai. As to Pan-Chao and Dr. Tio-King, a
carriage is waiting to take them to the yamen in which the young Chinaman&apos;s
family live. But we shall see each other again. Friends do not separate at a
simple good-by, and the grip of the hand I gave him as he left the car will not
be the last.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Ephrinell lose no time in leaving the station on business, which
obliges them to find a hotel in the commercial quarter of the Chinese town. But
they do not leave without receiving my compliments. Major Noltitz and I go up to
this amiable couple, and the conventional politenesses are reciprocally
exchanged.</P>
<P>&quot;At last,&quot; said I to Ephrinell, &quot;the forty-two packages of Strong, Bulbul
&amp; Co. have come into port. But it is a wonder the explosion of our engine
did not smash your artificial teeth.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Just so,&quot; said the American, &quot;my teeth had a narrow escape. What adventures
they have had since we left Tiflis? Decidedly this journey has been less
monotonous than I expected.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And,&quot; added the major, &quot;you were married on the way&mdash;unless I am
mistaken!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Wait a bit!&quot; replied the Yankee in a peculiar tone. &quot;Excuse me; we are in a
hurry.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We will not keep you, Mr. Ephrinell,&quot; I replied, &quot;and to Mrs. Ephrinell and
yourself allow us to say au revoir!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Au revoir!&quot; replied the Americanized lady, rather more dryly at her arrival
than at her departure.</P>
<P>Then, turning, she said:</P>
<P>&quot;I have no time to wait, Mr. Ephrinell.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nor have I, Mrs. Ephrinell,&quot; replied the Yankee.</P>
<P>Mr.! Mrs.! And not so long ago they were calling each other Fulk and
Horatia.</P>
<P>And then, without taking each other&apos;s arm, they walked out of the station. I
believe he turned to the right and she to the left; but that is their
affair.</P>
<P>There remains my No. 8, Sir Francis Trevellyan, the silent personage, who has
not said a word all through the piece&mdash;I mean all through the journey. I wanted
to hear his voice, if it was only for one second.</P>
<P>Eh! If I am not mistaken, here is the opportunity at last.</P>
<P>There is the phlegmatic gentleman contemptuously looking up and down the
cars. He has just taken a cigar from his yellow morocco case, but when he looks
at his match-box he finds it empty.</P>
<P>My cigar&mdash;a particularly good one&mdash;is alight, and I am smoking it with the
blessed satisfaction of one who enjoys it, and regretting that there is not a
man in all China who has its equal.</P>
<P>Sir Francis Trevellyan has seen the light burning at the end of my cigar, and
he comes towards me.</P>
<P>I think he is going to ask me for a light. He stretches out his hand, and I
present him with my cigar.</P>
<P>He takes it between his thumb and forefinger, knocks off the white ash,
lights up, and then, if I had not heard him ask for a light, I at least expected
him to say, &quot;Thank you, sir!&quot;</P>
<P>Not at all! Sir Francis Trevellyan takes a few puffs at his own cigar, and
then nonchalantly throws mine on to the platform. And then without even a bow,
he walks leisurely off out of the railway station.</P>
<P>Did you say nothing? No, I remained astounded. He gave me neither a word nor
a gesture. I was completely dumfounded at this ultra-Britannic rudeness, while
Major Noltitz could not restrain a loud outburst of laughter.</P>
<P>Ah! If I should see this gentleman again. But never did I see again Sir
Francis Trevellyan of Trevellyan Hall, Trevellyanshire.</P>
<P>Half an hour afterwards we are installed at the Hotel of <I>Ten Thousand
Dreams</I>. There we are served with a dinner in Chinese style. The repast being
over&mdash;towards the second watch&mdash;we lay ourselves on beds that are too narrow in
rooms with little comfort, and sleep not the sleep of the just, but the sleep of
the exhausted&mdash;and that is just as good.</P>
<P>I did not wake before ten o&apos;clock, and I might have slept all the morning if
the thought had not occurred to me that I had a duty to fulfil. And what a duty!
To call in the Avenue Cha Coua before the delivery of the unhappy case to
Mademoiselle Zinca Klork.</P>
<P>I arise. Ah! If Kinko had not succumbed, I should have returned to the
railway station&mdash;I should have assisted, as I had promised, in the unloading of
the precious package. I would have watched it on to the cart, and I would have
accompanied it to the Avenue Cha Coua, I would even have helped in carrying him
up to Mademoiselle Zinca Klork! And what a double explosion of joy there would
have been when Kinko jumped through the panel to fall into the arms of the fair
Roumanian!</P>
<P>But no! When the box arrives it will be empty&mdash;empty as a heart from which all
the blood has escaped.</P>
<P>I leave the Hotel of <I>Ten Thousand Dreams</I> about eleven o&apos;clock, I call
one of those Chinese carriages, which look like palanquins on wheels, I give the
address of Mademoiselle Klork, and I am on the way.</P>
<P>You know, that among the eighteen provinces of China Petchili occupies the
most northerly position. Formed of nine departments, it has for its capital
Pekin, otherwise known as Chim-Kin-Fo, an appellation which means a &quot;town of the
first order, obedient to Heaven.&quot;</P>
<P>I do not know if this town is really obedient to Heaven, but it is obedient
to the laws of rectilineal geometry. There are four towns, square or
rectangular, one within the other. The Chinese town, which contains the Tartar
town, which contains the yellow town, or Houng Tching, which contains the Red
Town, or Tsen-Kai-Tching, that is to say, &quot;the forbidden town.&quot; And within this
symmetrical circuit of six leagues there are more than two millions of those
inhabitants, Tartars or Chinese, who are called the Germans of the East, without
mentioning several thousands of Mongols and Tibetans. That there is much bustle
in the streets, I can see by the obstacles my vehicle encounters at every step,
itinerating peddlers, carts heavily laden, mandarins and their noisy following.
I say nothing of those abominable wandering dogs, half jackals, half wolves,
hairless and mangy, with deceitful eyes, threatening jaws, and having no other
food than the filthy rubbish which foreigners detest. Fortunately I am not on
foot, and I have no business in the Red Town, admittance to which is denied, nor
in the yellow town nor even in the Tartar town.</P>
<P>The Chinese town forms, a rectangular parallelogram, divided north and south
by the Grand Avenue leading from the Houn Ting gate to the Tien gate, and
crossed east and west by the Avenue Cha-Coua, which runs from the gate of that
name to the Cpuan-Tsa gate. With this indication nothing could be easier than to
find the dwelling of Mademoiselle Zinca Klork, but nothing more difficult to
reach, considering the block in the roads in this outer ring.</P>
<P>A little before twelve I arrived at my destination. My vehicle had stopped
before a house of modest appearance, occupied by artisans as lodgings, and as
the signboard said more particularly by strangers.</P>
<P>It was on the first floor, the window of which opened on to the avenue, that
the young Roumanian lived, and where, having learned her trade as a milliner in
Paris, she was engaged in it at Pekin.</P>
<P>I go up to the first floor. I read the name of Madame Zinca Klork on a door.
I knock. The door is opened.</P>
<P>I am in the presence of a young lady who is perfectly charming, as Kinko
said. She is a blonde of from twenty-two to twenty-three years old, with the
black eyes of the Roumanian type, an agreeable figure, a pleasant, smiling face.
In fact, has she not been informed that the Grand Transasiatic train has been in
the station ever since last evening, in spite of the circumstances of the
journey, and is she not awaiting her betrothed from one moment to another?</P>
<P>And I, with a word, am about to extinguish this joy. I am to wither that
smile.</P>
<P>Mademoiselle Klork is evidently much surprised at seeing a stranger in her
doorway. As she has lived several years in France, she does not hesitate to
recognize me as a Frenchman, and asks to what she is indebted for my visit.</P>
<P>I must take care of my words, for I may kill her, poor child.</P>
<P>&quot;Mademoiselle Zinca&mdash;&mdash;&quot; I say.</P>
<P>&quot;You know my name?&quot; she exclaims.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, mademoiselle. I arrived yesterday by the Grand Transasiatic.&quot;</P>
<P>The girl turned pale; her eyes became troubled. It was evident that she
feared something. Had Kinko been found in his box? Had the fraud been
discovered? Was he arrested? Was he in prison?</P>
<P>I hastened to add:</P>
<P>&quot;Mademoiselle Zinca&mdash;certain circumstances have brought to my knowledge&mdash;the
journey of a young Roumanian&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Kinko&mdash;my poor Kinko&mdash;they have found him?&quot; she asks in a trembling voice.</P>
<P>&quot;No&mdash;no&mdash;&mdash;&quot; say I, hesitating. &quot;No one knows&mdash;except myself. I often visited him
in the luggage-van at night; we were companions, friends. I took him a few
provisions&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! thank you, sir!&quot; says the lady, taking me by the hands. &quot;With a
Frenchman Kinko was sure of not being betrayed, and even of receiving help!
Thank you, thank you!&quot;</P>
<P>I am more than ever afraid of the mission on which I have come.</P>
<P>&quot;And no one suspected the presence of my dear Kinko?&quot; she asks.</P>
<P>&quot;No one.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What would you have had us do, sir? We are not rich. Kinko was without money
over there at Tiflis, and I had not enough to send him his fare. But he is here
at last. He will get work, for he is a good workman, and as soon as we can we
will pay the company&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; I know, I know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And then we are going to get married, monsieur. He loves me so much, and I
love him. We met one another in Paris. He was so kind to me. Then when he went
back to Tiflis I asked him to come to me in that box. Is the poor fellow
ill?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, Mademoiselle Zinca, no.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! I shall be happy to pay the carriage of my dear Kinko.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes&mdash;pay the carriage&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It will not be long now?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No; this afternoon probably.&quot;</P>
<P>I do not know what to say.</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; says mademoiselle, &quot;we are going to get married as soon as the
formalities are complied with; and if it is not abusing your confidence, will
you do us the honor and pleasure of being present?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At your marriage&mdash;certainly. I promised my friend Kinko I would.&quot;</P>
<P>Poor girl! I cannot leave her like this. I must tell her everything.</P>
<P>&quot;Mademoiselle Zinca&mdash;Kinko&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He asked you to come and tell me he had arrived?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes&mdash;but&mdash;you understand&mdash;he is very tired after so long a journey&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tired?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! do not be alarmed&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is he ill?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes&mdash;rather&mdash;rather ill&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then I will go&mdash;I must see him&mdash;I pray you, sir, come with me to the
station&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No; that would be an imprudence&mdash;remain here&mdash;remain&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>Zinca Klork looked at me fixedly.</P>
<P>&quot;The truth, monsieur, the truth! Hide nothing from me&mdash;Kinko&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes&mdash;I have sad news&mdash;to give you.&quot; She is fainting. Her lips tremble. She can
hardly speak.</P>
<P>&quot;He has been discovered!&quot; she says. &quot;His fraud is known&mdash;they have arrested
him&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Would to heaven it was no worse. We have had accidents on the road. The
train was nearly annihilated&mdash;a frightful catastrophe&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He is dead! Kinko is dead!&quot;</P>
<P>The unhappy Zinca falls on to a chair&mdash;and to employ the imaginative
phraseology of the Chinese&mdash;her tears roll down like rain on an autumn night.
Never have I seen anything so lamentable. But it will not do to leave her in
this state, poor girl! She is becoming unconscious. I do not know where I am. I
take her hands. I repeat:</P>
<P>&quot;Mademoiselle Zinca! Mademoiselle Zinca!&quot;</P>
<P>Suddenly there is a great noise in front of the house. Shouts are heard.
There is a tremendous to do, and amid the tumult I hear a voice.</P>
<P>Good Heavens! I cannot be mistaken. That is Kinko&apos;s voice!</P>
<P>I recognize it. Am I in my right senses?</P>
<P>Zinca jumps up, springs to the window, opens it, and we look out.</P>
<P>There is a cart at the door. There is the case, with all its inscriptions:
<I>This side up, this side down, fragile, glass, beware of damp</I>, etc., etc.
It is there&mdash;half smashed. There has been a collision. The cart has been run into
by a carriage, as the case was being got down. The case has slipped on to the
ground. It has been knocked in. And Kinko has jumped out like a
jack-in-the-box&mdash;but alive, very much alive!</P>
<P>I can hardly believe my eyes! What, my young Roumanian did not perish in the
explosion? No! As I shall soon hear from his own mouth, he was thrown on to the
line when the boiler went up, remained there inert for a time, found himself
uninjured&mdash;miraculously&mdash;kept away till he could slip into the van unperceived. I
had just left the van after looking for him in vain, and supposing that he had
been the first victim of the catastrophe.</P>
<P>Then&mdash;oh! the irony of fate!&mdash;after accomplishing a journey of six thousand
kilometres on the Grand Transasiatic, shut up in a box among the baggage, after
escaping so many dangers, attack by bandits, explosion of engine, he was here,
by the mere colliding of a cart and a carriage in a Pekin Street, deprived of
all the good of his journey&mdash;fraudulent it may be&mdash;but really if&mdash;I know of no
epithet worthy of this climax.</P>
<P>The carter gave a yell at the sight of a human being who had just appeared.
In an instant the crowd had gathered, the fraud was discovered, the police had
run up. And what could this young Roumanian do who did not know a word of
Chinese, but explain matters in the sign language? And if he could not be
understood, what explanation could he give?</P>
<P>Zinca and I ran down to him.</P>
<P>&quot;My Zinca&mdash;my dear Zinca!&quot; he exclaims, pressing the girl to his heart.</P>
<P>&quot;My Kinko&mdash;my dear Kinko!&quot; she replies, while her tears mingle with his.</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur Bombarnac!&quot; says the poor fellow, appealing for my
intervention.</P>
<P>&quot;Kinko,&quot; I reply, &quot;take it coolly, and depend on me. You are alive, and we
thought you were dead.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But I am not much better off!&quot; he murmurs.</P>
<P>Mistake! Anything is better than being dead&mdash;even when one is menaced by
prison, be it a Chinese prison. And that is what happens, in spite of the girl&apos;s
supplications and my entreaties. And Kinko is dragged off by the police, amid
the laughter and howls of the crowd.</P>
<P>But I will not abandon him! No, if I move heaven and earth, I will not
abandon him.</P>
