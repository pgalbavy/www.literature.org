<p>The time has come for us to turn our attention to George and
Victor Shelton, who, after parting with Deerfoot, set out for
the principal Blackfoot village under the guidance of their old
friend Mul-tal-la, a member of that powerful organization of the
Northwest.</p>

<p>You will recall that when the little party of explorers were
approaching the home of the tribe they met two warriors, who were
old friends of Mul-tal-la and lived in the same primitive settlement
with him. After Mul-tal-la had made known the sad fate of his
companion in the East, an earnest talk took place and the decision
was made that it would not only be imprudent but dangerous to
the last degree for the Blackfoot to return home, taking with
him the first announcement of the deplorable accident that had
robbed the tribe of one of its best warriors.</p>

<p>Taggarak, the leading war chief, was a terrible sachem, who,
on the principle that has ruled for centuries in China, would
put Mul-tal-la to death, even though he was wholly blameless of
neglect or wrongdoing. It was agreed that our friends should push
on to the westward, and then come back to the Blackfoot settlement,
where the Shawanoe and the brothers would spend the winter, resuming
their homeward journey with the coming of spring.</p>

<p>This would defer the arrival of Mul-tal-la for two or three months,
which his two friends would utilize the best they could. Taggarak
would have time for the cooling of his resentful rage, and it
was to be hoped that he would appreciate the service of Mul-tal-la,
who, young as he was, had proved himself one of the bravest of
warriors. The plan was a wise one and it worked well.</p>

<p>The two messengers had a story of absorbing interest to tell.
They hinted at the remarkable experience of their comrade among
his own race and the white people, hundreds of miles toward the
rising sun. They said that when he came to the village he would
bring with him a member of the chief tribe of the East and two
pale-faced youths, who would honor the Blackfeet by accepting
their hospitality for the winter. There was something in this
fact that appealed to that chivalric feeling which is never wholly
lacking in the most degraded and cruel race. Taggarak had little
to say, but the path to his magnanimity had been paved.</p>

<p>One of the chief causes of this relaxation of sternness on his
part was the accounts which he heard of the Indian youth. His
fleetness of foot, his skill with bow and rifle, his personal
daring and prowess, his quickness and strength, his comeliness
of face and form, were dwelt upon and pictured in the most glowing
language. The chieftain Taggarak's question of the messengers
was characteristic, as was their reply.</p>

<p>"Are all the warriors of the Shawanoes like this youth of whom
you tell these strange stories?"</p>

<p>"The Shawanoes are no braver than the Blackfeet, but there is
none among them like Deerfoot, nor can his equal be found in all
the world."</p>

<p>Among those who doubted the truth of the words of the messengers
were several aspiring bucks, who secretly resolved never to admit
the superiority of the Shawanoe youth in any of the respects named
until such superiority had been proved before their eyes.</p>

<p>The curiosity and spirit of hospitality were general among the
Blackfeet. Expecting the visitors to spend several months with
them, they made preparations for their convenience and comfort.
One of the first things undertaken by the two who had met the
little party was the building of a tepee or home for them. Mul-tal-la
had his own father and mother and would go to their lodge, but
it would not have been seemly to place the three guests with anyone
else.</p>

<p>It has already been said that the Blackfoot village, which was
the main one of the tribe and the dwelling-place of the leading
chief, was stretched along the bank of a running stream which
was a remote tributary of the Missouri. This river had a rapid
current and ran almost due south in front of the village, which
lay wholly on the eastern bank. The tepees were more than a hundred
in number, and, when Taggarak went on the war path, he had taken
more than two hundred warriors from his own town&mdash;and they were
the flower of the tribe.</p>

<p>To the rear of the settlement was an open space covering several
acres. This was not only the children's playground, but was often
used by the warriors for their games and athletic exercises. The
space was so extensive that at certain seasons of the year the
outer portions were covered with rich nourishing grass, which
was also abundant in the neighborhood. Nearly every warrior was
the owner of a horse, which, when not in use, was allowed to wander
and graze at will.</p>

<p>These Indians lived after the manner of their race when removed
from civilization, which, as a rule, has proved a greater curse
than boon to them. Fortunately they knew nothing of the ruinous
"fire water" that was to await the coming of professing Christians
and the claimants of a higher culture and civilization. They spent
their time mainly in hunting and fishing, sometimes engaging in
raids upon other tribes, several of whose grounds lay to the north
of the boundary line. When not thus employed they lolled about,
like true lords of creation, smoking, drowsing or indifferently
watching their squaws, who did all the tilling of the ground and
gathering of the scant crops from the rich soil. The Blackfeet
lived too far to the eastward to take any part in the salmon fishing
which gave employment to so many of their race on the western
slope of the Rocky Mountains. The warriors were finely formed,
and were held in no little respect and fear by the neighboring
red men, most of whom at some time or other had felt the weight
of their prowess.</p>

<p>The home for the expected visitors was erected at the extreme
northern end of the village, and was separated by fully fifty
yards from the next neighbor to the south. About a dozen saplings
were planted in the ground so as to form a circle, perhaps fifteen
feet in diameter and a little less in height. The tops were tied
together, but loosely enough to leave an opening a foot or more
across to serve as a chimney. Over the framework thus formed were
stretched with no little skill a number of bison furs, with the
furry side in. They were stitched together by means of deer sinews
and pegged at the bottom, so as to shut out all draught. Thus
all the interior walls were brown and shaggy and warm. On the
outside of numerous tepees, cured and whitened by the storms,
many of the aboriginal artists of the tribe had sketched grotesque
figures of men, horses and wild animals.</p>

<p>You will note that the temporary home of our friends was of the
most primitive character, and yet all had seen such before and
Deerfoot had spent many a day and night in similar ones in the
East. At one side a loose bison robe could be lifted, thus serving
as a door. When the weather was warm this fold was often fastened
back to permit a partial ventilation of the lodge.</p>

<p>In the middle of the space the fire was kindled, the smoke finding
escape through the opening in the saplings at the crown of the
structure. Despite the care with which the robes were joined together,
enough air stole through the crevices to give the necessary draught
for the chimney and furnish the occupants comparatively pure sustenance
for their lungs.</p>

<p>The bare ground was the only floor to these rude structures,
but the blankets and furs served as so many rugs, and the dwellings,
with the crackling fire in the center, could be made comfortable
even in the depth of the rigorous winters.</p>

<p>At that early day, more firearms than would be supposed were
found among the Indian tribes of the Northwest, though naturally
the old-fashioned bow and arrow were the main weapon. The flintlocks
were gotten by barter with tribes on the other side of the Rockies,
who in turn managed to buy them from the few ships that were beginning
to trade with the savages about the lower waters of the Columbia.
These guns were comparatively few in number, and it is hardly
probable that there were a score among the whole tribe. Few as
were the firearms, several good marksmen had been developed among
the Blackfeet, and they were naturally proud of their skill. When
a party engaged in one of their raids, all the muskets were taken
with them. But ammunition was used sparingly, for it necessitated
long and expensive journeys through the mountains to renew the
supply. You remember that Mul-tal-la left home with only his bow
and arrow.</p>

<p>The messengers, when spending their brief time with our friends
while they were pushing toward the Pacific, heard of that new
religion which was professed not only by Deerfoot the Shawanoe,
but by his companions. It was so different from the pagan belief
that the couple, upon their return to the village, took care to
make no mention of it; better to leave that until the arrival
of Deerfoot. At the same time the two Blackfeet trembled when
they thought of what was almost certain to take place. Taggarak
was a fierce heathen who would savagely resent any interference
with the crude belief that had belonged to his people from time
immemorial. A collision between him and Deerfoot, and perhaps
with his companions, was among the certainties of the near future.</p>

<p>Thus everything had been prepared for Mul-tal-la and the Shelton
brothers when one afternoon the three rode into the village, with
Zigzag the packhorse plodding at the rear of the procession. The
arrival made a hubbub of excitement, and it seemed as if the whole
settlement&mdash;men, squaws and children&mdash;gathered clamorously round
the horsemen, who dismounted and gazed about them with scarcely
less wonder.</p>

<p>The parents of Mul-tal-la remained in their own lodge. They must
have been more eager than any to welcome the son that had been
gone so long out of their world, but it would have been weakness
on their part to hasten to greet him. Besides, he must needs look
after the white youths, who had now become more dependent than
ever upon him.</p>

<p>The two former acquaintances were among the first to crowd forward
to welcome the boys and their old companion. There was no mistake
as to the genuineness of <em>their</em> pleasure. They told of
the quarters awaiting the lads, who, remounting with Mul-tal-la,
rode to the new residence erected at the northern extremity of
the Blackfoot town, with their guides walking beside their animals.</p>

<p>Mul-tal-la was as stoical as any of his race, though he was yearning
to look upon that father and mother who would greet him, and he
them, as if they had been parted for only a few hours. Slipping
to the ground again, the three took a peep at the interior of
the tepee which has already been described to you. The boys expressed
their delight and thanked their friends over and over again. Then
Mul-tal-la bade them good-bye, promising to call in a short time,
after which he lounged away toward his own lodge. On the road
he continually encountered his old friends and exchanged greetings
and talked with them as if glad of an excuse for delaying his
reunion with his parents.</p>

<p>One of the first bits of news imparted to the Blackfoot was that
Taggarak was absent on a visit to the farthest village to the
north, but was expected soon to return. Mul-tal-la was relieved
to hear this, for, despite the assurances of his friends, he dreaded
the anger of the terrible chieftain.</p>

<p>When within a hundred yards of his home, which remained closed
as if deserted, Mul-tal-la turned into the tepee where dwelt the
parents of the companion who had been buried hundreds of miles
away. The father sat on a pile of furs at one side of the lodge,
stolidly smoking his pipe. His squaw was kneeling in front of
the burning wood and trying to blow it into a blaze. They looked
up as the visitor drew aside the flap which served as a door.
The old warrior removed the long stem from his lips and grunted
as he recognized the visitor. The squaw raised her head, saw who
the caller was, and resumed blowing the fire, as if she had no
interest in what he might say.</p>

<p>Mul-tal-la told briefly the particulars of what the couple already
knew, speaking words of praise for the lost one, and saying how
sad his heart had been since the dreadful accident that befell
his companion.</p>

<p>The father replaced the stem in his mouth and slowly puffed.
Once he grunted, but did not speak a word. The mother continued
to fill her leathern cheeks with air and to blow upon the fagots
that were burning so strongly as not to need any urging. She did
not speak nor look up until several minutes after the departure
of Mul-tal-la.</p>
