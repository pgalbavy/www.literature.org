<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The village was terror-stricken.
</p>
<p>It was on a Sunday morning. The peasants of Saint-Nicolas and the
neighbourhood were coming out of church and spreading across the square,
when, suddenly, the women who were walking ahead and who had already
turned into the high-road fell back with loud cries of dismay.
</p><p>At the same moment, an enormous motor-car, looking like some appalling
monster, came tearing into sight at a headlong rate of speed. Amid the
shouts of the madly scattering people, it made straight for the church,
swerved, just as it seemed about to dash itself to pieces against the
steps, grazed the wall of the presbytery, regained the continuation of
the national road, dashed along, turned the corner and disappeared,
without, by some incomprehensible miracle, having so much as brushed
against any of the persons crowding the square.
</p><p>But they had seen! They had seen a man in the driver's seat, wrapped in
a goat-skin coat, with a fur cap on his head and his face disguised in a
pair of large goggles, and, with him, on the front of that seat, flung
back, bent in two, a woman whose head, all covered with blood, hung down
over the bonnet....
</p><p>And they had heard! They had heard the woman's screams, screams of
horror, screams of agony....
</p><p>And it was all such a vision of hell and carnage that the people stood,
for some seconds, motionless, stupefied.
</p><p>"Blood!" roared somebody.
</p><p>There was blood everywhere, on the cobblestones of the square, on the
ground hardened by the first frosts of autumn; and, when a number of men
and boys rushed off in pursuit of the motor, they had but to take those
sinister marks for their guide.
</p><p>The marks, on their part, followed the high-road, but in a very strange
manner, going from one side to the other and leaving a zigzag track, in
the wake of the tires, that made those who saw it shudder. How was it
that the car had not bumped against that tree? How had it been righted,
instead of smashing into that bank? What novice, what madman, what
drunkard, what frightened criminal was driving that motor-car with such
astounding bounds and swerves?
</p><p>One of the peasants declared:
</p><p>"They will never do the turn in the forest."
</p><p>And another said:
</p><p>"Of course they won't! She's bound to upset!"
</p><p>The Forest of Morgues began at half a mile beyond Saint-Nicolas; and the
road, which was straight up to that point, except for a slight bend
where it left the village, started climbing, immediately after entering
the forest, and made an abrupt turn among the rocks and trees. No
motor-car was able to take this turn without first slackening speed.
There were posts to give notice of the danger.
</p><p>The breathless peasants reached the quincunx of beeches that formed the
edge of the forest. And one of them at once cried:
</p><p>"There you are!"
</p><p>"What?"
</p><p>"Upset!"
</p><p>The car, a limousine, had turned turtle and lay smashed, twisted and
shapeless. Beside it, the woman's dead body. But the most horrible,
sordid, stupefying thing was the woman's head, crushed, flattened,
invisible under a block of stone, a huge block of stone lodged there by
some unknown and prodigious agency. As for the man in the goat-skin
coat he was nowhere to be found.
</p><hr/>
<p>He was not found on the scene of the accident. He was not found either
in the neighbourhood. Moreover, some workmen coming down the Côte de
Morgues declared that they had not seen anybody.
</p><p>The man, therefore, had taken refuge in the woods.
</p><p>The gendarmes, who were at once sent for, made a minute search, assisted
by the peasants, but discovered nothing. In the same way, the
examining-magistrates, after a close inquiry lasting for several days,
found no clue capable of throwing the least light upon this inscrutable
tragedy. On the contrary, the investigations only led to further
mysteries and further improbabilities.
</p><p>Thus it was ascertained that the block of stone came from where there
had been a landslip, at least forty yards away. And the murderer, in a
few minutes, had carried it all that distance and flung it on his
victim's head.
</p><p>On the other hand, the murderer, who was most certainly not hiding in
the forest--for, if so, he must inevitably have been discovered, the
forest being of limited extent--had the audacity, eight days after the
crime, to come back to the turn on the hill and leave his goat-skin coat
there. Why? With what object? There was nothing in the pockets of the
coat, except a corkscrew and a napkin. What did it all mean?
</p><p>Inquiries were made of the builder of the motor-car, who recognized the
limousine as one which he had sold, three years ago, to a Russian. The
said Russian, declared the manufacturer, had sold it again at once. To
whom? No one knew. The car bore no number.
</p><p>Then again, it was impossible to identify the dead woman's body. Her
clothes and underclothing were not marked in any way. And the face was
quite unknown.
</p><p>Meanwhile, detectives were going along the national road in the
direction opposite to that taken by the actors in this mysterious
tragedy. But who was to prove that the car had followed that particular
road on the previous night?
</p><p>They examined every yard of the ground, they questioned everybody. At
last, they succeeded in learning that, on the Saturday evening, a
limousine had stopped outside a grocer's shop in a small town situated
about two hundred miles from Saint-Nicolas, on a highway branching out
of the national road. The driver had first filled his tank, bought some
spare cans of petrol and lastly taken away a small stock of provisions:
a ham, fruit, biscuits, wine and a half-bottle of Three Star brandy.
</p><p>There was a lady on the driver's seat. She did not get down. The blinds
of the limousine were drawn. One of these blinds was seen to move
several times. The shopman was positive that there was somebody inside.
</p><p>Presuming the shopman's evidence to be correct, then the problem became
even more complicated, for, so far, no clue had revealed the presence of
a third person.
</p><p>Meanwhile, as the travellers had supplied themselves with provisions, it
remained to be discovered what they had done with them and what had
become of the remains.
</p><p>The detectives retraced their steps. It was not until they came to the
fork of the two roads, at a spot eleven or twelve miles from
Saint-Nicolas, that they met a shepherd who, in answer to their
questions, directed them to a neighbouring field, hidden from view
behind the screen of bushes, where he had seen an empty bottle and other
things.
</p><p>The detectives were convinced at the first examination. The motor-car
had stopped there; and the unknown travellers, probably after a night's
rest in their car, had breakfasted and resumed their journey in the
course of the morning.
</p><p>One unmistakable proof was the half-bottle of Three Star brandy sold by
the grocer. This bottle had its neck broken clean off with a stone. The
stone employed for the purpose was picked up, as was the neck of the
bottle, with its cork, covered with a tin-foil seal. The seal showed
marks of attempts that had been made to uncork the bottle in the
ordinary manner.
</p><p>The detectives continued their search and followed a ditch that ran
along the field at right angles to the road. It ended in a little
spring, hidden under brambles, which seemed to emit an offensive smell.
On lifting the brambles, they perceived a corpse, the corpse of a man
whose head had been smashed in, so that it formed little more than a
sort of pulp, swarming with vermin. The body was dressed in jacket and
trousers of dark-brown leather. The pockets were empty: no papers, no
pocket-book, no watch.
</p><p>The grocer and his shopman were summoned and, two days later, formally
identified, by his dress and figure, the traveller who had bought the
petrol and provisions on the Saturday evening.
</p><p>The whole case, therefore, had to be reopened on a fresh basis. The
authorities were confronted with a tragedy no longer enacted by two
persons, a man and a woman, of whom one had killed the other, but by
three persons, including two victims, of whom one was the very man who
was accused of killing his companion.
</p><p>As to the murderer, there was no doubt: he was the person who travelled
inside the motor-car and who took the precaution to remain concealed
behind the curtains. He had first got rid of the driver and rifled his
pockets and then, after wounding the woman, carried her off in a mad
dash for death.
</p><hr/>
<p>Given a fresh case, unexpected discoveries, unforeseen evidence, one
might have hoped that the mystery would be cleared up, or, at least,
that the inquiry would point a few steps along the road to the truth.
But not at all. The corpse was simply placed beside the first corpse.
New problems were added to the old. The accusation of murder was shifted
from the one to the other. And there it ended. Outside those tangible,
obvious facts there was nothing but darkness. The name of the woman, the
name of the man, the name of the murderer were so many riddles. And then
what had become of the murderer? If he had disappeared from one moment
to the other, that in itself would have been a tolerably curious
phenomenon. But the phenomenon was actually something very like a
miracle, inasmuch as the murderer had not absolutely disappeared. He was
there! He made a practice of returning to the scene of the catastrophe!
In addition to the goat-skin coat, a fur cap was picked up one day; and,
by way of an unparalleled prodigy, one morning, after a whole night
spent on guard in the rock, beside the famous turning, the detectives
found, on the grass of the turning itself, a pair of motor-goggles,
broken, rusty, dirty, done for. How had the murderer managed to bring
back those goggles unseen by the detectives? And, above all, why had he
brought them back?
</p><p>Men's brains reeled in the presence of such abnormalities. They were
almost afraid to pursue the ambiguous adventure. They received the
impression of a heavy, stifling, breathless atmosphere, which dimmed the
eyes and baffled the most clear-sighted.
</p><p>The magistrate in charge of the case fell ill. Four days later, his
successor confessed that the matter was beyond him.
</p><p>Two tramps were arrested and at once released. Another was pursued, but
not caught; moreover, there was no evidence of any sort or kind against
him. In short, it was nothing but one helpless muddle of mist and
contradiction.
</p><p>An accident, the merest accident led to the solution, or rather produced
a series of circumstances that ended by leading to the solution. A
reporter on the staff of an important Paris paper, who had been sent to
make investigations on the spot, concluded his article with the
following words:
</p><p>"I repeat, therefore, that we must wait for fresh events, fresh facts;
we must wait for some lucky accident. As things stand, we are simply
wasting our time. The elements of truth are not even sufficient to
suggest a plausible theory. We are in the midst of the most absolute,
painful, impenetrable darkness. There is nothing to be done. All the
Sherlock Holmeses in the world would not know what to make of the
mystery, and Arsène Lupin himself, if he will allow me to say so, would
have to pay forfeit here."
</p><hr/>
<p>On the day after the appearance of that article, the newspaper in
question printed this telegram:
</p>
<p>    "Have sometimes paid forfeit, but never over such a silly thing as
    this. The Saint-Nicolas tragedy is a mystery for babies.
</p><p><strong>"ARSÈNE LUPIN."</strong>
</p>
<p>And the editor added:
</p>
<p>    "We insert this telegram as a matter of curiosity, for it is
    obviously the work of a wag. Arsène Lupin, past-master though he be
    in the art of practical joking, would be the last man to display
    such childish flippancy."
</p>
<p>Two days elapsed; and then the paper published the famous letter, so
precise and categorical in its conclusions, in which Arsène Lupin
furnished the solution of the problem. I quote it in full:
</p>
<p>    "Sir:
</p><p>    "You have taken me on my weak side by defying me. You challenge me,
    and I accept the challenge. And I will begin by declaring once more
    that the Saint-Nicolas tragedy is a mystery for babies. I know
    nothing so simple, so natural; and the proof of the simplicity
    shall lie in the succinctness of my demonstration. It is contained
    in these few words: when a crime seems to go beyond the ordinary
    scope of things, when it seems unusual and stupid, then there are
    many chances that its explanation is to be found in superordinary,
    supernatural, superhuman motives.
</p><p>    "I say that there are many chances, for we must always allow for
    the part played by absurdity in the most logical and commonplace
    events. But, of course, it is impossible to see things as they are
    and not to take account of the absurd and the disproportionate.
</p><p>    "I was struck from the very beginning by that very evident
    character of unusualness. We have, first of all, the awkward,
    zigzag course of the motor-car, which would give one the impression
    that the car was driven by a novice. People have spoken of a
    drunkard or a madman, a justifiable supposition in itself. But
    neither madness nor drunkenness would account for the incredible
    strength required to transport, especially in so short a space of
    time, the stone with which the unfortunate woman's head was
    crushed. That proceeding called for a muscular power so great that
    I do not hesitate to look upon it as a second sign of the
    unusualness that marks the whole tragedy. And why move that
    enormous stone, to finish off the victim, when a mere pebble would
    have done the work? Why again was the murderer not killed, or at
    least reduced to a temporary state of helplessness, in the terrible
    somersault turned by the car? How did he disappear? And why, having
    disappeared, did he return to the scene of the accident? Why did he
    throw his fur coat there; then, on another day, his cap; then, on
    another day, his goggles?
</p><p>    "Unusual, useless, stupid acts.
</p><p>    "Why, besides, convey that wounded, dying woman on the driver's
    seat of the car, where everybody could see her? Why do that,
    instead of putting her inside, or flinging her into some corner,
    dead, just as the man was flung under the brambles in the ditch?
</p><p>    "Unusualness, stupidity.
</p><p>    "Everything in the whole story is absurd. Everything points to
    hesitation, incoherency, awkwardness, the silliness of a child or
    rather of a mad, blundering savage, of a brute.
</p><p>    "Look at the bottle of brandy. There was a corkscrew: it was found
    in the pocket of the great coat. Did the murderer use it? Yes, the
    marks of the corkscrew can be seen on the seal. But the operation
    was too complicated for him. He broke the neck with a stone. Always
    stones: observe that detail. They are the only weapon, the only
    implement which the creature employs. It is his customary weapon,
    his familiar implement. He kills the man with a stone, he kills the
    woman with a stone and he opens bottles with a stone!
</p><p>    "A brute, I repeat, a savage; disordered, unhinged, suddenly driven
    mad. By what? Why, of course, by that same brandy, which he
    swallowed at a draught while the driver and his companion were
    having breakfast in the field. He got out of the limousine, in
    which he was travelling, in his goat-skin coat and his fur cap,
    took the bottle, broke off the neck and drank. There is the whole
    story. Having drunk, he went raving mad and hit out at random,
    without reason. Then, seized with instinctive fear, dreading the
    inevitable punishment, he hid the body of the man. Then, like an
    idiot, he took up the wounded woman and ran away. He ran away in
    that motor-car which he did not know how to work, but which to him
    represented safety, escape from capture.
</p><p>    "But the money, you will ask, the stolen pocket-book? Why, who says
    that he was the thief? Who says that it was not some passing tramp,
    some labourer, guided by the stench of the corpse?
</p><p>    "Very well, you object, but the brute would have been found, as he
    is hiding somewhere near the turn, and as, after all, he must eat
    and drink.
</p><p>    "Well, well, I see that you have not yet understood. The simplest
    way, I suppose, to have done and to answer your objections is to
    make straight for the mark. Then let the gentlemen of the police
    and the gendarmerie themselves make straight for the mark. Let them
    take firearms. Let them explore the forest within a radius of two
    or three hundred yards from the turn, no more. But, instead of
    exploring with their heads down and their eyes fixed on the ground,
    let them look up into the air, yes, into the air, among the leaves
    and branches of the tallest oaks and the most unlikely beeches.
    And, believe me, they will see him. For he is there. He is there,
    bewildered, piteously at a loss, seeking for the man and woman whom
    he has killed, looking for them and waiting for them and not daring
    to go away and quite unable to understand.
</p><p>    "I myself am exceedingly sorry that I am kept in town by urgent
    private affairs and by some complicated matters of business which I
    have to set going, for I should much have liked to see the end of
    this rather curious adventure.
</p><p>    "Pray, therefore excuse me to my kind friends in the police and
    permit me to be, sir,
</p><p>                             "Your obedient servant,
</p><p><strong>"ARSÈNE LUPIN."</strong>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>The upshot will be remembered. The "gentlemen of the police and the
gendarmerie" shrugged their shoulders and paid no attention to this
lucubration. But four of the local country gentry took their rifles and
went shooting, with their eyes fixed skyward, as though they meant to
pot a few rooks. In half an hour they had caught sight of the murderer.
Two shots, and he came tumbling from bough to bough. He was only
wounded, and they took him alive.
</p><p>That evening, a Paris paper, which did not yet know of the capture,
printed the following paragraphs:
</p>
<p>    "Enquiries are being made after a M. and Mme. Bragoff, who landed
    at Marseilles six weeks ago and there hired a motor-car. They had
    been living in Australia for many years, during which time they had
    not visited Europe; and they wrote to the director of the Jardin
    d'Acclimatation, with whom they were in the habit of corresponding,
    that they were bringing with them a curious creature, of an
    entirely unknown species, of which it was difficult to say whether
    it was a man or a monkey.
</p><p>    "According to M. Bragoff, who is an eminent archæologist, the
    specimen in question is the anthropoid ape, or rather the ape-man,
    the existence of which had not hitherto been definitely proved. The
    structure is said to be exactly similar to that of <u>Pithecanthropus
    erectus</u>, discovered by Dr. Dubois in Java in 1891.
</p><p>    "This curious, intelligent and observant animal acted as its
    owner's servant on their property in Australia and used to clean
    their motor-car and even attempt to drive it.
</p><p>    "The question that is being asked is where are M. and Mme. Bragoff?
    Where is the strange primate that landed with them at Marseilles?"
</p>
<p>The answer to this question was now made easy. Thanks to the hints
supplied by Arsène Lupin, all the elements of the tragedy were known.
Thanks to him, the culprit was in the hands of the law.
</p><p>You can see him at the Jardin d'Acclimatation, where he is locked up
under the name of "Three Stars." He is, in point of fact, a monkey; but
he is also a man. He has the gentleness and the wisdom of the domestic
animals and the sadness which they feel when their master dies. But he
has many other qualities that bring him much closer to humanity: he is
treacherous, cruel, idle, greedy and quarrelsome; and, above all, he is
immoderately fond of brandy.
</p><p>Apart from that, he is a monkey. Unless indeed ...!
</p><hr/>
<p>A few days after Three Stars' arrest, I saw Arsène Lupin standing in
front of his cage. Lupin was manifestly trying to solve this interesting
problem for himself. I at once said, for I had set my heart upon having
the matter out with him:
</p><p>"You know, Lupin, that intervention of yours, your argument, your
letter, in short, did not surprise me so much as you might think!"
</p><p>"Oh, really?" he said, calmly. "And why?"
</p><p>"Why? Because the incident has occurred before, seventy or eighty years
ago. Edgar Allan Poe made it the subject of one of his finest tales. In
those circumstances, the key to the riddle was easy enough to find."
</p><p>Arsène Lupin took my arm, and walking away with me, said:
</p><p>"When did you guess it, yourself?"
</p><p>"On reading your letter," I confessed.
</p><p>"And at what part of my letter?"
</p><p>"At the end."
</p><p>"At the end, eh? After I had dotted all the i's. So here is a crime
which accident causes to be repeated, under quite different conditions,
it is true, but still with the same sort of hero; and your eyes had to
be opened, as well as other people's. It needed the assistance of my
letter, the letter in which I amused myself--apart from the exigencies
of the facts--by employing the argument and sometimes the identical
words used by the American poet in a story which everybody has read. So
you see that my letter was not absolutely useless and that one may
safely venture to repeat to people things which they have learnt only to
forget them."
</p><p>Wherewith Lupin turned on his heel and burst out laughing in the face of
an old monkey, who sat with the air of a philosopher, gravely
meditating.
