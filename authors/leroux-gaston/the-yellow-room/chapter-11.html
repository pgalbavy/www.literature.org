<p>Among the mass of papers, legal documents, memoirs, and extracts
from newspapers, which I have collected, relating to the mystery
of The "Yellow Room", there is one very interesting piece; it
is a detail of the famous examination which took place that afternoon,
in the laboratory of Professor Stangerson, before the Chief of
the Surete. This narrative is from the pen of Monsieur Maleine,
the Registrar, who, like the examining magistrate, had spent some
of his leisure time in the pursuit of literature. The piece was
to have made part of a book which, however, has never been published,
and which was to have been entitled: "My Examinations." It was
given to me by the Registrar himself, some time after the astonishing
denouement to this case, and is unique in judicial chronicles.</p>

<p>Here it is. It is not a mere dry transcription of questions and
answers, because the Registrar often intersperses his story with
his own personal comments.</p>

<em>THE REGISTRAR’S NARRATIVE</em>

</p>
</div>
<p>The examining magistrate and I (the writer relates) found ourselves
in "The Yellow Room" in the company of the builder who had constructed
the pavilion after Professor Stangerson’s designs. He had a workman
with him. Monsieur de Marquet had had the walls laid entirely
bare; that is to say, he had had them stripped of the paper which
had decorated them. Blows with a pick, here and there, satisfied
us of the absence of any sort of opening. The floor and the ceiling
were thoroughly sounded. We found nothing. There was nothing to
be found. Monsieur de Marquet appeared to be delighted and never
ceased repeating:</p>

<p>"What a case! What a case! We shall never know, you’ll see, how
the murderer was able to get out of this room!"</p>

<p>Then suddenly, with a radiant face, he called to the officer
in charge of the gendarmes.</p>

<p>"Go to the chateau," he said, "and request Monsieur Stangerson
and Monsieur Robert Darzac to come to me in the laboratory, also
Daddy Jacques; and let your men bring here the two concierges."</p>

<p>Five minutes later all were assembled in the laboratory. The
Chief of the Surete, who had arrived at the Glandier, joined us
at that moment. I was seated at Monsieur Stangerson’s desk ready
for work, when Monsieur de Marquet made us the following little
speech&mdash;as original as it was unexpected:</p>

<p>"With your permission, gentlemen&mdash;as examinations lead to nothing&mdash;we
will, for once, abandon the old system of interrogation. I will
not have you brought before me one by one, but we will all remain
here as we are, &mdash;Monsieur Stangerson, Monsieur Robert Darzac,
Daddy Jacques and the two concierges, the Chief of the Surete,
the Registrar, and myself. We shall all be on the same footing.
The concierges may, for the moment, forget that they have been
arrested. We are going to confer together. We are on the spot
where the crime was committed. We have nothing else to discuss
but the crime. So let us discuss it freely&mdash;intelligently or otherwise,
so long as we speak just what is in our minds. There need be no
formality or method since this won’t help us in any way."</p>

<p>Then, passing before me, he said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"What do you think of that, eh? What a scene! Could you have
thought of that? I’ll make a little piece out of it for the Vaudeville."
And he rubbed his hands with glee.</p>

<p>I turned my eyes on Monsieur Stangerson. The hope he had received
from the doctor’s latest reports, which stated that Mademoiselle
Stangerson might recover from her wounds, had not been able to
efface from his noble features the marks of the great sorrow that
was upon him. He had believed his daughter to be dead, and he
was still broken by that belief. His clear, soft, blue eyes expressed
infinite sorrow. I had had occasion, many times, to see Monsieur
Stangerson at public ceremonies, and from the first had been struck
by his countenance, which seemed as pure as that of a child&mdash;the
dreamy gaze with the sublime and mystical expression of the inventor
and thinker.</p>

<p>On those occasions his daughter was always to be seen either
following him or by his side; for they never quitted each other,
it was said, and had shared the same labours for many years. The
young lady, who was then five and thirty, though she looked no
more than thirty, had devoted herself entirely to science. She
still won admiration for her imperial beauty which had remained
intact, without a wrinkle, withstanding time and love. Who would
have dreamed that I should one day be seated by her pillow with
my papers, and that I should see her, on the point of death, painfully
recounting to us the most monstrous and most mysterious crime
I have heard of in my career? Who would have thought that I should
be, that afternoon, listening to the despairing father vainly
trying to explain how his daughter’s assailant had been able to
escape from him? Why bury ourselves with our work in obscure retreats
in the depths of woods, if it may not protect us against those
dangerous threats to life which meet us in the busy cities?</p>

<p>"Now, Monsieur Stangerson," said Monsieur de Marquet, with somewhat
of an important air, "place yourself exactly where you were when
Mademoiselle Stangerson left you to go to her chamber."</p>

<p>Monsieur Stangerson rose and, standing at a certain distance
from the door of "The Yellow Room", said, in an even voice and
without the least trace of emphasis&mdash;a voice which I can only
describe as a dead voice:</p>

<p>"I was here. About eleven o’clock, after I had made a brief chemical
experiment at the furnaces of the laboratory, needing all the
space behind me, I had my desk moved here by Daddy Jacques, who
spent the evening in cleaning some of my apparatus. My daughter
had been working at the same desk with me. When it was her time
to leave she rose, kissed me, and bade Daddy Jacques goodnight.
She had to pass behind my desk and the door to enter her chamber,
and she could do this only with some difficulty. That is to say,
I was very near the place where the crime occurred later."</p>

<p>"And the desk?" I asked, obeying, in thus mixing myself in the
conversation, the express orders of my chief, "as soon as you
heard the cry of ‘murder’ followed by the revolver shots, what
became of the desk?"</p>

<p>Daddy Jacques answered.</p>

<p>"We pushed it back against the wall, here&mdash;close to where it
is at the present moment&mdash;so as to be able to get at the door
at once."</p>

<p>I followed up my reasoning, to which, however, I attached but
little importance, regarding it as only a weak hypothesis, with
another question.</p>

<p>"Might not a man in the room, the desk being so near to the door,
by stooping and slipping under the desk, have left it unobserved?"</p>

<p>"You are forgetting," interrupted Monsieur Stangerson wearily,
"that my daughter had locked and bolted her door, that the door
had remained fastened, that we vainly tried to force it open when
we heard the noise, and that we were at the door while the struggle
between the murderer and my poor child was going on&mdash;immediately
after we heard her stifled cries as she was being held by the
fingers that have left their red mark upon her throat. Rapid as
the attack was, we were no less rapid in our endeavors to get
into the room where the tragedy was taking place."</p>

<p>I rose from my seat and once more examined the door with the
greatest care. Then I returned to my place with a despairing gesture.</p>

<p>"If the lower panel of the door," I said, "could be removed without
the whole door being necessarily opened, the problem would be
solved. But, unfortunately, that last hypothesis is untenable
after an examination of the door&mdash;it’s of oak, solid and massive.
You can see that quite plainly, in spite of the injury done in
the attempt to burst it open."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Daddy Jacques, "it is an old and solid door that
was brought from the chateau&mdash;they don’t make such doors now.
We had to use this bar of iron to get it open, all four of us&mdash;for
the concierge, brave woman she is, helped us. It pains me to find
them both in prison now."</p>

<p>Daddy Jacques had no sooner uttered these words of pity and protestation
than tears and lamentations broke out from the concierges. I never
saw two accused people crying more bitterly. I was extremely disgusted.
Even if they were innocent, I could not understand how they could
behave like that in the face of misfortune. A dignified bearing
at such times is better than tears and groans, which, most often,
are feigned.</p>

<p>"Now then, enough of that sniveling," cried Monsieur de Marquet;
"and, in your interest, tell us what you were doing under the
windows of the pavilion at the time your mistress was being attacked;
for you were close to the pavilion when Daddy Jacques met you."</p>

<p>"We were coming to help!" they whined.</p>

<p>"If we could only lay hands on the murderer, he’d never taste
bread again!" the woman gurgled between her sobs.</p>

<p>As before we were unable to get two connecting thoughts out of
them. They persisted in their denials and swore, by heaven and
all the saints, that they were in bed when they heard the sound
of the revolver shot.</p>

<p>"It was not one, but two shots that were fired! &mdash;You see,
you are lying. If you had heard one, you would have heard the
other."</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu! Monsieur&mdash;it was the second shot we heard. We were
asleep when the first shot was fired."</p>

<p>"Two shots were fired," said Daddy Jacques. "I am certain that
all the cartridges were in my revolver. We found afterward that
two had been exploded, and we heard two shots behind the door.
Was not that so, Monsieur Stangerson?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Professor, "there were two shots, one dull,
and the other sharp and ringing."</p>

<p>"Why do you persist in lying?" cried Monsieur de Marquet, turning
to the concierges. "Do you think the police are the fools you
are? Everything points to the fact that you were out of doors
and near the pavilion at the time of the tragedy. What were you
doing there? So far as I am concerned," he said, turning to Monsieur
Stangerson, "I can only explain the escape of the murderer on
the assumption of help from these two accomplices. As soon as
the door was forced open, and while you, Monsieur Stangerson,
were occupied with your unfortunate child, the concierge and his
wife facilitated the flight of the murderer, who, screening himself
behind them, reached the window in the vestibule, and sprang out
of it into the park. The concierge closed the window after him
and fastened the blinds, which certainly could not have closed
and fastened of themselves. That is the conclusion I have arrived
at. If anyone here has any other idea, let him state it."</p>

<p>Monsieur Stangerson intervened:</p>

<p>"What you say was impossible. I do not believe either in the
guilt or in the connivance of my concierges, though I cannot understand
what they were doing in the park at that late hour of the night.
I say it was impossible, because Madame Bernier held the lamp
and did not move from the threshold of the room; because I, as
soon as the door was forced open, threw myself on my knees beside
my daughter, and no one could have left or entered the room by
the door, without passing over her body and forcing his way by
me! Daddy Jacques and the concierge had but to cast a glance round
the chamber and under the bed, as I had done on entering, to see
that there was nobody in it but my daughter lying on the floor."</p>

<p>"What do you think, Monsieur Darzac?" asked the magistrate.</p>

<p>Monsieur Darzac replied that he had no opinion to express. Monsieur
Dax, the Chief of the Surete who, so far, had been listening and
examining the room, at length deigned to open his lips:</p>

<p>"While search is being made for the criminal, we had better try
to find out the motive for the crime; that will advance us a little,"
he said. Turning towards Monsieur Stangerson, he continued, in
the even, intelligent tone indicative of a strong character, "I
understand that Mademoiselle was shortly to have been married?"</p>

<p>The professor looked sadly at Monsieur Robert Darzac.</p>

<p>"To my friend here, whom I should have been happy to call my
son&mdash;to Monsieur Robert Darzac."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Stangerson is much better and is rapidly recovering
from her wounds. The marriage is simply delayed, is it not, Monsieur?" 
insisted the Chief of the Surete.</p>

<p>"I hope so.</p>

<p>"What! Is there any doubt about that?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Stangerson did not answer. Monsieur Robert Darzac seemed
agitated. I saw that his hand trembled as it fingered his watchchain.
Monsieur Dax coughed, as did Monsieur de Marquet. Both were evidently
embarrassed.</p>

<p>"You understand, Monsieur Stangerson," he said, "that in an affair
so perplexing as this, we cannot neglect anything; we must know
all, even the smallest and seemingly most futile thing concerning
the victim&mdash;information apparently the most insignificant. Why
do you doubt that this marriage will take place? You expressed
a hope; but the hope implies a doubt. Why do you doubt?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Stangerson made a visible effort to recover himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur," he said at length, "you are right. It will be
best that you should know something which, if I concealed it,
might appear to be of importance; Monsieur Darzac agrees with
me in this."</p>

<p>Monsieur Darzac, whose pallor at that moment seemed to me to
be altogether abnormal, made a sign of assent. I gathered he was
unable to speak.</p>

<p>"I want you to know then," continued Monsieur Stangerson, "that
my daughter has sworn never to leave me, and adheres firmly to
her oath, in spite of all my prayers and all that I have argued
to induce her to marry. We have known Monsieur Robert Darzac many
years. He loves my child; and I believed that she loved him; because
she only recently consented to this marriage which I desire with
all my heart. I am an old man, Monsieur, and it was a happy hour
to me when I knew that, after I had gone, she would have at her
side, one who loved her and who would help her in continuing our
common labours. I love and esteem Monsieur Darzac both for his
greatness of heart and for his devotion to science. But, two days
before the tragedy, for I know not what reason, my daughter declared
to me that she would never marry Monsieur Darzac."</p>

<p>A dead silence followed Monsieur Stangerson’s words. It was a
moment fraught with suspense.</p>

<p>"Did Mademoiselle give you any explanation,&mdash;did she tell you
what her motive was?" asked Monsieur Dax.</p>

<p>"She told me she was too old to marry&mdash;that she had waited too
long. She said she had given much thought to the matter and while
she had a great esteem, even affection, for Monsieur Darzac, she
felt it would be better if things remained as they were. She would
be happy, she said, to see the relations between ourselves and
Monsieur Darzac become closer, but only on the understanding that
there would be no more talk of marriage."</p>

<p>"That is very strange!" muttered Monsieur Dax.</p>

<p>"Strange!" repeated Monsieur de Marquet.</p>

<p>"You’ll certainly not find the motive there, Monsieur Dax," Monsieur
Stangerson said with a cold smile.</p>

<p>"In any case, the motive was not theft!" said the Chief impatiently.</p>

<p>"Oh! we are quite convinced of that!" cried the examining magistrate.</p>

<p>At that moment the door of the laboratory opened and the officer
in charge of the gendarmes entered and handed a card to the examining
magistrate. Monsieur de Marquet read it and uttered a half angry
exclamation:</p>

<p>"This is really too much!" he cried.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the Chief.</p>

<p>"It’s the card of a young reporter engaged on the ‘Epoque,’ a
Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille. It has these words written on it:
‘One of the motives of the crime was robbery.’"</p>

<p>The Chief smiled.</p>

<p>"Ah,&mdash;young Rouletabille &mdash;I’ve heard of him he is considered
rather clever. Let him come in."</p>

<p>Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille was allowed to enter. I had made
his acquaintance in the train that morning on the way to Epinay-sur-Orge.
He had introduced himself almost against my wish into our compartment.
I had better say at once that his manners, and the arrogance with
which he assumed to know what was incomprehensible even to us,
impressed him unfavourably on my mind. I do not like journalists.
They are a class of writers to be avoided as the pest. They think
that everything is permissible and they respect nothing. Grant
them the least favour, allow them even to approach you, and you
never can tell what annoyance they may give you. This one appears
to be scarcely twenty years old, and the effrontery with which
he dared to question us and discuss the matter with us made him
particularly obnoxious to me. Besides, he had a way of expressing
himself that left us guessing as to whether he was mocking us
or not. I know quite well that the ‘Epoque’ is an influential
paper with which it is well to be on good terms, but the paper
ought not to allow itself to be represented by sneaking reporters.</p>

<p>Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille entered the laboratory, bowed to
us, and waited for Monsieur de Marquet to ask him to explain his
presence.</p>

<p>"You pretend, Monsieur, that you know the motive for the crime,
and that that motive&mdash;in the face of all the evidence that has
been forthcoming&mdash;was robbery?"</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur, I do not pretend that. I do not say that robbery
was the motive for the crime, and I don’t believe it was."</p>

<p>"Then, what is the meaning of this card?"</p>

<p>"It means that robbery was one of the motives for the crime."</p>

<p>"What leads you to think that?"</p>

<p>"If you will be good enough to accompany me, I will show you."</p>

<p>The young man asked us to follow him into the vestibule, and
we did. He led us towards the lavatory and begged Monsieur de
Marquet to kneel beside him. This lavatory is lit by the glass
door, and, when the door was open, the light which penetrated
was sufficient to light it perfectly. Monsieur de Marquet and
Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille knelt down on the threshold, and
the young man pointed to a spot on the pavement.</p>

<p>"The stones of the lavatory have not been washed by Daddy Jacques
for some time," he said; "that can be seen by the layer of dust
that covers them. Now, notice here, the marks of two large footprints
and the black ash they left where they have been. That ash is
nothing else than the charcoal dust that covers the path along
which you must pass through the forest, in order to get directly
from Epinay to the Glandier. You know there is a little village
of charcoal-burners at that place, who make large quantities of
charcoal. What the murderer did was to come here at midday, when
there was nobody at the pavilion, and attempt his robbery."</p>

<p>"But what robbery? &mdash;Where do you see any signs of robbery?
What proves to you that a robbery has been committed?" we all
cried at once. "What put me on the trace of it," continued the
journalist...</p>

<p>"Was this?" interrupted Monsieur de Marquet, still on his knees.</p>

<p>"Evidently," said Rouletabille.</p>

<p>And Monsieur de Marquet explained that there were on the dust
of the pavement marks of two footsteps, as well as the impression,
freshly-made, of a heavy rectangular parcel, the marks of the
cord with which it had been fastened being easily distinguished.</p>

<p>"You have been here, then, Monsieur Rouletabille? I thought I
had given orders to Daddy Jacques, who was left in charge of the
pavilion, not to allow anybody to enter."</p>

<p>"Don’t scold Daddy Jacques, I came here with Monsieur Robert
Darzac."</p>

<p>"Ah, &mdash;Indeed!" exclaimed Monsieur de Marquet, disagreeably,
casting a side-glance at Monsieur Darzac, who remained perfectly
silent.</p>

<p>"When I saw the mark of the parcel by the side of the footprints,
I had no doubt as to the robbery," replied Monsieur Rouletabille.
"The thief had not brought a parcel with him; he had made one
here&mdash;a parcel with the stolen objects, no doubt; and he put it
in this corner intending to take it away when the moment came
for him to make his escape. He had also placed his heavy boots
beside the parcel,&mdash;for, see&mdash;there are no marks of steps leading
to the marks left by the boots, which were placed side by side.
That accounts for the fact that the murderer left no trace of
his steps when he fled from "The Yellow Room", nor any in the
laboratory, nor in the vestibule. After entering "The Yellow Room"
in his boots, he took them off, finding them troublesome, or because
he wished to make as little noise as possible. The marks made
by him in going through the vestibule and the laboratory were
subsequently washed out by Daddy Jacques. Having, for some reason
or other, taken off his boots, the murderer carried them in his
hand and placed them by the side of the parcel he had made,&mdash;by
that time the robbery had been accomplished. The man then returned
to "The Yellow Room" and slipped under the bed, where the mark
of his body is perfectly visible on the floor and even on the
mat, which has been slightly moved from its place and creased.
Fragments of straw also, recently torn, bear witness to the murderer’s
movements under the bed."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes,&mdash;we know all about that," said Monsieur de Marquet.</p>

<p>"The robber had another motive for returning to hide under the
bed,"  continued the astonishing boy-journalist. "You might think
that he was trying to hide himself quickly on seeing, through
the vestibule window, Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson about
to enter the pavilion. It would have been much easier for him
to have climbed up to the attic and hidden there, waiting for
an opportunity to get away, if his purpose had been only flight.
&mdash;No! No!&mdash;he had to be in "The Yellow Room"."</p>

<p>Here the Chief intervened.</p>

<p>"That’s not at all bad, young man. I compliment you. If we do
not know yet how the murderer succeeded in getting away, we can
at any rate see how he came in and committed the robbery. But
what did he steal?"</p>

<p>"Something very valuable," replied the young reporter.</p>

<p>At that moment we heard a cry from the laboratory. We rushed
in and found Monsieur Stangerson, his eyes haggard, his limbs
trembling, pointing to a sort of bookcase which he had opened,
and which, we saw, was empty. At the same instant he sank into
the large armchair that was placed before the desk and groaned,
the tears rolling down his cheeks, "I have been robbed again!
For God’s sake, do not say a word of this to my daughter. She
would be more pained than I am." He heaved a deep sigh and added,
in a tone I shall never forget: "After all, what does it matter,&mdash;so
long as she lives!"</p>

<p>"She will live!" said Monsieur Darzac, in a voice strangely touching.</p>

<p>"And we will find the stolen articles," said Monsieur Dax. "But
what was in the cabinet?"</p>

<p>"Twenty years of my life," replied the illustrious professor
sadly, "or rather of our lives&mdash;the lives of myself and my daughter!
Yes, our most precious documents, the records of our secret experiments
and our labours of twenty years were in that cabinet. It is an
irreparable loss to us and, I venture to say, to science. All
the processes by which I had been able to arrive at the precious
proof of the destructibility of matter were there&mdash;all. The man
who came wished to take all from me,&mdash;my daughter and my work&mdash;my
heart and my soul."</p>

<p>And the great scientist wept like a child.</p>

<p>We stood around him in silence, deeply affected by his great
distress. Monsieur Darzac pressed closely to his side, and tried
in vain to restrain his tears&mdash;a sight which, for the moment,
almost made me like him, in spite of an instinctive repulsion
which his strange demeanour and his inexplicable anxiety had inspired
me.</p>

<p>Monsieur Rouletabille alone,&mdash;as if his precious time and mission
on earth did not permit him to dwell in the contemplation on human
suffering&mdash;had, very calmly, stepped up to the empty cabinet and,
pointing at it, broke the almost solemn silence. He entered into
explanations, for which there was no need, as to why he had been
led to believe that a robbery had been committed, which included
the simultaneous discovery he had made in the lavatory, and the
empty precious cabinet in the laboratory. The first thing that
had struck him, he said, was the unusual form of that piece of
furniture. It was very strongly built of fire-proof iron, clearly
showing that it was intended for the keeping of most valuable
objects. Then he noticed that the key had been left in the lock.
"One does not ordinarily have a safe and leave it open!" he had
said to himself. This little key, with its brass head and complicated
wards, had strongly attracted him,&mdash;its presence had suggested
robbery.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Marquet appeared to be greatly perplexed, as if he
did not know whether he ought to be glad of the new direction
given to the inquiry by the young reporter, or sorry that it had
not been done by himself. In our profession and for the general
welfare, we have to put up with such mortifications and bury selfish
feelings. That was why Monsieur de Marquet controlled himself
and joined his compliments with those of Monsieur Dax. As for
Monsieur Rouletabille, he simply shrugged his shoulders and said:
"There’s nothing at all in that!" I should have liked to box his
ears, especially when he added: "You will do well, Monsieur, to
ask Monsieur Stangerson who usually kept that key?"</p>

<p>"My daughter," replied Monsieur Stangerson, "she was never without
it.</p>

<p>"Ah! then that changes the aspect of things which no longer corresponds
with Monsieur Rouletabille’s ideas!" cried Monsieur de Marquet.
"If that key never left Mademoiselle Stangerson, the murderer
must have waited for her in her room for the purpose of stealing
it; and the robbery could not have been committed until after
the attack had been made on her. But after the attack four persons
were in the laboratory! I can’t make it out!"</p>

<p>"The robbery," said the reporter, "could only have been committed
before the attack upon Mademoiselle Stangerson in her room. When
the murderer entered the pavilion he already possessed the brass-headed
key."</p>

<p>"That is impossible," said Monsieur Stangerson in a low voice.</p>

<p>"It is quite possible, Monsieur, as this proves."</p>

<p>And the young rascal drew a copy of the "Epoque" from his pocket,
dated the 21st of October (I recall the fact that the crime was
committed on the night between the 24th and 25th), and showing
us an advertisement, he read:</p>

<p>"‘Yesterday a black satin reticule was lost in the Grands Magasins
de la Louvre. It contained, amongst other things, a small key
with a brass head. A handsome reward will be given to the person
who has found it. This person must write, poste restante, bureau
40, to this address: M. A. T. H. S. N.’ Do not these letters suggest
Mademoiselle Stangerson?"  continued the reporter. "The ‘key with
a brass head’&mdash;is not this the key? I always read advertisements.
In my business, as in yours, Monsieur, one should always read
the personals.’ They are often the keys to intrigues, that are
not always brass-headed, but which are none the less interesting.
This advertisement interested me specially; the woman of the key
surrounded it with a kind of mystery. Evidently she valued the
key, since she promised a big reward for its restoration! And
I thought on these six letters: M. A. T. H. S. N. The first four
at once pointed to a Christian name; evidently I said Math is
Mathilde. But I could make nothing of the two last letters. So
I threw the journal aside and occupied myself with other matters.
Four days later, when the evening paper appeared with enormous
head-lines announcing the murder of Mademoiselle Stangerson, the
letters in the advertisement mechanically recurred to me. I had
forgotten the two last letters, S. N. When I saw them again I
could not help exclaiming, ‘Stangerson!’ I jumped into a cab and
rushed into the bureau No. 40, asking: ‘Have you a letter addressed
to M. A. T. H. S. N.?’ The clerk replied that he had not. I insisted,
begged and entreated him to search. He wanted to know if I were
playing a joke on him, and then told me that he had had a letter
with the initials M. A. T. H. S. N, but he had given it up three
days ago, to a lady who came for it. ‘You come to-day to claim
the letter, and the day before yesterday another gentleman claimed
it! I’ve had enough of this,’ he concluded angrily. I tried to
question him as to the two persons who had already claimed the
letter; but whether he wished to entrench himself behind professional
secrecy,&mdash;he may have thought that he had already said too much,&mdash;or
whether he was disgusted at the joke that had been played on him&mdash;he
would not answer any of my questions."</p>

<p>Rouletabille paused. We all remained silent. Each drew his own
conclusions from the strange story of the poste restante letter.
It seemed, indeed, that we now had a thread by means of which
we should be able to follow up this extraordinary mystery.</p>

<p>"Then it is almost certain," said Monsieur Stangerson, "that
my daughter did lose the key, and that she did not tell me of
it, wishing to spare any anxiety, and that she begged whoever
had found it to write to the poste restante. She evidently feared
that, by giving our address, inquiries would have resulted that
would have apprised me of the loss of the key. It was quite logical,
quite natural for her to have taken that course&mdash;for I have been
robbed once before."</p>

<p>"Where was that, and when?" asked the Chief of the Surete.</p>

<p>"Oh! many years ago, in America, in Philadelphia. There were
stolen from my laboratory the drawings of two inventions that
might have made the fortune of a man. Not only have I never learnt
who the thief was, but I have never heard even a word of the object
of the robbery, doubtless because, in order to defeat the plans
of the person who had robbed me, I myself brought these two inventions
before the public, and so rendered the robbery of no avail. From
that time on I have been very careful to shut myself in when I
am at work. The bars to these windows, the lonely situation of
this pavilion, this cabinet, which I had specially constructed,
this special lock, this unique key, all are precautions against
fears inspired by a sad experience."</p>

<p>"Most interesting!" remarked Monsieur Dax.</p>

<p>Monsieur Rouletabille asked about the reticule. Neither Monsieur
Stangerson nor Daddy Jacques had seen it for several days, but
a few hours later we learned from Mademoiselle Stangerson herself
that the reticule had either been stolen from her, or she had
lost it. She further corroborated all that had passed just as
her father had stated. She had gone to the poste restante and,
on the 23rd of October, had received a letter which, she affirmed,
contained nothing but a vulgar pleasantry, which she had immediately
burned.</p>

<p>To return to our examination, or rather to our conversation.
I must state that the Chief of the Surete having inquired of Monsieur
Stangerson under what conditions his daughter had gone to Paris
on the 20th of October, we learned that Monsieur Robert Darzac
had accompanied her, and Darzac had not been again seen at the
chateau from that time to the day after the crime had been committed.
The fact that Monsieur Darzac was with her in the Grands Magasins
de la Louvre when the reticule disappeared could not pass unnoticed,
and, it must be said, strongly awakened our interest.</p>

<p>This conversation between magistrates, accused, victim, witnesses
and journalist, was coming to a close when quite a theatrical
sensation&mdash;an incident of a kind displeasing to Monsieur de Marquet&mdash;was
produced. The officer of the gendarmes came to announce that Frederic
Larsan requested to be admitted,&mdash;a request that was at once complied
with. He held in his hand a heavy pair of muddy boots, which he
threw on the pavement of the laboratory.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, "are the boots worn by the murderer. Do you
recognise them, Daddy Jacques?"</p>

<p>Daddy Jacques bent over them and, stupefied, recognised a pair
of old boots which he had, some time back, thrown into a corner
of his attic. He was so taken aback that he could not hide his
agitation.</p>

<p>Then pointing to the handkerchief in the old man’s hand, Frederic
Larsan said:</p>

<p>"That’s a handkerchief astonishingly like the one found in "The
Yellow Room."</p>

<p>"I know," said Daddy Jacques, trembling, "they are almost alike."</p>

<p>"And then," continued Frederic Larsan, "the old Basque cap also
found in "The Yellow Room" might at one time have been worn by
Daddy Jacques himself. All this, gentlemen, proves, I think, that
the murderer wished to disguise his real personality. He did it
in a very clumsy way&mdash;or, at least, so it appears to us. Don’t
be alarmed, Daddy Jacques; we are quite sure that you were not
the murderer; you never left the side of Monsieur Stangerson.
But if Monsieur Stangerson had not been working that night and
had gone back to the chateau after parting with his daughter,
and Daddy Jacques had gone to sleep in his attic, no one would
have doubted that he was the murderer. He owes his safety, therefore,
to the tragedy having been enacted too soon,&mdash;the murderer, no
doubt, from the silence in the laboratory, imagined that it was
empty, and that the moment for action had come. The man who had
been able to introduce himself here so mysteriously and to leave
so many evidences against Daddy Jacques, was, there can be no
doubt, familiar with the house. At what hour exactly he entered,
whether in the afternoon or in the evening, I cannot say. One
familiar with the proceedings and persons of this pavilion could
choose his own time for entering "The Yellow Room"."</p>

<p>"He could not have entered it if anybody had been in the laboratory," 
said Monsieur de Marquet.</p>

<p>"How do we know that?" replied Larsan. "There was the dinner
in the laboratory, the coming and going of the servants in attendance.
There was a chemical experiment being carried on between ten and
eleven o’clock, with Monsieur Stangerson, his daughter, and Daddy
Jacques engaged at the furnace in a corner of the high chimney.
Who can say that the murderer&mdash;an intimate!&mdash;a friend!&mdash;did not
take advantage of that moment to slip into "The Yellow Room",
after having taken off his boots in the lavatory?"</p>

<p>"It is very improbable," said Monsieur Stangerson.</p>

<p>"Doubtless&mdash;but it is not impossible. I assert nothing. As to
the escape from the pavilion&mdash;that’s another thing, the most natural
thing in the world."</p>

<p>For a moment Frederic Larsan paused,&mdash;a moment that appeared
to us a very long time. The eagerness with which we awaited what
he was going to tell us may be imagined.</p>

<p>"I have not been in "The Yellow Room"," he continued, "but I
take it for granted that you have satisfied yourselves that he
could have left the room only by way of the door; it is by the
door, then, that the murderer made his way out. At what time?
At the moment when it was most easy for him to do so; at the moment
when it became most explainable&mdash;so completely explainable that
there can be no other explanation. Let us go over the moments
which followed after the crime had been committed. There was the
first moment, when Monsieur Stangerson and Daddy Jacques were
close to the door, ready to bar the way. There was the second
moment, during which Daddy Jacques was absent and Monsieur Stangerson
was left alone before the door. There was a third moment, when
Monsieur Stangerson was joined by the concierge. There was a fourth
moment, during which Monsieur Stangerson, the concierge and his
wife and Daddy Jacques were before the door. There was a fifth
moment, during which the door was burst open and "The Yellow Room"
entered. The moment at which the flight is explainable is the
very moment when there was the least number of persons before
the door. There was one moment when there was but one person,
&mdash;Monsieur Stangerson. Unless a complicity of silence on
the part of Daddy Jacques is admitted&mdash;in which I do not believe&mdash;the
door was opened in the presence of Monsieur Stangerson alone and
the man escaped.</p>

<p>"Here we must admit that Monsieur Stangerson had powerful reasons
for not arresting, or not causing the arrest of the murderer,
since he allowed him to reach the window in the vestibule and
closed it after him! &mdash;That done, Mademoiselle Stangerson,
though horribly wounded, had still strength enough, and no doubt
in obedience to the entreaties of her father, to refasten the
door of her chamber, with both the bolt and the lock, before sinking
on the floor. We do not know who committed the crime; we do not
know of what wretch Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson are the
victims, but there is no doubt that they both know! The secret
must be a terrible one, for the father had not hesitated to leave
his daughter to die behind a door which she had shut upon herself,&mdash;terrible
for him to have allowed the assassin to escape. For there is no
other way in the world to explain the murderer’s flight from "The
Yellow Room"!"</p>

<p>The silence which followed this dramatic and lucid explanation
was appalling. We all of us felt grieved for the illustrious professor,
driven into a corner by the pitiless logic of Frederic Larsan,
forced to confess the whole truth of his martyrdom or to keep
silent, and thus make a yet more terrible admission. The man himself,
a veritable statue of sorrow, raised his hand with a gesture so
solemn that we bowed our heads to it as before something sacred.
He then pronounced these words, in a voice so loud that it seemed
to exhaust him:</p>

<p>"I swear by the head of my suffering child that I never for an
instant left the door of her chamber after hearing her cries for
help; that that door was not opened while I was alone in the laboratory;
and that, finally, when we entered "The Yellow Room", my three
domestics and I, the murderer was no longer there! I swear I do
not know the murderer!"</p>

<p>Must I say it,&mdash;in spite of the solemnity of Monsieur Stangerson’s
words, we did not believe in his denial. Frederic Larsan had shown
us the truth and it was not so easily given up.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Marquet announced that the conversation was at an
end, and as we were about to leave the laboratory, Joseph Rouletabille
approached Monsieur Stangerson, took him by the hand with the
greatest respect, and I heard him say:</p>

<p>"I believe you, Monsieur."</p>

<p>I here close the citation which I have thought it my duty to
make from Monsieur Maleine’s narrative. I need not tell the reader
that all that passed in the laboratory was immediately and faithfully
reported to me by Rouletabille.</p>
