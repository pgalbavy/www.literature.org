<p>Monteith Sterry began drawing the mitten from his right hand
with the intention of using his revolver on the bear, when he
checked himself with the thought:</p>

<p>"Better to wait until I need it; the most of this excursion is
still before us."</p>

<p>The lumbering brute came to a stop, with his huge head turned,
and surveyed the approaching skaters. Had they attempted to flee,
or had they come to a halt, probably he would have started after
them. As it was he swung half-way round, so that his side was
exposed. He offered a fine target for Sterry's weapon, but the
young man still refrained from using it.</p>

<p>"It isn't well to go too near him," remarked Fred Whitney, seizing
the arm of his sister and drawing her toward the shore on the
left.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to," replied the bright-witted girl, "but if we
turn away from him too soon he will be able to head us off; he
mustn't suspect what we intend to do."</p>

<p>"There's sense in that," remarked Sterry, "but don't wait too
long."</p>

<p>The three were skating close together, with their eyes on the
big creature, who was watching them sharply.</p>

<p>"Now!" called Fred, in a low, quick voice.</p>

<p>He had not loosened his grip of his sister's arm, so that when
he made the turn she was forced to follow him. The moment was
well chosen, and the three swung to one side as if all were controlled
by the single impulse.</p>

<p>Bruin must have been astonished; for, while waiting for his supper
to drop into his arms, he saw it leaving him. With an angry growl
he began moving toward the laughing party.</p>

<p>The tinge of anxiety which Fred Whitney felt lasted but a moment.
He saw that they could skate faster than the bear could travel;
and, had it been otherwise, no cause for fear would have existed,
for, with the power to turn like a flash, it would have been the
easiest thing in the world to elude the efforts of the animal
to seize them.</p>

<p>They expected pursuit, and it looked for a minute as if they
were not to be disappointed. The animal headed in their direction
with no inconsiderable speed, but, with more intelligence than
his kind generally display, he abruptly stopped, turned aside,
and disappeared in the wood before it could be said the race had
really begun.</p>

<p>Jennie was the most disappointed of the three, for she had counted
upon an adventure worth the telling, and here it was nipped in
the bud. She expressed her regret.</p>

<p>"There's no helping it," said Monteith, "for I can think of no
inducement that will bring him back; but we have a good many miles
before us, and it isn't likely that he's the only bear in this
part of Maine."</p>

<p>"There's some consolation in that," she replied, leading the
way back toward the middle of the course; "if we see another,
don't be so abrupt with him."</p>

<p>The stream now broadened to nearly three times its ordinary extent,
so that it looked as if they were gliding over the bosom of some
lake lagoon instead of a small river. At the widest portion, and
from the furthest point on the right, twinkled a second light,
so far back among the trees that the structure from whence it
came was out of sight. They gave it little attention and kept
on.</p>

<p>Sterry took out his watch. The moonlight was so strong that he
saw the figures plainly. It lacked a few minutes of nine.</p>

<p>"And yonder is the mouth of Wild Man's Creek," said Fred; "we
have made pretty good speed."</p>

<p>"Nothing to boast of," replied Jennie; "if it were not for fear
of distressing mother, I would insist that we go ten or fifteen
miles further before turning back."</p>

<p>Since plenty of time was at command, they continued their easy
pace, passing over several long and comparatively straight stretches
of frozen water, around sharp bends, beyond another expansion
of the stream, in front of a couple of natural openings, and finally,
while it lacked considerable of ten o'clock, they rounded to in
front of a mass of gray towering rocks on the right bank of the
stream, and, skating close into shore, sat down on a bowlder which
obtruded several feet above the ice.</p>

<p>They were at the extremity of their excursion. These collective
rocks bore the name of Wolf Glen, the legend being that at some
time in the past a horde of wolves made their headquarters there,
and, when the winters were unusually severe, held the surrounding
country in what might be called a reign of terror. They had not
yet wholly disappeared, but little fear of them was felt.</p>

<p>The friends could not be called tired, though, after skating
fifteen miles, the rest on the stone was grateful.</p>

<p>They sat for half an hour chatting, laughing, and as merry as
when they started from home. The sky was still unclouded, but
the moon had passed beyond the zenith. A wall of shadow was thrown
out from one of the banks, except for occasional short distances,
where the course of the stream was directly toward or from the
orb.</p>

<p>When Sterry again glanced at his watch it was a few minutes past
ten. They had rested longer than any one suspected.</p>

<p>"Mother won't look for us before midnight," remarked Fred, "and
we can easily make it in that time."</p>

<p>"She was so anxious," said the sister, who, despite her light-heartedness,
was more thoughtful than her brother, "that I would like to please
her by getting back sooner than she expects."</p>

<p>"We have only to keep up this pace to do it," said Monteith,
"for we have been resting fully a half hour&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused abruptly. From some point in the wintry wilderness
came a dismal, resounding wail, apparently a mile distant.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Monteith, less accustomed to the Maine
woods than his companions.</p>

<p>"It is the cry of a wolf," replied Fred; "I have heard it many
times when hunting alone or with father."</p>

<p>"It isn't the most cheerful voice of the night," commented the
young Bostonian, who, as yet never dreamed of connecting it with
any peril to themselves. And then he sang:</p>

<p>  Yes, the war whoop of the Indian may produce a pleasant thrill  
When mellowed by the distance that one feels increasing still;  
And the shrilling of the whistle from the engine's brazen snout  
May have minor tones of music, though I never found it out.</p>

<p>The verse was hardly finished when the howl was repeated.</p>

<p>"It is hard to tell from what point it comes," observed Fred,
"but I think it is on the right shore as we go back."</p>

<p>"Do you imagine it is far from the river?" inquired Monteith.</p>

<p>"I think not, but I may be mistaken."</p>

<p>"I am quite sure Fred is right," said his sister; "and, more
than that, that particular wolf isn't a great way off. I wonder
whether he has scented our trail?"</p>

<p>Before any comment could be made upon this remark, a second,
third, fourth, and fully a half-dozen additional howls rang through
the forest arches. They came from the left shore, and apparently
were about as far off as the cry first heard.</p>

<p>"They are answers," said Fred, in a low voice, in which his companions
detected a slight tremor.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the first fear thrilled all three.
The cries might mean nothing, but more likely they meant a good
deal. The wolf is one of the fiercest of American wild animals
when suffering from hunger, though a coward at other times, and
a horde of them are capable of attacking the most formidable denizens
of the woods.</p>

<p>The fact that they were between the skaters and home, and at
no great distance from the course they must follow to reach there,
was cause for fear. It was almost certain that in some way the
keen-scented creatures had learned there was game afoot that night
for them, and they were signalling to each other to gather for
the feast.</p>

<p>Fred and Monteith were not specially frightened on their own
account, for, if the worst should come, they could take to the
trees and wait for help. They might make a sturdy fight, and perhaps,
with anything like a show, could get away from them without taking
to such a refuge.</p>

<p>But it was the presence of Jennie that caused the most misgiving.
True, she was as swift and skilful a skater as either, but that
of itself was not likely to save her.</p>

<p>But she was the coolest of all, now that the danger assumed a
reality.</p>

<p>The lightness and gayety that had marked the three from the moment
of leaving home had gone. They were thoughtful, the very opposite
in their mood to that of a few minutes before.</p>

<p>"I wish I had brought my pistol," said Fred.</p>

<p>"I have mine," observed Monteith; "a good Smith &amp; Wesson,
and each of the five chambers is loaded."</p>

<p>"Thank fortune for that; have you any extra cartridges?"</p>

<p>"Not one."</p>

<p>"Your pistol may be the means of saving us."</p>

<p>"Why do you speak that way?" asked Jennie; "I never knew you
were scared so easily."</p>

<p>"I am sorry you are with us, sister; my alarm is on your account."</p>

<p>"I do not see why I am not as safe as either of you; neither
can skate faster than I."</p>

<p>"If we are to escape by that means, your chances are as good
as ours; but those creatures have a fearful advantage over us,
because we must run the gauntlet."</p>

<p>"We are not so certain of that; if we hasten, we may pass the
danger-point before they discover us."</p>

<p>For the first time since leaving home the three did their best.
Separated from each other by just enough space to give play to
the limbs, they sped down the icy river with the fleetness of
the hurricane, their movements almost the perfect counterpart
of each other.</p>

<p>First on the right foot, they shot well toward the shore on that
side, then bending gracefully to the left, the weight was thrown
on that limb, the impetus being imparted to the body without any
apparent effort, after the manner of a master of the skater's
art. These, sweeping forward, were many rods in length, the polished
steel frequently giving out a metallic ring as it struck the flinty
ice. Now and then, too, a resounding creak sped past, and might
have alarmed them had they not understood its nature. It indicated
no weakness of the frozen surface, but was caused by the settling
of the crystal floor as the water flowed beneath.</p>

<p>For a few minutes these were the only noises that broke the impressive
stillness. The three had begun to hope that the ominous sounds
would be heard no more, and that the wolves were too far from
the river to discover them until beyond reach.</p>

<p>If they could once place themselves below the animals they need
not fear, for they could readily distance them. Should the speed
of the pursuers become dangerous, a sharp turn or change in the
course would throw them off and give the fugitives an advantage
that would last for a long time. But they dreaded the appearance
of a whole pack of the brutes in front, thus shutting off their
line of flight homeward. True, in that case they could turn about
and flee up stream, but the risk of encountering others attracted
by the cries would be great, and perhaps leave their only recourse
to a flight into the woods.</p>

<p>The thoughts of each turned to the nearest hunter's cabin, although
it was several miles distant, and probably beyond reach.</p>

<p>It was strange that, having emitted so many signals, the wolves
should become suddenly quiescent.</p>

<p>No one spoke, but as they glided swiftly forward they peered
along the gleaming surface in search of that which they dreaded
to see.</p>

<p>They approached one of those long, sweeping bends to which allusion
has been made. Jennie had already proven that neither of her companions
could outspeed her. They were doing their utmost, but she easily
held her own with less effort than they showed.</p>

<p>In truth, she was slightly in advance as they began following
the curve of the river, her head, like each of the others, bent
forward, to see whither they were going.</p>

<p>"They are there!"</p>

<p>It was she who uttered the exclamation which sent a thrill through
both. They asked for no explanation, for none was needed, and
an instant later they were at her side, she slightly slackening
her pace.</p>

<p>The sight, while alarming, was not all that Fred and Monteith
anticipated.</p>

<p>Three or four gaunt animals were trotting along the ice near
the left shore, but no others were visible.</p>

<p>"Keep in the middle while I take a turn that way," said Monteith,
sheering in the direction named.</p>

<p>Brother and sister did not read the meaning of this course, nor
could they detect its wisdom. But they obeyed without question.</p>

<p>Young Sterry hoped by making what might look like an attack upon
the famishing beasts to scare them off for a few minutes, during
which the three, and especially Jennie, could reach a point below
them. With the brutes thus thrown in the rear, it might be said
the danger would be over.</p>

<p>Now, as every one knows, the wolf is a sneak, and generally will
run from a child if it presents a bold front; but the animal becomes
very dangerous when pressed by hunger.</p>

<p>Monteith Sterry's reception was altogether different from what
he anticipated. When the half-dozen wolves saw him speeding toward
them they stopped their trotting, and, like the bear, looked around,
as not understanding what it meant.</p>

<p>"Confound them! Why don't they take to the woods?" he muttered.
He had removed the mitten from his right hand, which grasped his
revolver. "This isn't according to Hoyle."</p>

<p>He shied a little to the right, with a view of preventing a collision
with the creatures, and the moment he was close enough, let fly
with one chamber at the nearest.</p>

<p>Accidentally he nipped the wolf, which emitted a yelping bark,
leaped several feet in the air, then limped into the woods, as
he had learned enough of the interesting stranger.</p>

<p>That was just what the youth had hoped to do, and the success
of his scheme would have been perfect had the others imitated
their wounded companion, but they did not.</p>

<p>Without paying any attention to Sterry they broke into a gallop
toward the middle of the river, their course such as to place
them either in advance of Fred and Jennie Whitney or to bring
all together.</p>

<p>Greatly alarmed for his friends, Monteith did an unnecessary
thing by shouting (for the couple could not fail to see their
danger), and fired two more barrels of his pistol. Neither shot
took effect, nor did the wolves give them any heed, but they and
the skaters converged with perilous swiftness.</p>

<p>Forgetful of his own danger, Monteith shouted again:</p>

<p>"Look out! Why don't you change your course?"</p>

<p>Neither replied, but it was absurd for the panic-stricken youth
to suppose they did not understand the situation and were shaping
their movements accordingly.</p>

<p>Having observed the wolves as soon as Sterry, they never lost
sight of them for a second. Every action was watched, and the
curious proceeding noted the instant made.</p>

<p>Fred and Jennie continued gliding straight forward, as if they
saw them not, and a collision appeared inevitable. At the moment
when Monteith's heart stood still, the couple turned almost at
right angles to the left&mdash;that is, in exactly the opposite direction
from the course of the wolves&mdash;and in a second they were fifty
feet nearer that shore than the brutes. Then followed another
quick turn, and they were gliding with arrowy speed straight down
stream. They had simply passed around the animals, who, detecting
the trick, made their limbs rigid and slid over the ice, with
their claws scratching it, until able to check their speed to
allow them to turn and resume the pursuit.</p>

<p>Sterry was on the point of uttering a shout of exultation and
admiration at the clever manoeuvre, when Jennie cried out; and
well might she do so, for fifty yards beyond, and directly in
their path, the ice seemed suddenly to have become alive with
the frightful creatures, who streamed from the woods on both sides,
ravenous, fierce and unrestrainable in their eagerness to share
in the expected feast.</p>
