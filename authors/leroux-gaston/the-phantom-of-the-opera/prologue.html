<p><em>IN WHICH THE AUTHOR OF THIS SINGULAR WORK INFORMS THE READER
HOW HE ACQUIRED THE CERTAINTY THAT THE OPERA GHOST REALLY EXISTED</em></p>

<p>The Opera ghost really existed.  He was not, as was long believed,
a creature of the imagination of the artists, the superstition
of the managers, or a product of the absurd and impressionable
brains of the young ladies of the ballet, their mothers, the box-keepers,
the cloak-room attendants or the concierge.  Yes, he existed in
flesh and blood, although he assumed the complete appearance of
a real phantom; that is to say, of a spectral shade.</p>

<p>When I began to ransack the archives of the National Academy
of Music I was at once struck by the surprising coincidences between
the phenomena ascribed to the "ghost" and the most extraordinary
and fantastic tragedy that ever excited the Paris upper classes;
and I soon conceived the idea that this tragedy might reasonably
be explained by the phenomena in question.  The events do not
date more than thirty years back; and it would not be difficult
to find at the present day, in the foyer of the ballet, old men
of the highest respectability, men upon whose word one could absolutely
rely, who would remember as though they happened yesterday the
mysterious and dramatic conditions that attended the kidnapping
of Christine Daae, the disappearance of the Vicomte de Chagny
and the death of his elder brother, Count Philippe, whose body
was found on the bank of the lake that exists in the lower cellars
of the Opera on the Rue-Scribe side.  But none of those witnesses
had until that day thought that there was any reason for connecting
the more or less legendary figure of the Opera ghost with that
terrible story.</p>

<p>The truth was slow to enter my mind, puzzled by an inquiry that
at every moment was complicated by events which, at first sight,
might be looked upon as superhuman; and more than once I was within
an ace of abandoning a task in which I was exhausting myself in
the hopeless pursuit of a vain image.  At last, I received the
proof that my presentiments had not deceived me, and I was rewarded
for all my efforts on the day when I acquired the certainty that
the Opera ghost was more than a mere shade.</p>

<p>On that day, I had spent long hours over <em>THE MEMOIRS OF A
MANAGER, </em>the light and frivolous work of the too-skeptical
Moncharmin, who, during his term at the Opera, understood nothing
of the mysterious behavior of the ghost and who was making all
the fun of it that he could at the very moment when he became
the first victim of the curious financial operation that went
on inside the "magic envelope."</p>

<p>I had just left the library in despair, when I met the delightful
acting-manager of our National Academy, who stood chatting on
a landing with a lively and well-groomed little old man, to whom
he introduced me gaily.  The acting-manager knew all about my
investigations and how eagerly and unsuccessfully I had been trying
to discover the whereabouts of the examining magistrate in the
famous Chagny case, M. Faure.  Nobody knew what had become of
him, alive or dead; and here he was back from Canada, where he
had spent fifteen years, and the first thing he had done, on his
return to Paris, was to come to the secretarial offices at the
Opera and ask for a free seat.  The little old man was M. Faure
himself.</p>

<p>We spent a good part of the evening together and he told me the
whole Chagny case as he had understood it at the time.  He was
bound to conclude in favor of the madness of the viscount and
the accidental death of the elder brother, for lack of evidence
to the contrary; but he was nevertheless persuaded that a terrible
tragedy had taken place between the two brothers in connection
with Christine Daae.  He could not tell me what became of Christine
or the viscount.  When I mentioned the ghost, he only laughed. 
He, too, had been told of the curious manifestations that seemed
to point to the existence of an abnormal being, residing in one
of the most mysterious corners of the Opera, and he knew the story
of the envelope; but he had never seen anything in it worthy of
his attention as magistrate in charge of the Chagny case, and
it was as much as he had done to listen to the evidence of a witness
who appeared of his own accord and declared that he had often
met the ghost.  This witness was none other than the man whom
all Paris called the "Persian" and who was well-known to every
subscriber to the Opera. The magistrate took him for a visionary.</p>

<p>I was immensely interested by this story of the Persian.  I wanted,
if there were still time, to find this valuable and eccentric
witness.  My luck began to improve and I discovered him in his
little flat in the Rue de Rivoli, where he had lived ever since
and where he died five months after my visit.  I was at first
inclined to be suspicious; but when the Persian had told me, with
child-like candor, all that he knew about the ghost and had handed
me the proofs of the ghost's existence&mdash;including the strange
correspondence of Christine Daae&mdash;to do as I pleased with, I was
no longer able to doubt.  No, the ghost was not a myth!</p>

<p>I have, I know, been told that this correspondence may have been
forged from first to last by a man whose imagination had certainly
been fed on the most seductive tales; but fortunately I discovered
some of Christine's writing outside the famous bundle of letters
and, on a comparison between the two, all my doubts were removed. 
I also went into the past history of the Persian and found that
he was an upright man, incapable of inventing a story that might
have defeated the ends of justice.</p>

<p>This, moreover, was the opinion of the more serious people who,
at one time or other, were mixed up in the Chagny case, who were
friends of the Chagny family, to whom I showed all my documents
and set forth all my inferences.  In this connection, I should
like to print a few lines which I received from General D&#11834;:</p>

<p><em>SIR</em>:</p>

<p>I can not urge you too strongly to publish the results of your
inquiry. I remember perfectly that, a few weeks before the disappearance
of that great singer, Christine Daae, and the tragedy which threw
the whole of the Faubourg Saint-Germain into mourning, there was
a great deal of talk, in the foyer of the ballet, on the subject
of the "ghost;" and I believe that it only ceased to be discussed
in consequence of the later affair that excited us all so greatly. 
But, if it be possible&mdash;as, after hearing you, I believe&mdash;to explain
the tragedy through the ghost, then I beg you sir, to talk to
us about the ghost again.</p>

<p>Mysterious though the ghost may at first appear, he will always
be more easily explained than the dismal story in which malevolent
people have tried to picture two brothers killing each other who
had worshiped each other all their lives.</p>

<p>Believe me, etc.</p>

<p>Lastly, with my bundle of papers in hand, I once more went over
the ghost's vast domain, the huge building which he had made his
kingdom. All that my eyes saw, all that my mind perceived, corroborated
the Persian's documents precisely; and a wonderful discovery crowned
my labors in a very definite fashion.  It will be remembered that,
later, when digging in the substructure of the Opera, before burying
the phonographic records of the artist's voice, the workmen laid
bare a corpse.  Well, I was at once able to prove that this corpse
was that of the Opera ghost.  I made the acting-manager put this
proof to the test with his own hand; and it is now a matter of
supreme indifference to me if the papers pretend that the body
was that of a victim of the Commune.</p>

<p>The wretches who were massacred, under the Commune, in the cellars
of the Opera, were not buried on this side; I will tell where
their skeletons can be found in a spot not very far from that
immense crypt which was stocked during the siege with all sorts
of provisions.  I came upon this track just when I was looking
for the remains of the Opera ghost, which I should never have
discovered but for the unheard-of chance described above.</p>

<p>But we will return to the corpse and what ought to be done with
it. For the present, I must conclude this very necessary introduction
by thanking M. Mifroid (who was the commissary of police called
in for the first investigations after the disappearance of Christine
Daae), M. Remy, the late secretary, M. Mercier, the late acting-manager,
M. Gabriel, the late chorus-master, and more particularly Mme.
la Baronne de Castelot-Barbezac, who was once the "little Meg"
of the story (and who is not ashamed of it), the most charming
star of our admirable corps de ballet, the eldest daughter of
the worthy Mme. Giry, now deceased, who had charge of the ghost's
private box.  All these were of the greatest assistance to me;
and, thanks to them, I shall be able to reproduce those hours
of sheer love and terror, in their smallest details, before the
reader's eyes.</p>

<p>And I should be ungrateful indeed if I omitted, while standing
on the threshold of this dreadful and veracious story, to thank
the present management the Opera, which has so kindly assisted
me in all my inquiries, and M. Messager in particular, together
with M. Gabion, the acting-manager, and that most amiable of men,
the architect intrusted with the preservation of the building,
who did not hesitate to lend me the works of Charles Garnier,
although he was almost sure that I would never return them to
him.  Lastly, I must pay a public tribute to the generosity of
my friend and former collaborator, M. J. Le Croze, who allowed
me to dip into his splendid theatrical library and to borrow the
rarest editions of books by which he set great store.</p>
