<p>A few degrees south of the equator, the schooner <em>Coral</em>
ran into a tempest of such fury that with all the skilful seamanship
of her captain and crew, and the admirable qualities of the schooner
itself, she narrowly escaped foundering.</p>

<p>There were two days when she was in such imminent peril that
not an eye was closed in slumber, excepting in the case of little
Inez Hawthorne, who felt the situation only to the extent that
it compelled her to stay close in the cabin, while the vessel
pitched and tossed from the crest of one tremendous billow, down,
seemingly, into the fathomless depths between, and then laboriously
climbed the mountain in front, with the spray and mist whirling
about the deck and rigging like millions of fine shot. But the
gallant <em>Coral</em> rode it out safely, and the steady breeze
caught her and she sped swiftly in the direction of the Pearl
Islands.</p>

<p>The little girl had run hither and thither, until, tired out,
she had flung herself upon the berth in the cabin, where she was
sleeping soundly, while the captain was doing the same; Abe Storms,
the mate, being on deck at the wheel. It was yet early in the
evening, and Hyde Brazzier and Alfredo Redvignez were sitting
close together, forward, smoking their pipes and conversing in
low tones. The breeze was almost directly abeam, so that the sails
carried the craft along at a rapid rate, the water foaming and
curling from the bow, while the rising and sinking of the schooner
on the enormous swells were at such long intervals as almost to
be imperceptible. As far as the eye could extend in every direction,
no glimpse of a sail or light could be perceived, nor had any
been observed through the day, which confirmed what Bill Grebbens,
the sailor in the Boston hospital, said, to the effect that, despite
the location of the Paumotu Islands, the approach to them from
the direction of California took one in a section where the sails
of commerce were rarely seen.</p>

<p>The captain and mate had been consulting their chart, and had
taken their reckoning more frequently and with greater care than
ever before. The conclusion at which they arrived was that they
were already south of the northernmost island of the Paumotu group,
and were close to the Coral Island, along whose shore were to
be found the precious pearls which were to make them all, or rather
the two, wealthy.</p>

<p>"It's a curious business," reflected Abe Storms, while holding
the wheel motionless. "When I consider the matter fairly, I don't
see why the expedition should not succeed. But it is so different
from the coasting business, in which the captain and I have been
engaged for years, that it is hard to believe we're going to make
anything out of it."</p>

<p>He listened a minute to the murmur of the voices forward, and
then he added, pursuing the same train of thought:</p>

<p>"What an extraordinary thing it is that we should have this little
girl for a passenger! Suppose we carry her back to Tokio after
this pearl hunt, and fail to find her parents?"</p>

<p>He took but a minute to consider the question, when he answered:</p>

<p>"It can never make any difference to Inez herself, for her sweet
face and winning ways will secure her a welcome and a home in
a hundred different places."</p>

<p>While the mate was indulging in these fancies and reveries, Brazzier
and Redvignez were holding an important conference forward.</p>

<p>"I'm sure we won't have much further to sail," observed the Spaniard,
with a slightly broken accent. "We're in the latitude of the Paumotus."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been there?" asked his companion.</p>

<p>"No; but I know something about them, and then you had a glimpse
of the chart, which they're continually looking at, and I'm certain
from what you said that the particular spot we're after isn't
far off."</p>

<p>"I conclude you're right, more from the way they're acting than
anything else. I wish I could get hold of that chart."</p>

<p>"What would you do?" asked Redvignez, with a significant side-glance
at his companion.</p>

<p>"What would I do? Why, I wouldn't wait&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"I don't see as it will make much difference," said the other,
in the most matter-of-fact voice, as he coolly puffed his pipe.
"We might as well take them there and make sure of the spot, before
we knock them in the head."</p>

<p>Brazzier gave a contemptuous sniff and a vicious puff of his
pipe, and remarked:</p>

<p>"Did you ever see two such fools, Redvig?" He continued, with
mock solemnity: "Beware of the temptations of wealth. Behold those
two specimens, who have come all the way from Boston to fish for
pearls in the Paumotu Islands. Some old sailor had the secret,
and told the captain about it, and he has told his friend, and
they have formed a partnership and hired us to go with them to
dredge up the oysters."</p>

<p>"What is there so foolish in all that?" asked the Spaniard, with
a grin, which showed his white teeth in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"Nothing; for you or I would have done the same had we been placed
in their shoes. But we would have shown more sense than they.
They believe we do not suspect what their business is; and yet
we both understand the whole thing. Here we are within a few hours'
sail of the spot, and what's to be done?"</p>

<p>The Spaniard indulged in a light laugh, and replied:</p>

<p>"To think that we should consent to take twenty-five dollars
a month, while they scooped in their thousands&mdash;their millions&mdash;it
strikes me sometimes as the greatest joke I ever heard. But, Brazzier,
the best plan is for us to be good boys, and go on to the island
and help take up the pearls; for then we shall be sure of the
right spot, and there shall be no mistake; whereas, if we should
take possession now, we might miss the place, even with the help
of the chart."</p>

<p>"I don't know but what you're right, Redvig, though it galls
me to wait. You know a lot of us took charge of the <em>Spitfire</em>,
and set the captain and first-mate adrift, off Valparaiso. You
were in favor of waiting, and it was well if we had done so, for
we came nearer running our necks into the halter that time than
we ever did since, and there wasn't anything aboard the old hulk
that was worth the saving."</p>

<p>"But what about Pomp?" asked Redvig, in a half-whisper, and with
an accent which showed that he considered the question of the
highest importance. "Is he all right?"</p>

<p>"You needn't have any fear about him. I had a long talk with
him last night, and we shook hands on the question."</p>

<p>The negro was an important factor in this business, for, a giant
in stature and strength, whichever side he precipitated himself
and his prowess upon was sure to win&mdash;judging from the ordinary
human standpoint.</p>

<p>Pomp, as we have hinted further back, was not an African with
a perfectly clear record. The rumors about his belonging to a
gang of river pirates in San Francisco were correct, and he had
been engaged in some deeds which were of a character that the
law puts the severest ban upon. He was known to be daring, and
possessed such prodigious power, united to activity, that, beyond
a doubt, if he were placed upon an even footing, he could have
conquered the captain, mate and the two sailors, without any special
effort upon his own part.</p>

<p>The importance of his declaring himself can therefore be understood.
He was a far better man than either of the two Caucasians, who
hesitated about approaching him. As it had to be done, however,
the matter was skilfully broached, after they had left San Francisco
and were sailing southward.</p>

<p>It was agreed by the two mutineers that, if the negro held off,
he was to be gotten rid of by some treachery, though it was such
a serious matter that they hesitated long as to how it could be
safely accomplished. To their surprise and delight, however, Pomp
listened eagerly to the project and expressed his willingness
to go into it, though he insisted there should be no murdering
done, as he was not base enough at heart to wish the death of
either of the officers.</p>

<p>Brazzier consented; but in doing so he deceived the negro. A
mutiny, such as he contemplated, could never be carried to a successful
conclusion without disposing finally and forever of the two officers
themselves. If they should be spared, the mutineers would never
be safe. But Pomp was misled from the first, because it was believed
he could be won over before the time came to strike the blow.
Redvignez set himself very skilfully to do so, for Pomp was ignorant
and exceedingly greedy for wealth. Redvignez began by telling
him of a large number of fictitious mutinies, in which the mutineers
had made their fortunes and lived happy and respected afterwards,
and the narrator made certain to impress upon the African the
fact that the job was rendered a perfect one by following out
the proverb that dead men tell no tales. Then he incidentally
mentioned others in which the mutineers came to grief, all from
the fact that they allowed themselves to be controlled by a foolish
sentiment of mercy. The evil seed thus sown did not fail to take
root and bring forth its fruit, just as the sower intended.</p>

<p>These little incidents were multiplied, and by-and-by Pomp was
told that there was but one way in which to secure the enormous
riches that lay in the little bay in the South Seas, awaiting
their coming, and that was by making themselves complete masters
of the situation. The negro could not mistake the meaning of this,
and, after a feeble opposition, he gave his assent, and said he
would help carry out the terrible programme, as it had been arranged
from the first.</p>

<p>It was certainly very curious how the coming of little Inez Hawthorne
upon the ship threatened for awhile to disarrange every plan;
but so it was. There was a time when the better nature of the
two evil men asserted itself, and they began to consider the question
in the light of their awakened consciences; but these divine monitors
were only roused into temporary wakefulness and speedily dropped
asleep again. The manifest distrust which Inez showed toward them
seemed to fill their hearts with the most atrocious feelings,
and neither of them would have hesitated to fling her overboard,
had the opportunity been given. Incredible as it may seem, it
is the fact that they would have preferred to do so, being restrained
by the simple question of policy. They saw that Pomp had grown
very fond of her, and any such action on their part might alienate
him&mdash;a catastrophe which they were anxious to avert above everything
else.</p>

<p>"You say he shook hands with you upon it?" repeated Redvignez.
"What does all that mean?"</p>

<p>"It means that he is with us heart and soul. He sees the necessity
of putting the captain and mate out of the way, and he will help
do it."</p>

<p>"But what about the little girl&mdash;the viper?"</p>

<p>"It was a bad thing for us, Redvig, when we played that little
trick, for I have been ready to despair more than once, but the
remedy is so simple that I wonder we have not thought of it before."</p>

<p>"How is that?"</p>

<p>"We will spare her, for Pomp gave me to understand that on no
other conditions would he go into it. She will be a pleasant playmate
for him, and will help keep him true to us. She is so young and
simple-hearted that we can make her believe that some accident
has befallen the other two, by which they came to their death,
so there will be no danger from anything she ever can tell. When
we have gathered in all the pearls we will set sail for South
America. At Valparaiso or some of the ports we will place the
girl in some convent or school, with enough money to take care
of her, and then we will land at another port, sell the schooner,
divide up the proceeds and separate, each taking a different route
home, if we choose to go there, and then all we'll have to do,
Redvig, is to enjoy the wealth which shall be ours."</p>

<p>"How much do you think it will be?" asked the Spaniard, with
sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>"There is no telling," was the reply. "I hardly dare think, but
I know it runs into the hundreds of thousands, and it is not at
all impossible that it touches the millions."</p>

<p>Redvignez drew a deep breath and his heart gave a great throb,
as would be the case with the most phlegmatic being who contemplated
the near possession of such vast wealth. Visions of the wild round
of dissipation and excesses in which they would indulge came up
before the two evil men, and it was no wonder that they were impatient
for the hour to come when they should strike the blow for the
prize. Like the officers, they were so full of the scheme that
they had no desire to sleep; and while the figure of Mr. Storms
was visible at the wheel, and the <em>Coral</em> sped on to the
southward over the calm, moonlit sea, these two men talked about
and agreed upon the particulars of the frightful crime which had
been in their hearts, as may be said, from the moment they hoisted
sail and passed out of San Francisco harbor.</p>
