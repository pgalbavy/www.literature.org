<p>Meanwhile, Lieutenant Fred Godfrey found himself mixed up in
some events of a stirring character.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that while hunting for his friends he was
told that they had taken to a flat-boat, or scow, and were probably
across the Susquehanna.</p>

<p>If such were the fact, the true course for Fred was to follow
them without a second's delay.</p>

<p>His informant no doubt meant to tell the truth, but he had given
a wrong impression.</p>

<p>It was true, as has been shown, that the female members of the
Brainerd family had started across the river under charge of the
herculean Gravity Gimp, but Mr. Brainerd himself was still on
the side where the battle took place, though his son believed
he was with the others that had taken to the boat.</p>

<p>Fred was making his way as best he could to the river side, when
he became aware that he had attracted the notice of several Indians,
who made for him. In the general flurry he did not notice the
alarming fact till the party was almost upon him. Then he turned
and fired among them, threw away his gun, and made for the river
at the top of his speed.</p>

<p>He was remarkably fleet of foot, and in a fair race would have
held his own with any Iroquois in Wyoming Valley; but there was
no telling when or where some more of the dusky foes would leap
up and join in the pursuit.</p>

<p>It was fortunate, perhaps, that the Susquehanna was so near,
for the pursuit was no more than fairly begun when it was reached.
Knowing he would be compelled to swim for life, he ran as far
out in the water as he could, and then took what may be called
a tremendous "header," throwing himself horizontally through the
air, but with his head a little lower than the rest of the body,
and with his arms extended and hands pressed palm to palm in front.</p>

<p>He struck the water at a point beyond his depth, and drawing
in one deep inspiration as he went beneath, he swam with might
and main until he could hold his breath no longer.</p>

<p>When he rose to the surface it was a long way beyond where he
went under, and much farther than where the Indians were looking
for him to reappear.</p>

<p>But they were ready with cocked guns, and the moment the head
came to view they opened fire; but Fred expected that, and waiting
only long enough to catch a mouthful of air, he went under and
sped along like a loon beneath the surface.</p>

<p>Every rod thus gained increased his chances, but it did not by
any means remove the danger, for it takes no very skillful marksman
to pick off a man across the Susquehanna, and many a fugitive
on that fateful day fell after reaching the eastern shore.</p>

<p>Working with his usual energy, Fred Godfrey soon found himself
close to Monocacy Island, covered as it was with driftwood and
undergrowth, and upon which many of the settlers had taken refuge.</p>

<p>Almost the first person whom he recognized was the middle-aged
friend, who told him about the escape of the Brainerd family in
the scow that Maggie and the servant had propelled across the
Susquehanna.</p>

<p>This friend was now able to add that he had seen them crossing
at a point considerably below the island. He saw them fired at
by the Indians and Tories on shore, but he was satisfied that
no one of the little company was struck.</p>

<p>To the dismay of the youth, the neighbor assured him that Mr.
Brainerd, his father, was not with the company.</p>

<p>This made another change in the plans of the son. Quite hopeful
that those who had crossed the river were beyond danger, his whole
solicitude was now for his beloved parent. Despite the danger
involved, he resolved to return to the western shore, and to stay
there until he learned about his parent.</p>

<p>Fred was too experienced, however, to act rashly. He carefully
watched his chance and swam down the stream until he was well
below the swarm of fugitives, and so managed to reach the shore
without detection, or rather without recognition, since it was
impossible that he should escape observation.</p>

<p>Finally, he stepped out of the water and went up the bank, without,
as he believed, attracting attention, and, suppressing all haste,
walked in the direction of Forty Fort.</p>

<p>The battle-field, whereon the famous monument was afterwards
erected, was about two miles above Forty Fort, where a feeble
garrison was left when Colonel Zebulon Butler marched up the river
bank, and met the Tories and Indians on that July afternoon.</p>

<p>Fred had landed at a point near the battle-ground, and he was
in doubt whether to make search through the surrounding wood and
marsh, or to steal down the river to the fort in the hope of finding
his father there.</p>

<p>Many of the fugitives in their wild flight had thrown away their
weapons (as indeed Fred Godfrey himself had done), so that it
was an easy matter for him to find a gun to take the place of
the one from which he had parted.</p>

<p>The youth made up his mind to visit the fort, and he had taken
a dozen steps in that direction, when with whom should he come
face to face but his beloved father himself?</p>

<p>The meeting was a happy one indeed, the two embracing with delight.</p>

<p>The father had no thought that his son had reached Wyoming, though
he knew that Washington had been asked to send them re-enforcements.</p>

<p>Fred told the good news about the rest of the family: it was
joy indeed to the parent, who was on his way to the river bank
to look for them at the time he met his son.</p>

<p>Mr. Brainerd said that he had fought as long as there was any
hope, when he turned and fled with the rest. It was the same aimless
effort to get away, without any thought of the right course to
take; but he was more fortunate than most of the others, for he
succeeded in reaching the cover of the woods without harm.</p>

<p>"The best thing for us to do," said the parent, "is to go up
the river so as to get above the point where, it seems, the most
danger threatens."</p>

<p>"You mean toward Fort Wintermoot&mdash;that is, where it stood, for
I see that it has been burned."</p>

<p>"Yes, but we needn't go the whole distance; night isn't far off,
and it will be a hard task to find the folks after we get across."</p>

<p>Accordingly, father and son moved to the north, that is up the
western bank of the river. This took them toward Fort Wintermoot,
which was still smoking, and toward Fort Jenkins, just above.
At the same time they were leaving the scene of the struggle a
short time before.</p>

<p>Mr. Brainerd had no weapon, while his son carried the newly-found
rifle and his two pistols. He had drawn the charges of these and
reloaded them, so that they were ready for use.</p>

<p>"There's one thing that ought to be understood," said Mr. Brainerd,
after they had walked a short distance; "and that is what is to
be done by the survivor in case one of us falls."</p>

<p>"If I should be shot or captured," said Fred, impressively, "don't
waste any time in trying to help me, but do all you can to get
across the river, rejoin the family, and push on toward Stroudsburg;
for I don't believe you'll be safe at any point this side."</p>

<p>"I promise you to do my utmost in that direction; and, if it
should be my misfortune to fall into their hands, you must not
imperil your life for me."</p>

<p>"I shall be careful of what I do," said Fred, refusing to make
any more definite pledge, after having secured that of his companion
not to step aside to befriend him in the event of misfortune.</p>

<p>Little did either dream that the test was so close at hand.</p>
