<P>Two days after the meeting with the <I>Iroquois</I>, the <I>Dolphin</I> found
herself abreast of the Bermudas, where she was assailed by a violent squall.
These isles are frequently visited by hurricanes, and are celebrated for
shipwrecks. It is here that Shakespeare has placed the exciting scene of his
drama, <I>The Tempest</I>, in which Ariel and Caliban dispute for the empire of
the floods.</P>
<P>The squall was frightful; James Playfair thought once of running for one of
the Bermudas, where the English had a military post: it would have been a sad
waste of time, and therefore especially to be regretted; happily the
<I>Dolphin</I> behaved herself wonderfully well in the storm, and, after flying
a whole day before the tempest, she was able to resume her course towards the
American coast.</P>
<P>But if James Playfair had been pleased with his ship, he had not been less
delighted with the young girl&apos;s bravery; Miss Halliburtt had passed the worst
hours of the storm at his side, and James knew that a profound, imperious,
irresistible love had taken possession of his whole being.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said he, &quot;this brave girl is mistress on board; she turns me like the
sea a ship in distress &mdash; I feel that I am foundering! What will Uncle Vincent
say? Ah! poor nature, I am sure that if Jenny asked me to throw all this cursed
cargo into the sea, I should do it without hesitating, for love of her.&quot;</P>
<P>Happily for the firm of Playfair &amp; Co., Miss Halliburtt did not demand
this sacrifice; nevertheless, the poor Captain had been taken captive, and
Crockston, who read his heart like an open book, rubbed his hands gleefully.</P>
<P>&quot;We will hold him fast!&quot; he muttered to himself, &quot;and before a week has
passed my master will be quietly installed in one of the best cabins of the
<I>Dolphin</I>.&quot;</P>
<P>As for Miss Jenny, did she perceive the feelings which she inspired? Did she
allow herself to share them? No one could say, and James Playfair least of all;
the young girl kept a perfect reserve, and her secret remained deeply buried in
her heart.</P>
<P>But whilst love was making such progress in the heart of the young Captain,
the <I>Dolphin</I> sped with no less rapidity towards Charleston.</P>
<P>On the 13th of January, the watch signalled land ten miles to the west. It
was a low-lying coast, and almost blended with the line of the sea in the
distance. Crockston was examining the horizon attentively, and about nine
o&apos;clock in the morning he cried:</P>
<P>&quot;Charleston lighthouse!&quot;</P>
<P>Now that the bearings of the <I>Dolphin</I> were set, James Playfair had but
one thing to do, to decide by which channel he would run into Charleston
Bay.</P>
<P>&quot;If we meet with no obstacles,&quot; said he, &quot;before three o&apos;clock we shall be in
safety in the docks of the port.&quot;</P>
<P>The town of Charleston is situated on the banks of an estuary seven miles
long and two broad, called Charleston Harbour, the entrance to which is rather
difficult. It is enclosed between Morris Island on the south and Sullivan Island
on the north. At the time when the <I>Dolphin</I> attempted to force the
blockade Morris Island already belonged to the Federal troops, and General
Gillmore had caused batteries to be erected overlooking the harbour. Sullivan
Island, on the contrary, was in the hands of the Confederates, who were also in
possession of Moultrie Fort, situated at the extremity of the island; therefore
it would be advantageous to the <I>Dolphin</I> to go as close as possible to the
northern shores to avoid the firing from the forts on Morris Island.</P>
<P>Five channels led into the estuary, Sullivan Island Channel, the Northern
Channel, the Overall Channel, the Principal Channel, and lastly, the Lawford
Channel; but it was useless for strangers, unless they had skilful pilots on
board, or ships drawing less than seven feet of water, to attempt this last; as
for Northern and Overall Channels, they were in range of the Federalist
batteries, so that it was no good thinking of them. If James Playfair could have
had his choice, he would have taken his steamer through the Principal Channel,
which was the best, and the bearings of which were easy to follow; but it was
necessary to yield to circumstances, and to decide according to the event.
Besides, the Captain of the <I>Dolphin</I> knew perfectly all the secrets of
this bay, its dangers, the depths of its water at low tide, and its currents, so
that he was able to steer his ship with the greatest safety as soon as he
entered one of these narrow straits. The great question was to get there.</P>
<P>Now this work demanded an experienced seaman, and one who knew exactly the
qualities of the <I>Dolphin</I>.</P>
<P>In fact, two Federal frigates were now cruising in the Charleston waters. Mr.
Mathew soon drew James Playfair&apos;s attention to them.</P>
<P>&quot;They are preparing to ask us what we want on these shores,&quot; said he.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, well! we won&apos;t answer them,&quot; replied the Captain, &quot;and they will not get
their curiosity satisfied.&quot;</P>
<P>In the meanwhile the cruisers were coming on full steam towards the
<I>Dolphin</I>, who continued her course, taking care to keep out of range of
their guns. But in order to gain time James Playfair made for the south-west,
wishing to put the enemies&apos; ships off their guard; the latter must have thought
that the <I>Dolphin</I> intended to make for Morris Island Channel. Now there
they had batteries and guns, a single shot from which would have been enough to
sink the English ship; so the Federals allowed the <I>Dolphin</I> to run towards
the south-west, contenting themselves by observing her without following
closely.</P>
<P>Thus for an hour the respective situations of the ships did not change, for
James Playfair, wishing to deceive the cruisers as to the course of the
<I>Dolphin</I>, had caused the fires to be moderated, so that the speed was
decreased. However, from the thick volumes of smoke which escaped from the
chimneys, it might have been thought that he was trying to get his maximum
pressure, and, consequently his maximum of rapidity.</P>
<P>&quot;They will be slightly astonished presently,&quot; said James Playfair, &quot;when they
see us slip through their fingers!&quot;</P>
<P>In fact, when the Captain saw that he was near enough to Morris Island, and
before a line of guns, the range of which he did not know, he turned his rudder
quickly, and the ship resumed her northerly course, leaving the cruisers two
miles to windward of her; the latter, seeing this manoeuvre, understood the
steamer&apos;s object, and began to pursue her in earnest, but it was too late. The
<I>Dolphin</I> doubled her speed under the action of the screws, and distanced
them rapidly. Going nearer to the coast, a few shell were sent after her as an
acquittal of conscience, but the Federals were outdone, for their projectiles
did not reach half-way. At eleven o&apos;clock in the morning, the steamer ranging
near Sullivan Island, thanks to her small draft, entered the narrow strait full
steam; there she was in safety, for no Federalist cruiser dared follow her in
this channel, the depth of which, on an average, was only eleven feet at low
tide.</P>
<P>&quot;How!&quot; cried Crockston, &quot;and is that the only difficulty?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! oh! Master Crockston,&quot; said James Playfair, &quot;the difficulty is not in
entering, but in getting out again.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nonsense!&quot; replied the American, &quot;that does not make me at all uneasy; with
a boat like the <I>Dolphin</I> and a Captain like Mr. James Playfair, one can go
where one likes, and come out in the same manner.&quot;</P>
<P>Nevertheless, James Playfair, with telescope in his hand, was attentively
examining the route to be followed. He had before him excellent coasting guides,
with which he could go ahead without any difficulty or hesitation.</P>
<P>Once his ship was safely in the narrow channel which runs the length of
Sullivan Island, James steered bearing towards the middle of Fort Moultrie as
far as the Pickney Castle, situated on the isolated island of Shute&apos;s Folly; on
the other side rose Fort Johnson, a little way to the north of Fort Sumter.</P>
<P>At this moment the steamer was saluted by some shot which did not reach her,
from the batteries on Morris Island. She continued her course without any
deviation, passed before Moultrieville, situated at the extremity of Sullivan
Island, and entered the bay.</P>
<P>Soon Fort Sumter on the left protected her from the batteries of the
Federalists.</P>
<P>This fort, so celebrated in the civil war, is situated three miles and a half
from Charleston, and about a mile from each side of the bay: it is nearly
pentagonal in form, built on an artificial island of Massachusetts granite; it
took ten years to construct and cost more than 900,000 dollars.</P>
<P>It was from this fort, on the 13th of April, 1861, that Anderson and the
Federal troops were driven, and it was against it that the first shot of the
Confederates was fired. It is impossible to estimate the quantity of iron and
lead which the Federals showered down upon it. However, it resisted for almost
three years, but a few months after the passage of the <I>Dolphin</I> it fell
beneath General Gillmore&apos;s three hundred-pounders on Morris Island.</P>
<P>But at this time it was in all its strength, and the Confederate flag floated
proudly above it.</P>
<P>Once past the fort, the town of Charleston appeared, lying between Ashley and
Cooper Rivers.</P>
<P>James Playfair threaded his way through the buoys which mark the entrance of
the channel, leaving behind the Charleston lighthouse, visible above Morris
Island. He had hoisted the English flag, and made his way with wonderful
rapidity through the narrow channels. When he had passed the quarantine buoy, he
advanced freely into the centre of the bay. Miss Halliburtt was standing on the
poop, looking at the town where her father was kept prisoner, and her eyes
filled with tears.</P>
<P>At last the steamer&apos;s speed was moderated by the Captain&apos;s orders; the
<I>Dolphin</I> ranged along the end of the south and east batteries, and was
soon moored at the quay of the North Commercial Wharf.</P>
