<p>"Lend me your gun, Almayer," said Willems, across the table on
which a smoky lamp shone redly above the disorder of a finished
meal. "I have a mind to go and look for a deer when the moon rises
to-night."</p>

<p>Almayer, sitting sidewise to the table, his elbow pushed amongst
the dirty plates, his chin on his breast and his legs stretched
stiffly out, kept his eyes steadily on the toes of his grass slippers
and laughed abruptly.</p>

<p>"You might say yes or no instead of making that unpleasant noise," 
remarked Willems, with calm irritation.</p>

<p>"If I believed one word of what you say, I would," answered Almayer
without changing his attitude and speaking slowly, with pauses,
as if dropping his words on the floor. "As it is&mdash;what’s the use?
You know where the gun is; you may take it or leave it. Gun. Deer.
Bosh! Hunt deer! Pah! It’s a . . . gazelle you are after, my honoured
guest. You want gold anklets and silk sarongs for that game&mdash;my
mighty hunter. And you won’t get those for the asking, I promise
you. All day amongst the natives. A fine help you are to me."</p>

<p>"You shouldn’t drink so much, Almayer," said Willems, disguising
his fury under an affected drawl. "You have no head. Never had,
as far as I can remember, in the old days in Macassar. You drink
too much."</p>

<p>"I drink my own," retorted Almayer, lifting his head quickly
and darting an angry glance at Willems.</p>

<p>Those two specimens of the superior race glared at each other
savagely for a minute, then turned away their heads at the same
moment as if by previous arrangement, and both got up. Almayer
kicked off his slippers and scrambled into his hammock, which
hung between two wooden columns of the verandah so as to catch
every rare breeze of the dry season, and Willems, after standing
irresolutely by the table for a short time, walked without a word
down the steps of the house and over the courtyard towards the
little wooden jetty, where several small canoes and a couple of
big white whale-boats were made fast, tugging at their short painters
and bumping together in the swift current of the river. He jumped
into the smallest canoe, balancing himself clumsily, slipped the
rattan painter, and gave an unnecessary and violent shove, which
nearly sent him headlong overboard. By the time he regained his
balance the canoe had drifted some fifty yards down the river.
He knelt in the bottom of his little craft and fought the current
with long sweeps of the paddle. Almayer sat up in his hammock,
grasping his feet and peering over the river with parted lips
till he made out the shadowy form of man and canoe as they struggled
past the jetty again.</p>

<p>"I thought you would go," he shouted. "Won’t you take the gun?
Hey?"  he yelled, straining his voice. Then he fell back in his
hammock and laughed to himself feebly till he fell asleep. On
the river, Willems, his eyes fixed intently ahead, swept his paddle
right and left, unheeding the words that reached him faintly.</p>

<p>It was now three months since Lingard had landed Willems in Sambir
and had departed hurriedly, leaving him in Almayer’s care.</p>

<p>The two white men did not get on well together. Almayer, remembering
the time when they both served Hudig, and when the superior Willems
treated him with offensive condescension, felt a great dislike
towards his guest. He was also jealous of Lingard’s favour. Almayer
had married a Malay girl whom the old seaman had adopted in one
of his accesses of unreasoning benevolence, and as the marriage
was not a happy one from a domestic point of view, he looked to
Lingard’s fortune for compensation in his matrimonial unhappiness.
The appearance of that man, who seemed to have a claim of some
sort upon Lingard, filled him with considerable uneasiness, the
more so because the old seaman did not choose to acquaint the
husband of his adopted daughter with Willems’ history, or to confide
to him his intentions as to that individual’s future fate. Suspicious
from the first, Almayer discouraged Willems’ attempts to help
him in his trading, and then when Willems drew back, he made,
with characteristic perverseness, a grievance of his unconcern.
From cold civility in their relations, the two men drifted into
silent hostility, then into outspoken enmity, and both wished
ardently for Lingard’s return and the end of a situation that
grew more intolerable from day to day. The time dragged slowly.
Willems watched the succeeding sunrises wondering dismally whether
before the evening some change would occur in the deadly dullness
of his life. He missed the commercial activity of that existence
which seemed to him far off, irreparably lost, buried out of sight
under the ruins of his past success&mdash;now gone from him beyond
the possibility of redemption. He mooned disconsolately about
Almayer’s courtyard, watching from afar, with uninterested eyes,
the up-country canoes discharging guttah or rattans, and loading
rice or European goods on the little wharf of Lingard &amp; Co.
Big as was the extent of ground owned by Almayer, Willems yet
felt that there was not enough room for him inside those neat
fences. The man who, during long years, became accustomed to think
of himself as indispensable to others, felt a bitter and savage
rage at the cruel consciousness of his superfluity, of his uselessness;
at the cold hostility visible in every look of the only white
man in this barbarous corner of the world. He gnashed his teeth
when he thought of the wasted days, of the life thrown away in
the unwilling company of that peevish and suspicious fool. He
heard the reproach of his idleness in the murmurs of the river,
in the unceasing whisper of the great forests. Round him everything
stirred, moved, swept by in a rush; the earth under his feet and
the heavens above his head. The very savages around him strove,
struggled, fought, worked&mdash;if only to prolong a miserable existence;
but they lived, they lived! And it was only himself that seemed
to be left outside the scheme of creation in a hopeless immobility
filled with tormenting anger and with ever-stinging regret.</p>

<p>He took to wandering about the settlement. The afterwards flourishing
Sambir was born in a swamp and passed its youth in malodorous
mud. The houses crowded the bank, and, as if to get away from
the unhealthy shore, stepped boldly into the river, shooting over
it in a close row of bamboo platforms elevated on high piles,
amongst which the current below spoke in a soft and unceasing
plaint of murmuring eddies. There was only one path in the whole
town and it ran at the back of the houses along the succession
of blackened circular patches that marked the place of the household
fires. On the other side the virgin forest bordered the path,
coming close to it, as if to provoke impudently any passer-by
to the solution of the gloomy problem of its depths. Nobody would
accept the deceptive challenge. There were only a few feeble attempts
at a clearing here and there, but the ground was low and the river,
retiring after its yearly floods, left on each a gradually diminishing
mudhole, where the imported buffaloes of the Bugis settlers wallowed
happily during the heat of the day. When Willems walked on the
path, the indolent men stretched on the shady side of the houses
looked at him with calm curiosity, the women busy round the cooking
fires would send after him wondering and timid glances, while
the children would only look once, and then run away yelling with
fright at the horrible appearance of the man with a red and white
face. These manifestations of childish disgust and fear stung
Willems with a sense of absurd humiliation; he sought in his walks
the comparative solitude of the rudimentary clearings, but the
very buffaloes snorted with alarm at his sight, scrambled lumberingly
out of the cool mud and stared wildly in a compact herd at him
as he tried to slink unperceived along the edge of the forest.
One day, at some unguarded and sudden movement of his, the whole
herd stampeded down the path, scattered the fires, sent the women
flying with shrill cries, and left behind a track of smashed pots,
trampled rice, overturned children, and a crowd of angry men brandishing
sticks in loud-voiced pursuit. The innocent cause of that disturbance
ran shamefacedly the gauntlet of black looks and unfriendly remarks,
and hastily sought refuge in Almayer’s campong. After that he
left the settlement alone.</p>

<p>Later, when the enforced confinement grew irksome, Willems took
one of Almayer’s many canoes and crossed the main branch of the
Pantai in search of some solitary spot where he could hide his
discouragement and his weariness. He skirted in his little craft
the wall of tangled verdure, keeping in the dead water close to
the bank where the spreading nipa palms nodded their broad leaves
over his head as if in contemptuous pity of the wandering outcast.
Here and there he could see the beginnings of chopped-out pathways,
and, with the fixed idea of getting out of sight of the busy river,
he would land and follow the narrow and winding path, only to
find that it led nowhere, ending abruptly in the discouragement
of thorny thickets. He would go back slowly, with a bitter sense
of unreasonable disappointment and sadness; oppressed by the hot
smell of earth, dampness, and decay in that forest which seemed
to push him mercilessly back into the glittering sunshine of the
river. And he would recommence paddling with tired arms to seek
another opening, to find another deception.</p>

<p>As he paddled up to the point where the Rajah’s stockade came
down to the river, the nipas were left behind rattling their leaves
over the brown water, and the big trees would appear on the bank,
tall, strong, indifferent in the immense solidity of their life,
which endures for ages, to that short and fleeting life in the
heart of the man who crept painfully amongst their shadows in
search of a refuge from the unceasing reproach of his thoughts.
Amongst their smooth trunks a clear brook meandered for a time
in twining lacets before it made up its mind to take a leap into
the hurrying river, over the edge of the steep bank. There was
also a pathway there and it seemed frequented. Willems landed,
and following the capricious promise of the track soon found himself
in a comparatively clear space, where the confused tracery of
sunlight fell through the branches and the foliage overhead, and
lay on the stream that shone in an easy curve like a bright sword-blade
dropped amongst the long and feathery grass.</p>

<p>Further on, the path continued, narrowed again in the thick undergrowth.
At the end of the first turning Willems saw a flash of white and
colour, a gleam of gold like a sun-ray lost in shadow, and a vision
of blackness darker than the deepest shade of the forest. He stopped,
surprised, and fancied he had heard light footsteps&mdash;growing lighter&mdash;ceasing.
He looked around. The grass on the bank of the stream trembled
and a tremulous path of its shivering, silver-grey tops ran from
the water to the beginning of the thicket. And yet there was not
a breath of wind. Somebody kind passed there. He looked pensive
while the tremor died out in a quick tremble under his eyes; and
the grass stood high, unstirring, with drooping heads in the warm
and motionless air.</p>

<p>He hurried on, driven by a suddenly awakened curiosity, and entered
the narrow way between the bushes. At the next turn of the path
he caught again the glimpse of coloured stuff and of a woman’s
black hair before him. He hastened his pace and came in full view
of the object of his pursuit. The woman, who was carrying two
bamboo vessels full of water, heard his footsteps, stopped, and
putting the bamboos down half turned to look back. Willems also
stood still for a minute, then walked steadily on with a firm
tread, while the woman moved aside to let him pass. He kept his
eyes fixed straight before him, yet almost unconsciously he took
in every detail of the tall and graceful figure. As he approached
her the woman tossed her head slightly back, and with a free gesture
of her strong, round arm, caught up the mass of loose black hair
and brought it over her shoulder and across the lower part of
her face. The next moment he was passing her close, walking rigidly,
like a man in a trance. He heard her rapid breathing and he felt
the touch of a look darted at him from half-open eyes. It touched
his brain and his heart together. It seemed to him to be something
loud and stirring like a shout, silent and penetrating like an
inspiration. The momentum of his motion carried him past her,
but an invisible force made up of surprise and curiosity and desire
spun him round as soon as he had passed.</p>

<p>She had taken up her burden already, with the intention of pursuing
her path. His sudden movement arrested her at the first step,
and again she stood straight, slim, expectant, with a readiness
to dart away suggested in the light immobility of her pose. High
above, the branches of the trees met in a transparent shimmer
of waving green mist, through which the rain of yellow rays descended
upon her head, streamed in glints down her black tresses, shone
with the changing glow of liquid metal on her face, and lost itself
in vanishing sparks in the sombre depths of her eyes that, wide
open now, with enlarged pupils, looked steadily at the man in
her path. And Willems stared at her, charmed with a charm that
carries with it a sense of irreparable loss, tingling with that
feeling which begins like a caress and ends in a blow, in that
sudden hurt of a new emotion making its way into a human heart,
with the brusque stirring of sleeping sensations awakening suddenly
to the rush of new hopes, new fears, new desires&mdash;and to the flight
of one’s old self.</p>

<p>She moved a step forward and again halted. A breath of wind that
came through the trees, but in Willems’ fancy seemed to be driven
by her moving figure, rippled in a hot wave round his body and
scorched his face in a burning touch. He drew it in with a long
breath, the last long breath of a soldier before the rush of battle,
of a lover before he takes in his arms the adored woman; the breath
that gives courage to confront the menace of death or the storm
of passion.</p>

<p>Who was she? Where did she come from? Wonderingly he took his
eyes off her face to look round at the serried trees of the forest
that stood big and still and straight, as if watching him and
her breathlessly. He had been baffled, repelled, almost frightened
by the intensity of that tropical life which wants the sunshine
but works in gloom; which seems to be all grace of colour and
form, all brilliance, all smiles, but is only the blossoming of
the dead; whose mystery holds the promise of joy and beauty, yet
contains nothing but poison and decay. He had been frightened
by the vague perception of danger before, but now, as he looked
at that life again, his eyes seemed able to pierce the fantastic
veil of creepers and leaves, to look past the solid trunks, to
see through the forbidding gloom&mdash;and the mystery was disclosed&mdash;enchanting,
subduing, beautiful. He looked at the woman. Through the checkered
light between them she appeared to him with the impalpable distinctness
of a dream. The very spirit of that land of mysterious forests,
standing before him like an apparition behind a transparent veil&mdash;a
veil woven of sunbeams and shadows.</p>

<p>She had approached him still nearer. He felt a strange impatience
within him at her advance. Confused thoughts rushed through his
head, disordered, shapeless, stunning. Then he heard his own voice
asking&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am the daughter of the blind Omar," she answered, in a low
but steady tone. "And you," she went on, a little louder, "you
are the white trader&mdash;the great man of this place."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Willems, holding her eyes with his in a sense of
extreme effort, "Yes, I am white." Then he added, feeling as if
he spoke about some other man, "But I am the outcast of my people."</p>

<p>She listened to him gravely. Through the mesh of scattered hair
her face looked like the face of a golden statue with living eyes.
The heavy eyelids dropped slightly, and from between the long
eyelashes she sent out a sidelong look: hard, keen, and narrow,
like the gleam of sharp steel. Her lips were firm and composed
in a graceful curve, but the distended nostrils, the upward poise
of the half-averted head, gave to her whole person the expression
of a wild and resentful defiance.</p>

<p>A shadow passed over Willems’ face. He put his hand over his
lips as if to keep back the words that wanted to come out in a
surge of impulsive necessity, the outcome of dominant thought
that rushes from the heart to the brain and must be spoken in
the face of doubt, of danger, of fear, of destruction itself.</p>

<p>"You are beautiful," he whispered.</p>

<p>She looked at him again with a glance that running in one quick
flash of her eyes over his sunburnt features, his broad shoulders,
his straight, tall, motionless figure, rested at last on the ground
at his feet. Then she smiled. In the sombre beauty of her face
that smile was like the first ray of light on a stormy daybreak
that darts evanescent and pale through the gloomy clouds: the
forerunner of sunrise and of thunder.</p>
