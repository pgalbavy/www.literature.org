For a time that ring set with sapphires seemed to be, after all,
the satisfactory solution of Ann Veronica's difficulties.  It was
like pouring a strong acid over dulled metal.  A tarnish of
constraint that had recently spread over her intercourse with
Capes vanished again.  They embarked upon an open and declared
friendship.  They even talked about friendship. They went to the
Zoological Gardens together one Saturday to see for themselves a
point of morphological interest about the toucan's bill--that
friendly and entertaining bird--and they spent the rest of the
afternoon walking about and elaborating in general terms this
theme and the superiority of intellectual fellowship to all
merely passionate relationships.  Upon this topic Capes was heavy
and conscientious, but that seemed to her to be just exactly what
he ought to be.  He was also, had she known it, more than a
little insincere.  "We are only in the dawn of the Age of
Friendship," he said, "when interest, I suppose, will take the
place of passions. Either you have had to love people or hate
them--which is a sort of love, too, in its way--to get anything
out of them.  Now, more and more, we're going to be interested in
them, to be curious about them and--quite mildly-experimental
with them."  He seemed to be elaborating ideas as he talked. 
They watched the chimpanzees in the new apes' house, and admired
the gentle humanity of their eyes--"so much more human than human
beings" --and they watched the Agile Gibbon in the next apartment
doing wonderful leaps and aerial somersaults.
<P>
"I wonder which of us enjoys that most," said Capes--"does he, or
do we?"
<P>
"He seems to get a zest--"
<P>
"He does it and forgets it.  We remember it.  These joyful bounds
just lace into the stuff of my memories and stay there forever. 
Living's just material."
<P>
"It's very good to be alive."
<P>
"It's better to know life than be life."
<P>
"One may do both," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
She was in a very uncritical state that afternoon. When he said,
"Let's go and see the wart-hog," she thought no one ever had had
so quick a flow of good ideas as he; and when he explained that
sugar and not buns was the talisman of popularity among the
animals, she marvelled at his practical omniscience.
<P>
Finally, at the exit into Regent's Park, they ran against Miss
Klegg.  It was the expression of Miss Klegg's face that put the
idea into Ann Veronica's head of showing Manning at the College
one day, an idea which she didn't for some reason or other carry
out for a fortnight.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 2
<P>
<P>
When at last she did so, the sapphire ring took on a new quality
in the imagination of Capes.  It ceased to be the symbol of
liberty and a remote and quite abstracted person, and became
suddenly and very disagreeably the token of a large and
portentous body visible and tangible.
<P>
Manning appeared just at the end of the afternoon's work, and the
biologist was going through some perplexities the Scotchman had
created by a metaphysical treatment of the skulls of Hyrax and a
young African elephant.  He was clearing up these difficulties by
tracing a partially obliterated suture the Scotchman had
overlooked when the door from the passage opened, and Manning
came into his universe.
<P>
Seen down the length of the laboratory, Manning looked a very
handsome and shapely gentleman indeed, and, at the sight of his
eager advance to his fiancee, Miss Klegg replaced one
long-cherished romance about Ann Veronica by one more normal and
simple.  He carried a cane and a silk hat with a mourning-band in
one gray-gloved hand; his frock-coat and trousers were admirable;
his handsome face, his black mustache, his prominent brow
conveyed an eager solicitude.
<P>
"I want," he said, with a white hand outstretched, "to take you
out to tea."
<P>
"I've been clearing up," said Ann Veronica, brightly.
<P>
"All your dreadful scientific things?" he said, with a smile that
Miss Klegg thought extraordinarily kindly.
<P>
"All my dreadful scientific things," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
He stood back, smiling with an air of proprietorship, and looking
about him at the business-like equipment of the room.  The low
ceiling made him seem abnormally tall.  Ann Veronica wiped a
scalpel, put a card over a watch-glass containing thin shreds of
embryonic guinea-pig swimming in mauve stain, and dismantled her
microscope.
<P>
"I wish I understood more of biology," said Manning.
<P>
"I'm ready," said Ann Veronica, closing her microscope-box with a
click, and looking for one brief instant up the laboratory.  "We
have no airs and graces here, and my hat hangs from a peg in the
passage."
<P>
She led the way to the door, and Manning passed behind her and
round her and opened the door for her. When Capes glanced up at
them for a moment, Manning seemed to be holding his arms all
about her, and there was nothing but quiet acquiescence in her
bearing.
<P>
After Capes had finished the Scotchman's troubles he went back
into the preparation-room.  He sat down on the sill of the open
window, folded his arms, and stared straight before him for a
long time over the wilderness of tiles and chimney-pots into a
sky that was blue and empty.  He was not addicted to monologue,
and the only audible comment he permitted himself at first upon a
universe that was evidently anything but satisfactory to him that
afternoon, was one compact and entirely unassigned "Damn!"
<P>
The word must have had some gratifying quality, because he
repeated it.  Then he stood up and repeated it again.  "The fool
I have been!" he cried; and now speech was coming to him.  He
tried this sentence with expletives.  "Ass!" he went on, still
warming.  "Muck-headed moral ass!  I ought to have done anything.
<P>
I ought to have done anything!
<P>
"What's a man for?
<P>
"Friendship!"
<P>
He doubled up his fist, and seemed to contemplate thrusting it
through the window.  He turned his back on that temptation.  Then
suddenly he seized a new preparation bottle that stood upon his
table and contained the better part of a week's work--a displayed
dissection of a snail, beautifully done--and hurled it across the
room, to smash resoundingly upon the cemented floor under the
bookcase; then, without either haste or pause, he swept his arm
along a shelf of re-agents and sent them to mingle with the
debris on the floor.  They fell in a diapason of smashes.  "H'm!"
he said, regarding the wreckage with a calmer visage. "Silly!" he
remarked after a pause.  "One hardly knows--all the time."
<P>
He put his hands in his pockets, his mouth puckered to a whistle,
and he went to the door of the outer preparation-room and stood
there, looking, save for the faintest intensification of his
natural ruddiness, the embodiment of blond serenity.
<P>
"Gellett," he called, "just come and clear up a mess, will you? 
I've smashed some things."
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 3
<P>
<P>
There was one serious flaw in Ann Veronica's arrangements for
self-rehabilitation, and that was Ramage. He hung over her--he
and his loan to her and his connection with her and that terrible
evening--a vague, disconcerting possibility of annoyance and
exposure. She could not see any relief from this anxiety except
repayment, and repayment seemed impossible.  The raising of
twenty-five pounds was a task altogether beyond her powers.  Her
birthday was four months away, and that, at its extremist point,
might give her another five pounds.
<P>
The thing rankled in her mind night and day.  She would wake in
the night to repeat her bitter cry:  "Oh, why did I burn those
notes?"
<P>
It added greatly to the annoyance of the situation that she had
twice seen Ramage in the Avenue since her return to the shelter
of her father's roof.  He had saluted her with elaborate
civility, his eyes distended with indecipherable meanings.
<P>
She felt she was bound in honor to tell the whole affair to
Manning sooner or later.  Indeed, it seemed inevitable that she
must clear it up with his assistance, or not at all.  And when
Manning was not about the thing seemed simple enough.  She would
compose extremely lucid and honorable explanations.  But when it
came to broaching them, it proved to be much more difficult than
she had supposed.
<P>
They went down the great staircase of the building, and, while
she sought in her mind for a beginning, he broke into
appreciation of her simple dress and self-congratulations upon
their engagement.
<P>
"It makes me feel," he said, "that nothing is impossible--to have
you here beside me.  I said, that day at Surbiton, 'There's many
good things in life, but there's only one best, and that's the
wild-haired girl who's pulling away at that oar.  I will make her
my Grail, and some day, perhaps, if God wills, she shall become
my wife!' "
<P>
He looked very hard before him as he said this, and his voice was
full of deep feeling.
<P>
"Grail!" said Ann Veronica, and then:  "Oh, yes--of course! 
Anything but a holy one, I'm afraid."
<P>
"Altogether holy, Ann Veronica.  Ah! but you can't imagine what
you are to me and what you mean to me! I suppose there is
something mystical and wonderful about all women."
<P>
"There is something mystical and wonderful about all human
beings.  I don't see that men need bank it with the women."
<P>
"A man does," said Manning--"a true man, anyhow. And for me there
is only one treasure-house.  By Jove! When I think of it I want
to leap and shout!"
<P>
"It would astonish that man with the barrow."
<P>
"It astonishes me that I don't," said Manning, in a tone of
intense self-enjoyment.
<P>
"I think," began Ann Veronica, "that you don't realize--"
<P>
He disregarded her entirely.  He waved an arm and spoke with a
peculiar resonance.  "I feel like a giant! I believe now I shall
do great things.  Gods! what it must be to pour out strong,
splendid verse--mighty lines! mighty lines!  If I do, Ann
Veronica, it will be you.  It will be altogether you.  I will
dedicate my books to you.  I will lay them all at your feet."
<P>
He beamed upon her.
<P>
"I don't think you realize," Ann Veronica began again, "that I am
rather a defective human being."
<P>
"I don't want to," said Manning.  "They say there are spots on
the sun.  Not for me.  It warms me, and lights me, and fills my
world with flowers.  Why should I peep at it through smoked glass
to see things that don't affect me?"  He smiled his delight at
his companion.
<P>
"I've got bad faults."
<P>
He shook his head slowly, smiling mysteriously.
<P>
"But perhaps I want to confess them."
<P>
"I grant you absolution."
<P>
"I don't want absolution.  I want to make myself visible to you."
<P>
"I wish I could make you visible to yourself.  I don't believe in
the faults.  They're just a joyous softening of the outline--more
beautiful than perfection. Like the flaws of an old marble.  If
you talk of your faults, I shall talk of your splendors."
<P>
"I do want to tell you things, nevertheless."
<P>
"We'll have, thank God! ten myriad days to tell each other
things.  When I think of it--"
<P>
"But these are things I want to tell you now!"
<P>
"I made a little song of it.  Let me say it to you. I've no name
for it yet.  Epithalamy might do.
<P>
     "Like him who stood on Darien           
     I view uncharted sea
     Ten thousand days, ten thousand nights           
     Before my Queen and me.
<P>
<P>
"And that only brings me up to about sixty-five!
<P>
     "A glittering wilderness of time           
     That to the sunset reaches      
     No keel as yet its waves has ploughed        
     Or gritted on its beaches.
<P>
     "And we will sail that splendor wide,           
     From day to day together,      
     From isle to isle of happiness          
     Through year's of God's own weather."
<P>
<P>
"Yes," said his prospective fellow-sailor, "that's very pretty."
She stopped short, full of things un-said.  Pretty!  Ten
thousand days, ten thousand nights!
<P>
"You shall tell me your faults," said Manning.  "If they matter
to you, they matter."
<P>
"It isn't precisely faults," said Ann Veronica.  "It's something
that bothers me."  Ten thousand!  Put that way it seemed so
different.
<P>
"Then assuredly!" said Manning.
<P>
She found a little difficulty in beginning.  She was glad when he
went on:  "I want to be your city of refuge from every sort of
bother.  I want to stand between you and all the force and
vileness of the world. I want to make you feel that here is a
place where the crowd does not clamor nor ill-winds blow."
<P>
"That is all very well," said Ann Veronica, unheeded.
<P>
"That is my dream of you," said Manning, warming. "I want my life
to be beaten gold just in order to make it a fitting setting for
yours.  There you will be, in an inner temple.  I want to enrich
it with hangings and gladden it with verses.  I want to fill it
with fine and precious things.  And by degrees, perhaps, that
maiden distrust of yours that makes you shrink from my kisses,
will vanish. . . .  Forgive me if a certain warmth creeps into my
words!  The Park is green and gray to-day, but I am glowing pink
and gold. . . .  It is difficult to express these things."
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 4
<P>
<P>
They sat with tea and strawberries and cream before them at a
little table in front of the pavilion in Regent's Park.  Her
confession was still unmade.  Manning leaned forward on the
table, talking discursively on the probable brilliance of their
married life.  Ann Veronica sat back in an attitude of
inattention, her eyes on a distant game of cricket, her mind
perplexed and busy. She was recalling the circumstances under
which she had engaged herself to Manning, and trying to
understand a curious development of the quality of this
relationship.
<P>
The particulars of her engagement were very clear in her memory. 
She had taken care he should have this momentous talk with her on
a garden-seat commanded by the windows of the house.  They had
been playing tennis, with his manifest intention looming over
her.
<P>
"Let us sit down for a moment," he had said.  He made his speech
a little elaborately.  She plucked at the knots of her racket and
heard him to the end, then spoke in a restrained undertone.
<P>
"You ask me to be engaged to you, Mr. Manning," she began.
<P>
"I want to lay all my life at your feet."
<P>
"Mr. Manning, I do not think I love you. . . .  I want to be very
plain with you.  I have nothing, nothing that can possibly be
passion for you.  I am sure. Nothing at all."
<P>
He was silent for some moments.
<P>
"Perhaps that is only sleeping," he said.  "How can you know?"
<P>
"I think--perhaps I am rather a cold-blooded person."
<P>
She stopped.  He remained listening attentively.
<P>
"You have been very kind to me," she said.
<P>
"I would give my life for you."
<P>
Her heart had warmed toward him.  It had seemed to her that life
might be very good indeed with his kindliness and sacrifice about
her.  She thought of him as always courteous and helpful, as
realizing, indeed, his ideal of protection and service, as
chivalrously leaving her free to live her own life, rejoicing
with an infinite generosity in every detail of her irresponsive
being.  She twanged the catgut under her fingers.
<P>
"It seems so unfair," she said, "to take all you offer me and
give so little in return."
<P>
"It is all the world to me.  And we are not traders looking at
equivalents."
<P>
"You know, Mr. Manning, I do not really want to marry."
<P>
"No."
<P>
"It seems so--so unworthy"--she picked among her phrases "of the
noble love you give--"
<P>
She stopped, through the difficulty she found in expressing
herself.
<P>
"But I am judge of that," said Manning.
<P>
"Would you wait for me?"
<P>
Manning was silent for a space.  "As my lady wills."
<P>
"Would you let me go on studying for a time?"
<P>
"If you order patience."
<P>
"I think, Mr. Manning . . .  I do not know.  It is so difficult. 
When I think of the love you give me--One ought to give you back
love."
<P>
"You like me?"
<P>
"Yes.  And I am grateful to you. . . ."
<P>
Manning tapped with his racket on the turf through some moments
of silence.  "You are the most perfect, the most glorious of
created things--tender, frank intellectual, brave, beautiful.  I
am your servitor. I am ready to wait for you, to wait your
pleasure, to give all my life to winning it.  Let me only wear
your livery.  Give me but leave to try.  You want to think for a
time, to be free for a time.  That is so like you, Diana--Pallas
Athene! (Pallas Athene is better.) You are all the slender
goddesses.  I understand.  Let me engage myself.  That is all I
ask."
<P>
She looked at him; his face, downcast and in profile, was
handsome and strong.  Her gratitude swelled within her.
<P>
"You are too good for me," she said in a low voice.
<P>
"Then you--you will?"
<P>
A long pause.
<P>
"It isn't fair. . . ."
<P>
"But will you?"
<P>
"YES."
<P>
For some seconds he had remained quite still.
<P>
"If I sit here," he said, standing up before her abruptly, "I
shall have to shout.  Let us walk about.  Tum, tum, tirray, tum,
tum, tum, te-tum--that thing of Mendelssohn's!  If making one
human being absolutely happy is any satisfaction to you--"
<P>
He held out his hands, and she also stood up.
<P>
He drew her close up to him with a strong, steady pull.  Then
suddenly, in front of all those windows, he folded her in his
arms and pressed her to him, and kissed her unresisting face.
<P>
"Don't!" cried Ann Veronica, struggling faintly, and he released
her.
<P>
"Forgive me," he said.  "But I am at singing-pitch."
<P>
She had a moment of sheer panic at the thing she had done.  "Mr.
Manning," she said, "for a time--Will you tell no one?  Will you
keep this--our secret? I'm doubtful-- Will you please not even
tell my aunt?"
<P>
"As you will," he said.  "But if my manner tells! I cannot help
it if that shows.  You only mean a secret for a little time?"
<P>
"Just for a little time," she said; "yes. . . ."
<P>
But the ring, and her aunt's triumphant eye, and a note of
approval in her father's manner, and a novel disposition in him
to praise Manning in a just, impartial voice had soon placed very
definite qualifications upon that covenanted secrecy.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 5
<P>
<P>
At first the quality of her relationship to Manning seemed moving
and beautiful to Ann Veronica.  She admired and rather pitied
him, and she was unfeignedly grateful to him.  She even thought
that perhaps she might come to love him, in spite of that faint
indefinable flavor of absurdity that pervaded his courtly
bearing.  She would never love him as she loved Capes, of course,
but there are grades and qualities of love.  For Manning it would
be a more temperate love altogether. Much more temperate; the
discreet and joyless love of a virtuous, reluctant, condescending
wife.  She had been quite convinced that an engagement with him
and at last a marriage had exactly that quality of compromise
which distinguishes the ways of the wise.  It would be the
wrappered world almost at its best.  She saw herself building up
a life upon that--a life restrained, kindly, beautiful, a little
pathetic and altogether dignified; a life of great disciplines
and suppressions and extensive reserves. . .
<P>
But the Ramage affair needed clearing up, of course; it was a
flaw upon that project.  She had to explain about and pay off
that forty pounds. . . .
<P>
Then, quite insensibly, her queenliness had declined. She was
never able to trace the changes her attitude had undergone, from
the time when she believed herself to be the pampered Queen of
Fortune, the crown of a good man's love (and secretly, but nobly,
worshipping some one else), to the time when she realized she was
in fact just a mannequin for her lover's imagination, and that he
cared no more for the realities of her being, for the things she
felt and desired, for the passions and dreams that might move
her, than a child cares for the sawdust in its doll.  She was the
actress his whim had chosen to play a passive part. . . .
<P>
It was one of the most educational disillusionments in Ann
Veronica's career.
<P>
But did many women get anything better?
<P>
This afternoon, when she was urgent to explain her hampering and
tainting complication with Ramage, the realization of this alien
quality in her relationship with Manning became acute.  Hitherto
it had been qualified by her conception of all life as a
compromise, by her new effort to be unexacting of life.  But she
perceived that to tell Manning of her Ramage adventures as they
had happened would be like tarring figures upon a water-color. 
They were in different key, they had a different timbre.  How
could she tell him what indeed already began to puzzle herself,
why she had borrowed that money at all?  The plain fact was that
she had grabbed a bait.  She had grabbed!  She became less and
less attentive to his meditative, self-complacent fragments of
talk as she told herself this.  Her secret thoughts made some
hasty, half-hearted excursions into the possibility of telling
the thing in romantic tones--Ramage was as a black villain, she
as a white, fantastically white, maiden. . . .  She doubted if
Manning would even listen to that.  He would refuse to listen and
absolve her unshriven.
<P>
Then it came to her with a shock, as an extraordinary oversight,
that she could never tell Manning about Ramage--never.
<P>
She dismissed the idea of doing so.  But that still left the
forty pounds! . . .
<P>
Her mind went on generalizing.  So it would always be between
herself and Manning.  She saw her life before her robbed of all
generous illusions, the wrappered life unwrappered forever,
vistas of dull responses, crises of make-believe, years of
exacting mutual disregard in a misty garden of fine sentiments.
<P>
But did any woman get anything better from a man? Perhaps every
woman conceals herself from a man perforce! . . .
<P>
She thought of Capes.  She could not help thinking of Capes. 
Surely Capes was different.  Capes looked at one and not over
one, spoke to one, treated one as a visible concrete fact.  Capes
saw her, felt for her, cared for her greatly, even if he did not
love her.  Anyhow, he did not sentimentalize her.  And she had
been doubting since that walk in the Zoological Gardens whether,
indeed, he did simply care for her.  Little things, almost
impalpable, had happened to justify that doubt; something in his
manner had belied his words. Did he not look for her in the
morning when she entered--come very quickly to her?  She thought
of him as she had last seen him looking down the length of the
laboratory to see her go.  Why had he glanced up--quite in that
way? . . .
<P>
The thought of Capes flooded her being like long-veiled sunlight
breaking again through clouds.  It came to her like a dear thing
rediscovered, that she loved Capes.  It came to her that to marry
any one but Capes was impossible.  If she could not marry him,
she would not marry any one.  She would end this sham with
Manning.  It ought never to have begun.  It was cheating, pitiful
cheating.  And then if some day Capes wanted her--saw fit to
alter his views upon friendship. . . .
<P>
Dim possibilities that she would not seem to look at even to
herself gesticulated in the twilight background of her mind.
<P>
She leaped suddenly at a desperate resolution, and in one moment
had made it into a new self.  She flung aside every plan she had
in life, every discretion.  Of course, why not?  She would be
honest, anyhow!
<P>
She turned her eyes to Manning.
<P>
He was sitting back from the table now, with one arm over the
back of his green chair and the other resting on the little
table.  He was smiling under his heavy mustache, and his head was
a little on one side as he looked at her.
<P>
"And what was that dreadful confession you had to make?" he was
saying.  His quiet, kindly smile implied his serene disbelief in
any confessible thing.  Ann Veronica pushed aside a tea-cup and
the vestiges of her strawberries and cream, and put her elbows
before her on the table.  "Mr. Manning," she said, "I HAVE a
confession to make."
<P>
"I wish you would use my Christian name," he said.
<P>
She attended to that, and then dismissed it as unimportant.
<P>
Something in her voice and manner conveyed an effect of unwonted
gravity to him.  For the first time he seemed to wonder what it
might be that she had to confess.  His smile faded.
<P>
"I don't think our engagement can go on," she plunged, and felt
exactly that loss of breath that comes with a dive into icy
water.
<P>
"But, how," he said, sitting up astonished beyond measure, "not
go on?"
<P>
"I have been thinking while you have been talking. You see--I
didn't understand."
<P>
She stared hard at her finger-nails.  "It is hard to express
one's self, but I do want to be honest with you. When I promised
to marry you I thought I could; I thought it was a possible
arrangement.  I did think it could be done.  I admired your
chivalry.  I was grateful."
<P>
She paused.
<P>
"Go on," he said.
<P>
She moved her elbow nearer to him and spoke in a still lower
tone.  "I told you I did not love you."
<P>
"I know," said Manning, nodding gravely.  "It was fine and brave
of you."
<P>
"But there is something more."
<P>
She paused again.
<P>
"I--I am sorry-- I didn't explain.  These things are difficult. 
It wasn't clear to me that I had to explain. . . .  I love some
one else."
<P>
They remained looking at each other for three or four seconds. 
Then Manning flopped back in his chair and dropped his chin like
a man shot.  There was a long silence between them.
<P>
"My God!" he said at last, with tremendous feeling, and then
again, "My God!"
<P>
Now that this thing was said her mind was clear and calm.  She
heard this standard expression of a strong soul wrung with a
critical coldness that astonished herself.  She realized dimly
that there was no personal thing behind his cry, that countless
myriads of Mannings had "My God!"-ed with an equal gusto at
situations as flatly apprehended.  This mitigated her remorse
enormously.  He rested his brow on his hand and conveyed
magnificent tragedy by his pose.
<P>
"But why," he said in the gasping voice of one subduing an agony,
and looked at her from under a pain-wrinkled brow, "why did you
not tell me this before?"
<P>
"I didn't know-- I thought I might be able to control myself."
<P>
"And you can't?"
<P>
"I don't think I ought to control myself."
<P>
"And I have been dreaming and thinking--"
<P>
"I am frightfully sorry. . . ."
<P>
"But-- This bolt from the blue!  My God!  Ann Veronica, you don't
understand.  This--this shatters a world!"
<P>
She tried to feel sorry, but her sense of his immense egotism was
strong and clear.
<P>
He went on with intense urgency.

"Why did you ever let me love you?  Why did you ever let me peep
through the gates of Paradise?  Oh! my God!  I don't begin to
feel and realize this yet.  It seems to me just talk; it seems to
me like the fancy of a dream.  Tell me I haven't heard.  This is
a joke of yours."  He made his voice very low and full, and
looked closely into her face.
<P>
She twisted her fingers tightly.  "It isn't a joke," she said. 
"I feel shabby and disgraced. . . .  I ought never to have
thought of it.  Of you, I mean. . . ."
<P>
He fell back in his chair with an expression of tremendous
desolation.  "My God!" he said again. . . .
<P>
They became aware of the waitress standing over them with book
and pencil ready for their bill.  "Never mind the bill," said
Manning tragically, standing up and thrusting a four-shilling
piece into her hand, and turning a broad back on her
astonishment.  "Let us walk across the Park at least," he said to
Ann Veronica. "Just at present my mind simply won't take hold of
this at all. . . .  I tell you--never mind the bill.  Keep it!
Keep it!"

Part 6
<P>
<P>
They walked a long way that afternoon.  They crossed the Park to
the westward, and then turned back and walked round the circle
about the Royal Botanical Gardens and then southwardly toward
Waterloo.  They trudged and talked, and Manning struggled, as he
said, to "get the hang of it all."
<P>
It was a long, meandering talk, stupid, shameful, and
unavoidable.  Ann Veronica was apologetic to the bottom of her
soul.  At the same time she was wildly exultant at the resolution
she had taken, the end she had made to her blunder.  She had only
to get through this, to solace Manning as much as she could, to
put such clumsy plasterings on his wounds as were possible, and
then, anyhow, she would be free--free to put her fate to the
test.  She made a few protests, a few excuses for her action in
accepting him, a few lame explanations, but he did not heed them
or care for them.  Then she realized that it was her business to
let Manning talk and impose his own interpretations upon the
situation so far as he was concerned.  She did her best to do
this.  But about his unknown rival he was acutely curious.
<P>
He made her tell him the core of the difficulty.
<P>
"I cannot say who he is," said Ann Veronica, "but he is a married
man. . . .  No!  I do not even know that he cares for me.  It is
no good going into that.  Only I just want him.  I just want him,
and no one else will do.  It is no good arguing about a thing
like that."
<P>
"But you thought you could forget him."
<P>
"I suppose I must have thought so.  I didn't understand.  Now I
do."
<P>
"By God!" said Manning, making the most of the word, "I suppose
it's fate.  Fate!  You are so frank so splendid!
<P>
"I'm taking this calmly now," he said, almost as if he
apologized, "because I'm a little stunned."
<P>
Then he asked, "Tell me! has this man, has he DARED to make love
to you?"
<P>
Ann Veronica had a vicious moment.  "I wish he had," she said.
<P>
"But--"
<P>
The long inconsecutive conversation by that time was getting on
her nerves.  "When one wants a thing more than anything else in
the world," she said with outrageous frankness, "one naturally
wishes one had it."
<P>
She shocked him by that.  She shattered the edifice he was
building up of himself as a devoted lover, waiting only his
chance to win her from a hopeless and consuming passion.
<P>
"Mr. Manning," she said, "I warned you not to idealize me.  Men
ought not to idealize any woman. We aren't worth it.  We've done
nothing to deserve it. And it hampers us.  You don't know the
thoughts we have; the things we can do and say.  You are a
sisterless man; you have never heard the ordinary talk that goes
on at a girls' boarding-school."
<P>
"Oh! but you ARE splendid and open and fearless! As if I couldn't
allow!  What are all these little things? Nothing!  Nothing!  You
can't sully yourself.  You can't!  I tell you frankly you may
break off your engagement to me--I shall hold myself still
engaged to you, yours just the same.  As for this
infatuation--it's like some obsession, some magic thing laid upon
you.  It's not you--not a bit.  It's a thing that's happened to
you.  It is like some accident.  I don't care.  In a sense I
don't care.  It makes no difference. . . .  All the same, I wish
I had that fellow by the throat!  Just the virile, unregenerate
man in me wishes that. . . .
<P>
"I suppose I should let go if I had.
<P>
"You know," he went on, "this doesn't seem to me to end anything.
<P>
I'm rather a persistent person.  I'm the sort of dog, if you turn
it out of the room it lies down on the mat at the door.  I'm not
a lovesick boy.  I'm a man, and I know what I mean.  It's a
tremendous blow, of course--but it doesn't kill me.  And the
situation it makes!--the situation!"
<P>
Thus Manning, egotistical, inconsecutive, unreal. And Ann
Veronica walked beside him, trying in vain to soften her heart to
him by the thought of how she had ill-used him, and all the time,
as her feet and mind grew weary together, rejoicing more and more
that at the cost of this one interminable walk she escaped the
prospect of--what was it?--"Ten thousand days, ten thousand
nights" in his company.  Whatever happened she need never return
to that possibility.
<P>
"For me," Manning went on, "this isn't final.  In a sense it
alters nothing.  I shall still wear your favor--even if it is a
stolen and forbidden favor--in my casque. . . .  I shall still
believe in you.  Trust you."
<P>
He repeated several times that he would trust her, though it
remained obscure just exactly where the trust came in.
<P>
"Look here," he cried out of a silence, with a sudden flash of
understanding, "did you mean to throw me over when you came out
with me this afternoon?"
<P>
Ann Veronica hesitated, and with a startled mind realized the
truth.  "No," she answered, reluctantly.
<P>
"Very well," said Manning.  "Then I don't take this as final. 
That's all.  I've bored you or something. . . . You think you
love this other man!  No doubt you do love him.  Before you have
lived--"
<P>
He became darkly prophetic.  He thrust out a rhetorical hand.
<P>
"I will MAKE you love me!  Until he has faded--faded into a
memory. . ."
<P>
He saw her into the train at Waterloo, and stood, a tall, grave
figure, with hat upraised, as the carriage moved forward slowly
and hid him.  Ann Veronica sat back with a sigh of relief. 
Manning might go on now idealizing her as much as he liked.  She
was no longer a confederate in that.  He might go on as the
devoted lover until he tired.  She had done forever with the Age
of Chivalry, and her own base adaptations of its traditions to
the compromising life.  She was honest again.
<P>
But when she turned her thoughts to Morningside Park she
perceived the tangled skein of life was now to be further
complicated by his romantic importunity.
