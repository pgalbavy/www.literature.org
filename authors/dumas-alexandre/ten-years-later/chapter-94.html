<P>Raoul, on betaking himself to De Guiche, found him
conversing with De Wardes and Manicamp. De Wardes, since the
affair of the barricade, had treated Raoul as a stranger;
they behaved as if they were not acquainted. As Raoul
entered, De Guiche walked up to him; and Raoul, as he
grasped his friend's hand, glanced rapidly at his two
companions, hoping to be able to read on their faces what
was passing in their minds. De Wardes was cold and
impenetrable; Manicamp seemed absorbed in the contemplation
of some trimming to his dress. De Guiche led Raoul to an
adjoining cabinet, and made him sit down, saying, &quot;How well
you look!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is singular,&quot; replied Raoul, &quot;for I am far from being
in good spirits.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is your case, then, Raoul, as it is my own,  -  our love
affairs do not progress.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So much the better, count, as far as you are concerned; the
worst news would be good news.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In that case do not distress yourself, for, not only am I
very unhappy, but, what is more, I see others about me who
are happy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Really, I do not understand you,&quot; replied Raoul; &quot;explain
yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will soon learn. I have tried, but in vain, to overcome
the feeling you saw dawn in me, increase and take entire
possession of me. I have summoned all your advice and my own
strength to my aid. I have well weighed the unfortunate
affair in which I have embarked; I have sounded its depths;
that it is an abyss, I am aware, but it matters little, for
I shall pursue my own course.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This is madness, De Guiche! you cannot advance another step
without risking your own ruin to-day, perhaps your life
to-morrow.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Whatever may happen, I have done with reflections; listen.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you hope to succeed; you believe that Madame will love
you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Raoul, I believe nothing; I hope, because hope exists in
man, and never abandons him till death.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But, admitting that you obtain the happiness you covet,
even then, you are more certainly lost than if you had
failed in obtaining it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I beseech you, Raoul, not to interrupt me any more; you
could never convince me, for I tell you beforehand, I do not
wish to be convinced; I have gone so far I cannot recede; I
have suffered so much, death itself would be a boon. I no
longer love to madness, Raoul, I am being engulfed by a
whirlpool of jealousy.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul struck his hands together with an expression
resembling anger. &quot;Well?&quot; said he.</P>
<P>&quot;Well or ill matters little. This is what I claim from you,
my friend, my almost brother. During the last three days
Madame has been living in a perfect intoxication of gayety.
On the first day, I dared not look at her; I hated her for
not being as unhappy as myself. The next day I could not
bear her out of my sight; and she, Raoul  -  at least I
thought I remarked it  -  she looked at me, if not with pity,
at least with gentleness. But between her looks and mine, a
shadow intervened; another's smile invited hers. Beside her
horse another's always gallops, which is not mine; in her
ear another's caressing voice, not mine, unceasingly
vibrates. Raoul, for three days past my brain has been on
fire; flame, not blood, courses through my veins. That
shadow must be driven away, that smile must be quenched;
that voice must be silenced.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You wish Monsieur's death,&quot; exclaimed Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;No, no, I am not jealous of the husband; I am jealous of
the lover.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of the lover?&quot; said Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;Have you not observed it, you who were formerly so
keen-sighted?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you jealous of the Duke of Buckingham?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To the very death.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Again jealous?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This time the affair will be easy to arrange between us; I
have taken the initiative, and have sent him a letter.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It was you, then, who wrote to him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How do you know that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I know it, because he told me so. Look at this;&quot; and he
handed De Guiche the letter he had received nearly at the
same moment as his own. De Guiche read it eagerly, and said,
&quot;He is a brave man, and more than that, a gallant man.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Most certainly the duke is a gallant man; I need not ask if
you wrote to him in a similar style.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He will show you my letter when you call on him on my
behalf.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But that is almost out of the question.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That I shall call on him for that purpose.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The duke consults me as you do.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I suppose you will give me the preference! Listen to me,
Raoul, I wish you to tell his Grace  -  it is a very simple
matter  -  that to-day, to-morrow, the following day, or any
other day he may choose. I will meet him at Vincennes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Reflect, De Guiche.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I thought I told you I have reflected.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The duke is a stranger here; he is on a mission which
renders his person inviolable.... Vincennes is close to the
Bastile.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The consequences concern me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But the motive for this meeting? What motive do you wish me
to assign?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Be perfectly easy on that score, he will not ask any. The
duke must be as sick of me as I am of him. I implore you,
therefore, seek the duke, and if it is necessary to entreat
him to accept my offer, I will do so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is useless. The duke has already informed me that he
wishes to speak to me. The duke is now playing cards with
the king. Let us both go there. I will draw him aside in the
gallery: you will remain aloof. Two words will be
sufficient.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is well arranged. I will take De Wardes to keep me in
countenance.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why not Manicamp? De Wardes can join us at any time; we can
leave him here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, that is true.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He knows nothing?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Positively nothing. You continue still on an unfriendly
footing, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Has he not told you anything?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do not like the man, and, as I never liked him, the
result is, that I am on no worse terms with him to-day than
I was yesterday.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let us go, then.&quot;</P>
<P>The four descended the stairs. De Guiche's carriage was
waiting at the door, and took them to the Palais-Royal. As
they were going along, Raoul was engaged in devising his
scheme of action. The sole depositary of two secrets, he did
not despair of concluding some arrangement between the two
parties. He knew the influence he exercised over Buckingham,
and the ascendency he had acquired over De Guiche, and
affairs did not look utterly hopeless. On their arrival in
the gallery, dazzling with the blaze of light, where the
most beautiful and illustrious women of the court moved to
and fro, like stars in their own atmosphere, Raoul could not
prevent himself for a moment forgetting De Guiche in order
to seek out Louise, who, amidst her companions, like a dove
completely fascinated, gazed long and fixedly upon the royal
circle, which glittered with jewels and gold. All its
members were standing, the king alone being seated. Raoul
perceived Buckingham, who was standing a few places from
Monsieur, in a group of French and English, who were
admiring his aristocratic carriage and the incomparable
magnificence of his costume. Some of the older courtiers
remembered having seen his father, but their recollections
were not prejudicial to the son.</P>
<P>Buckingham was conversing with Fouquet, who was talking with
him aloud about Belle-Isle. &quot;I cannot speak to him at
present,&quot; said Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;Wait, then, and choose your opportunity, but finish
everything speedily. I am on thorns.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;See, our deliverer approaches,&quot; said Raoul, perceiving
D'Artagnan, who, magnificently dressed in his new uniform of
captain of the musketeers, had just made his entry in the
gallery; and he advanced towards D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;The Comte de la Fere has been looking for you, chevalier,&quot;
said Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, &quot;I have just left him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I thought you would have passed a portion of the evening
together.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We have arranged to meet again.&quot;</P>
<P>As he answered Raoul, his absent looks were directed on all
sides, as if seeking some one in the crowd, or looking for
something in the room. Suddenly his gaze became fixed, like
that of an eagle on its prey. Raoul followed the direction
of his glance, and noticed that De Guiche and D'Artagnan
saluted each other, but he could not distinguish at whom the
captain's inquiring and haughty glance was aimed.</P>
<P>&quot;Chevalier,&quot; said Raoul, &quot;there is no one here but yourself
who can render me a service.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is it, my dear vicomte?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is simply to go and interrupt the Duke of Buckingham, to
whom I wish to say two words, and, as the duke is conversing
with M. Fouquet, you understand that it would not do for me
to throw myself into the middle of the conversation.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, ah, is M. Fouquet there?&quot; inquired D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;Do you not see him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, now I do. But do you think I have a greater right than
you have?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are a more important personage.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, you're right; I am captain of the musketeers; I have
had the post promised me so long, and have enjoyed it for so
brief a period, that I am always forgetting my dignity.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will do me this service, will you not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;M. Fouquet  -  the deuce!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you not on good terms with him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is rather he who may not be on good terms with me;
however, since it must be done some day or another  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Stay; I think he is looking at you; or is it likely that it
might be  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, no, don't deceive yourself, it is indeed me for whom
this honor is intended.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The opportunity is a good one, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you think so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Pray go.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I will.&quot;</P>
<P>De Guiche had not removed his eyes from Raoul, who made a
sign to him that all was arranged. D'Artagnan walked
straight up to the group, and civilly saluted M. Fouquet as
well as the others.</P>
<P>&quot;Good evening, M. d'Artagnan; we were speaking of
Belle-Isle,&quot; said Fouquet, with that usage of society, and
that perfect knowledge of the language of looks, which
require half a lifetime thoroughly to acquire, and which
some persons, notwithstanding all their study, never attain.</P>
<P>&quot;Of Belle-Isle-en-Mer! Ah!&quot; said D'Artagnan. &quot;It belongs to
you, I believe, M. Fouquet?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;M. Fouquet has just told me that he had presented it to the
king,&quot; said Buckingham.</P>
<P>&quot;Do you know Belle-Isle, chevalier?&quot; inquired Fouquet.</P>
<P>&quot;I have only been there once,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, with
readiness and good-humor.</P>
<P>&quot;Did you remain there long?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Scarcely a day.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did you see much of it while you were there?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All that could be seen in a day.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A great deal can be seen with observation as keen as
yours,&quot; said Fouquet; at which D'Artagnan bowed.</P>
<P>During this Raoul made a sign to Buckingham. &quot;M. Fouquet,&quot;
said Buckingham, &quot;I leave the captain with you, he is more
learned than I am in bastions, scarps, and counter-scarps,
and I will join one of my friends, who has just beckoned
me.&quot; Saying this, Buckingham disengaged himself from the
group, and advanced towards Raoul, stopping for a moment at
the table where the queen-mother, the young queen, and the
king were playing together.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, Raoul,&quot; said De Guiche, &quot;there he is; be firm and
quick.&quot;</P>
<P>Buckingham, having made some complimentary remark to Madame,
continued his way towards Raoul, who advanced to meet him,
while De Guiche remained in his place, though he followed
him with his eyes. The maneuver was so arranged that the
young men met in an open space which was left vacant,
between the group of players and the gallery, where they
walked, stopping now and then for the purpose of saying a
few words to some of the graver courtiers who were walking
there. At the moment when the two lines were about to unite,
they were broken by a third. It was Monsieur who advanced
toward the Duke of Buckingham. Monsieur had his most
engaging smile on his red and perfumed lips.</P>
<P>&quot;My dear duke,&quot; said he, with the most affectionate
politeness; &quot;is it really true what I have just been told?&quot;</P>
<P>Buckingham turned round, he had not noticed Monsieur
approach; but had merely heard his voice. He started in
spite of his command over himself, and a slight pallor
overspread his face. &quot;Monseigneur,&quot; he asked, &quot;what has been
told you that surprises you so much?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That which throws me into despair, and will, in truth, be a
real cause of mourning for the whole court.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your highness is very kind, for I perceive that you allude
to my departure.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Precisely.&quot;</P>
<P>Guiche had overheard the conversation from where he was
standing, and started in his turn. &quot;His departure,&quot; he
murmured. &quot;What does he say?&quot;</P>
<P>Philip continued with the same gracious air, &quot;I can easily
conceive, monsieur, why the king of Great Britain recalls
you; we all know that King Charles II.; who appreciates true
gentlemen, cannot dispense with you. But it cannot be
supposed we can let you go without great regret; and I beg
you to receive the expression of my own.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Believe me, monseigneur,&quot; said the duke, &quot;that if I quit
the court of France  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because you are recalled; but, if you suppose the
expression of my own wish on the subject might possibly have
any influence with the king, I will gladly volunteer to
entreat his majesty Charles II. to leave you with us a
little while longer.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am overwhelmed, monseigneur, by so much kindness,&quot;
replied Buckingham, &quot;but I have received positive commands.
My residence in France was limited; I have prolonged it at
the risk of displeasing my gracious sovereign. It is only
this very day that I recollected I ought to have set off
four days ago.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed,&quot; said Monsieur.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but,&quot; added Buckingham, raising his voice in such a
manner that the princess could hear him,  -  &quot;but I resemble
that dweller in the East, who turned mad, and remained so
for several days, owing to a delightful dream that he had
had, but who one day awoke, if not completely cured, in some
respects rational at least. The court of France has its
intoxicating properties, which are not unlike this dream, my
lord; but at last I wake and leave it. I shall be unable,
therefore, to prolong my residence, as your highness has so
kindly invited me to do.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When do you leave?&quot; inquired Philip, with an expression
full of interest.</P>
<P>&quot;To-morrow, monseigneur. My carriages have been ready for
three days.&quot;</P>
<P>The Duc d'Orleans made a movement of the head, which seemed
to signify, &quot;Since you are determined, duke, there is
nothing to be said.&quot; Buckingham returned the gesture,
concealing under a smile a contraction of his heart; and
then Monsieur moved away in the same direction by which he
had approached. At the same moment, however, De Guiche
advanced from the opposite direction. Raoul feared that the
impatient young man might possibly make the proposition
himself, and hurried forward before him.</P>
<P>&quot;No, no, Raoul, all is useless now,&quot; said Guiche, holding
both his hands toward the duke, and leading him behind a
column. &quot;Forgive me, duke, for what I wrote to you, I was
mad; give me back my letter.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is true,&quot; said the duke, &quot;you cannot owe me a grudge any
longer now.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Forgive me, duke; my friendship, my lasting friendship is
yours.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is certainly no reason why you should bear me any
ill-will from the moment I leave her never to see her
again.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul heard these words, and comprehending that his presence
was now useless between the two young men, who had now only
friendly words to exchange, withdrew a few paces; a movement
which brought him closer to De Wardes, who was conversing
with the Chevalier de Lorraine respecting the departure of
Buckingham. &quot;A strategic retreat,&quot; said De Wardes.</P>
<P>&quot;Why so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because the dear duke saves a sword-thrust by it.&quot; At which
reply both laughed.</P>
<P>Raoul, indignant, turned round frowningly, flushed with
anger and his lip curling with disdain. The Chevalier de
Lorraine turned on his heel, but De Wardes remained and
waited.</P>
<P>&quot;You will not break yourself of the habit,&quot; said Raoul to De
Wardes, &quot;of insulting the absent; yesterday it was M.
d'Artagnan, to-day it is the Duke of Buckingham.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You know very well, monsieur,&quot; returned De Wardes, &quot;that I
sometimes insult those who are present.&quot;</P>
<P>De Wardes was close to Raoul, their shoulders met, their
faces approached, as if to mutually inflame each other by
the fire of their looks and of their anger. It could be seen
that the one was at the height of fury, the other at the end
of his patience. Suddenly a voice was heard behind them full
of grace and courtesy saying, &quot;I believe I heard my name
pronounced.&quot;</P>
<P>They turned round and saw D'Artagnan, who, with a smiling
eye and a cheerful face, had just placed his hand on De
Wardes's shoulder. Raoul stepped back to make room for the
musketeer. De Wardes trembled from head to foot, turned
pale, but did not move. D'Artagnan, still with the same
smile, took the place which Raoul abandoned to him.</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you, my dear Raoul,&quot; he said. &quot;M. de Wardes, I wish
to talk with you. Do not leave us Raoul; every one can hear
what I have to say to M. de Wardes.&quot; His smile immediately
faded away, and his glance became cold and sharp as a sword.</P>
<P>&quot;I am at your orders, monsieur,&quot; said De Wardes.</P>
<P>&quot;For a very long time,&quot; resumed D'Artagnan, &quot;I have sought
an opportunity of conversing with you; to-day is the first
time I have found it. The place is badly chosen, I admit,
but you will perhaps have the goodness to accompany me to my
apartments, which are on the staircase at the end of this
gallery.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I follow you, monsieur,&quot; said De Wardes.</P>
<P>&quot;Are you alone here?&quot; said D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;No; I have M. Manicamp and M. de Guiche, two of my
friends.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's well,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;but two persons are not
sufficient; you will be able to find a few others, I trust.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said the young man, who did not know what
object D'Artagnan had in view. &quot;As many as you please.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are they friends?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Real friends?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No doubt of it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well, get a good supply, then. Do you come, too,
Raoul; bring M. de Guiche and the Duke of Buckingham.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What a disturbance,&quot; replied De Wardes, attempting to
smile. The captain slightly signed to him with his hand, as
though to recommend him to be patient, and then led the way
to his apartments.</P></div>
