<p>No man in St. Ambrose College gave such breakfasts as Drysdale.
Not the great heavy spreads for thirty or forty, which came once
or twice a term, when everything was supplied out of the college
kitchen, and you had to ask leave of the Dean before you could
have it at all. In those ponderous feasts the most hum-drum of
the undergraduate kind might rival the most artistic, if he could
only pay his battle-bill, or get credit with the cook. But the
daily morning meal, when even gentlemen commoners were limited
to two hot dishes out of the kitchen, this was Drysdale's forte.
Ordinary men left the matter in the hands of scouts, and were
content with the ever-recurring buttered toasts and eggs, with
a dish of broiled ham, or something of the sort, with a marmalade
and bitter ale to finish with; but Drysdale was not an ordinary
man, as you felt in a moment when you went to breakfast with him
for the first time.</p>

<p>The staircase on which he lived was inhabited, except in the
garrets, by men in the fast set, and he and three others, who
had an equal aversion to solitary feeding, had established a breakfast-club,
in which, thanks to Drysdale's genius, real scientific gastronomy
was cultivated. Every morning the boy from the Weirs arrived with
freshly caught gudgeon, and now and then an eel or trout, which
the scouts on the staircase had learnt to fry delicately in oil.
Fresh watercresses came in the same basket, and the college kitchen
furnished a spitchedcocked chicken, or grilled turkey's leg. In
the season there were plover's eggs; or, at the worst, there was
a dainty omelette; and a distant baker, famed for his light rolls
and high charges, sent in the bread&mdash;the common domestic college
loaf being of course out of the question for anyone with the slightest
pretension to taste, and fit only for the perquisite of scouts.
Then there would be a deep Yorkshire pie, or reservoir of potted
game, as a <em>piece, de resistance</em>, and three or four sorts
of preserves; and a large cool tankard of cider or ale-cup to
finish up with, or soda-water and maraschino for a change. Tea
and coffee were there indeed, but merely as a compliment to those
respectable beverages, for they were rarely touched by the breakfast
eaters of No. 3 staircase. Pleasant young gentlemen they were
on No. 3 staircase; I mean the ground and first floor men who
formed the breakfast-club, for the garrets were nobodies. Three
out of the four were gentlemen-commoners, with allowances of 500L
a year at least each; and, as they treated their allowances as
pocket-money, and were all in their first year, ready money was
plenty and credit good, and they might have had potted hippopotamus
for breakfast if they had chosen to order it, which they would
most likely have done if they had thought of it.</p>

<p>Two out of the three were the sons of rich men who made their
own fortunes, and sent their sons to St. Ambrose's because it
was very desirable that the young gentlemen should make good connexions.
In fact, the fathers looked upon the University as a good investment,
and gloried much in hearing their sons talk familiarly in the
vacations of their dear friends Lord Harry This and Sir George
That.</p>

<p>Drysdale, the third of the set, was the heir of an old as well
of a rich family, and consequently, having his connexion ready
made to his hand, cared little enough with whom he associated,
provided they were pleasant fellows, and gave him good food and
wines. His whole idea at present was to enjoy himself as much
as possible; but he had good manly stuff in him at the bottom,
and, had he fallen into any but the fast set, would have made
a fine fellow, and done credit to himself and his college.</p>

<p>The fourth man at the breakfast-club, the Hon. Piers St. Cloud
was in his third year, and was a very well-dressed, well-mannered,
well-connected young man. His allowance was small for the set
he lived with, but he never wanted for anything. He didn't entertain
much, certainly, but when he did, everything was in the best possible
style. He was very exclusive, and knew no man in college out of
the fast set, and of these he addicted himself chiefly to the
society of the rich freshmen, for somehow the men of his own standing
seemed a little shy of him. But with the freshmen he was always
hand and glove, lived in their rooms, and used their wines, horses,
and other movable property as his own. Being a good whist and
billiard player, and not a bad jockey, he managed in one way or
another to make his young friends pay well for the honour of his
acquaintance; as, indeed, why should they not, at least those
of them who came to the college to form eligible connexions; for
had not his remote lineal ancestor come over in the same ship
with William the Conqueror? Were not all his relations about the
Court, as lords and ladies in waiting, white sticks or black rods,
and in the innermost of all possible circles of the great world;
and was there a better coat of arms than he bore in all Burke's
Peerage?</p>

<p>Our hero had met Drysdale at a house in the country shortly before
the beginning of his first term, and they had rather taken to
one another. Drysdale had been amongst his first callers; and,
as he came out of chapel one morning shortly after his arrival,
Drysdale's scout came up to him with an invitation to breakfast.
So he went to his own rooms, ordered his commons to be taken across
to No. 3, and followed himself a few minutes afterwards. No one
was in the rooms when he arrived, for none of the club had finished
their toilettes. Morning chapel was not meant for, or cultivated
by gentlemen-commoners; they paid double chapel fees, in consideration
of which, probably, they were not expected to attend so often
as the rest of the undergraduates; at any rate, they didn't, and
no harm came to them in consequence of their absence. As Tom entered,
a great splashing in an inner room stopped for a moment, and Drysdale's
voice shouted out that he was in his tub, but would be with him
in a minute. So Tom gave himself up to contemplation of the rooms
in which his fortunate acquaintance dwelt; and very pleasant rooms
they were. The large room in which the breakfast-table was laid
for five, was lofty and well proportioned, and panelled with old
oak, and the furniture was handsome and solid, and in keeping
with the room.</p>

<p>There were four deep windows, high up in the wall, with cushioned
seats under them, two looking into the large quadrangle, and two
into the inner one. Outside these windows, Drysdale had rigged
up hanging gardens, which were kept full of flowers by the first
nurseryman in Oxford, all the year round; so that even on this
February morning, the scent of gardenia and violets pervaded the
room, and strove for mastery with the smell of stale tobacco,
which hung about the curtains and sofa. There was a large glass
in an oak frame over the mantelpiece, which was loaded with choice
pipes and cigar cases and quaint receptacles for tobacco; and
by the side of the glass hung small carved oak frames, containing
lists of meets of the Heyshrop, the Old Berkshire, and Drake's
hounds, for the current week. There was a queer assortment of
well-framed paintings and engravings on the walls; some of considerable
merit, especially some watercolor and sea-pieces and engravings
from Landseer's pictures, mingled with which hung Taglioni and
Cerito, in short petticoats and impossible attitudes; Phosphurous
winning the Derby; the Death of Grimaldi (the famous steeple-chase
horse, not poor old Joe); an American Trotting Match, and Jem
Belcher and Deaf Burke in attitudes of self-defense. Several tandem
and riding whips, mounted in heavy silver, and a double-barrelled
gun, and fishing rods, occupied one corner, and a polished copper
cask, holding about five gallons of mild ale, stood in another.
In short, there was plenty of everything except books&mdash;the literature
of the world being represented, so far as Tom could make out in
his short scrutiny, by a few well-bound but badly used volumes
of the classics, with the cribs thereto appertaining, shoved away
into a cupboard which stood half open, and contained besides,
half-emptied decanters, and large pewters, and dog collars, and
packs of cards, and all sorts of miscellaneous articles to serve
as an antidote.</p>

<p>Tom had scarcely finished his short survey when the door of the
bedroom opened, and Drysdale emerged in a loose jacket lined with
silk, his velvet cap on his head, and otherwise gorgeously attired.
He was a pleasant-looking fellow of middle size, with dark hair,
and a merry brown eye, with a twinkle in it, which spoke well
for his sense of humor; otherwise, his large features were rather
plain, but he had the look and manners of a thoroughly well-bred
gentleman.</p>

<p>His first act, after nodding to Tom, was to seize on a pewter
and resort to the cask in the corner, from whence he drew a pint
or so of the contents, having, as he said, "'a whoreson longing
for that poor creature, small beer.' We were playing Van-John
in Blake's rooms till three last night, and he gave us devilled
bones and mulled port. A fellow can't enjoy his breakfast after
that without something to cool his coppers."</p>

<p>Tom was as yet ignorant of what Van-John might be, so held his
peace, and took a pull at the beer which the other handed to him;
and then the scout entered, and received orders to bring up Jack
and the breakfast, and not wait for any one. In another minute,
a bouncing and scratching was heard on the stairs, and a white
bulldog rushed in, a gem in his way; for his brow was broad and
massive, his skin was as fine as a lady's, and his tail taper
and nearly as thin as a clay pipe. His general look, and a way
he had of going 'snuzzling' about the calves of strangers, were
not pleasant for nervous people. Tom, however, was used to dogs,
and soon became friends with him, which evidently pleased his
host. And then the breakfast arrived, all smoking, and with it
the two other ingenious youths, in velvet caps and far more gorgeous
apparel, so far as colors went, than Drysdale. They were introduced
to Tom, who thought them somewhat ordinary and rather loud young
gentlemen. One of them remonstrated vigorously against the presence
of that confounded dog, and so Jack was sent to lie down in a
corner, and then the four fell to work upon the breakfast.</p>

<p>It was a good lesson in gastronomy, but the results are scarcely
worth repeating here. It is wonderful, though, how you feel drawn
to a man who feeds you well; and, as Tom's appetite got less,
his liking and respect for his host undoubtedly increased.</p>

<p>When they had nearly finished, in walked the Honorable Piers,
a tall slight man, two or three years older than the rest of them;
good looking, and very well and quietly dressed, but with the
drawing up of his nostril, and a drawing down of the corners of
his mouth, which set Tom against him at once. The cool, supercilious
half-nod, moreover, to which he treated our hero when introduced
to him, was enough to spoil his digestion, and hurt his self-love
a good deal more than he would have liked to own.</p>

<p>"Here, Henry," said the Honorable Piers to the scout in attendance,
seating himself, and inspecting the half-cleared dishes; "what
is there for my breakfast?"</p>

<p>Henry bustled about, and handed a dish or two.</p>

<p>"I don't want these cold things; haven't you kept me any gudgeon?"</p>

<p>"Why sir" said Henry, "there was only two dozen this morning,
and Mr. Drysdale told me to cook them all.</p>

<p>"To be sure I did," said Drysdale. "Just half a dozen for each
of us four: they were first-rate. If you can't get here at half-past
nine, you won't get gudgeon, I can tell you."</p>

<p>"Just go and get me a broil from the kitchen," said the Honorable
Piers, without deigning an answer to Drysdale.</p>

<p>"Very sorry, sir; kitchen's shut by now, sir," answered Henry.</p>

<p>"Then go to Hinton's, and order some cutlets."</p>

<p>"I say, Henry," shouted Drysdale to the retreating scout; "not
to my tick, mind! Put them down to Mr. St. Cloud."</p>

<p>Henry seemed to know very well that in that case he might save
himself the trouble of the journey, and consequently returned
to his waiting; and the Honorable Piers set to work upon his breakfast,
without showing any further ill temper certainly, except by the
stinging things which he threw every now and then into the conversation,
for the benefit of each of the others in turn.</p>

<p>Tom thought he detected signs of coming hostilities between his
host and St. Cloud, for Drysdale seemed to prick up his ears and
get combative whenever the other spoke, and lost no chance in
roughing him in his replies. And, indeed, he was not far wrong;
the fact being, that during Drysdale's first term, the other had
lived on him&mdash;drinking his wine, smoking his cigars, driving his
dog-cart, and winning his money; all which Drysdale, who was the
easiest going and best tempered fellow in Oxford, had stood without
turning a hair. But St. Cloud added to these little favors a half
patronizing, half contemptuous manner, which he used with great
success towards some of the other gentleman-commoners, who thought
it a mark of high breeding, and the correct thing, but which Drysdale,
who didn't care three straws about knowing St. Cloud, wasn't going
to put up with.</p>

<p>However, nothing happened but a little sparring, and the breakfast
things were cleared away, and the tankards left on the table,
and the company betook themselves to cigars and easy chairs. Jack
came out of his corner to be gratified with some of the remnants
by his fond master, and then curled himself up on the sofa along
which Drysdale lounged.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do to-day, Drysdale?" said one of the
others. "I've ordered a leader to be sent on over the bridge,
and mean to drive my dog-cart over, and dine at Abingdon. Won't
you come?"</p>

<p>"Who's going besides?" asked Drysdale.</p>

<p>"Oh, only St. Cloud and Farley here. There's lots of room for
a fourth."</p>

<p>"No, thank'ee; teaming's slow work on the back seat. Besides,
I've half promised to go down in the boat."</p>

<p>"In the boat!" shouted the other. "Why, you don't mean to say
you're going to take to pulling?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know; I rather think I am. I'm dog-tired of driving
and doing the High Street, and playing cards and billiards all
day, and our boat is likely to be head of the river, I think."</p>

<p>"By Jove! I should as soon have thought of you taking to reading,
or going to University Sermon," put in St. Cloud.</p>

<p>"And the boating-men, too," went on Farley; "did you ever see
such a set, St. Cloud? with their everlasting flannels and jerseys,
and hair cropped like prize-fighters?"</p>

<p>"I'll bet a guinea there isn't one of them has more than 200L
a year," put in Chanter, whose father could just write his name,
and was making a colossal fortune by supplying bad iron rails
to the new railway companies.</p>

<p>"What the devil do I care," broke in Drysdale; "I know they're
a deal more amusing than you fellows, who can't do anything that
don't cost pounds."</p>

<p>"Getting economical!" sneered St. Cloud.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see the fun of tearing one's heart out, and blistering
one's hands, only to get abused by that little brute Miller the
coxswain," said Farley.</p>

<p>"Why, you won't be able to sit straight in your chair for a month,"
said Chanter; "and the captain will make you dine at one, and
fetch you out of anybody's rooms, confound his impudence whether
he knows them or not, at eleven o'clock every night."</p>

<p>"Two cigars every day, and a pint and a half of liquid," and
Farley inserted his cod fish face into the tankard; "fancy Drysdale
on training allowance!"</p>

<p>Here a newcomer entered in a bachelor's gown, who was warmly
greeted by the name of Sanders by Drysdale. St. Cloud and he exchanged
the coldest possible nods; and the other two, taking the office
from their mentor, stared at him through their smoke, and, after
a minute or two's silence, and a few rude half-whispered remarks
amongst themselves, went off to play a game of pyramids till luncheon
time. Saunders took a cigar which Drysdale offered, and began
asking about his friends at home, and what he had been doing in
the vacation.</p>

<p>They were evidently intimate, though Tom thought that Drysdale
didn't seem quite at his ease at first, which he wondered at,
as Sanders took his fancy at once. However, eleven o'clock struck,
and Tom had to go to lecture, where we cannot follow him just
now, but must remain with Drysdale and Saunders, who chatted on
very pleasantly for some twenty minutes, till a knock came at
the door. It was not till the third summons that Drysdale shouted,
"Come in," with a shrug of his shoulders, and an impatient kick
at the sofa cushion at his feet, as though not half pleased at
the approaching visit.</p>

<p>Reader! Had you not ever a friend a few years older than yourself,
whose good opinions you were anxious to keep? A fellow <em>teres
atqua rotundus</em>; who could do everything better than you,
from Plato and tennis down to singing a comic song and playing
quoits? If you have had, wasn't he always in your rooms or company
whenever anything happened to show your little weak points? Sanders,
at any rate, occupied this position towards our young friend Drysdale,
and the latter, much as he liked Sander's company, would have
preferred it at any time than on an idle morning just at the beginning
of term, when the gentlemen tradesmen, who look upon undergraduates
in general, and gentlemen-commoners in particular, as their lawful
prey, are in the habit of calling in flocks.</p>

<p>The new arrival was a tall florid man, with a half servile, half
impudent, manner, and a foreign accent; dressed in sumptuous costume,
with a velvet-faced coat, and a gorgeous plush waist-coat. Under
his arm he carried a large parcel, which he proceeded to open,
and placed upon a sofa the contents, consisting of a couple of
coats, and three or four waistcoats and a pair of trousers. He
saluted Sanders with a most obsequious bow, looked nervously at
Jack, who opened one eye from between his master's legs and growled,
and then, turning to Drysdale, asked if he should have the honor
of seeing him try on any of the clothes?</p>

<p>"No; I can't be bored with trying them on now," said Drysdale;
"leave them where they are."</p>

<p>Mr. Schloss would like very much on his return to town, in a
day or two, to be able to assure his principals, that Mr. Drysdale's
orders had been executed to his satisfaction. He had also some
very beautiful new stuffs with him, which he should like to submit
to Mr. Drysdale, and without more ado began unfolding cards of
the most fabulous plushes and cloths.</p>

<p>Drysdale glanced first at the cards and then at Sanders, who
sat puffing his cigar, and watching Schloss's proceedings with
a look not unlike Jack's when anyone he did not approve of approached
his master.</p>

<p>"Confound your patterns, Schloss," said Drysdale; "I tell you
I have more things than I want already."</p>

<p>"The large stripe, such as these, is now very much worn in London,"
went on Schloss, without heeding the rebuff, and spreading his
cards on the table.</p>

<p>"<em>D&#11834; </em>trousers," replied Drysdale; "you seem to think
a fellow has ten pair of legs."</p>

<p>"Monsieur is pleased to joke," smiled Schloss; "but, to be in
the mode, gentlemen must have variety."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't order any now, that's flat," said Drysdale.</p>

<p>"Monsieur will do as he pleases; but it is impossible that he
should not have some plush waists; the fabric is only just out,
and is making a sensation."</p>

<p>"Now look here, Schloss; will you go if I order a waist coat?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur is very good; he sees how tasteful these new patterns
are."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't, be seen at a cock-fight in one of them, there're
as gaudy as a salmon-fly," said Drysdale, feeling the stuff which
the obsequious Schloss held out. "But it seems nice stuff, too,"
he went on; "I shouldn't mind having a couple of waistcoats of
it of this pattern;" and he chucked across to Schloss a dark tartan
waistcoat which was lying near him. "Have you got the stuff in
that pattern?"</p>

<p>"Ah! no," said Schloss, gathering up the waistcoat; "but it shall
not hinder. I shall have at once a loom for Monsieur set up at
once in Paris."</p>

<p>"Set it up in Jericho if you like," said Drysdale; "and now go!"</p>

<p>"May I ask, Mr. Schloss," broke in Sanders, "what it will cost
to set up the loom?"</p>

<p>"Ah! indeed, a trifle only; some twelve, or perhaps fourteen
pounds." Sanders gave a chuckle, and puffed away at his cigar.</p>

<p>"By Jove," shouted Drysdale, jerking himself in a sitting posture,
and upsetting Jack, who went trotting about the room, and snuffing
at Schloss's legs; "do you mean to say, Schloss, you were going
to make me waistcoats at fourteen guineas apiece?"</p>

<p>"Not if Monsieur disapproves. Ah! the large hound is not friendly
to strangers; I will call again when Monsieur is more at leisure."
And Schloss gathered up his cards and beat a hasty retreat, followed
by Jack with his head on one side, and casting an enraged look
at Sanders, as he slid through the door.</p>

<p>"Well done, Jack, old boy!" said Sanders, patting him; "what
a funk the fellow was in. Well, you've saved your master a pony
this fine morning. Cheap dog you've got, Drysdale."</p>

<p>"<em>D&#11834; </em>the fellow," answered Drysdale, "he leaves a
bad taste in one's mouth;" and he went to the table, took a pull
at the tankard, and then threw himself down on the sofa again,
as Jack jumped up and coiled himself round by his master's legs,
keeping one half-open eye winking at him, and giving an occasional
wag with the end of his taper tail.</p>

<p>Saunders got up, and began handling the new things. First he
held up a pair of bright blue trousers, with a red stripe across
them, Drysdale looking on from the sofa. "I say, Drysdale, you
don't mean to say you really ordered these thunder-and-lightening
affairs?"</p>

<p>"Heaven only knows," said Drysdale; "I daresay I did, I'd order
a full suit cut out of my grandmother's farthingale to get that
cursed Schloss out of my rooms sometimes."</p>

<p>"You'll never be able to wear them; even in Oxford the boys would
mob you. Why don't you kick him down stairs?" suggested Sanders,
putting down the trousers, and turning to Drysdale.</p>

<p>"Well, I've been very near it once or twice; but I don't know&mdash;my
name's Easy&mdash;besides, I don't want to give up the beast altogether;
he makes the best trousers in England."</p>

<p>"And these waistcoats," went on Sanders; "let me see; three light
silk waistcoats, peach-color, fawn-color, and lavender. Well,
of course, you can only wear these at your weddings. You may be
married the first time in the peach or fawn-color; and then, if
you have luck, and bury your first wife soon, it will be a delicate
compliment to take to No.2 in the lavender, that being half-mourning;
but still, you see, we're in difficulty as to one of the three,
either the peach or the fawn-color&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he was interrupted by another knock, and a boy entered from
the fashionable tobacconist's in Oriel Lane, who had general orders
to let Drysdale have his fair share of anything very special in
the cigar line. He deposited a two pound box of cigars at three
guineas the pound, on the table, and withdrew in silence.</p>

<p>Then came a boot-maker with a new pair of top-boots, which Drysdale
had ordered in November, and had forgotten next day. The artist,
wisely considering that his young patron must have plenty of tops
to last him through the hunting season (he himself having supplied
three previous pairs in October), had retained the present pair
for show in his window; and everyone knows that boots wear much
better for being kept sometime before use. Now, however, as the
hunting season was drawing to a close, and the place in the window
was wanted for spring stock, he judiciously sent in the tops,
merely adding half-a-sovereign or so to the price for interest
on the out lay since the order. He also kindly left on the table
a pair of large plated spurs to match the boots.</p>

<p>It never rains but it pours. Sanders sat smoking his cigar in
provoking silence, while knock succeeded knock and tradesman followed
tradesman; each depositing some article ordered, or supposed to
have been ordered, or which ought in the judgment of the depositors
to have been ordered, by the luckless Drysdale: and new hats,
and ties, and gloves, and pins, jostled balsam of Neroli, and
registered shaving-soap, and fancy letter paper, and Eau de Cologne,
on every available table. A visit from two livery-stable-keepers
in succession followed, each of whom had several new leaders which
they were anxious Mr. Drysdale should try as soon as possible.
Drysdale growled and grunted, and wished them or Sanders at the
bottom of the sea; however, he consoled himself with the thought
that the worst was now passed,&mdash;there was no other possible supplier
of undergraduate wants who could arrive.</p>

<p>Not so; in another minute a gentle knock came at the door. Jack
pricked up his ears and wagged his tail; Drysdale recklessly shouted,
"Come in!" the door slowly opened about eighteen inches, and a
shock head of hair entered the room, from which one lively little
gimlet eye went glancing about into every corner. The other eye
was closed, but as a perpetual wink to indicate the unsleeping
wariness of the owner, or because that hero had really lost the
power of using it in some of his numerous encounters with men
and beasts, no one, so far as I know, has ever ascertained.</p>

<p>"Ah! Mr. Drysdale, sir!" began the head; and then rapidly withdrew
behind the door to avoid one of the spurs, which (being the missile
nearest at hand) Drysdale instantly discharged at it. As the spur
fell to the floor, the head reappeared in the room, and as quickly
disappeared again, in deference to the other spur, the top boots,
an ivory handled hair brush, and a translation of Euripides, which
in turn saluted each successive appearance of said head; and the
grin was broader on each reappearance.</p>

<p>Then Drysdale, having no other article within reach which he
could throw, burst into a loud fit of laughter, in which Sanders
and the head heartily joined, and shouted, "Come in, Joe, you
old fool! and don't stand bobbing your ugly old mug in and out
there, like a jack in the box."</p>

<p>So the head came in, and after it the body, and closed the door
behind it; and a queer, cross-grained, tough-looking body it was,
of about fifty years standing, or rather slouching, clothed in
an old fustian coat, corduroy breeches and gaiters, and being
the earthly tabernacle of Joe Muggles, the dog-fancier of St.
Aldate's.</p>

<p>"How the deuce did you get by the lodge, Joe?" inquired Drysdale.
Joe, be it known, had been forbidden the college for importing
a sack of rats into the inner quadrangle, upon the turf of which
a match at rat-killing had come off between the terriers of two
gentlemen-commoners. This little event might have passed unnoticed,
but that Drysdale had bought from Joe a dozen of the slaughtered
rats, and nailed them on the doors of the four college tutors,
three to a door; whereupon inquiry had been made, and Joe had
been outlawed.</p>

<p>[Illustration: 0054]</p>

<p>"Oh, please Mr. Drysdale, sir, I just watched the 'ed porter,
sir, across to the buttery to get his mornin', and then I tips
a wink to the under porter (pal o' mine, sir, the under porter),
and makes a run of it right up."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll be quod'ed if you're caught! Now what do you want?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, Mr. Drysdale, sir," said Joe, in his most insinuating
tone, "my mate hev got an old dog brock, sir, from the Heythrop
kennel, and Honble Wernham, sir of New Inn 'All, sir, he've jist
been down our yard with a fighting chap from town, Mr. Drysdale&mdash;in
the fancy, sir, he is, and hev got a matter of three dogs down
a stoppin' at Milky Bill's. And he says, says he, Mr. Drysdale,
as arra one of he's dogs'll draw the old un three times, while
arra Oxford dog'll draw un twice, and Honble Wernham chaffs as
how he'll back un for a fi' pun note;"&mdash;and Joe stopped to caress
Jack, who was fawning on him as if he understood every word.</p>

<p>"Well, Joe, what then?" said Drysdale.</p>

<p>"So you see, Mr. Drysdale, sir," went on Joe, fondling Jack's
muzzle, "my mate says, says he, 'Jack's the dog as can draw a
brock,' says he, 'agin any Lonnun dog as ever was whelped; and
Mr. Drysdale' says he, 'ain't the man as'd see two poor chaps
bounced out of their honest name by arra town chap, and a fi'
pun note's no more to he for the matter o' that, then to Honble
Wernham his self,' says my mate."</p>

<p>"So I'm to lend you Jack for a match, and stand the stakes?"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Drysdale, sir, that was what my mate was a sayin'."</p>

<p>"You're cool heads, you and your mate," said Drysdale; "here,
take a drink, and get out, and I'll think about it." Drysdale
was now in a defiant humor, and resolved not to let Sanders think
that his presence could keep him from any act of folly to which
he was inclined.</p>

<p>Joe took his drink; and just then several men came in from lecture,
and drew off Drysdale's attention from Jack, who quietly followed
Joe out of the room, when that worthy disappeared. Drysdale only
laughed when he found it out, and went down to the yard that afternoon
to see the match between the London dog and his own pet.</p>

<p>"How in the world are youngsters with unlimited credit, plenty
of ready money, and fast tastes, to be kept from making fools
and blackguards of themselves up here," thought Sanders, as he
strolled back to his college. And it is a question which has exercised
other heads besides his, and probably is a long way yet from being
well solved.</p>
