<p>Tim O'Rooney and Howard Lawrence, awaking at the same moment,
observed the alarming action of the dog. Raising their heads they
looked carefully around but could detect nothing unusual. They
were so securely drawn under the overhanging shrubbery and undergrowth
that they were pretty certain no one else was aware of their presence;
but the gaze of the dog being turned toward the river they judged
that something must be nearing them from that direction.</p>

<p>Nor were they mistaken. A slight ripple was heard, and the next
moment a canoe glided to view. In the center, controlling its
movements, sat Shasta, the Pah Utah, and directly behind was Elwood
Brandon.</p>

<p>Howard could scarcely believe his eyes. He stared again and again,
while Tim rubbed his organs of vision, winked and blinked, as
though vainly seeking to recover from the bewilderment of a sudden
awaking from sleep. Finally he muttered to himself:</p>

<p>"Heaven save me! me intellect has toppled over intirely by raison
of the want of me pipe."</p>

<p>"Elwood! Elwood!" called Howard, leaning forward and pulling
the bushes apart.</p>

<p>But secure as they deemed their concealment, the eagle eyes of
the Pah Utah had penetrated it, while they were yet several rods
apart, and abruptly turning the prow of his canoe to one side,
he brought it to rest directly opposite and within two feet of
the other boat.</p>

<p>Elwood heard his name and saw his friends the next instant. Reaching
forward, he grasped the hands of his cousin and the tears trickled
down their smiling faces, while Tim continued rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p>"Am I draaming? as me uncle said when they towld him his grandfather
had died and willed him two pounds and a half, or does I raaly
see before me the youngster that the rid gintlemin had burned
up? Let me faal the baal of yer hand."</p>

<p>The two closed hands, and the joy of both was unbounded. Shasta,
at this point, showed a delicacy of feeling that did his heart
credit. Joining the canoes together in the old-fashioned manner,
he motioned Elwood to enter that of his friends, while he gave
his exclusive attention to that of propelling the two.</p>

<p>Of course, now that the three were reunited, they overran each
other with questions, exclamations and the interchange of experiences
since they had separated. It did not require much time for the
voluble tongue of Elwood to rattle on his brief stay with the
Indians and the remarkable manner in which Shasta had secured
his escape. Howard had but little to tell, and that was soon given,
and they were left to speculate and conjecture on the future.</p>

<p>Tim's joy drowned his craving for his tobacco, and as he joined
in the glowing conversation of the boys he made no reference to
it.</p>

<p>"I think for the prisent," he remarked, "we won't take any hunts
upon shore, especially if aich of us has to go alone. The red
gintlemen, for some raisin at all, or more likely without any
raisin, have taken a great anxiety to make our acquaintance. As
fur meself, I prefers to live upon fish to having these same fellows
faading upon me."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Elwood, "I have learned something during the last
few days. It is all well enough to be reckless and careless about
danger when we are at home and there is no danger, but it is another
thing when we are in these parts."</p>

<p>"As the Frenchman remarked, 'tiger hunting is very fine so long
as we hunt the tiger, but when he takes it into his head to hunt
us the mischief is to pay."</p>

<p>"If Shasta will have the onspakable kindness to tow us along
in this shtyle for a few waaks, I think we will cast anchor at
the wharf in San Francisco without any loss to passingers and
freight."</p>

<p>"He has seen what ninnies we were," said Elwood, "and no doubt
will accompany us some distance further when he certainly ought
to let us try it alone again."</p>

<p>"Ah! but he's a smart young gintleman, as the acquaintances of
Tim O'Rooney used to say when they made the slightest reference
to him. Couldn't we persuade him to go on to San Francisco wid
us? I think your father would be plaised to take him in as a partner
in their business wid them."</p>

<p>"But <em>he</em> would hardly fancy the change," laughed Howard.</p>

<p>"He might now. When we should state the sarvices he has rindered
to us, it's meself that doesn't think they'd require him to put
in a very large pile of capital."</p>

<p>"I am sure if he should prove as keen and sharp in business matters
as he does in the way of the woods, he would make one of the most
successful merchants in the country."</p>

<p>"It's a pity that he doesn't understand the illegant use of the
tongue, that we might confaar wid him. We could lay the proposition
forninst him, and he could gives us the tarms to carry wid us."</p>

<p>However philanthropic this might be as regarded the Pah Utah,
our friends deemed it hardly feasible to make the attempt to reach
his views through the medium of signs.</p>

<p>As for Shasta, he did not once look backward to observe what
his passengers were doing. He was propelling his boat through
the water with his usual celerity, his head occasionally turning
slightly as he glanced first at one shore and then the other,
as though looking for some sign or landmark.</p>

<p>The day that succeeded the storm was beautiful and clear, everything
in nature wearing a fresh and rosy look, as if refreshed by the
needed shower. The current of the Salinas was as clear and crystal-like
as though it had not received the muddy contents of a thousand
brooks, rivulets and torrents gorged with the debris and leaves
of its own valley.</p>

<p>"I am troubled by one sore anxiety."</p>

<p>"What can that be?"</p>

<p>"It is for Mr. Shasta. He seems quite forgetful this morning."</p>

<p>"In what respect?" asked Elwood, who did not see the drift of
the Irishman's remarks.</p>

<p>"He hasn't had his breakfast, and he must be faaling a wee bit
hungry, and be the same token, he must be the victim of great
distress, that he hasn't indulged in the use of his pipe."</p>

<p>As Tim O'Rooney had made similar remarks on more than one previous
occasion, it may be that the Pah Utah gathered an inkling of his
meaning, for the words were scarce uttered when the canoes were
headed toward shore, and a landing speedily made.</p>

<p>A piscatorial meal was provided after the manner already fully
given, and when finished the soothing pipe of Tim O'Rooney was
produced and enjoyed to its full extent.</p>

<p>But Shasta showed no disposition to wait, or to indulge in the
solace of the weed. Motioning to his friends to enter the boat,
he towed them to the center of the river, where he loosed the
fastenings, and without a word or sign he headed his canoe up
stream and sped away.</p>

<p>"He is going home," said Howard.</p>

<p>"He must imagine that we are owld enough to walk alone," remarked
Tim as he took the paddle.</p>

<p>"But why not bid us good-by?" asked Elwood.</p>

<p>"As he has already done so," replied Howard, "he doubtless does
not believe in adding a postscript."</p>
