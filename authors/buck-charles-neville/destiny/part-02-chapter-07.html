<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Even in the days of his first, forced marches toward fortune, when
besides his unshakable plunger's nerve he stood almost without an asset,
Hamilton Burton's policy had been that the limelight paid, and as he had
mounted from moderate success into the millionaire class, and thence
into the division rated in a plurality of millions, he had always
adhered to the plan of letting nothing which reflected his personality
fall below the standards of superlative worth and cost.
</p>
<p>At first, he thought of the conspicuousness of wealth as a credential
tending to enlarge the scope and standing of its possessor. In a city
whose public is surfeited with a show of splendor, the man who would
find himself underscored must pitch such conspicuousness to a scale of
rajah-like magnificence.
</p><p>With a thoroughness born of gigantic gambling instinct Hamilton Burton
directed his policy of the outward show and trappings of wealth through
every artery of his life and the lives of his family. Yet, because his
taste was discriminating and sound, he was able to combine the maximum
effect of expenditure with the simplicity of the artistic and to shun
the pitfall of the offensive.
</p><p>In those earlier days when the family was fresh from the frugality of
the hills, its elder members had constantly been appalled by the youth's
extravagance. Yet, even then, he had overruled them with an autocratic
assurance, which knew no doubt. It had not at first been easy for the
gentle mother, whose hands were red from decades of tub and dishpan, and
the father whose fingers had gripped the plow, to adapt themselves to
the idle and effortless régime of this new order.
</p><p>It had for a long while been impossible for them to escape the fear of a
crash in which all this iridescent and artificial seeming must collapse.
But his attitude remained unaltered. "I do not mean to let money be my
master," he had obstinately reiterated. "To me it shall be a slave.
Money conquers the man who fears it. It is an insolent, inanimate
underling, which, if not treated with contempt, becomes a tyrant. Scorn
it and it serves you blindly. I must <u>seem</u> a rich man before I can
become one. It is my wish that my family appear the family of a rich
man. Economies that are apparent are confessions of failure."
</p><p>In the first chapters they protested, but Ham swept their protests
intolerantly aside, and as the years went on he piled miracle upon
miracle until every promise of his unsupported egotism had become an
accomplished and undeniable reality. Then they ceased to fear and
trusted implicitly in the star that led him. Gradually they yielded to
the blandishments of the new life and drifted pleasantly before the
breezes of luxury. The man who had been a bearded and Calvinistic
countryman for almost a half-century became in less than a decade an
ease-loving and slothful old gentleman, dapper of appearance, rosy of
face and inclining toward <u>embonpoint</u>.
</p><p>Now it is fundamentally written in the edicts of Truth that a man must
go forward or back, and if his hands hang idle at his sides, he will not
advance. Thomas Standish Burton was born to buffet the storms of his
mountains, and as long as he followed his destiny he could look his
fellow-man in the face with the level eyes of independence. Within his
limitations, he could think wholesomely and soundly. But here he was a
different man, a Samson shorn, and the things which he had first
contemptuously waved aside or accepted with a growl in his throat, he
now welcomed. The hard brown face was rounded and pink and where there
had been rawhide muscles on his torso there was now soft and fatty
flesh; for Tom Burton whom men had accounted a giant of immovable
resolution back there among the forests was, in these days, a gentleman
and wore a gardenia or a carnation in his lapel. It was not originally
his fault. The process of becoming a gentleman had pained and irked him,
but he had a masterful son who could not afford that his father should
wear a shaggy bark, and that masterful son had been suffocating him with
opulence until his powers of resistance had become atrophied.
</p><p>And the mother, too, had altered, though, in her, the change had been a
sweeter thing. The making of a lady of this remote descendant of
Alexander Hamilton's blood had not been difficult.
</p><p>Some strains of heredity can awaken from the submerged sleep of relapse
as quickly and keenly as a woodsman throws off the mists of slumber.
</p><p>Ham had never feared that his mother would reveal the taint of the
parvenue when she faced the batteries of criticism which guard the
outposts of the social world to which his own prominence gave the
entrée. And Paul, with his gentle love of comfort and his thoughts that
strayed into dreams and music, found the perfumed atmosphere of a
drawing-room very congenial. He breathed the incense of praise from
women who were enraptured as his long fingers stole over the piano keys.
Had his road to artistic recognition lain along the broken trail of
struggle, Paul would have fainted, undiscovered, by the wayside, but
with every difficulty made smooth before his feet and every puddle
carpeted by Hamilton's cloth of gold, he found himself the lionized pet
of inner circles and the favorite of the elect.
</p><p>Of these things Hamilton Burton was thinking as he left his door for the
car that awaited him. From the start he had never deviated from his
well-laid course of determination. Power was his goal and by power he
meant no mean modicum, but limitless strength. He had picked finance as
his field of endeavor because in this day the scepter that sways affairs
must be the scepter of gold. But Hamilton Burton knew that he was only
starting and his plans ran to the future. As he looked ahead he never
forgot that the fighter must be well conditioned. With the discipline of
the boxer in training, he regulated his habits of personal life and held
his splendid nerves steady and above par. No man had ever seen the
dimming cloud of dissipation in his eye nor any gossip-monger whispered
of unwise indulgence. He was spoken of as fastidiously clean of life,
and yet it is doubtful whether any shadow of self-illusion found harbor
in his own mind. In morals as a code inspired of conscience he had no
interest; in rigid self-restraint from all that might impair the highest
efficiency of nerve and brain he was as unyielding as a Trappist. To the
mandate of his single deity, Ambition, he clove with unswerving
sternness. His lavish generosity to his family was a strong and clannish
passion--yet even that was a sort of greater selfishness and all the
world outside he held in ruthless disregard--a realm to conquer. That
one may conquer, many must fall--and to conquer was his one resolve.
</p><p>Even now, awaited by several men who were not accustomed to cooling
their heels in anterooms, he halted at the curb, when he saw another
automobile draw up and recognized his brother Paul.
</p><p>The younger Burton was not so greatly changed. On his cameo features
still lingered the delicate hall-mark of the over-sensitive and about
his lips played the petulant expression of one who could not cope with
the material. His eyes were still pools of brooding darkness, and as he
glanced up and met his brother's smile his expression of pleasure was
boyish and spontaneous.
</p><p>"I came in for a moment to see Mary," he explained as he took his older
brother's hand. "How is she this morning?"
</p><p>"Have your car follow, and drive down-town with me. I want a word with
you and I'm more than an hour late now. You can see Mary afterward."
Ham's suggestions were always couched in mandatory terms, and Paul with
a nod gave the necessary instructions to his own driver. When he was
seated his elder brother inquired with a keen glance of appraisal,
"What's the matter with you, Paul? You look tired."
</p><p>"I am a bit fagged." The answer was almost plaintive. "After I went to
bed last night, or this morning, the scheme of an aria began running
through my head and I couldn't sleep. I had to get up and work it out on
the piano. Listen--it goes like this." Forgetful of time and place, the
musician began whistling the opening bars of his latest composition.
</p><p>Hamilton Burton gazed at the dreamy and fatigued eyes of the other for
a moment before he broke out bluntly: "For heaven's sake, spare me! At
least save it for some more suitable time. Can't you fix it to do some
of your dreaming while you sleep? It seems to me that for a man who has
nothing to do you keep yourself unnecessarily exhausted. Why the devil
aren't you in bed now if you haven't slept during the night?"
</p><p>"I had an appointment for breakfast at twelve."
</p><p>"With some woman, I suppose: some woman who wants to break it to you
gently that when she hears your music a realization steals over her that
she has a soul; that, listening to you, she knows that life holds higher
and nobler things. That sort of appointment, eh?"
</p><p>The younger man flushed deeply. "In point of fact, it is with a lady,"
he admitted.
</p><p>Hamilton Burton frowned. The car was turning into the avenue and the
traffic officer saluted in recognition of the familiar figure, while the
financier with a smile waved one gloved hand. Then the smile disappeared
and the frown returned.
</p><p>"You say you are tired, Paul, and sometimes--I might as well
confess--you make me tired. Your trouble is that you are stifled with
boudoir perfume and suffocated by over-petting. Why don't you try
breathing outdoors sometime? You might like it if you ever made the
experiment."
</p><p>Paul only shook his head. He could never argue with Hamilton and yet on
one or two subjects he was gently and immovably stubborn. So the older
brother shrugged his shoulders and changed the subject.
</p><p>"What progress with the new organ?" he inquired.
</p><p>The responsive face lighted and weariness gave place to the glow of
enthusiasm. Hamilton was installing at the younger man's quarters a
splendid music-room with such an organ as might have graced a cathedral.
There the ardent composer might shut himself off with the swelling
strains of his own music and fare out on the far tide of his dreams.
</p><p>At Madison square the car swung to the left of the Flatiron's sharp prow
and took its course down Broadway, and when it reached Union square the
spring sunlight was shining softly on the spot which has often served as
the people's forum. At the north end a crowd had gathered and from a
drygoods box a speaker was haranguing them. From the violence of the
gestures and the truculence of the voice whose words did not reach him,
Hamilton Burton knew that it was an agitator whose burden was the
hardness of the times and the inequality of living conditions. His lips
shaped themselves for an instant into a smile of satirical amusement.
One who held his fingers so constantly on the pulse of finance was not
in ignorance of the feverish heat that burned through the nation's
arteries. He knew that a rumble of protest was rising from the Battery
to the Golden Gate and that this rumble might be the warning thunder
that runs ahead of a panic's hurricane.
</p><p>But, as his car was passing the crowd, he found himself looking out
across the near heads of the listeners, and upon all the faces he read a
sullen discontent. Some of those men, he surmised, had waited their
turns in the bread line. Some of them came from lodgings where larders
were empty.
</p><p>The chauffeur had swung east to take the more open way and even here he
had to throttle down his gas because of the scattered loungers who had
overflowed the curb. One man of tramp-like appearance stepped directly
in front of the radiator and at the warning of the horn made no effort
to seek safety. He swaggered along with insolent manner at snail's pace,
so that the driver, with a muttered imprecation, brought the car to a
jerking halt, and even then almost grazed with his fender the frayed
sleeve of the trouble-maker.
</p><p>In Union square, as on Riverside Drive, the foliage was tenderly green
and the sunlight was a golden smile. Pushcarts freighted with potted
plants and fruit gave scraps of festal color, and a stand canopied with
a yellow-and-blue umbrella offered pies and sandwiches for sale.
</p><p>But the crowd itself was colorless and somber of mood, and as the car
stopped the speaker pointed to it with a passion-shaken hand, so that
its principal occupant knew that he was recognized and being made the
target of a verbal onslaught. Those men standing nearest turned and
gazed at him with an idle curiosity. They were seeing a
multi-millionaire at close range. But from a few near the center of the
throng came jeers and shouts of insult for the man whom they chose to
regard as a representative of Capital's tyranny. A black-visaged
malcontent of humorless eyes made his way to the margin of the gathering
and, with a pie for which he neglected to pay, opened a fusillade upon
the rich man's car. After that came an orange or two contributed by some
one whose position was strategically close to the fruit-vender's cart
and at last a sounder missile struck and shivered the wind-shield.
</p><p>For just a moment the situation had a precarious seeming for the
reviled young master of finance, and Paul's delicate face blanched a
little. Hamilton Burton regarded himself as the brother of monarchs and
it devolves upon the Crown to face the envious animosity of groundlings.
</p><p>He leaned forward and said quietly to the chauffeur, "Swing around into
the open and drive on."
</p><p>But recognition of the often-photographed face was not confined to the
assailants and instantly the focused humanity was being broken into
scattering factors by police officers who had not hitherto been visible.
The capitalist saw two struggling offenders being roughly hustled away
in the custody of uniformed captors and a patrolman swung to the running
board of the car and remained there as it rounded the square, with his
loosened club swinging ready for service in his right hand.
</p><p>"You weren't struck, were you, Mr. Burton?" he asked in the tone of
solicitude to which Hamilton had grown accustomed, and which he accepted
as a part of his right.
</p><p>He smiled. "No harm done but a broken glass--and the less noise made
about the incident the better I'll be pleased."
</p><p>The car had now reached the south end of the area, where the bronze
Washington stands with his hand raised as if in dignified rebuke for the
noisy demonstrations he so often looks down upon, and where the Marquis
de Lafayette turns his back on the square and gazes at the
moving-picture posters of Fourteenth street.
</p><p>For a minute or two the younger brother sat in nervous silence, and,
when he spoke, he put his question in a voice of anxious concern.
"Aren't you alarmed, Hamilton?"
</p><p>"Alarmed?" The other raised his brows and smiled. His face was placid.
"Don't you remember, Paul, what Charles Fox once had to say on the
subject? At least he got the credit for saying it, which comes to the
same thing. 'A man of power has no other such luxury as being mobbed in
his carriage.'"
</p><p>"I wasn't thinking of just that. I know you aren't afraid of any
physical attack. I was wondering what it all prophesies. We musicians
can feel the crescendo coming from the first mounting bars. Everywhere
there is a spirit of unrest; of revolution. Doesn't it mean a crash--a
panic?"
</p><p>Again the man whose brain had turned the base metal of poverty into the
gold of Croesus smiled.
</p><p>"I'm not a betting man, Paul, but I'd be willing to lay a moderate wager
that within the next year or two we shall see a panic that will leave
many scars and not a few wrecks."
</p><p>"And that conviction doesn't alarm you?" The musician let his features
mirror his nervous surprise. If the principal had no fear, at least the
dependent was in terror.
</p><p>The amusement left Hamilton Burton's eyes and into them came the harder
gleam. "Paul, you know as little about finance as I know about music.
I've done what I've done by following one law: the leashing of forces.
Electricity is force, but electricity unharnessed is lightning which
devastates. Fire, uncontrolled, ravages, but, held in check, makes
power. Every force in a man's nature that is not curbed becomes a
weakness. The only difference between success and failure is the twist
given to the initial impulse. Every danger and peril, if foreseen and
met, becomes opportunity."
</p><p>Paul shook his head. "As you say," he admitted, "I don't understand
these things. I thought panics were hurricanes that swept fortunes
away."
</p><p>The elder brother laid an immaculately gloved hand on the coat-sleeve of
the younger.
</p><p>"It's a thing I wouldn't confide to any one else, but I trust you even
if I don't give a damn for your judgment. As you say, hurricanes mean
ruin--for the unprepared, but there are also men to whom hurricanes
mean--salvage."
</p><p>For an instant, the hard fire of ruthless conquest burned so fiercely in
Hamilton Burton's eyes that Paul drew back and shuddered, then he heard
the quiet voice continuing. "I am now rated among the first few in the
world of American finance. There are others above me. I am one of twelve
or fifteen. When this storm has taken its toll and spent its rage--then
I shall be one of one, and above me there will be--no other man."
</p><hr/>
<p>At the same time, though the twenty-four figured dials of Italian clocks
recorded a later hour, a young man of more than ordinarily likable
appearance sat alone at a terrace table of a Capri inn. Near by a
company of sashed and spangled peasants danced to the accompaniment of
guitars and mandolins, but he did not seem to see them and when they
presented their tambourines for largesse, he roused himself almost with
a start to search his pockets for <u>lire</u>.
</p><p>Behind him were the colorful and steep vistas that lay along the zig-zag
roads where ramshackle victorias clattered at crazy speed. Below him was
the world's most vivid spread of sun-kissed color; the Bay of Naples
curving nobly from his point of view to Ischia's misty bulwark, in a
glistening spread of sapphire. Standing guard over the picture was the
great cone of Vesuvius. But of these things also the solitary young man
seemed oblivious.
</p><p>Against his wicker-bound carafe of pale Capri wine stood propped an old
Paris edition of the <u>New York Herald</u>. It was folded so that a portrait
of a woman could be seen to the best advantage, and to the exclusion of
flagstoned courtyards and trellised, overhanging vines; to the exclusion
of the bay's great jewel of beauty, this picture held the eyes of the
man who lunched alone. They were good eyes, of the sort that look life
straight in the face, and their pupils were such as impress the beholder
with a conviction of fearless integrity. Now they were preoccupied, and
a little annoyed. Even in the lifelessness of black and white the face
he studied was one of remarkable beauty, and it pleased him to imagine
the wonderful difference and illumination which color and swift play of
expression would bring to its features.
</p><p>For several reasons, the face was of more than commonplace interest to
him. Years ago he had seen it by a roadside in the White Mountains, and
often since he had thought of it until the thought had taken deep root
in his mind and become one of the pleasant dreams of his life. But Fate
had further spurred his curiosity by a series of mischances which had
prevented his meeting this girl, though often in his travels his
arrivals had followed close enough on her departures to permit his
hearing talk of her great charm and her many conquests.
</p><p>For several years Jefferson Edwardes had been in control of that branch
of his firm's business which operated from St. Petersburg. Now he was
returning to New York to take up larger affairs. An uncle's death had
necessitated his personal supervision of the home office.
</p><p>He had heard that Mary Burton was in Naples and had decided to break his
own journey there in the hope of meeting her--and perhaps returning on
the same steamer. Now he learned that once more he was too late.
</p><p>But what annoyed the young millionaire more poignantly was the thinly
veiled hint that the Duke de Metuan had also sailed for America as one
of her fellow-passengers.
</p><p>The whimsical little laughter wrinkles about Edwardes' eyes radiated
from twinkling pupils as he calmly asked himself what concern this was
of his; this news of a woman he had never known except once long ago in
a world of abandoned farms. But the laughter died quickly, because,
absurd as it was by all practical standards, he knew that he had let his
dream become too important for abandonment without the test of renewed
acquaintanceship. He resented the Duke de Metuan. He was not unfamiliar
with Continental affairs and some of the nobleman's financial troubles
had sought solution through his banking house. Of course, the Mary
Burton of his dreams might have no existence in reality. This woman had
had ample opportunity to be spoiled--but if she had not been--There he
broke off and took a long breath. If the girl's heart had worthy kinship
with her beauty, she would be a miracle worth following over seas. At
all events, he was sailing tomorrow and her world would also be his. It
would not be difficult to learn the truth.
