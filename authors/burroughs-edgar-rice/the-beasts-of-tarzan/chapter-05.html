By the time that Tarzan had travelled entirely about the coast
of the island, and made several trips inland from various points,
he was sure that he was the only human being upon it.
<P>
Nowhere had he found any sign that men had stopped even
temporarily upon this shore, though, of course, he knew that
so quickly does the rank vegetation of the tropics erase all
but the most permanent of human monuments that he might
be in error in his deductions.
<P>
The day following the killing of Numa, Tarzan and Sheeta came upon
the tribe of Akut.  At sight of the panther the great apes
took to flight, but after a time Tarzan succeeded in recalling them.
<P>
It had occurred to him that it would be at least an interesting
experiment to attempt to reconcile these hereditary enemies.
He welcomed anything that would occupy his time and his mind
beyond the filling of his belly and the gloomy thoughts to which
he fell prey the moment that he became idle.
<P>
To communicate his plan to the apes was not a particularly
difficult matter, though their narrow and limited vocabulary
was strained in the effort; but to impress upon the little,
wicked brain of Sheeta that he was to hunt with and not for
his legitimate prey proved a task almost beyond the powers
of the ape-man.
<P>
Tarzan, among his other weapons, possessed a long, stout
cudgel, and after fastening his rope about the panther's neck
he used this instrument freely upon the snarling beast,
endeavouring in this way to impress upon its memory that
it must not attack the great, shaggy manlike creatures that
had approached more closely once they had seen the purpose
of the rope about Sheeta's neck.
<P>
That the cat did not turn and rend Tarzan is something of
a miracle which may possibly be accounted for by the fact
that twice when it turned growling upon the ape-man he had
rapped it sharply upon its sensitive nose, inculcating in its
mind thereby a most wholesome fear of the cudgel and the
ape-beasts behind it.
<P>
It is a question if the original cause of his attachment for
Tarzan was still at all clear in the mind of the panther,
though doubtless some subconscious suggestion, superinduced by
this primary reason and aided and abetted by the habit of the past
few days, did much to compel the beast to tolerate treatment at his
hands that would have sent it at the throat of any other creature.
<P>
Then, too, there was the compelling force of the manmind exerting
its powerful influence over this creature of a lower order, and,
after all, it may have been this that proved the most potent factor
in Tarzan's supremacy over Sheeta and the other beasts of the jungle
that had from time to time fallen under his domination.
<P>
Be that as it may, for days the man, the panther, and the
great apes roamed their savage haunts side by side, making
their kills together and sharing them with one another, and
of all the fierce and savage band none was more terrible than
the smooth-skinned, powerful beast that had been but a few
short months before a familiar figure in many a London
drawing room.
<P>
Sometimes the beasts separated to follow their own inclinations
for an hour or a day, and it was upon one of these occasions when
the ape-man had wandered through the tree-tops toward the beach,
and was stretched in the hot sun upon the sand, that from the low
summit of a near-by promontory a pair of keen eyes discovered him.
<P>
For a moment the owner of the eyes looked in astonishment
at the figure of the savage white man basking in the
rays of that hot, tropic sun; then he turned, making a sign to
some one behind him.  Presently another pair of eyes were
looking down upon the ape-man, and then another and another,
until a full score of hideously trapped, savage warriors
were lying upon their bellies along the crest of the ridge
watching the white-skinned stranger.
<P>
They were down wind from Tarzan, and so their scent was
not carried to him, and as his back was turned half toward
them he did not see their cautious advance over the edge of
the promontory and down through the rank grass toward the
sandy beach where he lay.
<P>
Big fellows they were, all of them, their barbaric
headdresses and grotesquely painted faces, together with their
many metal ornaments and gorgeously coloured feathers,
adding to their wild, fierce appearance.
<P>
Once at the foot of the ridge, they came cautiously to their feet,
and, bent half-double, advanced silently upon the unconscious white man,
their heavy war-clubs swinging menacingly in their brawny hands.
<P>
The mental suffering that Tarzan's sorrowful thoughts induced had the
effect of numbing his keen, perceptive faculties, so that the
advancing savages were almost upon him before he became aware
that he was no longer alone upon the beach.
<P>
So quickly, though, were his mind and muscles wont to
react in unison to the slightest alarm that he was upon his
feet and facing his enemies, even as he realized that
something was behind him.  As he sprang to his feet the warriors
leaped toward him with raised clubs and savage yells, but the
foremost went down to sudden death beneath the long, stout
stick of the ape-man, and then the lithe, sinewy figure was
among them, striking right and left with a fury, power, and
precision that brought panic to the ranks of the blacks.
<P>
For a moment they withdrew, those that were left of them,
and consulted together at a short distance from the ape-man,
who stood with folded arms, a half-smile upon his handsome
face, watching them.  Presently they advanced upon him once
more, this time wielding their heavy war-spears.  They were
between Tarzan and the jungle, in a little semicircle that
closed in upon him as they advanced.
<P>
There seemed to the ape-man but slight chance to escape
the final charge when all the great spears should be hurled
simultaneously at him; but if he had desired to escape
there was no way other than through the ranks of the savages
except the open sea behind him.
<P>
His predicament was indeed most serious when an idea
occurred to him that altered his smile to a broad grin.  
The warriors were still some little distance away,
advancing slowly, making, after the manner of their kind,
a frightful din with their savage yells and the pounding
of their naked feet upon the ground as they leaped up and
down in a fantastic war dance.
<P>
Then it was that the ape-man lifted his voice in a series of
wild, weird screams that brought the blacks to a sudden,
perplexed halt.  They looked at one another questioningly,
for here was a sound so hideous that their own frightful din
faded into insignificance beside it.  No human throat could
have formed those bestial notes, they were sure, and yet with
their own eyes they had seen this white man open his mouth
to pour forth his awful cry.
<P>
But only for a moment they hesitated, and then with one accord
they again took up their fantastic advance upon their prey;
but even then a sudden crashing in the jungle behind them
brought them once more to a halt, and as they turned to look
in the direction of this new noise there broke upon their
startled visions a sight that may well have frozen the blood
of braver men than the Wagambi.
<P>
Leaping from the tangled vegetation of the jungle's rim
came a huge panther, with blazing eyes and bared fangs, and
in his wake a score of mighty, shaggy apes lumbering rapidly
toward them, half erect upon their short, bowed legs, and
with their long arms reaching to the ground, where their
horny knuckles bore the weight of their ponderous bodies as
they lurched from side to side in their grotesque advance.
<P>
The beasts of Tarzan had come in answer to his call.
<P>
Before the Wagambi could recover from their astonishment
the frightful horde was upon them from one side and
Tarzan of the Apes from the other.  Heavy spears were hurled
and mighty war-clubs wielded, and though apes went down
never to rise, so, too, went down the men of Ugambi.
<P>
Sheeta's cruel fangs and tearing talons ripped and tore at
the black hides.  Akut's mighty yellow tusks found the jugular
of more than one sleek-skinned savage, and Tarzan of the Apes
was here and there and everywhere, urging on his fierce allies
and taking a heavy toll with his long, slim knife.
<P>
In a moment the blacks had scattered for their lives, but
of the score that had crept down the grassy sides of the
promontory only a single warrior managed to escape the horde
that had overwhelmed his people.
<P>
This one was Mugambi, chief of the Wagambi of Ugambi,
and as he disappeared in the tangled luxuriousness of the
rank growth upon the ridge's summit only the keen eyes of
the ape-man saw the direction of his flight.
<P>
Leaving his pack to eat their fill upon the flesh of their
victims--flesh that he could not touch--Tarzan of the Apes
pursued the single survivor of the bloody fray.  Just beyond
the ridge he came within sight of the fleeing black, making
with headlong leaps for a long war-canoe that was drawn
well up upon the beach above the high tide surf.
<P>
Noiseless as the fellow's shadow, the ape-man raced after the
terror-stricken black.  In the white man's mind was a new plan,
awakened by sight of the war-canoe.  If these men had
come to his island from another, or from the mainland,
why not utilize their craft to make his way to the country from
which they had come?  Evidently it was an inhabited country,
and no doubt had occasional intercourse with the mainland,
if it were not itself upon the continent of Africa.
<P>
A heavy hand fell upon the shoulder of the escaping Mugambi
before he was aware that he was being pursued, and as he
turned to do battle with his assailant giant fingers closed
about his wrists and he was hurled to earth with a giant
astride him before he could strike a blow in his own defence.
<P>
In the language of the West Coast, Tarzan spoke to the
prostrate man beneath him.
<P>
"Who are you?" he asked.
<P>
"Mugambi, chief of the Wagambi," replied the black.
<P>
"I will spare your life," said Tarzan, "if you will promise
to help me to leave this island.  What do you answer?"
<P>
"I will help you," replied Mugambi.  "But now that you
have killed all my warriors, I do not know that even I can
leave your country, for there will be none to wield the paddles,
and without paddlers we cannot cross the water."
<P>
Tarzan rose and allowed his prisoner to come to his feet.  
The fellow was a magnificent specimen of manhood--a black
counterpart in physique of the splendid white man whom he faced.
<P>
"Come!" said the ape-man, and started back in the direction
from which they could hear the snarling and growling
of the feasting pack.  Mugambi drew back.
<P>
"They will kill us," he said.
<P>
"I think not," replied Tarzan.  "They are mine."
<P>
Still the black hesitated, fearful of the consequences of
approaching the terrible creatures that were dining upon the
bodies of his warriors; but Tarzan forced him to accompany him,
and presently the two emerged from the jungle in full view
of the grisly spectacle upon the beach.  At sight of the
men the beasts looked up with menacing growls, but Tarzan
strode in among them, dragging the trembling Wagambi with him.
<P>
As he had taught the apes to accept Sheeta, so he taught
them to adopt Mugambi as well, and much more easily; but
Sheeta seemed quite unable to understand that though he had
been called upon to devour Mugambi's warriors he was not
to be allowed to proceed after the same fashion with Mugambi.  
However, being well filled, he contented himself with
walking round the terror-stricken savage, emitting low,
menacing growls the while he kept his flaming, baleful
eyes riveted upon the black.
<P>
Mugambi, on his part, clung closely to Tarzan, so that the
ape-man could scarce control his laughter at the pitiable
condition to which the chief's fear had reduced him; but at length
the white took the great cat by the scruff of the neck and,
dragging it quite close to the Wagambi, slapped it sharply
upon the nose each time that it growled at the stranger.
<P>
At the sight of the thing--a man mauling with his bare
hands one of the most relentless and fierce of the jungle
carnivora--Mugambi's eyes bulged from their sockets, and
from entertaining a sullen respect for the giant white man
who had made him prisoner, the black felt an almost
worshipping awe of Tarzan.
<P>
The education of Sheeta progressed so well that in a short
time Mugambi ceased to be the object of his hungry attention,
and the black felt a degree more of safety in his society.
<P>
To say that Mugambi was entirely happy or at ease in his
new environment would not be to adhere strictly to the truth.
His eyes were constantly rolling apprehensively from side to
side as now one and now another of the fierce pack chanced
to wander near him, so that for the most of the time it was
principally the whites that showed.
<P>
Together Tarzan and Mugambi, with Sheeta and Akut, lay
in wait at the ford for a deer, and when at a word from the
ape-man the four of them leaped out upon the affrighted animal
the black was sure that the poor creature died of fright
before ever one of the great beasts touched it.
<P>
Mugambi built a fire and cooked his portion of the kill;
but Tarzan, Sheeta, and Akut tore theirs, raw, with their
sharp teeth, growling among themselves when one ventured
to encroach upon the share of another.
<P>
It was not, after all, strange that the white man's ways
should have been so much more nearly related to those of
the beasts than were the savage blacks.  We are, all of us,
creatures of habit, and when the seeming necessity for
schooling ourselves in new ways ceases to exist, we fall
naturally and easily into the manners and customs which long
usage has implanted ineradicably within us.
<P>
Mugambi from childhood had eaten no meat until it had
been cooked, while Tarzan, on the other hand, had never
tasted cooked food of any sort until he had grown almost to
manhood, and only within the past three or four years had
he eaten cooked meat.  Not only did the habit of a lifetime
prompt him to eat it raw, but the craving of his palate as well;
for to him cooked flesh was spoiled flesh when compared
with the rich and juicy meat of a fresh, hot kill.
<P>
That he could, with relish, eat raw meat that had been
buried by himself weeks before, and enjoy small rodents and
disgusting grubs, seems to us who have been always "civilized"
a revolting fact; but had we learned in childhood to
eat these things, and had we seen all those about us eat them,
they would seem no more sickening to us now than do many
of our greatest dainties, at which a savage African cannibal
would look with repugnance and turn up his nose.
<P>
For instance, there is a tribe in the vicinity of Lake Rudolph
that will eat no sheep or cattle, though its next neighbors
do so.  Near by is another tribe that eats donkey-meat--a
custom most revolting to the surrounding tribes that do not
eat donkey.  So who may say that it is nice to eat snails and
frogs' legs and oysters, but disgusting to feed upon grubs
and beetles, or that a raw oyster, hoof, horns, and tail, is less
revolting than the sweet, clean meat of a fresh-killed buck?
<P>
The next few days Tarzan devoted to the weaving of a barkcloth
sail with which to equip the canoe, for he despaired of being able
to teach the apes to wield the paddles, though he did manage to get
several of them to embark in the frail craft which he and Mugambi
paddled about inside the reef where the water was quite smooth.
<P>
During these trips he had placed paddles in their hands,
when they attempted to imitate the movements of him and
Mugambi, but so difficult is it for them long to concentrate
upon a thing that he soon saw that it would require weeks of
patient training before they would be able to make any
effective use of these new implements, if, in fact,
they should ever do so.
<P>
There was one exception, however, and he was Akut.  Almost from
the first he showed an interest in this new sport that
revealed a much higher plane of intelligence than that
attained by any of his tribe.  He seemed to grasp the purpose
of the paddles, and when Tarzan saw that this was so he took
much pains to explain in the meagre language of the anthropoid
how they might be used to the best advantage.
<P>
From Mugambi Tarzan learned that the mainland lay but
a short distance from the island.  It seemed that the Wagambi
warriors had ventured too far out in their frail craft,
and when caught by a heavy tide and a high wind from offshore
they had been driven out of sight of land.  After paddling
for a whole night, thinking that they were headed for home,
they had seen this land at sunrise, and, still taking it for
the mainland, had hailed it with joy, nor had Mugambi been
aware that it was an island until Tarzan had told him that
this was the fact.
<P>
The Wagambi chief was quite dubious as to the sail, for
he had never seen such a contrivance used.  His country lay
far up the broad Ugambi River, and this was the first occasion
that any of his people had found their way to the ocean.
<P>
Tarzan, however, was confident that with a good west wind he
could navigate the little craft to the mainland.  At any rate,
he decided, it would be preferable to perish on the way than to
remain indefinitely upon this evidently uncharted island to
which no ships might ever be expected to come.
<P>
And so it was that when the first fair wind rose he embarked
upon his cruise, and with him he took as strange and
fearsome a crew as ever sailed under a savage master.
<P>
Mugambi and Akut went with him, and Sheeta, the panther,
and a dozen great males of the tribe of Akut.
