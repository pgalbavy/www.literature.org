<p>We stared at Bausi and Bausi stared at us.
</p><p>“I am the Black Elephant Bausi,” he exclaimed at last, worn out by our
solid silence, “and I trumpet! I trumpet! I trumpet!” (It appeared that
this was the ancient and hallowed formula with which a Mazitu king was
wont to open a conversation with strangers.)
</p><p>After a suitable pause I replied in a cold voice:
</p><p>“We are the white lions, Macumazana and Wazela, and we roar! we roar! we
roar!”
</p><p>“I can trample,” said Bausi.
</p><p>“And we can bite,” I said haughtily, though how we were to bite or do
anything else effectual with nothing but a Union Jack, I did not in the
least know.
</p><p>“What is that thing?” asked Bausi, pointing to the flag.
</p><p>“That which shadows the whole earth,” I answered proudly, a remark that
seemed to impress him, although he did not at all understand it, for he
ordered a soldier to hold a palm leaf umbrella over him to prevent it
from shadowing <u>him</u>.
</p><p>“And that,” he asked again, pointing to the music box, “which is not
alive and yet makes a noise?”
</p><p>“That sings the war-song of our people,” I said. “We sent it to you as a
present and you returned it. Why do you return our presents, O Bausi?”
</p><p>Then of a sudden this potentate grew furious.
</p><p>“Why do you come here, white men,” he asked, “uninvited and against
the law of my land, where only one white man is welcome, my brother
Dogeetah, who cured me of sickness with a knife? I know who you are. You
are dealers in men. You come here to steal my people and sell them into
slavery. You had many slaves with you on the borders of my country,
but you sent them away. You shall die, you shall die, you who call
yourselves lions, and the painted rag which you say shadows the world,
shall rot with your bones. As for that box which sings a war-song, I
will smash it; it shall not bewitch me as your magic shield bewitched my
great doctor, Imbozwi, burning off his hair.”
</p><p>Then springing up with wonderful agility for one so fat, he knocked the
musical box from Hans’ head, so that it fell to the ground and after a
little whirring grew silent.
</p><p>“That is right,” squeaked Imbozwi. “Trample on their magic, O Elephant.
Kill them, O Black One; burn them as they burned my hair.”
</p><p>Now things were, I felt, very serious, for already Bausi was looking
about him as though to order his soldiers to make an end of us. So I
said in desperation:
</p><p>“O King, you mentioned a certain white man, Dogeetah, a doctor of
doctors, who cured you of sickness with a knife, and called him your
brother. Well, he is our brother also, and it was by his invitation that
we have come to visit you here, where he will meet us presently.”
</p><p>“If Dogeetah is your friend, then you are my friends,” answered Bausi,
“for in this land he rules as I rule, he whose blood flows in my veins,
as my blood flows in his veins. But you lie. Dogeetah is no brother of
slave-dealers, his heart is good and yours are evil. You say that he
will meet you here. When will he meet you? Tell me, and if it is soon, I
will hold my hand and wait to hear his report of you before I put you to
death, for if he speaks well of you, you shall not die.”
</p><p>Now I hesitated, as well I might, for I felt that looking at our case
from his point of view, Bausi, believing us to be slave-traders, was
not angry without cause. While I was racking my brains for a reply that
might be acceptable to him and would not commit us too deeply, to my
astonishment Mavovo stepped forward and confronted the king.
</p><p>“Who are you, fellow?” shouted Bausi.
</p><p>“I am a warrior, O King, as my scars show,” and he pointed to the
assegai wounds upon his breast and to his cut nostril. “I am a chief of
a people from whom your people sprang and my name is Mavovo, Mavovo who
is ready to fight you or any man whom you may name, and to kill him or
you if you will. Is there one here who wishes to be killed?”
</p><p>No one answered, for the mighty-chested Zulu looked very formidable.
</p><p>“I am a doctor also,” went on Mavovo, “one of the greatest of doctors
who can open the ‘Gates of Distance’ and read that which is hid in the
womb of the Future. Therefore I will answer your questions which you
put to the lord Macumazana, the great and wise white man whom I serve,
because we have fought together in many battles. Yes, I will be his
Mouth, I will answer. The white man Dogeetah, who is your blood-brother
and whose word is your word among the Mazitu, will arrive here at sunset
on the second day from now. I have spoken.”
</p><p>Bausi looked at me in question.
</p><p>“Yes,” I exclaimed, feeling that I must say something and that it did
not much matter what I said, “Dogeetah will arrive here on the second
day from now within half an hour after sunset.”
</p><p>Something, I know not what, prompted me to allow that extra half-hour,
which in the event, saved all our lives. Now Bausi consulted a while
with the execrable Imbozwi and also with the old one-eyed General
Babemba while we watched, knowing that our fate hung upon the issue.
</p><p>At length he spoke.
</p><p>“White men,” he said, “Imbozwi, the head of the witch-finders here,
whose hair you burnt off by your evil magic, says that it would be
better to kill you at once as your hearts are bad and you are planning
mischief against my people. So I think also. But Babemba my General,
with whom I am angry because he did not obey my orders and put you
to death on the borders of my country when he met you there with your
caravan of slaves, thinks otherwise. He prays me to hold my hand, first
because you have bewitched him into liking you and secondly because if
you should happen to be speaking the truth--which we do not believe--and
to have come here at the invitation of my brother Dogeetah, he,
Dogeetah, would be pained if he arrived and found you dead, nor could
even he bring you to life again. This being so, since it matters little
whether you die now or later, my command is that you be kept prisoners
till sunset of the second day from this, and that then you will be
led out and tied to stakes in the market-place, there to wait till
the approach of darkness, by when you say Dogeetah will be here. If
he arrives and owns you as his brethren, well and good; if he does not
arrive, or disowns you--better still, for then you shall be shot to
death with arrows as a warning to all other stealers of men not to cross
the borders of the Mazitu.”
</p><p>I listened to this atrocious sentence with horror, then gasped out:
</p><p>“We are not stealers of men, O King, we are freers of men, as Tom and
Jerry of your own people could tell you.”
</p><p>“Who are Tom and Jerry?” he asked, indifferently. “Well, it does not
matter, for doubtless they are liars like the rest of you. I have
spoken. Take them away, feed them well and keep them safe till within an
hour of sunset on the second day from this.”
</p><p>Then, without giving us any further opportunity of speaking, Bausi rose,
and followed by Imbozwi and his councillors, marched off into his big
hut. We too, were marched off, this time under a double guard commanded
by someone whom I had not seen before. At the gate of the kraal we
halted and asked for the arms that had been taken from us. No answer was
given; only the soldiers put their hands upon our shoulders and thrust
us along.
</p><p>“This is a nice business,” I whispered to Stephen.
</p><p>“Oh! it doesn’t matter,” he answered. “There are lots more guns in the
huts. I am told that these Mazitus are dreadfully afraid of bullets. So
all we have to do is just to break out and shoot our way through them,
for of course they will run when we begin to fire.”
</p><p>I looked at him but did not answer, for to tell the truth I felt in no
mood for argument.
</p><p>Presently we arrived at our quarters, where the soldiers left us, to
camp outside. Full of his warlike plan, Stephen went at once to the hut
in which the slavers’ guns had been stored with our own spare rifles and
all the ammunition. I saw him emerge looking very blank indeed and asked
him what was the matter.
</p><p>“Matter!” he answered in a voice that for once really was full of
dismay. “The matter is that those Mazitu have stolen all the guns
and all the ammunition. There’s not enough powder left to make a blue
devil.”
</p><p>“Well,” I replied, with the kind of joke one perpetrates under such
circumstances, “we shall have plenty of blue devils without making any
more.”
</p><p>Truly ours was a dreadful situation. Let the reader imagine it. Within
a little more than forty-eight hours we were to be shot to death with
arrows if an erratic old gentleman who, for aught I knew might be
dead, did not turn up at what was then one of the remotest and most
inaccessible spots in Central Africa. Moreover, our only hope that such
a thing would happen, if hope it could be called, was the prophecy of a
Kaffir witch-doctor.
</p><p>To rely on this in any way was so absurd that I gave up thinking of
it and set my mind to considering if there were any possible means of
escape. After hours of reflection I could find none. Even Hans, with
all his experience and nearly superhuman cunning, could suggest none.
We were unarmed and surrounded by thousands of savages, all of whom
save perhaps Babemba, believed us to be slave-traders, a race that very
properly they held in abhorrence, who had visited the country with the
object of stealing their women and children. The king, Bausi, a very
prejudiced fellow, was dead against us. Also by a piece of foolishness
which I now bitterly regretted, as indeed I regretted the whole
expedition, or at any rate entering on it in the absence of Brother
John, we had made an implacable enemy of the head medicine-man, who to
these folk was a sort of Archbishop of Canterbury. Short of a miracle,
there was no hope for us. All that we could do was to say our prayers
and prepare for the end.
</p><p>Mavovo, it is true, remained cheerful. His faith in his “Snake” was
really touching. He offered to go through that divination process again
in our presence and demonstrate that there was no mistake. I declined
because I had no faith in divinations, and Stephen also declined, for
another reason, namely that the result might prove to be different,
which, he held, would be depressing. The other Zulus oscillated between
belief and scepticism, as do the unstable who set to work to study the
evidences of Christianity. But Sammy did not oscillate, he literally
howled, and prepared the food which poured in upon us so badly that I
had to turn on Hans to do the cooking, for however little appetite we
might have, it was necessary that we should keep up our strength by
eating.
</p><p>“What, Mr. Quatermain,” asked Sammy between his tears, “is the use of
dressing viands that our systems will never have time to thoroughly
assimilate?”
</p><p>The first night passed somehow, and so did the next day and the next
night which heralded our last morning. I got up quite early and watched
the sunrise. Never, I think, had I realised before what a beautiful
thing the sunrise is, at least not to the extent I did now when I was
saying good-bye to it for ever. Unless indeed there should prove to be
still lovelier sunrises beyond the dark of death! Then I went into
our hut, and as Stephen, who had the nerves of a rhinoceros, was still
sleeping like a tortoise in winter, I said my prayers earnestly enough,
mourned over my sins which proved to be so many that at last I gave up
the job in despair, and then tried to occupy myself by reading the Old
Testament, a book to which I have always been extremely attached.
</p><p>As a passage that I lit on described how the prophet Samuel for whom I
could not help reading “Imbozwi,” hewed Agag in pieces after Bausi--I
mean Saul--had relented and spared his life, I cannot say that it
consoled me very much. Doubtless, I reflected, these people believe that
I, like Agag, had “made women childless” by my sword, so there remained
nothing save to follow the example of that unhappy king and walk
“delicately” to doom.
</p><p>Then, as Stephen was still sleeping--how <u>could</u> he do it, I wondered--I
set to work to make up the accounts of the expedition to date. It had
already cost £1,423. Just fancy expending £1,423 in order to be tied to
a post and shot to death with arrows. And all to get a rare orchid! Oh!
I reflected to myself, if by some marvel I should escape, or if I should
live again in any land where these particular flowers flourish, I would
never even look at them. And as a matter of fact I never have.
</p><p>At length Stephen did wake up and, as criminals are reported to do in
the papers before execution, made an excellent breakfast.
</p><p>“What’s the good of worrying?” he said presently. “I shouldn’t if it
weren’t for my poor old father. It must have come to this one day, and
the sooner it is over the sooner to sleep, as the song says. When one
comes to think of it there are enormous advantages in sleep, for that’s
the only time one is quite happy. Still, I should have liked to see that
Cypripedium first.”
</p><p>“Oh! drat the Cypripedium!” I exclaimed, and blundered from the hut to
tell Sammy that if he didn’t stop his groaning I would punch his head.
</p><p>“Jumps! Regular jumps! Who’d have thought it of Quatermain?” I heard
Stephen mutter in the intervals of lighting his pipe.
</p><p>The morning went “like lightning that is greased,” as Sammy remarked.
Three o’clock came and Mavovo and his following sacrificed a kid to
the spirits of their ancestors, which, as Sammy remarked again, was “a
horrible, heathen ceremony much calculated to prejudice our cause with
Powers Above.”
</p><p>When it was over, to my delight, Babemba appeared. He looked so pleasant
that I jumped to the conclusion that he brought the best of news
with him. Perhaps that the king had pardoned us, or perhaps--blessed
thought--that Brother John had really arrived before his time.
</p><p>But not a bit of it! All he had to say was that he had caused inquiries
to be made along the route that ran to the coast and that certainly
for a hundred miles there was at present no sign of Dogeetah. So as the
Black Elephant was growing more and more enraged under the stirrings
up of Imbozwi, it was obvious that that evening’s ceremony must be
performed. Indeed, as it was part of his duty to superintend the
erection of the posts to which we were to be tied and the digging of
our graves at their bases, he had just come to count us again to be sure
that he had not made any mistake as to the number. Also, if there were
any articles that we would like buried with us, would we be so kind as
to point them out and he would be sure to see to the matter. It would be
soon over, and not painful, he added, as he had selected the very best
archers in Beza Town who rarely missed and could, most of them, send an
arrow up to the feather into a buffalo.
</p><p>Then he chatted a little about other matters, as to where he should
find the magic shield I had given him, which he would always value as a
souvenir, etc., took a pinch of snuff with Mavovo and departed, saying
that he would be sure to return again at the proper time.
</p><p>It was now four o’clock, and as Sammy was quite beyond it, Stephen made
himself some tea. It was very good tea, especially as we had milk to put
in it, although I did not remember what it tasted like till afterwards.
</p><p>Now, having abandoned hope, I went into a hut alone to compose myself
to meet my end like a gentleman, and seated there in silence and
semi-darkness my spirit grew much calmer. After all, I reflected, why
should I cling to life? In the country whither I travelled, as the
reader who has followed my adventures will know, were some whom I
clearly longed to see again, notably my father and my mother, and two
noble women who were even more to me. My boy, it is true, remained (he
was alive then), but I knew that he would find friends, and as I was not
so badly off at that time, I had been able to make a proper provision
for him. Perhaps it was better that I should go, seeing that if I lived
on it would only mean more troubles and more partings.
</p><p>What was about to befall me of course I could not tell, but I knew then
as I know now, that it was not extinction or even that sleep of which
Stephen had spoken. Perhaps I was passing to some place where at length
the clouds would roll away and I should understand; whence, too, I
should see all the landscape of the past and future, as an eagle does
watching from the skies, and be no longer like one struggling through
dense bush, wild-beast and serpent haunted, beat upon by the storms of
heaven and terrified with its lightnings, nor knowing whither I hewed
my path. Perhaps in that place there would be no longer what St. Paul
describes as another law in my members warring against the law of my
mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin. Perhaps there
the past would be forgiven by the Power which knows whereof we are made,
and I should become what I have always longed to be--good in every sense
and even find open to me new and better roads of service. I take these
thoughts from a note that I made in my pocket-book at the time.
</p><p>Thus I reflected and then wrote a few lines of farewell in the fond
and foolish hope that somehow they might find those to whom they were
addressed (I have those letters still and very oddly they read to-day).
This done, I tried to throw out my mind towards Brother John if he still
lived, as indeed I had done for days past, so that I might inform him of
our plight and, I am afraid, reproach him for having brought us to such
an end by his insane carelessness or want of faith.
</p><p>Whilst I was still engaged thus Babemba arrived with his soldiers to
lead us off to execution. It was Hans who came to tell me that he was
there. The poor old Hottentot shook me by the hand and wiped his eyes
with his ragged coat-sleeve.
</p><p>“Oh! Baas, this is our last journey,” he said, “and you are going to
be killed, Baas, and it is all my fault, Baas, because I ought to have
found a way out of the trouble which is what I was hired to do. But
I can’t, my head grows so stupid. Oh! if only I could come even with
Imbozwi I shouldn’t mind, and I will, I <u>will</u>, if I have to return as a
ghost to do it. Well, Baas, you know the Predikant, your father, told
us that we don’t go out like a fire, but burn again for always
elsewhere----”
</p><p>(“I hope not,” I thought to myself.)
</p><p>“And that quite easily without anything to pay for the wood. So I hope
that we shall always burn together, Baas. And meanwhile, I have brought
you a little something,” and he produced what looked like a peculiarly
obnoxious horseball. “You swallow this now and you will never feel
anything; it is a very good medicine that my grandfather’s grandfather
got from the Spirit of his tribe. You will just go to sleep as nicely
as though you were very drunk, and wake up in the beautiful fire which
burns without any wood and never goes out for ever and ever, Amen.”
</p><p>“No, Hans,” I said, “I prefer to die with my eyes open.”
</p><p>“And so would I, Baas, if I thought there was any good in keeping them
open, but I don’t, for I can’t believe any more in the Snake of that
black fool, Mavovo. If it had been a good Snake, it would have told him
to keep clear of Beza Town, so I will swallow one of these pills and
give the other to the Baas Stephen,” and he crammed the filthy mess into
his mouth and with an effort got it down, as a young turkey does a ball
of meal that is too big for its throat.
</p><p>Then, as I heard Stephen calling me, I left him invoking a most
comprehensive and polyglot curse upon the head of Imbozwi, to whom he
rightly attributed all our woes.
</p><p>“Our friend here says it is time to start,” said Stephen, rather
shakily, for the situation seemed to have got a hold of him at last,
and nodding towards old Babemba, who stood there with a cheerful smile
looking as though he were going to conduct us to a wedding.
</p><p>“Yes, white lord,” said Babemba, “it is time, and I have hurried so as
not to keep you waiting. It will be a very fine show, for the ‘Black
Elephant’ himself is going to do you the honour to be present, as will
all the people of Beza Town and those for many miles round.”
</p><p>“Hold your tongue, you old idiot,” I said, “and stop your grinning. If
you had been a man and not a false friend you would have got us out of
this trouble, knowing as you do very well that we are no sellers of men,
but rather the enemy of those who do such things.”
</p><p>“Oh! white lord,” said Babemba, in a changed voice, “believe me I only
smile to make you happy up to the end. My lips smile, but I am crying
inside. I know that you are good and have told Bausi so, but he will
not believe me, who thinks that I have been bribed by you. What can I
do against that evil-hearted Imbozwi, the head of the witch-doctors, who
hates you because he thinks you have better magic than he has and who
whispers day and night into the king’s ear, telling him that if he does
not kill you, all our people will be slain or sold for slaves, as
you are only the scouts or a big army that is coming. Only last night
Imbozwi held a great divination <u>indaba</u>, and read this and a great
deal more in the enchanted water, making the king think he saw it in
pictures, whereas I, looking over his shoulder, could see nothing at
all, except the ugly face of Imbozwi reflected in the water. Also he
swore that his spirit told me that Dogeetah, the king’s blood-brother,
being dead, would never come to Beza Town again. I have done my best.
Keep your heart white towards me, O Macumazana, and do not haunt me,
for I tell you I have done my best, and if ever I should get a chance
against Imbozwi, which I am afraid I shan’t, as he will poison me first,
I will pay him back. Oh! he shall not die quickly as you will.”
</p><p>“I wish I could get a chance at him,” I muttered, for even in this
solemn moment I could cultivate no Christian spirit towards Imbozwi.
</p><p>Feeling that he was honest after all, I shook old Babemba’s hand and
gave him the letters I had written, asking him to try and get them to
the coast. Then we started on our last walk.
</p><p>The Zulu hunters were already outside the fence, seated on the ground,
chatting and taking snuff. I wondered if this was because they really
believed in Mavovo’s confounded Snake, or from bravado, inspired by the
innate courage of their race. When they saw me they sprang to their
feet and, lifting their right hands, gave me a loud and hearty salute
of “Inkoosi! Baba! Inkoosi! Macumazana!” Then, at a signal from Mavovo,
they broke into some Zulu war-chant, which they kept up till we reached
the stakes. Sammy, too, broke into a chant, but one of quite a different
nature.
</p><p>“Be quiet!” I said to him. “Can’t you die like a man?”
</p><p>“No, indeed I cannot, Mr. Quatermain,” he answered, and went on howling
for pity in about twenty different languages.
</p><p>Stephen and I walked together, he still carrying the Union Jack, of
which no one tried to deprive him. I think the Mazitu believed it was
his fetish. We didn’t talk much, though once he said:
</p><p>“Well, the love of orchids has brought many a man to a bad end. I wonder
whether the Governor will keep my collection or sell it.”
</p><p>After this he relapsed into silence, and not knowing and indeed not
caring what would happen to his collection, I made no answer.
</p><p>We had not far to go; personally I could have preferred a longer walk.
Passing with our guards down a kind of by-street, we emerged suddenly at
the head of the market-place, to find that it was packed with thousands
of people gathered there to see our execution. I noticed that they were
arranged in orderly companies and that a broad open roadway was left
between them, running to the southern gate of the market, I suppose to
facilitate the movements of so large a crowd.
</p><p>All this multitude received us in respectful silence, though Sammy’s
howls caused some of them to smile, while the Zulu war-chant appeared to
excite their wonder, or admiration. At the head of the market-place, not
far from the king’s enclosure, fifteen stout posts had been planted on
as many mounds. These mounds were provided so that everyone might see
the show and, in part at any rate, were made of soil hollowed from
fifteen deep graves dug almost at the foot of the mounds. Or rather
there were seventeen posts, an extra large one being set at each end of
the line in order to accommodate the two donkeys, which it appeared were
also to be shot to death. A great number of soldiers kept a space
clear in front of the posts. On this space were gathered Bausi, his
councillors, some of his head wives, Imbozwi more hideously painted than
usual, and perhaps fifty or sixty picked archers with strung bows and an
ample supply of arrows, whose part in the ceremony it was not difficult
for us to guess.
</p><p>“King Bausi,” I said as I was led past that potentate, “you are a
murderer and Heaven Above will be avenged upon you for this crime. If
our blood is shed, soon you shall die and come to meet us where <u>we</u>
have power, and your people shall be destroyed.”
</p><p>My words seemed to frighten the man, for he answered:
</p><p>“I am no murderer. I kill you because you are robbers of men. Moreover,
it is not I who have passed sentence on you. It is Imbozwi here, the
chief of the doctors, who has told me all about you, and whose spirit
says you must die unless my brother Dogeetah appears to save you. If
Dogeetah comes, which he cannot do because he is dead, and vouches for
you, then I shall know that Imbozwi is a wicked liar, and as you were to
die, so he shall die.”
</p><p>“Yes, yes,” screeched Imbozwi. “If Dogeetah comes, as that false wizard
prophesies,” and he pointed to Mavovo, “then I shall be ready to die in
your place, white slave-dealers. Yes, yes, then you may shoot <u>me</u> with
arrows.”
</p><p>“King, take note of those words, and people, take note of those words,
that they may be fulfilled if Dogeetah comes,” said Mavovo in a great,
deep voice.
</p><p>“I take note of them,” answered Bausi, “and I swear by my mother on
behalf of all the people, that they shall be fulfilled--if Dogeetah
comes.”
</p><p>“Good,” exclaimed Mavovo, and stalked on to the stake which had been
pointed out to him.
</p><p>As he went he whispered something into Imbozwi’s ear that seemed to
frighten that limb of Satan, for I saw him start and shiver. However, he
soon recovered, for in another minute he was engaged in superintending
those whose business it was to lash us to the posts.
</p><p>This was done simply and effectively by tying our wrists with a grass
rope behind these posts, each of which was fitted with two projecting
pieces of wood that passed under our arms and practically prevented
us from moving. Stephen and I were given the places of honour in the
middle, the Union Jack being fixed, by his own request, to the top of
Stephen’s stake. Mavovo was on my right, and the other Zulus were ranged
on either side of us. Hans and Sammy occupied the end posts respectively
(except those to which the poor jackasses were bound). I noted that Hans
was already very sleepy and that shortly after he was fixed up, his head
dropped forward on his breast. Evidently his medicine was working, and
almost I regretted that I had not taken some while I had the chance.
</p><p>When we were all fastened, Imbozwi came round to inspect. Moreover, with
a piece of white chalk he made a round mark on the breast of each of us;
a kind of bull’s eye for the archers to aim at.
</p><p>“Ah! white man,” he said to me as he chalked away at my shooting coat,
“you will never burn anyone’s hair again with your magic shield. Never,
never, for presently I shall be treading down the earth upon you in that
hole, and your goods will belong to me.”
</p><p>I did not answer, for what was the use of talking to this vile brute
when my time was so short. So he passed on to Stephen and began to chalk
him. Stephen, however, in whom the natural man still prevailed, shouted:
</p><p>“Take your filthy hands off me,” and lifting his leg, which was
unfettered, gave the painted witch-doctor such an awful kick in the
stomach, that he vanished backwards into the grave beneath him.
</p><p>“_Ow!_ Well done, Wazela!” said the Zulus, “we hope that you have killed
him.”
</p><p>“I hope so too,” said Stephen, and the multitude of spectators gasped to
see the sacred person of the head witch-doctor, of whom they evidently
went in much fear, treated in such a way. Only Babemba grinned, and even
the king Bausi did not seem displeased.
</p><p>But Imbozwi was not to be disposed of so easily, for presently, with the
help of sundry myrmidons, minor witch-doctors, he scrambled out of the
grave, cursing and covered with mud, for it was wet down there. After
that I took no more heed of him or of much else. Seeing that I had only
half an hour to live, as may be imagined, I was otherwise engaged.
