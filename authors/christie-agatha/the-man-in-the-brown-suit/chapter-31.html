<p>  _(From the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_
</p>
<p>  Johannesburg,
</p><p>  <u>March 7th.</u>
</p><p>Pagett has arrived. He is in a blue funk of course. Suggested at
once that we should go off to Pretoria. Then, when I had told him
kindly but firmly that we were going to remain here, he went to
the other extreme, wished he had his rifle here, and began bucking
about some bridge he guarded during the Great War. A railway bridge
at Little Puddecombe junction, or something of that sort.
</p><p>I soon cut that short by telling him to unpack the big typewriter.
I thought that that would keep him employed for some time, because
the typewriter was sure to have gone wrong—it always does—and he
would have to take it somewhere to be mended. But I had forgotten
Pagett’s powers of being in the right.
</p><p>“I’ve already unpacked all the cases, Sir Eustace. The typewriter
is in perfect condition.”
</p><p>“What do you mean—all the cases?”
</p><p>“The two small cases as well.”
</p><p>“I wish you wouldn’t be so officious, Pagett. Those small cases
were no business of yours. They belong to Mrs. Blair.”
</p><p>Pagett looked crestfallen. He hates to make a mistake.
</p><p>“So you can just pack them up again neatly,” I continued. “After
that you can go out and look around you. Jo’burg will probably be
a heap of smoking ruins by to-morrow, so it may be your last
chance.”
</p><p>I thought that that would get rid of him successfully for the
morning, at any rate.
</p><p>“There is something I want to say to you when you have the leisure,
Sir Eustace.”
</p><p>“I haven’t got it now,” I said hastily. “At this minute I have
absolutely no leisure whatsoever.”
</p><p>Pagett retired.
</p><p>“By the way,” I called after him, “what was there in those cases
of Mrs. Blair’s?”
</p><p>“Some fur rugs, and a couple of fur—hats, I think.”
</p><p>“That’s right,” I assented. “She bought them on the train. They
<u>are</u> hats—of a kind—though I hardly wonder at your not recognizing
them. I dare say she’s going to wear one of them at Ascot. What
else was there?”
</p><p>“Some rolls of films and some baskets—a lot of baskets——”
</p><p>“There would be,” I assured him. “Mrs. Blair is the kind of woman
who never buys less than a dozen or so of anything.”
</p><p>“I think that’s all, Sir Eustace, except some miscellaneous odds
and ends, a motor-veil and some odd gloves—that sort of thing.”
</p><p>“If you hadn’t been a born idiot, Pagett, you would have seen from
the start that those couldn’t possibly be my belongings.”
</p><p>“I thought some of them might belong to Miss Pettigrew.”
</p><p>“Ah, that reminds me—what do you mean by picking me out such a
doubtful character as a secretary?”
</p><p>And I told him about the searching cross-examination I had been
put through. Immediately I was sorry, I saw a glint in his eye that
I knew only too well. I changed the conversation hurriedly. But it
was too late. Pagett was on the war-path.
</p><p>He next proceeded to bore me with a long pointless story about the
<u>Kilmorden.</u> It was about a roll of films and a wager. The roll of
films being thrown through a porthole in the middle of the night
by some steward who ought to have known better. I hate horse-play.
I told Pagett so, and he began to tell me the story all over again.
He tells a story extremely badly, anyway. It was a long time before
I could make head or tail of this one.
</p><p>I did not see him again until lunch-time. Then he came in brimming
over with excitement, like a bloodhound on the scent. I never have
cared for bloodhounds. The upshot of it all was that he had seen
Rayburn.
</p><p>“What?” I cried, startled.
</p><p>Yes, he had caught sight of some one whom he was sure was Rayburn
crossing the street. Pagett had followed him.
</p><p>“And who do you think I saw him stop and speak to? Miss Pettigrew!”
</p><p>“What?”
</p><p>“Yes, Sir Eustace. And that’s not all. I’ve been making inquiries
about her——”
</p><p>“Wait a bit. What happened to Rayburn?”
</p><p>“He and Miss Pettigrew went into that corner curio-shop——”
</p><p>I uttered an involuntary exclamation. Pagett stopped inquiringly.
</p><p>“Nothing,” I said. “Go on.”
</p><p>“I waited outside for ages—but they didn’t come out. At last I went
in. Sir Eustace, there was no one in the shop! There must be
another way out.”
</p><p>I stared at him.
</p><p>“As I was saying, I came back to the hotel and made some inquiries
about Miss Pettigrew.” Pagett lowered his voice and breathed hard
as he always does when he wants to be confidential. “Sir Eustace,
a man was seen coming out of her room last night.”
</p><p>I raised my eyebrows.
</p><p>“And I always regarded her as a lady of such eminent respectability,”
I murmured.
</p><p>Pagett went on without heeding.
</p><p>“I went straight up and searched her room. What do you think I
found?”
</p><p>I shook my head.
</p><p>“This!”
</p><p>Pagett held up a safety razor and a stick of shaving soap.
</p><p>“What should a woman want with these?”
</p><p>I don’t suppose Pagett ever reads the advertisements in the
high-class ladies’ papers. I do. Whilst not proposing to argue with
him on the subject, I refused to accept the presence of the razor
as proof positive of Miss Pettigrew’s sex. Pagett is so hopelessly
behind the times. I should not have been at all surprised if he
had produced a cigarette-case to support his theory. However, even
Pagett has his limits.
</p><p>“You’re not convinced, Sir Eustace. What do you say to _this?”_
</p><p>I inspected the article which he dangled aloft triumphantly.
</p><p>“It looks like hair,” I remarked distastefully.
</p><p>“It is hair. I think it’s what they call a toupee.”
</p><p>“Indeed,” I commented.
</p><p>“Now are you convinced that that Pettigrew woman is a man in
disguise?”
</p><p>“Really, my dear Pagett, I think I am. I might have known it by
her feet.”
</p><p>“Then that’s that. And now, Sir Eustace, I want to speak to you
about my private affairs. I cannot doubt, from your hints and your
continual allusions to the time I was in Florence, that you have
found me out.”
</p><p>At last the mystery of what Pagett did in Florence is going to be
revealed!
</p><p>“Make a clean breast of it, my dear fellow,” I said kindly. “Much
the best way.”
</p><p>“Thank you, Sir Eustace.”
</p><p>“Is it her husband? Annoying fellows, husbands. Always turning up
when they’re least expected.”
</p><p>“I fail to follow you, Sir Eustace. Whose husband?”
</p><p>“The lady’s husband.”
</p><p>“What lady?”
</p><p>“God bless my soul, Pagett, the lady you met in Florence. There
must have been a lady. Don’t tell me that you merely robbed a
church or stabbed an Italian in the back because you didn’t like
his face.”
</p><p>“I am quite at a loss to understand you, Sir Eustace. I suppose
you are joking.”
</p><p>“I am an amusing fellow sometimes, when I take the trouble, but I
can assure you that I am not trying to be funny this minute.”
</p><p>“I hoped that as I was a good way off you had not recognized me,
Sir Eustace.”
</p><p>“Recognized you where?”
</p><p>“At Marlow, Sir Eustace?”
</p><p>“At Marlow? What the devil were you doing at Marlow?”
</p><p>“I thought you understood that——”
</p><p>“I’m beginning to understand less and less. Go back to the beginning
of the story and start again. You went to Florence——”
</p><p>“Then you don’t know after all—and you didn’t recognize me!”
</p><p>“As far as I can judge, you seem to have given yourself away
needlessly—made a coward of by your conscience. But I shall be able
to tell better when I’ve heard the whole story. Now, then, take a
deep breath and start again. You went to Florence——”
</p><p>“But I didn’t go to Florence. That is just it.”
</p><p>“Well, where did you go, then?”
</p><p>“I went home—to Marlow.”
</p><p>“What the devil did you want to go to Marlow for?”
</p><p>“I wanted to see my wife. She was in delicate health and expecting——”
</p><p>“Your wife? But I didn’t know you were married?”
</p><p>“No, Sir Eustace, that is just what I am telling you. I deceived
you in this matter.”
</p><p>“How long have you been married?”
</p><p>“Just over eight years. I had been married just six months when I
became your secretary. I did not want to lose the post. A resident
secretary is not supposed to have a wife, so I suppressed the
fact.”
</p><p>“You take my breath away,” I remarked. “Where has she been all
these years?”
</p><p>“We have had a small bungalow on the river at Marlow, quite close
to the Mill House, for over five years.”
</p><p>“God bless my soul,” I muttered. “Any children?”
</p><p>“Four children, Sir Eustace.”
</p><p>I gazed at him in a kind of stupor. I might have known, all along,
that a man like Pagett couldn’t have a guilty secret. The
respectability of Pagett has always been my bane. That’s just the
kind of secret he would have—a wife and four children.
</p><p>“Have you told this to any one else?” I demanded at last, when I
had gazed at him in fascinated interest for quite a long while.
</p><p>“Only Miss Beddingfeld. She came to the station at Kimberley.”
</p><p>I continued to stare at him. He fidgeted under my glance.
</p><p>“I hope, Sir Eustace, that you are not seriously annoyed?”
</p><p>“My dear fellow,” I said, “I don’t mind telling you here and now
that you’ve blinking well torn it!”
</p><p>I went out seriously ruffled. As I passed the corner curio-shop,
I was assailed by a sudden irresistible temptation and went in.
The proprietor came forward obsequiously, rubbing his hands.
</p><p>“Can I show you something? Furs, curios?”
</p><p>“I want something quite out of the ordinary,” I said. “It’s for a
special occasion. Will you show me what you’ve got?”
</p><p>“Perhaps you will come into my back room? We have many specialties
there?”
</p><p>That is where I made a mistake. And I thought I was going to be so
clever. I followed him through the swinging <u>portières.</u>
