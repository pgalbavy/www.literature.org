A YOUNG PIG was shut up in a fold-yard with a Goat and a Sheep. 
On one occasion when the shepherd laid hold of him, he grunted
and squeaked and resisted violently.  The Sheep and the Goat
complained of his distressing cries, saying, "He often handles
us, and we do not cry out."  To this the Pig replied, "Your
handling and mine are very different things.  He catches you only
for your wool, or your milk, but he lays hold on me for my very
life."
