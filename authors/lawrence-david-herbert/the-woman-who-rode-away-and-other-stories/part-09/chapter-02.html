<p>The islander had to move.  But he was not going to the mainland.
Oh, no!  He moved to the smaller island, which still belonged to
him.  And he took with him the faithful old carpenter and wife, the
couple he never really cared for; also a widow and daughter, who
had kept house for him the last year; also an orphan lad, to help
the old man.</p>

<p>The small island was very small; but, being a hump of rock in the
sea, it was bigger than it looked.  There was a little track among
rocks and bushes, winding and scrambling up and down around the
islet, so that it took you twenty minutes to do the circuit.  It
was more than you would have expected.</p>

<p>Still, it was an island.  The islander moved himself, with all his
books, into the commonplace six-roomed house up to which you had to
scramble from the rocky landing-place.  There were also two joined-
together cottages.  The old carpenter lived in one, with his wife
and the lad, the widow and daughter lived in the other.</p>

<p>At last all was in order.  The Master's books filled two rooms.  It
was already autumn, Orion lifting out of the sea.  And in the dark
nights, the Master could see the lights on his late island, where
the hotel company were entertaining guests who would advertise the
new resort for honeymoon-golfers.</p>

<p>On his hump of rock, however, the Master was still master.  He
explored the crannies, the odd handbreadths of grassy level, the
steep little cliffs where the last harebells hung, and the seeds of
summer were brown above the sea, lonely and untouched.  He peered
down the old well.  He examined the stone pen where the pig had
been kept.  Himself, he had a goat.</p>

<p>Yes, it was an island.  Always, always, underneath among the rocks
the celtic sea sucked and washed and smote its feathery greyness.
How many different noises of the sea! deep explosions, rumblings,
strange long sighs and whistling noises; then voices, real voices
of people clamouring as if they were in a market, under the waters;
and again, the far-off ringing of a bell, surely an actual bell!
then a tremulous trilling noise, very long and alarming, and an
undertone of hoarse gasping.</p>

<p>On this island there were no human ghosts, no ghosts of any ancient
race.  The sea, and the spume and the wind and the weather, had
washed them all out, washed them out, so there was only the sound
of the sea itself, its own ghost, myriad-voiced, communing and
plotting and shouting all winter long.  And only the smell of the
sea, with a few bristly bushes of gorse and coarse tufts of
heather, among the grey, pellucid rocks, in the grey, more pellucid
air.  The coldness, the greyness, even the soft, creeping fog of
the sea! and the islet of rock humped up in it all, like the last
point in space.</p>

<p>Green star Sirius stood over the sea's rim.  The island was a
shadow.  Out at sea a ship showed small lights.  Below, in the
rocky cove, the row-boat and the motor-boat were safe.  A light
shone in the carpenter's kitchen.  That was all.</p>

<p>Save, of course, that the lamp was lit in the house, where the
widow was preparing supper, her daughter helping.  The islander
went in to his meal.  Here he was no longer the Master, he was an
islander again and he had peace.  The old carpenter, the widow and
daughter were all faithfulness itself.  The old man worked while
ever there was light to see, because he had a passion for work.
The widow and her quiet, rather delicate daughter of thirty-three
worked for the Master, because they loved looking after him, and
they were infinitely grateful for the haven he provided them.  But
they didn't call him &quot;the Master&quot;.  They gave him his name:  &quot;Mr
Cathcart, Sir!&quot; softly, and reverently.  And he spoke back to them
also softly, gently, like people far from the world, afraid to make
a noise.</p>

<p>The island was no longer a &quot;world&quot;.  It was a sort of refuge.  The
islander no longer struggled for anything.  He had no need.  It was
as if he and his few dependents were a small flock of sea-birds
alighted on this rock, as they travelled through space, and keeping
together without a word.  The silent mystery of travelling birds.</p>

<p>He spent most of his day in his study.  His book was coming along.
The widow's daughter could type out his manuscript for him, she was
not uneducated.  It was the one strange sound on the island, the
typewriter.  But soon even its spattering fitted in with the sea's
noises, and the wind's.</p>

<p>The months went by.  The islander worked away in his study, the
people of the island went quietly about their concerns.  The goat
had a little black kid with yellow eyes.  There were mackerel in
the sea.  The old man went fishing in the row-boat, with the lad.
When the weather was calm enough, they went off in the motor-boat
to the biggest island, for the post.  And they brought supplies,
never a penny wasted.  And the days went by, and the nights,
without desire, without ennui.</p>

<p>The strange stillness from all desire was a kind of wonder to the
islander.  He didn't want anything.  His soul at last was still in
him, his spirit was like a dim-lit cave under water, where strange
sea-foliage expands upon the watery atmosphere, and scarcely sways,
and a mute fish shadowily slips in and slips away again.  All still
and soft and uncrying, yet alive as rooted sea-weed is alive.</p>

<p>The islander said to himself:  &quot;Is this happiness?&quot;  He said to
himself:  &quot;I am turned into a dream.  I feel nothing, or I don't
know what I feel.  Yet it seems to me I am happy.&quot;</p>

<p>Only he had to have something upon which his mental activity could
work.  So he spent long, silent hours in his study, working not
very fast, nor very importantly, letting the writing spin softly
from him as if it were drowsy gossamer.  He no longer fretted
whether it were good or not, what he produced.  He slowly, softly
spun it like gossamer, and, if it were to melt away as gossamer in
autumn melts, he would not mind.  It was only the soft evanescence
of gossamery things which now seemed to him permanent.  The very
mist of eternity was in them.  Whereas stone buildings, cathedrals
for example, seemed to him to howl with temporary resistance,
knowing they must fall at last; the tension of their long endurance
seemed to howl forth from them all the time.</p>

<p>Sometimes he went to the mainland and to the city.  Then he went
elegantly, dressed in the latest style, to his club.  He sat in a
stall at the theatre, he shopped in Bond Street.  He discussed
terms for publishing his book.  But over his face was that
gossamery look of having dropped out of the race of progress, which
made the vulgar city people feel they had won it over him, and made
him glad to go back to his island.</p>

<p>He didn't mind if he never published his book.  The years were
blending into a soft mist, from which nothing obtruded.  Spring
came.  There was never a primrose on his island, but he found a
winter-aconite.  There were two little sprayed bushes of
blackthorn, and some wind-flowers.  He began to make a list of the
flowers on his islet, and that was absorbing.  He noted a wild
currant bush, and watched for the elder flowers on a stunted little
tree, then for the first yellow rags of the broom, and wild roses.
Bladder campion, orchids, stitchwort, celandine, he was prouder of
them than if they had been people on his island.  When he came
across the golden saxifrage, so inconspicuous in a damp corner, he
crouched over it in a trance, he knew not for how long, looking at
it.  Yet it was nothing to look at.  As the widow's daughter found,
when he showed it her.</p>

<p>He had said to her, in real triumph:</p>

<p>&quot;I found the golden saxifrage this morning.&quot;</p>

<p>The name sounded splendid.  She looked at him with fascinated brown
eyes, in which was a hollow ache that frightened him a little.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you, Sir?  Is it a nice flower?&quot;</p>

<p>He pursed his lips and tilted his brows.</p>

<p>&quot;Well - not showy exactly.  I'll show it you if you like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should like to see it.&quot;</p>

<p>She was so quiet, so wistful.  But he sensed in her a persistency
which made him uneasy.  She said she was so happy: really happy.
She followed him quietly, like a shadow, on the rocky track where
there was never room for two people to walk side by side.  He went
first, and could feel her there, immediately behind him, following
so submissively, gloating on him from behind.</p>

<p>It was a kind of pity for her which made him become her lover:
though he never realized the extent of the power she had gained
over him, and how SHE willed it.  But the moment he had fallen, a
jangling feeling came upon him, that it was all wrong.  He felt a
nervous dislike of her.  He had not wanted it.  And it seemed to
him, as far as her physical self went, she had not wanted it
either.  It was just her will.  He went away, and climbed at the
risk of his neck down to a ledge near the sea.  There he sat for
hours, gazing all jangled at the sea, and saying miserably to
himself:  &quot;We didn't want it.  We didn't really want it.&quot;</p>

<p>It was the automatism of sex that had caught him again.  Not that
he hated sex.  He deemed it, as the Chinese do, one of the great
life-mysteries.  But it had become mechanical, automatic, and he
wanted to escape that.  Automatic sex shattered him, and filled him
with a sort of death.  He thought he had come through, to a new
stillness of desirelessness.  Perhaps beyond that, there was a new
fresh delicacy of desire, an unentered frail communion of two
people meeting on untrodden ground.</p>

<p>But be that as it might, this was not it.  This was nothing new or
fresh.  It was automatic, and driven from the will.  Even she, in
her true self, hadn't wanted it.  It was automatic in her.</p>

<p>When he came home, very late, and saw her face white with fear and
apprehension of his feeling against her, he pitied her, and spoke
to her delicately, reassuringly.  But he kept himself remote from
her.</p>

<p>She gave no sign.  She served him with the same silence, the same
hidden hunger to serve him, to be near where he was.  He felt her
love following him with strange, awful persistency.  She claimed
nothing.  Yet now, when he met her bright, brown, curiously vacant
eyes, he saw in them the mute question.  The question came direct
at him, with a force and a power of will he never realized.</p>

<p>So he succumbed, and asked her again.</p>

<p>&quot;Not,&quot; she said, &quot;if it will make you hate me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why should it?&quot; he replied, nettled.  &quot;Of course not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know I would do anything on earth for you.&quot;</p>

<p>It was only afterwards, in his exasperation, he remembered what she
had said, and was more exasperated.  Why should she pretend to do
this FOR HIM?  Why not for herself?  But in his exasperation, he
drove himself deeper in.  In order to achieve some sort of
satisfaction, which he never did achieve, he abandoned himself to
her.  Everybody on the island knew.  But he did not care.</p>

<p>Then even what desire he had left him, and he felt only shattered.
He felt that only with her will had she wanted him.  Now he was
shattered and full of self-contempt.  His island was smirched and
spoiled.  He had lost his place in the rare, desireless levels of
Time to which he had at last arrived, and he had fallen right back.
If only it had been true, delicate desire between them, and a
delicate meeting on the third rare place where a man might meet a
woman, when they were both true to the frail, sensitive, crocus
flame of desire in them.  But it had been no such thing: automatic,
an act of will, not of true desire, it left him feeling humiliated.</p>

<p>He went away from the islet, in spite of her mute reproach.  And he
wandered about the continent, vainly seeking a place where he could
stay.  He was out of key; he did not fit in the world any more.</p>

<p>There came a letter from Flora - her name was Flora - to say she was
afraid she was going to have a child.  He sat down as if he were
shot, and he remained sitting.  But he replied to her:  &quot;Why be
afraid?  If it is so, it is so, and we should rather be pleased
than afraid.&quot;</p>

<p>At this very moment, it happened there was an auction of islands.
He got the maps, and studied them.  And at the auction he bought,
for very little money, another island.  It was just a few acres of
rock away in the north, on the outer fringe of the isles.  It was
low, it rose out of the great ocean.  There was not a building, not
even a tree on it.  Only northern sea-turf, a pool of rain-water, a
bit of sedge, rock, and sea-birds.  Nothing else.  Under the
weeping wet western sky.</p>

<p>He made a trip to visit his new possession.  For several days,
owing to the seas, he could not approach it.  Then, in a light sea-
mist, he landed, and saw it hazy, low, stretching apparently a long
way.  But it was illusion.  He walked over the wet, springy turf,
and dark-grey sheep tossed away from him, spectral, bleating
hoarsely.  And he came to the dark pool, with the sedge.  Then on
in the dampness, to the grey sea sucking angrily among the rocks.</p>

<p>This was indeed an island.</p>

<p>So he went home to Flora.  She looked at him with guilty fear, but
also with a triumphant brightness in her uncanny eyes.  And again
he was gentle, he reassured her, even he wanted her again, with
that curious desire that was almost like toothache.  So he took her
to the mainland, and they were married, since she was going to have
his child.</p>

<p>They returned to the island.  She still brought in his meals, her
own along with them.  She sat and ate with him.  He would have it
so.  The widowed mother preferred to stay in the kitchen.  And
Flora slept in the guest-room of his house, mistress of his house.</p>

<p>His desire, whatever it was, died in him with nauseous finality.
The child would still be months coming.  His island was hateful to
him, vulgar, a suburb.  He himself had lost all his finer
distinction.  The weeks passed in a sort of prison, in humiliation.
Yet he stuck it out, till the child was born.  But he was
meditating escape.  Flora did not even know.</p>

<p>A nurse appeared, and ate at table with them.  The doctor came
sometimes, and, if the sea were rough, he too had to stay.  He was
cheery over his whisky.</p>

<p>They might have been a young couple in Golders Green.</p>

<p>The daughter was born at last.  The father looked at the baby, and
felt depressed, almost more than he could bear.  The millstone was
tied round his neck.  But he tried not to show what he felt.  And
Flora did not know.  She still smiled with a kind of half-witted
triumph in her joy, as she got well again.  Then she began again to
look at him with those aching, suggestive, somehow impudent eyes.
She adored him so.</p>

<p>This he could not stand.  He told her that he had to go away for a
time.  She wept, but she thought she had got him.  He told her he
had settled the best part of his property on her, and wrote down
for her what income it would produce.  She hardly listened, only
looked at him with those heavy, adoring, impudent eyes.  He gave
her a cheque-book, with the amount of her credit duly entered.
This did arouse her interest.  And he told her, if she got tired of
the island, she could choose her home wherever she wished.</p>

<p>She followed him with those aching, persistent brown eyes, when he
left, and he never even saw her weep.</p>

<p>He went straight north, to prepare his third island.</p>
