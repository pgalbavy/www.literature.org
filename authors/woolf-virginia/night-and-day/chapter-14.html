<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Mr. Clacton was in his glory. The machinery which he had perfected
and controlled was now about to turn out its bi-monthly product,
a committee meeting; and his pride in the perfect structure of
these assemblies was great. He loved the jargon of committee-rooms;
he loved the way in which the door kept opening as the clock struck
the hour, in obedience to a few strokes of his pen on a piece
of paper; and when it had opened sufficiently often, he loved
to issue from his inner chamber with documents in his hands, visibly
important, with a preoccupied expression on his face that might
have suited a Prime Minister advancing to meet his Cabinet. By
his orders the table had been decorated beforehand with six sheets
of blotting-paper, with six pens, six ink-pots, a tumbler and
a jug of water, a bell, and, in deference to the taste of the
lady members, a vase of hardy chrysanthemums. He had already surreptitiously
straightened the sheets of blotting-paper in relation to the ink-pots,
and now stood in front of the fire engaged in conversation with
Miss Markham. But his eye was on the door, and when Mary and Mrs.
Seal entered, he gave a little laugh and observed to the assembly
which was scattered about the room:</p>

<p>"I fancy, ladies and gentlemen, that we are ready to commence."</p>

<p>So speaking, he took his seat at the head of the table, and arranging
one bundle of papers upon his right and another upon his left,
called upon Miss Datchet to read the minutes of the previous meeting.
Mary obeyed. A keen observer might have wondered why it was necessary
for the secretary to knit her brows so closely over the tolerably
matter-of-fact statement before her. Could there be any doubt
in her mind that it had been resolved to circularize the provinces
with Leaflet No. 3, or to issue a statistical diagram showing
the proportion of married women to spinsters in New Zealand; or
that the net profits of Mrs. Hipsley’s Bazaar had reached a total
of five pounds eight shillings and twopence half-penny?</p>

<p>Could any doubt as to the perfect sense and propriety of these
statements be disturbing her? No one could have guessed, from
the look of her, that she was disturbed at all. A pleasanter and
saner woman than Mary Datchet was never seen within a committee-room.
She seemed a compound of the autumn leaves and the winter sunshine;
less poetically speaking, she showed both gentleness and strength,
an indefinable promise of soft maternity blending with her evident
fitness for honest labor. Nevertheless, she had great difficulty
in reducing her mind to obedience; and her reading lacked conviction,
as if, as was indeed the case, she had lost the power of visualizing
what she read. And directly the list was completed, her mind floated
to Lincoln’s Inn Fields and the fluttering wings of innumerable
sparrows. Was Ralph still enticing the bald-headed cock-sparrow
to sit upon his hand? Had he succeeded? Would he ever succeed?
She had meant to ask him why it is that the sparrows in Lincoln’s
Inn Fields are tamer than the sparrows in Hyde Park&mdash;perhaps it
is that the passers-by are rarer, and they come to recognize their
benefactors. For the first half-hour of the committee meeting,
Mary had thus to do battle with the skeptical presence of Ralph
Denham, who threatened to have it all his own way. Mary tried
half a dozen methods of ousting him. She raised her voice, she
articulated distinctly, she looked firmly at Mr. Clacton’s bald
head, she began to write a note. To her annoyance, her pencil
drew a little round figure on the blotting-paper, which, she could
not deny, was really a bald-headed cock-sparrow. She looked again
at Mr. Clacton; yes, he was bald, and so are cock-sparrows. Never
was a secretary tormented by so many unsuitable suggestions, and
they all came, alas! with something ludicrously grotesque about
them, which might, at any moment, provoke her to such flippancy
as would shock her colleagues for ever. The thought of what she
might say made her bite her lips, as if her lips would protect
her.</p>

<p>But all these suggestions were but flotsam and jetsam cast to
the surface by a more profound disturbance, which, as she could
not consider it at present, manifested its existence by these
grotesque nods and beckonings. Consider it, she must, when the
committee was over. Meanwhile, she was behaving scandalously;
she was looking out of the window, and thinking of the color of
the sky, and of the decorations on the Imperial Hotel, when she
ought to have been shepherding her colleagues, and pinning them
down to the matter in hand. She could not bring herself to attach
more weight to one project than to another. Ralph had said&mdash;she
could not stop to consider what he had said, but he had somehow
divested the proceedings of all reality. And then, without conscious
effort, by some trick of the brain, she found herself becoming
interested in some scheme for organizing a newspaper campaign.
Certain articles were to be written; certain editors approached.
What line was it advisable to take? She found herself strongly
disapproving of what Mr. Clacton was saying. She committed herself
to the opinion that now was the time to strike hard. Directly
she had said this, she felt that she had turned upon Ralph’s ghost;
and she became more and more in earnest, and anxious to bring
the others round to her point of view. Once more, she knew exactly
and indisputably what is right and what is wrong. As if emerging
from a mist, the old foes of the public good loomed ahead of her&mdash;capitalists,
newspaper proprietors, anti-suffragists, and, in some ways most
pernicious of all, the masses who take no interest one way or
another&mdash;among whom, for the time being, she certainly discerned
the features of Ralph Denham. Indeed, when Miss Markham asked
her to suggest the names of a few friends of hers, she expressed
herself with unusual bitterness:</p>

<p>"My friends think all this kind of thing useless." She felt that
she was really saying that to Ralph himself.</p>

<p>"Oh, they’re that sort, are they?" said Miss Markham, with a
little laugh; and with renewed vigor their legions charged the
foe.</p>

<p>Mary’s spirits had been low when she entered the committee-room;
but now they were considerably improved. She knew the ways of
this world; it was a shapely, orderly place; she felt convinced
of its right and its wrong; and the feeling that she was fit to
deal a heavy blow against her enemies warmed her heart and kindled
her eye. In one of those flights of fancy, not characteristic
of her but tiresomely frequent this afternoon, she envisaged herself
battered with rotten eggs upon a platform, from which Ralph vainly
begged her to descend. But&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do I matter compared with the cause?" she said, and so
on. Much to her credit, however teased by foolish fancies, she
kept the surface of her brain moderate and vigilant, and subdued
Mrs. Seal very tactfully more than once when she demanded, "Action!&mdash;everywhere!&mdash;at
once!" as became her father’s daughter.</p>

<p>The other members of the committee, who were all rather elderly
people, were a good deal impressed by Mary, and inclined to side
with her and against each other, partly, perhaps, because of her
youth. The feeling that she controlled them all filled Mary with
a sense of power; and she felt that no work can equal in importance,
or be so exciting as, the work of making other people do what
you want them to do. Indeed, when she had won her point she felt
a slight degree of contempt for the people who had yielded to
her.</p>

<p>The committee now rose, gathered together their papers, shook
them straight, placed them in their attache-cases, snapped the
locks firmly together, and hurried away, having, for the most
part, to catch trains, in order to keep other appointments with
other committees, for they were all busy people. Mary, Mrs. Seal,
and Mr. Clacton were left alone; the room was hot and untidy,
the pieces of pink blotting-paper were lying at different angles
upon the table, and the tumbler was half full of water, which
some one had poured out and forgotten to drink.</p>

<p>Mrs. Seal began preparing the tea, while Mr. Clacton retired
to his room to file the fresh accumulation of documents. Mary
was too much excited even to help Mrs. Seal with the cups and
saucers. She flung up the window and stood by it, looking out.
The street lamps were already lit; and through the mist in the
square one could see little figures hurrying across the road and
along the pavement, on the farther side. In her absurd mood of
lustful arrogance, Mary looked at the little figures and thought,
"If I liked I could make you go in there or stop short; I could
make you walk in single file or in double file; I could do what
I liked with you." Then Mrs. Seal came and stood by her.</p>

<p>"Oughtn’t you to put something round your shoulders, Sally?"
Mary asked, in rather a condescending tone of voice, feeling a
sort of pity for the enthusiastic ineffective little woman. But
Mrs. Seal paid no attention to the suggestion.</p>

<p>"Well, did you enjoy yourself?" Mary asked, with a little laugh.</p>

<p>Mrs. Seal drew a deep breath, restrained herself, and then burst
out, looking out, too, upon Russell Square and Southampton Row,
and at the passers-by, "Ah, if only one could get every one of
those people into this room, and make them understand for five
minutes! But they <em>MUST </em>see the truth some day.... If
only one could <em>MAKE </em>them see it...."</p>

<p>Mary knew herself to be very much wiser than Mrs. Seal, and when
Mrs. Seal said anything, even if it was what Mary herself was
feeling, she automatically thought of all that there was to be
said against it. On this occasion her arrogant feeling that she
could direct everybody dwindled away.</p>

<p>"Let’s have our tea," she said, turning back from the window
and pulling down the blind. "It was a good meeting&mdash;didn’t you
think so, Sally?" she let fall, casually, as she sat down at the
table. Surely Mrs. Seal must realize that Mary had been extraordinarily
efficient?</p>

<p>"But we go at such a snail’s pace," said Sally, shaking her head
impatiently.</p>

<p>At this Mary burst out laughing, and all her arrogance was dissipated.</p>

<p>"You can afford to laugh," said Sally, with another shake of
her head, "but I can’t. I’m fifty-five, and I dare say I shall
be in my grave by the time we get it&mdash;if we ever do."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you won’t be in your grave," said Mary, kindly.</p>

<p>"It’ll be such a great day," said Mrs. Seal, with a toss of her
locks. "A great day, not only for us, but for civilization. That’s
what I feel, you know, about these meetings. Each one of them
is a step onwards in the great march&mdash;humanity, you know. We do
want the people after us to have a better time of it&mdash;and so many
don’t see it. I wonder how it is that they don’t see it?"</p>

<p>She was carrying plates and cups from the cupboard as she spoke,
so that her sentences were more than usually broken apart. Mary
could not help looking at the odd little priestess of humanity
with something like admiration. While she had been thinking about
herself, Mrs. Seal had thought of nothing but her vision.</p>

<p>"You mustn’t wear yourself out, Sally, if you want to see the
great day," she said, rising and trying to take a plate of biscuits
from Mrs. Seal’s hands.</p>

<p>"My dear child, what else is my old body good for?" she exclaimed,
clinging more tightly than before to her plate of biscuits. "Shouldn’t
I be proud to give everything I have to the cause?&mdash;for I’m not
an intelligence like you. There were domestic circumstances &mdash;I’d
like to tell you one of these days&mdash;so I say foolish things. I
lose my head, you know. You don’t. Mr. Clacton doesn’t. It’s a
great mistake, to lose one’s head. But my heart’s in the right
place. And I’m so glad Kit has a big dog, for I didn’t think her
looking well."</p>

<p>They had their tea, and went over many of the points that had
been raised in the committee rather more intimately than had been
possible then; and they all felt an agreeable sense of being in
some way behind the scenes; of having their hands upon strings
which, when pulled, would completely change the pageant exhibited
daily to those who read the newspapers. Although their views were
very different, this sense united them and made them almost cordial
in their manners to each other.</p>

<p>Mary, however, left the tea-party rather early, desiring both
to be alone, and then to hear some music at the Queen’s Hall.
She fully intended to use her loneliness to think out her position
with regard to Ralph; but although she walked back to the Strand
with this end in view, she found her mind uncomfortably full of
different trains of thought. She started one and then another.
They seemed even to take their color from the street she happened
to be in. Thus the vision of humanity appeared to be in some way
connected with Bloomsbury, and faded distinctly by the time she
crossed the main road; then a belated organ-grinder in Holborn
set her thoughts dancing incongruously; and by the time she was
crossing the great misty square of Lincoln’s Inn Fields, she was
cold and depressed again, and horribly clear-sighted. The dark
removed the stimulus of human companionship, and a tear actually
slid down her cheek, accompanying a sudden conviction within her
that she loved Ralph, and that he didn’t love her. All dark and
empty now was the path where they had walked that morning, and
the sparrows silent in the bare trees. But the lights in her own
building soon cheered her; all these different states of mind
were submerged in the deep flood of desires, thoughts, perceptions,
antagonisms, which washed perpetually at the base of her being,
to rise into prominence in turn when the conditions of the upper
world were favorable. She put off the hour of clear thought until
Christmas, saying to herself, as she lit her fire, that it is
impossible to think anything out in London; and, no doubt, Ralph
wouldn’t come at Christmas, and she would take long walks into
the heart of the country, and decide this question and all the
others that puzzled her. Meanwhile, she thought, drawing her feet
up on to the fender, life was full of complexity; life was a thing
one must love to the last fiber of it.</p>

<p>She had sat there for five minutes or so, and her thoughts had
had time to grow dim, when there came a ring at her bell. Her
eye brightened; she felt immediately convinced that Ralph had
come to visit her. Accordingly, she waited a moment before opening
the door; she wanted to feel her hands secure upon the reins of
all the troublesome emotions which the sight of Ralph would certainly
arouse. She composed herself unnecessarily, however, for she had
to admit, not Ralph, but Katharine and William Rodney. Her first
impression was that they were both extremely well dressed. She
felt herself shabby and slovenly beside them, and did not know
how she should entertain them, nor could she guess why they had
come. She had heard nothing of their engagement. But after the
first disappointment, she was pleased, for she felt instantly
that Katharine was a personality, and, moreover, she need not
now exercise her self-control.</p>

<p>"We were passing and saw a light in your window, so we came up," 
Katharine explained, standing and looking very tall and distinguished
and rather absent-minded.</p>

<p>"We have been to see some pictures," said William. "Oh, dear,"
he exclaimed, looking about him, "this room reminds me of one
of the worst hours in my existence&mdash;when I read a paper, and you
all sat round and jeered at me. Katharine was the worst. I could
feel her gloating over every mistake I made. Miss Datchet was
kind. Miss Datchet just made it possible for me to get through,
I remember."</p>

<p>Sitting down, he drew off his light yellow gloves, and began
slapping his knees with them. His vitality was pleasant, Mary
thought, although he made her laugh. The very look of him was
inclined to make her laugh. His rather prominent eyes passed from
one young woman to the other, and his lips perpetually formed
words which remained unspoken.</p>

<p>"We have been seeing old masters at the Grafton Gallery," said
Katharine, apparently paying no attention to William, and accepting
a cigarette which Mary offered her. She leant back in her chair,
and the smoke which hung about her face seemed to withdraw her
still further from the others.</p>

<p>"Would you believe it, Miss Datchet," William continued, "Katharine
doesn’t like Titian. She doesn’t like apricots, she doesn’t like
peaches, she doesn’t like green peas. She likes the Elgin marbles,
and gray days without any sun. She’s a typical example of the
cold northern nature. I come from Devonshire&mdash;"</p>

<p>Had they been quarreling, Mary wondered, and had they, for that
reason, sought refuge in her room, or were they engaged, or had
Katharine just refused him? She was completely baffled.</p>

<p>Katharine now reappeared from her veil of smoke, knocked the
ash from her cigarette into the fireplace, and looked, with an
odd expression of solicitude, at the irritable man.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Mary," she said tentatively, "you wouldn’t mind giving
us some tea? We did try to get some, but the shop was so crowded,
and in the next one there was a band playing; and most of the
pictures, at any rate, were very dull, whatever you may say, William."
She spoke with a kind of guarded gentleness.</p>

<p>Mary, accordingly, retired to make preparations in the pantry.</p>

<p>"What in the world are they after?" she asked of her own reflection
in the little looking-glass which hung there. She was not left
to doubt much longer, for, on coming back into the sitting-room
with the tea-things, Katharine informed her, apparently having
been instructed so to do by William, of their engagement.</p>

<p>"William," she said, "thinks that perhaps you don’t know. We
are going to be married."</p>

<p>Mary found herself shaking William’s hand, and addressing her
congratulations to him, as if Katharine were inaccessible; she
had, indeed, taken hold of the tea-kettle.</p>

<p>"Let me see," Katharine said, "one puts hot water into the cups
first, doesn’t one? You have some dodge of your own, haven’t you,
William, about making tea?"</p>

<p>Mary was half inclined to suspect that this was said in order
to conceal nervousness, but if so, the concealment was unusually
perfect. Talk of marriage was dismissed. Katharine might have
been seated in her own drawing-room, controlling a situation which
presented no sort of difficulty to her trained mind. Rather to
her surprise, Mary found herself making conversation with William
about old Italian pictures, while Katharine poured out tea, cut
cake, kept William’s plate supplied, without joining more than
was necessary in the conversation. She seemed to have taken possession
of Mary’s room, and to handle the cups as if they belonged to
her. But it was done so naturally that it bred no resentment in
Mary; on the contrary, she found herself putting her hand on Katharine’s
knee, affectionately, for an instant. Was there something maternal
in this assumption of control? And thinking of Katharine as one
who would soon be married, these maternal airs filled Mary’s mind
with a new tenderness, and even with awe. Katharine seemed very
much older and more experienced than she was.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rodney talked. If his appearance was superficially
against him, it had the advantage of making his solid merits something
of a surprise. He had kept notebooks; he knew a great deal about
pictures. He could compare different examples in different galleries,
and his authoritative answers to intelligent questions gained
not a little, Mary felt, from the smart taps which he dealt, as
he delivered them, upon the lumps of coal. She was impressed.</p>

<p>"Your tea, William," said Katharine gently.</p>

<p>He paused, gulped it down, obediently, and continued.</p>

<p>And then it struck Mary that Katharine, in the shade of her broad-brimmed
hat, and in the midst of the smoke, and in the obscurity of her
character, was, perhaps, smiling to herself, not altogether in
the maternal spirit. What she said was very simple, but her words,
even "Your tea, William," were set down as gently and cautiously
and exactly as the feet of a Persian cat stepping among China
ornaments. For the second time that day Mary felt herself baffled
by something inscrutable in the character of a person to whom
she felt herself much attracted. She thought that if she were
engaged to Katharine, she, too, would find herself very soon using
those fretful questions with which William evidently teased his
bride. And yet Katharine’s voice was humble.</p>

<p>"I wonder how you find the time to know all about pictures as
well as books?" she asked.</p>

<p>"How do I find the time?" William answered, delighted, Mary guessed,
at this little compliment. "Why, I always travel with a notebook.
And I ask my way to the picture gallery the very first thing in
the morning. And then I meet men, and talk to them. There’s a
man in my office who knows all about the Flemish school. I was
telling Miss Datchet about the Flemish school. I picked up a lot
of it from him&mdash;it’s a way men have &mdash;Gibbons, his name is.
You must meet him. We’ll ask him to lunch. And this not caring
about art," he explained, turning to Mary, "it’s one of Katharine’s
poses, Miss Datchet. Did you know she posed? She pretends that
she’s never read Shakespeare. And why should she read Shakespeare,
since she IS Shakespeare &mdash;Rosalind, you know," and he gave
his queer little chuckle. Somehow this compliment appeared very
old-fashioned and almost in bad taste. Mary actually felt herself
blush, as if he had said "the sex" or "the ladies." Constrained,
perhaps, by nervousness, Rodney continued in the same vein.</p>

<p>"She knows enough&mdash;enough for all decent purposes. What do you
women want with learning, when you have so much else&mdash;everything,
I should say&mdash;everything. Leave us something, eh, Katharine?"</p>

<p>"Leave you something?" said Katharine, apparently waking from
a brown study. "I was thinking we must be going&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is it to-night that Lady Ferrilby dines with us? No, we mustn’t
be late," said Rodney, rising. "D’you know the Ferrilbys, Miss
Datchet? They own Trantem Abbey," he added, for her information,
as she looked doubtful. "And if Katharine makes herself very charming
to-night, perhaps’ll lend it to us for the honeymoon."</p>

<p>"I agree that may be a reason. Otherwise she’s a dull woman,"
said Katharine. "At least," she added, as if to qualify her abruptness,
"I find it difficult to talk to her."</p>

<p>"Because you expect every one else to take all the trouble. I’ve
seen her sit silent a whole evening," he said, turning to Mary,
as he had frequently done already. "Don’t you find that, too?
Sometimes when we’re alone, I’ve counted the time on my watch"&mdash;here
he took out a large gold watch, and tapped the glass&mdash;"the time
between one remark and the next. And once I counted ten minutes
and twenty seconds, and then, if you’ll believe me, she only said
‘Um!’"</p>

<p>"I’m sure I’m sorry," Katharine apologized. "I know it’s a bad
habit, but then, you see, at home&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rest of her excuse was cut short, so far as Mary was concerned,
by the closing of the door. She fancied she could hear William
finding fresh fault on the stairs. A moment later, the door-bell
rang again, and Katharine reappeared, having left her purse on
a chair. She soon found it, and said, pausing for a moment at
the door, and speaking differently as they were alone:</p>

<p>"I think being engaged is very bad for the character." She shook
her purse in her hand until the coins jingled, as if she alluded
merely to this example of her forgetfulness. But the remark puzzled
Mary; it seemed to refer to something else; and her manner had
changed so strangely, now that William was out of hearing, that
she could not help looking at her for an explanation. She looked
almost stern, so that Mary, trying to smile at her, only succeeded
in producing a silent stare of interrogation.</p>

<p>As the door shut for the second time, she sank on to the floor
in front of the fire, trying, now that their bodies were not there
to distract her, to piece together her impressions of them as
a whole. And, though priding herself, with all other men and women,
upon an infallible eye for character, she could not feel at all
certain that she knew what motives inspired Katharine Hilbery
in life. There was something that carried her on smoothly, out
of reach&mdash;something, yes, but what?&mdash;something that reminded Mary
of Ralph. Oddly enough, he gave her the same feeling, too, and
with him, too, she felt baffled. Oddly enough, for no two people,
she hastily concluded, were more unlike. And yet both had this
hidden impulse, this incalculable force&mdash;this thing they cared
for and didn’t talk about&mdash;oh, what was it?</p>
