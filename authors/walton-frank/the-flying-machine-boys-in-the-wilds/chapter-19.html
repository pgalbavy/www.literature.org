<p>“Yes, you knew it all right!” Carl exclaimed, as the boy stood looking
into the dark passage revealed by the falling of the stone. “You always
know a lot of things just after they occur!”
</p><p>“Anyway,” Jimmie answered with a grin, “I knew there ought to be a
secret passage somewhere. Where do you suppose the old thing leads to?”
</p><p>“For one thing,” Carl answered, “it probably leads under the great stone
slab in front of the entrance, because when Miguel, the foxy boy with
the red and blue lights, disappeared he went down into the ground right
there. And I’ll bet,” he went on, “that it runs out to the rocky
elevation to the west and connects with the forest near where the
machine is.”
</p><p>“Those old chaps must have burrowed like rabbits!” declared Jimmie.
</p><p>“Don’t you think the men who operated the temples ever carried the
stones which weigh a hundred tons or cut passages through solid rocks!”
Carl declared. “They worked the Indians for all that part of the game,
just as the Egyptians worked the Hebrews on the lower Nile.”
</p><p>“Well, the only way to find out where it goes,” Jimmie suggested, “is to
follow it. We can’t stand here and guess it out.”
</p><p>“Indeed we can’t,” agreed Carl. “I’ll go on down the incline and you
follow along. Looks pretty slippery here, so we’d better keep close
together. I don’t suppose we can put the stone back,” he added with a
parting glance into the chamber.
</p><p>“What would we want to put it back for?” demanded Jimmie.
</p><p>“How do we know who will be snooping around here while we are under
ground?” Carl asked impatiently. “If some one should come along here and
stuff the stone back into the hole and we shouldn’t be able to find any
exit, we’d be in a nice little tight box, wouldn’t we?”
</p><p>“Well, if we can’t lift it back into the hole,” Jimmie argued, “I guess
we can push it along in front of us. This incline seems slippery enough
to pass it along like a sleighload of girls on a snowy hill.”
</p><p>The boys concentrated their strength, which was not very great at that
time because of their wounds, on the stone and were soon gratified to
see it sliding swiftly out of sight along a dark incline.
</p><p>“I wonder what Sam will say?” asked Jimmie.
</p><p>“He won’t know anything about it!” Carl declared.
</p><p>“Oh, yes, he will!” asserted Jimmie, “he’ll be looking around before
we’ve been absent ten minutes. Perhaps we’d ought to go back and tell
him what we’ve found, and what we’re going to do.”
</p><p>“Then he’d want to go with us,” Carl suggested, “and that would leave
the savages to sneak into the temple whenever they find the nerve to do
so, and also leave Pedro to work any old tricks he saw fit. Besides,”
the boy went on, “we won’t be gone more than ten minutes.”
</p><p>“You’re always making a sneak on somebody,” grinned Jimmie. “You had to
go and climb up on our machine last night, and get mixed up in all this
trouble. You’re always doing something of the kind!”
</p><p>“I guess you’re glad I stuck around, ain’t you?” laughed Carl. “You’d
’a’ had a nice time in that den of lions without my gun, eh?”
</p><p>“Well, get a move on!” laughed Jimmie. “And hang on to the walls as you
go ahead. This floor looks like one of the chutes under the newspaper
offices in New York. And hold your light straight ahead.”
</p><p>The incline extended only a few yards. Arrived at the bottom, the boys
estimated that the top of the six-foot passage was not more than a
couple of yards from the surface of the earth. Much to their surprise
they found the air in the place remarkably pure.
</p><p>At the bottom of the incline the passage turned away to the north for a
few paces, then struck out west. From this angle the boys could see
little fingers of light which probably penetrated into the passage from
crevices in the steps of the temple.
</p><p>Gaining the front of the old structure, they saw that one of the stones
just below the steps was hung on a rude though perfectly reliable hinge,
and that a steel rod attached to it operated a mechanism which placed
the slab entirely under the control of any one mounting the steps, if
acquainted with the secret of the door.
</p><p>“Here’s where Miguel drops down!” laughed Jimmie, his searchlight prying
into the details of the cunning device. “Well, well!” he went on, “those
old Incas certainly took good care of their precious carcasses. It’s a
pity they couldn’t have coaxed the Spaniards into some of their secret
passages and then sealed them up!”
</p><p>The passage ran on to the west after passing the temple for some
distance, and then turned abruptly to the north. The lights showed a
long, tunnel-like place, apparently cut in the solid rock.
</p><p>“I wonder if this tunnel leads to the woods we saw at the west of the
cove,” Carl asked. “I hope it does!” he added, “for then we can get to
the machine and get something to eat and get some ammunition and,” he
added hopefully, “we may be able to get away in the jolly old <u>Ann</u> and
leave the Indians watching an empty temple.”
</p><p>“Do you suppose Miguel came into this passage when he dropped out of
sight in front of the temple?” asked Jimmie.
</p><p>“Of course, he did!”
</p><p>“Then where did he go?”
</p><p>“Why, back into the temple.”
</p><p>“Through the den of lions? I guess not!”
</p><p>“That’s a fact!” exclaimed Carl. “He wouldn’t go through the den of
lions, would he? And he never could have traveled this passage to the
end and hiked back over the country in time to drop the gate and lift
the bars in front of the den! It was Miguel that did that, wasn’t it?”
the boy added, turning enquiringly to his chum. “It must have been for
there was no one else there.”
</p><p>“What are you getting at?” asked Jimmie.
</p><p>“This,” replied Carl. “There must be a passage leading from this one
back into the temple on the west side. It may enter the room where the
bunks are, or it may come into the corridor back by the fountain, but
there’s one somewhere all right.”
</p><p>“You’re the wise little boy!” laughed Jimmie. “Let’s go and see.”
</p><p>The boys returned to the trap-like slab in front of the temple and from
that point examined every inch of the south wall for a long distance.
Finally a push on a stone brought forth a grinding noise, and then a
passage similar to that discovered in the den was revealed.
</p><p>“There you are!” said Carl. “There’s the passage that leads to the west
side of the temple. Shall we go on in and give Sam and Pedro the merry
ha, ha? Mighty funny,” he added, without waiting for his question to be
answered, “that all these trap doors are so easily found and work so
readily. They’re just about as easy to manipulate as one of the foolish
houses we see on the stage. It’s no trick to operate them at all.”
</p><p>“Well,” Jimmie argued, “these passages and traps are doubtless used
every day by a man who don’t take any precautions about keeping them
hidden. I presume Miguel is the only person here who knows of their
existence, and he just slams around in them sort of careless-like.”
</p><p>“That’s the answer!” replied Carl. “Let’s chase along and see where the
tunnel ends, and then get back to Sam. He may be crying his eyes out for
our polite society right now!”
</p><p>The boys followed the tunnel for what seemed to them to be a long
distance. At length they came to a turn from which a mist of daylight
could be seen. In five minutes more they stood looking out into the
forest.
</p><p>The entrance to the passage was concealed only by carelessly heaped-up
rocks, between the interstices of which grew creeping vines and
brambles. Looking from the forest side, the place resembled a heap of
rocks, probably inhabited by all manner of creeping things and covered
over with vines.
</p><p>As the boys peered out between the vines, Jimmie nudged his chum in the
side and whispered as he pointed straight out:
</p><p>“There’s the <u>Ann</u>.”
</p><p>“But that isn’t where we left her!” argued Carl.
</p><p>“Well, it’s the <u>Ann</u>, just the same, isn’t it?”
</p><p>“I suppose so,” was the reply. “I presume,” the boy went on, “the
Indians moved it to the place where it now is.”
</p><p>“Don’t you ever think they did!” answered Jimmie. “The Indians wouldn’t
touch it with a pair of tongs! Felix and Pedro probably moved it, the
idea being to hide it from view.”
</p><p>“I guess that’s right!” Carl agreed. “I’m going out,” he continued, in a
moment, “and see if I can find any savages. You lie low till I get back.
I won’t be gone very long.”
</p><p>“What you mean,” Jimmie grinned, “is that you’re going out to see if you
won’t find any savages. That is,” he went on, “you think of going out.
As a matter of fact, I’m the one that’s going out, because the wild
beasts chewed you up proper, and they didn’t hurt me at all.”
</p><p>The boy crowded past Carl as he spoke and dodged out into the forest.
Carl waited impatiently for ten minutes and was on the point of going in
quest of the boy when Jimmie came leisurely up to the curtain of vines
which hid the passage and looked in with a grin on his freckled face.
</p><p>“Come on out,” he said, “the air is fine!”
</p><p>“Any savages?” asked Carl.
</p><p>“Not a savage!”
</p><p>“Anything to eat?” demanded the boy.
</p><p>“Bales of it!” answered Jimmie. “The savages never touched the <u>Ann</u>.”
</p><p>Carl crept out of the opening and made his way to where Jimmie sat flat
on the bole of a fallen tree eating ham sandwiches.
</p><p>“Are there any left?” he asked.
</p><p>“Half a bushel!”
</p><p>“Then perhaps the others stand some chance of getting one or two.”
</p><p>“There’s more than we can all eat before to-morrow morning,” Jimmie
answered. “And if the relief train doesn’t come before that time we’ll
mount the <u>Ann</u> and glide away.”
</p><p>While the boys sat eating their sandwiches and enjoying the clear sweet
air of the morning, there came an especially savage chorus of yells from
the direction of the temple.
</p><p>“The Indians seem to be a mighty enthusiastic race!” declared Jimmie.
“Suppose we go to the <u>Ann</u>, grab the provisions, and go back to the
temple just to see what they’re amusing themselves with now!”
</p><p>This suggestion meeting with favor, the boys proceeded to the aeroplane
which was only a short distance away and loaded themselves down with
provisions and cartridges. During their journey they saw not the
slightest indications of the Indians. It was quite evident that they
were all occupied with the <u>siege</u> of the temple.
</p><p>On leaving the entrance, the boys restored the vines so far as possible
to their original condition and filled their automatics with cartridges.
</p><p>“No one will ever catch me without cartridges again,” Carl declared as
he patted his weapon. “The idea of getting into a den of lions with only
four shots between us and destruction!”
</p><p>“Well, hurry up!” cried Jimmie. “I know from the accent the Indians
placed on the last syllable that there’s something doing at the temple.
And Sam, you know, hasn’t got many cartridges.”
</p><p>“I wouldn’t run very fast,” declared Carl, “if I knew that the Indians
had captured Miguel. That’s the ruffian who shut us into the den of
lions!”
</p><p>When the boys came to the passage opening from the tunnel on the west of
the temple, they turned into it and proceeded a few yards south. Here
they found an opening which led undoubtedly directly to the rear of the
corridor in the vicinity of the fountain.
</p><p>The stone which had in past years concealed the mouth of this passage
had evidently not been used for a long time, for it lay broken into
fragments on the stone floor.
</p><p>When the boys came to the end of the passage, they saw by the slices of
light which lay between the stones that they were facing the corridor
from the rear. They knew well enough that somewhere in that vicinity was
a door opening into the temple, but for some moments they could not find
it. At last Jimmie, prying into a crack with his knife, struck a piece
of metal and the stone dropped backward.
</p><p>He was about to crawl through into the corridor when Carl caught him by
one leg and held him back. It took the lad only an instant to comprehend
what was going on. A horde of savages was crowding up the steps and into
the temple itself, and Sam stood in the middle of the corridor with a
smoking weapon in his hand.
</p><p>As the boys looked he threw the automatic into the faces of the
onrushing crowd as if its usefulness had departed.
