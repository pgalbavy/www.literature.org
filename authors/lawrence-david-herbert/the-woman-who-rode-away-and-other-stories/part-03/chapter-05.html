<p>The man was hopelessly in love with her.  She saw his broad, rather
short red face gazing up at her fixedly: till his wife turned too
to look, then he picked up his glass and tossed the wine down his
throat.  The wife stared long at the figures on the balcony.  She
was handsome and rather gloomy, and surely older than he, with that
great difference that lies between a rather overwhelming, superior
woman over forty, and her more irresponsible husband of thirty-five
or so.  It seemed like the difference of a whole generation.  &quot;He
is my generation,&quot; thought Juliet, &quot;and she is Maurice's
generation.&quot;  Juliet was not yet thirty.</p>

<p>The peasant in his white cotton trousers and pale pink shirt, and
battered old straw hat, was attractive, so clean, and full of the
cleanliness of health.  He was stout and broad, and seemed
shortish, but his flesh was full of vitality, as if he were always
about to spring up into movement, to work, even, as she had seen
him with the child, to play.  He was the type of Italian peasant
that wants to make an offering of himself, passionately wants to
make an offering of himself, of his powerful flesh and thudding
blood-stroke.  But he was also completely a peasant, in that he
would wait for the woman to make the move.  He would hang round in
a long, consuming passivity of desire, hoping, hoping for the woman
to come for him.  But he would never try to advance to her: never.
She would have to make the advance.  Only he would hang round,
within reach.</p>

<p>Feeling her look at him, he flung off his old straw hat, showing
his round, close-cropped brown head, and reached out with a large
brown-red hand for the great loaf, from which he broke a piece and
started chewing with bulging cheek.  He knew she was looking at
him.  And she had such power over him, the hot inarticulate animal,
with such a hot, massive blood-stream down his great veins!  He was
hot through with countless suns, and mindless as noon.  And shy
with a violent, farouche shyness, that would wait for her with
consuming wanting, but would never, never move towards her.</p>

<p>With him, it would be like bathing in another kind of sunshine,
heavy and big and perspiring: and afterwards one would forget.
Personally, he would not exist.  It would be just a bath of warm,
powerful life - then separating and forgetting.  Then again, the
procreative bath, like sun.</p>

<p>But would that not be good!  She was so tired of personal contacts,
and having to talk with the man afterwards.  With that healthy
creature, one would just go satisfied away, afterwards.  As she sat
there, she felt the life streaming from him to her, and her to him.
She knew by his movements he felt her even more than she felt him.
It was almost a definite pain of consciousness in the body of each
of them, and each sat as if distracted, watched by a keen-eyed
spouse, possessor.</p>

<p>And Juliet thought:  Why shouldn't I go to him!  Why shouldn't I
bear his child?  It would be like bearing a child to the
unconscious sun and the unconscious earth, a child like a fruit. - 
And the flower of her womb radiated.  It did not care about
sentiment or possession.  It wanted man-dew only, utterly
improvident.  But her heart was clouded with fear.  She dare not!
She dare not!  If only the man would find some way!  But he would
not.  He would only hover and wait, hover in endless desire,
waiting for her to cross the gully.  And she dare not, she dare
not.  And he would hang round.</p>

<p>&quot;You are not afraid of people seeing you when you take your sun-
baths?&quot; said her husband, turning round and looking across at the
peasants.  The saturnine wife over the gully, turned also to stare
at the Villa.  It was a kind of battle.</p>

<p>&quot;No!  One needn't be seen.  Will you do it too?  Will you take the
sun-baths?&quot; said Juliet to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Why - er - yes!  I think I should like to, while I am here.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a gleam in his eyes, a desperate kind of courage of
desire to taste this new fruit, this woman with rosy, sun-ripening
breasts tilting within her wrapper.  And she thought of him with
his blanched, etiolated little city figure, walking in the sun in
the desperation of a husband's rights.  And her mind swooned again.
The strange, branded little fellow, the good citizen, branded like
a criminal in the naked eye of the sun.  How he would hate exposing
himself!</p>

<p>And the flower of her womb went dizzy, dizzy.  She knew she would
take him.  She knew she would bear his child.  She knew it was for
him, the branded little city man, that her womb was open radiating
like a lotus, like the purple spread of a daisy anemone, dark at
the core.  She knew she would not go across to the peasant; she had
not enough courage, she was not free enough.  And she knew the
peasant would never come for her, he had the dogged passivity of
the earth, and would wait, wait, only putting himself in her sight,
again and again, lingering across her vision, with the persistency
of animal yearning.</p>

<p>She had seen the flushed blood in the peasant's burnt face, and
felt the jetting, sudden blue heat pouring over her from his
kindled eyes, and the rousing of his big penis against his body - 
for her, surging for her.  Yet she would never come to him - she
daren't, she daren't, so much was against her.  And the little
etiolated body of her husband, city-branded, would possess her, and
his little, frantic penis would beget another child in her.  She
could not help it.  She was bound to the vast, fixed wheel of
circumstance, and there was no Perseus in the universe to cut the
bonds.</p>
