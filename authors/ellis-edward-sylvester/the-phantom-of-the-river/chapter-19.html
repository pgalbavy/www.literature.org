<p>Jethro Juggens was alarmed on the very threshold of his strange
enterprise by the threatened danger of failure. When everything
was ready to start, the flatboat refused to stir so much as an
inch.</p>

<p>In the hope of helping matters, he swung the bow oar a number
of times, so as to turn the head out in the stream. It moved a
foot or two, and then became stationary, gradually working back
to its former position. Then he tried the same thing with the
stern oar, accomplishing about as much as if he had attempted
to overturn a rock.</p>

<p>"Dat beats de dickens!" muttered the puzzled youth, stopping
to rest himself. "Qu'ar de wind am jes' strong enough to hold
de boat stock still. I guess I'll onwestigate."</p>

<p>And, doing so, the mystery was speedily solved. He had forgotten
to hoist the anchor, which lay imbedded on the bottom, on the
outside of the boat near the stern.</p>

<p>"I'll neber tell nobody dat," he said, ashamed of the blunder.
Lifting the heavy weight over his gunwale, he dropped it in the
bottom of the boat, which immediately began gliding slowly up
stream. With the aid of the long paddles, he easily worked the
craft so far out in the stream that there was no danger of running
into any of the overhanging limbs and vegetation.</p>

<p>Jethro did not make the mistake of paddling the flatboat into
the middle of the current, which was so much stronger there as
to impede, if not to check, its progress altogether. And, as before
stated, there could be no saying how much longer this favorable
wind would continue.</p>

<p>The dusky youth overflowed with complacency when he sat down
at the prow and noticed the satisfactory trend of events.</p>

<p>He was within a dozen yards or so of the wooded bank, sometimes
approaching still closer, in accordance with the configuration
of the land. His desire to keep advancing, while the chance was
his, led him to venture further in, in order to take advantage
of the sluggish current. Once or twice he felt a projecting root
graze the bottom, and again the craft came almost to a standstill
from partially grounding in a shallow portion. Its momentum, however,
carried it over into deeper water, when its speed instantly increased.</p>

<p>Seeing nothing for him to do, Jethro seated himself at the bow,
with his rifle resting in the boat near him, and his feet hanging
over the water.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kenton and Boone and Altman and Ashbridge and all de rest
ob de folks couldn't hab tought ob dis if dey had put their minds
altogeder onto it. It was Jethro Juggens dat trotted out de idee.
Some folks tinks he ain't much more dan a fool, and mebbe he ain't,
but he knows a ting or two, and when dey cotch sight&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that instant the flatboat struck a shallow portion with such
suddenness that it instantly stopped, and the youth, unprepared
for the shock, sprawled overboard with a loud splash.</p>

<p>Nothing more serious than a shock and wetting resulted, and when
he clambered to his feet the water did not reach to his knees.
Grasping the prow with his huge hand, and applying his prodigious
strength, he easily forced the front of the boat into deeper water
and swung himself over the gunwale.</p>

<p>"Dat sort of bus'ness am inconwenieut, and it musn't happen agin."</p>

<p>Several sweeps of the two oars, he grasped one in either hand,
worked the craft sufficiently far from land to prevent any repetition
of his mishap. Then, caring naught for his moistened clothing,
he sat down at the prow again.</p>

<p>The boat was moving steadily up stream, with more speed, indeed,
than it had ever shown descending it. So long as the strong wind
blew from the west this progress would continue. The moon, veiled
at intervals by the drifting masses of clouds, sometimes revealed
the trees on his right sweeping backward and occasionally, when
the light was wholly unobstructed, he could catch the dim shadowy
outlines of the Ohio shore. Not only was the water rippled by
the bow of the boat as it forced its way forward, but it was broken
into tiny chopping seas by the action of the gale.</p>

<p>The roving eyes detected no sign of life in any direction. The
gloom was not pierced even by the starlike twinkle of some Indian
campfire or signal light, but the dull boom of a rifle report,
rolling over the river from the direction of Rattlesnake Gulch,
proved that life, fierce, alert and vigilant, still throbbed with
terrifying intensity.</p>

<p>It so came about that the second Shawanoe, he who succeeded in
recapturing the canoe from Simon Kenton, was returning in the
direction of the clearing. The sagacious warrior knew the ranger
would be quick to discover the theft of his property, and would
make search for it. Only by the utmost care and skill could he
escape an encounter with the terrible scout, whom he held in unspeakable
dread.</p>

<p>It was natural, therefore, that he should give his closest attention
to the shore he was skirting, confident that that was the only
direction whence danger could come. So, while the canoe skimmed
the water, he held his gaze on the bank, and watched and listened
with the acuteness of long training.</p>

<p>"Who dar?"</p>

<p>The question was asked in a sepulchral voice, and would have
startled the bravest man. The head of the Indian whirled about
like a flash, and he saw that which, it is safe to say, no member
of his race had ever seen&mdash;an Ohio flatboat gliding up stream,
with a broad spread of white sail, and moving with a noiselessness
of death itself.</p>

<p>More than that, it was almost upon him. Only by dextrous work
could he save himself from being run down. Less than a dozen feet
separated them.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE PHANTOM BOAT</em>.]</p>

<p>Glancing at the frightful object, the Shawanoe observed the figure
of a sturdy, broad-shouldered man, standing near the bow with
his rifle in his grasp. The sight was more than he could stand.
With a frantic sweep of his paddle he drove the canoe like a swallow
against the bank, leaped out and dashed into the woods.</p>

<p>"Dat chap acts as dough he am scared," remarked Jethro, in doubt
whether or not to fire; "de next time, I 'spose, I oughter shoot
fust and den make my obspectful inquiries afterward."</p>

<p>The incident was hardly over when to the surprise and disappointment
of the youth the progress of the boat began to slacken, soon ceased,
and then it slowly floated down stream. The wind had died out
more suddenly than it had risen. He quickly dropped the anchor
overboard.</p>

<p>"Wonder how fur I've come," he thought, peering at the bank and
unable to locate himself; "reckon I must hab come fifteen or twenty
miles&mdash;but dat can't be either, for de folks at de block-house
would hab seen me if I didn't see dem&mdash;hulloa! dat chap must tink
he knows me; it ain't him after all."</p>

<p>The canoe which had shot under the bank so suddenly, now emerged
again and paddled straight towards the flatboat, only a short
distance away. The action so startled the dusky youth that he
would have acted upon his own suggestion of firing before asking
any questions, had he not perceived that the occupant was a white
man.</p>

<p>"Dat can't be Mr. Kenton or Boone," mused Jethro, closely studying
the stranger. "No, it am somebody dat hasn't de honor ob my obquaintance.
Him and me ain't neber met afore."</p>

<p>As the individual came closer and was more plainly shown in the
dim moonlight, he was seen to be a sturdy man in middle life,
dressed much the same as Mr. Ashbridge and Altman&mdash;that is, with
more regard for the fashions of the age than was shown by men
like Boone and Kenton.</p>

<p>"Good evening," he called, nodding his head in salutation; "may
I come aboard?"</p>

<p>"Who am yo'? Am yo' name Girty?" asked Jethro, in doubt whether
to permit the man to join him, now that his canoe was near enough
to permit him to do so. His appearance was pleasing, and his voice
had a hearty ring about it, but the African, since he was master
of the situation, felt he could not be too careful of his company.</p>

<p>The stranger laughed at the question asked him, and replied:</p>

<p>"Bless me, that's the first time I was ever taken for Mr. Girty.
You seem to be alone on the boat."</p>

<p>Jethro suspected this to be a trick meant to make him unmask
his weakness. He was not to be caught that way.</p>

<p>"No, sah! dar's whar yo's mistooken, sah. Dan'l Kenton and Simon
Boone, and 'leven oder gemman am in dis boat wid me, and if yo'&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," interrupted the stranger, with another laugh, so
genial in its character that it disarmed the youth.</p>

<p>"'Scoose me; I meant to say dat dem folks would like to be wid
me."</p>

<p>"My son, you and I are the best of friends; you surely have no
misgiving regarding me; my name is Finley."</p>

<p>And, with this remark, he stepped over the gunwale and cordially
shook the hand of Jethro, who was won by his looks and manner.
He helped fasten the canoe at the side of the flatboat, and invited
the visitor to seat himself upon the remaining sheets at the stern,
an invitation that was so agreeably accepted that Jethro was certain
he had never met so delightful a gentleman.</p>

<p>There may be some among my readers who have recognized the name
of the man who paddled out in the canoe as among the most honored
in the early history of the West. He was James B. Finley, the
famous missionary, whose career is one of the brightest pages
among the many stained by cruelty, vice and crime. For years he
carried his life in his hands, traversing the vast stretches of
wilderness with rifle over his shoulder, living on the game brought
down by his own marksmanship, or what he could obtain in the lodges
of the red men or the cabins of the pioneers. He slept in the
woods, freezing by the lonely campfire, or sweltering in the smothering
heat of the summer sun.</p>

<p>And wherever this devoted man went, he carried the message of
his Master. He labored unceasingly in His vineyard, illustrating
precept by his own example, and winning many to the right way,
not only among the rough bordermen, but from among the fierce
warriors themselves.</p>

<p>Without turning aside in this place to refer more fully to Rev.
Mr. Finley, the interesting fact should be recalled that it was
under his exhortation that Simon Kenton, years subsequent to the
events we are now recording, professed conversion, and became
a deeply devout man.</p>

<p>The missionary showed his tact by making no reference to the
tremendous falsehood he had just brought home to Jethro Juggens.</p>

<p>Laying his hand in a fatherly way upon the shoulder of the youth,
he remarked:</p>

<p>"You will believe me, my son, when I tell you I am surprised."</p>

<p>"Yes, I offen s'prise folks."</p>

<p>"What is your name, please?"</p>

<p>Jethro answered all his questions truthfully and respectfully,
so that in a few minutes the gentleman gained a fair understanding
of the incidents in which the colored youth had been involved
during the past few days, and which placed him in his present
extraordinary situation.</p>

<p>"I have seen a great many flatboats pass down the river," remarked
Mr. Finley, at the close of the interesting narrative, "but this
is the first time I ever saw any go up stream."</p>

<p>"Yes, I tinked I'se begun de fashine."</p>

<p>"But why is it you are at rest?"</p>

<p>"'Cause de anchor am drapped overboard."</p>

<p>"But don't you notice that the wind is blowing again, and the
boat will move readily."</p>

<p>Jethro had not observed the fact until his friend reminded him
of it. Then he made haste to hoist the anchor, and once more the
flatboat resumed its singular voyage up the Ohio.</p>
