<p>The previous chapter marks the conclusion of the written narrative
which the Persian left behind him.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the horrors of a situation which seemed definitely
to abandon them to their deaths, M. de Chagny and his companion
were saved by the sublime devotion of Christine Daae.  And I had
the rest of the story from the lips of the daroga himself.</p>

<p>When I went to see him, he was still living in his little flat
in the Rue de Rivoli, opposite the Tuileries.  He was very ill,
and it required all my ardor as an historian pledged to the truth
to persuade him to live the incredible tragedy over again for
my benefit.  His faithful old servant Darius showed me in to him. 
The daroga received me at a window overlooking the garden of the
Tuileries.  He still had his magnificent eyes, but his poor face
looked very worn.  He had shaved the whole of his head, which
was usually covered with an astrakhan cap; he was dressed in a
long, plain coat and amused himself by unconsciously twisting
his thumbs inside the sleeves; but his mind was quite clear, and
he told me his story with perfect lucidity.</p>

<p>It seems that, when he opened his eyes, the daroga found himself
lying on a bed.  M. de Chagny was on a sofa, beside the wardrobe. 
An angel and a devil were watching over them.</p>

<p>After the deceptions and illusions of the torture-chamber, the
precision of the details of that quiet little middle-class room
seemed to have been invented for the express purpose of puzzling
the mind of the mortal rash enough to stray into that abode of
living nightmare. The wooden bedstead, the waxed mahogany chairs,
the chest of drawers, those brasses, the little square antimacassars
carefully placed on the backs of the chairs, the clock on the
mantelpiece and the harmless-looking ebony caskets at either end,
lastly, the whatnot filled with shells, with red pin-cushions,
with mother-of-pearl boats and an enormous ostrich-egg, the whole
discreetly lighted by a shaded lamp standing on a small round
table:  this collection of ugly, peaceable, reasonable furniture,
AT <em>THE BOTTOM OF THE OPERA CELLARS, </em>bewildered the imagination
more than all the late fantastic happenings.</p>

<p>And the figure of the masked man seemed all the more formidable
in this old-fashioned, neat and trim little frame.  It bent down
over the Persian and said, in his ear:</p>

<p>"Are you better, daroga? ... You are looking at my furniture?
...  It is all that I have left of my poor unhappy mother."</p>

<p>Christine Daae did not say a word:  she moved about noiselessly,
like a sister of charity, who had taken a vow of silence.  She
brought a cup of cordial, or of hot tea, he did not remember which. 
The man in the mask took it from her hands and gave it to the
Persian.  M. de Chagny was still sleeping.</p>

<p>Erik poured a drop of rum into the daroga's cup and, pointing
to the viscount, said:</p>

<p>"He came to himself long before we knew if you were still alive,
daroga.  He is quite well.  He is asleep.  We must not wake him."</p>

<p>Erik left the room for a moment, and the Persian raised himself
on his elbow, looked around him and saw Christine Daae sitting
by the fireside.  He spoke to her, called her, but he was still
very weak and fell back on his pillow.  Christine came to him,
laid her hand on his forehead and went away again.  And the Persian
remembered that, as she went, she did not give a glance at M.
de Chagny, who, it is true, was sleeping peacefully; and she sat
down again in her chair by the chimney-corner, silent as a sister
of charity who had taken a vow of silence.</p>

<p>Erik returned with some little bottles which he placed on the
mantelpiece.  And, again in a whisper, so as not to wake M. de
Chagny, he said to the Persian, after sitting down and feeling
his pulse:</p>

<p>"You are now saved, both of you.  And soon I shall take you up
to the surface of the earth, TO <em>PLEASE MY WIFE</em>."</p>

<p>Thereupon he rose, without any further explanation, and disappeared
once more.</p>

<p>The Persian now looked at Christine's quiet profile under the
lamp. She was reading a tiny book, with gilt edges, like a religious
book. There are editions of <em>THE IMITATION </em>that look like
that.  The Persian still had in his ears the natural tone in which
the other had said, "to please my wife."  Very gently, he called
her again; but Christine was wrapped up in her book and did not
hear him.</p>

<p>Erik returned, mixed the daroga a draft and advised him not to
speak to "his wife" again nor to any one, <em>BECAUSE IT MIGHT
BE VERY DANGEROUS TO EVERYBODY'S HEALTH</em>.</p>

<p>Eventually, the Persian fell asleep, like M. de Chagny, and did
not wake until he was in his own room, nursed by his faithful
Darius, who told him that, on the night before, he was found propped
against the door of his flat, where he had been brought by a stranger,
who rang the bell before going away.</p>

<p>As soon as the daroga recovered his strength and his wits, he
sent to Count Philippe's house to inquire after the viscount's
health.  The answer was that the young man had not been seen and
that Count Philippe was dead.  His body was found on the bank
of the Opera lake, on the Rue-Scribe side.  The Persian remembered
the requiem mass which he had heard from behind the wall of the
torture-chamber, and had no doubt concerning the crime and the
criminal.  Knowing Erik as he did, he easily reconstructed the
tragedy.  Thinking that his brother had run away with Christine
Daae, Philippe had dashed in pursuit of him along the Brussels
Road, where he knew that everything was prepared for the elopement. 
Failing to find the pair, he hurried back to the Opera, remembered
Raoul's strange confidence about his fantastic rival and learned
that the viscount had made every effort to enter the cellars of
the theater and that he had disappeared, leaving his hat in the
prima donna's dressing-room beside an empty pistol-case. And the
count, who no longer entertained any doubt of his brother's madness,
in his turn darted into that infernal underground maze.  This
was enough, in the Persian's eyes, to explain the discovery of
the Comte de Chagny's corpse on the shore of the lake, where the
siren, Erik's siren, kept watch.</p>

<p>The Persian did not hesitate.  He determined to inform the police. 
Now the case was in the hands of an examining-magistrate called
Faure, an incredulous, commonplace, superficial sort of person,
(I write as I think), with a mind utterly unprepared to receive
a confidence of this kind.  M. Faure took down the daroga's depositions
and proceeded to treat him as a madman.</p>

<p>Despairing of ever obtaining a hearing, the Persian sat down
to write. As the police did not want his evidence, perhaps the
press would be glad of it; and he had just written the last line
of the narrative I have quoted in the preceding chapters, when
Darius announced the visit of a stranger who refused his name,
who would not show his face and declared simply that he did not
intend to leave the place until he had spoken to the daroga.</p>

<p>The Persian at once felt who his singular visitor was and ordered
him to be shown in.  The daroga was right.  It was the ghost,
it was Erik!</p>

<p>He looked extremely weak and leaned against the wall, as though
he were afraid of falling.  Taking off his hat, he revealed a
forehead white as wax.  The rest of the horrible face was hidden
by the mask.</p>

<p>The Persian rose to his feet as Erik entered.</p>

<p>"Murderer of Count Philippe, what have you done with his brother
and Christine Daae?"</p>

<p>Erik staggered under this direct attack, kept silent for a moment,
dragged himself to a chair and heaved a deep sigh.  Then, speaking
in short phrases and gasping for breath between the words:</p>

<p>"Daroga, don't talk to me ... about Count Philippe ...  He was
dead ... by the time ... I left my house ... he was dead ... when
...  the siren sang ...  It was an ... accident ... a sad ...
a very sad ... accident. He fell very awkwardly ... but simply
and naturally ...  into the lake! ..."</p>

<p>"You lie!" shouted the Persian.</p>

<p>Erik bowed his head and said:</p>

<p>"I have not come here ... to talk about Count Philippe ...  but
to tell you that ... I am going ... to die..."</p>

<p>"Where are Raoul de Chagny and Christine Daae?"</p>

<p>"I am going to die."</p>

<p>"Raoul de Chagny and Christine Daae?"</p>

<p>"Of love ... daroga ... I am dying ... of love ... That is how
it is ... loved her so! ... And I love her still ... daroga ...
and I am dying of love for her, I ... I tell you! ... If you knew
how beautiful she was ...  when she let me kiss her ... alive
... It was the first ... time, daroga, the first ... time I ever
kissed a woman ...  Yes, alive ...  I kissed her alive ... and
she looked as beautiful as if she had been dead!"</p>

<p>The Persian shook Erik by the arm:</p>

<p>"Will you tell me if she is alive or dead."</p>

<p>"Why do you shake me like that?" asked Erik, making an effort
to speak more connectedly.  "I tell you that I am going to die... 
Yes, I kissed her alive ..."</p>

<p>"And now she is dead?"</p>

<p>"I tell you I kissed her just like that, on her forehead ... 
and she did not draw back her forehead from my lips! ... Oh, she
is a good girl! ... As to her being dead, I don't think so; but
it has nothing to do with me ...  No, no, she is not dead!  And
no one shall touch a hair of her head!  She is a good, honest
girl, and she saved your life, daroga, at a moment when I would
not have given twopence for your Persian skin.  As a matter of
fact, nobody bothered about you.  Why were you there with that
little chap?  You would have died as well as he!  My word, how
she entreated me for her little chap!  But I told her that, as
she had turned the scorpion, she had, through that very fact,
and of her own free will, become engaged to me and that she did
not need to have two men engaged to her, which was true enough.</p>

<p>"As for you, you did not exist, you had ceased to exist, I tell
you, and you were going to die with the other! ... Only, mark
me, daroga, when you were yelling like the devil, because of the
water, Christine came to me with her beautiful blue eyes wide
open, and swore to me, as she hoped to be saved, that she consented
to be MY <em>LIVING WIFE! ... </em>Until then, in the depths of
her eyes, daroga, I had always seen my dead wife; it was the first
time I saw MY <em>LIVING WIFE </em>there.  She was sincere, as
she hoped to be saved.  She would not kill herself.  It was a
bargain ...  Half a minute later, all the water was back in the
lake; and I had a hard job with you, daroga, for, upon my honor,
I thought you were done for! ...  However! ... There you were!
... It was understood that I was to take you both up to the surface
of the earth. When, at last, I cleared the Louis-Philippe room
of you, I came back alone ..."</p>

<p>"What have you done with the Vicomte de Chagny?" asked the Persian,
interrupting him.</p>

<p>"Ah, you see, daroga, I couldn't carry <em>HIM </em>up like that,
at once.  ... He was a hostage ...  But I could not keep him in
the house on the lake, either, because of Christine; so I locked
him up comfortably, I chained him up nicely&mdash;a whiff of the Mazenderan
scent had left him as limp as a rag&mdash;in the Communists' dungeon,
which is in the most deserted and remote part of the Opera, below
the fifth cellar, where no one ever comes, and where no one ever
hears you.  Then I came back to Christine, she was waiting for
me."</p>

<p>Erik here rose solemnly.  Then he continued, but, as he spoke,
he was overcome by all his former emotion and began to tremble
like a leaf:</p>

<p>"Yes, she was waiting for me ... waiting for me erect and alive,
a real, living bride ... as she hoped to be saved ...  And, when
I ... came forward, more timid than ... a little child, she did
not run away ... no, no ... she stayed ... she waited for me ... 
I even believe ... daroga ... that she put out her forehead ...
a little ... oh, not much ... just a little ...  like a living
bride ...  And ... and ... I ... kissed her! ...  I! ... I! ...
I! ... And she did not die! ... Oh, how good it is, daroga, to
kiss somebody on the forehead! ... You can't tell! ...  But I! 
I! ... My mother, daroga, my poor, unhappy mother would never
... let me kiss her ...  She used to run away ... and throw me
my mask!  ... Nor any other woman ... ever, ever! ... Ah, you
can understand, my happiness was so great, I cried.  And I fell
at her feet, crying ... and I kissed her feet ... her little feet
... crying. You're crying, too, daroga ... and she cried also
... the angel cried! ..." Erik sobbed aloud and the Persian himself
could not retain his tears in the presence of that masked man,
who, with his shoulders shaking and his hands clutched at his
chest, was moaning with pain and love by turns.</p>

<p>"Yes, daroga ... I felt her tears flow on my forehead ... on
mine, mine! ... They were soft ... they were sweet! ... They trickled
under my mask ... they mingled with my tears in my eyes ... yes
... they flowed between my lips ...  Listen, daroga, listen to
what I did ...  I tore off my mask so as not to lose one of her
tears ... and she did not run away! ... And she did not die! ... 
She remained alive, weeping over me, with me.  We cried together! 
I have tasted all the happiness the world can offer!"</p>

<p>And Erik fell into a chair, choking for breath:</p>

<p>"Ah, I am not going to die yet ... presently I shall ... but
let me cry! ... Listen, daroga ... listen to this ...  While I
was at her feet ... I heard her say, 'Poor, unhappy Erik!' ... 
<em>AND SHE TOOK MY HAND! ... I </em>had become no more, you know,
than a poor dog ready to die for her ...  I mean it, daroga! ... 
I held in my hand a ring, a plain gold ring which I had given
her ... which she had lost ... and which I had found again ... 
a wedding-ring, you know ...  I slipped it into her little hand
and said, 'There! ... Take it! ... Take it for you ... and him! 
... It shall be my wedding-present a present from your poor, unhappy
Erik ...  I know you love the boy ... don't cry any more!  ...
She asked me, in a very soft voice, what I meant ...  Then I made
her understand that, where she was concerned, I was only a poor
dog, ready to die for her ... but that she could marry the young
man when she pleased, because she had cried with me and mingled
her tears with mine! ..."</p>

<p>Erik's emotion was so great that he had to tell the Persian not
to look at him, for he was choking and must take off his mask. 
The daroga went to the window and opened it.  His heart was full
of pity, but he took care to keep his eyes fixed on the trees
in the Tuileries gardens, lest he should see the monster's face.</p>

<p>"I went and released the young man," Erik continued, "and told
him to come with me to Christine ...  They kissed before me in
the Louis-Philippe room ...  Christine had my ring ...  I made
Christine swear to come back, one night, when I was dead, crossing
the lake from the Rue-Scribe side, and bury me in the greatest
secrecy with the gold ring, which she was to wear until that moment. 
... I told her where she would find my body and what to do with
it...  Then Christine kissed me, for the first time, herself,
here, on the forehead&mdash;don't look, daroga!&mdash;here, on the forehead
... on my forehead, mine&mdash;don't look, daroga!&mdash;and they went off
together...  Christine had stopped crying ...  I alone cried ... 
Daroga, daroga, if Christine keeps her promise, she will come
back soon! ..."</p>

<p>The Persian asked him no questions.  He was quite reassured as
to the fate of Raoul Chagny and Christine Daae; no one could have
doubted the word of the weeping Erik that night.</p>

<p>The monster resumed his mask and collected his strength to leave
the daroga.  He told him that, when he felt his end to be very
near at hand, he would send him, in gratitude for the kindness
which the Persian had once shown him, that which he held dearest
in the world: all Christine Daae's papers, which she had written
for Raoul's benefit and left with Erik, together with a few objects
belonging to her, such as a pair of gloves, a shoe-buckle and
two pocket-handkerchiefs. In reply to the Persian's questions,
Erik told him that the two young people, at soon as they found
themselves free, had resolved to go and look for a priest in some
lonely spot where they could hide their happiness and that, with
this object in view, they had started from "the northern railway
station of the world."  Lastly, Erik relied on the Persian, as
soon as he received the promised relics and papers, to inform
the young couple of his death and to advertise it in the <em>EPOQUE</em>.</p>

<p>That was all.  The Persian saw Erik to the door of his flat,
and Darius helped him down to the street.  A cab was waiting for
him.  Erik stepped in; and the Persian, who had gone back to the
window, heard him say to the driver:</p>

<p>"Go to the Opera."</p>

<p>And the cab drove off into the night.</p>

<p>The Persian had seen the poor, unfortunate Erik for the last
time. Three weeks later, the Epoque published this advertisement:</p>

<p>"Erik is dead."</p>

<p>Epilogue.</p>

<p>I have now told the singular, but veracious story of the Opera
ghost. As I declared on the first page of this work, it is no
longer possible to deny that Erik really lived.  There are to-day
so many proofs of his existence within the reach of everybody
that we can follow Erik's actions logically through the whole
tragedy of the Chagnys.</p>

<p>There is no need to repeat here how greatly the case excited
the capital.  The kidnapping of the artist, the death of the Comte
de Chagny under such exceptional conditions, the disappearance
of his brother, the drugging of the gas-man at the Opera and of
his two assistants: what tragedies, what passions, what crimes
had surrounded the idyll of Raoul and the sweet and charming Christine!
... What had become of that wonderful, mysterious artist of whom
the world was never, never to hear again? ... She was represented
as the victim of a rivalry between the two brothers; and nobody
suspected what had really happened, nobody understood that, as
Raoul and Christine had both disappeared, both had withdrawn far
from the world to enjoy a happiness which they would not have
cared to make public after the inexplicable death of Count Philippe
...  They took the train one day from "the northern railway station
of the world." ... Possibly, I too shall take the train at that
station, one day, and go and seek around thy lakes, O Norway,
O silent Scandinavia, for the perhaps still living traces of Raoul
and Christine and also of Mamma Valerius, who disappeared at the
same time! ... Possibly, some day, I shall hear the lonely echoes
of the North repeat the singing of her who knew the Angel of Music!
...</p>

<p>Long after the case was pigeonholed by the unintelligent care
of M. le Juge d'Instruction Faure, the newspapers made efforts,
at intervals, to fathom the mystery.  One evening paper alone,
which knew all the gossip of the theaters, said:</p>

<p>"We recognize the touch of the Opera ghost."</p>

<p>And even that was written by way of irony.</p>

<p>The Persian alone knew the whole truth and held the main proofs,
which came to him with the pious relics promised by the ghost. 
It fell to my lot to complete those proofs with the aid of the
daroga himself.  Day by day, I kept him informed of the progress
of my inquiries; and he directed them.  He had not been to the
Opera for years and years, but he had preserved the most accurate
recollection of the building, and there was no better guide than
he possible to help me discover its most secret recesses.  He
also told me where to gather further information, whom to ask;
and he sent me to call on M. Poligny, at a moment when the poor
man was nearly drawing his last breath.  I had no idea that he
was so very ill, and I shall never forget the effect which my
questions about the ghost produced upon him.  He looked at me
as if I were the devil and answered only in a few incoherent sentences,
which showed, however&mdash;and that was the main thing&mdash;the extent
of the perturbation which O. G., in his time, had brought into
that already very restless life (for M. Poligny was what people
call a man of pleasure).</p>

<p>When I came and told the Persian of the poor result of my visit
to M. Poligny, the daroga gave a faint smile and said:</p>

<p>"Poligny never knew how far that extraordinary blackguard of
an Erik humbugged him." &mdash;The Persian, by the way, spoke
of Erik sometimes as a demigod and sometimes as the lowest of
the low&mdash;"Poligny was superstitious and Erik knew it.  Erik knew
most things about the public and private affairs of the Opera. 
When M. Poligny heard a mysterious voice tell him, in Box Five,
of the manner in which he used to spend his time and abuse his
partner's confidence, he did not wait to hear any more.  Thinking
at first that it was a voice from Heaven, he believed himself
damned; and then, when the voice began to ask for money, he saw
that he was being victimized by a shrewd blackmailer to whom Debienne
himself had fallen a prey.  Both of them, already tired of management
for various reasons, went away without trying to investigate further
into the personality of that curious O. G., who had forced such
a singular memorandum-book upon them.  They bequeathed the whole
mystery to their successors and heaved a sigh of relief when they
were rid of a business that had puzzled them without amusing them
in the least."</p>

<p>I then spoke of the two successors and expressed my surprise
that, in his Memoirs of a Manager, M. Moncharmin should describe
the Opera ghost's behavior at such length in the first part of
the book and hardly mention it at all in the second.  In reply
to this, the Persian, who knew the <em>MEMOIRS </em>as thoroughly
as if he had written them himself, observed that I should find
the explanation of the whole business if I would just recollect
the few lines which Moncharmin devotes to the ghost in the second
part aforesaid.  I quote these lines, which are particularly interesting
because they describe the very simple manner in which the famous
incident of the twenty-thousand francs was closed:</p>

<p>"As for O. G., some of whose curious tricks I have related in
the first part of my Memoirs, I will only say that he redeemed
by one spontaneous fine action all the worry which he had caused
my dear friend and partner and, I am bound to say, myself.  He
felt, no doubt, that there are limits to a joke, especially when
it is so expensive and when the commissary of police has been
informed, for, at the moment when we had made an appointment in
our office with M. Mifroid to tell him the whole story, a few
days after the disappearance of Christine Daae, we found, on Richard's
table, a large envelope, inscribed, in red ink, "<em>WITH O. G.'S
COMPLIMENTS."  </em>It contained the large sum of money which
he had succeeded in playfully extracting, for the time being,
from the treasury.  Richard was at once of the opinion that we
must be content with that and drop the business.  I agreed with
Richard.  All's well that ends well.  What do you say, O. G.?"</p>

<p>Of course, Moncharmin, especially after the money had been restored,
continued to believe that he had, for a short while, been the
butt of Richard's sense of humor, whereas Richard, on his side,
was convinced that Moncharmin had amused himself by inventing
the whole of the affair of the Opera ghost, in order to revenge
himself for a few jokes.</p>

<p>I asked the Persian to tell me by what trick the ghost had taken
twenty-thousand francs from Richard's pocket in spite of the safety-pin.
He replied that he had not gone into this little detail, but that,
if I myself cared to make an investigation on the spot, I should
certainly find the solution to the riddle in the managers' office
by remembering that Erik had not been nicknamed the trap-door
lover for nothing.  I promised the Persian to do so as soon as
I had time, and I may as well tell the reader at once that the
results of my investigation were perfectly satisfactory; and I
hardly believed that I should ever discover so many undeniable
proofs of the authenticity of the feats ascribed to the ghost.</p>

<p>The Persian's manuscript, Christine Daae's papers, the statements
made to me by the people who used to work under <em>MM. </em>Richard
and Moncharmin, by little Meg herself (the worthy Madame Giry,
I am sorry to say, is no more) and by Sorelli, who is now living
in retirement at Louveciennes: all the documents relating to the
existence of the ghost, which I propose to deposit in the archives
of the Opera, have been checked and confirmed by a number of important
discoveries of which I am justly proud.  I have not been able
to find the house on the lake, Erik having blocked up all the
secret entrances.[1]  On the other hand, I have discovered the
secret passage of the Communists, the planking of which is falling
to pieces in parts, and also the trap-door through which Raoul
and the Persian penetrated into the cellars of the opera-house.
In the Communists' dungeon, I noticed numbers of initials traced
on the walls by the unfortunate people confined in it; and among
these were an "R" and a "C." R. C.: Raoul de Chagny.  The letters
are there to this day.</p>

<p>If the reader will visit the Opera one morning and ask leave
to stroll where he pleases, without being accompanied by a stupid
guide, let him go to Box Five and knock with his fist or stick
on the enormous column that separates this from the stage-box.
He will find that the column sounds hollow.  After that, do not
be astonished by the suggestion that it was occupied by the voice
of the ghost:  there is room inside the column for two men.  If
you are surprised that, when the various incidents occurred, no
one turned round to look at the column, you must remember that
it presented the appearance of solid marble, and that the voice
contained in it seemed rather to come from the opposite side,
for, as we have seen, the ghost was an expert ventriloquist.</p>

<p>The column was elaborately carved and decorated with the sculptor's
chisel; and I do not despair of one day discovering the ornament
that could be raised or lowered at will, so as to admit of the
ghost's mysterious correspondence with Mme. Giry and of his generosity.</p>

<p>However, all these discoveries are nothing, to my mind, compared
with that which I was able to make, in the presence of the acting-manager,
in the managers' office, within a couple of inches from the desk-chair,
and which consisted of a trap-door, the width of a board in the
flooring and the length of a man's fore-arm and no longer; a trap-door
that falls back like the lid of a box; a trap-door through which
I can see a hand come and dexterously fumble at the pocket of
a swallow-tail coat.</p>

<p>That is the way the forty-thousand francs went! ...  And that
also is the way by which, through some trick or other, they were
returned.</p>

<p>Speaking about this to the Persian, I said:</p>

<p>"So we may take it, as the forty-thousand francs were returned,
that Erik was simply amusing himself with that memorandum-book
of his?"</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it!" he replied.  "Erik wanted money.  Thinking
himself without the pale of humanity, he was restrained by no
scruples and he employed his extraordinary gifts of dexterity
and imagination, which he had received by way of compensation
for his extraordinary uglinesss, to prey upon his fellow-men.
His reason for restoring the forty-thousand francs, of his own
accord, was that he no longer wanted it.  He had relinquished
his marriage with Christine Daae.  He had relinquished everything
above the surface of the earth."</p>

<p>According to the Persian's account, Erik was born in a small
town not far from Rouen.  He was the son of a master-mason. He
ran away at an early age from his father's house, where his ugliness
was a subject of horror and terror to his parents.  For a time,
he frequented the fairs, where a showman exhibited him as the
"living corpse." He seems to have crossed the whole of Europe,
from fair to fair, and to have completed his strange education
as an artist and magician at the very fountain-head of art and
magic, among the Gipsies.  A period of Erik's life remained quite
obscure.  He was seen at the fair of Nijni-Novgorod, where he
displayed himself in all his hideous glory. He already sang as
nobody on this earth had ever sung before; he practised ventriloquism
and gave displays of legerdemain so extraordinary that the caravans
returning to Asia talked about it during the whole length of their
journey.  In this way, his reputation penetrated the walls of
the palace at Mazenderan, where the little sultana, the favorite
of the Shah-in-Shah, was boring herself to death. A dealer in
furs, returning to Samarkand from Nijni-Novgorod, told of the
marvels which he had seen performed in Erik's tent.  The trader
was summoned to the palace and the daroga of Mazenderan was told
to question him.  Next the daroga was instructed to go and find
Erik.  He brought him to Persia, where for some months Erik's
will was law.  He was guilty of not a few horrors, for he seemed
not to know the difference between good and evil.  He took part
calmly in a number of political assassinations; and he turned
his diabolical inventive powers against the Emir of Afghanistan,
who was at war with the Persian empire.  The Shah took a liking
to him.</p>

<p>This was the time of the rosy hours of Mazenderan, of which the
daroga's narrative has given us a glimpse.  Erik had very original
ideas on the subject of architecture and thought out a palace
much as a conjuror contrives a trick-casket. The Shah ordered
him to construct an edifice of this kind.  Erik did so; and the
building appears to have been so ingenious that His Majesty was
able to move about in it unseen and to disappear without a possibility
of the trick's being discovered. When the Shah-in-Shah found himself
the possessor of this gem, he ordered Erik's yellow eyes to be
put out.  But he reflected that, even when blind, Erik would still
be able to build so remarkable a house for another sovereign;
and also that, as long as Erik was alive, some one would know
the secret of the wonderful palace.  Erik's death was decided
upon, together with that of all the laborers who had worked under
his orders.  The execution of this abominable decree devolved
upon the daroga of Mazenderan.  Erik had shown him some slight
services and procured him many a hearty laugh.  He saved Erik
by providing him with the means of escape, but nearly paid with
his head for his generous indulgence.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the daroga, a corpse, half-eaten by the birds
of prey, was found on the shore of the Caspian Sea, and was taken
for Erik's body, because the daroga's friends had dressed the
remains in clothing that belonged to Erik.  The daroga was let
off with the loss of the imperial favor, the confiscation of his
property and an order of perpetual banishment.  As a member of
the Royal House, however, he continued to receive a monthly pension
of a few hundred francs from the Persian treasury; and on this
he came to live in Paris.</p>

<p>As for Erik, he went to Asia Minor and thence to Constantinople,
where he entered the Sultan's employment.  In explanation of the
services which he was able to render a monarch haunted by perpetual
terrors, I need only say that it was Erik who constructed all
the famous trap-doors and secret chambers and mysterious strong-boxes
which were found at Yildiz-Kiosk after the last Turkish revolution. 
He also invented those automata, dressed like the Sultan and resembling
the Sultan in all respects,[2] which made people believe that
the Commander of the Faithful was awake at one place, when, in
reality, he was asleep elsewhere.</p>

<p>Of course, he had to leave the Sultan's service for the same
reasons that made him fly from Persia:  he knew too much.  Then,
tired of his adventurous, formidable and monstrous life, he longed
to be some one "like everybody else."  And he became a contractor,
like any ordinary contractor, building ordinary houses with ordinary
bricks.  He tendered for part of the foundations in the Opera. 
His estimate was accepted. When he found himself in the cellars
of the enormous playhouse, his artistic, fantastic, wizard nature
resumed the upper hand.  Besides, was he not as ugly as ever? 
He dreamed of creating for his own use a dwelling unknown to the
rest of the earth, where he could hide from men's eyes for all
time.</p>

<p>The reader knows and guesses the rest.  It is all in keeping
with this incredible and yet veracious story.  Poor, unhappy Erik! 
Shall we pity him?  Shall we curse him?  He asked only to be "some
one," like everybody else.  But he was too ugly!  And he had to
hide his genius OR <em>USE IT TO PLAY TRICKS WITH, </em>when,
with an ordinary face, he would have been one of the most distinguished
of mankind!  He had a heart that could have held the empire of
the world; and, in the end, he had to content himself with a cellar. 
Ah, yes, we must needs pity the Opera ghost.</p>

<p>I have prayed over his mortal remains, that God might show him
mercy notwithstanding his crimes.  Yes, I am sure, quite sure
that I prayed beside his body, the other day, when they took it
from the spot where they were burying the phonographic records. 
It was his skeleton.  I did not recognize it by the ugliness of
the head, for all men are ugly when they have been dead as long
as that, but by the plain gold ring which he wore and which Christine
Daae had certainly slipped on his finger, when she came to bury
him in accordance with her promise.</p>

<p>The skeleton was lying near the little well, in the place where
the Angel of Music first held Christine Daae fainting in his trembling
arms, on the night when he carried her down to the cellars of
the opera-house.</p>

<p>And, now, what do they mean to do with that skeleton?  Surely
they will not bury it in the common grave! ... I say that the
place of the skeleton of the Opera ghost is in the archives of
the National Academy of Music.  It is no ordinary skeleton.</p>

<p>[1] Even so, I am convinced that it would be easy to reach it
by draining the lake, as I have repeatedly requested the Ministry
of Fine Arts to do.  I was speaking about it to M. Dujardin-Beaumetz,
the under-secretary for fine arts, only forty-eight hours before
the publication of this book.  Who knows but that the score of
<em>DON JUAN TRIUMPHANT </em>might yet be discovered in the house
on the lake?</p>

Salonika troops into Constantinople.</p>

<p><em>THE END</em></p>

<p>The Paris Opera House</p>

<p><em>THE SCENE OF GASTON LEROUX'S NOVEL, "THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA</em>"</p>

<p>That Mr. Leroux has used, for the scene of his story, the Paris
Opera House as it really is and has not created a building out
of his imagination, is shown by this interesting description of
it taken from an article which appeared in Scribner's Magazine
in 1879, a short time after the building was completed:</p>

<p>"The new Opera House, commenced under the Empire and finished
under the Republic, is the most complete building of the kind
in the world and in many respects the most beautiful.  No European
capital possesses an opera house so comprehensive in plan and
execution, and none can boast an edifice equally vast and splendid.</p>

<p>"The site of the Opera House was chosen in 1861.  It was determined
to lay the foundation exceptionally deep and strong.  It was well
known that water would be met with, but it was impossible to foresee
at what depth or in what quantity it would be found.  Exceptional
depth also was necessary, as the stage arrangements were to be
such as to admit a scene fifty feet high to be lowered on its
frame.  It was therefore necessary to lay a foundation in a soil
soaked with water which should be sufficiently solid to sustain
a weight of 22,000,000 pounds, and at the same time to be perfectly
dry, as the cellars were intended for the storage of scenery and
properties.  While the work was in progress, the excavation was
kept free from water by means of eight pumps, worked by steam
power, and in operation, without interruption, day and night,
from March second to October thirteenth.  The floor of the cellar
was covered with a layer of concrete, then with two coats of cement,
another layer of concrete and a coat of bitumen.  The wall includes
an outer wall built as a coffer-dam, a brick wall, a coat of cement,
and a wall proper, a little over a yard thick.  After all this
was done the whole was filled with water, in order that the fluid,
by penetrating into the most minute interstices, might deposit
a sediment which would close them more surely and perfectly than
it would be possible to do by hand.  Twelve years elapsed before
the completion of the building, and during that time it was demonstrated
that the precautions taken secured absolute impermeability and
solidity.</p>

<p>"The events of 1870 interrupted work just as it was about to
be prosecuted most vigorously, and the new Opera House was put
to new and unexpected uses.  During the siege, it was converted
into a vast military storehouse and filled with a heterogeneous
mass of goods. After the siege the building fell into the hands
of the Commune and the roof was turned into a balloon station. 
The damage done, however, was slight.</p>

<p>"The fine stone employed in the construction was brought from
quarries in Sweden, Scotland, Italy, Algeria, Finland, Spain,
Belgium and France.  While work on the exterior was in progress,
the building was covered in by a wooden shell, rendered transparent
by thousands of small panes of glass.  In 1867 a swarm of men,
supplied with hammers and axes, stripped the house of its habit,
and showed in all its splendor the great structure.  No picture
can do justice to the rich colors of the edifice or to the harmonious
tone resulting from the skilful use of many diverse materials. 
The effect of the frontage is completed by the cupola of the auditorium,
topped with a cap of bronze sparingly adorned with gilding.  Farther
on, on a level with the towers of Notre-Dame, is the gable end
of the roof of the stage, a 'Pegasus', by M. Lequesne, rising
at either end of the roof, and a bronze group by M. Millet, representing
'Apollo lifting his golden lyre', commanding the apex.  Apollo,
it may here be mentioned, is useful as well as ornamental, for
his lyre is tipped with a metal point which does duty as a lightning-rod,
and conducts the fluid to the body and down the nether limbs of
the god.</p>

<p>"The spectator, having climbed ten steps and left behind him
a gateway, reaches a vestibule in which are statues of Lully,
Rameau, Gluck, and Handel.  Ten steps of green Swedish marble
lead to a second vestibule for ticket-sellers. Visitors who enter
by the pavilion reserved for carriages pass through a hallway
where ticket offices are situated. The larger number of the audience,
before entering the auditorium, traverse a large circular vestibule
located exactly beneath it.  The ceiling of this portion of the
building is upheld by sixteen fluted columns of Jura stone, with
white marble capitals, forming a portico. Here servants are to
await their masters, and spectators may remain until their carriages
are summoned.  The third entrance, which is quite distinct from
the others, is reserved for the Executive.  The section of the
building set aside for the use of the Emperor Napoleon was to
have included an antechamber for the bodyguards; a salon for the
aides-de-camp; a large salon and a smaller one for the Empress;
hat and cloak rooms, etc.  Moreover, there were to be in close
proximity to the entrance, stables for three coaches, for the
outriders' horses, and for the twenty-one horsemen acting as an
escort; a station for a squad of infantry of thirty-one men and
ten cent-gardes, and a stable for the horses of the latter; and,
besides, a salon for fifteen or twenty domestics.  Thus arrangements
had to be made to accommodate in this part of the building about
one hundred persons, fifty horses, and half-a-dozen carriages. 
The fall of the Empire suggested some changes, but ample provision
still exists for emergencies.</p>

<p>"Its novel conception, perfect fitness, and rare splendor of
material, make the grand stairway unquestionably one of the most
remarkable features of the building.  It presents to the spectator,
who has just passed through the subscribers' pavilion, a gorgeous
picture.  From this point he beholds the ceiling formed by the
central landing; this and the columns sustaining it, built of
Echaillon stone, are honeycombed with arabesques and heavy with
ornaments; the steps are of white marble, and antique red marble
balusters rest on green marble sockets and support a balustrade
of onyx.  To the right and to the left of this landing are stairways
to the floor, on a plane with the first row of boxes.  On this
floor stand thirty monolith columns of Sarrancolin marble, with
white marble bases and capitals.  Pilasters of peach-blossom and
violet stone are against the corresponding walls. More than fifty
blocks had to be extracted from the quarry to find thirty perfect
monoliths.</p>

<p>"The foyer de la danse has particular interest for the habitues
of the Opera.  It is a place of reunion to which subscribers to
three performances a week are admitted between the acts in accordance
with a usage established in 1870.  Three immense looking-glasses
cover the back wall of the <em>FOYER, </em>and a chandelier with
one hundred and seven burners supplies it with light.  The paintings
include twenty oval medallions, in which are portrayed the twenty
danseuses of most celebrity since the opera has existed in France,
and four panels by M. Boulanger, typifying 'The War Dance', 'The
Rustic Dance', 'The Dance of Love' and 'The Bacchic Dance.' While
the ladies of the ballet receive their admirers in this foyer,
they can practise their steps. Velvet-cushioned bars have to this
end been secured at convenient points, and the floor has been
given the same slope as that of the stage, so that the labor expended
may be thoroughly profitable to the performance. The singers'
foyer, on the same floor, is a much less lively resort than the
foyer de la danse, as vocalists rarely leave their dressing-rooms
before they are summoned to the stage.  Thirty panels with portraits
of the artists of repute in the annals of the Opera adorn this
foyer.</p>

<p>"Some estimate ... may be arrived at by sitting before the concierge
an hour or so before the representation commences.  First appear
the stage carpenters, who are always seventy, and sometimes, when
L'Africaine, for example, with its ship scene, is the opera, one
hundred and ten strong.  Then come stage upholsterers, whose sole
duty is to lay carpets, hang curtains, etc.; gas-men, and a squad
of firemen. Claqueurs, call-boys, property-men, dressers, coiffeurs,
supernumeraries, and artists, follow.  The supernumeraries number
about one hundred; some are hired by the year, but the 'masses'
are generally recruited at the last minute and are generally working-men
who seek to add to their meagre earnings.  There are about a hundred
choristers, and about eighty musicians.</p>

<p>"Next we behold equeries, whose horses are hoisted on the stage
by means of an elevator; electricians who manage the light-producing
batteries; hydrauliciens to take charge of the water-works in
ballets like La Source; artificers who prepare the conflagration
in Le Profeta; florists who make ready Margarita's garden, and
a host of minor employees.  This personnel is provided for as
follows:  Eighty dressing-rooms are reserved for the artists,
each including a small antechamber, the dressing-room proper,
and a little closet.  Besides these apartments, the Opera has
a dressing-room for sixty male, and another for fifty female choristers;
a third for thirty-four male dancers; four dressing-rooms for
twenty female dancers of different grades; a dressing-room for
one hundred and ninety supernumeraries, etc."</p>

<p>A few figures taken from the article will suggest the enormous
capacity and the perfect convenience of the house.  "There are
2,531 doors and 7,593 keys; 14 furnaces and grates heat the house;
the gaspipes if connected would form a pipe almost 16 miles long;
9 reservoirs, and two tanks hold 22,222 gallons of water and distribute
their contents through 22,829 2-5 feet of piping; 538 persons
have places assigned wherein to change their attire.  The musicians
have a foyer with 100 closets for their instruments."</p>

<p>The author remarks of his visit to the Opera House that it "was
almost as bewildering as it was agreeable.  Giant stairways and
colossal halls, huge frescoes and enormous mirrors, gold and marble,
satin and velvet, met the eye at every turn."</p>

<p>In a recent letter Mr. Andre Castaigne, whose remarkable pictures
illustrate the text, speaks of a river or lake under the Opera
House and mentions the fact that there are now also three metropolitan
railway tunnels, one on top of the other.</p>
