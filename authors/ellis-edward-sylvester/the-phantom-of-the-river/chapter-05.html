<p>It will be borne in mind that Kenton had approached the clearing
from the east, or up the river, so that it was necessary to cross
the open space to reach the spot where the silent flatboat rested
against the bank, and near which he expected to find the canoe,
so necessary in the plan he had formed for saving the settlers
and their families.</p>

<p>To start across this clear space was too risky a proceeding for
so guarded a woodsman as he. If any of his enemies were on the
other side, where he meant to look for the smaller boat, the ranger
was certain to be detected. His plan, therefore, was to pass around
the clearing by entering the woods and moving to the rear. This
he set out to do upon parting from Jethro Juggens.</p>

<p>He had not yet passed from sight among the trees when his steps
were arrested by a vigorous "St! st!"</p>

<p>Well aware of the point whence it came, he turned impatiently
around, took a couple of steps toward his dusky companion, and
demanded in an undertone:</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Yo' tole me not to speak or move or breve; if I don't speak
or move, can't you let up on de breving bus'ness? I'm afraid it's
gwine to bodder me to shet off breving."</p>

<p>"All right, so you don't forget to stay right where you are till
I come back."</p>

<p>Kenton resumed his advance, keeping out of sight in the woods,
until he had skirted three sides of the clearing and approached
the river again, opposite the point where he had first halted
with his companion, and failed to see the canoe.</p>

<p>As yet it was an absolute mystery as to what had become of the
lesser boat. A half-dozen causes might account for its disappearance.
It might have been set adrift by one of the Shawanoes, or captured
and paddled across the river, or destroyed, or&mdash;</p>

<p>At that moment the figure of a sinewy Shawanoe shot up to view,
as if from a jumping-box. He was near the canoe, but between it
and Kenton, and so close, indeed, that but for the fact that his
face was turned toward the river, he must have discovered the
white man.</p>

<p>Kenton's heart gave a quick throb, for something in the shoulders,
the back of the head and contour of the body suggested that the
Indian was his old enemy, Wa-on-mon, The Panther.</p>

<p>"If it's the varmint himself," thought Kenton, "him and me can
just as well have it now, even if there are others of his people
not fur off."</p>

<p>Either the Indian did not see that on the river for which he
was searching, or the view was satisfactory, for he now turned
and looked toward the cabin. This brought his face into full view,
and the glimpse which the white man caught from a peep around
the edge of the bark showed the warrior to be a stranger.</p>

<p>Kenton's position enabled him to see the log cabin as clearly
as did the Shawanoe, but it was impossible to detect anything
to justify his interest in the building. The situation had become
so peculiar that all the sagacity of the ranger was insufficient
for him to decide upon the best course to pursue.</p>

<p>Five, ten, fifteen minutes passed, during which the warrior,
sitting on the ground, with his back against the tree, remained
as motionless as did The Panther, when a prisoner the night before
on the flatboat.</p>

<p>"I'm blessed if I don't believe he's asleep," mused Kenton.</p>

<p>Nothing is easier than for a person to pretend unconsciousness,
but in this case the white man could think of no reason for the
red man doing that.</p>

<p>"Shod with silence," as Simon Kenton or his brothers were when
threading their way among the forest shadows, he stepped from
behind the tree and began moving toward the long, graceful canoe,
whose nose rested against the bank.</p>

<p>His course took him near the Shawanoe, and he paused while yet
several paces to the rear. The hostile was at his mercy. He could
drive the life from his body with lightning-like suddenness.</p>

<p>"That isn't the way for a Christian to fight," concluded Kenton,
making such an abrupt change in his course that the distance between
the two was increased.</p>

<p>The pose of the Indian was the natural one of a sleeper. His
back being against the trunk of a tree, his knees were drawn up,
with his arms resting upon them. His long rifle reclined against
the same support as his body, his knife and tomahawk were in place
in the girdle around the waist of his half-naked person, his head
was sunk, with the chin resting on his chest, and his coarse,
black hair dangling in front or behind his shoulders.</p>

<p>As he sat thus, his face was turned partly away from the canoe.
Kenton's course took him past the sleeper, whose eyes, as he noted,
were closed. All doubt of his being unconscious were removed,
since no reason was conceivable for any pretence on his part.</p>

<p>Fortune held the promise of a rare and remarkable triumph. It
has been said that the canoe rested so lightly against the banks
that only a very slight force was required to release and let
it float down stream.</p>

<p>If, therefore, the Shawanoe should awake and note its absence,
he would conclude that it was due to the action of the current,
a conclusion that could not be formulated in the event of his
rifle keeping it company. Following the suggestion of such a theory,
the Shawanoe, in seeking to recover the boat, would look down
instead of up stream for it.</p>

<p>With these reasons, therefore, swaying him, Kenton put past him
all inclination to trifle with a sleeping sentinel, and with only
a momentary pause stepped forward until he laid his hand on the
arching prow of the canoe, which was the same as the stern.</p>

<p>The long two-bladed paddle lay in the bottom, just as he himself
had laid it after rowing ashore with The Panther. Everything was
ready, but the hardest test of all now confronted the scout, who
had performed his part thus far with a consummate skill that could
not be surpassed.</p>

<p>Keeping his gaze upon his enemy, he dipped one end of the paddle
in the water, and, with the same noiselessness as before, sent
the boat up the stream and across the clear space at the foot
of the clearing.</p>

<p>Something like assurance came to him when he drove it beneath
the overhanging limbs and stepped ashore for Jethro Juggens. Knowing
the precise spot where he had left him, he hurried thither without
losing a second. But the fellow was gone.</p>

<p>"Sarved me right for bringing him along!" muttered the angry
Kenton, "but what can have become of the younker?"</p>

<p>Well, indeed, might he ask the question.</p>
