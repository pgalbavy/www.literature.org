<p>Nearly a thousand years ago, in the year of our Lord 871, the
great battle of Ashdown was fought; but, in order to give you
a true idea of its importance, I must begin my story some years
earlier; that is to say, in the year of our Lord 866. In this
year Æthelbert, king of the West Saxons, died, having ruled his
kingdom for five years in peace, with the love of his subjects;
and Æthelred, his next brother, who succeeded him, buried his
body in Sherborne Minster. In this year Alfred, the younger brother,
who afterwards succeeded Æthelred, and was called Alfred the Great,
reached his seventeenth year. In the autumn a great army of pagan
Danes came over to Britain, and landed in that part of the island
which was then called East Anglia, but now Norfolk. These were
not the first Danes who had come over to vex England, but none
of them ever stayed so long, fought so many battles, or did so
much harm (as we should say, speaking according to man’s judgment)
as these.</p>

<p>A very curious story is told of why they came over here; and
as it goes at first sight against a good many of our notions of
how the world is governed, and so ought to make us think a little
more about the matter, I shall give it you pretty much as it is
told by the old chronicler, John Brompton.</p>

<p>"There was a man of royal birth in the kingdom of Denmark, named
Lodbroc, who had two sons, Hinguar and Hubba. This man embarked
one day with his hawk in a small boat to catch ducks, and other
wild-fowl on the adjoining sea-coasts and islands. A terrible
storm arose, by which Lodbroc was carried away and tossed for
several days on every part of the ocean. After numberless perils,
he was cast ashore on the coast of Norfolk, near the village of
Redham," (at least that must be the name, as I read it in Brompton,
though I have not been able to hear of a village of that name
on the coast of Norfolk,) "where he was found having his hawk
alone for his companion, and presented to King Edmund. That king,
struck with the manliness of his form, kept him at his court,
and heard from his own mouth the history of his adventures. He
was then associated with Berne, the king’s huntsman, and indulged
in all the pleasures of the chase, for in the exercise of both
hunting and hawking he was remarkably skilful, and succeeded in
capturing both birds and beasts according as he had a mind." In
fact, Lodbroc was the sort of man to please King Edmund, for the
art of capturing birds and beasts was, next to the art of fighting
for one’s home and country, the art most esteemed amongst the
Anglo-Saxons; who acknowledged "that skill and good fortune in
this art, as in all others, are among the gifts of God, as we
also have often witnessed." But to go on with our story. "The
skill of Lodbroc bred jealousy in the heart of Berne the huntsman,
who one day, as they went out together hunting, unawares set upon
Lodbroc, and having foully slain him, buried his body in the thickets
of the forest. But Lodbroc had a small harrier dog, which he had
bred up from its birth, and which loved him much. While Berne
the huntsman went home with the other hounds, this little dog
remained alone with his master’s body. In the morning, the king
asked what had become of Lodbroc, to which Berne answered that
he had parted from him yesterday in the woods, and had not seen
him since. At that moment the harrier came into the hall and went
round wagging its tail, and fawning on the whole company, but
especially on the king; when he had eaten his fill, he again left
the hall. This happened often; until some one at last followed
the dog to see where he went, and having found the body of the
murdered Lodbroc, came and told the story to the king. The affair
was now carefully inquired into, and when the truth was at last
found out, the huntsman was exposed on the sea, without oars,
in the boat which had belonged to Lodbroc. In some days, he was
cast ashore in Denmark, and brought before the sons of Lodbroc;
who, putting him to the torture, inquired of him what had become
of their father, to whom they knew the boat belonged. To this
Berne answered," as one might have guessed he would answer, he
being a liar and cowardly murderer, "that their father Lodbroc
had fallen into the hands of Edmund, King of East Anglia, by whose
orders he had been put to death." Now, King Edmund was a wise
and righteous man, who "devoutly undertook the government of the
East Angles, and held it with the right hand of power, always
adoring and glorifying God for all the good things which he enjoyed;"[3]
and it is a pity he did not on this occasion remember, that having
safely caught a great scoundrel, the best thing to do with him
was to see him hung out of the way himself; for, by letting him
go, you see, he gave a chance to the devil, who can’t afford to
lose such gentlemen as Berne the huntsman out of the world, and
has considerable grudges against kings like Edmund.</p>

<p>Well, when Hinguar and Hubba heard the tale of Berne the huntsman,
they, like good and true sons, according to the notions of piety
then current amongst the Danes, hastened to fit out a fleet to
invade England, and avenge their father. And their three sisters
wove for them the standard, called the Raven, in one day&mdash;which
flag waved over many a bloody field, from Northumbria to Devonshire,
until it was taken by King Alfred’s men, under Odda, the Alderman
of Devon, before a certain castle in that county, which is called
Cynuit by Asser, and Kenuith elsewhere, (the situation of which
castle I cannot identify, or the name,) where were slain King
Halfdene, a brother of Hinguar and Hubba, and 840 Danish warriors.
It was said, that when the Danes were about to gain a battle,
a live crow would fly before the middle of the standard; but if
they were to be beaten, it would hang motionless.[4]</p>

<p>So Hinguar and Hubba, as has been said, landed in the country
of the East Angles, in the late autumn, bent on vengeance. King
Edmund knew nothing of the blood-feud between him and these Danish
leaders, by reason of Berne’s lying story, so took no more than
the usual measures for preparing to attack them; but whether it
was that they found King Edmund too strong for them at the time,
or for some other reason, they seem to have wintered there quietly,
and to have bought horses, and made some sort of truce with the
East Angles.[5] But in the spring of the year 867, they crossed
the Humber, marched hastily upon York, and took it.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Northumbria was just the place for the army of
Pagans and the standard Raven at this time; for it was divided
against itself. Osbert, the rightful king, had been playing Tarquin
in the house of Bruern Brocard, one of his chief earls; so his
people had cast him out, and had taken to themselves a king Ælla,
of unkingly blood, and the two were warring against one another
when the Danes took York. Late in the autumn, however, a peace
was made between Osbert and Ælla, and they marched to York; where
within the very walls of the city into which the Northumbrians
penetrated, was fought a most bloody battle. In that fight fell
almost all the Northumbrian warriors, and both the kings, and
a multitude of noble men; and the remainder who escaped made peace
with the Pagans.[6] By this time, no doubt, there was small spoil
left for Hinguar and Hubba north of the Humber.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in the year 868, the pagan army, leaving Northumbria,
marched into Mercia, and surprised and took Nottingham. Then Burhred,
King of Mercia, and his witan sent to Æthelred, king of the West
Saxons, to come and help them. And Æthelred and Alfred marched
to Nottingham with the West Saxon power, and with Burhred besieged
the Pagans, there; but they could not force the wall, and there
was no great battle, and Æthelred and Alfred went home with their
troops. But the Pagans, after wintering at Nottingham, made peace
with Burhred and the Mercians; that is to say, such a peace as
they loved to make &mdash;I mean a peace till it was worth their
while to come again; for in 874 they came back, drove King Burhred
over the sea, and subdued the whole country&mdash;and Burhred went
to Rome and died there, and his body lies in St. Mary’s Church
at the English School.[7]</p>

<p>In the year 869, "the aforesaid army of Pagans, galloping back
to Northumbria, went to York, and there passed the winter;" or,
in the words of Huntingdon, "remained there cruelly for one year."
And what sort of a winter was it for the poor Yorkshiremen? "There
was again a great famine, a mortality among men, and a pest among
cattle." Such is the fate of a divided people which can only make
truces with its oppressors.</p>

<p>In this winter, Hinguar and Hubba seem to have got large reinforcements
from over the sea, headed by two other kings, Bægseeg and Halfdene
their brother, for in the year 870 we find them no longer surprising
a city, and from thence defying their enemies and oppressing the
neighbourhood. Now they march openly and fearlessly across Mercia;
and, the day of vengeance having come, burst upon East Anglia,
and take up their head-quarters at Thetford. And then comes the
saddest part of a sad story. King Edmund, being a king like Josiah,
who believed in God and ruled in righteousness, was not the man
to see the desolation of any part of his people, or to shut himself
up in fenced cities while the pagan cavalry rode through East
Anglia&mdash;so the aforesaid King Edmund gathered his men, and "fought
fiercely and manfully against the army. But because the merciful
God foreknew that he was to arrive at the crown of martyrdom,
he there fell gloriously. Of his passion I would fain insert some
particulars into our history, that the sons of men may know and
perceive how terrible is Christ the Son of God in the counsels
of men, and with what glorious triumph he adorns those whom he
tries here under the name of suffering, that the saying may be
fulfilled, ‘He is not crowned except he strive lawfully.’ (2 Tim.
ii. 5.)"[8] Such is the lesson which the old monk Simeon, præcentor
of the Church of Durham, gets out of the death and martyrdom of
King Edmund, and I know not where we are to look for a better.
Perhaps it may help us when we think of India[9] to remember with
Simeon, how terrible is Christ the Son of God in the counsels
of men, and with what glorious triumph he adorns those whom he
tries here under the name of suffering. For Hinguar and Hubba
took the wounded king on the field of battle, and tied him to
a tree, because he chose to die sooner than give over his people
to them, and there shot him through the body with their arrows.[10]
But his people got the body and buried it at Bradoriesunyrthe,
now called St. Edmund’s Bury, or Bury St. Edmunds;[11] and many
miracles were wrought at his tomb, and he was canonized&mdash;at which
honour let all Englishmen rejoice, the earth having as much need
as ever of many such kings and saints.</p>

<p>And they were rare then as now, and then as now men went their
own way, and not God’s way, and cut out their own work instead
of taking his. For "when King Edmund was slain, his brother Edwold,
dreading the pleasures of the world, and seeing that a hard lot
had fallen on himself and his brother, retired to the monastery
of Carnelia in Dorsetshire, near a clear well which St. Augustine
had formerly brought out of the earth by prayer, to baptize the
people in, and there he led a hermit’s life on only bread and
water."[12] Yes! and no doubt thought himself righteous and despised
others&mdash;and left the kingdom which God had given him to the Pagans,
who "subdued all the land and destroyed all the ministers they
came to," which Edmund his brother had built&mdash;"and that same time
they came to Medeshamstede, and burned and beat it down, slew
abbot and monks, and all that place which before was full rich,
they reduced to nothing,"[13] while Edwold, who should have been
there with the remnant of the East Angles, to make his last stand,
like a true shepherd of his people, was eating his bread and drinking
his water in peace, by a clear well near the monastery of Carnelia
in Dorsetshire.</p>

<p>And now the Pagan kings, "with a new army, very great, like a
flowing river which carries all along with it,"[14] having doubtless
been reinforced again from over the sea, where the story of their
victories had spread far and wide, were looking about for some
new field for plunder and murder. The whole north and east of
England was a desolate wilderness behind them; London was in ruins,
and Kent had been harried over and over again by their brethren
the sea-kings. But some thirty miles up the Thames was a fair
kingdom, stretching far away west, down to the distant sea. This
was Wessex, the kingdom of the West Angles, over which Æthelred,
the brother of Alfred, was now ruling, and entering on the sixth
year of his reign. The kingdom had had peace for ten years, and
was full of royal burgs, and rich pastures, with cattle and horses,
and sheep. Perhaps Hinguar and Hubba remembered the leaguer of
Nottingham three years before, and how the West Angles, with their
king and his brother, had hemmed them in and watched them there
through a long summer.</p>

<p>In the early years of their inroad, the Pagans would not have
dared to brave a united people with Æthelred for king; but they
had now grown bold from success, and were in numbers so great
that "by reason thereof they could not advance together, but went
by different roads." So in an early month of the year 871, with
their usual swiftness, they marched up the Thames valley and seized
on Reading, a royal burg, and the then easternmost city of note
in Wessex. Reading is situate on the south bank of the Thames
and on the north bank of the Kennet, at the confluence of the
two rivers; and, while part of the Pagan host made a rampart between
the rivers, to protect their camp and the town which they had
taken, a large force, on the third day after their arrival, began
scouring the country for plunder, under two of their earls.</p>

<p>But the men of Wessex had increased and multiplied as well as
their cattle, and Æthelwulf, Alderman of Berkshire, was a man
"who raged as a lion in battle." So Æthelwulf, with what men he
could get together, fought with the two earls at Englefield, though
he had but a small band of Christians with him. But he cheered
his men, saying to them, "though they attack us with the advantage
of more men we may despise them, for our commander Christ, is
braver than they."[15] Whereupon the men of Wessex buckled to
their work under the oaks of Englefield Chase (afterwards beloved
by the great Queen Bess), and there discomfited the pagans very
sore, and slew one of the two earls. In one of the old chroniclers,
there are a few lines which may partly account for Æthelwulf’s
victory; "their two consuls," says Æthelwerd, "forgetting that
they were not on board their fleet, rode proudly through fields
and meadows on horseback, which nature had denied them;" possibly
therefore these were the new comers, who had just joined the Pagan
army and were not used to horses or landfighting.</p>

<p>Within the next three days King Æthelred and his brother Alfred
came up from the west, each leading a strong band of West Saxon
warriors, and joined Æthelwulf; and on the fourth day they attacked
the Pagans at Reading. Those who were outside the rampart they
cut to pieces, and at first had the vantage; but the Pagans came
out with all their forces, and after great slaughter had been
made on either hand, and the brave Æthelwulf had been slain, "the
Pagans had possession of the place of death."[16] Thus the chronicle
states it; probably the men of Wessex were grievously beaten,
and went back with their king, in confusion, along the chalk hills
to the other end of Berkshire, pursued by Bægseeg and Halfdene,
the two lately arrived Danish kings, with the strength of the
Pagan host. I suppose that Hinguar and Hubba stayed at Reading,
to hold the place of safety; for neither of them were at Ashdown.</p>

<p>But every mile as they fell back added strength to Æthelred and
Alfred, as bands of men came up from the rear; from the broad
Wiltshire plains over the Kennet at Hungerford, and along the
chalk hills from Swindon and Ashbury; from the vales of the Kennet
and the Thames on either flank; and a few perhaps already from
Glostershire and Oxfordshire, where the news was doubtless spreading
like the wind. So Æthelred and his host turned to bay at Ashdown,
and set the battle in array against the pagan kings.</p>

<p>There is some question between antiquaries as to where the exact
site of this battle is. It must however, it seems to me, be somewhere
in the western part of Berkshire; for it is quite impossible that
Æthelred and Alfred could have fought at Reading, at Ashdown,
and at Basing, as they unquestionably did, within three weeks,
if we are to look for Ashdown battle-field either at Ashdown forest,
in Essex, or at Ashendon, in the hundred of Bernwood in Buckinghamshire,
which are the only sites out of Berkshire claiming this honour,
and supported by a tittle of authority. Besides, even supposing
these three battles could have been fought in the time, yet the
battle of Reading, having gone against the Saxons, (as to which
every chronicler agrees,) is it likely that they should have retired
<em>past</em> the town and stronghold of the Danes, either northeast
into Buckinghamshire, or southeast into Sussex, leaving the whole
of Wessex open to the enemy, instead of falling back westward
into Wessex, and so covering their own homes? It is perfectly
absurd to suppose this, Alfred being one of their generals; and
how such ancient and venerable persons as Bishops Kennet and Leland
can have talked such nonsense, is hard to say; unless, indeed,
they were born, the one in Sussex, the other in Buckinghamshire,
in which case it is of course excusable, nay, justifiable in them;
but of this I know nothing.</p>

<p>As to the Berkshire sites, I don’t see any reason for troubling
you with their several titles. I am myself satisfied that the
battle was fought here; but all the sites are somewhere on this
range of chalk hills, of which the old White Horse is king. So
now we will turn to the account of the great battle in the old
chroniclers.</p>

<p>[Illustration]</p>

<p>"About four days after the battle at Reading, King Æthelred and
Alfred, his brother, fought against the whole army of the Pagans
at Ashdown. And they were in two bodies; in the one were Bægseeg
and Halfdene the Pagan kings, and in the other were the earls."
"Now the Christians had determined that King Æthelred with his
men should attack the two Pagan kings, but that Alfred his brother
with his men, should take the chance of war against the earls.
Things being so settled, the king remained a long time in prayer,
hearing the mass, and said he would not leave it till the priest
had done, nor abandon the protection of God for that of men. And
so he did, which afterwards availed him much with the Almighty,
as we shall declare more fully in the sequel. But the Pagans came
up quickly to the fight. Then Alfred, though holding a lower authority,
as I have been told by those who were there and would not lie,
could no longer support the troops of the enemy unless he retreated
or charged upon them without waiting for his brother; so he marched
out promptly with his men in a close column and gave battle."
"He too," as Simeon says, "knowing without a doubt that victory
would not lie with a multitude of men, but in the pity and mercy
of God," and seeing also that, mass or no mass, the Pagans must
not be allowed to get between him and his brother. "But here I
must inform those who are ignorant of the fact, that the field
of battle was not equal for both armies. The Pagans occupied the
higher ground, and the Christians came up from below. There was
also in that place a single stunted thorn-tree, which I myself
have seen with my own eyes. Around this tree the opposing hosts
came together with loud shouts from all sides, the one to pursue
their wicked course, the other to fight for their lives, their
dearest ties, and their country." "In the midst of the fight,
and when Alfred was hard pressed,"&mdash;according to Brompton, for
the older chroniclers do not mention this,&mdash;"the king came up
with his fresh forces." "And when both hosts had fought long and
bravely, at last the Pagans, by God’s judgment, could no longer
bear the attack of the Christians, and having lost great part
of their men, took to a disgraceful flight, and all the Pagan
host pursued its flight not only until night, but the next day,
even until they reached the stronghold from which they had come
out. The Christians followed, slaying all they could reach until
it became dark."[17] "And the flower of the Pagan youth were there
slain, so that neither before nor since was ever such destruction
known since the Saxons first gained Britain by their arms." "There
fell in that battle King Bægseeg and these earls with him; that
old Earl Sidroc, to whom may be applied that saying ‘the ancient
of evil days,’ and Earl Sidroc the younger, and Earl Osbern, and
Earl Frœna, and Earl Harold; who, with their men, choosing the
broad and spacious way, went down into the depths of the lake;"
or, let us perhaps hope not, old monk Simeon, seeing that they
died gallantly in harness, and that, as you yourself add in the
next sentence, "they knew not the way of teaching nor understood
its paths; it was kept far away from their faces." It is fair
to add that Brompton states that Æthelred slew Bægseeg with his
spear, and another Pagan of note with his sword, after, he got
up to the fight; but the older chroniclers do not mention this.[18]</p>

<p>To finish briefly the history of the rest of the year 871, fourteen
days after the battle of Ashdown, Æthelred and Alfred fought another
battle with the Pagans (probably with that part which had remained
in garrison at Reading, with Hinguar and Hubba, and the relics
of Halfdene’s army), at Basing, which seems to have been undecided;
and two months afterwards another at Merton. After which, in the
summer, reinforcements came from beyond sea, and joined the Pagans;
King Æthelred died, and Alfred fought before the winter four more
pitched battles. So, as the Saxon Chronicle sums up, "in this
year nine general battles were fought against the army in the
kingdom south of the Thames; besides which, Alfred, the king’s
brother, and single aldermen and king’s thanes, oftentimes made
attacks on them which were not numbered, and slew of them within
the year one king and nine earls." This was not what the Pagans
reckoned on; they liked fighting very much in reason, as an accompaniment
of spoiling a country, and did it well; but to be fighting nine
pitched battles in a year, hemmed in in one corner of a rich kingdom
(for they never got farther than a few miles into Wiltshire),
and getting no spoil even there, was not to their taste; so in
the winter they made truce with Alfred, and took themselves off
to their old haunts in Mercia and Northumbria, and did not return
for five years.</p>

<p>This year, <em>A.D. 871, </em>is a year for Berkshire men to
be proud of, for on them fell the brunt of that fiery trial; and
their gallant stand probably saved England a hundred years of
Paganism. For had they given way at Ashdown, and the reinforcements
from over the sea come to a conquering, instead of to a beaten
army in the summer, there was nothing to stop the Pagans between
Reading and Exeter. The other eight battles were skirmishes in
comparison with this one; they scarcely occupy five lines each
in the chroniclers, and out of the king and nine Pagan earls who
were slain within the year, six fell at Ashdown. It was Alfred’s
crowning mercy; and so he felt it to be, and in memory of it he
caused his army (tradition says, on the day after the battle)
to carve the White Horse, the standard of Hengist, on the hill-side
just under the Castle, where it stands as you see until this day.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sir," said I, when he paused, "what a grand story
it makes! And are those the real words of the old chroniclers,
as you call them, Sir, which you used?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "almost every word is simply a translation from
one or other of them, but the greater part is taken from the Chronicle
of Asser, who was a contemporary and intimate friend of Alfred,
and a very learned and pious ecclesiastic."</p>

<p>"I suppose they were; mostly priests and monks who wrote the
Chronicles then, Sir, for they don’t read at all like our modern
histories. They seem a much more religious sort of books."</p>

<p>"Don’t call them religious books," said he, "it puts one in mind
of religious newspapers,&mdash;the greatest curse of our times. Yes,
people sneer at the old English chroniclers now-a-days, and prefer
the Edda, and all sorts of heathen stuff, to them; but they are
great books, Sir, for those who have eyes for them; godly books
is the name for them, written by God-fearing men, who were not
ashamed of the faith which was in them;&mdash;men who believed, Sir,
that a living God was ruling in England, and that in his name
one of them might defy a thousand. Your historians, now-a-days,
Sir, believe that Providence (for they dare not talk of God) is
on the side of the strongest battalion. There’s some difference,
when you come to think of it, between the two creeds, Sir."</p>

<p>The old gentleman looked at me quite fierce, so I made all the
haste I could to change the subject.</p>

<p>"Don’t you think it very curious, Sir, that the figure should
have lasted all this time?" said I; "because you see, Sir, if
you or I were to cut a trench, two feet or so deep, up here, on
the side of the hill, and stamp down the chalk ever so hard, it
would be all filled up and grown over in a few years."</p>

<p>"You are not the first person who has made that remark," said
he. "In the year 1738, an antiquary, of the name of Francis Wise,
who lived at Oxford, visited the hill, and wrote a letter on the
subject to Dr. Mead, the most learned antiquary of that day. First
he speaks of the figure of the horse as ‘being described in so
masterly a manner that it may defy the painter’s skill to give
a more exact description of the animal.’"</p>

<p>"How could he talk like that, Sir?" said I; "why the figure isn’t
a bit like&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You are as bad as Camden," said he, "who talks of I know not
what shape of a horse fancied on the side of a whitish hill; but
the truth is, it is a copy of the Saxon standard, which, of course,
was a rude affair. However, Wise, whom I was telling you of, goes
on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When I saw it, the head had suffered a little and wanted reparation;
and the extremities of his hinder legs, from their unavoidable
situation, have by the fall of rains been filled up in some measure
with the washings from the upper parts; so that, in the nearest
view of him, the tail, which does not suffer the same inconvenience,
and has continued entire from the beginning, seems longer than
his legs. The supplies, which nature is continually affording,
occasion the turf to crumble and fall off into the white trench,
which in many years’ time produces small specks of turf, and not
a little obscures the brightness of the Horse; though there is
no danger from hence of the whole figure being obliterated, for
the inhabitants have a custom of ‘scouring the Horse,’ as they
call it; at which time a solemn festival is celebrated, and manlike
games with prizes exhibited, which no doubt had their original
in Saxon times in memory of the victory."[19]</p>

<p>"Scouring the Horse! yes, of course," said I, "that is what they
are doing now, and the games are to come off to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Exactly so," said he, "but you will like to hear how Wise goes
on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If ever the genius of King Alfred exerted itself (and it never
failed him in his greatest exigencies), it did remarkably so upon
account of this trophy. The situation of his affairs would not
permit him to expend much time, nor his circumstances much cost,
in effecting one," (truly, for he had six more pitched battles
to fight between April and November.) "His troops, though victorious,
were harassed and diminished by continual duty; nor did the country
afford, to any man’s thinking, materials proper for a work of
this kind. Though he had not therefore the opportunity of raising,
like other conquerors, a stupendous monument of brass or marble,
yet he has shown an admirable contrivance, in erecting one magnificent
enough, though simple in its design&mdash;executed, too, with little
labour and no expense&mdash;that may hereafter vie with the Pyramids
in duration, and perhaps exist when these shall be no more."</p>

<p>"But, dear me, Sir," said I, "how can the White Horse vie with
the Pyramids in duration? Why, the Pyramids were built&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Never mind when they were built," said he; "don’t you see the
old antiquary is an enthusiast? I had hoped you were one also."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Sir, I am very anxious to hear all you can tell me,"
said I, "and I won’t interrupt again."</p>

<p>"Well, as to the scouring, Wise says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The ceremony of scouring the Horse, from time immemorial, has
been solemnized by a numerous concourse of people from all the
villages round about. I am informed, though the Horse stands in
the parish of Uffington, yet other towns claim, by ancient custom,
a share of the duty upon this occasion. Since, therefore, this
noble antiquity is now explained, and consequently the reason
of the festival, it were to be wished that, in order to prevent
for the future its falling into oblivion, some care was taken
of the regulation of the games, and that they were restored to
their ancient splendour, of which, without question, they are
fallen much short. I know that these rites are cavilled at and
maligned by the more supercilious part of mankind; but the dislike
to them seems to be founded merely upon the abuse of them to riot
and debauchery, which I intend by no means to justify or excuse.
The practice of the best and wisest states, whose maxims we approve
and profess to follow, is sufficient authority for their use.
The liberty we so justly boast, and which ought to be a common
blessing to all, pleads loudly for them. The common people, from
their daily labour, stands at least in as much need of proper
intervals of recreation as their superiors, who are exempt from
it, and therefore in all free states have been indulged in sports
most suited to their genius and capacity. And if manlike games
contribute any thing towards the support of the natural bravery
of these, who are to be our bulwark and defence in times of danger,
they cannot be more seasonably revived than at this juncture,
when, through the general luxury and dissoluteness of the age,
there was never more likelihood of its being extinguished. Besides
all this, from hence a superior influence diffuseth itself through
the better sort, who are supposed to enter further into the intention
of these solemnities; for which reason it is, that to perpetuate
to posterity the remembrance of great men, and of great actions,
has been always recommended, as a proper incentive to virtue.
Customs of very trifling import, some ridiculous in themselves,
others owing to causes equally ridiculous, are oftentimes kept
up by Englishmen with much zeal and tenacity; and shall the greatest
prince that this isle was ever blessed with, and the greatest
action of that prince’s life, be in danger of being forgot, through
the neglect of a solemnity, the only one, perhaps, that was ever
instituted, at least, that is now preserved, to his honour?"[20]</p>

<p>I didn’t say a word now, though he seemed to have finished.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, after a minute, "have you nothing to say? You’re
very glad that it’s over, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir, indeed I am not," said I; "but I am very much obliged
to you for your kindness in telling me all that you have."</p>

<p>"You are a very intelligent young man, Sir," said he; "most young
fellows of your age would have been bored to death half-an-hour
ago, even if they hadn’t managed to run off altogether, and so
they would have lost a good lesson in English history&mdash;not that
they would have cared much for that though. But now, I dare say
you are getting hungry. Let us go up and see what they are doing
in the Castle, and I shall be very glad if you will do me the
honour of lunching with me."</p>

<p>"Well," thought I, as we got up from the turf, "there are not
many better things for getting a man on than being a good listener.
Here is a very learned old gentleman who doesn’t know my name,
and I have got the length of his foot, and he has asked me to
luncheon, just because I have been listening to his old stories.
I wonder where the lunch is to be though? he spoke of a Castle,
perhaps he lives in it&mdash;who knows?"</p>

<p>So we strolled away together up over the brow of the hill.</p>
