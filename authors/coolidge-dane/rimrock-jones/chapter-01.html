<p>The peace of midday lay upon Gunsight, broken only by the distant
<u>chang, chang</u> of bells as a ten-mule ore-team came toiling in from the
mines.  In the cool depths of the umbrella tree in front of the
Company's office a Mexican ground-dove crooned endlessly his ancient
song of love, but Gunsight took no notice.  Its thoughts were not of
love but of money.
</p><p>The dusty team of mules passed down the street, dragging their
double-trees reluctantly, and took their cursing meekly as they made
the turn at the tracks.  A switch engine bumped along the sidings,
snaking ore-cars down to the bins and bunting them up to the chutes,
but except for its bangings and clamor the town was still.  An aged
Mexican, armed with a long bunch of willow brush, swept idly at the
sprinkled street and Old Hassayamp Hicks, the proprietor of the Alamo
Saloon, leaned back in his rawhide chair and watched him with
good-natured contempt.
</p><p>The town was dead, after a manner of speaking, and yet it was not dead.
In the Gunsight Hotel where the officials of the Company left their
women-folks to idle and fret and gossip, there was a restless flash of
white from the upper veranda; and in the office below Andrew McBain,
the aggressive President of the Gunsight Mining and Developing Company,
paced nervously to and fro as he dictated letters to a typist.  He
paused, and as the clacking stopped a woman who had been reading a
novel on the veranda rose up noiselessly and listened over the railing.
The new typist was really quite deaf--one could hear every word that
was said.  She was pretty, too,--and--well, she dressed too well, for
one thing.
</p><p>But McBain was not making love to his typist.  He had stopped with a
word on his lips and stood gazing out the window.  The new typist had
learned to read faces and she followed his glance with a start.  Who
was this man that Andrew McBain was afraid of?  He came riding in from
the desert, a young man, burly and masterful, mounted on a buckskin
horse and with a pistol slung low on his leg.  McBain turned white, his
stern lips drew tighter and he stood where he had stopped in his stride
like a wolf that has seen a fierce dog; then suddenly he swung forward
again and his voice rang out harsh and defiant.  The new typist took
the words down at haphazard, for her thoughts were not on her work.
She was thinking of the man with a gun.  He had gone by without a
glance, and yet McBain was afraid of him.
</p><p>A couple of card players came out of the Alamo and stopped to talk with
Hassayamp.
</p><p>"Well, bless my soul," exclaimed the watchful Hassayamp as he suddenly
brought his chair down with a bump, "if hyer don't come that locoed
scoundrel, Rimrock!  Say, that boy's crazy, don't you know he is--jest
look at that big sack of rocks!"
</p><p>He rose up heavily and stepped out into the street, shading his eyes
from the glare of the sun.
</p><p>"Hello thar, Rimmy!" he rumbled bluffly as the horseman waved his hand,
"whar you been so long, and nothin' heard of you?  There's been a woman
hyer, enquirin' for you, most every day for a month now!"
</p><p>"'S that so?" responded Rimrock guardedly.  "Well, say, boys, I've
struck it rich!"
</p><p>He leaned back to untie a sack of ore, but Old Hassayamp was not to be
deterred.
</p><p>"Yes sir," he went on opening up his eyes triumphantly, "a widdy
woman--says you owe her two-bits for some bread!"
</p><p>He laughed uproariously at this pointed jest and clambered back to the
plank sidewalk where he sat down convulsed in his chair.
</p><p>"Aw, you make me tired!" said Rimrock shortly.  "You know I don't owe
no woman."
</p><p>"You owe every one else, though," came back Hassayamp with a Texas
yupe; "I got you there, boy.  You shore cain't git around that!"
</p><p>"Huh!" grunted Rimrock as he swung lightly to the ground.  "Two bits,
maybe!  Four bits!  A couple of dollars!  What's that to talk about
when a man is out after millions?  Is my credit good for the drinks?
Well, come on in then, boys; and I'll show you something good!"
</p><p>He led the way through the swinging doors and Hassayamp followed
ponderously.  The card players followed also and several cowboys,
appearing as if by miracle, lined up along with the rest.  Old
Hassayamp looked them over grimly, breathed hard and spread out the
glasses.
</p><p>"Well, all right, Rim," he observed, "between friends--but don't bid in
the whole town."
</p><p>"When I drink, my friends drink," answered Rimrock and tossed off his
first drink in a month.  "Now!" he went on, fetching out his sack,
"I'll show you something good!"
</p><p>He poured out a pile of blue-gray sand and stood away from it
admiringly.
</p><p>Old Hassayamp drew out his glasses and balanced them on his nose, then
he gazed at the pile of sand.
</p><p>"Well," he said, "what is it, anyway?"
</p><p>"It's copper, by grab, mighty nigh ten per cent copper, and you can
scoop it up with a shovel.  There's worlds of it, Hassayamp, a whole
doggoned mountain!   That's the trouble, there's almost too much!  I
can't handle it, man, it'll take millions to do it; but believe me, the
millions are there.  All I need is a stake now, just a couple of
thousand dollars----"
</p><p>"Huh!" grunted Hassayamp looking up over his glasses, "you don't reckon
I've got that much, do you, to sink in a pile of <u>sand</u>?"
</p><p>"If not you, then somebody else," replied Rimrock confidently.  "Some
feller that's out looking for sand.  I heard about a sport over in
London that tried on a bet to sell five-pound notes for a shilling.
That's like me offering to sell you twenty-five dollars for the English
equivalent of two bits.  And d'ye think he could get anyone to take
'em?  He stood up on a soap box and waved those notes in the air, but
d'ye think he could get anybody to buy?"
</p><p>He paused with a cynical smile and looked Hassayamp in the eye.
</p><p>"Well--no," conceded Hassayamp weakly.
</p><p>"You bet your life he could!" snapped back Rimrock.  "A guy came along
that knowed.  He took one look at those five-pound notes and handed up
fifty cents."
</p><p>"'I'll take two of 'em,' he says; and walks off with fifty dollars!"
</p><p>Rimrock scooped up his despised sand and poured it back into the bag,
after which he turned on his heel.  As the doors swung to behind him
Old Hassayamp looked at his customers and shook his head impressively.
From the street outside Rimrock could be heard telling a Mexican in
Spanish to take his horse to the corrals.  He was master of Gunsight
yet, though all his money had vanished and his credit would buy nothing
but the drinks.
</p><p>"Well, what d'ye know about that?" observed Hassayamp meditatively.
"By George, sometimes I almost think that boy is right!"
</p><p>He cleared his throat and hobbled towards the door and the crowd took
the hint to disperse.
</p><p>On the edge of the shady sidewalk Rimrock Jones, the follower after big
dreams, sat silent, balancing the sack of ore in a bronzed and
rock-scarred hand.  He was a powerful man, with the broad, square-set
shoulders that come from much swinging of a double jack or cranking at
a windlass.  The curling beard of youth had covered his hard-bitten
face and his head was unconsciously thrust forward, as if he still
glimpsed his vision and was eager to follow it further.  The crowd
settled down and gazed at him curiously, for they knew he had a story
to tell, and at last the great Rimrock sighed and looked at his
work-worn hands.
</p><p>"Hard going," he said, glancing up at Hassayamp.  "I've got a ten-foot
hole to sink on twenty different claims, no powder, and nothing but
Mexicans for help.  But I sure turned up some good ore--she gets richer
the deeper you go."
</p><p>"Any gold?" enquired Hassayamp hopefully.
</p><p>"Yes, but pocketty.  I leave all that chloriding to the Mexicans while
I do my discovery work.  They've got some picked rock on the dump."
</p><p>"Why don't you quit that dead work and do a little chloriding yourself?
Pound out a little gold--that's the way to get a stake!"
</p><p>Old Hassayamp spat the words out impatiently, but Rimrock seemed hardly
to hear.
</p><p>"Nope," he said, "no pocket-mining for me.  There's copper there,
millions of tons of it.  I'll make my winning yet."
</p><p>"Huh!" grunted Hassayamp, and Rimrock came out of his trance.
</p><p>"You don't think so, hey?" he challenged and then his face softened to
a slow, reminiscent smile.
</p><p>"Say, Hassayamp," he said, "did you ever hear about that prospector
that found a thousand pounds of gold in one chunk?  He was lost on the
desert, plumb out of water and forty miles from nowhere.  He couldn't
take the chunk along with him and if he left it there the sand would
cover it up.  Now what was that poor feller to do?"
</p><p>"Well, what did he do?" enquired Hassayamp cautiously.
</p><p>"He couldn't make up his mind," answered Rimrock, "so he stayed there
till he starved to death."
</p><p>"You're plumb full of these sayings and parables, ain't you?" remarked
Hassayamp sarcastically.  "What's that got to do with the case?"
</p><p>"Well," began Rimrock, sitting down on the edge of the sidewalk and
looking absently up the street, "take me, for instance.  I go out
across the desert to the Tecolotes and find a whole mountain of copper.
You don't have to chop it out with chisels, like that native copper
around the Great Lakes; and you don't have to go underground and do
timbering like they do around Bisbee and Cananea.  All you have to do
is to shoot it down and scoop it up with a steam shovel.  Now I've
located the whole danged mountain and done most of my discovery work,
but if some feller don't give me a boost, like taking that prospector a
canteen of water, I've either got to lose my mine or sit down and
starve to death.  If I'd never done anything, it'd be different, but
you know that I <u>made</u> the Gunsight."
</p><p>He leaned forward and fixed the saloon keeper with his earnest eyes and
Old Hassayamp held up both hands.
</p><p>"Yes, yes, boy, I know!" he broke out hurriedly.  "Don't talk to
me--I'm convinced.  But by George, Rim, you can spend more money and
have less to show for it than any man I know.  What's the use?  That's
what we all say.  What's the use of staking you when you'll turn right
around in front of us and throw the money away?  Ain't I staked you?
Ain't L. W. staked you?"
</p><p>"Yes!  And he broke me, too!" answered Rimrock, raising his voice to a
defiant boom.  "Here he comes now, the blue-faced old dastard!"
</p><p>He thrust out his jaw and glared up the street where L. W. Lockhart,
the local banker, came stumping down the sidewalk.  L. W. was tall and
rangy, with a bulldog jaw clamped down on a black cigar, and an air of
absolute detachment from his surroundings.
</p><p>"Yes, I mean you!" shouted Rimrock insultingly as L. W. went grimly
past.  "You claim to be a white man, and then stand in with that lawyer
to beat me out of my mine.  I made you, you old nickel-pincher, and now
you go by me and don't even say: 'Have a drink!'"
</p><p>"You're drunk!" retorted Lockhart, looking back over his shoulder, and
Rimrock jumped to his feet.
</p><p>"I'll show you!" he cried, starting angrily after him, and L. W. turned
swiftly to meet him.
</p><p>"You'll show me <u>what</u>?" he demanded coldly as Rimrock put his hand to
his gun.
</p><p>"Never mind!" answered Rimrock.  "You know you jobbed me.  I let you in
on a good thing and you sold me out to McBain.  I want some money and
if you don't give it to me I'll--I'll go over and collect from him."
</p><p>"Oh, you want some money, hey?" repeated Lockhart.  "I thought you was
going to <u>show</u> me something!"
</p><p>The banker scowled as he rolled his cigar, but there was a twinkle far
back in his eyes.  "You're bad now, ain't you?" he continued
tauntingly.  "You're just feeling awful!  You're going to jump on Lon
Lockhart and stomp him into the ground!  Huh!"
</p><p>"Aw, shut your mouth!" answered Rimrock defiantly, "I never said a word
about fight."
</p><p>"Uhhr!" grunted L. W. and put his hand in his pocket at which Rimrock
became suddenly expectant.
</p><p>"Henry Jones," began the banker, "I knowed your father and he was an
honorable, hardworking man.  You're nothing but a bum and you're
getting worse--why don't you go and put up that gun?"
</p><p>"I don't have to!" retorted Rimrock but he moved up closer and there
was a wheedling turn to his voice.  "Just two thousand dollars,
Lon--that's all I ask of you--and I'll give you a share in my mine.
Didn't I come to you first, when I discovered the Gunsight, and give
you the very best claim?  And you ditched me, L. W., dad-burn you, you
know it; you sold me out to McBain.  But I've got something now that
runs up into millions!  All it needs is a little more work!"
</p><p>"Yes, and forty miles of railroad," put in L. W. intolerantly.  "I
wouldn't take the whole works for a gift!"
</p><p>"No, but Lon, I'm lucky--you know that yourself--I can go East and sell
the old mine."
</p><p>"Oh, you're lucky, are you?" interrupted L. W.  "Well, how come then
that you're standing here, broke?  But here, I've got business, I'll
give you ten dollars--and remember, it's the last that you get!"
</p><p>He drew out a bill, but Rimrock stood looking at him with a slow and
contemptuous smile.
</p><p>"Yes, you doggoned old screw," he answered ungraciously, "what good
will ten dollars do?"
</p><p>"You can get just as drunk on that," replied L. W. pointedly, "as you
could on a hundred thousand!"
</p><p>A change came over Rimrock's face, the swift mirroring of some great
idea, and he reached out and grabbed the money.
</p><p>"Where you going?" demanded L. W. as he started across the street.
</p><p>"None of your business," answered Rimrock curtly, but he headed
straight for the Mint.
