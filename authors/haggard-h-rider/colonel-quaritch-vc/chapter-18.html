<p>Time went on. Mr. Quest had been back at Boisingham for ten days or
more, and was more cheerful than Belle (we can no longer call her his
wife) had seen him for many a day. Indeed he felt as though ten years
had been lifted off his back. He had taken a great and terrible decision
and had acted upon it, and it had been successful, for he knew that his
evil genius was so thoroughly terrified that for a long while at least
he would be free from her persecution. But with Belle his relations
remained as strained as ever.
</p><p>Now that the reader is in the secret of Mr. Quest's life, it will
perhaps help him to understand the apparent strangeness of his conduct
with reference to his wife and Edward Cossey. It is quite true that
Belle did not know the full extent of her husband's guilt. She did not
know that he was not her husband, but she did know that nearly all of
her little fortune had been paid over to another woman, and that woman
a common, vulgar woman, as one of Edith's letters which had fallen into
her hands by chance very clearly showed her. Therefore, had he attempted
to expose her proceedings or even to control her actions, she had in her
hand an effective weapon of defence wherewith she could and would have
given blow for blow. This state of affairs of necessity forced each
party to preserve an armed neutrality towards the other, whilst they
waited for a suitable opportunity to assert themselves. Not that their
objects were quite the same. Belle merely wished to be free from her
husband, whom she had always disliked, and whom she now positively hated
with that curious hatred which women occasionally conceive toward
those to whom they are legally bound, when they have been bad enough
or unfortunate enough to fall in love with somebody else. He, on the
contrary, had that desire for revenge upon her which even the gentler
stamp of man is apt to conceive towards one who, herself the object of
his strong affection, daily and hourly repels and repays it with scorn
and infidelity. He did love her truly; she was the one living thing in
all his bitter lonely life to whom his heart had gone out. True, he put
pressure on her to marry him, or what comes to the same thing, allowed
and encouraged her drunken old father to do so. But he had loved her and
still loved her, and yet she mocked at him, and in the face of that fact
about the money--her money, which he had paid away to the other woman,
a fact which it was impossible for him to explain except by admission
of guilt which would be his ruin, what was he to urge to convince her
of this, even had she been open to conviction? But it was bitter to him,
bitter beyond all conception, to have this, the one joy of his life,
snatched from him. He threw himself with ardour into the pursuit after
wealth and dignity of position, partly because he had a legitimate
desire for these things, and partly to assuage the constant irritation
of his mind, but to no purpose. These two spectres of his existence,
his tiger wife and the fair woman who was his wife in name, constantly
marched side by side before him, blotting out the beauty from every
scene and souring the sweetness of every joy. But if in his pain he
thirsted for revenge upon Belle, who would have none of him, how much
more did he desire to be avenged upon Edward Cossey, who, as it were,
had in sheer wantonness robbed him of the one good thing he had? It made
him mad to think that this man, to whom he knew himself to be in every
way superior, should have had the power thus to injure him, and he
longed to pay him back measure for measure, and through <u>his</u> heart's
affections to strike him as mortal a blow as he had himself received.
</p><p>Mr. Quest was no doubt a bad man; his whole life was a fraud, he
was selfish and unscrupulous in his schemes and relentless in their
execution, but whatever may have been the measure of his iniquities, he
was not doomed to wait for another world to have them meted out to him
again. His life, indeed, was full of miseries, the more keenly felt
because of the high pitch and capacity of his nature, and perhaps the
sharpest of them all was the sickening knowledge that had it not been
for that one fatal error of his boyhood, that one false step down the
steep of Avernus, he might have been a good and even a great man.
</p><p>Just now, however, his load was a little lightened, and he was able to
devote himself to his money-making and to the weaving of the web that
was to destroy his rival, Edward Cossey, with a mind a little less
preoccupied with other cares.
</p><p>Meanwhile, things at the Castle were going very pleasantly for
everybody. The Squire was as happy in attending to the various details
connected with the transfer of the mortgages as though he had been
lending thirty thousand pounds instead of borrowing them. The great
George was happy in the accustomed flow of cash, that enabled him to
treat Janter with a lofty scorn not unmingled with pity, which was as
balm to his harassed soul, and also to transact an enormous amount of
business in his own peculiar way with men up trees and otherwise. For
had he not to stock the Moat Farm, and was not Michaelmas at hand?
</p><p>Ida, too, was happy, happier than she had been since her brother's
death, for reasons that have already been hinted at. Besides, Mr. Edward
Cossey was out of the way, and that to Ida was a very great thing, for
his presence to her was what a policeman is to a ticket-of-leave man--a
most unpleasant and suggestive sight. She fully realised the meaning and
extent of the bargain into which she had entered to save her father and
her house, and there lay upon her the deep shadow of evil that was to
come. Every time she saw her father bustling about with his business
matters and his parchments, every time the universal George arrived with
an air of melancholy satisfaction and a long list of the farming stock
and implements he had bought at some neighbouring Michaelmas sale, the
shadow deepened, and she heard the clanking of her chains. Therefore she
was the more thankful for her respite.
</p><p>Harold Quaritch was happy too, though in a somewhat restless and
peculiar way. Mrs. Jobson (the old lady who attended to his wants at
Molehill, with the help of a gardener and a simple village maid, her
niece, who smashed all the crockery and nearly drove the Colonel mad
by banging the doors, shifting his papers and even dusting his trays of
Roman coins) actually confided to some friends in the village that she
thought the poor dear gentleman was going mad. When questioned on what
she based this belief, she replied that he would walk up and down the
oak-panelled dining-room by the hour together, and then, when he got
tired of that exercise, whereby, said Mrs. Jobson, he had already worn
a groove in the new Turkey carpet, he would take out a "rokey" (foggy)
looking bit of a picture, set it upon a chair and stare at it through
his fingers, shaking his head and muttering all the while. Then--further
and conclusive proof of a yielding intellect--he would get a half-sheet
of paper with some writing on it and put it on the mantelpiece and stare
at that. Next he would turn it upside down and stare at it so, then
sideways, then all ways, then he would hold it before a looking-glass
and stare at the looking-glass, and so on. When asked how she knew
all this, she confessed that her niece Jane had seen it through the
key-hole, not once but often.
</p><p>Of course, as the practised and discerning reader will clearly
understand, this meant only that when walking and wearing out the carpet
the Colonel was thinking of Ida. When contemplating the painting that
she had given him, he was admiring her work and trying to reconcile the
admiration with his conscience and his somewhat peculiar views of art.
And when glaring at the paper, he was vainly endeavouring to make
head or tale of the message written to his son on the night before
his execution by Sir James de la Molle in the reign of Charles I.,
confidently believed by Ida to contain a key to the whereabouts of the
treasure he was supposed to have secreted.
</p><p>Of course the tale of this worthy soul, Mrs. Jobson, did not lose in the
telling, and when it reached Ida's ears, which it did at last through
the medium of George--for in addition to his numberless other functions,
George was the sole authorised purveyor of village and county news--it
read that Colonel Quaritch had gone raving mad.
</p><p>Ten minutes afterwards this raving lunatic arrived at the Castle in
dress clothes and his right mind, whereon Ida promptly repeated her
thrilling history, somewhat to the subsequent discomfort of Mrs. Jobson
and Jane.
</p><p>No one, as somebody once said with equal truth and profundity, knows
what a minute may bring forth, much less, therefore, does anybody know
what an evening of say two hundred and forty minutes may produce. For
instance, Harold Quaritch--though by this time he had gone so far as to
freely admit to himself that he was utterly and hopelessly in love with
Ida, in love with her with that settled and determined passion which
sometimes strikes a man or woman in middle age--certainly did not know
that before the evening was out he would have declared his devotion with
results that shall be made clear in their decent order. When he put
on his dress clothes to come up to dinner, he had no more intention of
proposing to Ida than he had of not taking them off when he went to
bed. His love was deep enough and steady enough, but perhaps it did
not possess that wild impetuosity which carries people so far in their
youth, sometimes indeed a great deal further than their reason approves.
It was essentially a middle-aged devotion, and bore the same resemblance
to the picturesque passion of five-and-twenty that a snow-fed torrent
does to a navigable river. The one rushes and roars and sweeps away
the bridges and devastates happy homes, while the other bears upon
its placid breast the argosies of peace and plenty and is generally
serviceable to the necessities of man. Still, there is something
attractive about torrents. There is a grandeur in that first rush
of passion which results from the sudden melting of the snows of the
heart's purity and faith and high unstained devotion.
</p><p>But both torrents and navigable rivers are liable to a common fate, they
may fall over precipices, and when this comes to pass even the latter
cease to be navigable for a space. Now this catastrophe was about to
overtake our friend the Colonel.
</p><p>Well, Harold Quaritch had dined, and had enjoyed a pleasant as well as a
good dinner. The Squire, who of late had been cheerful as a cricket, was
in his best form, and told long stories with an infinitesimal point.
In anybody else's mouth these stories would have been wearisome to
a degree, but there was a gusto, an originality, and a kind of Tudor
period flavour about the old gentleman, which made his worst and longest
story acceptable in any society. The Colonel himself had also come out
in a most unusual way. He possessed a fund of dry humour which he rarely
produced, but when he did produce it, it was of a most satisfactory
order. On this particular night it was all on view, greatly to the
satisfaction of Ida, who was a witty as well as a clever woman. And so
it came to pass that the dinner was a very pleasant one.
</p><p>Harold and the Squire were still sitting over their wine. The latter was
for the fifth time giving his guest a full and particular account of
how his deceased aunt, Mrs. Massey, had been persuaded by a learned
antiquarian to convert or rather to restore Dead Man's Mount into its
supposed primitive condition of an ancient British dwelling, and of
the extraordinary expression of her face when the bill came in, when
suddenly the servant announced that George was waiting to see him.
</p><p>The old gentleman grumbled a great deal, but finally got up and went to
enjoy himself for the next hour or so in talking about things in
general with his retainer, leaving his guest to find his way to the
drawing-room.
</p><p>When the Colonel reached the room, he found Ida seated at the piano,
singing. She heard him shut the door, looked round, nodded prettily, and
then went on with her singing. He came and sat down on a low chair some
two paces from her, placing himself in such a position that he could see
her face, which indeed he always found a wonderfully pleasant object of
contemplation. Ida was playing without music--the only light in the room
was that of a low lamp with a red fringe to it. Therefore, he could not
see very much, being with difficulty able to trace the outlines of her
features, but if the shadow thus robbed him, it on the other hand
lent her a beauty of its own, clothing her face with an atmosphere of
wonderful softness which it did not always possess in the glare of day.
The Colonel indeed (we must remember that he was in love and that it was
after dinner) became quite poetical (internally of course) about it, and
in his heart compared her first to St. Cecilia at her organ, and then to
the Angel of the Twilight. He had never seen her look so lovely. At her
worst she was a handsome and noble-looking woman, but now the shadow
from without, and though he knew nothing of that, the shadow from her
heart within also, aided maybe by the music's swell, had softened and
purified her face till it did indeed look almost like an angel's. It is
strong, powerful faces that are capable of the most tenderness, not the
soft and pretty ones, and even in a plain person, when such a face is in
this way seen, it gathers a peculiar beauty of its own. But Ida was not
a plain person, so on the whole it is scarcely wonderful that a certain
effect was produced upon Harold Quaritch. Ida went on singing almost
without a break--to outward appearance, at any rate, all unconscious
of what was passing in her admirer's mind. She had a good memory and a
sweet voice, and really liked music for its own sake, so it was no great
effort to her to do so.
</p><p>Presently, she sang a song from Tennyson's "Maud," the tender and
beautiful words whereof will be familiar to most readers of her story.
It began:
</p>
<pre>
                "O let the solid ground
                   Not fail beneath my feet
                 Before my life has found
                   What some have found so sweet."</pre>

<p>The song is a lovely one, nor did it suffer from her rendering, and the
effect it produced upon Harold was of a most peculiar nature. All his
past life seemed to heave and break beneath the magic of the music and
the magic of the singer, as a northern field of ice breaks up beneath
the outburst of the summer sun. It broke, sank, and vanished into the
depths of his nature, those dread unmeasured depths that roll and murmur
in the vastness of each human heart as the sea rolls beneath its cloak
of ice; that roll and murmur here, and set towards a shore of which
we have no chart or knowledge. The past was gone, the frozen years had
melted, and once more the sweet strong air of youth blew across his
heart, and once more there was clear sky above, wherein the angels
sailed. Before the breath of that sweet song the barrier of self
fell down, his being went out to meet her being, and all the sleeping
possibilities of life rose from the buried time.
</p><p>He sat and listened, trembling as he listened, till the gentle echoes of
the music died upon the quiet air. They died, and were gathered into the
emptiness which receives and records all things, leaving him broken.
</p><p>She turned to him, smiling faintly, for the song had moved her also, and
he felt that he must speak.
</p><p>"That is a beautiful song," he said; "sing it again if you do not mind."
</p><p>She made no answer, but once more she sang:
</p>
<pre>
                "O let the solid ground
                   Not fail beneath my feet
                 Before my life has found
                   What some have found so sweet;"</pre>

<p>and then suddenly broke off.
</p><p>"Why are you looking at me?" she said. "I can feel you looking at me and
it makes me nervous."
</p><p>He bent towards her and looked her in the eyes.
</p><p>"I love you, Ida," he said, "I love you with all my heart," and he
stopped suddenly.
</p><p>She turned quite pale, even in that light he could see her pallor, and
her hands fell heavily on the keys.
</p><p>The echo of the crashing notes rolled round the room and slowly died
away--but still she said nothing.
