<p>"Mister Gumbril!" Surprise was mingled with delight. "This is
indeed a pleasure!" Delight was now the prevailing emotion expressed
by the voice that advanced, as yet without a visible source, from
the dark recesses of the shop.</p>

<p>"The pleasure, Mr. Bojanus, is mine." Gumbril closed the shop
door behind him.</p>

<p>A very small man, dressed in a frock-coat, popped out from a
canyon that opened, a mere black crevice, between two stratified
precipices of mid-season suitings, and advancing into the open
space before the door bowed with an old-world grace, revealing
a nacreous scalp thinly mantled with long damp creepers of brown
hair.</p>

<p>"And to what, may I ask, do I owe this pleasure, sir?" Mr. Bojanus
looked up archly with a sideways cock of his head that tilted
the rigid points of his waxed moustache. The fingers of his right
hand were thrust into the bosom of his frock-coat and his toes
were turned out in the dancing-master’s First Position. "A light
spring great-coat, is it? Or a new suit? I notice," his eye travelled
professionally up and down Gumbril’s long, thin form, "I notice
that the garments you are wearing at present, Mr. Gumbril, look—how
shall I say?—well, a trifle negleejay, as the French would put
it, a trifle negleejay."</p>

<p>Gumbril looked down at himself. He resented Mr. Bojanus’s negleejay,
he was pained and wounded by the aspersion. Negleejay? And he
had fancied that he really looked rather elegant and distinguished
(but, after all, he always looked that, even in rags)—no, that
he looked positively neat, like Mr. Porteous, positively soldierly
in his black jacket and his musical comedy trousers and his patent
leather shoes. And the black felt hat—didn’t that just add the
foreign, the Southern touch which saved the whole composition
from banality? He regarded himself, trying to see his clothes—garments,
Mr. Bojanus had called them; garments, good Lord!—through the
tailor’s expert eyes. There were sagging folds about the overloaded
pockets, there was a stain on his waistcoat, the knees of his
trousers were baggy and puckered like the bare knees of Hélène
Fourmont in Rubens’s fur-coat portrait at Vienna. Yes, it was
all horribly negleejay. He felt depressed; but looking at Mr.
Bojanus’s studied and professional correctness, he was a little
comforted. That frock-coat, for example. It was like something
in a very modern picture—such a smooth, unwrinkled cylinder about
the chest, such a sense of pure and abstract conic-ness in the
sleekly rounded skirts! Nothing could have been less negleejay.
He was reassured.</p>

<p>"I want you," he said at last, clearing his throat importantly,
"to make me a pair of trousers to a novel specification of my
own. It’s a new idea." And he gave a brief description of Gumbril’s
Patent Small Clothes.</p>

<p>Mr. Bojanus listened with attention.</p>

<p>"I can make them for you," he said, when the description was
finished. "I can make them for you—if you <em>really</em> wish,
Mr. Gumbril," he added.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Gumbril.</p>

<p>"And do you intend, may I ask, Mr. Gumbril, to <em>wear</em>
these ... these garments?"</p>

<p>Guiltily, Gumbril denied himself. "Only to demonstrate the idea,
Mr. Bojanus. I am exploiting the invention commercially, you see."</p>

<p>"Commercially? I see, Mr. Gumbril."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would like a share," suggested Gumbril.</p>

<p>Mr. Bojanus shook his head. "It wouldn’t do for my cleeantail,
I fear, Mr. Gumbril. You could ’ardly expect the Best People to
wear such things."</p>

<p>"Couldn’t you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Bojanus went on shaking his head. "I know them," he said,
"I know the Best People. Well." And he added with an irrelevance
that was, perhaps, only apparent, "Between ourselves, Mr. Gumbril,
I am a great admirer of Lenin...."</p>

<p>"So am I," said Gumbril, "theoretically. But then I have so little
to lose to Lenin. I can afford to admire him. But you, Mr. Bojanus,
you, the prosperous bourgeois—oh, purely in the economic sense
of the word, Mr. Bojanus...."</p>

<p>Mr. Bojanus accepted the explanation with one of his old-world
bows.</p>

<p>"... you would be among the first to suffer if an English Lenin
were to start his activities here."</p>

<p>"There, Mr. Gumbril, if I may be allowed to say so, you are wrong."
Mr. Bojanus removed his hand from his bosom and employed it to
emphasize the points of his discourse. "When the revolution comes,
Mr. Gumbril—the great and necessary revolution, as Alderman Beckford
called it—it won’t be the owning of a little money that’ll get
a man into trouble. It’ll be his class-habits, Mr. Gumbril, his
class-speech, his class-education. It’ll be Shibboleth all over
again, Mr. Gumbril; mark my words. The Red Guards will stop people
in the street and ask them to say some such word as ‘towel.’ If
they call it ‘towel,’ like you and your friends, Mr. Gumbril,
why then...." Mr. Bojanus went through the gestures of pointing
a rifle and pulling the trigger; he clicked his tongue against
his teeth to symbolize the report.... "That’ll be the end of them.
But if they say ‘tèaul,’ like the rest of us, Mr. Gumbril, it’ll
be: ‘Pass Friend and Long Live the Proletariat.’ Long live Tèaul."</p>

<p>"I’m afraid you may be right," said Gumbril.</p>

<p>"I’m convinced of it," said Mr. Bojanus. "It’s my clients, Mr.
Gumbril, it’s the Best People that the other people resent. It’s
their confidence, their ease, it’s the habit their money and their
position give them of ordering people about, it’s the way they
take their place in the world for granted, it’s their prestige,
which the other people would like to deny, but can’t—it’s all
that, Mr. Gumbril, that’s so galling."</p>

<p>Gumbril nodded. He himself had envied his securer friends their
power of ignoring the humanity of those who were not of their
class. To do that really well, one must always have lived in a
large house full of clockwork servants; one must never have been
short of money, never at a restaurant ordered the cheaper thing
instead of the more delicious; one must never have regarded a
policeman as anything but one’s paid defender against the lower
orders, never for a moment have doubted one’s divine right to
do, within the accepted limits, exactly what one liked without
a further thought to anything or any one but oneself and one’s
own enjoyment. Gumbril had been brought up among these blessed
beings; but he was not one of them. Alas? or fortunately? He hardly
knew which.</p>

<p>"And what good do you expect the revolution to do, Mr. Bojanus?"
he asked at last.</p>

<p>Mr. Bojanus replaced his hand in his bosom. "None whatever, Mr.
Gumbril," he said. "None whatever."</p>

<p>"But Liberty," Gumbril suggested, "equality and all that. What
about those, Mr. Bojanus?"</p>

<p>Mr. Bojanus smiled up at him tolerantly and kindly, as he might
have smiled at some one who had suggested, shall we say, that
evening trousers should be turned up at the bottom. "Liberty,
Mr. Gumbril?" he said; "you don’t suppose any serious-minded person
imagines a revolution is going to bring liberty, do you?"</p>

<p>"The people who make the revolution always seem to ask for liberty."</p>

<p>"But do they ever get it, Mr. Gumbril?" Mr. Bojanus cocked his
head playfully and smiled. "Look at ’istory, Mr. Gumbril, look
at ’istory. First it’s the French Revolution. They ask for political
liberty. And they gets it. Then comes the Reform Bill, then Forty-Eight,
then all the Franchise Acts and Votes for Women—always more and
more political liberty. And what’s the result, Mr. Gumbril? Nothing
at all. Who’s freer for political liberty? Not a soul, Mr. Gumbril.
There was never a greater swindle ’atched in the ’ole of ’istory.
And when you think ’ow those poor young men like Shelley talked
about it—it’s pathetic," said Mr. Bojanus, shaking his head, "reelly
pathetic. Political liberty’s a swindle because a man doesn’t
spend his time being political. He spends it sleeping, eating,
amusing himself a little and working—mostly working. When they’d
got all the political liberty they wanted—or found they didn’t
want—they began to understand this. And so now it’s all for the
industrial revolution, Mr. Gumbril. But bless you, that’s as big
a swindle as the other. How can there ever be liberty under any
system? No amount of profit-sharing or self-government by the
workers, no amount of hyjeenic conditions or cocoa villages or
recreation grounds can get rid of the fundamental slavery—the
necessity of working. Liberty? why, it doesn’t exist! There’s
no liberty in this world; only gilded cages. And then, Mr. Gumbril,
even suppose you could somehow get rid of the necessity of working,
suppose a man’s time were all leisure. Would he be free then?
I say nothing of the natural slavery of eating and sleeping and
all that, Mr. Gumbril; I say nothing of that, because that, if
I may say so, would be too ’air-splitting and metaphysical. But
what I do ask you is this," and Mr. Bojanus wagged his forefinger
almost menacingly at the sleeping partner in this dialogue: "would
a man with unlimited leisure be free, Mr. Gumbril? I say he would
not. Not unless he ’appened to be a man like you or me, Mr. Gumbril,
a man of sense, a man of independent judgment. An ordinary man
would not be free. Because he wouldn’t know how to occupy his
leisure except in some way that would be forced on ’im by other
people. People don’t know ’ow to entertain themselves now; they
leave it to other people to do it for them. They swallow what’s
given them. They ’ave to swallow it, whether they like it or not.
Cinemas, newspapers, magazines, gramophones, football matches,
wireless telephones—take them or leave them, if you want to amuse
youself. The ordinary man can’t leave them. He takes; and what’s
that but slavery? And so you see, Mr. Gumbril," Mr. Bojanus smiled
with a kind of roguish triumph, "you see that even in the purely
’ypothetical case of a man with indefinite leisure, there still
would be no freedom.... And the case, as I have said, is purely
’ypothetical; at any rate so far as concerns the sort of people
who want a revolution. And as for the sort of people who do enjoy
leisure, even now—why I think, Mr. Gumbril, you and I know enough
about the Best People to know that freedom, except possibly sexual
freedom, is not their strongest point. And sexual freedom—what’s
that?" Mr. Bojanus dramatically inquired. "You and I, Mr. Gumbril,"
he answered confidentially, "we know. It’s an ’orrible, ’ideous
slavery. That’s what it is. Or am I wrong, Mr. Gumbril?"</p>

<p>"Quite right, quite right, Mr. Bojanus," Gumbril hastened to
reply.</p>

<p>"From all of which," continued Mr. Bojanus, "it follows that,
except for a few, a very few people like you and me, Mr. Gumbril,
there’s no such thing as liberty. It’s an ’oax, Mr. Gumbril. An
’orrible plant. And if I may be allowed to say so," Mr. Bojanus
lowered his voice, but still spoke with emphasis, "a bloody swindle."</p>

<p>"But in that case, Mr. Bojanus, why are you so anxious to have
a revolution?" Gumbril inquired.</p>

<p>Thoughtfully, Mr. Bojanus twisted to a finer point his waxed
moustaches. "Well," he said at last, "it would be a nice change.
I was always one for change and a little excitement. And then
there’s the scientific interest. You never quite know ’ow an experiment
will turn out, do you, Mr. Gumbril? I remember when I was a boy,
my old dad—a great gardener he was, a regular floriculturist,
you might say, Mr. Gumbril—he tried the experiment of grafting
a sprig of Gloire de Dijon on to a black currant bush. And, would
you believe it? the roses came out black, coal black, Mr. Gumbril.
Nobody would ever have guessed that if the thing had never been
tried. And that’s what I say about the revolution. You don’t know
what’ll come of it till you try. Black roses, blue roses—’oo knows,
Mr. Gumbril, ’oo knows?"</p>

<p>"Who indeed?" Gumbril looked at his watch. "About those trousers
..." he added.</p>

<p>"Those garments," corrected Mr. Bojanus. "Ah, yes. Should we
say next Tuesday?"</p>

<p>"Let us say next Tuesday." Gumbril opened the shop door. "Good
morning, Mr. Bojanus."</p>

<p>Mr. Bojanus bowed him out, as though he had been a prince of
the blood.</p>

<p>The sun was shining and at the end of the street between the
houses the sky was blue. Gauzily the distances faded to a soft
rich indistinctness; there were veils of golden muslin thickening
down the length of every vista. On the trees in the Hanover Square
gardens the young leaves were still so green that they seemed
to be alight, green fire, and the sooty trunks looked blacker
and dirtier than ever. It would have been a pleasant and apposite
thing if a cuckoo had started calling. But though the cuckoo was
silent it was a happy day. A day, Gumbril reflected, as he strolled
idly along, to be in love.</p>

<p>From the world of tailors Gumbril passed into that of the artificial
pearl merchants and with a still keener appreciation of the amorous
qualities of this clear spring day, he began a leisured march
along the perfumed pavements of Bond Street. He thought with a
profound satisfaction of those sixty-three papers on the Risorgimento.
How pleasant it was to waste time! And Bond Street offered so
many opportunities for wasting it agreeably. He trotted round
the Spring Exhibition at the Grosvenor and came out, a little
regretting, he had to confess, his eighteen pence for admission.
After that, he pretended that he wanted to buy a grand piano.
When he had finished practising his favourite passages on the
magnificent instrument to which they obsequiously introduced him,
he looked in for a few moments at Sotheby’s, sniffed among the
ancient books and strolled on again, admiring the cigars, the
lucid scent-bottles, the socks, the old masters, the emerald necklaces,
everything, in fact, in all the shops he passed.</p>

<p>‘Forthcoming Exhibition of Works by Casimir Lypiatt.’ The announcement
caught his eye. And so poor old Lypiatt was on the warpath again,
he reflected, as he pushed open the doors of the Albemarle Galleries.
Poor old Lypiatt! Dear old Lypiatt, even. He liked Lypiatt. Though
he had his defects. It would be fun to see him again.</p>

<p>Gumbril found himself in the midst of a dismal collection of
etchings. He passed them in review, wondering why it was that,
in these hard days when no painter can sell a picture, almost
any dull fool who can scratch a conventional etcher’s view of
two boats, a suggested cloud and the flat sea should be able to
get rid of his prints by the dozen and at guineas apiece. He was
interrupted in his speculations by the approach of the assistant
in charge of the gallery. He came up shyly and uncomfortably,
but with the conscientious determination of one ambitious to do
his duty and make good. He was a very young man with pale hair,
to which heavy oiling had given a curious greyish colour, and
a face of such childish contour and so imberb that he looked like
a little boy playing at grown-ups. He had only been at this job
a few weeks and he found it very difficult.</p>

<p>"This," he remarked, with a little introductory cough, pointing
to one view of the two boats and the flat sea, "is an earlier
state than this." And he pointed to another view, where the boats
were still two and the sea seemed just as flat—though possibly,
on a closer inspection, it might really have been flatter.</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Gumbril.</p>

<p>The assistant was rather pained by his coldness. He blushed;
but constrained himself to go on. "Some excellent judges," he
said, "prefer the earlier state, though it is less highly finished."</p>

<p>"Ah?"</p>

<p>"Beautiful atmosphere, isn’t it?" The assistant put his head
on one side and pursed his childish lips appreciatively.</p>

<p>Gumbril nodded.</p>

<p>With desperation, the assistant indicated the shadowed rump of
one of the boats. "A wonderful feeling in this passage," he said,
redder than ever.</p>

<p>"Very intense," said Gumbril.</p>

<p>The assistant smiled at him gratefully. "That’s the word," he
said, delighted. "Intense. That’s it. Very intense." He repeated
the word several times as though to make sure of remembering it
when the occasion next presented itself. He was determined to
make good.</p>

<p>"I see Mr. Lypiatt is to have a show here soon," remarked Gumbril,
who had had enough of the boats.</p>

<p>"He is making the final arrangements with Mr. Albemarle at this
very moment," said the assistant triumphantly, with the air of
one who produces, at the dramatic and critical moment, a rabbit
out of the empty hat.</p>

<p>"You don’t say so?" Gumbril was duly impressed. "Then I’ll wait
till he comes out," he said, and sat down with his back to the
boats.</p>

<p>The assistant returned to his desk and picked up the gold-belted
fountain pen which his Aunt had given him when he first went into
business, last Christmas. "Very intense," he wrote in capitals
on a half-sheet of notepaper. "The feeling in this passage is
very intense." He studied the paper for a few moments, then folded
it up carefully and put it away in his waistcoat pocket. "Always
make a note of it." That was one of the business mottoes he had
himself written out so laboriously in Indian ink and old English
lettering. It hung over his bed between "The Lord is my Shepherd,"
which his mother had given him, and a quotation from Dr. Frank
Crane, "A smiling face sells more goods than a clever tongue."
Still, a clever tongue, the young assistant had often reflected,
was a very useful thing, especially in this job. He wondered whether
one could say that the composition of a picture was very intense.
Mr. Albemarle was very keen on the composition, he noticed. But
perhaps it was better to stick to plain ‘fine,’ which was a little
commonplace, perhaps, but very safe. He would ask Mr. Albemarle
about it. And then there was all that stuff about plastic values
and pure plasticity. He sighed. It was all very difficult. A chap
might be as willing and eager to make good as he liked; but when
it came to this about atmosphere and intense passages and plasticity—well,
really, what could a chap do? Make a note of it. It was the only
thing.</p>

<p>In Mr. Albemarle’s private room Casimir Lypiatt thumped the table.
"Size, Mr. Albemarle," he was saying, "size and vehemence and
spiritual significance—that’s what the old fellows had, and we
haven’t...." He gesticulated as he talked, his face worked and
his green eyes, set in their dark, charred orbits, were full of
a troubled light. The forehead was precipitous, the nose long
and sharp; in the bony and almost fleshless face, the lips of
the wide mouth were surprisingly full.</p>

<p>"Precisely, precisely," said Mr. Albemarle in his juicy voice.
He was a round, smooth, little man with a head like an egg; he
spoke, he moved with a certain pomp, a butlerish gravity, that
were evidently meant to be ducal.</p>

<p>"That’s what I’ve set myself to recapture," Lypiatt went on:
"the size, the masterfulness of the masters." He felt a warmth
running through him as he spoke, flushing his cheeks, pulsing
hotly behind the eyes, as though he had drunk a draught of some
heartening red wine. His own words elated him, and drunkenly gesticulating,
he was as though drunken. The greatness of the masters—he felt
it in him. He knew his own power, he knew, he knew. He could do
all that they had done. Nothing was beyond his strength.</p>

<p>Egg-headed Albemarle confronted him, impeccably the butler, exacerbatingly
serene. Albemarle too should be fired. He struck the table once
more, he broke out again:</p>

<p>"It’s been my mission," he shouted, "all these years."</p>

<p>All these years.... Time had worn the hair from his temples;
the high, steep forehead seemed higher than it really was. He
was forty now; the turbulent young Lypiatt who had once declared
that no man could do anything worth doing after he was thirty,
was forty now. But in these fiery moments he could forget the
years, he could forget the disappointments, the unsold pictures,
the bad reviews. "My mission," he repeated; "and by God! I feel,
I know I can carry it through."</p>

<p>Warmly the blood pulsed behind his eyes.</p>

<p>"Quite," said Mr. Albemarle, nodding the egg. "Quite."</p>

<p>"And how small the scale is nowadays!" Lypiatt went on, rhapsodically.
"How trivial the conception, how limited the scope! You see no
painter-sculptor-poets, like Michelangelo; no scientist-artists,
like Leonardo; no mathematician-courtiers, like Boscovitch; no
impresario-musicians, like Handel; no geniuses of all trades,
like Wren. I have set myself against this abject specialization
of ours. I stand alone, opposing it with my example." Lypiatt
raised his hand. Like the statue of Liberty, standing colossal
and alone.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," began Mr. Albemarle.</p>

<p>"Painter, poet, musician," cried Lypiatt. "I am all three. I...."</p>

<p>"... there is a danger of—how shall I put it—dissipating one’s
energies," Mr. Albemarle went on with determination. Discreetly,
he looked at his watch. This conversation, he thought, seemed
to be prolonging itself unnecessarily.</p>

<p>"There is a greater danger in letting them stagnate and atrophy,"
Lypiatt retorted. "Let me give you my experience." Vehemently,
he gave it.</p>

<p>Out in the gallery, among the boats, the views of the Grand Canal,
and the Firth of Forth, Gumbril placidly ruminated. Poor old Lypiatt,
he was thinking. Dear old Lypiatt, even, in spite of his fantastic
egotism. Such a bad painter, such a bombinating poet, such a loud
emotional improviser on the piano! And going on like this, year
after year, pegging away at the same old things—always badly!
And always without a penny, always living in the most hideous
squalor! Magnificent and pathetic old Lypiatt!</p>

<p>A door suddenly opened and a loud, unsteady voice, now deep and
harsh, now breaking to shrillness, exploded into the gallery.</p>

<p>"... like a Veronese," it was saying; "enormous, vehement, a
great swirling composition" (‘swirling composition’—mentally,
the young assistant made a note of that), "but much more serious,
of course, much more spiritually significant, much more——"</p>

<p>"Lypiatt!" Gumbril had risen from his chair, had turned, had
advanced, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"Why, it’s Gumbril. Good Lord!" and Lypiatt seized the proffered
hand with an excruciating cordiality. He seemed to be in exuberantly
good spirits. "We’re settling about my show, Mr. Albemarle and
I," he explained. "You know Gumbril, Mr. Albemarle?"</p>

<p>"Pleased to meet you," said Mr. Albemarle. "Our friend, Mr. Lypiatt,"
he added richly, "has the true artistic temp——"</p>

<p>"It’s going to be magnificent." Lypiatt could not wait till Mr.
Albemarle had finished speaking. He gave Gumbril a heroic blow
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"... artistic temperament, as I was saying," pursued Mr. Albemarle.
"He is altogether too impatient and enthusiastic for us poor people
..." a ducal smile of condescension accompanied this graceful
act of self-abasement ... "who move in the prosaic, practical,
workaday world."</p>

<p>Lypiatt laughed, a loud, discordant peal. He didn’t seem to mind
being accused of having an artistic temperament; he seemed, indeed,
to enjoy it, if anything. "Fire and water," he said aphoristically,
"brought together, beget steam. Mr. Albemarle and I go driving
along like a steam engine. Psh, psh!" He worked his arms like
a pair of alternate pistons. He laughed; but Mr. Albemarle only
coldly and courteously smiled. "I was just telling Mr. Albemarle
about the great Crucifixion I’ve just been doing. It’s as big
and headlong as a Veronese, but much more serious, more...."</p>

<p>Behind them the little assistant was expounding to a new visitor
the beauties of the etchings. "Very intense," he was saying, "the
feeling in this passage." The shadow, indeed, clung with an insistent
affection round the stern of the boat. "And what a fine, what
a——" he hesitated for an instant, and under his pale, oiled hair
his face became suddenly very red—"what a swirling composition."
He looked anxiously at the visitor. The remark had been received
without comment. He felt immensely relieved.</p>

<p>They left the galleries together. Lypiatt set the pace, striding
along at a great rate and with a magnificent brutality through
the elegant and leisured crowd, gesticulating and loudly talking
as he went. He carried his hat in his hand; his tie was brilliantly
orange. People turned to look at him as he passed and he liked
it. He had, indeed, a remarkable face—a face that ought by rights
to have belonged to a man of genius. Lypiatt was aware of it.
The man of genius, he liked to say, bears upon his brow a kind
of mark of Cain, by which men recognize him at once—"and having
recognized, generally stone him," he would add with that peculiar
laugh he always uttered whenever he said anything rather bitter
or cynical; a laugh that was meant to show that the bitterness,
the cynicism, justifiable as events might have made them, were
really only a mask, and that beneath it the artist was still serenely
and tragically smiling. Lypiatt thought a great deal about the
ideal artist. That titanic abstraction stalked within his own
skin. He was it—a little too consciously, perhaps.</p>

<p>"This time," he kept repeating, "they’ll be bowled over. This
time.... It’s going to be terrific." And with the blood beating
behind his eyes, with the exultant consciousness and certainty
of power growing and growing in him with every word he spoke,
Lypiatt began to describe the pictures there would be at his show;
he talked about the preface he was writing to the catalogue, the
poems that would be printed in it by way of literary complement
to the pictures. He talked, he talked.</p>

<p>Gumbril listened, not very attentively. He was wondering how
any one could talk so loud, could boast so extravagantly. It was
as though the man had to shout in order to convince himself of
his own existence. Poor Lypiatt; after all these years, Gumbril
supposed, he must have some doubts about it. Ah, but this time,
this time he was going to bowl them all over.</p>

<p>"You’re pleased, then, with what you’ve done recently," he said
at the end of one of Lypiatt’s long tirades.</p>

<p>"Pleased?" exclaimed Lypiatt; "I should think I was."</p>

<p>Gumbril might have reminded him that he had been as well pleased
in the past and that ‘they’ had by no means been bowled over.
He preferred, however, to say nothing. Lypiatt went on about the
size and universality of the old masters. He himself, it was tacitly
understood, was one of them.</p>

<p>They parted near the bottom of the Tottenham Court Road, Lypiatt
to go northward to his studio off Maple Street, Gumbril to pay
one of his secret visits to those rooms of his in Great Russell
Street. He had taken them nearly a year ago now, two little rooms
over a grocer’s shop, promising himself goodness only knew what
adventures in them. But somehow there had been no adventures.
Still, it had pleased him, all the same, to be able to go there
from time to time when he was in London and to think, as he sat
in solitude before his gas fire, that there was literally not
a soul in the universe who knew where he was. He had an almost
childish affection for mysteries and secrets.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said Gumbril, raising his hand to the salute. "And
I’ll beat up some people for dinner on Friday." (For they had
agreed to meet again.) He turned away, thinking that he had spoken
the last words; but he was mistaken.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way," said Lypiatt, who had also turned to go, but
who now came stepping quickly after his companion. "Can you, by
any chance, lend me five pounds. Only till after the exhibition,
you know. I’m a bit short."</p>

<p>Poor old Lypiatt! But it was with reluctance that Gumbril parted
from his Treasury notes. </p>
