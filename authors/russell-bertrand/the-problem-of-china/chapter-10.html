<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The Far Eastern situation is so complex that it is very difficult
to guess what will be the ultimate outcome of the Washington Conference,
and still more difficult to know what outcome we ought to desire.
I will endeavour to set forth the various factors each in turn,
not simplifying the issues, but rather aiming at producing a certain
hesitancy which I regard as desirable in dealing with China. I
shall consider successively the interests and desires of America,
Japan, Russia and China, with an attempt, in each case, to gauge
what parts of these various interests and desires are compatible
with the welfare of mankind as a whole.[86]</p>

<p>I begin with America, as the leading spirit in the Conference
and the dominant Power in the world. American public opinion is
in favour of peace, and at the same time profoundly persuaded
that America is wise and virtuous while all other Powers are foolish
and wicked. The pessimistic half of this opinion I do not desire
to dispute, but the optimistic half is more open to question.
Apart from peace, American public opinion believes in commerce
and industry, Protestant morality, athletics, hygiene, and hypocrisy,
which may be taken as the main ingredients of American and English
Kultur. Every American I met in the Far East, with one exception,
was a missionary for American Kultur, whether nominally connected
with Christian Missions or not. I ought to explain that when I
speak of hypocrisy I do not mean the conscious hypocrisy practised
by Japanese diplomats in their dealings with Western Powers, but
that deeper, unconscious kind which forms the chief strength of
the Anglo-Saxons. Everybody knows Labouchere's comment on Mr.
Gladstone, that like other politicians he always had a card up
his sleeve, but, unlike the others, he thought the Lord had put
it there. This attitude, which has been characteristic of England,
has been somewhat chastened among ourselves by the satire of men
like Bernard Shaw; but in America it is still just as prevalent
and self-confident as it was with us fifty years ago. There is
much justification for such an attitude. Gladstonian England was
more of a moral force than the England of the present day; and
America is more of a moral force at this moment than any other
Power (except Russia). But the development from Gladstone's moral
fervour to the cynical imperialism of his successors is one which
we can now see to be inevitable; and a similar development is
bound to take place in the United States. Therefore, when we wish
to estimate the desirability of extending the influence of the
United States, we have to take account of this almost certain
future loss of idealism.</p>

<p>Nor is idealism in itself always an unmixed blessing to its victims.
It is apt to be incompatible with tolerance, with the practice
of live-and-let-live, which alone can make the world endurable
for its less pugnacious and energetic inhabitants. It is difficult
for art or the contemplative outlook to exist in an atmosphere
of bustling practical philanthropy, as difficult as it would be
to write a book in the middle of a spring cleaning. The ideals
which inspire a spring-cleaning are useful and valuable in their
place, but when they are not enriched by any others they are apt
to produce a rather bleak and uncomfortable sort of world.</p>

<p>All this may seem, at first sight, somewhat remote from the Washington
Conference, but it is essential if we are to take a just view
of the friction between America and Japan. I wish to admit at
once that, hitherto, America has been the best friend of China,
and Japan the worst enemy. It is also true that America is doing
more than any other Power to promote peace in the world, while
Japan would probably favour war if there were a good prospect
of victory. On these grounds, I am glad to see our Government
making friends with America and abandoning the militaristic Anglo-Japanese
Alliance. But I do not wish this to be done in a spirit of hostility
to Japan, or in a blind reliance upon the future good intentions
of America. I shall therefore try to state Japan's case, although,
<em>for the present</em>, I think it weaker than America's.</p>

<p>It should be observed, in the first place, that the present American
policy, both in regard to China and in regard to naval armaments,
while clearly good for the world, is quite as clearly in line
with American interests. To take the naval question first: America,
with a navy equal to our own, will be quite strong enough to make
our Admiralty understand that it is out of the question to go
to war with America, so that America will have as much control
of the seas as there is any point in having.[87] The Americans
are adamant about the Japanese Navy, but very pliant about French
submarines, which only threaten us. Control of the seas being
secured, limitation of naval armaments merely decreases the cost,
and is an equal gain to all parties, involving no sacrifice of
American interests. To take next the question of China: American
ambitions in China are economic, and require only that the whole
country should be open to the commerce and industry of the United
States. The policy of spheres of influence is obviously less advantageous,
to so rich and economically strong a country as America, than
the policy of the universal Open Door. We cannot therefore regard
America's liberal policy as regards China and naval armaments
as any reason for expecting a liberal policy when it goes against
self-interest.</p>

<p>In fact, there is evidence that when American interests or prejudices
are involved liberal and humanitarian principles have no weight
whatever. I will cite two instances: Panama tolls, and Russian
trade. In the matter of the Panama canal, America is bound by
treaty not to discriminate against our shipping; nevertheless
a Bill has been passed by a two-thirds majority of the House of
Representatives, making a discrimination in favour of American
shipping. Even if the President ultimately vetoes it, its present
position shows that at least two-thirds of the House of Representatives
share Bethmann-Hollweg's view of treaty obligations. And as for
trade with Russia, England led the way, while American hostility
to the Bolsheviks remained implacable, and to this day Gompers,
in the name of American labour, thunders against "shaking hands
with murder." It cannot therefore be said that America is <em>always</em>
honourable or humanitarian or liberal. The evidence is that America
adopts these virtues when they suit national or rather financial
interests, but fails to perceive their applicability in other
cases.</p>

<p>I could of course have given many other instances, but I content
myself with one, because it especially concerns China. I quote
from an American weekly, The <em>Freeman</em> (November 23, 1921,
p. 244):&mdash;</p>

<p>
On November 1st, the Chinese Government failed to meet an<br/>
obligation of $5,600,000, due and payable to a large<br/>
banking-house in Chicago. The State Department had facilitated<br/>
the negotiation of this loan in the first instance; and now, in<br/>
fulfilment of the promise of Governmental support in an<br/>
emergency, an official cablegram was launched upon Peking, with<br/>
intimations that continued defalcation might have a most serious<br/>
effect upon the financial and political rating of the Chinese<br/>
Republic. In the meantime, the American bankers of the new<br/>
international consortium had offered to advance to the Chinese<br/>
Government an amount which would cover the loan in default,<br/>
together with other obligations already in arrears, and still<br/>
others which will fall due on December 1st; and this proposal had<br/>
also received the full and energetic support of the Department of<br/>
State. That is to say, American financiers and politicians were<br/>
at one and the same time the heroes and villains of the piece;<br/>
having co-operated in the creation of a dangerous situation, they<br/>
came forward handsomely in the hour of trial with an offer to<br/>
save China from themselves as it were, if the Chinese Government<br/>
would only enter into relations with the consortium, and thus<br/>
prepare the way for the eventual establishment of an American<br/>
financial protectorate.

</p>
</div>
<p>It should be added that the Peking Government, after repeated
negotiations, had decided not to accept loans from the consortium
on the terms on which they were offered. In my opinion, there
were very adequate grounds for this decision. As the same article
in the <em>Freeman</em> concludes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
If this plan is put through, it will make the bankers of the<br/>
consortium the virtual owners of China; and among these bankers,<br/>
those of the United States are the only ones who are prepared to<br/>
take full advantage of the situation.

</p>
</div>
<p>There is some reason to think that, at the beginning of the Washington
Conference, an attempt was made by the consortium banks, with
the connivance of the British but not of the American Government,
to establish, by means of the Conference, some measure of international
control over China. In the <em>Japan Weekly Chronicle</em> for
November 17, 1921 (p. 725), in a telegram headed "International
Control of China," I find it reported that America is thought
to be seeking to establish international control, and that Mr.
Wellington Koo told the <em>Philadelphia Public Ledger</em>: "We
suspect the motives which led to the suggestion and we thoroughly
doubt its feasibility. China will bitterly oppose any Conference
plan to offer China international aid." He adds: "International
control will not do. China must be given time and opportunity
to find herself. The world should not misinterpret or exaggerate
the meaning of the convulsion which China is now passing through."
These are wise words, with which every true friend of China must
agree. In the same issue of the <em>Japan Weekly Chronicle</em>&mdash;which,
by the way, I consider the best weekly paper in the world &mdash;I
find the following (p. 728):&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Mr. Lennox Simpson [Putnam Weale] is quoted as saying: "The<br/>
international bankers have a scheme for the international control<br/>
of China. Mr. Lamont, representing the consortium, offered a<br/>
sixteen-million-dollar loan to China, which the Chinese<br/>
Government refused to accept because Mr. Lamont insisted that the<br/>
Hukuang bonds, German issue, which had been acquired by the<br/>
Morgan Company, should be paid out of it." Mr. Lamont, on hearing<br/>
this charge, made an emphatic denial, saying: "Simpson's<br/>
statement is unqualifiedly false. When this man Simpson talks<br/>
about resisting the control of the international banks he is<br/>
fantastic. We don't want control. We are anxious that the<br/>
Conference result in such a solution as will furnish full<br/>
opportunity to China to fulfil her own destiny."

</p>
</div>
<p>Sagacious people will be inclined to conclude that so much anger
must be due to being touched on the raw, and that Mr. Lamont,
if he had had nothing to conceal, would not have spoken of a distinguished
writer and one of China's best friends as "this man Simpson."</p>

<p>I do not pretend that the evidence against the consortium is
conclusive, and I have not space here to set it all forth. But
to any European radical Mr. Lamont's statement that the consortium
does not want control reads like a contradiction in terms. Those
who wish to lend to a Government which is on the verge of bankruptcy,
must aim at control, for, even if there were not the incident
of the Chicago Bank, it would be impossible to believe that Messrs.
Morgan are so purely philanthropic as not to care whether they
get any interest on their money or not, although emissaries of
the consortium in China have spoken as though this were the case,
thereby greatly increasing the suspicions of the Chinese.</p>

<p>In the <em>New Republic</em> for November 30, 1921, there is
an article by Mr. Brailsford entitled "A New Technique of Peace,"
which I fear is prophetic even if not wholly applicable at the
moment when it was written. I expect to see, if the Americans
are successful in the Far East, China compelled to be orderly
so as to afford a field for foreign commerce and industry; a government
which the West will consider good substituted for the present
go-as-you-please anarchy; a gradually increasing flow of wealth
from China to the investing countries, the chief of which is America;
the development of a sweated proletariat; the spread of Christianity;
the substitution of the American civilization for the Chinese;
the destruction of traditional beauty, except for such <em>objets
d'art</em> as millionaires may think it worth while to buy; the
gradual awakening of China to her exploitation by the foreigner;
and one day, fifty or a hundred years hence, the massacre of every
white man throughout the Celestial Empire at a signal from some
vast secret society. All this is probably inevitable, human nature
being what it is. It will be done in order that rich men may grow
richer, but we shall be told that it is done in order that China
may have "good" government. The definition of the word "good"
is difficult, but the definition of "good government" is as easy
as <em>A.B.C.: </em>it is government that yields fat dividends
to capitalists.</p>

<p>The Chinese are gentle, urbane, seeking only justice and freedom.
They have a civilization superior to ours in all that makes for
human happiness. They have a vigorous movement of young reformers,
who, if they are allowed a little time, will revivify China and
produce something immeasurably better than the worn-out grinding
mechanism that we call civilization. When Young China has done
its work, Americans will be able to make money by trading with
China, without destroying the soul of the country. China needs
a period of anarchy in order to work out her salvation; all great
nations need such a period, from time to time. When America went
through such a period, in 1861-5, England thought of intervening
to insist on "good government," but fortunately abstained. Now-a-days,
in China, all the Powers want to intervene. Americans recognize
this in the case of the wicked Old World, but are smitten with
blindness when it comes to their own consortium. All I ask of
them is that they should admit that they are as other men, and
cease to thank God that they are not as this publican.</p>

<p>So much by way of criticism by America; we come now to the defence
of Japan.</p>

<p>Japan's relations with the Powers are not of her own seeking;
all that Japan asked of the world was to be let alone. This, however,
did not suit the white nations, among whom America led the way.
It was a United States squadron under Commodore Perry that first
made Japan aware of Western aggressiveness. Very soon it became
evident that there were only two ways of dealing with the white
man, either to submit to him, or to fight him with his own weapons.
Japan adopted the latter course, and developed a modern army trained
by the Germans, a modern navy modelled on the British, modern
machinery derived from America, and modern morals copied from
the whole lot. Everybody except the British was horrified, and
called the Japanese "yellow monkeys." However, they began to be
respected when they defeated Russia, and after they had captured
Tsing-tao and half-enslaved China they were admitted to equality
with the other Great Powers at Versailles. The consideration shown
to them by the West is due to their armaments alone; none of their
other good qualities would have saved them from being regarded
as "niggers."</p>

<p>People who have never been outside Europe can hardly imagine
the intensity of the colour prejudice that white men develop when
brought into contact with any different pigmentation. I have seen
Chinese of the highest education, men as cultured as (say) Dean
Inge, treated by greasy white men as if they were dirt, in a way
in which, at home, no Duke would venture to treat a crossing-sweeper.
The Japanese are not treated in this way, because they have a
powerful army and navy. The fact that white men, as individuals,
no longer dare to bully individual Japanese, is important as a
beginning of better relations towards the coloured races in general.
If the Japanese, by defeat in war, are prevented from retaining
the status of a Great Power, the coloured races in general will
suffer, and the tottering insolence of the white man will be re-established.
Also the world will have lost the last chance of the survival
of civilizations of a different type from that of the industrial
West.</p>

<p>The civilization of Japan, in its material aspect, is similar
to that of the West, though industrialism, as yet, is not very
developed. But in its mental aspect it is utterly unlike the West,
particularly the Anglo-Saxon West. Worship of the Mikado, as an
actually divine being, is successfully taught in every village
school, and provides the popular support for nationalism. The
nationalistic aims of Japan are not merely economic; they are
also dynastic and territorial in a mediæval way. The morality
of the Japanese is not utilitarian, but intensely idealistic.
Filial piety is the basis, and includes patriotism, because the
Mikado is the father of his people. The Japanese outlook has the
same kind of superstitious absence of realism that one finds in
thirteenth-century theories as to the relations of the Emperor
and the Pope. But in Europe the Emperor and the Pope were different
people, and their quarrels promoted freedom of thought; in Japan,
since 1868, they are combined in one sacred person, and there
are no internal conflicts to produce doubt.</p>

<p>Japan, unlike China, is a religious country. The Chinese doubt
a proposition until it is proved to be true; the Japanese believe
it until it is proved to be false. I do not know of any evidence
against the view that the Mikado is divine. Japanese religion
is essentially nationalistic, like that of the Jews in the Old
Testament. Shinto, the State religion, has been in the main invented
since 1868,[88] and propagated by education in schools. (There
was of course an old Shinto religion, but most of what constitutes
modern Shintoism is new.) It is not a religion which aims at being
universal, like Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam; it is a tribal
religion, only intended to appeal to the Japanese. Buddhism subsists
side by side with it, and is believed by the same people. It is
customary to adopt Shinto rites for marriages and Buddhist rites
for funerals, because Buddhism is considered more suitable for
mournful occasions. Although Buddhism is a universal religion,
its Japanese form is intensely national,[89] like the Church of
England. Many of its priests marry, and in some temples the priesthood
is hereditary. Its dignitaries remind one vividly of English Archdeacons.</p>

<p>The Japanese, even when they adopt industrial methods, do not
lose their sense of beauty. One hears complaints that their goods
are shoddy, but they have a remarkable power of adapting artistic
taste to industrialism. If Japan were rich it might produce cities
as beautiful as Venice, by methods as modern as those of New York.
Industrialism has hitherto brought with it elsewhere a rising
tide of ugliness, and any nation which can show us how to make
this tide recede deserves our gratitude.</p>

<p>The Japanese are earnest, passionate, strong-willed, amazingly
hard working, and capable of boundless sacrifice to an ideal.
Most of them have the correlative defects: lack of humour, cruelty,
intolerance, and incapacity for free thought. But these defects
are by no means universal; one meets among them a certain number
of men and women of quite extraordinary excellence. And there
is in their civilization as a whole a degree of vigour and determination
which commands the highest respect.</p>

<p>The growth of industrialism in Japan has brought with it the
growth of Socialism and the Labour movement.[90] In China, the
intellectuals are often theoretical Socialists, but in the absence
of Labour organizations there is as yet little room for more than
theory. In Japan, Trade Unionism has made considerable advances,
and every variety of socialist and anarchist opinion is vigorously
represented. In time, if Japan becomes increasingly industrial,
Socialism may become a political force; as yet, I do not think
it is. Japanese Socialists resemble those of other countries,
in that they do not share the national superstitions. They are
much persecuted by the Government, but not so much as Socialists
in America&mdash;so at least I am informed by an American who is in
a position to judge.</p>

<p>The real power is still in the hands of certain aristocratic
families. By the constitution, the Ministers of War and Marine
are directly responsible to the Mikado, not to the Diet or the
Prime Minister. They therefore can and do persist in policies
which are disliked by the Foreign Office. For example, if the
Foreign Office were to promise the evacuation of Vladivostok,
the War Office might nevertheless decide to keep the soldiers
there, and there would be no constitutional remedy. Some part,
at least, of what appears as Japanese bad faith is explicable
in this way. There is of course a party which wishes to establish
real Parliamentary government, but it is not likely to come into
power unless the existing régime suffers some severe diplomatic
humiliation. If the Washington Conference had compelled the evacuation
of not only Shantung but also Vladivostok by diplomatic pressure,
the effect on the internal government of Japan would probably
have been excellent.</p>

<p>The Japanese are firmly persuaded that they have no friends,
and that the Americana are their implacable foes. One gathers
that the Government regards war with America as unavoidable in
the long run. The argument would be that the economic imperialism
of the United States will not tolerate the industrial development
of a formidable rival in the Pacific, and that sooner or later
the Japanese will be presented with the alternative of dying by
starvation or on the battlefield. Then Bushido will come into
play, and will lead to choice of the battlefield in preference
to starvation. Admiral Sato[91] (the Japanese Bernhardi, as he
is called) maintains that absence of Bushido in the Americans
will lead to their defeat, and that their money-grubbing souls
will be incapable of enduring the hardships and privations of
a long war. This, of course, is romantic nonsense. Bushido is
no use in modern war, and the Americans are quite as courageous
and obstinate as the Japanese. A war might last ten years, but
it would certainly end in the defeat of Japan.</p>

<p>One is constantly reminded of the situation between England and
Germany in the years before 1914. The Germans wanted to acquire
a colonial empire by means similar to those which we had employed;
so do the Japanese. We considered such methods wicked when employed
by foreigners; so do the Americans. The Germans developed their
industries and roused our hostility by competition; the Japanese
are similarly competing with America in Far Eastern markets. The
Germans felt themselves encircled by our alliances, which we regarded
as purely defensive; the Japanese, similarly, found themselves
isolated at Washington (except for French sympathy) since the
superior diplomatic skill of the Americans has brought us over
to their side. The Germans at last, impelled by terrors largely
of their own creation, challenged the whole world, and fell; it
is very much to be feared that Japan may do likewise. The pros
and cons are so familiar in the case of Germany that I need not
elaborate them further, since the whole argument can be transferred
bodily to the case of Japan. There is, however, this difference,
that, while Germany aimed at hegemony of the whole world, the
Japanese only aim at hegemony in Eastern Asia.</p>

<p>The conflict between America and Japan is superficially economic,
but, as often happens, the economic rivalry is really a cloak
for deeper passions. Japan still believes in the divine right
of kings; America believes in the divine right of commerce. I
have sometimes tried to persuade Americans that there may be nations
which will not gain by an extension of their foreign commerce,
but I have always found the attempt futile. The Americans believe
also that their religion and morality and culture are far superior
to those of the Far East. I regard this as a delusion, though
one shared by almost all Europeans. The Japanese, profoundly and
with all the strength of their being, long to preserve their own
culture and to avoid becoming like Europeans or Americans; and
in this I think we ought to sympathize with them. The colour prejudice
is even more intense among Americans than among Europeans; the
Japanese are determined to prove that the yellow man may be the
equal of the white man. In this, also, justice and humanity are
on the side of Japan. Thus on the deeper issues, which underlie
the economic and diplomatic conflict, my feelings go with the
Japanese rather than with the Americans.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Japanese are always putting themselves in
the wrong through impatience and contempt. They ought to have
claimed for China the same consideration that they have extorted
towards themselves; then they could have become, what they constantly
profess to be, the champions of Asia against Europe. The Chinese
are prone to gratitude, and would have helped Japan loyally if
Japan had been a true friend to them. But the Japanese despise
the Chinese more than the Europeans do; they do not want to destroy
the belief in Eastern inferiority, but only to be regarded as
themselves belonging to the West. They have therefore behaved
so as to cause a well-deserved hatred of them in China. And this
same behaviour has made the best Americans as hostile to them
as the worst. If America had had none but base reasons for hostility
to them, they would have found many champions in the United States;
as it is, they have practically none. It is not yet too late;
it is still possible for them to win the affection of China and
the respect of the best Americans. To achieve this, they would
have to change their Chinese policy and adopt a more democratic
constitution; but if they do not achieve it, they will fall as
Germany fell. And their fall will be a great misfortune for mankind.</p>

<p>A war between America and Japan would be a very terrible thing
in itself, and a still more terrible thing in its consequences.
It would destroy Japanese civilization, ensure the subjugation
of China to Western culture, and launch America upon a career
of world-wide militaristic imperialism. It is therefore, at all
costs, to be avoided. If it is to be avoided, Japan must become
more liberal; and Japan will only become more liberal if the present
régime is discredited by failure. Therefore, in the interests
of Japan no less than in the interests of China, it would be well
if Japan were forced, by the joint diplomatic pressure of England
and America, to disgorge, not only Shantung, but also all of Manchuria
except Port Arthur and its immediate neighbourhood. (I make this
exception because I think nothing short of actual war would lead
the Japanese to abandon Port Arthur.) Our Alliance with Japan,
since the end of the Russo-Japanese war, has been an encouragement
to Japan in all that she has done amiss. Not that Japan has been
worse than we have, but that certain kinds of crime are only permitted
to very great Powers, and have been committed by the Japanese
at an earlier stage of their career than prudence would warrant.
Our Alliance has been a contributory cause of Japan's mistakes,
and the ending of the Alliance is a necessary condition of Japanese
reform.</p>

<p>We come now to Russia's part in the Chinese problem. There is
a tendency in Europe to regard Russia as decrepit, but this is
a delusion. True, millions are starving and industry is at a standstill.
But that does not mean what it would in a more highly organized
country. Russia is still able to steal a march on us in Persia
and Afghanistan, and on the Japanese in Outer Mongolia. Russia
is still able to organize Bolshevik propaganda in every country
in Asia. And a great part of the effectiveness of this propaganda
lies in its promise of liberation from Europe. So far, in China
proper, it has affected hardly anyone except the younger students,
to whom Bolshevism appeals as a method of developing industry
without passing through the stage of private capitalism. This
appeal will doubtless diminish as the Bolsheviks are more and
more forced to revert to capitalism. Moreover, Bolshevism, as
it has developed in Russia, is quite peculiarly inapplicable to
China, for the following reasons: (1) It requires a strong centralized
State, whereas China has a very weak State, and is tending more
and more to federalism instead of centralization; (2) Bolshevism
requires a very great deal of government, and more control of
individual lives by the authorities than has ever been known before,
whereas China has developed personal liberty to an extraordinary
degree, and is the country of all others where the doctrines of
anarchism seem to find successful practical application; (3) Bolshevism
dislikes private trading, which is the breath of life to all Chinese
except the literati. For these reasons, it is not likely that
Bolshevism as a creed will make much progress in China proper.
But Bolshevism as a political force is not the same thing as Bolshevism
as a creed. The arguments which proved successful with the Ameer
of Afghanistan or the nomads of Mongolia were probably different
from those employed in discussion with Mr. Lansbury. The Asiatic
expansion of Bolshevik influence is not a distinctively Bolshevik
phenomenon, but a continuation of traditional Russian policy,
carried on by men who are more energetic, more intelligent, and
less corrupt than the officials of the Tsar's régime, and who
moreover, like the Americans, believe themselves to be engaged
in the liberation of mankind, not in mere imperialistic expansion.
This belief, of course, adds enormously to the vigour and success
of Bolshevik imperialism, and gives an impulse to Asiatic expansion
which is not likely to be soon spent, unless there is an actual
restoration of the Tsarist régime under some new Kolchak dependent
upon alien arms for his throne and his life.</p>

<p>It is therefore not at all unlikely, if the international situation
develops in certain ways, that Russia may set to work to regain
Manchuria, and to recover that influence over Peking which the
control of Manchuria is bound to give to any foreign Power. It
would probably be useless to attempt such an enterprise while
Japan remains unembarrassed, but it would at once become feasible
if Japan were at war with America or with Great Britain. There
is therefore nothing improbable in the supposition that Russia
may, within the next ten or twenty years, recover the position
which she held in relation to China before the Russo-Japanese
war. It must be remembered also that the Russians have an instinct
for colonization, and have been trekking eastward for centuries.
This tendency has been interrupted by the disasters of the last
seven years, but is likely to assert itself again before long.</p>

<p>The hegemony of Russia in Asia would not, to my mind, be in any
way regrettable. Russia would probably not be strong enough to
tyrannize as much as the English, the Americans, or the Japanese
would do. Moreover, the Russians are sufficiently Asiatic in outlook
and character to be able to enter into relations of equality and
mutual understanding with Asiatics, in a way which seems quite
impossible for the English-speaking nations. And an Asiatic block,
if it could be formed, would be strong for defence and weak for
attack, which would make for peace. Therefore, on the whole, such
a result, if it came about, would probably be desirable In the
interests of mankind as a whole.</p>

<p>What, meanwhile, is China's interest? What would be ideally best
for China would be to recover Manchuria and Shantung, and then
be let alone. The anarchy in China might take a long time to subside,
but in the end some system suited to China would be established.
The artificial ending of Chinese anarchy by outside interference
means the establishment of some system convenient for foreign
trade and industry, but probably quite unfitted to the needs of
the Chinese themselves. The English in the seventeenth century,
the French in the eighteenth, the Americans in the nineteenth,
and the Russians in our own day, have passed through years of
anarchy and civil war, which were essential to their development,
and could not have been curtailed by outside interference without
grave detriment to the final solution. So it is with China. Western
political ideas have swept away the old imperial system, but have
not yet proved strong enough to put anything stable in its place.
The problem of transforming China into a modern country is a difficult
one, and foreigners ought to be willing to have some patience
while the Chinese attempt its solution. They understand their
own country, and we do not. If they are let alone, they will,
in the end, find a solution suitable to their character, which
we shall certainly not do. A solution slowly reached by themselves
may be stable, whereas one prematurely imposed by outside Powers
will be artificial and therefore unstable.</p>

<p>There is, however, very little hope that the decisions reached
by the Washington Conference will permanently benefit China, and
a considerable chance that they may do quite the reverse. In Manchuria
the <em>status quo</em> is to be maintained, while in Shantung
the Japanese have made concessions, the value of which only time
can show. The Four Powers &mdash;America, Great Britain, France,
and Japan&mdash;have agreed to exploit China in combination, not competitively.
There is a consortium as regards loans, which will have the power
of the purse and will therefore be the real Government of China.
As the Americans are the only people who have much spare capital,
they will control the consortium. As they consider their civilization
the finest in the world, they will set to work to turn the Chinese
into muscular Christians. As the financiers are the most splendid
feature of the American civilization, China must be so governed
as to enrich the financiers, who will in return establish colleges
and hospitals and <em>Y.M.C.A.'</em>s throughout the length and
breadth of the land, and employ agents to buy up the artistic
treasures of China for sepulture in their mansions. Chinese intellect,
like that of America, will be, directly or indirectly, in the
pay of the Trust magnates, and therefore no effective voice will
be, raised in favour of radical reform. The inauguration of this
system will be welcomed even by some Socialists in the West as
a great victory for peace and freedom.</p>

<p>But it is impossible to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear,
or peace and freedom out of capitalism. The fourfold agreement
between England, France, America and Japan is, perhaps, a safeguard
of peace, but in so far as it brings peace nearer it puts freedom
further off. It is the peace obtained when competing firms join
in a combine, which is by no means always advantageous to those
who have profited by the previous competition. It is quite possible
to dominate China without infringing the principle of the Open
Door. This principle merely ensures that the domination everywhere
shall be American, because America is the strongest Power financially
and commercially. It is to America's interest to secure, in China,
certain things consistent with Chinese interests, and certain
others inconsistent with them. The Americans, for the sake of
commerce and good investments, would wish to see a stable government
in China, an increase in the purchasing power of the people, and
an absence of territorial aggression by other Powers. But they
will not wish to see the Chinese strong enough to own and work
their own railways or mines, and they will resent all attempts
at economic independence, particularly when (as is to be expected)
they take the form of State Socialism, or what Lenin calls State
Capitalism. They will keep a <em>dossier</em> of every student
educated in colleges under American control, and will probably
see to it that those who profess Socialist or Radical opinions
shall get no posts. They will insist upon the standard of hypocrisy
which led them to hound out Gorky when he visited the United States.
They will destroy beauty and substitute tidiness. In short, they
will insist upon China becoming as like as possible to "God's
own country," except that it will not be allowed to keep the wealth
generated by its industries. The Chinese have it in them to give
to the world a new contribution to civilization as valuable as
that which they gave in the past. This would be prevented by the
domination of the Americans, because they believe their own civilization
to be perfect.</p>

<p>The ideal of capitalism, if it could be achieved, would be to
destroy competition among capitalists by means of Trusts, but
to keep alive competition among workers. To some extent Trade
Unionism has succeeded in diminishing competition among wage-earners
within the advanced industrial countries; but it has only intensified
the conflict between workers of different races, particularly
between the white and yellow races.[92] Under the existing economic
system, the competition of cheap Asiatic labour in America, Canada
or Australia might well be harmful to white labour in those countries.
But under Socialism an influx of industrious, skilled workers
in sparsely populated countries would be an obvious gain to everybody.
Under Socialism, the immigration of any person who produces more
than he or she consumes will be a gain to every other individual
in the community, since it increases the wealth per head. But
under capitalism, owing to competition for jobs, a worker who
either produces much or consumes little is the natural enemy of
the others; thus the system makes for inefficient work, and creates
an opposition between the general interest and the individual
interest of the wage-earner. The case of yellow labour in America
and the British Dominions is one of the most unfortunate instances
of the artificial conflicts of interest produced by the capitalist
system. This whole question of Asiatic immigration, which is liable
to cause trouble for centuries to come, can only be radically
solved by Socialism, since Socialism alone can bring the private
interests of workers in this matter into harmony with the interests
of their nation and of the world.</p>

<p>The concentration of the world's capital in a few nations, which,
by means of it, are able to drain all other nations of their wealth,
is obviously not a system by which permanent peace can be secured
except through the complete subjection of the poorer nations.
In the long run, China will see no reason to leave the profits
of industry in the hands of foreigners. If, for the present, Russia
is successfully starved into submission to foreign capital, Russia
also will, when the time is ripe, attempt a new rebellion against
the world-empire of finance. I cannot see, therefore, any establishment
of a stable world-system as a result of the syndicate formed at
Washington. On the contrary, we may expect that, when Asia has
thoroughly assimilated our economic system, the Marxian class-war
will break out in the form of a war between Asia and the West,
with America as the protagonist of capitalism, and Russia as the
champion of Asia and Socialism. In such a war, Asia would be fighting
for freedom, but probably too late to preserve the distinctive
civilizations which now make Asia valuable to the human family.
Indeed, the war would probably be so devastating that no civilization
of any sort would survive it.</p>

<p>To sum up: the real government of the world is in the hands of
the big financiers, except on questions which rouse passionate
public interest. No doubt the exclusion of Asiatics from America
and the Dominions is due to popular pressure, and is against the
interests of big finance. But not many questions rouse so much
popular feeling, and among them only a few are sufficiently simple
to be incapable of misrepresentation in the interests of the capitalists.
Even in such a case as Asiatic immigration, it is the capitalist
system which causes the anti-social interests of wage-earners
and makes them illiberal. The existing system makes each man's
individual interest opposed, in some vital point, to the interest
of the whole. And what applies to individuals applies also to
nations; under the existing economic system, a nation's interest
is seldom the same as that of the world at large, and then only
by accident. International peace might conceivably be secured
under the present system, but only by a combination of the strong
to exploit the weak. Such a combination is being attempted as
the outcome of Washington; but it can only diminish, in the long
run, the little freedom now enjoyed by the weaker nations. The
essential evil of the present system, as Socialists have pointed
out over and over again, is production for profit instead of for
use. A man or a company or a nation produces goods, not in order
to consume them, but in order to sell them. Hence arise competition
and exploitation and all the evils, both in internal labour problems
and in international relations. The development of Chinese commerce
by capitalistic methods means an increase, for the Chinese, in
the prices of the things they export, which are also the things
they chiefly consume, and the artificial stimulation of new needs
for foreign goods, which places China at the mercy of those who
supply these goods, destroys the existing contentment, and generates
a feverish pursuit of purely material ends. In a socialistic world,
production will be regulated by the same authority which represents
the needs of the consumers, and the whole business of competitive
buying and selling will cease. Until then, it is possible to have
peace by submission to exploitation, or some degree of freedom
by continual war, but it is not possible to have both peace and
freedom. The success of the present American policy may, for a
time, secure peace, but will certainly not secure freedom for
the weaker nations, such as Chinese. Only international Socialism
can secure both; and owing to the stimulation of revolt by capitalist
oppression, even peace alone can never be secure until international
Socialism is established throughout the world.</p>

illustrated by the following telegram which appeared in <em>The

"A deputation of shipwrights and allied trades complained to Mr.
Hughes, the Prime Minister, that four Commonwealth ships had been
repaired at Antwerp instead of in Australia, and that two had
been repaired in India by black labour receiving eight annas (8d.)
a day. When the deputation reached the black labour allegation
Mr. Hughes jumped from his chair and turned on his interviewers
with, 'Black labour be damned. Go to blithering blazes. Don't
talk to me about black labour.' Hurrying from the room, he pushed
his way through the deputation...." I do not generally agree with
Mr. Hughes, but on this occasion, deeply as I deplore his language,
I find myself in agreement with his sentiments, assuming that
the phrase "black labour be damned" is meant to confer a blessing.]</p>
