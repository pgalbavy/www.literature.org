<p>"Arrest him!" commanded General Yozarro, speaking directly to
Colonel Carlos Del Valle, his chief of staff, standing next to
the American; "put him in irons."</p>

<p>The officer addressed reached out his hand to lay on the shoulder
of Jack Starland, who, at that instant, recalled the knockout
blow he had given Cadet Hillman of the First Class, one memorable
spring morning at old Fort Putnam, West Point. It was the same
lightning-like stroke which crashed into the face of the colonel
and sent him staggering and toppling back to the opposite side
of the cabin. Then, whipping out his revolver, Starland backed
from the cabin, ran down the steps to the bow of the boat, and
before any one suspected his purpose, shouted to his own executive
officer:</p>

<p>"Captain Winton, I am betrayed! Open fire, and sink this tug!"</p>

<p>Then he wheeled about and with leveled weapon, added:</p>

<p>"I will kill the first man who attempts to lay a finger on me!"</p>

<p>General Yozarro and his officers showed more promptitude than
would have been expected. Seeing that a conflict was inevitable,
they set out to win by their own quickness. Their armament was
heavier than that of the American yacht,&mdash;that is to say, though
his pieces carried smaller missiles, he had two of them, while
that of the <em>Warrenia</em> was a brass saluting twelve-pounder.</p>

<p>The port gun was slewed around and pointed at the other craft,
now within twenty-five yards, and in a twinkling it bore fairly.</p>

<p>"Fire!" shouted the excited General, too savage to regard the
usual preliminaries.</p>

<p>Major Starland shuddered, for he saw the gun seemingly directed
true and knew it must do great destruction on his yacht. The gunner
snapped the lanyard, but a dull click followed and there was no
discharge.</p>

<p>General Yozarro uttered an oath and Captain Ortega called from
the pilot house:</p>

<p>"That is the one which was not loaded!"</p>

<p>Jack Starland had forgotten the fact in the flurry of the moment.
He smiled and looked across at his own boat. Captain Winton did
not throw away a second. He signalled to the engine room, quickly
veered, and the brass twelve-pounder was pointed fairly at the
tug. Meantime, by working frantically, the gunners quickly loaded
the piece on the Atlamalcan craft and swung it around to bear
on the other.</p>

<p>"Look out for the Major!" called Captain Winton; "he is standing
at the front."</p>

<p>While the native gunners were awaiting the critical second, there
was a white puff, a red belch of flame, and a thunderous report
rolled over the river and against the shores. A smashing sound,
the splintering of wood and a number of yells followed, the ball
having torn its way through the cabin and splashed into the river
beyond.</p>

<p>In this crisis, General Yozarro displayed unexpected coolness.
General Bambos hurriedly sagged down behind the pile of wood at
the front, as if mortally hurt, but he was merely taking precautions
against becoming so.</p>

<p>"Quick!" roared General Yozarro; "sink their boat!"</p>

<p>The haste was unwise, for the gunners were not wholly lacking
in skill, but they were flustered by the furious orders of their
brutal chief, and fired sooner than they intended. It would have
seemed that with so brief a distance separating the combatants
a miss was impossible; but the heavy missile only grazed the foremast,
dropping somewhere among the trees on the southern shore.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted the delighted Major, swinging his hat; "let
the good work go on! Keep it up! The Stars and Stripes forever!"</p>

<p>Colonel Del Valle had recovered from the fierce blow that sent
him spinning across the cabin and was aflame with anger. He, too,
had a revolver, and, heedless of the wild turmoil and confusion,
in which a half dozen were injured by the flying splinters, he
sneaked forward toward the hurrahing American. He raised his hand
tremulous with fury, and sighting as well as he could through
his watery, bloody eyes, let fly.</p>

<p>The crack of the weapon amid the tumult caused Major Starland
to turn like a flash. He saw he had forgotten himself, and that
in all probability he had a fight on his hands.</p>

<p>"I don't want to kill you, Colonel, but you need a lesson."</p>

<p>The officer was backing away, when at the flash of the other
weapon, he uttered a howl and skurried into the cabin with his
right arm dangling useless. The American saw his pistol fall,
and darting forward, picked it up. He now had two revolvers, and
with only a single empty chamber in each. He backed against the
pile of wood, to prevent any one getting behind him, and confronted
the mob. Moreover, it was necessary that his friends should see
where he was in order to avoid harming him.</p>

<p>A gun on each boat had been fired, and it now became a race as
to which could reload and fire again. The American won, because
of a slight advantage at the start. No attempt was made on the
tugboat to bring the second piece into action. The captains of
each craft displayed admirable skill. Captain Winton tried to
keep out of range of his enemy, but Captain Ortega swung around
so as to hold him in direct line all the time.</p>

<p>Starland's mate and one of his seamen were handling the cannon
on the yacht. The latter had served at Manila and knew his business.
As cool as if taking part in the naval maneuvers, he waited until
sure the second shot would do the business. Without giving heed
to the crew striving desperately to bring the other gun to bear,
he crouched till the gun was pointed exactly right and then blazed
away.</p>

<p>He had aimed at the screw of the tugboat and he struck it so
fairly that the stem snapped off and the blades dropped to the
bottom of the river. This was at the suggestion of the mate, who,
not wishing to kill any one, only sought to put the other craft
out of action.</p>

<p>It was done. The tug was as helpless as a log, but not until
Captain Ortega called from the pilot house, making known the nature
of the disaster, did General Yozarro understand the mortal injury
his navy had received.</p>

<p>"Bully!" shouted the Major; "put the next shot through her boiler!
Don't mind me! I can swim and don't care for a little thing like
being blown up!"</p>

<p>General Bambos heard the terrifying news and climbed tremblingly
to his feet.</p>

<p>"Don't let them fire again! We shall all be killed!"</p>

<p>"Only one thing can save you," replied the Major aglow with the
light of triumphant battle; "run up the white flag! The next shot
will send you to kingdom come!"</p>

<p>It was General Yozarro, who, catching the panic, whipped out
his white silken handkerchief, and standing within arm's length
of his prisoner, excitedly fluttered it aloft.</p>

<p>"Cease firing!" commanded Major Starland; "they have surrendered!"</p>
