<p>"It is really remarkable, Velmont, what a close resemblance you
bear to Arsène Lupin!"</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Oh! like everyone else, from photographs, no two of which are
alike, but each of them leaves the impression of a face.... something
like yours."</p>

<p>Horace Velmont displayed some vexation.</p>

<p>"Quite so, my dear Devanne. And, believe me, you are not the
first one who has noticed it."</p>

<p>"It is so striking," persisted Devanne, "that if you had not
been recommended to me by my cousin d’Estevan, and if you were
not the celebrated artist whose beautiful marine views I so admire,
I have no doubt I should have warned the police of your presence
in Dieppe."</p>

<p>This sally was greeted with an outburst of laughter. The large
dining-hall of the Château de Thibermesnil contained on this occasion,
besides Velmont, the following guests: Father Gélis, the parish
priest, and a dozen officers whose regiments were quartered in
the vicinity and who had accepted the invitation of the banker
Georges Devanne and his mother. One of the officers then remarked:</p>

<p>"I understand that an exact description of Arsène Lupin has been
furnished to all the police along this coast since his daring
exploit on the Paris-Havre express."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Devanne. "That was three months ago; and
a week later, I made the acquaintance of our friend Velmont at
the casino, and, since then, he has honored me with several visits&mdash;an
agreeable preamble to a more serious visit that he will pay me
one of these days&mdash;or, rather, one of these nights."</p>

<p>This speech evoked another round of laughter, and the guests
then passed into the ancient "Hall of the Guards," a vast room
with a high ceiling, which occupied the entire lower part of the
Tour Guillaume &mdash;William’s Tower&mdash;and wherein Georges Devanne
had collected the incomparable treasures which the lords of Thibermesnil
had accumulated through many centuries. It contained ancient chests,
credences, andirons and chandeliers. The stone walls were overhung
with magnificent tapestries. The deep embrasures of the four windows
were furnished with benches, and the Gothic windows were composed
of small panes of colored glass set in a leaden frame. Between
the door and the window to the left stood an immense bookcase
of Renaissance style, on the pediment of which, in letters of
gold, was the word "Thibermesnil," and, below it, the proud family
device: "Fais ce que veulx" (Do what thou wishest). When the guests
had lighted their cigars, Devanne resumed the conversation.</p>

<p>"And remember, Velmont, you have no time to lose; in fact, to-night
is the last chance you will have."</p>

<p>"How so?" asked the painter, who appeared to regard the affair
as a joke. Devanne was about to reply, when his mother mentioned
to him to keep silent, but the excitement of the occasion and
a desire to interest his guests urged him to speak.</p>

<p>"Bah!" he murmured. "I can tell it now. It won’t do any harm."</p>

<p>The guests drew closer, and he commenced to speak with the satisfied
air of a man who has an important announcement to make.</p>

<p>"To-morrow afternoon at four o’clock, Sherlock Holmes, the famous
English detective, for whom such a thing as mystery does not exist;
Sherlock Holmes, the most remarkable solver of enigmas the world
has ever known, that marvelous man who would seem to be the creation
of a romantic novelist &mdash;Sherlock Holmes will be my guest!"</p>

<p>Immediately, Devanne was the target of numerous eager questions.
"Is Sherlock Holmes really coming?" "Is it so serious as that?"
"Is Arsène Lupin really in this neighborhood?"</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin and his band are not far away. Besides the robbery
of the Baron Cahorn, he is credited with the thefts at Montigny,
Gruchet and Crasville. And now it is my turn."</p>

<p>"Has he sent you a warning, as he did to Baron Cahorn?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Devanne, "he can’t work the same trick twice."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"I will show you."</p>

<p>He rose, and pointing to a small empty space between the two
enormous folios on one of the shelves of the bookcase, he said:</p>

<p>"There used to be a book there&mdash;a book of the sixteenth century
entitled ‘Chronique de Thibermesnil,’ which contained the history
of the castle since its construction by Duke Rollo on the site
of a former feudal fortress. There were three engraved plates
in the book; one of which was a general view of the whole estate;
another, the plan of the buildings; and the third &mdash;I call
your attention to it, particularly&mdash;the third was the sketch of
a subterranean passage, an entrance to which is outside the first
line of ramparts, while the other end of the passage is here,
in this very room. Well, that book disappeared a month ago."</p>

<p>"The deuce!" said Velmont, "that looks bad. But it doesn’t seem
to be a sufficient reason for sending for Sherlock Holmes."</p>

<p>"Certainly, that was not sufficient in itself, but another incident
happened that gives the disappearance of the book a special significance.
There was another copy of this book in the National Library at
Paris, and the two books differed in certain details relating
to the subterranean passage; for instance, each of them contained
drawings and annotations, not printed, but written in ink and
more or less effaced. I knew those facts, and I knew that the
exact location of the passage could be determined only by a comparison
of the two books. Now, the day after my book disappeared, the
book was called for in the National Library by a reader who carried
it away, and no one knows how the theft was effected."</p>

<p>The guests uttered many exclamations of surprise.</p>

<p>"Certainly, the affair looks serious," said one.</p>

<p>"Well, the police investigated the matter, and, as usual, discovered
no clue whatever."</p>

<p>"They never do, when Arsène Lupin is concerned in it."</p>

<p>"Exactly; and so I decided to ask the assistance of Sherlock
Holmes, who replied that he was ready and anxious to enter the
lists with Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>"What glory for Arsène Lupin!" said Velmont. "But if our national
thief, as they call him, has no evil designs on your castle, Sherlock
Holmes will have his trip in vain."</p>

<p>"There are other things that will interest him, such as the discovery
of the subterranean passage."</p>

<p>"But you told us that one end of the passage was outside the
ramparts and the other was in this very room!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but in what part of the room? The line which represents
the passage on the charts ends here, with a small circle marked
with the letters ‘<em>T.G.,’ </em>which no doubt stand for ‘Tour
Guillaume.’ But the tower is round, and who can tell the exact
spot at which the passage touches the tower?"</p>

<p>Devanne lighted a second cigar and poured himself a glass of
Benedictine. His guests pressed him with questions and he was
pleased to observe the interest that his remarks had created.
Then he continued:</p>

<p>"The secret is lost. No one knows it. The legend is to the effect
that the former lords of the castle transmitted the secret from
father to son on their deathbeds, until Geoffroy, the last of
the race, was beheaded during the Revolution in his nineteenth
year."</p>

<p>"That is over a century ago. Surely, someone has looked for it
since that time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but they failed to find it. After I purchased the castle,
I made a diligent search for it, but without success. You must
remember that this tower is surrounded by water and connected
with the castle only by a bridge; consequently, the passage must
be underneath the old moat. The plan that was in the book in the
National Library showed a series of stairs with a total of forty-eight
steps, which indicates a depth of more than ten meters. You see,
the mystery lies within the walls of this room, and yet I dislike
to tear them down."</p>

<p>"Is there nothing to show where it is?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Mon. Devanne, we should turn our attention to the two quotations," 
suggested Father Gélis.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Mon. Devanne, laughing, "our worthy father is
fond of reading memoirs and delving into the musty archives of
the castle. Everything relating to Thibermesnil interests him
greatly. But the quotations that he mentions only serve to complicate
the mystery. He has read somewhere that two kings of France have
known the key to the puzzle."</p>

<p>"Two kings of France! Who were they?"</p>

<p>"Henry the Fourth and Louis the Sixteenth. And the legend runs
like this: On the eve of the battle of Arques, Henry the Fourth
spent the night in this castle. At eleven o’clock in the evening,
Louise de Tancarville, the prettiest woman in Normandy, was brought
into the castle through the subterranean passage by Duke Edgard,
who, at the same time, informed the king of the secret passage.
Afterward, the king confided the secret to his minister Sully,
who, in turn, relates the story in his book, "Royales Economies
d’Etat," without making any comment upon it, but linking with
it this incomprehensible sentence: ‘Turn one eye on the bee that
shakes, the other eye will lead to God!’"</p>

<p>After a brief silence, Velmont laughed and said:</p>

<p>"Certainly, it doesn’t throw a dazzling light upon the subject."</p>

<p>"No; but Father Gélis claims that Sully concealed the key to
the mystery in this strange sentence in order to keep the secret
from the secretaries to whom he dictated his memoirs."</p>

<p>"That is an ingenious theory," said Velmont.</p>

<p>"Yes, and it may be nothing more; I cannot see that it throws
any light on the mysterious riddle."</p>

<p>"And was it also to receive the visit of a lady that Louis the
Sixteenth caused the passage to be opened?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know," said Mon. Devanne. "All I can say is that the
king stopped here one night in 1784, and that the famous Iron
Casket found in the Louvre contained a paper bearing these words
in the king’s own writing: ‘Thibermesnil 3-4-11.’"</p>

<p>Horace Velmont laughed heartily, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"At last! And now that we have the magic key, where is the man
who can fit it to the invisible lock?"</p>

<p>"Laugh as much as you please, monsieur," said Father Gélis, "but
I am confident the solution is contained in those two sentences,
and some day we will find a man able to interpret them."</p>

<p>"Sherlock Holmes is the man," said Mon. Devanne, "unless Arsène
Lupin gets ahead of him. What is your opinion, Velmont?"</p>

<p>Velmont arose, placed his hand on Devanne’s shoulder, and declared:</p>

<p>"I think that the information furnished by your book and the
book of the National Library was deficient in a very important
detail which you have now supplied. I thank you for it."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"The missing key. Now that I have it, I can go to work at once,"
said Velmont.</p>

<p>"Of course; without losing a minute," said Devanne, smiling.</p>

<p>"Not even a second!" replied Velmont. "To-night, before the arrival
of Sherlock Holmes, I must plunder your castle."</p>

<p>"You have no time to lose. Oh! by the way, I can drive you over
this evening."</p>

<p>"To Dieppe?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I am going to meet Monsieur and Madame d’Androl and a young
lady of their acquaintance who are to arrive by the midnight train."</p>

<p>Then addressing the officers, Devanne added:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I shall expect to see all of you at breakfast to-morrow."</p>

<p>The invitation was accepted. The company dispersed, and a few
moments later Devanne and Velmont were speeding toward Dieppe
in an automobile. Devanne dropped the artist in front of the Casino,
and proceeded to the railway station. At twelve o’clock his friends
alighted from the train. A half hour later the automobile was
at the entrance to the castle. At one o’clock, after a light supper,
they retired. The lights were extinguished, and the castle was
enveloped in the darkness and silence of the night.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>The moon appeared through a rift in the clouds, and filled the
drawing-room with its bright white light. But only for a moment.
Then the moon again retired behind its ethereal draperies, and
darkness and silence reigned supreme. No sound could be heard,
save the monotonous ticking of the clock. It struck two, and then
continued its endless repetitions of the seconds. Then, three
o’clock.</p>

<p>Suddenly, something clicked, like the opening and closing of
a signal-disc that warns the passing train. A thin stream of light
flashed to every corner of the room, like an arrow that leaves
behind it a trail of light. It shot forth from the central fluting
of a column that supported the pediment of the bookcase. It rested
for a moment on the panel opposite like a glittering circle of
burnished silver, then flashed in all directions like a guilty
eye that scrutinizes every shadow. It disappeared for a short
time, but burst forth again as a whole section of the bookcase
revolved on a pivot and disclosed a large opening like a vault.</p>

<p>A man entered, carrying an electric lantern. He was followed
by a second man, who carried a coil of rope and various tools.
The leader inspected the room, listened a moment, and said:</p>

<p>"Call the others."</p>

<p>Then eight men, stout fellows with resolute faces, entered the
room, and immediately commenced to remove the furnishings. Arsène
Lupin passed quickly from one piece of furniture to another, examined
each, and, according to its size or artistic value, he directed
his men to take it or leave it. If ordered to be taken, it was
carried to the gaping mouth of the tunnel, and ruthlessly thrust
into the bowels of the earth. Such was the fate of six armchairs,
six small Louis XV chairs, a quantity of Aubusson tapestries,
some candelabra, paintings by Fragonard and Nattier, a bust by
Houdon, and some statuettes. Sometimes, Lupin would linger before
a beautiful chest or a superb picture, and sigh:</p>

<p>"That is too heavy.... too large.... what a pity!"</p>

<p>In forty minutes the room was dismantled; and it had been accomplished
in such an orderly manner and with as little noise as if the various
articles had been packed and wadded for the occasion.</p>

<p>Lupin said to the last man who departed by way of the tunnel:</p>

<p>"You need not come back. You understand, that as soon as the
auto-van is loaded, you are to proceed to the grange at Roquefort."</p>

<p>"But you, patron?"</p>

<p>"Leave me the motor-cycle."</p>

<p>When the man had disappeared, Arsène Lupin pushed the section
of the bookcase back into its place, carefully effaced the traces
of the men’s footsteps, raised a portière, and entered a gallery,
which was the only means of communication between the tower and
the castle. In the center of this gallery there was a glass cabinet
which had attracted Lupin’s attentions. It contained a valuable
collection of watches, snuff-boxes, rings, chatelaines and miniatures
of rare and beautiful workmanship. He forced the lock with a small
jimmy, and experienced a great pleasure in handling those gold
and silver ornaments, those exquisite and delicate works of art.</p>

<p>He carried a large linen bag, specially prepared for the removal
of such knick-knacks. He filled it. Then he filled the pockets
of his coat, waistcoat and trousers. And he was just placing over
his left arm a number of pearl reticules when he heard a slight
sound. He listened. No, he was not deceived. The noise continued.
Then he remembered that, at one end of the gallery, there was
a stairway leading to an unoccupied apartment, but which was probably
occupied that night by the young lady whom Mon. Devanne had brought
from Dieppe with his other visitors.</p>

<p>Immediately he extinguished his lantern, and had scarcely gained
the friendly shelter of a window-embrasure, when the door at the
top of the stairway was opened and a feeble light illuminated
the gallery. He could feel&mdash;for, concealed by a curtain, he could
not see&mdash;that a woman was cautiously descending the upper steps
of the stairs. He hoped she would come no closer. Yet, she continued
to descend, and even advanced some distance into the room. Then
she uttered a faint cry. No doubt she had discovered the broken
and dismantled cabinet.</p>

<p>She advanced again. Now he could smell the perfume, and hear
the throbbing of her heart as she drew closer to the window where
he was concealed. She passed so close that her skirt brushed against
the window-curtain, and Lupin felt that she suspected the presence
of another, behind her, in the shadow, within reach of her hand.
He thought: "She is afraid. She will go away." But she did not
go. The candle, that she carried in her trembling hand, grew brighter.
She turned, hesitated a moment, appeared to listen, then suddenly
drew aside the curtain.</p>

<p>They stood face to face. Arsène was astounded. He murmured, involuntarily:</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;mademoiselle."</p>

<p>It was Miss Nelly. Miss Nelly! his fellow passenger on the transatlantic
steamer, who had been the subject of his dreams on that memorable
voyage, who had been a witness to his arrest, and who, rather
than betray him, had dropped into the water the Kodak in which
he had concealed the bank-notes and diamonds. Miss Nelly! that
charming creature, the memory of whose face had sometimes cheered,
sometimes saddened the long hours of imprisonment.</p>

<p>It was such an unexpected encounter that brought them face to
face in that castle at that hour of the night, that they could
not move, nor utter a word; they were amazed, hypnotized, each
at the sudden apparition of the other. Trembling with emotion,
Miss Nelly staggered to a seat. He remained standing in front
of her.</p>

<p>Gradually, he realized the situation and conceived the impression
he must have produced at that moment with his arms laden with
knick-knacks, and his pockets and a linen sack overflowing with
plunder. He was overcome with confusion, and he actually blushed
to find himself in the position of a thief caught in the act.
To her, henceforth, he was a thief, a man who puts his hand in
another’s pocket, who steals into houses and robs people while
they sleep.</p>

<p>A watch fell upon the floor; then another. These were followed
by other articles which slipped from his grasp one by one. Then,
actuated by a sudden decision, he dropped the other articles into
an armchair, emptied his pockets and unpacked his sack. He felt
very uncomfortable in Nelly’s presence, and stepped toward her
with the intention of speaking to her, but she shuddered, rose
quickly and fled toward the salon. The portière closed behind
her. He followed her. She was standing trembling and amazed at
the sight of the devastated room. He said to her, at once:</p>

<p>"To-morrow, at three o’clock, everything will be returned. The
furniture will be brought back."</p>

<p>She made no reply, so he repeated:</p>

<p>"I promise it. To-morrow, at three o’clock. Nothing in the world
could induce me to break that promise....To-morrow, at three o’clock."</p>

<p>Then followed a long silence that he dared not break, whilst
the agitation of the young girl caused him a feeling of genuine
regret. Quietly, without a word, he turned away, thinking: "I
hope she will go away. I can’t endure her presence." But the young
girl suddenly spoke, and stammered:</p>

<p>"Listen.... footsteps....I hear someone...."</p>

<p>He looked at her with astonishment. She seemed to be overwhelmed
by the thought of approaching peril.</p>

<p>"I don’t hear anything," he said.</p>

<p>"But you must go&mdash;you must escape!"</p>

<p>"Why should I go?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;you must. Oh! do not remain here another minute. Go!"</p>

<p>She ran, quickly, to the door leading to the gallery and listened.
No, there was no one there. Perhaps the noise was outside. She
waited a moment, then returned reassured.</p>

<p>But Arsène Lupin had disappeared.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>As soon as Mon. Devanne was informed of the pillage of his castle,
he said to himself: It was Velmont who did it, and Velmont is
Arsène Lupin. That theory explained everything, and there was
no other plausible explanation. And yet the idea seemed preposterous.
It was ridiculous to suppose that Velmont was anyone else than
Velmont, the famous artist, and club-fellow of his cousin d’Estevan.
So, when the captain of the gendarmes arrived to investigate the
affair, Devanne did not even think of mentioning his absurd theory.</p>

<p>Throughout the forenoon there was a lively commotion at the castle.
The gendarmes, the local police, the chief of police from Dieppe,
the villagers, all circulated to and fro in the halls, examining
every nook and corner that was open to their inspection. The approach
of the maneuvering troops, the rattling fire of the musketry,
added to the picturesque character of the scene.</p>

<p>The preliminary search furnished no clue. Neither the doors nor
windows showed any signs of having been disturbed. Consequently,
the removal of the goods must have been effected by means of the
secret passage. Yet, there were no indications of footsteps on
the floor, nor any unusual marks upon the walls.</p>

<p>Their investigations revealed, however, one curious fact that
denoted the whimsical character of Arsène Lupin: the famous Chronique
of the sixteenth century had been restored to its accustomed place
in the library and, beside it, there was a similar book, which
was none other than the volume stolen from the National Library.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock the military officers arrived. Devanne welcomed
them with his usual gayety; for, no matter how much chagrin he
might suffer from the loss of his artistic treasures, his great
wealth enabled him to bear his loss philosophically. His guests,
Monsieur and Madame d’Androl and Miss Nelly, were introduced;
and it was then noticed that one of the expected guests had not
arrived. It was Horace Velmont. Would he come? His absence had
awakened the suspicions of Mon. Devanne. But at twelve o’clock
he arrived. Devanne exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Ah! here you are!"</p>

<p>"Why, am I not punctual?" asked Velmont.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I am surprised that you are.... after such a busy night!
I suppose you know the news?"</p>

<p>"What news?"</p>

<p>"You have robbed the castle."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed Velmont, smiling.</p>

<p>"Exactly as I predicted. But, first escort Miss Underdown to
the dining-room. Mademoiselle, allow me&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, as he remarked the extreme agitation of the young
girl. Then, recalling the incident, he said:</p>

<p>"Ah! of course, you met Arsène Lupin on the steamer, before his
arrest, and you are astonished at the resemblance. Is that it?"</p>

<p>She did not reply. Velmont stood before her, smiling. He bowed.
She took his proffered arm. He escorted her to her place, and
took his seat opposite her. During the breakfast, the conversation
related exclusively to Arsène Lupin, the stolen goods, the secret
passage, and Sherlock Holmes. It was only at the close of the
repast, when the conversation had drifted to other subjects, that
Velmont took any part in it. Then he was, by turns, amusing and
grave, talkative and pensive. And all his remarks seemed to be
directed to the young girl. But she, quite absorbed, did not appear
to hear them.</p>

<p>Coffee was served on the terrace overlooking the court of honor
and the flower garden in front of the principal façade. The regimental
band played on the lawn, and scores of soldiers and peasants wandered
through the park.</p>

<p>Miss Nelly had not forgotten, for one moment, Lupin’s solemn
promise: "To-morrow, at three o’clock, everything will be returned."</p>

<p>At three o’clock! And the hands of the great clock in the right
wing of the castle now marked twenty minutes to three. In spite
of herself, her eyes wandered to the clock every minute. She also
watched Velmont, who was calmly swinging to and fro in a comfortable
rocking chair.</p>

<p>Ten minutes to three!....Five minutes to three!....Nelly was
impatient and anxious. Was it possible that Arsène Lupin would
carry out his promise at the appointed hour, when the castle,
the courtyard, and the park were filled with people, and at the
very moment when the officers of the law were pursuing their investigations?
And yet....Arsène Lupin had given her his solemn promise. "It
will be exactly as he said,"  thought she, so deeply was she impressed
with the authority, energy and assurance of that remarkable man.
To her, it no longer assumed the form of a miracle, but, on the
contrary, a natural incident that must occur in the ordinary course
of events. She blushed, and turned her head.</p>

<p>Three o’clock! The great clock struck slowly: one.... two....
three....Horace Velmont took out his watch, glanced at the clock,
then returned the watch to his pocket. A few seconds passed in
silence; and then the crowd in the courtyard parted to give passage
to two wagons, that had just entered the park-gate, each drawn
by two horses. They were army-wagons, such as are used for the
transportation of provisions, tents, and other necessary military
stores. They stopped in front of the main entrance, and a commissary-sergeant
leaped from one of the wagons and inquired for Mon. Devanne. A
moment later, that gentleman emerged from the house, descended
the steps, and, under the canvas covers of the wagons, beheld
his furniture, pictures and ornaments carefully packaged and arranged.</p>

<p>When questioned, the sergeant produced an order that he had received
from the officer of the day. By that order, the second company
of the fourth battalion were commanded to proceed to the crossroads
of Halleux in the forest of Arques, gather up the furniture and
other articles deposited there, and deliver same to Monsieur Georges
Devanne, owner of the Thibermesnil castle, at three o’clock. Signed:
Col. Beauvel.</p>

<p>"At the crossroads," explained the sergeant, "we found everything
ready, lying on the grass, guarded by some passers-by. It seemed
very strange, but the order was imperative."</p>

<p>One of the officers examined the signature. He declared it a
forgery; but a clever imitation. The wagons were unloaded, and
the goods restored to their proper places in the castle.</p>

<p>During this commotion, Nelly had remained alone at the extreme
end of the terrace, absorbed by confused and distracted thoughts.
Suddenly, she observed Velmont approaching her. She would have
avoided him, but the balustrade that surrounded the terrace cut
off her retreat. She was cornered. She could not move. A gleam
of sunshine, passing through the scant foliage of a bamboo, lighted
up her beautiful golden hair. Some one spoke to her in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Have I not kept my promise?"</p>

<p>Arsène Lupin stood close to her. No one else was near. He repeated,
in a calm, soft voice:</p>

<p>"Have I not kept my promise?"</p>

<p>He expected a word of thanks, or at least some slight movement
that would betray her interest in the fulfillment of his promise.
But she remained silent.</p>

<p>Her scornful attitude annoyed Arsène Lupin; and he realized the
vast distance that separated him from Miss Nelly, now that she
had learned the truth. He would gladly have justified himself
in her eyes, or at least pleaded extenuating circumstances, but
he perceived the absurdity and futility of such an attempt. Finally,
dominated by a surging flood of memories, he murmured:</p>

<p>"Ah! how long ago that was! You remember the long hours on the
deck of the ‘Provence.’ Then, you carried a rose in your hand,
a white rose like the one you carry to-day. I asked you for it.
You pretended you did not hear me. After you had gone away, I
found the rose&mdash;forgotten, no doubt&mdash;and I kept it."</p>

<p>She made no reply. She seemed to be far away. He continued:</p>

<p>"In memory of those happy hours, forget what you have learned
since. Separate the past from the present. Do not regard me as
the man you saw last night, but look at me, if only for a moment,
as you did in those far-off days when I was Bernard d’Andrezy,
for a short time. Will you, please?"</p>

<p>She raised her eyes and looked at him as he had requested. Then,
without saying a word, she pointed to a ring he was wearing on
his forefinger. Only the ring was visible; but the setting, which
was turned toward the palm of his hand, consisted of a magnificent
ruby. Arsène Lupin blushed. The ring belonged to Georges Devanne.
He smiled bitterly, and said:</p>

<p>"You are right. Nothing can be changed. Arsène Lupin is now and
always will be Arsène Lupin. To you, he cannot be even so much
as a memory. Pardon me....I should have known that any attention
I may now offer you is simply an insult. Forgive me."</p>

<p>He stepped aside, hat in hand. Nelly passed before him. He was
inclined to detain her and beseech her forgiveness. But his courage
failed, and he contented himself by following her with his eyes,
as he had done when she descended the gangway to the pier at New
York. She mounted the steps leading to the door, and disappeared
within the house. He saw her no more.</p>

<p>A cloud obscured the sun. Arsène Lupin stood watching the imprints
of her tiny feet in the sand. Suddenly, he gave a start. Upon
the box which contained the bamboo, beside which Nelly had been
standing, he saw the rose, the white rose which he had desired
but dared not ask for. Forgotten, no doubt&mdash;it, also! But how&mdash;designedly
or through distraction? He seized it eagerly. Some of its petals
fell to the ground. He picked them up, one by one, like precious
relics.</p>

<p>"Come!" he said to himself, "I have nothing more to do here.
I must think of my safety, before Sherlock Holmes arrives."</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>The park was deserted, but some gendarmes were stationed at the
park-gate. He entered a grove of pine trees, leaped over the wall,
and, as a short cut to the railroad station, followed a path across
the fields. After walking about ten minutes, he arrived at a spot
where the road grew narrower and ran between two steep banks.
In this ravine, he met a man traveling in the opposite direction.
It was a man about fifty years of age, tall, smooth-shaven, and
wearing clothes of a foreign cut. He carried a heavy cane, and
a small satchel was strapped across his shoulder. When they met,
the stranger spoke, with a slight English accent:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, monsieur, is this the way to the castle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur, straight ahead, and turn to the left when you
come to the wall. They are expecting you."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my friend Devanne told us last night that you were coming,
and I am delighted to be the first to welcome you. Sherlock Holmes
has no more ardent admirer than.... myself."</p>

<p>There was a touch of irony in his voice that he quickly regretted,
for Sherlock Holmes scrutinized him from head to foot with such
a keen, penetrating eye that Arsène Lupin experienced the sensation
of being seized, imprisoned and registered by that look more thoroughly
and precisely than he had ever been by a camera.</p>

<p>"My negative is taken now," he thought, "and it will be useless
to use a disguise with that man. He would look right through it.
But, I wonder, has he recognized me?"</p>

<p>They bowed to each other as if about to part. But, at that moment,
they heard a sound of horses’ feet, accompanied by a clinking
of steel. It was the gendarmes. The two men were obliged to draw
back against the embankment, amongst the brushes, to avoid the
horses. The gendarmes passed by, but, as they followed each other
at a considerable distance, they were several minutes in doing
so. And Lupin was thinking:</p>

<p>"It all depends on that question: has he recognized me? If so,
he will probably take advantage of the opportunity. It is a trying
situation."</p>

<p>When the last horseman had passed, Sherlock Holmes stepped forth
and brushed the dust from his clothes. Then, for a moment, he
and Arsène Lupin gazed at each other; and, if a person could have
seen them at that moment, it would have been an interesting sight,
and memorable as the first meeting of two remarkable men, so strange,
so powerfully equipped, both of superior quality, and destined
by fate, through their peculiar attributes, to hurl themselves
one at the other like two equal forces that nature opposes, one
against the other, in the realms of space.</p>

<p>Then the Englishman said: "Thank you, monsieur."</p>

<p>"You are quite welcome," replied Arsène Lupin.</p>

<p>They parted. Lupin went toward the railway station, and Sherlock
Holmes continued on his way to the castle.</p>

<p>The local officers had given up the investigation after several
hours of fruitless efforts, and the people at the castle were
awaiting the arrival of the English detective with a lively curiosity.
At first sight, they were a little disappointed on account of
his commonplace appearance, which differed so greatly from the
pictures they had formed of him in their own minds. He did not
in any way resemble the romantic hero, the mysterious and diabolical
personage that the name of Sherlock Holmes had evoked in their
imaginations. However, Mon. Devanne exclaimed with much gusto:</p>

<p>"Ah! monsieur, you are here! I am delighted to see you. It is
a long-deferred pleasure. Really, I scarcely regret what has happened,
since it affords me the opportunity to meet you. But, how did
you come?"</p>

<p>"By the train."</p>

<p>"But I sent my automobile to meet you at the station."</p>

<p>"An official reception, eh? with music and fireworks! Oh! no,
not for me. That is not the way I do business," grumbled the Englishman.</p>

<p>This speech disconcerted Devanne, who replied, with a forced
smile:</p>

<p>"Fortunately, the business has been greatly simplified since
I wrote to you."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"The robbery took place last night."</p>

<p>"If you had not announced my intended visit, it is probable the
robbery would not have been committed last night."</p>

<p>"When, then?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, or some other day."</p>

<p>"And in that case?"</p>

<p>"Lupin would have been trapped," said the detective.</p>

<p>"And my furniture?"</p>

<p>"Would not have been carried away."</p>

<p>"Ah! but my goods are here. They were brought back at three o’clock."</p>

<p>"By Lupin."</p>

<p>"By two army-wagons."</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes put on his cap and adjusted his satchel. Devanne
exclaimed, anxiously:</p>

<p>"But, monsieur, what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I am going home."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Your goods have been returned; Arsène Lupin is far away&mdash;there
is nothing for me to do."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is. I need your assistance. What happened yesterday,
may happen again to-morrow, as we do not know how he entered,
or how he escaped, or why, a few hours later, he returned the
goods."</p>

<p>"Ah! you don’t know&mdash;"</p>

<p>The idea of a problem to be solved quickened the interest of
Sherlock Holmes.</p>

<p>"Very well, let us make a search&mdash;at once&mdash;and alone, if possible."</p>

<p>Devanne understood, and conducted the Englishman to the salon.
In a dry, crisp voice, in sentences that seemed to have been prepared
in advance, Holmes asked a number of questions about the events
of the preceding evening, and enquired also concerning the guests
and the members of the household. Then he examined the two volumes
of the "Chronique," compared the plans of the subterranean passage,
requested a repetition of the sentences discovered by Father Gélis,
and then asked:</p>

<p>"Was yesterday the first time you have spoken those two sentences
to any one?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You had never communicated then to Horace Velmont?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, order the automobile. I must leave in an hour."</p>

<p>"In an hour?"</p>

<p>"Yes; within that time, Arsène Lupin solved the problem that
you placed before him."</p>

<p>"<em>I.... </em>placed before him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Arsène Lupin or Horace Velmont&mdash;same thing."</p>

<p>"I thought so. Ah! the scoundrel!"</p>

<p>"Now, let us see," said Holmes, "last night at ten o’clock, you
furnished Lupin with the information that he lacked, and that
he had been seeking for many weeks. During the night, he found
time to solve the problem, collect his men, and rob the castle.
I shall be quite as expeditious."</p>

<p>He walked from end to end of the room, in deep thought, then
sat down, crossed his long legs and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>Devanne waited, quite embarrassed. Thought he: "Is the man asleep?
Or is he only meditating?" However, he left the room to give some
orders, and when he returned he found the detective on his knees
scrutinizing the carpet at the foot of the stairs in the gallery.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"Look.... there.... spots from a candle."</p>

<p>"You are right&mdash;and quite fresh."</p>

<p>"And you will also find them at the top of the stairs, and around
the cabinet that Arsène Lupin broke into, and from which he took
the bibelots that he afterward placed in this armchair."</p>

<p>"What do you conclude from that?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. These facts would doubtless explain the cause for the
restitution, but that is a side issue that I cannot wait to investigate.
The main question is the secret passage. First, tell me, is there
a chapel some two or three hundred metres from the castle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a ruined chapel, containing the tomb of Duke Rollo."</p>

<p>"Tell your chauffer to wait for us near that chapel."</p>

<p>"My chauffer hasn’t returned. If he had, they would have informed
me. Do you think the secret passage runs to the chapel? What reason
have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would ask you, monsieur," interrupted the detective, "to furnish
me with a ladder and a lantern."</p>

<p>"What! do you require a ladder and a lantern?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, or I shouldn’t have asked for them."</p>

<p>Devanne, somewhat disconcerted by this crude logic, rang the
bell. The two articles were given with the sternness and precision
of military commands.</p>

<p>"Place the ladder against the bookcase, to the left of the word
Thibermesnil."</p>

<p>Devanne placed the ladder as directed, and the Englishman continued:</p>

<p>"More to the left.... to the right....There!....Now, climb up....
All the letters are in relief, aren’t they?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"First, turn the letter I one way or the other."</p>

<p>"Which one? There are two of them."</p>

<p>"The first one."</p>

<p>Devanne took hold of the letter, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, it turns toward the right. Who told you that?"</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes did not reply to the question, but continued
his directions:</p>

<p>"Now, take the letter B. Move it back and forth as you would
a bolt."</p>

<p>Devanne did so, and, to his great surprise, it produced a clicking
sound.</p>

<p>"Quite right," said Holmes. "Now, we will go to the other end
of the word Thibermesnil, try the letter I, and see if it will
open like a wicket."</p>

<p>With a certain degree of solemnity, Devanne seized the letter.
It opened, but Devanne fell from the ladder, for the entire section
of the bookcase, lying between the first and last letters of the
words, turned on a pivot and disclosed the subterranean passage.</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes said, coolly:</p>

<p>"You are not hurt?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Devanne, as he rose to his feet, "not hurt, only
bewildered. I can’t understand now.... those letters turn....
the secret passage opens...."</p>

<p>"Certainly. Doesn’t that agree exactly with the formula given
by Sully? Turn one eye on the bee that shakes, the other eye will
lead to God."</p>

<p>"But Louis the sixteenth?" asked Devanne.</p>

<p>"Louis the sixteenth was a clever locksmith. I have read a book
he wrote about combination locks. It was a good idea on the part
of the owner of Thibermesnil to show His Majesty a clever bit
of mechanism. As an aid to his memory, the king wrote: 3-4-11,
that is to say, the third, fourth and eleventh letters of the
word."</p>

<p>"Exactly. I understand that. It explains how Lupin got out of
the room, but it does not explain how he entered. And it is certain
he came from the outside."</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes lighted his lantern, and stepped into the passage.</p>

<p>"Look! All the mechanism is exposed here, like the works of a
clock, and the reverse side of the letters can be reached. Lupin
worked the combination from this side&mdash;that is all."</p>

<p>"What proof is there of that?"</p>

<p>"Proof? Why, look at that puddle of oil. Lupin foresaw that the
wheels would require oiling."</p>

<p>"Did he know about the other entrance?"</p>

<p>"As well as I know it," said Holmes. "Follow me."</p>

<p>"Into that dark passage?"</p>

<p>"Are you afraid?"</p>

<p>"No, but are you sure you can find the way out?"</p>

<p>"With my eyes closed."</p>

<p>At first, they descended twelve steps, then twelve more, and,
farther on, two other flights of twelve steps each. Then they
walked through a long passageway, the brick walls of which showed
the marks of successive restorations, and, in spots, were dripping
with water. The earth, also, was very damp.</p>

<p>"We are passing under the pond," said Devanne, somewhat nervously.</p>

<p>At last, they came to a stairway of twelve steps, followed by
three others of twelve steps each, which they mounted with difficulty,
and then found themselves in a small cavity cut in the rock. They
could go no further.</p>

<p>"The deuce!" muttered Holmes, "nothing but bare walls. This is
provoking."</p>

<p>"Let us go back," said Devanne. "I have seen enough to satisfy
me."</p>

<p>But the Englishman raised his eye and uttered a sigh of relief.
There, he saw the same mechanism and the same word as before.
He had merely to work the three letters. He did so, and a block
of granite swung out of place. On the other side, this granite
block formed the tombstone of Duke Rollo, and the word "Thibermesnil"
was engraved on it in relief. Now, they were in the little ruined
chapel, and the detective said:</p>

<p>"The other eye leads to God; that means, to the chapel."</p>

<p>"It is marvelous!" exclaimed Devanne, amazed at the clairvoyance
and vivacity of the Englishman. "Can it be possible that those
few words were sufficient for you?"</p>

<p>"Bah!" declared Holmes, "they weren’t even necessary. In the
chart in the book of the National Library, the drawing terminates
at the left, as you know, in a circle, and at the right, as you
do not know, in a cross. Now, that cross must refer to the chapel
in which we now stand."</p>

<p>Poor Devanne could not believe his ears. It was all so new, so
novel to him. He exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It is incredible, miraculous, and yet of a childish simplicity!
How is it that no one has ever solved the mystery?"</p>

<p>"Because no one has ever united the essential elements, that
is to say, the two books and the two sentences. No one, but Arsène
Lupin and myself."</p>

<p>"But, Father Gélis and I knew all about those things, and, likewise&mdash;"</p>

<p>Holmes smiled, and said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Devanne, everybody cannot solve riddles."</p>

<p>"I have been trying for ten years to accomplish what you did
in ten minutes."</p>

<p>"Bah! I am used to it."</p>

<p>They emerged from the chapel, and found an automobile.</p>

<p>"Ah! there’s an auto waiting for us."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is mine," said Devanne.</p>

<p>"Yours? You said your chauffeur hadn’t returned."</p>

<p>They approached the machine, and Mon. Devanne questioned the
chauffer:</p>

<p>"Edouard, who gave you orders to come here?"</p>

<p>"Why, it was Monsieur Velmont."</p>

<p>"Mon. Velmont? Did you meet him?"</p>

<p>"Near the railway station, and he told me to come to the chapel."</p>

<p>"To come to the chapel! What for?"</p>

<p>"To wait for you, monsieur, and your friend."</p>

<p>Devanne and Holmes exchanged looks, and Mon. Devanne said:</p>

<p>"He knew the mystery would be a simple one for you. It is a delicate
compliment."</p>

<p>A smile of satisfaction lighted up the detective’s serious features
for a moment. The compliment pleased him. He shook his head, as
he said:</p>

<p>"A clever man! I knew that when I saw him."</p>

<p>"Have you seen him?"</p>

<p>"I met him a short time ago&mdash;on my way from the station."</p>

<p>"And you knew it was Horace Velmont &mdash;I mean, Arsène Lupin?"</p>

<p>"That is right. I wonder how it came&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, but I supposed it was&mdash;from a certain ironical speech he
made."</p>

<p>"And you allowed him to escape?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did. And yet I had everything on my side, such as
five gendarmes who passed us."</p>

<p>"Sacrableu!" cried Devanne. "You should have taken advantage
of the opportunity."</p>

<p>"Really, monsieur," said the Englishman, haughtily, "when I encounter
an adversary like Arsène Lupin, I do not take advantage of chance
opportunities, I create them."</p>

<p>But time pressed, and since Lupin had been so kind as to send
the automobile, they resolved to profit by it. They seated themselves
in the comfortable limousine; Edouard took his place at the wheel,
and away they went toward the railway station. Suddenly, Devanne’s
eyes fell upon a small package in one of the pockets of the carriage.</p>

<p>"Ah! what is that? A package! Whose is it? Why, it is for you."</p>

<p>"For me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is addressed: Sherlock Holmes, from Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>The Englishman took the package, opened it, and found that it
contained a watch.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, with an angry gesture.</p>

<p>"A watch," said Devanne. "How did it come there?"</p>

<p>The detective did not reply.</p>

<p>"Oh! it is your watch! Arsène Lupin returns your watch! But,
in order to return it, he must have taken it. Ah! I see! He took
your watch! That is a good one! Sherlock Holmes’ watch stolen
by Arsène Lupin! Mon Dieu! that is funny! Really.... you must
excuse me....I can’t help it."</p>

<p>He roared with laughter, unable to control himself. After which,
he said, in a tone of earnest conviction:</p>

<p>"A clever man, indeed!"</p>

<p>The Englishman never moved a muscle. On the way to Dieppe, he
never spoke a word, but fixed his gaze on the flying landscape.
His silence was terrible, unfathomable, more violent than the
wildest rage. At the railway station, he spoke calmly, but in
a voice that impressed one with the vast energy and will power
of that famous man. He said:</p>

<p>"Yes, he is a clever man, but some day I shall have the pleasure
of placing on his shoulder the hand I now offer to you, Monsieur
Devanne. And I believe that Arsène Lupin and Sherlock Holmes will
meet again some day. Yes, the world is too small&mdash;we will meet&mdash;we
must meet&mdash;and then&mdash;"</p>
