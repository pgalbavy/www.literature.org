<p>The Moat House stood not far from the rough forest road. Externally, it
was a compact rectangle of red stone, flanked at each corner by a round
tower, pierced for archery and battlemented at the top. Within, it
enclosed a narrow court. The moat was perhaps twelve feet wide, crossed
by a single drawbridge. It was supplied with water by a trench, leading
to a forest pool and commanded, through its whole length, from the
battlements of the two southern towers. Except that one or two tall and
thick trees had been suffered to remain within half a bowshot of the
walls, the house was in a good posture for defence.
</p><p>In the court, Dick found a part of the garrison, busy with preparations
for defence, and gloomily discussing the chances of a siege. Some were
making arrows, some sharpening swords that had long been disused; but
even as they worked, they shook their heads.
</p><p>Twelve of Sir Daniel's party had escaped the battle, run the gauntlet
through the wood, and come alive to the Moat House. But out of this
dozen, three had been gravely wounded: two at Risingham in the disorder
of the rout, one by John Amend-All's marksmen as he crossed the forest.
</p><p>This raised the force of the garrison, counting Hatch, Sir Daniel, and
young Shelton, to twenty-two effective men. And more might be
continually expected to arrive. The danger lay not therefore in the lack
of men.
</p><p>It was the terror of the Black Arrow that oppressed the spirits of the
garrison. For their open foes of the party of York, in these most
changing times, they felt but a far-away concern. "The world," as people
said in those days, "might change again" before harm came. But for their
neighbours in the wood, they trembled. It was not Sir Daniel alone who
was a mark for hatred. His men, conscious of impunity, had carried
themselves cruelly through all the country. Harsh commands had been
harshly executed; and of the little band that now sat talking in the
court, there was not one but had been guilty of some act of oppression
or barbarity. And now, by the fortune of war, Sir Daniel had become
powerless to protect his instruments; now, by the issue of some hours of
battle, at which many of them had not been present, they had all become
punishable traitors to the State, outside the buckler of the law, a
shrunken company in a poor fortress that was hardly tenable, and exposed
upon all sides to the just resentment of their victims. Nor had there
been lacking grisly advertisements of what they might expect.
</p><p>[Illustration: <u>Lastly, a little before dawn, a spearman had come
staggering to the moat side, pierced by arrows</u>]
</p><p>At different periods of the evening and the night, no fewer than seven
riderless horses had come neighing in terror to the gate. Two were from
Selden's troop; five belonged to men who had ridden with Sir Daniel to
the field. Lastly, a little before dawn, a spearman had come staggering
to the moat side, pierced by three arrows; even as they carried him
in, his spirit had departed; but by the words that he uttered in his
agony, he must have been the last survivor of a considerable company of
men.
</p><p>Hatch himself showed, under his sun-brown, the pallor of anxiety; and
when he had taken Dick aside and learned the fate of Selden, he fell on
a stone bench and fairly wept. The others, from where they sat on stools
or doorsteps in the sunny angle of the court, looked at him with wonder
and alarm, but none ventured to inquire the cause of his emotion.
</p><p>"Nay, Master Shelton," said Hatch, at last--"nay, but what said I? We
shall all go. Selden was a man of his hands; he was like a brother to
me. Well, he has gone second; well, we shall all follow! For what said
their knave rhyme?--'A black arrow in each black heart.' Was it not so
it went? Appleyard, Selden, Smith, old Humphrey gone; and there lieth
poor John Carter, crying, poor sinner, for the priest."
</p><p>Dick gave ear. Out of a low window, hard by where they were talking,
groans and murmurs came to his ear.
</p><p>"Lieth he there?" he asked.
</p><p>"Ay, in the second porter's chamber," answered Hatch. "We could not bear
him further, soul and body were so bitterly at odds. At every step we
lifted him, he thought to wend. But now, methinks, it is the soul that
suffereth. Ever for the priest he crieth, and Sir Oliver, I wot not why,
still cometh not. 'Twill be a long shrift; but poor Appleyard and poor
Selden, they had none."
</p><p>Dick stooped to the window and looked in. The little cell was low and
dark, but he could make out the wounded soldier lying moaning on his
pallet.
</p><p>"Carter, poor friend, how goeth it?" he asked.
</p><p>"Master Shelton," returned the man, in an excited whisper, "for the dear
light of heaven, bring the priest. Alack, I am sped; I am brought very
low down; my hurt is to the death. Ye may do me no more service; this
shall be the last. Now, for my poor soul's interest, and as a loyal
gentleman, bestir you; for I have that matter on my conscience that
shall drag me deep."
</p><p>He groaned, and Dick heard the grating of his teeth, whether in pain or
terror.
</p><p>Just then Sir Daniel appeared upon the threshold of the hall. He had a
letter in one hand.
</p><p>"Lads," he said, "we have had a shog, we have had a tumble; wherefore,
then, deny it? Rather it imputeth to get speedily again to saddle. This
old Harry the Sixt has had the undermost. Wash we, then, our hands of
him. I have a good friend that rideth next the duke, the Lord of
Wensleydale. Well, I have writ a letter to my friend, praying his good
lordship, and offering large satisfaction for the past and reasonable
surety for the future. Doubt not but he will lend a favourable ear. A
prayer without gifts is like a song without music: I surfeit him with
promises, boys--I spare not to promise. What, then, is lacking? Nay, a
great thing--wherefore should I deceive you?--a great thing and a
difficult: a messenger to bear it. The woods--y'are not ignorant of
that--lie thick with our ill-willers. Haste is most needful; but without
sleight and caution all is naught. Which, then, of this company will
take me this letter, bear me it to my Lord of Wensleydale, and bring me
the answer back?"
</p><p>One man instantly arose.
</p><p>"I will, an't like you," said he. "I will even risk my carcase."
</p><p>"Nay, Dicky Bowyer, not so," returned the knight. "It likes me not.
Y'are sly indeed, but not speedy. Ye were a laggard ever."
</p><p>"An't be so, Sir Daniel, here am I," cried another.
</p><p>"The saints forfend!" said the knight. "Y'are speedy, but not sly. Ye
would blunder me head-foremost into John Amend-All's camp. I thank you
both for your good courage; but, in sooth, it may not be."
</p><p>Then Hatch offered himself, and he also was refused.
</p><p>"I want you here, good Bennet; y'are my right hand, indeed," returned
the knight; and then several coming forward in a group, Sir Daniel at
length selected one and gave him the letter.
</p><p>"Now," he said, "upon your good speed and better discretion we do all
depend. Bring me a good answer back, and before three weeks, I will have
purged my forest of these vagabonds that brave us to our faces. But mark
it well, Throgmorton: the matter is not easy. Ye must steal forth under
night, and go like a fox; and how ye are to cross Till I know not,
neither by the bridge nor ferry."
</p><p>"I can swim," returned Throgmorton. "I will come soundly, fear not."
</p><p>"Well, friend, get ye to the buttery," replied Sir Daniel. "Ye shall
swim first of all in nut-brown ale." And with that he turned back into
the hall.
</p><p>"Sir Daniel hath a wise tongue," said Hatch, aside, to Dick. "See, now,
where many a lesser man had glossed the matter over, he speaketh it out
plainly to his company. Here is a danger, 'a saith, and here difficulty;
and jesteth in the very saying. Nay, by St. Barbary, he is a born
captain! Not a man but he is some deal heartened up! See how they fall
again to work."
</p><p>This praise of Sir Daniel put a thought in the lad's head.
</p><p>"Bennet," he said, "how came my father by his end?"
</p><p>"Ask me not that," replied Hatch. "I had no hand nor knowledge in it;
furthermore, I will even be silent, Master Dick. For look you, in a
man's own business there he may speak; but of hearsay matters and of
common talk, not so. Ask me Sir Oliver--ay, or Carter, if ye will; not
me."
</p><p>And Hatch set off to make the rounds, leaving Dick in a muse.
</p><p>"Wherefore would he not tell me?" thought the lad. "And wherefore named
he Carter? Carter--nay, then Carter had a hand in it, perchance."
</p><p>He entered the house, and passing some little way along a flagged and
vaulted passage, came to the door of the cell where the hurt man lay
groaning. At his entrance Carter started eagerly.
</p><p>"Have ye brought the priest?" he cried.
</p><p>"Not yet awhile," returned Dick. "Y' 'ave a word to tell me first. How
came my father, Harry Shelton, by his death?"
</p><p>The man's face altered instantly.
</p><p>"I know not," he replied, doggedly.
</p><p>"Nay, ye know well," returned Dick. "Seek not to put me by."
</p><p>"I tell you I know not," repeated Carter.
</p><p>"Then," said Dick, "ye shall die unshriven. Here am I, and here shall
stay. There shall no priest come near you, rest assured. For of what
avail is penitence, an ye have no mind to right those wrongs ye had a
hand in? and without penitence, confession is but mockery."
</p><p>"Ye say what ye mean not, Master Dick," said Carter, composedly. "It is
ill threatening the dying, and becometh you (to speak truth) little. And
for as little as it commends you, it shall serve you less. Stay, an ye
please. Ye will condemn my soul--ye shall learn nothing! There is my
last word to you." And the wounded man turned upon the other side.
</p><p>Now, Dick, to say truth, had spoken hastily, and was ashamed of his
threat. But he made one more effort.
</p><p>"Carter," he said, "mistake me not. I know ye were but an instrument in
the hands of others; a churl must obey his lord; I would not bear
heavily on such an one. But I begin to learn upon many sides that this
great duty lieth on my youth and ignorance, to avenge my father.
Prithee, then, good Carter, set aside the memory of my threatenings, and
in pure good-will and honest penitence give me a word of help."
</p><p>The wounded man lay silent; nor, say what Dick pleased, could he extract
another word from him.
</p><p>"Well," said Dick, "I will go call the priest to you as ye desired; for
howsoever ye be in fault to me or mine, I would not be willingly in
fault to any, least of all to one upon the last change."
</p><p>Again the old soldier heard him without speech or motion; even his
groans he had suppressed; and as Dick turned and left the room, he was
filled with admiration for that rugged fortitude.
</p><p>"And yet," he thought, "of what use is courage without wit? Had his
hands been clean, he would have spoken; his silence did confess the
secret louder than words. Nay, upon all sides, proof floweth on me. Sir
Daniel, he or his men, hath done this thing."
</p><p>Dick paused in the stone passage with a heavy heart. At that hour, in
the ebb of Sir Daniel's fortune, when he was beleaguered by the archers
of the Black Arrow and proscribed by the victorious Yorkists, was Dick,
also, to turn upon the man who had nourished and taught him, who had
severely punished, indeed, but yet unwearyingly protected his youth? The
necessity, if it should prove to be one, was cruel.
</p><p>"Pray Heaven he be innocent!" he said.
</p><p>And then steps sounded on the flagging, and Sir Oliver came gravely
towards the lad.
</p><p>"One seeketh you earnestly," said Dick.
</p><p>"I am upon the way, good Richard," said the priest. "It is this poor
Carter. Alack, he is beyond cure."
</p><p>"And yet his soul is sicker than his body," answered Dick.
</p><p>"Have ye seen him?" asked Sir Oliver, with a manifest start.
</p><p>"I do but come from him," replied Dick.
</p><p>"What said he? what said he?" snapped the priest, with extraordinary
eagerness.
</p><p>"He but cried for you the more piteously, Sir Oliver. It were well done
to go the faster, for his hurt is grievous," returned the lad.
</p><p>"I am straight for him," was the reply. "Well, we have all our sins. We
must all come to our latter day, good Richard."
</p><p>"Ay, sir; and it were well if we all came fairly," answered Dick.
</p><p>The priest dropped his eyes, and with an inaudible benediction hurried
on.
</p><p>"He, too!" thought Dick--"he, that taught me in piety! Nay, then, what a
world is this, if all that care for me be blood-guilty of my father's
death? Vengeance! Alas! what a sore fate is mine, if I must be avenged
upon my friends!"
</p><p>The thought put Matcham in his head. He smiled at the remembrance of his
strange companion, and then wondered where he was. Ever since they had
come together to the doors of the Moat House the younger lad had
disappeared, and Dick began to weary for a word with him.
</p><p>About an hour after, mass being somewhat hastily run through by Sir
Oliver, the company gathered in the hall for dinner. It was a long, low
apartment, strewn with green rushes, and the walls hung with arras in a
design of savage men and questioning bloodhounds; here and there hung
spears and bows and bucklers; a fire blazed in the big chimney; there
were arras-covered benches round the wall, and in the midst the table,
fairly spread, awaited the arrival of the diners. Neither Sir Daniel nor
his lady made their appearance. Sir Oliver himself was absent, and here
again there was no word of Matcham. Dick began to grow alarmed, to
recall his companion's melancholy forebodings, and to wonder to himself
if any foul play had befallen him in that house.
</p><p>After dinner he found Goody Hatch, who was hurrying to my Lady Brackley.
</p><p>"Goody," he said, "where is Master Matcham, I prithee? I saw ye go in
with him when we arrived."
</p><p>The old woman laughed aloud.
</p><p>"Ah, Master Dick," she said, "y' have a famous bright eye in your head,
to be sure!" and laughed again.
</p><p>"Nay, but where is he, indeed?" persisted Dick.
</p><p>"Ye will never see him more," she returned--"never. It is sure."
</p><p>"An I do not," returned the lad, "I will know the reason why. He came
not hither of his full free will; such as I am, I am his best protector,
and I will see him justly used. There be too many mysteries; I do begin
to weary of the game!"
</p><p>But as Dick was speaking, a heavy hand fell on his shoulder. It was
Bennet Hatch that had come unperceived behind him. With a jerk of his
thumb, the retainer dismissed his wife.
</p><p>"Friend Dick," he said, as soon as they were alone, "are ye a
moon-struck natural? An ye leave not certain things in peace, ye were
better in the salt sea than here in Tunstall Moat House. Y' have
questioned me; y' have baited Carter; y' have frighted the jack-priest
with hints. Bear ye more wisely, fool; and even now, when Sir Daniel
calleth you, show me a smooth face for the love of wisdom. Y'are to be
sharply questioned. Look to your answers."
</p><p>"Hatch," returned Dick, "in all this I smell a guilty conscience."
</p><p>"An ye go not the wiser, ye will soon smell blood," replied Bennet. "I
do but warn you. And here cometh one to call you."
</p><p>And indeed, at that very moment, a messenger came across the court to
summon Dick into the presence of Sir Daniel.
