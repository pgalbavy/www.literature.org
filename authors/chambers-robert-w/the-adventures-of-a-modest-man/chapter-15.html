<p>"Ellis," said Jones, earnestly, as they climbed to the camp and
stood gazing at the whitening ashes of their fire, "the simple
life is a state of mind. I'm in it, now. And&mdash;do you know, Ellis,
that&mdash;I &mdash;I could learn to like it?"</p>

<p>Ellis prodded the back-log, and tossed on some dry sticks.</p>

<p>"Great Heaven!" breathed Jones, "did you ever see such eyes,
Ellis?"</p>

<p>"The grey ones? They're very noticeable&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I meant&mdash;well, let it go at that. Here be two of us have lost
a thousand shillings to-day."</p>

<p>"And the ladies were not in buckram," rejoined Ellis, starting
a blaze. "Jones, can you prepare trout for the pan with the aid
of a knife? Here, rub salt in 'em&mdash;and leave all but two in that
big tin&mdash;dry, mind, then cover it and sink it in the spring, or
something furry will come nosing and clawing at it. I'll have
things ready by the time you're back."</p>

<p>"About our canoes," began Jones. "I've daubed mine with white
lead, but I cut it up badly. Hadn't we better attend to them before
the storm breaks?"</p>

<p>"Get yours into camp. I'll fetch mine; it's cached just below
the forks. This storm may tear things."</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later two vigorous young men swung into
camp, lowered the canoes from their heads and shoulders, carried
the strapped kits, poles and paddles into the lean-to, and turned
the light crafts bottom up as flanking shelters to headquarters.</p>

<p>"No use fishing; that thunder is spoiling the Caranay," muttered
Ellis, moving about and setting the camp in order. "This is a
fine lean-to," he added; "it's big enough for a regiment."</p>

<p>"I told you I was an architect," said Jones, surveying the open-faced
shanty with pride. "I had nothing else to do, so I spent the time
in making this. I'm a corker on the classic. Shall I take an axe
and cut some wood in the Ionic or Doric style?"</p>

<p>Ellis, squatting among the provisions, busily bringing order
out of chaos, told him what sort of wood to cut; and an hour later,
when the echoing thwacks of the axe ceased and Jones came in loaded
with firewood, the camp was in order; hambones, stale bedding,
tin cans, the heads and spinal processes of trout had been removed,
dishes polished, towels washed and drying, and a pleasant aroma
of balsam tips mingled with the spicy scent of the fire.</p>

<p>"Whew!" said Jones, sniffing; "it smells pleasant now."</p>

<p>"Your camp," observed Ellis, "had all the fragrance of a dog-fox
in March. How heavy the air is. Listen to that thunder! There's
the deuce to pay on the upper waters of the Caranay by this time."</p>

<p>"Do you think we'll get it?"</p>

<p>"Not the rain and wind; the electrical storms usually swing off,
following the Big Oswaya. But we may have a flood." He arose and
picked up his rod. "The thunder has probably blanked me, but if
you'll tend camp I'll try to pick up some fish in a binnikill
I know of where the trout are habituated to the roar of the fork
falls. We may need every fish we can get if the flood proves a
bad one."</p>

<p>Jones said it would suit him perfectly to sit still. He curled
up close enough to the fire for comfort as well as æsthetic pleasure,
removed his eyeglasses, fished out a flask of aromatic mosquito
ointment, and solemnly began a facial toilet, in the manner of
a comfortable house cat anointing her countenance with one paw.</p>

<p>"Ellis," he said, blinking up at that young man very amiably,
"it would be agreeable to see a little more of&mdash;of Miss Sandys;
wouldn't it? And the other&#11834;"</p>

<p>"We could easily do that."</p>

<p>"Eh? How?"</p>

<p>"By engaging an attorney to defend ourselves in court," said
Ellis grimly.</p>

<p>"Pooh! You don't suppose that brown-eyed girl&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do! <em>She</em> means mischief. If it had rested with
the other&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You're mistaken," said Jones, warmly. "I am perfectly persuaded
that if I had had half an hour's playful conversation with the
brown-eyed one&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You tried playfulness and fell down," observed Ellis, coldly.
"If I could have spoken to Miss Sandys&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What! A girl with steel-grey eyes like two poniards? A lot of
mercy she would show us! My dear fellow, trust in the brown eye
every time! The warm, humane, brown eye&mdash;the emotional, the melting,
the tender brown&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't trust it! Didn't she kodak twice? You and I are now in
her Rogues' Gallery. Besides, didn't she take notes on her pad?
I never observed anything humane in brown eyes."</p>

<p>Jones polished his nose with the mosquito salve.</p>

<p>"How do you know what she wanted my picture for?" he asked, annoyed.
"Perhaps she means to keep it for herself&mdash;if that grey-eyed one
lets her alone&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Let the grey-eyed one alone yourself," retorted Ellis, warmly.</p>

<p>"You'd better, too. Any expert in human character can tell you
which of those girls means mischief."</p>

<p>"If you think you're an expert&mdash;" began Ellis, irritated, then
stopped short. Jones followed his eyes.</p>

<p>"Look at that stream," said Ellis, dropping his rod against the
lean-to. "There's been a cloudburst in the mountains. There's
no rain here, but <em>look</em> at that stream! Yellow and bank-full!
Hark! Hear the falls. I have an idea the woods will be awash below
us in an hour."</p>

<p>They descended to the ledge which an hour ago had overhung the
stream. Now the water was level with it, lapping over it, rising
perceptibly in the few seconds they stood there. Alders and willows
along the banks, almost covered, staggered in the discolored water;
drift of all sorts came tumbling past, rotten branches, piles
of brush afloat, ferns and shrubs uprooted; the torrent was thick
with flakes of bark and forest mould and green-leaved twigs torn
from the stream-side.</p>

<p>From the lower reaches a deer came galloping toward the ridges;
a fox stole furtively into the open, hesitated, and slunk off
up the valley.</p>

<p>And now the shallow gorge began to roar under the rising flood;
tumbling castles of piled-up foam whirled into view; the amber
waves washed through the fringing beech growth, slopping into
hollows, setting the dead leaves afloat. A sucking sound filled
the woods; millions of tiny bubbles purred in the shallow overflow;
here and there dead branches stirred, swung and floated.</p>

<p>"Our camp is going to be an island pretty soon," observed Ellis;
"just look at&#11834;"</p>

<p>But Jones caught him by the arm. "<em>What</em> is that?" he
demanded shakily. "Are there things like that in these woods?"</p>

<p>At the same instant Ellis caught sight of something in midstream
bearing down on them in a smother of foam&mdash;an enormous lizard-like
creature floundering throat-deep in the flood.</p>

<p>"What is it, Ellis? Look! It's got a tail ten feet long! Great
Heaven, look at it!"</p>

<p>"I see it," said Ellis, hoarsely. "I never saw such a thing&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It's opening its jaws!" gasped Jones.</p>

<p>Ellis, a trifle white around the cheekbones, stared in frozen
silence at the fearsome creature as it swept down on them. A crested
wave rolled it over; four fearsome claws waved in the air; then
the creature righted itself and swung in toward the bank.</p>

<p>"Upon my word!" stammered Ellis; "it's part of their theatrical
property. Lord! how real it looked out yonder. I knew it couldn't
be alive, but &mdash;Jones, see how my hands are shaking. Would
you believe a man could be rattled like that?"</p>

<p>"Believe it? I should say I could! Look at the thing wabbling
there in the shallows as though it were trying to move its flippers!
<em>Look</em> at it, Ellis; see how it seems to wriggle and paddle&#11834;"</p>

<p>The words froze on his lips; the immense creature was moving;
the scaled claws churned the shallows; a spasm shook the head;
the jaws gaped.</p>

<p>"Help!" said a very sweet and frightened voice.</p>

<p>Ellis got hold of one claw, Jones the other, almost before they
comprehended&mdash;certainly before, deep in the scaly creature's maw,
they discovered the frightened but lovely features of the grey-eyed
girl who had snap-shot them.</p>

<p>"Please pull," she said; "I can't swim in <em>this</em>!"</p>

<p>Almost hysterically they soothed her as they tugged and steered
the thing into the flooded forest.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ellis&mdash;please&mdash;<em>please</em> don't pull quite so hard,"
she called out.</p>

<p>"Oh, did I hurt you?" he cried so tenderly that, even in the
shock of emotions, Jones was ashamed of him.</p>

<p>"No, you don't hurt me, Mr. Ellis; I'm all right inside here,
but I &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>you must not pull this papier-mâché dragon
to pieces&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What do I care for the dragon if you are in danger?" cried Ellis,
excitedly.</p>

<p>But it was a frightened and vexed voice that answered almost
tearfully: "If you pull too hard on the pasteboard legs something
dreadful may happen. <em>I&mdash;</em>this dragon is&mdash;is about the
only clothing I have on!"</p>

<p>Ellis dropped the flipper, seized it again, and gazed into the
scared eyes of Jones.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, go easy," he hissed, "or the thing will come
apart!"</p>

<p>Jones, in a cold perspiration, stood knee-deep in the flood,
not daring to touch the flipper again.</p>

<p>"You help here," he whispered, hoarsely. "If she stands up, now,
you can support her to camp, can't you?"</p>

<p>Ellis bent over and looked into the gaping jaws of Fafnir the
Dragon.</p>

<p>"Miss Sandys," he said seriously, "do you think you could get
on your hind&mdash;on your feet?"</p>

<p>The legs of the monster splashed, groping for the bottom; Ellis
passed his arm around the scaly body; Fafnir arose, rather wabbly,
and took one dripping step forward.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Beyond, rocking wildly in a gilded boat, sat
two people and a placid swan."]</p>

<p>"I fancy we can manage it now, Jones," said Ellis, cheerfully,
turning around; but Jones did not answer; he was running away,
dashing and splashing down the flooded forest. Beyond, rocking
wildly in a gilded boat, sat two people and a placid swan.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" faltered Ellis, as the dragon turned with a little
shriek. "Is the whole Summer School being washed away?"</p>

<p>"No," she said excitedly, "but the dam broke. Helen and Professor
Rawson tried to save the swan-boat&mdash;we were giving tableaux from
"Lohengrin" and "The Rheingold"&mdash;and&mdash;oh! oh! oh! such a torrent
came! Helen&mdash;there she is in armour &mdash;Helen tried to paddle
the boat, but the swans pulled the other way, and they flapped
so wildly that Helen called for help. Then one of the Rhine-maidens
&mdash;Professor Rawson&mdash;waded in and got aboard, but the paddle
broke and they were adrift. Then one of those horrid swans got
loose, and everybody screamed, and the water rose higher and higher,
and nobody helped anybody, so, so&mdash;as I swim well, I jumped in
without waiting to undress&mdash;you see I had been acting the dragon,
Fafnir, and I went in just as I was; but the papier-mâché dragon
kept turning turtle with me, and first I knew I was being spun
around like a top."</p>

<p>There was a silence; they stood watching Jones scrambling after
the swan-boat, which had come to grief in shallow water. Professor
Rawson, the Rhine-maiden, gave one raucous and perfunctory shriek
as Jones floundered alongside&mdash;for the garb of the normal Rhine-daughter
is scanty, and Professor Rawson's costume, as well as her maidenly
physique, was almost anything except redundant.</p>

<p>As for Helen, sometime known as brown-eyes, she rose to her slim
height, all glittering in tin armour, and gave Jones a smile of
heavenly gratitude that shot him through and through his Norfolk
jacket.</p>

<p>"Don't look!" said Professor Rawson, in a voice which, between
the emotions of recent terror and present bashfulness, had dwindled
to a squeak. "Don't look; I'm going to jump." And jump she did,
taking to the water with a trifle less grace than the ordinary
Rhine-maiden.</p>

<p>There was a spattering splash, a smothered squawk which may have
been emitted by the swan, and the next moment Professor Rawson
was churning toward dry land, her wreath of artificial seaweed
over one eye, her spectacles glittering amid her dank tresses.</p>

<p>Jones looked up at brown-eyes balancing in the bow of the painted
boat.</p>

<p>"I can get you ashore quite dry&mdash;if you don't mind," he said.</p>

<p>She considered the water; she considered Jones; she looked carefully
at the wallowing Rhine-daughter.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you can?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Perfectly certain," breathed Jones.</p>

<p>"I am rather heavy&#11834;"</p>

<p>The infatuated man laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll carry the swan," she said calmly; and, seizing
that dignified and astonished bird, she walked demurely off the
prow of the gaudy boat into the arms of Jones.</p>

<p>To Ellis and the grey-eyed dragon, and to Professor Rawson, who
had crawled to a dry spot on the ridge, there was a dreadful fascination
in watching that swaying pyramid of Jones, Lohengrin, and swan
tottering landward, knee-deep through the flood. The pyramid swayed
dangerously at times; but the girl in the tin armour clasped Jones
around the neck and clung to the off leg of the swan, and Jones
staggered on, half-strangled by the arm and buffeted by the flapping
bird, until his oozing shoes struck dry land.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Ellis, his enthusiasm breaking out after an agonizing
moment of suspense; and Miss Sandys, forgetting her plight, waved
her lizard claws and hailed rescuer and rescued with a clear-voiced
cheer as they came up excited and breathless, hustling before
them the outraged swan, who waddled furiously forward, craning
its neck and snapping.</p>

<p>"<em>What is that?</em>" muttered Jones aside to Ellis as the
dragon and Lohengrin embraced hysterically. He glanced toward
the Rhine-maiden, who was hiding behind a tree.</p>

<p>"Rhine wine with the cork pulled," replied Ellis, gravely. "Go
up to camp and get her your poncho. I'll do what I can to make
things comfortable in camp."</p>

<p>The girl in armour was saying, "You poor, brave dear! How perfectly
splendid it was of you to plunge into the flood with all that
pasteboard dragon-skin tied to you&mdash;like Horatius at the bridge.
Molly, I'm simply overcome at your bravery!"</p>

<p>And all the while she was saying this, Molly Sandys was saying:
"Helen, how did you ever dare to try to save the boat, with those
horrid swans flapping and nipping at you every second! It was
the most courageous thing I ever heard of, and I simply revere
you, Helen Gay!"</p>

<p>Jones, returning from camp with his poncho, said: "There's a
jolly fire in camp and plenty of provisions;" and sidled toward
the tree behind which Professor Rawson was attempting to prevent
several yards of cheese cloth from adhering too closely to her
outline.</p>

<p>"Go away!" said that spinster, severely, peering out at him with
a visage terminating in a length of swan-like neck which might
have been attractive if feathered.</p>

<p>"I'm only bringing you a poncho," said Jones, blushing.</p>

<p>Ellis heard a smothered giggle behind him, but when he turned
Molly Sandys had shrunk into her dragon-skin, and Helen Gay had
lowered the vizor of her helmet.</p>

<p>"I think we had better go to the camp-fire," he said gravely.
"It's only a step."</p>

<p>"We think so, too," they said. "Thank you for asking us, Mr.
Ellis."</p>

<p>So Ellis led the way; after him slopped the dragon, its scaled
tail dragging sticks and dead leaves in its wake; next waddled
the swan, perforce, prodded forward by the brown-eyed maid in
her tin armor. Professor Rawson, mercifully disguised in a rubber
poncho, under which her thin shins twinkled, came in the rear,
gallantly conducted by Jones in oozing shoes.</p>
