<p>They were playing that latest novelty from across the water,
"What’s he to Hecuba?" Sweet, sweet and piercing, the saxophone
pierced into the very bowels of compassion and tenderness, pierced
like a revelation from heaven, pierced like the angel’s treacly
dart into the holy Teresa’s quivering and ecstasiated flank. More
ripely and roundly, with a kindly and less agonizing voluptuousness,
the ’cello meditated those Mohammedan ecstasies that last, under
the green palms of Paradise, six hundred inenarrable years apiece.
Into this charged atmosphere the violin admitted refreshing draughts
of fresh air, cool and thin like the breath from a still damp
squirt. And the piano hammered and rattled away unmindful of the
sensibilities of the other instruments, banged away all the time
reminding every one concerned, in a thoroughly business-like way,
that this was a cabaret where people came to dance the fox-trot;
not a baroque church for female saints to go into ecstasies in,
not a mild, happy valley of tumbling houris.</p>

<p>At each recurrence of the refrain the four negroes of the orchestra,
or at least the three of them who played with their hands alone—for
the saxophonist always blew at this point with a redoubled sweetness,
enriching the passage with a warbling contrapuntal soliloquy that
fairly wrung the entrails and transported the pierced heart—broke
into melancholy and drawling song:</p>

"What’s he to Hecuba?<br/>
Nothing at all.<br/>
That’s why there’ll be no wedding on Wednesday week,<br/>
Way down in old Bengal."

<p>"What unspeakable sadness," said Gumbril, as he stepped, stepped
through the intricacies of the trot. "Eternal passion, eternal
pain. <em>Les chants désesperés sont les chants les plus beaux,
Et j’en sais d’immortels qui sont de purs sanglots.</em> Rum tiddle-um-tum,
pom-pom. Amen. What’s he to Hecuba? Nothing at all. Nothing, mark
you. Nothing, nothing."</p>

<p>"Nothing," repeated Mrs. Viveash. "I know all about that." She
sighed.</p>

<p>"I am nothing to you," said Gumbril, gliding with skill between
the wall and the Charybdis of a couple dangerously experimenting
with a new step. "You are nothing to me. Thank God. And yet here
we are, two bodies with but a single thought, a beast with two
backs, a perfectly united centaur trotting, trotting." They trotted.</p>

<p>"What’s he to Hecuba?" The grinning blackamoors repeated the
question, reiterated the answer on a tone of frightful unhappiness.
The saxophone warbled on the verge of anguish. The couples revolved,
marked time, stepped and stepped with an habitual precision, as
though performing some ancient and profoundly significant rite.
Some were in fancy dress, for this was a gala night at the cabaret.
Young women disguised as callipygous Florentine pages, blue-breeched
Gondoliers, black-breeched Toreadors circulated, moon-like, round
the hall, clasped sometimes in the arms of Arabs, or white clowns,
or more often of untravestied partners. The faces reflected in
the mirrors were the sort of faces one feels one ought to know
by sight; the cabaret was ‘Artistic.’</p>

<p>"What’s he to Hecuba?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash murmured the response, almost piously, as though
she were worshipping almighty and omnipresent Nil. "I adore this
tune," she said, "this divine tune." It filled up a space, it
moved, it jigged, it set things twitching in you, it occupied
time, it gave you a sense of being alive. "Divine tune, divine
tune," she repeated with emphasis, and she shut her eyes, trying
to abandon herself, trying to float, trying to give Nil the slip.</p>

<p>"Ravishing little Toreador, that," said Gumbril, who had been
following the black-breeched travesty with affectionate interest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash opened her eyes. Nil was unescapable. "With Piers
Cotton, you mean? Your tastes are a little common, my dear Theodore."</p>

<p>"Green-eyed monster!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash laughed. "When I was being ‘finished’ in Paris,"
she said, "Mademoiselle always used to urge me to take fencing
lessons. <em>C’est un exercice très gracieux. Et puis</em>," Mrs.
Viveash mimicked a passionate earnestness, "<em>et puis, ça dévelope
le bassin</em>. Your Toreador, Gumbril, looks as though she must
be a champion with the foils. <em>Quel bassin!</em>"</p>

<p>"Hush," said Gumbril. They were abreast of the Toreador and her
partner. Piers Cotton turned his long greyhound’s nose in their
direction.</p>

<p>"How are you?" he asked across the music.</p>

<p>They nodded. "And you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, writing such a book," cried Piers Cotton, "such a brilliant,
brilliant, flashing book." The dance was carrying them apart.
"Like a smile of false teeth," he shouted across the widening
gulf, and disappeared in the crowd.</p>

<p>"What’s he to Hecuba?" Lachrymosely, the hilarious blackamoors
chanted their question, mournfully pregnant with its foreknown
reply.</p>

<p>Nil, omnipresent nil, world-soul, spiritual informer of all matter.
Nil in the shape of a black-breeched moon-basined Toreador. Nil,
the man with the greyhound’s nose. Nil, as four blackamoors. Nil
in the form of a divine tune. Nil, the faces, the faces one ought
to know by sight, reflected in the mirrors of the hall. Nil this
Gumbril whose arm is round one’s waist, whose feet step in and
out among one’s own. Nothing at all.</p>

<p>That’s why there’ll be no wedding. No wedding at St. George’s,
Hanover Square,—oh, desperate experiment!—with Nil Viveash, that
charming boy, that charming nothing at all, engaged at the moment
in hunting elephants, hunting fever and carnivores among the Tikki-tikki
pygmies. That’s why there’ll be no wedding on Wednesday week.
For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime. For the light strawy
hair (not a lock left), the brown face, the red-brown hands and
the smooth boy’s body, milk-white, milk-warm, are nothing at all,
nothing, now, at all—nil these five years—and the shining blue
eyes as much nil as the rest.</p>

<p>"Always the same people," complained Mrs. Viveash, looking round
the room. "The old familiar faces. Never any one new. Where’s
the younger generation, Gumbril? We’re old, Theodore. There are
millions younger than we are. Where are they?"</p>

<p>"I’m not responsible for them," said Gumbril. "I’m not even responsible
for myself." He imagined a cottagey room, under the roof, with
a window near the floor and a sloping ceiling where you were always
bumping your head; and in the candlelight Emily’s candid eyes,
her grave and happy mouth; in the darkness, the curve, under his
fingers, of her firm body.</p>

<p>"Why don’t they come and sing for their supper?" Mrs. Viveash
went on petulantly. "It’s their business to amuse us."</p>

<p>"They’re probably thinking of amusing themselves," Gumbril suggested.</p>

<p>"Well, then, they should do it where we can see them."</p>

<p>"What’s he to Hecuba?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," Gumbril clownishly sang. The room, in the cottage,
had nothing to do with him. He breathed Mrs. Viveash’s memories
of Italian jasmines, laid his cheek for a moment against her smooth
hair. "Nothing at all." Happy clown!</p>

<p>Way down in old Bengal, under the green Paradisiac palms, among
the ecstatic mystagogues and the saints who scream beneath the
divine caresses, the music came to an end. The four negroes wiped
their glistening faces. The couples fell apart. Gumbril and Mrs.
Viveash sat down and smoked a cigarette. </p>
