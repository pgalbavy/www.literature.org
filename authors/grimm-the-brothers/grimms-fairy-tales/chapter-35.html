<p>There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest:
but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he
had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of
shoes.
</p><p>Then he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning
to rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and
his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed,
left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after
he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his
great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The
good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.
He looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the
whole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.
</p><p>The same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that
he willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor
shoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more.
In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might
get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for
when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon
in came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought
leather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight
and found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some
time: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and
the good man soon became thriving and well off again.
</p><p>One evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over
the fire chatting together, he said to her, ‘I should like to sit up and
watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for
me.’ The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid
themselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up
there, and watched what would happen.
</p><p>As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and
they sat themselves upon the shoemaker’s bench, took up all the work
that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching
and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all
wonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the
job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.
This was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as
lightning.
</p><p>The next day the wife said to the shoemaker. ‘These little wights have
made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good
turn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and
indeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to
keep off the cold. I’ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt,
and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and
do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.’
</p><p>The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when
all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the
work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to
watch what the little elves would do.
</p><p>About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the
room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they
saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed
mightily delighted.
</p><p>Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and
capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced
out at the door, and away over the green.
</p><p>The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them
from that time forward, as long as they lived.
</p>

<p><strong>THE JUNIPER-TREE</strong>
</p><p>Long, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich
man with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but
sorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desire
to have one, that the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they
remained childless.
</p><p>In front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree.
One winter’s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and
as she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the
snow. ‘Ah,’ sighed the woman heavily, ‘if I had but a child, as red as
blood and as white as snow,’ and as she spoke the words, her heart grew
light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and
she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed,
and the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by, and all
the earth was green. So the months followed one another, and first the
trees budded in the woods, and soon the green branches grew thickly
intertwined, and then the blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife
stood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her
heart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that
she fell on her knees. Presently the fruit became round and firm, and
she was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the
berries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill. A little
while later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping. ‘If I
die, bury me under the juniper-tree.’ Then she felt comforted and happy
again, and before another month had passed she had a little child, and
when she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy
was so great that she died.
</p><p>Her husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for
her. By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he
still grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later
on he married again.
</p><p>He now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife
was a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother
loved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked
at the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in
the way of her own child, and she was continually thinking how she could
get the whole of the property for her. This evil thought took possession
of her more and more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. She
drove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the
poor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left
school to the time he went back.
</p><p>One day the little daughter came running to her mother in the
store-room, and said, ‘Mother, give me an apple.’ ‘Yes, my child,’ said
the wife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest
had a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.
</p><p>‘Mother,’ said the little daughter again, ‘may not brother have one
too?’ The mother was angry at this, but she answered, ‘Yes, when he
comes out of school.’
</p><p>Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed
as if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out
of her little daughter’s hand, and said, ‘You shall not have one before
your brother.’ She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. The
little boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say
kindly to him, ‘My son, will you have an apple?’ but she gave him a
wicked look. ‘Mother,’ said the boy, ‘how dreadful you look! Yes, give
me an apple.’ The thought came to her that she would kill him. ‘Come
with me,’ she said, and she lifted up the lid of the chest; ‘take one
out for yourself.’ And as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged
her, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the little boy’s head.
Then she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done.
‘If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it,’ she thought. So
she went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of
her top drawer; then she set the boy’s head again on his shoulders, and
bound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed
him on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.
</p><p>Soon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring
a pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, ‘Mother, brother is
sitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale;
and when I asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that
frightened me.’
</p><p>‘Go to him again,’ said her mother, ‘and if he does not answer, give him
a box on the ear.’ So little Marleen went, and said, ‘Brother, give me
that apple,’ but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the
ear, and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this, that she ran
crying and screaming to her mother. ‘Oh!’ she said, ‘I have knocked off
brother’s head,’ and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.
</p><p>‘What have you done!’ said her mother, ‘but no one must know about it,
so you must keep silence; what is done can’t be undone; we will make
him into puddings.’ And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him
into puddings, and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking on,
and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no
need of salt.
</p><p>Presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked,
‘Where is my son?’ The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of
black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.
</p><p>The father again asked, ‘Where is my son?’
</p><p>‘Oh,’ answered the wife, ‘he is gone into the country to his mother’s
great uncle; he is going to stay there some time.’
</p><p>‘What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!’
</p><p>‘Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six
weeks; he is well looked after there.’
</p><p>‘I feel very unhappy about it,’ said the husband, ‘in case it should not
be all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.’
</p><p>With this he went on with his dinner, and said, ‘Little Marleen, why do
you weep? Brother will soon be back.’ Then he asked his wife for more
pudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.
</p><p>Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of
her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the
table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but
weep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and
she had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her,
and she wept no more. And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the
branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and
then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for
joy. After this a mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there
was a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful
bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when it
could no more be seen, the juniper-tree stood there as before, and the
silk handkerchief and the bones were gone.
</p><p>Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were
still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to
the table and ate.
</p><p>The bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to
sing:
</p><p> ‘My mother killed her little son;<br/>
  My father grieved when I was gone;<br/>
  My sister loved me best of all;<br/>
  She laid her kerchief over me,<br/>
  And took my bones that they might lie
  Underneath the juniper-tree<br/>
  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’
</p><p>The goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the
song of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he got
up and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his
slippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on
one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still
held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing
up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.
</p><p>‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing! Sing me that song again.’
</p><p>‘Nay,’ said the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that gold
chain, and I will sing it you again.’
</p><p>‘Here is the chain, take it,’ said the goldsmith. ‘Only sing me that
again.’
</p><p>The bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then
he alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:
</p><p> ‘My mother killed her little son;<br/>
  My father grieved when I was gone;<br/>
  My sister loved me best of all;<br/>
  She laid her kerchief over me,<br/>
  And took my bones that they might lie
  Underneath the juniper-tree<br/>
  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’
</p><p>Then he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker’s house and
sang:
</p><p> ‘My mother killed her little son;<br/>
  My father grieved when I was gone;<br/>
  My sister loved me best of all;<br/>
  She laid her kerchief over me,<br/>
  And took my bones that they might lie
  Underneath the juniper-tree<br/>
  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’
</p><p>The shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his
shirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his
hand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.
</p><p>‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing!’ Then he called through the
door to his wife: ‘Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it
and hear how beautifully it sings.’ Then he called his daughter and the
children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the
street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red
and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two
bright stars in its head.
</p><p>‘Bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘sing me that song again.’
</p><p>‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; you must
give me something.’
</p><p>‘Wife,’ said the man, ‘go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will
see a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.’ The wife went in and fetched
the shoes.
</p><p>‘There, bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘now sing me that song again.’
</p><p>The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he
went back to the roof and sang:
</p><p> ‘My mother killed her little son;<br/>
  My father grieved when I was gone;<br/>
  My sister loved me best of all;<br/>
  She laid her kerchief over me,<br/>
  And took my bones that they might lie
  Underneath the juniper-tree<br/>
  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’
</p><p>When he had finished, he flew away. He had the chain in his right claw
and the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the
mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click clack.’ Inside the mill were
twenty of the miller’s men hewing a stone, and as they went ‘Hick hack,
hick hack, hick hack,’ the mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click
clack.’
</p><p>The bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:
</p><p> ‘My mother killed her little son;
</p><p>then one of the men left off,
</p><p>  My father grieved when I was gone;
</p><p>two more men left off and listened,
</p><p>  My sister loved me best of all;
</p><p>then four more left off,
</p><p>  She laid her kerchief over me,<br/>
  And took my bones that they might lie
</p><p>now there were only eight at work,
</p><p>  Underneath
</p><p>And now only five,
</p><p>  the juniper-tree.
</p><p>And now only one,
</p><p>  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’
</p><p>then he looked up and the last one had left off work.
</p><p>‘Bird,’ he said, ‘what a beautiful song that is you sing! Let me hear it
too; sing it again.’
</p><p>‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that
millstone, and I will sing it again.’
</p><p>‘If it belonged to me alone,’ said the man, ‘you should have it.’
</p><p>‘Yes, yes,’ said the others: ‘if he will sing again, he can have it.’
</p><p>The bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the
stone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took
the stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the
tree and sang--
</p><p> ‘My mother killed her little son;<br/>
  My father grieved when I was gone;<br/>
  My sister loved me best of all;<br/>
  She laid her kerchief over me,<br/>
  And took my bones that they might lie
  Underneath the juniper-tree<br/>
  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’
</p><p>And when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the
chain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round
his neck, he flew right away to his father’s house.
</p><p>The father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner.
</p><p>‘How lighthearted I feel,’ said the father, ‘so pleased and cheerful.’
</p><p>‘And I,’ said the mother, ‘I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm
were coming.’
</p><p>But little Marleen sat and wept and wept.
</p><p>Then the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.
</p><p>‘I do feel so happy,’ said the father, ‘and how beautifully the sun
shines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.’
</p><p>‘Ah!’ said the wife, ‘and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that
my teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,’ and
she tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the
corner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.
</p><p>The bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:
</p><p> ‘My mother killed her little son;
</p><p>the mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear
nothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a
violent storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:
</p><p>  My father grieved when I was gone;
</p><p>‘Look, mother,’ said the man, ‘at the beautiful bird that is singing so
magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious
scent of spice in the air!’
</p><p>  My sister loved me best of all;
</p><p>then little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.
</p><p>‘I must go outside and see the bird nearer,’ said the man.
</p><p>‘Ah, do not go!’ cried the wife. ‘I feel as if the whole house were in
flames!’
</p><p>But the man went out and looked at the bird.
</p><p> She laid her kerchief over me,<br/>
 And took my bones that they might lie<br/>
 Underneath the juniper-tree<br/>
 Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’
</p><p>With that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the
man’s neck, so that it fitted him exactly.
</p><p>He went inside, and said, ‘See, what a splendid bird that is; he has
given me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.’
</p><p>But the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor,
and her cap fell from her head.
</p><p>Then the bird began again:
</p><p> ‘My mother killed her little son;
</p><p>‘Ah me!’ cried the wife, ‘if I were but a thousand feet beneath the
earth, that I might not hear that song.’
</p><p>  My father grieved when I was gone;
</p><p>then the woman fell down again as if dead.
</p><p>  My sister loved me best of all;
</p><p>‘Well,’ said little Marleen, ‘I will go out too and see if the bird will
give me anything.’
</p><p>So she went out.
</p><p>  She laid her kerchief over me,<br/>
  And took my bones that they might lie
</p><p>and he threw down the shoes to her,
</p><p>  Underneath the juniper-tree<br/>
  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’
</p><p>And she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and
danced and jumped about in them. ‘I was so miserable,’ she said, ‘when I
came out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird,
and he has given me a pair of red shoes.’
</p><p>The wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like flames
of fire. ‘Then I will go out too,’ she said, ‘and see if it will lighten
my misery, for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.’
</p><p>But as she crossed the threshold, crash! the bird threw the millstone
down on her head, and she was crushed to death.
</p><p>The father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only
saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had
passed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and
little Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went
inside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.
