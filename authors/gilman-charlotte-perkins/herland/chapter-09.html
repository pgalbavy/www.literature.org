<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>What I’m trying to show here is that with these women the whole
relationship of life counted in a glad, eager growing-up to join the
ranks of workers in the line best loved; a deep, tender reverence for
one’s own mother--too deep for them to speak of freely--and beyond that,
the whole, free, wide range of sisterhood, the splendid service of the
country, and friendships.
</p>
<p>To these women we came, filled with the ideas, convictions, traditions,
of our culture, and undertook to rouse in them the emotions which--to
us--seemed proper.
</p><p>However much, or little, of true sex-feeling there was between us, it
phrased itself in their minds in terms of friendship, the one purely
personal love they knew, and of ultimate parentage. Visibly we were not
mothers, nor children, nor compatriots; so, if they loved us, we must be
friends.
</p><p>That we should pair off together in our courting days was natural to
them; that we three should remain much together, as they did themselves,
was also natural. We had as yet no work, so we hung about them in their
forest tasks; that was natural, too.
</p><p>But when we began to talk about each couple having “homes” of our own,
they could not understand it.
</p><p>“Our work takes us all around the country,” explained Celis. “We cannot
live in one place all the time.”
</p><p>“We are together now,” urged Alima, looking proudly at Terry’s stalwart
nearness. (This was one of the times when they were “on,” though
presently “off” again.)
</p><p>“It’s not the same thing at all,” he insisted. “A man wants a home of
his own, with his wife and family in it.”
</p><p>“Staying in it? All the time?” asked Ellador. “Not imprisoned, surely!”
</p><p>“Of course not! Living there--naturally,” he answered.
</p><p>“What does she do there--all the time?” Alima demanded. “What is her
work?”
</p><p>Then Terry patiently explained again that our women did not work--with
reservations.
</p><p>“But what do they do--if they have no work?” she persisted.
</p><p>“They take care of the home--and the children.”
</p><p>“At the same time?” asked Ellador.
</p><p>“Why yes. The children play about, and the mother has charge of it all.
There are servants, of course.”
</p><p>It seemed so obvious, so natural to Terry, that he always grew
impatient; but the girls were honestly anxious to understand.
</p><p>“How many children do your women have?” Alima had her notebook out now,
and a rather firm set of lip. Terry began to dodge.
</p><p>“There is no set number, my dear,” he explained. “Some have more, some
have less.”
</p><p>“Some have none at all,” I put in mischievously.
</p><p>They pounced on this admission and soon wrung from us the general fact
that those women who had the most children had the least servants, and
those who had the most servants had the least children.
</p><p>“There!” triumphed Alima. “One or two or no children, and three or four
servants. Now what do those women DO?”
</p><p>We explained as best we might. We talked of “social duties,”
 disingenuously banking on their not interpreting the words as we did; we
talked of hospitality, entertainment, and various “interests.” All the
time we knew that to these large-minded women whose whole mental outlook
was so collective, the limitations of a wholly personal life were
inconceivable.
</p><p>“We cannot really understand it,” Ellador concluded. “We are only half
a people. We have our woman-ways and they have their man-ways and their
both-ways. We have worked out a system of living which is, of course,
limited. They must have a broader, richer, better one. I should like to
see it.”
</p><p>“You shall, dearest,” I whispered.
</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to smoke,” complained Terry. He was in the midst of a
prolonged quarrel with Alima, and needed a sedative. “There’s nothing to
drink. These blessed women have no pleasant vices. I wish we could get
out of here!”
</p><p>This wish was vain. We were always under a certain degree of
watchfulness. When Terry burst forth to tramp the streets at night he
always found a “Colonel” here or there; and when, on an occasion of
fierce though temporary despair, he had plunged to the cliff edge with
some vague view to escape, he found several of them close by. We were
free--but there was a string to it.
</p><p>“They’ve no unpleasant ones, either,” Jeff reminded him.
</p><p>“Wish they had!” Terry persisted. “They’ve neither the vices of men, nor
the virtues of women--they’re neuters!”
</p><p>“You know better than that. Don’t talk nonsense,” said I, severely.
</p><p>I was thinking of Ellador’s eyes when they gave me a certain look, a
look she did not at all realize.
</p><p>Jeff was equally incensed. “I don’t know what ‘virtues of women’ you
miss. Seems to me they have all of them.”
</p><p>“They’ve no modesty,” snapped Terry. “No patience, no submissiveness,
none of that natural yielding which is woman’s greatest charm.”
</p><p>I shook my head pityingly. “Go and apologize and make friends again,
Terry. You’ve got a grouch, that’s all. These women have the virtue
of humanity, with less of its faults than any folks I ever saw. As for
patience--they’d have pitched us over the cliffs the first day we lit
among ‘em, if they hadn’t that.”
</p><p>“There are no--distractions,” he grumbled. “Nowhere a man can go and cut
loose a bit. It’s an everlasting parlor and nursery.”
</p><p>“And workshop,” I added. “And school, and office, and laboratory, and
studio, and theater, and--home.”
</p><p>“HOME!” he sneered. “There isn’t a home in the whole pitiful place.”
</p><p>“There isn’t anything else, and you know it,” Jeff retorted hotly. “I
never saw, I never dreamed of, such universal peace and good will and
mutual affection.”
</p><p>“Oh, well, of course, if you like a perpetual Sunday school, it’s all
very well. But I like Something Doing. Here it’s all done.”
</p><p>There was something to this criticism. The years of pioneering lay far
behind them. Theirs was a civilization in which the initial difficulties
had long since been overcome. The untroubled peace, the unmeasured
plenty, the steady health, the large good will and smooth management
which ordered everything, left nothing to overcome. It was like a
pleasant family in an old established, perfectly run country place.
</p><p>I liked it because of my eager and continued interest in the
sociological achievements involved. Jeff liked it as he would have liked
such a family and such a place anywhere.
</p><p>Terry did not like it because he found nothing to oppose, to struggle
with, to conquer.
</p><p>“Life is a struggle, has to be,” he insisted. “If there is no struggle,
there is no life--that’s all.”
</p><p>“You’re talking nonsense--masculine nonsense,” the peaceful Jeff
replied. He was certainly a warm defender of Herland. “Ants don’t raise
their myriads by a struggle, do they? Or the bees?”
</p><p>“Oh, if you go back to insects--and want to live in an anthill--! I tell
you the higher grades of life are reached only through struggle--combat.
There’s no Drama here. Look at their plays! They make me sick.”
</p><p>He rather had us there. The drama of the country was--to our
taste--rather flat. You see, they lacked the sex motive and, with it,
jealousy. They had no interplay of warring nations, no aristocracy and
its ambitions, no wealth and poverty opposition.
</p><p>I see I have said little about the economics of the place; it should
have come before, but I’ll go on about the drama now.
</p><p>They had their own kind. There was a most impressive array of pageantry,
of processions, a sort of grand ritual, with their arts and their
religion broadly blended. The very babies joined in it. To see one of
their great annual festivals, with the massed and marching stateliness
of those great mothers, the young women brave and noble, beautiful and
strong; and then the children, taking part as naturally as ours would
frolic round a Christmas tree--it was overpowering in the impression of
joyous, triumphant life.
</p><p>They had begun at a period when the drama, the dance, music, religion,
and education were all very close together; and instead of developing
them in detached lines, they had kept the connection. Let me try again
to give, if I can, a faint sense of the difference in the life view--the
background and basis on which their culture rested.
</p><p>Ellador told me a lot about it. She took me to see the children, the
growing girls, the special teachers. She picked out books for me to
read. She always seemed to understand just what I wanted to know, and
how to give it to me.
</p><p>While Terry and Alima struck sparks and parted--he always madly drawn
to her and she to him--she must have been, or she’d never have stood the
way he behaved--Ellador and I had already a deep, restful feeling, as
if we’d always had one another. Jeff and Celis were happy; there was no
question of that; but it didn’t seem to me as if they had the good times
we did.
</p><p>Well, here is the Herland child facing life--as Ellador tried to show
it to me. From the first memory, they knew Peace, Beauty, Order, Safety,
Love, Wisdom, Justice, Patience, and Plenty. By “plenty” I mean that the
babies grew up in an environment which met their needs, just as young
fawns might grow up in dewy forest glades and brook-fed meadows. And
they enjoyed it as frankly and utterly as the fawns would.
</p><p>They found themselves in a big bright lovely world, full of the most
interesting and enchanting things to learn about and to do. The people
everywhere were friendly and polite. No Herland child ever met the
overbearing rudeness we so commonly show to children. They were People,
too, from the first; the most precious part of the nation.
</p><p>In each step of the rich experience of living, they found the instance
they were studying widen out into contact with an endless range of
common interests. The things they learned were RELATED, from the first;
related to one another, and to the national prosperity.
</p><p>“It was a butterfly that made me a forester,” said Ellador. “I was about
eleven years old, and I found a big purple-and-green butterfly on a low
flower. I caught it, very carefully, by the closed wings, as I had been
told to do, and carried it to the nearest insect teacher”--I made a note
there to ask her what on earth an insect teacher was--“to ask her its
name. She took it from me with a little cry of delight. ‘Oh, you blessed
child,’ she said. ‘Do you like obernuts?’ Of course I liked obernuts,
and said so. It is our best food-nut, you know. ‘This is a female of the
obernut moth,’ she told me. ‘They are almost gone. We have been trying
to exterminate them for centuries. If you had not caught this one, it
might have laid eggs enough to raise worms enough to destroy thousands
of our nut trees--thousands of bushels of nuts--and make years and years
of trouble for us.’
</p><p>“Everybody congratulated me. The children all over the country were told
to watch for that moth, if there were any more. I was shown the history
of the creature, and an account of the damage it used to do and of how
long and hard our foremothers had worked to save that tree for us. I
grew a foot, it seemed to me, and determined then and there to be a
forester.”
</p><p>This is but an instance; she showed me many. The big difference was that
whereas our children grow up in private homes and families, with every
effort made to protect and seclude them from a dangerous world, here
they grew up in a wide, friendly world, and knew it for theirs, from the
first.
</p><p>Their child-literature was a wonderful thing. I could have spent years
following the delicate subtleties, the smooth simplicities with which
they had bent that great art to the service of the child mind.
</p><p>We have two life cycles: the man’s and the woman’s. To the man there is
growth, struggle, conquest, the establishment of his family, and as much
further success in gain or ambition as he can achieve.
</p><p>To the woman, growth, the securing of a husband, the subordinate
activities of family life, and afterward such “social” or charitable
interests as her position allows.
</p><p>Here was but one cycle, and that a large one.
</p><p>The child entered upon a broad open field of life, in which motherhood
was the one great personal contribution to the national life, and all
the rest the individual share in their common activities. Every girl I
talked to, at any age above babyhood, had her cheerful determination as
to what she was going to be when she grew up.
</p><p>What Terry meant by saying they had no “modesty” was that this great
life-view had no shady places; they had a high sense of personal
decorum, but no shame--no knowledge of anything to be ashamed of.
</p><p>Even their shortcomings and misdeeds in childhood never were presented
to them as sins; merely as errors and misplays--as in a game. Some of
them, who were palpably less agreeable than others or who had a real
weakness or fault, were treated with cheerful allowance, as a friendly
group at whist would treat a poor player.
</p><p>Their religion, you see, was maternal; and their ethics, based on the
full perception of evolution, showed the principle of growth and the
beauty of wise culture. They had no theory of the essential opposition
of good and evil; life to them was growth; their pleasure was in
growing, and their duty also.
</p><p>With this background, with their sublimated mother-love, expressed in
terms of widest social activity, every phase of their work was modified
by its effect on the national growth. The language itself they had
deliberately clarified, simplified, made easy and beautiful, for the
sake of the children.
</p><p>This seemed to us a wholly incredible thing: first, that any nation
should have the foresight, the strength, and the persistence to plan
and fulfill such a task; and second, that women should have had so much
initiative. We have assumed, as a matter of course, that women had
none; that only the man, with his natural energy and impatience of
restriction, would ever invent anything.
</p><p>Here we found that the pressure of life upon the environment develops in
the human mind its inventive reactions, regardless of sex; and further,
that a fully awakened motherhood plans and works without limit, for the
good of the child.
</p><p>That the children might be most nobly born, and reared in an environment
calculated to allow the richest, freest growth, they had deliberately
remodeled and improved the whole state.
</p><p>I do not mean in the least that they stopped at that, any more than
a child stops at childhood. The most impressive part of their whole
culture beyond this perfect system of child-rearing was the range of
interests and associations open to them all, for life. But in the field
of literature I was most struck, at first, by the child-motive.
</p><p>They had the same gradation of simple repetitive verse and story that we
are familiar with, and the most exquisite, imaginative tales; but where,
with us, these are the dribbled remnants of ancient folk myths and
primitive lullabies, theirs were the exquisite work of great artists;
not only simple and unfailing in appeal to the child-mind, but TRUE,
true to the living world about them.
</p><p>To sit in one of their nurseries for a day was to change one’s views
forever as to babyhood. The youngest ones, rosy fatlings in their
mothers’ arms, or sleeping lightly in the flower-sweet air, seemed
natural enough, save that they never cried. I never heard a child cry in
Herland, save once or twice at a bad fall; and then people ran to help,
as we would at a scream of agony from a grown person.
</p><p>Each mother had her year of glory; the time to love and learn, living
closely with her child, nursing it proudly, often for two years or more.
This perhaps was one reason for their wonderful vigor.
</p><p>But after the baby-year the mother was not so constantly in attendance,
unless, indeed, her work was among the little ones. She was never
far off, however, and her attitude toward the co-mothers, whose proud
child-service was direct and continuous, was lovely to see.
</p><p>As for the babies--a group of those naked darlings playing on short
velvet grass, clean-swept; or rugs as soft; or in shallow pools of
bright water; tumbling over with bubbling joyous baby laughter--it was a
view of infant happiness such as I had never dreamed.
</p><p>The babies were reared in the warmer part of the country, and gradually
acclimated to the cooler heights as they grew older.
</p><p>Sturdy children of ten and twelve played in the snow as joyfully as ours
do; there were continuous excursions of them, from one part of the land
to another, so that to each child the whole country might be home.
</p><p>It was all theirs, waiting for them to learn, to love, to use, to serve;
as our own little boys plan to be “a big soldier,” or “a cowboy,” or
whatever pleases their fancy; and our little girls plan for the kind of
home they mean to have, or how many children; these planned, freely and
gaily with much happy chattering, of what they would do for the country
when they were grown.
</p><p>It was the eager happiness of the children and young people which first
made me see the folly of that common notion of ours--that if life was
smooth and happy, people would not enjoy it.
</p><p>As I studied these youngsters, vigorous, joyous, eager little creatures,
and their voracious appetite for life, it shook my previous ideas so
thoroughly that they have never been re-established. The steady level of
good health gave them all that natural stimulus we used to call “animal
spirits”--an odd contradiction in terms. They found themselves in an
immediate environment which was agreeable and interesting, and before
them stretched the years of learning and discovery, the fascinating,
endless process of education.
</p><p>As I looked into these methods and compared them with our own, my
strange uncomfortable sense of race-humility grew apace.
</p><p>Ellador could not understand my astonishment. She explained things
kindly and sweetly, but with some amazement that they needed explaining,
and with sudden questions as to how we did it that left me meeker than
ever.
</p><p>I betook myself to Somel one day, carefully not taking Ellador. I did
not mind seeming foolish to Somel--she was used to it.
</p><p>“I want a chapter of explanation,” I told her. “You know my stupidities
by heart, and I do not want to show them to Ellador--she thinks me so
wise!”
</p><p>She smiled delightedly. “It is beautiful to see,” she told me, “this
new wonderful love between you. The whole country is interested, you
know--how can we help it!”
</p><p>I had not thought of that. We say: “All the world loves a lover,” but
to have a couple of million people watching one’s courtship--and that a
difficult one--was rather embarrassing.
</p><p>“Tell me about your theory of education,” I said. “Make it short and
easy. And, to show you what puzzles me, I’ll tell you that in our theory
great stress is laid on the forced exertion of the child’s mind; we
think it is good for him to overcome obstacles.”
</p><p>“Of course it is,” she unexpectedly agreed. “All our children do
that--they love to.”
</p><p>That puzzled me again. If they loved to do it, how could it be
educational?
</p><p>“Our theory is this,” she went on carefully. “Here is a young human
being. The mind is as natural a thing as the body, a thing that grows,
a thing to use and enjoy. We seek to nourish, to stimulate, to exercise
the mind of a child as we do the body. There are the two main divisions
in education--you have those of course?--the things it is necessary to
know, and the things it is necessary to do.”
</p><p>“To do? Mental exercises, you mean?”
</p><p>“Yes. Our general plan is this: In the matter of feeding the mind,
of furnishing information, we use our best powers to meet the natural
appetite of a healthy young brain; not to overfeed it, to provide such
amount and variety of impressions as seem most welcome to each child.
That is the easiest part. The other division is in arranging a properly
graduated series of exercises which will best develop each mind; the
common faculties we all have, and most carefully, the especial faculties
some of us have. You do this also, do you not?”
</p><p>“In a way,” I said rather lamely. “We have not so subtle and highly
developed a system as you, not approaching it; but tell me more. As
to the information--how do you manage? It appears that all of you know
pretty much everything--is that right?”
</p><p>This she laughingly disclaimed. “By no means. We are, as you soon found
out, extremely limited in knowledge. I wish you could realize what a
ferment the country is in over the new things you have told us; the
passionate eagerness among thousands of us to go to your country and
learn--learn--learn! But what we do know is readily divisible into
common knowledge and special knowledge. The common knowledge we have
long since learned to feed into the minds of our little ones with no
waste of time or strength; the special knowledge is open to all, as
they desire it. Some of us specialize in one line only. But most take up
several--some for their regular work, some to grow with.”
</p><p>“To grow with?”
</p><p>“Yes. When one settles too close in one kind of work there is a tendency
to atrophy in the disused portions of the brain. We like to keep on
learning, always.”
</p><p>“What do you study?”
</p><p>“As much as we know of the different sciences. We have, within our
limits, a good deal of knowledge of anatomy, physiology, nutrition--all
that pertains to a full and beautiful personal life. We have our botany
and chemistry, and so on--very rudimentary, but interesting; our own
history, with its accumulating psychology.”
</p><p>“You put psychology with history--not with personal life?”
</p><p>“Of course. It is ours; it is among and between us, and it changes with
the succeeding and improving generations. We are at work, slowly and
carefully, developing our whole people along these lines. It is glorious
work--splendid! To see the thousands of babies improving, showing
stronger clearer minds, sweeter dispositions, higher capacities--don’t
you find it so in your country?”
</p><p>This I evaded flatly. I remembered the cheerless claim that the human
mind was no better than in its earliest period of savagery, only better
informed--a statement I had never believed.
</p><p>“We try most earnestly for two powers,” Somel continued. “The two that
seem to us basically necessary for all noble life: a clear, far-reaching
judgment, and a strong well-used will. We spend our best efforts, all
through childhood and youth, in developing these faculties, individual
judgment and will.”
</p><p>“As part of your system of education, you mean?”
</p><p>“Exactly. As the most valuable part. With the babies, as you may have
noticed, we first provide an environment which feeds the mind without
tiring it; all manner of simple and interesting things to do, as soon
as they are old enough to do them; physical properties, of course, come
first. But as early as possible, going very carefully, not to tax the
mind, we provide choices, simple choices, with very obvious causes and
consequences. You’ve noticed the games?”
</p><p>I had. The children seemed always playing something; or else, sometimes,
engaged in peaceful researches of their own. I had wondered at first
when they went to school, but soon found that they never did--to their
knowledge. It was all education but no schooling.
</p><p>“We have been working for some sixteen hundred years, devising better
and better games for children,” continued Somel.
</p><p>I sat aghast. “Devising games?” I protested. “Making up new ones, you
mean?”
</p><p>“Exactly,” she answered. “Don’t you?”
</p><p>Then I remembered the kindergarten, and the “material” devised by
Signora Montessori, and guardedly replied: “To some extent.” But most
of our games, I told her, were very old--came down from child to child,
along the ages, from the remote past.
</p><p>“And what is their effect?” she asked. “Do they develop the faculties
you wish to encourage?”
</p><p>Again I remembered the claims made by the advocates of “sports,” and
again replied guardedly that that was, in part, the theory.
</p><p>“But do the children LIKE it?” I asked. “Having things made up and set
before them that way? Don’t they want the old games?”
</p><p>“You can see the children,” she answered. “Are yours more
contented--more interested--happier?”
</p><p>Then I thought, as in truth I never had thought before, of the dull,
bored children I had seen, whining; “What can I do now?”; of the little
groups and gangs hanging about; of the value of some one strong spirit
who possessed initiative and would “start something”; of the children’s
parties and the onerous duties of the older people set to “amuse the
children”; also of that troubled ocean of misdirected activity we call
“mischief,” the foolish, destructive, sometimes evil things done by
unoccupied children.
</p><p>“No,” said I grimly. “I don’t think they are.”
</p><p>The Herland child was born not only into a world carefully prepared,
full of the most fascinating materials and opportunities to learn, but
into the society of plentiful numbers of teachers, teachers born and
trained, whose business it was to accompany the children along that, to
us, impossible thing--the royal road to learning.
</p><p>There was no mystery in their methods. Being adapted to children it was
at least comprehensible to adults. I spent many days with the little
ones, sometimes with Ellador, sometimes without, and began to feel a
crushing pity for my own childhood, and for all others that I had known.
</p><p>The houses and gardens planned for babies had in them nothing to
hurt--no stairs, no corners, no small loose objects to swallow, no
fire--just a babies’ paradise. They were taught, as rapidly as
feasible, to use and control their own bodies, and never did I see such
sure-footed, steady-handed, clear-headed little things. It was a joy
to watch a row of toddlers learning to walk, not only on a level floor,
but, a little later, on a sort of rubber rail raised an inch or two
above the soft turf or heavy rugs, and falling off with shrieks of
infant joy, to rush back to the end of the line and try again. Surely we
have noticed how children love to get up on something and walk along it!
But we have never thought to provide that simple and inexhaustible form
of amusement and physical education for the young.
</p><p>Water they had, of course, and could swim even before they walked. If I
feared at first the effects of a too intensive system of culture, that
fear was dissipated by seeing the long sunny days of pure physical
merriment and natural sleep in which these heavenly babies passed their
first years. They never knew they were being educated. They did not
dream that in this association of hilarious experiment and achievement
they were laying the foundation for that close beautiful group feeling
into which they grew so firmly with the years. This was education for
citizenship.
