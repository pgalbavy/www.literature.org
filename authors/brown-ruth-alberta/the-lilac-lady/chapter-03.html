<p>The days which followed the advent of the orphan sisters in the
great house were happy ones. Oh, so happy! How can they be described?
The two lonely old hearts which had hungered all these long years
for the little children who had so early left them thrilled with
gladness at every sound of the eager, girlish voices. Boundless
content reigned in their hearts as they watched each expressive
face and studied each different character; and they wondered openly
how they had ever managed to live without this precious band of
granddaughters, as they insisted upon calling their charges.</p>

<p>And the girls were equally happy. Gail felt as if a great weight
had been lifted from her shoulders, as if her soul had been suddenly
freed from a dark prison. The care-worn look vanished from the
thin face; the big, gray-blue eyes sparkled with animation; her
heart bubbled over with gratitude and love; and in every possible
way she tried to show these new guardians how deeply and tenderly
she loved them. And her attitude was that of the other sisters
also, except that each took her own method of showing it. The
Campbells were well satisfied with their experiment and were never
tired of saying to each, other, "They are ours now."</p>

<p>"Yes," Peace had answered them once when she had overheard these
words; "we are yours now, but it seems to me 'sif we had always
belonged to you. Some way, we fit in just as slick! 'Sif we had
only been away on a vacation and just got home again, and you're
tickled to see us and we're tickled to see you. Only&mdash;s'posing
we really had been your granddaughters, s'posing you had been
our Grandpa Greenfield, I bet <em>you'd</em> never have named
me Peace."</p>

<p>"No," Dr. Campbell replied gravely, but with a quick thrill of
tenderness in his heart for this little scapegrace who seemed
to win from everyone an extra share of love; "no, I don't think
I should have named you Peace&mdash;that is, if I could have foreseen
what the blossom was to be when the bud unfolded. I should have
called you Joy."</p>

<p>"Joy?" repeated Peace. "Humph! That sounds like a heathen name.
We've got a story book about Hop Loy, a Chinaman who was born
on Christmas Day and never saw a Christmas tree until he was older'n
Cherry. Why-ee! Ain't that terrible! I used to think I'd like
to have my birthday come on Christmas, but now I'm glad it doesn't,
for then everybody'd make one present do for the two days, and
I'd get only half as many pretty things as other children have.
It's bad enough as 'tis, being born on New Year's Day, for by
that time most folks have spent all their money on Christmas doings."</p>

<p>"Oho," he mocked, "is that what is bothering you? Well, now,
don't you worry! You shall have your share of birthday gifts as
well as heaps of Christmas presents as long as you live with us.
This year Christmas will be doubly merry, for it is the first
holiday season we have had any young folks to help us celebrate
since the days when Dora's nephew used to spend his vacations
with us."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he come any more?" asked Cherry curiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, he is a gray-haired man now with children of his own," laughed
grandma, then sighed, for the rollicking Ned who had been the
life of so many vacations with them had married a society dame
whose one aim was to see how many social victories she could score,
and the poor children of the family fared as best they could in
the great, loveless palace which they called home.</p>

<p>"Do they live in Martindale?" asked Hope, eager to add to her
list of acquaintances any whom the Campbells loved.</p>

<p>"No, their home is in Chicago now. That is a photograph of the
children." She pointed to a group picture on the fireplace mantel,
and the girls clustered about it with inquisitive eyes.</p>

<p>"What a sad-faced child the smaller one is," observed Faith.
"How old is she?"</p>

<p>"Six or seven weeks younger than Peace, I believe. She was born
on Valentine Day."</p>

<p>"How lovely!" Peace cried joyfully. "But I'd like it better if
it was the boy who was almost my age. He looks the nicest of the
bunch. The big girl is homely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace!"</p>

<p>"Well, it ain't her fault, I know, and I wouldn't mind how homely
she was if she looked <em>sweet</em>, but she doesn't. She looks
'sif she thought she owned the earth and I never did like a <em>darnimeering</em>
person. Now Tom&mdash;his name is Tom, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No, dear, it is Henderson. Henderson Meadows."</p>

<p>"Oh! Why, I was sure it was Tom; he has such a Tom-ish look&mdash;"</p>

<p>A shout of derision interrupted her, but she stoutly declared,
"Well, he has! Boys named Tom are always nice&mdash;all I ever knew.
I'm sorry his name is Henderson. It doesn't sound a bit like him."</p>

<p>"You are a queer chick," said the President indulgently, "but
I quite agree with you in regard to Henderson. He is a splendid
fellow, however, in spite of his long name. They ought to have
called him Ned Junior. He is big Ned all over again, just as Belle
the second is the counterpart of her mother. Lorene is the odd
piece. Every family has one odd one, I believe. Lorene is like
neither her father nor mother."</p>

<p>"What funny names! They are as bad as ours. But I should like
to know the children&mdash;the folks, I mean. I s'pose Belle is too
old to be called a child any longer, ain't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Belle is sixteen and stylish," he answered grimly, as if
that told the story, and it really did, for little more could
be said of the frivolous, society-loving girl, brought up to follow
in the footsteps of her worldly mother.</p>

<p>"Do they come here often?" ventured Gail, still studying the
group, none of whom looked really happy.</p>

<p>"No, oh no," Mrs. Campbell answered hastily. "Martindale is too
quiet for Mrs. Meadows. Ned sent Henderson and Lorene up here
for a month last summer, but Belle has never been our guest. Grandpa
and I have visited them twice in Chicago, but that is all we have
ever seen them."</p>

<p>"I wish they lived nearer," sighed Peace. "We never had any cousins
of our own, but maybe they'd adopt us too, like you did; then
we'd know what it feels like to have real relations."</p>

<p>"Suppose you write Lorene. I think she would enjoy getting letters
from a little girl so near her own age."</p>

<p>"That <em>would</em> be nice, s'posing I liked to write letters,"
Peace assented, "but I don't. I'll send her a Christmas present,
though; and a valentine when it comes time, and a birthday gift,
too. She will like that, won't she? What street does she live
on in Chicago? It'll have to go pretty soon if it gets there in
time for Christmas. That's only a week off. Mercy! What a lot
of work we'll have to do before then, getting ready for the parties.
I do love parties! But I don't see what you wanted to make two
for. One would have been a plenty, and not near so much work."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell laughed comfortably. "The house isn't large enough
to accommodate all we want to invite, so we had to make two parties.
Besides, the evening party is a sort of 'coming out' affair for
my older girls&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Coming out of what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, introducing them into college society&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And we littler girls ain't worth coming out for? Is that it?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear no! But <em>little</em> girls don't come out into society.
They have to wait until they are grown up. Even Gail and Faith
are too young for the social whirl as the world understands that
phrase. They must wait until they are through with school and
college life before they take up social duties. But they have
met so very few of our young people since coming here to Martindale
to live that we are giving this party to introduce them to their
own classmates really. Do you understand now?"</p>

<p>Peace did not, but she vaguely felt that she ought to, so she
bobbed her head slowly and fell to puzzling over the queer ways
of the world. Fortunately for the whole household, the last week
of preparation for the holiday season was a very busy one, so
Peace had little time to think of all these perplexing questions;
and when Christmas Day dawned at length, everyone thought she
had forgotten her grievance over not being invited to attend the
evening party for the older sisters. But Peace remembered, and
in the gray of the early dawn before anyone else was awake in
the great house, the door of the flag room burst open with a jerk
and a joyous voice shrieked through the gloom:</p>

<p>"What have you got in your stockings, girls? Mine is stuffed
so full it fell off the nail, and one chair and half the dresser
is loaded with the left-over packages. And Allee's got as many
as I have. There's a doll for each of us&mdash;they beat yours all
hollow, Cherry. Now we've got a Goddess of Liberty all our own
and you can have yours as soon as ever you want it. And I've got
seven books. Guess Santa must have mixed me up with you again,
Cherry. There are three puzzles and five games and a lot of handkerchiefs
and ribbons, two sashes, and oh, the loveliest white dress for
winter wear, all trimmed with the softest velvet&mdash;just the thing
for your party tonight, Faith, s'posing I was invited. And there's
a plaid dress and a plain red one and a brown one and a dark blue&mdash;six
in all&mdash;and two coats. <em>Two!</em> Think of that! Mercy, ain't
we rich now? Are you awake, all of you? Are you listening? Ain't
this different from last year?"</p>

<p>Ah, how well they all remembered that last Christmas, and what
a hymn of praise and thanksgiving went up from each of those six
hearts for the joy and good tidings this Christmas had brought
them!</p>

<p>Before Peace had finished shouting her catalog of gifts, the
other sisters were awake&mdash;and indeed, the whole household was
astir&mdash;examining the generous remembrances loving hands had heaped
around their beds as they slept. And what a merry time they made
of it! Gussie could scarcely prevail upon anyone to touch her
tempting breakfast, for excitement had dulled the usually hearty
appetites; the young folks found their treasures more alluring
than any breakfast table could possibly be, and the President
and his wife hovered over them to enjoy the sight of their joy.</p>

<p>"A body'd think they had never seen a Christmas Day before,"
muttered Marie, waiting impatiently in her snowy cap and apron
to serve the rapidly cooling breakfast.</p>

<p>"It's many a long day since they have seen one like this," said
Gussie loyally, smiling gratefully as she thought of the liberal
number of packages old Santa had left hanging to her door during
the night. But at length the meal was ended, Marie had carried
the dishes away, Jud appeared with a step-ladder and hammer, and
the younger trio were banished upstairs to amuse themselves until
the last of the party decorations were put in place. This was
not a hard thing to do, fortunately, and for once not one of them
raised any objection to being exiled in this fashion.</p>

<p>"Why, I've enough things of my own to look at and think about
to last me a week," Cherry breathed ecstatically.</p>

<p>"Yes, and s'posing you did get tired of that," spoke up Peace,
"there's all the rest of the girls' bundles to 'xamine. They've
each got a hundred 'most near, I sh'd think."</p>

<p>So for a long time they fluttered from room to room, admiring
the pretty things that were now their own, nibbling chocolate
drops, or discussing the party scheduled for two o'clock that
afternoon. Then gradually conversation flagged; each girl sought
a favorite retreat, and surrounded by her pile of belongings,
sat down to gloat over them. Silence fell upon the rooms, broken
only by the sound of rustling ribbons caressed by admiring hands,
the opening and shutting of boxes, the fluttering of story-book
leaves, the protesting squeak of Queen Helen's bisque arms and
legs, and the rattle of mysterious puzzles.</p>

<p>Cherry had retired to her own domain to regale herself with certain
tempting volumes, and Peace and Allee were alone in the flag room
when the older girl suddenly dropped the book in which she had
been lost for a full half hour, and said eagerly, "Allee, this
is the most interesting story I ever read. It tells how the little
Swede children give the birds a Christmas. Think of that! The
birds! We tried to make it happy for everyone we knew &mdash;Jud
and Gussie and Marie and the flirty chimney-sweep who goes by
here every morning, and the washwoman who lives in the alley,
and the milk-boy who comes so far through the cold to bring us
our milk, and Caspar Dodds' family&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;all of them; and
we even remembered the canary and the dogs, but we never thought
of the birds outdoors."</p>

<p>"No, we didn't," Allee agreed, pausing in her occupation of undressing
the gorgeous Queen Helen to stare fixedly at her sister as if
trying to fathom her thoughts. "We might ask Gussie for some crumbs.
It ain't too late yet."</p>

<p>"Crumbs wouldn't do at all. The book says they tie a sheaf of
wheat to a tall pole in the yard so the birds will see it and
come down and eat. See, there is the picture."</p>

<p>"Um-hm. But we haven't any tall pole in our yard, 'cept the flag-pole
and that's on the roof."</p>

<p>"No, we haven't any pole like the book shows, but we could hitch
the wheat on our balcony-rail knobs and when the birds came down
to get it, we could watch them from this window. See?"</p>

<p>"Where'll you get the wheat?"</p>

<p>"From the barn. Jud's got a lot of different kinds of grain out
there."</p>

<p>"But we can't go downstairs until party time. Even lunch is to
be brought up here, grandma said."</p>

<p>"That's so. But I don't think they'd care if we just slipped
down the stairs and straight out of the front door. It wouldn't
take us but a minute to get the wheat and come right back again."</p>

<p>"Grandma said if we went downstairs before she gave us leave,
we couldn't go to the party at all."</p>

<p>"Then how can we feed those birds?"</p>

<p>"I guess we can't feed them this year&mdash;'nless we do it tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow won't be Christmas. We've got to do it today. Just
think how nice it will be to play we are little Swedes and how
pleased Gussie'll be to think we did something her people do."</p>

<p>"Why do just Swedes feed the birds?" inquired Allee, still a
trifle dubious about entering into Peace's plan, in view of the
risk involved.</p>

<p>"Oh, I s'pose they thought of it first. Every kind of people
do something queer at Christmas which they call a custom. The
Holland children put out their shoes on Christmas Eve for Santa
Claus to fill, instead of hanging up their stockings."</p>

<p>"Their shoes?" Allee's eyes were as round as saucers with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes. They wear big, wooden boats for shoes. I guess their feet
must be extra big&mdash;anyway, their shoes are simply <em>e-mense</em>
and will hold a lot. Then there's the French people,&mdash;<em>they</em>
always save up all the fusses and scraps they have had with other
folks during the year, and on Christmas Day they go around and
get forgiven. Wonder what Gail would think of that! And the Irish
folks stay up all night to hear the horses talk."</p>

<p>"Peace, you're fooling!"</p>

<p>"Allee Greenfield, do I ever fool you?"</p>

<p>"<em>N&mdash;</em>o, you never have."</p>

<p>"And I ain't beginning now. That is just what this book says."</p>

<p>"But horses don't talk!"</p>

<p>"Only at Christmas time."</p>

<p>"I don't b'lieve they do then. Did you ever hear them!"</p>

<p>"<em>N&mdash;</em>o, but I'm going to stay up tonight and listen."</p>

<p>"Oh, we can't. This is party night and what would grandma say?"</p>

<p>"We'll never know if they talk unless we do stay up and listen&mdash;and
I'd like to find out what they say. It's just at midnight. That
ain't long. We go to bed at eight, and midnight is only twelve
o'clock. We could stay awake easily till then, 'cause the people
who are invited will be leaving just about that time. I heard
grandma say so. We'll just skip away to the barn and see if Duke
and Charley are talking, and then we'll come back before anyone
knows we're gone."</p>

<p>The plan was truly very fascinating, but Allee still looked very
doubtful, and after a silent moment Peace broke out in an aggrieved
tone, "I don't see what is the matter with you, Allee. You are
getting to be just like Cherry. She always sets down on my plans.
You won't help me hang up the wheat for the Swedes or listen to
the Irish horses. You never used to be like that."</p>

<p>"I will too help you!" cried Allee, hurt at her boon companion's
words and tone. "I'll do anything you want me to, only I don't
see how we can carry out either one of those. We'll surely get
scolded if we go downstairs now, and it would be dreadful if we
couldn't go to either party."</p>

<p>Peace walked to the balcony window and threw up the sash, murmuring,
"If only grandpa hadn't made us promise not to slide down the
pillars! Oh, I've got it, Allee! Look here!"</p>

<p>Allee scrambled up from the floor and hurried to her side, shivering
in the cold blast that blew in through the open window, bearing
with it a few feathery flakes, for it was trying hard to snow.
"See that piece of the wall that sticks out there, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But how can you walk on that little mite of a piece?" gasped
Allee, growing pale at the very thought. "And how would you get
down to the ground?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's easy! The rain-pipe is fastened just high enough
for me to hang onto, and 'sides, the trellis goes part of the
way to the porch roof, and Jud hasn't taken down the ladder he
put up there yesterday."</p>

<p>"Yes, but s'posing you should fall," wailed Allee in sudden terror,
for the water-pipe looked like a very frail support even for a
child as small and light of foot as was Peace, and the corner
with the projecting porch roof seemed so far away.</p>

<p>"There's snow on the ground. I wouldn't get hurt. But you needn't
think I'm going to fall. I've clum lots harder places than that
before. You stay here and when I get back you can tack up the
wheat on the rail post."</p>

<p>Carefully she stepped out on the balcony, slipped over the low
railing and set out on her perilous journey along the narrow coping,
clinging tightly to the rain-trough with one hand, and hanging
onto the trellis supports with the other till at last she was
safe on the porch roof at the corner. With an exultant shout she
turned and waved her hand at rigid, white-lipped Allee in the
window, then slid lightly down the ladder and out of sight. She
was gone a long time, and the small watcher above was becoming
alarmed at her stay, fearing that the daring acrobat had been
caught at her pranks, and wondering what punishment would befall
her in such an event, when the bare, brown head appeared over
the low porch roof once more, and Peace inquired in a worried
tone, "Do you know whether birds eat hay? 'Cause I can't find
any whole wheat out there. It's all shocked."</p>

<p>"Why, I never watched them long enough to see," began Allee,
eyeing the great twisted wisp the older child had in her hand.</p>

<p>"Well, I brought some grain, too, but I don't know how we can
tie that to a pole, 'nless we leave it in the bag, and then how
can the birds get at it!"</p>

<p>"We might throw it along the rail&mdash;it's wide enough to hold quite
a little&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Course! What a <em>nijut</em> I am not to think of that myself!"</p>

<p>Slinging the bag of grain over one arm, and still clutching the
hay firmly in the other hand, she began her slow creeping along
the coping back to the balcony window. The rain-pipe shook threateningly
under her weight, and even the trellis supports swayed uncomfortably
when once she slipped and almost lost her frail footing. Allee
gave a low moan of horror and shut her eyes, but the daring climber
did not fall, and when next the watcher looked, she beheld the
curly, brown head bobbing over the balcony rail, as Peace swung
up to safety beside her, and dropped the burden&mdash;the birds' Christmas
dinner&mdash;into her trembling hands.</p>

<p>Nor was Allee the only one who trembled. On the snowy walk below,
approaching the house with rapid strides, came the dignified President,
hand in hand with two children, a bright-eyed, black-haired boy
of perhaps a dozen years, and an under-sized, gipsy-like little
girl, both chattering like magpies as they raced along beside
the tall, erect old man, when suddenly the girl screamed faintly,
"Oh, Uncle Donald, look!"</p>

<p>But he had caught sight of the apparition even before she spoke,
and halted abruptly, breathlessly, terror clutching at his heart.
The boy followed the gaze of his two petrified companions, and
ejaculated in amazed admiration, "Golly, but she's got grit! Why,
Uncle Donald, that's your house! That must be one of the girls
you were telling us about. Is it Peace?"</p>

<p>The President nodded his head mechanically, not knowing that
he had heard the question, but the next moment the frozen horror
of his face melted. The climber had reached the balcony and was
unconcernedly scattering a handful of grain over the narrow railing,
while Allee securely bound the wisp of hay to the balcony post.
A great sigh of relief escaped the watchers below, their hearts
began to beat once more and the red blood pounded through their
veins.</p>

<p>"Oh," gasped the girl, "I thought sure she'd fall!"</p>

<p>"I didn't," declared the boy with a wise shake of his head. "She's
a reg'lar cat. I believe she could climb a wall. She's like that
'human fly' the papers are always telling about. I'd like jolly
well to see <em>him</em> do some of his stunts, you better believe!"</p>

<p>The President said nothing, but his mouth set in grim lines and
a look of determination replaced the fearful pallor of his face.
Forgetful of the guests he had in tow, he marched into the house
and straight up the stairway with the children still at his heels.
At the door of the flag room he knocked, then without waiting
for a summons from within, he entered.</p>

<p>The two scatterers of Christmas cheer had finished their work
by this time and were now gleefully watching the feathered folk
of the air settling about the unexpected repast, so they scarcely
heard the steps in the hall or the creak of the opening door.
But at the peculiar sound of the voice speaking to them, both
girls wheeled quickly, and Peace asked in guilty haste, "Did you
want us, grandpa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, come here, both of you."</p>

<p>They went and stood at his knee, a secret fear tugging at each
little heart as they saw the unusually stern look he bent upon
them.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is&mdash;what&mdash;why&mdash;," stammered Peace, wishing he would smile
a little to relieve the keenness of his glance.</p>

<p>"What were you doing just now?"</p>

<p>"Feeding the birds like the Swedes do on Christmas Day, only
we didn't have a pole to hitch our wheat to, and all our wheat
was in kernels anyway, and we were told not to go downstairs until
Jud and the girls were through dec'rating, so we clum out of the
window and I got some hay and grain just as slick! Don't the birds
look as if they were enjoying their Christmas dinner?" Peace rattled
on, speaking so rapidly that the words fairly tumbled out of her
mouth.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you when you chose this room for your own that
you would forfeit it the first time you used the window for the
stairway?"</p>

<p>"No, grandpa," came the astounding reply from both eager little
girls. "You said <em>porch</em>, <em>pillars</em>, and we have
<em>never</em> used them for stairways since the time we told
you about. We 'membered that <em>carefully</em>, and this time
we used that wide piece that sticks out of the wall, and then
clum down Jud's ladder from the back porch roof. That ain't the
balcony pillars, grandpa. You never said we couldn't go down that
way."</p>

<p>In absolute amazement the learned Doctor of Laws gazed long and
silently into the anxious, upturned faces. Allee's lips began
to tremble, and even Peace, remembering the Doctor's words in
regard to lickings the night of the surprise party in the little
brown house, shook in her shoes; but she steadfastly returned
his gaze, and quietly repeated, "You know you didn't, grandpa!"</p>

<p>"No," he said at last. "I did not forbid your going down that
way, but it was only because I never dreamed you or anyone else
would ever try such a feat." Suddenly his sternness vanished,
he stooped quickly and gathered the scared little souls in his
arms, choking huskily, "My little girlies, if you knew what a
fright you have given your old grandpa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, grandpa," quavered Allee from her retreat on his shoulder,
"we'll never do it again, truly!"</p>

<p>"And you won't take this darling room away from us this time,
will you?" wheedled Peace, her equilibrium restored at sight of
this unusual display of emotion.</p>

<p>"No," he promised, "not this time. We'll try you again, but remember&mdash;no
more window climbing of <em>any</em> kind."</p>

<p>"Not even out onto the balcony?" wailed Peace in dismay.</p>

<p>There was a sound of suppressed laughter from the hall, and as
the girls in the flag room whirled about to discover the cause,
the President suddenly remembered his new guests and rose hurriedly
to his feet. But Peace had reached the door in a bound and with
a cry of delight dragged forth the embarrassed strangers, exclaiming,
"It's Henderson and Lorene, grandpa! They look 'xactly like their
picture, don't they, only not quite so grumpy? Grandma said I
better write Lorene and I did and I invited her to come up for
my party. That's how they happen to be here. Now we'll get acquainted
with our relations, won't we? I invited Belle, too. Why didn't
she come?"</p>

<p>"Belle and mamma went to Evanston last week," Lorene explained
bashfully.</p>

<p>"And they let you come all alone?"</p>

<p>"They don't know yet that we aren't in Chicago," chuckled Henderson.
"Dad let us come. It's only a twelve-hour ride and we don't change
cars at all. Pooh! We've gone longer ways than that alone."</p>

<p>"But not when mamma knew it," supplemented Lorene. "She'd have
<em>insisted</em> upon sending Nurse with us&mdash;if she had let us
come at all. Where shall we put our wraps? It's hot in here."</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot!" cried Peace, abruptly recalled to her duties
as hostess, for dazed Dr. Campbell had gone in search of his wife
the minute he saw that the children were sufficiently introduced.</p>

<p>"Hang your coat on the hall-tree, Henderson; and Lorene, bring
your things in here. It's pretty near lunch time already, and
then we must dress for the party."</p>

<p>So in spite of their very unexpected arrival, the two strangers
received a royal welcome, and were soon very much at home with
the six merry girls whom they promptly adopted as cousins, just
as Peace had hoped they would. And how quickly the hours flew
by! Before anyone realized it, the great clock in the hall struck
two, and promptly the small guests began to arrive. Happy voices
filled the house, happy faces beamed from every corner, happy
hearts beat high with Christmas cheer; the very air seemed charged
with happiness. The four younger sisters made charming hostesses,
Grandma Campbell proved to be a rare entertainer, and the dignified
President won everlasting fame as a story-teller and leader in
games.</p>

<p>"<em>Everything</em> was a success," as Hope thankfully declared
when the last guest had departed, and the happy group had congregated
in grandma's room to talk things over while Jud and his corps
of helpers were setting things to rights for the evening party.</p>

<p>"Yes," Peace reluctantly conceded, "but think how much nicer
it would have been if we could have had it in the evening like
grown-up folks."</p>

<p>"Still harping about that?" laughed Faith, pausing in the doorway
with her arms full of holly wreaths ready to be hung. "Daytime
is made for children. Gail and I didn't intrude at your party."</p>

<p>"That ain't 'cause you wasn't invited," Peace replied pointedly.</p>

<p>"But we couldn't very well come," Faith answered hastily. "There
were so many things we had to get ready for our tree tonight."</p>

<p>"Getting things ready for a tree ain't like having to lie in
bed and hear all the noise and music and know you can't have any
share at <em>all</em> in them," Peace persisted; but Faith had
already vanished down the stairway, and only a tantalizing laugh
floated back in reply.</p>

<p>A hush fell over the little company in the cosy room, each busy
with happy thoughts or rosy day-dreams, as she stared at the glowing
embers in the great fireplace or watched the white flakes drifting
down through the early twilight outside. Then there was a firm
step on the stair, a cheery voice from the hallway broke the spell,
and six pair of eyes were lifted to greet the busy President as
he briskly entered the room and paused to survey the pretty scene.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he said bluffly, "what's the difficulty? Quarrelling?"</p>

<p>"No, sir!" they shouted emphatically.</p>

<p>"We were just thinking&mdash;" Henderson began.</p>

<p>"How nice it would be if little folks were invited to grown-up
parties," finished Peace, who seemed possessed of only that one
idea.</p>

<p>"That's just what I have been thinking, too," was the surprising
confession from the tall man on the hearth rug.</p>

<p>"Wh-at!"</p>

<p>"Well, when mother and I came to think over the subject seriously,
we both agreed that it did not seem exactly fair to put three,
no, four such charming little maids to bed&mdash;for of course Lorene
would share your fate, too&mdash;when there were to be such festive
doings downstairs, although neither one of us believes in late
hours for children. I presume we are very old-fashioned in some
things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you aren't," chorused the loyal girls.</p>

<p>"No? True patriots! And yet didn't you think grandma and I were
just the least teenty bit hard on you to make you go to bed at
the regulation hours tonight when it is Christmas?"</p>

<p>"W-e-ll, we would like awfully much to stay up and see if Gail
and Faith do as good entertaining their comp'ny as we did," confessed
Peace with unusual hesitation.</p>

<p>"Supposing I should tell you that we have decided to let you
stay up an hour or two longer?"</p>

<p>"Oh, grandpa, what a darling you are!"</p>

<p>"No, you must thank Faith. She begged so hard that we have had
to give in to satisfy her."</p>

<p>"Faith?" Peace was so completely dumbfounded that they had to
laugh at her.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, Faith. She says you are so dreadfully anxious to
see what a grown-up Christmas party is like that she is afraid
you will die of curiosity if you can't have that wish fulfilled."</p>

<p>"Grandpa, you are just joking," Cherry reproved.</p>

<p>"I am thoroughly in earnest, I assure you. To be sure, Faith
used somewhat different words, but she sympathized so heartily
with you that we decided to let you enjoy part of the evening's
program. In fact, the only reason we planned <em>two</em> parties
in the first place was because the old house wouldn't hold at
one time all we wanted to invite; and we thought it would be a
great deal easier to entertain our guests if we had the big folks
at one party and the little people at another. Do you understand
now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'll bet you've been figuring on letting us go all
the while we were stewing about it," cried Peace, the irrepressible.</p>

<p>"Maybe you are right," he chuckled.</p>

<p>She bounced off the floor with a squeal of delight, clutched
Allee with one hand and Lorene with the other, and rushed out
of the room, calling back over her shoulder, "Now, I'm <em>surblimely</em>
happy! You better go dress, Cherry! Dinner will soon be ready
and there won't be much time after that before the party begins."</p>

<p>They had been happy before, but the granting of this one dear
wish transported them to such heights of bliss that they seemed
to be walking on clouds, and went about in such a state of rapture
that it was ludicrous as well as delightful to behold their antics.</p>

<p>Evening came, the guests arrived, music sounded, carols were
sung, and Peace, entranced, moved about through the gay, light-hearted
throng like one in a dream. To be sure, it was just as the President
had prophesied&mdash;little attention was paid to the children of the
party, but it was glorious fun just to watch the changing scenes
and be a part of them, instead of lying tucked away in bed upstairs
listening with ever-increasing curiosity and longing to the sounds
of merrymaking below.</p>

<p>With a happy sigh of content at the realization of her great
ambition, Peace dropped down upon a pile of cushions by one of
the long French windows, leaned her forehead against the cool
pane and looked out into the night, where by the flickering light
of the street-lamps she could see the white snowflakes drifting
slowly, lazily downward.</p>

<p>"My, but hasn't this been a happy Christmas!" she said aloud,
though no one was near enough to hear her words. "Who'd ever have
thought last Christmas that we'd be here tonight? Do you s'pose
the angels know we don't live in Parker any more? We might set
a lamp in the window so's they'd see it and be sure. Gail says
mother always did that when papa was out after night, so he could
find his way home all right. I'll tell Allee and when we go to
bed we'll just remind the angels that we don't need so much looking
after now that we're living here. I'll never forget how s'prised
Hec Abbott was when he found out that we'd all been 'dopted together.
I wonder what Hec is doing about now? He can't brag any more about
the good times they have at his house. We are just&mdash;what in the
world is that coming up the steps?"</p>

<p>Mechanically she rose to her feet, her nose still pressed flat
against the window-pane as she studied the huge, misshapen figure
already on the wide veranda. The footman who had ushered in the
guests of the evening was at that moment occupied in fastening
up a strand of evergreen which had fallen close above a gas-jet;
the President was at the furthest corner of the great parlor engaged
in an animated discussion with a pale-faced professor of Greek;
and Mrs. Campbell was nowhere in sight. With a wildly beating
heart, Peace seized the door-knob, and not waiting for the queer
stranger outside to ring the bell, she flung wide the door and
confronted him.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Santa Claus!" they heard her say, for the sudden sharp
blast of winter air had drawn a crowd to the door to see what
had happened. "Don't you know, sir, that you can't come in this
way? Go up to the roof and climb down the <em>chimbley</em>, like
you do at other houses," she commanded, and in the face of the
amazed Saint Nick she slammed the door.</p>

<p>"Peace, what have you done?" cried Gail aghast, as she caught
a glimpse of the fat, knobby pack disappearing down the steps.</p>

<p>"It was just that Santa Claus forgot to go down the <em>chimbley</em>,"
she explained. "He ought to have remembered that!"</p>

<p>A shout from the adjoining room cut short her defense, and as
the crowd surged forward in that direction, she beheld the jolly
old Saint shuffling across the floor dragging his heavy pack which
certainly looked as sooty and dirty as if he had really plunged
down the tall chimney and through the fireplace. Straight to her
corner he came, and fumbling in his sack, drew forth a tiny statue
of the Goddess of Liberty, which he presented with an elaborate
bow, saying in a deep, rumbling voice, "To the defender of all
childhood traditions &mdash;Liberty enlightening the world!" His
words were greeted with mad applause, for by this time everyone
had heard the story of the flag room and peeped at its quaint
furnishings; but the laugh was quickly turned from one to another,
for St. Nick had remembered well the pet foibles of each guest
present, and had brought with him appropriate gifts for all.</p>

<p>Much too soon the hands of the clock crept around to the hour
of half past ten, and with sighs of resignation and disappointment,
the four smaller girls, Cherry, Peace, Lorene and Allee, slipped
quietly away to bed.</p>

<p>"I did so want to hear the rest of the carols," murmured Cherry,
yawning so widely that she nearly swallowed the rest of the exiled
group.</p>

<p>"We can hear them after we're in bed," said Peace, rubbing her
eyes which were growing very heavy in spite of her efforts to
stay awake. "Gussie promised to leave our doors open until time
for the folks to go home. It's the charades I wanted to see."</p>

<p>"Charades?" questioned Lorene. "Were they going to have charades,
too?"</p>

<p>"She means tableaux," explained Cherry. "She's crazy about them.
They make me cough too much&mdash;the lights they use, I mean. Come
on, Lorene, sleep with me tonight until Hope comes up to bed.
Do, please! It isn't fair for you three to stick in here and leave
me all by myself in the other room."</p>

<p>Lorene glanced hesitatingly from one sister to the other, and
seeing no opposition, answered, "All right, Cherry, I'll stay
with you till the folks go. You don't care, do you, girls?"</p>

<p>"Not for that long," Peace magnanimously replied, for a daring
plan had just popped her eyes wide open, and Lorene might hinder
its fulfillment. So they separated, and in a few short moments
four white-robed figures were tucked snugly under the coverlets,
the lights turned out, and the two doors left ajar that the sleepy
exiles might hear the strains of music floating up the wide staircase.
There was the soft sound of whispered words from bed to bed like
the sleepy twitterings of birdlings in their nests, and then silence.
Cherry and Lorene were fast asleep. Downstairs the carols ceased,
the wail of violin and guitar died away, and the murmur of voices
was again borne to the straining ears of the conspirators in the
flag room.</p>

<p>"Do you s'pose they have begun tableauing?" asked Allee, after
what seemed an eternity of listening.</p>

<p>"Not yet; they have lights. There, that must be one. See how
queer the hall looks through the crack of the door? I guess it's
time now. Come on, but be awful still."</p>

<p>"It's cold after being in that warm bed," protested Allee as
her bare feet touched the polished floor in the hall.</p>

<p>"We'll get some wraps in here," Peace answered, inspired by a
happy thought to seize upon two beautiful white opera robes belonging
to some of the guests below, and with these heavy garments trailing
behind them, they stole softly down the wide stairway almost to
the landing, where, out of sight from the company massed in the
parlor and adjoining rooms, they could still see the tableaux
taking place in the reception hall below.</p>

<p>Fortunately for their health's sake, this part of the program
was brief, and had it not been for the very last scene pictured,
no one would have dreamed of their presence behind the palings.
But it happened that the girls had chosen as a climax for the
evening the tableau of the first Christmas Eve; and Hope, arrayed
as the angel of good tidings, appeared on the stairs just as Jud
touched off the weird red light on the landing,&mdash;for neither actor
nor servant had discovered the hidden culprits until too late
to utter any words of warning or reproof. Startled beyond measure
at the sudden glow almost at their elbow, the two conspirators
scrambled to their feet and vanished hastily up the stairway as
the chorus below took up the song,</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Angels ascending and descending,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanted the wond'rous refrain,<br/>
'Glory to God in the Highest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace and good will toward men.'"

</p>
</div>
<p>The long, fur-lined opera cloaks streamed out behind them like
misty clouds in the unearthly glow of the sulphur light, and it
seemed as if they were really a part of the beautiful tableau,
which brought forth such thunderous applause from the delighted
audience that it had to be repeated. This Peace and Allee did
not know, however, for with chattering teeth and trembling limbs,
they had fled to the refuge of their room, pausing only long enough
to drop their borrowed finery where they had found it; and they
were crawling underneath the covers once more when Peace hissed
sharply in her sister's ear, "What about the horses?"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with them?" murmured Allee, too confused and
sleepy to know what her companion was saying.</p>

<p>"We were going out to hear them talk at midnight."</p>

<p>"So we were! Well, I guess they'll have to talk all to themselves
again tonight."</p>

<p>"What? Ain't you going out with me to listen?"</p>

<p>"We'd freeze in our nightgowns and we dahsent take those pussy-cat
coats to the barn," protested the younger sister, aroused by Peace's
surprised exclamation.</p>

<p>"We'll dress."</p>

<p>"Oh, Peace, and then have the fun of taking our clothes off again?"</p>

<p>"We'll put on our stockings and overshoes and bundle up in grandma's
shawls. How'll that do? But first, we better light that candle
I told you about to let the angels know where we are tonight.
There &mdash;I guess they'll see it, even if it isn't as big as
a lamp. Come on, I heard the clock strike a long time ago."</p>

<p>If Allee had not been so sleepy she might have remembered one
other time just a year before when Peace had heard the clock strike;
but being too near the land of Nod to realize anything but that
Peace was calling her, she stumbled out of bed once more and allowed
herself to be bundled up in wraps of all sorts until she was as
shapeless as a mummy. In this fashion they slipped down the back
stairs and out to the barn without betraying their presence, though
the steps creaked under their weight, and every door they opened
squeaked so alarmingly that Peace held her breath more than once
for fear someone had heard.</p>

<p>Once inside the dark barn, they had to feel their way about,
for not a ray of light penetrated the blackness of the stormy
night, and the grim silence of the place filled them with nameless
terror. It was not so bad when they had finally found their way
into Marmaduke's stall and cuddled close to the friendly beast,
who nosed them inquiringly, but even there they did not dare speak
above a whisper; and so they waited breathlessly for the mystic
midnight hour when the animals should break their silence and
talk, each secretly wishing she were safely back in bed again.</p>

<p>Up at the house the merry evening had at length drawn to a close,
and the guests had reluctantly departed. The President, returning
from the gate where he had escorted the last guest to her sleigh,
made a harrowing discovery. There was a light in the balcony window!
Could it be that burglars had entered the house during the merrymaking
and were even now ransacking the rooms? He looked again. It was
such a tiny, steady light. Was it possible that one of the children
was sick and Gussie had not told him? The last thought sent him
flying up the stairs three steps at a time, and he reached the
flag room door so breathless that he could scarcely turn the knob.
The bed was empty. Only a wee taper from the Christmas tree burned
faintly on the window sill.</p>

<p>In frantic haste he called the family and they searched the house
from garret to cellar, but the missing children were not to be
found.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose the tableau scared them to death?" asked Hope.</p>

<p>"Maybe they tried to see if Santa Claus really came down the
chimney and got stuck there themselves," suggested Henderson,
who regarded the disappearance of the duet as something of a lark.</p>

<p>"Wake Jud," commanded Mrs. Campbell, and the worried Doctor hastily
lighted a lantern and went down to the barn to rouse the man of
all work, wondering as he did so what good that would do. The
horses whinnied as he entered the stable, and in the dim light
that flooded the place, the President saw that the door of Marmaduke's
stall stood open.</p>

<p>"What can Jud be thinking of?" he muttered somewhat testily,
stepping along to slip the bolt in its place, but the next instant
his eyes fell upon two dark bundles huddled at the horse's feet,
and with a startled exclamation he bent over to examine his find,
just as Faith burst in through the door behind him, crying, "They
must have left the house, grandpa, because the back hall door
is unlocked and the storm-door is swinging."</p>

<p>"Yes, Faith, and here they are," he answered, tenderly lifting
the smaller warm bundle and depositing it in the girl's arms.
"What in creation do you suppose they were doing here?"</p>

<p>As if in answer to his question, the brown eyes of the child
he was just lifting fluttered slowly open, and Peace drowsily
drawled, "We fed the Swede birds for Gussie, and got French forgiveness
from grandpa for doing so, and had a German Christmas tree, and
lots of Hung'ry company, and 'Merican stockings and a 'Merican
Santa Claus, but we didn't hear the Irish horses talk, and I b'lieve
it's all a joke."</p>

<p>In spite of their anxiety, Faith and the President gave a boisterous
shout, and Peace heard as in a dream her sister's voice saying,
"It is Christmas Eve that the animals are supposed to talk. Poor
Peace!"</p>
