<p>"A very singular prohibition," remarked Mrs. Fyne after a short
silence. "He seemed to love the child."</p>

<p>She was puzzled.  But I surmised that it might have been the
sullenness of a man unconscious of guilt and standing at bay to
fight his "persecutors," as he called them; or else the fear of
a softer emotion weakening his defiant attitude; perhaps, even,
it was a self-denying ordinance, in order to spare the girl the
sight of her father in the dock, accused of cheating, sentenced
as a swindler&mdash;proving the possession of a certain moral delicacy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fyne didn't know what to think.  She supposed it might have
been mere callousness.  But the people amongst whom the girl had
fallen had positively not a grain of moral delicacy.  Of that
she was certain.  Mrs. Fyne could not undertake to give me an
idea of their abominable vulgarity.  Flora used to tell her something
of her life in that household, over there, down Limehouse way. 
It was incredible.  It passed Mrs. Fyne's comprehension.  It was
a sort of moral savagery which she could not have thought possible.</p>

<p>I, on the contrary, thought it very possible.  I could imagine
easily how the poor girl must have been bewildered and hurt at
her reception in that household&mdash;envied for her past while delivered
defenceless to the tender mercies of people without any fineness
either of feeling or mind, unable to understand her misery, grossly
curious, mistaking her manner for disdain, her silent shrinking
for pride.  The wife of the "odious person" was witless and fatuously
conceited.  Of the two girls of the house one was pious and the
other a romp; both were coarse-minded&mdash;if they may be credited
with any mind at all.  The rather numerous men of the family were
dense and grumpy, or dense and jocose.  None in that grubbing
lot had enough humanity to leave her alone.  At first she was
made much of, in an offensively patronising manner.  The connection
with the great de Barral gratified their vanity even in the moment
of the smash.  They dragged her to their place of worship, whatever
it might have been, where the congregation stared at her, and
they gave parties to other beings like themselves at which they
exhibited her with ignoble self-satisfaction.  She did not know
how to defend herself from their importunities, insolence and
exigencies.  She lived amongst them, a passive victim, quivering
in every nerve, as if she were flayed.  After the trial her position
became still worse.  On the least occasion and even on no occasions
at all she was scolded, or else taunted with her dependence. 
The pious girl lectured her on her defects, the romping girl teased
her with contemptuous references to her accomplishments, and was
always trying to pick insensate quarrels with her about some "fellow"
or other.  The mother backed up her girls invariably, adding her
own silly, wounding remarks.  I must say they were probably not
aware of the ugliness of their conduct.  They were nasty amongst
themselves as a matter of course; their disputes were nauseating
in origin, in manner, in the spirit of mean selfishness.  These
women, too, seemed to enjoy greatly any sort of row and were always
ready to combine together to make awful scenes to the luckless
girl on incredibly flimsy pretences.  Thus Flora on one occasion
had been reduced to rage and despair, had her most secret feelings
lacerated, had obtained a view of the utmost baseness to which
common human nature can descend &mdash;I won't say <em>a propos
de bottes</em> as the French would excellently put it, but literally
<em>a propos</em> of some mislaid cheap lace trimmings for a nightgown
the romping one was making for herself.  Yes, that was the origin
of one of the grossest scenes which, in their repetition, must
have had a deplorable effect on the unformed character of the
most pitiful of de Barral's victims.  I have it from Mrs. Fyne. 
The girl turned up at the Fynes' house at half-past nine on a
cold, drizzly evening.  She had walked bareheaded, I believe,
just as she ran out of the house, from somewhere in Poplar to
the neighbourhood of Sloane Square&mdash;without stopping, without
drawing breath, if only for a sob.</p>

<p>"We were having some people to dinner," said the anxious sister
of Captain Anthony.</p>

<p>She had heard the front door bell and wondered what it might
mean.  The parlourmaid managed to whisper to her without attracting
attention.  The servants had been frightened by the invasion of
that wild girl in a muddy skirt and with wisps of damp hair sticking
to her pale cheeks.  But they had seen her before.  This was not
the first occasion, nor yet the last.</p>

<p>Directly she could slip away from her guests Mrs. Fyne ran upstairs.</p>

<p>"I found her in the night nursery crouching on the floor, her
head resting on the cot of the youngest of my girls.  The eldest
was sitting up in bed looking at her across the room."</p>

<p>Only a nightlight was burning there.  Mrs. Fyne raised her up,
took her over to Mr. Fyne's little dressing-room on the other
side of the landing, to a fire by which she could dry herself,
and left her there.  She had to go back to her guests.</p>

<p>A most disagreeable surprise it must have been to the Fynes. 
Afterwards they both went up and interviewed the girl.  She jumped
up at their entrance.  She had shaken her damp hair loose; her
eyes were dry&mdash;with the heat of rage.</p>

<p>I can imagine little Fyne solemnly sympathetic, solemnly listening,
solemnly retreating to the marital bedroom.  Mrs. Fyne pacified
the girl, and, fortunately, there was a bed which could be made
up for her in the dressing-room.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;what could one do after all!" concluded Mrs. Fyne.</p>

<p>And this stereotyped exclamation, expressing the difficulty of
the problem and the readiness (at any rate) of good intentions,
made me, as usual, feel more kindly towards her.</p>

<p>Next morning, very early, long before Fyne had to start for his
office, the "odious personage" turned up, not exactly unexpected
perhaps, but startling all the same, if only by the promptness
of his action.  From what Flora herself related to Mrs. Fyne,
it seems that without being very perceptibly less "odious" than
his family he had in a rather mysterious fashion interposed his
authority for the protection of the girl.  "Not that he cares,"
explained Flora.  "I am sure he does not.  I could not stand being
liked by any of these people.  If I thought he liked me I would
drown myself rather than go back with him."</p>

<p>For of course he had come to take "Florrie" home.  The scene
was the dining-room&mdash;breakfast interrupted, dishes growing cold,
little Fyne's toast growing leathery, Fyne out of his chair with
his back to the fire, the newspaper on the carpet, servants shut
out, Mrs. Fyne rigid in her place with the girl sitting beside
her&mdash;the "odious person," who had bustled in with hardly a greeting,
looking from Fyne to Mrs. Fyne as though he were inwardly amused
at something he knew of them; and then beginning ironically his
discourse.  He did not apologize for disturbing Fyne and his "good
lady" at breakfast, because he knew they did not want (with a
nod at the girl) to have more of her than could be helped.  He
came the first possible moment because he had his business to
attend to. He wasn't drawing a tip-top salary (this staring at
Fyne) in a luxuriously furnished office.  Not he.  He had risen
to be an employer of labour and was bound to give a good example.</p>

<p>I believe the fellow was aware of, and enjoyed quietly, the consternation
his presence brought to the bosom of Mr. and Mrs. Fyne.  He turned
briskly to the girl.  Mrs. Fyne confessed to me that they had
remained all three silent and inanimate.  He turned to the girl:
"What's this game, Florrie?  You had better give it up.  If you
expect me to run all over London looking for you every time you
happen to have a tiff with your auntie and cousins you are mistaken. 
I can't afford it."</p>

<p>Tiff&mdash;was the sort of definition to take one's breath away, having
regard to the fact that both the word convict and the word pauper
had been used a moment before Flora de Barral ran away from the
quarrel about the lace trimmings.  Yes, these very words!  So
at least the girl had told Mrs. Fyne the evening before.  The
word tiff in connection with her tale had a peculiar savour, a
paralysing effect.  Nobody made a sound.  The relative of de Barral
proceeded uninterrupted to a display of magnanimity.  "Auntie
told me to tell you she's sorry&mdash;there!  And Amelia (the romping
sister) shan't worry you again.  I'll see to that.  You ought
to be satisfied. Remember your position."</p>

<p>Emboldened by the utter stillness pervading the room he addressed
himself to Mrs. Fyne with stolid effrontery:</p>

<p>"What I say is that people should be good-natured.  She can't
stand being chaffed.  She puts on her grand airs.  She won't take
a bit of a joke from people as good as herself anyway.  We are
a plain lot.  We don't like it.  And that's how trouble begins."</p>

<p>Insensible to the stony stare of three pairs of eyes, which,
if the stories of our childhood as to the power of the human eye
are true, ought to have been enough to daunt a tiger, that unabashed
manufacturer from the East End fastened his fangs, figuratively
speaking, into the poor girl and prepared to drag her away for
a prey to his cubs of both sexes. "Auntie has thought of sending
you your hat and coat.  I've got them outside in the cab."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fyne looked mechanically out of the window.  A four-wheeler
stood before the gate under the weeping sky.  The driver in his
conical cape and tarpaulin hat, streamed with water.  The drooping
horse looked as though it had been fished out, half unconscious,
from a pond.  Mrs. Fyne found some relief in looking at that miserable
sight, away from the room in which the voice of the amiable visitor
resounded with a vulgar intonation exhorting the strayed sheep
to return to the delightful fold. "Come, Florrie, make a move. 
I can't wait on you all day here."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fyne heard all this without turning her head away from the
window. Fyne on the hearthrug had to listen and to look on too. 
I shall not try to form a surmise as to the real nature of the
suspense.  Their very goodness must have made it very anxious. 
The girl's hands were lying in her lap; her head was lowered as
if in deep thought; and the other went on delivering a sort of
homily.  Ingratitude was condemned in it, the sinfulness of pride
was pointed out&mdash;together with the proverbial fact that it "goes
before a fall."  There were also some sound remarks as to the
danger of nonsensical notions and the disadvantages of a quick
temper.  It sets one's best friends against one.  "And if anybody
ever wanted friends in the world it's you, my girl."  Even respect
for parental authority was invoked.  "In the first hour of his
trouble your father wrote to me to take care of you&mdash;don't forget
it.  Yes, to me, just a plain man, rather than to any of his fine
West-End friends.  You can't get over that.  And a father's a
father no matter what a mess he's got himself into.  You ain't
going to throw over your own father&mdash;are you?"</p>

<p>It was difficult to say whether he was more absurd than cruel
or more cruel than absurd.  Mrs. Fyne, with the fine ear of a
woman, seemed to detect a jeering intention in his meanly unctuous
tone, something more vile than mere cruelty.  She glanced quickly
over her shoulder and saw the girl raise her two hands to her
head, then let them fall again on her lap.  Fyne in front of the
fire was like the victim of an unholy spell&mdash;bereft of motion
and speech but obviously in pain.  It was a short pause of perfect
silence, and then that "odious creature" (he must have been really
a remarkable individual in his way) struck out into sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Well? . . . "  Again a silence.  "If you have fixed it up with
the lady and gentleman present here for your board and lodging
you had better say so.  I don't want to interfere in a bargain
I know nothing of.  But I wonder how your father will take it
when he comes out . . . or don't you expect him ever to come out?"</p>

<p>At that moment, Mrs. Fyne told me she met the girl's eyes.  There
was that in them which made her shut her own.  She also felt as
though she would have liked to put her fingers in her ears.  She
restrained herself, however; and the "plain man" passed in his
appalling versatility from sarcasm to veiled menace.</p>

<p>"You have&mdash;eh?  Well and good.  But before I go home let me ask
you, my girl, to think if by any chance you throwing us over like
this won't be rather bad for your father later on?  Just think
it over."</p>

<p>He looked at his victim with an air of cunning mystery.  She
jumped up so suddenly that he started back.  Mrs. Fyne rose too,
and even the spell was removed from her husband.  But the girl
dropped again into the chair and turned her head to look at Mrs.
Fyne.  This time it was no accidental meeting of fugitive glances. 
It was a deliberate communication.  To my question as to its nature
Mrs. Fyne said she did not know.  "Was it appealing?" I suggested. 
"No," she said.  "Was it frightened, angry, crushed, resigned?" 
"No!  No!  Nothing of these."  But it had frightened her.  She
remembered it to this day.  She had been ever since fancying she
could detect the lingering reflection of that look in all the
girl's glances.  In the attentive, in the casual&mdash;even in the
grateful glances&mdash;in the expression of the softest moods.</p>

<p>"Has she her soft moods, then?" I asked with interest.</p>

<p>Mrs Fyne, much moved by her recollections, heeded not my inquiry. 
All her mental energy was concentrated on the nature of that memorable
glance.  The general tradition of mankind teaches us that glances
occupy a considerable place in the self-expression of women. 
Mrs. Fyne was trying honestly to give me some idea, as much perhaps
to satisfy her own uneasiness as my curiosity.  She was frowning
in the effort as you see sometimes a child do (what is delightful
in women is that they so often resemble intelligent children &mdash;I
mean the crustiest, the sourest, the most battered of them do&mdash;at
times).  She was frowning, I say, and I was beginning to smile
faintly at her when all at once she came out with something totally
unexpected.</p>

<p>"It was horribly merry," she said.</p>

<p>I suppose she must have been satisfied by my sudden gravity because
she looked at me in a friendly manner.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Fyne," I said, smiling no longer.  "I see.  It would
have been horrible even on the stage."</p>

<p>"Ah!" she interrupted me&mdash;and I really believe her change of
attitude back to folded arms was meant to check a shudder.  "But
it wasn't on the stage, and it was not with her lips that she
laughed."</p>

<p>"Yes.  It must have been horrible," I assented.  "And then she
had to go away ultimately &mdash;I suppose.  You didn't say anything?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Fyne.  "I rang the bell and told one of the maids
to go and bring the hat and coat out of the cab.  And then we
waited."</p>

<p>I don't think that there ever was such waiting unless possibly
in a jail at some moment or other on the morning of an execution. 
The servant appeared with the hat and coat, and then, still as
on the morning of an execution, when the condemned, I believe,
is offered a breakfast, Mrs. Fyne, anxious that the white-faced
girl should swallow something warm (if she could) before leaving
her house for an interminable drive through raw cold air in a
damp four-wheeler &mdash;Mrs. Fyne broke the awful silence: "You
really must try to eat something," in her best resolute manner. 
She turned to the "odious person" with the same determination. 
"Perhaps you will sit down and have a cup of coffee, too."</p>

<p>The worthy "employer of labour" sat down.  He might have been
awed by Mrs. Fyne's peremptory manner&mdash;for she did not think of
conciliating him then.  He sat down, provisionally, like a man
who finds himself much against his will in doubtful company. 
He accepted ungraciously the cup handed to him by Mrs. Fyne, took
an unwilling sip or two and put it down as if there were some
moral contamination in the coffee of these "swells."  Between
whiles he directed mysteriously inexpressive glances at little
Fyne, who, I gather, had no breakfast that morning at all. Neither
had the girl.  She never moved her hands from her lap till her
appointed guardian got up, leaving his cup half full.</p>

<p>"Well.  If you don't mean to take advantage of this lady's kind
offer I may just as well take you home at once.  I want to begin
my day &mdash;I do."</p>

<p>After a few more dumb, leaden-footed minutes while Flora was
putting on her hat and jacket, the Fynes without moving, without
saying anything, saw these two leave the room.</p>

<p>"She never looked back at us," said Mrs. Fyne.  "She just followed
him out.  I've never had such a crushing impression of the miserable
dependence of girls&mdash;of women.  This was an extreme case.  But
a young man&mdash;any man&mdash;could have gone to break stones on the roads
or something of that kind&mdash;or enlisted&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was very true.  Women can't go forth on the high roads and
by-ways to pick up a living even when dignity, independence, or
existence itself are at stake.  But what made me interrupt Mrs.
Fyne's tirade was my profound surprise at the fact of that respectable
citizen being so willing to keep in his home the poor girl for
whom it seemed there was no place in the world.  And not only
willing but anxious.  I couldn't credit him with generous impulses. 
For it seemed obvious to me from what I had learned that, to put
it mildly, he was not an impulsive person.</p>

<p>"I confess that I can't understand his motive," I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"This is exactly what John wondered at, at first," said Mrs.
Fyne.  By that time an intimacy&mdash;if not exactly confidence&mdash;had
sprung up between us which permitted her in this discussion to
refer to her husband as John.  "You know he had not opened his
lips all that time," she pursued. "I don't blame his restraint. 
On the contrary.  What could he have said? I could see he was
observing the man very thoughtfully."</p>

<p>"And so, Mr. Fyne listened, observed and meditated," I said. 
"That's an excellent way of coming to a conclusion.  And may I
ask at what conclusion he had managed to arrive?  On what ground
did he cease to wonder at the inexplicable?  For I can't admit
humanity to be the explanation.  It would be too monstrous."</p>

<p>It was nothing of the sort, Mrs. Fyne assured me with some resentment,
as though I had aspersed little Fyne's sanity.  Fyne very sensibly
had set himself the mental task of discovering the self-interest. 
I should not have thought him capable of so much cynicism.  He
said to himself that for people of that sort (religious fears
or the vanity of righteousness put aside) money&mdash;not great wealth,
but money, just a little money&mdash;is the measure of virtue, of expediency,
of wisdom&mdash;of pretty well everything.  But the girl was absolutely
destitute.  The father was in prison after the most terribly complete
and disgraceful smash of modern times.  And then it dawned upon
Fyne that this was just it.  The great smash, in the great dust
of vanishing millions!  Was it possible that they all had vanished
to the last penny?  Wasn't there, somewhere, something palpable;
some fragment of the fabric left?</p>

<p>"That's it," had exclaimed Fyne, startling his wife by this explosive
unseating of his lips less than half an hour after the departure
of de Barral's cousin with de Barral's daughter.  It was still
in the diningroom, very near the time for him to go forth affronting
the elements in order to put in another day's work in his country's
service.  All he could say at the moment in elucidation of this
breakdown from his usual placid solemnity was:</p>

<p>"The fellow imagines that de Barral has got some plunder put
away somewhere."</p>

<p>This being the theory arrived at by Fyne, his comment on it was
that a good many bankrupts had been known to have taken such a
precaution.  It was possible in de Barral's case.  Fyne went so
far in his display of cynical pessimism as to say that it was
extremely probable.</p>

<p>He explained at length to Mrs. Fyne that de Barral certainly
did not take anyone into his confidence.  But the beastly relative
had made up his low mind that it was so.  He was selfish and pitiless
in his stupidity, but he had clearly conceived the notion of making
a claim on de Barral when de Barral came out of prison on the
strength of having "looked after" (as he would have himself expressed
it) his daughter.  He nursed his hopes, such as they were, in
secret, and it is to be supposed kept them even from his wife.</p>

<p>I could see it very well.  That belief accounted for his mysterious
air while he interfered in favour of the girl.  He was the only
protector she had.  It was as though Flora had been fated to be
always surrounded by treachery and lies stifling every better
impulse, every instinctive aspiration of her soul to trust and
to love.  It would have been enough to drive a fine nature into
the madness of universal suspicion&mdash;into any sort of madness. 
I don't know how far a sense of humour will stand by one.  To
the foot of the gallows, perhaps.  But from my recollection of
Flora de Barral I feared that she hadn't much sense of humour. 
She had cried at the desertion of the absurd Fyne dog.  That animal
was certainly free from duplicity.  He was frank and simple and
ridiculous.  The indignation of the girl at his unhypocritical
behaviour had been funny but not humorous.</p>

<p>As you may imagine I was not very anxious to resume the discussion
on the justice, expediency, effectiveness or what not, of Fyne's
journey to London.  It isn't that I was unfaithful to little Fyne
out in the porch with the dog.  (They kept amazingly quiet there. 
Could they have gone to sleep?)  What I felt was that either my
sagacity or my conscience would come out damaged from that campaign. 
And no man will willingly put himself in the way of moral damage. 
I did not want a war with Mrs. Fyne. I much preferred to hear
something more of the girl.  I said:</p>

<p>"And so she went away with that respectable ruffian."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fyne moved her shoulders slightly&mdash;"What else could she
have done?" I agreed with her by another hopeless gesture.  It
isn't so easy for a girl like Flora de Barral to become a factory
hand, a pathetic seamstress or even a barmaid.  She wouldn't have
known how to begin.  She was the captive of the meanest conceivable
fate.  And she wasn't mean enough for it.  It is to be remarked
that a good many people are born curiously unfitted for the fate
awaiting them on this earth.  As I don't want you to think that
I am unduly partial to the girl we shall say that she failed decidedly
to endear herself to that simple, virtuous and, I believe, teetotal
household.  It's my conviction that an angel would have failed
likewise.  It's no use going into details; suffice it to state
that before the year was out she was again at the Fynes' door.</p>

<p>This time she was escorted by a stout youth.  His large pale
face wore a smile of inane cunning soured by annoyance.  His clothes
were new and the indescribable smartness of their cut, a <em>genre</em>
which had never been obtruded on her notice before, astonished
Mrs. Fyne, who came out into the hall with her hat on; for she
was about to go out to hear a new pianist (a girl) in a friend's
house.  The youth addressing Mrs. Fyne easily begged her not to
let "that silly thing go back to us any more." There had been,
he said, nothing but "ructions" at home about her for the last
three weeks.  Everybody in the family was heartily sick of quarrelling. 
His governor had charged him to bring her to this address and
say that the lady and gentleman were quite welcome to all there
was in it.  She hadn't enough sense to appreciate a plain, honest
English home and she was better out of it.</p>

<p>The young, pimply-faced fellow was vexed by this job his governor
had sprung on him.  It was the cause of his missing an appointment
for that afternoon with a certain young lady.  The lady he was
engaged to.  But he meant to dash back and try for a sight of
her that evening yet "if he were to burst over it."  "Good-bye,
Florrie.  Good luck to you&mdash;and I hope I'll never see your face
again."</p>

<p>With that he ran out in lover-like haste leaving the hall-door
wide open. Mrs. Fyne had not found a word to say.  She had been
too much taken aback even to gasp freely.  But she had the presence
of mind to grab the girl's arm just as she, too, was running out
into the street&mdash;with the haste, I suppose, of despair and to
keep I don't know what tragic tryst.</p>

<p>"You stopped her with your own hand, Mrs. Fyne," I said.  "I
presume she meant to get away.  That girl is no comedian&mdash;if I
am any judge."</p>

<p>"Yes!  I had to use some force to drag her in."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fyne had no difficulty in stating the truth.  "You see I
was in the very act of letting myself out when these two appeared. 
So that, when that unpleasant young man ran off, I found myself
alone with Flora.  It was all I could do to hold her in the hall
while I called to the servants to come and shut the door."</p>

<p>As is my habit, or my weakness, or my gift, I don't know which,
I visualized the story for myself.  I really can't help it.  And
the vision of Mrs. Fyne dressed for a rather special afternoon
function, engaged in wrestling with a wild-eyed, white-faced girl
had a certain dramatic fascination.</p>

<p>"Really!" I murmured.</p>

<p>"Oh!  There's no doubt that she struggled," said Mrs. Fyne. 
She compressed her lips for a moment and then added: "As to her
being a comedian that's another question."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fyne had returned to her attitude of folded arms.  I saw
before me the daughter of the refined poet accepting life whole
with its unavoidable conditions of which one of the first is the
instinct of selfpreservation and the egoism of every living creature. 
"The fact remains nevertheless that you&mdash;yourself&mdash;have, in your
own words, pulled her in," I insisted in a jocular tone, with
a serious intention.</p>

<p>"What was one to do," exclaimed Mrs. Fyne with almost comic exasperation.
"Are you reproaching me with being too impulsive?"</p>

<p>And she went on telling me that she was not that in the least. 
One of the recommendations she always insisted on (to the girl-friends,
I imagine) was to be on guard against impulse.  Always!  But I
had not been there to see the face of Flora at the time.  If I
had it would be haunting me to this day.  Nobody unless made of
iron would have allowed a human being with a face like that to
rush out alone into the streets.</p>

<p>"And doesn't it haunt you, Mrs. Fyne?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, not now," she said implacably.  "Perhaps if I had let her
go it might have done . . . Don't conclude, though, that I think
she was playing a comedy then, because after struggling at first
she ended by remaining.  She gave up very suddenly.  She collapsed
in our arms, mine and the maid's who came running up in response
to my calls, and . . . "</p>

<p>"And the door was then shut," I completed the phrase in my own
way.</p>

<p>"Yes, the door was shut," Mrs. Fyne lowered and raised her head
slowly.</p>

<p>I did not ask her for details.  Of one thing I am certain, and
that is that Mrs. Fyne did not go out to the musical function
that afternoon.  She was no doubt considerably annoyed at missing
the privilege of hearing privately an interesting young pianist
(a girl) who, since, had become one of the recognized performers. 
Mrs. Fyne did not dare leave her house.  As to the feelings of
little Fyne when he came home from the office, via his club, just
half an hour before dinner, I have no information.  But I venture
to affirm that in the main they were kindly, though it is quite
possible that in the first moment of surprise he had to keep down
a swear-word or two.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>The long and the short of it all is that next day the Fynes made
up their minds to take into their confidence a certain wealthy
old lady.  With certain old ladies the passing years bring back
a sort of mellowed youthfulness of feeling, an optimistic outlook,
liking for novelty, readiness for experiment.  The old lady was
very much interested: "Do let me see the poor thing!"  She was
accordingly allowed to see Flora de Barral in Mrs. Fyne's drawing-room
on a day when there was no one else there, and she preached to
her with charming, sympathetic authority: "The only way to deal
with our troubles, my dear child, is to forget them.  You must
forget yours.  It's very simple.  Look at me.  I always forget
mine. At your age one ought to be cheerful."</p>

<p>Later on when left alone with Mrs. Fyne she said to that lady:
"I do hope the child will manage to be cheerful.  I can't have
sad faces near me.  At my age one needs cheerful companions."</p>

<p>And in this hope she carried off Flora de Barral to Bournemouth
for the winter months in the quality of reader and companion. 
She had said to her with kindly jocularity: "We shall have a good
time together.  I am not a grumpy old woman."  But on their return
to London she sought Mrs. Fyne at once.  She had discovered that
Flora was not naturally cheerful. When she made efforts to be
it was still worse.  The old lady couldn't stand the strain of
that.  And then, to have the whole thing out, she could not bear
to have for a companion anyone who did not love her.  She was
certain that Flora did not love her.  Why?  She couldn't say.
Moreover, she had caught the girl looking at her in a peculiar
way at times.  Oh no!&mdash;it was not an evil look&mdash;it was an unusual
expression which one could not understand.  And when one remembered
that her father was in prison shut up together with a lot of criminals
and so on&mdash;it made one uncomfortable.  If the child had only tried
to forget her troubles! But she obviously was incapable or unwilling
to do so.  And that was somewhat perverse&mdash;wasn't it?  Upon the
whole, she thought it would be better perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs. Fyne assented hurriedly to the unspoken conclusion: "Oh
certainly! Certainly," wondering to herself what was to be done
with Flora next; but she was not very much surprised at the change
in the old lady's view of Flora de Barral.  She almost understood
it.</p>

<p>What came next was a German family, the continental acquaintances
of the wife of one of Fyne's colleagues in the Home Office.  Flora
of the enigmatical glances was dispatched to them without much
reflection.  As it was not considered absolutely necessary to
take them into full confidence, they neither expected the girl
to be specially cheerful nor were they discomposed unduly by the
indescribable quality of her glances. The German woman was quite
ordinary; there were two boys to look after; they were ordinary,
too, I presume; and Flora, I understand, was very attentive to
them.  If she taught them anything it must have been by inspiration
alone, for she certainly knew nothing of teaching.  But it was
mostly "conversation" which was demanded from her.  Flora de Barral
conversing with two small German boys, regularly, industriously,
conscientiously, in order to keep herself alive in the world which
held for her the past we know and the future of an even more undesirable
quality&mdash;seems to me a very fantastic combination.  But I believe
it was not so bad.  She was being, she wrote, mercifully drugged
by her task. She had learned to "converse" all day long, mechanically,
absently, as if in a trance.  An uneasy trance it must have been! 
Her worst moments were when off duty&mdash;alone in the evening, shut
up in her own little room, her dulled thoughts waking up slowly
till she started into the full consciousness of her position,
like a person waking up in contact with something venomous&mdash;a
snake, for instance&mdash;experiencing a mad impulse to fling the thing
away and run off screaming to hide somewhere.</p>

<p>At this period of her existence Flora de Barral used to write
to Mrs. Fyne not regularly but fairly often.  I don't know how
long she would have gone on "conversing" and, incidentally, helping
to supervise the beautifully stocked linen closets of that well-to-do
German household, if the man of it had not developed in the intervals
of his avocations (he was a merchant and a thoroughly domesticated
character) a psychological resemblance to the Bournemouth old
lady.  It appeared that he, too, wanted to be loved.</p>

<p>He was not, however, of a conquering temperament&mdash;a kiss-snatching,
doorbursting type of libertine.  In the very act of straying from
the path of virtue he remained a respectable merchant.  It would
have been perhaps better for Flora if he had been a mere brute. 
But he set about his sinister enterprise in a sentimental, cautious,
almost paternal manner; and thought he would be safe with a pretty
orphan.  The girl for all her experience was still too innocent,
and indeed not yet sufficiently aware of herself as a woman, to
mistrust these masked approaches.  She did not see them, in fact. 
She thought him sympathetic&mdash;the first expressively sympathetic
person she had ever met.  She was so innocent that she could not
understand the fury of the German woman.  For, as you may imagine,
the wifely penetration was not to be deceived for any great length
of time&mdash;the more so that the wife was older than the husband. 
The man with the peculiar cowardice of respectability never said
a word in Flora's defence.  He stood by and heard her reviled
in the most abusive terms, only nodding and frowning vaguely from
time to time.  It will give you the idea of the girl's innocence
when I say that at first she actually thought this storm of indignant
reproaches was caused by the discovery of her real name and her
relation to a convict.  She had been sent out under an assumed
name&mdash;a highly recommended orphan of honourable parentage.  Her
distress, her burning cheeks, her endeavours to express her regret
for this deception were taken for a confession of guilt.  "You
attempted to bring dishonour to my home," the German woman screamed
at her.</p>

<p>Here's a misunderstanding for you!  Flora de Barral, who felt
the shame but did not believe in the guilt of her father, retorted
fiercely, "Nevertheless I am as honourable as you are."  And then
the German woman nearly went into a fit from rage.  "I shall have
you thrown out into the street."</p>

<p>Flora was not exactly thrown out into the street, I believe,
but she was bundled bag and baggage on board a steamer for London. 
Did I tell you these people lived in Hamburg?  Well yes&mdash;sent
to the docks late on a rainy winter evening in charge of some
sneering lackey or other who behaved to her insolently and left
her on deck burning with indignation, her hair half down, shaking
with excitement and, truth to say, scared as near as possible
into hysterics.  If it had not been for the stewardess who, without
asking questions, good soul, took charge of her quietly in the
ladies' saloon (luckily it was empty) it is by no means certain
she would ever have reached England.  I can't tell if a straw
ever saved a drowning man, but I know that a mere glance is enough
to make despair pause.  For in truth we who are creatures of impulse
are not creatures of despair.  Suicide, I suspect, is very often
the outcome of mere mental weariness&mdash;not an act of savage energy
but the final symptom of complete collapse.  The quiet, matter-of-fact
attentions of a ship's stewardess, who did not seem aware of other
human agonies than sea-sickness, who talked of the probable weather
of the passage&mdash;it would be a rough night, she thought&mdash;and who
insisted in a professionally busy manner, "Let me make you comfortable
down below at once, miss," as though she were thinking of nothing
else but her tip&mdash;was enough to dissipate the shades of death
gathering round the mortal weariness of bewildered thinking which
makes the idea of non-existence welcome so often to the young.
Flora de Barral did lie down, and it may be presumed she slept. 
At any rate she survived the voyage across the North Sea and told
Mrs. Fyne all about it, concealing nothing and receiving no rebuke&mdash;for
Mrs. Fyne's opinions had a large freedom in their pedantry.  She
held, I suppose, that a woman holds an absolute right&mdash;or possesses
a perfect excuse&mdash;to escape in her own way from a man-mismanaged
world.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>What is to be noted is that even in London, having had time to
take a reflective view, poor Flora was far from being certain
as to the true inwardness of her violent dismissal.  She felt
the humiliation of it with an almost maddened resentment.</p>

<p>"And did you enlighten her on the point?" I ventured to ask.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fyne moved her shoulders with a philosophical acceptance
of all the necessities which ought not to be.  Something had to
be said, she murmured.  She had told the girl enough to make her
come to the right conclusion by herself.</p>

<p>"And she did?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  Of course.  She isn't a goose," retorted Mrs. Fyne tartly.</p>

<p>"Then her education is completed," I remarked with some bitterness.
"Don't you think she ought to be given a chance?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Fyne understood my meaning.</p>

<p>"Not this one," she snapped in a quite feminine way.  "It's all
very well for you to plead, but I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not plead.  I simply asked.  It seemed natural to ask what
you thought."</p>

<p>"It's what I feel that matters.  And I can't help my feelings. 
You may guess," she added in a softer tone, "that my feelings
are mostly concerned with my brother.  We were very fond of each
other.  The difference of our ages was not very great.  I suppose
you know he is a little younger than I am.  He was a sensitive
boy.  He had the habit of brooding.  It is no use concealing from
you that neither of us was happy at home.  You have heard, no
doubt . . . Yes?  Well, I was made still more unhappy and hurt
&mdash;I don't mind telling you that.  He made his way to some
distant relations of our mother's people who I believe were not
known to my father at all.  I don't wish to judge their action."</p>

<p>I interrupted Mrs. Fyne here.  I had heard.  Fyne was not very
communicative in general, but he was proud of his father-in-law&mdash;"Carleon
Anthony, the poet, you know."  Proud of his celebrity without
approving of his character.  It was on that account, I strongly
suspect, that he seized with avidity upon the theory of poetical
genius being allied to madness, which he got hold of in some idiotic
book everybody was reading a few years ago.  It struck him as
being truth itself&mdash;illuminating like the sun.  He adopted it
devoutly.  He bored me with it sometimes.  Once, just to shut
him up, I asked quietly if this theory which he regarded as so
incontrovertible did not cause him some uneasiness about his wife
and the dear girls?  He transfixed me with a pitying stare and
requested me in his deep solemn voice to remember the "well-established
fact" that genius was not transmissible.</p>

<p>I said only "Oh!  Isn't it?" and he thought he had silenced me
by an unanswerable argument.  But he continued to talk of his
glorious fatherin-law, and it was in the course of that conversation
that he told me how, when the Liverpool relations of the poet's
late wife naturally addressed themselves to him in considerable
concern, suggesting a friendly consultation as to the boy's future,
the incensed (but always refined) poet wrote in answer a letter
of mere polished <em>badinage</em> which offended mortally the
Liverpool people.  This witty outbreak of what was in fact mortification
and rage appeared to them so heartless that they simply kept the
boy.  They let him go to sea not because he was in their way but
because he begged hard to be allowed to go.</p>

<p>"Oh!  You do know," said Mrs. Fyne after a pause.  "Well &mdash;I
felt myself very much abandoned.  Then his choice of life&mdash;so
extraordinary, so unfortunate, I may say.  I was very much grieved. 
I should have liked him to have been distinguished&mdash;or at any
rate to remain in the social sphere where we could have had common
interests, acquaintances, thoughts. Don't think that I am estranged
from him.  But the precise truth is that I do not know him.  I
was most painfully affected when he was here by the difficulty
of finding a single topic we could discuss together."</p>

<p>While Mrs. Fyne was talking of her brother I let my thoughts
wander out of the room to little Fyne who by leaving me alone
with his wife had, so to speak, entrusted his domestic peace to
my honour.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Mrs. Fyne, does it not strike you that it would
be reasonable under the circumstances to let your brother take
care of himself?"</p>

<p>"And suppose I have grounds to think that he can't take care
of himself in a given instance."  She hesitated in a funny, bashful
manner which roused my interest.  Then:</p>

<p>"Sailors I believe are very susceptible," she added with forced
assurance.</p>

<p>I burst into a laugh which only increased the coldness of her
observing stare.</p>

<p>"They are.  Immensely!  Hopelessly!  My dear Mrs. Fyne, you had
better give it up!  It only makes your husband miserable."</p>

<p>"And I am quite miserable too.  It is really our first difference
. . . "</p>

<p>"Regarding Miss de Barral?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Regarding everything.  It's really intolerable that this girl
should be the occasion.  I think he really ought to give way."</p>

<p>She turned her chair round a little and picking up the book I
had been reading in the morning began to turn the leaves absently.</p>

<p>Her eyes being off me, I felt I could allow myself to leave the
room.  Its atmosphere had become hopeless for little Fyne's domestic
peace.  You may smile.  But to the solemn all things are solemn. 
I had enough sagacity to understand that.</p>

<p>I slipped out into the porch.  The dog was slumbering at Fyne's
feet.  The muscular little man leaning on his elbow and gazing
over the fields presented a forlorn figure.  He turned his head
quickly, but seeing I was alone, relapsed into his moody contemplation
of the green landscape.</p>

<p>I said loudly and distinctly: "I've come out to smoke a cigarette,"
and sat down near him on the little bench.  Then lowering my voice:
"Tolerance is an extremely difficult virtue," I said.  "More difficult
for some than heroism.  More difficult than compassion."</p>

<p>I avoided looking at him.  I knew well enough that he would not
like this opening.  General ideas were not to his taste.  He mistrusted
them.  I lighted a cigarette, not that I wanted to smoke, but
to give another moment to the consideration of the advice&mdash;the
diplomatic advice I had made up my mind to bowl him over with. 
And I continued in subdued tones.</p>

<p>"I have been led to make these remarks by what I have discovered
since you left us.  I suspected from the first.  And now I am
certain.  What your wife cannot tolerate in this affair is Miss
de Barral being what she is."</p>

<p>He made a movement, but I kept my eyes away from him and went
on steadily.  "That is&mdash;her being a woman.  I have some idea of
Mrs. Fyne's mental attitude towards society with its injustices,
with its atrocious or ridiculous conventions.  As against them
there is no audacity of action your wife's mind refuses to sanction. 
The doctrine which I imagine she stuffs into the pretty heads
of your girl-guests is almost vengeful.  A sort of moral fire-and-sword
doctrine.  How far the lesson is wise is not for me to say.  I
don't permit myself to judge.  I seem to see her very delightful
disciples singeing themselves with the torches, and cutting their
fingers with the swords of Mrs. Fyne's furnishing."</p>

<p>"My wife holds her opinions very seriously," murmured Fyne suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes.  No doubt," I assented in a low voice as before.  "But
it is a mere intellectual exercise.  What I see is that in dealing
with reality Mrs. Fyne ceases to be tolerant.  In other words,
that she can't forgive Miss de Barral for being a woman and behaving
like a woman.  And yet this is not only reasonable and natural,
but it is her only chance.  A woman against the world has no resources
but in herself.  Her only means of action is to be what <em>she
is</em>.  You understand what I mean."</p>

<p>Fyne mumbled between his teeth that he understood.  But he did
not seem interested.  What he expected of me was to extricate
him from a difficult situation.  I don't know how far credible
this may sound, to less solemn married couples, but to remain
at variance with his wife seemed to him a considerable incident. 
Almost a disaster.</p>

<p>"It looks as though I didn't care what happened to her brother,"
he said. "And after all if anything . . . "</p>

<p>I became a little impatient but without raising my tone:</p>

<p>"What thing?" I asked.  "The liability to get penal servitude
is so far like genius that it isn't hereditary.  And what else
can be objected to the girl?  All the energy of her deeper feelings,
which she would use up vainly in the danger and fatigue of a struggle
with society may be turned into devoted attachment to the man
who offers her a way of escape from what can be only a life of
moral anguish.  I don't mention the physical difficulties."</p>

<p>Glancing at Fyne out of the corner of one eye I discovered that
he was attentive.  He made the remark that I should have said
all this to his wife.  It was a sensible enough remark.  But I
had given Mrs. Fyne up.  I asked him if his impression was that
his wife meant to entrust him with a letter for her brother?</p>

<p>No.  He didn't think so.  There were certain reasons which made
Mrs. Fyne unwilling to commit her arguments to paper.  Fyne was
to be primed with them.  But he had no doubt that if he persisted
in his refusal she would make up her mind to write.</p>

<p>"She does not wish me to go unless with a full conviction that
she is right," said Fyne solemnly.</p>

<p>"She's very exacting," I commented.  And then I reflected that
she was used to it.  "Would nothing less do for once?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean that I should give way&mdash;do you?" asked Fyne in
a whisper of alarmed suspicion.</p>

<p>As this was exactly what I meant, I let his fright sink into
him.  He fidgeted.  If the word may be used of so solemn a personage,
he wriggled. And when the horrid suspicion had descended into
his very heels, so to speak, he became very still.  He sat gazing
stonily into space bounded by the yellow, burnt-up slopes of the
rising ground a couple of miles away. The face of the down showed
the white scar of the quarry where not more than sixteen hours
before Fyne and I had been groping in the dark with horrible apprehension
of finding under our hands the shattered body of a girl.  For
myself I had in addition the memory of my meeting with her. She
was certainly walking very near the edge&mdash;courting a sinister
solution.  But, now, having by the most unexpected chance come
upon a man, she had found another way to escape from the world. 
Such world as was open to her&mdash;without shelter, without bread,
without honour.  The best she could have found in it would have
been a precarious dole of pity diminishing as her years increased. 
The appeal of the abandoned child Flora to the sympathies of the
Fynes had been irresistible.  But now she had become a woman,
and Mrs. Fyne was presenting an implacable front to a particularly
feminine transaction.  I may say triumphantly feminine.  It is
true that Mrs. Fyne did not want women to be women.  Her theory
was that they should turn themselves into unscrupulous sexless
nuisances.  An offended theorist dwelt in her bosom somewhere. 
In what way she expected Flora de Barral to set about saving herself
from a most miserable existence I can't conceive; but I verify
believe that she would have found it easier to forgive the girl
an actual crime; say the rifling of the Bournemouth old lady's
desk, for instance.  And then&mdash;for Mrs. Fyne was very much of
a woman herself&mdash;her sense of proprietorship was very strong within
her; and though she had not much use for her brother, yet she
did not like to see him annexed by another woman.  By a chit of
a girl.  And such a girl, too.  Nothing is truer than that, in
this world, the luckless have no right to their opportunities&mdash;as
if misfortune were a legal disqualification.  Fyne's sentiments
(as they naturally would be in a man) had more stability.  A good
deal of his sympathy survived. Indeed I heard him murmur "Ghastly
nuisance," but I knew it was of the integrity of his domestic
accord that he was thinking.  With my eyes on the dog lying curled
up in sleep in the middle of the porch I suggested in a subdued
impersonal tone: "Yes.  Why not let yourself be persuaded?"</p>

<p>I never saw little Fyne less solemn.  He hissed through his teeth
in unexpectedly figurative style that it would take a lot to persuade
him to "push under the head of a poor devil of a girl quite sufficiently
plucky"&mdash;and snorted.  He was still gazing at the distant quarry,
and I think he was affected by that sight.  I assured him that
I was far from advising him to do anything so cruel.  I am convinced
he had always doubted the soundness of my principles, because
he turned on me swiftly as though he had been on the watch for
a lapse from the straight path.</p>

<p>"Then what do you mean?  That I should pretend!"</p>

<p>"No!  What nonsense!  It would be immoral.  I may however tell
you that if I had to make a choice I would rather do something
immoral than something cruel.  What I meant was that, not believing
in the efficacy of the interference, the whole question is reduced
to your consenting to do what your wife wishes you to do.  That
would be acting like a gentleman, surely.  And acting unselfishly
too, because I can very well understand how distasteful it may
be to you.  Generally speaking, an unselfish action is a moral
action.  I'll tell you what.  I'll go with you."</p>

<p>He turned round and stared at me with surprise and suspicion. 
"You would go with me?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"You don't understand," I said, amused at the incredulous disgust
of his tone.  "I must run up to town, to-morrow morning.  Let
us go together. You have a set of travelling chessmen."</p>

<p>His physiognomy, contracted by a variety of emotions, relaxed
to a certain extent at the idea of a game.  I told him that as
I had business at the Docks he should have my company to the very
ship.</p>

<p>"We shall beguile the way to the wilds of the East by improving
conversation," I encouraged him.</p>

<p>"My brother-in-law is staying at an hotel&mdash;the Eastern Hotel,"
he said, becoming sombre again.  "I haven't the slightest idea
where it is."</p>

<p>"I know the place.  I shall leave you at the door with the comfortable
conviction that you are doing what's right since it pleases a
lady and cannot do any harm to anybody whatever."</p>

<p>"You think so?  No harm to anybody?" he repeated doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I assure you it's not the slightest use," I said with all possible
emphasis which seemed only to increase the solemn discontent of
his expression.</p>

<p>"But in order that my going should be a perfectly candid proceeding
I must first convince my wife that it isn't the slightest use,"
he objected portentously.</p>

<p>"Oh, you casuist!" I said.  And I said nothing more because at
that moment Mrs. Fyne stepped out into the porch.  We rose together
at her appearance.  Her clear, colourless, unflinching glance
enveloped us both critically.  I sustained the chill smilingly,
but Fyne stooped at once to release the dog.  He was some time
about it; then simultaneously with his recovery of upright position
the animal passed at one bound from profoundest slumber into most
tumultuous activity.  Enveloped in the tornado of his inane scurryings
and barkings I took Mrs. Fyne's hand extended to me woodenly and
bowed over it with deference.  She walked down the path without
a word; Fyne had preceded her and was waiting by the open gate. 
They passed out and walked up the road surrounded by a low cloud
of dust raised by the dog gyrating madly about their two figures
progressing side by side with rectitude and propriety, and (I
don't know why) looking to me as if they had annexed the whole
countryside.  Perhaps it was that they had impressed me somehow
with the sense of their superiority.  What superiority?  Perhaps
it consisted just in their limitations.  It was obvious that neither
of them had carried away a high opinion of me.  But what affected
me most was the indifference of the Fyne dog.  He used to precipitate
himself at full speed and with a frightful final upward spring
upon my waistcoat, at least once at each of our meetings.  He
had neglected that ceremony this time notwithstanding my correct
and even conventional conduct in offering him a cake; it seemed
to me symbolic of my final separation from the Fyne household. 
And I remembered against him how on a certain day he had abandoned
poor Flora de Barral&mdash;who was morbidly sensitive.</p>

<p>I sat down in the porch and, maybe inspired by secret antagonism
to the Fynes, I said to myself deliberately that Captain Anthony
must be a fine fellow.  Yet on the facts as I knew them he might
have been a dangerous trifler or a downright scoundrel.  He had
made a miserable, hopeless girl follow him clandestinely to London. 
It is true that the girl had written since, only Mrs. Fyne had
been remarkably vague as to the contents.  They were unsatisfactory. 
They did not positively announce imminent nuptials as far as I
could make it out from her rather mysterious hints.  But then
her inexperience might have led her astray.  There was no fathoming
the innocence of a woman like Mrs. Fyne who, venturing as far
as possible in theory, would know nothing of the real aspect of
things.  It would have been comic if she were making all this
fuss for nothing.  But I rejected this suspicion for the honour
of human nature.</p>

<p>I imagined to myself Captain Anthony as simple and romantic. 
It was much more pleasant.  Genius is not hereditary but temperament
may be.  And he was the son of a poet with an admirable gift of
individualising, of etherealizing the common-place; of making
touching, delicate, fascinating the most hopeless conventions
of the, so-called, refined existence.</p>

<p>What I could not understand was Mrs. Fyne's dog-in-the-manger
attitude. Sentimentally she needed that brother of hers so little! 
What could it matter to her one way or another&mdash;setting aside
common humanity which would suggest at least a neutral attitude. 
Unless indeed it was the blind working of the law that in our
world of chances the luckless <em>must</em> be put in the wrong
somehow.</p>

<p>And musing thus on the general inclination of our instincts towards
injustice I met unexpectedly, at the turn of the road, as it were,
a shape of duplicity.  It might have been unconscious on Mrs.
Fyne's part, but her leading idea appeared to me to be not to
keep, not to preserve her brother, but to get rid of him definitely. 
She did not hope to stop anything.  She had too much sense for
that.  Almost anyone out of an idiot asylum would have had enough
sense for that.  She wanted the protest to be made, emphatically,
with Fyne's fullest concurrence in order to make all intercourse
for the future impossible.  Such an action would estrange the
pair for ever from the Fynes.  She understood her brother and
the girl too.  Happy together, they would never forgive that outspoken
hostility&mdash;and should the marriage turn out badly . . . Well,
it would be just the same.  Neither of them would be likely to
bring their troubles to such a good prophet of evil.</p>

<p>Yes.  That must have been her motive.  The inspiration of a possibly
unconscious Machiavellism!  Either she was afraid of having a
sister-inlaw to look after during the husband's long absences;
or dreaded the more or less distant eventuality of her brother
being persuaded to leave the sea, the friendly refuge of his unhappy
youth, and to settle on shore, bringing to her very door this
undesirable, this embarrassing connection. She wanted to be done
with it&mdash;maybe simply from the fatigue of continuous effort in
good or evil, which, in the bulk of common mortals, accounts for
so many surprising inconsistencies of conduct.</p>

<p>I don't know that I had classed Mrs. Fyne, in my thoughts, amongst
common mortals.  She was too quietly sure of herself for that. 
But little Fyne, as I spied him next morning (out of the carriage
window) speeding along the platform, looked very much like a common,
flustered mortal who has made a very near thing of catching his
train: the starting wild eyes, the tense and excited face, the
distracted gait, all the common symptoms were there, rendered
more impressive by his native solemnity which flapped about him
like a disordered garment.  Had he &mdash;I asked myself with
interest&mdash;resisted his wife to the very last minute and then bolted
up the road from the last conclusive argument, as though it had
been a loaded gun suddenly produced?  I opened the carriage door,
and a vigorous porter shoved him in from behind just as the end
of the rustic platform went gliding swiftly from under his feet. 
He was very much out of breath, and I waited with some curiosity
for the moment he would recover his power of speech.  That moment
came.  He said "Good morning" with a slight gasp, remained very
still for another minute and then pulled out of his pocket the
travelling chessboard, and holding it in his hand, directed at
me a glance of inquiry.</p>

<p>"Yes.  Certainly," I said, very much disappointed.</p>
