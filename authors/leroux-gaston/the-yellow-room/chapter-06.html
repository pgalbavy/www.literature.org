<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>We reached the chateau, and, as we approached it, saw four gendarmes
pacing in front of a little door in the ground floor of the donjon.
We soon learned that in this ground floor, which had formerly
served as a prison, Monsieur and Madame Bernier, the concierges,
were confined. Monsieur Robert Darzac led us into the modern part
of the chateau by a large door, protected by a projecting awning&mdash;a
"marquise" as it is called. Rouletabille, who had resigned the
horse and the cab to the care of a servant, never took his eyes
off Monsieur Darzac. I followed his look and perceived that it
was directed solely towards the gloved hands of the Sorbonne professor.
When we were in a tiny sitting-room fitted with old furniture,
Monsieur Darzac turned to Rouletabille and said sharply:</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>The reporter answered in an equally sharp tone:</p>

<p>"To shake you by the hand."</p>

<p>Darzac shrank back.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?"</p>

<p>Evidently he understood, what I also understood, that my friend
suspected him of the abominable attempt on the life of Mademoiselle
Stangerson. The impression of the blood-stained hand on the walls
of The "Yellow Room" was in his mind. I looked at the man closely.
His haughty face with its expression ordinarily so straightforward
was at this moment strangely troubled. He held out his right hand
and, referring to me, said:</p>

<p>"As you are a friend of Monsieur Sainclair who has rendered me
invaluable services in a just cause, monsieur, I see no reason
for refusing you my hand&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rouletabille did not take the extended hand. Lying with the utmost
audacity, he said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, I have lived several years in Russia, where I have
acquired the habit of never taking any but an ungloved hand."</p>

<p>I thought that the Sorbonne professor would express his anger
openly, but, on the contrary, by a visibly violent effort, he
calmed himself, took off his gloves, and showed his hands; they
were unmarked by any cicatrix.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>"No!" replied Rouletabille. "My dear friend," he said, turning
to me, "I am obliged to ask you to leave us alone for a moment."</p>

<p>I bowed and retired; stupefied by what I had seen and heard.
I could not understand why Monsieur Robert Darzac had not already
shown the door to my impertinent, insulting, and stupid friend.
I was angry myself with Rouletabille at that moment, for his suspicions,
which had led to this scene of the gloves.</p>

<p>For some twenty minutes I walked about in front of the chateau,
trying vainly to link together the different events of the day.
What was in Rouletabille’s mind? Was it possible that he thought
Monsieur Robert Darzac to be the murderer? How could it be thought
that this man, who was to have married Mademoiselle Stangerson
in the course of a few days, had introduced himself into "The
Yellow Room" to assassinate his fiancee? I could find no explanation
as to how the murderer had been able to leave "The Yellow Room";
and so long as that mystery, which appeared to me so inexplicable,
remained unexplained, I thought it was the duty of all of us to
refrain from suspecting anybody. But, then, that seemingly senseless
phrase&mdash;"The presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the
garden its brightness"&mdash;still rang in my ears. What did it mean?
I was eager to rejoin Rouletabille and question him.</p>

<p>At that moment the young man came out of the chateau in the company
of Monsieur Robert Darzac, and, extraordinary to relate, I saw,
at a glance, that they were the best of friends. "We are going
to "The Yellow Room". Come with us," Rouletabille said to me.
"You know, my dear boy, I am going to keep you with me all day.
We’ll breakfast together somewhere about here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You’ll breakfast with me, here, gentlemen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, thanks," replied the young man. "We shall breakfast at the
Donjon Inn."</p>

<p>"You’ll fare very badly there; you’ll not find anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think so? Well, I hope to find something there," replied
Rouletabille. "After breakfast, we’ll set to work again. I’ll
write my article and if you’ll be so good as to take it to the
office for me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Won’t you come back with me to Paris?"</p>

<p>"No; I shall remain here."</p>

<p>I turned towards Rouletabille. He spoke quite seriously, and
Monsieur Robert Darzac did not appear to be in the least degree
surprised.</p>

<p>We were passing by the donjon and heard wailing voices. Rouletabille
asked:</p>

<p>"Why have these people been arrested?"</p>

<p>"It is a little my fault," said Monsieur Darzac. "I happened
to remark to the examining magistrate yesterday that it was inexplicable
that the concierges had had time to hear the revolver shots, to
dress themselves, and to cover so great a distance as that which
lies between their lodge and the pavilion, in the space of two
minutes; for not more than that interval of time had elapsed after
the firing of the shots when they were met by Daddy Jacques."</p>

<p>"That was suspicious evidently," acquiesced Rouletabille. "And
were they dressed?"</p>

<p>"That is what is so incredible&mdash;they were dressed&mdash;completely&mdash;not
one part of their costume wanting. The woman wore sabots, but
the man had on laced boots. Now they assert that they went to
bed at half-past nine. On arriving this morning, the examining
magistrate brought with him from Paris a revolver of the same
calibre as that found in the room (for he couldn’t use the one
held for evidence), and made his Registrar fire two shots in "The
Yellow Room" while the doors and windows were closed. We were
with him in the lodge of the concierges, and yet we heard nothing,
not a sound. The concierges have lied, of that there can be no
doubt. They must have been already waiting, not far from the pavilion,
waiting for something! Certainly they are not to be accused of
being the authors of the crime, but their complicity is not improbable.
That was why Monsieur de Marquet had them arrested at once."</p>

<p>"If they had been accomplices," said Rouletabille, "they would
not have been there at all. When people throw themselves into
the arms of justice with the proofs of complicity on them, you
can be sure they are not accomplices. I don’t believe there are
any accomplices in this affair."</p>

<p>"Then, why were they abroad at midnight? Why don’t they say?"</p>

<p>"They have certainly some reason for their silence. What that
reason is, has to be found out; for, even if they are not accomplices,
it may be of importance. Everything that took place on such a
night is important."</p>

<p>We had crossed an old bridge thrown over the Douve and were entering
the part of the park called the Oak Grove, The oaks here were
centuries old. Autumn had already shrivelled their tawny leaves,
and their high branches, black and contorted, looked like horrid
heads of hair, mingled with quaint reptiles such as the ancient
sculptors have made on the head of Medusa. This place, which Mademoiselle
found cheerful and in which she lived in the summer season, appeared
to us as sad and funereal now. The soil was black and muddy from
the recent rains and the rotting of the fallen leaves; the trunks
of the trees were black and the sky above us was now, as if in
mourning, charged with great, heavy clouds.</p>

<p>And it was in this sombre and desolate retreat that we saw the
white walls of the pavilion as we approached. A queer-looking
building without a window visible on the side by which we neared
it. A little door alone marked the entrance to it. It might have
passed for a tomb, a vast mausoleum in the midst of a thick forest.
As we came nearer, we were able to make out its disposition. The
building obtained all the light it needed from the south, that
is to say, from the open country. The little door closed on the
park. Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson must have found it
an ideal seclusion for their work and their dreams.</p>

<p>Here is the ground plan of the pavilion. It had a ground-floor
which was reached by a few steps, and above it was an attic, with
which we need not concern ourselves. The plan of the ground-floor
only, sketched roughly, is what I here submit to the reader.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
1. "The Yellow Room", with its one window and its one door opening<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the laboratory.

</p>
<p>
2. Laboratory, with its two large, barred windows and its doors,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one serving for the vestibule, the other for "The Yellow Room".

</p>
<p>
3. Vestibule, with its unbarred window and door opening into the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;park.

</p>
</div>
<p>  4. Lavatory.</p>

<p>  5. Stairs leading to the attic.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
6. Large and the only chimney in the pavilion, serving for the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experiments of the laboratory.

</p>
</div>
<p>The plan was drawn by Rouletabille, and I assured myself that
there was not a line in it that was wanting to help to the solution
of the problem then set before the police. With the lines of this
plan and the description of its parts before them, my readers
will know as much as Rouletabille knew when he entered the pavilion
for the first time. With him they may now ask: How did the murderer
escape from "The Yellow Room"? Before mounting the three steps
leading up to the door of the pavilion, Rouletabille stopped and
asked Monsieur Darzac point blank:</p>

<p>"What was the motive for the crime?"</p>

<p>"Speaking for myself, Monsieur, there can be no doubt on the
matter,"  said Mademoiselle Stangerson’s fiance, greatly distressed.
"The nails of the fingers, the deep scratches on the chest and
throat of Mademoiselle Stangerson show that the wretch who attacked
her attempted to commit a frightful crime. The medical experts
who examined these traces yesterday affirm that they were made
by the same hand as that which left its red imprint on the wall;
an enormous hand, Monsieur, much too large to go into my gloves,"
he added with an indefinable smile.</p>

<p>"Could not that blood-stained hand," I interrupted, "have been
the hand of Mademoiselle Stangerson who, in the moment of falling,
had pressed it against the wall, and, in slipping, enlarged the
impression?"</p>

<p>"There was not a drop of blood on either of her hands when she
was lifted up," replied Monsieur Darzac.</p>

<p>"We are now sure," said I, "that it was Mademoiselle Stangerson
who was armed with Daddy Jacques’s revolver, since she wounded
the hand of the murderer. She was in fear, then, of somebody or
something."</p>

<p>"Probably."</p>

<p>"Do you suspect anybody?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Monsieur Darzac, looking at Rouletabille. Rouletabille
then said to me:</p>

<p>"You must know, my friend, that the inquiry is a little more
advanced than Monsieur de Marquet has chosen to tell us. He not
only knows that Mademoiselle Stangerson defended herself with
the revolver, but he knows what the weapon was that was used to
attack her. Monsieur Darzac tells me it was a mutton-bone. Why
is Monsieur de Marquet surrounding this mutton-bone with so much
mystery? No doubt for the purpose of facilitating the inquiries
of the agents of the Surete? He imagines, perhaps, that the owner
of this instrument of crime, the most terrible invented, is going
to be found amongst those who are well-known in the slums of Paris
who use it. But who can ever say what passes through the brain
of an examining magistrate?" Rouletabille added with contemptuous
irony.</p>

<p>"Has a mutton-bone been found in "The Yellow Room"?" I asked
him.</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur," said Robert Darzac, "at the foot of the bed;
but I beg of you not to say anything about it." (I made a gesture
of assent.) "It was an enormous mutton-bone, the top of which,
or rather the joint, was still red with the blood of the frightful
wound. It was an old bone, which may, according to appearances,
have served in other crimes. That’s what Monsieur de Marquet thinks.
He has had it sent to the municipal laboratory at Paris to be
analysed. In fact, he thinks he has detected on it, not only the
blood of the last victim, but other stains of dried blood, evidences
of previous crimes."</p>

<p>"A mutton-bone in the hand of a skilled assassin is a frightful
weapon,"  said Rouletabille, "a more certain weapon than a heavy
hammer."</p>

<p>"The scoundrel has proved it to be so," said Monsieur Robert
Darzac, sadly. "The joint of the bone found exactly fits the wound
inflicted.</p>

<p>"My belief is that the wound would have been mortal, if the murderer’s
blow had not been arrested in the act by Mademoiselle Stangerson’s
revolver. Wounded in the hand, he dropped the mutton-bone and
fled. Unfortunately, the blow had been already given, and Mademoiselle
was stunned after having been nearly strangled. If she had succeeded
in wounding the man with the first shot of the revolver, she would,
doubtless, have escaped the blow with the bone. But she had certainly
employeeed her revolver too late; the first shot deviated and
lodged in the ceiling; it was the second only that took effect."</p>

<p>Having said this, Monsieur Darzac knocked at the door of the
pavilion. I must confess to feeling a strong impatience to reach
the spot where the crime had been committed. It was some time
before the door was opened by a man whom I at once recognised
as Daddy Jacques.</p>

<p>He appeared to be well over sixty years of age. He had a long
white beard and white hair, on which he wore a flat Basque cap.
He was dressed in a complete suit of chestnut-coloured velveteen,
worn at the sides; sabots were on his feet. He had rather a waspish-looking
face, the expression of which lightened, however, as soon as he
saw Monsieur Darzac.</p>

<p>"Friends," said our guide. "Nobody in the pavilion, Daddy Jacques?"</p>

<p>"I ought not to allow anybody to enter, Monsieur Robert, but
of course the order does not apply to you. These gentlemen of
justice have seen everything there is to be seen, and made enough
drawings, and drawn up enough reports&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Monsieur Jacques, one question before anything else,"
said Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"What is it, young man? If I can answer it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did your mistress wear her hair in bands, that evening? You
know what I mean&mdash;over her forehead?"</p>

<p>"No, young man. My mistress never wore her hair in the way you
suggest, neither on that day nor on any other. She had her hair
drawn up, as usual, so that her beautiful forehead could be seen,
pure as that of an unborn child!"</p>

<p>Rouletabille grunted and set to work examining the door, finding
that it fastened itself automatically. He satisfied himself that
it could never remain open and needed a key to open it. Then we
entered the vestibule, a small, well-lit room paved with square
red tiles.</p>

<p>"Ah! This is the window by which the murderer escaped!" said
Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"So they keep on saying, monsieur, so they keep on saying! But
if he had gone off that way, we should have been sure to have
seen him. We are not blind, neither Monsieur Stangerson nor me,
nor the concierges who are in prison. Why have they not put me
in prison, too, on account of my revolver?"</p>

<p>Rouletabille had already opened the window and was examining
the shutters.</p>

<p>"Were these closed at the time of the crime?"</p>

<p>"And fastened with the iron catch inside," said Daddy Jacques,
"and I am quite sure that the murderer did not get out that way."</p>

<p>"Are there any blood stains?"</p>

<p>"Yes, on the stones outside; but blood of what?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Rouletabille, "there are footmarks visible on the
path&mdash;the ground was very moist. I will look into that presently."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" interrupted Daddy Jacques; "the murderer did not
go that way."</p>

<p>"Which way did he go, then?"</p>

<p>"How do I know?"</p>

<p>Rouletabille looked at everything, smelled everything. He went
down on his knees and rapidly examined every one of the paving
tiles. Daddy Jacques went on:</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;you can’t find anything, monsieur. Nothing has been found.
And now it is all dirty; too many persons have tramped over it.
They wouldn’t let me wash it, but on the day of the crime I had
washed the floor thoroughly, and if the murderer had crossed it
with his hobnailed boots, I should not have failed to see where
he had been; he has left marks enough in Mademoiselle’s chamber."</p>

<p>Rouletabille rose.</p>

<p>"When was the last time you washed these tiles?" he asked, and
he fixed on Daddy Jacques a most searching look.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;as I told you&mdash;on the day of the crime, towards half-past
five&mdash;while Mademoiselle and her father were taking a little walk
before dinner, here in this room: they had dined in the laboratory.
The next day, the examining magistrate came and saw all the marks
there were on the floor as plainly as if they had been made with
ink on white paper. Well, neither in the laboratory nor in the
vestibule, which were both as clean as a new pin, were there any
traces of a man’s footmarks. Since they have been found near this
window outside, he must have made his way through the ceiling
of "The Yellow Room" into the attic, then cut his way through
the roof and dropped to the ground outside the vestibule window.
But&mdash;there’s no hole, neither in the ceiling of "The Yellow Room"
nor in the roof of my attic&mdash;that’s absolutely certain! So you
see we know nothing&mdash;nothing! And nothing will ever be known!
It’s a mystery of the Devil’s own making."</p>

<p>Rouletabille went down upon his knees again almost in front of
a small lavatory at the back of the vestibule. In that position
he remained for about a minute.</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked him when he got up.</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing very important,&mdash;a drop of blood," he replied, turning
towards Daddy Jacques as he spoke. "While you were washing the
laboratory and this vestibule, was the vestibule window open?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur, it was closed; but after I had done washing the
floor, I lit some charcoal for Monsieur in the laboratory furnace,
and, as I lit it with old newspapers, it smoked, so I opened both
the windows in the laboratory and this one, to make a current
of air; then I shut those in the laboratory and left this one
open when I went out. When I returned to the pavilion, this window
had been closed and Monsieur and Mademoiselle were already at
work in the laboratory."</p>

<p>"Monsieur or Mademoiselle Stangerson had, no doubt, shut it?"</p>

<p>"No doubt."</p>

<p>"You did not ask them?"</p>

<p>After a close scrutiny of the little lavatory and of the staircase
leading up to the attic, Rouletabille&mdash;to whom we seemed no longer
to exist&mdash;entered the laboratory. I followed him. It was, I confess,
in a state of great excitement. Robert Darzac lost none of my
friend’s movements. As for me, my eyes were drawn at once to the
door of "The Yellow Room". It was closed and, as I immediately
saw, partially shattered and out of commission.</p>

<p>My friend, who went about his work methodically, silently studied
the room in which we were. It was large and well-lighted. Two
big windows&mdash;almost bays&mdash;were protected by strong iron bars and
looked out upon a wide extent of country. Through an opening in
the forest, they commanded a wonderful view through the length
of the valley and across the plain to the large town which could
be clearly seen in fair weather. To-day, however, a mist hung
over the ground&mdash;and blood in that room!</p>

<p>The whole of one side of the laboratory was taken up with a large
chimney, crucibles, ovens, and such implements as are needed for
chemical experiments; tables, loaded with phials, papers, reports,
an electrical machine,&mdash;an apparatus, as Monsieur Darzac informed
me, employeeed by Professor Stangerson to demonstrate the Dissociation
of Matter under the action of solar light&mdash;and other scientific
implements.</p>

<p>Along the walls were cabinets, plain or glass-fronted, through
which were visible microscopes, special photographic apparatus,
and a large quantity of crystals.</p>

<p>Rouletabille, who was ferreting in the chimney, put his fingers
into one of the crucibles. Suddenly he drew himself up, and held
up a piece of half-consumed paper in his hand. He stepped up to
where we were talking by one of the windows.</p>

<p>"Keep that for us, Monsieur Darzac," he said.</p>

<p>I bent over the piece of scorched paper which Monsieur Darzac
took from the hand of Rouletabille, and read distinctly the only
words that remained legible:</p>

<p>"Presbytery&mdash;lost nothing&mdash;charm, nor the gar&mdash;its brightness."</p>

<p>Twice since the morning these same meaningless words had struck
me, and, for the second time, I saw that they produced on the
Sorbonne professor the same paralysing effect. Monsieur Darzac’s
first anxiety showed itself when he turned his eyes in the direction
of Daddy Jacques. But, occupied as he was at another window, he
had seen nothing. Then tremblingly opening his pocket-book he
put the piece of paper into it, sighing: "My God!"</p>

<p>During this time, Rouletabille had mounted into the opening of
the fire-grate&mdash;that is to say, he had got upon the bricks of
a furnace&mdash;and was attentively examining the chimney, which grew
narrower towards the top, the outlet from it being closed with
sheets of iron, fastened into the brickwork, through which passed
three small chimneys.</p>

<p>"Impossible to get out that way," he said, jumping back into
the laboratory. "Besides, even if he had tried to do it, he would
have brought all that ironwork down to the ground. No, no; it
is not on that side we have to search."</p>

<p>Rouletabille next examined the furniture and opened the doors
of the cabinet. Then he came to the windows, through which he
declared no one could possibly have passed. At the second window
he found Daddy Jacques in contemplation.</p>

<p>"Well, Daddy Jacques," he said, "what are you looking at?"</p>

<p>"That policeman who is always going round and round the lake.
Another of those fellows who think they can see better than anybody
else!"</p>

<p>"You don’t know Frederic Larsan, Daddy Jacques, or you wouldn’t
speak of him in that way," said Rouletabille in a melancholy tone.
"If there is anyone who will find the murderer, it will be he."
And Rouletabille heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"Before they find him, they will have to learn how they lost
him," said Daddy Jacques, stolidly.</p>

<p>At length we reached the door of "The Yellow Room" itself.</p>

<p>"There is the door behind which some terrible scene took place,"
said Rouletabille, with a solemnity which, under any other circumstances,
would have been comical.</p>
