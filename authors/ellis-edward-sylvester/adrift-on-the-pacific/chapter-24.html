<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Three years have passed, and still Captain Bergen, Mate Storms
and Inez Hawthorne are upon the lonely Pearl Island in the South
Sea.</p>

<p>Could they have believed when they left Boston that they would
be doomed to such an imprisonment, it may well be doubted whether
they would have made the voyage, even if assured of the vast fortune
which thereby came into their hands.</p>

<p>The three years had been dismally monotonous to them, and their
courage had been tried to the utmost, for there had been times
when both agreed that they would probably stay there until released
by death, and then they fell to speculating as to which would
be the last one to survive. According to human logic, it would
seem that that lot would fall to Inez, and their hearts sank at
the thought of her being left to perish in the lonely spot.</p>

<p>When the coat fluttering from the top of the mast was blown away
by the gale, Captain Bergen climbed up and nailed another in its
place, grimly remarking that it looked as if they were going down
with their colors flying.</p>

<p>It was surprising what was done by Mate Storms, whose ingenuity
was almost incredible. With the material at his command, he kept
Inez clothed in a tasteful manner.</p>

<p>She wore dresses and shoes which fitted her well, and her hat
was renewed with extraordinary skill, from material obtained from
the palm-trees.</p>

<p>Those three years, although of indescribable weariness at times,
were marked by some startling incidents, and by many worthy of
record. The great object of Storms was to educate Inez, and he
did his utmost in that direction, assisted by the bright intellect
of the girl and her own ardent desire to explore the wonders of
knowledge.</p>

<p>There were few facilities in the way of furniture, considered
so indispensable in these later days. He had no pens or ink, and
only a Bible in the way of books. He had some blank paper and
a single lead pencil, which were utilized to their fullest extent.
For a slate or blackboard, he used the beach, as did Archimedes
of the olden time.</p>

<p>Selecting a place where the water had left it hard and smooth,
Storms, with a sharp-pointed stick, made his characters and gave
his instruction in the mysteries of mathematics.</p>

<p>It would sound incredible were we to say that, during those three
years, the dwellers on the lonely atoll had never descried a sail;
and such was not a fact, for there are few shores on this globe
where a human being can bury himself so long from sight of the
white-winged birds of commerce. They had seen many ships, but
it looked very much as if they themselves had not been seen, nor
had their presence been suspected by any of them.</p>

<p>"The idea of our being so nervous lest some one should get here
ahead of us," remarked Storms, more than once, "when we might
have delayed our coming a dozen years without any danger from
that cause."</p>

<p>They had discovered the cloud-like picture of the canvas sail
as it came up over the horizon, and their hearts swelled as it
expanded and came closer. But all hope faded again when it grew
less in the distance and finally passed from view altogether.</p>

<p>This had happened repeatedly, and more than once Captain Bergen
had laboriously made his way up the smooth mast to the very top,
where he swung his hat wildly; but it must have been that the
little island in the South Seas possessed slight interest in the
eyes of the navigators who occasionally drifted in that direction,
for had they seen the signal of distress, or caught sight of the
man frantically waving his hat from the top, they would have learned
what its meaning was.</p>

<p>The greatest dejection which took possession of the couple was
when they, through the glass, saw the Stars and Stripes fluttering
from the mizzen of the ship which came the nearest and then made
off again. The sight of that most beautiful banner in the world
was like a glimpse of their distant New England home, and they
seemed to feel the cool breeze fanning their hot brows as it bore
steadily toward them.</p>

<p>When it went over the convex sea out of sight, Captain Bergen
covered his face with his hands and wept, and when, after awhile,
he looked up again, he saw the tears on the cheeks of Abe Storms,
who stood motionless and gazing silently off upon the deep, as
if he expected the vessel would come back to them. It was a severe
blow, and it was a long time before they recovered from it.</p>

<p>The exact age of Inez Hawthorne when she became, by an extraordinary
turn of the wheel of fortune, the protégée of the two sailors,
was, as given by herself, six years, but both the captain and
mate were confident that she was fully one, if not two years older.</p>

<p>Now, at the termination of the period named, she was a girl as
fully developed mentally and physically as one of a dozen years,
and she was growing into a woman of striking beauty. She was still
a child, with all the innocence and simplicity which distinguished
her at the time she was taken from the deck of the steamer <em>Polynesia</em>,
but in a few years more, should she be spared, she would become
a woman.</p>

<p>Captain Bergen and Mate Storms were honest, conscientious men,
and Christians, and they performed their full duty in that most
important respect to Inez Hawthorne. Never passed a day in which
Storms did not read, in an impressive voice, from the great Book
of all books, and the sublime passages, the wonderful precepts,
the divine truths and the sacred instruction from that volume
were seed which fell upon good ground and bore its fruit in due
season.</p>

<p>If ever there was a good, pure, devout Christian, Inez Hawthorne
became one, and her greatest desire, as she repeatedly expressed
it, was that she might go out in the great world among all people,
and do her utmost to carry the glad tidings to them.</p>

<p>"The time will come," replied Abe Storms, when he listened to
these glowing wishes. "God never intended you should live and
die upon this lonely island when there is such need for missionaries
like you. I don't see that we are of much account, but I believe
He has something for us, too, and we shall be given the opportunity
to do it."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the skipper, with a sigh, "you have been saying that
for three years, and the sails that come go again and care nothing
for us. I am beginning to believe we are to stay here for the
rest of our lives, and that I am to be the first one to take the
long, last sleep that awaits us all."</p>
