<p>"Good morning, Grandfather Mole!" Jolly Robin called.
</p>
<p>"What!" cried Grandfather Mole. "Have I made the mistake again of coming
up on top of Farmer Green's garden?"
</p><p>"You certainly have," Jolly told him.
</p><p>"I must be getting old," said Grandfather Mole. "I'm growing more
careless every day. I didn't mean to dig my way above ground." And then,
thrusting his long nose right into the dirt, he began to burrow out of
sight.
</p><p>"Stop! Please stop!" Jolly Robin besought him. "I want to ask you a
question about digging."
</p><p>Grandfather Mole pulled his nose out of the ground.
</p><p>"What's your question?" he inquired.
</p><p>"It's about Grunty Pig," Jolly Robin began.
</p><p>"I thought you said it was about digging," Grandfather Mole grumbled.
And he started to burrow once more.
</p><p>"So it is!" Jolly exclaimed. "I want to know how long it will take
Grunty Pig to dig up the apple tree where I live."
</p><p>Again Grandfather Mole paused.
</p><p>"It all depends," he muttered. "It all depends on how much of his time
he spends at digging."
</p><p>"He works every day," said Jolly Robin. "A good, long while every day!"
</p><p>Grandfather Mole appeared to be thinking deeply.
</p><p>"He boasts--" Jolly Robin explained--"he boasts that he will have the
tree uprooted before fall."
</p><p>"Nonsense!" Grandfather Mole snorted. "If Grunty Pig says that, he
doesn't know much about apple trees. He may be a fair digger; but he
must be stupid."
</p><p>"That's what I've always thought!" Jolly Robin exclaimed.
</p><p>"He can't go very deep into things, or he'd never have made such a
boast," Grandfather Mole declared. "When Grunty Pig digs, does he dig
right down out of sight?"
</p><p>"Oh, no! Never!" said Jolly Robin.
</p><p>"Ah! He merely scratches the surface!" Grandfather Mole remarked with a
wise nod of his head. "Well, it's no wonder that he made such a
mistake."
</p><p>"Mistake!" Jolly Robin echoed. "Do you mean that Grunty Pig won't have
our apple tree down by fall?"
</p><p>"I do," Grandfather Mole answered. "The roots of a big, old apple tree
spread out a good rod in every direction. And it would take a hundred
Grunty Pigs a whole summer to dig them free."
</p><p>A broad smile spread over Jolly Robin's face.
</p><p>"Then--" he ventured--"then wouldn't it take Grunty Pig a hundred
summers to dig up our tree, if he worked alone?"
</p><p>"No doubt!" Grandfather replied. "Or, to be on the safe side, I'll say
he could uproot your tree in ninety-nine summers."
</p><p>"Hurrah!" Jolly Robin shouted. "Hurrah--and thank you, Grandfather
Mole!" And leaving the old gentleman to dig himself out of sight, Jolly
Robin hurried home to his wife.
</p><p>Mrs. Robin was glad to see him. She knew, as soon as she caught a
glimpse of his face, that he had good news for her. And she needed
cheering, poor soul! For Grunty Pig was beneath the tree again, digging
away in a most businesslike fashion.
</p><p>"Let him dig!" Jolly Robin whispered to his wife. "Grandfather Mole says
it will take him ninety-nine summers to topple our tree over. And you
know that Grandfather Mole is the greatest burrower in Pleasant Valley."
</p><p>Mrs. Robin felt better at once. Looking down at Grunty Pig, she said to
her husband, "How stupid this son of Mrs. Pig's is! He has turned up at
least a dozen angleworms while you've been gone. And he has let every
one of them get away from him!"
