<p>AS was predicted, the storm soon cleared away, and the morning
dawned bright and beautiful. Birds were singing and flitting from
limb to limb, the water sparkled upon the grass and twigs, and
by the time it was fairly light, the whole village was astir.</p>

<p>Down in the water, but safely moored to shore, rested a flat-boat,
waiting for its living freight, before being loosened from its
fastenings. As the commotion in the village increased, numbers
commenced wending their way toward the river, and in a short time
nearly all stood upon the shore. The majority carried furniture
and utensils with them, which, by passing over several planks,
were deposited upon the boat.</p>

<p>The farewells were now given. There were ten men, seven of whom
had wives, besides Marian, so that the entire number was eighteen.
With the exception of the latter, these had embarked all of their
wealth and possessions upon this perilous undertaking.</p>

<p>Marian embraced her parents, received their last advice, and,
as she passed over the plank, encountered Mansfield.</p>

<p>"Good-by," she said, gayly; "I shall soon expect you."</p>

<p>He took her hand, and, holding it a moment, said:</p>

<p>"I trust we shall be separated but a short time, dear Marian.
I have lain awake all night thinking of this, and I believe there
<em>is</em> danger&mdash;danger not only upon the river, but after
you have reached your destination. You know to whom I refer&mdash;and
oh! let me beseech you to be careful of exposing yourself. God
bless you! Good-by, and may we soon meet again."</p>

<p>He wrung her hand, as she passed over the boat; the plank was
drawn on board, the fastenings unloosened, and the flat-boat commenced
slowly moving with the current.</p>

<p>"Good luck to you!" called out Abbot. "Look out for danger; have
your eyes open for decoys, and don't, under any pretense, be induced
to leave the center of the stream. If you are betrayed, you will
have no one to blame but yourselves, for you are now warned."</p>

<p>The flat-boat slowly swept out into the stream, and, after a
time, gaining the center of the current, moved forward with greater
rapidity. Numbers yet stood upon the shore, waving their farewells;
but the boat soon rounded a bend, and they all disappeared from
view.</p>

<p>Those on board now withdrew their eyes from the shore, and made
preparations for the perilous journey before them. The flat-boat
was a large, unwieldy affair, built like all similar ones, so
as to float with the current alone. The sides were bullet-proof,
and the shape of the thing was similar to a box. About three-fourths
of the length were taken up as the cabin, which communicated with
the other part by means of a small door. A long, sweeping oar
was hung at each end, and balanced so as to dip into the water.
There was a small space at either end of the boat which could
be reached by passing through the cabin. The latter was divided
into two compartments, and as regarded comfort and convenience,
probably the flat-boat could have been little improved.</p>

<p>The occasion and season of the year were such that none could
help feeling buoyant and hopeful. The sun was now up in the heavens,
shedding its warm and cheering rays upon forest and river. The
rain-drops hung like pendent jewels, and the river glistened like
molten gold. A thin mist was rising along the shore, as the sun's
warmth grew greater. Now and then a woodsman's cabin was passed,
and it could be seen nestling in the small clearing, and apparently
as comfortable as though no enemy had ever threatened it. Perhaps
the settler himself came forth with his wife to wonder and view
the passing boat, and exchange salutations with the first white
persons they had seen for months. Toward noon they detected a
solitary form standing below them, upon a bend in the river. A
nearer approach, showed him to be a hunter. He waved his coon-skin
cap over his head as they came abreast, gave a cheering hurrah,
and called out:</p>

<p>"Keep a powerful look-out for reds, you, fur they're thick as
flies in August down toward the Big Sandy and Sciota. Wal they
is, strangers; and if you gits through without gittin' a taste
of thar compliments, why, here's as will stand treat all round."</p>

<p>After giving this warning, the hunter watched them a few minutes
longer, and then turned and disappeared in the forest.</p>

<p>Some miles farther down they passed a small settlement which
had been commenced but a few months before. A block-house, however,
was erected and stood at one end, as if to ward off all approach.
It was a clumsy, awkward building, but abundantly able to answer
every purpose for which it was intended. It was two stories in
height, the upper one so much smaller than the lower one, that
it had the appearance of standing upon a platform. The outer edge
of this projection was protected by palisades, inclosing it, except
at one point where the gaping mouth of a swivel gave warning of
the resistance it was capable of giving. The instrument was of
brass, and so brightly burnished that it could be seen gleaming
in the sunlight by those upon the flat-boat. A sentinel was pacing
slowly around the block-house, a long rifle resting upon his shoulder,
and his keen eye sweeping the horizon at a glance. As he caught
sight of the flat-boat, he raised his cap and saluted it; and
shortly after several others appeared beside him and did the same.
Our friends returned the salutation, and continued watching the
tiny settlement until the intervening forest hid it from view.</p>

<p>This block-house was constructed somewhat differently from those
generally upon the frontiers, although now and then a similar
one is found even at this day.</p>

<p>The settlements and solitary cabins were still passed at long
intervals, and the night proved so dark and cheerless, that they
put into shore near a small cluster of houses and spent the night.
As they were hardly yet in dangerous territory, they committed
no indiscretion in doing this.</p>

<p>At sunrise the boat was loosened, and our friends were once more
floating forward, a day's journey nearer their destination. Nothing
worth noting occurred through this day. The settlements became
more rare, and the faces of their kindred scarcer. Late in the
afternoon they passed the mouth of the Muskingum, and at night
a small river which put in from the Virginia side. There was a
slight moon this night. A vigilant watch, of course, was maintained,
but nothing to excite alarm took place.</p>

<p>In the morning they were opposite the point where the Great Kanawha
debouches into the Ohio. The settlement here was termed Point
Pleasant, by which name it is known at the present day. It was
at this point that they were joined by a man who stated that he
was a ranger going to Massie's Station down the Ohio. Without
the least mistrust or suspicion, our friends took him on board,
and continued floating hopefully down the beautiful river.</p>

<p>This day, when at the mouth of the Big Sandy, and just at the
elbow of the great bend in the Ohio, an attempt was made to decoy
them ashore. The stranger whom they had taken on board, instantly
warned them of their danger, and told them that they must pay
no attention to the entreaties from the white men. The emigrants,
as the case stood, would not have deviated from their course,
but the earnestness of their new-found friend made them esteem
him highly and congratulate themselves upon having secured such
a valuable ally.</p>

<p>All, we say, thought thus; but there were two exceptions &mdash;Marian
and a tall, bony, unmarried man by the name of Peterson. This
fellow looked upon their new acquaintance with distrust the minute
he stepped upon the boat.</p>

<p>"I'll be darned, Marian," he said, in an undertone to her, after
they had passed the decoy, "ef I don't s'picion that chap. He's
mighty clever, and the trouble is he is a <em>leetle too clever</em>."</p>

<p>"Do you really fear him?" asked Marian, frightened at finding
that another shared her suspicions.</p>

<p>"Fear him? I'd like to see the man <em>I'm</em> afeared of. All
I'd ask would be to just git them are paws on old Simon Girty
or that McGable that people allow is out in these parts, or that
man thar, if he ain't what he orter be, which I allow is the case."</p>

<p>"At any rate, watch him, Jim, for it won't do to have a traitor
within when there were so many without."</p>

<p>"I'll watch him, I reckon, Marian; and by the Eternal, the first
real genuine sign of treachery I see, I'll shoot him! You may
bet on that."</p>

<p>As these words were uttered by the indignant Jim Peterson to
Marian, he stood looking upon the object of his remarks with flashing
eyes, and gesticulating earnestly with his long, bony, muscular
arms as though he ached to get him once fairly within his grasp.
In fact, Jim Peterson would have been a dangerous customer for
any man. He was now about thirty years of age, and eight years
of his life had been spent as scout and ranger. He had served
under St. Clair and Gen. Harmar, and when the former suffered
such a disastrous defeat, he became so disgusted with the generalship
of his leaders, that he left the country and settled down in the
village mentioned at the commencement of this work. Here he had
remained until the present time; but the daring, wandering, reckless
spirit was so strong within him that he could resist no longer,
and he joined the present party with the full determination of
taking to the woods again as soon as they arrived at their destination.</p>

<p>He was over six feet in height, of a thin, attenuated frame,
capable of panther-like strength and activity, with a keen, restless
gray eye, and a sharp-featured visage.</p>

<p>Marian, after the conversation with him, descended to the cabin;
but her mind was in such a tumult of fear and apprehension that
she could not restrain her agitation. She now firmly believed
that the stranger above was an enemy, and that, even with the
shrewdness of Jim Peterson to protect them, they were all still
in the utmost peril. But she knew of no course to pursue, except
to invoke Divine protection. Should she impart her suspicions
to the females around her, they would either ridicule her or become
so terrified themselves, that the case would be infinitely worse.
She concluded, at last, that there was nothing she could do, and,
under Heaven, the case must be left to Peterson.</p>

<p>In a short time night commenced settling over the woods and river.
The emigrants had now made such progress upon their way, that
they were about half way between the Big Sandy and Sciota. The
dense forests of Kentucky and Ohio shut down upon either hand,
and not a sign of civilization met the eye.</p>

<p>Before it was fairly dark, the flat-boat was suddenly hailed
from the shore. A white man, limping and apparently in great distress,
besought them to run in and take him on board before the Indians
reached him.</p>

<p>"He's a decoy," remarked the stranger, who had intently watched
him from the first.</p>

<p>"How do you know he is, colonel?" asked Peterson, who had intently
watched the stranger all the time.</p>

<p>"How do I know he is?" repeated the latter. "I reckon as how
any fool as has one eye could tell the same mighty quick."</p>

<p>"You're sure of it then, eh?"</p>

<p>"In course I am, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Yas, sir."</p>

<p>With this the ranger turned on his heel, satisfied that they
had a traitor on board. This may seem strange to the reader, but
it would not be to a backwoodsman who understood the case. The
eagerness and quickness this man had evinced to point out danger,
ever since he joined our friends, was good reason in itself for
suspicion. Had he been a genuine ranger, he would have hesitated
before giving his opinion, and not defeat his own ends by showing
too much knowledge of what was unknown to the rest.</p>

<p>Peterson walked away from him, and communicated his suspicions
to several of his friends. Just as he expected, they laughed at
him, and accused him almost of meanness. Stung by this rebuke,
the ranger became silent and sullen and left them.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the man upon shore was bellowing louder than
ever. Not content with being once refused, he was limping along
shore, and beseeching them in more piteous tones than ever. Still
the whites resolutely turned their ears against him, and would
not have noticed him at all, had not the stranger spoken.</p>

<p>"I declare, it looks queer anyhow. I never knowed one of them
decoys to hang on like that."</p>

<p>"You have no notion that he is anything else but one, or that
he has any object except our own destruction?"</p>

<p>"I didn't think different at first, but it begins to look doubtful.
Just let me say a few words to him."</p>

<p>With this, he stepped to one side of the boat, and called out,
"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"John Haggart."</p>

<p>"How come you to git in such an ugly fix?"</p>

<p>"I was out scouting it, and was cotched by the Shawnees, and
have just got away from them. For God's sake, come and take me
off, for they're after me."</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
[Illustration: "For God's sake come and take me off, for they are<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after me."]

</p>
</div>
<p>"Jump into the river and swim out to us."</p>

<p>"My hurt is too bad; I've got a bullet clean through my thigh,
and can just drag the leg after the other. Yonder is the smoke
of their wigwams up on the hill and they ain't fur off. My God!
don't leave a white man thus! Heaven would curse you if you did."</p>

<p>Our friends looked in the direction he indicated, and could faintly
discern in the gathering gloom a thin wreath of smoke rising from
the trees. The suffering man, as if aware of their thoughts, called
out:</p>

<p>"That is whar' they are, and their runners are out after me.
May God forever curse you, if you leave me here."</p>

<p>"What do yer think?" asked the stranger, turning round with an
air of perplexity to the others. "I believe that man ain't a decoy,
not at all; and ef he isn't, we orter not leave him there to be
cooked by the red devils. Still, I shouldn't say nothing, but
leave it with you."</p>

<p>"It will never do to run the boat ashore," said several of the
men, firmly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't mean that. In course, it would be all-fired foolish
to do that ar' thing. But I've been thinking"&mdash;and the man dropped
his eyes, as if in great perplexity&mdash;"that we orter help that
man off. To do sich a thing we ain't compelled by any duty to
expose ourselves to any danger. What is your views, friends?"</p>

<p>"Why, if the thing can be done without imperiling ourselves,
it is our Christian duty to do it; but we are at a loss at present
to understand how we could manage it thus."</p>

<p>"Oh, easily enough; just run the boat in about half way where
the water is so shallow that the fellow can wade out to us. Keep
your eyes open, and if there is the least sign of treachery, we
can fall into the current again and float off."</p>

<p>"A good plan, and I see no reason for not carrying it out."</p>

<p>All echoed this sentiment, with the exception of Peterson, who
still stood apart, in a sullen, pouting mood, leaning against
the side of the boat, with his head dropped upon his breast.</p>

<p>"Come, Jim, what do you think of it?" asked one of the emigrants,
and the others all turned toward him for a reply.</p>

<p>"I think, in the first place, you are all a set of the thunderingest
fools I ever heard of, not to see you've got a sneaking decoy
right among ye, who's doing his purtiest to git you into shore
to please that other trap."</p>

<p>"Outrageous! shameful!" exclaimed several, horrified at the blunt,
plain-spoken answer they had received.</p>

<p>"Go on, and do what you please, but don't ax me nothin' more,
for I've got nothing at all to say," added Peterson, who was touched
to the quick by what he had heard in reply.</p>

<p>The stranger, it was observed, said nothing at all, except, after
a few minutes, to urge the matter upon our friends. It was now
quite dark, but the shadowy form of the man on shore could be
seen struggling along, and calling out in tones that were really
heartrending. The men consulted together a while longer, and then
it was determined to follow the suggestion of their friend.</p>

<p>The long, guiding oars were dipped into the water, and with a
loud plash swung a few feet, when the unwieldy flat-boat began
slowly sliding in toward shore. It moved very tardily, however,
and it was noticed that its progress down stream was continually
growing less and less. This was accounted for by the fact that
they were getting out of the current, and moving in shallow water.</p>

<p>The man, all this time, was limping and gesticulating on shore,
imploring them to hurry, as his life stood in imminent danger
every moment, and the whites, to their credit be it spoken, worked
with a good will.</p>

<p>They had hardly commenced rowing, when Marian asked Peterson
whether there was not another person upon the bank.</p>

<p>"It is a female, and see how motionless she stands! She is just
below that man."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see her&mdash;she is waving her hands. Hark!"</p>

<p>"Keep off! keep off! You will all be killed! This man is a decoy!"
called out the person alluded to in a beseeching voice.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" asked Marian, growing more excited every moment.</p>

<p>"Ah! she's the Frontier Angel. Haven't you heard of her? When
<em>she</em> warns a white, he can depend on it she means what
she says. This ain't the fust time she has done that thing."</p>

<p>  [Illustration: The Frontier Angel.]</p>

<p>"O Jim!" implored Marian, "this is awful; tell them before it
is too late. They cannot but heed you."</p>

<p>The ranger hesitated a moment, as he remembered the cutting rebuff
he had received; but the imploring voice of Marian, together with
his own sense of duty, conquered. He turned his head and looked
at the oarsmen. They had paused as the warning voice reached them.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" asked one.</p>

<p>"That gal is the Frontier Angel that you've heard the boys talk
about at the settlement. Ef any of you wants red night-caps, don't
mind her; ef you doesn't, jest get back into the channel as soon
as them oars will take you."</p>

<p>"<em>I've</em> heard that that gal you call the <em>Frontier
Angel</em> is nobody but a crazy squaw," said one of the oarsmen,
still hesitating.</p>

<p>"Go on, then," said Peterson, stung to the quick by this second
repulse. "I shan't say no more," he added, in a lower tone, to
Marian.</p>

<p>"Didn't you know that gal is a crazy fool?" said the stranger,
sneeringly. "Of course she is, and I thought you knowed it. Ef
you're going to help that dyin' feller, you've got to be quick
about it, 'cause the reds can't be far off."</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, the oarsmen commenced, although it cannot be
said all were free from misgivings. But in the face of the suspicious
actions of the man upon shore, and the continued warnings of the
Frontier Angel, the flat-boat gradually approached its doom. Several
of the men already half-repented their rashness, and stood with
their eyes fixed upon shore, and an expression of painful doubt
upon their features.</p>

<p>Peterson saw all these manifestations, and thus communed with
himself.</p>

<p>"No use of talkin', they're all goin' sure, and, Jim Peterson,
the question is what you purpose to do. You can tend to yourself
well enough, but how 'bout Marian? It won't do to leave her. You
hain't forgotten, Jim, the time them same reds butchered <em>your</em>
gal. No, Jim you never forgot that, and <em>you never will</em>;
and how do you s'pose Mansfield will feel ef you leave his gal
in the same fix? 'Twon't do, 'twon't do, Jim. Can you swim, Marian?"
he asked, turning toward her.</p>

<p>"Yes; why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"It's what has got to be done, Marian. You see, we'll be inshore
in a few minutes. Stick by me, and I'll take you overboard."</p>

<p>"Why not now, Jim?"</p>

<p>"You see it's getting dark fast, and every minute will help us.
By the eternal! do you know that feller on shore? It is McGable!
Hello! the boat has struck!"</p>

<p>Such was the case, and what was more alarming they were but a
few rods from shore. It was noticed, too, that the wailing tone
of the decoy had changed to a more commanding one, while the Frontier
Angel had disappeared.</p>

<p>"What does this mean, sir?" asked one of the oarsmen, thoroughly
alarmed.</p>

<p>"<em>You're my prisoners, sir!</em>" replied the stranger. "Don't
get excited&mdash;it's no use. That man is McGable, and the Shawnees
are waitin' fur yer ha'r. Ef you undertake to fight, you'll be
tomahawked in a minute; but ef you give in nice like, p'raps some
of yer'll be let alone. Ef you've no objections, I'll give the
signal for 'em to come aboard."</p>

<p>All except Peterson were paralyzed with horror, and seemed utterly
speechless. He stepped deliberately forward and said:</p>

<p>"I'd like to ax a question afore you does that thing. What yer
going to do with <em>me</em>?"</p>

<p>"Burn and toast you as soon as we get ashore."</p>

<p>"I rather reckon not, old hoss. <em>How does that suit?</em>"</p>

<p>Before even his victim divined his intention, the ranger brought
his rifle to his shoulder and fired, his ball passing clean through
the breast of the villain. The latter gave a spasmodic start and
gasp, a groan, and sucking the breath through his teeth, fell
forward, the blood spouting in a stream from his wound.</p>

<p>"Hyer's as opines as how it won't be <em>you</em> that'll toast
Jim Peterson just yit," remarked the ranger, coolly fastening
his rifle to his back.</p>

<p>"O God! what shall we do?" frantically wailed the settlers.</p>

<p>"Fight! you was so anxious to see McGable, you'll have the chance
now. Ef yer'd a minded what me and the Frontier Angel said, you
wouldn't got into this fix. It won't do no good to touch the oars.
You're fast in the mud, and have got to fight it out!"</p>

<p>Instantly the shore became alive with savages. Yells that might
have curdled a demon's blood rent the air, and the whole mass
of swarming bodies plunged into the shallow water, and made for
the flat-boat. The whites discharged their shots, but the numbers
and power of their enemies were irresistible. Onward they poured,
shouting like madmen, and clambering up the sides, a scene of
butchery took place that sickens the heart to contemplate.</p>

<p>  [Illustration: "Onward they poured, shouting like madmen."]</p>

<p>Peterson saw the critical moment had arrived, and catching Marian
by the waist, he sprang upon the gunwale, intending to leap over.
But that instant a volley was poured into the boat, and a bullet
struck her. The ranger felt her become a dead weight, at the same
moment that a stream of hot blood poured over his hand. He bent
his head down, and peered into her face. The dark, blue eyes were
slowly shutting, and her head dropped heavily.</p>

<p>"I am dying, Jim," she murmured. "God bless you for your effort.
Give my last love to Russel, mother, and father&mdash;good-by!"</p>

<p>"Heaven bless you!" said the ranger, laying her gently upon the
deck, in spite of the wild scene that had commenced. "You've escaped
that McGable, anyhow."</p>

<p>Peterson again sprang to the gunwale, and, with an almost superhuman
leap, bounded outward in the darkness and disappeared.</p>
