<p>The soldiers stood behind their officer.  None of them had ever seen
Leopold of Lutha--he had been but a name to them--they cared nothing
for him; but in the presence of death they were awed by the majesty
of the king they had never known.
</p>
<p>The hands of Emma von der Tann were chafing the wrists of the man
whose head rested in her lap.
</p><p>"Leopold!" she whispered.  "Leopold, come back!  Mad king you may
have been, but still you were king of Lutha--my father's king--my
king."
</p><p>The girl nearly cried out in shocked astonishment as she saw the
eyes of the dead king open. But Emma von der Tann was quick-witted.
She knew for what purpose the soldiers from the palace were scouring
the country.
</p><p>Had she not thought the king dead she would have cut out her tongue
rather than reveal his identity to these soldiers of his great
enemy. Now she saw that Leopold lived, and she must undo the harm
she had innocently wrought. She bent lower over Barney's face,
trying to hide it from the soldiers.
</p><p>"Go away, please!" she called to them.  "Leave me with my dead king.
You are Peter's men. You do not care for Leopold, living or dead. Go
back to your new king and tell him that this poor young man can
never more stand between him and the throne."
</p><p>The officer hesitated.
</p><p>"We shall have to take the king's body with us, your highness," he
said.
</p><p>The officer evidently becoming suspicious, came closer, and as he
did so Barney Custer sat up.
</p><p>"Go away!" cried the girl, for she saw that the king was attempting
to speak. "My father's people will carry Leopold of Lutha in state
to the capital of his kingdom."
</p><p>"What's all this row about?" he asked.  "Can't you let a dead king
alone if the young lady asks you to? What kind of a short sport are
you, anyway? Run along, now, and tie yourself outside."
</p><p>The officer smiled, a trifle maliciously perhaps.
</p><p>"Ah," he said, "I am very glad indeed that you are not dead, your
majesty."
</p><p>Barney Custer turned his incredulous eyes upon the lieutenant.
</p><p>"Et tu, Brute?" he cried in anguished accents, letting his head fall
back into the girl's lap. He found it very comfortable there indeed.
</p><p>The officer smiled and shook his head.  Then he tapped his forehead
meaningly.
</p><p>"I did not know," he said to the girl, "that he was so bad. But
come--it is some distance to Blentz, and the afternoon is already
well spent. Your highness will accompany us."
</p><p>"I?" cried the girl.  "You certainly cannot be serious."
</p><p>"And why not, your highness?" asked the officer.  "We had strict
orders to arrest not only the king, but any companions who may have
been involved in his escape."
</p><p>"I had nothing whatever to do with his escape," said the girl,
"though I should have been only too glad to have aided him had the
opportunity presented."
</p><p>"King Peter may think differently," replied the man.
</p><p>"The Regent, you mean?" the girl corrected him haughtily.
</p><p>The officer shrugged his shoulders.
</p><p>"Regent or King, he is ruler of Lutha nevertheless, and he would
take away my commission were I to tell him that I had found a Von
der Tann in company with the king and had permitted her to escape.
Your blood convicts your highness."
</p><p>"You are going to take me to Blentz and confine me there?" asked the
girl in a very small voice and with wide incredulous eyes. "You
would not dare thus to humiliate a Von der Tann?"
</p><p>"I am very sorry," said the officer, "but I am a soldier, and
soldiers must obey their superiors. My orders are strict. You may be
thankful," he added, "that it was not Maenck who discovered you."
</p><p>At the mention of the name the girl shuddered.
</p><p>"In so far as it is in my power your highness and his majesty will
be accorded every consideration of dignity and courtesy while under
my escort. You need not entertain any fear of me," he concluded.
</p><p>Barney Custer, during this, to him, remarkable dialogue, had risen
to his feet, and assisted the girl in rising. Now he turned and
spoke to the officer.
</p><p>"This farce," he said, "has gone quite far enough.  If it is a joke
it is becoming a very sorry one. I am not a king. I am an
American--Bernard Custer, of Beatrice, Nebraska, U.S.A. Look at me.
Look at me closely. Do I look like a king?"
</p><p>"Every inch, your majesty," replied the officer.
</p><p>Barney looked at the man aghast.
</p><p>"Well, I am not a king," he said at last, "and if you go to
arresting me and throwing me into one of your musty old dungeons
you will find that I am a whole lot more important than most kings.
I'm an American citizen."
</p><p>"Yes, your majesty," replied the officer, a trifle impatiently. "But
we waste time in idle discussion. Will your majesty be so good as to
accompany me without resistance?"
</p><p>"If you will first escort this young lady to a place of safety,"
replied Barney.
</p><p>"She will be quite safe at Blentz," said the lieutenant.
</p><p>Barney turned to look at the girl, a question in his eyes. Before
them stood the soldiers with drawn revolvers, and now at the summit
of the hill a dozen more appeared in command of a sergeant. They
were two against nearly a score, and Barney Custer was unarmed.
</p><p>The girl shook her head.
</p><p>"There, is no alternative, I am afraid, your majesty," she said.
</p><p>Barney wheeled toward the officer.
</p><p>"Very well, lieutenant," he said, "we will accompany you."
</p><p>The party turned back up the hillside, leaving the dead bandit where
he lay--the fellow's neck had been broken by the fall. A short
distance from where the man had confronted them the two prisoners
were brought to the main road where they saw still other troopers,
and with them the horses of those who had gone into the forest on
foot.
</p><p>Barney and the girl were mounted on two of the animals, the soldiers
who had ridden them clambering up behind two of their comrades. A
moment later the troop set out along the road which leads to Blentz.
</p><p>The prisoners rode near the center of the column, surrounded by
troopers. For a time they were both silent. Barney was wondering if
he had accidentally tumbled into the private grounds of Lutha's
largest madhouse, or if, in reality, these people mistook him for
the young king--it seemed incredible.
</p><p>It had commenced slowly to dawn upon him that perhaps the girl was
not crazy after all. Had not the officer addressed her as "your
highness"? Now that he thought upon it he recalled that she did have
quite a haughty and regal way with her at times, especially so when
she had addressed the officer.
</p><p>Of course she might be mad, after all, and possibly the bandit, too,
but it seemed unbelievable that the officer was mad and his entire
troop of cavalry should be composed of maniacs, yet they all
persisted in speaking and acting as though he were indeed the mad
king of Lutha and the young girl at his side a princess.
</p><p>From pitying the girl he had come to feel a little bit in awe of
her. To the best of his knowledge he had never before associated
with a real princess. When he recalled that he had treated her as he
would an ordinary mortal, and that he had thought her demented, and
had tried to humor her mad whims, he felt very foolish indeed.
</p><p>Presently he turned a sheepish glance in her direction, to find her
looking at him. He saw her flush slightly as his eyes met hers.
</p><p>"Can your highness ever forgive me?" he asked.
</p><p>"Forgive  you!" she cried in astonishment.  "For what, your
majesty?"
</p><p>"For thinking you insane, and for getting you into this horrible
predicament," he replied. "But especially for thinking you insane."
</p><p>"Did you think me mad?" she asked in wide-eyed astonishment.
</p><p>"When you insisted that I was a king, yes," he replied. "But now I
begin to believe that it must be I who am mad, after all, or else I
bear a remarkable resemblance to Leopold of Lutha."
</p><p>"You do, your majesty," replied the girl.
</p><p>Barney saw it was useless to attempt to convince them and so he
decided to give up for the time.
</p><p>"Have me king, if you will," he said, "but please do not call me
'your majesty' any more. It gets on my nerves."
</p><p>"Your will is law--Leopold," replied the girl, hesitating prettily
before the familiar name, "but do not forget your part of the
compact."
</p><p>He smiled at her.  A princess wasn't half so terrible after all.
</p><p>"And your will shall be my law, Emma," he said.
</p><p>It was almost dark when they came to Blentz.  The castle lay far up
on the side of a steep hill above the town. It was an ancient pile,
but had been maintained in an excellent state of repair. As Barney
Custer looked up at the grim towers and mighty, buttressed walls his
heart sank. It had taken the mad king ten years to make his escape
from that gloomy and forbidding pile!
</p><p>"Poor child," he murmured, thinking of the girl.
</p><p>Before the barbican the party was halted by the guard. An officer
with a lantern stepped out upon the lowered portcullis. The
lieutenant who had captured them rode forward to meet him.
</p><p>"A detachment of the Royal Horse Guards escorting His Majesty the
King, who is returning to Blentz," he said in reply to the officer's
sharp challenge.
</p><p>"The king!" exclaimed the officer.  "You have found him?" and he
advanced with raised lantern searching for the monarch.
</p><p>"At last," whispered Barney to the girl at his side, "I shall be
vindicated. This man, at least, who is stationed at Blentz must
know his king by sight."
</p><p>The officer came quite close, holding his lantern until the
rays fell full in Barney's face.  He scrutinized the young man
for a moment.  There was neither humility nor respect in his
manner, so that the American was sure that the fellow had
discovered the imposture.
</p><p>From the bottom of his heart he hoped so.  Then the officer
swung the lantern until its light shone upon the girl.
</p><p>"And who's the wench with him?" he asked the officer who
had found them.
</p><p>The man was standing close beside Barney's horse, and the words were
scarce out of his month when the American slipped from his saddle to
the portcullis and struck the officer full in the face.
</p><p>"She is the Princess von der Tann, you boor," said Barney, "and let
that help you remember it in future."
</p><p>The officer scrambled to his feet, white with rage.  Whipping out
his sword he rushed at Barney.
</p><p>"You shall die for that, you half-wit," he cried.
</p><p>Lieutenant Butzow, he of the Royal Horse, rushed forward to prevent
the assault and Emma von der Tann sprang from her saddle and threw
herself in front of Barney.
</p><p>Butzow grasped the other officer's arm.
</p><p>"Are you mad, Schonau?" he cried.  "Would you kill the king?"
</p><p>The fellow tugged to escape the grasp of Butzow.  He was crazed with
anger.
</p><p>"Why not?" he bellowed.  "You were a fool not to have done it
yourself. Maenck will do it and get a baronetcy. It will mean a
captaincy for me at least. Let me at him--no man can strike Karl
Schonau and live."
</p><p>"The king is unarmed," cried Emma von der Tann.  "Would you murder
him in cold blood?"
</p><p>"He shall not murder him at all, your highness," said Lieutenant
Butzow quietly. "Give me your sword, Lieutenant Schonau. I place you
under arrest. What you have just said will not please the Regent
when it is reported to him. You should keep your head better when
you are angry."
</p><p>"It is the truth," growled Schonau, regretting that his anger had
led him into a disclosure of the plot against the king's life, but
like most weak characters fearing to admit himself in error even
more than he feared the consequences of his rash words.
</p><p>"Do you intend taking my sword?" asked Schonau suddenly, turning
toward Lieutenant Butzow standing beside him.
</p><p>"We will forget the whole occurrence, lieutenant," replied Butzow,
"if you will promise not to harm his majesty, or offer him or the
Princess von der Tann further humiliation. Their position is
sufficiently unpleasant without our adding to the degradation of
it."
</p><p>"Very well," grumbled Schonau.  "Pass on into the courtyard."
</p><p>Barney and the girl remounted and the little cavalcade moved forward
through the ballium and the great gate into the court beyond.
</p><p>"Did you notice," said Barney to the princess, "that even he
believes me to be the king? I cannot fathom it."
</p><p>Within the castle they were met by a number of servants and
soldiers. An officer escorted them to the great hall, and presently
a dark visaged captain of cavalry entered and approached them.
Butzow saluted.
</p><p>"His Majesty, the King," he announced, "has returned to Blentz.  In
accordance with the commands of the Regent I deliver his august
person into your safe keeping, Captain Maenck."
</p><p>Maenck nodded.  He was looking at Barney with evident curiosity.
</p><p>"Where did you find him?" he asked Butzow.
</p><p>He made no pretense of according to Barney the faintest indication
of the respect that is supposed to be due to those of royal blood.
Barney commenced to hope that he had finally come upon one who would
know that he was not king.
</p><p>Butzow recounted the details of the finding of the king.  As he
spoke, Maenck's eyes, restless and furtive, seemed to be appraising
the personal charms of the girl who stood just back of Barney.
</p><p>The American did not like the appearance of the officer, but he saw
that he was evidently supreme at Blentz, and he determined to appeal
to him in the hope that the man might believe his story and untangle
the ridiculous muddle that a chance resemblance to a fugitive
monarch had thrown him and the girl into.
</p><p>"Captain," said Barney, stepping closer to the officer, "there has
been a mistake in identity here. I am not the king. I am an American
traveling for pleasure in Lutha. The fact that I have gray eyes and
wear a full reddish-brown beard is my only offense. You are
doubtless familiar with the king's appearance and so you at least
have already seen that I am not his majesty.
</p><p>"Not being the king, there is no cause to detain me longer, and as I
am not a fugitive and never have been, this young lady has been
guilty of no misdemeanor or crime in being in my company. Therefore
she too should be released. In the name of justice and common
decency I am sure that you will liberate us both at once and furnish
the Princess von der Tann, at least, with a proper escort to her
home."
</p><p>Maenck listened in silence until Barney had finished, a half smile
upon his thick lips.
</p><p>"I am commencing to believe that you are not so crazy as we have all
thought," he said. "Certainly," and he let his eyes rest upon Emma
von der Tann, "you are not mentally deficient in so far as your
judgment of a good-looking woman is concerned. I could not have made
a better selection myself.
</p><p>"As for my familiarity with your appearance, you know as well as I
that I have never seen you before. But that is not necessary--you
conform perfectly to the printed description of you with which the
kingdom is flooded. Were that not enough, the fact that you were
discovered with old Von der Tann's daughter is sufficient to remove
the least doubt as to your identity."
</p><p>"You are governor of Blentz," cried Barney, "and yet you say that
you have never seen the king?"
</p><p>"Certainly," replied Maenck.  "After you escaped the entire
personnel of the garrison here was changed, even the old servants to
a man were withdrawn and others substituted. You will have
difficulty in again escaping, for those who aided you before are no
longer here."
</p><p>"There is no man in the castle of Blentz who has ever seen the
king?" asked Barney.
</p><p>"None who has seen him before tonight," replied Maenck. "But were we
in doubt we have the word of the Princess Emma that you are Leopold.
Did she not admit it to you, Butzow?"
</p><p>"When she thought his majesty dead she admitted it," replied Butzow.
</p><p>"We gain nothing by discussing the matter," said Maenck shortly.
"You are Leopold of Lutha. Prince Peter says that you are mad. All
that concerns me is that you do not escape again, and you may rest
assured that while Ernst Maenck is governor of Blentz you shall not
escape and go at large again.
</p><p>"Are the royal apartments in readiness for his majesty, Dr. Stein?"
he concluded, turning toward a rat-faced little man with bushy
whiskers, who stood just behind him.
</p><p>The query was propounded in an ironical tone, and with a manner that
made no pretense of concealing the contempt of the speaker for the
man he thought the king.
</p><p>The eyes of the Princess Emma were blazing as she caught the scant
respect in Maenck's manner. She looked quickly toward Barney to see
if he intended rebuking the man for his impertinence. She saw that
the king evidently intended overlooking Maenck's attitude. But Emma
von der Tann was of a different mind.
</p><p>She had seen Maenck several times at social functions in the
capital. He had even tried to win a place in her favor, but she had
always disliked him, even before the nasty stories of his past life
had become common gossip, and within the year she had won his hatred
by definitely indicating to him that he was persona non grata, in so
far as she was concerned. Now she turned upon him, her eyes flashing
with indignation.
</p><p>"Do you forget, sir, that you address the king?" she cried. "That
you are without honor I have heard men say, and I may truly believe
it now that I have seen what manner of man you are. The most
lowly-bred boor in all Lutha would not be so ungenerous as to take
advantage of his king's helplessness to heap indignities upon him.
</p><p>"Leopold of Lutha shall come into his own some day, and my dearest
hope is that his first act may be to mete out to such as you the
punishment you deserve."
</p><p>Maenck paled in anger.  His fingers twitched nervously, but he
controlled his temper remarkably well, biding his time for revenge.
</p><p>"Take the king to his apartments, Stein," he commanded curtly, "and
you, Lieutenant Butzow, accompany them with a guard, nor leave until
you see that he is safely confined. You may return here afterward
for my further instructions. In the meantime I wish to examine the
king's mistress."
</p><p>For a moment tense silence reigned in the apartment after Maenck had
delivered his wanton insult.
</p><p>Emma von der Tann, her little chin high in the air, stood straight
and haughty, nor was there any sign in her expression to indicate
that she had heard the man's words.
</p><p>Barney was the first to take cognizance of them.
</p><p>"You cur!" he cried, and took a step toward Maenck. "You're going to
eat that, word for word."
</p><p>Maenck stepped back, his hand upon his sword.  Butzow laid a hand
upon Barney's arm.
</p><p>"Don't, your majesty," he implored, "it will but make your position
more unpleasant, nor will it add to the safety of the Princess von
der Tann for you to strike him now."
</p><p>Barney shook himself free from Butzow, and before either Stein or
the lieutenant could prevent had sprung upon Maenck.
</p><p>The latter had not been quick enough with his sword, so that Barney
had struck him twice, heavily in the face before the officer was
able to draw. Butzow had sprung to the king's side, and was
attempting to interpose himself between Maenck and the American. In
a moment more the sword of the infuriated captain would be in the
king's heart. Barney turned the first thrust with his forearm.
</p><p>"Stop!" cried Butzow to Maenck.  "Are you mad, that you would kill
the king?"
</p><p>Maenck lunged again, viciously, at the unprotected body of his
antagonist.
</p><p>"Die, you pig of an idiot!" he screamed.
</p><p>Butzow saw that the man really meant to murder Leopold. He seized
Barney by the shoulder and whirled him backward. At the same instant
his own sword leaped from his scabbard, and now Maenck found himself
facing grim steel in the hand of a master swordsman.
</p><p>The governor of Blentz drew back from the touch of that sharp point.
</p><p>"What do you mean?" he cried.  "This is mutiny."
</p><p>"When I received my commission," replied Butzow, quietly, "I swore
to protect the person of the king with my life, and while I live no
man shall affront Leopold of Lutha in my presence, or threaten his
safety else he accounts to me for his act. Return your sword,
Captain Maenck, nor ever again draw it against the king while I be
near."
</p><p>Slowly Maenck sheathed his weapon.  Black hatred for Butzow and the
man he was protecting smoldered in his eyes.
</p><p>"If he wishes peace," said Barney, "let him apologize to the
princess."
</p><p>"You had better apologize, captain," counseled Butzow, "for if the
king should command me to do so I should have to compel you to," and
the lieutenant half drew his sword once more.
</p><p>There was something in Butzow's voice that warned Maenck that his
subordinate would like nothing better than the king's command to run
him through.
</p><p>He well knew the fame of Butzow's sword arm, and having no stomach
for an encounter with it he grumbled an apology.
</p><p>"And don't let it occur again," warned Barney.
</p><p>"Come," said Dr. Stein, "your majesty should be in your apartments,
away from all excitement, if we are to effect a cure, so that you
may return to your throne quickly."
</p><p>Butzow formed the soldiers about the American, and the party moved
silently out of the great hall, leaving Captain Maenck and Princess
Emma von der Tann its only occupants.
</p><p>Barney cast a troubled glance toward Maenck, and half hesitated.
</p><p>"I am sorry, your majesty," said Butzow in a low voice, "but you
must accompany us. In this the governor of Blentz is well within his
authority, and I must obey him."
</p><p>"Heaven help her!" murmured Barney.
</p><p>"The governor will not dare harm her," said Butzow. "Your majesty
need entertain no apprehension."
</p><p>"I wouldn't trust him," replied the American.  "I know his kind."
