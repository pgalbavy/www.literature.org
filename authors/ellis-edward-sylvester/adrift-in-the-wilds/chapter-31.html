<p>The camp-fire was kept burning unremittingly until morning, and
the wolverines as unceasingly continued their clamor, so that
none of the parties secured a moment's sleep. The boys were signaled
several times by Shasta to lie down, but they were too unaccustomed
to such sights and sounds to permit them to do so with anything
like peace; so they used their rifles upon the savage animals
until prudence advised them to husband their ammunition until
they had better use for it.</p>

<p>Tim O'Rooney was fully as restless as they. He was in continual
dread that some of the treacherous animals would steal up behind
him and fasten their teeth so securely in him that they could
not be shaken off. This uneasiness caused him ever to be shifting
his position, now on one side the fire, now on the other&mdash;springing
suddenly upward as though he already felt the nip of their fangs.</p>

<p>The Pah Utah, at this time, displayed a grim humor, so exceptional
with his people, as to be almost incredible, except to the boys
who were witnesses to it. Believing such traits should be encouraged
among all aborigines as an antidote for their melancholy dispositions,
it gives us great pleasure to record it, and it will afford us
far greater enjoyment to testify regarding any other such performances
that may come under our notice.</p>

<p>Tim was standing with his back toward the fire, and his hands,
carelessly crossed behind him. He was intently watching the quarrelsome
animals, and all thoughts of attack in the rear had for the time
departed. Shasta leaned silently forward and lifted a small brand
to relight his pipe, which had gone out some time before. As he
was passing it back to the embers the red coal just grazed one
of Tim's fingers, while at the same instant the Indian imitated
the snarl of the wolverine so exactly that the follow was sure
he was seized, and he made the most agile leap of his life.</p>

<p>"Murther! murther! pull him off, Mr. Shasta, catch hold of him!"
exclaimed the affrighted Irishman, springing wildly on every side
of the fire, and striking with blind fierceness at the imaginary
brute in his rear.</p>

<p>Howard and Elwood laughed till the tears rolled down their cheeks.
They had seen Shasta's trick and they could therefore appreciate
it. Never a smile lit up the grim face of the Pah Utah. He continued
leisurely smoking, his keen black eyes looking dreamily into the
fire, as if lost in some pleasant reverie.</p>

<p>But what of that? Who can doubt, that he laughed internally full
as heartily as the youngsters? Who can tell what surges, and waves,
and ripples of laughter went through and through him, until his
whole being was absorbed in merriment?</p>

<p>Finally Tim's terror passed away and he became comparatively
quiet.</p>

<p>"Worrah! worrah!" he exclaimed, panting from his severe exertions.
"What a narra 'scape I had."</p>

<p>"Did he really bite you?"</p>

<p>"Bite me! Didn't ye see him fasten his teeth in me and hang on
till I shuk him off?"</p>

<p>"No; I didn't observe him."</p>

<p>"Git out wid ye nonsense. But I felt him sure and it was meself
that thought once he'd pull me off into the darkness and make
me a prey to the beasts there&mdash;that I did think, did I."</p>

<p>"No danger," remarked Howard, as he and his cousin were unable
to restrain their laughter.</p>

<p>"What be ye spalpeens laughing at?" indignantly demanded the
Irishman.</p>

<p>"But, Tim, are you sure you were not mistaken? We saw nothing
of the kind," pursued Howard.</p>

<p>The fellow looked too full of indignation to speak.</p>

<p>"What is getting into your heads? Ye saam to be losing your sinses
intirely."</p>

<p>"And I can say I saw none of them touch you."</p>

<p>"Then you was blind," was the indignant retort. "Ye harrd him
sing out at me heels, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course, we heard them all the time, as we do now; but the
one you imagined so close may have been a dozen feet distant."</p>

<p>"<em>But he bit me!</em>" was the triumphant reply to this.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"On the hand."</p>

<p>"Let us see the mark!"</p>

<p>The boys arose and walked up to their friend, who bent over the
fire, held his hand close to his face, turning it over and over
and scrutinizing it with the closest attention. Concluding he
was mistaken, he exchanged it for its fellow, which was subjected
to an equally severe cross-examination. Still nothing confirmatory
of his words could be found.</p>

<p>The amazed Irishman now held up both his hands, turning them
over and over and pressing them close to his face.</p>

<p>"Do yees saa anything?" he abruptly asked, thrusting them toward
the boys.</p>

<p>They went through the form of a search for a scratch or a bite,
but declared themselves unable to discover any.</p>

<p>"Don't you feel any pain?" asked Howard.</p>

<p>"I thought I did," replied Tim, with a serious, puzzled look
upon his countenance.</p>

<p>"In what part of your body?"</p>

<p>"Whisht!"</p>

<p>He motioned to them to maintain silence, while he closed his
eyes and waited for some evidence of the pain he had so sharply
felt a few minutes before. As he stood thus, he stealthily brought
each hand around in front of his face and subjected them to the
same examination.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eye sparkled, and he held out his left:</p>

<p>"That's the hand!" he exclaimed exultingly.</p>

<p>"Let's see?" asked the boys, stepping up to him.</p>

<p>"Yees'll find it somewhere there, if yees'll take the throuble
to examine it closely."</p>

<p>They did so, but declared themselves unable to find the wound.</p>

<p>Tim finally showed a small red spot upon one of the fingers,
which he affirmed was where the cruel tooth did bite him.</p>

<p>"That cannot be, for the skin is not broken."</p>

<p>"But it faals as if the same had been bit off."</p>

<p>"It looks more like a burn," added Elwood.</p>

<p>Tim now turned around and looked at the Pah Utah. The latter
was smoking his pipe, as if unconscious of the presence of any
being or animal near him. Perhaps they were mistaken, but Howard
and Elwood always affirmed that they detected a twitching at the
corners of his mouth, as if he were ready to explode with laughter.</p>

<p>But if it was that, it was nothing more, and it manifested itself
in no other manner. Tim gazed fixedly at him a moment, and then
turning to the boys, asked in a whisper:</p>

<p><em>"But didn't ye hear it snarrl at meself?"</em></p>
