<P>
THERE was a pause.
<P>
The moments passed--and not one of the three moved. The moments
passed--and not one of the three spoke. Insensibly the words of
supplication died away on Julian's lips. Even his energy failed
to sustain him, tried as it now was by the crushing oppression of
suspense. The first trifling movement which suggested the idea of
change, and which so brought with it the first vague sense of
relief, came from Mercy. Incapable of sustaining the prolonged
effort of standing, she drew back a little and took a chair. No
outward manifestation of emotion escaped her. There she sat--with
the death-like torpor of resignation in her face--waiting her
sentence in silence from the man at whom she had hurled the whole
terrible confession of the truth in one sentence!
<P>
Julian lifted his head as she moved. He looked at Horace. and
advancing a few steps, looked again. There was fear in his face,
as he suddenly turned it toward Mercy.
<P>
"Speak to him!" he said, in a whisper. "Rouse him, before it's
too late!"
<P>
She moved mechanically in her chair; she looked mechanically at
Julian.
<P>
"What more have I to say to him?" she asked, in faint, weary
tones. "Did I not tell him everything when I told him my name?"
<P>
The natural sound of her voice might have failed to affect
Horace. The altered sound of it roused him. He approached Mercy's
chair, with a dull surprise in his face, and put his hand, in a
weak, wavering way, on her shoulder. In that position he stood
for a while, looking down at her in silence.
<P>
The one idea in him that found its way outward to expression was
the idea of Julian. Without moving his hand, without looking up
from Mercy, he spoke for the first time since the shock had
fallen on him.
<P>
"Where is Julian?" he asked, very quietly.
<P>
"I am here, Horace--close by you."
<P>
"Will you do me a service?"
<P>
"Certainly. How can I help you?"
<P>
He considered a little before he replied. His hand left Mercy's
shoulder, and went up to his head--then dropped at his side. His
next words were spoken in a sadly helpless, bewildered way.
<P>
"I have an idea, Julian, that I have been somehow to blame. I
said some hard words to you. It was a little while since. I don't
clearly remember what it was all about. My temper has been a good
deal tried in this house; I have never been used to the sort of
thing that goes on here--secrets and mysteries, and hateful
low-lived quarrels. We have no secrets and mysteries at home. And
as for quarrels-- ridiculous! My mother and my sisters are highly
bred women (you know them); gentlewomen, in the best sense of the
word. When I am with _them_ I have no anxieties. I am not
harassed at home by doubts of who people are, and confusion about
names, and so on. I suspect the contrast weighs a little on my
mind and upsets it. They make me over-suspicious among them here,
and it ends in my feeling doubts and fears that I can't get over:
doubts about you and fears about myself. I have got a fear about
myself now. I want you to help me. Shall I make an apology
first?"
<P>
"Don't say a word. Tell me what I can do."
<P>
He turned his face toward Julian for the first time.
<P>
"Just look at me," he said. "Does it strike you that I am at all
wrong in my mind? Tell me the truth, old fellow."
<P>
"Your nerves are a little shaken, Horace. Nothing more."
<P>
He considered again after that reply, his eyes remaining
anxiously fixed on Julian's face.
<P>
"My nerves are a little shaken," he repeated. "That is true; I
feel they are shaken. I should like, if you don't mind, to make
sure that it's no worse. Will you help me to try if my memory is
all right?"
<P>
"I will do anything you like."
<P>
"Ah! you are a good fellow, Julian--and a clear-headed fellow
too, which is very important just now. Look here! I say it's
about a week since the troubles began in this house. Do you say
so too?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"The troubles came in with the coming of a woman from Germany, a
stranger to us, who behaved very violently in the dining-room
there. Am I right, so far?"
<P>
"Quite right."
<P>
"The woman carried matters with a high hand. She claimed Colonel
Roseberry--I wish to be strictly accurate--she claimed _the late_
Colonel Roseberry as her father. She told a tiresome story about
her having been robbed of her papers and her name by an impostor
who had personated her. She said the name of the impostor was
Mercy Merrick. And she afterward put the climax to it all: she
pointed to the lady who is engaged to be my wife, and declared
that _she_ was Mercy Merrick. Tell me again, is that right or
wrong?"
<P>
Julian answered him as before. He went on, speaking more
confidently and more excitedly than he had spoken yet.
<P>
"Now attend to this, Julian. I am going to pass from my memory of
what happened a week ago to my memory of what happened five
minutes since. You were present; I want to know if you heard it
too." He paused, and, without taking his eyes off Julian, pointed
backward to Mercy. "There is the lady who is engaged to marry
me," he resumed. "Did I, or did I not, hear her say that she had
come out of a Refuge, and that she was going back to a Refuge?
Did I, or did I not, hear her own to my face that her name was
Mercy Merrick? Answer me, Julian. My good friend, answer me, for
the sake of old times."
<P>
His voice faltered as he spoke those imploring words. Under the
dull blank of his face there appeared the first signs of emotion
slowly forcing its way outward. The stunned mind was reviving
faintly. Julian saw his opportunity of aiding the recovery, and
seized it. He took Horace gently by the arm, and pointed to
Mercy.
<P>
"There is your answer!" he said. "Look!-- and pity her."
<P>
She had not once interrupted them while they had been speaking:
she had changed her position again, and that was all. There was a
writing-table at the side of her chair; her outstretched arms
rested on it. Her head had dropped on her arms, and her face was
hidden. Julian's judgment had not misled him; the utter
self-abandonment of her attitude answered Horace as no human
language could have answered him. He looked at her. A quick spasm
of pain passed across his face. He turned once more to the
faithful friend who had forgiven him. His head fell on Julian's
shoulder, and he burst into tears.
<P>
Mercy started wildly to her feet, and looked at the two men.
<P>
"O God" she cried, "what have I done!"
<P>
Julian quieted her by a motion of his hand.
<P>
"You have helped me to save him,'' he said. "Let his tears have
their way. Wait."
<P>
He put one arm round Horace to support him. The manly tenderness
of the action, the complete and noble pardon of past injuries
which it implied, touched Mercy to the heart. She went back to
her chair. Again shame and sorrow overpowered her, and again she
hid her face from view.
<P>
Julian led Horace to a seat, and silently waited by him until he
had recovered his self-control. He gratefully took the kind hand
that had sustained him: he said, simply, almost boyishly, "Thank
you, Julian. I am better now."
<P>
"Are you composed enough to listen to what is said to you?"
Julian asked.
<P>
"Yes. Do _you_ wish to speak to me?"
<P>
Julian left him without immediately replying, and returned to
Mercy.
<P>
"The time has come," he said. "Tell him all--truly, unreservedly,
as you would tell it to me."
<P>
She shuddered as he spoke. "Have I not told him enough?" she
asked. "Do you want me to break his heart? Look at him! Look what
I have done already!"
<P>
Horace shrank from the ordeal as Mercy shrank from it.
<P>
"No, no! I can't listen to it! I daren't listen to it!" he cried,
and rose to leave the room.
<P>
Julian had taken the good work in hand: he never faltered over it
for an instant. Horace had loved her--how dearly Julian now knew
for the first time. The bare possibility that she might earn her
pardon if she was allowed to plead her own cause was a
possibility still left. To let her win on Horace to forgive her,
was death to the love that still filled his heart in secret. But
he never hesitated. With a resolution which the weaker man was
powerless to resist, he took him by the arm and led him back to
his place.
<P>
"For her sake, and for your sake, you shall not condemn her
unheard," he said to Horace, firmly. "One temptation to deceive
you after another has tried her, and she has resisted them all.
With no discovery to fear, with a letter from the benefactress
who loves her commanding her to be silent, with everything that a
woman values in this world to lose, if she owns what she has
done--_this_ woman, for the truth's sake, has spoken the truth.
Does she deserve nothing at your hands in return for that?
Respect her, Horace--and hear her."
<P>
Horace yielded. Julian turned to Mercy.
<P>
"You have allowed me to guide you so far," he said. "Will you
allow me to guide you still?"
<P>
Her eyes sank before his; her bosom rose and fell rapidly. His
influence over her maintained its sway. She bowed her head in
speechless submission.
<P>
"Tell him,'' Julian proceeded, in accents of entreaty, not of
command--"tell him what your life has been. Tell him how you were
tried and tempted, with no friend near to speak the words which
might have saved you. And then," he added, raising her from the
chair, "let him judge you--if he can!"
<P>
He attempted to lead her across the room to the place which
Horace occupied. But her submission had its limits. Half-way to
the place she stopped, and refused to go further. Julian offered
her a chair. She declined to take it. Standing with one hand on
the back of the chair, she waited for the word from Horace which
would permit her to speak. She was resigned to the ordeal. Her
face was calm; her mind was clear. The hardest of all
humiliations to endure--the humiliation of acknowledging her
name--she had passed through. Nothing remained but to show her
gratitude to Julian by acceding to his wishes, and to ask pardon
of Horace before they parted forever. In a little while the
Matron would arrive at the house-- and then it would be over.
<P>
Unwillingly Horace looked at her. Their eyes met. He broke out
suddenly with something of his former violence.
<P>
"I can't realize it even now!" he cried. "_Is_ it true that you
are not Grace Roseberry? Don't look at me! Say in one word--Yes
or No!"
<P>
She answered him, humbly and sadly, "Yes."
<P>
"You have done what that woman accused you of doing? Am I to
believe that?"
<P>
"You are to believe it, sir."
<P>
All the weakness of Horace's character disclosed itself when she
made that reply.
<P>
"Infamous!" he exclaimed. "What excuse can you make for the cruel
deception you have practiced on me? Too bad! too bad! There can
be no excuse for you!"
<P>
She accepted his reproaches with unshaken resignation. "I have
deserved it!" was all she said to herself, "I have deserved it!"
<P>
Julian interposed once more in Mercy's defense.
<P>
"Wait till you are sure there is no excuse for her, Horace," he
said, quietly. "Grant her justice, if you can grant no more. I
leave you together."
<P>
He advanced toward the door of the dining-room. Horace's weakness
disclosed itself once more.
<P>
"Don't leave me alone with her!" he burst out. "The misery of it
is more than I can bear!"
<P>
Julian looked at Mercy. Her face brightened faintly. That
momentary expression of relief told him how truly he would be
befriending her if he consented to remain in the room. A position
of retirement was offered to him by a recess formed by the
central bay-window of the library. If he occupied this place,
they could see or not see that he was present, as their own
inclinations might decide them.
<P>
"I will stay with you, Horace, as long as you wish me to be
here." Having answered in those terms, he stopped as he passed
Mercy, on his way to the window. His quick and kindly insight
told him that he might still be of some service to her. A hint
from hi m might show her the shortest and the easiest way of
making her confession. Delicately and briefly he gave her the
hint. "The first time I met you," he said, "I saw that your life
had had its troubles. Let us hear how those troubles began."
<P>
He withdrew to his place in the recess. For the first time, since
the fatal evening when she and Grace Roseberry had met in the
French cottage, Mercy Merrick looked back into the purgatory on
earth of her past life, and told her sad story simply and truly
in these words.
