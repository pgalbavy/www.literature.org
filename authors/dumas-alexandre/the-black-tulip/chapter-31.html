<P>Haarlem, whither, three days ago, we conducted our gentle 
reader, and whither we request him to follow us once more in 
the footsteps of the prisoner, is a pleasant city, which 
justly prides itself on being one of the most shady in all 
the Netherlands.</P>
<P>While other towns boast of the magnificence of their 
arsenals and dock-yards, and the splendour of their shops 
and markets, Haarlem's claims to fame rest upon her 
superiority to all other provincial cities in the number and 
beauty of her spreading elms, graceful poplars, and, more 
than all, upon her pleasant walks, shaded by the lovely 
arches of magnificent oaks, lindens, and chestnuts.</P>
<P>Haarlem,  -  just as her neighbour, Leyden, became the centre 
of science, and her queen, Amsterdam, that of commerce,  -  
Haarlem preferred to be the agricultural, or, more strictly 
speaking, the horticultural metropolis.</P>
<P>In fact, girt about as she was, breezy and exposed to the 
sun's hot rays, she seemed to offer to gardeners so many 
more guarantees of success than other places, with their 
heavy sea air, and their scorching heat.</P>
<P>On this account all the serene souls who loved the earth and 
its fruits had gradually gathered together at Haarlem, just 
as all the nervous, uneasy spirits, whose ambition was for 
travel and commerce, had settled in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, 
and all the politicians and selfish worldlings at the Hague.</P>
<P>We have observed that Leyden overflowed with scholars. In 
like manner Haarlem was devoted to the gentle pursuits of 
peace,  -  to music and painting, orchards and avenues, 
groves and parks. Haarlem went wild about flowers, and 
tulips received their full share of worship.</P>
<P>Haarlem offered prizes for tulip-growing; and this fact 
brings us in the most natural manner to that celebration 
which the city intended to hold on May 15th, 1673 in honour 
of the great black tulip, immaculate and perfect, which 
should gain for its discoverer one hundred thousand 
guilders!</P>
<P>Haarlem, having placed on exhibition its favourite, having 
advertised its love of flowers in general and of tulips in 
particular, at a period when the souls of men were filled 
with war and sedition,  -  Haarlem, having enjoyed the 
exquisite pleasure of admiring the very purest ideal of 
tulips in full bloom,  -  Haarlem, this tiny town, full of 
trees and of sunshine, of light and shade, had determined 
that the ceremony of bestowing the prize should be a fete 
which should live for ever in the memory of men.</P>
<P>So much the more reason was there, too, in her 
determination, in that Holland is the home of fetes; never 
did sluggish natures manifest more eager energy of the 
singing and dancing sort than those of the good republicans 
of the Seven Provinces when amusement was the order of the 
day.</P>
<P>Study the pictures of the two Teniers.</P>
<P>It is certain that sluggish folk are of all men the most 
earnest in tiring themselves, not when they are at work, but 
at play.</P>
<P>Thus Haarlem was thrice given over to rejoicing, for a 
three-fold celebration was to take place.</P>
<P>In the first place, the black tulip had been produced; 
secondly, the Prince William of Orange, as a true Hollander, 
had promised to be present at the ceremony of its 
inauguration; and, thirdly, it was a point of honour with 
the States to show to the French, at the conclusion of such 
a disastrous war as that of 1672, that the flooring of the 
Batavian Republic was solid enough for its people to dance 
on it, with the accompaniment of the cannon of their fleets.</P>
<P>The Horticultural Society of Haarlem had shown itself worthy 
of its fame by giving a hundred thousand guilders for the 
bulb of a tulip. The town, which did not wish to be outdone, 
voted a like sum, which was placed in the hands of that 
notable body to solemnise the auspicious event.</P>
<P>And indeed on the Sunday fixed for this ceremony there was 
such a stir among the people, and such an enthusiasm among 
the townsfolk, that even a Frenchman, who laughs at 
everything at all times, could not have helped admiring the 
character of those honest Hollanders, who were equally ready 
to spend their money for the construction of a man-of-war  -  
that is to say, for the support of national honour  -  as 
they were to reward the growth of a new flower, destined to 
bloom for one day, and to serve during that day to divert 
the ladies, the learned, and the curious.</P>
<P>At the head of the notables and of the Horticultural 
Committee shone Mynheer van Systens, dressed in his richest 
habiliments.</P>
<P>The worthy man had done his best to imitate his favourite 
flower in the sombre and stern elegance of his garments; and 
we are bound to record, to his honour, that he had perfectly 
succeeded in his object.</P>
<P>Dark crimson velvet, dark purple silk, and jet-black cloth, 
with linen of dazzling whiteness, composed the festive dress 
of the President, who marched at the head of his Committee 
carrying an enormous nosegay, like that which a hundred and 
twenty-one years later, Monsieur de Robespierre displayed at 
the festival of &quot;The Supreme Being.&quot;</P>
<P>There was, however, a little difference between the two; 
very different from the French tribune, whose heart was so 
full of hatred and ambitious vindictiveness, was the honest 
President, who carried in his bosom a heart as innocent as 
the flowers which he held in his hand.</P>
<P>Behind the Committee, who were as gay as a meadow, and as 
fragrant as a garden in spring, marched the learned 
societies of the town, the magistrates, the military, the 
nobles and the boors.</P>
<P>The people, even among the respected republicans of the 
Seven Provinces, had no place assigned to them in the 
procession; they merely lined the streets.</P>
<P>This is the place for the multitude, which with true 
philosophic spirit, waits until the triumphal pageants have 
passed, to know what to say of them, and sometimes also to 
know what to do.</P>
<P>This time, however, there was no question either of the 
triumph of Pompey or of Caesar; neither of the defeat of 
Mithridates, nor of the conquest of Gaul. The procession was 
as placid as the passing of a flock of lambs, and as 
inoffensive as a flight of birds sweeping through the air.</P>
<P>Haarlem had no other triumphers, except its gardeners. 
Worshipping flowers, Haarlem idolised the florist.</P>
<P>In the centre of this pacific and fragrant cortege the black 
tulip was seen, carried on a litter, which was covered with 
white velvet and fringed with gold.</P>
<P>The handles of the litter were supported by four men, who 
were from time to time relieved by fresh relays,  -  even as 
the bearers of Mother Cybele used to take turn and turn 
about at Rome in the ancient days, when she was brought from 
Etruria to the Eternal City, amid the blare of trumpets and 
the worship of a whole nation.</P>
<P>This public exhibition of the tulip was an act of adoration 
rendered by an entire nation, unlettered and unrefined, to 
the refinement and culture of its illustrious and devout 
leaders, whose blood had stained the foul pavement of the 
Buytenhof, reserving the right at a future day to inscribe 
the names of its victims upon the highest stone of the Dutch 
Pantheon.</P>
<P>It was arranged that the Prince Stadtholder himself should 
give the prize of a hundred thousand guilders, which 
interested the people at large, and it was thought that 
perhaps he would make a speech which interested more 
particularly his friends and enemies.</P>
<P>For in the most insignificant words of men of political 
importance their friends and their opponents always 
endeavour to detect, and hence think they can interpret, 
something of their true thoughts.</P>
<P>As if your true politician's hat were not a bushel under 
which he always hides his light!</P>
<P>At length the great and long-expected day  -  May 15, 1673  -  
arrived; and all Haarlem, swelled by her neighbours, was 
gathered in the beautiful tree-lined streets, determined on 
this occasion not to waste its applause upon military 
heroes, or those who had won notable victories in the field 
of science, but to reserve their applause for those who had 
overcome Nature, and had forced the inexhaustible mother to 
be delivered of what had theretofore been regarded as 
impossible,  -  a completely black tulip.</P>
<P>Nothing however, is more fickle than such a resolution of 
the people. When a crowd is once in the humour to cheer, it 
is just the same as when it begins to hiss. It never knows 
when to stop.</P>
<P>It therefore, in the first place, cheered Van Systens and 
his nosegay, then the corporation, then followed a cheer for 
the people; and, at last, and for once with great justice, 
there was one for the excellent music with which the 
gentlemen of the town councils generously treated the 
assemblage at every halt.</P>
<P>Every eye was looking eagerly for the heroine of the 
festival,  -  that is to say, the black tulip,  -  and for its 
hero in the person of the one who had grown it.</P>
<P>In case this hero should make his appearance after the 
address we have seen worthy Van Systens at work on so 
conscientiously, he would not fail to make as much of a 
sensation as the Stadtholder himself.</P>
<P>But the interest of the day's proceedings for us is centred 
neither in the learned discourse of our friend Van Systens, 
however eloquent it might be, nor in the young dandies, 
resplendent in their Sunday clothes, and munching their 
heavy cakes; nor in the poor young peasants, gnawing smoked 
eels as if they were sticks of vanilla sweetmeat; neither is 
our interest in the lovely Dutch girls, with red cheeks and 
ivory bosoms; nor in the fat, round mynheers, who had never 
left their homes before; nor in the sallow, thin travellers 
from Ceylon or Java; nor in the thirsty crowds, who quenched 
their thirst with pickled cucumbers;  -  no, so far as we are 
concerned, the real interest of the situation, the 
fascinating, dramatic interest, is not to be found here.</P>
<P>Our interest is in a smiling, sparkling face to be seen amid 
the members of the Horticultural Committee; in the person 
with a flower in his belt, combed and brushed, and all clad 
in scarlet,  -  a colour which makes his black hair and 
yellow skin stand out in violent contrast.</P>
<P>This hero, radiant with rapturous joy, who had the 
distinguished honour of making the people forget the speech 
of Van Systens, and even the presence of the Stadtholder, 
was Isaac Boxtel, who saw, carried on his right before him, 
the black tulip, his pretended daughter; and on his left, in 
a large purse, the hundred thousand guilders in glittering 
gold pieces, towards which he was constantly squinting, 
fearful of losing sight of them for one moment.</P>
<P>Now and then Boxtel quickened his step to rub elbows for a 
moment with Van Systens. He borrowed a little importance 
from everybody to make a kind of false importance for 
himself, as he had stolen Rosa's tulip to effect his own 
glory, and thereby make his fortune.</P>
<P>Another quarter of an hour and the Prince will arrive and 
the procession will halt for the last time; after the tulip 
is placed on its throne, the Prince, yielding precedence to 
this rival for the popular adoration, will take a 
magnificently emblazoned parchment, on which is written the 
name of the grower; and his Highness, in a loud and audible 
tone, will proclaim him to be the discoverer of a wonder; 
that Holland, by the instrumentality of him, Boxtel, has 
forced Nature to produce a black flower, which shall 
henceforth be called Tulipa nigra Boxtellea.</P>
<P>From time to time, however, Boxtel withdrew his eyes for a 
moment from the tulip and the purse, timidly looking among 
the crowd, for more than anything he dreaded to descry there 
the pale face of the pretty Frisian girl.</P>
<P>She would have been a spectre spoiling the joy of the 
festival for him, just as Banquo's ghost did that of 
Macbeth.</P>
<P>And yet, if the truth must be told, this wretch, who had 
stolen what was the boast of man, and the dowry of a woman, 
did not consider himself as a thief. He had so intently 
watched this tulip, followed it so eagerly from the drawer 
in Cornelius's dry-room to the scaffold of the Buytenhof, 
and from the scaffold to the fortress of Loewestein; he had 
seen it bud and grow in Rosa's window, and so often warmed 
the air round it with his breath, that he felt as if no one 
had a better right to call himself its producer than he had; 
and any one who would now take the black tulip from him 
would have appeared to him as a thief.</P>
<P>Yet he did not perceive Rosa; his joy therefore was not 
spoiled.</P>
<P>In the centre of a circle of magnificent trees, which were 
decorated with garlands and inscriptions, the procession 
halted, amidst the sounds of lively music, and the young 
damsels of Haarlem made their appearance to escort the tulip 
to the raised seat which it was to occupy on the platform, 
by the side of the gilded chair of his Highness the 
Stadtholder.</P>
<P>And the proud tulip, raised on its pedestal, soon overlooked 
the assembled crowd of people, who clapped their hands, and 
made the old town of Haarlem re-echo with their tremendous 
cheers. </P></article>
