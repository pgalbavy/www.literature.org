<p>Glancing over his shoulder, Nick Ribsam kept informed of the
movements of his fierce foe, who was certainly carrying things
with a hurricane rush.</p>

<p>Finding there was no getting away from him, Nick, just as he
reached the fallen tree, whirled around and, grasping his rifle
by the barrel, swung the stock back over his shoulder and poised
himself for the blow, which he believed must decide his own fate.</p>

<p>The boy made a formidable-looking picture; but it was all lost
on the buck, which did not halt nor slacken his pace.</p>

<p>It was a terrifying sight as he plunged toward the lad with lowered
head and glowering front, for the deer was an exceptionally large
and powerful one, and he meant to kill the individual that had
sent the bullet into his side, and from which the red blood was
already streaming.</p>

<p>It may be said just here, that Nick Ribsam no longer doubted
the failure of the long-range shot of Herbert Watrous.</p>

<p>The imperiled lad drew a deep respiration, poised himself on
his advanced foot, and, swinging to one side, with a view of avoiding
the full force of the charge, he brought down the stock of his
gun with the utmost strength he could command.</p>

<p>It descended with great power&mdash;so far as a ten-year-old boy is
concerned&mdash;but it was not sufficient to throw the buck off his
base nor to interfere with his plan of procedure.</p>

<p>He struck the lad with tremendous force, sending the gun flying
from his grasp and knocking Nick fully a dozen feet. Never in
all his life had the boy received such a terrific shock, which
drove the breath from his body and sent him spinning, as it seemed,
through twenty yards of space.</p>

<p>Poor Nick believed half his bones were broken and that he was
mortally hurt; but the result of the charge was most extraordinary.</p>

<p>As the antlers of the buck struck him he was thrown like a limp
dummy toward the fallen tree, and, in reality, his greatest peril
was therefrom. Had he been driven with full momentum against the
solid trunk, he would have been killed as if smitten by a lightning
stroke.</p>

<p>But his feet were entangled in some way and he fell headlong,
his forehead within a few inches of the bark, and his head itself
was driven under the trunk, which at that point was perhaps a
foot above the ground.</p>

<p>Instinctively the nearly senseless lad did the only thing that
could save him. He crawled under the trunk, so that it stood like
a roof over him.</p>

<p>His head was toward the base, and he pushed along until the lessening
space would not permit him to go further.</p>

<p>Thus he lay parallel with the uprooted tree, his feet at a point
where the bark almost touched his heels, the space growing less
and less toward his shoulders, until the back of his head rested
against the shaggy bark and his nose touched the leaves.</p>

<p>He had scarcely done this when he heard a thud at his elbow:
it was made by the knife-like hoofs of the buck, who, rearing
on his hind legs, gathered his two front ones close together and
brought them down with such force that, had they fallen on the
body of the lad, as was intended, they would have cut into him
like the edge of a powerfully driven ax.</p>

<p>As it was, the shielding tree trunk prevented it, and, grazing
the bark, they were driven into the yielding earth half a foot
deep.</p>

<p>The buck immediately reared and repeated the terrible blow several
times, missing the body of the lad by what may be called a hair's
breadth.</p>

<p>The animal was in a fury, and, believing his foe was at his mercy,
he showed him none.</p>

<p>Nick heard the first thump of the sharp hoofs as they cut their
way into the earth, and then his head seemed to spin, as though
he had been whirled around with inconceivable velocity; innumerable
stars danced before his eyes, he felt as if shooting through space,
and then consciousness left him.</p>

<p>The buck could know nothing of this, and, had he known it, his
actions would not have been affected. He continued his rearing
and plunging until he saw he was inflicting no injury. Then he
stopped, backed off several paces, and, lowering his head, tried
to dislodge the lad from his place of refuge.</p>

<p>But the breadth of his antlers prevented success, which would
have placed Nick just where he could finish him. The oak barred
his progress, stopping the head and horns when they were almost
against the body.</p>

<p>Then the buck reared and struck again, trying all manner of maneuvers
which his instinct suggested, but providentially none of them
succeeded.</p>

<p>All this time Nick Ribsam, who had been so badly bruised, was
oblivious of the efforts against his life. Had he possessed his
faculties, he could not have done anything more for his protection
than he did, by lying motionless, extended along and below the
trunk of the oak.</p>

<p>But the lusty, rugged nature of the lad soon asserted itself,
and he began rallying from the shock. A reaction gradually set
in, and slowly his senses returned.</p>

<p>It was a considerable time, however, before he realized where
he was and what had befallen him. His head was still ringing,
as though the clangor of a hundred anvils were sounding in his
ears, and, when he drew a deep breath, a pain, as if made by a
knife, was in his side.</p>

<p>He listened, but heard nothing of his enemy. Then, with a great
labor and more suffering, he pushed himself a few inches backward,
so as to give some freedom to his body and to enable him to move
his head.</p>

<p>Turning his face, he peered out on his right: the buck was not
visible in that direction.</p>

<p>Then he did the same toward the left: his enemy was invisible
on that side also.</p>

<p>"He is gone," said the lad to himself, still afraid to venture
from the shielding trunk that had been the means of saving him
from the fury of the enraged deer.</p>

<p>Nick believed he was close at hand, waiting for him to make a
move that would give another chance to assault him.</p>

<p>After several more minutes, the lad hitched farther backward,
so that he was able to raise his head a few inches. This extended
his field of observation, and, with a feeling of inexpressible
relief, he still failed to catch sight of the game.</p>

<p>"I guess he got discouraged and left," said Nick, startled at
the evidences of the buck's wrath so near him.</p>

<p>Finally the lad backed clear out from under the tree, and climbed
to his feet; it was climbing in every sense, for he nearly cried
with pain several times, and, still fearful that he had been seriously
injured, he examined himself as best he could.</p>

<p>A few minutes convinced him that none of his bones was broken,
although he afterward declared that he suspected his head had
been fractured.</p>

<p>He now looked about for his gun and found it within a short distance,
much scratched by the hard treatment it had received, but without
any real injury.</p>

<p>Throwing the weapon over his shoulder, he started in the direction
of the appointed rendezvous, and, as he did so, observed that
it was already grown dark in the woods. Night had come, and he
had quite a long distance to walk.</p>
