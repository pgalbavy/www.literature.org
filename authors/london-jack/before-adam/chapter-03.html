<P>
The commonest dream of my early childhood was something
like this: It seemed that I was very small and that I
lay curled up in a sort of nest of twigs and boughs.
Sometimes I was lying on my back. In this position it
seemed that I spent many hours, watching the play of
sunlight on the foliage and the stirring of the leaves
by the wind.  Often the nest itself moved back and
forth when the wind was strong.
<P>
But always, while so lying in the nest, I was mastered
as of tremendous space beneath me.  I never saw it, I
never peered over the edge of the nest to see; but I
KNEW and feared that space that lurked just beneath me
and that ever threatened me like a maw of some
all-devouring monster.
<P>
This dream, in which I was quiescent and which was more
like a condition than an experience of action, I
dreamed very often in my early childhood.  But
suddenly, there would rush into the very midst of it
strange forms and ferocious happenings, the thunder and
crashing of storm, or unfamiliar landscapes such as in
my wake-a-day life I had never seen.  The result was
confusion and nightmare.  I could comprehend nothing of
it.  There was no logic of sequence.
<P>
You see, I did not dream consecutively.  One moment I
was a wee babe of the Younger World lying in my tree
nest; the next moment I was a grown man of the Younger
World locked in combat with the hideous Red-Eye; and
the next moment I was creeping carefully down to the
water-hole in the heat of the day.  Events, years apart
in their occurrence in the Younger World, occurred with
me within the space of several minutes, or seconds.
<P>
It was all a jumble, but this jumble I shall not
inflict upon you. It was not until I was a young man
and had dreamed many thousand times, that everything
straightened out and became clear and plain.  Then it
was that I got the clew of time, and was able to piece
together events and actions in their proper order.
Thus was I able to reconstruct the vanished Younger
World as it was at the time I lived in it--or at the
time my other-self lived in it.  The distinction does
not matter; for I, too, the modern man, have gone back
and lived that early life in the company of my
other-self.
<P>
For your convenience, since this is to be no
sociological screed, I shall frame together the
different events into a comprehensive story.  For there
is a certain thread of continuity and happening that
runs through all the dreams.  There is my friendship
with Lop-Ear, for instance.  Also, there is the enmity
of Red-Eye, and the love of the Swift One.  Taking it
all in all, a fairly coherent and interesting story I
am sure you will agree.
<P>
I do not remember much of my mother.  Possibly the
earliest recollection I have of her--and certainly the
sharpest--is the following: It seemed I was lying on
the ground.  I was somewhat older than during the nest
days, but still helpless.  I rolled about in the dry
leaves, playing with them and making crooning, rasping
noises in my throat.  The sun shone warmly and I was
happy, and comfortable.  I was in a little open space.
Around me, on all sides, were bushes and fern-like
growths, and overhead and all about were the trunks and
branches of forest trees.
<P>
Suddenly I heard a sound.  I sat upright and listened.
I made no movement.  The little noises died down in my
throat, and I sat as one petrified.  The sound drew
closer.  It was like the grunt of a pig.  Then I began
to hear the sounds caused by the moving of a body
through the brush.  Next I saw the ferns agitated by
the passage of the body.  Then the ferns parted, and I
saw gleaming eyes, a long snout, and white tusks.
<P>
It was a wild boar.  He peered at me curiously.  He
grunted once or twice and shifted his weight from one
foreleg to the other, at the same time moving his head
from side to side and swaying the ferns.  Still I sat
as one petrified, my eyes unblinking as I stared at
him, fear eating at my heart.
<P>
It seemed that this movelessness and silence on my part
was what was expected of me.  I was not to cry out in
the face of fear.  It was a dictate of instinct.  And
so I sat there and waited for I knew not what.  The
boar thrust the ferns aside and stepped into the open.
The curiosity went out of his eyes, and they gleamed
cruelly.  He tossed his head at me threateningly and
advanced a step.  This he did again, and yet again.
<P>
Then I screamed...or shrieked--I cannot describe it,
but it was a shrill and terrible cry.  And it seems
that it, too, at this stage of the proceedings, was the
thing expected of me.  From not far away came an
answering cry.  My sounds seemed momentarily to
disconcert the boar, and while he halted and shifted
his weight with indecision, an apparition burst upon
us.
<P>
She was like a large orangutan, my mother, or like a
chimpanzee, and yet, in sharp and definite ways, quite
different.  She was heavier of build than they, and had
less hair.  Her arms were not so long, and her legs
were stouter.  She wore no clothes--only her natural
hair.  And I can tell you she was a fury when she was
excited.
<P>
And like a fury she dashed upon the scene.  She was
gritting her teeth, making frightful grimaces,
snarling, uttering sharp and continuous cries that
sounded like "kh-ah! kh-ah!" So sudden and formidable
was her appearance that the boar involuntarily bunched
himself together on the defensive and bristled as she
swerved toward him.  Then she swerved toward me.  She
had quite taken the breath out of him.  I knew just
what to do in that moment of time she had gained.  I
leaped to meet her, catching her about the waist and
holding on hand and foot--yes, by my feet; I could hold
on by them as readily as by my hands.  I could feel in
my tense grip the pull of the hair as her skin and her
muscles moved beneath with her efforts.
<P>
As I say, I leaped to meet her, and on the instant she
leaped straight up into the air, catching an
overhanging branch with her hands.  The next instant,
with clashing tusks, the boar drove past underneath.
He had recovered from his surprise and sprung forward,
emitting a squeal that was almost a trumpeting.  At any
rate it was a call, for it was followed by the rushing
of bodies through the ferns and brush from all
directions.
<P>
From every side wild hogs dashed into the open space--a
score of them.  But my mother swung over the top of a
thick limb, a dozen feet from the ground, and, still
holding on to her, we perched there in safety.  She was
very excited.  She chattered and screamed, and scolded
down at the bristling, tooth-gnashing circle that had
gathered beneath.  I, too, trembling, peered down at
the angry beasts and did my best to imitate my mother's
cries.
<P>
From the distance came similar cries, only pitched
deeper, into a sort of roaring bass.  These grew
momentarily louder, and soon I saw him approaching, my
father--at least, by all the evidence of the times, I
am driven to conclude that he was my father.
<P>
He was not an extremely prepossessing father, as
fathers go.  He seemed half man, and half ape, and yet
not ape, and not yet man. I fail to describe him.
There is nothing like him to-day on the earth, under
the earth, nor in the earth.  He was a large man in his
day, and he must have weighed all of a hundred and
thirty pounds.  His face was broad and flat, and the
eyebrows over-hung the eyes.  The eyes themselves were
small, deep-set, and close together.  He had
practically no nose at all.  It was squat and broad,
apparently with-out any bridge, while the nostrils were
like two holes in the face, opening outward instead of
down.
<P>
The forehead slanted back from the eyes, and the hair
began right at the eyes and ran up over the head.  The
head itself was preposterously small and was supported
on an equally preposterous, thick, short neck.
<P>
There was an elemental economy about his body--as was
there about all our bodies.  The chest was deep, it is
true, cavernously deep; but there were no full-swelling
muscles, no wide-spreading shoulders, no clean-limbed
straightness, no generous symmetry of outline.  It
represented strength, that body of my father's,
strength without beauty; ferocious, primordial
strength, made to clutch and gripe and rend and
destroy.
<P>
His hips were thin; and the legs, lean and hairy, were
crooked and stringy-muscled.  In fact, my father's legs
were more like arms. They were twisted and gnarly, and
with scarcely the semblance of the full meaty calf such
as graces your leg and mine.  I remember he could not
walk on the flat of his foot.  This was because it was
a prehensile foot, more like a hand than a foot.  The
great toe, instead of being in line with the other
toes, opposed them, like a thumb, and its opposition to
the other toes was what enabled him to get a grip with
his foot.  This was why he could not walk on the flat
of his foot.
<P>
But his appearance was no more unusual than the manner
of his coming, there to my mother and me as we perched
above the angry wild pigs.  He came through the trees,
leaping from limb to limb and from tree to tree; and he
came swiftly.  I can see him now, in my wake-a-day
life, as I write this, swinging along through the
trees, a four-handed, hairy creature, howling with
rage, pausing now and again to beat his chest with his
clenched fist, leaping ten-and-fifteen-foot gaps,
catching a branch with one hand and swinging on across
another gap to catch with his other hand and go on,
never hesitating, never at a loss as to how to proceed
on his arboreal way.
<P>
And as I watched him I felt in my own being, in my very
muscles themselves, the surge and thrill of desire to
go leaping from bough to bough; and I felt also the
guarantee of the latent power in that being and in
those muscles of mine.  And why not? Little boys watch
their fathers swing axes and fell trees, and feel in
themselves that some day they, too, will swing axes and
fell trees.  And so with me.  The life that was in me
was constituted to do what my father did, and it
whispered to me secretly and ambitiously of aerial
paths and forest flights.
<P>
At last my father joined us.  He was extremely angry.
I remember the out-thrust of his protruding underlip as
he glared down at the wild pigs.  He snarled something
like a dog, and I remember that his eye-teeth were
large, like fangs, and that they impressed me
tremendously.
<P>
His conduct served only the more to infuriate the pigs.
He broke off twigs and small branches and flung them
down upon our enemies. He even hung by one hand,
tantalizingly just beyond reach, and mocked them as
they gnashed their tusks with impotent rage.  Not
content with this, he broke off a stout branch, and,
holding on with one hand and foot, jabbed the
infuriated beasts in the sides and whacked them across
their noses. Needless to state, my mother and I enjoyed
the sport.
<P>
But one tires of all good things, and in the end, my
father, chuckling maliciously the while, led the way
across the trees. Now it was that my ambitions ebbed
away, and I became timid, holding tightly to my mother
as she climbed and swung through space.  I remember
when the branch broke with her weight.  She had made a
wide leap, and with the snap of the wood I was
overwhelmed with the sickening consciousness of falling
through space, the pair of us.  The forest and the
sunshine on the rustling leaves vanished from my eyes.
I had a fading glimpse of my father abruptly arresting
his progress to look, and then all was blackness.
<P>
The next moment I was awake, in my sheeted bed,
sweating, trembling, nauseated.  The window was up, and
a cool air was blowing through the room.  The
night-lamp was burning calmly.  And because of this I
take it that the wild pigs did not get us, that we
never fetched bottom; else I should not be here now, a
thousand centuries after, to remember the event.
<P>
And now put yourself in my place for a moment.  Walk
with me a bit in my tender childhood, bed with me a
night and imagine yourself dreaming such
incomprehensible horrors.  Remember I was an
inexperienced child.  I had never seen a wild boar in
my life. For that matter I had never seen a
domesticated pig.  The nearest approach to one that I
had seen was breakfast bacon sizzling in its fat.  And
yet here, real as life, wild boars dashed through my
dreams, and I, with fantastic parents, swung through
the lofty tree-spaces.
<P>
Do you wonder that I was frightened and oppressed by my
nightmare-ridden nights?  I was accursed.  And, worst
of all, I was afraid to tell.  I do not know why,
except that I had a feeling of guilt, though I knew no
better of what I was guilty.  So it was, through long
years, that I suffered in silence, until I came to
man's estate and learned the why and wherefore of my
dreams.
