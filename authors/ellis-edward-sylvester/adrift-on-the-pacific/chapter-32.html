<p>The double canoe, with its cumbersome lateen sail and its crew
of twenty-odd pirates, had stolen down from somewhere among the
Paumotu Islands, and was now gradually approaching the proa which
contained Abram Storms and Inez Hawthorne.</p>

<p>The experience of the preceding few years, and especially of
the last day or two, had given Mr. Storms an astonishing acuteness,
which enabled him often to detect the truth without difficulty.
The strong suspicion he now formed was that Fred Sanders was expecting
the appearance of the craft, and that he was guiding his own proa
in accordance with some prearranged plan. This was an alarming
conclusion to reach, but Storms felt hardly a particle of doubt
that he was right.</p>

<p>"He intends to betray us, and has intended to do so from the
first."</p>

<p>The New Englander took another look at the double canoe, and
he saw, even in the few minutes that had passed, that they were
closer together. And now that his suspicions were aroused, he
detected several other little things which only confirmed all
that had entered his mind. The two islanders who composed the
crew were continually glancing off at their brothers, and frequently
spoke in low tones, and showed by the gleam of their swarthy faces
that they were on the tip-toe of expectation.</p>

<p>From one corner of the lateen sail, Storms now noticed that a
large crimson handkerchief was fluttering in the wind.</p>

<p>"It is put there as a signal," was the decision respecting that,
"and doubtless signifies that they have us on board and all is
going right."</p>

<p>Fred Sanders was so occupied with this business that he never
once suspected that he himself was being watched in turn.</p>

<p>"Inez," said the mate, "go to the captain and speak a few words
to him."</p>

<p>"But he is so occupied that he will not wish to be disturbed."</p>

<p>"Never mind about that; I wish you to go and say a few pleasant
words to him. Let them be sympathetic."</p>

<p>"What shall I say?"</p>

<p>"I can give you no further directions."</p>

<p>"I am loth to do so, but if you wish it&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I wish it very much."</p>

<p>That was enough, and the girl, with some natural hesitation of
manner, advanced to the young captain, who did not notice her
until she was at his elbow.</p>

<p>"Good-day, Captain Fred," she said; "you have been busy so long
that you must be tired, for you slept none last night."</p>

<p>He looked toward her with a quick, curious expression. There
was a half-smile on his face, while his forehead was wrinkled
with displeasure. Inez noticed this, and would have withdrawn
had she not recalled the strange earnestness with which Storms
made the request for her to utter a few pleasant words to the
youth. She therefore determined to carry out his wishes.</p>

<p>"Can't we relieve you of your work?" continued she.</p>

<p>Sanders was in reality doing nothing in the way of physical labor,
since the steering oar was in the hands of one of the crew, but
he was absorbed in "watching things," as the expression goes.</p>

<p>"I am sure there is no way in which you can relieve me," said
Fred, unbending somewhat from his reserve.</p>

<p>"We are in such deep water, and the wind is so fair, that there
can be no danger, I suppose. But tell me, what sort of a boat
is that yonder which is pursuing nearly the same course with us?"</p>

<p>"That &mdash;I presume," was the hesitating response, as the
young man glanced in that direction, "is one of the double canoes
or proas which are often seen among these islands."</p>

<p>"And who are the crew?"</p>

<p>"Islanders, like my own."</p>

<p>"Are we going to meet them?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know what to answer to that," said Fred, looking inquiringly
toward the large proa again, as if he had not seen it before.</p>

<p>"Well, Captain Sanders, they must be pirates," said Inez, stepping
close to him, and speaking in a low, tremulous voice; "but whether
they are or not, my faith in God and in you cannot be changed.
I know you will do all you can for us&#11834;"</p>

<p>"There! there!" protested the young captain, with an expression
of pain on his face, "say no more. Please go away, Inez, and leave
me alone."</p>

<p>"Of course I will leave you, if you do not wish me here, but
gratitude would not let me keep silent. I know, from what you
said last night, that you have a good heart, and henceforth conscience
is to be your master and guide."</p>

<p>And without looking to see the effect of her words, Inez left
the captain to his own thoughts.</p>

<p>Abram Storms, with folded arms, was intently watching him, and
he carefully studied his countenance. He was still doing so, when
Inez turned her back upon Sanders. Mr. Storms noted the strange
expression on the handsome countenance, and just then Sanders
turned and looked straight at the man before the latter could
withdraw his gaze. As their eyes met, he signaled to Storms to
approach, and the latter, with no little wonderment and some misgiving,
did so.</p>

<p>"Mr. Storms," said he, "that double canoe off yonder has twenty-three
pirates on board."</p>

<p>"I suspected as much," coolly replied the other.</p>

<p>"And a set of worse villains cannot be found in the South Seas."</p>

<p>"I am sure you are quite right."</p>

<p>"These two men that I have on board belong to the same crew."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I hadn't thought of that."</p>

<p>"I belong to the same gang."</p>

<p>"I suspected that!"</p>

<p>"You did, eh? Did you suspect that I was in the plot to obtain
possession of your pearls?"</p>

<p>"I did not suspect it; I was sure of it, which is why I have
carried my loaded revolver with me."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't have defeated the plan we had laid, for when twenty-three
odd savages, with their spears, war-clubs and a few muskets, had
stolen up to the island in the darkness, and crept silently into
your cabin, what good would your guns and revolvers have done
you?"</p>

<p>"Was that the plan?"</p>

<p>"That was it precisely. By some means or other, which I never
could understand, rumors reached Wauparmur, months ago, that two
men and a child were on an island to the south of us, and that
they had an immense lot of the most valuable pearls. I cannot
comprehend how it was the natives gained such knowledge, for it
must have had some basis of truth, inasmuch as it proved to be
true."</p>

<p>"There was a proa which passed close to the island while we were
opening the pearl-oysters," said Storms. "We all saw it."</p>

<p>"The rumor came from them, then," continued Sanders, "and a party
was formed to go down there, and find out whether it was true,
and, in case it was, the white men were to be overcome by treachery,
and their possessions in the shape of pearls taken. Since there
is no more desperate and wicked member of the gang than am I,
of course I was one of the first chosen.</p>

<p>"We started in two boats, and, as we went along, I could see
difficulties in the way which never occurred to them. It was not
likely you carried the pearls about with you, as a person wears
his jewelry; but most likely they were buried, so that if we came
down upon you and made an overwhelming attack, as was first intended,
we might put you all to death, and then be unable to find where
you had hidden your treasures. Besides that, I saw that it was
more than probable you had firearms, with which you could successfully
hold out against a large force, and it would prove no easy thing
to subdue you."</p>

<p>"You were correct in both your surmises," said Storms. "We were
always prepared to make a fight, and, with our guns against your
spears, we would have beaten you off. The pearls, too, were carefully
concealed where you never would have found them."</p>

<p>"I was well convinced of that, so we resorted to strategy. I
was to go with a couple of the men and bring you away, trying
all the time if I could to secure the pearls, which, of course,
were afterwards to be disposed of and the proceeds divided among
us&mdash;the intention being that when we got you on the proa, you
would be pitched overboard, for then the situation would be so
changed that we could manage it without trouble. If I thought
it unsafe to make the attempt, I had only to wait until reinforcements
should come up; for the larger boat, knowing the course I was
to take on my return, had only to be on the lookout for us, and
we would be sure to descry each other."</p>

<p>"And that was to be your signal that you had us aboard?" said
Storms, pointing to the fluttering handkerchief.</p>

<p>"That's it precisely," assented Sanders. "But there was one force
which we did not think to provide against," added the young man,
in a low voice, in which Storms detected a slight tremor.</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"An awakened conscience," was the impressive answer. "And it
was she who aroused the sleeper. There was something in the goodness
of the girl&mdash;the faith which she showed not only in heaven but
in me as well&mdash;that upset all my calculations. Then, too, she
seemed to say the right words just at the right time; and you
saw how I suffered."</p>

<p>"Yes; and it gave me great hope; for, Fred, I distrusted you
from the beginning. I saw many little things which you never supposed
I nor any one else would notice. And I may add," said the mate,
with a sly twinkle, "that I endeavored always to be prepared for
you."</p>

<p>The face of Sanders flushed, but he added, with the same seriousness:</p>

<p>"Matters now are going in accordance with the program arranged
days ago. The large proa yonder has been waiting for us, and we
are now to keep on converging lines until we meet to-night."</p>

<p>"Do you intend to follow out your agreement?"</p>

<p>"No; I had an awful struggle with my conscience last night, after
my talk with Inez and with the poor captain, but the evil triumphed
in me, despite all I could do. The fight was still going on, being
renewed this morning, and I had about yielded to Satan, when she
came and spoke to me. That," said Fred Sanders, with a compression
of the lips, "has settled it forever. I am now your friend, and
I am ready to give up my life for the safety of you and her, hoping
that heaven will take it, with my repentance, as some atonement
for the many sins I have committed."</p>
