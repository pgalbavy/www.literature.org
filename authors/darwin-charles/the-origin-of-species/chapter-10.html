<P>

Let us now see whether the several facts and rules relating to the
geological succession of organic beings, better accord with the common
view of the immutability of species, or with that of their slow and
gradual modification, through descent and natural selection.
<P>
New species have appeared very slowly, one after another, both on
the land and in the waters. Lyell has shown that it is hardly possible
to resist the evidence on this head in the case of the several
tertiary stages; and every year tends to fill up the blanks between
them, and to make the percentage system of lost and new forms more
gradual. In some of the most recent beds, though undoubtedly of high
antiquity if measured by years, only one or two species are lost
forms, and only one or two are new forms, having here appeared for the
first time, either locally, or, as far as we know, on the face of the
earth. If we may trust the observations of Philippi in Sicily, the
successive changes in the marine inhabitants of that island have been
many and most gradual. The secondary formations are more broken; but,
as Bronn has remarked, neither the appearance nor disappearance of
their many now extinct species has been simultaneous in each separate
formation.
<P>
Species of different genera and classes have not
changed at the same rate, or in the same degree. In the oldest
tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found in the midst of a
multitude of extinct forms. Falconer has given a striking instance of
a similar fact, in an existing crocodile associated with many strange
and lost mammals and reptiles in the sub-Himalayan deposits. The
Silurian Lingula differs but little from the living species of this
genus; whereas most of the other Silurian Molluscs and all the
Crustaceans have changed greatly. The productions of the land seem to
change at a quicker rate than those of the sea, of which a striking
instance has lately been observed in Switzerland. There is some reason
to believe that organisms, considered high in the scale of nature,
change more quickly than those that are low: though there are
exceptions to this rule. The amount of organic change, as Pictet has
remarked, does not strictly correspond with the succession of our
geological formations; so that between each two consecutive
formations, the forms of life have seldom changed in exactly the same
degree. Yet if we compare any but the most closely related formations,
all the species will be found to have undergone some change. When a
species has once disappeared from the face of the earth, we have
reason to believe that the same identical form never reappears. The
strongest apparent exception to this latter rule, is that of the
so-called `colonies' of M. Barrande, which intrude for a period in the
midst of an older formation, and then allow the pre-existing fauna to
reappear; but Lyell's explanation, namely, that it is a case of
temporary migration from a distinct geographical province, seems to me
satisfactory.
<P>
These several facts accord well with my theory. I believe in no
fixed law of development, causing all the inhabitants of a country to
change abruptly, or simultaneously, or to an equal degree. The process
of modification must be extremely slow. The variability of each
species is quite independent of that of all others.  Whether such
variability be taken advantage of by natural selection, and whether
the variations be accumulated to a greater or lesser amount, thus
causing a greater or lesser amount of modification in the varying
species, depends on many complex contingencies,   on the
variability being of a beneficial nature, on the power of
intercrossing, on the rate of breeding, on the slowly changing
physical conditions of the country, and more especially on the nature
of the other inhabitants with which the varying species comes into
competition. Hence it is by no means surprising that one species
should retain the same identical form much longer than others; or, if
changing, that it should change less. We see the same fact in
geographical distribution; for instance, in the land-shells and
coleopterous insects of Madeira having come to differ considerably
from their nearest allies on the continent of Europe, whereas the
marine shells and birds have remained unaltered. We can perhaps
understand the apparently quicker rate of change in terrestrial and in
more highly organised productions compared with marine and lower
productions, by the more complex relations of the higher beings to
their organic and inorganic conditions of life, as explained in a
former chapter. When many of the inhabitants of a country have become
modified and improved, we can understand, on the principle of
competition, and on that of the many all-important relations of
organism to organism, that any form which does not become in some
degree modified and improved, will be liable to be exterminated. Hence
we can see why all the species in the same region do at last, if we
look to wide enough intervals of time, become modified; for those
which do not change will become extinct.
<P>
In members of the same class the average amount of change, during
long and equal periods of time, may, perhaps, be nearly the same; but
as the accumulation of long-enduring fossiliferous formations depends
on great masses of sediment having been deposited on areas whilst
subsiding, our formations have been almost necessarily accumulated at
wide and irregularly intermittent intervals; consequently the amount
of organic change exhibited by the fossils embedded in consecutive
formations is not equal. Each formation, on this view, does not mark a
new and complete act of creation, but only an occasional scene, taken
almost at hazard, in a slowly changing drama.
<P>
We can clearly understand why a species when once lost should never
reappear, even if the very same conditions of life, organic and
inorganic, should recur. For though the offspring of one
species might be adapted (and no doubt this has occurred in
innumerable instances) to fill the exact place of another species in
the economy of nature, and thus supplant it; yet the two forms  
the old and the new   would not be identically the same; for
both would almost certainly inherit different characters from their
distinct progenitors. For instance, it is just possible, if our
fantail-pigeons were all destroyed, that fanciers, by striving during
long ages for the same object, might make a new breed hardly
distinguishable from our present fantail; but if the parent
rock-pigeon were also destroyed, and in nature we have every reason to
believe that the parent-form will generally be supplanted and
exterminated by its improved offspring, it is quite incredible that a
fantail, identical with the existing breed, could be raised from any
other species of pigeon, or even from the other well-established races
of the domestic pigeon, for the newly-formed fantail would be almost
sure to inherit from its new progenitor some slight characteristic
differences.
<P>
Groups of species, that is, genera and families, follow the same
general rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single
species, changing more or less quickly, and in a greater or lesser
degree. A group does not reappear after it has once disappeared; or
its existence, as long as it lasts, is continuous. I am aware that
there are some apparent exceptions to this rule, but the exceptions
are surprisingly few, so few, that E. Forbes, Pictet, and Woodward
(though all strongly opposed to such views as I maintain) admit its
truth; and the rule strictly accords with my theory. For as all the
species of the same group have descended from some one species, it is
clear that as long as any species of the group have appeared in the
long succession of ages, so long must its members have continuously
existed, in order to have generated either new and modified or the
same old and unmodified forms. Species of the genus Lingula, for
instance, must have continuously existed by an unbroken succession of
generations, from the lowest Silurian stratum to the present day.
<P>
We have seen in the last chapter that the species of a group
sometimes falsely appear to have come in abruptly; and I have
attempted to give an explanation of this fact, which if true would
have been fatal to my views. But such cases are certainly exceptional;
the general rule being a gradual increase in number, till
the group reaches its maximum, and then, sooner or later, it gradually
decreases. If the number of the species of a genus, or the number of
the genera of a family, be represented by a vertical line of varying
thickness, crossing the successive geological formations in which the
species are found, the line will sometimes falsely appear to begin at
its lower end, not in a sharp point, but abruptly; it then gradually
thickens upwards, sometimes keeping for a space of equal thickness,
and ultimately thins out in the upper beds, marking the decrease and
final extinction of the species. This gradual increase in number of
the species of a group is strictly conformable with my theory; as the
species of the same genus, and the genera of the same family, can
increase only slowly and progressively; for the process of
modification and the production of a number of allied forms must be
slow and gradual,   one species giving rise first to two or
three varieties, these being slowly converted into species, which in
their turn produce by equally slow steps other species, and so on,
like the branching of a great tree from a single stem, till the group
becomes large.
<P>
<H4>On Extinction</H4> 
<P>
We have as yet spoken
only incidentally of the disappearance of species and of groups of
species. On the theory of natural selection the extinction of old
forms and the production of new and improved forms are intimately
connected together. The old notion of all the inhabitants of the earth
having been swept away at successive periods by catastrophes, is very
generally given up, even by those geologists, as Elie de Beaumont,
Murchison, Barrande, &amp;c., whose general views would naturally lead
them to this conclusion. On the contrary, we have every reason to
believe, from the study of the tertiary formations, that species and
groups of species gradually disappear, one after another, first from
one spot, then from another, and finally from the world. Both single
species and whole groups of species last for very unequal periods;
some groups, as we have seen, having endured from the earliest known
dawn of life to the present day; some having disappeared before the
close of the palaeozoic period. No fixed law seems to determine the
length of time during which any single species or any single genus
endures.  There is reason to believe that the complete
extinction of the species of a group is generally a slower process
than their production: if the appearance and disappearance of a group
of species be represented, as before, by a vertical line of varying
thickness, the line is found to taper more gradually at its upper end,
which marks the progress of extermination, than at its lower end,
which marks the first appearance and increase in numbers of the
species. In some cases, however, the extermination of whole groups of
beings, as of ammonites towards the close of the secondary period, has
been wonderfully sudden.
<P>
The whole subject of the extinction of species has been involved in
the most gratuitous mystery. Some authors have even supposed that as
the individual has a definite length of life, so have species a
definite duration. No one I think can have marvelled more at the
extinction of species, than I have done. When I found in La Plata the
tooth of a horse embedded with the remains of Mastodon, Megatherium,
Toxodon, and other extinct monsters, which all co-existed with still
living shells at a very late geological period, I was filled with
astonishment; for seeing that the horse, since its introduction by the
Spaniards into South America, has run wild over the whole country and
has increased in numbers at an unparalleled rate, I asked myself what
could so recently have exterminated the former horse under conditions
of life apparently so favourable. But how utterly groundless was my
astonishment! Professor Owen soon perceived that the tooth, though so
like that of the existing horse, belonged to an extinct species. Had
this horse been still living, but in some degree rare, no naturalist
would have felt the least surprise at its rarity; for rarity is the
attribute of a vast number of species of all classes, in all
countries. If we ask ourselves why this or that species is rare, we
answer that something is unfavourable in its conditions of life; but
what that something is, we can hardly ever tell. On the supposition of
the fossil horse still existing as a rare species, we might have felt
certain from the analogy of all other mammals, even of the
slow-breeding elephant, and from the history of the naturalisation of
the domestic horse in South America, that under more favourable
conditions it would in a very few years have stocked the whole
continent.  But we could not have told what the
unfavourable conditions were which checked its increase, whether some
one or several contingencies, and at what period of the horse's life,
and in what degree, they severally acted. If the conditions had gone
on, however slowly, becoming less and less favourable, we assuredly
should not have perceived the fact, yet the fossil horse would
certainly have become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct;  
its place being seized on by some more successful competitor.
<P>
It is most difficult always to remember that the increase of every
living being is constantly being checked by unperceived injurious
agencies; and that these same unperceived agencies are amply
sufficient to cause rarity, and finally extinction. We see in many
cases in the more recent tertiary formations, that rarity precedes
extinction; and we know that this has been the progress of events with
those animals which have been exterminated, either locally or wholly,
through man's agency. I may repeat what I published in 1845, namely,
that to admit that species generally become rare before they become
extinct   to feel no surprise at the rarity of a species, and
yet to marvel greatly when it ceases to exist, is much the same as to
admit that sickness in the individual is the forerunner of death
  to feel no surprise at sickness, but when the sick man dies,
to wonder and to suspect that he died by some unknown deed of
violence.
<P>
The theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each
new variety, and ultimately each new species, is produced and
maintained by having some advantage over those with which it comes
into competition; and the consequent extinction of less-favoured forms
almost inevitably follows.  It is the same with our domestic
productions: when a new and slightly improved variety has been raised,
it at first supplants the less improved varieties in the same
neighbourhood; when much improved it is transported far and near, like
our short-horn cattle, and takes the place of other breeds in other
countries. Thus the appearance of new forms and the disappearance of
old forms, both natural and artificial, are bound together. In certain
flourishing groups, the number of new specific forms which have been
produced within a given time is probably greater than that of the old
forms which have been exterminated; but we know that the
number of species has not gone on indefinitely increasing, at least
during the later geological periods, so that looking to later times we
may believe that the production of new forms has caused the extinction
of about the same number of old forms.
<P>
The competition will generally be most severe, as formerly
explained and illustrated by examples, between the forms which are
most like each other in all respects. Hence the improved and modified
descendants of a species will generally cause the extermination of the
parent-species; and if many new forms have been developed from any one
species, the nearest allies of that species, <I>i.e.</I>
the species of the
same genus, will be the most liable to extermination. Thus, as I
believe, a number of new species descended from one species, that is a
new genus, comes to supplant an old genus, belonging to the same
family. But it must often have happened that a new species belonging
to some one group will have seized on the place occupied by a species
belonging to a distinct group, and thus caused its extermination; and
if many allied forms be developed from the successful intruder, many
will have to yield their places; and it will generally be allied
forms, which will suffer from some inherited inferiority in common.
But whether it be species belonging to the same or to a distinct
class, which yield their places to other species which have been
modified and improved, a few of the sufferers may often long be
preserved, from being fitted to some peculiar line of life, or from
inhabiting some distant and isolated station, where they have escaped
severe competition. For instance, a single species of Trigonia, a
great genus of shells in the secondary formations, survives in the
Australian seas; and a few members of the great and almost extinct
group of Ganoid fishes still inhabit our fresh waters. Therefore the
utter extinction of a group is generally, as we have seen, a slower
process than its production.
<P>
With respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole
families or orders, as of Trilobites at the close of the palaeozoic
period and of Ammonites at the close of the secondary period, we must
remember what has been already said on the probable wide intervals of
time between our consecutive formations; and in these intervals there
may have been much slow extermination. Moreover, when by
sudden immigration or by unusually rapid development, many species of
a new group have taken possession of a new area, they will have
exterminated in a correspondingly rapid manner many of the old
inhabitants; and the forms which thus yield their places will commonly
be allied, for they will partake of some inferiority in common.
<P>
Thus, as it seems to me, the manner in which single species and
whole groups of species become extinct, accords well with the theory
of natural selection. We need not marvel at extinction; if we must
marvel, let it be at our presumption in imagining for a moment that we
understand the many complex contingencies, on which the existence of
each species depends. If we forget for an instant, that each species
tends to increase inordinately, and that some check is always in
action, yet seldom perceived by us, the whole economy of nature will
be utterly obscured. Whenever we can precisely say why this species is
more abundant in individuals than that; why this species and not
another can be naturalised in a given country; then, and not till
then, we may justly feel surprise why we cannot account for the
extinction of this particular species or group of species.
<P>
<H4>On the Forms of Life changing almost
simultaneously throughout the World</H4> 
<P>
Scarcely any
palaeontological discovery is more striking than the fact, that the
forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout the world. Thus
our European Chalk formation can be recognised in many distant parts
of the world, under the most different climates, where not a fragment
of the mineral chalk itself can be found; namely, in North America, in
equatorial South America, in Tierra del Fuego, at the Cape of Good
Hope, and in the peninsula of India. For at these distant points, the
organic remains in certain beds present an unmistakeable degree of
resemblance to those of the Chalk. It is not that the same species are
met with; for in some cases not one species is identically the same,
but they belong to the same families, genera, and sections of genera,
and sometimes are similarly characterised in such trifling points as
mere superficial sculpture. Moreover other forms, which are not found
in the Chalk of Europe, but which occur in the formations either above
or below, are similarly absent at these distant points of
the world. In the several successive palaeozoic formations of Russia,
Western Europe and North America, a similar parallelism in the forms
of life has been observed by several authors: so it is, according to
Lyell, with the several European and North American tertiary deposits.
Even if the few fossil species which are common to the Old and New
Worlds be kept wholly out of view, the general parallelism in the
successive forms of life, in the stages of the widely separated
palaeozoic and tertiary periods, would still be manifest, and the
several formations could be easily correlated.
<P>
These observations, however, relate to the marine inhabitants of
distant parts of the world: we have not sufficient data to judge
whether the productions of the land and of fresh water change at
distant points in the same parallel manner. We may doubt whether they
have thus changed: if the Megatherium, Mylodon, Macrauchenia, and
Toxodon had been brought to Europe from La Plata, without any
information in regard to their geological position, no one would have
suspected that they had coexisted with still living sea-shells; but as
these anomalous monsters coexisted with the Mastodon and Horse, it
might at least have been inferred that they had lived during one of
the latter tertiary stages.
<P>
When the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed
simultaneously throughout the world, it must not be supposed that this
expression relates to the same thousandth or hundred-thousandth year,
or even that it has a very strict geological sense; for if all the
marine animals which live at the present day in Europe, and all those
that lived in Europe during the pleistocene period (an enormously
remote period as measured by years, including the whole glacial
epoch), were to be compared with those now living in South America or
in Australia, the most skilful naturalist would hardly be able to say
whether the existing or the pleistocene inhabitants of Europe
resembled most closely those of the southern hemisphere.  So, again,
several highly competent observers believe that the existing
productions of the United States are more closely related to those
which lived in Europe during certain later tertiary stages, than to
those which now live here; and if this be so, it is evident that
fossiliferous beds deposited at the present day on the
shores of North America would hereafter be liable to be classed with
somewhat older European beds. Nevertheless, looking to a remotely
future epoch, there can, I think, be little doubt that all the more
modern <I>marine</I> formations, namely, the upper pliocene, the pleistocene
and strictly modern beds, of Europe, North and South America, and
Australia, from containing fossil remains in some degree allied, and
from not including those forms which are only found in the older
underlying deposits, would be correctly ranked as simultaneous in a
geological sense.
<P>
The fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously, in the above
large sense, at distant parts of the world, has greatly struck those
admirable observers, MM. de Verneuil and d'Archiac. After referring
to the parallelism of the palaeozoic forms of life in various parts of
Europe, they add, `If struck by this strange sequence, we turn our
attention to North America, and there discover a series of analogous
phenomena, it will appear certain that all these modifications of
species, their extinction, and the introduction of new ones, cannot be
owing to mere changes in marine currents or other causes more or less
local and temporary, but depend on general laws which govern the whole
animal kingdom.' M. Barrande has made forcible remarks to precisely
the same effect. It is, indeed, quite futile to look to changes of
currents, climate, or other physical conditions, as the cause of these
great mutations in the forms of life throughout the world, under the
most different climates. We must, as Barrande has remarked, look to
some special law. We shall see this more clearly when we treat of the
present distribution of organic beings, and find how slight is the
relation between the physical conditions of various countries, and the
nature of their inhabitants.
<P>
This great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life
throughout the world, is explicable on the theory of natural
selection. New species are formed by new varieties arising, which have
some advantage over older forms; and those forms, which are already
dominant, or have some advantage over the other forms in their own
country, would naturally oftenest give rise to new varieties or
incipient species; for these latter must be victorious in a still
higher degree in order to be preserved and to survive.
We have distinct evidence on this head, in the plants which are
dominant, that is, which are commonest in their own homes, and are
most widely diffused, having produced the greatest number of new
varieties. It is also natural that the dominant, varying, and
far-spreading species, which already have invaded to a certain extent
the territories of other species, should be those which would have the
best chance of spreading still further, and of giving rise in new
countries to new varieties and species. The process of diffusion may
often be very slow, being dependent on climatal and geographical
changes, or on strange accidents, but in the long run the dominant
forms will generally succeed in spreading. The diffusion would, it is
probable, be slower with the terrestrial inhabitants of distinct
continents than with the marine inhabitants of the continuous sea. We
might therefore expect to find, as we apparently do find, a less
strict degree of parallel succession in the productions of the land
than of the sea.
<P>
Dominant species spreading from any region might encounter still
more dominant species, and then their triumphant course, or even their
existence, would cease. We know not at all precisely what are all the
conditions most favourable for the multiplication of new and dominant
species; but we can, I think, clearly see that a number of
individuals, from giving a better chance of the appearance of
favourable variations, and that severe competition with many already
existing forms, would be highly favourable, as would be the power of
spreading into new territories. A certain amount of isolation,
recurring at long intervals of time, would probably be also
favourable, as before explained. One quarter of the world may have
been most favourable for the production of new and dominant species on
the land, and another for those in the waters of the sea. If two great
regions had been for a long period favourably circumstanced in an
equal degree, whenever their inhabitants met, the battle would be
prolonged and severe; and some from one birthplace and some from the
other might be victorious.  But in the course of time, the forms
dominant in the highest degree, wherever produced, would tend
everywhere to prevail.  As they prevailed, they would cause the
extinction of other and inferior forms; and as these
inferior forms would be allied in groups by inheritance, whole groups
would tend slowly to disappear; though here and there a single member
might long be enabled to survive.
<P>
Thus, as it seems to me, the parallel, and, taken in a large sense,
simultaneous, succession of the same forms of life throughout the
world, accords well with the principle of new species having been
formed by dominant species spreading widely and varying; the new
species thus produced being themselves dominant owing to inheritance,
and to having already had some advantage over their parents or over
other species; these again spreading, varying, and producing new
species. The forms which are beaten and which yield their places to
the new and victorious forms, will generally be allied in groups, from
inheriting some inferiority in common; and therefore as new and
improved groups spread throughout the world, old groups will disappear
from the world; and the succession of forms in both ways will
everywhere tend to correspond.
<P>
There is one other remark connected with this subject worth making.
I have given my reasons for believing that all our greater
fossiliferous formations were deposited during periods of subsidence;
and that blank intervals of vast duration occurred during the periods
when the bed of the sea was either stationary or rising, and likewise
when sediment was not thrown down quickly enough to embed and preserve
organic remains. During these long and blank intervals I suppose that
the inhabitants of each region underwent a considerable amount of
modification and extinction, and that there was much migration from
other parts of the world. As we have reason to believe that large
areas are affected by the same movement, it is probable that strictly
contemporaneous formations have often been accumulated over very wide
spaces in the same quarter of the world; but we are far from having
any right to conclude that this has invariably been the case, and that
large areas have invariably been affected by the same movements. When
two formations have been deposited in two regions during nearly, but
not exactly the same period, we should find in both, from the causes
explained in the foregoing paragraphs, the same general succession in
the forms of life; but the species would not exactly 
correspond; for there will have been a little more time in the one
region than in the other for modification, extinction, and
immigration.
<P>
I suspect that cases of this nature have occurred in Europe. Mr.
Prestwich, in his admirable Memoirs on the eocene deposits of England
and France, is able to draw a close general parallelism between the
successive stages in the two countries; but when he compares certain
stages in England with those in France, although he finds in both a
curious accordance in the numbers of the species belonging to the same
genera, yet the species themselves differ in a manner very difficult
to account for, considering the proximity of the two areas,  
unless, indeed, it be assumed that an isthmus separated two seas
inhabited by distinct, but contemporaneous, faunas. Lyell has made
similar observations on some of the later tertiary formations.
Barrande, also, shows that there is a striking general parallelism in
the successive Silurian deposits of Bohemia and Scandinavia;
nevertheless he finds a surprising amount of difference in the
species. If the several formations in these regions have not been
deposited during the same exact periods,   a formation in one
region often corresponding with a blank interval in the other,  
and if in both regions the species have gone on slowly changing during
the accumulation of the several formations and during the long
intervals of time between them; in this case, the several formations
in the two regions could be arranged in the same order, in accordance
with the general succession of the form of life, and the order would
falsely appear to be strictly parallel; nevertheless the species would
not all be the same in the apparently corresponding stages in the two
regions.
<P>
<H4>On the Affinities of extinct Species to each
other, and to living forms</H4>
<P>
Let us now look to the mutual
affinities of extinct and living species. They all fall into one grand
natural system; and this fact is at once explained on the principle of
descent. The more ancient any form is, the more, as a general rule, it
differs from living forms.  But, as Buckland long ago remarked, all
fossils can be classed either in still existing groups, or between
them.  That the extinct forms of life help to fill up the wide
intervals between existing genera, families, and orders,
cannot be disputed.  For if we confine our attention either to the
living or to the extinct alone, the series is far less perfect than if
we combine both into one general system. With respect to the
Vertebrata, whole pages could be filled with striking illustrations
from our great palaeontologist, Owen, showing how extinct animals fall
in between existing groups. Cuvier ranked the Ruminants and
Pachyderms, as the two most distinct orders of mammals; but Owen has
discovered so many fossil links, that he has had to alter the whole
classification of these two orders; and has placed certain pachyderms
in the same sub-order with ruminants: for example, he dissolves by
fine gradations the apparently wide difference between the pig and the
camel. In regard to the Invertebrata, Barrande, and a higher authority
could not be named, asserts that he is every day taught that
palaeozoic animals, though belonging to the same orders, families, or
genera with those living at the present day, were not at this early
epoch limited in such distinct groups as they now are.
<P>
Some writers have objected to any extinct species or group of
species being considered as intermediate between living species or
groups. If by this term it is meant that an extinct form is directly
intermediate in all its characters between two living forms, the
objection is probably valid. But I apprehend that in a perfectly
natural classification many fossil species would have to stand between
living species, and some extinct genera between living genera, even
between genera belonging to distinct families. The most common case,
especially with respect to very distinct groups, such as fish and
reptiles, seems to be, that supposing them to be distinguished at the
present day from each other by a dozen characters, the ancient members
of the same two groups would be distinguished by a somewhat lesser
number of characters, so that the two groups, though formerly quite
distinct, at that period made some small approach to each other.
<P>
It is a common belief that the more ancient a form is, by so much
the more it tends to connect by some of its characters groups now
widely separated from each other. This remark no doubt must be
restricted to those groups which have undergone much change in the
course of geological ages; and it would be  difficult to
prove the truth of the proposition, for every now and then even a
living animal, as the Lepidosiren, is discovered having affinities
directed towards very distinct groups. Yet if we compare the older
Reptiles and Batrachians, the older Fish, the older Cephalopods, and
the eocene Mammals, with the more recent members of the same classes,
we must admit that there is some truth in the remark.
<P>
Let us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with
the theory of descent with modification. As the subject is somewhat
complex, I must request the reader to turn to the diagram in the
fourth chapter. We may suppose that the numbered letters represent
genera, and the dotted lines diverging from them the species in each
genus. The diagram is much too simple, too few genera and too few
species being given, but this is unimportant for us. The horizontal
lines may represent successive geological formations, and all the
forms beneath the uppermost line may be considered as extinct. The
three existing genera, <I>a</I>14, <I>q</I>14, <I>p</I>14, will form a small
family; <I>b</I>14 and <I>f</I>14 a closely allied family or
sub-family; and <I>o</I>14, <I>e</I>14, <I>m</I>14, a third family. These
three families, together with the many extinct genera on the several
lines of descent diverging from the parent-form A, will form an order;
for all will have inherited something in common from their ancient and
common progenitor.  On the principle of the continued tendency to
divergence of character, which was formerly illustrated by this
diagram, the more recent any form is, the more it will generally
differ from its ancient progenitor. Hence we can understand the rule
that the most ancient fossils differ most from existing forms. We must
not, however, assume that divergence of character is a necessary
contingency; it depends solely on the descendants from a species being
thus enabled to seize on many and different places in the economy of
nature.  Therefore it is quite possible, as we have seen in the case
of some Silurian forms, that a species might go on being slightly
modified in relation to its slightly altered conditions of life, and
yet retain throughout a vast period the same general characteristics.
This is represented in the diagram by the letter <I>F</I>14.
<P>
All the many forms, extinct and recent, descended from A,
make, as before remarked, one order; and this order, from the
continued effects of extinction and divergence of character, has
become divided into several sub-families and families, some of which
are supposed to have perished at different periods, and some to have
endured to the present day.
<P>
By looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct
forms, supposed to be embedded in the successive formations, were
discovered at several points low down in the series, the three
existing families on the uppermost line would be rendered less
distinct from each other. If, for instance, the genera
<I>a</I>1, <I>a</I>5, <I>a</I>10, <I>m</I>3, <I>m</I>6, <I>m</I>9
were disinterred, these
three families would be so closely linked together that they probably
would have to be united into one great family, in nearly the same
manner as has occurred with ruminants and pachyderms. Yet he who
objected to call the extinct genera, which thus linked the living
genera of three families together, intermediate in character, would be
justified, as they are intermediate, not directly, but only by a long
and circuitous course through many widely different forms. If many
extinct forms were to be discovered above one of the middle horizontal
lines or geological formations   for instance, above No.  VI.
  but none from beneath this line, then only the two families on
the left hand (namely, <I>a</I>14, &amp;c., and 
<I>b</I>14, &amp;c.) would have to be united into 
one family; and the two other families (namely, <I>a</I>14 to <I>f</I>14
now including five genera, and <I>o</I>14 to 
<I>m</I>14) would yet remain distinct.  These two families,
however, would be less distinct from each other than they were before
the 
discovery of the fossils. If, for instance, we suppose the
existing genera of the two families to differ from each other by a
dozen characters, in this case the genera, at the early period marked
VI., would differ by a lesser number of characters; for at this early
stage of descent they have not diverged in character from the common
progenitor of the order, nearly so much as they subsequently diverged.
Thus it comes that ancient and extinct genera are often in some slight
degree intermediate in character between their modified descendants,
or between their collateral relations.
<P>
In nature the case will be far more complicated than is represented
in the diagram; for the groups will have been more 
numerous, they will have endured for extremely unequal lengths of
time, and will have been modified in various degrees. As we possess
only the last volume of the geological record, and that in a very
broken condition, we have no right to expect, except in very rare
cases, to fill up wide intervals in the natural system, and thus unite
distinct families or orders.  All that we have a right to expect, is
that those groups, which have within known geological periods
undergone much modification, should in the older formations make some
slight approach to each other; so that the older members should differ
less from each other in some of their characters than do the existing
members of the same groups; and this by the concurrent evidence of our
best palaeontologists seems frequently to be the case.
<P>
Thus, on the theory of descent with modification, the main facts
with respect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life to
each other and to living forms, seem to me explained in a satisfactory
manner. And they are wholly inexplicable on any other view.
<P>
On this same theory, it is evident that the fauna of any great
period in the earth's history will be intermediate in general
character between that which preceded and that which succeeded it.
Thus, the species which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in
the diagram are the modified offspring of those which lived at the
fifth stage, and are the parents of those which became still more
modified at the seventh stage; hence they could hardly fail to be
nearly intermediate in character between the forms of life above and
below. We must, however, allow for the entire extinction of some
preceding forms, and for the coming in of quite new forms by
immigration, and for a large amount of modification, during the long
and blank intervals between the successive formations. Subject to
these allowances, the fauna of each geological period undoubtedly is
intermediate in character, between the preceding and succeeding
faunas. I need give only one instance, namely, the manner in which the
fossils of the Devonian system, when this system was first discovered,
were at once recognised by palaeontologists as intermediate in
character between those of the overlying carboniferous, and underlying
Silurian system. But each fauna is not necessarily
exactly intermediate, as unequal intervals of time have elapsed
between consecutive formations.
<P>
It is no real objection to the truth of the statement, that the
fauna of each period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character
between the preceding and succeeding faunas, that certain genera offer
exceptions to the rule. For instance, mastodons and elephants, when
arranged by Dr Falconer in two series, first according to their mutual
affinities and then according to their periods of existence, do not
accord in arrangement. The species extreme in character are not the
oldest, or the most recent; nor are those which are intermediate in
character, intermediate in age. But supposing for an instant, in this
and other such cases, that the record of the first appearance and
disappearance of the species was perfect, we have no reason to believe
that forms successively produced necessarily endure for corresponding
lengths of time: a very ancient form might occasionally last much
longer than a form elsewhere subsequently produced, especially in the
case of terrestrial productions inhabiting separated districts. To
compare small things with great: if the principal living and extinct
races of the domestic pigeon were arranged as well as they could be in
serial affinity, this arrangement would not closely accord with the
order in time of their production, and still less with the order of
their disappearance; for the parent rock-pigeon now lives; and many
varieties between the rock-pigeon and the carrier have become extinct;
and carriers which are extreme in the important character of length of
beak originated earlier than short-beaked tumblers, which are at the
opposite end of the series in this same respect.
<P>
Closely connected with the statement, that the organic remains from
an intermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in
character, is the fact, insisted on by all palaeontologists, that
fossils from two consecutive formations are far more closely related
to each other, than are the fossils from two remote formations. Pictet
gives as a well-known instance, the general resemblance of the organic
remains from the several stages of the chalk formation, though the
species are distinct in each stage.  This fact alone, from its
generality, seems to have shaken Professor Pictet in his firm belief
in the immutability of species.  He who is acquainted
with the distribution of existing species over the globe, will not
attempt to account for the close resemblance of the distinct species
in closely consecutive formations, by the physical conditions of the
ancient areas having remained nearly the same. Let it be remembered
that the forms of life, at least those inhabiting the sea, have
changed almost simultaneously throughout the world, and therefore
under the most different climates and conditions. Consider the
prodigious vicissitudes of climate during the pleistocene period,
which includes the whole glacial period, and note how little the
specific forms of the inhabitants of the sea have been affected.
<P>
On the theory of descent, the full meaning of the fact of fossil
remains from closely consecutive formations, though ranked as distinct
species, being closely related, is obvious. As the accumulation of
each formation has often been interrupted, and as long blank intervals
have intervened between successive formations, we ought not to expect
to find, as I attempted to show in the last chapter, in any one or two
formations all the intermediate varieties between the species which
appeared at the commencement and close of these periods; but we ought
to find after intervals, very long as measured by years, but only
moderately long as measured geologically, closely allied forms, or, as
they have been called by some authors, representative species; and
these we assuredly do find. We find, in short, such evidence of the
slow and scarcely sensible mutation of specific forms, as we have a
just right to expect to find.
<P>
<H4>On the state of Development of Ancient Forms</H4>
<P>
There has been much discussion whether recent forms are more
highly developed than ancient. I will not here enter on this subject,
for naturalists have not as yet defined to each other's satisfaction
what is meant by high and low forms.  But in one particular sense the
more recent forms must, on my theory, be higher than the more ancient;
for each new species is formed by having had some advantage in the
struggle for life over other and preceding forms. If under a nearly
similar climate, the eocene inhabitants of one quarter of the world
were put into competition with the existing inhabitants of the same or
some other quarter, the eocene fauna or flora would
certainly be beaten and exterminated; as would a secondary fauna by an
eocene, and a palaeozoic fauna by a secondary fauna. I do not doubt
that this process of improvement has affected in a marked and sensible
manner the organisation of the more recent and victorious forms of
life, in comparison with the ancient and beaten forms; but I can see
no way of testing this sort of progress.  Crustaceans, for instance,
not the highest in their own class, may have beaten the highest
molluscs. From the extraordinary manner in which European productions
have recently spread over New Zealand, and have seized on places which
must have been previously occupied, we may believe, if all the animals
and plants of Great Britain were set free in New Zealand, that in the
course of time a multitude of British forms would become thoroughly
naturalized there, and would exterminate many of the natives. On the
other hand, from what we see now occurring in New Zealand, and from
hardly a single inhabitant of the southern hemisphere having become
wild in any part of Europe, we may doubt, if all the productions of
New Zealand were set free in Great Britain, whether any considerable
number would be enabled to seize on places now occupied by our native
plants and animals.  Under this point of view, the productions of
Great Britain, may be said to be higher than those of New Zealand. Yet
the most skilful naturalist from an examination of the species of the
two countries could not have foreseen this result.
<P>
Agassiz insists that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent
the embryos of recent animals of the same classes; or that the
geological succession of extinct forms is in some degree parallel to
the embryological development of recent forms. I must follow Pictet
and Huxley in thinking that the truth of this doctrine is very far
from proved. Yet I fully expect to see it hereafter confirmed, at
least in regard to subordinate groups, which have branched off from
each other within comparatively recent times. For this doctrine of
Agassiz accords well with the theory of natural selection. In a future
chapter I shall attempt to show that the adult differs from its
embryo, owing to variations supervening at a not early age, and being
inherited at a corresponding age. This process, whilst it leaves the
embryo almost unaltered, continually adds, in the course
of successive generations, more and more difference to the adult.
<P>
Thus the embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by
nature, of the ancient and less modified condition of each animal.
This view may be true, and yet it may never be capable of full proof.
Seeing, for instance, that the oldest known mammals, reptiles, and
fish strictly belong to their own proper classes, though some of these
old forms are in a slight degree less distinct from each other than
are the typical members of the same groups at the present day, it
would be vain to look for animals having the common embryological
character of the Vertebrata, until beds far beneath the lowest
Silurian strata are discovered   a discovery of which the chance
is very small.
</P>
<H4>On the Succession of the same Types within the same
areas, during the later tertiary periods</H4>
<P>
Mr Clift many
years ago showed that the fossil mammals from the Australian caves
were closely allied to the living marsupials of that continent. In
South America, a similar relationship is manifest, even to an
uneducated eye, in the gigantic pieces of armour like those of the
armadillo, found in several parts of La Plata; and Professor Owen has
shown in the most striking manner that most of the fossil mammals,
buried there in such numbers, are related to South American types.
This relationship is even more clearly seen in the wonderful
collection of fossil bones made by MM. Lund and Clausen in the caves
of Brazil. I was so much impressed with these facts that I strongly
insisted, in 1839 and 1845, on this `law of the succession of types,'
  on `this wonderful relationship in the same continent between
the dead and the living.' Professor Owen has subsequently extended the
same generalisation to the mammals of the Old World. We see the same
law in this author's restorations of the extinct and gigantic birds of
New Zealand. We see it also in the birds of the caves of Brazil. Mr
Woodward has shown that the same law holds good with sea-shells, but
from the wide distribution of most genera of molluscs, it is not well
displayed by them. Other cases could be added, as the relation between
the extinct and living land-shells of Madeira; and
between the extinct and living brackish-water shells of the
Aralo-Caspian Sea.
<P>
Now what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same
types within the same areas mean? He would be a bold man, who after
comparing the present climate of Australia and of parts of South
America under the same latitude, would attempt to account, on the one
hand, by dissimilar physical conditions for the dissimilarity of the
inhabitants of these two continents, and, on the other hand, by
similarity of conditions, for the uniformity of the same types in each
during the later tertiary periods. Nor can it be pretended that it is
an immutable law that marsupials should have been chiefly or solely
produced in Australia; or that Edentata and other American types
should have been solely produced in South America. For we know that
Europe in ancient times was peopled by numerous marsupials; and I have
shown in the publications above alluded to, that in America the law of
distribution of terrestrial mammals was formerly different from what
it now is. North America formerly partook strongly of the present
character of the southern half of the continent; and the southern half
was formerly more closely allied, than it is at present, to the
northern half. In a similar manner we know from Falconer and Cautley's
discoveries, that northern India was formerly more closely related in
its mammals to Africa than it is at the present time. Analogous facts
could be given in relation to the distribution of marine animals.
<P>
On the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the
long enduring, but not immutable, succession of the same types within
the same areas, is at once explained; for the inhabitants of each
quarter of the world will obviously tend to leave in that quarter,
during the next succeeding period of time, closely allied though in
some degree modified descendants. If the inhabitants of one continent
formerly differed greatly from those of another continent, so will
their modified descendants still differ in nearly the same manner and
degree. But after very long intervals of time and after great
geographical changes, permitting much inter-migration, the feebler
will yield to the more dominant forms, and there will be nothing
immutable in the laws of past and present distribution.
<P>
It may be asked in ridicule, whether I suppose that
the megatherium and other allied huge monsters have left behind them
in South America the sloth, armadillo, and anteater, as their
degenerate descendants. This cannot for an instant be admitted. These
huge animals have become wholly extinct, and have left no progeny. But
in the caves of Brazil, there are many extinct species which are
closely allied in size and in other characters to the species still
living in South America; and some of these fossils may be the actual
progenitors of living species. It must not be forgotten that, on my
theory, all the species of the same genus have descended from some one
species; so that if six genera, each having eight species, be found in
one geological formation, and in the next succeeding formation there
be six other allied or representative genera with the same number of
species, then we may conclude that only one species of each of the six
older genera has left modified descendants, constituting the six new
genera. The other seven species of the old genera have all died out
and have left no progeny.  Or, which would probably be a far commoner
case, two or three species of two or three alone of the six older
genera will have been the parents of the six new genera; the other old
species and the other whole genera having become utterly extinct. In
failing orders, with the genera and species decreasing in numbers, as
apparently is the case of the Edentata of South America, still fewer
genera and species will have left modified blood-descendants.
</P>
<H4>Summary of the preceding and present Chapters</H4> 
<P>
I have attempted to show that the geological record is
extremely imperfect; that only a small portion of the globe has been
geologically explored with care; that only certain classes of organic
beings have been largely preserved in a fossil state; that the number
both of specimens and of species, preserved in our museums, is
absolutely as nothing compared with the incalculable number of
generations which must have passed away even during a single
formation; that, owing to subsidence being necessary for the
accumulation of fossiliferous deposits thick enough to resist future
degradation, enormous intervals of time have elapsed 
between the successive formations; that there has probably been more
extinction during the periods of subsidence, and more variation during
the periods of elevation, and during the latter the record will have
been least perfectly kept; that each single formation has not been
continuously deposited; that the duration of each formation is,
perhaps, short compared with the average duration of specific forms;
that migration has played an important part in the first appearance of
new forms in any one area and formation; that widely ranging species
are those which have varied most, and have oftenest given rise to new
species; and that varieties have at first often been local. All these
causes taken conjointly, must have tended to make the geological
record extremely imperfect, and will to a large extent explain why we
do not find interminable varieties, connecting together all the
extinct and existing forms of life by the finest graduated steps.
<P>
He who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record,
will rightly reject my whole theory. For he may ask in vain where are
the numberless transitional links which must formerly have connected
the closely allied or representative species, found in the several
stages of the same great formation. He may disbelieve in the enormous
intervals of time which have elapsed between our consecutive
formations; he may overlook how important a part migration must have
played, when the formations of any one great region alone, as that of
Europe, are considered; he may urge the apparent, but often falsely
apparent, sudden coming in of whole groups of species. He may ask
where are the remains of those infinitely numerous organisms which
must have existed long before the first bed of the Silurian system was
deposited: I can answer this latter question only hypothetically, by
saying that as far as we can see, where our oceans now extend they
have for an enormous period extended, and where our oscillating
continents now stand they have stood ever since the Silurian epoch;
but that long before that period, the world may have presented a
wholly different aspect; and that the older continents, formed of
formations older than any known to us, may now all be in a
metamorphosed condition, or may lie buried under the ocean.
<P>
Passing from these difficulties, all the other great
leading facts in palaeontology seem to me simply to follow on the
theory of descent with modification through natural selection.  We can
thus understand how it is that new species come in slowly and
successively; how species of different classes do not necessarily
change together, or at the same rate, or in the same degree; yet in
the long run that all undergo modification to some extent. The
extinction of old forms is the almost inevitable consequence of the
production of new forms. We can understand why when a species has once
disappeared it never reappears. Groups of species increase in numbers
slowly, and endure for unequal periods of time; for the process of
modification is necessarily slow, and depends on many complex
contingencies.  The dominant species of the larger dominant groups
tend to leave many modified descendants, and thus new sub-groups and
groups are formed. As these are formed, the species of the less
vigorous groups, from their inferiority inherited from a common
progenitor, tend to become extinct together, and to leave no modified
offspring on the face of the earth. But the utter extinction of a
whole group of species may often be a very slow process, from the
survival of a few descendants, lingering in protected and isolated
situations.  When a group has once wholly disappeared, it does not
reappear; for the link of generation has been broken.
<P>
We can understand how the spreading of the dominant forms of life,
which are those that oftenest vary, will in the long run tend to
people the world with allied, but modified, descendants; and these
will generally succeed in taking the places of those groups of species
which are their inferiors in the struggle for existence. Hence, after
long intervals of time, the productions of the world will appear to
have changed simultaneously.
<P>
We can understand how it is that all the forms of life, ancient and
recent, make together one grand system; for all are connected by
generation. We can understand, from the continued tendency to
divergence of character, why the more ancient a form is, the more it
generally differs from those now living. Why ancient and extinct forms
often tend to fill up gaps between existing forms, sometimes blending
two groups previously classed as distinct into one; but
more commonly only bringing them a little closer together. The more
ancient a form is, the more often, apparently, it displays characters
in some degree intermediate between groups now distinct; for the more
ancient a form is, the more nearly it will be related to, and
consequently resemble, the common progenitor of groups, since become
widely divergent. Extinct forms are seldom directly intermediate
between existing forms; but are intermediate only by a long and
circuitous course through many extinct and very different forms. We
can clearly see why the organic remains of closely consecutive
formations are more closely allied to each other, than are those of
remote formations; for the forms are more closely linked together by
generation: we can clearly see why the remains of an intermediate
formation are intermediate in character.
<P>
The inhabitants of each successive period in the world's history
have beaten their predecessors in the race for life, and are, in so
far, higher in the scale of nature; and this may account for that
vague yet ill-defined sentiment, felt by many palaeontologists, that
organisation on the whole has progressed. If it should hereafter be
proved that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos
of more recent animals of the same class, the fact will be
intelligible. The succession of the same types of structure within the
same areas during the later geological periods ceases to be
mysterious, and is simply explained by inheritance.
<P>
If then the geological record be as imperfect as I believe it to
be, and it may at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved
to be much more perfect, the main objections to the theory of natural
selection are greatly diminished or disappear. On the other hand, all
the chief laws of palaeontology plainly proclaim, as it seems to me,
that species have been produced by ordinary generation: old forms
having been supplanted by new and improved forms of life, produced by
the laws of variation still acting round us, and preserved by Natural
Selection.
