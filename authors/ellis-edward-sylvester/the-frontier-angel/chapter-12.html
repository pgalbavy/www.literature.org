<p><em>AND </em>so it happened that the terrible sentence, "He shall
first be shot and then be burnt in the clearing and cast into
the river," was never executed upon Tom McGable. The opportunity
was never given.</p>

<p>The indignation at his escape could scarcely be repressed; but
the version given by Jenkins so completely exculpated himself
from blame, that he escaped entirely the shafts of indignation.
There were some, it is true, who had their private opinion of
this wonderful story; but, as there was no witness to disprove
it, these opinions were unexpressed.</p>

<p>Jenkins affirmed that what first induced him to peep into the
room was a strong smell of brimstone. Upon looking in, he saw
McGable sitting astride of the devil, who was walking slowly toward
the open door, holding a trident in one claw. Jenkins informed
him that he was very sorry to oppose him, but nevertheless, he
felt compelled by the stern dictates of duty to prevent his passage.
At that, the father of all evil made a rush toward him, striking
him in the breast with the trident, and grappling with him. They
closed in with each other, and the struggle became fearful. Jenkins,
securing the trident, used it as a "whip of scorpions," and was
satisfied he gave some "strange horrors" with it. He believed
he would have eventually triumphed, had he not been taken with
one of his fainting fits at the critical moment. Victory thus
secured, the arch-enemy galloped over his prostrate form, vanished
in mid air, and left McGable skimming over the ground toward the
sheltering wood.</p>

<p>More than one placed implicit faith in this story. Such is the
superstition of the bravest of the brave&mdash;the border ranger!</p>

<p>But there was one thing which troubled the settlement more than
the escape of the renegade: it was the fate of the Frontier Angel.
There was no fear of what the Indians would do, for it was well
known that a crazy or foolish person is regarded among them as
one specially gifted by Manitou, and under no consideration will
they venture to harm him; but it could hardly be expected that
McGable would share in this superstition; and, now that his suspicions
of the friendship of this being to the whites was resolved into
an absolute certainty, some plan, it was rightly thought by the
settlers, would be taken by him to close her lips forever. It
was well known that there was no crime against the human race
too great for the scoundrel to commit; and the weak, defenseless
Frontier Angel, through the stupidity of the whites, would fall
a victim to his vengeance.</p>

<p>"Freeze me to death, ef it shall be so!" exclaimed Dingle, who
was discussing the subject with Peterson, the commander, and several
others. "No, sir; ef that sperit is killed, her blood will be
on us."</p>

<p>"If she is a spirit, she cannot be harmed by mortals," ventured
Abbot.</p>

<p>"Wal, Tom McGable ain't a mortal; he's an infarnal imp."</p>

<p>"Whoever this strange being is, that you term Frontier Angel,"
remarked the commander, "it is evident to all that she is the
firm friend of the whites. The timely warnings which she has so
repeatedly given us, and, in fact, all the settlements along the
Ohio, entitle her to their everlasting gratitude. If she is slain
by McGable, as Dingle observes, the blood will be as much upon
us. For it was ourselves who first told him she was our friend,
and then allowed him to escape to do what he pleased with her.
No, friends, it will never do. Some plan must be taken to warn
her of her peril and afford her all the protection she will receive.
Have you any plan?"</p>

<p>"Kill that renegade and then the matter will be set at rest,"
replied Peterson.</p>

<p>"That is easier said than done," remarked Mansfield. "If I may
be allowed to give an opinion it is this: now that McGable has
been convinced of our deadly enmity to him, and our anxiety to
secure him, he will take particular care never to give us an opportunity.
It will be only in battle where he will be likely to feel our
will in regard to him. This Frontier Angel is still roaming through
the forest, engaged in her truly angelic work of befriending the
whites; and the plan that I propose is this: Let all the settlements
which it is known she visits be notified of the whole circumstances,
and instructed to warn her upon the first opportunity; and, besides
this, let us all try to induce her to abandon the life she is
leading, and to settle down and remain with us."</p>

<p>"Yes, do; tell her I'll marry her if she will," said Jenkins,
all eager seriousness.</p>

<p>"Remember me and she is engaged," said Dingle.</p>

<p>"Didn't Mansfield just say you was going to get her to abandon
savage life and become civilized; consequently, won't she have
to leave you and come to me?"</p>

<p>"There, that will do," interrupted the commander. "The plan proposed
by Mansfield strikes me as being the best, and I am in favor of
adopting it at once."</p>

<p>"It's my opine it's the real thing," said Peterson. "What do
you think, Dick?"</p>

<p>"It's the ticket, and h'yer's as moves we stop talkin' and go
to workin'."</p>

<p>A short time longer was spent in consultation, when the following
course was decided upon: Peterson was to go up the Ohio, and state
the case at the different settlements, all the time seeking an
interview with her, while Dingle and Mansfield were to range the
vicinity of the Indian towns in the hope of meeting her.</p>

<p>This plan, with characteristic vigor, was acted upon at once,
and in the afternoon of the day succeeding the escape of McGable,
the three men were in the forest, seeking out the Frontier Angel.
Dingle and Mansfield as said, took a northwest direction, toward
the Shawnee towns, which they reached in due time. They remained
in their neighborhood several days, and during that time gained
one or two glimpses of McGable, but could see nothing of the being
for whose benefit they came. At last they were satisfied she was
not in them, and must either be in the Sciota valley, or engaged
upon some errand of mercy or&mdash;had she already fallen a victim
to revenge?</p>

<p>Some time after, Dingle and our hero were in the Sciota valley,
carefully reconnoitering the Indian villages, but they obtained
no further information, and were reluctantly compelled to the
belief that she was either at the eastern settlements, or she
had already been murdered by McGable. The latter, as Mansfield
remarked, took such care of his person, that there was little
hope of again obtaining possession of it. Several days were spent
in the neighborhood, without further success, when they turned
their faces homeward, convinced that they had done all that it
was possible for them to do in this direction, although that all
was nothing.</p>

<p>They reached the settlement and reported themselves, and then
all waited anxiously for the return of Peterson. Before going
out all knew the wishes of Abbot, and it was expected that something
definite would be gained of the fate of poor Marian.</p>

<p>It was a week before Peterson came in; but, when he did come,
he had a report to give that thrilled every heart in the settlement.
At the first village he reached, he was told the Frontier Angel
had left there that morning, and that her manner was so wild and
strange as to induce the settlers to use everything except force,
to retain her. From her rambling, incoherent manner, and several
remarks she made, they gathered that her life had already been
attempted by McGable, and that the memory and thoughts of it made
her act so singularly.</p>

<p>From this settlement, he went on to the next, but she had not
been seen here for several weeks. Having been instructed to visit
all of the frontier villages, Peterson did so, but learnt nothing
more of her. From this he supposed that, if not in the Shawnee
towns, she could be at no great distance from the settlement first
mentioned. Accordingly, he spent several days searching the woods
and streams in the hope of obtaining some trace of her. He failed
to find her, but was discovered himself by her.</p>

<p>He had lain down one afternoon to rest himself, and was just
falling into a doze, when he was startled to his feet by her suddenly
appearing before him.</p>

<p>"Are you looking for me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; but, confound it, how did you know it?"</p>

<p>"Do you, too, seek my life?" she asked, gazing at him with the
most painful anguish and terror depicted in her face.</p>

<p>"No; I wouldn't hurt you for ten hundred thousand million pounds
in British money. I'm looking for you to tell you, you must keep
your eyes peeled, 'cause there's sunkthin' in the wind."</p>

<p>There was a wildness in her look which, despite himself, made
Peterson restless and ill at ease, although he took occasion to
show by his words and manner that he had no such thoughts. The
girl stared at him a moment, and then asked:</p>

<p>"You do not want to kill me, then, do you?"</p>

<p>"No; I wouldn't do no such thing, and I would raise the ha'r
of the man that tried it, if he was my own brother."</p>

<p>"He tried to; he shot at me, and chased me with his knife."</p>

<p>"Who did so?"</p>

<p>"That bad man; he is hunting now for me, and wants to kill me."</p>

<p>"Who do you mean? McGable?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was he&mdash;he nearly killed me."</p>

<p>"He may kill you yet. Won't you go with me where he can't hurt
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;no &mdash;I live alone, and God will take care of me."</p>

<p>She turned to depart, and Peterson, who all the time had felt
fidgety and nervous, was glad to be alone, when it suddenly occurred
to him there were several questions which he must yet ask, to
gain the desired information for Abbot and Mansfield. So he called
her back.</p>

<p>"Say, will you let me ax you a thing or two?"</p>

<p>She answered by turning around and silently facing him.</p>

<p>"You know McGable in course, and must know he's the all-firedest
varmint that tramps. Wal, last spring he and a lot of Shawnees
attacked a flat-boat, and sliced 'em all up 'cepting the best-looking
one of the lot&mdash;him as is squatted afore you. Wal, that ain't
much to do with the matter, 'cept to illusrate the point. There
was a gal on board&mdash;that I tried to jump overboard with, but she
got shot just as I was ready, and I left her behind. She wan't
dead <em>then</em>, but about so. Howsumever, her folks never'll
be satisfied till they know all about it. Might be you've heard
of the gal?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the Frontier Angel, shaking her head with a pensive,
saddened look.</p>

<p>"S'pect you did. Sorry, 'cause I'd like to find out. Never heard
McGable say nothin' 'bout her?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Qu'ar. Oh! is that renegade your husband?"</p>

<p>The maiden simply gave him a wondering stare without making a
further reply. Now that Peterson was fairly started, he determined
to learn all he could of her.</p>

<p>"The name of the gal was Marian Abbot," observed the ranger,
suddenly recollecting that he had not mentioned her name. As he
uttered it, his heart fairly stopped beating, at the manner of
the mysterious being before him. She started, her dark eyes opening
so strangely, and her breath coming so short and gaspingly, that
Peterson averred he felt his hair lift his coon-skin cap clean
from his head.</p>

<p>"Marian Abbot&mdash;Marian Abbot &mdash;Marian," she repeated, as
if communing with herself, and gazing, not at Peterson, but over
his head, far away into the horizon where the purple and golden
clouds were then blazing with the fire of heaven.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was her name," said Peterson anxious to help her.
"Splendid looking gal&mdash;looked some like me&mdash;little shorter than
you&mdash;purty near as good looking."</p>

<p>"Marian Abbot &mdash;Marian Abbot," she still repeated, drawing
her hand over her forehead as if engaged in intense thought.</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I've told you that was her name."</p>

<p>"Have I heard of her, you ask? Have I heard of Marian Abbot?&mdash;no&mdash;yes&mdash;let
me see &mdash;I remember. I saw her&mdash;no I know nothing of her!"
she replied, dropping her hands from her forehead, and looking
up at him with the same wild, fiery look.</p>

<p>"Think agin," urged Peterson, much disappointed at her manner.
"You jest now said you remembered her. Put your thinkin' cap on
and p'r'aps you'll find out arter all."</p>

<p>"No; I can't remember anything. Don't ask me to, for it hurts
my head so much. Wait a moment&mdash;" she said, pressing her hand
quickly to her temple again. "Marian Abbot&mdash;yes&mdash;there was such
a girl &mdash;I remember her&mdash;<em>I saw her among the Indians!</em>&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this point, she turned deadly pale, and sank to the earth.
That singularly foolish notion, that it was fatal to touch the
Frontier Angel, prevented Peterson from springing forward to her
assistance. She did not faint, however, but instantly recovered
herself and bounded away in the wood without uttering another
syllable.</p>

<p>This information, conveyed in substance, to the breathless listeners,
by the ranger, thrilled every one, as we said, to the heart. It
awakened, both in the father and Mansfield, a strange hope, that,
from its every intensity, produced a deadly heart-sickness. Abbot
reeled to his home, where, for a long time, he strove to control
his agitation. He said nothing to his wife, for he was nearly
unmanned, and feared he should turn crazy himself.</p>

<p>"O merciful Father! can <em>my daughter be alive</em>? Did she
escape that awful massacre? Is this a dream? Am I going mad? Oh,
grant that no hope may be awakened to be dashed from me again!"</p>

<p>Mansfield was equally excited. The cold sweat came upon his face,
and it seemed as if his heart stood still, and could never recover
its power. It is difficult to conceive of a keener torment&mdash;a
more excruciating agony than that which is produced by the awakening&mdash;the
sudden bringing to life of a long-buried hope. The extremes of
joy and pain are the same, but the culminating point of the latter
is reached, when doubt&mdash;almost and yet not quite <em>uncertainty</em>&mdash;is
a part of the former. It is impossible for a human being to quietly
bear it. Relief must be found in some direction, or the sufferer's
reason will flee.</p>

<p>The painful affliction of Abbot and his wife was known to the
entire settlement, and they had the heartfelt sympathy of every
one. It was believed by all that the wife was dying of a broken
heart. She was silent and remained at home, seeking the society
of no one. She had become pale and fearfully emaciated, seeming
resigned and anxious for the death that was so fast approaching.
Her only desire was to rejoin her sainted child, where no murderer's
hand could ever separate them.</p>

<p>After the father had, in some degree, regained command of himself,
he passed out of the house again, without speaking to his wife,
and made his way back to where a knot of the settlers were discussing
the all-absorbing question. Here he found with <em>painful joy</em>&mdash;for
those two words express exactly his emotion&mdash;that the belief was
quite general that Marian might possibly be alive and a prisoner
among the Indians.</p>

<p>"I tell you it won't be the fust time such a thing has happened,"
remarked Dingle impressively, "there's no tellin' what capers
them Shawnees are up to. In course, there's a powerful heap of
chances that the gal has gone under, but h'yer's as thinks it
ain't noways onpossible that the gal is kickin' yet. Now, Jim
Peterson, tell the truth for once; is you sartin that gal died
when you dropped her on the boat? Mind you're on your oath."</p>

<p>"No, by the eternal, I don't <em>know</em> she is dead, though
I'd swear to it, on the Bible this minute."</p>

<p>"Wall, sir, h'yer's is goin' to the Shawnee towns and findin'
out whether that gal is livin'."</p>

<p>"But," persisted Abbot, who seemed determined to receive no false
basis for his hope, "how can she be there? Have you not been to
all the towns, and had an opportunity of judging. You certainly
would have heard of her before this time."</p>

<p>"No; I don't know as I would. Them Shawnees ar' all the time
up to such tricks that no one can begin to keep track of 'em.
Freeze me, and Lord bless you, man, I don't want to make you think
I am going to find your gal for you and then have her dead all
the time. You must be ready for disappointment."</p>

<p>"I am ready for anything, I trust," faintly replied Abbot, who
felt that he could not survive such a cruel dashing of the cup
of hope from his lips.</p>
