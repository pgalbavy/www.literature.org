The state apartments of the Wind Vane Keeper
would have seemed astonishingly intricate to Graham
had he entered them fresh from his nineteenth century
life, but already he was growing accustomed to the scale
of the new time. They can scarcely be described as
halls and rooms, seeing that a complicated system of
arches, bridges, passages and galleries divided and
united every part of the great space. He came out
through one of the now familiar sliding panels upon a.
plateau of landing at the head of a flight of very broad
and gentle steps, with men and women far more
brilliantly dressed than any he had hitherto seen
ascending and descending. From this position he
looked down a vista of intricate ornament in lustreless
white and mauve and purple, spanned by bridges that
seemed wrought of porcelain and filigree, and terminating 
far off in a cloudy mystery of perforated screens.
<P>
Glancing upward, he saw tier above tier of ascending 
galleries with faces looking down upon him. The
air was full of the babble of innumerable voices and of
a music that descended from above, a gay and exhilarating 
music whose source he never discovered.
<P>
The central aisle was thick with people, but by no
means uncomfortably crowded; altogether that assembly 
must have numbered many thousands. They were
brilliantly, even fantastically dressed, the men as 
fancifully as the women, for the sobering influence of the
Puritan conception of dignity upon masculine dress
had long since passed away. The hair of the men, too,
though it was rarely worn long, was commonly curled
in a manner that suggested the barber, and baldness
had vanished from the earth. Frizzy straight-cut
masses that would have charmed Rossetti abounded,
and one gentleman, who was pointed out to Graham
under the mysterious title of an "amorist", wore his
hair in two becoming plaits a la Marguerite. The
pigtail was in evidence; it would seem that citizens of
Chinese extraction were no longer ashamed of their
race. There was little uniformity of fashion apparent
in the forms of clothing worn. The more shapely
men displayed their symmetry in trunk hose, and
here were puffs and slashes, and there a cloak
and there a robe. The fashions of the days of
Leo the Tenth were perhaps the prevailing influence, 
but the aesthetic conceptions of the far east
were also patent. Masculine embonpoint, which,
in Victorian times, would have been subjected to the
tightly buttoned perils, the ruthless exaggeration of
tight-legged tight-armed evening dress, now formed
but the basis of a wealth of dignity and drooping folds.
Graceful slenderness abounded' also. To Graham, a
typically stiff man from a typically stiff period, not only
did these men seem altogether too graceful in person,
but altogether too expressive in their vividly 
expressive faces. They gesticulated, they expressed surprise,
interest, amusement, above all, they expressed the
emotions excited in their minds by the ladies about
them with astonishing frankness. Even at the first
glance it was evident that women were in a great
majority.
<P>
The ladies in the company of these gentlemen displayed 
in dress, bearing and manner alike, less
emphasis and more intricacy. Some affected a classical 
simplicity of robing and subtlety of fold, after the
fashion of the First French Empire, and flashed 
conquering arms and shoulders as Graham passed.
Others had closely-fitting dresses without seam or belt
at the waist, sometimes with long folds falling from the
shoulders. The delightful confidences of evening
dress had not been diminished by the passage of two
centuries.
<P>
Everyone's movements seemed graceful. Graham
remarked to Lincoln that he saw men as Raphael's 
cartoons walking, and Lincoln told him that the 
attainment of an appropriate set of gestures was part of
every rich person's education. The Master's entry was
greeted with a sort of tittering applause, but these 
people showed their distinguished manners by not 
crowding upon him nor annoying him by any persistent
scrutiny, as he descended the steps towards the floor of
the aisle.
<P>
He had already learnt from Lincoln that these were
the leaders of existing London society; almost every
person there that night was either a powerful official
or the immediate connexion of a powerful official.
Many had returned from the European Pleasure Cities
expressly to welcome him. The aeronautic authorities, 
whose defection had played a part in the overthrow 
of the Council only second to Graham's were
very prominent, and so, too, was the Wind Vane Control. 
Amongst others there were several of the more
prominent officers of the Food Trust; the controller of
the European Piggeries had a particularly melancholy
and interesting countenance and a daintily cynical
manner. A bishop in full canonicals passed athwart
Graham's vision, conversing with a gentleman dressed
exactly like the traditional Chaucer, including even the
laurel wreath.
<P>
"Who is that?" he asked almost involuntarily
<P>
"The Bishop of London," said Lincoln.
<P>
"No--the other, I mean."
<P>
"Poet Laureate."
<P>
"You still?"
<P>
"He doesn't make poetry, of course. He's a cousin
of Wotton--one of the Councillors. But he's one of
the Red Rose Royalists--a delightful club--and they
keep up the tradition of these things."
<P>
"Asano told me there was a King."
<P>
"The King doesn't belong. They had to expel him.
It's the Stuart blood, I suppose; but really--"
<P>
"Too much?"
<P>
"Far too much."
<P>
Graham did not quite follow all this, but it seemed
part of the general inversion of the new age. He
bowed condescendingly to his first introduction. It
was evident that subtle distinctions of class prevailed
even in this assembly, that only to a small proportion
of the guests, to an inner group, did Lincoln consider
it appropriate to introduce him. This first introduction 
was the Master Aeronaut, a man whose suntanned 
face contrasted oddly with the delicate complexions 
about him. Just at present his critical defection 
from the Council made him a very important person indeed.
<P>
His manner contrasted very favourably, according
to Graham's ideas, with the general bearing. He
made a few commonplace remarks, assurances of
loyalty and frank inquiries about the Master's health.
His manner was breezy, his accent lacked the easy
staccato of latter-day English. He made it admirably
clear to Graham that he was a bluff "aerial dog"---he
used that phrase--that there was no nonsense about
him, that he was a thoroughly manly fellow and 
old-fashioned at that, that he didn't profess to know much,
and that what he did not know was not worth knowing
He made a manly bow, ostentatiously free from obsequiousness
and passed.
<P>
"I am glad to see that type endures," said Graham
<P>
"Phonographs and kinematographs," said Lincoln, 
a little spitefully. "He has studied from the life."
Graham glanced at the burly form again. It was oddly
reminiscent.
<P>
"As a matter of fact we bought him," said Lincoln.
"Partly. And partly he was afraid of Ostrog 
Everything rested with him."
<P>
He turned sharply to introduce the 
Surveyor-General of the Public School Trust. This person 
was a willowy figure in a blue-grey academic gown, he
beamed down upon Graham through __pince-nez__ of a
Victorian pattern, and illustrated his remarks by 
gestures of a beautifully manicured hand. Graham was
immediately interested in this gentleman's functions,
and asked him a number of singularly direct questions.
The Surveyor-General seemed quietly amused at the
Master's fundamental bluntness. He was a little
vague as to the monopoly of education his Company
possessed; it was done by contract with the syndicate
that ran the numerous London Municipalities, but he
waxed enthusiastic over educational progress since the
Victorian times. "We have conquered Cram," he
said, "completely conquered Cram--there is not an
examination left in the world. Aren't you glad?"
<P>
"How do you get the work done?" asked Graham.
<P>
"We make it attractive--as attractive as possible.
And if it does not attract then--we let it go. We cover
an immense field."
<P>
He proceeded to details, and they had a lengthy
conversation. The Surveyor-General mentioned the
names of Pestalozzi and Froebel with profound
respect, although he displayed no intimacy with their
epoch-making works. Graham learnt that University
Extension still existed in a modified form. "There is
a certain type of girl, for example," said the Surveyor-
General, dilating with a sense of his usefulness, "with
a perfect passion for severe studies--when they are not
too difficult you know. We cater for them by the
thousand. At this moment," he said with a
Napoleonic touch, "nearly five hundred phonographs
are lecturing in different parts of London on the 
influence exercised by Plato and Swift on the love affairs
of Shelley, Hazlitt, and Burns. And afterwards they
write essays on the lectures, and the names in order of
merit are put in conspicuous places. You see how
your little germ has grown? The illiterate middle-class 
of your days has quite passed away."
<P>
"About the public elementary schools," said
Graham. "Do you control them?"
<P>
The Surveyor-General did, "entirely." Now,
Graham, in his later democratic days, had taken a keen
interest in these and his questioning quickened. Certain 
casual phrases that had fallen from the old man
with whom he had talked in the darkness recurred to
him. The Surveyor-General, in effect, endorsed the
old man's words. "We have abolished Cram," he
said, a phrase Graham was beginning to interpret as
the abolition of all sustained work. The Surveyor-
General became sentimental. "We try and make the
elementary schools very pleasant for the little 
children. They will have to work so soon. Just a few
simple principles--obedience--industry."
<P>
"You teach them very little?"
<P>
"Why should we? It only leads to trouble and discontent. 
We amuse them. Even as it is--there are
troubles--agitations. Where the labourers get the
ideas, one cannot tell. They tell one another. There
are socialistic dreams--anarchy even! Agitators will
get to work among them. I take it--I have always
taken it--that my foremost duty is to fight against 
popular discontent. Why should people be made
unhappy?"
<P>
"I wonder," said Graham thoughtfully. "But there
are a great many things I want to know."
<P>
Lincoln, who had stood watching Graham's face 
throughout the conversation, intervened. "There are
others," he said in an undertone.
<P>
The Surveyor-General of schools gesticulated him-
self away. "Perhaps," said Lincoln, intercepting a
casual glance, " you would like to know some of these
ladies?"
<P>
The daughter of the Manager of the Piggeries of
the European Food Trust was a particularly charming
little person with red hair and animated blue eyes.
Lincoln left him awhile to converse with her, and she
displayed herself as quite an enthusiast for the "dear
old times," as she called them, that had seen the 
beginning of his trance. As she talked she smiled, and her
eyes smiled in a manner that demanded reciprocity.
<P>
"I have tried," she said, "countless times--to
imagine those old romantic days. And to you they
are memories. How strange and crowded the world
must seem to you! I have seen photographs and pictures 
of the old times, the little isolated houses built of
bricks made out of burnt mud and all black with soot
from your fires, the railway bridges, the simple 
advertisements, the solemn savage Puritanical men in
strange black coats and those tall hats of theirs, iron
railway trains on iron bridges overhead, horses and
cattle, and even dogs running half wild about the
streets. And suddenly, you have come into this!"
<P>
"Into this," said Graham.
<P>
"Out of your life--out of all that was familiar."
<P>
"The old life was not a happy one," said Graham.
"I do not regret that."
<P>
She looked at him quickly. There was a brief pause.
She sighed encouragingly. "No? "
<P>
"No," said Graham. "It was a little life--and
unmeaning. But this--. We thought the world
complex and crowded and civilised enough. Yet I see
--although in this world I am barely four days old--
looking back on my own time, that it was a queer, 
barbaric time--the mere beginning of this new order.
The mere beginning of this new order. You will find
it hard to understand how little I know."
<P>
" You may ask me what you like," she said, smiling
at him.
<P>
"Then tell me who these people are. I'm still very
much in the dark about them. It's puzzling. Are
there any Generals? "
<P>
"Men in hats and feathers?"
<P>
"Of course not. No. I suppose they are the men
who control the great public businesses. Who is that
distinguished looking man?"
<P>
"That? He's a most important officer. That is
Morden. He is managing director of the Antibilious
Pill Company. I have heard that his workers sometimes 
turn out a myriad myriad pills a day in the
twenty-four hours. Fancy a myriad myriad!"
<P>
"A myriad myriad. No wonder he looks proud,"
said Graham. "Pills! What a wonderful time it is!
That man in purple?"
<P>
"He is not quite one of the inner circle, you know.
But we like him. He is really clever and very amusing. 
He is one of the heads of the Medical Faculty of
our London University. All medical men, you know,
are shareholders in the Medical Faculty Company,
and wear that purple. You have to be--to be qualified. 
But of course, people who are paid' by fees for
doing something--" She smiled away the social 
pretensions of all such people.
<P>
"Are any of your great artists or authors here?"
<P>
"No authors. They are mostly such queer people--
and so preoccupied about themselves. And they 
quarrel so dreadfully! They will fight, some of them, for
precedence on staircases! Dreadful isn't it? But I
think Wraysbury, the fashionable capillotomist, is
here. From Capri."
<P>
"Capillotomist," said Graham. "Ah! I remember.
An artist! Why not?"
<P>
"We have to cultivate him," she said apologetically.
"Our heads are in his hands." She smiled.
<P>
Graham hesitated at the invited compliment, but his
glance was expressive. "Have the arts grown with
the rest of civilised things?" he said. "Who are your
great painters?"
<P>
She looked at him doubtfully. Then laughed.
"For a moment," she said, "I thought you meant--"
She laughed again. "You mean, of course, those
good men you used to think so much of because they
could cover great spaces of canvas with oil-colours?
Great oblongs. And people used to put the things in
gilt frames and hang them up in rows in their square
rooms. We haven't any. People grew tired of that
sort of thing."
<P>
"But what did you think I meant?"
<P>
She put a finger significantly on a cheek whose glow
was above suspicion, and smiled and looked very arch
and pretty and inviting. "And here," and she 
indicated her eyelid.
<P>
Graham had an adventurous moment. Then a
grotesque memory of a picture he had somewhere
seen of Uncle Toby and the Widow flashed across his
mind. An archaic shame came upon him. He
became acutely aware that he was visible to a great
number of interested people. "I see," he remarked
inadequately. He turned awkwardly away from her,
fascinating facility. He looked about him to meet a
number of eyes that immediately occupied themselves
with other things. Possibly he coloured a little.
"Who is that talking with the lady in saffron?" he
asked, avoiding her eyes.
<P>
The person in question he learnt was one of the
great organisers of the American theatres just fresh
from a gigantic production at Mexico. His face
reminded Graham of a bust of Caligula. Another
striking looking man was the Black Labour Master.
The phrase at the time made no deep impression, but
afterwards it recurred;--the Black Labour Master?
The little lady, in no degree embarrassed, pointed out
to him a charming little woman as one of the 
subsidiary wives of the Anglican Bishop of London. She
added encomiums on the episcopal courage--hitherto
there had been a rule of clerical monogamy--" neither
a natural nor an expedient condition of things. Why
should the natural development of the affections be 
dwarfed and restricted because a man is a priest?"
<P>
"And, bye the bye," she added, "are you an 
Anglican?" Graham was on the verge of hesitating
inquiries about the status of a "subsidiary wife," 
apparently an euphemistic phrase, when Lincoln's return
broke off this very suggestive and interesting conversation. 
They crossed the aisle to where a tall man in
crimson, and two charming persons in Burmese costume 
(as it seemed to him) awaited him diffidently.
From their civilities he passed to other presentations.
<P>
In a little while his multitudinous impressions
began to organise themselves into a general effect. At
first the glitter of the gathering had raised all the 
democrat in Graham; he had felt hostile and satirical. But
it is not in human nature to resist an atmosphere of
courteous regard. Soon the music, the light, the play
of colours, the shining arms and shoulders about him,
the touch of hands, the transient interest of smiling
faces, the frothing sound of skillfully modulated voices,
the atmosphere of compliment, interest and respect,
had woven together into a fabric of indisputable pleasure. 
Graham for a time forgot his spacious resolutions. 
He gave way insensibly to the intoxication of
me position that was conceded him, his manner
became less conscious, more convincingly regal, his
feet walked assuredly, the black robe fell with a bolder
fold and pride ennobled his voice. After all this was
a brilliant interesting world.
<P>
His glance went approvingly over the shifting
colours of the people, it rested here and there in kindly
criticism upon a face. Presently it occurred to him
that he owed some apology to the charming little person 
with the red hair and blue eyes. He felt guilty of
a clumsy snub. It was not princely to ignore her
advances, even if his policy necessitated their rejection. 
He wondered if he should see her again. And
suddenly a little thing touched all the glamour of this
brilliant gathering and changed its quality.
<P>
He looked up and saw passing across a bridge of
porcelain and looking down upon him, a face that was
almost immediately hidden, the face of the girl he had
seen overnight in the little room beyond the theatre
after his escape from the Council. And she was looking 
with much the same expression of curious expectation, 
of uncertain intentness, upon his proceedings.
For the moment he did not remember when he had
seen her, and then with recognition came a vague
memory of the stirring emotions of their first 
encounter. But the dancing web of melody about him kept
the air of that great marching song from his memory.
<P>
The lady to whom he was talking repeated her
remark, and Graham recalled himself to the 
quasiregal flirtation upon which he was engaged.
<P>
But from that moment a vague restlessness, a feeling 
that grew to dissatisfaction, came into his mind.
He was troubled as if by some half forgotten duty, by
the sense of things important slipping from him amidst
this light and brilliance. The attraction that these
bright ladies who crowded about him were beginning
to exercise ceased. He no longer made vague and
clumsy responses to the subtly amorous advances that
he was now assured were being made to him, and his
eyes wandered for another sight of that face that had
appealed so strongly to his sense of beauty. But he
did not see her again until he was awaiting Lincoln's
return to leave this assembly. In answer to his request
Lincoln had promised that an attempt should be made
to fly that afternoon, if the weather permitted. He had
gone to make certain necessary arrangements.
<P>
Graham was in one of the upper galleries in 
conversation with a bright-eyed lady on the subject of
Eadhamite--the subject was his choice and not hers.
He had interrupted her warm assurances of personal
devotion with a matter-of-fact inquiry. He found her,
as he had already found several other latter-day
women that night, less well informed than charming.
Suddenly, struggling against the eddying drift of
nearer melody, the song of the Revolt, the great song
he had heard in the Hall, hoarse and massive, came
beating down to him.
<P>
He glanced up startled, and perceived above him an
__oeil de boeuf__ through which this song had come, and
beyond, the upper courses of cable, the blue haze, and
the pendant fabric of the lights of the public ways. He
heard the song break into a tumult of voices and cease.
But now he perceived quite clearly the drone and
tumult of the moving platforms and a murmur of
many people. He had a vague persuasion that he
could not account for, a sort of instinctive feeling that
outside in the ways a huge crowd' must be watching
this place in which their Master amused himself. He
wondered what they might be thinking.
<P>
Though the song had stopped so abruptly, though
the special music of this gathering reasserted itself, the
motif of the marching song, once it had begun,
lingered in his mind.
<P>
The bright-eyed lady was still struggling with the
mysteries of Eadhamite when he perceived the girl he
had seen in the theatre again. She was coming now
along the gallery towards him; he saw her first before
she saw him. She was dressed in a faintly luminous
grey, her dark hair about her brows was like a cloud,
and as he saw her the cold light from the circular
opening into the ways fell upon her downcast face.
<P>
The lady in trouble about the Eadhamite saw the
change in his expression, and grasped her opportunity
to escape.  Would you care to know that girl, Sire?"
she asked boldly. "She is Helen Wotton--a niece of
Ostrog's. She knows a great many serious things.
She is one of the most serious persons alive. I am
sure you will like her."
<P>
In another moment Graham was talking to the girl,
and the bright-eyed lady had fluttered away.
<P>
"I remember you quite well," said Graham. "You
were in that little room. When all the people were
singing and beating time with their feet. Before I
walked across the Hall."
<P>
Her momentary embarrassment passed. She
looked up at him, and her face was steady. "It was
wonderful," she said, hesitated, and spoke with a 
sudden effort. "All those people would have died for you,
Sire. Countless people did die for you that night."
<P>
Her face glowed. She glanced swiftly aside to see
that no other heard her words.
<P>
Lincoln appeared some way off along the gallery,
making his way through the press towards them. She
saw him and turned to Graham strangely eager, with
a swift change to confidence and intimacy. "Sire,"
she said quickly, "I cannot tell you now and here. But
the common people are very unhappy; they are
oppressed--they are misgoverned. Do not forget the
people, who faced death--death that you might live."
<P>
"I know nothing--" began Graham.
<P>
"I cannot tell you now."
<P>
Lincoln's face appeared close to them. He bowed
an apology to the girl.
<P>
"You find the new world pleasant, Sire?" asked 
Lincoln, with smiling deference, and indicating the space
and splendour of the gathering by one comprehensive
gesture." At any rate, you find it changed."
<P>
"Yes," said Graham, "changed. And yet, after all,
not so greatly changed."
<P>
"Wait till you are in the air," said Lincoln. "The
wind has fallen; even now an aeropile awaits you."
<P>
The girl's attitude awaited dismissal.
<P>
Graham glanced at her face, was on the verge of a
question, found a warning in her expression, bowed to
her and turned to accompany Lincoln.
