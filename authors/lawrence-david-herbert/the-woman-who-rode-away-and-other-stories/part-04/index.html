<article class="w3-container w3-justify">

<p>He had decided to sit up all night, as a kind of penance.  The
telegram had simply said:  &quot;Ophelia's condition critical.&quot;  He
felt, under the circumstances, that to go to bed in the wagon-lit
would be frivolous.  So he sat wearily in the first-class
compartment as night fell over France.</p>

<p>He ought, of course, to be sitting by Ophelia's bedside.  But
Ophelia didn't want him.  So he sat up in the train.</p>

<p>Deep inside him was a black and ponderous weight: like some tumour
filled with sheer gloom, weighing down his vitals.  He had always
taken life seriously.  Seriousness now overwhelmed him.  His dark,
handsome, clean-shaven face would have done for Christ on the
Cross, with the thick black eyebrows tilted in the dazed agony.</p>

<p>The night in the train was like an inferno: nothing was real.  Two
elderly Englishwomen opposite him had died long ago, perhaps even
before he had.  Because, of course, he was dead himself.</p>

<p>Slow, grey dawn came in the mountains of the frontier, and he
watched it with unseeing eyes.  But his mind repeated:</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;And when the dawn came, dim and sad<br />
And chill with early showers,<br />
Her quiet eyelids closed: she had<br />
Another morn than ours.&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>And his monk's changeless, tormented face showed no trace of the
contempt he felt, even self-contempt, for this bathos, as his
critical mind judged it.</p>

<p>He was in Italy: he looked at the country with faint aversion.  Not
capable of much feeling any more, he had only a tinge of aversion
as he saw the olives and the sea.  A sort of poetic swindle.</p>

<p>It was night again when he reached the home of the Blue Sisters,
where Ophelia had chosen to retreat.  He was ushered into the
Mother Superior's room, in the palace.  She rose and bowed to him
in silence, looking at him along her nose.  Then she said in
French:</p>

<p>&quot;It pains me to tell you.  She died this afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p>He stood stupefied, not feeling much, anyhow, but gazing at
nothingness from his handsome, strong-featured monk's face.</p>

<p>The Mother Superior softly put her white, handsome hand on his arm
and gazed up into his face, leaning to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Courage!&quot; she said softly.  &quot;Courage, no?&quot;</p>

<p>He stepped back.  He was always scared when a woman leaned at him
like that.  In her voluminous skirts, the Mother Superior was very
womanly.</p>

<p>&quot;Quite!&quot; he replied in English.  &quot;Can I see her?&quot;</p>

<p>The Mother Superior rang a bell, and a young sister appeared.  She
was rather pale, but there was something na&iuml;ve and mischievous in
her hazel eyes.  The elder woman murmured an introduction, the
young woman demurely made a slight reverence.  But Matthew held out
his hand, like a man reaching for the last straw.  The young nun
unfolded her white hands and shyly slid one into his, passive as a
sleeping bird.</p>

<p>And out of the fathomless Hades of his gloom he thought:  &quot;What a
nice hand!&quot;</p>

<p>They went along a handsome but cold corridor, and tapped at a door.
Matthew, walking in far-off Hades, still was aware of the soft,
fine voluminousness of the women's black skirts, moving with soft,
fluttered haste in front of him.</p>

<p>He was terrified when the door opened, and he saw the candles
burning round the white bed, in the lofty, noble room.  A sister
sat beside the candles, her face dark and primitive, in the white
coif, as she looked up from her breviary.  Then she rose, a sturdy
woman, and made a little bow, and Matthew was aware of creamy-dusky
hands twisting a black rosary, against the rich, blue silk of her
bosom.</p>

<p>The three sisters flocked silent, yet fluttered and very feminine,
in their volumes of silky black skirts, to the bedhead.  The Mother
Superior leaned, and with utmost delicacy lifted the veil of white
lawn from the dead face.</p>

<p>Matthew saw the dead, beautiful composure of his wife's face, and
instantly, something leaped like laughter in the depths of him, he
gave a little grunt, and an extraordinary smile came over his face.</p>

<p>The three nuns, in the candle glow that quivered warm and quick
like a Christmas tree, were looking at him with heavily
compassionate eyes, from under their coif-bands.  They were like a
mirror.  Six eyes suddenly started with a little fear, then
changed, puzzled, into wonder.  And over the three nuns' faces,
helplessly facing him in the candle-glow, a strange, involuntary
smile began to come.  In the three faces, the same smile growing so
differently, like three subtle flowers opening.  In the pale young
nun, it was almost pain, with a touch of mischievous ecstasy.  But
the dark Ligurian face of the watching sister, a mature, level-
browed woman, curled with a pagan smile, slow, infinitely subtle in
its archaic humour.  It was the Etruscan smile, subtle and
unabashed, and unanswerable.</p>

<p>The Mother Superior, who had a large-featured face something like
Matthew's own, tried hard not to smile.  But he kept his humorous,
malevolent chin uplifted at her, and she lowered her face as the
smile grew, grew and grew over her face.</p>

<p>The young, pale sister suddenly covered her face with her sleeve,
her body shaking.  The Mother Superior put her arm over the girl's
shoulder, murmuring with Italian emotion:  &quot;Poor little thing!
Weep, then, poor little thing!&quot;  But the chuckle was still there,
under the emotion.  The sturdy dark sister stood unchanging,
clutching the black beads, but the noiseless smile immovable.</p>

<p>Matthew suddenly turned to the bed, to see if his dead wife had
observed him.  It was a movement of fear.</p>

<p>Ophelia lay so pretty and so touching, with her peaked, dead little
nose sticking up, and her face of an obstinate child fixed in the
final obstinacy.  The smile went away from Matthew, and the look of
super-martyrdom took its place.  He did not weep: he just gazed
without meaning.  Only, on his face deepened the look: I knew this
martyrdom was in store for me!</p>

<p>She was so pretty, so childlike, so clever, so obstinate, so worn - 
and so dead!  He felt so blank about it all.</p>

<p>They had been married ten years.  He himself had not been perfect - 
no, no, not by any means!  But Ophelia had always wanted her own
will.  She had loved him, and grown obstinate, and left him, and
grown wistful, or contemptuous, or angry, a dozen times, and a
dozen times come back to him.</p>

<p>They had no children.  And he, sentimentally, had always wanted
children.  He felt very largely sad.</p>

<p>Now she would never come back to him.  This was the thirteenth
time, and she was gone for ever.</p>

<p>But was she?  Even as he thought it, he felt her nudging him
somewhere in the ribs, to make him smile.  He writhed a little, and
an angry frown came on his brow.  He was not GOING to smile!  He
set his square, naked jaw, and bared his big teeth, as he looked
down at the infinitely provoking dead woman.  &quot;At it again!&quot; - he
wanted to say to her, like the man in Dickens.</p>

<p>He himself had not been perfect.  He was going to dwell on his own
imperfections.</p>

<p>He turned suddenly to the three women, who had faded backwards
beyond the candles, and now hovered, in the white frames of their
coifs, between him and nowhere.  His eyes glared, and he bared his
teeth.</p>

<p>&quot;Mea culpa!  Mea culpa!&quot; he snarled.</p>

<p>&quot;Macch&egrave;!&quot; exclaimed the daunted Mother Superior, and her two hands
flew apart, then together again, in the density of the sleeves,
like birds nesting in couples.</p>

<p>Matthew ducked his head and peered round, prepared to bolt.  The
Mother Superior, in the background, softly intoned a Pater Noster,
and her beads dangled.  The pale young sister faded farther back.
But the black eyes of the sturdy, black-avised sister twinkled like
eternally humorous stars upon him, and he felt the smile digging
him in the ribs again.</p>

<p>&quot;Look here!&quot; he said to the women, in expostulation, &quot;I'm awfully
upset.  I'd better go.&quot;</p>

<p>They hovered in fascinating bewilderment.  He ducked for the door.
But even as he went, the smile began to come on his face, caught by
the tail of the sturdy sister's black eye, with its everlasting
twink.  And, he was secretly thinking, he wished he could hold both
her creamy-dusky hands, that were folded like mating birds,
voluptuously.</p>

<p>But he insisted on dwelling upon his own imperfections.  Mea culpa!
he howled at himself.  And even as he howled it, he felt something
nudge him in the ribs, saying to him:  Smile!</p>

<p>The three women left behind in the lofty room looked at one
another, and their hands flew up for a moment, like six birds
flying suddenly out of the foliage, then settling again.</p>

<p>&quot;Poor thing!&quot; said the Mother Superior, compassionately.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!  Yes!  Poor thing!&quot; cried the young sister, with na&iuml;ve,
shrill impulsiveness.</p>

<p>&quot;Gi&agrave;!&quot; said the dark-avised sister.</p>

<p>The Mother Superior noiselessly moved to the bed, and leaned over
the dead face.</p>

<p>&quot;She seems to know, poor soul!&quot; she murmured.  &quot;Don't you think
so?&quot;</p>

<p>The three coifed heads leaned together.  And for the first time
they saw the faint ironical curl at the corners of Ophelia's mouth.
They looked in fluttering wonder.</p>

<p>&quot;She has seen him!&quot; whispered the thrilling young sister.</p>

<p>The Mother Superior delicately laid the fine-worked veil over the
cold face.  Then they murmured a prayer for the anima, fingering
their beads.  Then the Mother Superior set two of the candles
straight upon their spikes, clenching the thick candle with firm,
soft grip, and pressing it down.</p>

<p>The dark-faced, sturdy sister sat down again with her little holy
book.  The other two rustled softly to the door, and out into the
great white corridor.  There softly, noiselessly sailing in all
their dark drapery, like dark swans down a river, they suddenly
hesitated.  Together they had seen a forlorn man's figure, in a
melancholy overcoat, loitering in the cold distance at the
corridor's end.  The Mother Superior suddenly pressed her pace into
an appearance of speed.</p>

<p>Matthew saw them bearing down on him, these voluminous figures with
framed faces and lost hands.  The young sister trailed a little
behind.</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon, ma M&egrave;re!&quot; he said, as if in the street.  &quot;I left my hat
somewhere. . . .&quot;</p>

<p>He made a desperate, moving sweep with his arm, and never was man
more utterly smileless.</p>
