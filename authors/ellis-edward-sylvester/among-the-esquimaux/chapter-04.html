<p>Jack Cosgrove, of the "Nautilus," was not often agitated by anything
in which he became involved. Few of his perilous calling had gone
through more thrilling experiences than he, and in them all he
had acquired a reputation for coolness that could not be surpassed.</p>

<p>But one of the few occasions that stirred him to the heart was
when hurrying to disembark from the iceberg, in the desperate
hope of reaching the ship before the bursting of the gale and
the closing of night, he found that the little boat had been swept
from its fastenings, and the only means of escape was cut off.</p>

<p>There was more in the incident than occurred to Rob Carrol and
Fred Warburton, who hastened after him. He had been in those latitudes
before, and the reader will recall the story Captain McAlpine
told to the boys of the time Jack was one of three who escaped
from the collision of the whaling ship with an iceberg in the
gloom of a dark night.</p>

<p>Had it been earlier in the day, and had no storm been impending,
he could have afforded to laugh at this mishap, for at the most,
it would have resulted in a temporary inconvenience only. The
skipper would have discovered their plight sooner or later, and
sent another boat to bring them off, but the present case was
a hundred-fold more serious in every aspect.</p>

<p>In the first place, the fierce disturbance of the elements would
compel Captain McAlpine to give all attention to the care of his
ship. That was of more importance than the little party on the
iceberg, who must be left to themselves for the time, since any
effort to reach them would endanger the vessel, the loss of which
meant the loss of everything, including the little company that
found itself in sudden and dire peril.</p>

<p>What might take place during the storm and darkness his imagination
shuddered to picture. Had the boat been found where he left it
a short time before, desperate rowing would have carried them
to the "Nautilus" in time to escape the full force of the storm.
That was impossible now, and as to the future who could say?</p>

<p>The rowboat, as will be remembered, was simply drawn a short
distance up the icy incline, where it ought to have remained until
the return of the party. Such would have been the fact under ordinary
circumstances, for the mighty bulk of the iceberg prevented it
feeling the shock of any disturbance that could take place in
its majestic sweep through the Arctic Ocean, except from its base
striking the bottom of the sea, or a readjustment of its equilibrium,
as they had observed in the case of the smaller berg. It might
crush the "Great Eastern" if it lay in its path, but that would
have been like a wagon passing over an egg-shell.</p>

<p>In leaving the boat as related, the stern lay in the water. Even
then it would have been secure, but for the agitation caused by
the coming gale. That began swaying the rear of the craft, whose
support was so smooth that it speedily worked down the incline
and floating into the open water instantly worked off beyond reach.</p>

<p>The boys knowing so little what all this meant and what was before
them, were disposed to make light of their misfortune.</p>

<p>"By the great horned spoon, but that is bad!" exclaimed Jack,
pointing out on the water, where the boat was seen bobbing on
the rising waves, fully a hundred yards away, with the distance
rapidly increasing.</p>

<p>It seems as if in the few minutes intervening, night had fully
descended. The wind had risen to a gale, and, even at that short
distance the little craft was fast growing indistinct in the gathering
gloom.</p>

<p>"It isn't very pleasant," replied Rob, "but it might be worse."</p>

<p>"I should like to know how it could be worse," said the sailor,
turning reprovingly toward him; "I wonder if I can do it."</p>

<p>The last words were uttered to himself, and he hastily laid down
his gun on the ice by his side. Then he began taking off his outer
coat.</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do?" asked the amazed Fred.</p>

<p>"I believe I can swim out to the boat and bring it back," was
the reply, as he continued preparations.</p>

<p>"You musn't think of such a thing," protested Rob; "the water
is cold enough to freeze you to death. If you can't reach it,
you will have to come back to us, with your clothing frozen stiff,
and nothing will save you from perishing."</p>

<p>"I'll chance that," said Jack, who, however, continued his preparations
more deliberately, and with his eye still on the receding boat.</p>

<p>He was about to take the icy plunge, in the last effort to save
himself and friends, when he stopped, and, straightening up, watched
the craft for a few seconds.</p>

<p>"No," said he, "it can't be done; the thing is drifting faster
than I can swim."</p>

<p>Such was the evident fact. While the vast mass of ice, as has
been explained elsewhere, was under the impulse of a mighty under-current,
the small craft was swept away by the surface current which flowed
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Even while the party looked, the boat faded from sight in the
gloom.</p>

<p>"I can't see it," said Rob, who, like the others, was peering
intently into the darkness.</p>

<p>"Nor I either," added Fred.</p>

<p>"And what's more, you'll never see it again," commented Jack,
who began slowly donning his outer garments; "younkers, I've been
in a good many bad scraps in my life, and more than once would
have sworn I was booked for Davy Jones' locker, but this is a
little the worst of 'em all."</p>

<p>His young friends looked wonderingly at him, unable to understand
the cause of such extreme depression on the part of one whom they
knew to be among the bravest of men, and in a situation that did
not strike them as specially threatening.</p>

<p>"Don't you think this iceberg will hold together until morning?"
asked Rob.</p>

<p>"It'll hold together for months," was the answer, "and like enough
will travel hundreds of miles through the Gulf Stream before it
goes to nothing."</p>

<p>"Then we are sure of a ship to keep us from drowning."</p>

<p>"I aint meaning that," said Jack, who was rapidly recovering
his equanimity, though it was plain he was strongly affected by
the woful turn the adventure had taken.</p>

<p>"And," added Fred, "Captain McAlpine knows where we are; he will
remain in the neighborhood until morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know he will?" broke in Jack, impatiently.</p>

<p>"What's to hinder him?" asked Fred, in turn, startled by the
abrupt question; "he knows how to sail the 'Nautilus,' and has
taken it through many gales worse than this."</p>

<p>"How do you know he has?"</p>

<p>"Gracious, Jack, I don't know anything about it; I am only saying
what appears to me to be the truth."</p>

<p>"I don't want to hurt your feelings, lads, but I can't help saying
you don't know what you're talking about. A couple of young land
lubbers like you don't see things as they show themselves to one
who was born and has lived all his life on the ocean, as you may
say. I don't mean to scare you more than I oughter, but you can
just make up your minds, my hearties, that you never was in such
a fix as this, and if you live to be a hundred years old you'll
never be in another half as bad."</p>

<p>These were alarming words, but, inasmuch as Jack did not accompany
them with any explanation, neither Rob nor Fred were as much impressed
as they would have been had he explained the grounds for his extreme
fear. What they saw was an enforced stay on the iceberg until
the following day. Although in a high latitude, the night was
not unusually long, and, though it was certain to be as uncomfortable
as can well be imagined, they had no doubt they would survive
it and live to laugh at their mishap.</p>
