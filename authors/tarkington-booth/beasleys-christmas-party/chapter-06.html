<p>Autumn trailed the last leaves behind her flying brown robes
one night; we woke to a skurry of snow next morning; and it was
winter. Down-town, along the sidewalks, the merchants set lines
of poles, covered them with evergreen, and ran streamers of green
overhead to encourage the festal shopping. Salvation Army Santa
Clauses stamped their feet and rang bells on the corners, and
pink-faced children fixed their noses immovably to display-windows.
For them, the season of seasons, the time of times, was at hand.</p>

<p>To a certain new reporter on the "Despatch" the stir and gayety
of the streets meant little more than that the days had come when
it was night in the afternoon, and that he was given fewer political
assignments. This was annoying, because Beasley's candidacy for
the governorship had given me a personal interest in the political
situation. The nominating convention of his party would meet in
the spring; the nomination was certain to carry the election also,
and thus far Beasley showed more strength than any other man in
the field. "Things are looking his way,"  said Dowden. "He's always
worked hard for the party; not on the stump, of course," he laughed;
"but the boys understand there are more important things than
speech-making. His record in Congress gave him the confidence
of everybody in the state, and, besides that, people always trust
a quiet man. I tell you if nothing happens he'll get it."</p>

<p>"I'm <em>FER </em>Beasley," another politician explained, in
an interview, "because he's Dave Beasley! Yes, sir, I'm <em>FER
</em>him. You know the boys say if a man is only <em>FOR </em>you,
in this state, there isn't much in it and he may go back on it;
but if he's <em>FER </em>you, he means it. Well, I'm <em>FER </em>Beasley!"</p>

<p>There were other candidates, of course; none of them formidable;
but I was surprised to learn of the existence of a small but energetic
faction opposing our friend in Wainwright, his own town. ("What
are you surprised about?" inquired Dowden. "Don't you know what
our folks are like, <em>YET? </em>If St. Paul lived in Wainwright,
do you suppose he could run for constable without some of his
near neighbors getting out to try and down him?")</p>

<p>The head and front (and backbone, too) of the opposition to Beasley
was a close-fisted, hard-knuckled, risen-from-the-soil sort of
man, one named Simeon Peck. He possessed no inconsiderable influence,
I heard; was a hard worker, and vigorously seconded by an energetic
lieutenant, a young man named Grist. These, and others they had
been able to draw to their faction, were bitterly and eagerly
opposed to Beasley's nomination, and worked without ceasing to
prevent it.</p>

<p>I quote the invaluable Mr. Dowden again: "Grist's against us
because he had a quarrel with a clerk in Beasley's office, and
wanted Beasley to discharge him, and Beasley wouldn't; Sim Peck's
against us out of just plain wrong-headedness, and because he
never was for <em>ANYTHING </em>nor <em>FER </em>anybody in his
life. I had a talk with the old mutton-head the other day; he
said our candidate ought to be a farmer, a 'man of the common
people,' and when I asked him where he'd find anybody more a 'man
of the common people' than Beasley, he said Beasley was 'too much
of a society man' to suit him! The idea of Dave as a 'society
man' was too much for me, and I laughed in Sim Peck's face, but
that didn't stop Sim Peck! 'Jest look at the style he lives in,'
he yelped. 'Ain't he fairly <em>LAPPED </em>in luxury? Look at
that big house he lives in! Look at the way he goes around in
that phaeton of his&mdash;and a nigger to drive him half the time!'
I had to holler again, and, of course, that made Sim twice as
mad as he started out to be; and he went off swearing he'd show
ME, before the campaign was over. The only trouble he and Grist
and that crowd could give us would be by finding out something
against Dave, and they can't do that because there isn't anything
to find out."</p>

<p>I shared his confidence on this latter score, but was somewhat
less sanguine on some others. There were only two newspapers of
any political influence in Wainwright, the "Despatch" and the
"Journal," both operated in the interest of Beasley's party, and
neither had "come out" for him. The gossip I heard about our office
led me to think that each was waiting to see what headway Sim
Peck and his faction would make; the "Journal" especially, I knew,
had some inclination to coquette with Peck, Grist, and Company.
Altogether, their faction was not entirely to be despised.</p>

<p>Thus, my thoughts were a great deal more occupied with Beasley's
chances than with the holiday spirit that now, with furs and bells
and wreathing mists of snow, breathed good cheer over the town.
So little, indeed, had this spirit touched me that, one evening
when one of my colleagues, standing before the grate-fire in the
reporters' room, yawned and said he'd be glad when to-morrow was
over, I asked him what was the particular trouble with to-morrow.</p>

<p>"Christmas," he explained, languidly. "Always so tedious. Like
Sunday."</p>

<p>"It makes me homesick," said another, a melancholy little man
who was forever bragging of his native Duluth.</p>

<p>"Christmas," I repeated&mdash;"to-morrow!"</p>

<p>It was Christmas Eve, and I had not known it! I leaned back in
my chair in sudden loneliness, what pictures coming before me
of long-ago Christmas Eves at home!&mdash;old Christmas Eves when there
was a Tree....</p>

<p>My name was called; the night City Editor had an assignment for
me. "Go up to Sim Peck's, on Madison Street," he said. "He thinks
he's got something on David Beasley, but won't say any more over
the telephone. See what there is in it."</p>

<p>I picked up my hat and coat, and left the office at a speed which
must have given my superior the highest conception of my journalistic
zeal. At a telephone station on the next corner I called up Mrs.
Apperthwaite's house and asked for Dowden.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" I demanded, when his voice had responded.</p>

<p>"Playing bridge," he answered.</p>

<p>"Are you going out anywhere?"</p>

<p>"No. What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you later. I may want to see you before I go back
to the office."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll be here all evening."</p>

<p>I hung up the receiver and made off on my errand.</p>

<p>Down-town the streets were crowded with the package-laden people,
bending heads and shoulders to the bitter wind, which swept a
blinding, sleet-like snow horizontally against them. At corners
it struck so tumultuous a blow upon the chest of the pedestrians
that for a moment it would halt them, and you could hear them
gasping half-smothered "<em>AHS"  </em>like bathers in a heavy
surf. Yet there was a gayety in this eager gale; the crowds pressed
anxiously, yet happily, up and down the street in their generous
search for things to give away. It was not the rich who struggled
through the storm to-night; these were people who carried their
own bundles home. You saw them: toilers and savers, tired mothers
and fathers, worn with the grinding thrift of all the year, but
now for this one night careless of how hard-saved the money, reckless
of everything but the joy of giving it to bring the children joy
on the one great to-morrow. So they bent their heads to the freezing
wind, their arms laden with daring bundles and their hearts uplifted
with the tremulous happiness of giving more than they could afford.
Meanwhile, Mr. Simeon Peck, honest man, had chosen this season
to work harm if he might to the gentlest of his fellow-men.</p>

<p>I found Mr. Peck waiting for me at his house. There were four
other men with him, one of whom I recognized as Grist, a squat
young man with slippery-looking black hair and a lambrequin mustache.
They were donning their coats and hats in the hall when I arrived.</p>

<p>"From the 'Despatch,' hay?" Mr. Peck gave me greeting, as he
wound a knit comforter about his neck. "That's good. We'd most
give you up. This here's Mr. Grist, and Mr. Henry P. Cullop, and
Mr. Gus Schulmeyer&mdash;three men that feel the same way about Dave
Beasley that I do. That other young feller," he waved a mittened
hand to the fourth man&mdash;"he's from the 'Journal.' Likely you're
acquainted."</p>

<p>The young man from the 'Journal' was unknown to me; moreover,
I was far from overjoyed at his presence.</p>

<p>"I've got you newspaper men here," continued Mr. Peck, "because
I'm goin' to show you somep'n' about Dave Beasley that'll open
a good many folk's eyes when it's in print."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" I asked, rather sharply.</p>

<p>"Jest hold your horses a little bit," he retorted. "Grist and
me knows, and so do Mr. Cullop and Mr. Schulmeyer. And I'm goin'
to take them and you two reporters to <em>LOOK </em>at it. All
ready? Then come on."</p>

<p>He threw open the door, stooped to the gust that took him by
the throat, and led the way out into the storm.</p>

<p>"What IS he up to?" I gasped to the "Journal" man as we followed
in a straggling line.</p>

<p>"I don't know any more than you do," he returned. "He thinks
he's got something that'll queer Beasley. Peck's an old fool,
but it's just possible he's got hold of something. Nearly everybody
has <em>ONE </em>thing, at least, that they don't want found out.
It may be a good story. Lord, what a night!"</p>

<p>I pushed ahead to the leader's side. "See here, Mr. Peck&mdash;" I
began, but he cut me off.</p>

<p>"You listen to ME, young man! I'm givin' you some news for your
paper, and I'm gittin' at it my own way, but I'll git AT it, don't
you worry! I'm goin' to let some folks around here know what kind
of a feller Dave Beasley really is; yes, and I'm goin' to show
George Dowden he can't laugh at ME!"</p>

<p>"You're going to show Mr. Dowden?" I said. "You mean you're going
to take him on this expedition, too?"</p>

<p>"<em>TAKE </em>him!" Mr. Peck emitted an acrid bark of laughter.
"I guess HE'S at Beasley's, all right."</p>

<p>"No, he isn't; he's at home&mdash;at Mrs. Apperthwaite's&mdash;playing
cards."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"I happen to know that he'll be there all evening."</p>

<p>Mr. Peck smote his palms together. "Grist!" he called, over his
shoulder, and his colleague struggled forward. "Listen to this:
even Dowden ain't at Beasley's. Ain't the Lord workin' fer us
to-night!"</p>

<p>"Why don't you take Dowden with you," I urged, "if there's anything
you want to show him?"</p>

<p>"By George, I <em>WILL!" </em>shouted Peck. "I've got him where
the hair's short <em>NOW</em>!"</p>

<p>"That's right," said Grist.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen" &mdash;Peck turned to the others&mdash;"when we git to
Mrs. Apperthwaite's, jest stop outside along the fence a minute.
I recken we'll pick up a recruit."</p>

<p>Shivering, we took up our way again in single file, stumbling
through drifts that had deepened incredibly within the hour. The
wind was straight against us, and so stingingly sharp and so laden
with the driving snow that when we reached Mrs. Apperthwaite's
gate (which we approached from the north, not passing Beasley's)
my eyes were so full of smarting tears I could see only blurred
planes of light dancing vaguely in the darkness, instead of brightly
lit windows.</p>

<p>"Now," said Peck, panting and turning his back to the wind; "the
rest of you gentlemen wait out here. You two newspaper men, you
come with me."</p>

<p>He opened the gate and went in, the "Journal" reporter and I
following&mdash;all three of us wiping our half-blinded eyes. When
we reached the shelter of the front porch, I took the key from
my pocket and opened the door.</p>

<p>"I live here," I explained to Mr. Peck.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "Jest step in and tell George Dowden that
Sim Peck's out here and wants to see him at the door a minute.
Be quick."</p>

<p>I went into the library, and there sat Dowden contemplatively
playing bridge with two of the elderly ladies and Miss Apperthwaite.
The last-mentioned person quite took my breath away.</p>

<p>In honor of the Christmas Eve (I supposed) she wore an evening
dress of black lace, and the only word for what she looked has
suffered such misuse that one hesitates over it: yet that is what
she was&mdash;regal&mdash;and no less! There was a sort of splendor about
her. It detracted nothing from this that her expression was a
little sad: something not uncommon with her lately; a certain
melancholy, faint but detectable, like breath on a mirror. I had
attributed it to Jean Valjean, though perhaps to-night it might
have been due merely to bridge.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Dowden, when, after an apology for disturbing
the game, I had drawn him out in the hall.</p>

<p>I motioned toward the front door. "Simeon Peck. He thinks he's
got something on Mr. Beasley. He's waiting to see you."</p>

<p>Dowden uttered a sharp, half-coherent exclamation and stepped
quickly to the door. "Peck!" he said, as he jerked it open.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm here!" declared that gentleman, stepping into view.
"I've come around to let you know that you couldn't laugh like
a horse at ME no more, George Dowden! So <em>YOU </em>weren't
invited, either."</p>

<p>"Invited?" said Dowden, "Where?"</p>

<p>"Over to the <em>BALL </em>your friend is givin'."</p>

<p>"What friend?"</p>

<p>"Dave Beasley. So you ain't quite good enough to dance with his
high-society friends!"</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" Dowden demanded, impatiently.</p>

<p>"I reckon you won't be quite so strong fer Beasley," responded
Peck, with a vindictive little giggle, "when you find he can use
you in his <em>BUSINESS, </em>but when it comes to <em>ENTERTAININ'&mdash;</em>oh
no, you ain't quite the boy!"</p>

<p>"I'd appreciate your explaining," said Dowden. "It's kind of
cold standing here."</p>

<p>Peck laughed shrilly. "Then I reckon you better git your hat
and coat and come along. Can't do US no harm, and might be an
eye-opener fer <em>YOU. </em>Grist and Gus Schulmeyer and Hank
Cullop's waitin' out yonder at the gate. We be'n havin' kind of
a consultation at my house over somep'n' Grist seen at Beasley's
a little earlier in the evening."</p>

<p>"What did Grist see?"</p>

<p>"<em>HACKS! </em>Hacks drivin' up to Beasley's house&mdash;a whole
lot of 'em. Grist was down the street a piece, and it was pretty
dark, but he could see the lamps and hear the doors slam as the
people got out. Besides, the whole place is lit up from cellar
to attic. Grist come on to my house and told me about it, and
I begun usin' the telephone; called up all the men that <em>COUNT
</em>in the party&mdash;found most of 'em at home, too. I ast 'em if
they was invited to this ball to-night; and not a one of 'em was.
<em>THEY'RE </em>only in politics; they ain't high <em>SOCIETY
</em>enough to be ast to Mr. Beasley's dancin'-parties! But I
<em>WOULD '</em>a' thought he'd let <em>YOU </em>in &mdash;<em>ANYWAYS
</em>fer the second table!" Mr. Peck shrilled out his acrid and
exultant laugh again. "I got these fellers from the newspapers,
and all I want is to git this here ball in print to-morrow, and
see what the boys that do the work at the primaries have to say
about it&mdash;and what their <em>WIVES'</em>ll say about the man that's
too high-toned to have 'em in his house. I'll bet Beasley thought
he was goin' to keep these doin's quiet; afraid the farmers might
not believe he's jest the plain man he sets up to be&mdash;afraid that
folks like you that ain't invited might turn against him. I'LL
fool him! We're goin' to see what there is to see, and I'm goin'
to have these boys from the newspapers write a full account of
it. If you want to come along, I expect it'll do you a power o'
good."</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Dowden, quickly. He got his coat and hat from
a table in the hall, and we rejoined the huddled and shivering
group at the gate.</p>

<p>"Got my recruit, gents!" shrilled Peck, slapping Dowden boisterously
on the shoulders. "I reckon he'll git a change of heart to-night!"</p>

<p>And now, sheltering my eyes from the stinging wind, I saw what
I had been too blind to see as we approached Mrs. Apperthwaite's.
Beasley's house <em>WAS </em>illuminated; every window, up stairs
and down, was aglow with rosy light. That was luminously evident,
although the shades were lowered.</p>

<p>"Look at that!" Peck turned to Dowden, giggling triumphantly.
"Wha'd I tell you! How do you feel about it <em>NOW</em>?"</p>

<p>"But where are the hacks?" asked Dowden, gravely.</p>

<p>"Folks all come," answered Mr. Peck, with complete assurance.
"Won't be no more hacks till they begin to go home."</p>

<p>We plunged ahead as far as the corner of Beasley's fence, where
Peck stopped us again, and we drew together, slapping our hands
and stamping our feet. Peck was delighted&mdash;a thoroughly happy
man; his sour giggle of exultation had become continuous, and
the same jovial break was audible in Grist's voice as he said
to the "Journal" reporter and me:</p>

<p>"Go ahead, boys. Git your story. We'll wait here fer you."</p>

<p>The "Journal" reporter started toward the gate; he had gone,
perhaps, twenty feet when Simeon Peck whistled in sharp warning.
The reporter stopped short in his tracks.</p>

<p>Beasley's front door was thrown open, and there stood Beasley
himself in evening dress, bowing and smiling, but not at us, for
he did not see us. The bright hall behind him was beautiful with
evergreen streamers and wreaths, and great flowering plants in
jars. A strain of dance-music wandered out to us as the door opened,
but there was nobody except David Beasley in sight, which certainly
seemed peculiar&mdash;for a ball!</p>

<p>"Rest of 'em inside, dancin'," explained Mr. Peck, crouching
behind the picket-fence. "I'll bet the house is more'n half full
o' low-necked wimmin!"</p>

<p>"Sh!" said Grist. "Listen."</p>

<p>Beasley had begun to speak, and his voice, loud and clear, sounded
over the wind. "Come right in, Colonel!" he said. "I'd have sent
a carriage for you if you hadn't telephoned me this afternoon
that your rheumatism was so bad you didn't expect to be able to
come. I'm glad you're well again. Yes, they're all here, and the
ladies are getting up a quadrille in the sitting-room."</p>

<p>(It was at this moment that I received upon the calf of the right
leg a kick, the ecstatic violence of which led me to attribute
it to Mr. Dowden.)</p>

<p>"Gentlemen's dressing-room up-stairs to the right, Colonel,"
called Beasley, as he closed the door.</p>

<p>There was a pause of awed silence among us.</p>

<p>(I improved it by returning the kick to Mr. Dowden. He made no
acknowledgment of its reception other than to sink his chin a
little deeper into the collar of his ulster.)</p>

<p>"By the Almighty!" said Simeon Peck, hoarsely. "Who &mdash;<em>WHAT
</em>was Dave Beasley talkin' to? There wasn't nobody <em>THERE</em>!"</p>

<p>"Git out," Grist bade him; but his tone was perturbed. "He seen
that reporter. He was givin' us the laugh."</p>

<p>"He's crazy!" exclaimed Peck, vehemently.</p>

<p>Immediately all four members of his party began to talk at the
same time: Mr. Schulmeyer agreeing with Grist, and Mr. Cullop
holding with Peck that Beasley had surely become insane; while
the "Journal" man, returning, was certain that he had not been
seen. Argument became a wrangle; excitement over the remarkable
scene we had witnessed, and, perhaps, a certain sharpness partially
engendered by the risk of freezing, led to some bitterness. High
words were flung upon the wind. Eventually, Simeon Peck got the
floor to himself for a moment.</p>

<p>"See here, boys, there's no use gittin' mad amongs' ourselves,"
he vociferated. "One thing we're all agreed on: nobody here never
seen no such a dam peculiar performance as WE jest seen in their
whole lives before. THURfore, ball or NO ball, there's somep'n'
mighty wrong about this business. Ain't that so?"</p>

<p>They said it was.</p>

<p>"Well, then, there's only one thing to do&mdash;let's find out what
it is."</p>

<p>"You bet we will."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't send no one in there alone," Peck went on, excitedly,
"with a crazy man. Besides, I want to see what's goin' on, myself."&mdash;"So
do we!" This was unanimous.</p>

<p>"Then let's see if there ain't some way to do it. Perhaps he
ain't pulled all the shades down on the other side the house.
Lots o' people fergit to do that."</p>

<p>There was but one mind in the party regarding this proposal.
The next minute saw us all cautiously sneaking into the side yard,
a ragged line of bent and flapping figures, black against the
snow.</p>

<p>Simeon Peck's expectations were fulfilled&mdash;more than fulfilled.
Not only were all the shades of the big, three-faced bay-window
of the "sitting-room" lifted, but (evidently on account of the
too great generosity of a huge log-fire that blazed in the old-fashioned
chimney-place) one of the windows was half-raised as well. Here,
in the shadow just beyond the rosy oblongs of light that fell
upon the snow, we gathered and looked freely within.</p>

<p>Part of the room was clear to our view, though about half of
it was shut off from us by the very king of all Christmas-trees,
glittering with dozens and dozens of candles, sumptuous in silver,
sparkling in gold, and laden with Heaven alone knows how many
and what delectable enticements. Opposite the Tree, his back against
the wall, sat old Bob, clad in a dress of state, part of which
consisted of a swallow-tail coat (with an overgrown chrysanthemum
in the buttonhole), a red necktie, and a pink-and-silver liberty
cap of tissue-paper. He was scraping a fiddle "like old times
come again," and the tune he played was, "Oh, my Liza, po' gal!"
My feet shuffled to it in the snow.</p>

<p>No one except old Bob was to be seen in the room, but we watched
him and listened breathlessly. When he finished "Liza," he laid
the fiddle across his knee, wiped his face with a new and brilliant
blue silk handkerchief, and said:</p>

<p>"Now come de big speech."</p>

<p>The Honorable David Beasley, carrying a small mahogany table,
stepped out from beyond the Christmas-tree, advanced to the centre
of the room; set the table down; disappeared for a moment and
returned with a white water-pitcher and a glass. He placed these
upon the table, bowed gracefully several times, then spoke:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;" There he paused.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Simeon Peck, slowly, "don't this beat hell!"</p>

<p>"Look out!" The "Journal" reporter twitched his sleeve. "Ladies
present."</p>

<p>"Where?" said I.</p>

<p>He leaned nearer me and spoke in a low tone. "Just behind us.
She followed us over from your boarding-house. She's been standing
around near us all along. I supposed she was Dowden's daughter,
probably."</p>

<p>"He hasn't any daughter," I said, and stepped back to the hooded
figure I had been too absorbed in our quest to notice.</p>

<p>It was Miss Apperthwaite.</p>

<p>She had thrown a loose cloak over her head and shoulders; but
enveloped in it as she was, and crested and epauletted with white,
I knew her at once. There was no mistaking her, even in a blizzard.</p>

<p>She caught my hand with a strong, quick pressure, and, bending
her head to mine, said, close to my ear:</p>

<p>"I heard everything that man said in our hallway. You left the
library door open when you called Mr. Dowden out."</p>

<p>"So," I returned, maliciously, "you&mdash;you couldn't <em>HELP </em>following!"</p>

<p>She released my hand&mdash;gently, to my surprise.</p>

<p>"Hush," she whispered. "He's saying something."</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," said Beasley again&mdash;and stopped again.</p>

<p>Dowden's voice sounded hysterically in my right ear. (Miss Apperthwaite
had whispered in my left.) "The only speech he's ever made in
his life&mdash;and he's stuck!"</p>

<p>But Beasley wasn't: he was only deliberating.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he began&mdash;"Mr. and Mrs. Hunchberg, Colonel
Hunchberg and Aunt Cooley Hunchberg, Miss Molanna, Miss Queen,
and Miss Marble Hunchberg, Mr. Noble, Mr. Tom, and Mr. Grandee
Hunchberg, Mr. Corley Linbridge, and Master Hammersley: &mdash;You
see before you to-night, my person, merely the representative
of your real host. <em>MISTER </em>Swift. Mister Swift has expressed
a wish that there should be a speech, and has deputed me to make
it. He requests that the subject he has assigned me should be
treated in as dignified a manner as is possible&mdash;considering the
orator. Ladies and gentlemen"&mdash;he took a sip of water&mdash;"I will
now address you upon the following subject: 'Why we Call Christmas-time
the Best Time.'</p>

<p>"Christmas-time is the best time because it is the kindest time.
Nobody ever felt very happy without feeling very kind, and nobody
ever felt very kind without feeling at least a <em>LITTLE </em>happy.
So, of course, either way about, the happiest time is the kindest
time&mdash;that's <em>THIS </em>time. The most beautiful things our
eyes can see are the stars; and for that reason, and in remembrance
of One star, we set candles on the Tree to be stars in the house.
So we make Christmas-time a time of stars indoors; and they shine
warmly against the cold outdoors that is like the cold of other
seasons not so kind. We set our hundred candles on the Tree and
keep them bright throughout the Christmas-time, for while they
shine upon us we have light to see this life, not as a battle,
but as the march of a mighty Fellowship! Ladies and gentlemen,
I thank you!"</p>

<p>He bowed to right and left, as to an audience politely applauding,
and, lifting the table and its burden, withdrew; while old Bob
again set his fiddle to his chin and scraped the preliminary measures
of a quadrille.</p>

<p>Beasley was back in an instant, shouting as he came: "<em>TAKE
</em>your pardners! Balance <em>ALL</em>!"</p>

<p>And then and there, and all by himself, he danced a quadrille,
performing at one and the same time for four lively couples. Never
in my life have I seen such gyrations and capers as were cut by
that long-legged, loose-jointed, miraculously flying figure. He
was in the wildest motion without cessation, never the fraction
of an instant still; calling the figures at the top of his voice
and dancing them simultaneously; his expression anxious but polite
(as is the habit of other dancers); his hands extended as if to
swing his partner or corner, or "opposite lady"; and his feet
lifting high and flapping down in an old-fashioned step. "<em>FIRST
</em>four, forward and back!" he shouted. "Forward and <em>SALUTE!
BALANCE </em>to corners! <em>SWING </em>pardners! <em>GR-R-RAND
</em>Right-and-Left!"</p>

<p>I think the combination of abandon and decorum with which he
performed that "Grand Right-and-Left" was the funniest thing I
have ever seen. But I didn't laugh at it.</p>

<p>Neither did Miss Apperthwaite.</p>

<p>"<em>NOW </em>do you believe me?" Peck was arguing, fiercely,
with Mr. Schulmeyer. "Is he crazy, or ain't he?"</p>

<p>"He is," Grist agreed, hoarsely. "He is a stark, starin', ravin',
roarin' lunatic! And the nigger's humorin' him!"</p>

<p>They were all staring, open-mouthed and aghast, into the lighted
room.</p>

<p>"Do you see where it puts US?" Simeon Peck's rasping voice rose
high.</p>

<p>"I guess I do!" said Grist. "We come out to buy a barn, and got
a house and lot fer the same money. It's the greatest night's
work you ever done, Sim Peck!"</p>

<p>"I guess it is!"</p>

<p>"Shake on it, Sim."</p>

<p>They shook hands, exalted with triumph.</p>

<p>"This'll do the work," giggled Peck. "It's about two-thousand
per cent. better than the story we started to git. Why, Dave Beasley'll
be in a padded cell in a month! It'll be all over town to-morrow,
and he'll have as much chance fer governor as that nigger in there!"
In his ecstasy he smote Dowden deliriously in the ribs. "What
do you think of your candidate <em>NOW</em>?"</p>

<p>"Wait," said Dowden. "Who came in the hacks that Grist saw?"</p>

<p>This staggered Mr. Peck. He rubbed his mitten over his woollen
cap as if scratching his head. "Why," he said, slowly&mdash;"who in
Halifax <em>DID </em>come in them hacks?"</p>

<p>"The Hunchbergs," said I.</p>

<p>"Who's the Hunchbergs? Where&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen," said Dowden.</p>

<p>"<em>FIRST </em>couple, <em>FACE </em>out!" shouted Beasley,
facing out with an invisible lady on his akimboed arm, while old
Bob sawed madly at A New Coon in Town.</p>

<p>"<em>SECOND </em>couple, <em>FALL </em>in!" Beasley wheeled about
and enacted the second couple.</p>

<p>"<em>THIRD </em>couple!" He fell in behind himself again.</p>

<p>"<em>FOURTH </em>couple, IF you please! <em>BALANCE&mdash;ALL! &mdash;</em>I
beg your pardon, Miss Molanna, I'm afraid I stepped on your train.
&mdash;<em>SASHAY ALL</em>!"</p>

<p>After the "sashay"&mdash;the noblest and most dashing bit of gymnastics
displayed in the whole quadrille&mdash;he bowed profoundly to his invisible
partner and came to a pause, wiping his streaming face. Old Bob
dexterously swung A New Coon into the stately measures of a triumphal
march.</p>

<p>"And now," Beasley announced, in stentorian tones, "if the ladies
will be so kind as to take the gentlemen's arms, we will proceed
to the dining-room and partake of a slight collation."</p>

<p>Thereupon came a slender piping of joy from that part of the
room screened from us by the Tree.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cousin David Beasley, that was the <em>BEAUTIFULLEST </em>quadrille
ever danced in the world! And, please, won't <em>YOU </em>take
Mrs. Hunchberg out to supper?"</p>

<p>Then into the vision of our paralyzed and dumfounded watchers
came the little wagon, pulled by the old colored woman, Bob's
wife, in her best, and there, propped upon pillows, lay Hamilton
Swift, Junior, his soul shining rapture out of his great eyes,
a bright spot of color on each of his thin cheeks. He lifted himself
on one elbow, and for an instant something seemed to be wrong
with the brace under his chin.</p>

<p>Beasley sprang to him and adjusted it tenderly. Then he bowed
elaborately toward the mantel-piece.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hunchberg," he said, "may I have the honor?" And offered
his arm.</p>

<p>"And I must have <em>MISTER </em>Hunchberg," chirped Hamilton.
"He must walk with me."</p>

<p>"He tells ME," said Beasley, "he'll be mighty glad to. And there's
a plate of bones for Simpledoria."</p>

<p>"You lead the way," cried the child; "you and Mrs. Hunchberg."</p>

<p>"Are we all in line?" Beasley glanced back over his shoulder.
"<em>HOO-</em>ray! Now, let us on. Ho! there!"</p>

<p>"<em>BR-R-RA-</em>vo!" applauded Mister Swift.</p>

<p>And Beasley, his head thrown back and his chest out, proudly
led the way, stepping nobly and in time to the exhilarating measures.
Hamilton Swift, Junior, towed by the beaming old mammy, followed
in his wagon, his thin little arm uplifted and his fingers curled
as if they held a trusted hand.</p>

<p>When they reached the door, old Bob rose, turned in after them,
and, still fiddling, played the procession and himself down the
hall.</p>

<p>And so they marched away, and we were left staring into the empty
room....</p>

<p>"My soul!" said the "Journal" reporter, gasping. "And he did
all <em>THAT&mdash;</em>just to please a little sick kid!"</p>

<p>"I can't figure it out," murmured Sim Peck, piteously.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> can," said the "Journal" reporter. "This story <em>WILL
</em>be all over town to-morrow." He glanced at me, and I nodded.
"It'll be all over town," he continued, "though not in any of
the papers&mdash;and I don't believe it's going to hurt Dave Beasley's
chances any."</p>

<p>Mr. Peck and his companions turned toward the street; they went
silently.</p>

<p>The young man from the "Journal" overtook them. "Thank you for
sending for me," he said, cordially. "You've given me a treat.
I'm <em>FER </em>Beasley!"</p>

<p>Dowden put his hand on my shoulder. He had not observed the third
figure still remaining.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," he remarked, shaking the snow from his coat, "they
were right about one thing: it certainly was mighty low down of
Dave not to invite <em>ME&mdash;</em>and you, too&mdash;to his Christmas
party. Let him go to thunder with his old invitations, I'm going
in, anyway! Come on. I'm plum froze."</p>

<p>There was a side door just beyond the bay-window, and Dowden
went to it and rang, loud and long. It was Beasley himself who
opened it.</p>

<p>"What in the name&mdash;" he began, as the ruddy light fell upon Dowden's
face and upon me, standing a little way behind. "What <em>ARE
</em>you two&mdash;snow-banks? What on earth are you fellows doing
out here?"</p>

<p>"We've come to your Christmas party, you old horse-thief!" Thus
Mr. Dowden.</p>

<p>"<em>HOO-</em>ray!" said Beasley.</p>

<p>Dowden turned to me. "Aren't you coming?"</p>

<p>"What are you waiting for, old fellow?" said Beasley.</p>

<p>I waited a moment longer, and then it happened.</p>

<p>She came out of the shadow and went to the foot of the steps,
her cloak falling from her shoulders as she passed me. I picked
it up.</p>

<p>She lifted her arms pleadingly, though her head was bent with
what seemed to me a beautiful sort of shame. She stood there with
the snow driving against her and did not speak. Beasley drew his
hand slowly across his eyes&mdash;to see if they were really there,
I think.</p>

<p>"David," she said, at last. "You've got so many lovely people
in your house to-night: isn't there room for&mdash;for just one fool?
It's Christmas-time!"</p>
