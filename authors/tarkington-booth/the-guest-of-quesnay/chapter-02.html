<p>Ward is a portrait-painter, and in the matter of vogue there
seem to be no pinnacles left for him to surmount. I think he has
painted most of the very rich women of fashion who have come to
Paris of late years, and he has become so prosperous, has such
a polite celebrity, and his opinions upon art are so conclusively
quoted, that the friendship of some of us who started with him
has been dangerously strained.</p>

<p>He lives a well-ordered life; he has always led that kind of
life. Even in his student days when I first knew him, I do not
remember an occasion upon which the principal of a New England
high-school would have criticised his conduct. And yet I never
heard anyone call him a prig; and, so far as I know, no one was
ever so stupid as to think him one. He was a quiet, good-looking,
well-dressed boy, and he matured into a somewhat reserved, well-poised
man, of impressive distinction in appearance and manner. He has
always been well tended and cared for by women; in his student
days his mother lived with him; his sister, Miss Elizabeth, looks
after him now. She came with him when he returned to Paris after
his disappointment in the unfortunate Harman affair, and she took
charge of all his business&mdash;as well as his social&mdash;arrangements
(she has been accused of a theory that the two things may be happily
combined), making him lease a house in an expensively modish quarter
near the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne. Miss Elizabeth is an instinctively
fashionable woman, practical withal, and to her mind success should
be not only respectable but "smart." She does not speak of the
"right bank" and the "left bank" of the Seine; she calls them
the "right bank" and the "wrong bank." And yet, though she removed
George (her word is "rescued") from many of his old associations
with Montparnasse, she warmly encouraged my friendship with him&mdash;yea,
in spite of my living so deep in the wrong bank that the first
time he brought her to my studio, she declared she hadn't seen
anything so like Bring-the-child-to-the-old-hag's-cellar-at-midnight
since her childhood. She is a handsome woman, large, and of a
fine, high colour; her manner is gaily dictatorial, and she and
I got along very well together.</p>

<p>Probably she appreciated my going to some pains with the clothes
I wore when I went to their house. My visits there were infrequent,
not because I had any fear of wearing out a welcome, but on account
of Miss Elizabeth's "day," when I could see nothing of George
for the crowd of lionising women and time-wasters about him. Her
"day" was a dread of mine; I could seldom remember which day it
was, and when I did she had a way of shifting it so that I was
fatally sure to run into it&mdash;to my misery, for, beginning with
those primordial indignities suffered in youth, when I was scrubbed
with a handkerchief outside the parlour door as a preliminary
to polite usages, my childhood's, manhood's prayer has been: From
all such days, Good Lord, deliver me!</p>

<p>It was George's habit to come much oftener to see me. He always
really liked the sort of society his sister had brought about
him; but now and then there were intervals when it wore on him
a little, I think. Sometimes he came for me in his automobile
and we would make a mild excursion to breakfast in the country;
and that is what happened one morning about three weeks after
the day when we had sought pure air in the Luxembourg gardens.</p>

<p>We drove out through the Bois and by Suresnes, striking into
a roundabout road to Versailles beyond St. Cloud. It was June,
a dustless and balmy noon, the air thinly gilded by a faint haze,
and I know few things pleasanter than that road on a fair day
of the early summer and no sweeter way to course it than in an
open car; though I must not be giving myself out for a "motorist"
&mdash;I have not even the right cap. I am usually nervous in
big machines, too; but Ward has never caught the speed mania and
holds a strange power over his chauffeur; so we rolled along peacefully,
not madly, and smoked (like the car) in hasteless content.</p>

<p>"After all," said George, with a placid wave of the hand, "I
sometimes wish that the landscape had called me. You outdoor men
have all the health and pleasure of living in the open, and as
for the work&mdash;oh! you fellows think you work, but you don't know
what it means."</p>

<p>"No?" I said, and smiled as I always meanly do when George "talks
art." He was silent for a few moments and then said irritably,</p>

<p>"Well, at least you can't deny that the academic crowd can <em>DRAW</em>!"</p>

<p>Never having denied it, though he had challenged me in the same
way perhaps a thousand times, I refused to deny it now; whereupon
he returned to his theme: "Landscape is about as simple as a stage
fight; two up, two down, cross and repeat. Take that ahead of
us. Could anything be simpler to paint?"</p>

<p>He indicated the white road running before us between open fields
to a curve, where it descended to pass beneath an old stone culvert.
Beyond, stood a thick grove with a clear sky flickering among
the branches. An old peasant woman was pushing a heavy cart round
the curve, a scarlet handkerchief knotted about her head.</p>

<p>"You think it's easy?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Easy! Two hours ought to do it as well as it could be done&mdash;at
least, the way you fellows do it!" He clenched his fingers as
if upon the handle of a house-painter's brush. "Slap, dash&mdash;there's
your road." He paddled the air with the imaginary brush as though
painting the side of a barn. "Swish, swash&mdash;there go your fields
and your stone bridge. Fit! Speck! And there's your old woman,
her red handkerchief, and what your dealer will probably call
'the human interest,' all complete. Squirt the edges of your foliage
in with a blow-pipe. Throw a cup of tea over the whole, and there's
your haze. Call it 'The Golden Road,' or 'The Bath of Sunlight,'
or 'Quiet Noon.' Then you'll probably get a criticism beginning,
'Few indeed have more intangibly detained upon canvas so poetic
a quality of sentiment as this sterling landscapist, who in Number
136 has most ethereally expressed the profound silence of evening
on an English moor. The solemn hush, the brooding quiet, the homeward
ploughman&mdash;'"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by an outrageous uproar, the grisly scream
of a siren and the cannonade of a powerful exhaust, as a great
white touring-car swung round us from behind at a speed that sickened
me to see, and, snorting thunder, passed us "as if we had been
standing still."</p>

<p>It hurtled like a comet down the curve and we were instantly
choking in its swirling tail of dust.</p>

<p>"Seventy miles an hour!" gasped George, swabbing at his eyes.
"Those are the fellows that get into the pa &mdash;Oh, Lord! <em>THERE
</em>they go!"</p>

<p>Swinging out to pass us and then sweeping in upon the reverse
curve to clear the narrow arch of the culvert were too much for
the white car; and through the dust we saw it rock dangerously.
In the middle of the road, ten feet from the culvert, the old
woman struggled frantically to get her cart out of the way. The
howl of the siren frightened her perhaps, for she lost her head
and went to the wrong side. Then the shriek of the machine drowned
the human scream as the automobile struck.</p>

<p>The shock of contact was muffled. But the mass of machinery hoisted
itself in the air as if it had a life of its own and had been
stung into sudden madness. It was horrible to see, and so grotesque
that a long-forgotten memory of my boyhood leaped instantaneously
into my mind, a recollection of the evolutions performed by a
Newfoundland dog that rooted under a board walk and found a hive
of wild bees.</p>

<p>The great machine left the road for the fields on the right,
reared, fell, leaped against the stone side of the culvert, apparently
trying to climb it, stood straight on end, whirled backward in
a half-somersault, crashed over on its side, flashed with flame
and explosion, and lay hidden under a cloud of dust and smoke.</p>

<p>Ward's driver slammed down his accelerator, sent us spinning
round the curve, and the next moment, throwing on his brakes,
halted sharply at the culvert.</p>

<p>The fabric of the road was so torn and distorted one might have
thought a steam dredge had begun work there, but the fragments
of wreckage were oddly isolated and inconspicuous. The peasant's
cart, tossed into a clump of weeds, rested on its side, the spokes
of a rimless wheel slowly revolving on the hub uppermost. Some
tools were strewn in a semi-circular trail in the dust; a pair
of smashed goggles crunched beneath my foot as I sprang out of
Ward's car, and a big brass lamp had fallen in the middle of the
road, crumpled like waste paper. Beside it lay a gold rouge box.</p>

<p>The old woman had somehow saved herself&mdash;or perhaps her saint
had helped her&mdash;for she was sitting in the grass by the roadside,
wailing hysterically and quite unhurt. The body of a man lay in
a heap beneath the stone archway, and from his clothes I guessed
that he had been the driver of the white car. I say "had been"
because there were reasons for needing no second glance to comprehend
that the man was dead. Nevertheless, I knelt beside him and placed
my hand upon his breast to see if his heart still beat. Afterward
I concluded that I did this because I had seen it done upon the
stage, or had read of it in stories; and even at the time I realised
that it was a silly thing for me to be doing.</p>

<p>Ward, meanwhile, proved more practical. He was dragging a woman
out of the suffocating smoke and dust that shrouded the wreck,
and after a moment I went to help him carry her into the fresh
air, where George put his coat under her head. Her hat had been
forced forward over her face and held there by the twisting of
a system of veils she wore; and we had some difficulty in unravelling
this; but she was very much alive, as a series of muffled imprecations
testified, leading us to conclude that her sufferings were more
profoundly of rage than of pain. Finally she pushed our hands
angrily aside and completed the untanglement herself, revealing
the scratched and smeared face of Mariana, the dancer.</p>

<p>"Cornichon! Chameau! Fond du bain!" she gasped, tears of anger
starting from her eyes. She tried to rise before we could help
her, but dropped back with a scream.</p>

<p>"Oh, the pain!" she cried. "That imbecile! If he has let me break
my leg! A pretty dancer I should be! I hope he is killed."</p>

<p>One of the singularities of motoring on the main-travelled roads
near Paris is the prevalence of cars containing physicians and
surgeons. Whether it be testimony to the opportunism, to the sporting
proclivities, or to the prosperity of gentlemen of those professions,
I do not know, but it is a fact that I have never heard of an
accident (and in the season there is an accident every day) on
one of these roads when a doctor in an automobile was not almost
immediately a chance arrival, and fortunately our case offered
no exception to this rule. Another automobile had already come
up and the occupants were hastily alighting. Ward shouted to the
foremost to go for a doctor.</p>

<p>"I am a doctor," the man answered, advancing and kneeling quickly
by the dancer. "And you&mdash;you may be of help yonder."</p>

<p>We turned toward the ruined car where Ward's driver was shouting
for us.</p>

<p>"What is it?" called Ward as we ran toward him.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," he replied, "there is some one under the tonneau
here!"</p>

<p>The smoke had cleared a little, though a rivulet of burning gasoline
ran from the wreck to a pool of flame it was feeding in the road.
The front cushions and woodwork had caught fire and a couple of
labourers, panting with the run across the fields, were vainly
belabouring the flames with brushwood. From beneath the overturned
tonneau projected the lower part of a man's leg, clad in a brown
puttee and a russet shoe. Ward's driver had brought his tools;
had jacked up the car as high as possible; but was still unable
to release the imprisoned body.</p>

<p>"I have seized that foot and pulled with all my strength," he
said, "and I cannot make him move one centimetre. It is necessary
that as many people as possible lay hold of the car on the side
away from the fire and all lift together. Yes," he added, "and
very soon!"</p>

<p>Some carters had come from the road and one of them lay full
length on the ground peering beneath the wreck. "It is the head
of monsieur," explained this one; "it is the head of monsieur
which is fastened under there."</p>

<p>"Eh, but you are wiser than Clemenceau!" said the chauffeur.
"Get up, my ancient, and you there, with the brushwood, let the
fire go for a moment and help, when I say the word. And you, monsieur,"
he turned to Ward, "if you please, will you pull with me upon
the ankle here at the right moment?"</p>

<p>The carters, the labourers, the men from the other automobile,
and I laid hold of the car together.</p>

<p>"Now, then, messieurs, <em>LIFT</em>!"</p>

<p>Stifled with the gasoline smoke, we obeyed. One or two hands
were scorched and our eyes smarted blindingly, but we gave a mighty
heave, and felt the car rising.</p>

<p>"Well done!" cried the chauffeur. "Well done! But a little more!
The smallest fraction &mdash;HA! It is finished, messieurs!"</p>

<p>We staggered back, coughing and wiping our eyes. For a minute
or two I could not see at all, and was busy with a handkerchief.</p>

<p>Ward laid his hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Do you know who it is?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," I answered.</p>

<p>When I could see again, I found that I was looking almost straight
down into the upturned face of Larrabee Harman, and I cannot better
express what this man had come to be, and what the degradation
of his life had written upon him, than by saying that the dreadful
thing I looked upon now was no more horrible a sight than the
face I had seen, fresh from the valet and smiling in ugly pride
at the starers, as he passed the terrace of Larue on the day before
the Grand Prix.</p>

<p>We helped to carry him to the doctor's car, and to lift the dancer
into Ward's, and to get both of them out again at the hospital
at Versailles, where they were taken. Then, with no need to ask
each other if we should abandon our plan to breakfast in the country,
we turned toward Paris, and rolled along almost to the barriers
in silence.</p>

<p>"Did it seem to you," said George finally, "that a man so frightfully
injured could have any chance of getting well?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered. "I thought he was dying as we carried him into
the hospital."</p>

<p>"So did I. The top of his head seemed all crushed in &mdash;Whew!"
He broke off, shivering, and wiped his brow. After a pause he
added thoughtfully, "It will be a great thing for Louise."</p>

<p>Louise was the name of his second cousin, the girl who had done
battle with all her family and then run away from them to be Larrabee
Harman's wife. Remembering the stir that her application for divorce
had made, I did not understand how Harman's death could benefit
her, unless George had some reason to believe that he had made
a will in her favour. However, the remark had been made more to
himself than to me and I did not respond.</p>

<p>The morning papers flared once more with the name of Larrabee
Harman, and we read that there was "no hope of his surviving."
Ironic phrase! There was not a soul on earth that day who could
have hoped for his recovery, or who&mdash;for his sake&mdash;cared two straws
whether he lived or died. And the dancer had been right; one of
her legs was badly broken: she would never dance again.</p>

<p>Evening papers reported that Harman was "lingering." He was lingering
the next day. He was lingering the next week, and the end of a
month saw him still "lingering." Then I went down to Capri, where&mdash;for
he had been after all the merest episode to me &mdash;I was pleased
to forget all about him.</p>
