<p>"Do you want me to befriend you?" asked the renegade, bending
his head down close to the scared countenance of Maggie Brainerd,
smiling and trying to speak in so low a voice that no one else
could catch his words.</p>

<p>"Of course I do; don't you see what danger we are in? Oh, Mr.
Golcher&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't <em>Mister</em> me," he interrupted, with a reproving
grin; "call me <em>Jake</em>."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jake, have you seen anything of father?"</p>

<p>"Where would I see him?"</p>

<p>"Why, he went out with the rest to fight the Indians and Tories,
and you were with them."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I did see him," said Golcher, as though the incident
was so slight that he had forgotten it for the time: "he fought
well."</p>

<p>"Was he&mdash;was he &mdash;Oh, Jake, tell me?&mdash;was he <em>hurt</em>?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he got so much as a scratch; he was with three
or four others, and they were getting in the best kind of work;
but you know it was no use for any one; I saw that they would
be shot down where they stood, so I ran up and told your father
to follow me; you know that nobody dare touch him when <em>I</em>
took charge. I led him and his friends back toward the mountains
and stayed by them till all danger was over, and then I bade them
good-bye: if they have taken the least care and done as I told
them to do, they are a great deal safer than <em>you</em> are
at this very minute."</p>

<p>Maggie Brainerd's heart sank within her. She knew that the story
that Jake Golcher had just told her was without an iota of truth.
He had lied so clumsily that he had not deceived her at all.</p>

<p>The very question which he had asked about her parent was proof
that he had not seen him, and therefore could know nothing of
him.</p>

<p>The young lady was shocked, but she was helpless. Her duty was
to do her utmost for the safety of those who were now with her,
and she was sure that Golcher could give great help, if he chose
to do so.</p>

<p>"Jake," said she, speaking with all the earnestness of her nature,
"this is a dreadful day for Wyoming; I can hardly realize what
has taken place; I do not believe that any one on this side of
the river is safe."</p>

<p>"Of course he isn't&mdash;that is, none of the rebels is; <em>our</em>
folks are all right."</p>

<p>"Can you save us?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what's to hinder&mdash;that is, if I take the notion,
but I don't feel like doing much for that spitfire of an aunt,
that insulted me the last time that I called at your house."</p>

<p>"You musn't mind her peculiarities; she is a good woman, and
then, you know, she is my friend."</p>

<p>"Well, <em>that</em> makes a good deal of difference&mdash;that's
a fact," remarked Golcher, with such a grotesque attempt to look
arch and loving, that the watchful African, instead of firing
upon him as he had meant to do, smiled.</p>

<p>"I'm afeard he don't feel berry well; he'll feel a good deal
worse if Aunt Peggy or me gets hold of him."</p>

<p>"And then," added Golcher, glancing at Gravity, "<em>you</em>
heard the impudence of that servant."</p>

<p>"Because he is a servant you ought to excuse him; I should feel
very sorry to have him suffer harm."</p>

<p>"I don't mind taking particular care of <em>you</em> and your
little sister there, but I would prefer to leave Aunt Peggy, as
you call her, and the darkey to shift for themselves."</p>

<p>"Then I do not want you to do anything for Eva and me," said
Maggie, resolutely, feeling that she was throwing away invaluable
time by holding converse with this man; "God has been better to
us than we deserve, and we shall leave all with him."</p>

<p>She turned to move off, much to the relief of Aunt Peggy, who
had hard work to hide her impatience, when Golcher saw that he
had gone too far. Catching her arm, he said:</p>

<p>"Don't be so fast; where will you go, if you don't go with me?"</p>

<p>"Gravity is our guide."</p>

<p>"I haven't told you I wouldn't take care of you, have I?"</p>

<p>"But if you are unwilling to include <em>all</em> of us, I do
not want your friendship."</p>

<p>"Then for the sake of <em>you</em> I will save you <em>all</em>,
though nobody beside me would do so; but, Maggie, I'll expect
a little better treatment from you when I come to your house again."</p>

<p>At this point Golcher saw that the patience of the young lady
was exhausted. Her companions were ready to chide her for halting
to speak to him, though the words that passed took but a few minutes.
He reached out his hand to lay it on her arm, but she drew back.</p>

<p>"Maggie," said he, warningly; "when I came down the river bank,
I left six Seneca warriors among the trees back there; they are
tired waiting for me; their guns are loaded, and I have only to
raise my hand over my head to have 'em fire every one of 'em;
if they do it, they will all be <em>pointed this way</em>."</p>

<p>Maggie Brainerd was sure the Tory spoke the truth.</p>

<p>"You will not do that, Jake, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Not if you act right; follow me."</p>

<p>Maggie reached out her hand as an invitation for Eva to come
to her; but Aunt Peggy grasped one of the little palms in her
own, for she had overheard the invitation. When Maggie looked
around, her aunt compressed her thin lips and shook her head in
a most decided fashion.</p>

<p>"<em>No, ma'am</em>; Eva stays here: if you want to go off with
that scamp you can do so, but the rest of us <em>don't</em>."</p>

<p>"But, aunt, what shall we do? There's no escape for us unless
we put ourselves in his care; Jake has promised to see that no
harm befalls us from the Indians."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" exclaimed the aunt, with a shudder of disgust: "I'd rather
trust myself with the worst Indians that are now in the valley
than with <em>him</em>."</p>

<p>"Them's my sentiments," broke in Gravity; "we don't want to fool
away any more time with <em>him</em>."</p>

<p>"Then you'll take the consequences," said the Tory, trembling
with anger. "I offered to protect you and you refused to have
me; I'll still take care of Maggie and Eva, but as for you others,
you shall see&mdash;"</p>
