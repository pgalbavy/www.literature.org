<p>Vacation, in spite of increased leisure, may bring inconvenience
to people in Ramsey's strange but not uncommon condition. At home
his constant air was that of a badgered captive plaintively silent
under injustice; and he found it difficult to reply calmly when
asked where he was going&mdash;an inquiry addressed to him, he asserted,
every time he touched his cap, even to hang it up!</p>

<p>The amount of evening walking he did must also have been a trial
to his nerves, on account of fatigue, though the ground covered
was not vast. Milla's mother and father were friendly people but
saw no reason to "move out of house and home," as Mr. Rust said,
when Milla had "callers"; and on account of the intimate plan
of their small dwelling a visitor's only alternative to spending
the evening with Mr. and Mrs. Rust as well as with Milla, was
to invite her to "go out walking."</p>

<p>Evening after evening they walked and walked and walked, usually
in company&mdash;at perhaps the distance of half a block&mdash;with Albert
Paxton and Sadie Clews, though Ramsey now and then felt disgraced
by having fallen into this class; for sometimes it was apparent
that Albert casually had his arm about Sadie's waist. This allured
Ramsey somewhat, but terrified him more. He didn't know how such
matters were managed.</p>

<p>Usually the quartet had no destination; they just went "out walking" 
until ten o'clock, when both girls had to be home&mdash;and the boys
did, too, but never admitted it. On Friday evenings there was
a "public open-air concert" by a brass band in a small park, and
the four were always there. A political speechmaker occupied the
bandstand one night, and they stood for an hour in the midst of
the crowd, listening vaguely.</p>

<p>The orator saddled his politics upon patriotism. "Do you intend
to let this glorious country go to wrack and ruin, oh, my good
friends," he demanded, "or do you intend to save her? Look forth
upon this country of ours, I bid you, oh, my countrymen, and tell
me what you see. You see a fair domain of forest, mountain, plain,
and fertile valleys, sweeping from ocean to ocean. Look from the
sturdy rocks of old New England, pledged to posterity by the stern
religious hardihood of the Pilgrim Fathers, across the corn-bearing
midland country, that land of milk and honey, won for us by the
pluck and endurance of the indomitable pioneers, to where in sunshine
roll the smiling Sierras of golden California, given to our heritage
by the unconquerable energy of those brave men and women who braved
the tomahawk on the Great Plains, the tempest, of Cape Horn, and
the fevers of Panama, to make American soil of El Dorado! America!
Oh, my America, how glorious you stand! Country of Washington
and Valley Forge, out of what martyrdoms hast thou arisen! Country
of Lincoln in his box at Ford's theatre, his lifeblood staining
to a brighter, holier red the red, white, and blue of the Old
Flag! Always and always I see the Old Flag fluttering the more
sacredly encrimsoned in the breeze for the martyrs who have upheld
it! Always I see that Old Flag&mdash;"</p>

<p>Milla gave Ramsey's arm, within her own, a little tug. "Come
on," she said. "Sade says she don't want to hang around here any
longer. It's awful tiresome. Let's go."</p>

<p>He consented, placidly. The oration meant nothing to him and
stirred no one in the audience. The orator was impassioned; he
shouted himself into coughing fits, gesticulated, grew purple;
he was so hot that his collar caved in and finally swooned upon
his neck in soggy exhaustion, prostrate round his thunderings.
Meanwhile, the people listened with an air of patience, yawning
here and there, and gradually growing fewer. It was the old, old
usual thing, made up of phrases that Ramsey had heard dinning
away on a thousand such occasions, and other kinds of occasions,
until they meant to him no more than so much sound. He was bored,
and glad to leave.</p>

<p>"Kind o' funny," he said, as they sagged along the street at
their usual tortoise gait.</p>

<p>"What is it, Ramsey?"</p>

<p>"Seems kind o' funny they never have anything to say any one
can take any interest in. Always the same ole whoopety-whoop about
George Washington and Pilgrim Fathers and so on. I bet five dollars
before long we'd of heard him goin' on about our martyred Presidents,
William McKinley and James A. Garfield and Benjamin Harrison and
all so on, and then some more about the ole Red, White, and Blue.
Don't you wish they'd <em>quit</em>, sometimes, about the 'Ole
Flag'?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," said Milla. "I wasn't listening any at all. I hate
speeches."</p>

<p>"Well, I could <em>stand</em> 'em," Ramsey said, more generously,
"if they'd ever give anybody a little to think about. What's the
use always draggin' in George Warshington and the Ole Flag? And
who wants to hear any more ole truck about 'from ole rocky New
England to golden California,' and how big and fine the United
States is and how it's the land of the Free and all that? Why
don't they ever say anything new? That's what I'd like to know."</p>

<p>Milla laughed, and when he asked why, she told him she'd never
heard him talk so much "at one stretch." "I guess that speech
got you kind of wound up," she said. "Let's talk about something
different."</p>

<p>"I just soon," he agreed. And so they walked on in silence, which
seemed to suit Milla. She hung weightily upon his arm, and they
dawdled, drifting from one side of the pavement to the other as
they slowly advanced. Albert and Sadie, ahead of them, called
"good-night" from a corner, before turning down the side street
where Sadie lived; and then, presently, Ramsey and Milla were
at the latter's gate. He went in with her, halting at the front
steps.</p>

<p>"Well, g'night, Milla," he said. "Want to go out walking to-morrow
night? Albert and Sadie are."</p>

<p>"I can't to-morrow night," she told him with obvious regret.
"Isn't it the worst luck! I got an aunt comin' to visit from Chicago,
and she's crazy about playing 'Five Hundred,' and Mama and Papa
said I haf to stay in to make four to play it. She's liable to
be here three or four days, and I guess I got to be around home
pretty much all the time she's here. It's the worst luck!"</p>

<p>He was doleful, but ventured to be literary. "Well, what can't
be helped must be endured. I'll come around when she's gone."</p>

<p>He moved as if to depart, but she still retained his arm and
did not prepare to relinquish it.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" he said.</p>

<p>"Well what, Ramsey?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;g'night."</p>

<p>She glanced up at the dark front of the house. "I guess the family's
gone to bed," she said, absently.</p>

<p>"I s'pose so."</p>

<p>"Well, good-night, Ramsey." She said this but still did not release
his arm, and suddenly, in a fluster, he felt that the time he
dreaded had come. Somehow, without knowing where, except that
it was somewhere upon what seemed to be a blurred face too full
of obstructing features, he kissed her.</p>

<p>She turned instantly away in the darkness, her hands over her
cheeks; and in a panic Ramsey wondered if he hadn't made a dreadful
mistake.</p>

<p>"S'cuse me!" he said, stumbling toward the gate. "Well, I guess
I got to be gettin' along back home."</p>
