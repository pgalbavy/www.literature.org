<p>"I wonder how far off the lick is," said George, looking along
the path, which the eye could trace for several rods.</p>

<p>"There is but one way of finding out," replied his brother; "and
that is to follow the trail to the lick."</p>

<p>Jack gazed in the other direction, where the trail could be seen
for a greater distance before it wound out of sight.</p>

<p>"The path is so plain," he said, "that I don’t believe the lick
can be far off."</p>

<p>"If we should come here early in the morning we should be likely
to find more of them."</p>

<p>"I don’t think we shall have much trouble in finding enough to
keep us busy, and to give you another trial with that fine gun
of yours."</p>

<p>Since there was reason for believing they would soon meet some
of the animals of which they were talking, the boys were wise
enough to act like the young hunters they claimed to be.</p>

<p>Will took the lead, Jack coming next, with George in the rear,
all walking close together.  Of course the gun of each was loaded,
and, though carried over the shoulder, was ready for instant service.</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes open," was the unnecessary advice of Jack to
their leader, "for we don’t want you to fall over some beast before
we see him."</p>

<p>"You needn’t fear for me," was the confident reply of Will; "and
don’t you forget that some of them may be coming from the other
way."</p>

<p>"George must attend to <em>them</em>," said Jack, glancing over
his shoulder at the youngest member of the party, who also looked
behind him on hearing the remark.</p>

<p>"This blanket, strapped like a knapsack behind my shoulders,
is handy," remarked George, with a laugh.  "If a painter would
only use his paws on it he wouldn’t hurt <em>me</em> much."</p>

<p>"A painter ain’t so foolish as that," said Jack. "He knows too
well how to get at a fellow of your size to waste any time in
tearing up blankets."</p>

<p>"’Sh! here comes something!" exclaimed Will, in a hushed voice,
stopping short, and motioning to the others to do the same.</p>

<p>A second later the leader stepped quickly from the path, and
ran a few paces to a large tree, behind which he screened himself. 
The others quickly did the same, for, as you may well know, the
large trunks were so handy that it was an easy thing to do.</p>

<p>Brief as was the time taken, it was enough to bring into sight
the animal whose approach Will had learned by the sound of his
feet upon the solid ground.</p>

<p>The huge bushy head of a bull bison loomed into sight, as he
ambled along the trail at a leisurely gait, on his return from
his dessert of salt.  He looked frightful enough when viewed from
the front, and it is probable that he would have charged upon
the whole party of boys had they tried to stop him; but he is
an animal little feared by the hunter, and not one of the three
boys felt the least misgiving on the approach of the big beast.</p>

<p>His action showed that he had not observed the young hunters
as they dodged from his path, and therefore they were the bolder
in peeping from behind their shelter.</p>

<p>A moment after the bull came in sight, another was seen to be
walking a short distance behind him. Then another and another
appeared, until seven were counted, walking along the trail in
their lazy fashion.</p>

<p>Nothing would have been easier for the boys than to have dropped
three of the animals in their tracks. As each one reached his
fore leg forward he exposed a portion of his body through which
a bullet could have been sent directly into his heart.</p>

<p>Not a shot, however, was fired.  There was not enough danger
in bringing down this kind of game to suit the boys, who wanted
something of a more exciting nature.  They therefore allowed the
beasts to pass by unharmed, though Jack resolved to give them
a scare.</p>

<p>In darting among the trees to find a hiding-place, George ran
in front of Jack, so that the latter was thrown a few paces to
the rear of the brothers.  Just as the fine-looking bull came
opposite, Jack, leaving his gun leaning against the tree, dashed
out, threw up both hands, and shouted.</p>

<p>He expected that the startled animal would plunge away at the
top of his speed, but he did not.</p>

<p>Those who were following the leader flung up their heads each
with a snort, and ran off among the trees; but the leader, stopping
short, looked inquiringly at the youngster, as though trying to
learn his species. Then he, too, uttered a snort, and dropping
his big head, charged straight at the boy.</p>

<p>It would be putting it very mildly to say that Jack was surprised. 
When he saw his danger he was less than a dozen paces from the
beast, which crashed like a steam-engine through the bushes, undergrowth,
and among the trees.</p>

<p>"My gracious!" gasped the lad, wheeling about like a flash, and
breaking for shelter; "shoot him, boys, or it’s all up with me!"</p>

<p>Jack, however, proved his readiness of resource by making a running
leap at a large limb, a short distance away.  Seizing it with
both hands, he pulled himself out of reach, just as the bull thundered
past beneath him.</p>

<p>The brute was trammelled in his movements by the trees, else
he would have been likely to overtake the boy before he could
secure the refuge.</p>

<p>Seeing that his victim had escaped, the bison looked up at him
with an angry snuff, then turned slowly about and made his way
back to the path, leaving his companions to do as they chose.</p>

<p>Jack wondered why, brief though the incident was, his friends
had not fired at the bull, who charged him with such fury; but
when from his perch he looked around for them, he understood very
well why they held their peace.</p>

<p>Seeing the beast depart, the brothers stepped from behind the
respective trees that had sheltered them. Both were still shaking
with laughter to such an extent that they could hardly stand,
and they could not have aimed a gun at the bison had he been within
a rod of them.</p>

<p>Jack was inclined to lose his temper when, after scowling at
them for a full minute, he saw no signs of a decrease in their
mirth.  But by-and-by he began to see the ludicrous side of the
picture, and he too broke into laughter.  Dropping lightly to
the ground, he caught up his rifle, and joining his friends, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I started out to scare that old bull, but it looks as though
he scared me."</p>

<p>"I should say he did, and&#11834;"</p>

<p>But Will dropped back against the tree, his brother doing the
same, and both unable to speak another word.</p>

<p>Jack coolly sat down on the ground, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"When you have finished we’ll go on."</p>

<p>There is nothing which does a person more good than a hearty
fit of laughter.  That being so, it is safe to say that the Burton
brothers never before had so much good done them.</p>

<p>The end, however, soon came, and shaking themselves together,
as may be said, the three came back to the trail, along which
they continued their way towards the lick.</p>

<p>They took the same order as before, and all were on the alert. 
Now and then Jack noticed the shoulders of their leader shaking
in a way that told him he was laughing again over the figure cut
by Jack when he set out to scare the bull.  After a time this
ceased altogether.</p>

<p>It was yet quite early in the day, and the boys expected when
night came to be a long way from their friends.  They would have
felt themselves poor hunters if they did not spend a night in
the woods, even though within easy reach of home; and since Mr.
Burton had given his boys permission to stay a couple of nights
in camp, it could be set down as a certainty that they would do
so.</p>

<p>The experience of the young hunters on their jaunt through the
Kentucky woods proved not only of the most stirring kind, but
it was marked by a number of adventures the like of which they
had never known or heard of before.  Indeed, it may be said that
this feature began with Jack’s fight with the panthers the night
before, when, instead of meeting only one, he ran against two. 
Of itself this was not so remarkable, but it was the first instance
known to him.</p>

<p>The boys naturally felt confidence in themselves, for they were
three in number, and each had a good gun.  Surely they ought to
be more than enough for anything in the nature of a wild animal;
and yet, when they least expected it, they ran into a peril of
which none of them dreamed.</p>

<p>"My gracious!" suddenly exclaimed Will, turning short around;
"here comes a hundred bears!"</p>

<p>Now it is not to be supposed that there was anything like the
number which the lad in his excitement declared, but what he did
see was enough to terrify any one.</p>

<p>Lumbering along the trail, directly towards them, was a black
bear of large size, and there were two at least behind him.  These
three were discovered at the same moment, and the unusual sight
led Will to believe that it was only the head of a procession
coming from the salt lick a long distance away.</p>

<p>"Let’s take to the trees," said Will, leading the way into the
wood. "It won’t do to fight all them."</p>

<p>"Hold on," replied Jack, standing his ground.  "I didn’t come
out to hunt game, and then run away from it when found."</p>

<p>"You were the first one to do it, though," retorted Will.  "You
can stay if you want to, but I don’t."</p>

<p>George followed his brother, but Jack, true to his word, stood
his ground, ready to meet the bear. </p>
