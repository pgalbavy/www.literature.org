<p>On the morning after Commemoration, Oxford was in a bustle of
departure. The play had been played, the long vacation had begun,
and visitors and members seemed equally anxious to be off. At
the gates of the colleges, groups of men in travelling-dresses
waited for the coaches, omnibuses, dog-carts and all manner of
vehicles, which were to carry them to the Great Western railway
station at Steventon, or elsewhere, to all points of the compass.
Porters passed in and out with portmanteaus, gun-cases, and baggage
of all kinds, which they piled outside the gates, or carried off
to "The Mitre" or "The Angel," under the vigorous and not too
courteous orders of the owners. College servants flitted round
the groups to take instructions, and, it so might be, to extract
the balances of extortionate bills out of their departing masters.
Dog-fanciers were there also, holding terriers; and scouts from
the cricketing grounds, with bats and pads under their arms; and
hostlers, and men from the boats, all on the same errand of getting
the last shilling out of their patrons&mdash;a fawning, obsequious
crowd for the most part, with here and there a sturdy Briton who
felt that he was only there for his due.</p>

<p>Through such a group, at the gate of St. Ambrose, Tom and Hardy
passed soon after breakfast time, in cap and gown, which costume
excited no small astonishment.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Brown, old fellow! ain't you off this morning?"</p>

<p>"No, I shall be up for a day or two yet."</p>

<p>"Wish you joy. I wouldn't be staying up over to-day for something."</p>

<p>"But you'll be at Henley to-morrow?" said Diogenes, confidently,
who stood at the gate in boating coat and flannels, a big stick
and knapsack, waiting for a companion, with whom he was going
to walk to Henley.</p>

<p>"And at Lord's on Friday," said another. "It will be a famous
match. Come and dine somewhere afterwards, and go to the Haymarket
with us."</p>

<p>"You know the Leander are to be at Henley," put in Diogenes;
"and Cambridge is very strong. There will be a splendid race for
the cup, but Jervis thinks we are all right."</p>

<p>"Bother your eternal races! Haven't we had enough of them already?"
said the Londoner. "You had much better come up to the little
village at once, Brown, and stay there while the coin lasts."</p>

<p>"If I get away at all, it will be to Henley," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Of course, I knew that," said Diogenes, triumphantly, "our boat
ought to be on for the ladies' plate. If only Jervis were not
in the University crew! I thought you were to pull at Henley,
Hardy?"</p>

<p>"I was asked to pull, but I couldn't manage the time with the
schools coming on, and when the examinations were over it was
too late. The crew were picked and half trained, and none of them
have broken down."</p>

<p>"What! Every one of them stood putting through the sieve? They
must be a rare crew, then," said another.</p>

<p>"You're right," said Diogenes. "Oh, here you are at last," he
added, as another man in flannels and knapsack came out of college.
"Well, good-bye all, and a pleasant vacation; we must be off,
if we are to be in time to see our crew pull over the course to-night;"
and the two marched off towards Magdalen Bridge.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" remarked a fast youth, in most elaborate toilette,
looking after them, "fancy two fellows grinding off to Henley,
five miles an hour, in this sun, when they might drop up to the
metropolis by train in half the time? Isn't it marvellous?"</p>

<p>"I should like to be going with them," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no accounting for tastes. Here's our coach."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, then;" and Tom shook hands, and, leaving the coach
to get packed with portmanteaus, terriers, and undergraduates,
he and Hardy walked off towards the High-street.</p>

<p>"So you're not going to-day?" Hardy said.</p>

<p>"No; two or three of my old schoolfellows are coming up to stand
for scholarships, and I must be here to receive them. But it's
very unlucky; I should have liked so to have been at Henley."</p>

<p>"Look, their carriage is already at the door," said Hardy, pointing
up High-street, into which they now turned. There were a dozen
postchaises and carriages loading in front of different houses
in the street, and amongst them Mr. Winter's old-fashioned travelling
barouche.</p>

<p>"So it is," said Tom; "that's some of uncle's fidgetiness; but
he will be sure to dawdle at the last. Come along in."</p>

<p>"Don't you think I had better stay downstairs? It may seem intrusive."</p>

<p>"No, come along. Why, they asked you to come and see the last
of them last night, didn't they?"</p>

<p>Hardy did not require any further urging to induce him to follow
his inclination; so the two went up together. The breakfast things
were still on the table, at which sat Miss Winter, in her bonnet,
employed in examining the bill, with the assistance of Mary, who
leant over her shoulder. She looked up as they entered.</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm so glad you are come. Poor Katie is so bothered, and
I can't help her. Do look at the bill; is it all right?"</p>

<p>"Shall I, Katie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, please do. I don't see anything to object to, except, perhaps,
the things I have marked. Do you think we ought to be charged
half a crown a day for the kitchen fire?"</p>

<p>"Fire in June! and you have never dined at home once?"</p>

<p>"No, but we have had tea several times."</p>

<p>"It is a regular swindle," said Tom, taking the bill and glancing
at it. "Here, Hardy, come and help me cut down this precious total."</p>

<p>They sat down to the bill, the ladies willingly giving place.
Mary tripped off to the glass to tie her bonnet.</p>

<p>"Now that is all right!" she said merrily; "why can't one go
on without bills or horrid money?"</p>

<p>"Ah! why can't one?" said Tom, "that would suit most of our complaints.
But where's uncle; has he seen the bill?"</p>

<p>"No; Papa is in his room; he must not be worried, or the journey
will be too much for him."</p>

<p>Here the ladies'-maid arrived, with a message that her father
wished to see Miss Winter.</p>

<p>"Leave your money, Katie," said her cousin, "this is gentlemen's
business, and Tom and Mr. Hardy will settle it all for us, I am
sure."</p>

<p>Tom professed his entire willingness to accept the charge, delighted
at finding himself reinstated in his office of protector at Mary's
suggestion. Had the landlord been one or his own tradesmen, or
the bill his own bill, he might not have been so well pleased,
but, as neither of these was the case, and he had Hardy to back
him, he went into the matter with much vigor and discretion, and
had the landlord up, made the proper deductions, and got the bill
settled and receipted in a few minutes. Then he and Hardy addressed
themselves to getting the carriage comfortably packed, and vied
with one another in settling and stowing away in the most convenient
places, the many little odds and ends which naturally accompany
young ladies and invalids on their travels; in the course of which
employment he managed to snatch a few words here and there with
Mary and satisfied himself that she bore him no ill-will for the
events of the previous day.</p>

<p>At last all was ready for the start, and Tom reported the fact
in the sitting-room. "Then I will go and fetch papa," said Miss
Winter.</p>

<p>Tom's eyes met Mary's at the moment. He gave a slight shrug with
his shoulders, and said, as the door closed after his cousin,
"Really I have no patience with Uncle Robert, he leaves poor Katie
to do everything."</p>

<p>"Yes; and how beautifully she does it all, without a word or,
I believe, a thought of complaint! I could never be so patient."</p>

<p>"I think it is a pity. If Uncle Robert were obliged to exert
himself, it would be much better for him. Katie is only spoiling
him and wearing herself out."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is very easy for you and me to think and say so. But
he is her father, and then he is really an invalid. So she goes
on devoting herself to him more and more, and feels she can never
do too much for him."</p>

<p>"But if she believed it would be better for him to exert himself?
I'm sure it is the truth. Couldn't you try to persuade her?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed; it would only worry her, and be so cruel. But then
I am not used to give advice," she added, after a moment's pause,
looking demurely at her gloves; "It might do good, perhaps, now,
if you were to speak to her."</p>

<p>"You think me so well qualified, I suppose, after the specimen
you had yesterday? Thank you; I have had enough of lecturing for
the present."</p>

<p>"I am very much obliged to you, really, for what you said to
me," said Mary, still looking at her gloves.</p>

<p>The subject was a very distasteful one to Tom. He looked at her
for a moment to see whether she was laughing at him, and then
broke it off abruptly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope you have enjoyed your visit?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, so very much. I shall think of it all the summer."</p>

<p>"Where shall you be all the summer?" asked Tom. "Not so very
far from you. Papa has taken a house only eight miles from Englebourn,
and Katie says you live within a day's drive of them."</p>

<p>"And shall you be there all the vacation?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and we hope to get Katie over often. Could not you come
and meet her? it would be so pleasant."</p>

<p>"But do you think I might? I don't know your father or mother."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; papa and mamma are very kind, and will ask anybody
I like. Besides, you are a cousin, you know."</p>

<p>"Only up at Oxford, I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Well now, you will see. We are going to have a great archery
party next month, and you shall have an invitation."</p>

<p>"Will you write it for me yourself?"</p>

<p>"Very likely; but why?"</p>

<p>"Don't you think I shall value a note in your hand more than&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense; now, remember your lecture. Oh here are Uncle Robert
and Katie."</p>

<p>Mr. Winter was very gracious, and thanked Tom for all his attentions.
He had been very pleased, he said, to make his nephew's acquaintance
again so pleasantly, and hoped he would come and pass a day or
two at Englebourn in the vacation. In his sad state of health
he could not do much to entertain a young man, but he could procure
him some good fishing and shooting in the neighborhood. Tom assured
his uncle that nothing would please him so much as a visit to
Englebourn. Perhaps the remembrance of the distance between that
parish and the place where Mary was to spend the summer may have
added a little to his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"I should have liked also to have thanked your friend for his
hospitality," Mr. Winter went on. "I understood my daughter to
say he was here."</p>

<p>"Yes, he was here just now," said Tom; "he must be below, I think."</p>

<p>"What, that good Mr. Hardy?" said Mary, who was looking out of
the window; "there he is in the street. He has just helped Hopkins
into the rumble, and handed her things to her just as if she were
a duchess. She has been so cross all the morning, and now she
looks quite gracious."</p>

<p>"Then I think, papa, we had better start."</p>

<p>"Let me give you an arm down stairs, uncle," said Tom; and so
he helped his uncle down to the carriage, the two young ladies
following behind, and the landlord standing with obsequious bows
at his shop door, and looking as if he had never made an overcharge
in his life.</p>

<p>While Mr. Winter was making his acknowledgments to Hardy, and
being helped by him into the most comfortable seat in the carriage,
Tom was making tender adieus to the two young ladies behind, and
even succeeded in keeping a rose-bud which Mary was carrying,
when they took their seats. She parted from it half-laughingly,
and the post-boy cracked his whip and the barouche went lumbering
along High-street. Hardy and Tom watched it until it turned down
St. Aldate's towards Folly Bridge, the latter waving his hand
as it disappeared, and then they turned and strolled slowly away
side by side in silence. The sight of all the other departures
increased the uncomfortable, unsatisfied feeling which that of
his own relatives had already produced in Tom's mind.</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't lively stopping up here when everybody is going,
is it? What is one to do?"</p>

<p>"Oughtn't you to be looking after your friends who are coming
up to try for the scholarships?"</p>

<p>"No, they won't be up till afternoon, by coach."</p>

<p>"Shall we go down to the river, then?"</p>

<p>"No, it would be miserable. Hullo, look here, what's up?"</p>

<p>The cause of Tom's astonishment was the appearance of the usual
procession of university beadles carrying silver-headed maces,
and escorting the Vice-Chancellor towards St. Mary's.</p>

<p>"Why, the bells are going for service; there must be a university
sermon. Is it a saint's day?"</p>

<p>"Where's the congregation to come from? Why, half Oxford is off
by this time, and those that are left won't want to be hearing
sermons."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know. A good many seem to be going. I wonder who
is to preach?"</p>

<p>"I vote we go. It will help to pass the time."</p>

<p>Hardy agreed, and they followed the procession and went up into
the gallery of St. Mary's. There was a very fair congregation
in the body of the church, and the staffs of the colleges had
not yet broken up, and even in the gallery the undergraduates
mustered in some force. The restless feeling which had brought
our hero there seemed to have had a like effect on most of the
men who were for one reason or another unable to start on that
day.</p>

<p>Tom looked steadily into his cap during the bidding prayer, and
sat down composedly afterwards, expecting not to be much interested
or benefitted, but comforted with the assurance that at any rate
it would be almost luncheon time before he would be again thrown
on his own resources. But he was mistaken in his expectations,
and before the preacher had been speaking for three minutes, was
all attention. The sermon was upon the freedom of the Gospel,
the power by which it bursts all bonds and lets the oppressed
go free. Its burthen was, "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth
shall make you free." The preacher dwelt on many sides of these
words; the freedom of nations, of societies, of universities,
of the conscience of each individual man, were each glanced at
in turn; and then, reminding his hearers of the end of the academical
year, he went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have heard it said in the troubles and toils and temptations
of the world,* 'Oh that I could begin life over again! oh that
I could fall asleep, and wake up twelve, six, three mouths hence,
and find my difficulties solved!' That which we may vainly wish
elsewhere, by a happy Providence is furnished to us by the natural
divisions of meeting and parting in this place. To everyone of
us, old and young, the long vacation on which we are now entering
gives us a breathing space, and time to break the bonds which
place and circumstance have woven round us during the year that
is past. From all our petty cares, and confusions, and intrigues;
from the dust and clatter of this huge machinery amidst which
we labor and toil; from whatever cynical contempt of what is generous
and devout; from whatever fanciful disregard of what is just and
wise; from whatever gall of bitterness is secreted in our best
motives; from whatever bonds of unequal dealings in which we may
have entangled ourselves or others, we are now for a time set
free. We stand on the edge of a river which shall for a time at
least sweep them away&mdash;that ancient river, the Kishon, the river
of fresh thoughts, and fresh scenes, and fresh feelings, and fresh
hopes&mdash;one surely amongst the blessed means whereby God's free
and loving grace works out our deliverance, our redemption from
evil, and renews the strength of each succeeding year, so that
we may 'mount up again as eagles, may run and not be weary, may
walk and not faint.'"</p>

<p>"And if, turning to the younger part of my hearers, I may still
more directly apply this general lesson to them. Is there no one
who, in some shape or other, does not feel the bondage of which
I have been speaking? He has something on his conscience; he has
something on his mind; extravagance, sin, debt, falsehood. Every
morning in the first few minutes after waking, it is the first
thought that occurs to him. He drives it away in the day; he drives
it off by recklessness, which only binds it more and more closely
round him. Is there any one who has ever felt, who is at this
moment feeling this grievous burden. What is the deliverance?
How shall he set himself free? In what special way does the redemption
of Christ, the free grace of God, present itself to him? There
is at least one way clear and simple. He knows it better than
anyone can tell him. It is those same words which I used with
another purpose. 'The truth shall make him free.' It is to tell
the truth to his friend, to his parent, to any one, whosoever
it be, from whom he is concealing that which he ought to make
known. One word of open, frank disclosure&mdash;one resolution to act
sincerely and honestly by himself and others, one ray of truth
let into that dark corner will indeed set the whole man free."</p>

<p>"<em>Liberavi animam meam</em>. 'I have delivered my soul.' What
a faithful expression is this of the relief, the deliverance effected
by one strong effort of will in one moment of time. 'I will arise
and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father I have sinned
against Heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called
thy son. So we heard the prodigal's confession this morning. So
may the thought well spring up in the minds of any who in the
course of this last year have wandered into sin, have found themselves
beset with evil habits of wicked idleness, of wretched self-indulgence.
Now that you are indeed in the literal sense of the word about
to rise and go to your father, now that you will be able to shake
off the bondage of bad companionship, now that the whole length
of this long absence will roll between you and the past, take
a long breath; break off the yoke of your sin, of your fault,
of your wrong doing, of your folly, of your perverseness, of your
pride, of your vanity, of your weakness; break it off by truth;
break it off by one stout effort, in one steadfast prayer; break
it off by innocent and free enjoyment; break it off by honest
work. Put your 'hand to the nail and your right hand to the workman's
hammer;' strike through the enemy which has ensnared you, pierce
and strike him through and through. However powerful he seems,
at your feet he will bow, he will fall, he will lie down; at your
feet he will bow and fall, and where he bows, there will he rise
up no more. So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord; but let them
that love Thee be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.'"</p>

<p>* This quotation is from the sermon preached by Dr. Stanley before
the University, on Act Sunday, 1859 (published by J. H. Parker,
of Oxford). I hope the distinguished professor whose words they
are will pardon the liberty I have taken in quoting them. No words
of my own could have given so vividly what I wanted to say.</p>

<p>The two friends separated themselves from the crowd in the porch
and walked away, side by side, towards their college.</p>

<p>"Well, that wasn't a bad move of ours. It is worth something
to hear a man preach that sort of doctrine," said Hardy.</p>

<p>"How does he get to know it all?" said Tom, meditatively.</p>

<p>"All what? I don't see your puzzle."</p>

<p>"Why, all sorts of things that are in a fellow's mind&mdash;what he
thinks about the first thing in the morning, for instance."</p>

<p>"Pretty much like the rest of us, I take it; by looking at home.
You don't suppose university preachers are unlike you and me."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know. Now do you think he ever had anything on
his mind that was always coming up and plaguing him, and which
he never told to anybody?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I should think so; most of us must have had."</p>

<p>"Have you?"</p>

<p>"Ay, often and often."</p>

<p>"And you think his remedy the right one?"</p>

<p>"The only one. Make a clean breast of it and the sting is gone.
There's a great deal to be done afterwards, of course; but there
can be no question about step No. 1."</p>

<p>"Did you ever owe a hundred pounds that you couldn't pay?" said
Tom, with a sudden effort; and his secret had hardly passed his
lips before he felt a relief which surprised himself.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said Hardy, stopping in the street "you don't
mean to say you are speaking of yourself?"</p>

<p>"I do, though," said Tom, "and it has been on my mind ever since
Easter term, and has spoilt my temper and everything&mdash;that and
something else that you know of. You must have seen me getting
more and more ill-tempered, I'm sure; and I have thought of it
the first thing in the morning  and the last thing at night; and
tried to drive the thought away just as he said one did in his
sermon. By Jove, I thought he knew all about it, for he looked
right at me, just when he came to that place."</p>

<p>"But, Brown, how do you mean you owe a hundred pounds? You haven't
read much certainly; but you haven't hunted, or gambled, or tailored
much, or gone into any other extravagant folly. You must be dreaming."</p>

<p>"Am I though? Come up to my rooms and I'll tell you all about
it; I feel better already now I've let it out. I'll send over
for your commons, and we'll have some lunch."</p>

<p>Hardy followed his friend in much trouble of mind, considering
in himself whether with the remainder of his savings he could
not make up the sum which Tom had named. Fortunately for both
of them a short calculation showed him that he could not, and
he gave up the idea of delivering his friend in this summary manner
with a sigh. He remained closeted with Tom for an hour, and then
came out, looking serious still, but not uncomfortable, and went
down to the river. He sculled down to Sandford, bathed in the
lasher, and returned in time for chapel. He stayed outside afterwards,
and Tom came up to him and seized his arm.</p>

<p>"I've done it, old fellow," he said; "look here;" and produced
a letter. Hardy glanced at the direction, and saw that it was
to his father.</p>

<p>"Come along and post it," said Tom, "and then I shall feel all
right."</p>

<p>They walked off quickly to the post-office and dropped the letter
into the box.</p>

<p>"There," he said, as it disappeared, "<em>liberavi animam meam</em>.
I owe the preacher a good turn for that; I've a good mind to write
and thank him. Fancy the poor old governor's face to-morrow at
breakfast!"</p>

<p>"Well, you seem to take it easy enough now," said Hardy.</p>

<p>"I can't help it. I tell you I haven't felt so jolly this two
months. What a fool I was not to have done it before. After all
now I come to think of it, I can pay it myself, at least as soon
as I am of age, for I know I've some money&mdash;a legacy or something&mdash;coming
to me then. But that isn't what I care about now."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad, though, that you have the money of your own."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the having told it is all the comfort. Come along,
and let's see whether these boys are come. The old Pig ought to
be in by this time, and I want them to dine in hall. It's only
ten months since I came up on it to matriculate, and it seems
twenty years. But I'm going to be a boy again for to-night; you'll
see if I'm not."</p>
