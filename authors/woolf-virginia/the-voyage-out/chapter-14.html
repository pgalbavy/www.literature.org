<p>The sun of that same day going down, dusk was saluted as usual
at the hotel by an instantaneous sparkle of electric lights. The
hours between dinner and bedtime were always difficult enough
to kill, and the night after the dance they were further tarnished
by the peevishness of dissipation. Certainly, in the opinion of
Hirst and Hewet, who lay back in long arm-chairs in the middle
of the hall, with their coffee-cups beside them, and their cigarettes
in their hands, the evening was unusually dull, the women unusually
badly dressed, the men unusually fatuous. Moreover, when the mail
had been distributed half an hour ago there were no letters for
either of the two young men. As every other person, practically,
had received two or three plump letters from England, which they
were now engaged in reading, this seemed hard, and prompted Hirst
to make the caustic remark that the animals had been fed. Their
silence, he said, reminded him of the silence in the lion-house
when each beast holds a lump of raw meat in its paws. He went
on, stimulated by this comparison, to liken some to hippopotamuses,
some to canary birds, some to swine, some to parrots, and some
to loathsome reptiles curled round the half-decayed bodies of
sheep. The intermittent sounds&mdash;now a cough, now a horrible wheezing
or throat-clearing, now a little patter of conversation&mdash;were
just, he declared, what you hear if you stand in the lion-house
when the bones are being mauled. But these comparisons did not
rouse Hewet, who, after a careless glance round the room, fixed
his eyes upon a thicket of native spears which were so ingeniously
arranged as to run their points at you whichever way you approached
them. He was clearly oblivious of his surroundings; whereupon
Hirst, perceiving that Hewet's mind was a complete blank, fixed
his attention more closely upon his fellow-creatures. He was too
far from them, however, to hear what they were saying, but it
pleased him to construct little theories about them from their
gestures and appearance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornbury had received a great many letters. She was completely
engrossed in them. When she had finished a page she handed it
to her husband, or gave him the sense of what she was reading
in a series of short quotations linked together by a sound at
the back of her throat. "Evie writes that George has gone to Glasgow.
'He finds Mr. Chadbourne so nice to work with, and we hope to
spend Christmas together, but I should not like to move Betty
and Alfred any great distance (no, quite right), though it is
difficult to imagine cold weather in this heat. . . . Eleanor
and Roger drove over in the new trap. . . . Eleanor certainly
looked more like herself than I've seen her since the winter.
She has put Baby on three bottles now, which I'm sure is wise
(I'm sure it is too), and so gets better nights. . . . My hair
still falls out. I find it on the pillow! But I am cheered by
hearing from Tottie Hall Green. . . . Muriel is in Torquay enjoying
herself greatly at dances. She <em>is</em> going to show her black
put after all.' . . . A line from Herbert&mdash;so busy, poor fellow!
Ah! Margaret says, 'Poor old Mrs. Fairbank died on the eighth,
quite suddenly in the conservatory, only a maid in the house,
who hadn't the presence of mind to lift her up, which they think
might have saved her, but the doctor says it might have come at
any moment, and one can only feel thankful that it was in the
house and not in the street (I should think so!). The pigeons
have increased terribly, just as the rabbits did five years ago
. . .'" While she read her husband kept nodding his head very
slightly, but very steadily in sign of approval.</p>

<p>Near by, Miss Allan was reading her letters too. They were not
altogether pleasant, as could be seen from the slight rigidity
which came over her large fine face as she finished reading them
and replaced them neatly in their envelopes. The lines of care
and responsibility on her face made her resemble an elderly man
rather than a woman. The letters brought her news of the failure
of last year's fruit crop in New Zealand, which was a serious
matter, for Hubert, her only brother, made his living on a fruit
farm, and if it failed again, of course, he would throw up his
place, come back to England, and what were they to do with him
this time? The journey out here, which meant the loss of a term's
work, became an extravagance and not the just and wonderful holiday
due to her after fifteen years of punctual lecturing and correcting
essays upon English literature. Emily, her sister, who was a teacher
also, wrote: "We ought to be prepared, though I have no doubt
Hubert will be more reasonable this time." And then went on in
her sensible way to say that she was enjoying a very jolly time
in the Lakes. "They are looking exceedingly pretty just now. I
have seldom seen the trees so forward at this time of year. We
have taken our lunch out several days. Old Alice is as young as
ever, and asks after every one affectionately. The days pass very
quickly, and term will soon be here. Political prospects <em>not</em>
good, I think privately, but do not like to damp Ellen's enthusiasm.
Lloyd George has taken the Bill up, but so have many before now,
and we are where we are; but trust to find myself mistaken. Anyhow,
we have our work cut out for us. . . . Surely Meredith lacks the
<em>human</em> note one likes in W. W.?" she concluded, and went
on to discuss some questions of English literature which Miss
Allan had raised in her last letter.</p>

<p>At a little distance from Miss Allan, on a seat shaded and made
semi-private by a thick clump of palm trees, Arthur and Susan
were reading each other's letters. The big slashing manuscripts
of hockey-playing young women in Wiltshire lay on Arthur's knee,
while Susan deciphered tight little legal hands which rarely filled
more than a page, and always conveyed the same impression of jocular
and breezy goodwill.</p>

<p>"I do hope Mr. Hutchinson will like me, Arthur," she said, looking
up.</p>

<p>"Who's your loving Flo?" asked Arthur.</p>

<p>"Flo Graves&mdash;the girl I told you about, who was engaged to that
dreadful Mr. Vincent," said Susan. "Is Mr. Hutchinson married?"
she asked.</p>

<p>Already her mind was busy with benevolent plans for her friends,
or rather with one magnificent plan&mdash;which was simple too&mdash;they
were all to get married&mdash;at once&mdash;directly she got back. Marriage,
marriage that was the right thing, the only thing, the solution
required by every one she knew, and a great part of her meditations
was spent in tracing every instance of discomfort, loneliness,
ill-health, unsatisfied ambition, restlessness, eccentricity,
taking things up and dropping them again, public speaking, and
philanthropic activity on the part of men and particularly on
the part of women to the fact that they wanted to marry, were
trying to marry, and had not succeeded in getting married. If,
as she was bound to own, these symptoms sometimes persisted after
marriage, she could only ascribe them to the unhappy law of nature
which decreed that there was only one Arthur Venning, and only
one Susan who could marry him. Her theory, of course, had the
merit of being fully supported by her own case. She had been vaguely
uncomfortable at home for two or three years now, and a voyage
like this with her selfish old aunt, who paid her fare but treated
her as servant and companion in one, was typical of the kind of
thing people expected of her. Directly she became engaged, Mrs.
Paley behaved with instinctive respect, positively protested when
Susan as usual knelt down to lace her shoes, and appeared really
grateful for an hour of Susan's company where she had been used
to exact two or three as her right. She therefore foresaw a life
of far greater comfort than she had been used to, and the change
had already produced a great increase of warmth in her feelings
towards other people.</p>

<p>It was close on twenty years now since Mrs. Paley had been able
to lace her own shoes or even to see them, the disappearance of
her feet having coincided more or less accurately with the death
of her husband, a man of business, soon after which event Mrs.
Paley began to grow stout. She was a selfish, independent old
woman, possessed of a considerable income, which she spent upon
the upkeep of a house that needed seven servants and a charwoman
in Lancaster Gate, and another with a garden and carriage-horses
in Surrey. Susan's engagement relieved her of the one great anxiety
of her life&mdash;that her son Christopher should "entangle himself"
with his cousin. Now that this familiar source of interest was
removed, she felt a little low and inclined to see more in Susan
than she used to. She had decided to give her a very handsome
wedding present, a cheque for two hundred, two hundred and fifty,
or possibly, conceivably&mdash;it depended upon the under-gardener
and Huths' bill for doing up the drawing-room&mdash;three hundred pounds
sterling.</p>

<p>She was thinking of this very question, revolving the figures,
as she sat in her wheeled chair with a table spread with cards
by her side. The Patience had somehow got into a muddle, and she
did not like to call for Susan to help her, as Susan seemed to
be busy with Arthur.</p>

<p>"She's every right to expect a handsome present from me, of course,"
she thought, looking vaguely at the leopard on its hind legs,
"and I've no doubt she does! Money goes a long way with every
one. The young are very selfish. If I were to die, nobody would
miss me but Dakyns, and she'll be consoled by the will! However,
I've got no reason to complain. . . . I can still enjoy myself.
I'm not a burden to any-one. . . . I like a great many things
a good deal, in spite of my legs."</p>

<p>Being slightly depressed, however, she went on to think of the
only people she had known who had not seemed to her at all selfish
or fond of money, who had seemed to her somehow rather finer than
the general run; people she willingly acknowledged, who were finer
than she was. There were only two of them. One was her brother,
who had been drowned before her eyes, the other was a girl, her
greatest friend, who had died in giving birth to her first child.
These things had happened some fifty years ago.</p>

<p>"They ought not to have died," she thought. "However, they did&mdash;and
we selfish old creatures go on." The tears came to her eyes; she
felt a genuine regret for them, a kind of respect for their youth
and beauty, and a kind of shame for herself; but the tears did
not fall; and she opened one of those innumerable novels which
she used to pronounce good or bad, or pretty middling, or really
wonderful. "I can't think how people come to imagine such things,"
she would say, taking off her spectacles and looking up with the
old faded eyes, that were becoming ringed with white.</p>

<p>Just behind the stuffed leopard Mr. Elliot was playing chess
with Mr. Pepper. He was being defeated, naturally, for Mr. Pepper
scarcely took his eyes off the board, and Mr. Elliot kept leaning
back in his chair and throwing out remarks to a gentleman who
had only arrived the night before, a tall handsome man, with a
head resembling the head of an intellectual ram. After a few remarks
of a general nature had passed, they were discovering that they
knew some of the same people, as indeed had been obvious from
their appearance directly they saw each other.</p>

<p>"Ah yes, old Truefit," said Mr. Elliot. "He has a son at Oxford.
I've often stayed with them. It's a lovely old Jacobean house.
Some exquisite Greuzes&mdash;one or two Dutch pictures which the old
boy kept in the cellars. Then there were stacks upon stacks of
prints. Oh, the dirt in that house! He was a miser, you know.
The boy married a daughter of Lord Pinwells. I know them too.
The collecting mania tends to run in families. This chap collects
buckles&mdash;men's shoe-buckles they must be, in use between the years
1580 and 1660; the dates mayn't be right, but fact's as I say.
Your true collector always has some unaccountable fad of that
kind. On other points he's as level-headed as a breeder of shorthorns,
which is what he happens to be. Then the Pinwells, as you probably
know, have their share of eccentricity too. Lady Maud, for instance&mdash;"
he was interrupted here by the necessity of considering his move,&mdash;"Lady
Maud has a horror of cats and clergymen, and people with big front
teeth. I've heard her shout across a table, 'Keep your mouth shut,
Miss Smith; they're as yellow as carrots!' across a table, mind
you. To me she's always been civility itself. She dabbles in literature,
likes to collect a few of us in her drawing-room, but mention
a clergyman, a bishop even, nay, the Archbishop himself, and she
gobbles like a turkey-cock. I've been told it's a family feud&mdash;something
to do with an ancestor in the reign of Charles the First. Yes,"
he continued, suffering check after check, "I always like to know
something of the grandmothers of our fashionable young men. In
my opinion they preserve all that we admire in the eighteenth
century, with the advantage, in the majority of cases, that they
are personally clean. Not that one would insult old Lady Barborough
by calling her clean. How often d'you think, Hilda," he called
out to his wife, "her ladyship takes a bath?"</p>

<p>"I should hardly like to say, Hugh," Mrs. Elliot tittered, "but
wearing puce velvet, as she does even on the hottest August day,
it somehow doesn't show."</p>

<p>"Pepper, you have me," said Mr. Elliot. "My chess is even worse
than I remembered." He accepted his defeat with great equanimity,
because he really wished to talk.</p>

<p>He drew his chair beside Mr. Wilfrid Flushing, the newcomer.</p>

<p>"Are these at all in your line?" he asked, pointing at a case
in front of them, where highly polished crosses, jewels, and bits
of embroidery, the work of the natives, were displayed to tempt
visitors.</p>

<p>"Shams, all of them," said Mr. Flushing briefly. "This rug, now,
isn't at all bad." He stopped and picked up a piece of the rug
at their feet. "Not old, of course, but the design is quite in
the right tradition. Alice, lend me your brooch. See the difference
between the old work and the new."</p>

<p>A lady, who was reading with great concentration, unfastened
her brooch and gave it to her husband without looking at him or
acknowledging the tentative bow which Mr. Elliot was desirous
of giving her. If she had listened, she might have been amused
by the reference to old Lady Barborough, her great-aunt, but,
oblivious of her surroundings, she went on reading.</p>

<p>The clock, which had been wheezing for some minutes like an old
man preparing to cough, now struck nine. The sound slightly disturbed
certain somnolent merchants, government officials, and men of
independent means who were lying back in their chairs, chatting,
smoking, ruminating about their affairs, with their eyes half
shut; they raised their lids for an instant at the sound and then
closed them again. They had the appearance of crocodiles so fully
gorged by their last meal that the future of the world gives them
no anxiety whatever. The only disturbance in the placid bright
room was caused by a large moth which shot from light to light,
whizzing over elaborate heads of hair, and causing several young
women to raise their hands nervously and exclaim, "Some one ought
to kill it!"</p>

<p>Absorbed in their own thoughts, Hewet and Hirst had not spoken
for a long time.</p>

<p>When the clock struck, Hirst said:</p>

<p>"Ah, the creatures begin to stir. . . ." He watched them raise
themselves, look about them, and settle down again. "What I abhor
most of all," he concluded, "is the female breast. Imagine being
Venning and having to get into bed with Susan! But the really
repulsive thing is that they feel nothing at all&mdash;about what I
do when I have a hot bath. They're gross, they're absurd, they're
utterly intolerable!"</p>

<p>So saying, and drawing no reply from Hewet, he proceeded to think
about himself, about science, about Cambridge, about the Bar,
about Helen and what she thought of him, until, being very tired,
he was nodding off to sleep.</p>

<p>Suddenly Hewet woke him up.</p>

<p>"How d'you know what you feel, Hirst?"</p>

<p>"Are you in love?" asked Hirst. He put in his eyeglass.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," said Hewet.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll sit down and think about it," said Hirst. "One really
ought to. If these people would only think about things, the world
would be a far better place for us all to live in. Are you trying
to think?"</p>

<p>That was exactly what Hewet had been doing for the last half-hour,
but he did not find Hirst sympathetic at the moment.</p>

<p>"I shall go for a walk," he said.</p>

<p>"Remember we weren't in bed last night," said Hirst with a prodigious
yawn.</p>

<p>Hewet rose and stretched himself.</p>

<p>"I want to go and get a breath of air," he said.</p>

<p>An unusual feeling had been bothering him all the evening and
forbidding him to settle into any one train of thought. It was
precisely as if he had been in the middle of a talk which interested
him profoundly when some one came up and interrupted him. He could
not finish the talk, and the longer he sat there the more he wanted
to finish it. As the talk that had been interrupted was a talk
with Rachel, he had to ask himself why he felt this, and why he
wanted to go on talking to her. Hirst would merely say that he
was in love with her. But he was not in love with her. Did love
begin in that way, with the wish to go on talking? No. It always
began in his case with definite physical sensations, and these
were now absent, he did not even find her physically attractive.
There was something, of course, unusual about her&mdash;she was young,
inexperienced, and inquisitive, they had been more open with each
other than was usually possible. He always found girls interesting
to talk to, and surely these were good reasons why he should wish
to go on talking to her; and last night, what with the crowd and
the confusion, he had only been able to begin to talk to her.
What was she doing now? Lying on a sofa and looking at the ceiling,
perhaps. He could imagine her doing that, and Helen in an arm-chair,
with her hands on the arm of it, so&mdash;looking ahead of her, with
her great big eyes&mdash;oh no, they'd be talking, of course, about
the dance. But suppose Rachel was going away in a day or two,
suppose this was the end of her visit, and her father had arrived
in one of the steamers anchored in the bay,&mdash;it was intolerable
to know so little. Therefore he exclaimed, "How d'you know what
you feel, Hirst?" to stop himself from thinking.</p>

<p>But Hirst did not help him, and the other people with their aimless
movements and their unknown lives were disturbing, so that he
longed for the empty darkness. The first thing he looked for when
he stepped out of the hall door was the light of the Ambroses'
villa. When he had definitely decided that a certain light apart
from the others higher up the hill was their light, he was considerably
reassured. There seemed to be at once a little stability in all
this incoherence. Without any definite plan in his head, he took
the turning to the right and walked through the town and came
to the wall by the meeting of the roads, where he stopped. The
booming of the sea was audible. The dark-blue mass of the mountains
rose against the paler blue of the sky. There was no moon, but
myriads of stars, and lights were anchored up and down in the
dark waves of earth all round him. He had meant to go back, but
the single light of the Ambroses' villa had now become three separate
lights, and he was tempted to go on. He might as well make sure
that Rachel was still there. Walking fast, he soon stood by the
iron gate of their garden, and pushed it open; the outline of
the house suddenly appeared sharply before his eyes, and the thin
column of the verandah cutting across the palely lit gravel of
the terrace. He hesitated. At the back of the house some one was
rattling cans. He approached the front; the light on the terrace
showed him that the sitting-rooms were on that side. He stood
as near the light as he could by the corner of the house, the
leaves of a creeper brushing his face. After a moment he could
hear a voice. The voice went on steadily; it was not talking,
but from the continuity of the sound it was a voice reading aloud.
He crept a little closer; he crumpled the leaves together so as
to stop their rustling about his ears. It might be Rachel's voice.
He left the shadow and stepped into the radius of the light, and
then heard a sentence spoken quite distinctly.</p>

<p>"And there we lived from the year 1860 to 1895, the happiest
years of my parents' lives, and there in 1862 my brother Maurice
was born, to the delight of his parents, as he was destined to
be the delight of all who knew him."</p>

<p>The voice quickened, and the tone became conclusive rising slightly
in pitch, as if these words were at the end of the chapter. Hewet
drew back again into the shadow. There was a long silence. He
could just hear chairs being moved inside. He had almost decided
to go back, when suddenly two figures appeared at the window,
not six feet from him.</p>

<p>"It was Maurice Fielding, of course, that your mother was engaged
to," said Helen's voice. She spoke reflectively, looking out into
the dark garden, and thinking evidently as much of the look of
the night as of what she was saying.</p>

<p>"Mother?" said Rachel. Hewet's heart leapt, and he noticed the
fact. Her voice, though low, was full of surprise.</p>

<p>"You didn't know that?" said Helen.</p>

<p>"I never knew there'd been any one else," said Rachel. She was
clearly surprised, but all they said was said low and inexpressively,
because they were speaking out into the cool dark night.</p>

<p>"More people were in love with her than with any one I've ever
known," Helen stated. "She had that power&mdash;she enjoyed things.
She wasn't beautiful, but &mdash;I was thinking of her last night
at the dance. She got on with every kind of person, and then she
made it all so amazingly&mdash;funny."</p>

<p>It appeared that Helen was going back into the past, choosing
her words deliberately, comparing Theresa with the people she
had known since Theresa died.</p>

<p>"I don't know how she did it," she continued, and ceased, and
there was a long pause, in which a little owl called first here,
then there, as it moved from tree to tree in the garden.</p>

<p>"That's so like Aunt Lucy and Aunt Katie," said Rachel at last.
"They always make out that she was very sad and very good."</p>

<p>"Then why, for goodness' sake, did they do nothing but criticize
her when she was alive?" said Helen. Very gentle their voices
sounded, as if they fell through the waves of the sea.</p>

<p>"If I were to die to-morrow . . ." she began.</p>

<p>The broken sentences had an extraordinary beauty and detachment
in Hewet's ears, and a kind of mystery too, as though they were
spoken by people in their sleep.</p>

<p>"No, Rachel," Helen's voice continued, "I'm not going to walk
in the garden; it's damp&mdash;it's sure to be damp; besides, I see
at least a dozen toads."</p>

<p>"Toads? Those are stones, Helen. Come out. It's nicer out. The
flowers smell," Rachel replied.</p>

<p>Hewet drew still farther back. His heart was beating very quickly.
Apparently Rachel tried to pull Helen out on to the terrace, and
Helen resisted. There was a certain amount of scuffling, entreating,
resisting, and laughter from both of them. Then a man's form appeared.
Hewet could not hear what they were all saying. In a minute they
had gone in; he could hear bolts grating then; there was dead
silence, and all the lights went out.</p>

<p>He turned away, still crumpling and uncrumpling a handful of
leaves which he had torn from the wall. An exquisite sense of
pleasure and relief possessed him; it was all so solid and peaceful
after the ball at the hotel, whether he was in love with them
or not, and he was not in love with them; no, but it was good
that they should be alive.</p>

<p>After standing still for a minute or two he turned and began
to walk towards the gate. With the movement of his body, the excitement,
the romance and the richness of life crowded into his brain. He
shouted out a line of poetry, but the words escaped him, and he
stumbled among lines and fragments of lines which had no meaning
at all except for the beauty of the words. He shut the gate, and
ran swinging from side to side down the hill, shouting any nonsense
that came into his head. "Here am I," he cried rhythmically, as
his feet pounded to the left and to the right, "plunging along,
like an elephant in the jungle, stripping the branches as I go
(he snatched at the twigs of a bush at the roadside), roaring
innumerable words, lovely words about innumerable things, running
downhill and talking nonsense aloud to myself about roads and
leaves and lights and women coming out into the darkness&mdash;about
women&mdash;about Rachel, about Rachel." He stopped and drew a deep
breath. The night seemed immense and hospitable, and although
so dark there seemed to be things moving down there in the harbour
and movement out at sea. He gazed until the darkness numbed him,
and then he walked on quickly, still murmuring to himself. "And
I ought to be in bed, snoring and dreaming, dreaming, dreaming.
Dreams and realities, dreams and realities, dreams and realities,"
he repeated all the way up the avenue, scarcely knowing what he
said, until he reached the front door. Here he paused for a second,
and collected himself before he opened the door.</p>

<p>His eyes were dazed, his hands very cold, and his brain excited
and yet half asleep. Inside the door everything was as he had
left it except that the hall was now empty. There were the chairs
turning in towards each other where people had sat talking, and
the empty glasses on little tables, and the newspapers scattered
on the floor. As he shut the door he felt as if he were enclosed
in a square box, and instantly shrivelled up. It was all very
bright and very small. He stopped for a minute by the long table
to find a paper which he had meant to read, but he was still too
much under the influence of the dark and the fresh air to consider
carefully which paper it was or where he had seen it.</p>

<p>As he fumbled vaguely among the papers he saw a figure cross
the tail of his eye, coming downstairs. He heard the swishing
sound of skirts, and to his great surprise, Evelyn M. came up
to him, laid her hand on the table as if to prevent him from taking
up a paper, and said:</p>

<p>"You're just the person I wanted to talk to." Her voice was a
little unpleasant and metallic, her eyes were very bright, and
she kept them fixed upon him.</p>

<p>"To talk to me?" he repeated. "But I'm half asleep."</p>

<p>"But I think you understand better than most people," she answered,
and sat down on a little chair placed beside a big leather chair
so that Hewet had to sit down beside her.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said. He yawned openly, and lit a cigarette. He could
not believe that this was really happening to him. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Are you really sympathetic, or is it just a pose?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"It's for you to say," he replied. "I'm interested, I think."
He still felt numb all over and as if she was much too close to
him.</p>

<p>"Any one can be interested!" she cried impatiently. "Your friend
Mr. Hirst's interested, I daresay however, I do believe in you.
You look as if you'd got a nice sister, somehow." She paused,
picking at some sequins on her knees, and then, as if she had
made up her mind, she started off, "Anyhow, I'm going to ask your
advice. D'you ever get into a state where you don't know your
own mind? That's the state I'm in now. You see, last night at
the dance Raymond Oliver,&mdash;he's the tall dark boy who looks as
if he had Indian blood in him, but he says he's not really,&mdash;well,
we were sitting out together, and he told me all about himself,
how unhappy he is at home, and how he hates being out here. They've
put him into some beastly mining business. He says it's beastly
&mdash;I should like it, I know, but that's neither here nor there.
And I felt awfully sorry for him, one couldn't help being sorry
for him, and when he asked me to let him kiss me, I did. I don't
see any harm in that, do you? And then this morning he said he'd
thought I meant something more, and I wasn't the sort to let any
one kiss me. And we talked and talked. I daresay I was very silly,
but one can't help liking people when one's sorry for them. I
do like him most awfully&mdash;" She paused. "So I gave him half a
promise, and then, you see, there's Alfred Perrott."</p>

<p>"Oh, Perrott," said Hewet.</p>

<p>"We got to know each other on that picnic the other day," she
continued. "He seemed so lonely, especially as Arthur had gone
off with Susan, and one couldn't help guessing what was in his
mind. So we had quite a long talk when you were looking at the
ruins, and he told me all about his life, and his struggles, and
how fearfully hard it had been. D'you know, he was a boy in a
grocer's shop and took parcels to people's houses in a basket?
That interested me awfully, because I always say it doesn't matter
how you're born if you've got the right stuff in you. And he told
me about his sister who's paralysed, poor girl, and one can see
she's a great trial, though he's evidently very devoted to her.
I must say I do admire people like that! I don't expect you do
because you're so clever. Well, last night we sat out in the garden
together, and I couldn't help seeing what he wanted to say, and
comforting him a little, and telling him I did care &mdash;I really
do&mdash;only, then, there's Raymond Oliver. What I want you to tell
me is, can one be in love with two people at once, or can't one?"</p>

<p>She became silent, and sat with her chin on her hands, looking
very intent, as if she were facing a real problem which had to
be discussed between them.</p>

<p>"I think it depends what sort of person you are," said Hewet.
He looked at her. She was small and pretty, aged perhaps twenty-eight
or twenty-nine, but though dashing and sharply cut, her features
expressed nothing very clearly, except a great deal of spirit
and good health.</p>

<p>"Who are you, what are you; you see, I know nothing about you,"
he continued.</p>

<p>"Well, I was coming to that," said Evelyn M. She continued to
rest her chin on her hands and to look intently ahead of her.
"I'm the daughter of a mother and no father, if that interests
you," she said. "It's not a very nice thing to be. It's what often
happens in the country. She was a farmer's daughter, and he was
rather a swell&mdash;the young man up at the great house. He never
made things straight&mdash;never married her&mdash;though he allowed us
quite a lot of money. His people wouldn't let him. Poor father!
I can't help liking him. Mother wasn't the sort of woman who could
keep him straight, anyhow. He was killed in the war. I believe
his men worshipped him. They say great big troopers broke down
and cried over his body on the battlefield. I wish I'd known him.
Mother had all the life crushed out of her. The world&mdash;" She clenched
her fist. "Oh, people can be horrid to a woman like that!" She
turned upon Hewet.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "d'you want to know any more about me?"</p>

<p>"But you?" he asked, "Who looked after you?"</p>

<p>"I've looked after myself mostly," she laughed. "I've had splendid
friends. I do like people! That's the trouble. What would you
do if you liked two people, both of them tremendously, and you
couldn't tell which most?"</p>

<p>"I should go on liking them &mdash;I should wait and see. Why
not?"</p>

<p>"But one has to make up one's mind," said Evelyn. "Or are you
one of the people who doesn't believe in marriages and all that?
Look here&mdash;this isn't fair, I do all the telling, and you tell
nothing. Perhaps you're the same as your friend"&mdash;she looked at
him suspiciously; "perhaps you don't like me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know you," said Hewet.</p>

<p>"I know when I like a person directly I see them! I knew I liked
you the very first night at dinner. Oh dear," she continued impatiently,
"what a lot of bother would be saved if only people would say
the things they think straight out! I'm made like that. I can't
help it."</p>

<p>"But don't you find it leads to difficulties?" Hewet asked.</p>

<p>"That's men's fault," she answered. "They always drag it in&mdash;love,
I mean."</p>

<p>"And so you've gone on having one proposal after another," said
Hewet.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose I've had more proposals than most women," said
Evelyn, but she spoke without conviction.</p>

<p>"Five, six, ten?" Hewet ventured.</p>

<p>Evelyn seemed to intimate that perhaps ten was the right figure,
but that it really was not a high one.</p>

<p>"I believe you're thinking me a heartless flirt," she protested.
"But I don't care if you are. I don't care what any one thinks
of me. Just because one's interested and likes to be friends with
men, and talk to them as one talks to women, one's called a flirt."</p>

<p>"But Miss Murgatroyd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish you'd call me Evelyn," she interrupted.</p>

<p>"After ten proposals do you honestly think that men are the same
as women?"</p>

<p>"Honestly, honestly,&mdash;how I hate that word! It's always used
by prigs," cried Evelyn. "Honestly I think they ought to be. That's
what's so disappointing. Every time one thinks it's not going
to happen, and every time it does."</p>

<p>"The pursuit of Friendship," said Hewet. "The title of a comedy."</p>

<p>"You're horrid," she cried. "You don't care a bit really. You
might be Mr. Hirst."</p>

<p>"Well," said Hewet, "let's consider. Let us consider&mdash;" He paused,
because for the moment he could not remember what it was that
they had to consider. He was far more interested in her than in
her story, for as she went on speaking his numbness had disappeared,
and he was conscious of a mixture of liking, pity, and distrust.
"You've promised to marry both Oliver and Perrott?" he concluded.</p>

<p>"Not exactly promised," said Evelyn. "I can't make up my mind
which I really like best. Oh how I detest modern life!" she flung
off. "It must have been so much easier for the Elizabethans! I
thought the other day on that mountain how I'd have liked to be
one of those colonists, to cut down trees and make laws and all
that, instead of fooling about with all these people who think
one's just a pretty young lady. Though I'm not. I really might
<em>do</em> something." She reflected in silence for a minute.
Then she said:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid right down in my heart that Alfred Perrot <em>won't</em>
do. He's not strong, is he?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he couldn't cut down a tree," said Hewet. "Have you
never cared for anybody?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I've cared for heaps of people, but not to marry them," she
said. "I suppose I'm too fastidious. All my life I've wanted somebody
I could look up to, somebody great and big and splendid. Most
men are so small."</p>

<p>"What d'you mean by splendid?" Hewet asked. "People are&mdash;nothing
more."</p>

<p>Evelyn was puzzled.</p>

<p>"We don't care for people because of their qualities," he tried
to explain. "It's just them that we care for,"&mdash;he struck a match&mdash;"just
that," he said, pointing to the flames.</p>

<p>"I see what you mean," she said, "but I don't agree. I do know
why I care for people, and I think I'm hardly ever wrong. I see
at once what they've got in them. Now I think you must be rather
splendid; but not Mr. Hirst."</p>

<p>Hewlet shook his head.</p>

<p>"He's not nearly so unselfish, or so sympathetic, or so big,
or so understanding," Evelyn continued.</p>

<p>Hewet sat silent, smoking his cigarette.</p>

<p>"I should hate cutting down trees," he remarked.</p>

<p>"I'm not trying to flirt with you, though I suppose you think
I am!" Evelyn shot out. "I'd never have come to you if I'd thought
you'd merely think odious things of me!" The tears came into her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you never flirt?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of course I don't," she protested. "Haven't I told you? I want
friendship; I want to care for some one greater and nobler than
I am, and if they fall in love with me it isn't my fault; I don't
want it; I positively hate it."</p>

<p>Hewet could see that there was very little use in going on with
the conversation, for it was obvious that Evelyn did not wish
to say anything in particular, but to impress upon him an image
of herself, being, for some reason which she would not reveal,
unhappy, or insecure. He was very tired, and a pale waiter kept
walking ostentatiously into the middle of the room and looking
at them meaningly.</p>

<p>"They want to shut up," he said. "My advice is that you should
tell Oliver and Perrott to-morrow that you've made up your mind
that you don't mean to marry either of them. I'm certain you don't.
If you change your mind you can always tell them so. They're both
sensible men; they'll understand. And then all this bother will
be over." He got up.</p>

<p>But Evelyn did not move. She sat looking up at him with her bright
eager eyes, in the depths of which he thought he detected some
disappointment, or dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>"Good-night," he said.</p>

<p>"There are heaps of things I want to say to you still," she said.
"And I'm going to, some time. I suppose you must go to bed now?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hewet. "I'm half asleep." He left her still sitting
by herself in the empty hall.</p>

<p>"Why is it that they <em>won't</em> be honest?" he muttered to
himself as he went upstairs. Why was it that relations between
different people were so unsatisfactory, so fragmentary, so hazardous,
and words so dangerous that the instinct to sympathise with another
human being was an instinct to be examined carefully and probably
crushed? What had Evelyn really wished to say to him? What was
she feeling left alone in the empty hall? The mystery of life
and the unreality even of one's own sensations overcame him as
he walked down the corridor which led to his room. It was dimly
lighted, but sufficiently for him to see a figure in a bright
dressing-gown pass swiftly in front of him, the figure of a woman
crossing from one room to another.</p>
