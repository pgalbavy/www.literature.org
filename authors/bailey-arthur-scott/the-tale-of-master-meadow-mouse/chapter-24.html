<p>LIVING, as he did, near the mill pond, Master Meadow Mouse saw a great
deal of Paddy Muskrat. They had a number of tastes in common. They both
liked lily bulbs. They both enjoyed swimming. They both disliked Peter
Mink. They were bound to become great cronies--if for no other reason
than the last.
</p>
<p>By spring Paddy Muskrat knew Master Meadow Mouse well enough to ask him
a very intimate question.
</p><p>"Why does everybody call you 'Master'?" he inquired one day.
</p><p>Master Meadow Mouse looked at him in a puzzled fashion for a moment or
two.
</p><p>"I don't know," he answered. "I don't know why, unless it's because they
<u>always have</u> called me that. Don't you think it's a good name?" he
asked Paddy Muskrat a bit anxiously.
</p><p>"Oh, yes!" Paddy assured him. "There's no doubt that it's a good enough
name. But it's one that's given to a youngster--to a mere child."
</p><p>"I'm not a youngster!" Master Meadow Mouse cried. "Nobody can call me
<u>young</u>. I'm almost a year old!"
</p><p>"I thought so," said Paddy Muskrat, as if he knew he couldn't have been
mistaken. "You're grown up. And yet they still call you 'Master' Meadow
Mouse. If I were you I'd get folks to change that."
</p><p>It was plain that Master Meadow Mouse agreed with him in every way. He
had already made up his mind that he wouldn't answer to the name of
'Master' Meadow Mouse any longer. And he told Paddy Muskrat as much.
</p><p>"If they want me to answer after this, they'll have to call me something
else," he declared. "Now, what would you suggest?"
</p><p>Paddy Muskrat said he needed time to think the matter over. And he
thought that he'd like to consult his wife, who always had an opinion.
</p><p>"Wait here till I come back!" he told Master Meadow Mouse. And, diving
into the water, he swam home. He was back in a few minutes, with a broad
smile upon his face. "I've thought of the very thing!" he exclaimed.
"Or, at least, my wife has. She says, 'Call him "Mister," of course'!"
</p><p>"That's fine!" cried Master Meadow Mouse. "I'm sure I couldn't have
thought of that if I'd tried all summer. And now," he added, "I must go
and tell everybody about this sudden change."
</p><p>So he hurried home. And, calling everybody around him, he explained that
he was a year old, and that he had successfully dodged Miss Kitty Cat,
Tommy Fox, Solomon Owl, Ferdinand Frog, Peter Mink, Old Mr. Crow and
goodness only knew how many other dangerous folk.
</p><p>"I'm grown up now," he told his hearers. "From this time on I expect
everybody to call me <u>Mister</u> Meadow Mouse."
</p><p>And everybody said that a new name was no more than he deserved. They
all approved his choice.
</p><p>No! There was just one among all the company that was opposed to the
change. He snorted and started to say something disagreeable. And for
once everybody told Uncle Billy (for it was he!) to be quiet.
</p><p>And that was the end of Master Meadow Mouse.
