<p>Nothing could have been more evident than William's difficulties.
They continued to exist, with equal obviousness, when the group
broke up in some confusion, after a few minutes of animated discussion;
Mr. Wallace Banks, that busy and executive youth, bearing Miss
Pratt triumphantly off to the lemonade-punch-bowl, while William
pursued Johnnie Watson and Joe Bullitt. He sought to detain them
near the edge of the platform, though they appeared far from anxious
to linger in his company; and he was able to arrest their attention
only by clutching an arm of each. In fact, the good feeling which
had latterly prevailed among these three appeared to be in danger
of disintegrating. The occasion was too vital; and the watchword
for "Miss Pratt's last night" was Devil-Take-the-Hindmost!</p>

<p>"Now you look here, Johnnie," William said, vehemently, "and
you listen, too, Joe! You both got seven dances apiece with her,
anyway, all on account of my not getting here early enough, and
you got to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It wasn't because of any such reason," young Mr. Watson protested.
"I asked her for mine two days ago."</p>

<p>"Well, <em>THAT </em>wasn't fair, was it?" William cried. "Just
because I never thought of sneaking in ahead like that, you go
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you ought to thought of it," Johnnie retorted, jerking
his arm free of William's grasp. "I can't stand here <em>GABBIN'
</em>all night!" And he hurried away.</p>

<p>"Joe," William began, fastening more securely upon Mr. Bullitt&mdash;"Joe,
I've done a good many favors for you, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've got to see a man," Mr. Bullitt interrupted. "Lemme go,
Silly Bill. There's some body I got to see right away before the
next dance begins. I <em>GOT </em>to! Honest I have!"</p>

<p>William seized him passionately by the lapels of his coat. "Listen,
Joe. For goodness' sake can't you listen a <em>MINUTE? </em>You
<em>GOT </em>to give me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Honest, Bill," his friend expostulated, backing away as forcefully
as possible, "I got to find a fellow that's here to-night and
ask him about something important before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ye gods! Can't you wait a <em>MINUTE?" </em>William cried, keeping
his grip upon Joe's lapels. "You <em>GOT </em>to give me anyway
<em>TWO </em>out of all your dances with her! You heard her tell
me, yourself, that she'd be willing if you or Johnnie or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I only got five or six with her, and a couple extras.
Johnnie's got seven. Whyn't you go after Johnnie? I bet he'd help
you out, all right, if you kept after him. What you want to pester
ME for, Bill?"</p>

<p>The brutal selfishness of this speech, as well as its cold-blooded
insincerity, produced in William the impulse to smite. Fortunately,
his only hope lay in persuasion, and after a momentary struggle
with his own features he was able to conceal what he desired to
do to Joe's.</p>

<p>He swallowed, and, increasing the affectionate desperation of
his clutch upon Mr. Bullitt's lapels, "Joe," he began, huskily&mdash;"Joe,
if <em>I</em>'d got six reg'lar and two extras with Miss Pratt
her last night here, and you got here late, and it wasn't your
fault &mdash;I couldn't help being late, could I? It wasn't my
fault I was late, I guess, was it? Well, if I was in <em>YOUR
</em>place I wouldn't act the way you and Johnnie do&mdash;not in a
thousand years I wouldn't! I'd say, 'You want a couple o' my dances
with Miss Pratt, ole man? Why, <em>CERTAINLY</em>&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Yes, you would!" was the cynical comment of Mr. Bullitt, whose
averted face and reluctant shoulders indicated a strong desire
to conclude the interview. "To-night, especially!" he added.</p>

<p>"Look here, Joe," said William, desperately, "don't you realize
that this is the very last night Miss Pratt's going to be in this
town?"</p>

<p>"You bet I do!" These words, though vehement, were inaudible;
being formed in the mind of Mr. Bullitt, but, for diplomatic reasons,
not projected upon the air by his vocal organs.</p>

<p>William continued: "Joe, you and I have been friends ever since
you and I were boys." He spoke with emotion, but Joe had no appearance
of being favorably impressed. "And when I look back," said William,
"I expect I've done more favors for you than I ever have for any
oth&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mr. Bullitt briskly interrupted this appealing reminiscence.
"Listen here, Silly Bill," he said, becoming all at once friendly
and encouraging&mdash;"Bill, there's other girls here you can get dances
with. There's one or two of 'em sittin' around in the yard. You
can have a bully time, even if you did come late." And, with the
air of discharging happily all the obligations of which William
had reminded him, he added, "I'll tell you <em>THAT </em>much,
Bill!"</p>

<p>"Joe, you got to give me anyway <em>ONE </em>da&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look!" said Mr. Bullitt, eagerly. "Look sittin' yonder, over
under that tree all by herself! That's a visiting girl named Miss
Boke; she's visiting some old uncle or something she's got livin'
here, and I bet you could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Joe, you <em>GOT </em>to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I bet that Miss Boke's a good dancer, Bill," Joe continued,
warmly. "May Parcher says so. She was tryin' to get me to dance
with her myself, but I couldn't, or I would of. Honest, Bill,
I would of! Bill, if I was you I'd sail right in there before
anybody else got a start, and I'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ole man," said William, gently, "you remember the time Miss
Pratt and I had an engagement to go walkin', and you wouldn't
of seen her for a week on account of your aunt dyin' in Kansas
City, if I hadn't let you go along with us? Ole man, if you&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the music sounded for the next dance, and Joe felt that it
was indeed time to end this uncomfortable conversation. "I got
to go, Bill,"  he said. "I <em>GOT </em>to!"</p>

<p>"Wait just one minute," William implored. "I want to say just
this: if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here!" exclaimed Mr. Bullitt. "I got to GO!"</p>

<p>"I know it. That's why&mdash;"</p>

<p>Heedless of remonstrance, Joe wrenched himself free, for it would
have taken a powerful and ruthless man to detain him longer. "What
you take me for?" he demanded, indignantly. "I got this with Miss
<em>PRATT</em>!"</p>

<p>And evading a hand which still sought to clutch him, he departed
hotly.</p>

<p>... Mr. Parcher's voice expressed wonder, a little later, as
he recommended his wife to turn her gaze in the direction of "that
Baxter boy" again. "Just look at him!" said Mr. Parcher. "His
face has got more genuine idiocy in it than I've seen around here
yet, and God knows I've been seeing some miracles in that line
this summer!"</p>

<p>"He's looking at Lola Pratt," said Mrs. Parcher.</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose I can see that?" Mr. Parcher returned, with
some irritation. "That's what's the trouble with him. Why don't
he <em>QUIT </em>looking at her?"</p>

<p>"I think probably he feels badly because she's dancing with one
of the other boys," said his wife, mildly.</p>

<p>"Then why can't he dance with somebody else himself?" Mr. Parcher
inquired, testily. "Instead of standing around like a calf looking
out of the butcher's wagon! By George! he looks as if he was just
going to <em>MOO</em>!"</p>

<p>"Of course he ought to be dancing with somebody," Mrs. Parcher
remarked, thoughtfully. "There are one or two more girls than
boys here, and he's the only boy not dancing. I believe I'll&mdash;"
And, not stopping to complete the sentence, she rose and walked
across the interval of grass to William. "Good evening, William,"
she said, pleasantly. "Don't you want to dance?"</p>

<p>"Ma'am?" said William, blankly, and the eyes he turned upon here
were glassy with anxiety. He was still determined to dance on
and on and on with Miss Pratt, but he realized that there were
great obstacles to be overcome before he could begin the process.
He was feverishly awaiting the next interregnum between dances&mdash;then
he would show Joe Bullitt and Johnnie Watson and Wallace Banks,
and some others who had set themselves in his way, that he was
"abs'lutely not goin' to stand it!"</p>

<p>He couldn't stand it, he told himself, even if he wanted to&mdash;not
to-night! He had "been through enough" in order to get to the
party, he thought, thus defining sufferings connected with his
costume, and now that he was here he <em>WOULD </em>dance and
dance, on and on, with Miss Pratt. Anything else was unthinkable.</p>

<p>He <em>HAD </em>to!</p>

<p>"Don't you want to dance?" Mrs. Parcher repeated. "Have you looked
around for a girl without a partner?"</p>

<p>He continued to stare at her, plainly having no comprehension
of her meaning.</p>

<p>"Girl?" he echoed, in a tone of feeble inquiry.</p>

<p>She smiled and nodded, taking his arm. "You come with me," she
said. "I'LL fix you up!"</p>

<p>William suffered her to conduct him across the yard. Intensely
preoccupied with what he meant to do as soon as the music paused,
he was somewhat hazy, but when he perceived that he was being
led in the direction of a girl, sitting solitary under one of
the maple-trees, the sudden shock of fear aroused his faculties.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;where&mdash;" he stammered, halting and seeking to detach himself
from his hostess.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I got &mdash;I got to&mdash;" William began, uneasily. "I got to&mdash;"</p>

<p>His purpose was to excuse himself on the ground that he had to
find a man and tell him something important before the next dance,
for in the confusion of the moment his powers refused him greater
originality. But the vital part of his intended excuse remained
unspoken, being disregarded and cut short, as millions of other
masculine diplomacies have been, throughout the centuries, by
the decisive action of ladies.</p>

<p>Miss Boke had been sitting under the mapletree for a long time&mdash;so
long, indeed, that she was acquiring a profound distaste for forestry
and even for maple syrup. In fact, her state of mind was as desperate,
in its way, as William's; and when a hostess leads a youth (in
almost perfectly fitting conventional black) toward a girl who
has been sitting alone through dance after dance, that girl knows
what that youth is going to have to do.</p>

<p>It must be confessed for Miss Boke that her eyes had been upon
William from the moment Mrs. Parcher addressed him. Nevertheless,
as the pair came toward her she looked casually away in an indifferent
manner. And yet this may have been but a seeming unconsciousness,
for upon the very instant of William's halting, and before he
had managed to stammer "I got to&mdash;" for the fourth time, Miss
Boke sprang to her feet and met Mrs. Parcher more than halfway.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Parcher!" she called, coming forward.</p>

<p>"I got&mdash;" the panic-stricken William again hastily began. "I
got to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Parcher," cried Miss Boke, "I've been SO worried! There's
a candle in that Japanese lantern just over your head, and I think
it's going out."</p>

<p>"I'll run and get a fresh one in a minute," said Mrs. Parcher,
smiling benevolently and retaining William's arm with a little
difficulty. "We were just coming to find you. I've brought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I got to &mdash;I got to find a m&mdash;" William made a last, stricken
effort.</p>

<p>"Miss Boke, this is Mr. Baxter," said Mrs. Parcher, and she added,
with what seemed to William hideous garrulity, "He and you both
came late, dear, and he hasn't any dances engaged, either. So
run and dance, and have a nice time together."</p>

<p>Thereupon this disastrous woman returned to her husband. Her
look was conscientious; she thought she had done something pleasant!</p>

<p>The full horror of his position was revealed to William in the
relieved, confident, proprietor's smile of Miss Boke. For William
lived by a code from which no previous experience had taught him
any means of escape. Mrs. Parcher had made the statement&mdash;so needless
and so ruinous&mdash;that he had no engagements; and in his dismay
he had been unable to deny this fatal truth; he had been obliged
to let it stand. Henceforth, he was committed absolutely to Miss
Boke until either some one else asked her to dance, or (while
yet in her close company) William could obtain an engagement with
another girl. The latter alternative presented certain grave difficulties,
also contracting William to dance with the other girl before once
more obtaining his freedom, but undeniably he regarded it from
the first as the more hopeful.</p>

<p>He had to give form to the fatal invitation. "M'av this dance
'thyou?"  he muttered, doggedly.</p>

<p>"Vurry pleased to!" Miss Boke responded, whereupon they walked
in silence to the platform, stepped upon its surface, and embraced.</p>

<p>They made a false start.</p>

<p>They made another.</p>

<p>They stood swaying to catch the time; then made another. After
that they tried again, and were saved from a fall only by spasmodic
and noticeable contortions.</p>

<p>Miss Boke laughed tolerantly, as if forgiving William for his
awkwardness, and his hot heart grew hotter with that injustice.
She was a large, ample girl, weighing more than William (this
must be definitely claimed in his behalf), and she had been spending
the summer at a lakeside hotel where she had constantly danced
"man's part." To paint William's predicament at a stroke, his
partner was a determined rather than a graceful dancer&mdash;and their
efforts to attune themselves to each other and to the music were
in a fair way to attract general attention.</p>

<p>A coarse chuckle, a half-suppressed snort, assailed William's
scarlet ear, and from the corner of his eye he caught a glimpse
of Joe Bullitt gliding by, suffused; while over Joe's detested
shoulder could be seen the adorable and piquant face of the One
girl&mdash;also suffused.</p>

<p>"Doggone it!" William panted.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't be discouraged with yourself," said Miss Boke,
genially. "I've met lots of Men that had trouble to get started
and turned out to be right good dancers, after all. It seems to
me we're kind of workin' against each other. I'll tell you&mdash;you
kind of let me do the guiding and I'll get you going fine. Now!
<em>ONE, </em>two, <em>ONE, </em>two! There!"</p>

<p>William ceased to struggle for dominance, and their efforts to
"get started" were at once successful. With a muscular power that
was surprising, Miss Boke bore him out into the circling current,
swung him round and round, walked him backward half across the
platform, then swung him round and round and round again. For
a girl, she "guided"  remarkably well; nevertheless, a series
of collisions, varying in intensity, marked the path of the pair
upon the rather crowded platform. In such emergencies Miss Boke
proved herself deft in swinging William to act as a buffer, and
he several times found himself heavily stricken from the rear;
anon his face would be pressed suffocatingly into Miss Boke's
hair, without the slightest wish on his part for such intimacy.
He had a helpless feeling, fully warranted by the circumstances.
Also, he soon became aware that Miss Boke's powerful "guiding"
was observed by the public; for, after one collision, more severe
than others, a low voice hissed in his ear:</p>

<p>"<em>SHE WON'T HURT YOU MUCH, SILLY BILL. SHE'S ONLY IN FUN</em>!"</p>

<p>This voice belonged to the dancer with whom he had just been
in painful contact, Johnnie Watson. However, Johnnie had whirled
far upon another orbit before William found a retort, and then
it was a feeble one.</p>

<p>"I wish <em>YOU'D </em>try a few dances with her!" he whispered,
inaudibly, but with unprecedented bitterness, as the masterly
arm of his partner just saved him from going over the edge of
the platform. "I bet she'd kill you!"</p>

<p>More than once he tried to assert himself and resume his natural
place as guide, but each time he did so he immediately got out
of step with his partner, their knees collided embarrassingly,
they staggered and walked upon each other's insteps&mdash;and William
was forced to abandon the unequal contest.</p>

<p>"I just love dancing," said Miss Boke, serenely. "Don't you,
Mr. Baxter?"</p>

<p>"What?" he gulped. "Yeh."</p>

<p>"It's a beautiful floor for dancing, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yeh."</p>

<p>"I just love dancing," Miss Boke thought proper to declare again.
"Don't you love it, Mr. Baxter?"</p>

<p>This time he considered his enthusiasm to be sufficiently indicated
by a nod. He needed all his breath.</p>

<p>"It's lovely," she murmured. "I hope they don't play 'Home, Sweet
Home' very early at parties in this town. I could keep on like
this all night!"</p>

<p>To the gasping William it seemed that she already had kept on
like this all night, and he expressed himself in one great, frank,
agonized moan of relief when the music stopped. "I sh' think those
musicians 'd be dead!" he said, as he wiped his brow. And then
discovering that May Parcher stood at his elbow, he spoke hastily
to her. "M'av the next 'thyou?"</p>

<p>But Miss Parcher had begun to applaud the musicians for an encore.
She shook her head. "Next's the third extra," she said. "And,
anyhow, this one's going to be encored now. You can have the twenty-second&mdash;if
there IS any!" William threw a wild glance about him, looking
for other girls, but the tireless orchestra began to play the
encore, and Miss Boke, who had been applauding, instantly cast
herself upon his bosom. "Come on!"  she cried. "Don't let's miss
a second of it; It's just glorious!"</p>

<p>When the encore was finished she seized William's arm, and, mentioning
that she'd left her fan upon the chair under the maple-tree, added,
"Come on! Let's go get it <em>QUICK</em>!"</p>

<p>Under the maple-tree she fanned herself and talked of her love
for dancing until the music sounded again. "Come on!" she cried,
then. "Don't let's miss a second of it! It's just glorious!"</p>

<p>And grasping his arm, she propelled him toward the platform with
a merry little rush.</p>

<p>So passed five dances. Long, long dances.</p>

<p>Likewise five encores. Long encores.</p>
