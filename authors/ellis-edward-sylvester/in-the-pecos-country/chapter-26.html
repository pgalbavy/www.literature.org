<p>Lonely as Fred Munson felt in that dismal cavern, he preferred
the solitude to the companionship of an Apache Indian, and, fearful
of discovery, he crouched down to wait until he should move away.
His involuntary visitor dropped within a few feet of where he
was hiding, and Fred tried to hold his breath for fear he might
be detected; but the fellow quietly rose and gave expression to
his sentiments.</p>

<p>"Begorrah, if I haven't fell through into the cellar, as me grandmither
did when she danced down the whole party, and landed on the bottom,
and kept up the jig without a break, keep ing time with the one-eyed
fiddler above."</p>

<p>Fred could scarcely believe the evidence of his own senses. That
was the voice of his old friend, Mickey O'Rooney, or else he was
more mistaken than he had ever been in his life. But whatever
doubts might have lingered with him were removed by the words
that immediately followed.</p>

<p>"It beats the blazes where that young spalpeen can be kaping
himself. Me and Misther Simpson have been on the hunt for two
days and more, and now when I got on his trail, and found where
he'd crawled into the bushes, and I tried to do the same, I crawled
into the biggest cellar in the whole world, and I can't find the
stairs to walk out again&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Helloa, Mickey! Is that you, my old friend?" called out the
overjoyed lad, springing forward, throwing his arms about him,
and breaking in most effectually upon his meditations.</p>

<p>The Irishman was mystified for a moment, but he recognized the
voice, reached down, and placed his arms in turn about the lad.</p>

<p>"Begorrah, if this ain't the greatest surprise of me life, as
Mr. O'Spangarkoghomagh remarked when I called and paid him a little
balance that I owed him. I've had a hard hunt for you, and had
about guv you up when I came down on you in this shtyle. Freddy,
me boy, I crave the privilege of axing ye a question."</p>

<p>"Ask me a thousand, if you want," replied the boy, dancing about
with delight.</p>

<p>"Are ye sure that it's yoursilf and nobody else? I don't want
to make a mistake that'll cause me mortification, and ye must
answer carefully.''</p>

<p>"I'm sure it is I, Fred Munson."</p>

<p>"Whoop! hurrah!" shouted Mickey, leaping several feet in the
air, and, as he came down, striking at once into the Tipperary
jig.</p>

<p>The overjoyed fellow kept it up for several minutes, making the
cold, moist sand fly in every direction. He terminated the performance
by a higher leap than ever, and a regular Comanche war-whoop.
Having vented his overflowing spirits in this fashion, the Irishman
was ready to come down to something like more sober common sense.
Reaching out, he took the hand of Fred, saying as he did so:</p>

<p>"Let me kaap hold of your flipper, so that I can prevint your
drifting away. Now tell me, my laddy, how did you get here?"</p>

<p>"I come down the same way that you did."</p>

<p>"Through the skylight up there? It's a handy way of going down-stairs,
the only trouble being that it's sometimes inconvanient to stop
so suddint like. Did n't you obsarve the opening till you stepped
into it?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see it then. I was near it, asleep, and when I woke
up in the night I crawled in under the bushes to shelter myself,
when I went through into the cave. How was it you followed?"</p>

<p>"I was sarching for ye, as I've been doing for the last two days
and more. I obsarved the hole, for I had the daylight to help
me, and I crawled up to take a paap down to see who lived there,
when I must have gone too fur, as me uncle obsarved after he had
been hung in a joke, and the ground crumbled beneath me, and I
slid in. But let me ax you again, are ye much acquainted in these
parts? You know I'm a stranger."</p>

<p>"I never was here before. I've looked around all I can, but haven't
been able to find how big the cave is. There's a small waterfall,
and the stream comes in and goes out somewhere, and there is <em>one</em>
rent, at least, so deep that I don't believe it has any bottom.
I've learned that much, and that's all."</p>

<p>"That's considerable for a laddy like you. Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>"You'd better believe I am."</p>

<p>"Why had I better belave it?" asked Mickey, with an assumption
of gravity that it was impossible for him to feel. "If ye give
me your word of honor, I'll belave you, because I've been hungry
myself, and know how it goes. I have some lunch wid me, and if
ye don't faal above ating with common folks, we'll sup together."</p>

<p>"I am so glad," responded Fred, who was indeed in need of something
substantial. "I feel weak and hollow."</p>

<p>"Ye shall have your fill; take the word of an Irishman for that.
Would you like to smoke?"</p>

<p>"You know I never smoke, Mickey."</p>

<p>"I did n't ax ye that question, but if ye doesn't feel inclined
to do the same, I'll indulge myself a little."</p>

<p>The speaker had been preparing his pipe and tobacco while they
were talking, and, as he uttered the last words, he twitched the
match against the bowl, and immediately began drawing at it.</p>

<p>As the volumes of smoke issuing from his mouth showed that the
flame had done its duty, he held the match aloft, and looked down
in the smiling, upturned face of the lad, scrutinizing the handsome
countenance, as long as the tiny bit of pine held out.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's your own lovely self, as Barney McDougan's wife obsarved,
when he came home drunk, with one eye punched out and his head
cracked. Do ye know that while I was surveying your swate face
I saw something behind ye?"</p>

<p>"No. What was it?" demanded Fred, with a start and shudder, looking
back in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Oh! it was nothing that will harm ye: I think there be some
bits of wood there that kin be availed of in the way of kindling
a fire, and that's what I misses more than anything else, as me
mither used to say when she couldn't find the whisky-bottle. Bestir
yourself, me laddy, and assist me in getting together some scraps."</p>

<p>The Irishman was not mistaken in his supposition. Groping around,
they found quite a quantity of sticks and bits of wood. All of
these were dry, and the best kind of kindling stuff that could
be obtained. Mickey was never without his knife, and he whittled
several of these until sure they would take the flame from a match
when he made the essay.</p>

<p>The fire caught readily, and, carefully nursed, it spread until
it roared and crackled like an old-fashioned camp-fire. As it
rose higher and higher, and the heavy gloom was penetrated and
lit up by the vivifying rays, Mickey and Fred used their eyes
to the best of their ability.</p>

<p>The cave seemed to stretch away into fathomless darkness in every
direction, excepting one, which was toward the waterfall or cascade.
This appeared to be at one side, instead of running through the
centre. The dark walls could be seen on the other side of the
stream, and the gleam and glitter of the water, for some distance
both above and below the plunge.</p>

<p>"Do you obsarve anything new?" asked Mickey.</p>

<p>"Nothing more than what I told you," replied Fred, supposing
he referred to the extent of the cavern.</p>

<p>"I have larned something," said the man, significantly.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Somebody's been here ahead of us."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"I've got the proof. Will you note that, right there before your
eyes?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he pointed to the kindling-wood, or fuel, of which
they had collected considerable, while there was plenty more visible
around them. Fred was not sure that he understood him, so he still
looked questioningly toward him.</p>

<p>"Wood doesn't grow in such places as this, no more than ye can
find praties sprouting out of the side of a tea kettle; but then
it might have been pitched down the hole above, or got drifted
into it without anybody helping, if it wasn't for the fact that
there's been a camp-fire here before."</p>

<p>"How do you make that out, Mickey?"</p>

<p>The Irishman stooped down and picked up one of the pieces of
wood, which was waiting to be thrown upon the camp fire. Holding
it out, he showed that the end was charred.</p>

<p>"That isn't the only stick that's built after the same shtyle,
showing that this isn't the first camp-fire that was got up in
these parts. There's been gintlemen here before to-day, and they
must have had some way of coming and going that we haven't diskivered
as yet."</p>

<p>There seemed nothing unlikely in this supposition of Mickey's,
who picked up his rifle from where he had left it lying on the
ground, and stared inquiringly around in the gloom.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether there be any wild animals prowling around?"</p>

<p>"I don't think that could be; for there couldn't many of them
fall through that hole that let us in, and if they did, they would
soon die."</p>

<p>"That minds me that you hinted something about feeling the cravings
of hunger, and I signified to you that I had something for ye
about my clothes; and so I have, if it isn't lost."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he drew from beneath his waistcoat a package, carefully
wrapped about with an ordinary newspaper. Gently drawing the covering
aside, he displayed a half-dozen pieces of deer-meat, cooked to
a turn.</p>

<p>"Will ye take some?" he asked, handing one to Fred, who could
scarcely conceal his craving eagerness, as he began masticating
it.</p>

<p>"How comes it that you have that by you?"</p>

<p>"I ginerally goes prepared for the most desprit emargencies,
as me mither used to remark when she stowed the whisky-bottle
away wid the lunch she was takin' with her. It was about the middle
of yisterday afternoon that I fetched down a deer that was browsing
on the bank of a small stream that I raiched, and, as a matter
of coorse, I made my dinner on him. I tried to lay in enough stock
to last me for a week&mdash;that is, under my waistband&mdash;but I hadn't
the room; so I sliced up several pieces, rather overcooked 'em,
so as to make 'em handy to carry, and then wrapped 'em up in the
paper."</p>

<p>"It's a common-sense arrangement," added Mickey. "I had the time
and the chance to do it, and it was likely to happen that, when
I wanted the next meal, I wouldn't have the same opportunity,
remembering which I did as I said, and the result is, I've brought
<em>your</em> dinner to you."</p>
