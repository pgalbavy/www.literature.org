<p>Without using the broken language of the Mohawk scout, his mission
may be explained. While the conference between the Iroquois was
under way, he detected sounds that told him a canoe had arrived
among them&mdash;confirmed immediately after by the sound of the quarrel
already referred to. The instant he became aware of this, he resolved
to obtain possession of the boat and appropriate it to his own
use. Every reason urged him to do this. One of the most powerfully
exciting causes was the wish&mdash;natural to the white as well as
the red man&mdash;to outwit his enemies. To capture their canoe would
be a brilliant winding up of the shrewd escape he had made from
the parties on the water and land. Besides this, it had become
plain that the only way to get across the Susquehanna was by using
a craft equal in every respect to those employed by his enemies.</p>

<p>To venture out again in the scow would be to surrender to the
Iroquois, and, as sharp as was the Mohawk, he could not but wonder
that they were enabled, as it was, to get back after putting out
from shore, with all the chances so against them. He supposed
the redmen would leave the boat lying where it was, while they
scattered up and down the shore to keep watch for the fugitives,
should they attempt to repeat the embarkation. As the scow was
moored near to where the canoe was drawn up, it was to be expected
that the Iroquois would hold that place and its vicinity under
close watch. This rendered the task of the Mohawk one of the most
difficult in the world, and all the more relished on that account.
Suffice it to say that he succeeded in reaching the spot, where
he found one of the best canoes of his experience resting lightly
against the bank. A further examination of the craft told the
Mohawk that the boat was his own, having been stolen from a place
up stream where he had left it, not suspecting it was in danger.</p>

<p>Lena-Wingo was rather pleased than otherwise to learn this, for
it was proof that, if he could secure possession of the little
vessel&mdash;abundantly able to contain all the party&mdash;he would have
the one of all others which he could manage with his own consummate
skill. The paddle was there, only awaiting a claimant. But in
making his reconnoissance, Lena-Wingo ascertained that an Iroquois
sentinel was stationed within a dozen feet, where he was using
his eyes and ears as only a redskin knows how to use those organs.
It was necessary to get the canoe from beneath his nose before
there was any prospect of escape, and the question was as to how
this should be done.</p>

<p>The Mohawk, with his usual perception, saw that the boat could
not be entered at the point where it now lay, and he so informed
his friends. His plan was to move it some twenty feet or more
down stream, where it would be beyond the range of the sentinel's
vision. That accomplished, he looked upon the rest as a small
matter. He instructed them, therefore, to steal as quietly as
they could for about the distance named down stream, and there
await him. This being understood, they began the cautious movement,
while he went back to the still more difficult task.</p>

<p>It was an easy matter for the three whites to do as they were
bid without betraying themselves, and it was done in perfect silence,
after which they resumed their waiting, watching, and listening.
When Lena-Wingo reached the river-side again, he found the Iroquois
at his station, where he would be likely to detect the first design
upon the canoe. Then how was the latter to be used by the red
scout? There was a method that would have suggested itself to
any one. That was the very obvious plan of stealing up to the
unconscious sentinel, and putting him out of the way so effectually
that he could never disturb them more.</p>

<p>The reason why the warrior hesitated to employ the method which
his enemies would have been only too glad to use against him was
in obedience to that strange forbearance in his composition, and
which rendered him reluctant to shed blood, unless in legitimate
warfare. There was not a particle of doubt that he could have
stolen up to the guard and dispatched him before he could make
a single outcry or apprise his companions of what was going on.
This would leave the coast clear for him to take the whites aboard
and use his own leisure to reach the other shore. But the scheme
he had in his mind would leave the sentinel unharmed, while its
after effect would be almost equal to death itself. This plan
was to steal the canoe away without attracting the notice of the
Iroquois&mdash;a proceeding which would be such a disgrace to the warrior
that he was likely to fare ill at the hands of his comrades, who
were exasperated over the failures already made.</p>

<p>His course of action being decided upon, the Mohawk went at it
with his accustomed caution and promptness. His rifle had been
left in the hands of Ned Clinton so that his arms were untrammeled,
and he entered the water a short distance below where the boat
was lying against the bank. Fortunately, the stream was deeper
than he anticipated, rising to his waist when he was within a
yard of the land. This gave him the facility he desired, as by
stooping he was able to hide all but his head, which was so placed
that the canoe, resting high upon the surface, was brought between
him and the sentinel. This concealed him from the sight of the
warrior, and gave him the shelter so indispensable. It then required
but a minute to make his way through the water to the stern of
the canoe, which he cautiously grasped.</p>

<p>All depended upon the skill with which he managed this part of
the scheme. If the Iroquois should suspect any such attempt, the
suspicion was sure to defeat it. After placing his hand upon the
rear gunwale, he paused for fully a minute and listened. The stillness
remained undisturbed, and it looked as if the way were clear for
the daring attempt. At the very instant that Lena-Wingo began
to exert a gently increasing pressure, his keen sense of hearing
told him the sentinel was moving, and the scout paused before
the frail boat had yielded to the force.</p>

<p>The Iroquois was approaching the canoe, as if he suspected mischief.</p>

<p>The boat itself was no quieter than the Mohawk, as he listened
to the advance of his enemy. He could tell what the latter was
doing as well as if he were looking directly at him. He knew he
was picking his way to where the boat was lying, and a minute
after, had paused within arm's length of the same. There he stood
while the Mohawk awaited his next move.</p>

<p>If the sentinel should step into the craft, it would show that
he intended to look over the stern, in which case the Mohawk held
himself ready to sink below the surface, coming up so far out
in the stream that he would be invisible. But if the Iroquois
really suspected any such act upon the part of the great enemy
of his tribe, his fears were removed by the utter silence. After
waiting a little longer, he returned to his former position with
the same caution and silence as before. Lena-Wingo hardly paused
until he was out of the way, when he drew a little harder upon
the stern, and felt it slowly yielding to the force. A few more
minutes of undisturbed action, and he was sure of having the canoe
just where he wanted it!</p>
