<p>Always eat slowly and do not swallow your food until it is chewed
to a pulp. The glands inside the mouth give out enough saliva
to moisten the food and fit it for digestion in the stomach. Children
love to soak their bread in coffee, or to sip the coffee while
eating. By doing so they stop the flow of saliva and weaken a
fluid which digests the food in the stomach.</p>

<em>WHAT BOYS AND GIRLS SHOULD EAT</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>In the way of food, bread and butter, well cooked meat, and fruits
not too green nor over ripe, should form your principal diet.
Pies and cakes are injurious, and if you eat them, do so sparingly.
Never ask for a second piece.</p>

<p>[Illustration:</p>

<p>  <em>THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES</em>.]</p>

<p>Fat meat and butter cause heat and often make the blood gross.
Such diet is improper during warm weather and, therefore, we do
not crave it. If we lived in the arctic regions, we would soon
learn to drink oil like water, and to eat tallow candles as though
they were pieces of crisp celery.</p>

<p>Highly seasoned food should not be eaten. It may be salted to
suit the taste, but pepper is harmful.</p>

<em>WHEN AND HOW MUCH TO EAT</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Eat nothing between meals, which should always be at regular
hours. Partake sparingly of sugar, candy, and sweetmeats. In eating
the meat of walnuts, filberts, chestnuts, etc., use salt.</p>

<p>Children, like some grown persons, are apt to eat more food than
is good for them. You have heard people say that you ought to
leave the table while still hungry, but if that is true, there
can be no need of sitting down to eat. The true course is to cease
eating, while you still have a relish for food.</p>

<em>CHEERFULNESS AND APPETITE IN EATING</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>The table is not the place for argument or dispute. The conversation
should be cheerful, and all should try to be happy. Do not begin
any kind of work, physical or mental, until fully a half hour
after the meal is finished.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Eat very little if the mind is excited, and do not eat at all,
if you do not feel hungry. Never coax the appetite. Do not eat
heartily within a few hours of bed-time.</p>

<p>If your appetite is poor, it is well to omit the last meal of
the day. One of the best medicines in the world is a scant diet
of wholesome food. Overeating and fasting are hurtful.</p>

<p>Remember that that which agrees with one may disagree with another.
Rice is one of the most easily digested articles of food, and
yet some persons cannot retain it on their stomachs. Your own
sense will soon tell you what best agrees with you. Follow the
advice of your parents, who know what is good for their children.</p>

<p>  In what manner should we eat? Why? What bad habit are children  
likely to form?</p>

<p>  What should constitute our principal diet? What is said of
pies and   cake?</p>

<p>  What is said of fat meat, butter, and greasy food? How would
our   tastes change, if we lived in the arctic regions?</p>

<p>  What is said of highly seasoned food? What is said of salt
and   pepper?</p>

<p>  Of eating between meals? Of sugar, candy, and sweetmeats? How
should   nuts be eaten?</p>

<p>  What are children apt to do? What is the true course?</p>

<p>  What of argument and dispute at the table? What advice is given?</p>

<p>  What should be done if the mind is excited, or you do not feel  
hungry? Should the appetite be coaxed?</p>

<p>  Suppose your appetite is poor? What of overloading and fasting?</p>

<p>  Is the same kind of food good for everybody? How can you learn
what   is best to eat? What advice should be followed? </p>
