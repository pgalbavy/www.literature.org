<p>Jacob Jones&mdash;The <em>Wasp</em> and the <em>Frolic</em>&mdash;James
Biddle &mdash;The <em>Hornet</em> and the <em>Penguin</em> &mdash;A
Narrow Escape.</p>

<p>I must now tell you something about another gallant young officer
who entered the American navy at the close of the century, when
he was hardly thirty years old. He was Jacob Jones, who lived
until 1850. He was a lieutenant on the <em>Philadelphia</em> for
two years, and was with that frigate when she ran on the rocks
in the harbor of Tripoli. He was given command of the 18-gun sloop
of war <em>Wasp</em>, which sailed from the Delaware in October,
1812, and headed eastward, with the intention of intercepting
some of the enemy's merchantmen plying between Great Britain and
the West Indies.</p>

<p>About a week after sailing he sighted five merchantmen, several
of which were well armed, while all were convoyed by a brig of
war. Jones stood toward them, when the brig signalled to her companions
to make all sail before the wind, while she dropped back to attend
to the stranger. The American came up quite close, and hailing,
demanded the name of the other. For a reply, the brig lowered
the Spanish colors, ran up the British flag, and let fly with
a broadside and volley of musketry.</p>

<p>The <em>Wasp</em> was expecting something of that nature and
returned the compliment, the vessels working nearer each other
and firing as rapidly as possible. The action had hardly begun
when the <em>Wasp</em> lost her main topmast, and a few minutes
later the mizzen topgallant mast and the gaff were shot away.
These mishaps so crippled her that she became almost unmanageable.
The <em>Frolic</em>, as the enemy was named, was also damaged,
but not so badly as the <em>Wasp</em>, but, unfortunately for
the <em>Frolic</em>, the heavy sea and the twisting about of the
hull threw her into position to be raked by the <em>Wasp</em>,
and Captain Jones was quick to seize the advantage, the vessels
being so close that the ramrods were pushed against each other's
sides while the gunners were loading. The sea was so heavy that
the guns of the <em>Wasp</em> frequently dipped under water.</p>

<p>The intention of the Americans was to board, and Lieutenant James
Biddle held himself and men ready to take instant advantage of
the moment the roll of the sea brought them near enough to do
so.</p>

<p>Captain Jones did not believe himself warranted in boarding,
since he held the advantage of position, and he issued orders
for the men to wait, but their ardor could not be checked. Among
his sailors was one who had been impressed into the British service,
where he was brutally treated. Springing upon his gun, he grasped
the bowsprit of the brig, swung himself upon the spar and ran
as nimbly as a monkey to the deck of the enemy. Imitating his
enthusiasm, Lieutenant Biddle and his boarders took advantage
of a favorable lurch at that moment and sprang upon the deck of
the <em>Frolic</em>. There, every man stopped and repressed the
cheer that rose to his lips, for the scene was one of the most
dreadful that imagination can picture.</p>

<p>The quartermaster stood grimly clutching the wheel, a lieutenant,
bleeding from several wounds, was leaning against the companionway,
unable to stand without its support, while all along the deck
were strewn the dead and dying. Silently the victors stepped over
the prostrate forms to the quarter deck, where the officer weakly
dropped his sword to signify his surrender. Lieutenant Biddle
walked to where the colors were still fluttering and pulled them
down. A few minutes later the mainmast and foremast fell.</p>

<p>Maclay gives the strength of the two vessels as follows: <em>Wasp</em>,
18 guns, <em>Frolic</em>, 22; crew of the <em>Wasp</em>, 138,
of the <em>Frolic</em>, 110. On the <em>Wasp</em> 5 were killed
and 5 wounded; on the <em>Frolic</em> 15 were killed and 47 wounded,
the latter being completely riddled. The cause of this frightful
difference in results was brought about by the Americans discharging
their broadsides when their ship was on the downward roll, the
shot landing in the hull of the enemy, while the latter fired
on the rise, her broadsides mainly passing into and through the
rigging.</p>

<p>As soon as Captain Jones learned of the fearful plight of the
Frolic he sent his surgeon on board, and everything possible was
done to assist the sorely smitten enemy.</p>

<p>The <em>Wasp</em> was so badly injured that Captain Jones gave
his attention to repairing her, and was thus engaged when a sail
appeared. It proved to be the British 74-gun ship of the line
<em>Poictiers</em>, which, surmising what had taken place, bore
down, took possession of both ships and carried them to Bermuda.</p>

<p>This battle, one of the most fiercely contested of the war, naturally
caused much rejoicing throughout the United States. Congress voted
$25,000 to the officers and crew of the <em>Wasp</em> as prize
money, and gave a gold medal to Master-Commandant Jones and a
silver one to each of his officers, while the Legislature of Pennsylvania
presented a sword to Lieutenant James Biddle.</p>

<p>This gallant young officer is entitled to more notice than has
been given him. He was born in Philadelphia in 1783, and died
in 1848. After his exchange, he was appointed to the command of
the <em>Hornet</em>, and sailed from New York in the month of
January, 1815, in company with the <em>Peacock</em> and <em>Tom
Bowline</em>, but the three became separated, each making for
Tristan d'Acunha, which had been named as the rendezvous of the
squadron under the command of Stephen Decatur.</p>

<p>This was on the last day of February, and Captain Biddle was
about to drop anchor when a sail appeared, and the <em>Hornet</em>
went out to reconnoitre. The stranger approached as if anxious
to fight him, and, when within musket range, ran up the English
flag and fired a shot, to which the <em>Hornet</em> replied with
a broadside. The vessels continued firing as they drew near each
other. The superior aim of the American speedily crippled the
rigging of the other, and, coming together, the <em>Penguin</em>,
as the British vessel proved to be, in preparing to board, succeeded
in passing her bowsprit between the main and mizzen rigging of
the <em>Hornet</em> on the starboard quarter. This gave the enemy
the opportunity he seemed to be seeking, but his boarders did
not appear.</p>

<p>The American sailors begged permission of Captain Biddle to board,
but he would not consent, since he wished to hold the advantage
already gained. Just then the heaving sea broke the vessels apart,
the <em>Penguin</em> receiving considerable damage from the forcible
rupture. The <em>Hornet</em> wore round to bring her broadside
to bear, and was on the point of opening fire, when the surviving
officer of the <em>Penguin</em> called out that they surrendered.
His condition was so hopeless that no choice was left to him.</p>

<p>Captain Biddle ordered his men to stop firing, and, stepping
to the taffrail, asked his enemy if they had struck. The answer
was two musket shots, one aimed at the man at the wheel and the
other at Biddle. The latter was hit on the chin and badly, though
not dangerously, wounded, while the man at the wheel was not struck.
The men who fired the treacherous shots were seen by two American
marines, who shot them dead.</p>

<p>No doubt the action of the Englishmen was unauthorized, and probably
was due to a misunderstanding; but the Americans were so incensed
that it was difficult to restrain them from continuing the firing.
The enemy hailed a second time and called out they had surrendered.</p>

<p>The strength of the <em>Hornet</em> was 20 guns and 132 men;
of the <em>Penguin</em>, 19 guns and 128 men. The <em>Hornet</em>
had 1 man killed and 11 wounded; the <em>Penguin</em>, 10 killed
and 28 wounded. She was so badly shattered that, after taking
out her stores, her captors scuttled her.</p>

<p>In order to complete our history of the gallant Captain James
Biddle it is necessary to carry the record in advance of some
of the incidents that follow.</p>

<p>As has been stated, the <em>Peacock</em> and the <em>Hornet</em>
had gone to Tristan d'Acunha in obedience to the orders of Commodore
Decatur, to wait for him and the <em>President</em>, but the latter
never arrived, for the good reason that she had been captured
by the enemy. Growing tired of waiting, Biddle and Captain Warrington,
of the <em>Peacock</em>, started on an extended cruise, April
13, for the East Indies.</p>

<p>Doubling the Cape of Good Hope, they met with no incident of
note until the latter part of April, when they sighted a large
sail, which they believed to be a heavily laden East India merchantman.
A chase immediately began. It continued a long time, and the <em>Peacock</em>
was within a few miles, when she made the discovery that the stranger,
instead of being a merchantman, was a ship of the line. Captain
Warrington signalled the startling fact to Biddle, and the two
turned to escape. Since the formidable vessel could not pursue
both when they took different directions, she selected the <em>Hornet</em>
for her prize.</p>

<p>All that Biddle could now hope to do was to out-sail his pursuer.
He put forth every effort known to the most skilful seamanship.
When night closed in, however, the pursuer had perceptibly gained.
Since the weather was perfectly clear and the two were in plain
sight of each other, the enemy could keep up the chase all night.
Captain Biddle threw overboard some of his heavy spars, cut away
the sheet anchor and flung several tons of kentledge into the
sea.</p>

<p>This helped matters somewhat, but the stranger continued slowly
to gain, and secured such a position that Captain Biddle was obliged
to go about. Still he could not shake off the bulldog at his heels,
and at daylight he was near enough to begin barking with the bow
guns. Although the shot did not strike the <em>Hornet</em>, Captain
Biddle dropped his remaining anchors into the sea, including six
guns, launch, cables, and everything not absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>The lightening was so considerable that for the first time the
<em>Hornet</em> began drawing away from her persistent pursuer.
At the end of a few hours, however, he began creeping up again,
and Captain Biddle tumbled overboard all his guns except one,
most of his shot, his extra spars, cutlasses, muskets, forge and
bell, and indeed everything of which he could free himself. Not
only that, but the men lay down on the quarter deck to help trim
the ship.</p>

<p>All in vain. The shot and shell whistled about the <em>Hornet</em>,
the enemy came closer, and every American prepared to submit as
gracefully as possible to the inevitable. Captain Biddle addressed
his men feelingly, telling them to show the same restraint in
misfortune that they had in victory, and then the gallant officer
coolly awaited the moment when he should be obliged to haul down
his flag to save the lives of his brave crew.</p>

<p>But lo! the wind changed to a quarter favorable to the <em>Hornet</em>,
and it lasted throughout the night and the next day. The <em>Hornet</em>
drew steadily away from the British ship of the line <em>Cornwallis</em>,
as she proved to be, and made her way at a leisurely speed to
the United States.</p>
