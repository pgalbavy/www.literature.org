<p>In the following pages I have confined myself in the main to
those problems of philosophy in regard to which I thought it possible
to say something positive and constructive, since merely negative
criticism seemed out of place. For this reason, theory of knowledge
occupies a larger space than metaphysics in the present volume,
and some topics much discussed by philosophers are treated very
briefly, if at all.</p>

<p>I have derived valuable assistance from unpublished writings
of G. E. Moore and J. M. Keynes: from the former, as regards the
relations of sense-data to physical objects, and from the latter
as regards probability and induction. I have also profited greatly
by the criticisms and suggestions of Professor Gilbert Murray.</p>
