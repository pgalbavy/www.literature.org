<p> Happy he who, like Ulysses, has made an adventurous voyage;
and there is no such sea for adventurous voyages as the Mediterranean—the
inland sea which the ancients looked upon as so vast and so full
of wonders.  And, indeed, it was terrible and wonderful; for it
is we alone who, swayed by the audacity of our minds and the tremors
of our hearts, are the sole artisans of all the wonder and romance
of the world.</p>

<p>It was for the Mediterranean sailors that fair-haired sirens
sang among the black rocks seething in white foam and mysterious
voices spoke in the darkness above the moving wave—voices menacing,
seductive, or prophetic, like that voice heard at the beginning
of the Christian era by the master of an African vessel in the
Gulf of Syrta, whose calm nights are full of strange murmurs and
flitting shadows.  It called him by name, bidding him go and tell
all men that the great god Pan was dead.  But the great legend
of the Mediterranean, the legend of traditional song and grave
history, lives, fascinating and immortal, in our minds.</p>

<p>The dark and fearful sea of the subtle Ulysses’ wanderings, agitated
by the wrath of Olympian gods, harbouring on its isles the fury
of strange monsters and the wiles of strange women; the highway
of heroes and sages, of warriors, pirates, and saints; the workaday
sea of Carthaginian merchants and the pleasure lake of the Roman
Cæsars, claims the veneration of every seaman as the historical
home of that spirit of open defiance against the great waters
of the earth which is the very soul of his calling.  Issuing thence
to the west and south, as a youth leaves the shelter of his parental
house, this spirit found the way to the Indies, discovered the
coasts of a new continent, and traversed at last the immensity
of the great Pacific, rich in groups of islands remote and mysterious
like the constellations of the sky.</p>

<p>The first impulse of navigation took its visible form in that
tideless basin freed from hidden shoals and treacherous currents,
as if in tender regard for the infancy of the art.  The steep
shores of the Mediterranean favoured the beginners in one of humanity’s
most daring enterprises, and the enchanting inland sea of classic
adventure has led mankind gently from headland to headland, from
bay to bay, from island to island, out into the promise of world-wide
oceans beyond the Pillars of Hercules.</p>
