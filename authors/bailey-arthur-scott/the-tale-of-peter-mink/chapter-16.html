<p>Sometimes Peter Mink grew tired of not knowing where he was going to
sleep. And now and then, when he happened to be in some neighborhood
that he liked, he would try to find a place where he might stay until he
felt like roaming on again.
</p><p>There was one neighborhood that Peter liked very much. He often said
that of all the places in Pleasant Valley that he knew anything about,
there was no other as charming as Farmer Green's duck pond.
</p><p>The reason for his thinking that was that he was specially fond of duck
meat. And, of course, it was convenient to be able to swim under
water, and steal upon a fat duck, and seize her before she knew that
Peter was anywhere near.
</p><p>[Illustration: PETER PULLED JIMMY OUT OF THE MUD]
</p><p>Now, Peter Mink learned that there was a muskrat who had built him a
house in the bank of the duck pond. And as soon as Peter found out where
the muskrat's home was, he drove away the owner and began to live in the
house himself.
</p><p>He found it very comfortable. And he caught a duck every day, until at
last Farmer Green noticed that his ducks were disappearing.
</p><p>"I believe it's a mink that's taking them," Farmer Green said to his son
Johnnie. "If it was a coon, he'd steal more than just one a day.... Now,
you take the old gun and go down to the pond and hide. And when I let
the ducks go out for their swim, I want you to watch for a mink."
</p><p>Naturally, Peter Mink didn't hear what Farmer Green said. If he had, no
doubt he would have left the muskrat's house at once and moved on to
some other neighborhood.
</p><p>Early the next morning Johnnie Green put the old gun on his shoulder and
stole down to the edge of the duck pond, where he hid among some
cat-tails. He kept his sharp eyes on the bank of the pond, for the ducks
were just waddling down from the barnyard, to enjoy their morning swim.
</p><p>As sharp as Johnnie's eyes were, they did not see Peter Mink as he crept
out of his house and stretched himself in the sun. Peter had fallen into
the habit of sleeping late and awaking each morning just as the ducks
reached the pond.
</p><p>He saw them as they picked their way down the bank. And for once he
didn't seem to care anything about them. To tell the truth, he had
breakfasted on duck so often that he had at last grown a bit tired of
duck meat. And now he thought that for a change an eel would taste good.
For the first time since Peter had driven the muskrat from his home the
ducks were safe.
</p><p>Peter paid no attention to them. And unnoticed by Johnnie Green, he
slipped into the water and swam quickly to a place in the pond where
there was a warm spring. He knew that the warm water rose to the top of
the pond. And he knew, as well, that if an eel should happen to swim
over the spring, the rising water would bear him to the surface of the
duck pond.
</p><p>Peter Mink must have been a lucky fellow. For he had hardly reached the
spring when he saw an eel right in front of him. He seized the eel and
swam toward the bank. And there was such a commotion in the water that
Johnnie Green couldn't help noticing it.
</p><p>You see, the eel did not want to leave the duck pond. He had always
lived there, and he liked it, too. So he twisted and squirmed, trying
his hardest to break away from Peter Mink.
</p><p>But Peter swam steadily on, though to be sure he couldn't swim very
fast, dragging such a slippery fellow along with him.
</p><p>But finally he reached the shore. And then he pulled the eel out of the
water.
</p><p>Still the eel tried to get away from him. He wound himself about Peter
Mink. And several times he managed to throw Peter head over heels. But
Peter Mink always rushed upon the eel again before he could wriggle into
the pond.
</p><p>All this time Johnnie Green had entirely forgotten about his gun. He had
never seen such a sight before. And he looked on with staring eyes,
until at last Peter dragged the eel away from the pond and into some
bushes.
</p><p>Then Johnnie Green remembered why his father had sent him down to the
duck pond. And he ran forward, all ready to shoot.
</p><p>But Peter Mink had vanished. He had heard Johnnie running; and that was
enough to send him skipping away.
</p><p>Peter was disappointed, because he lost his breakfast. And Johnnie Green
was disappointed, because he lost Peter.
</p><p>In fact, of all those present, the ducks seemed to be the only ones that
were really contented. They had a fine swim. And when night came, not
one of them was missing.
