<p>Of course Timothy Turtle was glad that Johnnie Green was gone. But he
was far from happy, lying helpless on his back on the bank of Black
Creek.
</p>
<p>He told Mr. Crow that he hoped Johnnie would forget to come back
again--a remark which made old Mr. Crow laugh. Being very wise, he saw
at once that Timothy Turtle knew next to nothing about boys.
</p><p>"I should think," Mr. Crow told Timothy, "you'd want Johnnie Green to
return."
</p><p>"Why?" Timothy snapped out his question in an angry tone, as he lay
there upside down and stared at old Mr. Crow, who sat in a tree near-by.
</p><p>"Well," Mr. Crow answered, "who'll set you on your feet again if he
doesn't?"
</p><p>"Don't you worry about me!" Timothy Turtle sneered. "I'll right myself
as soon as there's a freshet. If there's a big enough rain the creek
will rise as high as I am now. And nobody could keep me on my back in
the water."
</p><p>Old Mr. Crow actually snickered.
</p><p>"You might have to wait till next spring for a freshet," he said
cheerfully. "And what would you eat meanwhile?"
</p><p>Having had a hearty meal of fish just before leaving the creek, Timothy
Turtle hadn't once thought of <u>eating</u>. And naturally Mr. Crow's
question troubled him. So he frowned frightfully. And he snapped his
hooked jaws together, for he had to take something in his jaws and bite
it, if it was no more than the air.
</p><p>"I suppose"--Mr. Crow remarked--"I suppose you would call that <u>taking
the air, eh</u>?" And there was a merry twinkle in his eye.
</p><p>"Go away!" Timothy Turtle growled.
</p><p>But his guest declined to leave.
</p><p>"There's likely to be some fun here," he thought, "and I don't intend to
miss it."
</p><hr/>
<p>If Timothy Turtle was surprised, Mr. Crow certainly was not, when a
little later Johnnie Green and another boy whom he called "Red" (on
account of his hair) came hurrying up to the spot where Timothy Turtle
lay.
</p><p>Upon the ground they dropped a number of things, such as pieces of rope,
an old grain-sack, and an axe.
</p><p>"Goodness!" said Mr. Crow to himself, as he looked on. "I'm glad I'm not
Timothy Turtle. It appears to me that he's going to have a terrible
time."
</p><p>And Timothy himself seemed to think the same. He made savage passes at
Johnnie and Red whenever they came near him. But they took good care to
keep beyond his reach.
</p><p>On the whole their captive behaved in a most foolish manner. Instead of
drawing his head as far as he could into his shell, he thrust his neck
out as far as it would go.
</p><p>And that was exactly what the boys wanted him to do. Before Timothy
Turtle--who was somewhat slow-witted--before he realized what their plan
was, Johnnie Green and his friend Red had slipped one noose around his
head and another around his body. And after turning their captive right
side up they staked him out upon the sand so that he could not move.
</p><p>"There!" Johnnie Green cried when they had Timothy Turtle where they
wanted him. "That's the way the Redskins do with their enemies."
</p><p>And his friend the red-haired boy danced something that might have been
an Indian war dance.
</p><p>Anyhow, neither old Mr. Crow nor Timothy Turtle had ever seen anything
like it.
