<p>There were many rooms in the villa, but one room which possessed
a character of its own because the door was always shut, and no
sound of music or laughter issued from it. Every one in the house
was vaguely conscious that something went on behind that door,
and without in the least knowing what it was, were influenced
in their own thoughts by the knowledge that if the passed it the
door would be shut, and if they made a noise Mr. Ambrose inside
would be disturbed. Certain acts therefore possessed merit, and
others were bad, so that life became more harmonious and less
disconnected than it would have been had Mr. Ambrose given up
editing <em>Pindar</em>, and taken to a nomad existence, in and
out of every room in the house. As it was, every one was conscious
that by observing certain rules, such as punctuality and quiet,
by cooking well, and performing other small duties, one ode after
another was satisfactorily restored to the world, and they shared
the continuity of the scholar's life. Unfortunately, as age puts
one barrier between human beings, and learning another, and sex
a third, Mr. Ambrose in his study was some thousand miles distant
from the nearest human being, who in this household was inevitably
a woman. He sat hour after hour among white-leaved books, alone
like an idol in an empty church, still except for the passage
of his hand from one side of the sheet to another, silent save
for an occasional choke, which drove him to extend his pipe a
moment in the air. As he worked his way further and further into
the heart of the poet, his chair became more and more deeply encircled
by books, which lay open on the floor, and could only be crossed
by a careful process of stepping, so delicate that his visitors
generally stopped and addressed him from the outskirts.</p>

<p>On the morning after the dance, however, Rachel came into her
uncle's room and hailed him twice, "Uncle Ridley," before he paid
her any attention.</p>

<p>At length he looked over his spectacles.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I want a book," she replied. "Gibbon's <em>History</em> <em>of</em>
<em>the</em> <em>Roman</em> <em>Empire</em>. May I have it?"</p>

<p>She watched the lines on her uncle's face gradually rearrange
themselves at her question. It had been smooth as a mask before
she spoke.</p>

<p>"Please say that again," said her uncle, either because he had
not heard or because he had not understood.</p>

<p>She repeated the same words and reddened slightly as she did
so.</p>

<p>"Gibbon! What on earth d'you want him for?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"Somebody advised me to read it," Rachel stammered.</p>

<p>"But I don't travel about with a miscellaneous collection of
eighteenth-century historians!" her uncle exclaimed. "Gibbon!
Ten big volumes at least."</p>

<p>Rachel said that she was sorry to interrupt, and was turning
to go.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried her uncle. He put down his pipe, placed his book
on one side, and rose and led her slowly round the room, holding
her by the arm. "Plato," he said, laying one finger on the first
of a row of small dark books, "and Jorrocks next door, which is
wrong. Sophocles, Swift. You don't care for German commentators,
I presume. French, then. You read French? You should read Balzac.
Then we come to Wordsworth and Coleridge, Pope, Johnson, Addison,
Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats. One thing leads to another. Why is
Marlowe here? Mrs. Chailey, I presume. But what's the use of reading
if you don't read Greek? After all, if you read Greek, you need
never read anything else, pure waste of time&mdash;pure waste of time,"
thus speaking half to himself, with quick movements of his hands;
they had come round again to the circle of books on the floor,
and their progress was stopped.</p>

<p>"Well," he demanded, "which shall it be?"</p>

<p>"Balzac," said Rachel, "or have you the <em>Speech</em> <em>on</em>
<em>the</em> <em>American</em> <em>Revolution</em>, Uncle Ridley?"</p>

<p>"<em>The</em> <em>Speech</em> <em>on</em> <em>the</em> <em>American</em>
<em>Revolution</em>?" he asked. He looked at her very keenly again.
"Another young man at the dance?"</p>

<p>"No. That was Mr. Dalloway," she confessed.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he flung back his head in recollection of Mr. Dalloway.</p>

<p>She chose for herself a volume at random, submitted it to her
uncle, who, seeing that it was <em>La</em> <em>Cousine</em> <em>bette</em>,
bade her throw it away if she found it too horrible, and was about
to leave him when he demanded whether she had enjoyed her dance?</p>

<p>He then wanted to know what people did at dances, seeing that
he had only been to one thirty-five years ago, when nothing had
seemed to him more meaningless and idiotic. Did they enjoy turning
round and round to the screech of a fiddle? Did they talk, and
say pretty things, and if so, why didn't they do it, under reasonable
conditions? As for himself&mdash;he sighed and pointed at the signs
of industry lying all about him, which, in spite of his sigh,
filled his face with such satisfaction that his niece thought
good to leave. On bestowing a kiss she was allowed to go, but
not until she had bound herself to learn at any rate the Greek
alphabet, and to return her French novel when done with, upon
which something more suitable would be found for her.</p>

<p>As the rooms in which people live are apt to give off something
of the same shock as their faces when seen for the first time,
Rachel walked very slowly downstairs, lost in wonder at her uncle,
and his books, and his neglect of dances, and his queer, utterly
inexplicable, but apparently satisfactory view of life, when her
eye was caught by a note with her name on it lying in the hall.
The address was written in a small strong hand unknown to her,
and the note, which had no beginning, ran:&mdash;</p>

<p>I send the first volume of Gibbon as I promised. Personally I
find little to be said for the moderns, but I'm going to send
you Wedekind when I've done him. Donne? Have you read Webster
and all that set? I envy you reading them for the first time.
Completely exhausted after last night. And you?</p>

<p>The flourish of initials which she took to be St. J. A. H., wound
up the letter. She was very much flattered that Mr. Hirst should
have remembered her, and fulfilled his promise so quickly.</p>

<p>There was still an hour to luncheon, and with Gibbon in one hand,
and Balzac in the other she strolled out of the gate and down
the little path of beaten mud between the olive trees on the slope
of the hill. It was too hot for climbing hills, but along the
valley there were trees and a grass path running by the river
bed. In this land where the population was centred in the towns
it was possible to lose sight of civilisation in a very short
time, passing only an occasional farmhouse, where the women were
handling red roots in the courtyard; or a little boy lying on
his elbows on the hillside surrounded by a flock of black strong-smelling
goats. Save for a thread of water at the bottom, the river was
merely a deep channel of dry yellow stones. On the bank grew those
trees which Helen had said it was worth the voyage out merely
to see. April had burst their buds, and they bore large blossoms
among their glossy green leaves with petals of a thick wax-like
substance coloured an exquisite cream or pink or deep crimson.
But filled with one of those unreasonable exultations which start
generally from an unknown cause, and sweep whole countries and
skies into their embrace, she walked without seeing. The night
was encroaching upon the day. Her ears hummed with the tunes she
had played the night before; she sang, and the singing made her
walk faster and faster. She did not see distinctly where she was
going, the trees and the landscape appearing only as masses of
green and blue, with an occasional space of differently coloured
sky. Faces of people she had seen last night came before her;
she heard their voices; she stopped singing, and began saying
things over again or saying things differently, or inventing things
that might have been said. The constraint of being among strangers
in a long silk dress made it unusually exciting to stride thus
alone. Hewet, Hirst, Mr. Venning, Miss Allan, the music, the light,
the dark trees in the garden, the dawn,&mdash;as she walked they went
surging round in her head, a tumultuous background from which
the present moment, with its opportunity of doing exactly as she
liked, sprung more wonderfully vivid even than the night before.</p>

<p>So she might have walked until she had lost all knowledge of
her way, had it not been for the interruption of a tree, which,
although it did not grow across her path, stopped her as effectively
as if the branches had struck her in the face. It was an ordinary
tree, but to her it appeared so strange that it might have been
the only tree in the world. Dark was the trunk in the middle,
and the branches sprang here and there, leaving jagged intervals
of light between them as distinctly as if it had but that second
risen from the ground. Having seen a sight that would last her
for a lifetime, and for a lifetime would preserve that second,
the tree once more sank into the ordinary ranks of trees, and
she was able to seat herself in its shade and to pick the red
flowers with the thin green leaves which were growing beneath
it. She laid them side by side, flower to flower and stalk to
stalk, caressing them for walking alone. Flowers and even pebbles
in the earth had their own life and disposition, and brought back
the feelings of a child to whom they were companions. Looking
up, her eye was caught by the line of the mountains flying out
energetically across the sky like the lash of a curling whip.
She looked at the pale distant sky, and the high bare places on
the mountain-tops lying exposed to the sun. When she sat down
she had dropped her books on to the earth at her feet, and now
she looked down on them lying there, so square in the grass, a
tall stem bending over and tickling the smooth brown cover of
Gibbon, while the mottled blue Balzac lay naked in the sun. With
a feeling that to open and read would certainly be a surprising
experience, she turned the historian's page and read that&mdash;</p>

<p>His generals, in the early part of his reign, attempted the reduction
of Aethiopia and Arabia Felix. They marched near a thousand miles
to the south of the tropic; but the heat of the climate soon repelled
the invaders and protected the unwarlike natives of those sequestered
regions. . . . The northern countries of Europe scarcely deserved
the expense and labour of conquest. The forests and morasses of
Germany were filled with a hardy race of barbarians, who despised
life when it was separated from freedom.</p>

<p>Never had any words been so vivid and so beautiful &mdash;Arabia
Felix &mdash;Aethiopia. But those were not more noble than the
others, hardy barbarians, forests, and morasses. They seemed to
drive roads back to the very beginning of the world, on either
side of which the populations of all times and countries stood
in avenues, and by passing down them all knowledge would be hers,
and the book of the world turned back to the very first page.
Such was her excitement at the possibilities of knowledge now
opening before her that she ceased to read, and a breeze turning
the page, the covers of Gibbon gently ruffled and closed together.
She then rose again and walked on. Slowly her mind became less
confused and sought the origins of her exaltation, which were
twofold and could be limited by an effort to the persons of Mr.
Hirst and Mr. Hewet. Any clear analysis of them was impossible
owing to the haze of wonder in which they were enveloped. She
could not reason about them as about people whose feelings went
by the same rule as her own did, and her mind dwelt on them with
a kind of physical pleasure such as is caused by the contemplation
of bright things hanging in the sun. From them all life seemed
to radiate; the very words of books were steeped in radiance.
She then became haunted by a suspicion which she was so reluctant
to face that she welcomed a trip and stumble over the grass because
thus her attention was dispersed, but in a second it had collected
itself again. Unconsciously she had been walking faster and faster,
her body trying to outrun her mind; but she was now on the summit
of a little hillock of earth which rose above the river and displayed
the valley. She was no longer able to juggle with several ideas,
but must deal with the most persistent, and a kind of melancholy
replaced her excitement. She sank down on to the earth clasping
her knees together, and looking blankly in front of her. For some
time she observed a great yellow butterfly, which was opening
and closing its wings very slowly on a little flat stone.</p>

<p>"What is it to be in love?" she demanded, after a long silence;
each word as it came into being seemed to shove itself out into
an unknown sea. Hypnotised by the wings of the butterfly, and
awed by the discovery of a terrible possibility in life, she sat
for some time longer. When the butterfly flew away, she rose,
and with her two books beneath her arm returned home again, much
as a soldier prepared for battle.</p>
