<p>The afternoon dragged itself out in silence. Mrs. Travers sat
pensive and idle with her fan on her knees. D'Alcacer, who thought
the incident should have been treated in a conciliatory spirit,
attempted to communicate his view to his host, but that gentleman,
purposely misunderstanding his motive, overwhelmed him with so
many apologies and expressions of regret at the irksome and perhaps
inconvenient delay "which you suffer from through your good-natured
acceptance of our invitation" that the other was obliged to refrain
from pursuing the subject further.</p>

<p>"Even my regard for you, my dear d'Alcacer, could not induce
me to submit to such a bare-faced attempt at extortion," affirmed
Mr. Travers with uncompromising virtue. "The man wanted to force
his services upon me, and then put in a heavy claim for salvage.
That is the whole secret&mdash;you may depend on it. I detected him
at once, of course." The eye-glass glittered perspicuously. "He
underrated my intelligence; and what a violent scoundrel! The
existence of such a man in the time we live in is a scandal."</p>

<p>D'Alcacer retired, and, full of vague forebodings, tried in vain
for hours to interest himself in a book. Mr. Travers walked up
and down restlessly, trying to persuade himself that his indignation
was based on purely moral grounds. The glaring day, like a mass
of white-hot iron withdrawn from the fire, was losing gradually
its heat and its glare in a richer deepening of tone. At the usual
time two seamen, walking noiselessly aft in their yachting shoes,
rolled up in silence the quarter-deck screens; and the coast,
the shallows, the dark islets and the snowy sandbanks uncovered
thus day after day were seen once more in their aspect of dumb
watchfulness. The brig, swung end on in the foreground, her squared
yards crossing heavily the soaring symmetry of the rigging, resembled
a creature instinct with life, with the power of springing into
action lurking in the light grace of its repose.</p>

<p>A pair of stewards in white jackets with brass buttons appeared
on deck and began to flit about without a sound, laying the table
for dinner on the flat top of the cabin skylight. The sun, drifting
away toward other lands, toward other seas, toward other men;
the sun, all red in a cloudless sky raked the yacht with a parting
salvo of crimson rays that shattered themselves into sparks of
fire upon the crystal and silver of the dinner-service, put a
short flame into the blades of knives, and spread a rosy tint
over the white of plates. A trail of purple, like a smear of blood
on a blue shield, lay over the sea.</p>

<p>On sitting down Mr. Travers alluded in a vexed tone to the necessity
of living on preserves, all the stock of fresh provisions for
the passage to Batavia having been already consumed. It was distinctly
unpleasant.</p>

<p>"I don't travel for my pleasure, however," he added; "and the
belief that the sacrifice of my time and comfort will be productive
of some good to the world at large would make up for any amount
of privations."</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers and d'Alcacer seemed unable to shake off a strong
aversion to talk, and the conversation, like an expiring breeze,
kept on dying out repeatedly after each languid gust. The large
silence of the horizon, the profound repose of all things visible,
enveloping the bodies and penetrating the souls with their quieting
influence, stilled thought as well as voice. For a long time no
one spoke. Behind the taciturnity of the masters the servants
hovered without noise.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Mr. Travers, as if concluding a train of thought, muttered
aloud:</p>

<p>"I own with regret I did in a measure lose my temper; but then
you will admit that the existence of such a man is a disgrace
to civilization."</p>

<p>This remark was not taken up and he returned for a time to the
nursing of his indignation, at the bottom of which, like a monster
in a fog, crept a bizarre feeling of rancour. He waved away an
offered dish.</p>

<p>"This coast," he began again, "has been placed under the sole
protection of Holland by the Treaty of 1820. The Treaty of 1820
creates special rights and obligations. . . ."</p>

<p>Both his hearers felt vividly the urgent necessity to hear no
more. D'Alcacer, uncomfortable on a campstool, sat stiff and stared
at the glass stopper of a carafe. Mrs. Travers turned a little
sideways and leaning on her elbow rested her head on the palm
of her hand like one thinking about matters of profound import.
Mr. Travers talked; he talked inflexibly, in a harsh blank voice,
as if reading a proclamation. The other two, as if in a state
of incomplete trance, had their ears assailed by fragments of
official verbiage.</p>

<p>"An international understanding&mdash;the duty to civilize&mdash;failed
to carry out&mdash;compact &mdash;Canning&mdash;" D'Alcacer became attentive
for a moment. "&mdash;not that this attempt, almost amusing in its
impudence, influences my opinion. I won't admit the possibility
of any violence being offered to people of our position. It is
the social aspect of such an incident I am desirous of criticising."</p>

<p>Here d'Alcacer lost himself again in the recollection of Mrs.
Travers and Immada looking at each other&mdash;the beginning and the
end, the flower and the leaf, the phrase and the cry. Mr. Travers'
voice went on dogmatic and obstinate for a long time. The end
came with a certain vehemence.</p>

<p>"And if the inferior race must perish, it is a gain, a step toward
the perfecting of society which is the aim of progress."</p>

<p>He ceased. The sparks of sunset in crystal and silver had gone
out, and around the yacht the expanse of coast and Shallows seemed
to await, unmoved, the coming of utter darkness. The dinner was
over a long time ago and the patient stewards had been waiting,
stoical in the downpour of words like sentries under a shower.</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers rose nervously and going aft began to gaze at the
coast. Behind her the sun, sunk already, seemed to force through
the mass of waters the glow of an unextinguishable fire, and below
her feet, on each side of the yacht, the lustrous sea, as if reflecting
the colour of her eyes, was tinged a sombre violet hue.</p>

<p>D'Alcacer came up to her with quiet footsteps and for some time
they leaned side by side over the rail in silence. Then he said&mdash;"How
quiet it is!" and she seemed to perceive that the quietness of
that evening was more profound and more significant than ever
before. Almost without knowing it she murmured&mdash;"It's like a dream."
Another long silence ensued; the tranquillity of the universe
had such an August ampleness that the sounds remained on the lips
as if checked by the fear of profanation. The sky was limpid like
a diamond, and under the last gleams of sunset the night was spreading
its veil over the earth. There was something precious and soothing
in the beautifully serene end of that expiring day, of the day
vibrating, glittering and ardent, and dying now in infinite peace,
without a stir, without a tremor, without a sigh&mdash;in the certitude
of resurrection.</p>

<p>Then all at once the shadow deepened swiftly, the stars came
out in a crowd, scattering a rain of pale sparks upon the blackness
of the water, while the coast stretched low down, a dark belt
without a gleam. Above it the top-hamper of the brig loomed indistinct
and high.</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers spoke first.</p>

<p>"How unnaturally quiet! It is like a desert of land and water
without a living soul."</p>

<p>"One man at least dwells in it," said d'Alcacer, lightly, "and
if he is to be believed there are other men, full of evil intentions."</p>

<p>"Do you think it is true?" Mrs. Travers asked.</p>

<p>Before answering d'Alcacer tried to see the expression of her
face but the obscurity was too profound already.</p>

<p>"How can one see a dark truth on such a dark night?" he said,
evasively. "But it is easy to believe in evil, here or anywhere
else."</p>

<p>She seemed to be lost in thought for a while.</p>

<p>"And that man himself?" she asked.</p>

<p>After some time d'Alcacer began to speak slowly. "Rough, uncommon,
decidedly uncommon of his kind. Not at all what Don Martin thinks
him to be. For the rest&mdash;mysterious to me. He is <em>your</em>
countryman after all&mdash;"</p>

<p>She seemed quite surprised by that view.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, slowly. "But you know, I can not&mdash;what shall
I say?&mdash;imagine him at all. He has nothing in common with the
mankind I know. There is nothing to begin upon. How does such
a man live? What are his thoughts? His actions? His affections?
His&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His conventions," suggested d'Alcacer. "That would include everything."</p>

<p>Mr. Travers appeared suddenly behind them with a glowing cigar
in his teeth. He took it between his fingers to declare with persistent
acrimony that no amount of "scoundrelly intimidation" would prevent
him from having his usual walk. There was about three hundred
yards to the southward of the yacht a sandbank nearly a mile long,
gleaming a silvery white in the darkness, plumetted in the centre
with a thicket of dry bushes that rustled very loud in the slightest
stir of the heavy night air. The day after the stranding they
had landed on it "to stretch their legs a bit," as the sailing-master
defined it, and every evening since, as if exercising a privilege
or performing a duty, the three paced there for an hour backward
and forward lost in dusky immensity, threading at the edge of
water the belt of damp sand, smooth, level, elastic to the touch
like living flesh and sweating a little under the pressure of
their feet.</p>

<p>This time d'Alcacer alone followed Mr. Travers. Mrs. Travers
heard them get into the yacht's smallest boat, and the night-watchman,
tugging at a pair of sculls, pulled them off to the nearest point.
Then the man returned. He came up the ladder and she heard him
say to someone on deck:</p>

<p>"Orders to go back in an hour."</p>

<p>His footsteps died out forward, and a somnolent, unbreathing
repose took possession of the stranded yacht.</p>
