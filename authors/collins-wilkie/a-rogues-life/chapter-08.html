<P>
I WENT back to the fishing-place with a heavy heart, overcome by
mournful thoughts, for the first time in my life. It was plain
that she did not dislike me, and equally plain that there was
some obstacle connected with her father, which forbade her to
listen to my offer of marriage. From the time when she had
accidentally looked toward the red-brick house, something in her
manner which it is quite impossible to describe, had suggested to
my mind that this obstacle was not only something she could not
mention, but something that she was partly ashamed of, partly
afraid of, and partly doubtful about. What could it be? How had
she first known it? In what way was her father connected with it?
<P>
In the course of our walks she had told me nothing about herself
which was not perfectly simple and unsuggestive.
<P>
Her childhood had been passed in England. After that, she had
lived with her father and mother at Paris, where the doctor had
many friends--for all of whom she remembered feeling more or less
dislike, without being able to tell why. They had then come to
England, and had lived in lodgings in London. For a time they had
been miserably poor. But, after her mother's death--a sudden
death from heart disease--there had come a change in their
affairs, which she was quite unable to explain. They had removed
to their present abode, to give the doctor full accommodation for
the carrying on of his scientific pursuits. He often had occasion
to go to London; but never took her with him. The only woman at
home now, beside herself, was an elderly person, who acted as
cook and housekeeper, and who had been in their service for many
years. It was very lonely sometimes not having a companion of her
own age and sex; but she had got tolerably used to bear it, and
to amuse herself with her books, and music, and flowers.
<P>
Thus far she chatted about herself quite freely; but when I
tried, even in the vaguest manner, to lead her into discussing
the causes of her strangely secluded life, she looked so
distressed, and became so suddenly silent, that I naturally
refrained from saying another word on that topic. One conclusion,
however, I felt tolera bly sure that I had drawn correctly from
what she said: her father's conduct toward her, though not
absolutely blamable or grossly neglectful on any point, had still
never been of a nature to make her ardently fond of him. He
performed the ordinary parental duties rigidly and respectably
enough; but he had apparently not cared to win all the filial
love which his daughter would have bestowed on a more
affectionate man.
<P>
When, after reflecting on what Alicia had told me, I began to
call to mind what I had been able to observe for myself, I found
ample materials to excite my curiosity in relation to the doctor,
if not my distrust.
<P>
I have already described how I heard the clang of the heavy door,
on the occasion of my first visit to the red-brick house. The
next day, when the doctor again took leave of me in the hall, I
hit on a plan for seeing the door as well as hearing it. I
dawdled on my way out, till I heard the clang again; then
pretended to remember some important message which I had
forgotten to give to the doctor, and with a look of innocent
hurry ran upstairs to overtake him. The disguised workman ran
after me with a shout of "Stop!" I was conveniently deaf to
him--reached the first floor landing--and arrived at a door which
shut off the whole staircase higher up; an iron door, as solid as
if it belonged to a banker's strong-room, and guarded millions of
money. I returned to the hall, inattentive to the servant's not
over-civil remonstrances, and, saying that I would wait till I
saw the doctor again, left the house.
<P>
The next day two pale-looking men, in artisan costume, came up to
the gate at the same time as I did, each carrying a long wooden
box under his arm, strongly bound with iron. I tried to make them
talk while we were waiting for admission, but neither of them
would go beyond "Yes," or "No"; and both had, to my eyes, some
unmistakably sinister lines in their faces. The next day the
houskeeping cook came to the door--a buxom old woman with a look
and a ready smile, and something in her manner which suggested
that she had not begun life quite so respectably as she was now
ending it. She seemed to be decidedly satisfied with my personal
appearance; talked to me on indifferent matters with great
glibness; but suddenly became silent and diplomatic the moment I
looked toward the stair and asked innocently if she had to go up
and down them often in the course of the day. As for the doctor
himself he was unapproachable on the subject of the mysterious
upper regions. If I introduced chemistry in general into the
conversation he begged me not to spoil his happy holiday hours
with his daughter and me, by leading him back to his work-a-day
thoughts. If I referred to his own experiments in particular he
always made a joke about being afraid of my chemical knowledge,
and of my wishing to anticipate him in his discoveries. In brief,
after a week's run of the lower regions, the upper part of the
red-brick house and the actual nature of its owner's occupations
still remained impenetrable mysteries to me, pry, ponder, and
question as I might.
<P>
Thinking of this on the river-bank, in connection with the
distressing scene which I had just had with Alicia, I found that
the mysterious obstacle at which she had hinted, the mysterious
life led by her father, and the mysterious top of the house that
had hitherto defied my curiosity, all three connected themselves
in my mind as links of the same chain. The obstacle to my
marrying Alicia was the thing that most troubled me. If I only
found out what it was, and if I made light of it (which I was
resolved beforehand to do, let it be what it might), I should
most probably end by overcoming her scruples, and taking her away
from the ominous red-brick house in the character of my wife. But
how was I to make the all-important discovery?
<P>
Cudgeling my brains for an answer to this question, I fell at
last into reasoning upon it, by a process of natural logic,
something after this fashion: The mysterious top of the house is
connected with the doctor, and the doctor is connected with the
obstacle which has made wretchedness between Alicia and me. If I
can only get to the top of the house, I may get also to the root
of the obstacle. It is a dangerous and an uncertain experiment;
but, come what may of it, I will try and find out, if human
ingenuity can compass the means, what Doctor Dulcifer's
occupation really is, on the other side of that iron door.
<P>
Having come to this resolution (and deriving, let me add,
parenthetically, great consolation from it), the next subject of
consideration was the best method of getting safely into the top
regions of the house.
<P>
Picking the lock of the iron door was out of the question, from
the exposed nature of the situation which that mysterious iron
barrier occupied. My only possible way to the second floor lay by
the back of the house. I had looked up at it two or three times,
while walking in the garden after dinner with Alicia. What had I
brought away in my memory as the result of that casual inspection
of my host's back premises? Several fragments of useful
information.
<P>
In the first place, one of the most magnificent vines I had ever
seen grew against the back wall of the house, trained carefully
on a strong trellis-work. In the second place, the middle
first-floor back window looked out on a little stone balcony,
built on the top of the porch over the garden door. In the third
place, the back windows of the second floor had been open, on
each occasion when I had seen them--most probably to air the
house, which could not be ventilated from the front during the
hot summer weather, in consequence of the shut-up condition of
all the windows thereabouts. In the fourth place, hard by the
coach-house in which Doctor Dulcifer's neat gig was put up, there
was a tool-shed, in which the gardener kept his short
pruning-ladder. In the fifth and last place, outside the stable
in which Doctor Dulcifer's blood mare lived in luxurious
solitude, was a dog-kennel with a large mastiff chained to it
night and day. If I could only rid myself of the dog--a gaunt,
half-starved brute, made savage and mangy by perpetual
confinement--I did not see any reason to despair of getting in
undiscovered at one of the second-floor windows--provided I
waited until a sufficiently late hour, and succeeded in scaling
the garden wall at the back of the house.
<P>
Life without Alicia being not worth having, I determined to risk
the thing that very night.
<P>
Going back at once to the town of Barkingham, I provided myself
with a short bit of rope, a little bull's-eye lantern, a small
screwdriver, and a nice bit of beef chemically adapted for the
soothing of troublesome dogs. I then dressed, disposed of these
things neatly in my coat pockets, and went to the doctor's to
dinner. In one respect, Fortune favored my audacity. It was the
sultriest day of the whole season--surely they could not think of
shutting up the second-floor back windows to-night!
<P>
Alicia was pale and silent. The lovely brown eyes, when they
looked at me, said as plainly as in words, "We have been crying a
great deal, Frank, since we saw you last." The little white
fingers gave mine a significant squeeze--and that was all the
reference that passed between us to what happened in the morning.
She sat through the dinner bravely; but, when the dessert came,
left us for the night, with a few shy, hurried words about the
excessive heat of the weather being too much for her. I rose to
open the door, and exchanged a last meaning look with her, as she
bowed and went by me. Little did I think that I should have to
live upon nothing but the remembrance of that look for many weary
days that were yet to come.
<P>
The doctor was in excellent spirits, and almost oppressively
hospitable. We sat sociably chatting over our claret till past
eight o'clock. Then my host turned to his desk to write a letter
before the post want out; and I strolled away to smoke a cigar in
the garden.
<P>
Second-floor back windows all open, atmosphere as sultry as ever,
gardener's pruning-ladder quite safe in the tool-shed, savage
mastiff in his kennel crunching his bones for supper. Good. The
dog will not be visited again tonight: I may throw my medicated
bit of beef at once into his kennel. I acted on the idea
immediately; the dog seized his piece of beef; I heard a snap, a
wheeze, a choke, and a groan--and there was the mastiff disposed
of, inside the kennel, where nobody could find out that he was
dead till the time came for feeding him the next morning.
<P>
I went back to the doctor; we had a social glass of cold
brandy-and-water together; I lighted another cigar, and took my
leave. My host being too respectable a man not to keep early
country hours, I went away, as usual, about ten. The mysterious
man-servant locked the gate behind me. I sauntered on the road
back to Barkingham for about five minutes, then struck off sharp
for the plantation, lighted my lantern with the help of my cigar
and a brimstone match of that barbarous period, shut down the
slide again, and made for the garden wall.
<P>
It was formidably high, and garnished horribly with broken
bottles; but it was also old, and when I came to pick at the
mortar with my screw-driver, I found it reasonably rotten with
age and damp.
<P>
I removed four bricks to make footholes in different positions up
the wall. It was desperately hard and long work, easy as it may
sound in description--especially when I had to hold on by the top
of the wall, with my flat opera hat (as we used to call it in
those days) laid, as a guard, between my hand and the glass,
while I cleared a way through the sharp bottle-ends for my other
hand and my knees. This done, my great difficulty was vanquished;
and I had only to drop luxuriously into a flower-bed on the other
side of the wall.
<P>
Perfect stillness in the garden: no sign of a light anywhere at
the back of the house: first-floor windows all shut: second-floor
windows still open. I fetched the pruning-ladder; put it against
the side of the porch; tied one end of my bit of rope to the top
round of it; took the other end in my mouth, and prepared to
climb to the balcony over the porch by the thick vine branches
and the trellis-work.
<P>
No man who has had any real experience of life can have failed to
observe how amazingly close, in critical situations, the
grotesque and the terrible, the comic and the serious, contrive
to tread on each other's heels. At such times, the last thing we
ought properly to think of comes into our heads, or the least
consistent event that could possibly be expected to happen does
actually occur. When I put my life in danger on that memorable
night, by putting my foot on the trellis-work, I absolutely
thought of the never-dying Lady Malkinshaw plunged in refreshing
slumber, and of the frantic exclamations Mr. Batterbury would
utter if he saw what her ladyship's grandson was doing with his
precious life and limbs at that critical moment. I am no hero--I
was fully aware of the danger to which I was exposing myself; and
yet I protest that I caught myself laughing under my breath, with
the most outrageous inconsistency, at the instant when I began
the ascent of the trellis-work.
<P>
I reached the balcony over the porch in safety, depending more
upon the tough vine branches than the trellis-work during my
ascent. My next employment was to pull up the pruning-ladder, as
softly as possible, by the rope which I held attached to it. This
done, I put the ladder against the house wall, listened, measured
the distance to the open second-floor window with my eye,
listened again--and, finding all quiet, began my second and last
ascent. The ladder was comfortably long, and I was conveniently
tall; my hand was on the window-sill--I mounted another two
rounds--and my eyes were level with the interior of the room.
<P>
Suppose any one should be sleeping there!
<P>
I listened at the window attentively before I ventured on taking
my lantern out of my coatpocket. The night was so quite and
airless that there was not the faintest rustle among the leaves
in the garden beneath me to distract my attention. I listened.
The breathing of the lightest of sleepers must have reached my
ear, through that intense stillness, if the room had been a
bedroom, and the bed were occupied. I heard nothing but the quick
beat of my own heart. The minutes of suspense were passing
heavily--I laid my other hand over the window-sill, then a moment
of doubt came--doubt whether I should carry the adventure any
further. I mastered my hesitation directly--it was too late for
second thoughts. "Now for it!" I whispered to myself, and got in
at the window.
<P>
To wait, listening again, in the darkness of that unknown region,
was more than I had courage for. The moment I was down on the
floor, I pulled the lantern out of my pocket and raised the
shade.
<P>
So far, so good--I found myself in a dirty lumber-room. Large
pans, some of them cracked and more of them broken; empty boxes
bound with iron, of the same sort as those I had seen the workmen
bringing in at the front gate; old coal sacks; a packing-case
full of coke; and a huge, cracked, mouldy blacksmith's
bellows--these were the principal objects that I observed in the
lumber-room. The one door leading out of it was open, as I had
expected it would be, in order to let the air through the back
window into the house. I took off my shoes, and stole into the
passage. My first impulse, the moment I looked along it, was to
shut down my lantern-shade, and listen again.
<P>
Still I heard nothing; but at the far end of the passage I saw a
bright light pouring through the half-opened door of one of the
mysterious front rooms.
<P>
I crept softly toward it. A decidedly chemical smell began to
steal into my nostrils--and, listening again, I thought I heard
above me, and in some distant room, a noise like the low growl of
a large furnace, muffled in some peculiar manner. Should I
retrace my steps in that direction? No--not till I had seen
something of the room with the bright light, outside of which I
was now standing. I bent forward softly; looking by little and
little further and further through the opening of the door, until
my head and shoulders were fairly inside the room, and my eyes
had convinced me that no living soul, sleeping or waking, was in
any part of it at that particular moment. Impelled by a fatal
curiosity, I entered immediately, and began to look about me with
eager eyes.
<P>
I saw iron ladles, pans full of white sand, files with white
metal left glittering in their teeth, molds of plaster of Paris,
bags containing the same material in powder, a powerful machine
with the name and use of which I was theoretically not
unacquainted, white metal in a partially-fused state, bottles of
aquafortis, dies scattered over a dresser, crucibles, sandpaper,
bars of metal, and edged tools in plenty, of the strangest
construction. I was not at all a scrupulous man, as the reader
knows by this time; but when I looked at these objects, and
thought of Alicia, I could not for the life of me help
shuddering. There was not the least doubt about it, even after
the little I had seen: the important chemical pursuits to which
Doctor Dulcifer was devoting himself, meant, in plain English and
in one word--Coining.
<P>
Did Alicia know what I knew now, or did she only suspect it?
<P>
Whichever way I answered that question in my own mind, I could be
no longer at any loss for an explanation of her behavior in the
meadow by the stream, or of that unnaturally gloomy, downcast
look which overspread her face when her father's pursuits were
the subject of conversation. Did I falter in my resolution to
marry her, now that I had discovered what the obstacle was which
had made mystery and wretchedness between us? Certainly not. I
was above all prejudices. I was the least particular of mankind.
I had no family affection in my way--and, greatest fact of all, I
was in love. Under those circumstances what Rogue of any spirit
would have faltered? After the first shock of the discovery was
over, my resolution to be Alicia's husband was settled more
firmly than ever.
<P>
There was a little round table in a corner of the room furthest
from the door, which I had not yet examined. A feverish longing
to look at everything within my reach--to penetrate to the
innermost recesses of the labyrinth in which I had involved
myself--consumed me. I went to the table, and saw upon it, ranged
symmetrically side by side, four objects which looked like thick
rulers wrapped up in silver paper. I opened the paper at the end
of one of the rulers, and found that it was composed of
half-crowns. I had closed the paper again, and was just raising
my head from the table over which it had been bent, when my right
cheek came in contact with something hard and cold. I started
back--looked up--and confronted Doctor Dulcifer, holding a pistol
at my right temple.
