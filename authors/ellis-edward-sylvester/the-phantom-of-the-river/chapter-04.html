<p>The arrival of Kenton naturally caused a stir on the part of
all the members of the party that halted on their way through
the Kentucky wilderness to the block-house, somewhat less than
ten miles distant and on the other side of the Ohio River.</p>

<p>Not only Hastings and his brother rangers, but the Ashbridges
and Altmans gathered around the pioneer to hear what he had to
say and the directions as to their own proceedings.</p>

<p>Mr. Ashbridge and his friend Altman were roused by the murmur
of voices and the subdued excitement, and joined the group that
surrounded the tall, athletic figure&mdash;all excepting little Mabel
Ashbridge, who was just getting her tiny dam in shape, and deemed
that of more importance than listening to the conversation of
the elders.</p>

<p>The words of Weber Hastings proved that he was as quick as Boone
and Kenton to comprehend the peculiar peril which confronted the
party.</p>

<p>"It isn't far to the block-house," he replied to the question
of Kenton, "and we can do it in two or three hours, if the redskins
would give us the chance."</p>

<p>"What caused you to make this stop, Weber?"</p>

<p>"Rattlesnake Gulch," was the response.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with that?"</p>

<p>"There's where the Shawanoes mean to ambush us."</p>

<p>"You're right," replied Kenton, nodding his head and compressing
his lips. "That's just what the varmints have fixed things to
do, and if they can do it they'll wipe out every one of this party.
Boone and me made up our minds that that was their trick. He's
gone ahead to watch 'em, and I've come back to help you folks."</p>

<p>"From what Mr. Hastings said," remarked the elder Ashbridge,
who, like his friend Altman, was thoroughly roused, "the woods
are so matted and choked with dense undergrowth on both sides
of the gulch that it is impossible for us to pick our way through
it at night without being heard by the Indians."</p>

<p>"He's right," was the emphatic comment of Kenton, "the thing
can't be done."</p>

<p>"That being admitted," said Altman, "why would it not be wise
to cross the river at this point, or make the rest of the journey
through the Ohio woods? We who know how to swim can take over
those who cannot, or better, perhaps, construct a raft upon which
to float to the other side."</p>

<p>"That would be the idee exactly, if it could be hid from the
varmints, but they're watching us, and have been doing so ever
since we've left the clearing. They know everything you do. Afore
you could get half-way cross the river with the raft they would
open on you from the woods on both sides, and pick off each woman
and gal and them as was pushing the raft."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt what you say," observed Altman, with a shudder
at the graphic picture drawn by the scout, "but it seems strange
to me," he added, with a glance around, as if he expected to catch
sight of some of their terrible enemies, "that they have not already
opened upon us, while we are here in camp, as may be said. What
better chance could they ask?"</p>

<p>"They could pick off a number of you, but Weber here and the
rest of the boys would make them dance to lively music if they
tried it. That's what holds 'em back, for these chaps," remarked
Kenton, looking proudly around upon his companions, "have fout
the varmints afore to-day."</p>

<p>"Then we are doing the only thing possible, by remaining here
until it becomes so late in the day that we shall not reach Rattlesnake
Gulch until after dark, and then, instead of attempting to go
through it, we will cross the river, I presume, though I am not
aware of the decision that has been reached by Mr. Hastings."</p>

<p>"What will they suspect, then, if we stop here?" asked George
Ashbridge.</p>

<p>"Now you've hit the trouble. When they find you don't arrive
at some p'int where they've been looking for you, they'll know
you're stopped. Some of their spies will sneak back through the
woods to l'arn what it means&mdash;more'n likely they've already done
so," added Kenton, with another glance around him, "and then when
they see you setting or standing or lolling around, without any
partic'lar reason for your doing so, they'll understand the real
cause powerful quick. As soon as they diskiver you don't mean
to try the Rattlesnake Gulch route, they'll fix things to open
onto you, and send as many as they can under."</p>

<p>"Then the problem, as I understand it," said the older Ashbridge,
"is to act so as to convince the Indians that we intend to follow
the path through the gulch where they mean to ambuscade us, and
to keep up this impression until nightfall."</p>

<p>"You've hit it precisely, Mr. Ashbridge."</p>

<p>"But how is that to be done? I know of no one beside you to answer
the question."</p>

<p>"Boone and me have been thinking powerful hard over the matter,
and the best thing to be done, as I see it, is this: You know
we left a canoe down by the clearing alongside the boat. I'll
go back there and get it, that is, if it is still there. I'll
try to keep so close in under the bank that the varmints won't
know what I'm driving at. I'll manage to reach a p'int just this
side of Rattlesnake Gulch early in the evening, and will wait
for you. Then I'll hurry the women folks 'cross to the other side
and make the rest of the journey to the block-house on the Ohio
bank."</p>

<p>"You will have to make two trips with the canoe."</p>

<p>"Onless I can find another one that was hid under the bushes
on this side not fur from the gulch. If that's there, I'll take
one party over, and Boone, or some one else, tother."</p>

<p>"And the rest of us will have it out with the redskins," remarked
Weber Hastings, with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>"You must start on agin," said Kenton, addressing Hastings, as
the leader of the party in the absence of himself and Boone; "don't
hurry, for as it is you've got too much time now on your hands.
If you find you're getting too near Rattlesnake Gulch afore sun-down,
you must have some sort of accident that'll give you an excuse
for stopping for a time. That'll keep the varmints from 'specting
anything."</p>

<p>"We ought to be able to arrange some accident," remarked George
Ashbridge, with a smile, slyly pressing the hand of Agnes, standing
beside him. "I'll fall over a log if necessary and break a leg."</p>

<p>"A better plan will be for Jethro to get shot accidentally like."</p>

<p>"Gorrynation, dat won't work!" exclaimed the negro, who did not
let a word escape him; "de bestest way to fix dat will be to stuff
me so full of victuals dat I won't be able to walk alone, and
de rest ob yo' will hab to carry me slow like."</p>

<p>"Wal, time is passing; it won't do to stay here any longer; I
leave you in charge of Weber; he can do as well as me or Boone."</p>

<p>The scout turned to move away, when Jethro Juggens laid his hand
on his arm.</p>

<p>"See yar, Mr. Kenton, I's worried 'bout yo'," said the colored
youth, with an anxious expression on his countenance.</p>

<p>"What's the cause of that?" asked the ranger, who, as already
stated, held a kindly feeling toward the good-natured fellow.</p>

<p>"I's feard sumfin' will happen to yo'&mdash;feels it in my bones;
I tink yo' oughter hab some one to look after yo' while yo's gone."</p>

<p>"Would you like to do it?"</p>

<p>"I tinks a good deal ob yo', Mr. Kenton, and I's willin' to take
keer ob yo', and see dat yo' gets back all right."</p>

<p>Yielding to that waggish disposition which was a marked characteristic
of Simon Kenton, sometimes under the most trying circumstances,
the ranger said:</p>

<p>"Come on, younker, you shall take care of me."</p>

<p>And to the astonishment of the party, the two walked off side
by side, and disappeared among the trees to the westward.</p>

<p>"We'll make this bargain," remarked Kenton, a few minutes after
they were beyond sight of their friends: "You'll take care of
me, and I'll do my best to take care of you."</p>

<p>"Dat hits me 'bout right."</p>

<p>"You'll do just what I tell you to do, and won't speak or move
without my first telling you to do so."</p>

<p>"Dat's it; and yo' won't speak or move without fust askin' me;
I'll be easy with yo', Mr. Kenton."</p>

<p>"But," gravely remarked the scout, "if each of us should happen
to forbid t'other to stir or speak, we'd have to stand still forever.
I'll act as boss at first, and then when I'm ready I'll give you
your turn."</p>

<p>"Dat don't strike me ozactly right, but, as I jist obsarved,
I'll be easy wid yo', Mr. Kenton, and let yo' start in," replied
Jethro, somewhat puzzled at the off-hand manner in which the ranger
took hold of the reins.</p>

<p>But the ranger never laid aside his caution and vigilance. He
kept Jethro Juggens at his heels, forbidding him to speak a word,
but to watch and listen to the utmost. The sun was in the horizon
when, without any special incident, they arrived at the clearing,
which all had left earlier in the day.</p>

<p>The first view brought a disappointment to Kenton. Nothing in
the appearance of the settlers' cabin intimated that it had suffered
any disturbance since the departure of the pioneers, and the unladen
flatboat rested against the bank, just where it lay when the ranger
cast a backward glance at it some hours before. The canoe, however,
which was the magnet that drew him thither, was missing.</p>

<p>It was in as plain sight as the larger craft upon the departure
of the party, but the keen vision was unable to discover the first
outline of the bow or stern. Since it could not have removed itself,
it followed that its disappearance was due to human agency.</p>

<p>"The varmints seem to be everywhere to-day," muttered the impatient
ranger; "they've been there since we left, and more'n likely some
of 'em are there now; but I've come after that canoe, and I'm
going to have it, or my name isn't Sime Kenton."</p>

<p>"Shall I go wid yo' to see yo' don't get hurt?" inquired Jethro
Juggens.</p>

<p>"No; stay where you be, and keep out of sight, and don't speak,
nor stir, nor breathe, till I come back," replied the ranger,
making ready to set out on one of the most perilous adventures
of his eventful career.</p>
