<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>For about exactly two months I remained a guest in Prestongrange’s
family, where I bettered my acquaintance with the bench, the bar,
and the flower of Edinburgh company. You are not to suppose my
education was neglected; on the contrary, I was kept extremely
busy. I studied the French, so as to be more prepared to go to
Leyden; I set myself to the fencing, and wrought hard, sometimes
three hours in the day, with notable advancement; at the suggestion
of my cousin, Pilrig, who was an apt musician, I was put to a
singing class; and by the orders of my Miss Grant, to one for
the dancing, at which I must say I proved far from ornamental.
However, all were good enough to say it gave me an address a little
more genteel; and there is no question but I learned to manage
my coat skirts and sword with more dexterity, and to stand in
a room as though the same belonged to me. My clothes themselves
were all earnestly re-ordered; and the most trifling circumstance,
such as where I should tie my hair, or the colour of my ribbon,
debated among the three misses like a thing of weight. One way
with another, no doubt I was a good deal improved to look at,
and acquired a bit of modest air that would have surprised the
good folks at Essendean.</p>

<p>The two younger misses were very willing to discuss a point of
my habiliment, because that was in the line of their chief thoughts.
I cannot say that they appeared any other way conscious of my
presence; and though always more than civil, with a kind of heartless
cordiality, could not hide how much I wearied them. As for the
aunt, she was a wonderful still woman; and I think she gave me
much the same attention as she gave the rest of the family, which
was little enough. The eldest daughter and the Advocate himself
were thus my principal friends, and our familiarity was much increased
by a pleasure that we took in common. Before the court met we
spent a day or two at the house of Grange, living very nobly with
an open table, and here it was that we three began to ride out
together in the fields, a practice afterwards maintained in Edinburgh,
so far as the Advocate’s continual affairs permitted. When we
were put in a good frame by the briskness of the exercise, the
difficulties of the way, or the accidents of bad weather, my shyness
wore entirely off; we forgot that we were strangers, and speech
not being required, it flowed the more naturally on. Then it was
that they had my story from me, bit by bit, from the time that
I left Essendean, with my voyage and battle in the <em>Covenant</em>,
wanderings in the heather, etc.; and from the interest they found
in my adventures sprung the circumstance of a jaunt we made a
little later on, on a day when the courts were not sitting, and
of which I will tell a trifle more at length.</p>

<p>We took horse early, and passed first by the house of Shaws,
where it stood smokeless in a great field of white frost, for
it was yet early in the day. Here Prestongrange alighted down,
gave me his horse, an proceeded alone to visit my uncle. My heart,
I remember, swelled up bitter within me at the sight of that bare
house and the thought of the old miser sitting chittering within
in the cold kitchen!</p>

<p>"There is my home," said I; "and my family."</p>

<p>"Poor David Balfour!" said Miss Grant.</p>

<p>What passed during the visit I have never heard; but it would
doubtless not be very agreeable to Ebenezer, for when the Advocate
came forth again his face was dark.</p>

<p>"I think you will soon be the laird indeed, Mr. Davie," says
he, turning half about with the one foot in the stirrup.</p>

<p>"I will never pretend sorrow," said I; and, to say the truth,
during his absence Miss Grant and I had been embellishing the
place in fancy with plantations, parterres, and a terrace—much
as I have since carried out in fact.</p>

<p>Thence we pushed to the Queensferry, where Rankeillor gave us
a good welcome, being indeed out of the body to receive so great
a visitor. Here the Advocate was so unaffectedly good as to go
quite fully over my affairs, sitting perhaps two hours with the
Writer in his study, and expressing (I was told) a great esteem
for myself and concern for my fortunes. To while this time, Miss
Grant and I and young Rankeillor took boat and passed the Hope
to Limekilns. Rankeillor made himself very ridiculous (and, I
thought, offensive) with his admiration for the young lady, and
to my wonder (only it is so common a weakness of her sex) she
seemed, if anything, to be a little gratified. One use it had:
for when we were come to the other side, she laid her commands
on him to mind the boat, while she and I passed a little further
to the alehouse. This was her own thought, for she had been taken
with my account of Alison Hastie, and desired to see the lass
herself. We found her once more alone—indeed, I believe her father
wrought all day in the fields—and she curtsied dutifully to the
gentry-folk and the beautiful young lady in the riding-coat.</p>

<p>"Is this all the welcome I am to get?" said I, holding out my
hand. "And have you no more memory of old friends?"</p>

<p>"Keep me! wha’s this of it?" she cried, and then, "God’s truth,
it’s the tautit [19] laddie!"</p>

<p>"The very same," says I.</p>

<p>"Mony’s the time I’ve thocht upon you and your freen, and blythe
am I to see in your braws," [20] she cried. "Though I kent ye
were come to your ain folk by the grand present that ye sent me
and that I thank ye for with a’ my heart."</p>

<p>"There," said Miss Grant to me, "run out by with ye, like a guid
bairn. I didnae come here to stand and haud a candle; it’s her
and me that are to crack."</p>

<p>I suppose she stayed ten minutes in the house, but when she came
forth I observed two things—that her eyes were reddened, and a
silver brooch was gone out of her bosom. This very much affected
me.</p>

<p>"I never saw you so well adorned," said I.</p>

<p>"O Davie man, dinna be a pompous gowk!" said she, and was more
than usually sharp to me the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>About candlelight we came home from this excursion.</p>

<p>For a good while I heard nothing further of Catriona—my Miss
Grant remaining quite impenetrable, and stopping my mouth with
pleasantries. At last, one day that she returned from walking
and found me alone in the parlour over my French, I thought there
was something unusual in her looks; the colour heightened, the
eyes sparkling high, and a bit of a smile continually bitten in
as she regarded me. She seemed indeed like the very spirit of
mischief, and, walking briskly in the room, had soon involved
me in a kind of quarrel over nothing and (at the least) with nothing
intended on my side. I was like Christian in the slough—the more
I tried to clamber out upon the side, the deeper I became involved;
until at last I heard her declare, with a great deal of passion,
that she would take that answer from the hands of none, and I
must down upon my knees for pardon.</p>

<p>The causelessness of all this fuff stirred my own bile. "I have
said nothing you can properly object to," said I, "and as for
my knees, that is an attitude I keep for God."</p>

<p>"And as a goddess I am to be served!" she cried, shaking her
brown locks at me and with a bright colour. "Every man that comes
within waft of my petticoats shall use me so!"</p>

<p>"I will go so far as ask your pardon for the fashion’s sake,
although I vow I know not why," I replied. "But for these play-acting
postures, you can go to others."</p>

<p>"O Davie!" she said. "Not if I was to beg you?"</p>

<p>I bethought me I was fighting with a woman, which is the same
as to say a child, and that upon a point entirely formal.</p>

<p>"I think it a bairnly thing," I said, "not worthy in you to ask,
or me to render. Yet I will not refuse you, neither," said I;
"and the stain, if there be any, rests with yourself." And at
that I kneeled fairly down.</p>

<p>"There!" she cried. "There is the proper station, there is where
I have been manoeuvring to bring you." And then, suddenly, "Kep,"
[21] said she, flung me a folded billet, and ran from the apartment
laughing.</p>

<p>The billet had neither place nor date. "Dear Mr. David," it began,
"I get your news continually by my cousin, Miss Grant, and it
is a pleisand hearing. I am very well, in a good place, among
good folk, but necessitated to be quite private, though I am hoping
that at long last we may meet again. All your friendships have
been told me by my loving cousin, who loves us both. She bids
me to send you this writing, and oversees the same. I will be
asking you to do all her commands, and rest your affectionate
friend, Catriona Macgregor-Drummond. <em>P.S.—</em>Will you not
see my cousin, Allardyce?"</p>

<p>I think it not the least brave of my campaigns (as the soldiers
say) that I should have done as I was here bidden and gone forthright
to the house by Dean. But the old lady was now entirely changed
and supple as a glove. By what means Miss Grant had brought this
round I could never guess; I am sure, at least, she dared not
to appear openly in the affair, for her papa was compromised in
it pretty deep. It was he, indeed, who had persuaded Catriona
to leave, or rather, not to return, to her cousin’s, placing her
instead with a family of Gregorys—decent people, quite at the
Advocate’s disposition, and in whom she might have the more confidence
because they were of his own clan and family. These kept her private
till all was ripe, heated and helped her to attempt her father’s
rescue, and after she was discharged from prison received her
again into the same secrecy. Thus Prestongrange obtained and used
his instrument; nor did there leak out the smallest word of his
acquaintance with the daughter of James More. There was some whispering,
of course, upon the escape of that discredited person; but the
Government replied by a show of rigour, one of the cell porters
was flogged, the lieutenant of the guard (my poor friend, Duncansby)
was broken of his rank, and as for Catriona, all men were well
enough pleased that her fault should be passed by in silence.</p>

<p>I could never induce Miss Grant to carry back an answer. "No,"
she would say, when I persisted, "I am going to keep the big feet
out of the platter." This was the more hard to bear, as I was
aware she saw my little friend many times in the week, and carried
her my news whenever (as she said) I "had behaved myself." At
last she treated me to what she called an indulgence, and I thought
rather more of a banter. She was certainly a strong, almost a
violent, friend to all she liked, chief among whom was a certain
frail old gentlewoman, very blind and very witty, who dwelt on
the top of a tall land on a strait close, with a nest of linnets
in a cage, and thronged all day with visitors. Miss Grant was
very fond to carry me there and put me to entertain her friend
with the narrative of my misfortunes: and Miss Tibbie Ramsay (that
was her name) was particular kind, and told me a great deal that
was worth knowledge of old folks and past affairs in Scotland.
I should say that from her chamber window, and not three feet
away, such is the straitness of that close, it was possible to
look into a barred loophole lighting the stairway of the opposite
house.</p>

<p>Here, upon some pretext, Miss Grant left me one day alone with
Miss Ramsay. I mind I thought that lady inattentive and like one
preoccupied. I was besides very uncomfortable, for the window,
contrary to custom, was left open and the day was cold. All at
once the voice of Miss Grant sounded in my ears as from a distance.</p>

<p>"Here, Shaws!" she cried, "keek out of the window and see what
I have broughten you."</p>

<p>I think it was the prettiest sight that ever I beheld. The well
of the close was all in clear shadow where a man could see distinctly,
the walls very black and dingy; and there from the barred loophole
I saw two faces smiling across at me—Miss Grant’s and Catriona’s.</p>

<p>"There!" says Miss Grant, "I wanted her to see you in your braws
like the lass of Limekilns. I wanted her to see what I could make
of you, when I buckled to the job in earnest!"</p>

<p>It came in my mind that she had been more than common particular
that day upon my dress; and I think that some of the same care
had been bestowed upon Catriona. For so merry and sensible a lady,
Miss Grant was certainly wonderful taken up with duds.</p>

<p>"Catriona!" was all I could get out.</p>

<p>As for her, she said nothing in the world, but only waved her
hand and smiled to me, and was suddenly carried away again from
before the loophole.</p>

<p>That vision was no sooner lost than I ran to the house door,
where I found I was locked in; thence back to Miss Ramsay, crying
for the key, but might as well have cried upon the castle rock.
She had passed her word, she said, and I must be a good lad. It
was impossible to burst the door, even if it had been mannerly;
it was impossible I should leap from the window, being seven storeys
above ground. All I could do was to crane over the close and watch
for their reappearance from the stair. It was little to see, being
no more than the tops of their two heads each on a ridiculous
bobbin of skirts, like to a pair of pincushions. Nor did Catriona
so much as look up for a farewell; being prevented (as I heard
afterwards) by Miss Grant, who told her folk were never seen to
less advantage than from above downward.</p>

<p>On the way home, as soon as I was set free, I upbraided Miss
Grant with her cruelty.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you was disappointed," says she demurely. "For my
part I was very pleased. You looked better than I dreaded; you
looked—if it will not make you vain—a mighty pretty young man
when you appeared in the window. You are to remember that she
could not see your feet," says she, with the manner of one reassuring
me.</p>

<p>"O!" cried I, "leave my feet be—they are no bigger than my neighbours’."</p>

<p>"They are even smaller than some," said she, "but I speak in
parables like a Hebrew prophet."</p>

<p>"I marvel little they were sometimes stoned!" says I. "But, you
miserable girl, how could you do it? Why should you care to tantalise
me with a moment?"</p>

<p>"Love is like folk," says she; "it needs some kind of vivers."
[22]</p>

<p>"Oh, Barbara, let me see her properly!" I pleaded. "<em>You</em>
can—you see her when you please; let me have half an hour."</p>

<p>"Who is it that is managing this love affair! You! Or me?" she
asked, and as I continued to press her with my instances, fell
back upon a deadly expedient: that of imitating the tones of my
voice when I called on Catriona by name; with which, indeed, she
held me in subjection for some days to follow.</p>

<p>There was never the least word heard of the memorial, or none
by me. Prestongrange and his grace the Lord President may have
heard of it (for what I know) on the deafest sides of their heads;
they kept it to themselves, at least—the public was none the wiser;
and in course of time, on November 8th, and in the midst of a
prodigious storm of wind and rain, poor James of the Glens was
duly hanged at Lettermore by Ballachulish.</p>

<p>So there was the final upshot of my politics! Innocent men have
perished before James, and are like to keep on perishing (in spite
of all our wisdom) till the end of time. And till the end of time
young folk (who are not yet used with the duplicity of life and
men) will struggle as I did, and make heroical resolves, and take
long risks; and the course of events will push them upon the one
side and go on like a marching army. James was hanged; and here
was I dwelling in the house of Prestongrange, and grateful to
him for his fatherly attention. He was hanged; and behold! when
I met Mr. Simon in the causeway, I was fain to pull off my beaver
to him like a good little boy before his dominie. He had been
hanged by fraud and violence, and the world wagged along, and
there was not a pennyweight of difference; and the villains of
that horrid plot were decent, kind, respectable fathers of families,
who went to kirk and took the sacrament!</p>

<p>But I had had my view of that detestable business they call politics—I
had seen it from behind, when it is all bones and blackness; and
I was cured for life of any temptations to take part in it again.
A plain, quiet, private path was that which I was ambitious to
walk in, when I might keep my head out of the way of dangers and
my conscience out of the road of temptation. For, upon a retrospect,
it appeared I had not done so grandly, after all; but with the
greatest possible amount of big speech and preparation, had accomplished
nothing.</p>

<p>The 25th of the same month a ship was advertised to sail from
Leith; and I was suddenly recommended to make up my mails for
Leyden. To Prestongrange I could, of course, say nothing; for
I had already been a long while sorning on his house and table.
But with his daughter I was more open, bewailing my fate that
I should be sent out of the country, and assuring her, unless
she should bring me to farewell with Catriona, I would refuse
at the last hour.</p>

<p>"Have I not given you my advice?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I know you have," said I, "and I know how much I am beholden
to you already, and that I am bidden to obey your orders. But
you must confess you are something too merry a lass at times to
lippen [23] to entirely."</p>

<p>"I will tell you, then," said she. "Be you on board by nine o’clock
forenoon; the ship does not sail before one; keep your boat alongside;
and if you are not pleased with my farewells when I shall send
them, you can come ashore again and seek Katrine for yourself."</p>

<p>Since I could make no more of her, I was fain to be content with
this.</p>

<p>The day came round at last when she and I were to separate. We
had been extremely intimate and familiar; I was much in her debt;
and what way we were to part was a thing that put me from my sleep,
like the vails I was to give to the domestic servants. I knew
she considered me too backward, and rather desired to rise in
her opinion on that head. Besides which, after so much affection
shown and (I believe) felt upon both sides, it would have looked
cold-like to be anyways stiff. Accordingly, I got my courage up
and my words ready, and the last chance we were like to be alone,
asked pretty boldly to be allowed to salute her in farewell.</p>

<p>"You forget yourself strangely, Mr. Balfour," said she. "I cannot
call to mind that I have given you any right to presume on our
acquaintancy."</p>

<p>I stood before her like a stopped clock, and knew not what to
think, far less to say, when of a sudden she cast her arms about
my neck and kissed me with the best will in the world.</p>

<p>"You inimitable bairn!" she cried. "Did you think that I would
let us part like strangers? Because I can never keep my gravity
at you five minutes on end, you must not dream I do not love you
very well: I am all love and laughter, every time I cast an eye
on you! And now I will give you an advice to conclude your education,
which you will have need of before it’s very long. Never <em>ask</em>
womenfolk. They’re bound to answer ‘No’; God never made the lass
that could resist the temptation. It’s supposed by divines to
be the curse of Eve: because she did not say it when the devil
offered her the apple, her daughters can say nothing else."</p>

<p>"Since I am so soon to lose my bonny professor," I began.</p>

<p>"This is gallant, indeed," says she curtseying.</p>

<p>"I would put the one question," I went on. "May I ask a lass
to marry to me?"</p>

<p>"You think you could not marry her without!" she asked. "Or else
get her to offer?"</p>

<p>"You see you cannot be serious," said I.</p>

<p>"I shall be very serious in one thing, David," said she: "I shall
always be your friend."</p>

<p>As I got to my horse the next morning, the four ladies were all
at that same window whence we had once looked down on Catriona,
and all cried farewell and waved their pocket napkins as I rode
away. One out of the four I knew was truly sorry; and at the thought
of that, and how I had come to the door three months ago for the
first time, sorrow and gratitude made a confusion in my mind.</p>
