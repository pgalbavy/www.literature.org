<p>Now that the little party had started once more toward the camp
in the Ozark Mountains, they moved at a brisk pace. It took them
but a short time to reach the main trail, where there was a short
pause while Deerfoot made what may be called a microscopic scrutiny
of the ground.</p>

<p>The result did not please him, for he saw the proof that the
Wolf had turned to the right, and had preceded them over the route
which they were to follow. He would have been better satisfied
had he crossed the trail or turned the other way. The fact that
he had gone southward meant that the main party which he was seeking
to join were in that direction, though the keen eyes of the Shawanoe
could detect no signs that they had trodden the same ground. That
signified nothing, however, as they might have pursued a slightly
different route, falling back upon the main path further on.</p>

<p>Deerfoot, in telling his young friends what he had learned, added
that he had no doubt that they would hear from the Winnebagos
again, and possibly at an hour when least expected. Fred Linden
was disturbed more by the knowledge that the party were approaching
the camp where his father and his companions were unsuspicious
of the danger. They could easily steal close enough to the cabin
to shoot down all three without warning.</p>

<p>When he mentioned his fear to Deerfoot, that sagacious young
warrior told him that he saw no cause for anxiety, though he could
not deny that something of the kind might take place. His theory
was that the Winnebagos were not disposed to attack any party
of whites in mere wantonness, the act of the Wolf being the whim
of a single gnarly-brained warrior.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, our young friends were anxious to make the
best progress they could, and, for fully a dozen miles, they kept
up their brisk gait. At the end of that time, the sun was overhead,
and they were obliged to stop on the bank of a broad, swiftly-flowing
stream. The prints made by the hoofs of the horses that had passed
that way some days before were plainly seen, though there had
been a fall of rain since. A glance at the water showed that it
was so deep that the hunters must have swam their animals across.</p>

<p>It would have been an easy matter for the boys to swim also,
but they preferred to use a raft. Accordingly, they set to work,
and it did not take them long to gather enough logs and driftwood
to float all three. These were deftly fastened together by Deerfoot,
who used hickory withes for that purpose, and, then, with a long
pole which he cut and trimmed with his tomahawk, he pushed from
shore.</p>

<p>The propelling pole was fully fifteen feet long, and in the middle
of the stream, the boys were surprised to see that when one end
was pressed against the bottom, no more than two feet were above
the surface: the depth was much greater than they had suspected.</p>

<p>It was hard work to keep the clumsy raft moving at such disadvantage,
but Deerfoot would not yield the pole to either of his companions,
and, after awhile, he drove it against the shore, and all stepped
upon dry land, without so much as their feet having become moistened.</p>

<p>They had been carried some distance below the trail by the current,
but they quickly regained it, and pushed on. Having eaten nothing
since morning, all three were ahungered, but Fred and Terry grimly
determined to wait for Deerfoot to suggest a stop before they
asked for it. Had they but known that many a time, when on the
tramp, he had gone two days and nights without taking a mouthful,
they would not have been so willing to await his pleasure.</p>

<p>But though he would not have thought of stopping before nightfall
had he been alone, he was too considerate to subject them to discomfort;
but it was useless to stop, since as yet they had seen nothing
in the way of game to shoot.</p>

<p>Terry and Fred were beginning to feel impatient with each other
because of their mutual stubbornness when the Shawanoe, who had
been walking quite fast, slackened his pace and turning his head,
said:</p>

<p>"My brothers are hungry, and they shall have to eat."</p>

<p>"Ye couldn't tell us better news," replied the grateful Terry,
"though I would be obliged to ye if ye would impart the information
where there is any chance of our gettin' any such thing, as the
people used to say whin me uncle on me mother's side offered to
bet a sixpence on anythin'."</p>

<p>Deerfoot made no answer, but walking still more slowly, he was
seen to raise his hand to his mouth. Then followed the peculiar
cry that a wild turkey makes when it is lost from its companions.
The Shawanoe knew that the birds were in the surrounding woods,
though none had shown itself.</p>

<p>By and by there was an answer to the call from a point ahead.
Asking the boys to wait where they were, he trotted lightly forward,
and was not absent ten minutes when he came back with a plump
turkey, whose neck he had wrung.</p>

<p>Since the lads had heard no report of a gun, they wanted to know
by what means he had secured it. He replied that he had stood
behind a tree and repeated the call until a group of the birds
approached within a few rods, when he made a dash among them,
and seized his prize before she could spread her wings and fly&mdash;all
of which told of a dexterity that few others possessed.</p>

<p>In a brief while, a good dinner was boiled over the coals, a
short rest taken, and the three were on the road again, it being
their wish to travel further than on the day before. Had Deerfoot
been alone he would have broken into a trot that would have doubled
the distance before the set of sun.</p>

<p>But the trail over which they were walking grew rougher. It was
so rocky in some places that it must have tried the endurance
of the horses ridden by the hunters. Instead of being direct,
it grew very sinuous, made so by the efforts to avoid many formidable
obstacles that rose in front. All this was of little account to
the dusky leader, though of necessity it prolonged the journey,
and he was obliged to slacken his pace to suit those who were
less accustomed to such work.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of the afternoon, when they were checked
again by coming abreast of a stream that was too broad and deep
to be forded. The trail, however, instead of entering the water,
turned up the bank, and the three, under the leadership of Deerfoot,
did the same.</p>

<p>This diversion continued for fully two hundred yards, when the
path struck the water, the point on the other side where the horsemen
had emerged being in plain sight. The former method was resorted
to, and in less than an hour after reaching the creek the three
had safely ferried themselves across. It was neither so broad
nor so deep as the other, but it delayed them fully as much.</p>

<p>Within a half mile from the stream last crossed they came upon
the trail of the whole Winnebago party. Just as Deerfoot suspected,
they had taken another route, and had come back to the main path
a good many miles away from where the Wolf left it the night before.</p>

<p>His experienced eye told him that they were close upon the company,
who numbered precisely twelve&mdash;several more than he supposed.
Whether the Wolf was with them could not of course be learned
until a glimpse of the party themselves was obtained.</p>

<p>Matters had now taken such a shape that the Shawanoe told his
companions that the utmost care must be used, since they were
liable to stumble on the very ones whom they were anxious to avoid.
He instructed them to allow him to keep fully a hundred feet in
advance, and never to diminish the distance without orders from
him.</p>

<p>This was a prudent step, and Fred and Terry did their best to
carry out the wishes of their guide, who walked on at a moderate
pace, without once glancing back at his friends, who he knew would
respect what he had said to them.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that this arrangement was made toward the close
of the afternoon of an autumn day. The three had not traveled
more than two miles, with the leader so far in advance, when the
gathering gloom became such that he would not have been visible
to his followers had he not fallen back so as to keep in sight.</p>

<p>Finally, when less than a dozen yards separated them, and the
graceful figure of the young Shawanoe looked like a shadow gliding
in advance, he suddenly halted. The eyes of the boys were upon
him, and they saw him raise his hand as a signal to stop; they
obeyed without so much as a whisper.</p>

<p>He stood like a statue for two or three minutes, and then, turning
his head without moving his body, beckoned them to approach. They
could barely see the motion of his arm, as they stepped softly
to his side; but before reaching him, they caught the glimmer
of a light among the trees, somewhat in front and to the right.
When they stood near him, they saw it more distinctly.</p>

<p>In a partly open space, near the invariable stream of water,
were a group of Indians, some stretched lazily on the ground,
some squatted like tailors, two busy cooking something over the
fire, and nearly every one smoking long-stemmed, stone pipes.
They were a sturdy set of warriors, who were likely to give a
good account of themselves in a hunt or fight, and both Fred and
Terry knew who they were before Deerfoot, with his arm extended
and his finger pointing toward them, said:</p>

<p>"It is the camp of the Winnebagos!"</p>
