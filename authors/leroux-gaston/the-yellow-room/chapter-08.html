<p>Two minutes later, as Rouletabille was bending over the footprints
discovered in the park, under the window of the vestibule, a man,
evidently a servant at the chateau, came towards us rapidly and
called out to Monsieur Darzac then coming out of the pavilion:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Robert, the magistrate, you know, is questioning Mademoiselle."</p>

<p>Monsieur Darzac uttered a muttered excuse to us and set off running
towards the chateau, the man running after him.</p>

<p>"If the corpse can speak," I said, "it would be interesting to
be there."</p>

<p>"We must know," said my friend. "Let’s go to the chateau." And
he drew me with him. But, at the chateau, a gendarme placed in
the vestibule denied us admission up the staircase of the first
floor. We were obliged to wait down stairs.</p>

<p>This is what passed in the chamber of the victim while we were
waiting below.</p>

<p>The family doctor, finding that Mademoiselle Stangerson was much
better, but fearing a relapse which would no longer permit of
her being questioned, had thought it his duty to inform the examining
magistrate of this, who decided to proceed immediately with a
brief examination. At this examination, the Registrar, Monsieur
Stangerson, and the doctor were present. Later, I obtained the
text of the report of the examination, and I give it here, in
all its legal dryness:</p>

<p>"Question. Are you able, mademoiselle, without too much fatiguing
yourself, to give some necessary details of the frightful attack
of which you have been the victim?</p>

<p>"Answer. I feel much better, monsieur, and I will tell you all
I know. When I entered my chamber I did not notice anything unusual
there.</p>

<p>"Q. Excuse me, mademoiselle,&mdash;if you will allow me, I will ask
you some questions and you will answer them. That will fatigue
you less than making a long recital.</p>

<p>"A. Do so, monsieur.</p>

<p>"Q. What did you do on that day? &mdash;I want you to be as minute
and precise as possible. I wish to know all you did that day,
if it is not asking too much of you.</p>

<p>"A. I rose late, at ten o’clock, for my father and I had returned
home late on the night previously, having been to dinner at the
reception given by the President of the Republic, in honour of
the Academy of Science of Philadelphia. When I left my chamber,
at half-past ten, my father was already at work in the laboratory.
We worked together till midday. We then took half-an-hour’s walk
in the park, as we were accustomed to do, before breakfasting
at the chateau. After breakfast, we took another walk for half
an hour, and then returned to the laboratory. There we found my
chambermaid, who had come to set my room in order. I went into
"The Yellow Room" to give her some slight orders and she directly
afterwards left the pavilion, and I resumed my work with my father.
At five o’clock, we again went for a walk in the park and afterward
had tea.</p>

<p>"Q. Before leaving the pavilion at five o’clock, did you go into
your chamber?</p>

<p>"A. No, monsieur, my father went into it, at my request to bring
me my hat.</p>

<p>"Q. And he found nothing suspicious there?</p>

<p>"A. Evidently no, monsieur.</p>

<p>"Q. It is, then, almost certain that the murderer was not yet
concealed under the bed. When you went out, was the door of the
room locked?</p>

<p>"A. No, there was no reason for locking it.</p>

<p>"Q. You were absent from the pavilion some length of time, Monsieur
Stangerson and you?</p>

<p>"A. About an hour.</p>

<p>"Q. It was during that hour, no doubt, that the murderer got
into the pavilion. But how? Nobody knows. Footmarks have been
found in the park, leading away from the window of the vestibule,
but none has been found going towards it. Did you notice whether
the vestibule window was open when you went out?</p>

<p>"A. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Stangerson. It was closed.</p>

<p>"Q. And when you returned?</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Stangerson. I did not notice.</p>

<p>"M. Stangerson. It was still closed. I remember remarking aloud:
‘Daddy Jacques must surely have opened it while we were away.’</p>

<p>"Q. Strange! &mdash;Do you recollect, Monsieur Stangerson, if
during your absence, and before going out, he had opened it? You
returned to the laboratory at six o’clock and resumed work?</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Stangerson. Yes, monsieur.</p>

<p>"Q. And you did not leave the laboratory from that hour up to
the moment when you entered your chamber?</p>

<p>"M. Stangerson. Neither my daughter nor I, monsieur. We were
engaged on work that was pressing, and we lost not a moment,&mdash;neglecting
everything else on that account.</p>

<p>"Q. Did you dine in the laboratory?</p>

<p>"A. For that reason.</p>

<p>"Q. Are you accustomed to dine in the laboratory?</p>

<p>"A. We rarely dine there.</p>

<p>"Q. Could the murderer have known that you would dine there that
evening?</p>

<p>"M. Stangerson. Good Heavens! &mdash;I think not. It was only
when we returned to the pavilion at six o’clock, that we decided,
my daughter and I, to dine there. At that moment I was spoken
to by my gamekeeper, who detained me a moment, to ask me to accompany
him on an urgent tour of inspection in a part of the woods which
I had decided to thin. I put this off until the next day, and
begged him, as he was going by the chateau, to tell the steward
that we should dine in the laboratory. He left me, to execute
the errand and I rejoined my daughter, who was already at work.</p>

<p>"Q. At what hour, mademoiselle, did you go to your chamber while
your father continued to work there?</p>

<p>"A. At midnight.</p>

<p>"Q. Did Daddy Jacques enter "The Yellow Room" in the course of
the evening?</p>

<p>"A. To shut the blinds and light the night-light.</p>

<p>"Q. He saw nothing suspicious?</p>

<p>"A. He would have told us if he had seen. Daddy Jacques is an
honest man and very attached to me.</p>

<p>"Q. You affirm, Monsieur Stangerson, that Daddy Jacques remained
with you all the time you were in the laboratory?</p>

<p>"M. Stangerson. I am sure of it. I have no doubt of that.</p>

<p>"Q. When you entered your chamber, mademoiselle, you immediately
shut the door and locked and bolted it? That was taking unusual
precautions, knowing that your father and your servant were there?
Were you in fear of something, then?</p>

<p>"A. My father would be returning to the chateau and Daddy Jacques
would be going to his bed. And, in fact, I did fear something.</p>

<p>"Q. You were so much in fear of something that you borrowed Daddy
Jacques’s revolver without telling him you had done so?</p>

<p>"A. That is true. I did not wish to alarm anybody,&mdash;the more,
because my fears might have proved to have been foolish.</p>

<p>"Q. What was it you feared?</p>

<p>"A. I hardly know how to tell you. For several nights, I seemed
to hear, both in the park and out of the park, round the pavilion,
unusual sounds, sometimes footsteps, at other times the cracking
of branches. The night before the attack on me, when I did not
get to bed before three o’clock in the morning, on our return
from the Elysee, I stood for a moment before my window, and I
felt sure I saw shadows.</p>

<p>"Q. How many?</p>

<p>"A. Two. They moved round the lake,&mdash;then the moon became clouded
and I lost sight of them. At this time of the season, every year,
I have generally returned to my apartment in the chateau for the
winter; but this year I said to myself that I would not quit the
pavilion before my father had finished the resume of his works
on the ‘Dissociation of Matter’ for the Academy. I did not wish
that that important work, which was to have been finished in the
course of a few days, should be delayed by a change in our daily
habit. You can well understand that I did not wish to speak of
my childish fears to my father, nor did I say anything to Daddy
Jacques who, I knew, would not have been able to hold his tongue.
Knowing that he had a revolver in his room, I took advantage of
his absence and borrowed it, placing it in the drawer of my night-table.</p>

<p>   "Q. You know of no enemies you have?</p>

<p>   "A. None.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Q. You understand, mademoiselle, that these precautions are<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calculated to cause surprise?

</p>
<p>
"M. Stangerson. Evidently, my child, such precautions are very<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surprising.

</p>
<p>
"A. No;&mdash;because I have told you that I had been uneasy for two<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nights.

</p>
<p>
"M. Stangerson. You ought to have told me of that! This misfortune<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would have been avoided.

</p>
</div>
<p>   "Q. The door of "The Yellow Room" locked, did you go to bed?</p>

<p>   "A. Yes, and, being very tired, I at once went to sleep.</p>

<p>   "Q. The night-light was still burning?</p>

<p>   "A. Yes, but it gave a very feeble light.</p>

<p>   "Q. Then, mademoiselle, tell us what happened.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"A. I do not know whether I had been long asleep, but suddenly I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;awoke&mdash;and uttered a loud cry.

</p>
<p>
"M. Stangerson. Yes&mdash;a horrible cry&mdash;‘Murder!’<br/>
&mdash;It still rings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in my ears.

</p>
</div>
<p>   "Q. You uttered a loud cry?</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"A. A man was in my chamber. He sprang at me and tried to strangle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me.  I was nearly stifled when suddenly I was able to reach the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drawer of my night-table and grasp the revolver which I had<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;placed in it.  At that moment the man had forced me to the foot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of my bed and brandished in over my head a sort of mace.  But<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had fired.  He immediately struck a terrible blow at my head.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that, monsieur, passed more rapidly than I can tell it, and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know nothing more.

</p>
<p>
"Q. Nothing?<br/>
&mdash;Have you no idea as to how the assassin could<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;escape from your chamber?

</p>
<p>
"A. None whatever<br/>
&mdash;I know nothing more. One does not know what<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is passing around one, when one is unconscious.

</p>
</div>
<p>   "Q. Was the man you saw tall or short, little or big?</p>

<p>   "A. I only saw a shadow which appeared to me formidable.</p>

<p>   "Q. You cannot give us any indication?</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"A. I know nothing more, monsieur, than that a man threw himself<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon me and that I fired at him.  I know nothing more."

</p>
</div>
<p>Here the interrogation of Mademoiselle Stangerson concluded.</p>

<p>Rouletabille waited patiently for Monsieur Robert Darzac, who
soon appeared.</p>

<p>From a room near the chamber of Mademoiselle Stangerson, he had
heard the interrogatory and now came to recount it to my friend
with great exactitude, aided by an excellent memory. His docility
still surprised me. Thanks to hasty pencil-notes, he was able
to reproduce, almost textually, the questions and the answers
given.</p>

<p>It looked as if Monsieur Darzac were being employeeed as the
secretary of my young friend and acted as if he could refuse him
nothing; nay, more, as if under a compulsion to do so.</p>

<p>The fact of the closed window struck the reporter as it had struck
the magistrate. Rouletabille asked Darzac to repeat once more
Mademoiselle Stangerson’s account of how she and her father had
spent their time on the day of the tragedy, as she had stated
it to the magistrate. The circumstance of the dinner in the laboratory
seemed to interest him in the highest degree; and he had it repeated
to him three times. He also wanted to be sure that the forest-keeper
knew that the professor and his daughter were going to dine in
the laboratory, and how he had come to know it.</p>

<p>When Monsieur Darzac had finished, I said: "The examination has
not advanced the problem much."</p>

<p>"It has put it back," said Monsieur Darzac.</p>

<p>"It has thrown light upon it," said Rouletabille, thoughtfully.</p>
