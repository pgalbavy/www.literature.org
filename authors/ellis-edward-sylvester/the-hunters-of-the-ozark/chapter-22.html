<p>It was an interesting scene on which the three youths looked.
There were a dozen Winnebago warriors lolling and smoking in camp,
while two of their number were preparing their supper, by half-broiling
it over the blaze and coals. Fred and Terry stood in silence by
the side of Deerfoot, gazing upon the strangers with a curiosity
such as no other sight could have inspired.</p>

<p>A small tree interfered somewhat with the view of Fred, and he
took a step forward. Immediately the Shawanoe put out his arm
and shook his head to signify that that would not do; they were
as close as was safe. Then Fred shifted his position a little
to one side, as you feel like doing in a public hall when a column
is in front of you. To this Deerfoot offered no objection, and
the lad was satisfied.</p>

<p>"Begorrah, but there's the spalpeen!" whispered Terry, in some
excitement, pointing his finger toward the camp, and with no thought
of the uselessness of such an act.</p>

<p>The others knew that he referred to the Wolf, who had caused
them so much trouble, but they had already seen him. He was standing
at one end of the group, with folded arms, while he scowled, and
the firelight fell upon his features with such directness that
the scowl could be plainly seen. He appeared to be looking at
the two warriors busy with the fire, though more than likely his
gaze fell indifferently upon them and the rest, all of whom were
in his field of vision.</p>

<p>The tomahawk showed in his girdle, but of course he was without
any other weapon, and Terry could not avoid a smile when he noted
it and he had to say something despite the displeasure of Deerfoot.</p>

<p>"Do ye observe his left eye and the end of his nose where one
of me blows landed? What could be foiner than the swell that ye
see there? He will naad to use no black paint for siveral days,
as me grandfather&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this point Deerfoot deliberately placed his hand over the
mouth of the speaker, abruptly ending what he proposed to say.</p>

<p>Now, nothing could be clearer than that if the Winnebago party
were in such plain view of the three youths, the latter in turn
were liable to be discovered by them. They were standing beyond
the circle of firelight, where the darkness screened them from
sight, and, if one of the red men should look in that direction,
he could not have seen them; but there was the probability that
any moment one of the warriors might start out to reconnoiter
their surroundings, in which event, discovery was almost certain.
Besides, the exuberant spirits of Terry Clark taught Deerfoot
that it was unwise to trust him in such a delicate position.</p>

<p>Altogether, the time spent in watching the Winnebagos was barely
ten minutes. During that period, some of those reclining on the
leaves got up, walked about and sat down again; others kept their
feet, and one stepped to where the two were busy with a steak
of some kind that they were broiling over the coals, as though
his hunger was making him impatient.</p>

<p>But the Wolf never stirred a muscle, and Terry afterward insisted
that he did not wink his eyes, so motionless was he. The same
scowl added hideousness to the painted face, and it was easy to
understand that his meditations were of any thing but a pleasant
nature.</p>

<p>Turning his back upon the camp, Deerfoot motioned for them to
go back. They did so, he following on their heels until not the
faintest glimmer of the fire could be seen. Then he led them by
a round-about course to the trail beyond the camp, and explained
his wishes.</p>

<p>He was now free to admit that there was reason to believe the
Winnebagos intended an assault upon the three hunters among the
foothills of the Ozark, and who were unsuspicious of such danger.
Of course the Shawanoe had no direct knowledge that such was their
purpose, but he was so convinced that he meant to take the utmost
precautions against it.</p>

<p>He therefore proposed that he should linger near the camp until
he could learn of a verity what their intentions were. If they
meant to attack the Hunters of the Ozark, then he would hasten
to give warning to Linden, Hardin and Bowlby, who, re-enforced
by the three youths, would be strong enough to beat off an Indian
party twice as strong.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Deerfoot wished Terry and Fred to push toward
the camp with all the speed of which they were capable, he promising
to follow as soon as he could. They had walked almost the entire
day with scarcely a halt on the road, but he wished them to keep
on into the night so long as they could. They would need nothing
to eat before morning and between sundown and sunup they ought
to make a long advance on their journey.</p>

<p>You will probably wonder why (the situation being such as was
explained by Deerfoot), he did not keep company with the lads
and help them in their forced march to the mountains. One reason
was that he was convinced in the first place that a demonstration
would be made by the Winnebagos against the Hunters of the Ozark,
and he wanted to get both boys&mdash;especially Terry&mdash;out of the neighborhood
as soon as he could; for their presence hampered his own actions.
The safest place for them was in the strong cabin to the southward,
and they could not get there too soon.</p>

<p>Yet they would certainly travel as fast in his company as by
themselves, and Fred and Terry, therefore, could not see why he
should stay behind instead of going with them; yet Deerfoot the
Shawanoe never took a step of that kind without the best reason
for it, as you will admit when it is made clear to you. To give
this explanation would require such a long diversion from the
thread of my story that you would be impatient. Before I am through
with the history of Deerfoot, you shall know not only the reason
for his course but for several other things that have been referred
to in the stories told about him.</p>

<p>The confidence of Fred Lincoln and Terry Clark in the wonderful
young Shawanoe was so perfect that they did not question any decision,
no matter how little they failed to see its reason. If what he
asked was in their power, they would bound at the chance of doing
it, just as they did now.</p>

<p>He had a parting warning to give.</p>

<p>"Let my brothers make sure that they do not lose the trail; they
must look at the ground often: when they do not see the path they
must stop and await the rising of the sun; they can not reach
the cabin too soon, but they can never reach it by going wrong;
<em>keep to the trail</em>!"</p>

<p>The circuitous route which they had taken under the guidance
of Deerfoot, had brought them back to the path at a point fully
a hundred yards beyond the camp-fire, which had been started in
the small open space only a few rods from the path. So far as
they knew there was nothing now between them in the way of a direct
advance to the cabin of their hunters.</p>

<p>"Fred," said Terry, after they were fairly under way, and while
he almost stepped on the heels of his friend; "Deerfoot thinks
we won't go more than five or six miles; let's show him that we
ain't such babies as he thinks."</p>

<p>"I feel as you do; I propose that we keep it up all night."</p>

<p>"Will ye be kind enough to raich yer right hand over your lift
shoulder and shake wid me on the same?"</p>

<p>Instead of doing precisely as asked, Fred laughingly turned about
and shook hands with his friend, whom he loved and for whom he
was ready at any time to risk his life. They were on their mettle
and they meant to show the young Shawanoe that they were capable
of doing much more than he seemed to believe. They intended that
when, after a few hours, he started to overtake them, he would
find that he had a good many miles further to travel than he supposed.</p>

<p>Had Deerfoot known of their thoughts he would have smiled and
been pleased. He wanted them to do their best and he was willing,
should it prove to be safe, to allow them to keep up the delusion
that their gait could bear any comparison with the speed of which
he was capable.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the boys started in earnest to carry out their intention.
Their only fear was that they might be hindered by the difficulty
in keeping to the trail; for though the full moon was again overhead,
and though many of the leaves had fallen from the trees, little
light was there to help them.</p>

<p>But for a time, at least, the difficulty was much less than they
expected. The path, though it continued to lead over rough places
and around obstructions, sometimes up-hill and sometimes down,
was still so clearly marked that Fred Linden went forward with
scarcely a halt or any hesitation.</p>

<p>Though there are men who have walked their five and six hundred
miles with little rest on the road, it is a severe task for any
one to keep it up through an entire day and night, as you can
soon become convinced by making the experiment; but Fred and Terry
were sturdy, strong-limbed fellows, born and bred on the frontier,
who were capable of standing a great deal. When, therefore, they
meant to astonish Deerfoot by their progress during the night,
they felt no distrust of their ability in that direction.</p>

<p>There was no reason why they should put any restraint on themselves,
and they talked quite cheerily, Terry indulging now and then in
some of his quaint remarks. But a tired boy does not feel like
keeping up a lively conversation for any length of time, and so
it came about that after awhile they walked steadily forward,
for miles at a time, without exchanging more than a few syllables.
Terry could see the figure of his friend with his rifle over his
shoulder always a few feet in front, there being just enough light
in the gloom to keep his form in sight, while Fred heard the steady
tramp, tramp behind him, sometimes keeping pace with his own and
sometimes falling "out of step."</p>

<p>"Helloa! this is too bad!" suddenly exclaimed Fred, coming to
an abrupt halt; "I guess this ends our tramp for to-night."</p>
