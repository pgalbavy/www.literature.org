Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time.

</p>
<p>
<em>SHAKSPEARE</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>The crackling of the bushes continued, while the Rifleman compressed
his lips and stood like a tiger at bay. In a moment he saw a man
making his way through the tangled shrubbery, and almost immediately
he lowered his rifle with an expression of disappointment. The
individual before him was so different from what he expected,
that a fuller notice of him is necessary, especially as he now
takes his place as one of the <em>dramatis person√¶</em> of this
tale.</p>

<p>He appeared to be an awkward countryman, cowardly, ignorant of
wood-craft, and completely bewildered by the dangers that beset
him. His dress was half-savage and half-civilized, torn and disfigured,
as if he had been running at the top of his speed through a thicket
of briers and brambles. The only weapon he carried was a large
knife firmly grasped in his hand. His face was blank and expressionless,
save that it bore the impress of great animal fear, now mingled
with surprise at confronting our two friends so unexpectedly.
His head was round, bullet-like, with sandy hair, while the face
seemed stained and begrimed with dirt and perspiration. He stood
a moment with both hands stretched stiffly downward, his mouth
wide open, apparently unable to find words to express his astonishment.</p>

<p>"Well, young man, good-day to you," said Dernor, advancing toward
him.</p>

<p>"Good-day&mdash;good-day; fine weather for corn," he repeated, as
if anxious to gain the good opinion of the hunter.</p>

<p>"How came you in these parts, my friend?"</p>

<p>"Heaven save you, I <em>run</em> here. The Injins have been after
me."</p>

<p>"They didn't catch you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the young man, bursting into a loud guffaw.
"I run too fast."</p>

<p>"What might be your name?"</p>

<p>"Zeke Hunt, but I'm derned 'fraid it won't be any name at all
if I stay in these parts much longer. Oh, dear," whined the young
man, "I wish I was back in Pennsylvany, on the farm."</p>

<p>"What made you leave it?"</p>

<p>"The old man whipped me, and I run away."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go back?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather meet all the painted Injins in the woods than him.
He'd whip me all through the town."</p>

<p>"No doubt you deserve it."</p>

<p>"Boo-hoo! you ain't going to lick me too, are you?" plead the
man, gouging one eye with his finger.</p>

<p>"No, no; don't make a fool of yourself. What would I wish to
hurt you for?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure. I'm 'fraid of everybody."</p>

<p>"See here, Zeke, was there any Injins chasing you, just now?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no. I've been clear of them a long time, I run so fast;
but I'm just as afeard, as I s'pose the Injins are all over the
woods."</p>

<p>"Not so bad as that, though we'd be willing to get along if there
was a few less."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so. Got any thing to eat?"</p>

<p>"No, but we'll soon have something."</p>

<p>"Can I go 'long with you?" asked the frightened fellow.</p>

<p>"If you wish to, provided you do what I want you to."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll do any thing for you. Who's that with you?" he questioned,
peering around the hunter, who, although he had advanced a few
steps, still stood in front of Edith.</p>

<p>"A young friend, Miss Edith Sudbury."</p>

<p>"Glad to see you," said the young man, with an awkward bow.</p>

<p>"But see here," pursued the Rifleman, "how comes it you are in
these woods at all? You didn't come all the way from Pennsylvany
alone?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;oh, no. I came down the Ohio in a flat-boat."</p>

<p>"How is it that you are here, then?"</p>

<p>"The other day we stopped along the shore a while, and I went
off in the woods, and got lost. When I found my way back, the
flat-boat had gone, and I was left alone. I've been wandering
around ever since, and am nearly starved to death. Be you two
hunting?"</p>

<p>"No, we are making our way to a settlement some miles off. Do
you wish to go with us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, anywhere to get out of these derned woods. Gracious! what
a big job it'll be to cut all these trees down," said young Hunt,
looking above and around him, as though absorbed with this new
idea.</p>

<p>"A big job, certainly; but there'll be a big lot to do it when
the time comes. There don't appear to be any reason why we should
wait, and so we'll move ahead."</p>

<p>"Which way are you going?"</p>

<p>"Right ahead."</p>

<p>"Over the same ground that I come over?"</p>

<p>"I s'pose so."</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens! you are lost if you do. Don't do that."</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Any danger?"</p>

<p>"The woods are chuck full of Injins, I tell you. There must have
somebody passed that way and they looking for them, there are
so many."</p>

<p>Dernor turned and spoke to Edith:</p>

<p>"No doubt he is right. It is but what I suspected. What shall
I do? Take a longer way home, and a safer one, or the short route?"</p>

<p>"Take the <em>safest</em>, whichever that may be."</p>

<p>"That is the longest. Come on, friend."</p>

<p>"I'm follerin'," replied that worthy, striding after him.</p>

<p>It was considerably past the hour of noon, and the brisk walk
through the woods had given the Rifleman an appetite something
akin to that of his new-found companion, so that he did not forget
the expressed wish of the latter. He had no difficulty in bringing
down another turkey and cooking it. There was one peculiarity
which did not escape either Dernor or Edith. On the part of the
latter it occasioned no concern, but it was the subject of considerable
wonder and speculation with the former. Zeke Hunt, as he called
himself, professed to be ravenously hungry; but when the tempting,
juicy meat of the turkey was placed before him, he swallowed but
a few mouthfuls. This was a small matter, it was true, and with
any one except the Rifleman, would have escaped notice but this
sagacious hunter considered it of so much importance as to ask
an explanation.</p>

<p>"You appeared to be dying with hunger, and now, when food is
offered, you hardly touch it. What is the meaning of that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Zeke, wiping his fingers on the hair of
his head.</p>

<p>"Yes, you do know. Tell me the meaning of it."</p>

<p>"S'pose I ain't hungry."</p>

<p>"Isn't the bird cooked well enough?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't hurt if 'twas cooked better."</p>

<p>The Rifleman at first was disposed to resent this insult, but,
on second thought, he set the man down as a fool, and one unworthy
of notice. There is no disguising the fact that his action had
given the hunter an unpleasant suspicion, which, however, was
dissipated by the perfect coolness with which he met his inquiry.</p>

<p>"I guess yer ain't used to cookin', be you?" he asked, perfectly
unabashed by the frigid manner of the hunter.</p>

<p>"I've done considerable, sir, in the last few years."</p>

<p>"Don't say so. Shouldn't have thought it, from the way that thing
looks."</p>

<p>"What is the matter with this cooking, I should like to know;
eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothin', as I knows on. The gal appears to like it well
enough."</p>

<p>"Indeed I do," said Edith, unable to restrain a laugh at the
manner of their new companion, who, seeing it, rolled his head
back and gave an answering "horse-laugh" that could have been
heard a half-mile distant.</p>

<p>"Don't let me hear that agin," said the Rifleman, rising to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Why don't you want to hear it?" asked Zeke, in blank astonishment.</p>

<p>"It's no wonder the flat-boat left you, if you were in the habit
of making such noises as that. It's enough to wake every sleeping
Injin in these woods."</p>

<p>"It'll scare 'em, I guess, won't it?"</p>

<p>"I should think it would, so don't try it agin."</p>

<p>"Done eatin'?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"Thought it was about time."</p>

<p>"We will not reach home to-night," said the Rifleman, speaking
to Edith. "I'm sorry, for they'll be worried about us."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, too, for I dislike to remain in the woods so long."</p>

<p>"This fellow will be of little use to us, as he doesn't appear
to know any thing. I can't understand how he has come this far.
He's been lucky, I s'pose, but whether we're going to be, with
him along, is more than I can tell."</p>

<p>"Of course you won't turn him off. It would be cruel," said Edith,
sincerely commiserating the helpless situation of the young man.</p>

<p>"As long as he behaves himself, and it doesn't make it any more
dangerous for you, he can stay with us; but he mustn't open that
big mouth of his as wide as he did just now."</p>

<p>"Hello! how long afore you're goin' to start?" called out Zeke,
as our two friends stood talking together.</p>

<p>"Follow behind us, and make no noise, if you want to save your
top-knot."</p>

<p>"Hope there ain't no danger of that happening, after I've come
as far as this all right."</p>

<p>The three moved forward once again, the movements of the Rifleman
characterized by his usual caution, while Zeke Hunt straddled
along at a most awkward gait, kicking up the leaves, and breaking
and bending the undergrowth in such a manner as to make the care
of the hunter entirely useless. In this manner they traveled until
nightfall, when they reached the banks of a small brook, beside
which it was decided to encamp for the night. During the latter
part of the day it had been steadily growing colder, so that,
after some deliberation, Dernor concluded to start a fire.</p>

<p>"You don't s'pose the Injins will see it, do you?" asked Hunt.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I can't tell. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"'Cause, if <em>they</em> are goin' to see it, I want to get
out the way. I don't s'pose you've traveled the woods much, have
you?"</p>

<p>"Probably as much as you have."</p>

<p>"You have, eh?"</p>

<p>There was something in the tone in which this was uttered that
made the hunter turn and look at Zeke Hunt. As he did so, he saw
an expression of his greenish, gray goggle-eyes that made him
feel certain, for the minute, that he had seen him before. It
may have been a fancy, for the expression was gone instantly,
and succeeded by the same blank, half-idiotic look.</p>

<p>This was the second time the same unpleasant suspicion had entered
the mind of the Rifleman, and he was resolved, at the least, to
keep an eye upon Zeke Hunt. While it was not at all impossible
that the story he had told was true in every particular, still
there was an air of improbability about it, which could not escape
the notice of so quick-sighted a man as Dernor, and, from this
time forward, every action or word of the awkward countryman was
watched with a jealous eye.</p>

<p>The fire which was kindled was carefully screened, so that it
would not be apt to catch the eye of any one in the neighborhood.
After some conversation between the hunter and Edith, the latter
wrapped his blanket over her own, and, thus protected, lay down
upon the ground. The weariness and fatigue brought on by the day's
travel soon manifested itself in a deep, dreamless, refreshing
sleep.</p>

<p>"Are you going to stay up all night?" asked Dernor of the countryman.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether I am or not."</p>

<p>"Ain't you sleepy?"</p>

<p>"Don't feel much so jest now; s'pose I mought after a while."</p>

<p>"You have traveled enough. Why don't you feel sleepy?"</p>

<p>"Haw! haw! haw! what a question. How do I know why I ain't sleepy?
You don't appear so yourself."</p>

<p>"I ain't, either."</p>

<p>"You've done as much tramping as I have."</p>

<p>"That may be; but I'm used to it, and you ain't."</p>

<p>"Don't know 'bout that. Used to do good 'eal of it up on the
farm. Say, you, did you ever hear of the Riflemen of the Miami?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very often. They are sometimes seen in these parts."</p>

<p>"I'd like to jine them 'ere fellers."</p>

<p>"You jine 'em!" repeated Dernor, contemptuously. "You'd be a
pretty chap to go with them. Them chaps, sir, is <em>hunters</em>!"
he added, in a triumphant tone.</p>

<p>"Jest what I s'posed, and that's why I wanted to jine 'em."</p>

<p>"Can you shoot?"</p>

<p>"Ef you'll lend me your iron there a minute, I'll show you what
I can do."</p>

<p>"It is dark now. There is no chance to show your skill. Wait
till morning."</p>

<p>"Very well, don't forget. I've done some shootin', fur all I
ain't used to Injins. But, I say, do you know the head feller
of them Riflemen?"</p>

<p>"I'm very well acquainted with him."</p>

<p>"What sort of a chap is he?"</p>

<p>"Good deal such a man as I am."</p>

<p>"Haw! haw! great man to be the leader. Hope you're never taken
for him, be you?"</p>

<p>"Very often&mdash;because <em>I am</em> the leader of the Riflemen
myself."</p>

<p>"Get out," said the countryman, as if he expected to be bitten.
"You can't make me believe that."</p>

<p>"It makes no difference to me whether you believe it or not.
If you make much more noise, like enough you'll find out who I
am."</p>

<p>"Be you really the leader of the Riflemen?" queried Zeke Hunt,
not noticing the warning which had just been uttered.</p>

<p>"I've told you once, so let's hear no more about it."</p>

<p>"My gracious! you don't look much like one. 'Pears to me you
and I look a good deal alike. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Heaven save me, <em>I hope</em> not."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm willing that it should be so. I ain't offended."</p>

<p>The impudence of the countryman was so consummate that Dernor
could not restrain a laugh at it.</p>

<p>"They always considered me good-looking down hum," he added;
"and there wasn't a gal I wasn't able to get if I wanted her."</p>

<p>"I should think you would be anxious to get back again."</p>

<p>"Would be, if it wasn't for the old man. He was <em>awful</em>
on me. Didn't appear to be proud of me at all."</p>

<p>"Queer, sure. I don't see how he could help it."</p>

<p>"Me neither. Dad was always mad, though, and used to aboose me
shameful. The fust thing in my life that I can remember was of
gettin' a lickin'."</p>

<p>"What was it for?"</p>

<p>"Nothin' worth tellin'. I was a little feller then, and one day
heated the poker red-hot, and run it down grandmother's back.
But there! didn't he lam me for that! Always was whippin' me.
School-teacher was just as bad. Licked me like blazes the fust
day."</p>

<p>"Did he lick you for nothin'?"</p>

<p>"Purty near. Didn't do any thing except to put a handful of gunpowder
in a dry inkstand, and then touch it off under his chair. Haw!
haw! haw! didn't he jump? and oh gracious!" he added, in a solemn
tone, "didn't I jump, too, when he fell on me."</p>

<p>"You seem to have been about the biggest scamp in the country.
Why did he whip you this last time when you run away?"</p>

<p>"Hadn't any more reason than he had at other times. I tried to
take Ann Parsons home from singing-school, and she wouldn't let
me. That was the reason."</p>

<p>"He couldn't have whipped you for that."</p>

<p>"Well, it all come from that. I followed her home, and jest give
her my opinion of her, and when her old man undertook to say any
thing, I jest pitched in and walloped him."</p>

<p>"You had a sensible father, and it's a pity he hasn't got you
now, for I don't care any thing about your company."</p>

<p>"You going to turn me off? You said you wouldn't."</p>

<p>"And I shan't, I tell you agin, as long as you behave yourself.
If you cac'late to go with me to the settlement, you must not
have too much to say. Remember that we are still in dangerous
territory, and a little foolishness by either of us may bring
a pack of the red-skins upon us."</p>

<p>"Just what I thought. I'm sleepy."</p>

<p>And without further ceremony, he lolled over on the ground, and
in a few minutes, to all appearances, was sound asleep. Intently
watching his face for a time, the Rifleman now and then saw his
eyelids partly unclose, as if he wished to ascertain whether any
one was scrutinizing him. The somewhat lengthy conversation which
we have taken the pains to record, had about disarmed the hunter
of the suspicions which had been lingering with him for a long
time. He believed Zeke Hunt an ignorant fellow, who had been left
along the Ohio river, as he had related, and who had not yet learned
that trait of civilized society, carefully to conceal his thoughts
and feelings when in conversation. The impression which he first
felt, of having met him before, might easily arise from his resemblance
to some former acquaintance.</p>

<p>Still, the Rifleman was by no means so forgetful of his charge
as to indulge in slumber, when there was the remotest probability
of danger threatening her. Inured as he was to all manner of hardships
and suffering, it was no difficult matter for him to spend several
nights in succession without sleep. He therefore watched over
her through the second night, never, for a single moment, allowing
himself to become unconscious. Several times he saw the countryman
raise his head and change his position, and when spoken to, heard
him mutter something about it being "derned hard to sleep with
his head on the soft side of a stone, and one side toasted and
the other froze."</p>

<p>The hours wore away without any incident worth mentioning, and
at the first appearance of day Edith was astir and ready to resume
the journey. Enough of the turkey, slain on the day before, remained
to give each a sufficient meal, and with cheerful spirits upon
the part of all, the three again took up their march through the
wilderness.</p>

<p>The route which the information of the countryman led the hunter
to adopt was such that he expected to reach the settlement in
the course of the afternoon. It will thus be seen that it was
a very circuitous one&mdash;they, in fact, being already several miles
north of their destination. As yet, the eagle eye of the hunter
had discovered no danger, and their march was continued without
interruption until noon, when they halted for a few minutes' rest.</p>

<p>"If you haint no 'bjection, I'll try a shot with your gun," said
Zeke Hunt, "bein' as you thought I couldn't shoot any."</p>

<p>"I'd rather not have my rifle fired at present, youngster, as
ears that we don't fancy might hear it."</p>

<p>"You're only afeard I might beat you, that's all."</p>

<p>This remark so nettled the hunter that he resolved to gratify
his disagreeable companion.</p>

<p>"Put up your mark, then," said he, "and as far off as you choose."</p>

<p>The countryman walked to a tree somewhat over a hundred yards
distant, and with his knife clipped off a small piece of bark,
leaving a gleaming spot, an inch or two in diameter.</p>

<p>"You fire first," said he, as he came back.</p>

<p>The hunter drew up his rifle, and pausing hardly a second to
take aim, buried the bullet fairly in the center of the target.</p>

<p>"Whew! that's derned good; don't believe I can beat it much;
but I'll try."</p>

<p>The gun was quickly reloaded, and, after taking aim and adjusting
it nearly a dozen times, Zeke Hunt fired, missing the tree altogether.
As he ran to ascertain the result of his shot, instead of handing
the rifle to Dernor, he carried it, apparently without thinking,
with him. When he had carefully examined the mark, he proceeded
to reload it, before returning. This was so natural an occurrence,
that the hunter received his weapon without noticing it.</p>

<p>"Want to fire again?" asked the countryman.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't worth while."</p>

<p>"I give in, but think I'll be up to you after a little practice."</p>

<p>About half an hour afterward, as they were walking along, Dernor,
by a mere accident, happened to look at the pan of his rifle and
saw that the priming had been removed. A moment's reflection convinced
him that this had been done by Zeke Hunt, not accidentally, but
on purpose. The hunter managed to reprime without being noticed,
and he made a vow that this apparent lubber should henceforth
be watched with a lynx-eye.</p>

<p>They had gone scarcely a half-mile further, when the latter came
up beside Edith, and remarked that he had been taken sick.</p>

<p>"Don't you feel able to walk?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm dreadful afeard I shall have to ax you to pause for a while,"
he said, manifesting that peculiar repugnance to receiving kindness,
which, singularly enough is manifested more or less by every person
in similar circumstances.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" gruffly asked Dernor, who was still meditating
upon the incident we have mentioned above.</p>

<p>"Sick," groaned Zeke Hunt, apparently in great misery.</p>

<p>"What has made you sick?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; allers was considered delicate."</p>

<p>"How do you feel?"</p>

<p>"<em>Jest as though I wanted to whistle!</em>" was the curious
reply and placing his finger in his mouth, the fellow gave a sound
that would have done credit to an ordinary locomotive.</p>

<p>"If you make that noise again I'll shoot you," said the Rifleman,
now fairly convinced that mischief was intended. Without heeding
his threat, the sick man arose to the upright position, and with
flashing eyes, repeated the sound.</p>

<p>"I gave you warning," said Dernor, raising his gun, pointing
it at his breast, and pulling the trigger. It missed fire!</p>

<p>"I guess you'll have to fix up that load a little," said Zeke
Hunt, "and afore you can do that, you're likely to have visitors."</p>

<p>The Rifleman clubbed his gun and advanced toward the man. The
latter drew his knife, and said:</p>

<p>"Keep off, Lew Dernor; don't you know me?"</p>

<p>"I've been a fool," said the hunter. "Yes, I know you through
your disguise, <em>Simon Girty</em>. I see what you have been
trying to do, but you will never take one of us alive. I hear
the tramp of the coming Indians that he has signaled," he added,
addressing Edith, "and there is not a minute to lose."</p>

<p>So saying, he placed his arm around her waist, and started off
at a rapid run.</p>
