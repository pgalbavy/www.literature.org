Even a hawk has to fly high in order to cross the Deadly Desert,
from which poisonous fumes are constantly rising.  Kiki Aru felt sick
and faint by the time he reached good land again, for he could not
quite escape the effects of the poisons.  But the fresh air soon
restored him and he alighted in a broad table-land which is called
Hiland.  Just beyond it is a valley known as Loland, and these two
countries are ruled by the Gingerbread Man, John Dough, with Chick the
Cherub as his Prime Minister.  The hawk merely stopped here long
enough to rest, and then he flew north and passed over a fine country
called Merryland, which is ruled by a lovely Wax Doll.  Then,
following the curve of the Desert, he turned north and settled on a
tree-top in the Kingdom of Noland.
<P>
Kiki was tired by this time, and the sun was now setting, so he
decided to remain here till morning.  From his tree-top he could see a
house near by, which looked very comfortable.  A man was milking a cow
in the yard and a pleasant-faced woman came to the door and called
him to supper.
<P>
That made Kiki wonder what sort of food hawks ate.  He felt hungry,
but didn't know what to eat or where to get it.  Also he thought a bed
would be more comfortable than a tree-top for sleeping, so he hopped
to the ground and said: "I want to become Kiki Aru again--Pyrzqxgl!"
<P>
Instantly he had resumed his natural shape, and going to the house,
he knocked upon the door and asked for some supper.
<P>
"Who are you?" asked the man of the house.
<P>
"A stranger from the Land of Oz," replied Kiki Aru.
<P>
"Then you are welcome," said the man.
<P>
Kiki was given a good supper and a good bed, and he behaved very
well, although he refused to answer all the questions the good people
of Noland asked him.  Having escaped from his home and found a way to
see the world, the young man was no longer unhappy, and so he was no
longer cross and disagreeable.  The people thought him a very
respectable person and gave him breakfast next morning, after which he
started on his way feeling quite contented.
<P>
Having walked for an hour or two through the pretty country that is
ruled by King Bud, Kiki Aru decided he could travel faster and see
more as a bird, so he transformed himself into a white dove and
visited the great city of Nole and saw the King's palace and gardens
and many other places of interest.  Then he flew westward into the
Kingdom of Ix, and after a day in Queen Zixi's country went on
westward into the Land of Ev.  Every place he visited he thought was
much more pleasant than the saucer-country of the Hyups, and he
decided that when he reached the finest country of all he would settle
there and enjoy his future life to the utmost.
<P>
In the land of Ev he resumed his own shape again, for the cities and
villages were close together and he could easily go on foot from one
to another of them.
<P>
Toward evening he came to a good Inn and asked the inn-keeper if he
could have food and lodging.
<P>
"You can if you have the money to pay," said the man, "otherwise you
must go elsewhere."
<P>
This surprised Kiki, for in the Land of Oz they do not use money at
all, everyone being allowed to take what he wishes without price.  He
had no money, therefore, and so he turned away to seek hospitality
elsewhere.  Looking through an open window into one of the rooms of
the Inn, as he passed along, he saw an old man counting on a table a
big heap of gold pieces, which Kiki thought to be money.  One of these
would buy him supper and a bed, he reflected, so he transformed
himself into a magpie and, flying through the open window, caught up
one of the gold pieces in his beak and flew out again before the old
man could interfere.  Indeed, the old man who was robbed was quite
helpless, for he dared not leave his pile of gold to chase the magpie,
and before he could place the gold in a sack in his pocket the robber
bird was out of sight and to seek it would be folly.
<P>
Kiki Aru flew to a group of trees and, dropping the gold piece to
the ground, resumed his proper shape, and then picked up the money and
put it in his pocket.
<P>
"You'll be sorry for this!" exclaimed a small voice just over his head.
<P>
Kiki looked up and saw that a sparrow, perched upon a branch, was
watching him.
<P>
"Sorry for what?" he demanded.
<P>
"Oh, I saw the whole thing," asserted the sparrow.  "I saw you look
in the window at the gold, and then make yourself into a magpie and
rob the poor man, and then I saw you fly here and make the bird into
your former shape.  That's magic, and magic is wicked and unlawful;
and you stole money, and that's a still greater crime.  You'll be
sorry, some day."
<P>
"I don't care," replied Kiki Aru, scowling.
<P>
"Aren't you afraid to be wicked?" asked the sparrow.
<P>
"No, I didn't know I was being wicked," said Kiki, "but if I was,
I'm glad of it.  I hate good people.  I've always wanted to be wicked,
but I didn't know how."
<P>
"Haw, haw, haw!" laughed someone behind him, in a big voice; "that's
the proper spirit, my lad!  I'm glad I've met you; shake hands."
<P>
The sparrow gave a frightened squeak and flew away.
