The mountain's sides<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are flecked with gleams of light and spots of shade;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, golden sunshine spreads in mellow rays, and there,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretching across its hoary breast, deep shadows lurk.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A stream, with many a turn, now lost to sight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, again revealed, winds through the vale,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shimmering in the early morning sun.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A few white clouds float in the blue expanse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their forms revealed in the clear lake beneath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which bears upon its breast a bark canoe,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cautiously guided by a sinewy arm.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;High in the heavens, three eagles proudly poise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping their mountain eyrie still in view,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although their flight has borne them far away.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the cliff which beetles o'er the pool,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Indians, peering from the brink, appear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clad in the gaudy dress their nature craves&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Robes of bright blue and scarlet, but which blend<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In happy union with the landscape round.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Near by a wigwam stands&mdash;a fire within<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends out a ruddy glow&mdash;and from its roof,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cone-shaped, a spiral wreath of smoke ascends.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, though deeper in the woods,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Another hut, with red-men grouped about,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Attracts the eye, and wakens saddened thoughts<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that brave race who once were masters here,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, like autumn leaves, are dying out.<br/>

<p>"Shtop dat noise! shtop dat noise!" vociferated Hans Vanderbum,
growing red in the face with fury, because his repeated commands
had received so little attention.</p>

<p>The scene was deep in the forests of Ohio, a short distance from
the Miami river.  An Indian town of twenty-five or thirty lodges
here stood, resembling a giant apiary, with its inhabitants flitting
in and out, darting hither and thither, like so many bees.  The
time was early in the morning of a radiant spring, when the atmosphere
was still and charming; the dew lingered upon the grass and undergrowth;
birds were singing in every tree; the sky glowed with the pure
blue of Italy; and the whole wilderness in its bloom looked like
a sea of emerald. Everything was life and exhilaration, one personage
alone excepted &mdash;Hans Vanderbum was unhappy!</p>

<p>The Indian lodges differed very little from each other, being
of a rough, substantial character, built with an eye to comfort
rather than beauty.  One at the extreme northern edge of the village
is that with which our story deals.  A brief description of it
will serve as a general daguerreotype of all those wild abodes.</p>

<p>The wigwam was composed of skins and bark, the latter greatly
predominating.  The shape was that of a cone.  The framework was
of poles, the lower ends of which were placed in a sort of circle,
while the tops were intersected, leaving a small opening, through
which the smoke reached the clear air above.  Unsightly and repulsive
as this might seem from the outside view, the dwelling, nevertheless,
was water-proof and comfortable, and abundantly answered the end
for which it was built.</p>

<p>A thin vapor was ascending in a bluish spiral at the top of the
lodge indicated.  A Shawnee squaw was occupied in preparing the
morning meal, while her liege lord still reclined in one corner,
in the vain effort to secure a few minutes more of slumber.  This
latter personage was Hans Vanderbum&mdash;our friend Hans&mdash;a huge,
plethoric, stolid, lazy Dutchman, who had "married" an Indian
widow several years before.  At the time of her marriage this
squaw had a boy some three or four years of age, while a second
one, the son of the Dutchman, was now just large enough to be
as mischievous as a kitten.  They were a couple of greasy, copper-hued
little rascals, with eyes as black as midnight, and long, wiry
hair, like that of a horse's mane.  Brimful of animal spirits,
they were just the reverse of Hans Vanderbum, whose laziness and
stupidity were only excelled by his indifference to the dignity
and rights of human nature.</p>

<p>Hans Vanderbum lay fiat upon his back, for the atmosphere of
the wigwam was too warm for covering, his ponderous belly rising
and falling like a wave of the sea, and his throat giving forth
that peculiar rattling of the glottis, which might be mistaken
for suffocation.  The boys certainly would have been outside,
basking in the genial sunshine, had not their mother, Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock,
positively denied them that coveted privilege.  The commands of
the father might be trampled upon with impunity, but the young
half-breeds knew better than to disobey their mother.</p>

<p>"Shtop dat noise! shtop dat noise!" repeated Hans, raising his
head without stirring his body or limbs.</p>

<p>His broad face seemed all ablaze from its fiery red color, and
the threatening fury throned upon his lowering forehead would
almost have annihilated him who encountered it for the first time. 
As it was, the two boys suddenly straightened their faces, and
assumed an air of meek penitence, as if suffering the most harrowing
remorse for what they had done; and the father, after glaring
at them a moment, as if to drive in and clinch the impression
he had made, let his head drop back with a dull thump upon the
ground, and again closed his eyes.</p>

<p>The black, snaky orbs of the boys twinkled like stars through
their overhanging hair.  Glancing first at their mother, who did
not deign to notice them, the eldest picked up his younger brother,
who was grinning from ear to ear with delight, and, summoning
all his strength, he poised him over the prostrate form of his
father for a moment, and then dropped him!  The prolonged snore
which was steadily issuing from the throat of the sleeping parent,
terminated in a sharp, explosive grunt. As his eyes opened, the
boys scrambled away like frogs to the opposite side of the lodge,
under the protecting care of their mother.</p>

<p>"Dunder and blixen!  You dunderin' Dutch Indians, dishturbin'
your poor old dad dat is wearing his life out for you!  I'll pound
both of you till you're dead!"</p>

<p>Hans Vanderbum's system had suffered too great a shock for further
slumber.  He rose to the sitting position, and, digging both hands
into his head, glared at his offspring a moment, and then began
his regular lecture.</p>

<p>"Quanonshet, you little Dutchman, and Madokawandock, you little
bigger Dutchman, vot does you t'ink of yourselves?  Vot does you
t'ink will become of you, disgracing your parents in this manner? 
You oughter be pounded to death to treat your poor old fader in
this manner, who is working of himself away to bring you up in
the way you ought for to go. Eh? vot do you t'ink of yourself,
eh?  Vot do you t'ink of yourself?" demanded Hans, furiously shaking
his head toward the boys at each word.</p>

<p>Quanonshet and Madokawandock were too confounded for reply.</p>

<p>"Shposing your poor old fader should go crazy!!  Here he is working
himself to skin and bone &mdash;Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock,
ain't you got dat cooked?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock, ain't you got
dat cooked?"]</p>

<p>"No!" screamed the wife.  "You big, lazy man, get up and stir
yourself! You don't do anything but sleep and smoke, while <em>I'm</em>
working all the flesh off <em>my</em> bones for you!"</p>

<p>These forcible remarks were made in the pure Shawnee tongue,
and were accompanied by gesticulation too pointed and significant
for Hans to mistake the spirit in which they were given.  Although
it is the invariable custom among the North American Indians for
the husband to rule the wife, and impose all burdens upon her,
except those of the hunt, and fight, such, by no means, was the
case with the present couple.  Hans Vanderbum's body was too unwieldy
for him to accompany the young men (or even the old men) upon
their hunting expeditions; in short, he contributed nothing toward
the support of his interesting family.  The first husband of Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock
had been an Indian, with all the characteristics of his race&mdash;indolent,
selfish and savage; and her life with him had been that of the
usual servitude and drudgery.  Accordingly, when she ventured
a second time upon the sea of matrimony, she naturally fell into
the same routine of labor, planting and cultivating what little
corn, beans and vegetables were raised for the family, and doing
all the really hard work.  Hans Vanderbum sometimes gathered firewood,
and frequently, when the weather was pleasant, spent hours in
fishing.  He was an inveterate smoker and sleeper; and, beyond
doubt, was perfectly content in his situation. Having been taken
a prisoner some years before, and adopted into this branch of
the Shawnee tribe, he was offered the hand of Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock
in marriage, and accepted it at once, totally forgetful of his
first love, which had been the beautiful inmate of the Hunter's
Cabin.</p>

<p>Hans Vanderbum sat and gazed at his wife with an admiring eye,
as she busied herself with the preparations of the morning meal. 
Hoping to mollify her, he commenced flattering her, speaking in
a low tone as if it were not his wish that she should hear him,
but taking good care, at the same time, that nothing should escape
her ears.</p>

<p>"Shplendid figger, Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock has got.  No
wonder all te braves of te Shawnee tribe should love her, and
dat Hans Vanderbum gots her at last.  Jis' look at <em>dat</em>
foot! long and flat like a board, and she's de same shape all
de way down from her head to her heels.  Ishn't dat breakfast
ready, my dear wife?"</p>

<p>The wife gave a spiteful nod, and Hans Vanderbum shambled up
beside her, where the food, consisting of meat and a few simple
vegetables, was spread upon a rude table which had no legs.  Quanonshet
and Madokawandock were not behind-hand in their movements, and
the whole four fell to with such voracity, that, in a very short
time, their hunger was satisfied.</p>

<p>"Now, you two fellers come out doors and learn your lessons,"
said the father, lighting his pipe, and putting on a very stern
and dignified look.</p>

<p>The boys tumbled over each other in their eagerness to get into
the open air.  Hans followed them, while Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock
busied herself about her household duties.  Quanonshet and Madokawandock
rollicked and frisked awhile before they were "called to order." 
After repeated commands, they approached their father, and standing
side by side, awaited his instructions.</p>

<p>Hans Vanderbum had provided himself with a long pole, and stood
by a sandy portion of ground, upon which he had no difficulty
in tracing what letters and characters he wished.  With due preparation
and importance he marked out the first letter of the German alphabet,
and then, straightening himself up, demanded in a thundering tone
"vot dat was."  His two sons looked mute and dumbfounded.  They
had not the remotest idea in the world of its name and significance. 
For over three months the patient father had instructed them daily
in regard to this character, and the two together must have repeated
it several thousand times.  But, it mattered not; neither had
any conception now of it, and their looks showed such unmistakably
to their instructor.</p>

<p>"Dunder and blixen, vot Dutch Indians!" he exclaimed, impatiently.
Repeating its name, he again demanded "vot dat was."  This time
they answered readily, and his eyes sparkled with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Shmart boys," said he, approvingly.  "You learns well, now. 
One dese days&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hans Vanderbum's words were cut short by the sudden sharp explosion
of his pipe, the bowl being shattered in a hundred pieces, while
nothing but the stem remained in his mouth.</p>

<p>"Where's mine pipe?" he asked, looking around in the vain hope
of descrying it somewhere upon the ground.  Quanonshet and Madokawandock
indulged in one short scream of laughter, then instantly straightened
their faces and looked as meek and innocent as lambs.  Gradually
the truth began to work its way into the head of Hans.  Looking
sternly at the two, he asked, in a threatening voice:</p>

<p>"Which of you put dat powder in mine meerschaum, eh? which of
you done dat, eh?"</p>

<p>Neither answered, except by hanging their heads and looking at
their bare feet.</p>

<p>"I axes you once more, and dis is de last time."</p>

<p>Each now protested that it was not himself but the other, so
that if there really were but one culprit, Hans had no means of
determining. Under the circumstances, he concluded the safest
plan was to believe both guilty.  Accordingly he made a sudden
dash and commenced whacking them soundly with the stick he held
in his hand.  They yelled, kicked, and screamed; and squirming
themselves loose, scampered quickly away from their irate instructor.</p>

<p>"Dat meerschaum can't be fixed," he soliloquized, taking the
bare stem out of his mouth and looking sorrowfully at it.  "'Cause
dere ishn't anything to fix it mit.  It ish wonderful what mischief
gets into dem boys; dere ain't no time when dey ain't doin' notting
what dey hadn't not ought to&mdash;all de times just de same way, while
I toils myself to death to educate dem and bring 'em up in de
way apout which dey ought to go."</p>

<p>Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock being in the habit of frequently
indulging in the use of tobacco, her husband was not deprived
entirely of his solace.  Going into the wigwam, he unbosomed his
griefs to her, and she kindly loaned him her own pipe.</p>

<p>"I hopes dere ain't no powder in dat," he remarked, glancing
uneasily into the bowl.</p>

<p>"Nothing but tobac," replied his spouse, in her native tongue,
"unless you've put the powder in yourself."</p>

<p>"Dunderation, I don't does dat, and blow mine eyes out my head. 
Dem little Dutchmen is up to all kinds of such tricks, and some
dese days dey will blow deir poor fader's brains out of his head,
and den what will become of dem?" feelingly inquired Hans Vanderbum.</p>

<p>"What will become of them?" repeated Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock,
her voice rising higher and higher at each word.  "Who is it that
supports them now and takes care of them?  Who is it that does
that?  Who is it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's you&mdash;it's you," replied her husband, seeing the mistake
he had made.  "I doesn't do nottings &mdash;I doesn't do nottings;
it's my wife, my good Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock, dat does
it all.  She's a very nice squaw, de same shape all de way down."</p>

<p>These concessions and compliments greatly soothed the feelings
of the incensed spouse.  She scolded her husband no more.</p>

<p>"What you going to do, my dear frau?" he asked, in a voice as
cooing and winning as a dove's.</p>

<p>"Going to work, to plant the corn, to get food for you and Quanonshet
and Madokawandock when the snow falls."</p>

<p>"Very kind, clever woman; good frau is mine Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock."</p>

<p>"What are <em>you</em> going to do?" asked the wife, as the two
passed out the wigwam.</p>

<p>"Going to shmoke and <em>meditate</em>&mdash;meditate <em>hard</em>,"
replied Hans Vanderbum, impressively.</p>

<p>"Can't you think as well while you're <em>fishing</em>?"</p>

<p>"I shpose I can; if my Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock t'inks so,
I can."</p>

<p>"Well, she thinks so."</p>

<p>The fact that his wife "thought so" was equivalent to a command
with Hans.  He manifested no unwillingness or reluctance in obeying.
Accordingly, he furnished himself with a hook, line and bait,
and set out for the river.</p>

<p>It was now getting well along in the forenoon, the sun being
above the tree-tops.  The Shawnee Indians had left their wigwams
to engage in their daily avocations.  The women were mostly toiling
in the field, their pappooses hanging from the trees or leaning
against their trunks. The older children were frolicking through
the woods, or fishing or hunting.  A few warriors and old men
still lounged about the wigwams, but the majority either were
engaged in the hunt, or were upon the war-trail.</p>

<p>Stolid and indifferent as was the nature of Hans, it struck him
that there was something unusual in the appearance and actions
of the Indians.  It seemed as though some startling event had
occurred from which they had not fully recovered.  They were uneasy
and restless in their movements, constantly passing to and from
the river.  Upon reaching the banks of the latter, the Dutchman
found a considerable number already there.  They were not engaged
in fishing, but lay close to the edge of the water, as if they
expected the appearance of something upon its surface.  Had he
been a little more observant, there was something else which would
have attracted his attention, on his passage through the woods. 
Fully a dozen times a peculiar sound, like the whistle of a bird,
reached his ears, and he supposed it to be nothing more, although
it did seem odd to him that the bird should follow him almost
to the river bank.  Besides this, he caught a flitting glimpse
of an Indian now and then, some distance in the woods, that appeared
to be watching him; but Hans did not care, even if such were the
case, and he paid no further heed to him.</p>

<p>Reaching the river, he made his preparations with great care
and elaboration.  He had several hooks pendent from his line,
upon each of which he shoved the wriggling worms, spitting upon
them during the operation, as if to make them more tractable. 
To the line also was fastened a pebble, to make it sink.  Swinging
this several times around his head, he let go, when it spun far
out in the river, and he commenced cautiously following it by
means of a projecting tree-trunk. This latter extended a dozen
feet out over the surface of the water, and had been used as a
seat a great many times by him.  Passing out to the extremity,
he was afforded a comfortable resting-place where he could sit
hour after hour smoking his pipe and engage in fishing.  Had he
noticed the large branch of the tree upon which he seated himself,
he would have hesitated before trusting the weight of his body
upon it, but his nature was too unsuspicious to be attracted by
anything trivial in its appearance, and he made his way out upon
it, as he had done scores of times before.</p>

<p>Ensconcing himself in his seat, he gave his whole attention to
his line and his pipe, not noticing the interested glances which
the Shawnees along the bank bestowed upon his operations.  After
the space of a few minutes, he felt something pull at his line,
and doing the same, he hauled a fine plump fish out of the water,
casting it upon the land.</p>

<p>"Dat is purty goot," he mused, "and I will soon got a lot more,
and my Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock will feel goot too, when
I takes 'em home.  She won't&mdash;  Dunder and Blixen!"</p>

<p>The limb upon which he was seated suddenly broke short off, and
Hans dropped into the river out of sight.  But such a ponderous
body as his could not sink, and upon coming to the surface, he
paddled hurriedly to the shore.</p>

<p>"Dem little Dutchmen, Quanonshet and Madokawandock, will be de
death of deir old fader afore long.  Dat is deir work.  I knows
it, I knows it, and I will pound 'em all up when I gits home."</p>

<p>Looking about his person, he found that one of the hooks, catching
in his clothes, had brought the line to shore; and, as his involuntary
bath had not really been unpleasant, he was able to continue his
labor. But, before going out upon the tree he examined the roots
to satisfy himself that no further mischief had been perpetrated
by his hopeful sons.  Feeling assured upon this point, he again
passed out on the tree, and was soon engaged in fishing as before,
totally unmindful of the broad grins of the delighted Shawnees
who had witnessed his discomfiture.</p>

<p>The fish bit readily.  In a short time he had taken enough to
insure him a welcome reception in his own wigwam.  He was debating
with himself whether it would not be better to return, especially
as his pipe had been extinguished by his immersion, when a piece
of bark floated down toward him and caught against his line.</p>

<p>There certainly was nothing remarkable in this.  After freeing
it of the obstruction, he continued fishing.  But, scarcely a
minute had elapsed before a second and a third piece of bark,
precisely like the first, lodged against his line, and remained
there with such persistency that it required considerable effort
upon his part to remove them.</p>

<p>"Where in dunderation did dey come from?" he asked, looking inquiringly
about him.  His first impression was that the Shawnees along the
banks were throwing these pieces out into the river for the purpose
of annoying him; but, on looking toward them, he could discover
nothing in their appearance to warrant such a supposition.  He
turned elsewhere for the cause.  Resuming his attention to his
line, he found several other pieces passing beneath him, and he
began now to feel really provoked at this repeated annoyance. 
He was about to break out into some exclamation, when the appearance
of these floating objects arrested his attention.  A glance showed
him there was something meant more than mere mischief.  The pieces
of bark were of a peculiar construction, roughly cut into the
shape of an Indian canoe, showing unmistakably that they were
sent down the stream for the purpose of arresting his notice.</p>

<p>"Dat means something," exclaimed Hans, decidedly, "and I must
find out what it is."</p>

<p>By simply looking up-stream, he could discern this fleet of miniature
boats coming down toward him in a straight line.  In the clear
sunlight they were visible for a great distance, and it was no
difficult matter to determine their starting point.  Some two
hundred yards above, another tree projected out over the water
very much the same as that upon which Hans was seated, so similar
in fact that he had often used it for the same purpose.  As the
line of the pieces of bark pointed directly toward these, there
was but little doubt that here they were launched upon the water.</p>

<p>"It can't be dat Quanonshet and Madokawandock is dere," mused
Hans Vanderbum, "for to try to worry deir poor old fader.  Dey're
too big Dutchmen to build such boats, and dey wouldn't know how
to make 'em float under me if dey did.  No; dere's somebody out
on dat tree, and he's doing it to make me look up at him.  I'm
looking but I can't see notting."</p>

<p>He shaded his eyes as he spoke, and looked long and searchingly
at the tree, but for a considerable time could discover nothing
unusual about it.  At length, however, he fancied that he saw
one of the limbs sway gently backward and forward in a manner
that could hardly be caused by the wind.  Gradually it began to
dawn upon him that if there was any person upon the tree, he meant
that his presence should not be suspected by the Shawnees along
the bank.  Accordingly Hans Vanderbum was more circumspect in
his observations.</p>

<p>Still watching the tree, he soon discovered something else that
he thought was meant to attract his eye.  The water directly beneath
it flashed and sparkled as if it was disturbed by some object. 
Straining his gaze, he finally discerned what appeared to be a
human hand swaying backward and forward.</p>

<p>"Dat is enough!" thought Hans Vanderbum.  "Dere's somebody dere
dat wants to see me, and is afeard of dese oder chaps about, so
I goes to him."</p>

<p>Working his way cautiously backward, he reached the land and
started apparently to return to his wigwam.  As he did so, he
looked at the Shawnees and was gratified to see that their suspicions
had not been aroused by his movements.  Proceeding some distance,
he hid his fish and line and made his way up the river, escaping
the Shawnees by means of a long <em>détour</em>.</p>

<p>Reaching the stream and tree, he was somewhat taken aback by
not finding any one at all.  Considerably perplexed, he looked
about him.</p>

<p>"Can't be dat Quanonshet and Madokawandock have been fooling
deir poor old fader again," said he.  "I'm purty sure I seen some
one on the tree, when dem pieces of bark come swimming downstream."</p>

<p>A subdued whistle reached his ear.  Looking behind him, he saw
a Huron Indian standing a few yards away.  The eyes of both lit
up as they encountered the gaze of each other, for they were both
friends and old acquaintances.</p>

<p>"Ish dat you, Oonomoo?" inquired Hans Vanderbum.</p>

<p>"Yeh&mdash;me &mdash;Oonomoo," replied the Indian, pronouncing his
name somewhat differently from the Dutchman, (and from that by
which we have before referred to him).</p>

<p>"Was dat you on de tree out dere?"</p>

<p>"Yeh, me &mdash;Oonomoo out dere on log."</p>

<p>"And did you make dem pieces of bark to come swimming down by
me?"</p>

<p>"Yeh, me made 'em."</p>

<p>"And shtirred de water wid yer hand and moved de limb?"</p>

<p>"Yeh, Oonomoo do all dat."</p>

<p>"I shpose you wanted to see me?"</p>

<p>"Yeh, wanted to see you&mdash;want talk wid you," said the Huron,
motioning for Hans to follow him.  The latter did not hesitate
to do so, as he had perfect faith in his honesty, knowing much
of his history.  The savage led the way some distance into the
woods, where they were not likely to be seen or overheard, and
then stopped and confronted his companion.</p>

<p>"Where'd you come from, Oonomoo?" asked the latter.</p>

<p>"From fightin' de Shawnees," replied the savage, proudly.</p>

<p>"Yaw, I sees yer am in de war-paint.  Did you get many?"</p>

<p>"The lodge of Oonomoo is full of the scalps of the cowardly Shawnees,
taken many moons ago," answered the Huron, his eyes flashing fire
and his breast heaving at the remembrance of his exploits.  This
reply was made in the Shawnee language, as he spoke it as well
as one of their warriors; and, as Hans also understood it, the
conversation was now carried on in that tongue.</p>

<p>"When did you see Annie Stanton last?" inquired the Dutchman,
showing considerable interest.</p>

<p>"Several moons ago, when the sun was in the woods and the waters
were asleep."</p>

<p>"Is her husband, that rascally Ferrington, living?"</p>

<p>Oonomoo replied that he was.</p>

<p>"And is their baby, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they have two pappooses."</p>

<p>"Dunder and blixen!" exclaimed Hans Vanderbum, and then resuming
the English language, or rather his version of it, he added:</p>

<p>"Dat gal wanted to marry mit me once."</p>

<p>"Why no marry den?" inquired Oonomoo, also coming back to the
more difficult language.</p>

<p>"She wan't te right kind of a gal&mdash;she wan't like my Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock,
dat is de same shape all de way down from her head to her heels. 
So I let dat Ferrington have her."</p>

<p>The Huron, who understood all about that matter, indulged in
a broad smile at this remark.  Whatever his business was, it was
manifest he was in no hurry, else he would not have indulged in
this by-play of words with his friend.</p>

<p>"You doesn't t'ink de baby will dies, does you?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;in de settlement &mdash;Shawnee can't git her now&mdash;don't
live off in de woods like as dey did afore."</p>

<p>"Dat's lucky for her; don't t'ink dey will get her there, 'cause
dey tried it once&mdash;dat time, you remember, when we was all in
de <em>HUNTER'S CABIN </em>in de woods, and you came down de chimney,
and I watched and kept de Shawnee off."</p>

<p>The Huron signified that he remembered the circumstance well.</p>

<p>"Dem was great times," added Hans Vanderbum, calling up the recollection
of them.  "I left de village one hot afternoon, and walked all
de way t'rough de woods to get to de cabin to help dem poor folks.
We had mighty hard times.  I catched a cold and couldn't shtop
my dunderin' nose one night when it wanted to shneeze, and dat's
de way de Shawnee catched me.  Twan't so bad arter all," added
Hans Vanderbum, musingly, "'cause if it wasn't for dat I wouldn't
got my Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock."</p>

<p>"How soon go back?" asked Oonomoo.</p>

<p>"To de village, do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yeh."</p>

<p>"Any time afore noon will does, so Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock
gits de fish for our dinner."</p>

<p>"One, two hours," said the Huron, looking up at the sky, "den
sun git dere," pointing to the zenith.  "Shawnees know here?"</p>

<p>"Know me here?  Guesses not; don't care if dey does, nor dey
doesn't care neider."</p>

<p>"Shawnees won't come here?"</p>

<p>"No, no, Oonomoo, you needn't be afraid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Afraid who?" demanded the Huron, with quick fierceness.  "Oonomoo
never run afore one&mdash;two&mdash;t'ree&mdash;dozen Shawnees.  He only runs
when dey comes like de leaves in de woods."</p>

<p>"Dey won't come like de leaves.  If dey does, why you can leave
too, and I t'inks you know how to use dem legs dat you've got
tacked onto you.  I t'inks you run as fast as me."</p>

<p>"So I t'inks," replied the Indian, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Dere's no mistake but dem Shawnees would like to get your scalp,
Oonomoo."</p>

<p>"Two&mdash;t'ree&mdash;hundreds&mdash;all Shawnees like to git Oonomoo's scalp&mdash;nebber
git him &mdash;Oonomee die in his lodge&mdash;scalp on his head," said
the Huron, proudly.</p>

<p>"I hopes so; hopes I will, too."</p>

<p>The expression of the Indian's face was changed.  It assumed
a dark, earnest appearance.  He was done trifling, and wished
to commence business.</p>

<p>"See her dis mornin'?" he asked, in short, quick tones.</p>

<p>"See who?" asked Hans Vanderbum, in turn, completely at a loss
to understand him.</p>

<p>"De gal."</p>

<p>"De gal?  Who you talking about &mdash;Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock?"</p>

<p>"De gal Shawnees got in de village."</p>

<p>The Dutchman's blank expression showed that he did not comprehend
what the Huron was referring to; so he added, by way of explanation:</p>

<p>"Shawnees kill women and children&mdash;deir warriors squaws&mdash;don't
fight men&mdash;burn houses toder day&mdash;run off wid gal&mdash;got her now
in de village&mdash;she gal of Oonomoo's friend &mdash;Oonomoo want
to get her."</p>

<p>From these rather disconnected expressions, Hans Vanderbum understood
that a war-party of Shawnees had brought in a prisoner who was
a friend of the Huron's.  It was for the purpose of learning something
regarding her that he had signaled the fisherman to leave his
hook and line and come to him.  The captive having reached the
village quite recently, he had failed to be apprised of it, so
that Oonomoo learned no more than he already knew regarding her.</p>

<p>"When did dey took her?" asked Hans Vanderbum.</p>

<p>"When sun dere, yisterday," replied the Indian, pointing off
in the western horizon.</p>

<p>"Do you want to know 'bout her?"</p>

<p>"Yeh."</p>

<p>"Den I goes find out."</p>

<p>So saying, Hans Vanderbum strode away through the forest in the
direction of the Shawnee village.</p>
