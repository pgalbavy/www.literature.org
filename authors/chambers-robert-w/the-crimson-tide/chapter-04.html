<p>There remained, now, nothing to keep Palla in Shadow Hill.</p>

<p>She had never intended to stay there, anyway; she had meant to
go to France.</p>

<p>But already there appeared to be no chance for that in the scheme
of things. For the boche had begun to squeal for mercy; the frightened
swine was squirting life-blood as he rushed headlong for the home
sty across the Rhine; his death-stench sickened the world.</p>

<p>Thicker, ranker, reeked the bloody abomination in the nostrils
of civilisation, where Justice strode ahead through hell's own
devastation, kicking the boche to death, kicking him through Belgium,
through France, out of Light back into Darkness, back, back to
his stinking sty.</p>

<p>The rushing sequence of events in Europe since Palla's arrival
in America bewildered the girl and held in abeyance any plan she
had hoped to make.</p>

<p>The whole world waited, too, astounded, incredulous as yet of
the cataclysmic debacle, slowly realising that the super-swine
were but swine&mdash;maddened swine, devil driven. And that the Sea
was very near.</p>

<p>No romance ever written approached in wild extravagance the story
of doom now unfolding in the daily papers.</p>

<p>Palla read and strove to comprehend&mdash;read, laid aside her paper,
and went about her own business, which alone seemed dully real.</p>

<p>And these new personal responsibilities&mdash;now that her aunt was
dead&mdash;must have postponed any hope of an immediate departure for
France.</p>

<p>Her inheritance under her aunt's will, the legal details, the
inventory of scattered acreage and real estate, plans for their
proper administration, consultations with an attorney, conferences
with Mr. Pawling, president of the local bank&mdash;such things had
occupied and involved her almost from the moment of her arrival
home.</p>

<p>At first the endless petty details exasperated her&mdash;a girl fresh
from the tremendous tragedy of things where, one after another,
empires were crashing amid the conflagration of a continent. And
she could not now keep her mind on such wretched little personal
matters while her heart battered passionately at her breast, sounding
the exciting summons to active service.</p>

<p>To concentrate her thoughts on mortgages and deeds when she was
burning to be on her way to France&mdash;to confer power of attorney,
audit bills for taxes, for up-keep of line fences, when she was
mad to go to New York and find out how quickly she could be sent
to France&mdash;such things seemed more than a girl could endure.</p>

<p>In Shadow Hill there was scarcely anything to remind her that
the fate of the world was being settled for all time.</p>

<p>Only for red service flags here and there, here and there a burly
figure in olive-drab swaggering along Main Street, nothing except
war-bread, the shortage of coal and sugar, and outrageous prices
reminded her that the terrific drama was still being played beyond
the ocean to the diapason of an orchestra thundering from England
to Asia and from Africa to the Arctic.</p>

<p>But already the eternal signs were pointing to the end. She read
the <em>Republican</em> in the morning, the <em>Star</em> at night.
Gradually it became apparent to the girl that the great conflagration
was slowly dying down beyond the seas; that there was to be no
chance of her returning; that there was to be no need of her services
even if she were already equipped to render any, and now, certainly,
no time for her to learn anything which might once have admitted
her to comradeship in the gigantic conflict between man and Satan.
She was too late. The world's tragedy was almost over.</p>

<p>With the signing of the armistice, all dreams of service ended
definitely for her.</p>

<p>False news of the suspension of hostilities should have, in a
measure, prepared her. Yet, the ultimately truthful news that
the war was over made her almost physically ill. For the girl's
ardent religious fervour had consumed her emotional energy during
the incessant excitement of the past three years. But now, for
this natural ardour, there was no further employment. There was
no outlet for mind or heart so lately on fire with spiritual fervour.
God was no more; her friend was dead. And now the war had ended.
And nobody in the world had any need of her&mdash;any need of this
woman who needed the world&mdash;and love&mdash;spiritual perhaps, perhaps
profane.</p>

<p>The false peace demonstration, which set the bells of Shadow
Hill clanging in the wintry air and the mill whistles blowing
from distant villages, left her tired, dazed, indifferent. The
later celebration, based on official news, stirred her spiritually
even less. And she felt ill.</p>

<p>There was a noisy night celebration on Main Street, but she had
no desire to see it. She remained indoors reading the <em>Star</em>
in the sitting room with Max, the cat. She ate no dinner. She
cried herself to sleep.</p>

<p>However, now that the worst had come&mdash;as she na√Øvely informed
the shocked Martha next morning&mdash;she began to feel relieved in
a restless, feverish way.</p>

<p>A healthful girl accumulates much bodily energy over night; Palla's
passionate little heart and her active mind completed a storage
battery very quickly charged&mdash;and very soon over-charged&mdash;and
an outlet was imperative.</p>

<p>Always, so far in her brief career, she had had adequate outlets.
As a child she found satisfaction in violent exercises; in flinging
herself headlong into every outdoor game, every diversion among
the urchins of her circle. As a school girl her school sports
and her studies, and whatever social pleasures were offered, had
left the safety valve open.</p>

<p>Later, mistress of her mother's modest fortune, and grown to
restless, intelligent womanhood, Palla had gone abroad with a
married school-friend, Leila Vance. Under her auspices she had
met nice people and had seen charming homes in England &mdash;Colonel
Vance being somebody in the county and even somebody in London&mdash;a
diffident, reticent, agriculturally inclined land owner and colonel
of yeomanry. And long ago dead in Flanders. And his wife a nurse
somewhere in France.</p>

<p>But before the war a year's travel and study had furnished the
necessary outlet to Palla Dumont. And then&mdash;at a charity bazaar&mdash;a
passionate friendship had flashed into sacred flame&mdash;a friendship
born at sight between her and the little Grand Duchess Marie.</p>

<p>War was beginning; Colonel Vance was dead; but imperial inquiry
located Leila. And imperial inquiry was satisfied. And Palla became
the American companion and friend of the youthful Grand Duchess
Marie. For three years that blind devotion had been her outlet&mdash;that
and their mutual inclination for a life to be dedicated to God.</p>

<p>What was to be her outlet now?&mdash;now that the little Grand Duchess
was dead&mdash;now that God, as she had conceived him, had ceased to
exist for her&mdash;now that the war was ended, and nobody needed that
warm young heart of hers&mdash;that ardent little heart so easily set
throbbing with the passionate desire to give.</p>

<p>The wintry sunlight flooded the familiar sitting room, setting
potted geraniums ablaze, gilding the leather backs of old books,
staining prisms on the crystal chandelier with rainbow tints,
and causing Max, the family cat, to blink until the vertical pupils
of his amber eyes seemed to disappear entirely.</p>

<p>There was some snow outside&mdash;not very much&mdash;a wild bird or two
among the naked apple trees; green edges, still, where snowy lawn
and flower border met.</p>

<p>And there was colour in the leafless shrubbery, too&mdash;wine-red
stems of dogwood, ash-blue berry-canes, and the tangled green
and gold of willows. And over all a pale cobalt sky, and a snow-covered
hill, where, in the woods, crows sat cawing on the taller trees,
and a slow goshawk sailed.</p>

<p>A rich land, this, even under ice and snow&mdash;a rich, rolling land
hinting of fat furrows and heavy grain; and of spicy, old-time
gardens where the evenings were heavy with the scent of phlox
and lilies.</p>

<p>Palla, her hands behind her back, seeming very childish and slim
in her black gown, stood searching absently among the books for
something to distract her&mdash;something in harmony with the restless
glow of hidden fires hot in her restless heart.</p>

<p>But war is too completely the great destroyer, killing even the
serener pleasures of the mind, corrupting normal appetite, dulling
all interest except in what pertains to war.</p>

<p>War is the great vandal, too, obliterating even that interest
in the classic past which is born of respect for tradition. War
slays all yesterdays, so that human interest lives only in the
fierce and present moment, or blazes anew at thought of what may
be to-morrow.</p>

<p>Only the chronicles of the burning hour can hold human attention
where war is. For last week is already a decade ago; and last
year a dead century; but to-day is vital and to-morrow is immortal.</p>

<p>It was so with Palla. Her listless eyes swept the ranks of handsome,
old-time books&mdash;old favourites bound in gold and leather, masters
of English prose and poetry gathered and garnered by her grand-parents
when books were rare in Shadow Hill.</p>

<p>Not even the modern masters appealed to her&mdash;masters of fiction
acclaimed but yesterday; virile thinkers in philosophy, in science;
enfranchised poets who had stridden out upon Olympus only yesterday
to defy the old god's lightning with unshackled strophes&mdash;and
sometimes unbuttoned themes.</p>

<p>But it was with Palla as with others; she drifted back to the
morning paper, wherein lay the interest of the hour. And nothing
else interested her or the world.</p>

<p>Martha announced lunch. Max accompanied her on her retreat to
the kitchen. Palla loitered, not hungry, nervous and unquiet under
the increasing need of occupation for that hot heart of hers.</p>

<p>After a while she went out to the dining room, ate enough, endured
Martha to the verge, and retreated to await the evening paper.</p>

<p>Her attorney, Mr. Tiddley, came at three. They discussed quit-claims,
mortgages, deeds, surveys, and reported encroachments incident
to the decay of ancient landmarks. And the conversation maddened
her.</p>

<p>At four she put on a smart mourning hat and her black furs, and
walked down to see the bank president, Mr. Pawling. The subject
of their conversation was investments; and it bored her. At five
she returned to the house to receive a certain Mr. Skidder&mdash;known
in her childhood as Blinky Skidder, in frank recognition of an
ocular peculiarity&mdash;a dingy but jaunty young man with a sheep's
nose, a shrewd upper lip, and snapping red-brown eyes, who came
breezily in and said: "Hello, Palla! How's the girl?" And took
off his faded mackinaw uninvited.</p>

<p>Mr. Skidder's business had once been the exploitation of farmers
and acreage; his specialty the persuasion of Slovak emigrants
into the acquisition of doubtful land. But since the war, emigrants
were few; and, as honest men must live, Mr. Skidder had branched
out into improved real estate and city lots. But the pickings,
even here, were scanty, and loans hard to obtain.</p>

<p>"I've changed my mind," said Palla. "I'm not going to sell this
house, Blinky."</p>

<p>"Well, for heaven's sake&mdash;ain't you going to New York?" he insisted,
taken aback.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. But I've decided to keep my house."</p>

<p>"That," said Mr. Skidder, snapping his eyes, "is silly sentiment,
not business. But please yourself Palla. I ain't saying a word.
I ain't trying to tell you I can get a lot more for you than your
house is worth&mdash;what with values falling and houses empty and
the mills letting men go because there ain't going to be any more
war orders!&mdash;but please yourself, Palla. I ain't saying a word
to urge you."</p>

<p>"You've said several," she remarked, smilingly. "But I think
I'll keep the house for the present, and I'm sorry that I wasted
your time."</p>

<p>"Please yourself, Palla," he repeated. "I guess you can afford
to from all I hear. I guess you can do as you've a mind to, now....
So you're fixing to locate in New York, eh?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"Live in a flat?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do in New York?" he asked curiously.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know. There'll be plenty to do, I suppose."</p>

<p>"You bet," he said, blinking rapidly, "there's always something
doing in that little old town." He slapped his knee: "Palla,"
he said, "I'm thinking of going into the movie business."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm considering it. Slovaks and bum farms are played out.
There's no money in Shadow Hill&mdash;or if there is, it's locked up&mdash;or
the income tax has paralysed it. No, I'm through. There's nothing
doing in land; no commissions. And I'm considering a quick getaway."</p>

<p>"Where do you expect to go?"</p>

<p>"Say, Palla, when you kiss your old home good-bye, there's only
one place to go. Get me?"</p>

<p>"New York?" she inquired, amused.</p>

<p>"That's me! There's a guy down there I used to correspond with&mdash;a
feller named Puma &mdash;Angelo Puma&mdash;not a regular wop, as you
might say, but there's some wop in him, judging by his map&mdash;or
Mex&mdash;or kike, maybe&mdash;or something. Anyway, he's in the moving
picture business &mdash;The Ultra-Fillum Company. I guess there's
a mint o' money in fillums."</p>

<p>She nodded, a trifle bored.</p>

<p>"I got a chance to go in with Angelo Puma," he said, snapping
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"You know, Palla, I've made a little money, too, since you been
over there living with the Queen of Russia."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad, Blinky."</p>

<p>"Oh, it ain't much. And," he added shrewdly, "it ain't so paltry,
neither. Thank the Lord, I made hay while the Slovaks lasted....
So," he added, getting up from his chair, "maybe I'll see you
down there in New York, some day&#11834;"</p>

<p>He hesitated, his blinking eyes redly intent on her as she rose
to her slim height.</p>

<p>"Say, Palla."</p>

<p>She looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Ever thought of the movies?"</p>

<p>"As an investment?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;that, too. There's big money in it. But I meant &mdash;I
mean&mdash;it strikes me you'd make a bird of a movie queen."</p>

<p>The suggestion mildly amused her.</p>

<p>"I mean it," he insisted. "Grab it from me, Palla, you've got
the shape, and you got the looks and you got the walk and the
ways and the education. You got something peculiar&mdash;like you had
been born a rich swell &mdash;I mean you kinda naturally act that
way&mdash;kinda cocksure of yourself. Maybe you got it living with
that Queen&#11834;"</p>

<p>Palla laughed outright.</p>

<p>"So you think because I've seen a queen I ought to know how to
act like a movie queen?"</p>

<p>"Well," he said, picking up his hat, "maybe if I go in with Angelo
Puma some day I'll see you again and we'll talk it over."</p>

<p>She shook hands with him.</p>

<p>"Be good," he called back as she closed the front door behind
him.</p>

<p>The early winter night had fallen over Shadow Hill. Palla turned
on the electric light, stood for a while looking sombrely at the
framed photographs of her father and mother, then, feeling lonely,
went into the kitchen where Martha was busy with preparations
for dinner.</p>

<p>"Martha," she said, "I'm going to New York."</p>

<p>"Well, for the land's sake&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'm going day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"What on earth makes you act like a gypsy, Palla?" she demanded
querulously, seasoning the soup and tasting it. "Your pa and ma
wasn't like that. They was satisfied to set and rest a mite after
being away. But you've been gone four years 'n more, and now you're
up and off again, hippity-skip! clippity-clip!&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I'm just going to run down to New York and look about. I want
to look around and see what&#11834;"</p>

<p>"That's <em>you</em>, Palla! That's what you allus was doing
as a child&mdash;allus looking about you with your wide brown eyes,
to see what you could see in the world!... You know what curiosity
did to the cat?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Pinched her paw in the mouse-trap."</p>

<p>"I'll be careful," said the girl, laughing.</p>
