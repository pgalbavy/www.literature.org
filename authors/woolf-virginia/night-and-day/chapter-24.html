<p>The first signs of spring, even such as make themselves felt
towards the middle of February, not only produce little white
and violet flowers in the more sheltered corners of woods and
gardens, but bring to birth thoughts and desires comparable to
those faintly colored and sweetly scented petals in the minds
of men and women. Lives frozen by age, so far as the present is
concerned, to a hard surface, which neither reflects nor yields,
at this season become soft and fluid, reflecting the shapes and
colors of the present, as well as the shapes and colors of the
past. In the case of Mrs. Hilbery, these early spring days were
chiefly upsetting inasmuch as they caused a general quickening
of her emotional powers, which, as far as the past was concerned,
had never suffered much diminution. But in the spring her desire
for expression invariably increased. She was haunted by the ghosts
of phrases. She gave herself up to a sensual delight in the combinations
of words. She sought them in the pages of her favorite authors.
She made them for herself on scraps of paper, and rolled them
on her tongue when there seemed no occasion for such eloquence.
She was upheld in these excursions by the certainty that no language
could outdo the splendor of her father’s memory, and although
her efforts did not notably further the end of his biography,
she was under the impression of living more in his shade at such
times than at others. No one can escape the power of language,
let alone those of English birth brought up from childhood, as
Mrs. Hilbery had been, to disport themselves now in the Saxon
plainness, now in the Latin splendor of the tongue, and stored
with memories, as she was, of old poets exuberating in an infinity
of vocables. Even Katharine was slightly affected against her
better judgment by her mother’s enthusiasm. Not that her judgment
could altogether acquiesce in the necessity for a study of Shakespeare’s
sonnets as a preliminary to the fifth chapter of her grandfather’s
biography. Beginning with a perfectly frivolous jest, Mrs. Hilbery
had evolved a theory that Anne Hathaway had a way, among other
things, of writing Shakespeare’s sonnets; the idea, struck out
to enliven a party of professors, who forwarded a number of privately
printed manuals within the next few days for her instruction,
had submerged her in a flood of Elizabethan literature; she had
come half to believe in her joke, which was, she said, at least
as good as other people’s facts, and all her fancy for the time
being centered upon Stratford-on-Avon. She had a plan, she told
Katharine, when, rather later than usual, Katharine came into
the room the morning after her walk by the river, for visiting
Shakespeare’s tomb. Any fact about the poet had become, for the
moment, of far greater interest to her than the immediate present,
and the certainty that there was existing in England a spot of
ground where Shakespeare had undoubtedly stood, where his very
bones lay directly beneath one’s feet, was so absorbing to her
on this particular occasion that she greeted her daughter with
the exclamation:</p>

<p>"D’you think he ever passed this house?"</p>

<p>The question, for the moment, seemed to Katharine to have reference
to Ralph Denham.</p>

<p>"On his way to Blackfriars, I mean," Mrs. Hilbery continued,
"for you know the latest discovery is that he owned a house there."</p>

<p>Katharine still looked about her in perplexity, and Mrs. Hilbery
added:</p>

<p>"Which is a proof that he wasn’t as poor as they’ve sometimes
said. I should like to think that he had enough, though I don’t
in the least want him to be rich."</p>

<p>Then, perceiving her daughter’s expression of perplexity, Mrs.
Hilbery burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"My dear, I’m not talking about <em>YOUR </em>William, though
that’s another reason for liking him. I’m talking, I’m thinking,
I’m dreaming of MY William &mdash;William Shakespeare, of course.
Isn’t it odd," she mused, standing at the window and tapping gently
upon the pane, "that for all one can see, that dear old thing
in the blue bonnet, crossing the road with her basket on her arm,
has never heard that there was such a person? Yet it all goes
on: lawyers hurrying to their work, cabmen squabbling for their
fares, little boys rolling their hoops, little girls throwing
bread to the gulls, as if there weren’t a Shakespeare in the world.
I should like to stand at that crossing all day long and say:
‘People, read Shakespeare!’"</p>

<p>Katharine sat down at her table and opened a long dusty envelope.
As Shelley was mentioned in the course of the letter as if he
were alive, it had, of course, considerable value. Her immediate
task was to decide whether the whole letter should be printed,
or only the paragraph which mentioned Shelley’s name, and she
reached out for a pen and held it in readiness to do justice upon
the sheet. Her pen, however, remained in the air. Almost surreptitiously
she slipped a clean sheet in front of her, and her hand, descending,
began drawing square boxes halved and quartered by straight lines,
and then circles which underwent the same process of dissection.</p>

<p>"Katharine! I’ve hit upon a brilliant idea!" Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed&mdash;"to
lay out, say, a hundred pounds or so on copies of Shakespeare,
and give them to working men. Some of your clever friends who
get up meetings might help us, Katharine. And that might lead
to a playhouse, where we could all take parts. You’d be Rosalind&mdash;but
you’ve a dash of the old nurse in you. Your father’s Hamlet, come
to years of discretion; and I’m&mdash;well, I’m a bit of them all;
I’m quite a large bit of the fool, but the fools in Shakespeare
say all the clever things. Now who shall William be? A hero? Hotspur?
Henry the Fifth? No, William’s got a touch of Hamlet in him, too.
I can fancy that William talks to himself when he’s alone. Ah,
Katharine, you must say very beautiful things when you’re together!"
she added wistfully, with a glance at her daughter, who had told
her nothing about the dinner the night before.</p>

<p>"Oh, we talk a lot of nonsense," said Katharine, hiding her slip
of paper as her mother stood by her, and spreading the old letter
about Shelley in front of her.</p>

<p>"It won’t seem to you nonsense in ten years’ time," said Mrs.
Hilbery. "Believe me, Katharine, you’ll look back on these days
afterwards; you’ll remember all the silly things you’ve said;
and you’ll find that your life has been built on them. The best
of life is built on what we say when we’re in love. It isn’t nonsense,
Katharine," she urged, "it’s the truth, it’s the only truth."</p>

<p>Katharine was on the point of interrupting her mother, and then
she was on the point of confiding in her. They came strangely
close together sometimes. But, while she hesitated and sought
for words not too direct, her mother had recourse to Shakespeare,
and turned page after page, set upon finding some quotation which
said all this about love far, far better than she could. Accordingly,
Katharine did nothing but scrub one of her circles an intense
black with her pencil, in the midst of which process the telephone-bell
rang, and she left the room to answer it.</p>

<p>When she returned, Mrs. Hilbery had found not the passage she
wanted, but another of exquisite beauty as she justly observed,
looking up for a second to ask Katharine who that was?</p>

<p>"Mary Datchet," Katharine replied briefly.</p>

<p>"Ah &mdash;I half wish I’d called you Mary, but it wouldn’t have
gone with Hilbery, and it wouldn’t have gone with Rodney. Now
this isn’t the passage I wanted. (I never can find what I want.)
But it’s spring; it’s the daffodils; it’s the green fields; it’s
the birds."</p>

<p>She was cut short in her quotation by another imperative telephone-bell.
Once more Katharine left the room.</p>

<p>"My dear child, how odious the triumphs of science are!" Mrs.
Hilbery exclaimed on her return. "They’ll be linking us with the
moon next&mdash;but who was that?"</p>

<p>"William," Katharine replied yet more briefly.</p>

<p>"I’ll forgive William anything, for I’m certain that there aren’t
any Williams in the moon. I hope he’s coming to luncheon?"</p>

<p>"He’s coming to tea."</p>

<p>"Well, that’s better than nothing, and I promise to leave you
alone."</p>

<p>"There’s no need for you to do that," said Katharine.</p>

<p>She swept her hand over the faded sheet, and drew herself up
squarely to the table as if she refused to waste time any longer.
The gesture was not lost upon her mother. It hinted at the existence
of something stern and unapproachable in her daughter’s character,
which struck chill upon her, as the sight of poverty, or drunkenness,
or the logic with which Mr. Hilbery sometimes thought good to
demolish her certainty of an approaching millennium struck chill
upon her. She went back to her own table, and putting on her spectacles
with a curious expression of quiet humility, addressed herself
for the first time that morning to the task before her. The shock
with an unsympathetic world had a sobering effect on her. For
once, her industry surpassed her daughter’s. Katharine could not
reduce the world to that particular perspective in which Harriet
Martineau, for instance, was a figure of solid importance, and
possessed of a genuine relationship to this figure or to that
date. Singularly enough, the sharp call of the telephone-bell
still echoed in her ear, and her body and mind were in a state
of tension, as if, at any moment, she might hear another summons
of greater interest to her than the whole of the nineteenth century.
She did not clearly realize what this call was to be; but when
the ears have got into the habit of listening, they go on listening
involuntarily, and thus Katharine spent the greater part of the
morning in listening to a variety of sounds in the back streets
of Chelsea. For the first time in her life, probably, she wished
that Mrs. Hilbery would not keep so closely to her work. A quotation
from Shakespeare would not have come amiss. Now and again she
heard a sigh from her mother’s table, but that was the only proof
she gave of her existence, and Katharine did not think of connecting
it with the square aspect of her own position at the table, or,
perhaps, she would have thrown her pen down and told her mother
the reason of her restlessness. The only writing she managed to
accomplish in the course of the morning was one letter, addressed
to her cousin, Cassandra Otway&mdash;a rambling letter, long, affectionate,
playful and commanding all at once. She bade Cassandra put her
creatures in the charge of a groom, and come to them for a week
or so. They would go and hear some music together. Cassandra’s
dislike of rational society, she said, was an affectation fast
hardening into a prejudice, which would, in the long run, isolate
her from all interesting people and pursuits. She was finishing
the sheet when the sound she was anticipating all the time actually
struck upon her ears. She jumped up hastily, and slammed the door
with a sharpness which made Mrs. Hilbery start. Where was Katharine
off to? In her preoccupied state she had not heard the bell.</p>

<p>The alcove on the stairs, in which the telephone was placed,
was screened for privacy by a curtain of purple velvet. It was
a pocket for superfluous possessions, such as exist in most houses
which harbor the wreckage of three generations. Prints of great-uncles,
famed for their prowess in the East, hung above Chinese teapots,
whose sides were riveted by little gold stitches, and the precious
teapots, again, stood upon bookcases containing the complete works
of William Cowper and Sir Walter Scott. The thread of sound, issuing
from the telephone, was always colored by the surroundings which
received it, so it seemed to Katharine. Whose voice was now going
to combine with them, or to strike a discord?</p>

<p>"Whose voice?" she asked herself, hearing a man inquire, with
great determination, for her number. The unfamiliar voice now
asked for Miss Hilbery. Out of all the welter of voices which
crowd round the far end of the telephone, out of the enormous
range of possibilities, whose voice, what possibility, was this?
A pause gave her time to ask herself this question. It was solved
next moment.</p>

<p>"I’ve looked out the train.... Early on Saturday afternoon would
suit me best.... I’m Ralph Denham.... But I’ll write it down...."</p>

<p>With more than the usual sense of being impinged upon the point
of a bayonet, Katharine replied:</p>

<p>"I think I could come. I’ll look at my engagements.... Hold on."</p>

<p>She dropped the machine, and looked fixedly at the print of the
great-uncle who had not ceased to gaze, with an air of amiable
authority, into a world which, as yet, beheld no symptoms of the
Indian Mutiny. And yet, gently swinging against the wall, within
the black tube, was a voice which recked nothing of Uncle James,
of China teapots, or of red velvet curtains. She watched the oscillation
of the tube, and at the same moment became conscious of the individuality
of the house in which she stood; she heard the soft domestic sounds
of regular existence upon staircases and floors above her head,
and movements through the wall in the house next door. She had
no very clear vision of Denham himself, when she lifted the telephone
to her lips and replied that she thought Saturday would suit her.
She hoped that he would not say good-bye at once, although she
felt no particular anxiety to attend to what he was saying, and
began, even while he spoke, to think of her own upper room, with
its books, its papers pressed between the leaves of dictionaries,
and the table that could be cleared for work. She replaced the
instrument, thoughtfully; her restlessness was assuaged; she finished
her letter to Cassandra without difficulty, addressed the envelope,
and fixed the stamp with her usual quick decision.</p>

<p>A bunch of anemones caught Mrs. Hilbery’s eye when they had finished
luncheon. The blue and purple and white of the bowl, standing
in a pool of variegated light on a polished Chippendale table
in the drawing-room window, made her stop dead with an exclamation
of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Who is lying ill in bed, Katharine?" she demanded. "Which of
our friends wants cheering up? Who feels that they’ve been forgotten
and passed over, and that nobody wants them? Whose water rates
are overdue, and the cook leaving in a temper without waiting
for her wages? There was somebody I know&mdash;" she concluded, but
for the moment the name of this desirable acquaintance escaped
her. The best representative of the forlorn company whose day
would be brightened by a bunch of anemones was, in Katharine’s
opinion, the widow of a general living in the Cromwell Road. In
default of the actually destitute and starving, whom she would
much have preferred, Mrs. Hilbery was forced to acknowledge her
claims, for though in comfortable circumstances, she was extremely
dull, unattractive, connected in some oblique fashion with literature,
and had been touched to the verge of tears, on one occasion, by
an afternoon call.</p>

<p>It happened that Mrs. Hilbery had an engagement elsewhere, so
that the task of taking the flowers to the Cromwell Road fell
upon Katharine. She took her letter to Cassandra with her, meaning
to post it in the first pillar-box she came to. When, however,
she was fairly out of doors, and constantly invited by pillar-boxes
and post-offices to slip her envelope down their scarlet throats,
she forbore. She made absurd excuses, as that she did not wish
to cross the road, or that she was certain to pass another post-office
in a more central position a little farther on. The longer she
held the letter in her hand, however, the more persistently certain
questions pressed upon her, as if from a collection of voices
in the air. These invisible people wished to be informed whether
she was engaged to William Rodney, or was the engagement broken
off? Was it right, they asked, to invite Cassandra for a visit,
and was William Rodney in love with her, or likely to fall in
love? Then the questioners paused for a moment, and resumed as
if another side of the problem had just come to their notice.
What did Ralph Denham mean by what he said to you last night?
Do you consider that he is in love with you? Is it right to consent
to a solitary walk with him, and what advice are you going to
give him about his future? Has William Rodney cause to be jealous
of your conduct, and what do you propose to do about Mary Datchet?
What are you going to do? What does honor require you to do? they
repeated.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" Katharine exclaimed, after listening to all these
remarks, "I suppose I ought to make up my mind."</p>

<p>But the debate was a formal skirmishing, a pastime to gain breathing-space.
Like all people brought up in a tradition, Katharine was able,
within ten minutes or so, to reduce any moral difficulty to its
traditional shape and solve it by the traditional answers. The
book of wisdom lay open, if not upon her mother’s knee, upon the
knees of many uncles and aunts. She had only to consult them,
and they would at once turn to the right page and read out an
answer exactly suited to one in her position. The rules which
should govern the behavior of an unmarried woman are written in
red ink, graved upon marble, if, by some freak of nature, it should
fall out that the unmarried woman has not the same writing scored
upon her heart. She was ready to believe that some people are
fortunate enough to reject, accept, resign, or lay down their
lives at the bidding of traditional authority; she could envy
them; but in her case the questions became phantoms directly she
tried seriously to find an answer, which proved that the traditional
answer would be of no use to her individually. Yet it had served
so many people, she thought, glancing at the rows of houses on
either side of her, where families, whose incomes must be between
a thousand and fifteen-hundred a year lived, and kept, perhaps,
three servants, and draped their windows with curtains which were
always thick and generally dirty, and must, she thought, since
you could only see a looking-glass gleaming above a sideboard
on which a dish of apples was set, keep the room inside very dark.
But she turned her head away, observing that this was not a method
of thinking the matter out.</p>

<p>The only truth which she could discover was the truth of what
she herself felt&mdash;a frail beam when compared with the broad illumination
shed by the eyes of all the people who are in agreement to see
together; but having rejected the visionary voices, she had no
choice but to make this her guide through the dark masses which
confronted her. She tried to follow her beam, with an expression
upon her face which would have made any passer-by think her reprehensibly
and almost ridiculously detached from the surrounding scene. One
would have felt alarmed lest this young and striking woman were
about to do something eccentric. But her beauty saved her from
the worst fate that can befall a pedestrian; people looked at
her, but they did not laugh. To seek a true feeling among the
chaos of the unfeelings or half-feelings of life, to recognize
it when found, and to accept the consequences of the discovery,
draws lines upon the smoothest brow, while it quickens the light
of the eyes; it is a pursuit which is alternately bewildering,
debasing, and exalting, and, as Katharine speedily found, her
discoveries gave her equal cause for surprise, shame, and intense
anxiety. Much depended, as usual, upon the interpretation of the
word love; which word came up again and again, whether she considered
Rodney, Denham, Mary Datchet, or herself; and in each case it
seemed to stand for something different, and yet for something
unmistakable and something not to be passed by. For the more she
looked into the confusion of lives which, instead of running parallel,
had suddenly intersected each other, the more distinctly she seemed
to convince herself that there was no other light on them than
was shed by this strange illumination, and no other path save
the one upon which it threw its beams. Her blindness in the case
of Rodney, her attempt to match his true feeling with her false
feeling, was a failure never to be sufficiently condemned; indeed,
she could only pay it the tribute of leaving it a black and naked
landmark unburied by attempt at oblivion or excuse.</p>

<p>With this to humiliate there was much to exalt. She thought of
three different scenes; she thought of Mary sitting upright and
saying, "I’m in love &mdash;I’m in love"; she thought of Rodney
losing his self-consciousness among the dead leaves, and speaking
with the abandonment of a child; she thought of Denham leaning
upon the stone parapet and talking to the distant sky, so that
she thought him mad. Her mind, passing from Mary to Denham, from
William to Cassandra, and from Denham to herself&mdash;if, as she rather
doubted, Denham’s state of mind was connected with herself&mdash;seemed
to be tracing out the lines of some symmetrical pattern, some
arrangement of life, which invested, if not herself, at least
the others, not only with interest, but with a kind of tragic
beauty. She had a fantastic picture of them upholding splendid
palaces upon their bent backs. They were the lantern-bearers,
whose lights, scattered among the crowd, wove a pattern, dissolving,
joining, meeting again in combination. Half forming such conceptions
as these in her rapid walk along the dreary streets of South Kensington,
she determined that, whatever else might be obscure, she must
further the objects of Mary, Denham, William, and Cassandra. The
way was not apparent. No course of action seemed to her indubitably
right. All she achieved by her thinking was the conviction that,
in such a cause, no risk was too great; and that, far from making
any rules for herself or others, she would let difficulties accumulate
unsolved, situations widen their jaws unsatiated, while she maintained
a position of absolute and fearless independence. So she could
best serve the people who loved.</p>

<p>Read in the light of this exaltation, there was a new meaning
in the words which her mother had penciled upon the card attached
to the bunch of anemones. The door of the house in the Cromwell
Road opened; gloomy vistas of passage and staircase were revealed;
such light as there was seemed to be concentrated upon a silver
salver of visiting-cards, whose black borders suggested that the
widow’s friends had all suffered the same bereavement. The parlor-maid
could hardly be expected to fathom the meaning of the grave tone
in which the young lady proffered the flowers, with Mrs. Hilbery’s
love; and the door shut upon the offering.</p>

<p>The sight of a face, the slam of a door, are both rather destructive
of exaltation in the abstract; and, as she walked back to Chelsea,
Katharine had her doubts whether anything would come of her resolves.
If you cannot make sure of people, however, you can hold fairly
fast to figures, and in some way or other her thought about such
problems as she was wont to consider worked in happily with her
mood as to her friends’ lives. She reached home rather late for
tea.</p>

<p>On the ancient Dutch chest in the hall she perceived one or two
hats, coats, and walking-sticks, and the sound of voices reached
her as she stood outside the drawing-room door. Her mother gave
a little cry as she came in; a cry which conveyed to Katharine
the fact that she was late, that the teacups and milk-jugs were
in a conspiracy of disobedience, and that she must immediately
take her place at the head of the table and pour out tea for the
guests. Augustus Pelham, the diarist, liked a calm atmosphere
in which to tell his stories; he liked attention; he liked to
elicit little facts, little stories, about the past and the great
dead, from such distinguished characters as Mrs. Hilbery for the
nourishment of his diary, for whose sake he frequented tea-tables
and ate yearly an enormous quantity of buttered toast. He, therefore,
welcomed Katharine with relief, and she had merely to shake hands
with Rodney and to greet the American lady who had come to be
shown the relics, before the talk started again on the broad lines
of reminiscence and discussion which were familiar to her.</p>

<p>Yet, even with this thick veil between them, she could not help
looking at Rodney, as if she could detect what had happened to
him since they met. It was in vain. His clothes, even the white
slip, the pearl in his tie, seemed to intercept her quick glance,
and to proclaim the futility of such inquiries of a discreet,
urbane gentleman, who balanced his cup of tea and poised a slice
of bread and butter on the edge of the saucer. He would not meet
her eye, but that could be accounted for by his activity in serving
and helping, and the polite alacrity with which he was answering
the questions of the American visitor.</p>

<p>It was certainly a sight to daunt any one coming in with a head
full of theories about love. The voices of the invisible questioners
were reinforced by the scene round the table, and sounded with
a tremendous self-confidence, as if they had behind them the common
sense of twenty generations, together with the immediate approval
of Mr. Augustus Pelham, Mrs. Vermont Bankes, William Rodney, and,
possibly, Mrs. Hilbery herself. Katharine set her teeth, not entirely
in the metaphorical sense, for her hand, obeying the impulse towards
definite action, laid firmly upon the table beside her an envelope
which she had been grasping all this time in complete forgetfulness.
The address was uppermost, and a moment later she saw William’s
eye rest upon it as he rose to fulfil some duty with a plate.
His expression instantly changed. He did what he was on the point
of doing, and then looked at Katharine with a look which revealed
enough of his confusion to show her that he was not entirely represented
by his appearance. In a minute or two he proved himself at a loss
with Mrs. Vermont Bankes, and Mrs. Hilbery, aware of the silence
with her usual quickness, suggested that, perhaps, it was now
time that Mrs. Bankes should be shown "our things."</p>

<p>Katharine accordingly rose, and led the way to the little inner
room with the pictures and the books. Mrs. Bankes and Rodney followed
her.</p>

<p>She turned on the lights, and began directly in her low, pleasant
voice: "This table is my grandfather’s writing-table. Most of
the later poems were written at it. And this is his pen&mdash;the last
pen he ever used." She took it in her hand and paused for the
right number of seconds. "Here,"  she continued, "is the original
manuscript of the ‘Ode to Winter.’ The early manuscripts are far
less corrected than the later ones, as you will see directly....
Oh, do take it yourself," she added, as Mrs. Bankes asked, in
an awestruck tone of voice, for that privilege, and began a preliminary
unbuttoning of her white kid gloves.</p>

<p>"You are wonderfully like your grandfather, Miss Hilbery," the
American lady observed, gazing from Katharine to the portrait,
"especially about the eyes. Come, now, I expect she writes poetry
herself, doesn’t she?"  she asked in a jocular tone, turning to
William. "Quite one’s ideal of a poet, is it not, Mr. Rodney?
I cannot tell you what a privilege I feel it to be standing just
here with the poet’s granddaughter. You must know we think a great
deal of your grandfather in America, Miss Hilbery. We have societies
for reading him aloud. What! His very own slippers!"  Laying aside
the manuscript, she hastily grasped the old shoes, and remained
for a moment dumb in contemplation of them.</p>

<p>While Katharine went on steadily with her duties as show-woman,
Rodney examined intently a row of little drawings which he knew
by heart already. His disordered state of mind made it necessary
for him to take advantage of these little respites, as if he had
been out in a high wind and must straighten his dress in the first
shelter he reached. His calm was only superficial, as he knew
too well; it did not exist much below the surface of tie, waistcoat,
and white slip.</p>

<p>On getting out of bed that morning he had fully made up his mind
to ignore what had been said the night before; he had been convinced,
by the sight of Denham, that his love for Katharine was passionate,
and when he addressed her early that morning on the telephone,
he had meant his cheerful but authoritative tones to convey to
her the fact that, after a night of madness, they were as indissolubly
engaged as ever. But when he reached his office his torments began.
He found a letter from Cassandra waiting for him. She had read
his play, and had taken the very first opportunity to write and
tell him what she thought of it. She knew, she wrote, that her
praise meant absolutely nothing; but still, she had sat up all
night; she thought this, that, and the other; she was full of
enthusiasm most elaborately scratched out in places, but enough
was written plain to gratify William’s vanity exceedingly. She
was quite intelligent enough to say the right things, or, even
more charmingly, to hint at them. In other ways, too, it was a
very charming letter. She told him about her music, and about
a Suffrage meeting to which Henry had taken her, and she asserted,
half seriously, that she had learnt the Greek alphabet, and found
it "fascinating." The word was underlined. Had she laughed when
she drew that line? Was she ever serious? Didn’t the letter show
the most engaging compound of enthusiasm and spirit and whimsicality,
all tapering into a flame of girlish freakishness, which flitted,
for the rest of the morning, as a will-o’-the-wisp, across Rodney’s
landscape. He could not resist beginning an answer to her there
and then. He found it particularly delightful to shape a style
which should express the bowing and curtsying, advancing and retreating,
which are characteristic of one of the many million partnerships
of men and women. Katharine never trod that particular measure,
he could not help reflecting; Katharine&mdash;Cassandra; Cassandra
&mdash;Katharine&mdash;they alternated in his consciousness all day
long. It was all very well to dress oneself carefully, compose
one’s face, and start off punctually at half-past four to a tea-party
in Cheyne Walk, but Heaven only knew what would come of it all,
and when Katharine, after sitting silent with her usual immobility,
wantonly drew from her pocket and slapped down on the table beneath
his eyes a letter addressed to Cassandra herself, his composure
deserted him. What did she mean by her behavior?</p>

<p>He looked up sharply from his row of little pictures. Katharine
was disposing of the American lady in far too arbitrary a fashion.
Surely the victim herself must see how foolish her enthusiasms
appeared in the eyes of the poet’s granddaughter. Katharine never
made any attempt to spare people’s feelings, he reflected; and,
being himself very sensitive to all shades of comfort and discomfort,
he cut short the auctioneer’s catalog, which Katharine was reeling
off more and more absent-mindedly, and took Mrs. Vermont Bankes,
with a queer sense of fellowship in suffering, under his own protection.</p>

<p>But within a few minutes the American lady had completed her
inspection, and inclining her head in a little nod of reverential
farewell to the poet and his shoes, she was escorted downstairs
by Rodney. Katharine stayed by herself in the little room. The
ceremony of ancestor-worship had been more than usually oppressive
to her. Moreover, the room was becoming crowded beyond the bounds
of order. Only that morning a heavily insured proof-sheet had
reached them from a collector in Australia, which recorded a change
of the poet’s mind about a very famous phrase, and, therefore,
had claims to the honor of glazing and framing. But was there
room for it? Must it be hung on the staircase, or should some
other relic give place to do it honor? Feeling unable to decide
the question, Katharine glanced at the portrait of her grandfather,
as if to ask his opinion. The artist who had painted it was now
out of fashion, and by dint of showing it to visitors, Katharine
had almost ceased to see anything but a glow of faintly pleasing
pink and brown tints, enclosed within a circular scroll of gilt
laurel-leaves. The young man who was her grandfather looked vaguely
over her head. The sensual lips were slightly parted, and gave
the face an expression of beholding something lovely or miraculous
vanishing or just rising upon the rim of the distance. The expression
repeated itself curiously upon Katharine’s face as she gazed up
into his. They were the same age, or very nearly so. She wondered
what he was looking for; were there waves beating upon a shore
for him, too, she wondered, and heroes riding through the leaf-hung
forests? For perhaps the first time in her life she thought of
him as a man, young, unhappy, tempestuous, full of desires and
faults; for the first time she realized him for herself, and not
from her mother’s memory. He might have been her brother, she
thought. It seemed to her that they were akin, with the mysterious
kinship of blood which makes it seem possible to interpret the
sights which the eyes of the dead behold so intently, or even
to believe that they look with us upon our present joys and sorrows.
He would have understood, she thought, suddenly; and instead of
laying her withered flowers upon his shrine, she brought him her
own perplexities&mdash;perhaps a gift of greater value, should the
dead be conscious of gifts, than flowers and incense and adoration.
Doubts, questionings, and despondencies she felt, as she looked
up, would be more welcome to him than homage, and he would hold
them but a very small burden if she gave him, also, some share
in what she suffered and achieved. The depth of her own pride
and love were not more apparent to her than the sense that the
dead asked neither flowers nor regrets, but a share in the life
which they had given her, the life which they had lived.</p>

<p>Rodney found her a moment later sitting beneath her grandfather’s
portrait. She laid her hand on the seat next her in a friendly
way, and said:</p>

<p>"Come and sit down, William. How glad I was you were here! I
felt myself getting ruder and ruder."</p>

<p>"You are not good at hiding your feelings," he returned dryly.</p>

<p>"Oh, don’t scold me &mdash;I’ve had a horrid afternoon." She
told him how she had taken the flowers to Mrs. McCormick, and
how South Kensington impressed her as the preserve of officers’
widows. She described how the door had opened, and what gloomy
avenues of busts and palm-trees and umbrellas had been revealed
to her. She spoke lightly, and succeeded in putting him at his
ease. Indeed, he rapidly became too much at his ease to persist
in a condition of cheerful neutrality. He felt his composure slipping
from him. Katharine made it seem so natural to ask her to help
him, or advise him, to say straight out what he had in his mind.
The letter from Cassandra was heavy in his pocket. There was also
the letter to Cassandra lying on the table in the next room. The
atmosphere seemed charged with Cassandra. But, unless Katharine
began the subject of her own accord, he could not even hint&mdash;he
must ignore the whole affair; it was the part of a gentleman to
preserve a bearing that was, as far as he could make it, the bearing
of an undoubting lover. At intervals he sighed deeply. He talked
rather more quickly than usual about the possibility that some
of the operas of Mozart would be played in the summer. He had
received a notice, he said, and at once produced a pocket-book
stuffed with papers, and began shuffling them in search. He held
a thick envelope between his finger and thumb, as if the notice
from the opera company had become in some way inseparably attached
to it.</p>

<p>"A letter from Cassandra?" said Katharine, in the easiest voice
in the world, looking over his shoulder. "I’ve just written to
ask her to come here, only I forgot to post it."</p>

<p>He handed her the envelope in silence. She took it, extracted
the sheets, and read the letter through.</p>

<p>The reading seemed to Rodney to take an intolerably long time.</p>

<p>"Yes," she observed at length, "a very charming letter."</p>

<p>Rodney’s face was half turned away, as if in bashfulness. Her
view of his profile almost moved her to laughter. She glanced
through the pages once more.</p>

<p>"I see no harm," William blurted out, "in helping her&mdash;with Greek,
for example&mdash;if she really cares for that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"There’s no reason why she shouldn’t care," said Katharine, consulting
the pages once more. "In fact&mdash;ah, here it is&mdash;‘The Greek alphabet
is absolutely <em>FASCINATING.’ </em>Obviously she does care."</p>

<p>"Well, Greek may be rather a large order. I was thinking chiefly
of English. Her criticisms of my play, though they’re too generous,
evidently immature&mdash;she can’t be more than twenty-two, I suppose?&mdash;they
certainly show the sort of thing one wants: real feeling for poetry,
understanding, not formed, of course, but it’s at the root of
everything after all. There’d be no harm in lending her books?"</p>

<p>"No. Certainly not."</p>

<p>"But if it&mdash;hum&mdash;led to a correspondence? I mean, Katharine,
I take it, without going into matters which seem to me a little
morbid, I mean,"  he floundered, "you, from your point of view,
feel that there’s nothing disagreeable to you in the notion? If
so, you’ve only to speak, and I never think of it again."</p>

<p>She was surprised by the violence of her desire that he never
should think of it again. For an instant it seemed to her impossible
to surrender an intimacy, which might not be the intimacy of love,
but was certainly the intimacy of true friendship, to any woman
in the world. Cassandra would never understand him&mdash;she was not
good enough for him. The letter seemed to her a letter of flattery&mdash;a
letter addressed to his weakness, which it made her angry to think
was known to another. For he was not weak; he had the rare strength
of doing what he promised&mdash;she had only to speak, and he would
never think of Cassandra again.</p>

<p>She paused. Rodney guessed the reason. He was amazed.</p>

<p>"She loves me," he thought. The woman he admired more than any
one in the world, loved him, as he had given up hope that she
would ever love him. And now that for the first time he was sure
of her love, he resented it. He felt it as a fetter, an encumbrance,
something which made them both, but him in particular, ridiculous.
He was in her power completely, but his eyes were open and he
was no longer her slave or her dupe. He would be her master in
future. The instant prolonged itself as Katharine realized the
strength of her desire to speak the words that should keep William
for ever, and the baseness of the temptation which assailed her
to make the movement, or speak the word, which he had often begged
her for, which she was now near enough to feeling. She held the
letter in her hand. She sat silent.</p>

<p>At this moment there was a stir in the other room; the voice
of Mrs. Hilbery was heard talking of proof-sheets rescued by miraculous
providence from butcher’s ledgers in Australia; the curtain separating
one room from the other was drawn apart, and Mrs. Hilbery and
Augustus Pelham stood in the doorway. Mrs. Hilbery stopped short.
She looked at her daughter, and at the man her daughter was to
marry, with her peculiar smile that always seemed to tremble on
the brink of satire.</p>

<p>"The best of all my treasures, Mr. Pelham!" she exclaimed. "Don’t
move, Katharine. Sit still, William. Mr. Pelham will come another
day."</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham looked, smiled, bowed, and, as his hostess had moved
on, followed her without a word. The curtain was drawn again either
by him or by Mrs. Hilbery.</p>

<p>But her mother had settled the question somehow. Katharine doubted
no longer.</p>

<p>"As I told you last night," she said, "I think it’s your duty,
if there’s a chance that you care for Cassandra, to discover what
your feeling is for her now. It’s your duty to her, as well as
to me. But we must tell my mother. We can’t go on pretending."</p>

<p>"That is entirely in your hands, of course," said Rodney, with
an immediate return to the manner of a formal man of honor.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Katharine.</p>

<p>Directly he left her she would go to her mother, and explain
that the engagement was at an end&mdash;or it might be better that
they should go together?</p>

<p>"But, Katharine," Rodney began, nervously attempting to stuff
Cassandra’s sheets back into their envelope; "if Cassandra&mdash;should
Cassandra&mdash;you’ve asked Cassandra to stay with you."</p>

<p>"Yes; but I’ve not posted the letter."</p>

<p>He crossed his knees in a discomfited silence. By all his codes
it was impossible to ask a woman with whom he had just broken
off his engagement to help him to become acquainted with another
woman with a view to his falling in love with her. If it was announced
that their engagement was over, a long and complete separation
would inevitably follow; in those circumstances, letters and gifts
were returned; after years of distance the severed couple met,
perhaps at an evening party, and touched hands uncomfortably with
an indifferent word or two. He would be cast off completely; he
would have to trust to his own resources. He could never mention
Cassandra to Katharine again; for months, and doubtless years,
he would never see Katharine again; anything might happen to her
in his absence.</p>

<p>Katharine was almost as well aware of his perplexities as he
was. She knew in what direction complete generosity pointed the
way; but pride&mdash;for to remain engaged to Rodney and to cover his
experiments hurt what was nobler in her than mere vanity&mdash;fought
for its life.</p>

<p>"I’m to give up my freedom for an indefinite time," she thought,
"in order that William may see Cassandra here at his ease. He’s
not the courage to manage it without my help&mdash;he’s too much of
a coward to tell me openly what he wants. He hates the notion
of a public breach. He wants to keep us both."</p>

<p>When she reached this point, Rodney pocketed the letter and elaborately
looked at his watch. Although the action meant that he resigned
Cassandra, for he knew his own incompetence and distrusted himself
entirely, and lost Katharine, for whom his feeling was profound
though unsatisfactory, still it appeared to him that there was
nothing else left for him to do. He was forced to go, leaving
Katharine free, as he had said, to tell her mother that the engagement
was at an end. But to do what plain duty required of an honorable
man, cost an effort which only a day or two ago would have been
inconceivable to him. That a relationship such as he had glanced
at with desire could be possible between him and Katharine, he
would have been the first, two days ago, to deny with indignation.
But now his life had changed; his attitude had changed; his feelings
were different; new aims and possibilities had been shown him,
and they had an almost irresistible fascination and force. The
training of a life of thirty-five years had not left him defenceless;
he was still master of his dignity; he rose, with a mind made
up to an irrevocable farewell.</p>

<p>"I leave you, then," he said, standing up and holding out his
hand with an effort that left him pale, but lent him dignity,
"to tell your mother that our engagement is ended by your desire."</p>

<p>She took his hand and held it.</p>

<p>"You don’t trust me?" she said.</p>

<p>"I do, absolutely," he replied.</p>

<p>"No. You don’t trust me to help you.... I could help you?"</p>

<p>"I’m hopeless without your help!" he exclaimed passionately,
but withdrew his hand and turned his back. When he faced her,
she thought that she saw him for the first time without disguise.</p>

<p>"It’s useless to pretend that I don’t understand what you’re
offering, Katharine. I admit what you say. Speaking to you perfectly
frankly, I believe at this moment that I do love your cousin;
there is a chance that, with your help, I might&mdash;but no," he broke
off, "it’s impossible, it’s wrong &mdash;I’m infinitely to blame
for having allowed this situation to arise."</p>

<p>"Sit beside me. Let’s consider sensibly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your sense has been our undoing&mdash;" he groaned.</p>

<p>"I accept the responsibility."</p>

<p>"Ah, but can I allow that?" he exclaimed. "It would mean&mdash;for
we must face it, Katharine&mdash;that we let our engagement stand for
the time nominally; in fact, of course, your freedom would be
absolute."</p>

<p>"And yours too."</p>

<p>"Yes, we should both be free. Let us say that I saw Cassandra
once, twice, perhaps, under these conditions; and then if, as
I think certain, the whole thing proves a dream, we tell your
mother instantly. Why not tell her now, indeed, under pledge of
secrecy?"</p>

<p>"Why not? It would be over London in ten minutes, besides, she
would never even remotely understand."</p>

<p>"Your father, then? This secrecy is detestable&mdash;it’s dishonorable."</p>

<p>"My father would understand even less than my mother."</p>

<p>"Ah, who could be expected to understand?" Rodney groaned; "but
it’s from your point of view that we must look at it. It’s not
only asking too much, it’s putting you into a position&mdash;a position
in which I could not endure to see my own sister."</p>

<p>"We’re not brothers and sisters," she said impatiently, "and
if we can’t decide, who can? I’m not talking nonsense," she proceeded.
"I’ve done my best to think this out from every point of view,
and I’ve come to the conclusion that there are risks which have
to be taken,&mdash;though I don’t deny that they hurt horribly."</p>

<p>"Katharine, you mind? You’ll mind too much."</p>

<p>"No I shan’t," she said stoutly. "I shall mind a good deal, but
I’m prepared for that; I shall get through it, because you will
help me. You’ll both help me. In fact, we’ll help each other.
That’s a Christian doctrine, isn’t it?"</p>

<p>"It sounds more like Paganism to me," Rodney groaned, as he reviewed
the situation into which her Christian doctrine was plunging them.</p>

<p>And yet he could not deny that a divine relief possessed him,
and that the future, instead of wearing a lead-colored mask, now
blossomed with a thousand varied gaieties and excitements. He
was actually to see Cassandra within a week or perhaps less, and
he was more anxious to know the date of her arrival than he could
own even to himself. It seemed base to be so anxious to pluck
this fruit of Katharine’s unexampled generosity and of his own
contemptible baseness. And yet, though he used these words automatically,
they had now no meaning. He was not debased in his own eyes by
what he had done, and as for praising Katharine, were they not
partners, conspirators, people bent upon the same quest together,
so that to praise the pursuit of a common end as an act of generosity
was meaningless. He took her hand and pressed it, not in thanks
so much as in an ecstasy of comradeship.</p>

<p>"We will help each other," he said, repeating her words, seeking
her eyes in an enthusiasm of friendship.</p>

<p>Her eyes were grave but dark with sadness as they rested on him.
"He’s already gone," she thought, "far away&mdash;he thinks of me no
more." And the fancy came to her that, as they sat side by side,
hand in hand, she could hear the earth pouring from above to make
a barrier between them, so that, as they sat, they were separated
second by second by an impenetrable wall. The process, which affected
her as that of being sealed away and for ever from all companionship
with the person she cared for most, came to an end at last, and
by common consent they unclasped their fingers, Rodney touching
hers with his lips, as the curtain parted, and Mrs. Hilbery peered
through the opening with her benevolent and sarcastic expression
to ask whether Katharine could remember was it Tuesday or Wednesday,
and did she dine in Westminster?</p>

<p>"Dearest William," she said, pausing, as if she could not resist
the pleasure of encroaching for a second upon this wonderful world
of love and confidence and romance. "Dearest children," she added,
disappearing with an impulsive gesture, as if she forced herself
to draw the curtain upon a scene which she refused all temptation
to interrupt.</p>
