<p> <em>THE </em>cradle of oversea traffic and of the art of naval
combats, the Mediterranean, apart from all the associations of
adventure and glory, the common heritage of all mankind, makes
a tender appeal to a seaman. It has sheltered the infancy of his
craft.  He looks upon it as a man may look at a vast nursery in
an old, old mansion where innumerable generations of his own people
have learned to walk.  I say his own people because, in a sense,
all sailors belong to one family: all are descended from that
adventurous and shaggy ancestor who, bestriding a shapeless log
and paddling with a crooked branch, accomplished the first coasting-trip
in a sheltered bay ringing with the admiring howls of his tribe. 
It is a matter of regret that all those brothers in craft and
feeling, whose generations have learned to walk a ship’s deck
in that nursery, have been also more than once fiercely engaged
in cutting each other’s throats there.  But life, apparently,
has such exigencies.  Without human propensity to murder and other
sorts of unrighteousness there would have been no historical heroism. 
It is a consoling reflection.  And then, if one examines impartially
the deeds of violence, they appear of but small consequence. 
From Salamis to Actium, through Lepanto and the Nile to the naval
massacre of Navarino, not to mention other armed encounters of
lesser interest, all the blood heroically spilt into the Mediterranean
has not stained with a single trail of purple the deep azure of
its classic waters.</p>

<p>Of course, it may be argued that battles have shaped the destiny
of mankind.  The question whether they have shaped it well would
remain open, however.  But it would be hardly worth discussing. 
It is very probable that, had the Battle of Salamis never been
fought, the face of the world would have been much as we behold
it now, fashioned by the mediocre inspiration and the short-sighted
labours of men.  From a long and miserable experience of suffering,
injustice, disgrace and aggression the nations of the earth are
mostly swayed by fear—fear of the sort that a little cheap oratory
turns easily to rage, hate, and violence. Innocent, guileless
fear has been the cause of many wars.  Not, of course, the fear
of war itself, which, in the evolution of sentiments and ideas,
has come to be regarded at last as a half-mystic and glorious
ceremony with certain fashionable rites and preliminary incantations,
wherein the conception of its true nature has been lost.  To apprehend
the true aspect, force, and morality of war as a natural function
of mankind one requires a feather in the hair and a ring in the
nose, or, better still, teeth filed to a point and a tattooed
breast. Unfortunately, a return to such simple ornamentation is
impossible.  We are bound to the chariot of progress.  There is
no going back; and, as bad luck would have it, our civilization,
which has done so much for the comfort and adornment of our bodies
and the elevation of our minds, has made lawful killing frightfully
and needlessly expensive.</p>

<p>The whole question of improved armaments has been approached
by the governments of the earth in a spirit of nervous and unreflecting
haste, whereas the right way was lying plainly before them, and
had only to be pursued with calm determination.  The learned vigils
and labours of a certain class of inventors should have been rewarded
with honourable liberality as justice demanded; and the bodies
of the inventors should have been blown to pieces by means of
their own perfected explosives and improved weapons with extreme
publicity as the commonest prudence dictated.  By this method
the ardour of research in that direction would have been restrained
without infringing the sacred privileges of science. For the lack
of a little cool thinking in our guides and masters this course
has not been followed, and a beautiful simplicity has been sacrificed
for no real advantage.  A frugal mind cannot defend itself from
considerable bitterness when reflecting that at the Battle of
Actium (which was fought for no less a stake than the dominion
of the world) the fleet of Octavianus Cæsar and the fleet of Antonius,
including the Egyptian division and Cleopatra’s galley with purple
sails, probably cost less than two modern battleships, or, as
the modern naval book-jargon has it, two capital units.  But no
amount of lubberly book-jargon can disguise a fact well calculated
to afflict the soul of every sound economist.  It is not likely
that the Mediterranean will ever behold a battle with a greater
issue; but when the time comes for another historical fight its
bottom will be enriched as never before by a quantity of jagged
scrap-iron, paid for at pretty nearly its weight of gold by the
deluded populations inhabiting the isles and continents of this
planet.</p>
