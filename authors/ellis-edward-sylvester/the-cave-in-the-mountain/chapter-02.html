<p>Before Fred could complete the sentence his foot struck an obstruction
and he was precipitated headlong over and down a chasm which had
escaped his notice. He fell with such violence that he was knocked
senseless.</p>

<p>When he recovered he was in darkness, his torch having been extinguished.
The smell of the burning resin recalled him to himself, and it
required but a moment for him to remember the accident which had
befallen him. For a time he scarcely dared to stir, fearing that
he might pitch headlong over some precipice. He felt of his face
and hands, but could detect nothing like blood. The boy had received
quite a number of severe bruises, however, and when he ventured
to stir there were sharp, stinging pains in his shoulders, neck
and legs.</p>

<p>"Thank God I am alive!" was his fervent ejaculation, after he
had taken his inventory. "But I don't know where I am or how I
can get back again. I wonder what has become of the torch."</p>

<p>He could find nothing of his flambeau, although he was confident
that it was near at hand. Fred believed that he had fallen about
twenty feet, striking upon his chest and shoulders. At this juncture,
he thought of the wolf which had drawn him into the mishap, and
he turned his head so suddenly to look for him that the sharp
pain in his neck caused him to cry out. But nothing of the beast
was to be seen.</p>

<p>"Maybe he went over here ahead of me, and got killed," he thought;
"but I don't think that can be, for a wolf is a good deal spryer
than a boy can be, and he wouldn't have tumbled down as I did."</p>

<p>Fred recollected that he had several matches about him, and he
carefully struck one upon the rock beside him. The tiny flame
showed that he had stumbled into a rocky pit. It was a dozen feet
in length, some three or four in width, and, when he stood erect,
his head was level with the surface of the ground above. In consequence,
it would be a very easy matter for him to climb out whenever he
chose to do so; but above all things he was desirous of regaining
his torch. Just as the match between his fingers burned out, he
caught sight of it, lying a short distance away.</p>

<p>"It's queer what became of that wolf," he said to himself, as
he recovered the precious fagot and painfully climbed up out of
the pit. "Maybe he thought I was killed, and went off to tell
the rest of his friends, so that they can all have a feast over
me. I must fire up the torch as soon as I can, for I'm likely
to need it."</p>

<p>This did not prove a very difficult matter, on account of the
fatness of the torch, which ignited readily, and quickly spread
into the same thick, smoking flame as before. But Fred noted that
it was about half burned up, and he could not expect it to hold
out many hours longer, as it had already done good service.</p>

<p>"I wish I could see the wolf again," he said to himself, looking
longingly around in the darkness, "for I believe he entered the
cave somewhere near here, and it was a great pity that I had the
accident just at the moment I was about to learn all about it."</p>

<p>He moved carefully about the cave, and soon found that he had
reached the furtherest limit. Less than twenty feet away it terminated,
the jagged walls shutting down, and offering an impassable barrier
to any further progress in that direction.</p>

<p>All that he could do, after completing his search, was to turn
back in quest of his friend Mickey. The belief that he was in
the immediate neighborhood of the outlet delayed the lad's return
until he could assure himself that it was impossible to find that
for which he was hunting, and which had been the means of his
wandering so far away from camp.</p>

<p>Fred occupied fully an hour in the search. Here and there he
observed scratches upon the surface of the rocks in some places.
He was confident that they had been made by the feet of the wolves;
but in spite of these encouraging signs, he was baffled in his
main purpose, and how the visitor made his way in and out of the
cave remained an impenetrable mystery.</p>

<p>"Too bad, too bad!" he muttered, with a great sigh. "I shall
have to give it up, after all. I only wish Mickey was here to
help me. I will call to him, so that he will be sure to hear."</p>

<p>As has been intimated in another place, the two friends had a
code of signals understood by both. When they were separated by
quite a distance, and one wished to draw the other to him, he
had a way of placing two of his fingers against his tongue, and
emitting a shrill screech which might well be taken for the scream
of a locomotive whistle, so loud and piercing was its character.</p>

<p>When the lad uttered his signal, he was startled by the result.
A hundred echoes were awakened within the cavern, and the uproar
fairly deafened him. It seemed to him that ten thousand little
imps were perched all around the cavern, with their fingers thrust
in their mouths, waiting for him to start the tumult, when they
joined in, with an effect that was overwhelming and overpowering.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" he gasped, "I never heard anything like that.
I thought all the rocks were going to tumble down upon my head,
and I believe some must have been loosened."</p>

<p>He looked apprehensively at the dark, jagged points overhead.
But they were as grim and motionless as they had been during the
many long years that had rolled over them.</p>

<p>"Mickey must have heard that, if he is anywhere within twenty
miles," he concluded.</p>

<p>But, if such was the case, he sent back no answering signal,
as was his invariable custom, when that of his friend reached
him. Fred listened long and attentively, but caught no reply.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll have to try it again," he added, with a mingled
laugh and shudder. "I think these walls can stand a little more
such serenading."</p>

<p>He threw his whole soul in the effort, and the screeching whistle
that he sent out was frightful, followed, as it was, by the innumerable
echoes. It seemed as if the walls took up the wave of sound as
if it were a foot-ball and hurled it back and forth, from side
to side, and up and down, in furious sport. The dread of losing
his torch alone prevented the lad from throwing it down and clapping
his hands to his ears, to shut out the horrid din. Some of the
distant echoes, coming in after the others were exhausted, gave
an odd, dropping character to the volleys of sound.</p>

<p>Had the expected reply of Mickey been the same as the call to
him, the lad would have been deceived thereby, for the echoes,
as will be understood, were precisely the same as answering whistles,
uttered in the same manner. But Fred understood that, if the Irishman
heard him, he would reply with a series of short signals, such
as are heard on some railroads when danger is detected. But none
such came, and he knew, therefore, that the ears which he intended
to reach were not reached at all.</p>

<p>"I don't understand that," he mused, perplexedly, "unless he's
asleep yet. When I left him, it didn't seem as though he'd wake
up in a week. Perhaps he can hear me better if I shout."</p>

<p>A similar racket was produced when the boy strained his lungs,
but his straining ear could detect no other result. It never once
occurred to Fred that he and his friend were separated by such
a distance that they could not communicate by sound or signal.
And yet such was the case, he having traveled much further than
he suspected.</p>

<p>Having been forced to the disheartening conclusion that it was
impossible to find the outlet by which the wolf had escaped, Fred
had but one course left. That was, to find his way back to the
camp-fire in the shortest time and by the best means at his command.
If the mountain would not go to Mohammed, then Mohammed would
have to go to the mountain.</p>

<p>The lad began to feel that a great deal of responsibility was
on his shoulders. The remembrance of Mickey O'Rooney going to
sleep was alarming to him. He looked upon him as one regards a
sentinel who sinks into slumber when upon duty. Knowing the cunning
of the redskins, Fred feared that they would discover the fact,
and descend into the cave in such numbers that escape would be
out of the question.</p>

<p>And then again, suppose that their enemies did not disturb them,
what was to be their fate? The venison in the possession of the
Irishman could not last a great deal longer, and, when that was
gone, no means of obtaining food would be left. What were the
two prisoners then to do?</p>

<p>Mickey had hinted to Fred what his intention was, but the lad
felt very little faith in its success. It appeared like throwing
life away to make such a foolhardy attempt to reach the outside
as diving into a stream of water from which there was no withdrawal,
and the length of whose flow beneath the rock could only be conjectured,
with all the chances against success. But Fred recalled in what
a marked manner Providence had favored him in the past, and he
could but feel a strong faith that He would still hold him in
his remembrance. "I wouldn't have believed I could go through
all that I have had in the last few days; and yet God remembered
me, and I am sure He will not forget me so long as I try to do
His will."</p>

<p>On the eve of starting he fancied he heard a slight rustling
on his right, and he paused, hoping that the wolf would show himself
again; but he could not discern anything, and concluded that it
was the dropping of a stone or fragment of earth. The lad was
further pleased to find, upon examination, that the revolver in
his possession was uninjured by his fall. In short, the only one
that had received any injuries was himself, and his were not of
a serious character, being simply bruises, the effects of which
would wear off in a short time.</p>

<p>"I hate to leave here without seeing that wolf," he said, as
he stood hesitating, with his torch in hand. "He may be sneaking
somewhere among these rocks, popping in and out whenever he has
a chance; and if I could only get another sight of him, I would
stick to him till he told me his secret."</p>

<p>He awaited awhile longer, but the hope was an illusive one, and
he finally started on his return to camp.</p>
