<p>The black dresses of the children had become very rusty by spring,
but business had been bad at the Hotel Greensleeve, and Athalie,
Doris, and Catharine continued to wear their shabby mourning.</p>

<p>Greensleeve haunted the house all day long, roaming from bar
to office, from one room to another, silently opening doors of
unoccupied chambers to peer about in the dusty obscurity, then
noiselessly closing them, he would slink away down the dim corridor
to his late wife's room and sit there through the long sunny afternoon,
his weak face buried in his hands.</p>

<p>Ledlie had grown fatter, redder of visage, whiter of hair and
beard. When a rare guest arrived, or when local loafers wandered
into the bar with the faint stench of fertilizer clinging to their
boots, he shuffled ponderously from office to bar, serving as
economically as he dared whoever desired to be served.</p>

<p>Always a sprig of something green protruded from his small tight
mouth. His pale eyes, now faded almost colourless, had become
weak and red-rimmed, and he blinked continually except in the
stale semi-darkness of the house.</p>

<p>Always, now, he was muttering and grumbling his disapproval of
the children&mdash;"Eatin' their heads off I tell you, Pete! What good
is all this here schoolin' doin' 'em when they ought to git out
some'rs an' earn their vittles?"</p>

<p>But if Greensleeve's attitude was one of passive acquiescence,
he made no effort to withdraw the children from school. Once,
when life was younger, and Jack, his first baby, came, he had
dreamed of college for him, and of a career&mdash;in letters perhaps&mdash;something
dignified, leisurely, profound beyond his own limits. And of a
modest corner somewhere within the lustre of his son's environment
where he and his wife, grey-haired, might dream and admire, finding
there surcease from care and perhaps the peace which passes all
understanding.</p>

<p>The ex-"professor" of penmanship had been always prone to dream.
No dull and sordid reality, no hopeless sorrow had yet awakened
him. Nor had his wife's death been more real than the half-strangled
anguish of a dreamer, tossing in darkness. As for the children,
they paid no more attention to Ledlie than they might have to
a querulous but superannuated dog.</p>

<p>Jack, now fifteen, still dawdled at school, where his record
was not good. Perhaps it was partly because he had no spending
money, no clothing to maintain his boyish self-respect, no prospects
of any sort, that he had become sullen, uncommunicative, and almost
loutish.</p>

<p>Nobody governed him; his father was unqualified to control anybody
or anything; his mother was dead.</p>

<p>With her death went the last vestige of any tie that had held
the boy to the home anchorage&mdash;of any feeling of responsibility
concerning the conduct expected and required of him.</p>

<p>He shirked his studies, came home only to eat and sleep, remained
out late without explanation or any home interference, except
for the constant disputes and quarrels with Doris and Catharine,
now aged respectively fourteen and thirteen.</p>

<p>To Athalie he had little to say. Perhaps he did not realise it
but he was slightly afraid of her. And it was from her that he
took any pains at all to conceal his irregularities.</p>

<p>Once, coming in from school, she had found the house deserted,
and Jack smelling of alcohol just slouching out of the bar.</p>

<p>"If you do that again I shall tell father," she said, horrified.</p>

<p>"What do I care!" he had retorted sullenly. And it was true;
the boy no longer cared what anybody might think as long as Athalie
already knew and detested what he had done.</p>

<p>There was a garage in the neighbouring village. He spent most
of his time hanging around it. Sometimes he came home reeking
of oil and gasoline, sometimes his breath was tainted with tobacco
and alcohol.</p>

<p>He was so much bigger and older than Athalie that the child had
never entirely lost her awe of him. His weakness of character,
his failings, and the fact that he was a trifle afraid of her
opinion, combined to astonish and bewilder her.</p>

<p>For a long while she tried to understand the gradual but certain
reversal of their relations. And one night, still more or less
in awe of him, she got out of bed and went softly into his room.</p>

<p>He was not asleep. The sudden apparition of his youngest sister
considerably startled him, and he sat up in his ragged night-shirt
and stared at her where she stood in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"You look like one of your own spooks!" he said. "What's the
matter with you?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to talk with you, Jack."</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"You."</p>

<p>For a moment he sat there eyeing her uneasily; then:</p>

<p>"Well, go ahead!" he said ungraciously; and stretched himself
back on the pillows.</p>

<p>She came and seated herself on the bed's edge:</p>

<p>"Jack, please don't drink beer."</p>

<p>"Why not? Aw, what do you know about men, anyway? Don't they
all smoke and drink?"</p>

<p>"Mamma asked you not to."</p>

<p>"Gee-whiz! I was a kid then. But a man isn't a baby."</p>

<p>Athalie sighed. Her brother eyed her restlessly, aware of that
slight feeling of shame which always invaded his sullen, defiant
discontent when he knew that he had lowered himself in her estimation.</p>

<p>For, if the boy was a little afraid of her, he also cared more
for her than he ever had for any of the family except his mother.</p>

<p>He was only the average boy, stumbling blindly, almost savagely
through the maze of adolescence, with no guide, nobody to warn
or counsel him, nothing to stimulate his pride, no anchorage,
no experience.</p>

<p>Whatever character he had he had been born with: it was environment
and circumstance that were crippling it.</p>

<p>"See here, Athalie," he said, "you're a little girl and you don't
understand. There isn't any harm in my smoking a cigarette or
two or in drinking a glass of beer now and then."</p>

<p>"Isn't there, Jack?"</p>

<p>"No. So don't you worry, Sis.... And, say! I'm not going back
to school."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"What's the use? I can't go to college. Anyway what's the good
of algebra and physics and chemistry and history and all that
junk? I guess I'll go into business."</p>

<p>"What business?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I've been working around the garage. I can get
a job there if I want it."</p>

<p>"Did you ask papa?"</p>

<p>"What's the use? He'll let me do what I please. I guess I'll
start in to-morrow."</p>

<p>His father did not interfere when his only son came slouching
up to inform him of his decision.</p>

<p>After Jack had gone away toward the village and his new business,
his father remained seated on the shabby veranda, his head sunken
on his soiled shirtfront, his wasted hands clasped over his stomach.</p>

<p>For a little while, perhaps, he remembered his earlier ambitions
for the boy's career. Maybe they caused him pain. But if there
was pain it faded gradually into the lethargy which had settled
over him since his wife's death.</p>

<p>A grey veil seemed to have descended between him and the sun,&mdash;there
was greyness everywhere, and dimness, and uncertainty&mdash;in his
mind, in his eyesight&mdash;and sometimes the vagueness was in his
speech. He had noticed that&mdash;for, sometimes the word he meant
to use was not the word he uttered. It had occurred a number of
times, making foolish what he had said.</p>

<p>And Ledlie had glanced at him sharply once or twice out of his
sore and faded eyes when Greensleeve had used some word while
thinking of another.</p>

<p>When he was not wandering around the house he sat on the veranda
in a great splint-bottomed arm-chair&mdash;a little untidy figure,
more or less caved in from chest to abdomen, which made his short
thin legs hanging just above the floor seem stunted and withered.</p>

<p>To him, here, came his daughters in their soiled and rusty black
dresses, just out of school, and always stopping on impulse of
sympathy to salute him with, "Hello, papa!" and with the touch
of fresh, warm lips on his colourless cheek.</p>

<p>Sometimes they lingered to chatter around him, or bring out pie
and cake to eat in his company. But very soon his gaze became
remote, and the children understood that they were at liberty
to go, which they did, dancing happily away into the outer sunshine,
on pleasure bent&mdash;the matchless pleasures of the very young whose
poverty has not as yet disturbed them.</p>

<p>As the summer passed the sunlight grew greyer to Peter Greensleeve.
Also, more often, he mixed his words and made nonsense of what
he said.</p>

<p>The pain in his chest and arms which for a year had caused him
discomfort, bothered him at night, now. He said nothing about
it.</p>

<p>That summer Doris had taken a course in stenography and typewriting,
going every day to Brooklyn by train and returning before sunset.</p>

<p>When school began she asked to be allowed to continue. Catharine,
too, desired to learn. And if their father understood very clearly
what they wanted, it is uncertain. Anyway he offered no objections.</p>

<p>That winter he saw his son very seldom. Perhaps the boy was busy.
Once or twice he came to ask his father for money, but there was
none to give him,&mdash;very little for anybody&mdash;and Doris and Catharine
required that.</p>

<p>Some little money was taken in at the Hotel Greensleeve; commercial
men were rather numerous that winter: so were duck-hunters. Athalie
often saw them stamping around in the bar, the lamplight glistening
on their oil-skins and gun-barrels, and touching the silken plumage
of dead ducks&mdash;great strings of them lying on the bar or on the
floor.</p>

<p>Once when she came home from school earlier than usual, she went
into the kitchen and found a hot peach turnover awaiting her,
constructed for her by the slovenly cook, and kept hot by the
still more slovenly maid-of-all-work&mdash;the only servants at the
Hotel Greensleeve.</p>

<p>Sauntering back through the house, eating her turnover, she noticed
Mr. Ledlie reading his newspaper in the office and her father
apparently asleep on a chair before the stove.</p>

<p>There were half a dozen guests at the inn, duck-hunters from
New York, but they were evidently still out with their bay-men.</p>

<p>Nibbling her pastry Athalie loitered along the hall and deposited
her strapped books on a chair under the noisy wall-clock. Then,
at hazard, she wandered into the bar. It was growing dusky; nobody
had lighted the ceiling lamp.</p>

<p>At first she thought the room was empty, and had strolled over
toward the stove to warm her snow-wet shoes, when all at once
she became aware of a boy.</p>

<p>The boy was lying back on a leather chair, stockinged feet crossed,
hands in his pocket, looking at her. He wore the leather shooting
clothes of a duck-hunter; on the floor beside him lay his cap,
oil-skins, hip-boots, and his gun. A red light from the stove
fell across his dark, curly hair and painted one side of his face
crimson.</p>

<p>Athalie, surprised, was not, however, in the least disturbed
or embarrassed. She looked calmly at the boy, at the woollen stockings
on his feet.</p>

<p>"Did you manage to get dry?" she asked in a friendly voice.</p>

<p>Then he seemed to come to himself. He took his hands from his
pockets and got up on his stockinged feet.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm dry now."</p>

<p>"Did you have any luck?"</p>

<p>"I got fifteen&mdash;counting shell-drake, two redheads, a black duck,
and some buffle-heads."</p>

<p>"Where were you shooting?"</p>

<p>"Off Silver Shoal."</p>

<p>"Who was your bay-man?"</p>

<p>"Bill Nostrand."</p>

<p>"Why did you stop shooting so early?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen is the local limit this year."</p>

<p>Athalie nodded and bit into her turnover, reflectively. When
she looked up, something in the boy's eye interested her.</p>

<p>"Are you hungry?" she asked.</p>

<p>He looked embarrassed, then laughed: "Yes, I am."</p>

<p>"Wait; I'll get you a turnover," she said.</p>

<p>When she returned from the kitchen with his turnover he was standing.
Rather vaguely she comprehended this civility toward herself although
nobody had ever before remained standing for her.</p>

<p>Not knowing exactly what to do or say she silently presented
the pastry, then drew a chair up into the red firelight. And the
boy seated himself.</p>

<p>"I suppose you came with those hunters from New York," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes. I came with my father and three of his friends."</p>

<p>"They are out still I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes. They went over to Brant Point."</p>

<p>"I've often sailed there," remarked Athalie. "Can you sail a
boat?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"It is easy.... I could teach you if you are going to stay a
while."</p>

<p>"We are going back to New York to-morrow morning.... How did
you learn to sail a boat?"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know. I've always lived here. Mr. Ledlie has a
boat. Everybody here knows how to manage a cat-boat.... If you'll
come down this summer I'll teach you. Will you?"</p>

<p>"I will if I can."</p>

<p>They were silent for a few minutes. It grew very dark in the
bar-room, and the light from the stove glimmered redder and redder.</p>

<p>The boy and girl lay back in their chairs, lingering over their
peach pastry, and inspecting each other with all the frank insouciance
of childhood.</p>

<p>Athalie still wore the red hood and cloak which had represented
her outer winter wardrobe for years. Her dull, thick gold hair
curled crisply over the edges of the hood which framed in its
oval the lovely features of a child in perfect health.</p>

<p>The boy, dark-haired and dark-eyed, gazed fascinated and unembarrassed
at this golden blond visitor hooded and cloaked in scarlet.</p>

<p>"Does your father keep this hotel?" he asked after a pause.</p>

<p>"Yes. I am Athalie Greensleeve. What is your name?"</p>

<p>"C. Bailey, Junior."</p>

<p>"What is the <em>C</em> for?"</p>

<p>"Clive."</p>

<p>"Do you go to school?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I'm back for the holidays."</p>

<p>"Holidays," she repeated vaguely. "Oh, that's so. Christmas will
come day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>He nodded. "I think I'm going to have a new pair of guns, some
books, and a horse. What do you expect?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Athalie.</p>

<p>"What? Isn't there anything you want?" And then, too late, some
glimmer of the real state of affairs illuminated his boyish brain.
And he grew red with embarrassment.</p>

<p>They had finished their pastry; Athalie wiped her hands on a
soiled and ragged and crumpled handkerchief, then scrubbed her
scarlet mouth.</p>

<p>"I'd like to come down here for the summer vacation," said the
boy, awkwardly. "I don't know whether my mother would like it."</p>

<p>"Why? It is pleasant."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'I'd like to come down here for the summer vacation,'
said the boy, awkwardly."]</p>

<p>He glanced instinctively around him at the dark and shabby bar-room,
but offered no reason why his mother might not care for the Hotel
Greensleeve. One thing he knew; he meant to urge his mother to
come, or to let him come.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the outer door banged open and into the bar
came stamping four men and two bay-men, their oil-skins shining
with salt-spray, guns glistening. Thud! went the strings of dead
ducks on the floor; somebody scratched a match and lighted the
ceiling lamp.</p>

<p>"Hello, Junior!" cried one of the men in oil-skins,&mdash;"how did
you make out on Silver Shoals?"</p>

<p>"All right, father," he began; but his father had caught sight
of Athalie who had risen to retreat.</p>

<p>"Who are you, young lady?" he inquired with a jolly smile,&mdash;"are
you little Red-Riding Hood or the Princess Far Away, or perhaps
the Sleeping Beauty recently awakened?"</p>

<p>"I'm Athalie Greensleeve."</p>

<p>"Lady Greensleeves! I <em>knew</em> you were somebody quite as
distinguished as you are beautiful. Would you mind saying to Mr.
Greensleeve that there is much moaning on the bar, and that it
will still continue until he arrives to instil the stillness of
the still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"We merely want a drink, my child. Don't look so seriously and
distractingly pretty. I was joking, that's all. Please tell your
father how very thirsty we are."</p>

<p>As the child turned to obey, C. Bailey, Sr., put one big arm
around her shoulders: "I didn't mean to tease you on such short
acquaintance," he whispered. "Are you offended, little Lady Greensleeves?"</p>

<p>Athalie looked up at him in puzzled silence.</p>

<p>"Smile, just once, so I shall know I am forgiven," he said. "Will
you?"</p>

<p>The child smiled confusedly, caught the boy's eye, and smiled
again, most engagingly, at C. Bailey, Sr.'s, son.</p>

<p>"Oho!" exclaimed the senior Bailey laughingly and looking at
his son, "I'm forgiven for your sake, am I?"</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, Clive," protested one of the gunners, "let
the little girl go and find her father. If I ever needed a drink
it's now!"</p>

<p>So Athalie went away to summon her father. She found him as she
had last noticed him, sitting asleep on the big leather office
chair. Ledlie, behind the desk, was still reading his soiled newspaper,
which he continued to do until Athalie cried out something in
a frightened voice. Then he laid aside his paper, blinked at her,
got up leisurely and shuffled over to where his partner was sitting
dead on his leather chair.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The duck-hunters left that night. One after another the four
gentlemen came over to speak to Athalie and to her sisters. There
was some confusion and crowding in the hallway, what with the
doctor, the undertaker's assistants, neighbours, and the New York
duck-hunters.</p>

<p>Ledlie ventured to overcharge them on the bill. As nobody objected
he regretted his moderation. However, the taking off of Greensleeve
helped business in the bar where sooner or later everybody drifted.</p>

<p>When the four-seated livery wagon drove up to take the gunning
party to the train, the boy lingered behind the others and then
hurried back to where Athalie was standing, white-faced, tearless,
staring at the closed door of the room where they had taken her
father.</p>

<p>Bailey Junior's touch on her arm made her turn: "I am sorry,"
he said. "I hope you will not be very unhappy.... And&mdash;here is
a Christmas present&mdash;"</p>

<p>He took the dazed child's icy little hand in his, and, fumbling
the business rather awkwardly, he finally contrived to snap a
strap-watch over the delicate wrist. It was the one he had been
wearing.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Athalie," he murmured, very red.</p>

<p>The girl gazed at him out of her lovely confused eyes for a moment.
But when she tried to speak no sound came.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said again, choking slightly. "I'll surely, surely
come back to see you. Don't be unhappy. I'll come."</p>

<p>But it was many years before he returned to the Hotel Greensleeve.</p>
