<p>That fate which had seemed to favor the three audacious youngsters
did not desert them when the critical point in their enterprise
arrived.</p>

<p>The chief of police was wise in restraining any hint of what
was in his mind to the parents of Tommy Wagstaff. It would have
been repelled with wrath and made them enemies—all the more bitter,
perhaps, when it should appear that the wise officer was right.</p>

<p>The youngster, having suffered so cruelly, received every compensation
his friends could give him. His father reproved himself for making
him stay home from the concert. Had he taken him with him, the
outrage never could have occurred.</p>

<p>The mother heaped favors upon her darling Tommy, who might have
luxuriated for weeks on the general sympathy felt for him. He
was visited by several newspaper reporters, who took down the
thrilling account from his own lips. The chief trouble in these
cases was the wide variance in the versions given by the lad.
In some instances he insisted there were three burglars, in others
only two, while to one young man in spectacles, he solemnly averred
that there were seven by actual count, and that they were all
armed with tomahawks and scalping knives. These wild statements
were attributed to the lad’s nervousness instead of to the real
cause.</p>

<p>But on the next afternoon, or rather evening, Tommy did not make
his appearance at supper. The mother was greatly frightened and
believed the robbers had returned to revenge themselves upon her
darling for telling the truth about them.</p>

<p>Before the evening was late, Mr. Wagstaff learned that Tommy,
accompanied by Billy Waylett and Jimmy McGovern, had been seen
hurrying in the direction of the railway station. Inquiry there
revealed the fact all three had bought tickets for New York.</p>

<p>About this time a dim suspicion took shape in the mind of Mr.
Wagstaff. He gave no hint to his wife, but he telegraphed the
authorities in the metropolis to look out for three boys, and
to arrest them at once and communicate with their parents, Messrs.
Waylett and McGovern having joined in the request.</p>

<p>New York was so near Ashton that the runaways arrived there more
than an hour before the telegram was sent, otherwise they would
have been returned to their homes the same evening.</p>

<p>Their fathers next held a conference, and on the following day
applied to the chief of police for counsel. That gentleman listened
grimly to them, and then quietly said that the robbery of Mr.
Wagstaff’s home had been planned and carried out by the three
lads without help from any one else. They were shocked, but when
he showed Billy Waylett’s handkerchief, which had been used to
check the utterance of Tommy, and pointed out the numerous tell-tale
slips made by the boys, especially the shooting through the windows,
they were convinced, and became eager to capture them at the earliest
possible moment, each parent declaring that the instant his son
was brought within reach, he would give him a trouncing that he
would remember to his dying day.</p>

<p>It was arranged that Chief Hungerford should undertake to hunt
them up, and he readily agreed to do so, for the gentlemen were
warm friends of his, for whom he was ready to make any reasonable
sacrifice.</p>

<p>And now that a pursuer is on the trail of the runaways, let us
see how they got along.</p>

<p>The indulgence shown Tommy by his parents gave him just the opportunity
he wanted. He was able to hold several meetings with his intended
partners, without any one suspecting what was going on, and the
arrangements were made for starting for New York on the afternoon
following the supposed robbery.</p>

<p>In one respect, the lads showed a wisdom beyond their years.
Knowing that prompt search would be made for them, and that they
were likely to be looked upon with suspicion, they decided to
leave the stolen jewelry where it had been placed beneath the
old stump. If worse came to worse, they could return and draw
upon it, but if they should try to sell the valuables in New York,
they would be arrested on suspicion.</p>

<p>So they wisely left the jewelry behind, and took with them only
a single gold watch, which Tommy wore, since it was the property
of his father. They found that they had fully a hundred dollars
in money, which, as nearly as they could learn, would carry them
most of the distance they wished to go, when such bright chaps
would have no trouble in hitting upon the means for raising the
wind.</p>

<p>Since they expected to meet Snakeroot Sam, it was intended to
send him back to Ashton, to sell the plunder for them, inasmuch
as he could readily do it without danger, and was so honest that
he would turn over every penny of the proceeds to them.</p>

<p>Reaching New York ahead of the telegram, they were too wise to
linger around the large station at Forty-second Street. More than
likely, all three of their irate fathers would be there in the
course of an hour or two, and it was, therefore, no place for
them.</p>

<p>Since it was growing dark, they decided to put up at some obscure
hotel, under assumed names, and make an early start for the West.
The wisdom shown by the lads was astonishing—the oldest of whom
had not seen fourteen years. They had talked and discussed the
venture for months, and stored their minds with all the information
obtainable. Consequently, when they sauntered out on the street,
and, after some inquiries, reached Broadway, they attracted no
special attention. They were well dressed, and the additional
revolvers which they speedily bought were carried out of sight,
so that there was no noticeable difference between them and the
hundreds of other boys who may be met on any day in the great
metropolis of our country.</p>

<p>Billy Waylett, being the youngest, needed some coaching, but
he was tractable, and the lads were fortunate enough to escape
the sharks that are always waiting in the large cities for just
such prey as they would have proved.</p>

<p>The only thing that worried Tommy Wagstaff was the fact that
he did not know how to find Snakeroot Sam. That worthy had been
told of the intended start for the West, but, of course, the leader
could not give him the precise date of their departure. It was
known, however, that he spent a good deal of his time in New York
city, and the leader of the party instructed his companions to
keep a sharp lookout for him. They did so, but though they pointed
out several persons who answered his description, none of them
proved to be the individual they were so anxious to meet, and
who, doubtless, would have blessed his lucky stars could he have
met them.</p>

<p>Tommy Wagstaff was satisfied that the crisis in their enterprise
would come when they reached the ferry to buy their railway tickets.
Officers would be on the watch for them, and if the three should
present themselves at the office and pay their fare to Chicago
or some other Western point, they were quite sure to be stopped
and compelled to give an account of themselves.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he arranged the matter with the shrewdness he had
shown from the first. They separated at the foot of Cortlandt
Street and made their way into the railway office, as though they
were strangers to each other. Billy had enough money to buy a
ticket to New Brunswick, and Jimmy to procure one to Trenton,
while Tommy, who had taken charge of the entire funds, paid his
fare to Philadelphia. Then they passed through the narrow gateway
upon the ferryboat.</p>

<p>The three were alarmed by the sight of a blue-coated policeman,
standing at the broad entrance to the ferry, and who scrutinized
them sharply as they joined the swarm hurrying upon the boat.
The officer followed Billy with his eyes, and seemed on the point
of starting after him. The youngster’s heart was in his throat,
and he wished that something would blow up and scatter everybody
so far apart that no policeman could see him.</p>

<p>So guarded were the boys they did not speak to each other while
crossing the ferry, indulging in only an occasional sly glance,
as they stepped off the boat and passed up the slip.</p>

<p>Here they were startled again, for the big policeman near the
passageway to the trains, after one keen look at Billy, asked
him where he was going.</p>

<p>"To New Brunswick," was the slightly tremulous reply.</p>

<p>"Let me see your ticket," was the gruff command.</p>

<p>Billy fished out the pasteboard and showed it to the terrible
fellow, who was not yet satisfied.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in New York?"</p>

<p>"I aint in New York; I am in Jersey City."</p>

<p>The officer smiled at the manner in which he had tripped, and
asked:</p>

<p>"Where are the other two boys that came with you?"</p>

<p>Billy came nigh breaking down. He saw Tommy and Jimmy watching
him from a little way, and his naturally quick wit came to his
relief.</p>

<p>"What two boys are you talking ’bout? Don’t you see there’s nobody
with me, and if you keep me much longer, I’ll miss the train,
and father will be mad, ’cause he expects me to be home as soon
as I can get there."</p>

<p>The urchin made as if to move forward, and the officer, satisfied
he was not the one for whom he was looking, allowed him to pass
on.</p>

<p>After entering the car, Tommy Wagstaff saw no risk in their companionship.
Since the train was not crowded, he and Billy sat together, while
Jimmy McGovern placed himself on the seat in front, where no one
shared it with him.</p>

<p>There was a bustle and novelty about this business which kept
the boys in such a constant state of excitement that they had
felt nothing as yet like homesickness. In fact, they were eager
to get forward, and though there was much to see that was new
and strange, they would have been glad could the cars have traveled
with double the speed.</p>

<p>"The way I figure it out," said the leader, feeling now that
he could talk freely, since they were well under way, "is that
we shall reach Philadelphia before noon. Jiminy! but that is traveling
fast; shall we get off there and stay over till to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"What would we do that for?" demanded young McGovern.</p>

<p>"There’s so much to see that I didn’t know but what you would
like to stop and look around."</p>

<p>"Not much," replied Jimmy, with a disgusted shake of his head;
"we can’t get out West soon enough to suit me; I feel hungry for
Injins and grizzly bears: how is it with you, Billy?"</p>

<p>"That’s me, clear through; you know we’ve got to get a Winchester
apiece, and then we’ll be ready to begin popping over Injins;
that’ll be more fun than anything else in the world, and what
do I care for all the cities and strange things that’s between
us and the West?"</p>

<p>Tommy laughed, for he was pleased.</p>

<p>"That’s just the way I feel, but I didn’t know whether you two
was right up to the handle yet; I’m glad you are; it proves that
we are bound to win, like real brave American boys."</p>

<p>All three smiled approvingly on each other, and, glancing out
of the window, wished the cars would run at the rate of two miles
a minute, for the rest of the distance.</p>

<p>The conductor came through, punched the tickets, and took up
Billy’s, because it entitled him to ride only to New Brunswick.
He intended to slip off there and buy one to Philadelphia, while
Jimmy would do the same at Trenton. If the Quaker City were reached
without mishap, they would conclude that all danger of being stopped
was over, and from that point would travel openly and without
fear.</p>

<p>The little party chatted and discussed their plans, sometimes
speaking so loud in their ardor that the gentleman sitting just
across the aisle overhead their words and looked curiously at
them more than once, over the top of his paper.</p>

<p>Just before reaching the long trestle-work which spans the Raritan,
Billy said:</p>

<p>"We must be pretty near New Brunswick, Tom, and I guess you had
better give me enough money to buy a ticket: how much will it
be?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know; I s’pose two or three dollars; you ought to travel
on half fare, but it aint worth bothering about; we’ll gather
in all the funds we want in Chicago."</p>

<p>"It strikes me," remarked McGovern, "that we might as well divide
up the money, so that if any one loses his share, we won’t be
in a bad fix."</p>

<p>"I guess that would be a good plan," replied Tommy, who reached
in his trousers pocket for the roll of bills which he had placed
there.</p>

<p>He started and turned pale the next moment, and hurriedly ran
his hand in his other pocket. Then he sprang to his feet and frantically
searched the pockets of his coat and vest.</p>

<p>"What’s the matter?" asked Jimmy, with a sinking of the heart.</p>

<p>"The money is gone!" was the alarming answer.</p>

<p>"No; that can’t be!" faintly exclaimed Billy; "it must be somewhere
about you."</p>

<p>"I put the roll in <em>that</em>, pocket," replied Tommy, who
kept up his search, through all the receptacles, again and again.
Then he stooped down, and hunted under the seats with a nervous
distress which was fully shared by his companions.</p>

<p>Finally he straightened up and said, despairingly:</p>

<p>"My pocket has been picked, and we haven’t a dollar among us."</p>

<p>He spoke the truth.</p>
