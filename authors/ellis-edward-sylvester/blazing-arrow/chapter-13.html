<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Blazing Arrow possessed the subtlety of a serpent and the cunning
of a fox. Underneath his actions lay his unextinguishable hatred
of the white race. His anger against it seemed always to be flaming
at white heat.</p>

<p>But the slyest and wisest of animals and men are liable at times
to overreach themselves. Had the imp been content with what was
unquestionably a remarkable exploit he would have held Wharton
Edwards at his mercy, but he must needs spoil all by his attempt
to make assurance doubly sure.</p>

<p>He had not seen the youth after he watched him disappear across
the clearing where the back trail entered the woods. He never
suspected that he was not on his front on the return, and failed
to see his last leap across the torrent. Confident, however, that
he was not far off, he began a search for him, with the hope of
getting matters in better shape before rejoining his comrades
with an account of his experience.</p>

<p>It happened, therefore, that when young Edwards made his dove-call
to Larry Murphy, Blazing Arrow was so near that he heard it. He
knew that it came from none of his people, and consequently must
be from one of the whites.</p>

<p>With extraordinary cleverness he replied by several notes, whose
resemblance to those causing them was so wonderfully close as
to be perfect. Fearful, however, that he might not have hit the
exact note, he repeated the call.</p>

<p>And in doing so he made the fatal blunder. One of the unchangeable
laws governing Wharton Edwards and Larry Murphy at such times
was that under no circumstances was either to repeat a signal
without a minute or two interval. It was the violation of this
rule that apprised the youth of his peril and gave him time to
save himself.</p>

<p>Suspecting that it was Blazing Arrow who was near, Wharton retreated
farther into the wood. In making the movement he used all the
caution he could, and believed that no one had overheard him.
What followed looked as though he was right in the conclusion,
for the Indian, without moving from his tracks, signalled again,
making the same mistake as before by repeating it, in his effort
to repress his impatience at the delay in the response.</p>

<p>"I don't think I'll be in a hurry to open a conversation with
you," thought Wharton; "I'm looking for somebody else."</p>

<p>He was still in a dangerous situation, however, and continued
edging away from the locality where he had come so near falling
a victim to the resentment of the warrior, who was among the most
cunning of his tribe. Wharton's heart sank when, despite the extreme
care he used, he caught his foot in a running vine and narrowly
escaped falling. He instantly straightened up and waited for the
attack that he was sure was coming; but, as the minutes passed,
he concluded the Indian was already so far off that the slight
rustling did not reach him. It was probable that the Shawanoe,
in trying to outwit the youth, had moved away from him, and the
two were now separated by a considerable space.</p>

<p>How was it that this Indian was in possession of the signal which
the two youths used when in danger?</p>

<p>In the case of Wharton, however, there was little of the anxiety
of his friend. The latter heard the call before emitting it himself,
so that it was impossible that Blazing Arrow should have got it
from him; and, since Wharton Edwards was the only other person
that possessed it, the misgiving of the Irish lad was warranted.</p>

<p>But with Wharton the case was different. Blazing Arrow's signal
succeeded his, and, therefore, was but a clever imitation.</p>

<p>"It may be that he got it from Larry," reflected our young friend,
"but the chances are against it. Where can the fellow be?"</p>

<p>It was an exasperating reflection that for hours the work had
been of a blind nature, as may be said. The youths had been separated,
there had been a fierce race, fighting, and running back and forth,
and all manner of incidents, and yet matters stood as at the beginning.</p>

<p>While this was a cause for gratification in one respect, inasmuch
as the two were still safe from the most dreaded tribe of Indians
in the West, the disheartening fact was that the boys were just
where they were when the danger broke upon them. They had not
advanced a rod along the trail to the block-house, where Wharton's
parents would probably arrive that evening. The prospect was poor
for the boys appearing until long after the hour they were expected.</p>

<p>"We ought to have had an understanding before we separated; but
then," added Wharton disgustedly, "I don't see how we could, or
what good it would have done. Larry wouldn't leave as long as
he thought I was in trouble, and I'm sure I wouldn't desert him.
I wonder now&#11834;"</p>

<p>A new thought had come into his mind&mdash;that of withdrawing from
the neighborhood, making all haste to the block-house, and bringing
back aid. There was always a number of the most skilled rangers
of the frontier at this post, and they were ever ready to respond
to any call for help. Probably Daniel Boone or the great Simon
Kenton was at hand, with unerring rifle and marvellous woodcraft.</p>

<p>Wharton could reach the block-house before daylight, and be back
while the day was yet young, with his new friends. Learned in
the ways of the woods and the red men, they would quickly become
the hunters instead of the hunted, and teach the marauders a lesson
to be remembered forever.</p>

<p>Had the question presented itself as it did after his vanquishment
of Blazing Arrow, the youth would have continued his flight along
the trail, and been back with his friends before or by the time
the sun was on the horizon. As it was, he debated the question
a long time, and then decided not to continue the journey until
he gained some definite knowledge of Larry; his own movements
depended upon that. If the other had fallen, then Wharton should
not lose a moment hurrying away from the accursed neighborhood.
If his comrade was a prisoner of the Shawanoes, he must be equally
prompt in securing assistance, since he unaided could do no good;
but if the other was still his own master, then both would give
an exhibition of rapid travelling toward the block-house.</p>

<p>"No," said young Edwards, resolutely, "I don't go till I learn
something about Larry. I'll do just as he would do if in my place."</p>

<p>And he might have added, truthfully, "and just what he is doing
at this moment."</p>

<p>Manifestly there was but one way to learn the truth, and that
was by investigating, and the only way to investigate was to keep
moving, which he did.</p>

<p>The night was so far along that the Shawanoes were quite certain
to have kindled a camp-fire somewhere in the woods. This was their
custom, and it was this beacon light, as it may be called, for
which young Edwards now began hunting.</p>
