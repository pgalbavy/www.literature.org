'Now tell us what happened to you,' said Cyril to Jane, when he
and the others had told her all about the Queen's talk and the
banquet, and the variety entertainment, carefully stopping short
before the beginning of the dungeon part of the story.</p>

<p>'It wasn't much good going,' said Jane, 'if you didn't even try
to get the Amulet.'</p>

<p>'We found out it was no go,' said Cyril; 'it's not to be got in
Babylon.  It was lost before that.  We'll go to some other jolly
friendly place, where everyone is kind and pleasant, and look for
it there.  Now tell us about your part.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' said Jane, 'the Queen's man with the smooth face - what was
his name?'</p>

<p>'Ritti-Marduk,' said Cyril.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Jane, 'Ritti-Marduk, he came for me just after the
Psammead had bitten the guard-of-the-gate's wife's little boy,
and he took me to the Palace.  And we had supper with the new
little Queen from Egypt.  She is a dear - not much older than you. 
She told me heaps about Egypt.  And we played ball after supper.
And then the Babylon Queen sent for me.  I like her too.  And she
talked to the Psammead and I went to sleep.  And then you woke me
up.  That's all.'</p>

<p>The Psammead, roused from its sound sleep, told the same story.</p>

<p>'But,' it added, 'what possessed you to tell that Queen that I
could give wishes?  I sometimes think you were born without even
the most rudimentary imitation of brains.'</p>

<p>The children did not know the meaning of rudimentary, but it
sounded a rude, insulting word.</p>

<p>'I don't see that we did any harm,' said Cyril sulkily.</p>

<p>'Oh, no,' said the Psammead with withering irony, 'not at all! 
Of course not!  Quite the contrary!  Exactly so!  Only she
happened to wish that she might soon find herself in your
country.  And soon may mean any moment.'</p>

<p>'Then it's your fault,' said Robert, 'because you might just as
well have made &quot;soon&quot; mean some moment next year or next
century.'</p>

<p>'That's where you, as so often happens, make the mistake,'
rejoined the Sand-fairy.  '<span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> couldn't mean anything but what
SHE meant by &quot;soon&quot;.  It wasn't my wish.  And what SHE meant was
the next time the King happens to go out lion hunting.  So she'll
have a whole day, and perhaps two, to do as she wishes with.  SHE
doesn't know about time only being a mode of thought.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Cyril, with a sigh of resignation, 'we must do what
we can to give her a good time.  She was jolly decent to us.  I
say, suppose we were to go to St James's Park after dinner and
feed those ducks that we never did feed.  After all that Babylon
and all those years ago, I feel as if I should like to see
something REAL, and NOW.  You'll come, Psammead?'</p>

<p>'Where's my priceless woven basket of sacred rushes?' asked the
Psammead morosely.  'I can't go out with nothing on.  And I
won't, what's more.'</p>

<p>And then everybody remembered with pain that the bass bag had, in
the hurry of departure from Babylon, not been remembered.</p>

<p>'But it's not so extra precious,' said Robert hastily.  'You can
get them given to you for nothing if you buy fish in Farringdon
Market.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' said the Psammead very crossly indeed, 'so you presume on
my sublime indifference to the things of this disgusting modern
world, to fob me off with a travelling equipage that costs you
nothing.  Very well, I shall go to sand.  Please don't wake me.'</p>

<p>And it went then and there to sand, which, as you know, meant to
bed.  The boys went to St James's Park to feed the ducks, but
they went alone.</p>

<p>Anthea and Jane sat sewing all the afternoon.  They cut off half
a yard from each of their best green Liberty sashes.  A towel cut
in two formed a lining; and they sat and sewed and sewed and
sewed.  What they were making was a bag for the Psammead.  Each
worked at a half of the bag.  jane's half had four-leaved
shamrocks embroidered on it.  They were the only things she could
do (because she had been taught how at school, and, fortunately,
some of the silk she had been taught with was left over).  And
even so, Anthea had to draw the pattern for her.  Anthea's side
of the bag had letters on it - worked hastily but affectionately
in chain stitch.  They were something like this:</p>

<p>PSAMS TRAVEL CAR</p>

<p>She would have put 'travelling carriage', but she made the
letters too big, so there was no room.  The bag was made INTO a
bag with old Nurse's sewing machine, and the strings of it were
Anthea's and Jane's best red hair ribbons. At tea-time, when the
boys had come home with a most unfavourable report of the St
james's Park ducks, Anthea ventured to awaken the Psammead, and
to show it its new travelling bag.</p>

<p>'Humph,' it said, sniffing a little contemptuously, yet at the
same time affectionately, 'it's not so dusty.'</p>

<p>The Psammead seemed to pick up very easily the kind of things
that people said nowadays.  For a creature that had in its time
associated with Megatheriums and Pterodactyls, its quickness was
really wonderful.</p>

<p>'It's more worthy of me,' it said, 'than the kind of bag that's
given away with a pound of plaice.  When do you propose to take
me out in it?'</p>

<p>'I should like a rest from taking you or us anywhere,' said
Cyril.  But Jane said - </p>

<p>'I want to go to Egypt.  I did like that Egyptian Princess that
came to marry the King in Babylon.  She told me about the larks
they have in Egypt.  And the cats.  Do let's go there.  And I
told her what the bird things on the Amulet were like.  And she
said it was Egyptian writing.'</p>

<p>The others exchanged looks of silent rejoicing at the thought of
their cleverness in having concealed from Jane the terrors they
had suffered in the dungeon below the Euphrates.</p>

<p>'Egypt's so nice too,' Jane went on, 'because of Doctor Brewer's
Scripture History.  I would like to go there when Joseph was
dreaming those curious dreams, or when Moses was doing wonderful
things with snakes and sticks.'</p>

<p>'I don't care about snakes,' said Anthea shuddering.</p>

<p>'Well, we needn't be in at that part, but Babylon was lovely!  We
had cream and sweet, sticky stuff.  And I expect Egypt's the
same.'</p>

<p>There was a good deal of discussion, but it all ended in
everybody's agreeing to Jane's idea.  And next morning directly
after breakfast (which was kippers and very nice) the Psammead
was invited to get into his travelling carriage.</p>

<p>The moment after it had done so, with stiff, furry reluctance,
like that of a cat when you want to nurse it, and its ideas are
not the same as yours, old Nurse came in.</p>

<p>'Well, chickies,' she said, 'are you feeling very dull?'</p>

<p>'Oh, no, Nurse dear,' said Anthea; 'we're having a lovely time. 
We're just going off to see some old ancient relics.'</p>

<p>'Ah,' said old Nurse, 'the Royal Academy, I suppose?  Don't go
wasting your money too reckless, that's all.'</p>

<p>She cleared away the kipper bones and the tea-things, and when
she had swept up the crumbs and removed the cloth, the Amulet was
held up and the order given - just as Duchesses (and other people)
give it to their coachmen.</p>

<p>'To Egypt, please!' said Anthea, when Cyril had uttered the
wonderful Name of Power.</p>

<p>'When Moses was there,' added Jane.</p>

<p>And there, in the dingy Fitzroy Street dining-room, the Amulet
grew big, and it was an arch, and through it they saw a blue,
blue sky and a running river.</p>

<p>'No, stop!' said Cyril, and pulled down jane's hand with the
Amulet in it.</p>

<p>'What silly cuckoos we all are,' he said.  'Of course we can't
go.  We daren't leave home for a single minute now, for fear that
minute should be THE minute.'</p>

<p>'What minute be WHAT minute?' asked Jane impatiently, trying to
get her hand away from Cyril.</p>

<p>'The minute when the Queen of Babylon comes,' said Cyril.  And
then everyone saw it.</p>

<p>For some days life flowed in a very slow, dusty, uneventful
stream.</p>

<p>The children could never go out all at once, because they never
knew when the King of Babylon would go out lion hunting and leave
his Queen free to pay them that surprise visit to which she was,
without doubt, eagerly looking forward.</p>

<p>So they took it in turns, two and two, to go out and to stay in.</p>

<p>The stay-at-homes would have been much duller than they were but
for the new interest taken in them by the learned gentleman.</p>

<p>He called Anthea in one day to show her a beautiful necklace of
purple and gold beads.</p>

<p>'I saw one like that,' she said, 'in - '</p>

<p>'In the British Museum, perhaps?'</p>

<p>'I like to call the place where I saw it Babylon,' said Anthea
cautiously.</p>

<p>'A pretty fancy,' said the learned gentleman, 'and quite correct
too, because, as a matter of fact, these beads did come from
Babylon.' The other three were all out that day.  The boys had
been going to the Zoo, and Jane had said so plaintively, 'I'm
sure I am fonder of rhinoceroses than either of you are,' that
Anthea had told her to run along then.  And she had run, catching
the boys before that part of the road where Fitzroy Street
suddenly becomes Fitzroy Square.</p>

<p>'I think Babylon is most frightfully interesting,' said Anthea. 
'I do have such interesting dreams about it - at least, not dreams
exactly, but quite as wonderful.'</p>

<p>'Do sit down and tell me,' said he.  So she sat down and told. 
And he asked her a lot of questions, and she answered them as
well as she could.</p>

<p>'Wonderful - wonderful!' he said at last.  'One's heard of
thought-transference, but I never thought <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> had any power of
that sort.  Yet it must be that, and very bad for YOU, I should
think.  Doesn't your head ache very much?'</p>

<p>He suddenly put a cold, thin hand on her forehead.</p>

<p>'No thank you, not at all,' said she.</p>

<p>'I assure you it is not done intentionally,' he went on.  'Of
course I know a good deal about Babylon, and I unconsciously
communicate it to you; you've heard of thought-reading, but some
of the things you say, I don't understand; they never enter my
head, and yet they're so astoundingly probable.'</p>

<p>'It's all right,' said Anthea reassuringly.  '<span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> understand. 
And don't worry.  It's all quite simple really.'</p>

<p>It was not quite so simple when Anthea, having heard the others
come in, went down, and before she had had time to ask how they
had liked the Zoo, heard a noise outside, compared to which the
wild beasts' noises were gentle as singing birds.</p>

<p>'Good gracious!' cried Anthea, 'what's that?'</p>

<p>The loud hum of many voices came through the open window.  Words
could be distinguished.</p>

<p>''Ere's a guy!'</p>

<p>'This ain't November.  That ain't no guy.  It's a ballet lady,
that's what it is.'</p>

<p>'Not it - it's a bloomin' looney, I tell you.'</p>

<p>Then came a clear voice that they knew.</p>

<p>'Retire, slaves!' it said.</p>

<p>'What's she a saying of?' cried a dozen voices. 'Some blamed
foreign lingo,' one voice replied.</p>

<p>The children rushed to the door.  A crowd was on the road and
pavement.</p>

<p>In the middle of the crowd, plainly to be seen from the top of
the steps, were the beautiful face and bright veil of the
Babylonian Queen.</p>

<p>'Jimminy!' cried Robert, and ran down the steps, 'here she is!'</p>

<p>'Here!' he cried, 'look out - let the lady pass.  She's a friend
of ours, coming to see us.'</p>

<p>'Nice friend for a respectable house,' snorted a fat woman with
marrows on a handcart.</p>

<p>All the same the crowd made way a little.  The Queen met Robert
on the pavement, and Cyril joined them, the Psammead bag still on
his arm.</p>

<p>'Here,' he whispered; 'here's the Psammead; you can get wishes.'</p>

<p>'<span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> wish you'd come in a different dress, if you HAD to come,'
said Robert; 'but it's no use my wishing anything.'</p>

<p>'No,' said the Queen.  'I wish I was dressed - no, I don't - I wish
THEY were dressed properly, then they wouldn't be so silly.'</p>

<p>The Psammead blew itself out till the bag was a very tight fit
for it; and suddenly every man, woman, and child in that crowd
felt that it had not enough clothes on.  For, of course, the
Queen's idea of proper dress was the dress that had been proper
for the working-classes 3,000 years ago in Babylon - and there was
not much of it.</p>

<p>'Lawky me!' said the marrow-selling woman, 'whatever could a-took
me to come out this figure?' and she wheeled her cart away very
quickly indeed.</p>

<p>'Someone's made a pretty guy of you - talk of guys,' said a man
who sold bootlaces.</p>

<p>'Well, don't you talk,' said the man next to him.  'Look at your
own silly legs; and where's your boots?'</p>

<p>'I never come out like this, I'll take my sacred,' said the
bootlace-seller.  'I wasn't quite myself last night, I'll own,
but not to dress up like a circus.'</p>

<p>The crowd was all talking at once, and getting rather angry.  But
no one seemed to think of blaming the Queen.</p>

<p>Anthea bounded down the steps and pulled her up; the others
followed, and the door was shut. 'Blowed if I can make it out!'
they heard.  'I'm off home, I am.'</p>

<p>And the crowd, coming slowly to the same mind, dispersed,
followed by another crowd of persons who were not dressed in what
the Queen thought was the proper way.</p>

<p>'We shall have the police here directly,' said Anthea in the
tones of despair.  'Oh, why did you come dressed like that?'</p>

<p>The Queen leaned against the arm of the horse-hair sofa.</p>

<p>'How else can a queen dress I should like to know?' she
questioned.</p>

<p>'Our Queen wears things like other people,' said Cyril.</p>

<p>'Well, I don't.  And I must say,' she remarked in an injured
tone, 'that you don't seem very glad to see me now I HAVE come. 
But perhaps it's the surprise that makes you behave like this. 
Yet you ought to be used to surprises.  The way you vanished!  I
shall never forget it.  The best magic I've ever seen.  How did
you do it?'</p>

<p>'Oh, never mind about that now,' said Robert.  'You see you've
gone and upset all those people, and I expect they'll fetch the
police.  And we don't want to see you collared and put in
prison.'</p>

<p>'You can't put queens in prison,' she said loftily. 'Oh, can't
you?' said Cyril.  'We cut off a king's head here once.'</p>

<p>'In this miserable room?  How frightfully interesting.'</p>

<p>'No, no, not in this room; in history.'</p>

<p>'Oh, in THAT,' said the Queen disparagingly.  'I thought you'd
done it with your own hands.'</p>

<p>The girls shuddered.</p>

<p>'What a hideous city yours is,' the Queen went on pleasantly,
'and what horrid, ignorant people.  Do you know they actually
can't understand a single word I say.'</p>

<p>'Can you understand them?' asked Jane.</p>

<p>'Of course not; they speak some vulgar, Northern dialect.  I can
understand YOU quite well.'</p>

<p>I really am not going to explain AGAIN how it was that the
children could understand other languages than their own so
thoroughly, and talk them, too, so that it felt and sounded (to
them) just as though they were talking English.</p>

<p>'Well,' said Cyril bluntly, 'now you've seen just how horrid it
is, don't you think you might as well go home again?' 'Why, I've
seen simply nothing yet,' said the Queen, arranging her starry
veil.  'I wished to be at your door, and I was.  Now I must go
and see your King and Queen.'</p>

<p>'Nobody's allowed to,' said Anthea in haste; 'but look here,
we'll take you and show you anything you'd like to see - anything
you CAN see,' she added kindly, because she remembered how nice
the Queen had been to them in Babylon, even if she had been a
little deceitful in the matter of Jane and Psammead.</p>

<p>'There's the Museum,' said Cyril hopefully; 'there are lots of
things from your country there.  If only we could disguise you a
little.'</p>

<p>'I know,' said Anthea suddenly.  'Mother's old theatre cloak, and
there are a lot of her old hats in the big box.'</p>

<p>The blue silk, lace-trimmed cloak did indeed hide some of the
Queen's startling splendours, but the hat fitted very badly.  It
had pink roses in it; and there was something about the coat or
the hat or the Queen, that made her look somehow not very
respectable.</p>

<p>'Oh, never mind,' said Anthea, when Cyril whispered this.  'The
thing is to get her out before Nurse has finished her forty
winks.  I should think she's about got to the thirty-ninth wink
by now.'</p>

<p>'Come on then,' said Robert.  'You know how dangerous it is. 
Let's make haste into the Museum.  If any of those people you
made guys of do fetch the police, they won't think of looking for
you there.'</p>

<p>The blue silk coat and the pink-rosed hat attracted almost as
much attention as the royal costume had done; and the children
were uncommonly glad to get out of the noisy streets into the
grey quiet of the Museum.</p>

<p>'Parcels and umbrellas to be left here,' said a man at the
counter.</p>

<p>The party had no umbrellas, and the only parcel was the bag
containing the Psammead, which the Queen had insisted should be
brought.</p>

<p>'I'M not going to be left,' said the Psammead softly, 'so don't
you think it.'</p>

<p>'I'll wait outside with you,' said Anthea hastily, and went to
sit on the seat near the drinking fountain.</p>

<p>'Don't sit so near that nasty fountain,' said the creature
crossly; 'I might get splashed.'</p>

<p>Anthea obediently moved to another seat and waited.  Indeed she
waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited.  The
Psammead dropped into an uneasy slumber.  Anthea had long ceased
to watch the swing-door that always let out the wrong person, and
she was herself almost asleep, and still the others did not come
back.</p>

<p>It was quite a start when Anthea suddenly realized that they HAD
come back, and that they were not alone.  Behind them was quite a
crowd of men in uniform, and several gentlemen were there. 
Everyone seemed very angry.</p>

<p>'Now go,' said the nicest of the angry gentlemen.  'Take the
poor, demented thing home and tell your parents she ought to be
properly looked after.'</p>

<p>'If you can't get her to go we must send for the police,' said
the nastiest gentleman.</p>

<p>'But we don't wish to use harsh measures,' added the nice one,
who was really very nice indeed, and seemed to be over all the
others.</p>

<p>'May I speak to my sister a moment first?' asked Robert.</p>

<p>The nicest gentleman nodded, and the officials stood round the
Queen, the others forming a sort of guard while Robert crossed
over to Anthea.</p>

<p>'Everything you can think of,' he replied to Anthea's glance of
inquiry.  'Kicked up the most frightful shine in there.  Said
those necklaces and earrings and things in the glass cases were
all hers - would have them out of the cases.  Tried to break the
glass - she did break one bit!  Everybody in the place has been at
her.  No good.  I only got her out by telling her that was the
place where they cut queens' heads off.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Bobs, what a whacker!'</p>

<p>'You'd have told a whackinger one to get her out.  Besides, it
wasn't.  I meant MUMMY queens.  How do you know they don't cut
off mummies' heads to see how the embalming is done?  What I want
to say is, can't you get her to go with you quietly?'</p>

<p>'I'll try,' said Anthea, and went up to the Queen.</p>

<p>'Do come home,' she said; 'the learned gentleman in our house has
a much nicer necklace than anything they've got here.  Come and
see it.'</p>

<p>The Queen nodded.</p>

<p>'You see,' said the nastiest gentleman, 'she does understand
English.'</p>

<p>'I was talking Babylonian, I think,' said Anthea bashfully.</p>

<p>'My good child,' said the nice gentleman, 'what you're talking is
not Babylonian, but nonsense.  You just go home at once, and tell
your parents exactly what has happened.'</p>

<p>Anthea took the Queen's hand and gently pulled her away.  The
other children followed, and the black crowd of angry gentlemen
stood on the steps watching them.  It was when the little party
of disgraced children, with the Queen who had disgraced them, had
reached the middle of the courtyard that her eyes fell on the bag
where the Psammead was.  She stopped short.</p>

<p>'I wish,' she said, very loud and clear, 'that all those
Babylonian things would come out to me here - slowly, so that
those dogs and slaves can see the working of the great Queen's
magic.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you ARE a tiresome woman,' said the Psammead in its bag, but
it puffed itself out.</p>

<p>Next moment there was a crash.  The glass swing doors and all
their framework were smashed suddenly and completely.  The crowd
of angry gentlemen sprang aside when they saw what had done this.</p>

<p>But the nastiest of them was not quick enough, and he was roughly
pushed out of the way by an enormous stone bull that was floating
steadily through the door.  It came and stood beside the Queen in
the middle of the courtyard.</p>

<p>It was followed by more stone images, by great slabs of carved
stone, bricks, helmets, tools, weapons, fetters, wine-jars,
bowls, bottles, vases, jugs, saucers, seals, and the round long
things, something like rolling pins with marks on them like the
print of little bird-feet, necklaces, collars, rings, armlets,
earrings - heaps and heaps and heaps of things, far more than
anyone had time to count, or even to see distinctly.</p>

<p>All the angry gentlemen had abruptly sat down on the Museum steps
except the nice one.  He stood with his hands in his pockets just
as though he was quite used to seeing great stone bulls and all
sorts of small Babylonish objects float out into the Museum yard.</p>

<p>But he sent a man to close the big iron gates.</p>

<p>A journalist, who was just leaving the museum, spoke to Robert as
he passed.</p>

<p>'Theosophy, I suppose?' he said.  'Is she Mrs Besant?'</p>

<p>'YES,' said Robert recklessly.</p>

<p>The journalist passed through the gates just before they were
shut.</p>

<p>He rushed off to Fleet Street, and his paper got out a new
edition within half an hour.</p>

<blockquote><div>MRS BESANT AND THEOSOPHY<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>IMPERTINENT MIRACLE AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>People saw it in fat, black letters on the boards carried by the
sellers of newspapers.  Some few people who had nothing better to
do went down to the Museum on the tops of omnibuses.  But by the
time they got there there was nothing to be seen.  For the
Babylonian Queen had suddenly seen the closed gates, had felt the
threat of them, and had said - </p>

<p>'I wish we were in your house.'</p>

<p>And, of course, instantly they were.</p>

<p>The Psammead was furious.</p>

<p>'Look here,' it said, 'they'll come after you, and they'll find
ME.  There'll be a National Cage built for me at Westminster, and
I shall have to work at politics.  Why wouldn't you leave the
things in their places?'</p>

<p>'What a temper you have, haven't you?' said the Queen serenely. 
'I wish all the things were back in their places.  Will THAT do
for you?'</p>

<p>The Psammead swelled and shrank and spoke very angrily.</p>

<p>'I can't refuse to give your wishes,' it said, 'but I can Bite. 
And I will if this goes on.  Now then.'</p>

<p>'Ah, don't,' whispered Anthea close to its bristling ear; 'it's
dreadful for us too.  Don't YOU desert us.  Perhaps she'll wish
herself at home again soon.'</p>

<p>'Not she,' said the Psammead a little less crossly.</p>

<p>'Take me to see your City,' said the Queen.</p>

<p>The children looked at each other.</p>

<p>'If we had some money we could take her about in a cab.  People
wouldn't notice her so much then.  But we haven't.'</p>

<p>'Sell this,' said the Queen, taking a ring from her finger.</p>

<p>'They'd only think we'd stolen it,' said Cyril bitterly, 'and put
us in prison.'</p>

<p>'All roads lead to prison with you, it seems,' said the Queen.</p>

<p>'The learned gentleman!' said Anthea, and ran up to him with the
ring in her hand.</p>

<p>'Look here,' she said, 'will you buy this for a pound?'</p>

<p>'Oh!' he said in tones of joy and amazement, and took the ring
into his hand. 'It's my very own,' said Anthea; 'it was given to
me to sell.'</p>

<p>'I'll lend you a pound,' said the learned gentleman, 'with
pleasure; and I'll take care of the ring for you.  Who did you
say gave it to you?'</p>

<p>'We call her,' said Anthea carefully, 'the Queen of Babylon.'</p>

<p>'Is it a game?' he asked hopefully.</p>

<p>'It'll be a pretty game if I don't get the money to pay for cabs
for her,' said Anthea.</p>

<p>'I sometimes think,' he said slowly, 'that I am becoming insane,
or that - '</p>

<p>'Or that I am; but I'm not, and you're not, and she's not.'</p>

<p>'Does she SAY that she's the Queen of Babylon?' he uneasily
asked.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Anthea recklessly.</p>

<p>'This thought-transference is more far-reaching than I imagined,'
he said.  'I suppose I have unconsciously influenced HER, too.  I
never thought my Babylonish studies would bear fruit like this. 
Horrible!  There are more things in heaven and earth - '</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Anthea, 'heaps more.  And the pound is the thing <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span>
want more than anything on earth.'</p>

<p>He ran his fingers through his thin hair.</p>

<p>'This thought-transference!' he said.  'It's undoubtedly a
Babylonian ring - or it seems so to me.  But perhaps I have
hypnotized myself.  I will see a doctor the moment I have
corrected the last proofs of my book.'</p>

<p>'Yes, do!' said Anthea, 'and thank you so very much.'</p>

<p>She took the sovereign and ran down to the others.</p>

<p>And now from the window of a four-wheeled cab the Queen of
Babylon beheld the wonders of London.  Buckingham Palace she
thought uninteresting; Westminster Abbey and the Houses of
Parliament little better.  But she liked the Tower, and the
River, and the ships filled her with wonder and delight.</p>

<p>'But how badly you keep your slaves.  How wretched and poor and
neglected they seem,' she said, as the cab rattled along the Mile
End Road.</p>

<p>'They aren't slaves; they're working-people,' said Jane.</p>

<p>'Of course they're working.  That's what slaves are.  Don't you
tell me.  Do you suppose I don't know a slave's face when I see
it?</p>

<p>Why don't their masters see that they're better fed and better
clothed?  Tell me in three words.'</p>

<p>No one answered.  The wage-system of modern England is a little
difficult to explain in three words even if you understand
it - which the children didn't.</p>

<p>'You'll have a revolt of your slaves if you're not careful,' said
the Queen.</p>

<p>'Oh, no,' said Cyril; 'you see they have votes - that makes them
safe not to revolt.  It makes all the difference.  Father told me
so.'</p>

<p>'What is this vote?' asked the Queen.  'Is it a charm?  What do
they do with it?'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' said the harassed Cyril; 'it's just a vote,
that's all!  They don't do anything particular with it.'</p>

<p>'I see,' said the Queen; 'a sort of plaything.  Well, I wish that
all these slaves may have in their hands this moment their fill
of their favourite meat and drink.'</p>

<p>Instantly all the people in the Mile End Road, and in all the
other streets where poor people live, found their hands full of
things to eat and drink.  From the cab window could be seen
persons carrying every kind of food, and bottles and cans as
well.  Roast meat, fowls, red lobsters, great yellowy crabs,
fried fish, boiled pork, beef-steak puddings, baked onions,
mutton pies; most of the young people had oranges and sweets and
cake.  It made an enormous change in the look of the Mile End
Road - brightened it up, so to speak, and brightened up, more than
you can possibly imagine, the faces of the people.</p>

<p>'Makes a difference, doesn't it?' said the Queen.</p>

<p>'That's the best wish you've had yet,' said Jane with cordial
approval.</p>

<p>just by the Bank the cabman stopped.</p>

<p>'I ain't agoin' to drive you no further,' he said.  'Out you
gets.'</p>

<p>They got out rather unwillingly.</p>

<p>'I wants my tea,' he said; and they saw that on the box of the
cab was a mound of cabbage, with pork chops and apple sauce, a
duck, and a spotted currant pudding.  Also a large can.</p>

<p>'You pay me my fare,' he said threateningly, and looked down at
the mound, muttering again about his tea.</p>

<p>'We'll take another cab,' said Cyril with dignity.  'Give me
change for a sovereign, if you please.'</p>

<p>But the cabman, as it turned out, was not at all a nice
character.  He took the sovereign, whipped up his horse, and
disappeared in the stream of cabs and omnibuses and wagons,
without giving them any change at all.</p>

<p>Already a little crowd was collecting round the party.</p>

<p>'Come on,' said Robert, leading the wrong way.</p>

<p>The crowd round them thickened.  They were in a narrow street
where many gentlemen in black coats and without hats were
standing about on the pavement talking very loudly.</p>

<p>'How ugly their clothes are,' said the Queen of Babylon.  'They'd
be rather fine men, some of them, if they were dressed decently,
especially the ones with the beautiful long, curved noses.  I
wish they were dressed like the Babylonians of my court.'</p>

<p>And of course, it was so.</p>

<p>The moment the almost fainting Psammead had blown itself out
every man in Throgmorton Street appeared abruptly in Babylonian
full dress.</p>

<p>All were carefully powdered, their hair and beards were scented
and curled, their garments richly embroidered.  They wore rings
and armlets, flat gold collars and swords, and impossible-looking
head-dresses.</p>

<p>A stupefied silence fell on them.</p>

<p>'I say,' a youth who had always been fair-haired broke that
silence, 'it's only fancy of course - something wrong with my
eyes - but you chaps do look so rum.'</p>

<p>'Rum,' said his friend.  'Look at YOU.  You in a sash!  My hat! 
And your hair's gone black and you've got a beard.  It's my
belief we've been poisoned.  You do look a jackape.'</p>

<p>'Old Levinstein don't look so bad.  But how was it DONE - that's
what I want to know.  How was it done?  Is it conjuring, or
what?'</p>

<p>'I think it is chust a ver' bad tream,' said old Levinstein to
his clerk; 'all along Bishopsgate I haf seen the gommon people
have their hants full of food - GOOT food.  Oh yes, without doubt
a very bad tream!'</p>

<p>'Then I'm dreaming too, Sir,' said the clerk, looking down at his
legs with an expression of loathing.  'I see my feet in beastly
sandals as plain as plain.'</p>

<p>'All that goot food wasted,' said old Mr Levinstein.  A bad
tream - a bad tream.'</p>

<p>The Members of the Stock Exchange are said to be at all times a
noisy lot.  But the noise they made now to express their disgust
at the costumes of ancient Babylon was far louder than their
ordinary row.  One had to shout before one could hear oneself
speak.</p>

<p>'I only wish,' said the clerk who thought it was conjuring - he
was quite close to the children and they trembled, because they
knew that whatever he wished would come true.  'I only wish we
knew who'd done it.'</p>

<p>And, of course, instantly they did know, and they pressed round
the Queen.</p>

<p>'Scandalous!  Shameful!  Ought to be put down by law.  Give her
in charge.  Fetch the police,' two or three voices shouted at
once.</p>

<p>The Queen recoiled.</p>

<p>'What is it?' she asked.  'They sound like caged lions - lions by
the thousand.  What is it that they say?'</p>

<p>'They say &quot;Police!&quot;,' said Cyril briefly.  'I knew they would
sooner or later.  And I don't blame them, mind you.'</p>

<p>'I wish my guards were here!' cried the Queen.  The exhausted
Psammead was panting and trembling, but the Queen's guards in red
and green garments, and brass and iron gear, choked Throgmorton
Street, and bared weapons flashed round the Queen.</p>

<p>'I'm mad,' said a Mr Rosenbaum; 'dat's what it is - mad!'</p>

<p>'It's a judgement on you, Rosy,' said his partner.  'I always
said you were too hard in that matter of Flowerdew.  It's a
judgement, and I'm in it too.'</p>

<p>The members of the Stock Exchange had edged carefully away from
the gleaming blades, the mailed figures, the hard, cruel Eastern
faces.</p>

<p>But Throgmorton Street is narrow, and the crowd was too thick for
them to get away as quickly as they wished.</p>

<p>'Kill them,' cried the Queen.  'Kill the dogs!'</p>

<p>The guards obeyed.</p>

<p>'It IS all a dream,' cried Mr Levinstein, cowering in a doorway
behind his clerk.</p>

<p>'It isn't,' said the clerk.  'It isn't.  Oh, my good gracious! 
those foreign brutes are killing everybody.  Henry Hirsh is down
now, and Prentice is cut in two - oh, Lord! and Huth, and there
goes Lionel Cohen with his head off, and Guy Nickalls has lost
his head now.  A dream?  I wish to goodness it was all a dream.'</p>

<p>And, of course, instantly it was!  The entire Stock Exchange
rubbed its eyes and went back to close, to over, and either side
of seven-eights, and Trunks, and Kaffirs, and Steel Common, and
Contangoes, and Backwardations, Double Options, and all the
interesting subjects concerning which they talk in the Street
without ceasing.</p>

<p>No one said a word about it to anyone else.  I think I have
explained before that business men do not like it to be known
that they have been dreaming in business hours.  Especially mad
dreams including such dreadful things as hungry people getting
dinners, and the destruction of the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>The children were in the dining-room at 300, Fitzroy Street, pale
and trembling.  The Psammead crawled out of the embroidered bag,
and lay flat on the table, its leg stretched out, looking more
like a dead hare than anything else.</p>

<p>'Thank Goodness that's over,' said Anthea, drawing a deep breath.</p>

<p>'She won't come back, will she?' asked Jane tremulously.</p>

<p>'No,' said Cyril.  'She's thousands of years ago.  But we spent a
whole precious pound on her.  It'll take all our pocket-money for
ages to pay that back.'</p>

<p>'Not if it was ALL a dream,' said Robert.</p>

<p>'The wish said ALL a dream, you know, Panther; you cut up and ask
if he lent you anything.'</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon,' said Anthea politely, following the sound of
her knock into the presence of the learned gentleman, 'I'm so
sorry to trouble you, but DID you lend me a pound today?'</p>

<p>'No,' said he, looking kindly at her through his spectacles. 
'But it's extraordinary that you should ask me, for I dozed for a
few moments this afternoon, a thing I very rarely do, and I
dreamed quite distinctly that you brought me a ring that you said
belonged to the Queen of Babylon, and that I lent you a sovereign
and that you left one of the Queen's rings here.  The ring was a
magnificent specimen.'  He sighed.  'I wish it hadn't been a
dream,' he said smiling.  He was really learning to smile quite
nicely.</p>

<p>Anthea could not be too thankful that the Psammead was not there
to grant his wish.</p>
