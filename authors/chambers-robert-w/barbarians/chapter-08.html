<p>The incredible rumour that German airmen were in Brittany first
came from Plouharnel in Morbihan; then from Bannalec, where an
old Icelander had notified the Brigadier of the local Gendarmerie.
But the Icelander was very drunk. A thimble of cognac did it.</p>

<p>Again came an unconfirmed report that a shepherd lad while alternately
playing on his Biniou and fishing for eels at the confluence of
the Elle and Isole, had seen a werewolf in Laïs Woods. The Loup
Garou walked on two legs and had assumed the shape of a man with
no features except two enormous eyes.</p>

<p>The following week a coast guard near Flouranges telephoned to
the Aulnes Lighthouse; the keeper of the light telephoned to Lorient
the story of Wayland, and was instructed to extinguish the great
flash again and to keep watch from the lantern until an investigation
could be made.</p>

<p>That an enemy airman had done murder in Finistère was now certain;
but that a Boche submarine had come into the Bay of Biscay seemed
very improbable, considering the measures which had been taken
in the Channel, at Trieste, and at Gibraltar.</p>

<p>That a fleet of many sea-planes was soaring somewhere between
the Isle des Chouettes and Finistère, and landing men, seemed
to be practically an impossibility. Yet, there were the rumours.
And murder had been done.</p>

<p>But an enemy undersea boat required a base. Had such a base been
established somewhere along those lonely and desolate wastes of
bog and rock and moor and gorse-set cliff haunted only by curlew
and wild duck, and bounded inland by a silent barrier of forest
through which the wild boar roamed and rooted unmolested?</p>

<p>And where in Finistère was an enemy seaplane to come from, when,
save for the few remaining submarines still skulking near British
waters, the enemy’s flag had vanished from the seas?</p>

<p>Nevertheless the coast lights at Aulnes and on the Isle des Chouettes
went out; the Commandant at Lorient and the General in command
of the British expeditionary troops in the harbour consulted;
and the fleet of troop-laden transports did not sail as scheduled,
but a swarm of French and British cruisers, trawlers, mine-sweepers,
destroyers, and submarines put out from the great warport to comb
the boisterous seas of Biscay for any possible aërial or amphibious
Hun who might venture to haunt the coasts.</p>

<p>Inland, too, officers were sent hither and thither to investigate
various rumours and doubtful reports at their several sources.</p>

<p>And it happened in that way that Captain Neeland of the 6th Battalion,
Athabasca Regiment, Canadian Overseas Contingent, found himself
in the Forest of Aulnes, with instructions to stay there long
enough to verify or discredit a disturbing report which had just
arrived by mail.</p>

<p>The report was so strange and the investigation required so much
secrecy and caution that Captain Neeland changed his uniform for
knickerbockers and shooting coat, borrowed a fowling piece and
a sack of cartridges loaded with No. 4 shot, tucked his gun under
his arm, and sauntered out of Lorient town before dawn, like any
other duck-hunting enthusiast.</p>

<p>Several reasons influenced his superiors in sending Neeland to
investigate this latest and oddest report: for one thing, although
he had become temporarily a Canadian for military purposes only,
in reality he was an American artist who, like scores and scores
of his artistic fellow Yankees, had spent many years industriously
painting those sentimental Breton scenes which obsess our painters,
if not their critics. He was a very bad painter, but he did not
know it; he had already become a promising soldier, but he did
not realize that either. As a sportsman, however, Neeland was
rather pleased with himself.</p>

<p>He was sent because he knew the sombre and lovely land of Finistère
pretty well, because he was more or less of a naturalist and a
sportsman, and because the plan which he had immediately proposed
appeared to be reasonable as well as original.</p>

<p>It had been a stiff walk across country&mdash;fifteen miles, as against
thirty odd around by road&mdash;but neither cart nor motor was to enter
into the affair. If anybody should watch him, he was only a duckhunter
afield, crossing the marshes, skirting <em>étangs</em>, a solitary
figure in the waste, easily reconcilable with his wide and melancholy
surroundings.</p>
