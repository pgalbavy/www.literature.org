<p>At the foot of the rear stairs in the home of Widow Friestone
was an ordinary door latched at night, but without any lock. When
Mike Murphy was groping about in the blank darkness, where nothing
was familiar, he did not know, as has been said, of the steepness
of the steps. Thus he placed his shoe upon vacancy, and, unable
to check himself, bumped to the bottom, striking every step on
the route, and banging against the door with such force that the
latch gave away, it flew open, and he sprawled on his hands and
knees, still grasping the rifle with which he had set out to hunt
for burglars. He was not hurt, and bounded like a rubber ball
to his feet.</p>

<p>An amazing scene confronted him. A young man, his face covered
with a mask, had just drawn back the ponderous door of the safe,
and by the light of a small dark lantern in his left hand was
trying to unlock one of the inner compartments, with a bunch of
small keys held in his right. It was at this instant that the
racket followed by the crash which burst open the door paralyzed
him for the moment. He straightened up and stared through the
holes of his mask at the apparition that had descended upon him
like a thunderbolt, in helpless amazement.</p>

<p>If he was terrified, Mike Murphy was not. Forgetful of his shillaleh
in the shape of the Springfield, he made a leap at the fellow.</p>

<p>"S'render, ye spalpeen!" he shouted. The criminal answered by
viciously hurling the lantern into the face of his assailant,
and in the act, the mask somehow or other was disarranged and
slipped from its place. It was only a passing glimpse that Mike
caught of him, but it identified him as one of the young men who
had attacked Alvin Landon some nights before while passing through
the stretch of woods near his home.</p>

<p>The throwing of the lamp was the best thing the burglar could
have done, for it caught the Irish youth fairly between the eyes
and dazed him for an invaluable second or two. Instant to seize
his advantage, the criminal made a leap through the rear window,
which he had left open for that purpose, and sped like a deer
across the back yard of the premises. Mike was at his heels and
shouted:</p>

<p>"Stop! stop! or I'll blow ye into smithereens! I've got a double
barreled cannon wid me, and if ye want to save yer life, s'render
before I touch her off!"</p>

<p>Perhaps if the fugitive had not been in so wild a panic he would
have given himself up, for no man willingly invites the discharge
of a deadly weapon a few paces behind him. But the youth was bent
on escape if the feat were possible and ran with the vigor of
desperation.</p>

<p>Less than a hundred yards over the garden beds and grass took
the fellow to the paling boundary over which he leaped like a
greyhound. Mike would have done the same, but feared it was too
much for him. Moreover, his short legs could not carry him as
fast as those of the fleeing one. The pursuer rested a hand on
the palings and went over without trouble. By that time the fugitive
was a goodly distance off in the act of clearing a second fence.
In dread lest he should get away, Mike called:</p>

<p>"Have sinse, ye lunkhead! I don't want to kill ye, but hanged
if I don't, if ye fail to lay down yer arms."</p>

<p>The appeal like all that had preceded it was unheeded. The burglar
must have taken heart from the fact that his pursuer had already
held his fire so long. Running with unusual speed, he took advantage
of the shadow offered by several back buildings and continued
steadily to gain. When he made a quick turn and whisked out of
sight, the exasperated Mike dropped to a rapid walk.</p>

<p>"Arrah, now, if this owld gun was only in shape! there wouldn't
be any sich race as this, as Brian O'Donovan said&mdash;phwat's that?"</p>

<p>When within twenty feet of a small barn, a burly man stepped
out of the gloom and with a large gun levelled gruffly commanded:</p>

<p>"Throw up your arms or I'll let moonlight through you!"</p>

<p>"I don't see any room for argyment, as Jed Mitchell said whin&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Up with your hands! and drop that gun!" thundered the other,
and Mike let the old rifle fall to his feet and reached up as
if trying to hold the moon in place. Which incident requires an
explanation.</p>

<p>Gerald Buxton, the father of Jim, had no sooner heard the story
of his boy than he decided, as had been related, that something
was wrong at the post office. He had read of the many robberies
in southern Maine during the preceding summer, else he might not
have been so quick to reach a conclusion. He woke his wife, told
her his belief and then took down his shotgun from over the deer's
antlers in the kitchen. Both barrels were always loaded, but to
make sure of no lack of ammunition, he put a number of extra shells
loaded with heavy shot into his pockets.</p>

<p>"Remember," he said impressively to his son, "to stay home and
not show your nose outside the door while I'm gone."</p>

<p>"Yaws, sir," meekly replied Jim, who three minutes later, unseen
by his mother, sneaked out of the back door and reached the battlefield
directly behind his parent.</p>

<p>Mr. Buxton had never had any experience with house breakers,
and did some quick thinking from the moment he left his front
gate until he arrived on the scene. Nothing seemed more natural
than that the ruffians would not approach the house from the front,
but by the rear. The light which Jim saw must have come from the
back part of the store. For the gang to make their entrance from
the main street would have been far more dangerous.</p>

<p>Because of this theory, Mr. Buxton crossed the road directly
before his own house, passed through the alley of a neighbor,
and followed a circuitous course which compelled him to climb
several back fences. But he knew all the people, and in case he
was questioned could readily explain matters.</p>

<p>So in due time he came to the barn of one of his friends, and
had turned to pass around it when to his astonishment a man dashed
toward him on a dead run. Buxton was alert, and pointing his weapon,
crisply commanded:</p>

<p>"Stop or I'll fire!"</p>

<p>The panting fellow obeyed with the exclamation:</p>

<p>"I'm so glad!"</p>

<p>"Glad of what?"</p>

<p>"That you came as you did. There are burglars in the post office!"</p>

<p>"That's what I thought, but wasn't sure. Who are you and why
are you in such an all-fired hurry?"</p>

<p>"One of them is chasing me. I tried to wake the postmistress,
when he heard me and I had to run for my life. How thankful I
am that you appeared just in time!"</p>

<p>"Where is the scandalous villain?" demanded Mr. Buxton, glancing
on all sides.</p>

<p>"He will be here in a minute."</p>

<p>"I shan't wait for him; tell me where he is."</p>

<p>The fugitive, who was momentarily expecting the appearance of
his pursuer, pointed to the barn around which he had just dashed.</p>

<p>"He is coming from there. Look out, or he'll shoot you!"</p>

<p>"I'm ready for him," exclaimed the angered citizen as he hurriedly
trotted off and confronted Mike Murphy a few seconds later.</p>

<p>We have learned of the pointed conversation which passed between
them. Mike's first thought was that it was one of the robbers
who had held him up, but there was no gainsaying the argument
brought to bear against him. He remained with hands uplifted,
awaiting the will of his captor.</p>

<p>"So you're one of those post office robbers," said Mr. Buxton,
partly lowering his weapon.</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," replied Mike, beginning to scent the truth.</p>

<p>"Have you a pistol?"</p>

<p>"The only deadly wippon I have is me pocketknife, with its two
blades broke and the handle being lost some time since."</p>

<p>"Where is the rest of your gang?" demanded the man, stepping
closer to the youth.</p>

<p>"The two frinds that I have are wid the widder Mrs. Friestone,
doing their best to entertain the leddy and her daughter, while
I started out to chase one of the spalpeens that run too fast
for me to catch."</p>

<p>Mr. Buxton stepped still nearer. He was becoming doubtful.</p>

<p>"Who the mischief are you, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Mike Murphy, born in Tipperary, in the County of Tipperary,
Ireland, and lately, arrove in Ameriky."</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Standing still for the time, as Pat Mulrooney said whin the
byes tied him to the gate post and wint off and left him."</p>

<p>"Ain't you one of those post office robbers?"</p>

<p>The question told Mike the whole truth. It was a clever trick
that had been played upon him, and his musical laugh rang out
on the still night.</p>

<p>"What made ye have that opinion?"</p>

<p>"I just met a young chap the other side of this barn, and when
I stopped him he said he was running away from an enemy."</p>

<p>"Which the same was the thruth."</p>

<p>"And that one of the gang was chasing him, meaning to shoot him."</p>

<p>"It's mesilf that would have shot if I'd had a gun wid a conscience,
fur I catched the spalpeen when he was opening the safe of Widder
Friestone, and I made after him; but most persons can run faster
than mesilf, owing to me short legs, and he was laving me behind,
whin ye interfared."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that first fellow was one of the burglars?"
asked the astounded Mr. Buxton.</p>

<p>"As sure as ye are standing there admiring me looks."</p>

<p>"Confound the rapscallion! I'll get him yet!" and the irate citizen
dashed off with the resolution, to put it mildly, of correcting
the error he had made.</p>
