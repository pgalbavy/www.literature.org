<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>During the daylight hours of several autumn Saturdays there had
been severe outbreaks of cavalry in the Schofield neighbourhood.
The sabres were of wood; the steeds were imaginary, and both were
employed in a game called "bonded pris'ner" by its inventors,
Masters Penrod Schofield and Samuel Williams. The pastime was
not intricate. When two enemies met, they fenced spectacularly
until the person of one or the other was touched by the opposing
weapon; then, when the ensuing claims of foul play had been disallowed
and the subsequent argument settled, the combatant touched was
considered to be a prisoner until such time as he might be touched
by the hilt of a sword belonging to one of his own party, which
effected his release and restored to him the full enjoyment of
hostile activity. Pending such rescue, however, he was obliged
to accompany the forces of his captor whithersoever their strategical
necessities led them, which included many strange places. For
the game was exciting, and, at its highest pitch, would sweep
out of an alley into a stable, out of that stable and into a yard,
out of that yard and into a house, and through that house with
the sound (and effect upon furniture) of trampling herds. In fact,
this very similarity must have been in the mind of the distressed
coloured woman in Mrs. Williams's kitchen, when she declared that
she might "jes' as well try to cook right spang in the middle
o' the stock-yards."</p>

<p>All up and down the neighbourhood the campaigns were waged, accompanied
by the martial clashing of wood upon wood and by many clamorous
arguments.</p>

<p>"You're a pris'ner, Roddy Bitts!"</p>

<p>"I am not!"</p>

<p>"You are, too! I touched you."</p>

<p>"Where, I'd like to know!"</p>

<p>"On the sleeve."</p>

<p>"You did not! I never felt it. I guess I'd 'a' felt it, wouldn't
I?"</p>

<p>"What if you didn't? I touched you, and you're bonded. I leave
it to Sam Williams."</p>

<p>"Yah! Course you would! He's on your side! <em>I</em> leave it
to Herman."</p>

<p>"No, you won't! If you can't show any <em>SENSE </em>about it,
we'll do it over, and I guess you'll see whether you feel it or
not! There! <em>NOW, I </em>guess you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, squash!"</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the undoubted champion proved to be the youngest
and darkest of all the combatants, one Verman, coloured, brother
to Herman, and substantially under the size to which his nine
years entitled him. Verman was unfortunately tongue-tied, but
he was valiant beyond all others, and, in spite of every handicap,
he became at once the chief support of his own party and the despair
of the opposition.</p>

<p>On the third Saturday this opposition had been worn down by the
successive captures of Maurice Levy and Georgie Bassett until
it consisted of only Sam Williams and Penrod. Hence, it behooved
these two to be wary, lest they be wiped out altogether; and Sam
was dismayed indeed, upon cautiously scouting round a corner of
his own stable, to find himself face to face with the valorous
and skilful Verman, who was acting as an outpost, or picket, of
the enemy.</p>

<p>Verman immediately fell upon Sam, horse and foot, and Sam would
have fled but dared not, for fear he might be touched from the
rear. Therefore, he defended himself as best he could, and there
followed a lusty whacking, in the course of which Verman's hat,
a relic and too large, fell from his head, touching Sam's weapon
in falling.</p>

<p>"There!" panted Sam, desisting immediately. "That counts! You're
bonded, Verman."</p>

<p>"Aim meewer!" Verman protested.</p>

<p>Interpreting this as "Ain't neither", Sam invented a law to suit
the occasion. "Yes, you are; that's the rule, Verman. I touched
your hat with my sword, and your hat's just the same as you."</p>

<p>"Imm mop!" Verman insisted.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," said Sam, already warmly convinced (by his own
statement) that he was in the right. "Listen here! If I hit you
on the shoe, it would be the same as hitting <em>YOU, </em>wouldn't
it? I guess it'd count if I hit you on the shoe, wouldn't it?
Well, a hat's just the same as shoes. Honest, that's the rule,
Verman, and you're a pris'ner."</p>

<p>Now, in the arguing part of the game, Verman's impediment cooperated
with a native amiability to render him far less effective than
in the actual combat. He chuckled, and ceded the point.</p>

<p>"Aw wi," he said, and cheerfully followed his captor to a hidden
place among some bushes in the front yard, where Penrod lurked.</p>

<p>"Looky what <em>I</em> got!" Sam said importantly, pushing his
captive into this retreat. "<em>NOW, I </em>guess you won't say
I'm not so much use any more! Squat down, Verman, so's they can't
see you if they're huntin' for us. That's one o' the rules&mdash;honest.
You got to squat when we tell you to."</p>

<p>Verman was agreeable. He squatted, and then began to laugh uproariously.</p>

<p>"Stop that noise!" Penrod commanded. "You want to betray us?
What you laughin' at?"</p>

<p>"Ep mack im mimmup," Verman giggled.</p>

<p>"What's he mean?" Sam asked.</p>

<p>Penrod was more familiar with Verman's utterance, and he interpreted.</p>

<p>"He says they'll get him back in a minute."</p>

<p>"No, they won't. I'd just like to see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, they will, too," Penrod said. "They'll get him back for
the main and simple reason we can't stay here all day, can we?
And they'd find us anyhow, if we tried to. There's so many of
'em against just us two, they can run in and touch him soon as
they get up to us&mdash;and then HE'LL be after us again and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen here!" Sam interrupted. "Why can't we put some <em>REAL
</em>bonds on him? We could put bonds on his wrists and around
his legs&mdash;we could put 'em all over him, easy as nothin'. Then
we could gag him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, we can't," said Penrod. "We can't, for the main and simple
reason we haven't got any rope or anything to make the bonds with,
have we? I wish we had some o' that stuff they give sick people.
<em>THEN, I </em>bet they wouldn't get him back so soon!"</p>

<p>"Sick people?" Sam repeated, not comprehending.</p>

<p>"It makes 'em go to sleep, no matter what you do to 'em," Penrod
explained. "That's the main and simple reason they can't wake
up, and you can cut off their ole legs&mdash;or their arms, or anything
you want to."</p>

<p>"Hoy!" exclaimed Verman, in a serious tone. His laughter ceased
instantly, and he began to utter a protest sufficiently intelligible.</p>

<p>"You needn't worry," Penrod said gloomily. "We haven't got any
o' that stuff; so we can't do it."</p>

<p>"Well, we got to do sumpthing," Sam said.</p>

<p>His comrade agreed, and there was a thoughtful silence; but presently
Penrod's countenance brightened.</p>

<p>"I know!" he exclaimed. "<em>I</em> know what we'll do with him.
Why, I thought of it just as <em>EASY! I </em>can most always
think of things like that, for the main and simple reason&mdash;well,
I thought of it just as soon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" Sam demanded crossly. Penrod's reiteration
of his new-found phrase, "for the main and simple reason", had
been growing more and more irksome to his friend all day, though
Sam was not definitely aware that the phrase was the cause of
his annoyance. "<em>WHAT </em>are we goin' to do with him, you
know so much?"</p>

<p>Penrod rose and peered over the tops of the bushes, shading his
eyes with his hand, a gesture that was unnecessary but had a good
appearance. He looked all round about him in this manner, finally
vouchsafing a report to the impatient Sam.</p>

<p>"No enemies in sight&mdash;just for the main and simple reason I expect
they're all in the alley and in Georgie Bassett's backyard."</p>

<p>"I bet they're not!" Sam said scornfully, his irritation much
increased. "How do <em>YOU </em>know so much about it?"</p>

<p>"Just for the main and simple reason," Penrod replied, with dignified
finality.</p>

<p>And at that, Sam felt a powerful impulse to do violence upon
the person of his comrade-in-arms. The emotion that prompted this
impulse was so primitive and straightforward that it almost resulted
in action; but Sam had a vague sense that he must control it as
long as he could.</p>

<p>"Bugs!" he said.</p>

<p>Penrod was sensitive, and this cold word hurt him. However, he
was under the domination of his strategic idea, and he subordinated
private grievance to the common weal. "Get up!" he commanded.
"You get up, too, Verman. You got to&mdash;it's the rule. Now here
I'll <em>SHOW </em>you what we're goin' to do. Stoop over, and
both o' you do just exackly like <em>I</em> do. You watch ME,
because this biz'nuss has got to be done <em>RIGHT</em>!"</p>

<p>Sam muttered something; he was becoming more insurgent every
moment, but he obeyed. Likewise, Verman rose to his feet, ducked
his head between his shoulders, and trotted out to the sidewalk
at Sam's heels, both following Penrod and assuming a stooping
position in imitation of him. Verman was delighted with this phase
of the game, and, also, he was profoundly amused by Penrod's pomposity.
Something dim and deep within him perceived it to be cause for
such merriment that he had ado to master himself, and was forced
to bottle and cork his laughter with both hands. They proved insufficient;
sputterings burst forth between his fingers.</p>

<p>"You stop that!" Penrod said, looking back darkly upon the prisoner.</p>

<p>Verman endeavoured to oblige, though giggles continued to leak
from him at intervals, and the three boys stole along the fence
in single file, proceeding in this fashion until they reached
Penrod's own front gate. Here the leader ascertained, by a reconnaissance
as far as the corner, that the hostile forces were still looking
for them in another direction. He returned in a stealthy but important
manner to his disgruntled follower and the hilarious captive.</p>

<p>"Well," said Sam impatiently, "I guess I'm not goin' to stand
around here all day, I guess! You got anything you want to do,
why'n't you go on and DO it?"</p>

<p>Penrod's brow was already contorted to present the appearance
of detached and lofty concentration&mdash;a histrionic failure, since
it did not deceive the audience. He raised a hushing hand.</p>

<p>"SH!" he murmured. "I got to think."</p>

<p>"Bugs!" the impolite Mr. Williams said again.</p>

<p>Verman bent double, squealing and sputtering; indeed, he was
ultimately forced to sit upon the ground, so exhausting was the
mirth to which he now gave way. Penrod's composure was somewhat
affected and he showed annoyance.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess you won't laugh quite so much about minute from
now, ole Mister Verman!" he said severely. "You get up from there
and do like I tell you."</p>

<p>"Well, why'n't you <em>TELL </em>him why he won't laugh so much,
then?" Sam demanded, as Verman rose. "Why'n't you do sumpthing
and quit talkin' so much about it?"</p>

<p>Penrod haughtily led the way into the yard.</p>

<p>"You follow me," he said, "and I guess you'll learn a little
sense!"</p>

<p>Then, abandoning his hauteur for an air of mystery equally irritating
to Sam, he stole up the steps of the porch, and, after a moment's
manipulation of the knob of the big front door, contrived to operate
the fastenings, and pushed the door open.</p>

<p>"Come on," he whispered, beckoning. And the three boys mounted
the stairs to the floor above in silence&mdash;save for a belated giggle
on the part of Verman, which was restrained upon a terrible gesture
from Penrod. Verman buried his mouth as deeply as possible in
a ragged sleeve, and confined his demonstrations to a heaving
of the stomach and diaphragm.</p>

<p>Penrod led the way into the dainty room of his nineteen-year-old
sister, Margaret, and closed the door.</p>

<p>"There," he said, in a low and husky voice, "I expect you'll
see what I'm goin' to do now!"</p>

<p>"Well, what?" the skeptical Sam asked. "If we stay here very
long your mother'll come and send us downstairs. What's the good
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>WAIT, </em>can't you?" Penrod wailed, in a whisper. "My
goodness!" And going to an inner door, he threw it open, disclosing
a clothes-closet hung with pretty garments of many kinds, while
upon its floor were two rows of shoes and slippers of great variety
and charm.</p>

<p>A significant thing is to be remarked concerning the door of
this somewhat intimate treasury: there was no knob or latch upon
the inner side, so that, when the door was closed, it could be
opened only from the outside.</p>

<p>"There!" said Penrod. "You get in there, Verman, and I'll bet
they won't get to touch you back out o' bein' our pris'ner very
soon, <em>NOW! </em>Oh, I guess not!"</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said Sam. "Is that all you were goin' to do? Why, your
mother'll come and make him get out the first&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, she won't. She and Margaret have gone to my aunt's in the
country, and aren't goin' to be back till dark. And even if he
made a lot o' noise, it's kind of hard to hear anything from in
there, anyway, when the door's shut. Besides, he's got to keep
quiet&mdash;that's the rule, Verman. You're a pris'ner, and it's the
rule you can't holler or nothin'. You unnerstand that, Verman?"</p>

<p>"Aw wi," said Verman.</p>

<p>"Then go on in there. Hurry!"</p>

<p>The obedient Verman marched into the closet and sat down among
the shoes and slippers, where he presented an interesting effect
of contrast. He was still subject to hilarity&mdash;though endeavouring
to suppress it by means of a patent-leather slipper&mdash;when Penrod
closed the door.</p>

<p>"There!" said Penrod, leading the way from the room. "I guess
<em>NOW </em>you see!"</p>

<p>Sam said nothing, and they came out to the open air and reached
their retreat in the Williams' yard again, without his having
acknowledged Penrod's service to their mutual cause.</p>

<p>"I thought of that just as easy!" Penrod remarked, probably prompted
to this odious bit of complacency by Sam's withholding the praise
that might naturally have been expected. And he was moved to add,
"I guess it'd of been a pretty long while if we'd had to wait
for you to think of something as good as that, Sam."</p>

<p>"Why would it?" Sam asked. "Why would it of been such a long
while?"</p>

<p>"Oh," Penrod responded airily, "just for the main and simple
reason!"</p>

<p>Sam could bear it no longer. "Oh, hush up!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Penrod was stung. "Do you mean ME?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do!" the goaded Sam replied.</p>

<p>"Did you tell ME to hush up?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did!"</p>

<p>"I guess you don't know who you're talkin' to," Penrod said ominously.
"I guess I just better show you who you're talkin' to like that.
I guess you need a little sumpthing, for the main and simple&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sam uttered an uncontrollable howl and sprang upon Penrod, catching
him round the waist. Simultaneously with this impact, the wooden
swords spun through the air and were presently trodden underfoot
as the two boys wrestled to and fro.</p>

<p>Penrod was not altogether surprised by the onset of his friend.
He had been aware of Sam's increasing irritation (though neither
boy could have clearly stated its cause) and that very irritation
produced a corresponding emotion in the bosom of the irritator.
Mentally, Penrod was quite ready for the conflict&mdash;nay, he welcomed
it&mdash;though, for the first few moments, Sam had the physical advantage.</p>

<p>However, it is proper that a neat distinction be drawn here.
This was a conflict; but neither technically nor in the intention
of the contestants was it a fight. Penrod and Sam were both in
a state of high exasperation, and there was great bitterness;
but no blows fell and no tears. They strained, they wrenched,
they twisted, and they panted and muttered: "Oh, no, you don't!"
"Oh, I guess I do!" "Oh, you will, will you?" "You'll see what
you get in about a minute!" "I guess you'll learn some sense this
time!"</p>

<p>Streaks and blotches began to appear upon the two faces, where
colour had been heightened by the ardent application of a cloth
sleeve or shoulder, while ankles and insteps were scraped and
toes were trampled. Turf and shrubberies suffered, also, as the
struggle went on, until finally the wrestlers pitched headlong
into a young lilac bush, and came to earth together, among its
crushed and sprawling branches.</p>

<p>"<em>OOCH!" </em>and "<em>WUF!" </em>were the two exclamations
which marked this episode, and then, with no further comment,
the struggle was energetically continued upon a horizontal plane.
Now Penrod was on top, now Sam; they rolled, they squirmed, they
suffered. And this contest endured. It went on and on, and it
was impossible to imagine its coming to a definite termination.
It went on so long that to both the participants it seemed to
be a permanent thing, a condition that had always existed and
that must always exist perpetually.</p>

<p>And thus they were discovered by a foray of the hostile party,
headed by Roddy Bitts and Herman (older brother to Verman) and
followed by the bonded prisoners, Maurice Levy and Georgie Bassett.
These and others caught sight of the writhing figures, and charged
down upon them with loud cries of triumph.</p>

<p>"Pris'ner! Pris'ner! Bonded pris'ner!" shrieked Roddy Bitts,
and touched Penrod and Sam, each in turn, with his sabre. Then,
seeing that they paid no attention and that they were at his mercy,
he recalled the fact that several times, during earlier stages
of the game, both of them had been unnecessarily vigorous in "touching"
his own rather plump person. Therefore, the opportunity being
excellent, he raised his weapon again, and, repeating the words
"bonded pris'ner" as ample explanation of his deed, brought into
play the full strength of his good right arm. He used the flat
of the sabre.</p>

<p><em>WHACK! WHACK! </em>Roddy was perfectly impartial. It was
a cold-blooded performance and even more effective than he anticipated.
For one thing, it ended the civil war instantly. Sam and Penrod
leaped to their feet, shrieking and bloodthirsty, while Maurice
Levy capered with joy, Herman was so overcome that he rolled upon
the ground, and Georgie Bassett remarked virtuously:</p>

<p>"It serves them right for fighting."</p>

<p>But Roddy Bitts foresaw that something not within the rules of
the game was about to happen.</p>

<p>"Here! You keep away from me!" he quavered, retreating. "I was
just takin' you pris'ners. I guess I had a right to <em>TOUCH
</em>you, didn't I?"</p>

<p>Alas! Neither Sam nor Penrod was able to see the matter in that
light. They had retrieved their own weapons, and they advanced
upon Roddy with a purposefulness that seemed horrible to him.</p>

<p>"Here! You keep away from me!" he said, in great alarm. "I'm
goin' home."</p>

<p>He did go home&mdash;but only subsequently. What took place before
his departure had the singular solidity and completeness of systematic
violence; also, it bore the moral beauty of all actions that lead
to peace and friendship, for, when it was over, and the final
vocalizations of Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, were growing
faint with increasing distance, Sam and Penrod had forgotten their
differences and felt well disposed toward each other once more.
All their animosity was exhausted, and they were in a glow of
good feeling, though probably they were not conscious of any direct
gratitude to Roddy, whose thoughtful opportunism was really the
cause of this happy result.</p>
