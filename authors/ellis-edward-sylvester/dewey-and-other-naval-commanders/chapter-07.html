<p>Our Naval War with France &mdash;The Tribute Paid to the Barbary
States by Christian Nations &mdash;War Declared Against the United
States by Tripoli &mdash;Bainbridge, Decatur, Stewart, Dale and
Preble.</p>

<p>Now I suspect that if my young readers were asked to name the
nations with which, at one time or another we have been at war,
they would not be likely to include France in the list. All the
same, we have had a war with her, though it was confined to the
ocean and there was no formal declaration on either side.</p>

<p>A few years after the close of our Revolution one of the most
appalling uprisings in the history of the world took place in
France. The kings and nobility ground the people into the very
dust until they were goaded into revolt, which overturned the
throne and was marked by atrocities that shocked the world. Incredible
as it may seem, there were a million people put to death during
the awful days of the Reign of Terror.</p>

<p>The mad rulers, not satisfied with deluging their own country
with blood, were at war with most of the neighboring nations.
They seemed to wish to array themselves against all mankind and
began a system of action toward us which soon became unbearable.</p>

<p>They seemed to think we could be scared into paying the rulers
immense sums of money for the privilege of being left alone. They
encouraged their naval officers to capture American vessels, and
when we sent commissioners to France to protest they were coolly
told that outrages upon our commerce would not be stopped until
we paid the leaders several hundred thousand dollars in the way
of bribes. Then it was that one of our commissioners made the
memorable reply: "Millions for defence, but not one cent for tribute."</p>

<p>Our representatives were driven out of France and the capture
of our vessels by French cruisers continued. So Congress met,
cancelled all treaties with France, formed an army, placed Washington,
then an old man, at the head, formed a new navy and told the men-of-war
to go out and give the insolent nation a lesson she very much
needed.</p>

<p>And France got the lesson. The fighting on the ocean, beginning
in 1798, continued for two years and a half. The French cruisers
succeeded in capturing only one vessel from the American navy,
while 84 armed French ships, mostly privateers, mounting more
than 500 guns, were captured by our vessels. In February, 1801,
a treaty of peace was signed with France, which brought our troubles
with her to an end.</p>

<p>Now, if you will examine your map of Africa, you will notice
a group of countries along the southern coast of the Mediterranean
that are known as the Barbary States. Their names are Morocco,
Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli. I remember when I was a boy how easy
it was to learn the names of the capitals of those countries,
for each one was the same as the country itself.</p>

<p>The people of the Barbary States are only half civilized or barbarous,
but they have always had a mighty high opinion of themselves,
though it can hardly be as high to-day as it was a hundred years
ago. They looked upon the "dogs of Christians" as heathen nations,
only fitted to be their slaves, and it must be admitted that it
was quite natural they should hold the leading maritime nations
of Europe as well as ourselves in contempt, for all deserved it.</p>

<p>The favorite business of those barbarians was playing pirate.
Their corsairs roamed up and down the Mediterranean, eagerly hunting
for Christian merchant vessels, that they might kill the crews
and divide the plunder among themselves. Sometimes, by way of
variety, they would throw their captives into dungeons and then
notify the governments to which they belonged that they would
be set free upon the payment of a large sum of money to their
captors. If the government did not choose to pay the ransom, why
their captors would give themselves the pleasure of putting the
prisoners to death.</p>

<p>Now, it would have been an easy thing for any one of the Christian
nations interested to send a fleet into the Mediterranean, which,
speaking figuratively, would have wiped those miscreants off the
face of the earth; but such an enterprise would have cost a good
deal of money, so, instead of punishing the wretches as they deserved,
the countries paid them a yearly sum of money on their promise
not to disturb vessels when they ran across them.</p>

<p>So it was that, year after year, we sent a good round gift to
those barbarians. You know our Government is often slow in meeting
its obligations, and it happened now and then we were late in
sending our tribute to the swarthy rulers. When that occurred,
the Dey, or Bashaw, imposed a heavy fine to remind us of the expense
of trifling with him. We meekly bowed our heads, paid it, and
tried to be more prompt afterward. Then, too, the mighty ruler
sometimes expressed a wish to receive naval stores instead of
money, and we were happy to oblige him. Of course, he set his
own valuation on what he received, which was generally about one-half
of what they cost our Government, but we made no complaint.</p>

<p>It came about that the Dey of Tripoli got the idea into his head
that we were not paying him as much as we did his neighbors. In
his impatience, he decided to give us a lesson as badly needed
as it was in the case of France, to which I have alluded. So he
declared war against the United States. It would be interesting
to know what ideas the Dey had of the Republic on the other side
of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>One good thing resulted from our flurry with France. A number
of good ships had been added to our navy. Better still, many young
officers, brave, skilful and glowing with patriotic ardor, were
serving on those ships. They eagerly welcomed the chance of winning
glory. To them the war with Tripoli offered the very opportunity
for which they longed.</p>

<p>Among these was William Bainbridge, who was born in 1774 and
died in 1833. He began life as a sailor at the age of fifteen,
and was in several engagements before he was appointed to the
navy in 1798, during our war with France.</p>

<p>Another was Stephen Decatur, born in Maryland in 1779 and killed
in a duel with Commodore Barron in 1820. His father was a gallant
officer in the Revolution, and his two sons were among the bravest
officers who ever trod the quarter deck. Both entered the service
in 1798, and Stephen is generally regarded as the best type of
the young American naval officer during the early years of the
present century.</p>

<p>Still another was Charles Stewart, born in Philadelphia in 1778,
and, like those whom I have named, he entered the navy as lieutenant
in 1798. It will always be one of my pleasantest recollections
that I was well acquainted with Stewart, and spent many hours
talking with him about the stirring scenes in which he took part.
He lived to be more than ninety years of age, dying in 1869, and
for a good many years occupied a modest little home, just below
Bordentown, New Jersey. When eighty-eight years old he was as
active as a man of half his years. I came upon him one wintry
day, when he was of that age, and found him in the barn, shoveling
corn into a hopper, of which a sturdy Irishman was turning the
crank. The old admiral kept his hired man busy and enjoyed his
own work. He was of small figure, always wore an old-fashioned
blue swallow-tail with brass buttons, took snuff, and would laugh
and shake until his weatherbeaten face was purple over some of
his reminiscences of the early days of the Republic.</p>

<p>Think of it! He remembered seeing Benedict Arnold burned in effigy
in Philadelphia in 1781; he recalled Paul Jones, and had drunk
wine and talked with Washington.</p>

<p>Stewart and Decatur were of about the same age, and attended
the old Academy in Philadelphia. They were bosom friends from
boyhood. Stewart told me that Decatur was a good student, but
there was hardly a boy in the school, anywhere near his own age,
with whom he did not have a fight. He would "rather fight than
eat," but he was not a bully, and never imposed upon any one younger
or weaker than himself.</p>

<p>A great many of my talks with old Admiral Stewart related to
the war with Tripoli, which began in 1801 and lasted nearly four
years. As you will learn, Stewart had a great deal to do with
that war, and most of the incidents that follow were told to me
by him, a fact which insures their truthfulness and interest.</p>

<p>Among others to whom I shall refer was Commodore Richard Dale,
who was born in 1756, and died in 1826. He was older, as you will
notice, than the three whom I have mentioned. As to his bravery,
it is enough to say that he was first lieutenant on the <em>Bonhomme
Richard</em> during her terrible fight under Paul Jones with the
<em>Serapis</em>, and served with that wonderful naval hero on
the <em>Alliance</em> and the <em>Ariel</em>. Had he not been
made of the right stuff he never could have held such a position
when a very young man.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>COMMODORE EDWARD PREBLE</em>.]</p>

<p>Another hero was Commodore Edward Preble, born in 1761 and died
in 1807. When only sixteen years old he joined a privateer, and
at eighteen was active in the attacks of the <em>Protector</em>
on the British privateer <em>Admiral Duff</em>. He was on the
<em>Winthrop</em>, and fought bravely in the battle which resulted
in the capture of a British armed brig. He was commissioned lieutenant
in 1798, and the year following commanded the <em>Essex</em>.</p>

<p>From what I have told you, it will be seen that it was a gallant
band that our Government sent into the Mediterranean in 1801 to
chastise the barbarians and compel them to respect the Stars and
Stripes.</p>
