<p>Deerfoot informed his friends that they were now within seven
miles of the block-house. Although the night was far advanced,
he expected to reach their destination long before morning. At
that season the days were short, and as the Shawanoe was familiar
with the woods, and could travel with as much certainty in the
darkness as the light, there was no delay counted upon, unless
they should approach the vicinity of some of the Wyandots.</p>

<p>The order of march was taken up precisely as before, Deerfoot
warning the others to walk with the least noise possible, he setting
the example by advancing absolutely without any sound that could
betray his footsteps.</p>

<p>Ned Preston felt the touch of a few wandering snowflakes against
his cheek, but there were not enough to show themselves on the
leaves. The exercise of walking and their thick garments kept
them sufficiently warm, though it would have been different had
they been in camp. In the latter case, as they had no encumbering
blankets, it would have gone ill without a roaring camp-fire.</p>

<p>The journey now became monotonous, even to young Preston, who
found it tiresome to walk so continuously without the least noise
or occurrence to awaken alarm. They must have gone at least four
miles in this manner, Blossom plodding along with a certain dogged
resolution which kept him close on the heels of his young master.</p>

<p>The latter often felt like protesting, but nothing could have
persuaded him to do so. It would have offended Deerfoot, who was
the guide of the party, and who was directing affairs in accordance
with his own theory of strategy. He knew that that scout is sure
to meet disaster, sooner or later, who allows his impatience to
influence his judgment, and who fails to use the most extreme
caution whenever and wherever there is the shadow of danger.</p>

<p>When Preston began to believe they were in the vicinity of the
Licking, Deerfoot came to an abrupt and noiseless halt. This time
he spoke the single word&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>Listen!</em>"</p>

<p>The two did as requested, but were unable to detect anything
beside the hollow moaning of the wind through the trees, and the
faint, almost inaudible murmur of the distant Licking. Several
minutes passed, and then the guide asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do my brothers hear anything?"</p>

<p>They answered that they could distinguish nothing more than was
always to be heard at such times.</p>

<p>"We are close to the camp of the Wyandots," was the alarming
information.</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" inquired his friend.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot heard them," was the explanation, in such a guarded
undertone that his companions barely caught his words.</p>

<p>No one thought of doubting the assertion of the Indian, incredible
as it sounded, and the truth of his declaration was soon manifest.
Certain as he was that they were close to a party of his own race,
the advance was made with greater care than before.</p>

<p>He picked his way with such patience and slowness that Blossom
found plenty of time in which to lift his feet as high as he knew
how, setting them down as though afraid of waking a slumbering
baby near at hand.</p>

<p>Within two rods of the spot where they halted they suddenly caught
the starlike twinkle of a point of fire directly ahead. Instantly
all stopped, and no one spoke; they knew that it was the camp-fire
of the party whose presence the Shawanoe learned a few minutes
before.</p>

<p>Nothing more than the glimmer of the light could be seen, because
there were so many trees and so much vegetation intervening.</p>

<p>"Let my brothers wait till I return," said Deerfoot, turning
his head so as not to speak too loud.</p>

<p>"It shall be done," replied Ned Preston, who was on the point
of asking a question, when he became aware that he and Blossom
were alone: Deerfoot had vanished with the silence of a shadow.</p>

<p>"If we've to wait yar a long time," said Blossom in a husky whisper,
"we might as well sot down."</p>

<p>Preston made no objection to this on the part of his servant,
but he remained standing himself, leaning against a tree, while
Blossom supported his head in the same way.</p>

<p>"I don't care if Deerfoot doesn't come back for a week," remarked
the negro lad, with a sigh of contentment that at last he was
permitted to rest his limbs.</p>

<p>"He will not stay long," said Ned; "and the best thing we can
do while he is away is to do nothing."</p>

<p>"Dat's just what I'm doin' as hard as I can."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't even speak, Blossom, for some of the Indians may
be near us."</p>

<p>"Dat suits me jes' as well," assented the other, who thereafter
held his peace.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Deerfoot the Shawanoe approached the camp-fire of
the Indians with all the care and skill he could command. Possibly
he would have incurred no great risk by stalking boldly forward,
for he was already known among the tribe, which was an ally of
the Shawanoes.</p>

<p>But the incident of the afternoon had taught him a lesson, and
he knew such a course would deepen the suspicion which some of
the Wyandots already held against him.</p>

<p>They had given him to understand they were on their way to reconnoiter
Wild Oaks and some of the settlements along the Ohio. If they
should find he was dogging them, what other proof could they ask
that he was playing the part of spy and enemy?</p>

<p>For this reason the Shawanoe determined to avoid observation,
and to make his reconnoissance precisely as though he were an
avowed foe of those of his own race.</p>

<p>He had not gone far when he gained a full view of the camp. That
which immediately caught his attention and increased his misgiving
was the fact that this was a new party altogether. Waughtauk did
not lead these warriors, none of whom was with the company whom
the young scout encountered during the afternoon.</p>

<p>But several other important facts were significant: these were
also Wyandots; they numbered thirteen, and they were in their
war-paint. They had probably left their towns north of the Ohio
at the same time with Waughtauk, and they had separated, the better
to carry out some project the chief had in view.</p>

<p>Shrewd and sagacious beyond his years as was the Shawanoe, he
was in a situation in which he was compelled to do no little guessing.
He was satisfied that the chief and his warriors intended to compass
the destruction of the block-house, sometimes known as Fort Bridgman,
and to massacre every one within it.</p>

<p>The Wyandots, like the Shawanoes, were brave fighters, and why
they had not assailed the post was hard to tell, when it would
seem they numbered enough to overwhelm the garrison. It looked
as if Colonel Preston had discovered his danger, though it was
not an uncommon thing for a war party to delay their attack on
a station a long time after it seemed doomed beyond all hope.</p>

<p>The Wyandots had disposed themselves in a fashion that looked
as though they meant to stay where they were through the night.
They had evidently finished a meal on something, and were now
smoking their pipes, lolling on their blankets, sharpening their
knives with peculiar whetstones, cleaning their guns, now and
then exchanging a few guttural words, the meaning of which not
even the sharp-eared Shawanoe could catch.</p>

<p>"They mean to attack the block-house," was the conclusion of
Deerfoot, who tarried only a few minutes, when he began a cautious
return to his two friends, who were found as he had left them,
except that Blossom Brown was on the verge of slumber.</p>

<p>Deerfoot quickly explained what he had learned, and added that
the difficulty of entering the block-house was increased; but
he believed, by acting promptly, it could be done with safety.
Ned Preston was inclined to ask wherein the use lay of all three
going thither, when one would do as well, and the obstacles were
much greater than in the case of a single person.</p>

<p>But the course of the guide convinced Preston that he had some
plan which he had not yet revealed, and which necessitated the
entrance of the young pioneer at least into the block-house.</p>

<p>"Have you any knowledge when the Wyandots will attack Colonel
Preston?"</p>

<p>"The break of day is a favorite hour with Deerfoot's people,
but they often take other seasons."</p>

<p>"Why are they not closer to the station?"</p>

<p>"They are already close; we are within three hundred yards of
the fort; Deerfoot will lead the way, and if the warriors' eyes
are not like those of the owl, we may pass through the gate before
the first sign of light in the east."</p>

<p>There was no necessity of telling Ned and Blossom that their
caution must not be relaxed a single moment: no one could know
better than they that the briefest forgetfulness was likely to
prove fatal, for the Wyandots were all around them. The detection
of either lad would seal his fate.</p>

<p>The purpose of Deerfoot was to steal nigh enough to the block-house
to apprise the inmates that they were on the outside, and awaiting
an opportunity to enter. Could they succeed in letting Colonel
Preston know the truth, all three could be admitted in the darkness,
with little danger to themselves or to the garrison.</p>

<p>What the Shawanoe feared was that the Wyandots had established
a cordon, as it might be termed, around the block-house. It was
more than probable that Colonel Preston had discovered the approach
of the hostiles in time to make quite thorough preparations.</p>

<p>While this might not avert the attack of the red men, it was
certain to delay it. The next most natural proceeding for the
commandant would be to dispatch a messenger to Wild Oaks, to inform
the settlers of his peril, and to bring back help. The assailing
Indians would anticipate such a movement by surrounding the block-house
so closely that the most skillful ranger would find it impossible
to make his way through the lines.</p>

<p>If such were the case, it followed as a corollary that no friend
of the garrison would be able to steal through the cordon and
secure entrance into the building: the gauntlet, in the latter
case, would be more difficult than in the former, inasmuch as
it would be necessary first to open communication with Colonel
Preston, and to establish a perfect understanding before the task
could be attempted.</p>

<p>Deerfoot turned to the right, so as to pass around the camp-fire,
but his advance was with a caution which can hardly be pictured.
Ned Preston could not hear the slightest sound, and where the
darkness was so deep it was hard work to keep informed of his
movements.</p>

<p>When the Shawanoe stopped, he merely reached his hand back and
touched Ned, who did the same to Blossom; when the start was made
again, a slight sibilant sound, which a listening Indian twenty
feet distant would not have noticed, told the fact. No one ventured
to speak, even in the most guarded whisper.</p>

<p>Had Deerfoot been alone, he would have advanced much faster;
but he gave his companions time to raise their feet and put them
down again with such slowness and care that not a leaf was overturned.</p>

<p>Blossom Brown did much better than Preston anticipated. The lad
understood the need of this elaborate caution, and as he had the
two in front of him, there was no excuse for his making a false
step. Once he began a sentence in a husky whisper, but before
it was half finished his young master gripped him by the shoulder,
as if with an iron vise, and the attempt was not repeated.</p>

<p>After a time, which seemed almost interminable, the camp-fire
was flanked, though still in sight. The situation of the three,
as a consequence, became more delicate and perilous than before;
for, to effect a safe withdrawal from the neighborhood, they would
have to pass through the lines again, while there could be no
doubt "the woods were full" of other warriors.</p>

<p>Suddenly the serpent-like hiss of the Shawanoe sounded, and all
three came to a stand-still. This was scarcely done when Deerfoot,
for the first time since the reconnoissance proper began, broke
silence by exclaiming, in a voice just audible,</p>

<p>"<em>Stoop down!</em>"</p>

<p>His order was obeyed (for his companions knew the danger was
imminent) without a word or a second's hesitation.</p>

<p>Their senses were on the alert, but for a minute or two they
neither heard nor saw anything to explain the cause of the alarm
of their guide. At the end of the brief spell, a faint rustling
was noticed near them, and the listeners held their very breath.</p>

<p>This disturbance of the leaves must have been caused by the feet
of Wyandot warriors, who were altogether closer than was comfortable
for the lads crouching on the ground. In the gloom, deepened by
the shadow of the wood, it was impossible to see a half dozen
feet; but while Ned Preston was peering through the darkness in
the direction whence came the noise, a figure suddenly passed
across the field of vision between him and the camp-fire.</p>

<p>Looking in the latter direction, he could see something moving
before the light. That which arrested the attention of Ned was
the head and shoulders of an Indian warrior, who was gliding with
a silence which led the spectator to suspect at first he was deceived.
But the contour of the scalp-lock, shoulders and chest was unmistakable.</p>

<p>The first had scarcely vanished, when a second and a third followed
in precisely the same fashion; but though the eye strained itself
to catch sight of more, none appeared. The three were all who
came so near detecting the boys.</p>

<p>Ned Preston and Blossom Brown felt that the perfect caution displayed
by the Shawanoe was more than repaid; for had it been less, the
hostiles would have learned their presence before they themselves
were detected.</p>

<p>All at once young Preston became aware that Deerfoot was gone;
he had quietly departed, as was his custom, and would return when
he saw fit. Ned crept far enough backward to allow him to whisper
the fact to Blossom, without any risk of being heard by other
ears no matter how near them.</p>

<p>A full half hour passed, when the Shawanoe returned as silently
as he had departed.</p>

<p>As Preston suspected, he had been off on a reconnoissance, where
he wanted no companions. He announced the result in the alarming
words&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wyandots are everywhere; we cannot enter the fort."</p>
