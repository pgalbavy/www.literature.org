<P>The mob had already assembled when the confession
terminated. The king's children next arrived  -  the Princess
Charlotte, a beautiful, fair-haired child, with tears in her
eyes, and the Duke of Gloucester, a boy eight or nine years
old, whose tearless eyes and curling lip revealed a growing
pride. He had wept all night long, but would not show his
grief before the people.</P>
<P>Charles's heart melted within him at the sight of those two
children, whom he had not seen for two years and whom he now
met at the moment of death. He turned to brush away a tear,
and then, summoning up all his firmness, drew his daughter
toward him, recommending her to be pious and resigned. Then
he took the boy upon his knee.</P>
<P>&quot;My son,&quot; he said to him, &quot;you saw a great number of people
in the streets as you came here. These men are going to
behead your father. Do not forget that. Perhaps some day
they will want to make you king, instead of the Prince of
Wales, or the Duke of York, your elder brothers. But you are
not the king, my son, and can never be so while they are
alive. Swear to me, then, never to let them put a crown upon
your head unless you have a legal right to the crown. For
one day  -  listen, my son  -  one day, if you do so, they
will doom you to destruction, head and crown, too, and then
you will not be able to die with a calm conscience, as I
die. Swear, my son.&quot;</P>
<P>The child stretched out his little hand toward that of his
father and said, &quot;I swear to your majesty.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Henry,&quot; said Charles, &quot;call me your father.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Father,&quot; replied the child, &quot;I swear to you that they shall
kill me sooner than make me king.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good, my child. Now kiss me; and you, too, Charlotte. Never
forget me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! never, never!&quot; cried both the children, throwing their
arms around their father's neck.</P>
<P>&quot;Farewell,&quot; said Charles, &quot;farewell, my children. Take them
away, Juxon; their tears will deprive me of the courage to
die.&quot;</P>
<P>Juxon led them away, and this time the doors were left open.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Athos, in his concealment, waited in vain the
signal to recommence his work. Two long hours he waited in
terrible inaction. A deathlike silence reigned in the room
above. At last he determined to discover the cause of this
stillness. He crept from his hole and stood, hidden by the
black drapery, beneath the scaffold. Peeping out from the
drapery, he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers
around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace
swaying and groaning like the sea.</P>
<P>&quot;What is the matter, then?&quot; he asked himself, trembling more
than the wind-swayed cloth he was holding back. &quot;The people
are hurrying on, the soldiers under arms, and among the
spectators I see D'Artagnan. What is he waiting for? What is
he looking at? Good God! have they allowed the headsman to
escape?&quot;</P>
<P>Suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the
square. The sound of heavy steps was heard above his head.
The next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with
the weight of an advancing procession, and the eager faces
of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom
of his heart had prevented him till then believing. At the
same moment a well-known voice above him pronounced these
words:</P>
<P>&quot;Colonel, I want to speak to the people.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos shuddered from head to foot. It was the king speaking
on the scaffold.</P>
<P>In fact, after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of
bread, Charles, weary of waiting for death, had suddenly
decided to go to meet it and had given the signal for
movement. Then the two wings of the window facing the square
had been thrown open, and the people had seen silently
advancing from the interior of the vast chamber, first, a
masked man, who, carrying an axe in his hand, was recognized
as the executioner. He approached the block and laid his axe
upon it. Behind him, pale indeed, but marching with a firm
step, was Charles Stuart, who advanced between two priests,
followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside at
the execution and attended by two files of partisans who
took their places on opposite sides of the scaffold.</P>
<P>The sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged
sensation. Every one was full of curiosity as to who that
unknown executioner could be who presented himself so
opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle,
when the people believed it had been postponed until the
following day. All gazed at him searchingly.</P>
<P>But they could discern nothing but a man of middle height,
dressed in black, apparently of a certain age, for the end
of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that
hid his features.</P>
<P>The king's request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an
affirmative sign, for in firm, sonorous accents, which
vibrated in the depths of Athos's heart, the king began his
speech, explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of
the kingdom.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Athos to himself, &quot;is it indeed possible that I
hear what I hear and that I see what I see? Is it possible
that God has abandoned His representative on earth and left
him to die thus miserably? And I have not seen him! I have
not said adieu to him!&quot;</P>
<P>A noise was heard like that the instrument of death would
make if moved upon the block.</P>
<P>&quot;Do not touch the axe,&quot; said the king, and resumed his
speech.</P>
<P>At the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around
upon the people. Then unfastening the diamond ornament which
the queen had sent him, he placed it in the hands of the
priest who accompanied Juxon. Then he drew from his breast a
little cross set in diamonds, which, like the order, had
been the gift of Henrietta Maria.</P>
<P>&quot;Sir,&quot; said he to the priest, &quot;I shall keep this cross in my
hand till the last moment. Take it from me when I am  - 
dead.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sire,&quot; said a voice, which Athos recognized as that of
Aramis.</P>
<P>He then took his hat from his head and threw it on the
ground. One by one he undid the buttons of his doublet, took
it off and deposited it by the side of his hat. Then, as it
was cold, he asked for his gown, which was brought to him.</P>
<P>All the preparations were made with a frightful calmness.
One would have thought the king was going to bed and not to
his coffin.</P>
<P>&quot;Will these be in your way?&quot; he said to the executioner,
raising his long locks; &quot;if so, they can be tied up.&quot;</P>
<P>Charles accompanied these words with a look designed to
penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman. His cake, noble
gaze forced the man to turn away his head. But after the
searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes
of Aramis.</P>
<P>The king, seeing that he did not reply, repeated his
question.</P>
<P>&quot;It will do,&quot; replied the man, in a tremulous voice, &quot;if you
separate them across the neck.&quot;</P>
<P>The king parted his hair with his hands, and looking at the
block he said:</P>
<P>&quot;This block is very low, is there no other to be had?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is the usual block,&quot; answered the man in the mask.</P>
<P>&quot;Do you think you can behead me with a single blow?&quot; asked
the king.</P>
<P>&quot;I hope so,&quot; was the reply. There was something so strange
in these three words that everybody, except the king,
shuddered.</P>
<P>&quot;I do not wish to be taken by surprise,&quot; added the king. &quot;I
shall kneel down to pray; do not strike then.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When shall I strike?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When I shall lay my head on the block and say `Remember!'
then strike boldly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said the king to those around him, &quot;I leave you
to brave the tempest; I go before you to a kingdom which
knows no storms. Farewell.&quot;</P>
<P>He looked at Aramis and made a special sign to him with his
head.</P>
<P>&quot;Now,&quot; he continued, &quot;withdraw a little and let me say my
prayer, I beseech you. You, also, stand aside,&quot; he said to
the masked man. &quot;It is only for a moment and I know that I
belong to you; but remember that you are not to strike till
I give the signal.&quot;</P>
<P>Then he knelt down, made the sign of the cross, and lowering
his face to the planks, as if he would have kissed them,
said in a low tone, in French, &quot;Comte de la Fere, are you
there?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, your majesty,&quot; he answered, trembling.</P>
<P>&quot;Faithful friend, noble heart!&quot; said the king, &quot;I should not
have been rescued. I have addressed my people and I have
spoken to God; last of all I speak to you. To maintain a
cause which I believed sacred I have lost the throne and my
children their inheritance. A million in gold remains; it is
buried in the cellars of Newcastle Keep. You only know that
this money exists. Make use of it, then, whenever you think
it will be most useful, for my eldest son's welfare. And
now, farewell.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Farewell, saintly, martyred majesty,&quot; lisped Athos, chilled
with terror.</P>
<P>A moment's silence ensued and then, in a full, sonorous
voice, the king exclaimed: &quot;Remember!&quot;</P>
<P>He had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the
scaffold and where Athos stood immovable a warm drop fell
upon his brow. He reeled back with a shudder and the same
moment the drops became a crimson cataract.</P>
<P>Athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if
bewildered or stunned. At last he rose and taking his
handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the martyred king.
Then as the crowd gradually dispersed he leaped down, crept
from behind the drapery, glided between two horses, mingled
with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the inn.</P>
<P>Having gained his room he raised his hand to his face, and
observing that his fingers were covered with the monarch's
blood, fell down insensible.</P></article>
