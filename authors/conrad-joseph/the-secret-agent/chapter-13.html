<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The enormous iron padlock on the doors of the wall cupboard was
the only object in the room on which the eye could rest without
becoming afflicted by the miserable unloveliness of forms and
the poverty of material. Unsaleable in the ordinary course of
business on account of its noble proportions, it had been ceded
to the Professor for a few pence by a marine dealer in the east
of London.  The room was large, clean, respectable, and poor with
that poverty suggesting the starvation of every human need except
mere bread.  There was nothing on the walls but the paper, an
expanse of arsenical green, soiled with indelible smudges here
and there, and with stains resembling faded maps of uninhabited
continents.</p>

<p>At a deal table near a window sat Comrade Ossipon, holding his
head between his fists.  The Professor, dressed in his only suit
of shoddy tweeds, but flapping to and fro on the bare boards a
pair of incredibly dilapidated slippers, had thrust his hands
deep into the overstrained pockets of his jacket.  He was relating
to his robust guest a visit he had lately been paying to the Apostle
Michaelis.  The Perfect Anarchist had even been unbending a little.</p>

<p>"The fellow didn’t know anything of Verloc’s death.  Of course! 
He never looks at the newspapers.  They make him too sad, he says. 
But never mind.  I walked into his cottage.  Not a soul anywhere. 
I had to shout half-a-dozen times before he answered me.  I thought
he was fast asleep yet, in bed.  But not at all.  He had been
writing his book for four hours already.  He sat in that tiny
cage in a litter of manuscript. There was a half-eaten raw carrot
on the table near him.  His breakfast. He lives on a diet of raw
carrots and a little milk now."</p>

<p>"How does he look on it?" asked Comrade Ossipon listlessly.</p>

<p>"Angelic. . . . I picked up a handful of his pages from the floor. 
The poverty of reasoning is astonishing.  He has no logic.  He
can’t think consecutively.  But that’s nothing.  He has divided
his biography into three parts, entitled—‘Faith, Hope, Charity.’ 
He is elaborating now the idea of a world planned out like an
immense and nice hospital, with gardens and flowers, in which
the strong are to devote themselves to the nursing of the weak."</p>

<p>The Professor paused.</p>

<p>"Conceive you this folly, Ossipon?  The weak!  The source of
all evil on this earth!" he continued with his grim assurance. 
"I told him that I dreamt of a world like shambles, where the
weak would be taken in hand for utter extermination."</p>

<p>"Do you understand, Ossipon?  The source of all evil!  They are
our sinister masters—the weak, the flabby, the silly, the cowardly,
the faint of heart, and the slavish of mind.  They have power. 
They are the multitude.  Theirs is the kingdom of the earth. 
Exterminate, exterminate!  That is the only way of progress. 
It is!  Follow me, Ossipon.  First the great multitude of the
weak must go, then the only relatively strong.  You see?  First
the blind, then the deaf and the dumb, then the halt and the lame—and
so on.  Every taint, every vice, every prejudice, every convention
must meet its doom."</p>

<p>"And what remains?" asked Ossipon in a stifled voice.</p>

<p>"I remain—if I am strong enough," asserted the sallow little
Professor, whose large ears, thin like membranes, and standing
far out from the sides of his frail skull, took on suddenly a
deep red tint.</p>

<p>"Haven’t I suffered enough from this oppression of the weak?"
he continued forcibly.  Then tapping the breast-pocket of his
jacket: "And yet <em>I am</em> the force," he went on.  "But the
time!  The time!  Give me time!  Ah! that multitude, too stupid
to feel either pity or fear. Sometimes I think they have everything
on their side.  Everything—even death—my own weapon."</p>

<p>"Come and drink some beer with me at the Silenus," said the robust
Ossipon after an interval of silence pervaded by the rapid flap,
flap of the slippers on the feet of the Perfect Anarchist.  This
last accepted. He was jovial that day in his own peculiar way. 
He slapped Ossipon’s shoulder.</p>

<p>"Beer!  So be it!  Let us drink and he merry, for we are strong,
and to-morrow we die."</p>

<p>He busied himself with putting on his boots, and talked meanwhile
in his curt, resolute tones.</p>

<p>"What’s the matter with you, Ossipon?  You look glum and seek
even my company.  I hear that you are seen constantly in places
where men utter foolish things over glasses of liquor.  Why? 
Have you abandoned your collection of women?  They are the weak
who feed the strong—eh?"</p>

<p>He stamped one foot, and picked up his other laced boot, heavy,
thick-soled, unblacked, mended many times.  He smiled to himself
grimly.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Ossipon, terrible man, has ever one of your victims
killed herself for you—or are your triumphs so far incomplete—for
blood alone puts a seal on greatness?  Blood.  Death.  Look at
history."</p>

<p>"You be damned," said Ossipon, without turning his head.</p>

<p>"Why?  Let that be the hope of the weak, whose theology has invented
hell for the strong.  Ossipon, my feeling for you is amicable
contempt.  You couldn’t kill a fly."</p>

<p>But rolling to the feast on the top of the omnibus the Professor
lost his high spirits.  The contemplation of the multitudes thronging
the pavements extinguished his assurance under a load of doubt
and uneasiness which he could only shake off after a period of
seclusion in the room with the large cupboard closed by an enormous
padlock.</p>

<p>"And so," said over his shoulder Comrade Ossipon, who sat on
the seat behind.  "And so Michaelis dreams of a world like a beautiful
and cheery hospital."</p>

<p>"Just so.  An immense charity for the healing of the weak," assented
the Professor sardonically.</p>

<p>"That’s silly," admitted Ossipon.  "You can’t heal weakness. 
But after all Michaelis may not be so far wrong.  In two hundred
years doctors will rule the world.  Science reigns already.  It
reigns in the shade maybe—but it reigns.  And all science must
culminate at last in the science of healing—not the weak, but
the strong.  Mankind wants to live—to live."</p>

<p>"Mankind," asserted the Professor with a self-confident glitter
of his iron-rimmed spectacles, "does not know what it wants."</p>

<p>"But you do," growled Ossipon.  "Just now you’ve been crying
for time—time.  Well.  The doctors will serve you out your time—if
you are good.  You profess yourself to be one of the strong—because
you carry in your pocket enough stuff to send yourself and, say,
twenty other people into eternity.  But eternity is a damned hole. 
It’s time that you need. You—if you met a man who could give you
for certain ten years of time, you would call him your master."</p>

<p>"My device is: No God!  No Master," said the Professor sententiously
as he rose to get off the ’bus.</p>

<p>Ossipon followed.  "Wait till you are lying flat on your back
at the end of your time," he retorted, jumping off the footboard
after the other. "Your scurvy, shabby, mangy little bit of time,"
he continued across the street, and hopping on to the curbstone.</p>

<p>"Ossipon, I think that you are a humbug," the Professor said,
opening masterfully the doors of the renowned Silenus.  And when
they had established themselves at a little table he developed
further this gracious thought.  "You are not even a doctor.  But
you are funny.  Your notion of a humanity universally putting
out the tongue and taking the pill from pole to pole at the bidding
of a few solemn jokers is worthy of the prophet.  Prophecy!  What’s
the good of thinking of what will be!" He raised his glass.  "To
the destruction of what is," he said calmly.</p>

<p>He drank and relapsed into his peculiarly close manner of silence. 
The thought of a mankind as numerous as the sands of the sea-shore,
as indestructible, as difficult to handle, oppressed him.  The
sound of exploding bombs was lost in their immensity of passive
grains without an echo.  For instance, this Verloc affair.  Who
thought of it now?</p>

<p>Ossipon, as if suddenly compelled by some mysterious force, pulled
a much-folded newspaper out of his pocket.  The Professor raised
his head at the rustle.</p>

<p>"What’s that paper?  Anything in it?" he asked.</p>

<p>Ossipon started like a scared somnambulist.</p>

<p>"Nothing.  Nothing whatever.  The thing’s ten days old.  I forgot
it in my pocket, I suppose."</p>

<p>But he did not throw the old thing away.  Before returning it
to his pocket he stole a glance at the last lines of a paragraph. 
They ran thus: "<em>An impenetrable mystery seems destined to
hang for ever over this act of madness or despair</em>."</p>

<p>Such were the end words of an item of news headed: "Suicide of
Lady Passenger from a cross-Channel Boat."  Comrade Ossipon was
familiar with the beauties of its journalistic style.  "<em>An
impenetrable mystery seems destined to hang for ever</em>. . .
. "  He knew every word by heart.  "<em>An impenetrable mystery</em>.
. . . "</p>

<p>And the robust anarchist, hanging his head on his breast, fell
into a long reverie.</p>

<p>He was menaced by this thing in the very sources of his existence. 
He could not issue forth to meet his various conquests, those
that he courted on benches in Kensington Gardens, and those he
met near area railings, without the dread of beginning to talk
to them of an impenetrable mystery destined. . . . He was becoming
scientifically afraid of insanity lying in wait for him amongst
these lines.  "<em>To hang for ever over</em>."  It was an obsession,
a torture.  He had lately failed to keep several of these appointments,
whose note used to be an unbounded trustfulness in the language
of sentiment and manly tenderness.  The confiding disposition
of various classes of women satisfied the needs of his self-love,
and put some material means into his hand.  He needed it to live. 
It was there.  But if he could no longer make use of it, he ran
the risk of starving his ideals and his body . . . "<em>This act
of madness or despair</em>."</p>

<p>"An impenetrable mystery" was sure "to hang for ever" as far
as all mankind was concerned.  But what of that if he alone of
all men could never get rid of the cursed knowledge?  And Comrade
Ossipon’s knowledge was as precise as the newspaper man could
make it—up to the very threshold of the "<em>mystery destined
to hang for ever</em>. . . ."</p>

<p>Comrade Ossipon was well informed.  He knew what the gangway
man of the steamer had seen: "A lady in a black dress and a black
veil, wandering at midnight alongside, on the quay.  ‘Are you
going by the boat, ma’am,’ he had asked her encouragingly.  ‘This
way.’  She seemed not to know what to do.  He helped her on board. 
She seemed weak."</p>

<p>And he knew also what the stewardess had seen: A lady in black
with a white face standing in the middle of the empty ladies’
cabin.  The stewardess induced her to lie down there.  The lady
seemed quite unwilling to speak, and as if she were in some awful
trouble.  The next the stewardess knew she was gone from the ladies’
cabin.  The stewardess then went on deck to look for her, and
Comrade Ossipon was informed that the good woman found the unhappy
lady lying down in one of the hooded seats.  Her eyes were open,
but she would not answer anything that was said to her.  She seemed
very ill.  The stewardess fetched the chief steward, and those
two people stood by the side of the hooded seat consulting over
their extraordinary and tragic passenger.  They talked in audible
whispers (for she seemed past hearing) of St Malo and the Consul
there, of communicating with her people in England.  Then they
went away to arrange for her removal down below, for indeed by
what they could see of her face she seemed to them to be dying. 
But Comrade Ossipon knew that behind that white mask of despair
there was struggling against terror and despair a vigour of vitality,
a love of life that could resist the furious anguish which drives
to murder and the fear, the blind, mad fear of the gallows.  He
knew.  But the stewardess and the chief steward knew nothing,
except that when they came back for her in less than five minutes
the lady in black was no longer in the hooded seat.  She was nowhere. 
She was gone.  It was then five o’clock in the morning, and it
was no accident either.  An hour afterwards one of the steamer’s
hands found a wedding ring left lying on the seat.  It had stuck
to the wood in a bit of wet, and its glitter caught the man’s
eye.  There was a date, 24th June 1879, engraved inside.  "<em>An
impenetrable mystery is destined to hang for ever</em>. . . .
"</p>

<p>And Comrade Ossipon raised his bowed head, beloved of various
humble women of these isles, Apollo-like in the sunniness of its
bush of hair.</p>

<p>The Professor had grown restless meantime.  He rose.</p>

<p>"Stay," said Ossipon hurriedly.  "Here, what do you know of madness
and despair?"</p>

<p>The Professor passed the tip of his tongue on his dry, thin lips,
and said doctorally:</p>

<p>"There are no such things.  All passion is lost now.  The world
is mediocre, limp, without force.  And madness and despair are
a force.  And force is a crime in the eyes of the fools, the weak
and the silly who rule the roost.  You are mediocre.  Verloc,
whose affair the police has managed to smother so nicely, was
mediocre.  And the police murdered him. He was mediocre.  Everybody
is mediocre.  Madness and despair!  Give me that for a lever,
and I’ll move the world.  Ossipon, you have my cordial scorn. 
You are incapable of conceiving even what the fat-fed citizen
would call a crime.  You have no force."  He paused, smiling sardonically
under the fierce glitter of his thick glasses.</p>

<p>"And let me tell you that this little legacy they say you’ve
come into has not improved your intelligence.  You sit at your
beer like a dummy. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Will you have it?" said Ossipon, looking up with an idiotic
grin.</p>

<p>"Have what?"</p>

<p>"The legacy.  All of it."</p>

<p>The incorruptible Professor only smiled.  His clothes were all
but falling off him, his boots, shapeless with repairs, heavy
like lead, let water in at every step.  He said:</p>

<p>"I will send you by-and-by a small bill for certain chemicals
which I shall order to-morrow.  I need them badly.  Understood—eh?"</p>

<p>Ossipon lowered his head slowly.  He was alone.  "<em>An impenetrable
mystery</em>. . . . "  It seemed to him that suspended in the
air before him he saw his own brain pulsating to the rhythm of
an impenetrable mystery. It was diseased clearly. . . .  "<em>This
act of madness or despair</em>."</p>

<p>The mechanical piano near the door played through a valse cheekily,
then fell silent all at once, as if gone grumpy.</p>

<p>Comrade Ossipon, nicknamed the Doctor, went out of the Silenus
beer-hall. At the door he hesitated, blinking at a not too splendid
sunlight—and the paper with the report of the suicide of a lady
was in his pocket.  His heart was beating against it.  The suicide
of a lady—<em>this act of madness or despair</em>.</p>

<p>He walked along the street without looking where he put his feet;
and he walked in a direction which would not bring him to the
place of appointment with another lady (an elderly nursery governess
putting her trust in an Apollo-like ambrosial head).  He was walking
away from it. He could face no woman.  It was ruin.  He could
neither think, work, sleep, nor eat.  But he was beginning to
drink with pleasure, with anticipation, with hope.  It was ruin. 
His revolutionary career, sustained by the sentiment and trustfulness
of many women, was menaced by an impenetrable mystery—the mystery
of a human brain pulsating wrongfully to the rhythm of journalistic
phrases.  " . . . <em>Will hang for ever over this act</em>. .
. . It was inclining towards the gutter . . . <em>of madness or
despair</em>."</p>

<p>"I am seriously ill," he muttered to himself with scientific
insight. Already his robust form, with an Embassy’s secret-service
money (inherited from Mr Verloc) in his pockets, was marching
in the gutter as if in training for the task of an inevitable
future.  Already he bowed his broad shoulders, his head of ambrosial
locks, as if ready to receive the leather yoke of the sandwich
board.  As on that night, more than a week ago, Comrade Ossipon
walked without looking where he put his feet, feeling no fatigue,
feeling nothing, seeing nothing, hearing not a sound. "<em>An
impenetrable mystery</em>. . . ."  He walked disregarded. . .
.  "<em>This act of madness or despair</em>."</p>

<p>And the incorruptible Professor walked too, averting his eyes
from the odious multitude of mankind.  He had no future.  He disdained
it.  He was a force.  His thoughts caressed the images of ruin
and destruction.  He walked frail, insignificant, shabby, miserable—and
terrible in the simplicity of his idea calling madness and despair
to the regeneration of the world.  Nobody looked at him.  He passed
on unsuspected and deadly, like a pest in the street full of men.</p>
