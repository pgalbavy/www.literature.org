<p>The Chateau du Glandier is one of the oldest chateaux in the
Ile de France, where so many building remains of the feudal period
are still standing. Built originally in the heart of the forest,
in the reign of Philip le Bel, it now could be seen a few hundred
yards from the road leading from the village of Sainte-Genevieve
to Monthery. A mass of inharmonious structures, it is dominated
by a donjon. When the visitor has mounted the crumbling steps
of this ancient donjon, he reaches a little plateau where, in
the seventeenth century, Georges Philibert de Sequigny, Lord of
the Glandier, Maisons-Neuves and other places, built the existing
town in an abominably rococo style of architecture.</p>

<p>It was in this place, seemingly belonging entirely to the past,
that Professor Stangerson and his daughter installed themselves
to lay the foundations for the science of the future. Its solitude,
in the depths of woods, was what, more than all, had pleased them.
They would have none to witness their labours and intrude on their
hopes, but the aged stones and grand old oaks. The Glandier&mdash;ancient
Glandierum&mdash;was so called from the quantity of glands (acorns)
which, in all times, had been gathered in that neighbourhood.
This land, of present mournful interest, had fallen back, owing
to the negligence or abandonment of its owners, into the wild
character of primitive nature. The buildings alone, which were
hidden there, had preserved traces of their strange metamorphoses.
Every age had left on them its imprint; a bit of architecture
with which was bound up the remembrance of some terrible event,
some bloody adventure. Such was the chateau in which science had
taken refuge&mdash;a place seemingly designed to be the theatre of
mysteries, terror, and death.</p>

<p>Having explained so far, I cannot refrain from making one further
reflection. If I have lingered a little over this description
of the Glandier, it is not because I have reached the right moment
for creating the necessary atmosphere for the unfolding of the
tragedy before the eyes of the reader. Indeed, in all this matter,
my first care will be to be as simple as is possible. I have no
ambition to be an author. An author is always something of a romancer,
and God knows, the mystery of "The Yellow Room" is quite full
enough of real tragic horror to require no aid from literary effects.
I am, and only desire to be, a faithful "reporter." My duty is
to report the event; and I place the event in its frame&mdash;that
is all. It is only natural that you should know where the things
happened.</p>

<p>I return to Monsieur Stangerson. When he bought the estate, fifteen
years before the tragedy with which we are engaged occurred, the
Chateau du Glandier had for a long time been unoccupied. Another
old chateau in the neighbourhood, built in the fourteenth century
by Jean de Belmont, was also abandoned, so that that part of the
country was very little inhabited. Some small houses on the side
of the road leading to Corbeil, an inn, called the "Auberge du
Donjon," which offered passing hospitality to waggoners; these
were about all to represent civilisation in this out-of-the-way
part of the country, but a few leagues from the capital.</p>

<p>But this deserted condition of the place had been the determining
reason for the choice made by Monsieur Stangerson and his daughter.
Monsieur Stangerson was already celebrated. He had returned from
America, where his works had made a great stir. The book which
he had published at Philadelphia, on the "Dissociation of Matter
by Electric Action," had aroused opposition throughout the whole
scientific world. Monsieur Stangerson was a Frenchman, but of
American origin. Important matters relating to a legacy had kept
him for several years in the United States, where he had continued
the work begun by him in France, whither he had returned in possession
of a large fortune. This fortune was a great boon to him; for,
though he might have made millions of dollars by exploiting two
or three of his chemical discoveries relative to new processes
of dyeing, it was always repugnant to him to use for his own private
gain the wonderful gift of invention he had received from nature.
He considered he owed it to mankind, and all that his genius brought
into the world went, by this philosophical view of his duty, into
the public lap.</p>

<p>If he did not try to conceal his satisfaction at coming into
possession of this fortune, which enabled him to give himself
up to his passion for pure science, he had equally to rejoice,
it seemed to him, for another cause. Mademoiselle Stangerson was,
at the time when her father returned from America and bought the
Glandier estate, twenty years of age. She was exceedingly pretty,
having at once the Parisian grace of her mother, who had died
in giving her birth, and all the splendour, all the riches of
the young American blood of her parental grandfather, William
Stangerson. A citizen of Philadelphia, William Stangerson had
been obliged to become naturalised in obedience to family exigencies
at the time of his marriage with a French lady, she who was to
be the mother of the illustrious Stangerson. In that way the professor’s
French nationality is accounted for.</p>

<p>Twenty years of age, a charming blonde, with blue eyes, milk-white
complexion, and radiant with divine health, Mathilde Stangerson
was one of the most beautiful marriageable girls in either the
old or the new world. It was her father’s duty, in spite of the
inevitable pain which a separation from her would cause him, to
think of her marriage; and he was fully prepared for it. Nevertheless,
he buried himself and his child at the Glandier at the moment
when his friends were expecting him to bring her out into society.
Some of them expressed their astonishment, and to their questions
he answered: "It is my daughter’s wish. I can refuse her nothing.
She has chosen the Glandier."</p>

<p>Interrogated in her turn, the young girl replied calmly: "Where
could we work better than in this solitude?" For Mademoiselle
Stangerson had already begun to collaborate with her father in
his work. It could not at the time be imagined that her passion
for science would lead her so far as to refuse all the suitors
who presented themselves to her for over fifteen years. So secluded
was the life led by the two, father and daughter, that they showed
themselves only at a few official receptions and, at certain times
in the year, in two or three friendly drawing-rooms, where the
fame of the professor and the beauty of Mathilde made a sensation.
The young girl’s extreme reserve did not at first discourage suitors;
but at the end of a few years, they tired of their quest.</p>

<p>One alone persisted with tender tenacity and deserved the name
of "eternal fiance," a name he accepted with melancholy resignation;
that was Monsieur Robert Darzac. Mademoiselle Stangerson was now
no longer young, and it seemed that, having found no reason for
marrying at five-and-thirty, she would never find one. But such
an argument evidently found no acceptance with Monsieur Robert
Darzac. He continued to pay his court&mdash;if the delicate and tender
attention with which he ceaselessly surrounded this woman of five-and-thirty
could be called courtship&mdash;in face of her declared intention never
to marry.</p>

<p>Suddenly, some weeks before the events with which we are occupied,
a report&mdash;to which nobody attached any importance, so incredible
did it sound&mdash;was spread about Paris, that Mademoiselle Stangerson
had at last consented to "crown" the inextinguishable flame of
Monsieur Robert Darzac! It needed that Monsieur Robert Darzac
himself should not deny this matrimonial rumour to give it an
appearance of truth, so unlikely did it seem to be well founded.
One day, however, Monsieur Stangerson, as he was leaving the Academy
of Science, announced that the marriage of his daughter and Monsieur
Robert Darzac would be celebrated in the privacy of the Chateau
du Glandier, as soon as he and his daughter had put the finishing
touches to their report summing up their labours on the "Dissociation
of Matter." The new household would install itself in the Glandier,
and the son-in-law would lend his assistance in the work to which
the father and daughter had dedicated their lives.</p>

<p>The scientific world had barely had time to recover from the
effect of this news, when it learned of the attempted assassination
of Mademoiselle under the extraordinary conditions which we have
detailed and which our visit to the chateau was to enable us to
ascertain with yet greater precision. I have not hesitated to
furnish the reader with all these retrospective details, known
to me through my business relations with Monsieur Robert Darzac.
On crossing the threshold of The "Yellow Room" he was as well
posted as I was.</p>
