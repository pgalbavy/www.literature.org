<p>Crailey came home the next day with a new poem, but no fish.
He lounged up the stairs, late in the afternoon, humming cheerfully
to himself, and, dropping his rod in a corner of Tom's office,
laid the poem on the desk before his partner, produced a large,
newly-replenished flask, opened it, stretched himself comfortably
upon a capacious horse-hair sofa, drank a deep draught, chuckled
softly, and requested Mr. Vanrevel to set the rhymes to music
immediately.</p>

<p>"Try it on your instrument," he said. "It's a simple verse about
nothing but stars, and you can work it out in twenty minutes with
the guitar."</p>

<p>"It is broken," said Tom, not looking up from his work.</p>

<p>"Broken! When?"</p>

<p>"Last night."</p>

<p>"Who broke it?"</p>

<p>"It fell from the table in my room."</p>

<p>"How? Easily mended, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I think I shall not play it soon again."</p>

<p>Crailey swung his long legs off the sofa and abruptly sat upright.
"What's this?" he asked gravely.</p>

<p>Tom pushed his papers away from him, rose and went to the dusty
window that looked to the west, where, at the end of the long
street, the sun was setting behind the ruin of charred timbers
on the bank of the shining river.</p>

<p>"It seems that I played once too often," he said.</p>

<p>Crailey was thoroughly astonished. He took a long, affectionate
pull at the flask and offered it to his partner.</p>

<p>"No," said Tom, turning to him with a troubled face, "and if
I were you, I wouldn't either. These fishing trips of yours&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fishing!" Crailey laughed. "Trips of a poetaster! It's then
I write best, and write I will! There's a poem, and a damned good
one, too, old preacher, in every gill of whiskey, and I'm the
lad that can extract it! Lord! what's better than to be out in
the open, all by yourself in the woods, or on the river? Think
of the long nights alone with the glory of heaven and a good demijohn.
Why, a man's thoughts are like actors performing in the air and
all the crowding stars for audience! You know in your soul you'd
rather have me out there, going it all by myself, than raising
thunder over town. And you know, too, it doesn't tell on me; it
doesn't show! You couldn't guess, to save your life, how much
I've had to-day, now, could you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," returned the other, "I could."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Crailey, good-naturedly, "we weren't talking
of me."  He set down the flask, went to his friend and dropped
a hand lightly on his shoulder. "What made you break the guitar?
Tell me."</p>

<p>"What makes you think I broke it?" asked his partner sharply.</p>

<p>"Tell me why you did it," said Crailey.</p>

<p>And Tom, pacing the room, told him, while Crailey stood in silence,
looking him eagerly in the eye whenever Tom turned his way. The
listener interrupted seldom; once it was to exclaim: "But you
haven't said why you broke the guitar?"</p>

<p>"'If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out!' I ought to have cut
off the hands that played to her."</p>

<p>"And cut your throat for singing to her?"</p>

<p>"She was right!" the other answered, striding up and down the
room. "Right&mdash;a thousand times! in everything she did. That I
should even ap-proach her, was an unspeakable insolence. I had
forgotten, and so, possibly, had she, but I had not even been
properly introduced to her."</p>

<p>"No, you hadn't, that's true," observed Crailey, reflectively.
"You don't seem to have much to reproach her with, Tom."</p>

<p>"Reproach her!" cried the other. "That I should dream she would
speak to me or have anything to do with me, was to cast a doubt
upon her loyalty as a daughter. She was right, I say! And she
did the only thing she could do: rebuked me before them all. No
one ever merited what he got more roundly than I deserved that.
Who was I, in her eyes, that I should besiege her with my importunities,
who but her father's worst enemy?"</p>

<p>Deep anxiety knitted Crailey's brow. "I understood she knew of
the quarrel," he said, thoughtfully. "I saw that, the other evening
when I helped her out of the crowd. She spoke of it on the way
home, I remember; but how did she know that you were Vanrevel?
No one in town would be apt to mention you to her."</p>

<p>"No, but she did know, you see."</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Mr. Gray slowly. "So it seems! Probably her father
told her to avoid you, and described you so that she recognized
you as the man who caught the kitten."</p>

<p>He paused, picked up the flask, and again applied himself to
its contents, his eyes peering over the up-tilted vessel at Tom,
who continued to pace up and down the length of the office. After
a time, Crailey, fumbling in his coat, found a long cheroot, and,
as he lit it, inquired casually:</p>

<p>"Do you remember if she addressed you by name?"</p>

<p>"I think not," Tom answered, halting. "What does it matter?"</p>

<p>Crailey drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"It doesn't," he returned.</p>

<p>"She knew me well enough," said Tom, sadly, as he resumed his
sentry-go.</p>

<p>"Yes," repeated Crailey, deliberately. "So it seems; so it seems!"
He blew a long stream of smoke out into the air before him, and
softly mur-mured again: "So it seems, so it seems."</p>

<p>Silence fell, broken only by the sound of Tom's footsteps, until,
presently, some one informally shouted his name from the street
below. It was only Will Cummings, passing the time of day, but
when Tom turned from the window after answering him, Crailey,
his poem, and his flask were gone.</p>

<p>That evening Vanrevel sat in the dusty office, driving himself
to his work with a sharp goad, for there was a face that came
between him and all else in the world, and a voice that sounded
always in his ears. But the work was done before he rose from
his chair, though he showed a haggard visage as he bent above
his candles to blow them out.</p>

<p>It was eleven o'clock; Crailey had not come back, and Tom knew
that his light-hearted friend would not return for many hours;
and so, having no mind to read, and no belief that he could if
he tried, he went out to walk the streets. He went down to the
river first, and stood for a little while gazing at the ruins
of the two warehouses, and that was like a man with a headache
beating his skull against a wall. As he stood on the blackened
wharf, he saw how the charred beams rose above him against the
sky like a gallows, and it seemed to him that nothing could have
been a better symbol, for here he had hanged his self-respect.
"Reproach her!" He, who had so displayed his imbecility before
her! Had he been her father's best friend, he should have had
too great a sense of shame to dare to speak to her after that
night when her quiet intelligence had exhibited him to himself,
and to all the world, as nought else than a fool&mdash;and a noisy
one at that!</p>

<p>Suddenly a shudder convulsed him; he struck his open palm across
his forehead and spoke aloud, while, from horizon to horizon,
the night air grew thick with the whispered laughter of observing
hobgoblins:</p>

<p>"And even if there had been no stairway, we could have slid down
the hose-line!"</p>

<p>He retraced his steps, a tall, gray figure moving slowly through
the blue darkness, and his lips formed the heart-sick shadow of
a smile when he found that he had unconsciously turned into Carewe
Street. Presently he came to a gap in a hedge, through which he
had sometimes stolen to hear the sound of a harp and a girl's
voice singing; but he did not enter there tonight, though he paused
a moment, his head bowed on his breast.</p>

<p>There came a sound of voices; they seemed to be moving toward
the hedge, toward the gap where he stood; one a man's eager, quick,
but very musical; the other, a girl's, a rich and clear contralto
that passed into Tom's soul like a psalm of rejoicing and like
a scimitar of flame. He shivered, and moved away quickly, but
not before the man's voice, somewhat louder for the moment, came
distinctly from the other side of the hedge:</p>

<p>"After all," said the voice, with a ripple of laughter, "after
all, weren't you a little hard on that poor Mr. Gray?"</p>

<p>Tom did not understand, but he knew the voice. It was that of
Crailey Gray.</p>

<p>He heard the same voice again that night, and again stood unseen.
Long after midnight he was still tramping the streets on his lonely
rounds, when he chanced to pass the Rouen House, which hostelry
bore, to the uninitiated eye, the appearance of having closed
its doors upon all hospitalities for the night, in strict compliance
with the law of the city fathers, yet a slender wand of bright
light might be discovered underneath the street door of the bar-room.</p>

<p>From within the merry retreat issued an uproar of shouting, raucous
laughter and the pounding of glasses on tables, heralding all
too plainly the hypocrisy of the landlord, and possibly that of
the city fathers also. Tom knew what company was gathered there:
gamblers, truckmen, drunken farmers, men from the river steamers
making riot while their boats lay at the wharf, with a motley
gathering of good-for-nothings of the back-alleys, and tippling
clerks from the Main Street stores. There came loud cries for
a song, and, in answer, the voice of Crailey rose over the general
din, somewhat hoarse, and never so musical when he sang as when
he spoke, yet so touching in its dramatic tenderness that soon
the noise fell away, and the roisterers sat quietly to listen.
It was not the first time Ben Jonson's song had stilled a disreputable
company.</p>

<p>"I sent thee late a rosy wreath, Not so much honoring thee, As
giving it the hope that there It might not withered be."</p>

<p>Perhaps, just then, Vanrevel would have wished to hear him sing
anything in the world rather than that, for on Crailey's lips
it carried too much meaning tonight, after the voice in the garden.
And Tom lingered no more near the betraying sliver of light beneath
the door than he had by the gap in the hedge, but went steadily
on his way.</p>

<p>Not far from the hotel he passed a small building brightly lighted
and echoing with unusual clamors of industry: the office of the
Rouen Journal. The press was going, and Mr. Cummings's thin figure
crossed and recrossed the windows, while his voice could be heard
energetically bidding his assistants to "Look alive!" so that
Tom imagined that something might have happened between the Nueces
River and the Rio Grande; but he did not stop to ask the journalist,
for he desired to behold the face of none of his friends until
he had fought out some things within himself. So he strode on
toward nowhere.</p>

<p>Day was breaking when Mr. Gray climbed the stairs to his room.
There were two flights, the ascent of the first of which occupied
about half an hour of Crailey's invaluable time; and the second
might have taken more of it, or possibly consumed the greater
part of the morning, had he received no assistance. But, as he
reclined to meditate upon the first landing, another man entered
the hallway from without, ascended quickly, and Crailey became
pleasantly conscious that two strong hands had lifted him to his
feet; and, presently, that he was being borne aloft upon the new-comer's
back. It seemed quite a journey, yet the motion was soothing,
so he made no effort to open his eyes, until he found himself
gently deposited upon the couch in his own chamber, when he smiled
amiably, and, looking up, discovered his partner standing over
him.</p>

<p>Tom was very pale and there were deep, violet scrawls beneath
his eyes. For once in his life he had come home later than Crailey.</p>

<p>"First time, you know," said Crailey, with difficulty. "You'll
admit first time completely incapable? Often needed guiding hand,
but never&mdash;quite&mdash;before."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom, quietly, "it is the first time I ever saw you
quite finished."</p>

<p>"Think I must be growing old and constitution refuses bear it.
Disgraceful to be seen in condition, yet celebration justified.
H'rah for the news!" He waved his hand wildly. "Old red, white,
and blue! American eagle now kindly proceed to scream! Starspangled
banner intends streaming to all the trade winds! Sea to sea! Glorious
victories on political thieving exhibition&mdash;no, expedition! Everybody
not responsible for the trouble to go and get himself patriotically
killed!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Water!" said the other, feebly. Tom brought the pitcher, and
Crailey, setting his hot lips to it, drank long and deeply; then,
with his friend's assistance, he tied a heavily moistened towel
round his head. "All right very soon and sober again," he muttered,
and lay back upon the pillow with eyes tightly closed in an intense
effort to concentrate his will. When he opened them again, four
or five minutes later, they had marvellously cleared and his look
was self-contained and sane.</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard the news?" He spoke much more easily now.
"It came at midnight to the Journal."</p>

<p>"No; I've been walking in the country."</p>

<p>"The Mexicans crossed the Rio Grande on the twenty-sixth of last
month, captured Captain Thornton and murdered Colonel Crook. That
means war is certain."</p>

<p>"It has been certain for a long time," said Tom. "Polk has forced
it from the first."</p>

<p>"Then it's a devil of a pity he can't be the only man to die!"</p>

<p>"Have they called for volunteers?" asked Tom, going toward the
door.</p>

<p>"No; but if the news is true, they will."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom; and as he reached the hallway he paused. "Can
I help you to undress?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" Crailey sat up, indignantly. "Can't you see
that I'm perfectly sober? It was the merest temporary fit, and
I've shaken it off. Don't you see?" He got upon his feet, staggered,
but shook himself like a dog coming out of the water, and came
to the door with infirm steps.</p>

<p>"You're going to bed, aren't you?" asked Tom. "You'd much better."</p>

<p>"No," answered Crailey. "Are you?</p>

<p>"No. I'm going to work."</p>

<p>"You've been all up night, too, haven't you?" Crailey put his
hand on the other's shoulder. "Were you hunting for me?"</p>

<p>"No; not last night."</p>

<p>Crailey lurched suddenly, and Tom caught him about the waist
to steady him.</p>

<p>"Sweethearting, tippling, vingt-et-un, or poker, eh, Tom?" he
shouted, thickly, with a wild laugh. "Ha, ha, old smug-face, up
to my bad tricks at last!" But, recovering himself immediately,
he pushed the other off at arm's length, and slapped himself smartly
on the brow. "Never mind; all right, all right&mdash;only a bad wave,
now and then. A walk will make me more a man than ever."</p>

<p>"You'd much better go to bed, Crailey."</p>

<p>"I can't. I'm going to change my clothes and go out."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Crailey did not answer, but at that moment the Catholic church-bell,
summoning the faithful to mass, pealed loudly on the morning air;
and the steady glance of Tom Vanrevel rested upon the reckless
eyes of the man beside him as they listened together to its insistent
call. Tom said, gently, almost timidly:</p>

<p>"You have an&mdash;engagement?"</p>

<p>This time the answer came briskly. "Yes; I promised to take Fanchon
to the cemetery before breakfast, to place some flowers on the
grave of the little brother who died. This happens to be his birthday."</p>

<p>It was Tom who averted his eyes, not Crailey.</p>

<p>"Then you'd best hurry," he said, hesitatingly; "I mustn't keep
you,"  and went downstairs to his office with flushed cheeks,
a hanging head, and an expression which would have led a stranger
to believe that he had just been caught in a lie.</p>

<p>He went to the Main Street window, and seated himself upon the
ledge, the only one in the room not too dusty for occupation;
for here, at this hour, Tom had taken his place every morning
since Elizabeth Carewe had come from the convent. The window was
a coign of vantage, commanding the corner of Carewe and Main streets.
Some distance west of the corner, the Catholic church cast its
long shadow across Main Street, and, in order to enter the church,
a person who lived upon Carewe Street must pass the corner, or
else make a half-mile detour and approach from the other direction&mdash;which
the person never did. Tom had thought it out the first night that
the image of Miss Betty had kept him awake&mdash;and that was the first
night Miss Carewe spent in Rouen&mdash;the St. Mary's girl would be
sure to go to mass every day, which was why the window-ledge was
dusted the next morning.</p>

<p>The glass doors of the little corner drug-store caught the early
sun of the hot May morning and became like sheets of polished
brass; a farmer's wagon rattled down the dusty street; a group
of Irish waitresses from the hotel made the boardwalk rattle under
their hurried steps as they went toward the church, talking busily
to one another; and a blinking youth in his shirt-sleeves, who
wore the air of one newly, but not gladly, risen, began to struggle
mournfully with the shutters of Madrillon's bank. A moment later,
Tom heard Crailey come down the stairs, sure of foot and humming
lightly to himself. The door of the office was closed; Crailey
did not look in, but presently appeared, smiling, trim, immaculate,
all in white linen, on the opposite side of the street, and offered
badinage to the boy who toiled at the shutters.</p>

<p>The bell had almost ceased to ring when a lady, dressed plainly
in black, but graceful and tall, came rapidly out of Carewe Street,
turned at the corner by the little drug-store, and went toward
the church. The boy was left staring, for Crailey's banter broke
off in the middle of a word.</p>

<p>He overtook her on the church steps, and they went in together.</p>

<p>That afternoon Fanchon Bareaud told Tom how beautiful her betrothed
had been to her; he had brought her a great bouquet of violets
and lilies-of-the-valley, and had taken her to the cemetery to
place them on the grave of her baby brother, whose birthday it
was. Tears came to Fanchon's eyes as she spoke of her lover's
goodness, and of how wonderfully he had talked as they stood beside
the little grave.</p>

<p>"He was the only one who remembered that this was poor tiny Jean's
birthday!" she said, and sobbed. "He came just after breakfast
and asked me to go out there with him."</p>
