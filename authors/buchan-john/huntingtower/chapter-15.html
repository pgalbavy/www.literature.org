<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>We left Mr. McCunn, full of aches but desperately resolute in
spirit, hobbling by the Auchenlochan road into the village of
Dalquharter. His goal was Mrs. Morran's hen-house, which was Thomas
Yownie's <em>poste de commandement</em>. The rain had come on
again, and, though in other weather there would have been a slow
twilight, already the shadow of night had the world in its grip.
The sea even from the high ground was invisible, and all to westward
and windward was a ragged screen of dark cloud. It was foul weather
for foul deeds.</p>

<p>Thomas Yownie was not in the hen-house, but in Mrs. Morran's
kitchen, and with him were the pug-faced boy known as Old Bill,
and the sturdy figure of Peter Paterson. But the floor was held
by the hostess. She still wore her big boots, her petticoats were
still kilted, and round her venerable head in lieu of a bonnet
was drawn a tartan shawl.</p>

<p>"Eh, Dickson, but I'm blithe to see ye. And, puir man, ye've
been sair mishandled. This is the awfu'est Sabbath day that ever
you and me pit in. I hope it'll be forgiven us.... Whaur's the
young leddy?"</p>

<p>"Dougal was saying she was in the House with Sir Archibald and
the men from the Mains."</p>

<p>"Wae's me!" Mrs. Morran keened. "And what kind o' place is yon
for her? Thae laddies tell me there's boatfu's o' scoondrels landit
at the Garplefit. They'll try the auld Tower, but they'll no'
wait there when they find it toom, and they'll be inside the Hoose
in a jiffy and awa' wi' the puir lassie. Sirs, it maunna be. Ye're
lippenin' to the polis, but in a' my days I never kenned the polis
in time. We maun be up and daein' oorsels. Oh, if I could get
a haud o' that red-heided Dougal...."</p>

<p>As she spoke, there came on the wind the dull reverberation of
an explosion.</p>

<p>"Keep us, what's that?" she cried.</p>

<p>"It's dinnymite," said Peter Paterson.</p>

<p>"That's the end o' the auld Tower," observed Thomas Yownie in
his quiet even voice. "And it's likely the end o' the man Heritage."</p>

<p>"Lord peety us!" the old woman wailed. "And us standin' here
like stookies and no' liftin' a hand. Awa' wi' ye, laddies, and
dae something. Awa' you too, Dickson, or I'll tak' the road mysel'."</p>

<p>"I've got orders," said the Chief of Staff, "no' to move till
the sityation's clear. Napoleon's up at the Tower and Jaikie in
the policies. I maun wait on their reports."</p>

<p>For a moment Mrs. Morran's attention was distracted by Dickson,
who suddenly felt very faint and sat down heavily on a kitchen
chair. "Man, ye're as white as a dish-clout," she exclaimed with
compunction. "Ye're fair wore out, and ye'll have had nae meat
sin' your breakfast. See, and I'll get ye a cup o' tea."</p>

<p>She proved to be in the right, for as soon as Dickson had swallowed
some mouthfuls of her strong scalding brew the colour came back
to his cheeks, and he announced that he felt better. "Ye'll fortify
it wi' a dram," she told him, and produced a black bottle from
her cupboard. "My father aye said that guid whiskey and het tea
keepit the doctor's gig oot o' the close."</p>

<p>The back door opened and Napoleon entered, his thin shanks blue
with cold. He saluted and made his report in a voice shrill with
excitement.</p>

<p>"The Tower has fallen. They've blown in the big door, and the
feck o' them's inside."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Heritage?" was Dickson's anxious inquiry.</p>

<p>"When I last saw him he was up at a windy, shootin'. I think
he's gotten on to the roof. I wouldna wonder but the place is
on fire."</p>

<p>"Here, this is awful," Dickson groaned. "We can't let Mr. Heritage
be killed that way. What strength is the enemy?"</p>

<p>"I counted twenty-seven, and there's stragglers comin' up from
the boats."</p>

<p>"And there's me and you five laddies here, and Dougal and the
others shut up in the House." He stopped in sheer despair. It
was a fix from which the most enlightened business mind showed
no escape. Prudence, inventiveness were no longer in question;
only some desperate course of violence.</p>

<p>"We must create a diversion," he said. "I'm for the Tower, and
you laddies must come with me. We'll maybe see a chance. Oh, but
I wish I had my wee pistol."</p>

<p>"If ye're gaun there, Dickson, I'm comin' wi' ye," Mrs. Morran
announced.</p>

<p>Her words revealed to Dickson the preposterousness of the whole
situation, and for all his anxiety he laughed. "Five laddies,
a middle-aged man and an auld wife," he cried. "Dod, it's pretty
hopeless. It's like the thing in the Bible about the weak things
of the world trying to confound the strong."</p>

<p>"The Bible's whiles richt," Mrs. Morran answered drily. "Come
on, for there's no time to lose."</p>

<p>The door opened again to admit the figure of Wee Jaikie. There
were no tears in his eyes, and his face was very white.</p>

<p>"They're a' round the Hoose," he croaked. "I was up a tree forenent
the verandy and seen them. The lassie ran oot and cried on them
from the top o' the brae, and they a' turned and hunted her back.
Gosh, but it was a near thing. I seen the Captain sklimmin' the
wall, and a muckle man took the lassie and flung her up the ladder.
They got inside just in time and steekit the door, and now the
whole pack is roarin' round the Hoose seekin' a road in. They'll
no' be long over the job, neither."</p>

<p>"What about Mr. Heritage?"</p>

<p>"They're no' heedin' about him any more. The auld Tower's bleezin'."</p>

<p>"Worse and worse," said Dickson. "If the police don't come in
the next ten minutes, they'll be away with the Princess. They've
beaten all Dougal's plans, and it's a straight fight with odds
of six to one. It's not possible."</p>

<p>Mrs. Morran for the first time seemed to lose hope. "Eh, the
puir lassie!" she wailed, and sinking on a chair covered her face
with her shawl.</p>

<p>"Laddies, can you no' think of a plan?" asked Dickson, his voice
flat with despair.</p>

<p>Then Thomas Yownie spoke. So far he had been silent, but under
his tangled thatch of hair, his mind had been busy. Jaikie's report
seemed to bring him to a decision.</p>

<p>"It's gey dark," he said, "and it's gettin' darker."</p>

<p>There was that in his voice which promised something, and Dickson
listened.</p>

<p>"The enemy's mostly foreigners, but Dobson's there and I think
he's a kind of guide to them. Dobson's feared of the polis, and
if we can terrify Dobson he'll terrify the rest."</p>

<p>"Ay, but where are the police?"</p>

<p>"They're no' here yet, but they're comin'. The fear o' them is
aye in Dobson's mind. If he thinks the polis has arrived, he'll
put the wind up the lot.... <em>We</em> maun be the polis."</p>

<p>Dickson could only stare while the Chief of Staff unfolded his
scheme. I do not know to whom the Muse of History will give the
credit of the tactics of "infiltration"&mdash;whether to Ludendorff
or von Hutier or some other proud captain of Germany, or to Foch,
who revised and perfected them. But I know that the same notion
was at this moment of crisis conceived by Thomas Yownie, whom
no parents acknowledged, who slept usually in a coal cellar, and
who had picked up his education among Gorbals closes and along
the wharves of Clyde.</p>

<p>"It's gettin' dark," he said, "and the enemy are that busy tryin'
to break into the Hoose that they'll no' be thinkin' o' their
rear. The five o' us Die-Hards is grand at dodgin' and keepin'
out of sight, and what hinders us to get in among them, so that
they'll hear us but never see us? We're used to the ways o' the
polis, and can imitate them fine. Forbye we've all got our whistles,
which are the same as a bobbie's birl, and Old Bill and Peter
are grand at copyin' a man's voice. Since the Captain is shut
up in the Hoose, the command falls to me, and that's my plan."</p>

<p>With a piece of chalk he drew on the kitchen floor a rough sketch
of the environs of Huntingtower. Peter Paterson was to move from
the shrubberies beyond the verandah, Napoleon from the stables,
Old Bill from the Tower, while Wee Jaikie and Thomas himself were
to advance as if from the Garplefoot, so that the enemy might
fear for his communications. "As soon as one o' ye gets into position
he's to gie the patrol cry, and when each o' ye has heard five
cries, he's to advance. Begin birlin' and roarin' afore ye get
among them, and keep it up till ye're at the Hoose wall. If they've
gotten inside, in ye go after them. I trust each Die-Hard to use
his judgment, and above all to keep out o' sight and no let himsel'
be grippit."</p>

<p>The plan, like all great tactics, was simple, and no sooner was
it expounded than it was put into action. The Die-Hards faded
out of the kitchen like fog-wreaths, and Dickson and Mrs. Morran
were left looking at each other. They did not look long. The bare
feet of Wee Jaikie had not crossed the threshold fifty seconds,
before they were followed by Mrs. Morran's out-of-doors boots
and Dickson's tackets. Arm in arm the two hobbled down the back
path behind the village which led to the South Lodge. The gate
was unlocked, for the warder was busy elsewhere, and they hastened
up the avenue. Far off Dickson thought he saw shapes fleeting
across the park, which he took to be the shock-troops of his own
side, and he seemed to hear snatches of song. Jaikie was giving
tongue, and this was what he sang:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Proley Tarians, arise!<br/>
&nbsp;Wave the Red Flag to the skies,<br/>
&nbsp;Heed nae mair the Fat Man's lees,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stap them doun his throat!<br/>
&nbsp;Nocht to loss except our chains,<br/>
&nbsp;We maun drain oor dearest veins&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;A' the worrld shall be our gains&#11834;"

</p>
</div>
<p>But he tripped over a rabbit wire and thereafter conserved his
breath.</p>

<p>The wind was so loud that no sound reached them from the House,
which blank and immense now loomed before them. Dickson's ears
were alert for the noise of shots or the dull crash of bombs;
hearing nothing, he feared the worst, and hurried Mrs. Morran
at a pace which endangered her life. He had no fear for himself,
arguing that his foes were seeking higher game, and judging, too,
that the main battle must be round the verandah at the other end.
The two passed the shrubbery where the road forked, one path running
to the back door and one to the stables. They took the latter
and presently came out on the downs, with the ravine of the Garple
on their left, the stables in front, and on the right the hollow
of a formal garden running along the west side of the House.</p>

<p>The gale was so fierce, now that they had no wind-break between
them and the ocean, that Mrs. Morran could wrestle with it no
longer, and found shelter in the lee of a clump of rhododendrons.
Darkness had all but fallen, and the house was a black shadow
against the dusky sky, while a confused greyness marked the sea.
The old Tower showed a tooth of masonry; there was no glow from
it, so the fire, which Jaikie had reported, must have died down.
A whaup cried loudly, and very eerily: then another.</p>

<p>The birds stirred up Mrs. Morran. "That's the laddies' patrol,"
she gasped. "Count the cries, Dickson."</p>

<p>Another bird wailed, this time very near. Then there was perhaps
three minutes' silence, till a fainter wheeple came from the direction
of the Tower. "Four," said Dickson, but he waited in vain on the
fifth. He had not the acute hearing of the boys, and could not
catch the faint echo of Peter Paterson's signal beyond the verandah.
The next he heard was a shrill whistle cutting into the wind,
and then others in rapid succession from different quarters, and
something which might have been the hoarse shouting of angry men.</p>

<p>The Gorbals Die-Hards had gone into action.</p>

<p>Dull prose is no medium to tell of that wild adventure. The sober
sequence of the military historian is out of place in recording
deeds that knew not sequence or sobriety. Were I a bard, I would
cast this tale in excited verse, with a lilt which would catch
the speed of the reality. I would sing of Napoleon, not unworthy
of his great namesake, who penetrated to the very window of the
ladies' bedroom, where the framework had been driven in and men
were pouring through; of how there he made such pandemonium with
his whistle that men tumbled back and ran about blindly seeking
for guidance; of how in the long run his pugnacity mastered him,
so that he engaged in combat with an unknown figure and the two
rolled into what had once been a fountain. I would hymn Peter
Paterson, who across tracts of darkness engaged Old Bill in a
conversation which would have done no discredit to a Gallogate
policeman. He pretended to be making reports and seeking orders.
"We've gotten three o' the deevils, sir. What'll we dae wi' them?"
he shouted; and back would come the reply in a slightly more genteel
voice: "Fall them to the rear. Tamson has charge of the prisoners."
Or it would be: "They've gotten pistols, sir. What's the orders?"
and the answer would be: "Stick to your batons. The guns are posted
on the knowe, so we needn't hurry." And over all the din there
would be a perpetual whistling and a yelling of "Hands up!"</p>

<p>I would sing, too, of Wee Jaikie, who was having the red-letter
hour of his life. His fragile form moved like a lizard in places
where no mortal could be expected, and he varied his duties with
impish assaults upon the persons of such as came in his way. His
whistle blew in a man's ear one second and the next yards away.
Sometimes he was moved to song, and unearthly fragments of "Class-conscious
we are" or "Proley Tarians, arise!" mingled with the din, like
the cry of seagulls in a storm. He saw a bright light flare up
within the house which warned him not to enter, but he got as
far as the garden-room, in whose dark corners he made havoc. Indeed
he was almost too successful, for he created panic where he went,
and one or two fired blindly at the quarter where he had last
been heard. These shots were followed by frenzied prohibitions
from Spidel and were not repeated. Presently he felt that aimless
surge of men that is the prelude to flight, and heard Dobson's
great voice roaring in the hall. Convinced that the crisis had
come, he made his way outside, prepared to harass the rear of
any retirement. Tears now flowed down his face, and he could not
have spoken for sobs, but he had never been so happy.</p>

<p>But chiefly would I celebrate Thomas Yownie, for it was he who
brought fear into the heart of Dobson. He had a voice of singular
compass, and from the verandah he made it echo round the House.
The efforts of Old Bill and Peter Paterson had been skilful indeed,
but those of Thomas Yownie were deadly. To some leader beyond
he shouted news: "Robison's just about finished wi' his lot, and
then he'll get the boats." A furious charge upset him, and for
a moment he thought he had been discovered. But it was only Dobson
rushing to Léon, who was leading the men in the doorway. Thomas
fled to the far end of the verandah, and again lifted up his voice.
"All foreigners," he shouted, "except the man Dobson. Ay. Ay.
Ye've got Loudon? Well done!"</p>

<p>It must have been this last performance which broke Dobson's
nerve and convinced him that the one hope lay in a rapid retreat
to the Garplefoot. There was a tumbling of men in the doorway,
a muttering of strange tongues, and the vision of the innkeeper
shouting to Léon and Spidel. For a second he was seen in the faint
reflection that the light in the hall cast as far as the verandah,
a wild figure urging the retreat with a pistol clapped to the
head of those who were too confused by the hurricane of events
to grasp the situation. Some of them dropped over the wall, but
most huddled like sheep through the door on the west side, a jumble
of struggling, panic-stricken mortality. Thomas Yownie, staggered
at the success of his tactics, yet kept his head and did his utmost
to confuse the retreat, and the triumphant shouts and whistles
of the other Die-Hards showed that they were not unmindful of
this final duty....</p>

<p>The verandah was empty, and he was just about to enter the House,
when through the west door came a figure, breathing hard and bent
apparently on the same errand. Thomas prepared for battle, determined
that no straggler of the enemy should now wrest from him victory,
but, as the figure came into the faint glow at the doorway, he
recognised it as Heritage. And at the same moment he heard something
which made his tense nerves relax. Away on the right came sounds,
a thud of galloping horses on grass and the jingle of bridle reins
and the voices of men. It was the real thing at last. It is a
sad commentary on his career, but now for the first time in his
brief existence Thomas Yownie felt charitably disposed towards
the police.</p>

</div>
<p>The Poet, since we left him blaspheming on the roof of the Tower,
had been having a crowded hour of most inglorious life. He had
started to descend at a furious pace, and his first misadventure
was that he stumbled and dropped Dickson's pistol over the parapet.
He tried to mark where it might have fallen in the gloom below,
and this lost him precious minutes. When he slithered through
the trap into the attic room, where he had tried to hold up the
attack, he discovered that it was full of smoke which sought in
vain to escape by the narrow window. Volumes of it were pouring
up the stairs, and when he attempted to descend he found himself
choked and blinded. He rushed gasping to the window, filled his
lungs with fresh air, and tried again, but he got no further than
the first turn, from which he could see through the cloud red
tongues of flame in the ground room. This was solemn indeed, so
he sought another way out. He got on the roof, for he remembered
a chimney-stack, cloaked with ivy, which was built straight from
the ground, and he thought he might climb down it.</p>

<p>He found the chimney and began the descent, confidently, for
he had once borne a good reputation at the Montanvert and Cortina.
At first all went well, for stones stuck out at decent intervals
like the rungs of a ladder, and roots of ivy supplemented their
deficiencies. But presently he came to a place where the masonry
had crumbled into a cave, and left a gap some twenty feet high.
Below it he could dimly see a thick mass of ivy which would enable
him to cover the further forty feet to the ground, but at that
cave he stuck most finally. All round the lime and stone had lapsed
into debris, and he could find no safe foothold. Worse still,
the block on which he relied proved loose, and only by a dangerous
traverse did he avert disaster.</p>

<p>There he hung for a minute or two, with a cold void in his stomach.
He had always distrusted the handiwork of man as a place to scramble
on, and now he was planted in the dark on a decomposing wall,
with an excellent chance of breaking his neck, and with the most
urgent need for haste. He could see the windows of the House and,
since he was sheltered from the gale, he could hear the faint
sound of blows on woodwork. There was clearly the devil to pay
there, and yet here he was helplessly stuck.... Setting his teeth,
he started to ascend again. Better the fire than this cold breakneck
emptiness.</p>

<p>It took him the better part of half an hour to get back, and
he passed through many moments of acute fear. Footholds which
had seemed secure enough in the descent now proved impossible,
and more than once he had his heart in his mouth when a rotten
ivy stump or a wedge of stone gave in his hands, and dropped dully
into the pit of night, leaving him crazily spread-eagled. When
at last he reached the top he rolled on his back and felt very
sick. Then, as he realised his safety, his impatience revived.
At all costs he would force his way out though he should be grilled
like a herring.</p>

<p>The smoke was less thick in the attic, and with his handkerchief
wet with the rain and bound across his mouth he made a dash for
the ground room. It was as hot as a furnace, for everything inflammable
in it seemed to have caught fire, and the lumber glowed in piles
of hot ashes. But the floor and walls were stone, and only the
blazing jambs of the door stood between him and the outer air.
He had burned himself considerably as he stumbled downwards, and
the pain drove him to a wild leap through the broken arch, where
he miscalculated the distance, charred his shins, and brought
down a red-hot fragment of the lintel on his head. But the thing
was done, and a minute later he was rolling like a dog in the
wet bracken to cool his burns and put out various smouldering
patches on his raiment.</p>

<p>Then he started running for the House, but, confused by the darkness,
he bore too much to the north, and came out in the side avenue
from which he and Dickson had reconnoitred on the first evening.
He saw on the right a glow in the verandah which, as we know,
was the reflection of the flare in the hall, and he heard a babble
of voices. But he heard something more, for away on his left was
the sound which Thomas Yownie was soon to hear&mdash;the trampling
of horses. It was the police at last, and his task was to guide
them at once to the critical point of action.... Three minutes
later a figure like a scarecrow was admonishing a bewildered sergeant,
while his hands plucked feverishly at a horse's bridle.</p>

</div>
<p>It is time to return to Dickson in his clump of rhododendrons.
Tragically aware of his impotence he listened to the tumult of
the Die-Hards, hopeful when it was loud, despairing when there
came a moment's lull, while Mrs. Morran like a Greek chorus drew
loudly upon her store of proverbial philosophy and her memory
of Scripture texts. Twice he tried to reconnoitre towards the
scene of battle, but only blundered into sunken plots and pits
in the Dutch garden. Finally he squatted beside Mrs. Morran, lit
his pipe, and took a firm hold on his patience.</p>

<p>It was not tested for long. Presently he was aware that a change
had come over the scene&mdash;that the Die-Hards' whistles and shouts
were being drowned in another sound, the cries of panicky men.
Dobson's bellow was wafted to him. "Auntie Phemie," he shouted,
"the innkeeper's getting rattled. Dod, I believe they're running."
For at that moment twenty paces on his left the van of the retreat
crashed through the creepers on the garden's edge and leaped the
wall that separated it from the cliffs of the Garplefoot.</p>

<p>The old woman was on her feet.</p>

<p>"God be thankit, is't the polis?"</p>

<p>"Maybe. Maybe no'. But they're running."</p>

<p>Another bunch of men raced past, and he heard Dobson's voice.</p>

<p>"I tell you, they're broke. Listen, it's horses. Ay, it's the
police, but it was the Die-Hards that did the job.... Here! They
mustn't escape. Have the police had the sense to send men to the
Garplefoot?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Morran, a figure like an ancient prophetess, with her tartan
shawl lashing in the gale, clutched him by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Doun to the waterside and stop them. Ye'll no' be beat by wee
laddies! On wi' ye and I'll follow! There's gaun to be a juidgment
on evil-doers this nicht."</p>

<p>Dickson needed no urging. His heart was hot within him, and the
weariness and stiffness had gone from his limbs. He, too, tumbled
over the wall, and made for what he thought was the route by which
he had originally ascended from the stream. As he ran he made
ridiculous efforts to cry like a whaup in the hope of summoning
the Die-Hards. One, indeed, he found &mdash;Napoleon, who had
suffered a grievous pounding in the fountain and had only escaped
by an eel-like agility which had aforetime served him in good
stead with the law of his native city. Lucky for Dickson was the
meeting, for he had forgotten the road and would certainly have
broken his neck. Led by the Die-Hard he slid forty feet over screes
and boiler-plates, with the gale plucking at him, found a path,
lost it, and then tumbled down a raw bank of earth to the flat
ground beside the harbour. During all this performance, he has
told me, he had no thought of fear, nor any clear notion what
he meant to do. He just wanted to be in at the finish of the job.</p>

<p>Through the narrow entrance the gale blew as through a funnel,
and the usually placid waters of the harbour were a mass of angry
waves. Two boats had been launched and were plunging furiously,
and on one of them a lantern dipped and fell. By its light he
could see men holding a further boat by the shore. There was no
sign of the police; he reflected that probably they had become
tangled in the Garple Dean. The third boat was waiting for some
one.</p>

<p>Dickson&mdash;a new Ajax by the ships&mdash;divined who this some one must
be and realised his duty. It was the leader, the arch-enemy, the
man whose escape must at all costs be stopped. Perhaps he had
the Princess with him, thus snatching victory from apparent defeat.
In any case he must be tackled, and a fierce anxiety gripped his
heart. "Aye finish a job," he told himself, and peered up into
the darkness of the cliffs, wondering just how he should set about
it, for except in the last few days he had never engaged in combat
with a fellow-creature.</p>

<p>"When he comes, you grip his legs," he told Napoleon, "and get
him down. He'll have a pistol, and we're done if he's on his feet."</p>

<p>There was a cry from the boats, a shout of guidance, and the
light on the water was waved madly. "They must have good eyesight,"
thought Dickson, for he could see nothing. And then suddenly he
was aware of steps in front of him, and a shape like a man rising
out of the void at his left hand.</p>

<p>In the darkness Napoleon missed his tackle, and the full shock
came on Dickson. He aimed at what he thought was the enemy's throat,
found only an arm and was shaken off as a mastiff might shake
off a toy terrier. He made another clutch, fell, and in falling
caught his opponent's leg so that he brought him down. The man
was immensely agile, for he was up in a second and something hot
and bright blew into Dickson's face. The pistol bullet had passed
through the collar of his faithful waterproof, slightly singeing
his neck. But it served its purpose, for Dickson paused, gasping,
to consider where he had been hit, and before he could resume
the chase the last boat had pushed off into deep water.</p>

<p>To be shot at from close quarters is always irritating, and the
novelty of the experience increased Dickson's natural wrath. He
fumed on the shore like a deerhound when the stag has taken to
the sea. So hot was his blood that he would have cheerfully assaulted
the whole crew had they been within his reach. Napoleon, who had
been incapacitated for speed by having his stomach and bare shanks
savagely trampled upon, joined him, and together they watched
the bobbing black specks as they crawled out of the estuary into
the grey spindrift which marked the harbour mouth.</p>

<p>But as he looked the wrath died out of Dickson's soul. For he
saw that the boats had indeed sailed on a desperate venture, and
that a pursuer was on their track more potent than his breathless
middle-age. The tide was on the ebb, and the gale was driving
the Atlantic breakers shoreward, and in the jaws of the entrance
the two waters met in an unearthly turmoil. Above the noise of
the wind came the roar of the flooded Garple and the fret of the
harbour, and far beyond all the crashing thunder of the conflict
at the harbour mouth. Even in the darkness, against the still
faintly grey western sky, the spume could be seen rising like
waterspouts. But it was the ear rather than the eye which made
certain presage of disaster. No boat could face the challenge
of that loud portal.</p>

<p>As Dickson struggled against the wind and stared, his heart melted
and a great awe fell upon him. He may have wept; it is certain
that he prayed. "Poor souls, poor souls!" he repeated. "I doubt
the last hour or two has been a poor preparation for eternity."</p>

<p>The tide next day brought the dead ashore. Among them was a young
man, different in dress and appearance from the rest&mdash;a young
man with a noble head and a finely-cut classic face, which was
not marred like the others from pounding among the Garple rocks.
His dark hair was washed back from his brow, and the mouth, which
had been hard in life, was now relaxed in the strange innocence
of death.</p>

<p>Dickson gazed at the body and observed that there was a slight
deformation between the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," he said. "That explains a lot.... As my father
used to say, cripples have a right to be cankered."</p>
