<p>I have now a few words to say to the boys. I hope the girls will
also listen, and help to impress the words on their friends.</p>

<p>Most of you have fathers, mothers, and perhaps brothers and sisters.
You love them more than all the world. What would you think if
I should tell you I can make you hate your mother, strike your
father, lie, cheat, steal, do everything vile, and at last send
you, disgraced and despised, to a wretched death?</p>

<p>You are shocked and cannot believe it; but, if you will walk
the path I mark out, you will do just what I have said and reach
the dreadful end—that is, if you live long enough.</p>

<em>SMOKING CREATES A MORBID THIRST</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>The first step is cigarette smoking. It will give you catarrh,
weaken the lungs, cause heart disease, destroy the health, and
create a morbid thirst which will lead you to the second step,—the
drinking of cider, beer, and malt liquors. Soon you will crave
stronger fluids, and will swallow gin, wine, brandy, whiskey,
rum, and all sorts of seductive drinks made from alcohol.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>SMOKING DEGRADES THE TASTES</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>By this time, you will be far along the road to ruin. You will
begin to look upon your father and mother as slow, and will love
the company of the wicked, and hate that of the good. Then will
follow misery, woe, and eternal ruin.</p>

<p>
<em>BAD EFFECTS SHOWN IN TIME</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>You know plenty of boys who smoke cigarettes, and you cannot
see that they suffer any harm on that account. But, as in many
other instances, the harm comes after a time; and often when too
late to be cured. A great many boys die every year from cigarette
smoking, and thousands upon thousands are stricken by disease
from that cause alone.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
<em>QUALITY OF CIGARETTE TOBACCO</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>In 1883, about three quarters of a billion of cigarettes were
smoked in this country, of which more than one half were made
in the city of New York. The tobacco used is the worst that can
be found anywhere. Saltpetre is mixed with it to prevent moulding.
Physicians will tell you that saltpetre, when thus taken into
the system, is very hurtful.</p>

<p>The Havana cigarette is made of fair tobacco, but is rolled in
thick, vile paper and soaked with creosote, which is very hurtful.
But those cigarettes which pretend to be made of Cuban tobacco
are imitations that are as bad as they can be.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>CIGARETTE PAPER</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>The oil of tobacco is highly poisonous; but the oil of the paper
used for cigarette wrappers is worse than that. It burns white,
because of the acids and chemicals in it.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>HURTFUL TO THE YOUNG</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Smoking is specially harmful to the young. It weakens the stomach,
causes indigestion, hastens the action of the heart, thus producing
palpitation.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>PRODUCES CATARRH</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Cigarette smoking is almost certain to produce catarrh, one of
the most offensive and incurable diseases. This arises from the
fact that the cigarette being much shorter than a cigar, the smoke
is inhaled to a greater extent. You have seen boys swallow the
smoke and puff it through the nostrils, thus inviting catarrh.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>CAUSES ASTHMA</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Cigarette smoking tends also to cause asthma.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>OTHER EVIL EFFECTS</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>It renders the system more liable to attacks of pneumonia and
bronchitis. It destroys a healthy appetite for solid food, and
by the constant spitting it causes, excites a craving for drink.
Many instances are known where the nerves of the eye have been
destroyed by cigarette smoking. The following are the words of
Dr. S. H. Keep, one of the leading physicians of Brooklyn:</p>

<p>"If one could select a fine, healthy boy of from twelve to fifteen
years of age, well known for his fine physique, even disposition,
and great strength, and start him in his career as a cigarette
smoker under the observant eye of the public, what results might
not accrue from such example as the panorama was unfolded to them?</p>

<p>"The decay of physical power, emaciation, the irritable temper,
the sallow complexion, the drawn and anxious look, the unsteadiness
of the hands, the dyspepsia, the capricious appetite, the aversion
to parental and other advice, the tendency to seek lower companionship,
could hardly fail to leave its impress upon such an audience.</p>

<p>"More especially in the nervous diathesis[1] does this rapid
decay make itself apparent, and in varying degrees according to
the amount of indulgence. Physicians daily watch this process
with pain and anxiety for those intrusted to their care. Indeed,
if my own professional experience were to be my guide, I could
declare the evil of cigarette smoking to be even greater than
that of alcohol."</p>

<p>Footnote 1:</p>

<p>  Di ath´ e sis—A condition of the body which, predisposes it
to a   particular disease.</p>

<p>So alarming has become this evil that in some States, laws have
been passed against cigarette smoking. But I trust that if any
of you has felt like forming the vile habit, your own good sense
will not allow you to do so.</p>

<p>  What is the first step toward the ruin of the body and soul?
What is   the second step? What follows?</p>

<p>  Where will you be by this time? What then will follow?</p>

<p>  How is it that some boys do not seem to suffer from cigarette  
smoking? What takes place every year?</p>

<p>  How many cigarettes were smoked in this country in 1883? Of
what are   they generally made? What of saltpetre?</p>

<p>  What is said of the genuine Havana cigarette? Are there many
genuine   ones made?</p>

<p>  What of the oil of tobacco? Of the oil of the paper?</p>

<p>  How does smoking affect the young?</p>

<p>  What loathsome disease is almost certain to result from cigarette  
smoking? Why?</p>

<p>  What does cigarette smoking tend to produce? What other effect
has   it on the system? What is its effect on the appetite? How
does it   excite a craving for drink?</p>

<p>  What is said by Dr. Keep, of Brooklyn?</p>

<p>  What has been done by some of the States? What are your own
views on   the vice of cigarette smoking? Are you weak-minded
enough to be   persuaded ever to place a vile cigarette between
your lips? </p>
