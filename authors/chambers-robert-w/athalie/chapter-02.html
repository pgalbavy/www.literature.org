<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Her first memories were of blue skies, green trees, sunshine,
and the odour of warm moist earth.</p>

<p>Always through life she retained this memory of her early consciousness&mdash;a
tree in pink bloom; morning-glories covering a rotting board fence;
deep, rich, sun-warmed soil into which her baby fingers burrowed.</p>

<p>A little later commenced her memory of her mother&mdash;a still, white-shawled
figure sewing under a peach tree in pink bloom.</p>

<p>Vast were her mother's skirts, as Athalie remembered them&mdash;a
wide white tent under which she could creep out of the sunlight
and hide.</p>

<p>Always, too, her earliest memories were crowded with children,
hosts of them in a kaleidoscopic whirl around her, and their voices
seemed ever in her ears.</p>

<p>By the age of four she had gradually understood that this vaguely
pictured host of children numbered only three, and that they were
her brother and two sisters&mdash;very much grown up and desirable
to play with. But at seven she began to be surprised that Doris
and Catharine were no older and no bigger than they were, although
Jack's twelve years still awed her.</p>

<p>It was about this time that the child began to be aware of a
difference between herself and the other children. For a year
or two it did not trouble her, nor even confuse her. She seemed
to be aware of it, that was all.</p>

<p>When it first dawned on her that her mother was aware of it too,
she could never quite remember. Once, very early in her career,
her mother who had been sewing under the peach tree, dropped her
work and looked down at her very steadily where she sat digging
holes in the dirt.</p>

<p>And Athalie had a vague idea in after life that this was the
beginning; because there had been a little boy sitting beside
her all the while she was digging; and, somehow, she was aware
that her mother could not see him.</p>

<p>She was not able to recollect whether her mother had spoken to
her, or even whether she herself had conversed with the little
boy. He never came again; of that she was positive.</p>

<p>When it was that her brother and sisters began to suspect her
of being different she could not remember.</p>

<p>In the beginning she had not understood their half-incredulous
curiosity concerning her; and, ardently communicative by nature,
she was frank with them, confident and undisturbed, until their
child-like and importunate aggressiveness, and the brutal multiplicity
of their questions drove her to reticence and shyness.</p>

<p>For what seemed to amaze them or excite them to unbelief or to
jeers seemed to her ordinary, unremarkable, and not worthy of
any particular notice&mdash;not even of her own.</p>

<p>That she sometimes saw things "around corners," as Jack put it,
had seemed natural enough to her. That, now and then, she seemed
to perceive things which nobody else noticed never disturbed her
even when she became aware that other people were unable to see
them. To her it was as though her own eyesight were normal, and
astigmatism the rule among other people.</p>

<p>But the blunt, merciless curiosity of other children soon taught
Athalie to be on her guard. She learned that embarrassed reserve
which tended toward secretiveness and untruth before she was eleven.</p>

<p>And in school she learned to lie, learned to deny accusations
of being different, pretended that what her sisters accused her
of had been merely "stories" made up to amuse them.</p>

<p>So, in school, she made school-life endurable for herself. Yet,
always, there seemed to be <em>something</em> between her and
other children that made intimacies impossible.</p>

<p>At the same time she was conscious of the admiration of the boys,
of something about herself that they liked outside of her athletic
abilities.</p>

<p>She had a great many friends among the boys; she could out-run,
out-jump, out-swim any of them in the big country school. She
was supple and trim, golden-haired and dark-eyed, and ready for
anything that required enterprise and activity of mind or body.
Her ragged skirts were still short at eleven&mdash;short enough not
to impede her. And she led the chase for pleasure all over that
part of Long Island, running wild with the pack from hill to tide-water
until every farmer in the district knew "the Greensleeve girl."</p>

<p>There was, of course, some deviltry among cherry trees and apple
orchards&mdash;some lawlessness born of sheer exuberance and superb
health&mdash;some malicious trespassing, some harrying of unpopular
neighbours. But not very much, considering.</p>

<p>Her home life was colourless, calm, comfortable, and uneventful
as she regarded it. Business at the Hotel Greensleeve had fallen
off and in reality the children had very little. But children
at that age who live all day in the open, require little except
sympathetic intelligence for their million daily questions.</p>

<p>This the Greensleeve children found wanting except when their
mother did her best to stimulate her own latent intelligence for
their sakes.</p>

<p>But it rested on the foundation of an old-fashioned and limited
education. Only the polite, simpler, and more maidenly arts had
been taught her in the little New Jersey school her father had
kept. And her education ceased when she married Greensleeve, the
ex-"professor" of penmanship, a kind, gentle, unimaginative man,
unusually dull even for a teacher. And he was a failure even at
that.</p>

<p>They began married life by buying the house they were now living
in; and when Greensleeve also failed as a farmer, they opened
the place as a public tavern, and took in Ledlie to finance it.</p>

<p>So it was to her mother that Athalie went for any information
that her ardent and growing intellect required. And her mother,
intuitively surmising the mind-hunger of youth, and its vigorous
needs, did her limited best to satisfy it in her children. And
that is really all the education they had; for what they got in
the country school amounted to&mdash;well it amounted to what anybody
ever gets in school.</p>

<p>Her most enduring, most vivid memories of her mother clustered
around those summer days of her twelfth year, brief lamp-lit scenes
between long, sunlit hours of healthy, youthful madness&mdash;quiet
moments when she came in flushed and panting from the headlong
chase after pleasure, tired, physically satisfied, to sit on the
faded carpet at her mother's feet and clasp her hands over her
mother's knees.</p>

<p>Then "what?" and "why?" and "when?" and "how?" were the burden
of the child's eager speech. Nothing seemed to have escaped her
quick ears or eyes, no natural phenomena of the open; life, birth,
movement, growth, the flow, and ebb of tides, thunder pealing
from high-piled clouds, the sun shining through fragrant falling
rain, mists that grew over swamp and meadow.</p>

<p>And, "Why?" she always asked.</p>

<p>Nothing escaped her;&mdash;swallows skimming and sheering Spring Pond,
trout that jumped at sunset, the quick furry shapes of mink and
muskrat, the rattling flash of a blue-winged kingfisher, a tall
heron wading, a gull mewing.</p>

<p>Nothing escaped her; the casual caress of mating birds, procreation
in farm-yard and barn-yard, fledgelings crying from a robin's
nest of mud and messy refuse, blind kittens tugging at their blinking
mother.</p>

<p>Death, too, she saw,&mdash;a dusty heap of feathers here, a little
mound of fur, there, which the idle breezes stirred under the
high sky,&mdash;and once a dead dog, battered, filthy and bloody, shot
by the roadside; and once some pigs being killed on a farm, all
screaming.</p>

<p>Then, in that school as in every school, there was the sinister
minority, always huddling in corners, full of mean silences and
furtive leering. And their half-heard words, half-understood phrases,&mdash;a
gesture, a look that silenced and perplexed her&mdash;these the child
brought also to her mother, sitting at her feet, face against
her knees.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>For a month or two her mother had not been very well, and the
doctor who had brought Athalie into the world stopped in once
or twice a week. When he was with her mother the children were
forbidden the room.</p>

<p>One evening in particular Athalie remembered. She had been running
her legs off playing hounds-and-hares across country from the
salt-hay stacks to the chestnut ridge, and she had come in after
sunset to find her mother sewing in her own bedroom, her brother
and sisters studying their lessons in the sitting-room where her
father also sat reading the local evening paper.</p>

<p>Supper was over, but Athalie went to the kitchen and presently
returned to her mother's room carrying a bowl of bread and milk
and half a pie.</p>

<p>Here on the faded carpet at her mother's feet, full in the lamplight
she sat her down and ate in hungry silence while her mother sewed.</p>

<p>Athalie seldom studied. A glance at her books seemed to be enough
for her. And she passed examinations without effort under circumstances
where plodders would have courted disaster.</p>

<p>Rare questions from her mother, brief replies marked the meal.
When she had satisfied her hunger she jumped up, ran downstairs
with the empty dishes, and came slowly back again,&mdash;a slender,
supple figure with tangled hair curling below her shoulders, dirty
shirt-waist, soiled features and hands, and the ragged blue skirt
of a sailor suit hanging to her knees.</p>

<p>"Your other sailor suit is washed and mended," said her mother,
smiling at her child in tatters.</p>

<p>Athalie, her gaze remote, nodded absently. After a moment she
lifted her steady dark blue eyes:</p>

<p>"A boy kissed me, mamma," she remarked, dropping cross-legged
at her mother's feet.</p>

<p>"Don't kiss strange boys," said her mother quietly.</p>

<p>"I didn't. But why not?"</p>

<p>"It is not considered proper."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Her mother said: "Kissing is a common and vulgar practice except
in the intimacy of one's own family."</p>

<p>"I thought so," nodded Athalie; "I soaked him for doing it."</p>

<p>"Who was he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it was that fresh Harry Eldon. I told him if he ever tried
to get fresh with me again I'd kill him.... Mamma?"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"All that about poor old Mr. Manners isn't true, is it?"</p>

<p>Her mother smiled. The children had been taught to leave a morsel
on their plates "for manners"; and to impress it upon them their
mother had invented a story about a poor old man named Manners
who depended upon what they left, and who crept in to eat it after
they had retired from table.</p>

<p>So leaving something "for Manners" had been thoroughly and successfully
inculcated, until the habit was formed. And now Athalie was the
last of the children to discover the gentle fraud practised upon
her.</p>

<p>"I'm glad, anyway," concluded the child. "I never thought we
left him enough to eat."</p>

<p>Her mother said: "I shall tell you only truths after this. You
are old enough to understand reason, now, and to reason a little
yourself."</p>

<p>"I do.... But I am not yet perfectly sure where babies come from.
You said you would tell me <em>that</em> some day. I'd really
like to know, mamma."</p>

<p>Her mother continued to sew for a while, then, passing the needle
through the hem she looked down at her daughter.</p>

<p>"Have you formed any opinion of your own?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the child honestly.</p>

<p>"Then I'd better tell you the truth," said her mother tranquilly,
"because the truth is very wonderful and beautiful&mdash;and interesting."</p>

<p>So she related to the child, very simply and clearly all that
need be told concerning the mystery of life in its beginnings;
and Athalie listened, enchanted.</p>

<p>And mostly it thrilled the child to realise that in her, too,
lay latent a capability for the creation of life.</p>

</div>
<p>Another hour with her mother she remembered in after years.</p>

<p>Mrs. Greensleeve had not been as well: the doctor came oftener.
Frequently Athalie returning from school discovered her mother
lying on the bed. That evening the child was sitting on the floor
at her mother's feet as usual, just inside the circle of lamplight,
playing solitaire with an ancient pack of cards.</p>

<p>Presently something near the door attracted her attention and
she lifted her head and sat looking at it, mildly interested,
until, suddenly, she felt her mother's eyes on her, flushed hotly,
and turned her head away.</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> were you looking at?" asked her mother in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"Nothing, mamma."</p>

<p>"Athalie!"</p>

<p>"What, mamma?"</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> were you looking at?"</p>

<p>The child hung her head: "Nothing&mdash;" she began; but her mother
checked her: "Don't lie, Athalie. I'll try to understand you.
Now tell me what you were&mdash;what you thought you were looking at
over there near the door."</p>

<p>The child turned and glanced back at the door over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"There is nothing there&mdash;now," she muttered.</p>

<p>"Was there anything?"</p>

<p>Athalie sat silent for a while, then she laid her clasped hands
across her mother's knees and rested her cheek on them.</p>

<p>"There was a woman there," she said.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Over by the door."</p>

<p>"You saw her, Athalie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma."</p>

<p>"Did she open the door and come in and then close it behind her?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"How did she come in?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. She&mdash;just came in."</p>

<p>"Was she a young woman?"</p>

<p>"No, old."</p>

<p>"Very old?"</p>

<p>"Not very. There was grey in her hair&mdash;a little."</p>

<p>"How was she dressed?"</p>

<p>"She wore a night-gown, mamma. There were spots on it&mdash;like medicine."</p>

<p>"Had you ever seen her before?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"Who was she?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Allen."</p>

<p>Her mother sat very still but her clasped hands tightened and
a little of the colour faded from her cheeks. There was a Mrs.
Allen who had been suffering from an illness which she herself
was afraid she had.</p>

<p>"Do you mean Mrs. James Allen who lives on the old Allen farm?"
she asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma."</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>In the morning they heard of Mrs. Allen's death. And it was several
months before Mrs. Greensleeve again spoke to her daughter on
the one subject about which Athalie was inclined to be most reticent.
But that subject now held a deadly fascination for her mother.</p>

<p>They had been sitting together in Mrs. Greensleeve's bedroom;
the mother knitting, in bed propped up upon the pillows. Athalie,
cross-legged on a hassock beside her, was doing a little mending
on her own account, when her mother said abruptly but very quietly:</p>

<p>"I have always known that you possess a power&mdash;which others cannot
understand."</p>

<p>The child's face flushed deeply and she bent closer over her
mending.</p>

<p>"I knew it when they first brought you to me, a baby just born....
I don't know how I knew it, but I did."</p>

<p>Athalie, sewing steadily, said nothing.</p>

<p>"I think," said her mother, "you are, in some degree, what is
called clairvoyant."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Clairvoyant," repeated her mother quietly. "It comes from the
French, <em>clair</em>, clear; the verb <em>voir</em>, to see;
<em>clair-voyant</em>, seeing clearly. That is all, Athalie....
Nothing to be ashamed of&mdash;if it is true,&mdash;" for the child had
dropped her work and had hidden her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"Dear, are you afraid to talk about it to your mother?"</p>

<p>"N-no. What is there to say about it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing very much. Perhaps the less said the better.... I don't
know, little daughter. I don't understand it&mdash;comprehend it. If
it's so, it's so.... I see you sometimes looking at things I cannot
see; I know sometimes you hear sounds which I cannot hear....
Things happen which perplex the rest of us; and, somehow I seem
to know that they do not perplex you. What to us seems unnatural
to you is natural, even a commonplace matter of course."</p>

<p>"That's it, mamma. I have never seen anything that did not seem
quite natural to me."</p>

<p>"Did you know that Mrs. Allen had died when you&mdash;thought you
saw her?"</p>

<p>"I did see her."</p>

<p>"Yes.... Did you know she had died?"</p>

<p>"Not until I saw her."</p>

<p>"Did you know it then?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how I knew it. I seemed to know it."</p>

<p>"Did you know she had been ill?"</p>

<p>"No, mamma."</p>

<p>"Did it in any way frighten you&mdash;make you uneasy when you saw
her standing there?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," said Athalie, surprised.</p>

<p>"Not even when you knew she was dead?"</p>

<p>"No. Why should it? Why should I be afraid?"</p>

<p>Her mother was silent.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Athalie, curiously. "Is there anything to be afraid
of with God and all his angels watching us? Is there?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then," said the child with some slight impatience, "why is it
that other people seem to be a little afraid of me and of what
they say I can hear and see? I have good eyesight; I see clearly;
that is all, isn't it? And there is nothing to frighten anybody
in seeing clearly, is there?"</p>

<p>"No, dear."</p>

<p>"People make me so cross," continued Athalie,&mdash;"and so ashamed
when they ask so many questions. What is there to be surprised
at if sometimes I see things <em>inside</em> my mind. They are
just as real as when I see them <em>outside</em>. They are no
different."</p>

<p>Her mother nodded, encouragingly.</p>

<p>"When papa was in New York," went on Athalie, "and I saw him
talking to some men in a hotel there, why should it be surprising
just because papa was in New York and I was here when I saw him?"</p>

<p>"It surprises others, dear, because they cannot see what is beyond
the vision of their physical senses."</p>

<p>Athalie said: "They tease me in school because they say I can
see around corners. It makes me very cross and unhappy, and I
don't want anybody to know that I see what they can't see. I'm
ashamed to have them know it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is just as well you feel that way. People are odd.
What they do not understand they ridicule. A dog that would not
notice a horse-drawn vehicle will bark at an automobile."</p>

<p>"Mamma?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"Do you know that dogs, and I think cats, too, see many things
that I do; and that other people do not see."</p>

<p>"Why do you think so?"</p>

<p>"I have noticed it.... The other evening when the white cat was
dozing on your bed, and I was down here on the floor, sewing,
I saw&mdash;something. And the cat looked up suddenly and saw it, too."</p>

<p>"Athalie!"</p>

<p>"She did, mamma. I knew perfectly well that she saw what I saw."</p>

<p>"What was it you saw?"</p>

<p>"Only a young man. He walked over to the window&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, mamma. I don't know where they go. They go, that's
all I know."</p>

<p>"Who was he?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Did he look at us?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... He seemed to be thinking of something pleasant."</p>

<p>"Did he smile?"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;had a pleasant look.... And once,&mdash;it was last Sunday&mdash;over
by the bed I saw a little boy. He was kneeling down beside the
bed. And Mr. Ledlie's dog was lying here beside me.... Don't you
remember how he suddenly lifted his head and barked?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember. But you didn't tell me why at the time."</p>

<p>"I didn't like to.... I never like to speak about these&mdash;people
&mdash;I see."</p>

<p>"Had you ever before seen the little boy?"</p>

<p>"No, mamma."</p>

<p>"Was he&mdash;alive&mdash;do you think?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. They all are alive."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Allen was not alive when you saw her over by the door."</p>

<p>The child looked puzzled. "Yes," she said, "but that was a little
different. Not <em>very</em> different. They are all perfectly
alive, mamma."</p>

<p>"Even the ones we call dead? Are you sure of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... Yes, I'm sure of it. They are not dead.... Nothing seems
to die. Nothing stays dead."</p>

<p>"What! Why do you believe that?"</p>

<p>Athalie said slowly: "Somebody shot and killed a poor little
dog, once,&mdash;just across the causeway bridge.... And the dog came
into the garden afterward and ran all around, smelling, and wagging
his tail."</p>

<p>"Athalie! Athalie! Be careful to control your imagination."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the child, thoughtfully, "I must be careful to control
it. I can imagine almost anything if I try."</p>

<p>"How hard have you ever tried to imagine some of the things you
see&mdash;or think you see?"</p>

<p>"Mamma, I never try. I &mdash;I don't care to see them. I'd rather
not. Those things come. <em>I</em> haven't anything to do with
it. I don't know these people, and I am not interested. I <em>did</em>
try to see papa in New York&mdash;if you call that imagination."</p>

<p>But her mother did not know what to call it because at the hour
when Athalie had seen him, that mild and utterly unimaginative
man was actually saying and doing what his daughter had seen and
heard.</p>

<p>"Also," said Athalie, "I <em>was</em> thinking about that poor
little yellow dog and wondering whether he was past all suffering,
when he came gaily trotting into the garden, waving his tail quite
happily. There was no dust or blood on him. He rolled on the grass,
too, and barked and barked. But nobody seemed to hear him or notice
him excepting I."</p>

<p>For a long while silence reigned in the lamp-lit room. When the
other children came in to say good night to their mother she received
them with an unusual tenderness. They went away; Athalie rose,
yawning the yawn of healthy fatigue:</p>

<p>"Good night, mamma."</p>

<p>"Good night, little daughter."</p>

<p>They kissed: the mother drew her into a sudden and almost convulsive
embrace.</p>

<p>"Darling, are you sure that nothing really dies?"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> have never seen anything really dead, mamma. Even
the 'dead' birds,&mdash;why, the evening sky is full of them&mdash;the little
'dead' ones I mean&mdash;flock after flock, twittering and singing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear!"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma."</p>

<p>"When you see me&mdash;<em>that</em> way&mdash;will you&mdash;speak?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Promise, darling."</p>

<p>"Yes.... I'll kiss you, too&mdash;if it is possible...."</p>

<p>"Would it be possible?"</p>

<p>The child gazed at her, perplexed and troubled: "<em>I&mdash;</em>don't&mdash;know,"
she said slowly. Then, all in a moment her childish face paled
and she clung to her mother and began to cry.</p>

<p>And her mother soothed her, tenderly, smilingly, kissing the
tears from the child's eyes.</p>

<p>The next morning after the children had gone to school Mrs. Greensleeve
was operated on&mdash;without success.</p>
