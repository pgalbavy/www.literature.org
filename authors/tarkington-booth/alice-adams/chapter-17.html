<p>He was out in his taxicab again the next morning, and by noon
he had secured what he wanted.</p>

<p>It was curiously significant that he worked so quickly. All the
years during which his wife had pressed him toward his present
shift he had sworn to himself, as well as to her, that he would
never yield; and yet when he did yield he had no plans to make,
because he found them already prepared and worked out in detail
in his mind; as if he had long contemplated the "step" he believed
himself incapable of taking.</p>

<p>Sometimes he had thought of improving his income by exchanging
his little collection of bonds for a "small rental property,"
if he could find "a good buy"; and he had spent many of his spare
hours rambling over the enormously spreading city and its purlieus,
looking for the ideal "buy." It remained unattainable, so far
as he was concerned; but he found other things.</p>

<p>Not twice a crow's mile from his own house there was a dismal
and slummish quarter, a decayed "industrial district" of earlier
days. Most of the industries were small; some of them died, perishing
of bankruptcy or fire; and a few had moved, leaving their shells.
Of the relics, the best was a brick building which had been the
largest and most important factory in the quarter: it had been
injured by a long vacancy almost as serious as a fire, in effect,
and Adams had often guessed at the sum needed to put it in repair.</p>

<p>When he passed it, he would look at it with an interest which
he supposed detached and idly speculative. "That'd be just the
thing," he thought. "If a fellow had money enough, and took a
notion to set up some new business on a big scale, this would
be a pretty good place&mdash;to make glue, for instance, if that wasn't
out of the question, of course. It would take a lot of money,
though; a great deal too much for me to expect to handle&mdash;even
if I'd ever dream of doing such a thing."</p>

<p>Opposite the dismantled factory was a muddy, open lot of two
acres or so, and near the middle of the lot, a long brick shed
stood in a desolate abandonment, not happily decorated by old
coatings of theatrical and medicinal advertisements. But the brick
shed had two wooden ells, and, though both shed and ells were
of a single story, here was empty space enough for a modest enterprise&mdash;"space
enough for almost anything, to start with," Adams thought, as
he walked through the low buildings, one day, when he was prospecting
in that section. "Yes, I suppose I <em>COULD </em>swing this,"
he thought. "If the process belonged to me, say, instead of being
out of the question because it isn't my property&mdash;or if I was
the kind of man to do such a thing anyhow, here would be something
I could probably get hold of pretty cheap. They'd want a lot of
money for a lease on that big building over the way&mdash;but this,
why, I should think it'd be practically nothing at all."</p>

<p>Then, by chance, meeting an agent he knew, he made inquiries&mdash;merely
to satisfy a casual curiosity, he thought&mdash;and he found matters
much as he had supposed, except that the owners of the big building
did not wish to let, but to sell it, and this at a price so exorbitant
that Adams laughed. But the long brick shed in the great muddy
lot was for sale or to let, or "pretty near to be given away,"
he learned, if anybody would take it.</p>

<p>Adams took it now, though without seeing that he had been destined
to take it, and that some dreary wizard in the back of his head
had foreseen all along that he would take it, and planned to be
ready. He drove in his taxicab to look the place over again, then
down-town to arrange for a lease; and came home to lunch with
his wife and daughter. Things were "moving," he told them.</p>

<p>He boasted a little of having acted so decisively, and said that
since the dang thing had to be done, it was "going to be done
<em>RIGHT!" </em>He was almost cheerful, in a feverish way, and
when the cab came for him again, soon after lunch, he explained
that he intended not only to get things done right, but also to
"get 'em done quick!" Alice, following him to the front door,
looked at him anxiously and asked if she couldn't help. He laughed
at her grimly.</p>

<p>"Then let me go along with you in the cab," she begged. "You
don't look able to start in so hard, papa, just when you're barely
beginning to get your strength back. Do let me go with you and
see if I can't help&mdash;or at least take care of you if you should
get to feeling badly."</p>

<p>He declined, but upon pressure let her put a tiny bottle of spirits
of ammonia in his pocket, and promised to make use of it if he
"felt faint or anything." Then he was off again; and the next
morning had men at work in his sheds, though the wages he had
to pay frightened him.</p>

<p>He directed the workmen in every detail, hurrying them by example
and exhortations, and receiving, in consequence, several declarations
of independence, as well as one resignation, which took effect
immediately. "Yous capitalusts seem to think a man's got nothin'
to do but break his back p'doosin' wealth fer yous to squander,"
the resigning person loudly complained. "You look out: the toiler's
day is a-comin', and it ain't so fur off, neither!" But the capitalist
was already out of hearing, gone to find a man to take this orator's
place.</p>

<p>By the end of the week, Adams felt that he had moved satisfactorily
forward in his preparations for the simple equipment he needed;
but he hated the pause of Sunday. He didn't <em>WANT </em>any
rest, he told Alice impatiently, when she suggested that the idle
day might be good for him.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon he walked over to the apartment house where
old Charley Lohr lived, and gave his friend the letter he wanted
the head of Lamb and Company to receive "personally." "I'll take
it as a mighty great favour in you to hand it to him personally,
Charley," he said, in parting. "And you won't forget, in case
he says anything about it&mdash;and remember if you ever do get a chance
to put in a good word for me later, you know&#11834;"</p>

<p>Old Charley promised to remember, and, when Mrs. Lohr came out
of the "kitchenette," after the door closed, he said thoughtfully,
"Just skin and bones."</p>

<p>"You mean Mr. Adams is?" Mrs. Lohr inquired.</p>

<p>"Who'd you think I meant?" he returned. "One o' these partridges
in the wall-paper?"</p>

<p>"Did he look so badly?"</p>

<p>"Looked kind of distracted to me," her husband replied. "These
little thin fellers can stand a heap sometimes, though. He'll
be over here again Monday."</p>

<p>"Did he say he would?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lohr. "But he will. You'll see. He'll be over to find
out what the big boss says when I give him this letter. Expect
I'd be kind of anxious, myself, if I was him."</p>

<p>"Why would you? What's Mr. Adams doing to be so anxious about?"</p>

<p>Lohr's expression became one of reserve, the look of a man who
has found that when he speaks his inner thoughts his wife jumps
too far to conclusions. "Oh, nothing," he said. "Of course any
man starting up a new business is bound to be pretty nervous a
while. He'll be over here to-morrow evening, all right; you'll
see."</p>

<p>The prediction was fulfilled: Adams arrived just after Mrs. Lohr
had removed the dinner dishes to her "kitchenette"; but Lohr had
little information to give his caller.</p>

<p>"He didn't say a word, Virgil; nary a word. I took it into his
office and handed it to him, and he just sat and read it; that's
all. I kind of stood around as long as I could, but he was sittin'
at his desk with his side to me, and he never turned around full
toward me, as it were, so I couldn't hardly even tell anything.
All I know: he just read it."</p>

<p>"Well, but see here," Adams began, nervously. "Well&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well what, Virg?"</p>

<p>"Well, but what did he say when he <em>DID </em>speak?"</p>

<p>"He didn't speak. Not so long I was in there, anyhow. He just
sat there and read it. Read kind of slow. Then, when he came to
the end, he turned back and started to read it all over again.
By that time there was three or four other men standin' around
in the office waitin' to speak to him, and I had to go."</p>

<p>Adams sighed, and stared at the floor, irresolute. "Well, I'll
be getting along back home then, I guess, Charley. So you're sure
you couldn't tell anything what he might have thought about it,
then?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing in the world. I've told you all I know, Virg."</p>

<p>"I guess so, I guess so," Adams said, mournfully. "I feel mighty
obliged to you, Charley Lohr; mighty obliged. Good-night to you."
And he departed, sighing in perplexity.</p>

<p>On his way home, preoccupied with many thoughts, he walked so
slowly that once or twice he stopped and stood motionless for
a few moments, without being aware of it; and when he reached
the juncture of the sidewalk with the short brick path that led
to his own front door, he stopped again, and stood for more than
a minute. "Ah, I wish I knew," he whispered, plaintively. "I do
wish I knew what he thought about it."</p>

<p>He was roused by a laugh that came lightly from the little veranda
near by. "Papa!" Alice called gaily. "What are you standing there
muttering to yourself about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, are you there, dearie?" he said, and came up the path. A
tall figure rose from a chair on the veranda.</p>

<p>"Papa, this is Mr. Russell."</p>

<p>The two men shook hands, Adams saying, "Pleased to make your
acquaintance," as they looked at each other in the faint light
diffused through the opaque glass in the upper part of the door.
Adams's impression was of a strong and tall young man, fashionable
but gentle; and Russell's was of a dried, little old business
man with a grizzled moustache, worried bright eyes, shapeless
dark clothes, and a homely manner.</p>

<p>"Nice evening," Adams said further, as their hands parted. "Nice
time o' year it is, but we don't always have as good weather as
this; that's the trouble of it. Well&#11834;" He went to the door.
"Well &mdash;I bid you good evening," he said, and retired within
the house.</p>

<p>Alice laughed. "He's the old-fashionedest man in town, I suppose
and frightfully impressed with you, I could see!"</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" said Russell. "How could anybody be impressed
with me?"</p>

<p>"Why not? Because you're quiet? Good gracious! Don't you know
that you're the most impressive sort? We chatterers spend all
our time playing to you quiet people."</p>

<p>"Yes; we're only the audience."</p>

<p>"'Only!'" she echoed. "Why, we live for you, and we can't live
without you."</p>

<p>"I wish you couldn't," said Russell. "That would be a new experience
for both of us, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"It might be a rather bleak one for me," she answered, lightly.
"I'm afraid I'll miss these summer evenings with you when they're
over. I'll miss them enough, thanks!"</p>

<p>"Do they have to be over some time?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, everything's over some time, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Russell laughed at her. "Don't let's look so far ahead as that,"
he said. "We don't need to be already thinking of the cemetery,
do we?"</p>

<p>"I didn't," she said, shaking her head. "Our summer evenings
will be over before then, Mr. Russell."</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" she said. "<em>THERE'S </em>laconic eloquence:
almost a proposal in a single word! Never mind, I shan't hold
you to it. But to answer you: well, I'm always looking ahead,
and somehow I usually see about how things are coming out."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I suppose most of us do; at least it seems as
if we did, because we so seldom feel surprised by the way they
do come out. But maybe that's only because life isn't like a play
in a theatre, and most things come about so gradually we get used
to them."</p>

<p>"No, I'm sure I can see quite a long way ahead," she insisted,
gravely. "And it doesn't seem to me as if our summer evenings
could last very long. Something'll interfere&mdash;somebody will, I
mean&mdash;they'll <em>SAY </em>something&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What if they do?"</p>

<p>She moved her shoulders in a little apprehensive shiver. "It'll
change you," she said. "I'm just sure something spiteful's going
to happen to me. You'll feel differently about&mdash;things."</p>

<p>"Now, isn't that an idea!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It will," she insisted. "I know something spiteful's going to
happen!"</p>

<p>"You seem possessed by a notion not a bit flattering to me,"
he remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh, but isn't it? That's just what it is! Why isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Because it implies that I'm made of such soft material the slightest
breeze will mess me all up. I'm not so like that as I evidently
appear; and if it's true that we're afraid other people will do
the things we'd be most likely to do ourselves, it seems to me
that I ought to be the one to be afraid. I ought to be afraid
that somebody may say something about me to you that will make
you believe I'm a professional forger."</p>

<p>"No. We both know they won't," she said. "We both know you're
the sort of person everybody in the world says nice things about."
She lifted her hand to silence him as he laughed at this. "Oh,
of course you are! I think perhaps you're a little flirtatious&mdash;most
quiet men have that one sly way with 'em&mdash;oh, yes, they do! But
you happen to be the kind of man everybody loves to praise. And
if you weren't, <em>I</em> shouldn't hear anything terrible about
you. I told you I was unpopular: I don't see anybody at all any
more. The only man except you who's been to see me in a month
is that fearful little fat Frank Dowling, and I sent word to <em>HIM
I </em>wasn't home. Nobody'd tell me of your wickedness, you see."</p>

<p>"Then let me break some news to you," Russell said. "Nobody would
tell me of yours, either. Nobody's even mentioned you to me."</p>

<p>She burlesqued a cry of anguish. "That IS obscurity! I suppose
I'm too apt to forget that they say the population's about half
a million nowadays. There <em>ARE </em>other people to talk about,
you feel, then?"</p>

<p>"None that I want to," he said. "But I should think the size
of the place might relieve your mind of what seems to insist on
burdening it. Besides, I'd rather you thought me a better man
than you do."</p>

<p>"What kind of a man do I think you are?"</p>

<p>"The kind affected by what's said about people instead of by
what they do themselves."</p>

<p>"Aren't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," he said. "If you want our summer evenings to be
over you'll have to drive me away yourself."</p>

<p>"Nobody else could?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>She was silent, leaning forward, with her elbows on her knees
and her clasped hands against her lips. Then, not moving, she
said softly:</p>

<p>"Well &mdash;I won't!"</p>

<p>She was silent again, and he said nothing, but looked at her,
seeming to be content with looking. Her attitude was one only
a graceful person should assume, but she was graceful; and, in
the wan light, which made a prettily shaped mist of her, she had
beauty. Perhaps it was beauty of the hour, and of the love scene
almost made into form by what they had both just said, but she
had it; and though beauty of the hour passes, he who sees it will
long remember it and the hour when it came.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of?" he asked.</p>

<p>She leaned back in her chair and did not answer at once. Then
she said:</p>

<p>"I don't know; I doubt if I was thinking of anything. It seems
to me I wasn't. I think I was just being sort of sadly happy just
then."</p>

<p>"Were you? Was it 'sadly,' too?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" she said. "It seems to me that only little
children can be just happily happy. I think when we get older
our happiest moments are like the one I had just then: it's as
if we heard strains of minor music running through them&mdash;oh, so
sweet, but oh, so sad!"</p>

<p>"But what makes it sad for <em>YOU</em>?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, in a lighter tone. "Perhaps it's a
kind of useless foreboding I seem to have pretty often. It may
be that&mdash;or it may be poor papa."</p>

<p>"You <em>ARE </em>a funny, delightful girl, though!" Russell
laughed. "When your father's so well again that he goes out walking
in the evenings!"</p>

<p>"He does too much walking," Alice said. "Too much altogether,
over at his new plant. But there isn't any stopping him." She
laughed and shook her head. "When a man gets an ambition to be
a multi-millionaire his family don't appear to have much weight
with him. He'll walk all he wants to, in spite of them."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," Russell said, absently; then he leaned forward.
"I wish I could understand better why you were 'sadly' happy."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as Alice shed what further light she could on this
point, the man ambitious to be a "multi-millionaire" was indeed
walking too much for his own good. He had gone to bed, hoping
to sleep well and rise early for a long day's work, but he could
not rest, and now, in his nightgown and slippers, he was pacing
the floor of his room.</p>

<p>"I wish I <em>DID </em>know," he thought, over and over. "I DO
wish I knew how he feels about it."</p>
