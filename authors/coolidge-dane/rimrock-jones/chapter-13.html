<p>The morning after found Rimrock without regrets and, for once, without
a head.  He had subtly judged, from something she had said, that Mary
did not like whiskey breaths, nor strong cigars, nor the odors of the
two combined.  So, having certain words to speak in her ear, he had
refrained, with the results as aforesaid.  For the first time in her
life she had looked him in the eye and acknowledged, frankly, that she
liked him.  But she had not kissed him--she drew the line there--and
once more in his shrewd unsophisticated way he judged it was never
done, in her set.
</p><p>He found her in the office when he appeared the next morning, with her
harness over her head.  It was the sign in a way that she was strictly
business and all personal confidences were taboo, but Rimrock did not
take the hint.  It annoyed him, some way, that drum over her ear and
the transmitter hung on her breast, for when he had seen her the
evening before all these things had been set aside.
</p><p>"What?  Still wearing that ear-thing?" he demanded bluffly and she
flushed and drew her lips tight.  It was a way she had when she
restrained some quick answer and Rimrock hastened on to explain.  "You
never wore it last night and--and you could hear every word I said."
</p><p>"That was because I knew what you were going to say."
</p><p>She smiled, imperceptibly, as she returned the retort courteous and now
it was Rimrock who blushed.  Then he laughed and waved the matter aside.
</p><p>"Well, let it go at that," he said sitting down.  "Gimme the books, I'm
going to make you a director at our next meeting."
</p><p>Mary Fortune looked at him curiously and smiled once more, then rose
quickly and went to the safe.
</p><p>"Very well," she said as she came back with the records, "but I wonder
if you quite understand."
</p><p>"You bet I do," he said, laying off his big hat and spreading out the
papers and books.  "Don't fool yourself there--we've got to be
friends--and that's why I'm going the limit."
</p><p>He searched out the certificate where, to qualify him for director, he
had transferred one share of the Company stock to Buckbee, and filled
in a date on the back.
</p><p>"Now," he went on, "Mr. Buckbee's stock is cancelled, and his
resignation automatically takes place.  Friend Buckbee is all right,
but dear friend W. H. Stoddard might use him to slip something over.
It's We, Us and Company, you and me, little Mary, against Whitney H.
Stoddard and the world.  Do you get the idea?  We stand solid
together--two directors out of three--and the Tecolote is in the hollow
of our hand."
</p><p>"Your hand!" she corrected but Rimrock protested and she let him have
his way.
</p><p>"No, now listen," he said; "this doesn't bind you to anything--all I
want is that we shall be friends."
</p><p>"And do you understand," she challenged, "that I can vote against you
and throw the control to Stoddard?  Have you stopped to think that I
may have ideas that are diametrically opposed to your own?  Have you
even considered that we might fall out--as we did once before, you
remember--and that then I could use this against you?"
</p><p>"I understand all that--and more besides," he said as he met her eyes.
"I want you, Mary.  My God, I'm crazy for you.  The whole mine is
nothing to me now."
</p><p>"Oh, yes, it is," she said, but her voice trailed off and she thought
for a minute in silence.
</p><p>"Very well," she said, "you have a right to your own way--but remember,
this still leaves me free."
</p><p>"You know it!" he exclaimed, "as the desert wind!  Shake hands on
it--we're going to be friends!"
</p><p>"I hope so," she said, "but sometimes I'm afraid.  We must wait a while
and be sure."
</p><p>"Ah, 'wait'!" he scolded.  "But I don't like that word--but come on,
let's get down to business.  Where's this Abercrombie Jepson?  I want
to talk to him, and then we'll go out to the mine."
</p><p>He grabbed up his hat and began to stride about the office, running his
hand lovingly over the polished mahogany furniture, and Mary Fortune
spoke a few words into the phone.
</p><p>"He'll be here in a minute," she said and began to straighten out the
papers on her desk.  Even to Rimrock Jones, who was far from
systematic, it was evident that she knew her work.  Every paper was put
back in its special envelope, and when Abercrombie Jepson came in from
his office she had the bundle back in the safe.
</p><p>He was a large man, rather fat and with a ready smile, but with a
harried look in his eye that came from handling a thousand details; and
as Rimrock turned and faced him he blinked, for he felt something was
coming.
</p><p>"Mr. Jepson," began Rimrock in his big, blustering voice, "I want to
have an understanding with you.  You're a Stoddard man, but I think
you're competent--you certainly have put things through.  But here's
the point--I've taken charge now and you get your orders from me.  You
can forget Mr. Stoddard.  I'm president and general manager, and
whatever I say goes."
</p><p>He paused and looked Jepson over very carefully while Mary Fortune
stared.
</p><p>"Very well, sir," answered Jepson, "I think I understand you.  I hope
you are satisfied with my services?"
</p><p>"We'll see about that later," went on Rimrock, still arrogantly.  "I'll
begin my tour of inspection to-day.  But I'll tell you right now, so
there won't be any mistake, that all I ask of you is results.  You
won't find me kicking about the money you spend as long as it comes
back in ore.  You're a competent man, so I've been given to understand,
and, inside your field, you're the boss.  I won't fire any of your men
and I won't interfere with your work without having it done through
you; but on the other hand, don't you forget for a single minute that
I'm the big boss on this dump.  And whatever you do, don't make the
mistake of thinking you're working for Stoddard.  I guess that will be
all.  Miss Fortune is going to be a director soon and I've asked her to
go out with us to the mine."
</p><p>A strange, startled look came over Jepson's face as he received this
last bit of news, but he smiled and murmured his congratulations.  Then
he expressed the hope that he would be able to please them and withdrew
with the greatest haste.
</p><p>"Well!" observed Rimrock as he gazed grimly after him, "I guess that
will hold Mr. Jepson."
</p><p>"Very likely," returned Mary, "but as a prospective director may I
enquire the reason for this outburst?"
</p><p>"You may," replied Rimrock.  "This man, Abercrombie Jepson, was put
over on me by Stoddard.  I had to concede something, after holding out
on the control, and I agreed he could name the supe.  Well now, after
being the whole show, don't you think it more than likely that Mr.
Jepson might overlook the main squeeze--me?"
</p><p>He tapped himself on the breast and nodded his head significantly.
</p><p>"That's it," he went on as she smiled enigmatically.  "I know these
great financiers.  I'll bet you right now our fat friend Abercrombie is
down telegraphing the news to Stoddard.  He's Stoddard's man but I've
got my eye on him and if he makes a crooked move, it's bingo!"
</p><p>"All the same," defended Mary, "while I don't like him personally, I
think Jepson is remarkably efficient.  And when you consider his years
of experience and the technical knowledge he has----"
</p><p>"That has nothing to do with it, as far as I'm concerned--there are
other men just as good for the price--but I want him to understand so
he won't forget it that he's taking his orders from <u>me</u>.  Now I happen
to know that our dear friend Stoddard is out to get control of this
mine and the very man that is liable to ditch us is this same efficient
Mr. Jepson.  Don't ever make the mistake of giving these financiers the
credit of being on the level.  You can't grab that much money in the
short time they've been gathering without gouging every man you meet.
So just watch this man Jepson.  Keep your eye on his accounts, and
remember--we're pardners, now."
</p><p>His big, excited eyes, that blazed with primitive emotion whenever he
roused from his calm, became suddenly gentle and he patted her hand as
he hurried off to order up the car.
</p><p>All the way across the desert, as Mary exclaimed at the signs of
progress, Rimrock let it pass in silence.  They left the end of the
railroad and a short automobile ride put them down at the Tecolote
camp.  Along the edge of the canyon, where the well-borers had
developed water, the framework of a gigantic mill and concentrator was
rapidly being rushed to completion.  On the flats below, where Old
Juan's burros had browsed on the scanty mesquite, were long lines of
houses for the miners and a power plant to run the great stamps.  A big
gang of miners were running cuts into the hillside where the first of
the ore was to come out and like a stream of ants the workmen and teams
swarmed about each mighty task, but still Rimrock Jones remained
silent.  His eyes opened wider at sight of each new miracle but to
Jepson he made no comments.
</p><p>They went to the assay house, where the diamond drill cores showed the
ore from the heart of the hills; and there at last Rimrock found his
tongue as he ran over the assayer's reports.
</p><p>"Pretty good," he observed and this time it was Jepson who tightened
his lips and said nothing.  "Pretty good," repeated Rimrock and then he
laughed silently and went out and sat down on the hill.  "A mountain of
copper," he said, looking upward.  "The whole butte is nothing but ore.
Some rich, some low-grade, but shattered--that's the idea!  You can
scoop it up with a steam shovel."
</p><p>He whistled through his teeth, cocking his eye up at the mountain and
then looking down at the townsite.
</p><p>"You bet--a big camp!"  And then to Jepson: "That's fine, Mr. Jepson;
you're doing noble.  By the way, when will that cook-house be done?
Pretty soon, eh?  Well, let me know; I've got a friend that's crazy to
move in."
</p><p>He smiled at Mary, who thought at once of Woo Chong, but Jepson looked
suddenly serious.
</p><p>"I hope, Mr. Jones," he said, "you're not planning to bring in that
Chinaman.  I've got lots of Bisbee men among my miners and they won't
stand for a Chinaman in camp."
</p><p>"Oh, yes, they will," answered Rimrock easily.  "You wait, it'll be all
right.  And there's another thing, now I think about it; Mr. Hicks will
be out soon to look for a good place to locate his saloon.  I've given
him the privilege of selling all the booze that is sold in Tecolote."
</p><p>"Booze?" questioned Jepson, and then he fell silent and went to gnawing
his lip.
</p><p>"Yes--booze!" repeated Rimrock.  "I know these Cousin Jacks.  They've
got to have facilities for spending their money or they'll quit you and
go to town."
</p><p>"Well, now really, Mr. Jones," began Jepson earnestly, "I'd much prefer
to have a dry camp.  Of course you are right about the average
miner--but it's better not to have them drunk around camp."
</p><p>"Very likely," said Rimrock, "but Old Hassayamp is coming and I guess
you can worry along.  It's a matter of friendship with me, Mr.
Jepson--I never go back on a friend.  When I was down and out Old
Hassayamp Hicks was the only man that would trust me for the drinks;
and Woo Chong, the Chinaman, was the only man that would trust me for a
meal.  You see how it is, and I hope you'll do your best to make them
both perfectly at home."
</p><p>Abercrombie Jepson mumbled something into his mustache which Rimrock
let pass for assent, although it was plainly to be seen by the fire in
his eye that the superintendent was vexed.  As for Mary Fortune, she
sat at one side and pretended not to hear.  Perhaps Rimrock was right
and these first minor clashes were but skirmishes before a great
battle.  Perhaps, after all, Jepson was there to oppose him and it was
best to ride over him roughshod.  But it seemed on the surface
extremely dictatorial, and against public policy as well.  Mr. Jepson
was certainly right, in her opinion, in his attitude toward Hicks'
saloon; yet she knew it was hopeless to try to move Rimrock, so she
smiled and let them talk on.
</p><p>"Now, there's another matter," broke in Jepson aggressively, "that I've
been waiting to see you about.  As I understand it, I'm Mr. Stoddard's
representative--I represent his interests in the mine.  Very good;
that's no more than right.  Now, Mr. Stoddard has invested a large
amount of money to develop these twenty claims, but he feels, and I
feel, that that Old Juan claim is a continual menace to them all."
</p><p>At the mention of the Old Juan Rimrock turned his head, and Mary could
see his jaw set; but he listened somberly for some little time as
Jepson went on with his complaint.
</p><p>"You must know, Mr. Jones, that the history of the Old Juan makes it
extremely liable to be jumped.  We've had a strong guard set ever since
you--well, continuously--but the title to that claim must be cleared
up.  It ought to be re-located----"
</p><p>"Don't you think it!" sneered Rimrock with a sudden insulting stare.
"That claim will stay--just the way it is!"
</p><p>"But the guards!" protested Jepson, "they're a continual expense----"
</p><p>"You can tell 'em to come down," cut in Rimrock peremptorily.  "I'll
look after that claim myself."
</p><p>"But why not re-locate it?" cried Jepson in a passion, "why expose us
to this continual suspense?  You can re-locate it yourself----"
</p><p>"Mr. Jepson," began Rimrock, speaking through his teeth, "there's no
one that questions my claim.  But if any man does--I don't care who he
is--he's welcome to try and jump it.  All he'll have to do is whip me."
</p><p>He was winking angrily and Jepson, after a silence, cast an appealing
glance at Mary Fortune.
</p><p>"You've got a wonderful property here," he observed, speaking
generally, "the prospects are very bright.  There's only one thing that
can mar its success, and that is litigation!"
</p><p>"Yes," cried Rimrock, "and that's just what you'd bring on by your
crazy re-location scheme!  That Old Juan claim is good--I killed a man
to prove it--and I'm not going to back down on it now.  It won't be
re-located and the man that jumps it will have me to deal with,
personally.  Now if you don't like the way I'm running this
proposition----"
</p><p>"Oh, it isn't that!" broke in Jepson hastily, "but I'm hired, in a way,
to advise.  You must know, Mr. Jones, that you're jeopardizing our
future by refusing to re-locate that claim."
</p><p>"No, I don't!" shouted Rimrock, jumping fiercely to his feet, while
Mary Fortune turned pale.  "It's just the other way.  That claim is
good--I know it's good--and I'll fight for it every time.  Your courts
are nothing, you can hire a lawyer to take any side of any case, but
you can't hire one to go up against this!"  He patted a lump that
bulged at his hip and shook a clenched fist in the air.  "No, sir!  No
law for me!  Don't you ever think that I'll stand for re-locating that
claim.  That would be just the chance that these law-sharps are looking
for, to start a contest and tie up the mine.  No, leave it to me.  I'll
be my own law and, believe me, I'll never be jumped.  There are some
people yet that remember Andrew McBain----"
</p><p>He stopped, for Mary had risen from her place and stood facing him with
blazing eyes.
</p><p>"What's the matter?" he asked, like a man bewildered; and then he
understood.  Mary Fortune had worked for Andrew McBain, she had heard
him threaten his life; and, since his acquittal, this was the first
time his name had been mentioned.  And he remembered with a start that
after he came back from the killing she had refused to take his hand.
</p><p>"What's the matter?" he repeated, but she set her lips and moved away
down the hill.  Rimrock stood and watched her, then he turned to Jepson
and his voice was hoarse with hate.
</p><p>"Well, I hope you're satisfied!" he said and strode savagely off down
the trail.
