<p>Life on board the schooner <em>Coral</em>, bound for the South
Seas, now became like one delightful dream.</p>

<p>The sails, fanned by the steady trade-wind, hardly ever required
attention, since the course of the craft never varied more than
a few points for days at a time, and whoever it was at the wheel,
he might as well have lashed it fast and gone to sleep, for all
the necessity there was of keeping awake.</p>

<p>There had been some elemental disturbances which required seamanship
to weather, but nothing like that usually encountered in the Atlantic.
But there came a long spell of weather, faultless in every respect,
and whose only drawback was the dread that each day would be the
last of such delight. The sun rose clear and bright, and at high
noon, as they approached the equator, it was sometimes hot, but
the breeze which continually swept the deck tempered it to the
crew and passenger. Had they been caught in a calm the heat would
have been suffocating; but Providence favored them, and they sped
along like a seagull toward their destination. There seemed to
be times when the green surface of the sea was at perfect rest;
but the regular rising and sinking of the <em>Coral</em> showed
that the bosom of the great deep was heaving as it always does,
though the long swells came only at extended intervals.</p>

<p>The water was of crystalline clearness, and, looking over the
gunwale, one could see far into the depths, where strange-looking
fish were sporting, sometimes coming to the surface and then shooting
far down beyond the reach of human vision. Now and then, too,
as little Inez leaned over the side of the vessel and peered downward,
she caught sight of something like a shadow, gliding hither and
thither, apparently without the slightest effort to keep pace
with the schooner, which was bowling along at a rapid rate. It
was one of those monstrous sharks, that will snap a man in two
as quickly as if he were but an apple, should he fall overboard.</p>

<p>Not a day passed without descrying one or more sails at varying
distances, but our friends did not hail or approach any. Both
Captain Bergen and Mate Storms were in a nervous condition, and
were morbidly apprehensive of being anticipated by some one in
dredging for the invaluable pearl-oysters. They were afraid their
errand would be suspected, or they would be attacked after they
should secure their prize.</p>

<p>One day, under the pretense of wanting medicine, Hyde Brazzier
suddenly appeared at the cabin door. The mate and captain were,
as usual, studying the chart, and while the mate was ransacking
the medicine chest for the drug, that single eye of the sailor
secured five minutes' sharp scrutiny of the all-important map.</p>

<p>Redvignez and Brazzier were not much together, as a matter of
course, for one was in the captain's watch and the other in the
mate's, but during the long, pleasant days and nights when they
were voyaging toward the South Seas, they obtained many opportunities
for confidential talks. All this might have been in the natural
order of things on board the schooner, where the discipline was
not strict, but Abe Storms had become pretty well satisfied that
harm was meant, and mischief was brewing. He saw it in the looks
and manner of these two men, who, while they were watching others,
did not suspect they were watched in turn.</p>

<p>About Pomp he was not so certain. The steward and cook seemed
to be on good terms with the two sailors, and he frequently sat
with them as they formed a little group forward, on the bright
moonlight nights, when they preferred to sit thus and smoke and
spin yarns to going below and catching slumber, when it was their
privilege to do so.</p>

<p>"I believe he is in with them," was the conclusion which Storms,
the mate, finally reached, after watching and listening as best
he could for several days. "They're hatching some conspiracy&mdash;most
likely a mutiny to take possession of the ship. Captain Bergen
doesn't suspect it&mdash;he is so absorbed in the pearl business; and
I'll let him alone for the present, though it may be best to give
him a hint or two to keep him on his guard."</p>

<p>It never can be known what the restraining power of little Inez
Hawthorne was on board that vessel on her extraordinary voyage
to the Paumotu Islands, in the South Seas. She lived over again
the same life that was hers during the few days spent on the <em>Polynesia</em>.
She ran hither and thither, climbing into dangerous places at
times, but with such grace and command of her limbs that she never
once fell or even lost her balance. She chatted and laughed with
Brazzier and Redvig, but she preferred the others, and showed
it so plainly in her manner, that, unfortunately, the two could
not avoid noticing it.</p>

<p>"See here," said Captain Bergen, one evening while sitting in
the cabin with the child on his knee, "I want you to try and think
hard and answer me all the questions I ask you. Will you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will, if you don't ask too hard ones."</p>

<p>"Well, I will be easy as I can. You have told me all about the
big steamer that you were on when we found you, and you said that
you lived with your Uncle Con in San Francisco, and that it was
he and your Aunt Jemima that put you on board."</p>

<p>"I didn't say any such thing!" indignantly protested Inez. "I
haven't got any Aunt Jemima&mdash;it was my Aunt Letitia."</p>

<p>The captain and mate smiled, for a little piece of strategy had
succeeded. They had never before got the girl to give the name
of her aunt, though she mentioned that of her uncle. But she now
spoke it, her memory refreshed by the slight teasing to which
she was subjected.</p>

<p>"That's very good. I'm glad to learn that your uncle and aunt
had two such pretty names as Con and Letitia Bumblebee."</p>

<p>"Ain't you ashamed of yourself?" demanded Inez, turning upon
him with flashing eyes. "I never heard of such a funny name as
that."</p>

<p>"I beg pardon. What, then, is their name?"</p>

<p>The little head was bent and the fair brow wrinkled with thought.
She had tried the same thing before, though it must be believed
that she could not have tried very hard, or she would not have
failed to remember the name of those with whom she lived but a
short time before. But she used her brain to its utmost now, and
it did not take her long to solve the question. In a few seconds
she looked up and laughed.</p>

<p>"Of course I know their name. It was Hermann, though he sometimes
called himself George Smith."</p>

<p>"The other sounds German," remarked Storms, in a lower voice.
"Go ahead and get all you can from her."</p>

<p>"How long did you live with them?"</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Inez, as she turned her lustrous blue eyes
toward the roof of the cabin, as if she expected to read the answer
there. "I guess it was about two&mdash;three hundred years."</p>

<p>She was in earnest, and Storms observed:</p>

<p>"She must be a little off on that; but take another tack."</p>

<p>The captain did so.</p>

<p>"Do you remember living with any one excepting your Uncle George
and Aunt Letitia?"</p>

<p>Inez thought hard again, and replied, after a few seconds:</p>

<p>"I don't know. Sometimes he was Uncle George and sometimes Uncle
Con. We lived in the city a good while, where there were, oh,
such lots of houses! but there was a time before that when we
come such a long, long way in the cars. We rode and rode, and
I guess we must have come from the moon, for we was ten years
on the road."</p>

<p>"Do you remember what sort of looking place the moon was?"</p>

<p>"It was just like San Francisco&mdash;that is, it was full of houses."</p>

<p>The officers looked at each other with a smile, and the mate
said:</p>

<p>"It's plain enough what that means. She has come from New York,
over the Union Pacific, and her trip was probably the longest
of her life."</p>

<p>"Do you remember your father and mother?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Inez, with a look of perplexity on her young
face which it was not pleasant to see. "Sometimes I remember or
dream of them, before we took such a long ride on the cars. My
mother used to hold me on her lap and kiss me, and so did my father,
and then there was crying, and something dreadful happened in
the house, and then I can't remember anything more until I was
on the cars."</p>

<p>"It may be all right," said Captain Bergen to his mate, "for
this could occur without anything being amiss."</p>

<p>"It is possible; but I have a conviction that there is something
wrong about the whole business. I believe, in short, that the
person who placed her on board the steamer <em>Polynesia</em>
had no claim upon her at all."</p>

<p>"That, in fact, the man stole her?"</p>

<p>"That's it, exactly; and still further, I don't believe she has
any father or mother in Japan, and that if we had gone thither
we should have lost all the time and accomplished nothing."</p>

<p>"It may be, Abe, that you are right," said the captain, who held
a great admiration for his mate, "but I must say you can build
a fraud and conspiracy on the smallest foundation of any man I
ever knew. But, Abe, you may be right, I say, and if you are,
it's just as well that we didn't go on a fool's errand to Tokio,
after all."</p>

<p>"The truth will soon be known, captain."</p>
