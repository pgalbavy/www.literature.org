<p>As Alvin Landon drew near the open country he gave his thoughts
wholly to the two strangers in front, ceasing to look back or
listen for the one at the rear. The keen eyes strove to penetrate
the silent gloom on his right and left, but they saw nothing.
Probably fifty feet intervened between him and the full flood
of moonlight, when, with more startling effect than that caused
by the hooting of the owl, a sepulchral voice sounded through
the stillness:</p>

<p>"<em>Hold on there, pard!</em>"</p>

<p>It was purely instinctive on the part of the youth that he made
a bound forward and dashed off on a dead run. Not until he burst
into the bright illumination did he awaken to the fact that he
was doing the very opposite of what he intended and actually playing
the coward. The fact that his natural courage had come back was
proved at the same moment of his abrupt stoppage, for the sharp
report of a pistol rang out from directly behind him. The space
was so short that it was evident the shot had been fired not to
harm him, but to check his flight.</p>

<p>At the moment of halting, he whirled around and saw a youth who
could have been no older than himself charging impetuously upon
him. Alvin's halt was so instant and so unexpected on the part
of his pursuer that they would have collided but for the fugitive's
fist, which shot out and landed with full force upon the face
of the other. Alvin knew how to strike hard, and the energy which
he threw into the effort was intensified by the swift approach
of his assailant.</p>

<p>No blow could have been more effective. With a grunt, his foe
tumbled headlong, flapped over on his back and lay as if dead.
Had he been the only enemy, the combat would have ended then and
there, for never was an antagonist knocked out more emphatically,
but his companion now dashed into the fray.</p>

<p>He was somewhat older than the one who had come to grief, but
still lacked full maturity. Too cautious to make the mistake of
the other, he checked himself while just beyond the fist that
had done such admirable work. With an oath he shouted:</p>

<p>"I'll teach you how to kill my pal."</p>

<p>"I don't need any teaching; come on and I'll serve you the same
way," replied Alvin, eager for the attack to be made.</p>

<p>His opponent came on. He had learned from the rashness of his
partner, for after putting up his hands, like a professional pugilist,
he began feinting and circling about Alvin, in the search for
an inviting opening. The latter did not forget the instruction
he had received from Professor Donovan and stood on his guard,
equally vigilant for an advantage.</p>

<p>The elder had made a complete circle about Alvin, who turned
as on a pivot to meet his attack, and was just quick enough to
parry the vicious blow launched at him, but not quick enough to
counter effectively. The next instant the fist of the taller fellow
came in contact with the chest of Alvin, who was driven back several
paces. His foe attempted to follow it up, but was staggered by
a facer delivered straight and true. Then our young friend in
turn pressed the other, who, bewildered by the rapidity and fierceness
of the assault, made a rush to clinch.</p>

<p>Nothing could have suited Alvin better and he met the effort
with a storm of furious blows. The chief one was aimed at the
chin, and had it landed the result would have been a knockout,
but it was a trifle short. Determined not to be denied, Alvin
pressed on with all the power at his command. "Keep cool and strike
straight," was the motto of his instructor at the gymnasium, and
though he was enraged he heeded the wise advice.</p>

<p>Nearly a score of blows were exchanged with such rapidity that
a spectator could not have kept track of them, and then Alvin
"got there." The thud was followed by an almost complete somersault
of the victim. The master was prompted to push his success by
attacking his enemy before he could rise, but another law flashed
upon Alvin. "Never strike a man when he is down," a chivalrous
policy when the rules of the game govern both contestants. It
was doubtful whether Alvin would have received similar consideration
had the situation been reversed, but he could not feel sure of
that until the proof was given. He therefore calmly waited for
the other to rise, when he would be upon him like a tiger.</p>

<p>A minute or two passed before the fallen one recovered enough
to begin climbing to his feet. He could have risen sooner, but
deceived his conqueror by feigning weakness and fumbled aimlessly
about as if too groggy to get his bearings. But he was helping
in a treacherous trick.</p>

<p>As Alvin stood, his back was toward the first miscreant, who
recovered from his stupor while his companion still lay on the
ground. Our young friend gave no thought to the one, whom he believed
to be out of the affair altogether.</p>

<p>The same young man, however, gave quick thought to him. Bounding
to his feet he sneaked up unseen and struck a blow that drove
Alvin forward so violently that he had to make a leap over the
second assailant to avoid falling upon him. It was a wonder that
he was not struck down senseless. As it was, he was partially
stunned, but rallied in a flash.</p>

<p>Now it would have been sensible and no disgrace to the heroic
lad, when he found himself confronted by two muscular and enraged
youths, to dash at full speed for home. But he did nothing of
the kind.</p>

<p>"Come on, both of you!" he called out. "I'm not afraid and you
haven't got me yet!"</p>

<p>It would be a pleasure to record that our young friend defeated
the couple, but such a triumph in the nature of things was impossible.
Either of them would have given him all he could do, and the two
united were sure to overcome him. With his stubborn resolve to
have it out with them he must have suffered but for an unexpected
turn of events.</p>

<p>You remember that a third stranger was approaching from the other
direction. In the hurricane rush of the fight, Alvin forgot about
him, but he now arrived and threw himself with a vengeance into
the affray. His bursting upon the scene convinced the lone defender
that the time had come to show his ability as a sprinter. While
quite ready to oppose two, he knew he could not stand up against
three. Before he started, however, he saw with a thrill that the
new arrival had attacked with unrestrainable fierceness the one
who had just struck Alvin. In other words, instead of being an
enemy he was a much-needed ally.</p>

<p>This stranger did not utter a word at first, but attended strictly
to business, and that he was a master of it was proved by his
first blow, which sent the fellow staggering backward finally
falling with his heels kicking toward the orb of night. There
was no thought of chivalry on the part of the conquerer, who landed
again as he was climbing to his feet.</p>

<p>"Let up!" protested the victim. "Do you want to kill a fellow?"</p>

<p>"Begorrah, ye guessed it right the fust time!" was the reply
of the friend, who turned to Alvin:</p>

<p>"If ye'll smash that spalpeen I'll be attending to the same wid
this one."</p>

<p>The slight diversion was enough to give the dazed victim on the
ground time to come to his feet, when he turned and was off like
a deer in the direction whence had come his conqueror. Determined
not to be despoiled of his victory, the Irish lad&mdash;as his accent
showed him to be&mdash;pursued at the highest bent of speed. But his
short legs were not equal to the task, and the terrified assailant
made such excellent time that a few minutes sufficed to carry
him beyond all danger. The "broth of a boy" would not give up
at first. The two held their places in the middle of the highway,
so that both were in plain sight, with the fugitive steadily drawing
away.</p>

<p>"Howld on, ye spalpeen!" shouted the pursuer. "I'm not through
wid ye!"</p>

<p>But he who fled was glad enough to be through with the business,
and kept up his desperate flight until the other ceased and turned
back to learn how matters were going with the friend to whose
aid he had rushed.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar story was to be told of the second miscreant,
who had seized the chance to take to flight in the opposite direction.
In this case, the fleet footed Alvin proved the superior in speed
and within a hundred yards overtook him. The moment he was within
reach he let drive and his fist landed in the back of the other's
neck. Inasmuch as he was going at his highest speed and the blow
sent his head and shoulders forward with additional swiftness,
the inevitable result was that he fell, his face plowing the dirt
and his hat flying a dozen feet from him.</p>

<p>Before he could rise, Alvin was upon him. The fellow threw up
his hands to protect his countenance and whined:</p>

<p>"Please don't hit me again! I'm half killed now!"</p>

<p>The cringing appeal changed Alvin's indignation to disgusted
pity. He unclenched his fingers and dropped his hands.</p>

<p>"Get up! I won't hit you, though you deserve it."</p>

<p>His victim seemed to be in doubt and slowly came to his feet
still whining:</p>

<p>"We didn't know it was you; it was a mistake."</p>

<p>"It does look that way," was the grim comment of Alvin. "Get
up, I say; you have nothing to fear from me."</p>

<p>The fellow was in doubt. He slowly rose, but the instant he stood
erect, he was off again as if propelled from a catapult. Alvin,
instead of pursuing and overtaking him, stood still and laughed.</p>

<p>"Come back and get your hat!" he shouted, but the fugitive did
not abate his speed and made the dust fly until he vanished in
the moonlight.</p>

<p>Yielding to an impulse, Alvin walked to where the headgear lay
and picked it up. It was a valuable chip hat, such as is fashionable
in summer in all parts of the country. The captor was wondering
whether it contained the fellow's name. The moonlight was not
strong enough for him to see distinctly, and, bringing out his
rubber safe from his hip pocket, he struck a match to aid in the
scrutiny.</p>
