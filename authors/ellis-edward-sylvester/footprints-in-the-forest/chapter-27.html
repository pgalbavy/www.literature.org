<p>The amazement of Jack Carleton, when he recognized the figure
before him, was beyond description. It was Otto Relstaub&mdash;the
same honest German lad from whom he parted weeks previous when
the two were captives in the hands of the wandering Sauks, the
divisions of which took such different directions. It was the
same lad&mdash;the only noticeable difference being that he was bareheaded
and his garments were much frayed and torn. He held his gun in
his right hand, the stock resting on the ground, while he looked
with a half-inquiring expression, as if doubting the identity
of the young Kentuckian who had come such a distance to help restore
him to his friends. But a second stare satisfied both, and rushing
toward each other, they shook hands, laughed and cried for very
joy, their expressions disjointed and only clear in their evidence
of the delight which overflowed in their hearts.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot!" exclaimed Jack, drawing Otto's hat from under
his coat and slapping it on the yellow crown of his friend; "here's
something which belongs to you."</p>

<p>"Vere did you got him?" asked Otto, taking it from his head and
inspecting it. "I never dinks I would sees him agin."</p>

<p>Jack gave the particulars which the reader learned long ago,
adding an account of the efforts made by Deerfoot and the Sauk
to trace him, and of the despair all felt when they were told
the captive had been left to die alone in the woods.</p>

<p>"I never expected to meet you again," said Jack, "and I couldn't
understand why it was Deerfoot had any hope."</p>

<p>"'Cause he <em>knowed</em>," was the truthful remark.</p>

<p>"But what was the matter with you? You must have got well in
a hurry."</p>

<p>Otto threw back his head and laughed in his old-fashioned, hearty
style, adding:</p>

<p>"Do you dinks I vos <em>very</em> sick?"</p>

<p>And then the lad told his strange story, which perhaps you would
prefer to hear in a little better accent than that of the narrator.</p>

<p>The statement made to Deerfoot by Lone Bear only a few hours
before was shown to be accurate in every particular by the narrative
of Otto himself, but it had a phase which neither Lone Bear nor
any of his comrades suspected.</p>

<p>The Sauks who wandered away from their fellows, taking Otto along
as their prisoner, met the Pawnees, who, as the reader well knows,
were a long ways from home. Otto was bartered to them, and his
captors continued toward their village, many days' journey to
the north and west. They went at a moderate pace, stopping and
hunting by the way and making themselves familiar with the country,
with a view of removing their lodges thither, provided they could
find a satisfactory place.</p>

<p>They were many hours on this dismal tramp when Otto asked himself
whether it would not be as well to give up all thought of returning
home, and of becoming one of the people into whose hands he had
fallen. The hardship imposed by his parents impelled him to such
a course, and, more than once, he decided not to make any effort
to leave the Pawnees, even if a good opportunity offered. Had
it not been for Jack Carleton and his kind mother he probably
would have become an adopted Pawnee.</p>

<p>But, as the distance between him and his humble cabin in far
away Martinsville increased, a feeling of homesickness crept over
him until he was utterly miserable. He finally reached the resolve
that he would never rest until he was back again in the log cabin
near the banks of the Mississippi; no matter how oppressive his
lot, it was <em>home</em>, and that was preferable to a gilded
palace.</p>

<p>The prisoner in the dungeon finds no difficulty in making up
his mind to leave; the insurmountable task is to carry out his
intention; and the days and nights passed without the first glimmer
of hope appearing in the sky of Otto Relstaub.</p>

<p>Several times he saw chances which he believed would enable him
to get away, but he feared the inevitable pursuit. He was so many
miles from home that the most laborious tramping would be required
for many days, even if able to proceed in a direct line.</p>

<p>It was this dread which prevented such an attempt on the part
of Otto, while his homesickness increased until his appetite vanished
and his looks were woe-begone. While in this pitiful condition
the poor fellow asked himself whether he could not feign illness
to such a degree that his captors would abandon him to die.</p>

<p>The probabilities pointed the other way. In the first place the
Pawnees were quite certain to perceive the sham, and, in case
they were deceived, they were likely to tomahawk Otto so as to
end the annoyance. These two considerations kept him plodding
along with the party, which, fortunately for him, progressed slowly.</p>

<p>But while the youth's physical condition was not bad enough to
deceive the Indians, he became desperate, and determined to take
the first opportunity that presented itself. Within an hour he
found a chance to pilfer some tobacco belonging to Lone Bear.
He did so with such care that he was not suspected. Straightway
he swallowed it, and I need not say that it was unnecessary for
Otto to pretend he was ill; he was never in such a state of collapse
in his life.</p>

<p>His deathly paleness convinced the Pawnees that their captive
was at death's door. They urged him to walk, but he could not,
and they stayed in camp longer than was intended, in the hope
that the patient would rally.</p>

<p>Otto showed a good deal of pluck when, finding himself recovering,
he resolutely swallowed some more of the poisonous weed and soon
became so prostrated that he really believed his last hour was
at hand. He was in great danger, for the nicotine threatened the
seat of life, and Otto lost interest in every thing, feeling that
it would be a relief to perish and end his misery.</p>

<p>This was his condition when the Pawnees formed the opinion that
he could not live more than an hour or two at the most. Accordingly,
they covered him with leaves, laid his hat over his face, and,
placing his gun beside him, went off. The youth lay hovering,
as it seemed, between life and death. While in that condition,
he detected a footfall near him. He was able to turn his head,
but could not move his body. He recognized Red Wolf, who was standing
a few steps away, knife in hand. He had returned to take the scalp
of the dying lad, and would have done so, had not Lone Bear, coming
from another direction, interfered. By some argument he led the
other to change his mind, and both walked away.</p>

<p>From that moment reaction set in, and Otto rallied fast. It was
beginning to grow dark, and he was soon shut in by impenetrable
gloom. Fearful that Red Wolf or some one else would steal upon
him in the night, he crept deeper into the wood, where he knew
he could not be found when the sun was not shining.</p>

<p>Although his rugged system rapidly threw off the nicotine poisoning,
he was weak and dizzy. He gained a few hours sleep before morning,
but was awake at the earliest streakings of light and started
on his return.</p>

<p>Otto Relstaub's previous experience in the woods now served him
well. He discovered that the war party, instead of continuing
westward, were retrograding and doubling on their own trail. He
suspected the true reason they were prospecting for a new site
for their villages. He had judged from their actions that something
of the kind was in their thoughts.</p>

<p>As the course of the lad lay in the same direction, he wisely
chose to deviate until he was far off their trail, so as to avoid
any risk of them.</p>

<p>Otto's deliverance from captivity was singular indeed, but he
was too wise to consider it complete until certain that such was
the case. He feared that Red Wolf or some of his comrades would
return to the spot where he had been abandoned; and, discovering
the trick, instantly pursue him.</p>

<p>He therefore devoted many hours to elaborate efforts to obliterate
his own trail, or to shape it so that even a bloodhound could
not track him. He crossed all the streams he could, wading long
distances through the water where the depth was too great to permit
his footprints to be seen. When he finally emerged, he often did
so on the same side which he entered, perhaps repeating his maneuver
once or twice before leaving the stream by the opposite bank.</p>

<p>This played havoc with Otto's garments, which were torn and injured
until it looked doubtful whether they would last him through his
journey. Sometimes, while walking where the water was only a little
above his knees, he would abruptly step into that which was six
or eight feet deep, but he always reached bottom.</p>

<p>During the first day, when the vigorous system of the fugitive
demanded food, and he saw the chance of bringing down a wild turkey
which trotted swiftly across his path, he refrained through fear
that the report of his gun would betray him. He ate a few berries
that seemed to have lived over from the preceding winter (the
season being rather early for any thing of the kind to have grown
since), chewed some tender buds, and lying down at night, thanked
heaven he felt so well.</p>

<p>Reaching the bank of the river across which his friends had passed
several times, he felt the opportunity for which he longed had
come.</p>

<p>With much labor, he succeeded in constructing a raft sufficiently
buoyant to float him without resting any part of his body in the
water. Pushing this out into the stream, he drifted fully three
miles, gradually working the support toward the further shore.</p>

<p>"Dere," he exclaimed, when he stepped out on land, "dey won't
find my tracks if dey don't look all summer."</p>

<p>This was the fact, so far as trailing the fugitive from the spot
where he was abandoned, but it so happened that the course of
the raft down stream carried him into the very section where his
late captors were hunting back and forth. The wonder was that
he was not discovered, for there must have been times when his
enemies were on each side the river, and he was floating directly
between them&mdash;and that, too, when the sun was shining.</p>

<p>He was so tired that he lay down beside a fallen tree and slept
until near nightfall. Even then he was aroused by the report of
a gun so near him that he started up and rushed off in such haste
that he left his hat behind him. Soon another rifle was discharged
so close that he believed he was surrounded by foes. He had missed
his hat, but dared not go back after it, the last gun seeming
to have been fired from a point near it. All he strove to do was
to get as far from the spot as he could in the least time possible.
A strong wind, accompanied by some rain, followed and hastened
his footsteps.</p>

<p>It certainly was remarkable that the fugitive's presence so near
a number of the hostiles was not discovered, but there is no reason
to believe that any such suspicion entered their minds, or that
they dreamed of the trick played on them by the captive when he
seemed to be lying at the point of death.</p>

<p>Otto pressed on, until once more he felt he had the best ground
for believing he would elude his enemies; but he was famishing
for food, and when in the moment of temptation, a dozen wild turkeys
trotted by him in the woods, he fell and let fly at the plumpest,
which also fell.</p>
