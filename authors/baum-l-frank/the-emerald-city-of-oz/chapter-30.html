The writer of these Oz stories has received a little note from
Princess Dorothy of Oz which, for a time, has made him feel rather
disconcerted.  The note was written on a broad, white feather from a
stork's wing, and it said:
<P>
<P>
"YOU WILL NEVER HEAR ANYTHING MORE ABOUT OZ, BECAUSE WE ARE NOW CUT
OFF FOREVER FROM ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD.  BUT TOTO AND I WILL
ALWAYS LOVE YOU AND ALL THE OTHER CHILDREN WHO LOVE US.
<P>
"DOROTHY GALE."
<P>

This seemed to me too bad, at first, for Oz is a very interesting
fairyland.  Still, we have no right to feel grieved, for we have had
enough of the history of the Land of Oz to fill six story books, and
from its quaint people and their strange adventures we have been able
to learn many useful and amusing things.
<P>
So good luck to little Dorothy and her companions.  May they live long
in their invisible country and be very happy!
