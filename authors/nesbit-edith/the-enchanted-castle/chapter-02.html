<p><em>WHEN </em>you are young so many things are difficult to believe,
and yet the dullest people will tell you that they are true&mdash;such
things, for instance, as that the earth goes round the sun, and
that it is not flat but round. But the things that seem really
likely, like fairy-tales and magic, are, so say the grown-ups,
not true at all. Yet they are so easy to believe, especially when
you see them happening. And, as I am always telling you, the most
wonderful things happen to all sorts of people, only you never
hear about them because the people think that no one will believe
their stories, and so they don't tell them to any one except me.
And they tell me, because they know that I can believe anything.</p>

<p>When Jimmy had awakened the Sleeping Princess, and she had invited
the three children to go with her to her palace and get something
to eat, they all knew quite surely that they had come into a place
of magic happenings. And they walked in a slow procession along
the grass towards the castle. The Princess went first, and Kathleen
carried her shining train; then came Jimmy, and Gerald came last.
They were all quite sure that they had walked right into the middle
of a fairy tale, and they were the more ready to believe it because
they were so tired and hungry. They were, in fact, so hungry and
tired that they hardly noticed where they were going, or observed
the beauties of the formal gardens through which the pink-silk
Princess was leading them. They were in a sort of dream, from
which they only partially awakened to find themselves in a big
hall, with suits of armour and old flags round the walls, the
skins of beasts on the floor, and heavy oak tables and benches
ranged along it.</p>

<p>The Princess entered, slow and stately, but once inside she twitched
her sheeny train out of Jimmy's hand and turned to the three.</p>

<p>"You just wait here a minute," she said, "and mind you don't
talk while I'm away. This castle is crammed with magic, and I
don't know what will happen if you talk." And with that, picking
up the thick goldy-pink folds under her arms, she ran out, as
Jimmy said afterwards, "most unprincesslike," showing as she ran
black stockings and black strap shoes.</p>

<p>Jimmy wanted very much to say that he didn't believe anything
would happen, only he was afraid something would happen if he
did, so he merely made a face and put out his tongue. The others
pretended not to see this, which was much more crushing than anything
they could have said. So they sat in silence, and Gerald ground
the heel of his boot upon the marble floor. Then the Princess
came back, very slowly and kicking her long skirts in front of
her at every step. She could not hold them up now because of the
tray she carried.</p>

<p>It was not a silver tray, as you might have expected, but an
oblong tin one. She set it down noisily on the end of the long
table and breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Oh! it <em>was</em> heavy," she said. I don't know what fairy
feast the children's fancy had been busy with. Anyhow, this was
nothing like it. The heavy tray held a loaf of bread, a lump of
cheese, and a brown jug of water. The rest of its heaviness was
just plates and mugs and knives.</p>

<p>"Come along," said the Princess hospitably. "I couldn't find
anything but bread and cheese&mdash;but it doesn't matter, because
everything's magic here, and unless you have some dreadful secret
fault the bread and cheese will turn into anything you like. What
<em>would</em> you like?" she asked Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Roast chicken," said Kathleen, without hesitation.</p>

<p>The pinky Princess cut a slice of bread and laid it on a dish.
"There you are," she said, "roast chicken. Shall I carve it, or
will you?"</p>

<p>"You, please," said Kathleen, and received a piece of dry bread
on a plate.</p>

<p>"Green peas?" asked the Princess, cut a piece of cheese and laid
it beside the bread.</p>

<p>Kathleen began to eat the bread, cutting it up with knife and
fork as you would eat chicken. It was no use owning that she didn't
see any chicken and peas, or anything but cheese and dry bread,
because that would be owning that she had some dreadful secret
fault.</p>

<p>"If I have, it <em>is</em> a secret, even from me," she told
herself.</p>

<p>The others asked for roast beef and cabbage&mdash;and got it, she
supposed, though to her it only looked like dry bread and Dutch
cheese.</p>

<p>"I <em>do</em> wonder what my dreadful secret fault is," she
thought, as the Princess remarked that, as for her, she could
fancy a slice of roast peacock. "This one," she added, lifting
a second mouthful of dry bread on her fork, "is quite delicious."</p>

<p>"It's a game, isn't it?" asked Jimmy suddenly.</p>

<p>"What's a game?" asked the Princess, frowning.</p>

<p>"Pretending it's beef&mdash;the bread and cheese, I mean."</p>

<p>"A game? But it <em>is</em> beef. Look at it," said the Princess,
opening her eyes very wide.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," said Jimmy feebly. "I was only joking."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "IT'S A <em>GAME, ISN'T IT?" ASKED JIMMY</em>.]</p>

<p>Bread and cheese is not perhaps so good as roast beef or chicken
or peacock (I'm not sure about the peacock. I never tasted peacock,
did you?); but bread and cheese is, at any rate, very much better
than nothing when you have gone on having nothing since breakfast
(gooseberries and gingerbeer hardly count) and it is long past
your proper dinner-time. Every one ate and drank and felt much
better.</p>

<p>"Now," said the Princess, brushing the breadcrumbs off her green
silk lap, "if you're sure you won't have any more meat you can
come and see my treasures. Sure you won't take the least bit more
chicken? No? Then follow me."</p>

<p>She got up and they followed her down the long hall to the end
where the great stone stairs ran up at each side and joined in
a broad flight leading to the gallery above. Under the stairs
was a hanging of tapestry.</p>

<p>"Beneath this arras," said the Princess, "is the door leading
to my private apartments." She held the tapestry up with both
hands, for it was heavy, and showed a little door that had been
hidden by it.</p>

<p>"The key," she said, "hangs above."</p>

<p>And so it did, on a large rusty nail.</p>

<p>"Put it in," said the Princess, "and turn it."</p>

<p>Gerald did so, and the great key creaked and grated in the lock.</p>

<p>"Now push," she said; "push hard, all of you."</p>

<p>They pushed hard, all of them. The door gave way, and they fell
over each other into the dark space beyond.</p>

<p>The Princess dropped the curtain and came after them, closing
the door behind her.</p>

<p>"Look out!" she said; "look out! there are two steps down."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Gerald, rubbing his knee at the bottom of the
steps. "We found that out for ourselves."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said the Princess, "but you can't have hurt yourselves
much. Go straight on. There aren't any more steps."</p>

<p>They went straight on&mdash;in the dark.</p>

<p>"When you come to the door just turn the handle and go in. Then
stand still till I find the matches. I know where they are."</p>

<p>"Did they have matches a hundred years ago?" asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>"I meant the tinder-box," said the Princess quickly. "We always
called it the matches. Don't you? Here, let me go first."</p>

<p>She did, and when they had reached the door she was waiting for
them with a candle in her hand. She thrust it on Gerald.</p>

<p>"Hold it steady," she said, and undid the shutters of a long
window, so that first a yellow streak and then a blazing great
oblong of light flashed at them and the room was full of sunshine.</p>

<p>"It makes the candle look quite silly," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"So it does," said the Princess, and blew out the candle. Then
she took the key from the outside of the door, put it in the inside
key-hole, and turned it.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>SHE WAS WAITING FOR THEM WITH A CANDLE IN
HER HAND</em>.]</p>

<p>The room they were in was small and high. Its domed ceiling was
of deep blue with gold stars painted on it. The walls were of
wood, panelled and carved, and there was no furniture in it whatever.</p>

<p>"This," said the Princess, "is my treasure chamber."</p>

<p>"But where," asked Kathleen politely, "<em>are</em> the treasures?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see them?" asked the Princess.</p>

<p>"No, we don't," said Jimmy bluntly. "You don't come that bread-and-cheese
game with me&mdash;not twice over, you don't!"</p>

<p>"If you <em>really</em> don't see them," said the Princess, "I
suppose I shall have to say the charm. Shut your eyes, please.
And give me your word of honour you won't look till I tell you,
and that you'll never tell any one what you've seen."</p>

<p>Their words of honour were something that the children would
rather not have given just then, but they gave them all the same,
and shut their eyes tight.</p>

<p>"Wiggadil yougadoo begadee leegadeeve nowgadow?" said the Princess
rapidly; and they heard the swish of her silk train moving across
the room. Then there was a creaking, rustling noise.</p>

<p>"She's locking us in!" cried Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Your word of honour," gasped Gerald.</p>

<p>"Oh, do be quick!" moaned Kathleen.</p>

<p>"You may look," said the voice of the Princess. And they looked.
The room was not the same room, yet&mdash;yes, the starry-vaulted blue
ceiling was there, and below it half a dozen feet of the dark
panelling, but below that the walls of the room blazed and sparkled
with white and blue and red and green and gold and silver. Shelves
ran round the room, and on them were gold cups and silver dishes,
and platters and goblets set with gems, ornaments of gold and
silver, tiaras of diamonds, necklaces of rubies, strings of emeralds
and pearls, all set out in unimaginable splendour against a background
of faded blue velvet. It was like the Crown jewels that you see
when your kind uncle takes you to the Tower, only there seemed
to be far more jewels than you or any one else has ever seen together
at the Tower or anywhere else.</p>

<p>The three children remained breathless, open-mouthed, staring
at the sparkling splendours all about them, while the Princess
stood, her arm stretched out in a gesture of command, and a proud
smile on her lips.</p>

<p>"My word!" said Gerald, in a low whisper. But no one spoke out
loud. They waited as if spellbound for the Princess to speak.</p>

<p>She spoke.</p>

<p>"What price bread-and-cheese games now?" she asked triumphantly.
"Can I do magic, or can't I?"</p>

<p>"You can; oh, you can!" said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"May we&mdash;may we <em>touch</em>?" asked Gerald.</p>

<p>"All that is mine is yours," said the Princess, with a generous
wave of her brown hand, and added quickly, "Only, of course, you
mustn't take anything away with you."</p>

<p>"We're not thieves!" said Jimmy. The others were already busy
turning over the wonderful things on the blue velvet shelves.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said the Princess, "but you're a very unbelieving
little boy. You think I can't see inside you, but I can. <em>I</em>
know what you've been thinking."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know well enough," said the Princess. "You're thinking
about the bread and cheese that I changed into beef, and about
your secret fault. I say, let's all dress up and you be princes
and princesses too."</p>

<p>"To crown our hero," said Gerald, lifting a gold crown with a
cross on the top, "was the work of a moment." He put the crown
on his head, and added a collar of SS and a zone of sparkling
emeralds, which would not quite meet round his middle. He turned
from fixing it by an ingenious adaptation of his belt to find
the others already decked with diadems, necklaces, and rings.</p>

<p>"How splendid you look!" said the Princess, "and how I wish your
clothes were prettier. What ugly clothes people wear nowadays!
A hundred years ago<hr>"</p>

<p>Kathleen stood quite still with a diamond bracelet raised in
her hand.</p>

<p>"I say," she said. "The King and Queen?"</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> King and Queen?" asked the Princess.</p>

<p>"Your father and mother, your sorrowing parents," said Kathleen.
"They'll have waked up by now. Won't they be wanting to see you,
after a hundred years, you know?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;yes," said the Princess slowly. "I embraced my rejoicing
parents when I got the bread and cheese. They're having their
dinner. They won't expect me yet. Here," she added, hastily putting
a ruby bracelet on Kathleen's arm, "see how splendid that is!"</p>

<p>Kathleen would have been quite content to go on all day trying
on different jewels and looking at herself in the little silver-framed
mirror that the Princess took from one of the shelves, but the
boys were soon weary of this amusement.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Gerald, "if you're sure your father and mother
won't want you, let's go out and have a jolly good game of something.
You could play besieged castles awfully well in that maze&mdash;unless
you can do any more magic tricks."</p>

<p>"You forget," said the Princess, "I'm grown up. I don't play
games. And I don't like to do too much magic at a time, it's so
tiring. Besides, it'll take us ever so long to put all these things
back in their proper places."</p>

<p>It did. The children would have laid the jewels just anywhere;
but the Princess showed them that every necklace, or ring, or
bracelet had its own home on the velvet&mdash;a slight hollowing in
the shelf beneath, so that each stone fitted into its own little
nest.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>KATHLEEN LOOKING AT HERSELF IN THE LITTLE
SILVER-FRAMED MIRROR</em>.]</p>

<p>As Kathleen was fitting the last shining ornament into its proper
place, she saw that part of the shelf near it held, not bright
jewels, but rings and brooches and chains, as well as queer things
that she did not know the names of, and all were of dull metal
and odd shapes.</p>

<p>"What's all this rubbish?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Rubbish, indeed!" said the Princess. "Why those are <em>all</em>
magic things! This bracelet&mdash;any one who wears it has got to speak
the truth. This chain makes you as strong as ten men; if you wear
this spur your horse will go a mile a minute; or if you're walking
it's the same as seven-league boots."</p>

<p>"What does this brooch do?" asked Kathleen, reaching out her
hand. The Princess caught her by the wrist.</p>

<p>"You mustn't touch," she said; "if any one but me touches them
all the magic goes out at once and never comes back. That brooch
will give you any wish you like."</p>

<p>"And this ring?" Jimmy pointed.</p>

<p>"Oh, that makes you invisible."</p>

<p>"What's this?" asked Gerald, showing a curious buckle.</p>

<p>"Oh, that undoes the effect of all the other charms."</p>

<p>"Do you mean <em>really</em>?" Jimmy asked. "You're not just
kidding?"</p>

<p>"Kidding indeed!" repeated the Princess scornfully. "I should
have thought I'd shown you enough magic to prevent you speaking
to a Princess like <em>that</em>!"</p>

<p>"I say," said Gerald, visibly excited. "You might show us how
some of the things act. Couldn't you give us each a wish?"</p>

<p>The Princess did not at once answer. And the minds of the three
played with granted wishes&mdash;brilliant yet thoroughly reasonable&mdash;the
kind of wish that never seems to occur to people in fairy tales
when they suddenly get a chance to have their three wishes granted.</p>

<p>"No," said the Princess suddenly, "no; I can't give wishes to
<em>you</em>, it only gives me wishes. But I'll let you see the
ring make <em>me</em> invisible. Only you must shut your eyes
while I do it."</p>

<p>They shut them.</p>

<p>"Count fifty," said the Princess, "and then you may look. And
then you must shut them again, and count fifty, and I'll reappear."</p>

<p>Gerald counted, aloud. Through the counting one could hear a
creaking, rustling sound.</p>

<p>"Forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty!" said Gerald, and
they opened their eyes.</p>

<p>They were alone in the room. The jewels had vanished and so had
the Princess.</p>

<p>"She's gone out by the door, of course," said Jimmy, but the
door was locked.</p>

<p>"That <em>is</em> magic," said Kathleen breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Maskelyne and Devant can do <em>that</em> trick," said Jimmy.
"And I want my tea."</p>

<p>"Your tea!" Gerald's tone was full of contempt. "The lovely Princess,"
he went on, "reappeared as soon as our hero had finished counting
fifty. One, two, three, four<hr>"</p>

<p>Gerald and Kathleen had both closed their eyes. But somehow Jimmy
hadn't. He didn't mean to cheat, he just forgot. And as Gerald's
count reached twenty he saw a panel under the window open slowly.</p>

<p>"Her," he said to himself. "I <em>knew</em> it was a trick!"
and at once shut his eyes, like an honourable little boy.</p>

<p>On the word "fifty" six eyes opened. And the panel was closed
and there was no Princess.</p>

<p>"She hasn't pulled it off this time," said Gerald.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd better count again," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"I believe there's a cupboard under the window," said Jimmy,
"and she's hidden in it. Secret panel, you know."</p>

<p>"You looked! that's cheating," said the voice of the Princess
so close to his ear that he quite jumped.</p>

<p>"I didn't cheat."</p>

<p>"Where on earth<hr> What ever<hr>" said all three together. For
still there was no Princess to be seen.</p>

<p>"Come back visible, Princess dear," said Kathleen. "Shall we
shut our eyes and count again?"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly!" said the voice of the Princess, and it sounded
very cross.</p>

<p>"We're <em>not</em> silly," said Jimmy, and his voice was cross
too. "Why can't you come back and have done with it? You know
you're only hiding."</p>

<p>"Don't!" said Kathleen gently. "She <em>is</em> invisible, you
know."</p>

<p>"So should I be if I got into the cupboard," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said the sneering tone of the Princess, "you think
yourselves very clever, I dare say. But <em>I</em> don't mind.
We'll play that you <em>can't</em> see me, if you like."</p>

<p>"Well, but we <em>can't</em>," said Gerald. "It's no use getting
in a wax. If you're hiding, as Jimmy says, you'd better come out.
If you've really turned invisible, you'd better make yourself
visible again."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean," asked a voice quite changed, but still
the Princess's, "that you <em>can't</em> see me?"</p>

<p>"Can't you <em>see</em> we can't?" asked Jimmy rather unreasonably.</p>

<p>The sun was blazing in at the window; the eight-sided room was
very hot, and every one was getting cross.</p>

<p>"You can't <em>see</em> me?" There was the sound of a sob in
the voice of the invisible Princess.</p>

<p>"<em>No</em>, I tell you," said Jimmy, "and I want my tea&mdash;and<hr>"</p>

<p>What he was saying was broken off short, as one might break a
stick of sealing wax. And then in the golden afternoon a really
quite horrid thing happened: Jimmy suddenly leaned backwards,
then forwards, his eyes opened wide and his mouth too. Backward
and forward he went, very quickly and abruptly, then stood still.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's in a fit! Oh, Jimmy, dear Jimmy!" cried Kathleen, hurrying
to him. "What is it, dear, what is it?"</p>

<p>"It's <em>not</em> a fit," gasped Jimmy angrily. "She shook me."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>BACKWARD AND FORWARD HE WENT</em>.]</p>

<p>"Yes," said the voice of the Princess, "and I'll shake him again
if he keeps on saying he can't see me."</p>

<p>"You'd better shake <em>me</em>," said Gerald angrily. "I'm nearer
your own size."</p>

<p>And instantly she did. But not for long. The moment Gerald felt
hands on his shoulders he put up his own and caught those other
hands by the wrists. And there he was, holding wrists that he
couldn't see. It was a dreadful sensation. An invisible kick made
him wince, but he held tight to the wrists.</p>

<p>"Cathy," he cried, "come and hold her legs; she's kicking me."</p>

<p>"Where?" cried Kathleen, anxious to help. "I don't <em>see</em>
any legs."</p>

<p>"This is her hands I've got," cried Gerald. "She <em>is</em>
invisible right enough. Get hold of this hand, and then you can
feel your way down to her legs."</p>

<p>Kathleen did so. I wish I could make you understand how very,
very uncomfortable and frightening it is to feel, in broad daylight,
hands and arms that you can't see.</p>

<p>"I <em>won't</em> have you hold my legs," said the invisible
Princess, struggling violently.</p>

<p>"What are you so cross about?" Gerald was quite calm. "You said
you'd be invisible, and you <em>are</em>."</p>

<p>"I'm not."</p>

<p>"You are really. Look in the glass."</p>

<p>"I'm not; I can't be."</p>

<p>"Look in the glass," Gerald repeated, quite unmoved.</p>

<p>"Let go, then," she said.</p>

<p>Gerald did, and the moment he had done so he found it impossible
to believe that he really had been holding invisible hands.</p>

<p>"You're just pretending not to see me," said the Princess anxiously,
"aren't you? Do say you are. You've had your joke with me. Don't
keep it up. I don't like it."</p>

<p>"On our sacred word of honour," said Gerald, "you're still invisible."</p>

<p>There was a silence. Then, "Come," said the Princess. "I'll let
you out, and you can go. I'm tired of playing with you."</p>

<p>They followed her voice to the door, and through it, and along
the little passage into the hall. No one said anything. Every
one felt very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Let's get out of this," whispered Jimmy as they got to the end
of the hall.</p>

<p>But the voice of the Princess said: "Come out this way; it's
quicker. I think you're perfectly hateful. I'm sorry I ever played
with you. Mother always told me not to play with strange children."</p>

<p>A door abruptly opened, though no hand was seen to touch it.
"Come through, can't you!" said the voice of the Princess.</p>

<p>It was a little ante-room, with long, narrow mirrors between
its long, narrow windows.</p>

<p>"Goodbye," said Gerald. "Thanks for giving us such a jolly time.
Let's part friends," he added, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>An unseen hand was slowly put in his, which closed on it, vice-like.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "you've jolly well <em>got</em> to look in the
glass and own that we're not liars."</p>

<p>He led the invisible Princess to one of the mirrors, and held
her in front of it by the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "you just look for yourself."</p>

<p>There was a silence, and then a cry of despair rang through the
room.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh! I <em>am</em> invisible. Whatever shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Take the ring off," said Kathleen, suddenly practical.</p>

<p>Another silence.</p>

<p>"I <em>can't</em>!" cried the Princess. "It won't come off. But
it can't be the ring; rings don't make you invisible."</p>

<p>"You said this one did," said Kathleen, "and it has."</p>

<p>"But it <em>can't</em>," said the Princess. "I was only playing
at magic. I just hid in the secret cupboard&mdash;it was only a game.
Oh, whatever <em>shall</em> I do?"</p>

<p>"A game?" said Gerald slowly; "but you <em>can</em> do magic&mdash;the
invisible jewels, and you made them come visible."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's only a secret spring and the panelling slides up. Oh,
what am I to do?"</p>

<p>Kathleen moved towards the voice and gropingly got her arms round
a pink-silk waist that she couldn't see. Invisible arms clasped
her, a hot invisible cheek was laid against hers, and warm invisible
tears lay wet between the two faces.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, dear," said Kathleen; "let me go and tell the King
and Queen."</p>

<p>"The<hr>?"</p>

<p>"Your royal father and mother."</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>don't</em> mock me!" said the poor Princess. "You <em>know</em>
that was only a game, too, like<hr>"</p>

<p>"Like the bread and cheese," said Jimmy triumphantly. "I knew
<em>that</em> was!"</p>

<p>"But your dress and being asleep in the maze, and<hr>"</p>

<p>"Oh, I dressed up for fun, because every one's away at the fair,
and I put the clue just to make it all more real. I was playing
at Fair Rosamond first, and then I heard you talking in the maze,
and I thought what fun; and now I'm invisible, and I shall never
come right again, never &mdash;I know I shan't! It serves me right
for lying, but I didn't really think you'd believe it&mdash;not more
than half, that is," she added hastily, trying to be truthful.</p>

<p>"But if you're not the Princess, who <em>are</em> you?" asked
Kathleen, still embracing the unseen.</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;my aunt lives here," said the invisible Princess. "She
may be home any time. Oh, what shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she knows some charm<hr>"</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!" said the voice sharply; "she doesn't believe
in charms. She <em>would</em> be so vexed. Oh, I daren't let her
see me like this!" she added wildly. "And all of you here, too.
She'd be so dreadfully cross."</p>

<p>The beautiful magic castle that the children had believed in
now felt as though it were tumbling about their ears. All that
was left was the invisibleness of the Princess. But that, you
will own, was a good deal.</p>

<p>"I just said it," moaned the voice, "and it came true. I wish
I'd never played at magic &mdash;I wish I'd never played at anything
at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that," Gerald said kindly. "Let's go out into
the garden, near the lake, where it's cool, and we'll hold a solemn
council. You'll like that, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Kathleen suddenly, "the buckle; that makes magic
come undone!"</p>

<p>"It doesn't <em>really</em>," murmured the voice that seemed
to speak without lips. "I only just <em>said</em> that."</p>

<p>"You only 'just said' about the ring," said Gerald. "Anyhow,
let's try."</p>

<p>"Not <em>you</em>&mdash;<em>me</em>," said the voice. "You go down
to the Temple of Flora, by the lake. I'll go back to the jewel-room
by myself. Aunt might see you."</p>

<p>"She won't see <em>you</em>," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Don't rub it in," said Gerald. "Where <em>is</em> the Temple
of Flora?"</p>

<p>"That's the way," the voice said; "down those steps and along
the winding path through the shrubbery. You can't miss it. It's
white marble, with a statue goddess inside."</p>

<p>The three children went down to the white marble Temple of Flora
that stood close against the side of the little hill, and sat
down in its shadowy inside. It had arches all round except against
the hill behind the statue, and it was cool and restful.</p>

<p>They had not been there five minutes before the feet of a runner
sounded loud on the gravel. A shadow, very black and distinct,
fell on the white marble floor.</p>

<p>"Your shadow's not invisible anyhow," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Oh, bother my shadow!" the voice of the Princess replied. "We
left the key inside the door, and it's shut itself with the wind,
and it's a spring lock!"</p>

<p>There was a heartfelt pause.</p>

<p>Then Gerald said, in his most business-like manner:</p>

<p>"Sit down, Princess, and we'll have a thorough good palaver about
it."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," said Jimmy, "if we was to wake up and find
it was dreams."</p>

<p>"No such luck," said the voice.</p>

<p>"Well," said Gerald, "first of all, what's your name, and if
you're not a Princess, who are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm &mdash;I'm," said a voice broken with sobs, "I'm the&mdash;housekeeper's&mdash;niece&mdash;at&mdash;the&mdash;castle&mdash;and
my name's Mabel Prowse."</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I thought," said Jimmy, without a shadow
of truth, because how could he? The others were silent. It was
a moment full of agitation and confused ideas.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow," said Gerald, "you belong here."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<em>YOUR SHADOW'S NOT INVISIBLE, ANYHOW," SAID
JIMMY</em>.]</p>

<p>"Yes," said the voice, and it came from the floor, as though
its owner had flung herself down in the madness of despair. "Oh
yes, I belong here right enough, but what's the use of belonging
anywhere if you're invisible?"</p>
