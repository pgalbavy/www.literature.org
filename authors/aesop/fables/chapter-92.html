A FISHERMAN, engaged in his calling, made a very successful cast
and captured a great haul of fish.  He managed by a skillful
handling of his net to retain all the large fish and to draw them
to the shore; but he could not prevent the smaller fish from
falling back through the meshes of the net into the sea.
