<p>  Tis nature's worship&mdash;felt&mdash;confessed,   Far as the life which
warms the breast!   The sturdy savage midst his clan,   The rudest
portraiture of man,   In trackless woods and boundless plains,  
Where everlasting wildness reigns,   Owns the still throb&mdash;the
secret start-  The hidden impulse of the heart.   &mdash;<em>BYRON</em>.</p>

<p>The Huron, after his escape from the Shawnees, quickened his
pace, as we have stated, and went many a mile before he changed
his long, sidling trot into the less rapid walk.  When he did
this, it was upon the shore of a large creek, which ran through
one of the wildest and most desolate regions of Ohio.  In some
portions the banks were nothing more than a continuous swamp,
the creek spreading out like a lake among the reeds and undergrowth,
through which glided the enormous water-snake, frightened at the
apparition of a man in this lonely spot. The bright fish darted
hither and thither, their sides flashing up in the sunlight like
burnished silver.</p>

<p>The agile Indian sprung lightly from one turf of earth to another,
now balancing himself on a rotten stump or root, now walking the
length of some fallen tree, so decayed and water-eaten that it
mashed to a pulp beneath his feet, and then leaping to some other
precarious foothold, progressing rapidly all the time and with
such skill that he hardly wetted his moccasin.</p>

<p>While treading a log thus, which gave back a hollow sound, the
head of an immense rattlesnake protruded from a hole in the tree,
its tail giving the deadly alarm, as it continued issuing forth,
as if determined to dispute the passage of man in this desolate
place.  The fearless Huron scarcely halted.  While picking his
way through the swamp he had carried his rifle lightly balanced
in his left hand, and he now simply changed it to his right, grasping
it by the muzzle, so that the stock was before him.  He saw the
cavernous mouth of the snake opened to an amazing width; the thin
tongue, that resembled a tiny stream of blood; the small, glittering
eyes; the horn-like fangs, at the roots of which he well knew
were the sacks filled almost to bursting with the most deadly
of all poisons; the thin neck, swelling out until the scaly belly
of the loathsome reptile was visible.</p>

<p>The Huron continued steadily approaching the revolting thing. 
He was scarcely a yard distant when the neck of the snake arched
like a swan's, and the head was drawn far back to strike.  In
an instant the stock of his rifle swept over the top of the log
with the quickness of lightning.  There followed a sharp, cracking
noise, like the explosion of a percussion-cap, and the head of
the rattlesnake spun twenty feet or more out over the swamp. 
It struck the branch of a tree, and, dropping to the water, sunk
out of sight.  The headless body of the reptile now writhed and
doubled over itself, and smote the tree in the most horrible agony. 
Oonomoo walked quietly forward, and with his feet shoved it from
the log.  Still twisting and interlocking, it sunk down, down,
down into the clear spring-like waters until it could be seen
on the gravelly bottom, where its struggles continued as he passed
on.</p>

<p>Not affected by this occurrence, the Huron walked on as quietly
as before, his dark, restless eye seemingly flitting over every
object within his range of vision.  The character of the swamp
continued much the same.  A broad sheet of water, from nearly
every portion of which rose numerous trees, like thin, dark columns,
here and there twisted round and round, and, seemingly, smothered
by some luxuriant vine; others prostrate, the roots sunk out of
sight, and the trunk protruding upward, as if a giant had used
them for spears and hurled them into the swamp; shallow portions,
where the water was but a few inches deep, and then others, where
you could gaze down for twenty feet, as if you were looking through
liquid air.  These were the peculiarities of this singular spot
in the wilderness, through which the Huron was journeying.</p>

<p>He must have proceeded fully a half-mile into this water wilderness,
when he reached what might properly be termed the edge of the
swamp; that is, the one through which he had been making his way,
for there was still another a short distance from him.  The growth
of trees terminated almost in a mathematical line, and a lake
of water, something less than a quarter of a mile in width, stretched
out before him, perfectly clear of every obstruction.  The Indian
stood a long time, looking about in every direction.  What was
unusual, there was an expression of the most intense anxiety upon
his countenance.  Well might there be; for, sooner than to have
a human eye (whether it was that of the white or red man) to witness
the movements he was now about to make, he would have suffered
death at the stake a thousand times!</p>

<p>Apparently satisfied, he laid his rifle on the tree upon which
he had been standing, and then sprung out into the deeper water,
sinking like a stone from sight.  When he came to the surface,
he brought something with him, which proved to be a canoe.  With
this he swam to the tree, where he righted and turned the water
from it.  A paddle was secured in it.  Taking his seat, the canoe
went skimming like a swallow over the water toward the opposite
swamp.</p>

<p>Reaching this, he shot in among the trees, avoiding them with
as much ease and dexterity as would a bird on the wing.  Going
a hundred yards in this manner, he arose in his canoe and looked
around.  A shade of displeasure crossed his face, apparently of
disappointment at not discovering some person or object for whom
he was looking.  Waiting a moment, he placed his thumb on his
mouth, and gave utterance to a low, tremulous whistle, an exact
imitation of a bird often found in the American swamps.  A moment
later, there came a response exactly the same, except that it
sounded fainter and a considerable distance away. The moment it
caught the ear of the Huron, he reseated himself and folded his
arms in the attitude of patient waiting.</p>

<p>Scarce five minutes had elapsed, when the plash of another paddle
was heard, and a second canoe made its appearance, carefully approaching
that of the Huron.  In it was seated an Indian boy, not more than
twelve years of age, who handled it with a skill scarcely second
to that of his father, Oonomoo.</p>

<p>"Niniotan, my son, is late," said the latter, sternly, as the
boy came alongside.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Niniotan, my son, is late."]</p>

<p>"I was chasing a deer this morning, and was carried further in
the woods than I thought," meekly replied the boy.</p>

<p>"Has the Moravian missionary given Niniotan two tongues that
he should think Oonomoo speaks idle words?"</p>

<p>"Niniotan does not think so," said the son, in a humble voice
of thrilling sweetness.</p>

<p>"Oonomoo said when the sun was over yonder tree-top he would
be waiting for his boy Niniotan.  He waited, but Niniotan was
not here."</p>

<p>The son of the Huron warrior bowed his head as if he had nothing
to say to the merited rebuke.  The father took his seat in the
canoe of his son, who carried him rapidly forward through the
swamp, for perhaps a quarter of a mile further, when the ground
became so solid that they landed and walked upon it.  The grass
was green and luxuriant, the trees stood close together, and in
some places the shrubbery seemed almost impenetrable.  But Niniotan
never hesitated.  The way was perfectly familiar.  A rabbit could
scarcely have glided through the wood with more dexterity than
did he and his father.</p>

<p>Finally the two reached what appeared to be a large mound of
earth, covered over with rank grass and brilliant flowers.  On
one side was a perfect bank of bushes, so that the mound could
not be seen until it was closely approached.  A Shawnee Indian
might have encamped beside it, without once having his suspicion
awakened in regard to its nature. This was the retreat and home
of Oonomoo, the friendly Huron, where his wife, Fluellina, and
son, Niniotan, dwelt, which was regularly visited by him, and
where he frequently spent days, enjoying the sweets of home. 
No living person besides these three knew of its existence.  It
stood upon this vast island in the midst of this swamp, almost
inaccessible to approach, and where no one would have dreamed
of looking for the dwelling place of a human being.  The surrounding
waters were as cold and clear as crystal, and were swarming with
the choicest fish.  Abundance of game was upon the land, and,
what might seem curious, considering the location of the island,
its air possessed an extraordinary degree of salubrity.</p>

<p>The mound was but a mere shell, the interior of which was lined
with luxurious furs and skins, and furnished with every convenience
and comfort that the fancy of a warrior's wife might covet.  Within,
too, were numerous presents, such as rifles, knives, pistols,
beads and picture-books which had been given Oonomoo by his numerous
white friends.  In addition there was a magnificent gold watch&mdash;a
gift from a wealthy lady, whose life the Huron had saved several
years before. Hearing that he had a young wife, she sent the present
to her, and it had hung within their "wigwam" ever since.  Its
use was understood, and it was regularly wound and attended to
with great care.</p>

<p>Fluellina, the wife of Oonomoo, was also a Huron, who had been
educated at one of the Moravian missionary stations in the West,
and was a professing Christian.  She was a mild, dove-eyed creature,
a number of years younger than her husband, whom she loved almost
to adoration, and for whom she would not have hesitated to lay
down her life at any moment.  She had had another child&mdash;a boy,
born two years before Niniotan, but he had died when but six years
of age, and was buried in the clear depths of the water which
surrounded his home.</p>

<p>Regularly every month, Fluellina, accompanied by her son, visited
a Moravian missionary who dwelt with his family on the site of
the once flourishing station of Gnadenhutten, where, in 1782,
was enacted one of the darkest episodes in American history. 
It was here the infamous monster, Colonel Williamson, murdered
the one hundred Moravian Indians&mdash;a crime for which it seems a
just God would have smitten him and his followers to the earth. 
Here this faithful Huron woman and her son received instruction
in holy things from the aged missionary&mdash;a white man who alone
knew the relation which she bore to the famous Huron, Oonomoo,
and who never betrayed it to his dying day.  By this means, her
regular visits were rendered safe and free from the annoyance
of being watched&mdash;an exemption she never could have had, had any
one else suspected the truth.</p>

<p>Fluellina succeeded in inducing her husband to visit this missionary
on several occasions, when he proved an attentive listener to
the aged disciple of God.  He took in every doctrine and subscribed
to every truth except one&mdash;that of loving his enemies.  He believed
he never could love the Shawnees&mdash;they who had first caused his
father to be broken of his chiefdom, and then had murdered his
mother.  He had sworn eternal hatred against them, and in the
interior of his lodge hung such an incredible number of their
scalps that we decline to name it&mdash;knowing that we should be suspected
of trifling with the credulity of our readers.  He had never taken
the scalp of a white man, and would promise never to harm any
being except the Shawnees; but, toward them his feelings must
be those of the deadliest enmity.</p>

<p>The sublime truths of the great Book of books, its glorious promises,
and its awful mysteries, thrilled the soul of the Huron to its
center, and many a time when wandering alone through the great,
solemn forests, he felt his spirit expanding within him, until
his eyes overflowed, and he, the mighty, scarred warrior, wept
like a child.  The sweet instruction, too, of the gentle Fluellina
had not been lost entirely upon him.  It was owing to these that
for a year he had not taken the scalp of a Shawnee, though he
had been sorely tempted and had slain more than one.  He could
not yet bring himself to the point of letting them go free altogether.</p>

<p>With this somewhat lengthy parenthesis, we will now return to
the present visit of the Huron to his island home.</p>

<p>Oonomoo was about to pass into the interior of the lodge, when
a light exclamation caught his ear.  As he turned his head, Fluellina
came bounding to his arms.  However stoical and indifferent the
North American Indian may appear in the presence of his companions
or of white men, it is a mistake to suppose that he is wanting
either in the ordinary affections of humanity, or in those little
demonstrations of love so peculiar to our own race.  Deep in the
woods, when alone with their families, they throw off restraint
and are warriors no more&mdash;but <em>men</em>.  The little child
is dandled on the knee, or sported with upon the grass, and the
proud mother receives her share of her husband's caresses.  Great
as may be the glory of the savage in the hunt and chase, his happiness
in the bosom of his own family is unsurpassed by any other enjoyment
which ever falls to his lot.</p>

<p>Fluellina received the embrace of her husband with a radiant
countenance, and she seemed overflowing with joy as she looked
up in his own glowing face.  Taking her fondly by the hand, he
led her a few yards away, where he seated her upon a half-imbedded
rock and placed himself beside her.  A glance at the two would
have shown that there was no considerable difference in their
ages.  The wife could not have been over thirty at the most, and
she looked much younger, while the husband was perhaps thirty-five. 
His square, massive chest was covered with scars&mdash;eloquent evidences
of his bravery, for he had never received a wound in the back. 
His face, usually so stern and dignified, was now softened, and
the bright, metallic glitter of eye was changed to the sparkle
of gladness.</p>

<p>The handsome, symmetrical arms of Fluellina were bare to the
shoulder, and Oonomoo held one in his broad palm, closing and
opening upon the plump flesh and delicate muscle, with as much
admiration as though he were still her young and ardent lover. 
They sat thus, gazing into each other's face for several moments
without speaking, so full seemed their hearts.  Finally Oonomoo
seated himself upon the ground at the feet of Fluellina and leaned
his head over upon her lap.  This was what she wished, and she
had maneuvered in that delicate manner peculiar to her sex, by
which the desire of the lover is awakened without his suspecting
the true cause.</p>

<p>Unfastening the bindings of his hair, she parted it carefully
and drew her fingers slowly through and through it until it glistened
like satin.  She did not speak, for she had no desire to disturb
the languor which she knew it cast over her husband.  As his head
drooped, she sustained it and gradually ceased, until he slept.</p>

<p>Oonomoo awoke in a short time, and reseated himself by the side
of his wife.</p>

<p>"Where is Niniotan?" he asked, looking around him.</p>

<p>"He is dressing the meat of the deer which he slew this morning. 
Shall I call him?"</p>

<p>"No, I am not yet tired of my Fluellina."</p>

<p>The happy wife replied by placing her warm cheek against his,
and holding it there a moment.</p>

<p>"Oonomoo has no wounds upon him," said she, raising her head
and looking at his breast and shoulders.</p>

<p>"But he has been in danger."</p>

<p>"No scalps hang at his girdle."</p>

<p>"<em>And none shall ever hang there again.</em>"</p>

<p>"Not the scalp of the Shawnee?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the Huron, in a voice as deep and solemn as a distant
peal of thunder.</p>

<p>Fluellina looked at her husband a moment, with her face lit up
by a strange expression.  Then, as she read the determination
impressed upon his countenance, and knew the sacredness with which
he regarded his pledged word, she sunk down on her knees, and
clasping her hands, turned her dark, soulful eyes to heaven and
uttered the one exclamation:</p>

<p>"Great Spirit, I thank thee!"</p>

<p>The kneeling Indian woman, her face radiant with a holy happiness,
the stern warrior, his dark countenance lighted up as he gazed
down upon her as if the long obscured sun had once more struggled
from behind the clouds&mdash;these two silent figures in the green
wood of their island home formed a picture touchingly beautiful
and sublime.</p>

<p>Who can picture the glory that illuminated the soul of the Huron
warrior, the divine bliss that went thrilling through his very
being, as he uttered this vow, and felt within him the consciousness
that never, never again would he be overcome by the temptation
to tear the scalp from the head of his enemy, the vengeful Shawnee.</p>

<p>"When has Fluellina seen the Moravian missionary?" he asked,
as she reseated herself beside him.</p>

<p>"But a short time since.  He inquired of Oonomoo."</p>

<p>"Oonomoo will visit him soon."</p>

<p>"Can he not go with Fluellina to-day?"</p>

<p>"When the sun is yonder," replied the Huron, pointing to a place
which it would reach in about half an hour, "he must go, and when
the sun sinks in the west, he must be many miles from here."</p>

<p>"When will he return again?"</p>

<p>"He cannot tell.  He goes to befriend the white man and maid
who is in the hands of the Shawnees."</p>

<p>"Fluellina will wait and will pray for Oonomoo and for them."</p>

<p>"Oonomoo will pray for himself, and his arm will be strong, for
he fights none but warriors."</p>

<p>"And Niniotan will grow up like him; he will be a brave warrior
who, I pray, will take no scalp from the head of his foe."</p>

<p>"What think the missionary of Niniotan?"</p>

<p>"He finds that the blood of Oonomoo flows strong in his veins. 
His eye burns, and his breast pants when he hears of the great
deeds his father has performed, and he prays that he may go with
him upon the war-path."</p>

<p>"He shall accompany him shortly.  He can aim the rifle, and his
feet are like those of the deer.  He shall be a man whose name
shall make the Shawnee warriors tremble in their lodges."</p>

<p>"Shall he be a merciful warrior?" asked Fluellina, looking up
in the face of the Huron.</p>

<p>"Like his father, shall he be.  He shall slay none but men in
rightful combat, and no scalp shall ever adorn his lodge.  He
must drink in the words of the Moravian missionary."</p>

<p>"He does, but his heart is young.  He will be valiant and merciful,
but he longs to emulate the deeds of Oonomoo&mdash;his father."</p>

<p>"I will teach him to emulate what Oonomoo will do, not what he
has done."</p>

<p>"He counts the scalps that hang in our lodge, and wonders why
they do not increase.  He gazes long and often upon those which
you tore years ago from the heads of the two chiefs, and I know
he burns to gain a trophy for himself."</p>

<p>"Has Fluellina the choicest food these forests can afford?"</p>

<p>"The eye of Niniotan is sure, and his mother never wants."</p>

<p>"He must not wander from the island, else his young arm may be
overpowered by the Shawnees or Miamis.  They would know he was
the son of Oonomoo, and through the son murder the father and
mother."</p>

<p>"Fluellina loves but three &mdash;Oonomoo, Niniotan, and," she
added, reverentially raising her eyes to heaven, "the Great Spirit
who is so kind to her."</p>

<p>"And Oonomoo loves him," added the Huron, in his deep, bass voice. 
"In the hunting-grounds beyond the sun, he and Fluellina and Niniotan
will again live together on some green island in the forest, where
the buffalo and deer wander in bands of thousands."</p>

<p>"And where Delaware, Mingo, Chippewa, Miami, Ottawa, Pottawatomie,
Shawnee, Huron, and the white man shall be brothers, and war against
each other no more."</p>

<p>The Huron made no reply, for the words of his wife had awakened
a train of reflection to which he had been a stranger.  The thought
that all the Indians, every tribe that had lived since the foundation
of the world&mdash;those who were now the most implacable enemies to
each other, the French, English and Americans&mdash;the thought of
these living together in the Spirit Land in perfect brotherhood
and good-will, was too startling for him to accept until Fluellina
again spoke:</p>

<p>"It is only the <em>good</em> Delaware, Mingo, Chippewa, Miami,
Ottawa, Pottawatomie, Shawnee, Huron, and white man that shall
live there."</p>

<p>It was all plain now to the simple-minded Indian, and he understood
and believed.  He sat a few moments, as if ruminating upon this
new theme, and then said gently to his wife:</p>

<p>"Read out of Good Book to Oonomoo."</p>

<p>Fluellina drew a small Bible from her bosom, one that she always
carried with her, and opening at the Revelations, commenced to
read in a clear, sweet and distinct voice.  The inspired grandeur,
sublime truths and glorious descriptions of that most wonderful
of all books thrilled her soul to its center with emotions unutterable;
and she knew that the same effect, though perhaps in a lesser
degree, was produced upon her husband.  The particular portion
was the twenty-first chapter, whose meaning the Moravian missionary
had frequently explained to her, and it was these verses in particular
upon which she frequently dwelt with such awed rapture:</p>

<p>"'And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain,
and showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out
of heaven from God,</p>

<p>"'Having the glory of God; and her light was like unto a stone
most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;</p>

<p>"'And had a wall, great and high, and had twelve gates, and at
the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are
the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>

<p>"'And the building of the wall of it was of jasper; and the city
was pure gold, like unto clear glass.</p>

<p>"'And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished
with all manner of precious stones.  The first foundation was
jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth,
an emerald;</p>

<p>"'The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite;
the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus;
the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.</p>

<p>"'And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate
was of one pearl; and the street of the city was pure gold, as
it were transparent glass.</p>

<p>"'And I saw no temple therein; for the Lord God Almighty and
the Lamb are the temple of it.</p>

<p>"'And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day; for there
shall be no night there.'"</p>

<p>The dim, vague glimpses afforded him from this and other portions
of the book of the awful mysteries of the Last Day, the New Jerusalem,
and the great white Throne, threw a spell over him which remained
long after the words of the reader had ceased.  Full ten minutes,
he sat, after the volume had been closed; then raising his head,
said:</p>

<p>"The sun is getting in the western sky, and Oonomoo must depart."</p>

<p>The wife did not seek to detain her husband.  The wife of an
Indian warrior never does.  She merely walked beside him, while
he signaled for his son to approach.  He had scarce uttered the
call, when Niniotan came bounding from the wood eager to obey
the slightest wish of his father.  Seeing from his actions that
he was about to depart, he lingered behind until his mother had
bidden him good-by, and paused; then he leaped ahead, leading
the way as before.</p>

<p>The canoe reached, Oonomoo stepped within it, and Niniotan paddled
him out among the trees until he came to where his own canoe was
moored, into which the Huron stepped.  As he was about to dip
the paddle, he said: "Let Niniotan wait until Oonomoo returns,
and he shall go with him upon the next war-path."</p>

<p>No pen can picture the glowing happiness that lit up the features
of the boy at hearing these words.  His dark eyes fairly danced,
and he seemed unable to control his joy.  His whole frame quivered,
and he dipped his own paddle into the water, he bent it almost
to breaking. Without noticing him further, Oonomoo sent his canoe
spinning among the trees, and was soon in the broad sheet of water,
crossing which, he reached the spot where he had brought up his
boat.  Stepping out upon the log, he secured the paddle to it,
and then turning it over, filled it with water.  It slowly sunk
until it could be seen resting upon the bottom, when he sprung
from the tree and commenced his departure from the swamp in the
same manner that he had entered it.</p>

<p>Once again in the grand old forest, with the mossy carpet beneath
his feet, and the magnificent arches over his head, through which
the breezes came like the cool breath of the ocean, the Huron
struck into his peculiar rapid trot, which was continued until
sunset, by which time he reached the clearing.  Approaching it
in his usual cautious manner, he saw the Shawnees consulting together,
and at the first glance understood the peril of his friends. 
We have related the measures which he took to save them, and shown
how successful they were.</p>
