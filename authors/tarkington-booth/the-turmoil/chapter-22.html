<p>   There seems to be another curious thing about Love [Bibbs
wrote].    Love is blind while it lives and only opens its eyes
and becomes    very wide awake when it dies.  Let it alone until
then.</p>

<p>   You cannot reason with love or with any other passion.  The
wise    will not wish for love&mdash;nor for ambition.  These are passions   
and bring others in their train&mdash;hatreds and jealousies&mdash;all   
blind.  Friendship and a quiet heart for the wise.</p>

<p>   What a turbulence is love!  It is dangerous for a blind thing
to    be turbulent; there are precipices in life.  One would not
cross    a mountain-pass with a thick cloth over his eyes.  Lovers
do.    Friendship walks gently and with open eyes.</p>

<p>   To walk to church with a friend!  To sit beside her there! 
To rise    when she rises, and to touch with one's thumb and fingers
the other    half of the hymn-book that she holds!  What lover,
with his fierce    ways, could know this transcendent happiness?</p>

<p>   Friendship brings everything that heaven could bring.  There
is no    labor that cannot become a living rapture if you know
that a friend    is thinking of you as you labor.  So you sing
at your work.  For    the work is part of the thoughts of your
friend; so you love it!</p>

<p>   Love is demanding and claiming and insistent.  Friendship
is all    kindness&mdash;it makes the world glorious with kindness. 
What color    you see when you walk with a friend!  You see that
the gray sky    is brilliant and shimmering; you see that the
smoke has warm    browns and is marvelously sculptured&mdash;the air
becomes iridescent.    You see the gold in brown hair.  Light
floods everything.</p>

<p>   When you walk to church with a friend you know that life can
give    you nothing richer.  You pray that there will be no change
in    anything for ever.</p>

<p>   What an adorable thing it is to discover a little foible in
your    friend, a bit of vanity that gives you one thing more
about her to    adore!  On a cold morning she will perhaps walk
to church with you    without her furs, and she will blush and
return an evasive answer    when you ask her why she does not
wear them.  You will say no    more, because you understand. 
She looks beautiful in her furs;    you love their darkness against
her cheek; but you comprehend that    they conceal the loveliness
of her throat and the fine line of her    chin, and that she also
has comprehended this, and, wishing to    look still more bewitching,
discards her furs at the risk of    taking cold.  So you hold
your peace, and try to look as if you    had not thought it out.</p>

<p>   This theory is satisfactory except that it does not account
for    the absence of the muff.  Ah, well, there must always be
a mystery    somewhere!  Mystery is a part of enchantment.</p>

<p>   Manual labor is best.  Your heart can sing and your mind can
dream    while your hands are working.  You could not have a singing
heart    and a dreaming mind all day if you had to scheme out
dollars,    or if you had to add columns of figures.  Those things
take your    attention.  You cannot be thinking of your friend
while you write    letters beginning "Yours of the 17th inst.
rec'd and contents    duly noted."  But to work with your hands
all day, thinking and    singing, and then, after nightfall, to
hear the ineffable kindness    of your friend's greeting&mdash;always
there&mdash;for you!  Who would wake    from such a dream as this?</p>

<p>   Dawn and the sea&mdash;music in moonlit gardens&mdash;nightingales   
serenading through almond-groves in bloom&mdash;what could bring such   
things into the city's turmoil?  Yet they are here, and roses   
blossom in the soot.  That is what it means not to be alone!   
That is what a friend gives you!</p>

<p>Having thus demonstrated that he was about twenty-five and had
formed a somewhat indefinite definition of friendship, but one
entirely his own (and perhaps Mary's) Bibbs went to bed, and was
the only Sheridan to sleep soundly through the night and to wake
at dawn with a light heart.</p>

<p>His cheerfulness was vaguely diminished by the troublous state
of affairs of his family. He had recognized his condition when
he wrote, "Who would wake from such a dream as this?" Bibbs was
a sympathetic person, easily touched, but he was indeed living
in a dream, and all things outside of it were veiled and remote&mdash;for
that is the way of youth in a dream. And Bibbs, who had never
before been of any age, either old or young, had come to his youth
at last.</p>

<p>He went whistling from the house before even his father had come
down-stairs. There was a fog outdoors, saturated with a fine powder
of soot, and though Bibbs noticed absently the dim shape of an
automobile at the curb before Roscoe's house, he did not recognize
it as Dr. Gurney's, but went cheerily on his way through the dingy
mist. And when he was once more installed beside his faithful
zinc-eater he whistled and sang to it, as other workmen did to
their own machines sometimes, when things went well. His comrades
in the shop glanced at him amusedly now and then. They liked him,
and he ate his lunch at noon with a group of Socialists who approved
of his ideas and talked of electing him to their association.</p>

<p>The short days of the year had come, and it was dark before the
whistles blew. When the signal came, Bibbs went to the office,
where he divested himself of his overalls&mdash;his single divergence
from the routine of his fellow-workmen&mdash;and after that he used
soap and water copiously. This was his transformation scene: he
passed into the office a rather frail young working-man noticeably
begrimed, and passed out of it to the pavement a cheerfully pre-occupied
sample of gentry, fastidious to the point of elegance.</p>

<p>The sidewalk was crowded with the bearers of dinner-pails, men
and boys and women and girls from the work-rooms that closed at
five. Many hurried and some loitered; they went both east and
west, jostling one another, and Bibbs, turning his face homeward,
was forced to go slowly.</p>

<p>Coming toward him, as slowly, through the crowd, a tall girl
caught sight of his long, thin figure and stood still until he
had almost passed her, for in the thick crowd and the thicker
gloom he did not recognize her, though his shoulder actually touched
hers. He would have gone by, but she laughed delightedly; and
he stopped short, startled. Two boys, one chasing the other, swept
between them, and Bibbs stood still, peering about him in deep
perplexity. She leaned toward him.</p>

<p>"I knew <em>YOU!" </em>she said.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" cried Bibbs. "I thought it was your voice coming
out of a star!"</p>

<p>"There's only smoke overhead," said Mary, and laughed again.
"There aren't any stars."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, there were&mdash;when you laughed!"</p>

<p>She took his arm, and they went on. "I've come to walk home with
you, Bibbs. I wanted to."</p>

<p>"But were you here in the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the dark? Yes! Waiting? Yes!"</p>

<p>Bibbs was radiant; he felt suffocated with happiness. He began
to scold her.</p>

<p>"But it's not safe, and I'm not worth it. You shouldn't have&mdash;you
ought to know better. What did&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I only waited about twelve seconds," she laughed. "I'd just
got here."</p>

<p>"But to come all this way and to this part of town in the dark,
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was in this part of town already," she said. "At least, I
was only seven or eight blocks away, and it was dark when I came
out, and I'd have had to go home alone&mdash;and I preferred going
home with you."</p>

<p>"It's pretty beautiful for me," said Bibbs, with a deep breath.
"You'll never know what it was to hear your laugh in the darkness&mdash;and
then to&mdash;to see you standing there! Oh, it was like&mdash;it was like&mdash;how
can I <em>TELL </em>you what it was like?" They had passed beyond
the crowd now, and a crossing-lamp shone upon them, which revealed
the fact that again she was without her furs. Here was a puzzle.
Why did that adorable little vanity of hers bring her out without
them in the <em>DARK? </em>But of course she had gone out long
before dark. For undefinable reasons this explanation was not
quite satisfactory; however, allowing it to stand, his solicitude
for her took another turn. "I think you ought to have a car," 
he said, "especially when you want to be out after dark. You need
one in winter, anyhow. Have you ever asked your father for one?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mary. "I don't think I'd care for one particularly."</p>

<p>"I wish you would." Bibbs's tone was earnest and troubled. "I
think in winter you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," she interrupted, lightly. "I don't need&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But my mother tried to insist on sending one over here every
afternoon for me. I wouldn't let her, because I like the walk,
but a girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A girl likes to walk, too," said Mary. "Let me tell you where
I've been this afternoon and how I happened to be near enough
to make you take me home. I've been to see a little old man who
makes pictures of the smoke. He has a sort of warehouse for a
studio, and he lives there with his mother and his wife and their
seven children, and he's gloriously happy. I'd seen one of his
pictures at an exhibition, and I wanted to see more of them, so
he showed them to me. He has almost everthing he ever painted;
I don't suppose he's sold more than four or five pictures in his
life. He gives drawing-lessons to keep alive."</p>

<p>"How do you mean he paints the smoke?" Bibbs asked.</p>

<p>"Literally. He paints from his studio window and from the street&mdash;anywhere.
He just paints what's around him&mdash;and it's beautiful."</p>

<p>"The smoke?"</p>

<p>"Wonderful! He sees the sky through it, somehow. He does the
ugly roofs of cheap houses through a haze of smoke, and he does
smoky sunsets and smoky sunrises, and he has other things with
the heavy, solid, slow columns of smoke going far out and growing
more ethereal and mixing with the hazy light in the distance;
and he has others with the broken sky-line of down-town, all misted
with the smoke and puffs and jets of vapor that have colors like
an orchard in mid-April. I'm going to take you there some Sunday
afternoon, Bibbs."</p>

<p>"You're showing me the town," he said. "I didn't know what was
in it at all."</p>

<p>"There are workers in beauty here," she told him, gently. "There
are other painters more prosperous than my friend. There are all
sorts of things."</p>

<p>"I didn't know."</p>

<p>"No. Since the town began growing so great that it called itself
'greater,' one could live here all one's life and know only the
side of it that shows."</p>

<p>"The beauty-workers seem buried very deep," said Bibbs. "And
I imagine that your friend who makes the smoke beautiful must
be buried deepest of all. My father loves the smoke, but I can't
imagine his buying one of your friend's pictures. He'd buy the
'Bay of Naples,' but he wouldn't get one of those. He'd think
smoke in a picture was horrible&mdash;unless he could use it for an
advertisement."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, thoughtfully. "And really he's the town. They
<em>ARE </em>buried pretty deep, it seems, sometimes, Bibbs."</p>

<p>"And yet it's all wonderful," he said. "It's wonderful to me."</p>

<p>"You mean the town is wonderful to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, because everything is, since you called me your friend.
The city is only a rumble on the horizon for me. It can't come
any closer than the horizon so long as you let me see you standing
by my old zinc-eater all day long, helping me. Mary&mdash;" He stopped
with a gasp. "That's the first time I've called you 'Mary'!"</p>

<p>"Yes." She laughed, a little tremuously. "Though I wanted you
to!"</p>

<p>"I said it without thinking. It must be because you came there
to walk home with me. That must be it."</p>

<p>"Women like to have things said," Mary informed him, her tremulous
laughter continuing. "Were you glad I came for you?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not 'glad.' I felt as if I were being carried straight up
and up and up&mdash;over the clouds. I feel like that still. I think
I'm that way most of the time. I wonder what I was like before
I knew you. The person I was then seems to have been somebody
else, not Bibbs Sheridan at all. It seems long, long ago. I was
gloomy and sickly&mdash;somebody else&mdash;somebody I don't understand
now, a coward afraid of shadows&mdash;afraid of things that didn't
exist&mdash;afraid of my old zinc-eater! And now I'm only afraid of
what might change anything."</p>

<p>She was silent a moment, and then, "You're happy, Bibbs?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Ah, don't you see?" he cried. "I want it to last for a thousand,
thousand years, just as it is! You've made me so rich, I'm a miser.
I wouldn't have one thing different&mdash;nothing, nothing!"</p>

<p>"Dear Bibbs!" she said, and laughed happily.</p>
