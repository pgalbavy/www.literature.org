<p>Denham had accused Katharine Hilbery of belonging to one of the
most distinguished families in England, and if any one will take
the trouble to consult Mr. Galton’s "Hereditary Genius," he will
find that this assertion is not far from the truth. The Alardyces,
the Hilberys, the Millingtons, and the Otways seem to prove that
intellect is a possession which can be tossed from one member
of a certain group to another almost indefinitely, and with apparent
certainty that the brilliant gift will be safely caught and held
by nine out of ten of the privileged race. They had been conspicuous
judges and admirals, lawyers and servants of the State for some
years before the richness of the soil culminated in the rarest
flower that any family can boast, a great writer, a poet eminent
among the poets of England, a Richard Alardyce; and having produced
him, they proved once more the amazing virtues of their race by
proceeding unconcernedly again with their usual task of breeding
distinguished men. They had sailed with Sir John Franklin to the
North Pole, and ridden with Havelock to the Relief of Lucknow,
and when they were not lighthouses firmly based on rock for the
guidance of their generation, they were steady, serviceable candles,
illuminating the ordinary chambers of daily life. Whatever profession
you looked at, there was a Warburton or an Alardyce, a Millington
or a Hilbery somewhere in authority and prominence.</p>

<p>It may be said, indeed, that English society being what it is,
no very great merit is required, once you bear a well-known name,
to put you into a position where it is easier on the whole to
be eminent than obscure. And if this is true of the sons, even
the daughters, even in the nineteenth century, are apt to become
people of importance&mdash;philanthropists and educationalists if they
are spinsters, and the wives of distinguished men if they marry.
It is true that there were several lamentable exceptions to this
rule in the Alardyce group, which seems to indicate that the cadets
of such houses go more rapidly to the bad than the children of
ordinary fathers and mothers, as if it were somehow a relief to
them. But, on the whole, in these first years of the twentieth
century, the Alardyces and their relations were keeping their
heads well above water. One finds them at the tops of professions,
with letters after their names; they sit in luxurious public offices,
with private secretaries attached to them; they write solid books
in dark covers, issued by the presses of the two great universities,
and when one of them dies the chances are that another of them
writes his biography.</p>

<p>Now the source of this nobility was, of course, the poet, and
his immediate descendants, therefore, were invested with greater
luster than the collateral branches. Mrs. Hilbery, in virtue of
her position as the only child of the poet, was spiritually the
head of the family, and Katharine, her daughter, had some superior
rank among all the cousins and connections, the more so because
she was an only child. The Alardyces had married and intermarried,
and their offspring were generally profuse, and had a way of meeting
regularly in each other’s houses for meals and family celebrations
which had acquired a semi-sacred character, and were as regularly
observed as days of feasting and fasting in the Church.</p>

<p>In times gone by, Mrs. Hilbery had known all the poets, all the
novelists, all the beautiful women and distinguished men of her
time. These being now either dead or secluded in their infirm
glory, she made her house a meeting-place for her own relations,
to whom she would lament the passing of the great days of the
nineteenth century, when every department of letters and art was
represented in England by two or three illustrious names. Where
are their successors? she would ask, and the absence of any poet
or painter or novelist of the true caliber at the present day
was a text upon which she liked to ruminate, in a sunset mood
of benignant reminiscence, which it would have been hard to disturb
had there been need. But she was far from visiting their inferiority
upon the younger generation. She welcomed them very heartily to
her house, told them her stories, gave them sovereigns and ices
and good advice, and weaved round them romances which had generally
no likeness to the truth.</p>

<p>The quality of her birth oozed into Katharine’s consciousness
from a dozen different sources as soon as she was able to perceive
anything. Above her nursery fireplace hung a photograph of her
grandfather’s tomb in Poets’ Corner, and she was told in one of
those moments of grown-up confidence which are so tremendously
impressive to the child’s mind, that he was buried there because
he was a "good and great man." Later, on an anniversary, she was
taken by her mother through the fog in a hansom cab, and given
a large bunch of bright, sweet-scented flowers to lay upon his
tomb. The candles in the church, the singing and the booming of
the organ, were all, she thought, in his honor. Again and again
she was brought down into the drawing-room to receive the blessing
of some awful distinguished old man, who sat, even to her childish
eye, somewhat apart, all gathered together and clutching a stick,
unlike an ordinary visitor in her father’s own arm-chair, and
her father himself was there, unlike himself, too, a little excited
and very polite. These formidable old creatures used to take her
in their arms, look very keenly in her eyes, and then to bless
her, and tell her that she must mind and be a good girl, or detect
a look in her face something like Richard’s as a small boy. That
drew down upon her her mother’s fervent embrace, and she was sent
back to the nursery very proud, and with a mysterious sense of
an important and unexplained state of things, which time, by degrees,
unveiled to her.</p>

<p>There were always visitors&mdash;uncles and aunts and cousins "from
India,"  to be reverenced for their relationship alone, and others
of the solitary and formidable class, whom she was enjoined by
her parents to "remember all your life." By these means, and from
hearing constant talk of great men and their works, her earliest
conceptions of the world included an august circle of beings to
whom she gave the names of Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Shelley,
and so on, who were, for some reason, much more nearly akin to
the Hilberys than to other people. They made a kind of boundary
to her vision of life, and played a considerable part in determining
her scale of good and bad in her own small affairs. Her descent
from one of these gods was no surprise to her, but matter for
satisfaction, until, as the years wore on, the privileges of her
lot were taken for granted, and certain drawbacks made themselves
very manifest. Perhaps it is a little depressing to inherit not
lands but an example of intellectual and spiritual virtue; perhaps
the conclusiveness of a great ancestor is a little discouraging
to those who run the risk of comparison with him. It seems as
if, having flowered so splendidly, nothing now remained possible
but a steady growth of good, green stalk and leaf. For these reasons,
and for others, Katharine had her moments of despondency. The
glorious past, in which men and women grew to unexampled size,
intruded too much upon the present, and dwarfed it too consistently,
to be altogether encouraging to one forced to make her experiment
in living when the great age was dead.</p>

<p>She was drawn to dwell upon these matters more than was natural,
in the first place owing to her mother’s absorption in them, and
in the second because a great part of her time was spent in imagination
with the dead, since she was helping her mother to produce a life
of the great poet. When Katharine was seventeen or eighteen&mdash;that
is to say, some ten years ago&mdash;her mother had enthusiastically
announced that now, with a daughter to help her, the biography
would soon be published. Notices to this effect found their way
into the literary papers, and for some time Katharine worked with
a sense of great pride and achievement.</p>

<p>Lately, however, it had seemed to her that they were making no
way at all, and this was the more tantalizing because no one with
the ghost of a literary temperament could doubt but that they
had materials for one of the greatest biographies that has ever
been written. Shelves and boxes bulged with the precious stuff.
The most private lives of the most interesting people lay furled
in yellow bundles of close-written manuscript. In addition to
this Mrs. Hilbery had in her own head as bright a vision of that
time as now remained to the living, and could give those flashes
and thrills to the old words which gave them almost the substance
of flesh. She had no difficulty in writing, and covered a page
every morning as instinctively as a thrush sings, but nevertheless,
with all this to urge and inspire, and the most devout intention
to accomplish the work, the book still remained unwritten. Papers
accumulated without much furthering their task, and in dull moments
Katharine had her doubts whether they would ever produce anything
at all fit to lay before the public. Where did the difficulty
lie? Not in their materials, alas! nor in their ambitions, but
in something more profound, in her own inaptitude, and above all,
in her mother’s temperament. Katharine would calculate that she
had never known her write for more than ten minutes at a time.
Ideas came to her chiefly when she was in motion. She liked to
perambulate the room with a duster in her hand, with which she
stopped to polish the backs of already lustrous books, musing
and romancing as she did so. Suddenly the right phrase or the
penetrating point of view would suggest itself, and she would
drop her duster and write ecstatically for a few breathless moments;
and then the mood would pass away, and the duster would be sought
for, and the old books polished again. These spells of inspiration
never burnt steadily, but flickered over the gigantic mass of
the subject as capriciously as a will-o’-the-wisp, lighting now
on this point, now on that. It was as much as Katharine could
do to keep the pages of her mother’s manuscript in order, but
to sort them so that the sixteenth year of Richard Alardyce’s
life succeeded the fifteenth was beyond her skill. And yet they
were so brilliant, these paragraphs, so nobly phrased, so lightning-like
in their illumination, that the dead seemed to crowd the very
room. Read continuously, they produced a sort of vertigo, and
set her asking herself in despair what on earth she was to do
with them? Her mother refused, also, to face the radical questions
of what to leave in and what to leave out. She could not decide
how far the public was to be told the truth about the poet’s separation
from his wife. She drafted passages to suit either case, and then
liked each so well that she could not decide upon the rejection
of either.</p>

<p>But the book must be written. It was a duty that they owed the
world, and to Katharine, at least, it meant more than that, for
if they could not between them get this one book accomplished
they had no right to their privileged position. Their increment
became yearly more and more unearned. Besides, it must be established
indisputably that her grandfather was a very great man.</p>

<p>By the time she was twenty-seven, these thoughts had become very
familiar to her. They trod their way through her mind as she sat
opposite her mother of a morning at a table heaped with bundles
of old letters and well supplied with pencils, scissors, bottles
of gum, india-rubber bands, large envelopes, and other appliances
for the manufacture of books. Shortly before Ralph Denham’s visit,
Katharine had resolved to try the effect of strict rules upon
her mother’s habits of literary composition. They were to be seated
at their tables every morning at ten o’clock, with a clean-swept
morning of empty, secluded hours before them. They were to keep
their eyes fast upon the paper, and nothing was to tempt them
to speech, save at the stroke of the hour when ten minutes for
relaxation were to be allowed them. If these rules were observed
for a year, she made out on a sheet of paper that the completion
of the book was certain, and she laid her scheme before her mother
with a feeling that much of the task was already accomplished.
Mrs. Hilbery examined the sheet of paper very carefully. Then
she clapped her hands and exclaimed enthusiastically:</p>

<p>"Well done, Katharine! What a wonderful head for business you’ve
got! Now I shall keep this before me, and every day I shall make
a little mark in my pocketbook, and on the last day of all&mdash;let
me think, what shall we do to celebrate the last day of all? If
it weren’t the winter we could take a jaunt to Italy. They say
Switzerland’s very lovely in the snow, except for the cold. But,
as you say, the great thing is to finish the book. Now let me
see&mdash;"</p>

<p>When they inspected her manuscripts, which Katharine had put
in order, they found a state of things well calculated to dash
their spirits, if they had not just resolved on reform. They found,
to begin with, a great variety of very imposing paragraphs with
which the biography was to open; many of these, it is true, were
unfinished, and resembled triumphal arches standing upon one leg,
but, as Mrs. Hilbery observed, they could be patched up in ten
minutes, if she gave her mind to it. Next, there was an account
of the ancient home of the Alardyces, or rather, of spring in
Suffolk, which was very beautifully written, although not essential
to the story. However, Katharine had put together a string of
names and dates, so that the poet was capably brought into the
world, and his ninth year was reached without further mishap.
After that, Mrs. Hilbery wished, for sentimental reasons, to introduce
the recollections of a very fluent old lady, who had been brought
up in the same village, but these Katharine decided must go. It
might be advisable to introduce here a sketch of contemporary
poetry contributed by Mr. Hilbery, and thus terse and learned
and altogether out of keeping with the rest, but Mrs. Hilbery
was of opinion that it was too bare, and made one feel altogether
like a good little girl in a lecture-room, which was not at all
in keeping with her father. It was put on one side. Now came the
period of his early manhood, when various affairs of the heart
must either be concealed or revealed; here again Mrs. Hilbery
was of two minds, and a thick packet of manuscript was shelved
for further consideration.</p>

<p>Several years were now altogether omitted, because Mrs. Hilbery
had found something distasteful to her in that period, and had
preferred to dwell upon her own recollections as a child. After
this, it seemed to Katharine that the book became a wild dance
of will-o’-the-wisps, without form or continuity, without coherence
even, or any attempt to make a narrative. Here were twenty pages
upon her grandfather’s taste in hats, an essay upon contemporary
china, a long account of a summer day’s expedition into the country,
when they had missed their train, together with fragmentary visions
of all sorts of famous men and women, which seemed to be partly
imaginary and partly authentic. There were, moreover, thousands
of letters, and a mass of faithful recollections contributed by
old friends, which had grown yellow now in their envelopes, but
must be placed somewhere, or their feelings would be hurt. So
many volumes had been written about the poet since his death that
she had also to dispose of a great number of misstatements, which
involved minute researches and much correspondence. Sometimes
Katharine brooded, half crushed, among her papers; sometimes she
felt that it was necessary for her very existence that she should
free herself from the past; at others, that the past had completely
displaced the present, which, when one resumed life after a morning
among the dead, proved to be of an utterly thin and inferior composition.</p>

<p>The worst of it was that she had no aptitude for literature.
She did not like phrases. She had even some natural antipathy
to that process of self-examination, that perpetual effort to
understand one’s own feeling, and express it beautifully, fitly,
or energetically in language, which constituted so great a part
of her mother’s existence. She was, on the contrary, inclined
to be silent; she shrank from expressing herself even in talk,
let alone in writing. As this disposition was highly convenient
in a family much given to the manufacture of phrases, and seemed
to argue a corresponding capacity for action, she was, from her
childhood even, put in charge of household affairs. She had the
reputation, which nothing in her manner contradicted, of being
the most practical of people. Ordering meals, directing servants,
paying bills, and so contriving that every clock ticked more or
less accurately in time, and a number of vases were always full
of fresh flowers was supposed to be a natural endowment of hers,
and, indeed, Mrs. Hilbery often observed that it was poetry the
wrong side out. From a very early age, too, she had to exert herself
in another capacity; she had to counsel and help and generally
sustain her mother. Mrs. Hilbery would have been perfectly well
able to sustain herself if the world had been what the world is
not. She was beautifully adapted for life in another planet. But
the natural genius she had for conducting affairs there was of
no real use to her here. Her watch, for example, was a constant
source of surprise to her, and at the age of sixty-five she was
still amazed at the ascendancy which rules and reasons exerted
over the lives of other people. She had never learnt her lesson,
and had constantly to be punished for her ignorance. But as that
ignorance was combined with a fine natural insight which saw deep
whenever it saw at all, it was not possible to write Mrs. Hilbery
off among the dunces; on the contrary, she had a way of seeming
the wisest person in the room. But, on the whole, she found it
very necessary to seek support in her daughter.</p>

<p>Katharine, thus, was a member of a very great profession which
has, as yet, no title and very little recognition, although the
labor of mill and factory is, perhaps, no more severe and the
results of less benefit to the world. She lived at home. She did
it very well, too. Any one coming to the house in Cheyne Walk
felt that here was an orderly place, shapely, controlled&mdash;a place
where life had been trained to show to the best advantage, and,
though composed of different elements, made to appear harmonious
and with a character of its own. Perhaps it was the chief triumph
of Katharine’s art that Mrs. Hilbery’s character predominated.
She and Mr. Hilbery appeared to be a rich background for her mother’s
more striking qualities.</p>

<p>Silence being, thus, both natural to her and imposed upon her,
the only other remark that her mother’s friends were in the habit
of making about it was that it was neither a stupid silence nor
an indifferent silence. But to what quality it owed its character,
since character of some sort it had, no one troubled themselves
to inquire. It was understood that she was helping her mother
to produce a great book. She was known to manage the household.
She was certainly beautiful. That accounted for her satisfactorily.
But it would have been a surprise, not only to other people but
to Katharine herself, if some magic watch could have taken count
of the moments spent in an entirely different occupation from
her ostensible one. Sitting with faded papers before her, she
took part in a series of scenes such as the taming of wild ponies
upon the American prairies, or the conduct of a vast ship in a
hurricane round a black promontory of rock, or in others more
peaceful, but marked by her complete emancipation from her present
surroundings and, needless to say, by her surpassing ability in
her new vocation. When she was rid of the pretense of paper and
pen, phrase-making and biography, she turned her attention in
a more legitimate direction, though, strangely enough, she would
rather have confessed her wildest dreams of hurricane and prairie
than the fact that, upstairs, alone in her room, she rose early
in the morning or sat up late at night to... work at mathematics.
No force on earth would have made her confess that. Her actions
when thus engaged were furtive and secretive, like those of some
nocturnal animal. Steps had only to sound on the staircase, and
she slipped her paper between the leaves of a great Greek dictionary
which she had purloined from her father’s room for this purpose.
It was only at night, indeed, that she felt secure enough from
surprise to concentrate her mind to the utmost.</p>

<p>Perhaps the unwomanly nature of the science made her instinctively
wish to conceal her love of it. But the more profound reason was
that in her mind mathematics were directly opposed to literature.
She would not have cared to confess how infinitely she preferred
the exactitude, the star-like impersonality, of figures to the
confusion, agitation, and vagueness of the finest prose. There
was something a little unseemly in thus opposing the tradition
of her family; something that made her feel wrong-headed, and
thus more than ever disposed to shut her desires away from view
and cherish them with extraordinary fondness. Again and again
she was thinking of some problem when she should have been thinking
of her grandfather. Waking from these trances, she would see that
her mother, too, had lapsed into some dream almost as visionary
as her own, for the people who played their parts in it had long
been numbered among the dead. But, seeing her own state mirrored
in her mother’s face, Katharine would shake herself awake with
a sense of irritation. Her mother was the last person she wished
to resemble, much though she admired her. Her common sense would
assert itself almost brutally, and Mrs. Hilbery, looking at her
with her odd sidelong glance, that was half malicious and half
tender, would liken her to "your wicked old Uncle Judge Peter,
who used to be heard delivering sentence of death in the bathroom.
Thank Heaven, Katharine, I’ve not a drop of <em>HIM </em>in me!"</p>
