<p>All this time the baying of the hound continued, the sounds showing
that he had circled and was approaching the boys, who were not
a little astonished at the unexpected turn of affairs.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty dog," laughed Herbert; "he is making fools of
us all."</p>

<p>"There isn't any need of that so far as <em>you</em> are concerned,"
retorted Nick, losing patience with the slurs of their companion.
"You had better wait till you find out what it means before you
condemn Bowser."</p>

<p>Herbert made no answer, for the dog was now so close that the
interest of all was centered on his actions.</p>

<p>"My gracious, what a terrible racket he makes!" exclaimed Nick;
"there must be something unusual to excite Bowser like that."</p>

<p>The dog was not heard for several minutes, but the crashing through
the undergrowth sounded nearer and nearer, and, as Sam declared,
showed that Bowser had steam up and was going for something.</p>

<p>Suddenly the bushes parted only a short ways from where the three
wondering lads stood, and, instead of the hound, some kind of
a wild animal came toward them on a dead run.</p>

<p>The group were too amazed to think of the guns they held, and
only stared in mute wonder.</p>

<p>The game did not see them until within a hundred feet, when he
whirled at right angles and plunged away with arrowy speed.</p>

<p>As he did so, he exposed his flank to the young hunters, who
could not have been given a better opportunity to bring him down,
for the throwing forward of the foreleg, opened his most vulnerable
part to the bullet.</p>

<p>But none was sent after him; at that instant he was recognized
as a fine buck deer, with branching antlers thrown back so that
they seemed to rest on his spine, while his legs were flung straight
in front and then backward, as he took his long graceful leaps.</p>

<p>The boys had set out to hunt a bear, and were astounded that,
when they dared not hope they were anywhere in his vicinity, a
splendid deer should spring up and dash by them.</p>

<p>Before they could give utterance to their amazement, Bowser came
along with his nose to the ground and baying hoarsely.</p>

<p>Just as he turned to follow the deer, Herbert Watrous raised
his breech-loader to his shoulder and fired point blank at him.</p>

<p>"What did you do that for?" demanded Sam Harper, striding threateningly
toward him with his fist raised.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why &mdash;I declare! I thought it was the bear!" exclaimed
the abashed Herbert; "I never dreamed it was the dog."</p>

<p>Sam was not disposed to believe this story, and he stood irresolute,
strongly inclined to punish the city youth who had fired at his
hound; but Nick compelled his angry friend to laugh by saying:</p>

<p>"You shouldn't be mad, Sam, for Bowser is safe so long as Herbert
aims at him. I don't think he came within twenty feet. If he should
hit him you can make up your mind it is an accident."</p>

<p>Herbert hardly knew how to answer this remark, for he saw that
he had not done a very creditable thing, view it as he might,
so he made a radical turn in the conversation.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought it, boys? We've got not only a bear,
but a deer to hunt, and I say, may the best fellow win!"</p>

<p>And with this manly sentiment on his lips he broke into a rapid
run after the buck and hound, the others following, forgetful
of the little flurry a few minutes before.</p>

<p>It was not in the order of things that the lads should be able
to make their way through the woods and undergrowth with anything
like the speed of the fallow deer or dog. Hunters don't expect
to overtake their game in anything like a fair chase when all
are on foot, but resort to stratagem.</p>

<p>By stationing themselves so as to head off a deer, they secure
the one shot which is all-sufficient. It would be counted an extremely
good piece of fortune could they obtain such a fair target as
has already been given the young hunters; and, having let it pass
unimproved, they scarcely would have expected to be so favored
again.</p>

<p>It was natural, therefore, that they should make a pell-mell
rush after the deer and hound, and that they should keep going
until, once more, they were forced to stop from exhaustion.</p>

<p>By this time the baying of Bowser came to them so faintly that
it was plain he was a mile distant at the least, while there could
be little doubt that the buck was much farther off.</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed the panting Herbert Watrous, "I can't say I
see much fun in this; it's too much like chasing a railroad train."</p>

<p>"No," added Nick, "I don't see that there is any hope of running
down the deer, who is more used to traveling than we are."</p>

<p>"Maybe he'll come round in a circle again," said Sam, "and we
may have another chance to see him sail by, while not one of us
raises his gun."</p>

<p>"I suppose we ought to understand something more about the habits
of the deer, so that we would know what course he would be likely
to take. We could then get there ahead of him and fire as soon
as he gave us a chance."</p>

<p>"Well," added Sam, with a sigh, "he seems to have taken the route
we were going to follow to hunt the bear, so we may as well tramp
along. We may get a glimpse of a buffalo or elephant next."</p>

<p>The baying of the hound had ceased, and, though the boys often
stopped and listened, they heard nothing more of it.</p>

<p>"I guess he has caught the deer," said Herbert, who showed a
desire to speak well of Bowser since he had failed to shoot him,
"and is waiting for us."</p>

<p>But Sam shook his head; he knew the canine too well to believe
him capable of such an exploit as that.</p>

<p>"I don't think he ever ran down anything yet, unless it was a
chicken or cat&mdash;hallo!"</p>

<p>At that moment the subject of their conversation appeared on
the scene, approaching as quietly as though the boys were sheep
that he wished to surprise.</p>

<p>He slouched along with a lazy, tired gait, his tongue out, and
dripping with perspiration, while he panted as though he had been
on the severest chase of his life, which most likely was the fact.</p>

<p>He lay down at the feet of Sam Harper, and, stretching out his
paws, rested his head between them as much as to say, "Gentlemen,
I have had enough of this sport, and resign; you will now carry
it on without my assistance."</p>

<p>"He is tired out, and I don't wonder," said Sam, stooping over
and patting the head of the hound; "he ain't used to deer hunting,
and don't know much more about it than do we."</p>

<p>"Then he don't know anything," was the truthful observation of
Nick Ribsam.</p>

<p>"It's my opinion that it's best to give up hunting that particular
deer until we learn a little more about the right way to do it."</p>
