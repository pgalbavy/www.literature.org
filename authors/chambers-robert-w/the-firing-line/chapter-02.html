<p>The <em>Ariani</em> was to sail that evening, her destination
being Miami and the West Coast where Portlaw desired to do some
tarpon fishing and Wayward had railroad interests. Malcourt, always
in a receptive attitude, was quite ready to go anywhere when invited.
Otherwise he preferred a remunerative attention to business.</p>

<p>Hamil, however, though with the gay company aboard, was not of
them; he had business at Palm Beach; his luggage had already been
sent ashore; and now, prepared to follow, he stood a little apart
from the others on the moonlit deck, making his adieux to the
master of the <em>Ariani</em>.</p>

<p>"It's been perfectly stunning&mdash;this cruise," he said. "It was
kind of you, Wayward; I don't know how to tell you how kind&mdash;but
your boat's a corker and you are another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you like this sort of thing?" asked Wayward grimly.</p>

<p>"Like it? It's only a part of your ordinary lives&mdash;yours and
Portlaw's; so you are not quite fitted to understand. But, Wayward,
I've been in heavy harness. You have been doing this sort of heavenly
thing&mdash;how many years?"</p>

<p>"Too many. Tell me; you've really made good this last year, haven't
you, Garry?"</p>

<p>Hamil nodded. "I had to."</p>

<p>He laid his hand on the older man's arm. "Why do you know," he
said, "when they gave me that first commission for the little
park at Hampton Hills&mdash;thanks to you &mdash;I hadn't five dollars
in all the world."</p>

<p>Wayward stood looking at him through his spectacles, absently
pulling at his moustache, which was already partly gray.</p>

<p>"Garry," he said in his deep, pleasant voice that was however
never very clear, "Portlaw tells me that you are to do his place.
Then there are the new parks in Richmond Borough, and this enormous
commission down here among the snakes and jungles. Well &mdash;God
bless you. You're twenty-five and busy. I'm forty-five and"&mdash;he
looked drearily into the younger man's eyes&mdash;"burnt out," he said
with his mirthless laugh&mdash;"and still drenching the embers with
the same stuff that set 'em ablaze.... Good-bye, Garry. Your boat's
alongside. My compliments to your aunt."</p>

<p>At the gangway the younger man bade adieu to Malcourt and Portlaw,
laughing as the latter indignantly requested to know why Hamil
wasted his time attending to business.</p>

<p>Malcourt drew him aside:</p>

<p>"So you're going to rig up a big park and snake preserve for
Neville Cardross?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to try, Louis. You know the family, I believe, don't
you?"</p>

<p>Malcourt gazed placidly at him. "Very well indeed," he replied
deliberately. "They're a, good, domestic, mother-pin-a-rose-on-me
sort of family.... I'm a sort of distant cousin&mdash;run of the house
and privilege of kissing the girls&mdash;not now, but once. I'm going
to stay there when we get back from Miami."</p>

<p>"You didn't tell me that?" observed Hamil, surprised.</p>

<p>"No," said Malcourt carelessly, "I didn't know it myself. Just
made up my mind to do it. Saves hotel expenses. Well&mdash;your cockle-shell
is waiting. Give my regards to the family&mdash;particularly to Shiela."
He looked curiously at Hamil; "particularly to Shiela," he repeated;
but Hamil missed the expression of his eyes in the dusk.</p>

<p>"Are you really going to throw us over like this?" demanded Portlaw
as the young men turned back together across the deck.</p>

<p>"Got to do it," said Hamil cheerfully, offering his hand in adieu.</p>

<p>"Don't plead necessity," insisted Portlaw. "You've just landed
old man Cardross, and you've got the Richmond parks, and you're
going to sting me for more than I'm worth. Why on earth do you
cut and run this way?"</p>

<p>"No man in his proper senses really knows why he does anything.
Seriously, Portlaw, my party is ended&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Destiny gave Ulysses a proud party that lasted ten years; wasn't
it ten, Malcourt?" demanded Portlaw. "Stay with us, son; you've
nine years and eleven months of being a naughty boy coming to
you&mdash;including a few Circes and grand slams&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's met his Circe," cut in Malcourt, leaning languidly over
the rail; "she's wearing a scarlet handkerchief this season&mdash;"</p>

<p>Portlaw, laughing fatly, nodded. "Louis discovered your Circe
through the glasses climbing into your boat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What a busy little beast you are, Malcourt," observed Hamil,
annoyed, glancing down at the small boat alongside.</p>

<p>"'Beast' is good! You mean the mere sight of her transformed
Louis into the classic shote," added Portlaw, laughing louder
as Hamil, still smiling through his annoyance, went over the side.
And a moment later the gig shot away into the star-set darkness.</p>

<p>From the bridge Wayward wearily watched it through his night
glasses; Malcourt, slim and graceful, sat on the rail and looked
out into the Southern dusk, an unlighted cigarette between his
lips.</p>

<p>"That kills our four at Bridge," grumbled Portlaw, leaning heavily
beside him. "We'll have to play Klondike and Preference now, or
call in the ship's cat.... Hello, is that you, Jim?" as Wayward
came aft, limping a trifle as he did at certain times.</p>

<p>"That girl had a good figure&mdash;through the glasses. I couldn't
make out her face; it was probably the limit; combinations are
rare," mused Malcourt. "And then&mdash;the fog came! It was like one
of those low-down classical tricks of Jupiter when caught philandering."</p>

<p>Portlaw laughed till his bulky body shook. "The Olympian fog
was wasted," he said; "John Garret Hamil 3d still preserves his
nursery illusions."</p>

<p>"He's lucky," remarked Wayward, staring into the gloom.</p>

<p>"But not fortunate," added Malcourt; "there's a difference between
luck and fortune. Read the French classics."</p>

<p>Wayward growled; Malcourt, who always took a malicious amusement
in stirring him up, grinned at him sideways.</p>

<p>"No man is fit for decent society until he's lost all his illusions,"
he said, "particularly concerning women."</p>

<p>"Some of us have been fools enough to lose our illusions," retorted
Wayward sharply, "but you never had any, Malcourt; and that's
no compliment from me to you."</p>

<p>Portlaw chuckled. "We never lose illusions; we mislay 'em," he
suggested; "and then we are pretty careful to mislay only that
particular illusion which inconveniences us." He jerked his heavy
head in Malcourt's direction. "Nobody clings more frantically
to illusions than your unbaked cynic; Louis, you're not nearly
such a devil of a fellow as you imagine you are."</p>

<p>Malcourt smiled easily and looked out over the waves.</p>

<p>"Cynicism is old-fashioned," he said; "dogma is up to date. Credo!
I believe in a personal devil, virtuous maidens in bowers, and
rosewood furniture. As for illusions I cherish as many as you
do!" He turned with subtle impudence to Wayward. "And the world
is littered with the shattered fragments."</p>

<p>"It's littered with pups, too," observed Wayward, turning on
his heel. And he walked away, limping, his white mess jacket a
pale spot in the gloom.</p>

<p>Malcourt looked after him; an edge of teeth glimmering beneath
his full upper lip.</p>

<p>"It might be more logical if he'd cut out his alcohol before
he starts in as a gouty marine missionary," he observed. "Last
night he sat there looking like a superannuated cavalry colonel
in spectacles, neuritis twitching his entire left side, unable
to light his own cigar; and there he sat and rambled on and on
about innate purity and American womanhood."</p>

<p>He turned abruptly as a steward stepped up bearing a decanter
and tray of glasses.</p>

<p>Portlaw helped himself, grumbling under his breath that he meant
to cut out this sort of thing and set Wayward an example.</p>

<p>Malcourt lifted his glass gaily:</p>

<p>"Our wives and sweethearts; may they never meet!"</p>

<p>They set back their empty glasses; Portlaw started to move away,
still muttering about the folly of self-indulgence; but the other
detained him.</p>

<p>"Wayward took it out of me in 'Preference' this morning while
Garry was out courting. I'd better liquidate to-night, hadn't
I, Billy?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Portlaw.</p>

<p>The other shook his head. "I'll get it all back at Miami, of
course. In the mean time&mdash;if you don't mind letting me have enough
to square things&mdash;"</p>

<p>Portlaw hesitated, balancing his bulk uneasily first on one foot,
then the other.</p>

<p>"I don't mind; no; only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only what?" asked Malcourt. "I told you I couldn't afford to
play cards on this trip, but you insisted."</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly! I expected to consider you as&mdash;as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm your general manager and I'm ready at all times to earn
my salary. If you think it best to take me away from the estate
for a junketing trip and make me play cards you can do it of course;
but if you think I'm here to throw my money overboard I'm going
back to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Portlaw; "you're not going back. There's nothing
doing in winter up there that requires your personal attention&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's a bad winter for the deer &mdash;I ought to be there now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, can't Blake and O'Connor attend to that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose they can. But I'm not going to waste the winter
and my salary in the semi-tropics just because you want me to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O Lord!" said Portlaw, "what are you kicking about? Have I ever&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You force me to be plain-spoken; you never seem to understand
that if you insist on my playing the wealthy do-nothing that you've
got to keep me going. And I tell you frankly, Billy, I'm tired
of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't flatten your ears and show your teeth," protested
Portlaw amiably. "I only supposed you had enough&mdash;with such a
salary&mdash;to give yourself a little rope on a trip like this, considering
you've nobody but yourself to look out for, and that <em>I</em>
do that and pay you heavily for the privilege"&mdash;his voice had
become a mumble&mdash;"and all you do is to take vacations in New York
or sit on a horse and watch an army of men plant trout and pheasants,
and cut out ripe timber &mdash;O hell!"</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> did you say?"</p>

<p>Portlaw became good-humouredly matter of fact: "I <em>said</em>
'hell,' Louis&mdash;which meant, 'what's the use of squabbling.' It
also means that you are going to have what you require as a matter
of course; so come on down to my state-room and let us figure
it up before Jim Wayward begins to turn restless and limp toward
the card-room."</p>

<p>As they turned and strolled forward, Malcourt nudged him:</p>

<p>"Look at the fireworks over Lake Worth," he said; "probably Palm
Beach's welcome to her new and beardless prophet."</p>

<p>"It's one of their cheap Venetian fêtes," muttered Portlaw. "I
know 'em; they're rather amusing. If we weren't sailing in an
hour we'd go. No doubt Hamil's in it already; probably Cardross
put him next to a bunch of dreams and he's right in it at this
very moment."</p>

<p>"With the girl in the red handkerchief," added Malcourt. "I wish
we had time."</p>

<p>"I believe I've seen that girl somewhere," mused Portlaw.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have; there are all kinds at Palm Beach, even yours,
and," he added with his easy impudence, "I expect to preserve
my notions concerning every one of them. Ho! Look at that sheaf
of sky-rockets, Billy! Zip! Whir-r! Bang! Great is Diana of the
Ephesians!&mdash;bless her heart!"</p>

<p>"Going up like Garret Hamil's illusions," said Portlaw, sentimentally.
"I wonder if he sees 'em and considers the moral they are writing
across the stars. O slush! Life is like a stomach; if you fill
it too full it hurts you. What about <em>that</em> epigram, Louis?
What about it?"</p>

<p>The other's dark, graceful head was turned toward the fiery fête
on shore, and his busy thoughts were with that lithe, dripping
figure he had seen through the sea-glasses, climbing into a distant
boat. For the figure reminded him of a girl he had known very
well when the world was younger; and the memory was not wholly
agreeable.</p>
