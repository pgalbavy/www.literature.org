<p><em>HERBERT </em>was quite sure the Texans would not be gone
long, unless they, too, became involved in a fight with the dusky
raiders and shared in the probable fate of Eph Bozeman. If such
proved to be the case, there would be sounds of the conflict,
which would be as brief as it was desperate, and it was those
for which he listened while sitting in his saddle on the slope.</p>

<p>The stillness remaining unbroken, he turned his pony toward the
point he had left, and found, on reaching it, that Strubell and
Lattin had arrived a few minutes before and were becoming anxious
over his absence.</p>

<p>It was now a question whether the three should stay where they
were or go elsewhere with their animals. The Apaches were prowling
around the surrounding country so closely that it looked as if
they had located the group. Such was the view of Strubell and
Herbert, but Lattin, on the other hand, was so positive that their
enemies knew nothing of their presence that the others agreed
to stay where they were until something more certain became known.</p>

<p>Trouble was likely to follow a change of base, since the trapper
on his return would be puzzled to find them, though the Texans
would be sure to give him all the help they could, and that was
considerable.</p>

<p>There was nothing therefore to do but to wait, the most wearisome
occupation of anyone. The nerves of all were strung to such a
high point that there was little inclination to sleep. It was
a long time since they had eaten or drank, and they were in need
of food and drink, but no step was to be taken for the procurement
of either until the momentous question was settled.</p>

<p>Lattin believed that the Indian horseman seen by Herbert received
no inkling of the truth. His pony had detected something, and
his rider, bringing him to a halt, sat looking and listening for
the explanation that did not come. Concluding it was some wild
animal or reptile moving in the grass, he had dashed off to join
his companions.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as both the Texans were in accord by this time in the
theory that they were not discovered by the red men, at the time
of the scare just before sunset, the youth felt no fear in that
regard. It followed therefore that the Apaches were unaware of
their presence, and were not likely to learn of it except through
some accident.</p>

<p>No one could forecast the result of the pistol shot that had
rung out over the prairie, and which showed that the trapper’s
stealthy journey to the building had not been without incident.</p>

<p>The little company spoke only at intervals, and then in whispers.
Their eyes and ears were so intently engaged that conversation
interfered. The stillness was so profound that the champing of
the horses was heard as they cropped the grass, while the sound
of the hoofs was so distinct when they shifted about, that it
seemed to Herbert they must draw the Apaches to the spot.</p>

<p>By and by one of the ponies stopped eating and lay down, then
two others did the same, but the fourth kept it up so long that
Lattin was about to go out and compel him to retire to his couch,
when he did so. This left the quiet so perfect that it would have
taken a wonderfully skilful warrior to steal up undetected on
foot, and it was impossible for a horseman to do so.</p>

<p>The stars twinkled from a sky that was unclouded except in the
western horizon, where a bank of clouds climbed part way to the
zenith and shut out a portion of the faint light. In whatever
direction the watchers gazed was the same blank darkness. Though
they knew that men were near and constantly in motion, no glimpse
of them was obtained.</p>

<p>"Baker," said the elder Texan in his guarded undertone, "I’m
going to sleep for half an hour."</p>

<p>"All right," replied his companion; "I’ll do the same when you
wake up."</p>

<p>Strubell made not the slightest change in his position. He simply
turned his head sideways upon his arm, bent at the elbow, and
shut his eyes. Almost at the same moment he became unconscious.</p>

<p>The party had not removed their blankets from the backs of the
ponies, through fear that it might delay them whenever a sudden
movement should become necessary. They were stretched at full
length on the grass. In that salubrious country, with its pure,
dry air, there was no thought of ill results therefrom.</p>

<p>Herbert was near Lattin, and he asked:</p>

<p>"Will he wake at the end of the half hour?"</p>

<p>"If he don’t I’ll wake him," replied the other; "but I never
knew Ard to vary more’n a minute or two."</p>

<p>"What do you make of Bozeman’s long absence? Several hours must
have gone by."</p>

<p>"It seems later than it is, but I expected him back before this."</p>

<p>"How do you account for his delay?"</p>

<p>"There may be several causes," replied Lattin; "in the first
place, maybe he run into a hornets’ nest and was knifed before
he could shoot a second chamber of his revolver. Them Apaches
work quick at such business, and they would shove Eph under in
the style of greased lightning."</p>

<p>"But," suggested Herbert, who was after every grain of comfort,
"it might be he found trouble in getting inside the building."</p>

<p>"That’s likely, though Ard and me went up in sight of it without
runnin’ agin any of the varmints; but it couldn’t have kept him
all this time, for if he didn’t get inside long ago he would have
given up and come back to us."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose there has been any trouble with Rickard?"</p>

<p>"I don’t see what trouble there could be; all the work Eph had
was to find out the best the scamp would do, and then either agree
or disagree with him. The most likely trouble is that Eph found
the varmints so plentiful when he started to come back that he
hasn’t been able to get through and is waiting for the chance."</p>

<p>"If that proves the case, what will be done in the morning?"</p>

<p>"It’s hard to tell till the morning comes. Rickard and Slidham
may come out to help us fight our way in."</p>

<p>The incident was not impossible, but what a unique state of affairs
it suggested! It recalled the affairs in the Southwest, during
the Mexican War, when a party of Comanches and "Greasers" would
assail a handful of Americans, working as the most ardent allies
until the Americans were disposed of, when the Mexicans and Indians
would turn upon each other like cat o’ mountains.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said Lattin a few minutes later, "there’s the moon."</p>

<p>The upper edge of the gibbous orb was creeping above the horizon,
and looked like the point of a fiery spear as it climbed rapidly
upward.</p>

<p>"That’s going to give us help," said Herbert, watching the satellite,
whose ascent was strikingly swift.</p>

<p>"I don’t know about that," replied the Texan; "it will let us
see further ‘cross the prairie, but don’t forget that it’ll do
the same for the varmints. It won’t be so easy for Eph to get
back as it was to go forward, always providin’ that he <em>did</em>
go forward."</p>

<p>Strubell slumbered as quietly as an infant. His breathing could
not be heard, even in the perfect stillness which reigned. Herbert
glanced at him more than once, with an odd fear that perhaps he
was dead, but that was hardly possible.</p>

<p>Knowing the direction of the building, Lattin and Herbert tried
to peer through the gloom and see it, but the light was insufficient
to show its most shadowy outlines.</p>

<p>"Baker," whispered the youth, "I think I see something out there
toward the building."</p>

<p>"Whether you do or not," replied the Texan, "I’m sure <em>I</em>
do; someone is comin’ this way."</p>

<p>"It must be an Apache."</p>

<p>"Keep quiet; we’ll soon see."</p>

<p>As the hunter spoke, he made sure his rifle was ready to fire
the instant it should become necessary. He was not troubled by
the tender conscience of his companion in that respect.</p>

<p>The approaching figure was on foot, and, though advancing without
noise, did so swiftly. It rapidly grew more distinct in the gloom,
until the broad-brimmed hat, the massive frame, with the long
rifle grasped in one hand, left no doubt of its identity.</p>

<p>It was old Eph Bozeman returning at last.</p>
