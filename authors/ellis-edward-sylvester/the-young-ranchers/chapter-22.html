<p>The fugitives were now so close to the ridge that Warren Starr,
from his position on his pony, turned his attention to their immediate
front. He saw that the race must end, so far as his steed was
concerned, within the next second. The trees stood close together,
the ascent was steep, and the bowlders and rocks, plainly discernible,
since all leafage was gone, showed that the horse must halt of
necessity at the moment of striking the base of the elevation.</p>

<p>The Sioux had ceased firing. They were so certain of capturing
the youths that they saved their ammunition. The struggle could
not last much longer.</p>

<p>"Be ready to jump off!" said Warren to his companion; "I am going
to stop!"</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, he threw Jack on his haunches with a suddenness
that would have pitched the couple over his head, had they not
braced themselves. Both took a flying leap from his back and dashed
for the cover now directly before them.</p>

<p>The purpose was still to keep together, but circumstances beyond
their control prevented. They had no time to form any plan. Young
Starr darted to the right, aiming for some rocks which he fancied
might afford partial shelter. Tim had his eye on a somewhat similar
refuge to the left, and made for that. He would have joined his
friend had he known his intention, but the seconds were too precious
to allow it, after a few steps were taken. So he kept on without
once glancing behind him.</p>

<p>Still there was no firing. The Indians must have felt more certain
than ever of their prey, thus to hold their shots. They emitted
several whoops of exultation, and the foremost bounded from their
ponies and sped after the fugitives like so many bloodhounds.</p>

<p>But the separation of the latter compelled a division of the
former, who, it will be remembered, were scattered at varying
distances, only a couple being at the heels of the young ranchers.
Thus it came about that each was pursued by a single warrior,
and through a whim which cannot be fully understood, the Sioux
next to the leaders turned to the left on the trail of the young
Irishman, who had thus the honor, if it may be so considered,
of attracting the greater attention.</p>

<p>For a few moments Warren devoted his energies to running. He
bounded like a hare over the first bowlder that interposed, swerved
slightly to the right, to pass an obstructing rock, and went up
the slope with the same headlong speed with which he had dashed
from the level ground to the bottom of the slope.</p>

<p>It was not until he had sped fully a hundred yards in this furious
fashion that he ventured to throw a glance over his shoulder.
Then he learned that there was but a single Sioux in sight.</p>

<p>The fugitive had held his own so well against this miscreant,
that the latter must have felt a quick fear of his escaping him
altogether. Young Starr was an unusually swift sprinter, and it
may be doubted whether the fleet-footed Indian could have run
him down in a fair contest.</p>

<p>The fear of losing the young man caused the Sioux to check himself
abruptly, bring his gun to a level, and let fly.</p>

<p>An extraordinary accident, or rather providence, saved the fugitive.
At the very instant of his enemy firing, Warren's foot slipped
in the snow, and he stumbled on his hands and knees. Certain that
his fall was due to the bullet just sent after him, the Sioux,
with a whoop of triumph, bounded forward over the bowlders and
around the rocks to finish him.</p>

<p>Warren saw, with lightning-like quickness, that his fall might
be his salvation. It had deceived his foe into the belief that
he was either killed or mortally hurt, and he was, therefore,
unprepared for that which followed.</p>

<p>The youth did not attempt to rise. He had slipped down in such
a position that he was hidden from the sight of his pursuer. He
quickly shifted around so as to face him, and, rising on one knee,
held his Winchester pointed and ready for use.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. The Sioux was so close that the next
minute his head and shoulders appeared above the rock, as he took
his tremendous strides toward the lad, whom he expected to see
stretched helpless on the snowy earth.</p>

<p>The sight of him kneeling on one knee, with his rifle aimed,
his eye ranging along the barrel, and his finger on the trigger,
was the first startling apprisal of the real state of affairs.</p>

<p>The warrior instantly perceived his fearful mistake, and made
a desperate attempt to dodge to one side, but though the loon
may elude the bullet of the hunter's rifle, no man has ever yet
been equal to the task. No screeching Indian was ever hit more
fairly, surprised more suddenly, or extinguished more utterly.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE DEATH OF THE INDIAN</em>.]</p>

<p>And so it came about that in the twinkling of an eye Warren Starr
was left without a pursuer. Not a solitary Sioux was in sight.</p>

<p>But he was too wise to think he was safe. He was simply relieved
for the time being of his harassing foes. They must have heard
the discharge of his rifle, and some of them would soon investigate
when their comrade failed to return to them. This would be after
a few minutes. Naturally they would suppose that the fugitive
had been brought down, and not until a brief period had elapsed
would they suspect the truth.</p>

<p>It was this interval which must be utilized to the utmost, if
the youth hoped to escape. While the snow would reveal his trail
so plainly that it could be followed without the least difficulty,
yet his own fleetness ought to enable him to keep so far in advance
of the Sioux that they could not gain another shot at him. True,
he was deprived of his matchless pony, but the red men were also
on foot, and therefore they stood on equal terms, with the opening
in favor of the fugitive.</p>

<p>Warren would have been full of hope and resolution, but for Tim
Brophy. His concern for his devoted friend forbade him turning
the situation solely to his own account. He made a hasty examination
of his rifle, and found nothing the matter with it. It was ready
for use whenever needed.</p>

<p>Not a solitary warrior was in sight, and the profound stillness
which reigned caused the incidents of the last few minutes to
seem like some wild dream.</p>

<p>With that peculiar doubt that sometimes comes over one in such
crises, Warren gently pinched one hand with the other. The result
convinced him that everything was real&mdash;imagination had nothing
to do with it.</p>

<p>The reports of his own Winchester and the Sioux's rifle were
all that had broken the stillness since the headlong leap of the
young ranchers from the back of the pony. There could have been
no other report without its being heard by Warren, who was sorely
perplexed over the fact.</p>

<p>Could it be that equally good fortune had befallen Tim Brophy?
Had he been able to throw his pursuers off the track for the time?
It seemed impossible that two such providences should come simultaneously
to the fugitives. The Irishman was by no means as fleet of foot
as Warren, and with the majority of the pursuers dashing after
him, only the worst result was to be feared.</p>

<p>"Some of them will soon be here," was the conclusion of the youth,
as he stood sorely perplexed as to what he should do; "if I remain,
I shall have half a dozen of them around me, and then it will
be all up; but what about Tim?"</p>

<p>In his chivalrous devotion to his comrade, he now began withdrawing
from his dangerous position, but trended to the right as he faced
his enemies, with the object of getting near Tim, and with the
hope that he might be of help to him in his desperate strait.</p>

<p>He shuddered as he glanced down at the ground and observed the
prints he made in the snow. There could be no delay in tracing
him, no matter what direction he might take. It must be the same
with his friend, who, despite any advantage gained at the beginning
of his last flight, could be readily run down, if the Sioux preferred
that to "winging" him while in full flight.</p>
