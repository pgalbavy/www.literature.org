<p>It was still dark when I awoke; the fire had become a pyramid
of coals. By the dull glow I saw two figures moving; one of them
presently crossed the dim, crimson circle and sat down beside
me, fists clasped under his massive chin, rifle balanced on his
knees.</p>

<p>"I am awake," I whispered. "Is there any trouble?"</p>

<p>Without moving a muscle of his huge frame, the forest runner
said: "Don't come into the fire-ring. There's a man been prowling
yonder, a-sniffing our fire, for the last four hours."</p>

<p>I drew myself farther into the darkness, looking about me, shivering
and rubbing my stiffened limbs.</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" he asked, without turning his head.</p>

<p>I told him I felt rested, and thanked him so earnestly for his
great kindness to me that he began to laugh and chuckle all to
himself and drag his great chin to and fro across his knuckles.</p>

<p>"Consider yourself fortunate, eh?" he repeated, rising to come
into the thicket and squat on his haunches beside me.</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, wondering what he found so droll in the situation.</p>

<p>"Ever hear of Catamount Jack?" he inquired, after a moment.</p>

<p>"Yes; you mean Jack Mount, the highwayman? But you are mistaken;
the man who follows me is not Jack Mount," I replied, smiling.</p>

<p>"Sure?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," I said, bitterly; "I ought to know."</p>

<p>"What do you know about Jack Mount?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I? Nothing&mdash;that is, nothing except what everybody knows."</p>

<p>"Well, what does Mister Everybody know?" he inquired, sneeringly.</p>

<p>"They say he takes the King's highway," I replied. "There's a
book about him, printed in Boston."</p>

<p>"With a gibbet on the cover," interrupted the big fellow, impatiently.
"Oh, I know all that. But don't they say he's a rebel?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," I replied; "everybody knows he set fire to the King's
ship, <em>Gaspee</em>, and started the rebels a-pitching tea overboard
from Griffin's Wharf."</p>

<p>I stopped short and looked at him in amazement. <em>He</em> was
Jack Mount! I did not doubt it for one moment. And there was the
famous Weasel, too&mdash;that little, shrivelled comrade of his!&mdash;both
corresponding exactly to their descriptions which I had read in
the Boston book, ay, read to Silver Heels, while her gray eyes
grew rounder and rounder at the exploits of these so-called "Minions
of the Moon."</p>

<p>"Well," asked the forest runner, with a chuckle, "do you still
think yourself lucky?"</p>

<p>I managed to say that I thought I was, but my lack of enthusiasm
sent the big fellow into spasms of smothered laughter.</p>

<p>"Now, now, be sensible," he said. "You know you've a belt full
of gold, a string of good wampum in your sack, and as pretty a
rifle as ever I saw. And you still think yourself in luck? And
you're supping with Jack Mount? And the Weasel's watching everything
from yonder hazel-bunch? And Saul Shemuel's pretending to be asleep
under that pine-tree? Why, Mr. Cardigan, you amaze me!" he lisped,
mockingly.</p>

<p>So the little Hebrew had recognized me after all. I swallowed
a lump in my throat and rose to my elbow. With Jack Mount beside
me, Walter Butler prowling outside the fire-ring, and I alone,
stripped of every weapon, what in Heaven's sight was left for
me to do? Truly, I had jumped into that same fire which burns
below all frying-pans, and presently must begin a-roasting, too.</p>

<p>"So they say I take the King's highway, eh?" observed Mount,
twiddling his great thumbs over his ramrod and digging his heels
into the pine-needles.</p>

<p>"They say so," I replied, sullenly.</p>

<p>He burst out petulantly: "I never take a <em>rebel</em> purse!
The next fool you hear call me a cut-purse, tell him that to stop
his mouth withal!" And he fell a-muttering to himself: "King's
highway, eh? Not mine, not his, not yours&mdash;oh no!&mdash;but the King's.
By God! I'd like to meet his Majesty of a moonlight on this same
highway of his!"</p>

<p>He turned roughly on me, demanding what brought me into the forest;
but I shook my head, lips obstinately compressed.</p>

<p>"Won't tell, eh?" he growled.</p>

<p>An ugly gleam came into his eyes, but died out again as quickly;
and he shrugged his giant's shoulders and spat out a quid of spruce-gum
he had been chewing.</p>

<p>"One thing's plain as Shemuel's nose yonder," he said, jerking
a big thumb towards the sleeping peddler; "you're a King's man
if I'm a King's highwayman, and I'll be cursed if you go free
without a better accounting than a wag o' your head!"</p>

<p>Cade Renard, the Weasel, had come up while Mount was speaking,
and his bright little eyes gleamed ruby red in the fire-glow as
he scanned me warily from head to toe.</p>

<p>"What's his business?" he inquired of Mount. "I've searched his
pack again, and I can't find anything except the wampum belts."</p>

<p>At this na√Øve avowal I jumped up angrily, forgetting fear, demanding
to know by what right he dared search my pack; but the impassive
Weasel only blinked at Mount and chewed a birch-leaf reflectively.</p>

<p>"What is he, Jack?" he asked again, turning towards me, as though
I had been some new kind of bird.</p>

<p>"Don't know," replied Mount; "not worth the plucking, anyhow.
Take his wampum belts, all the same," he added, with a terrific
yawn.</p>

<p>"If you are a patriot," I said, desperately, "you will leave
me my belts and meddle only with your own affairs."</p>

<p>Both men turned and looked at me curiously.</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> are no patriot," said Mount, after a silence.</p>

<p>"Why not?" I persisted.</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;ay&mdash;why and why not?" yawned Mount. "I don't know, if you
won't tell. The devil take you, for aught I care! But you won't
get your belts," he added, slyly, watching me askance to note
the effect of his words.</p>

<p>"Why not?" I repeated, choking down my despair.</p>

<p>"Because you'll talk with your belts to some of these damned
Indians hereabouts," he grinned, "and I want to know what you've
got to say to them first."</p>

<p>"I tell you that my belts mean no harm to patriots!" I repeated,
firmly. "You say I am no patriot. I deny it; I am a better patriot
than you, or I should not be in this forest to-day!"</p>

<p>"You are not a patriot," broke in Cade Renard; "you have proved
it already!"</p>

<p>"You say that," I retorted, "because Jack Mount, the highwayman,
gives me the Boston greeting&mdash;'God save our country!'&mdash;and I do
not reply? What of it? I'm at least patriot enough not to pretend
to be one. I am patriot enough not to rob my own countrymen. I
can say 'God save our country!' as well as you, and I do say it,
with better grace than either of you!"</p>

<p>The men exchanged sullen glances.</p>

<p>"That password is not fit for spies," said Mount, grimly.</p>

<p>"Spy? You take me for a spy?" I cried, in astonishment. "Well,
if you are the famous Jack Mount, you've duller wits than people
believe."</p>

<p>"I've wit enough left to keep an eye on you," he roared, starting
towards me; but the Weasel laid his little, rough claw on the
giant's arm, and at the same moment I saw a dark figure step just
within the outer fire-ring, holding up one arm as a sign of peace.
The man was Walter Butler. I dropped back softly into the shadow
of the thicket.</p>

<p>Slowly Jack Mount strolled around the rim of the fire-circle,
rifle lying in the hollow of his left arm. He halted a few paces
from Butler and signed for him to remain where he stood. There
was no mistaking that signal, for it was a Mohawk sign, and both
men understood that it meant "Move and I shoot!"</p>

<p>"Well, Captain Butler," he drawled, "what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"You know me, sir?" replied Butler, without the faintest trace
of surprise in his colourless voice.</p>

<p>"Ay, we all know you," replied Mount, quickly; "even in your
Iroquois dress."</p>

<p>"May I inquire your name, sir?" asked Butler, with that deathly
grimace which was his smile.</p>

<p>"You may inquire, certainly you may inquire," said Mount, cordially.
"You may inquire of my old friend, the moon. Gad, she knows me
well, Captain Butler!"</p>

<p>After a silence Butler said: "You unintentionally misled me last
evening, friend. The man I follow did not cross the river as you
supposed."</p>

<p>"Really?" cried Mount, smiling.</p>

<p>There came another silence, then Butler spoke again:</p>

<p>"I am here on business of my Lord Dunmore; I am here to arrest
a young man who is supposed to lie hidden in your camp. I call
on you, sir, whoever you are, to aid me in execution of the law."</p>

<p>"The law! Gad, she's another acquaintance o' mine, the jade!"
said Mount, laughing. "I suppose you bring that pretty valentine
of hers&mdash;what some people call a warrant&mdash;do you not, Captain
Butler?"</p>

<p>"I do," said Butler, moving forward and holding out a paper.
Mount took it, and, while he read it, he deliberately shoved Butler
back with his elbow to where he had been standing, crowded him
back before his huge, outstretched arm, coolly scanning the warrant
the while. And Butler could not avoid the giant save by retreating,
step by step, beyond the dull red circle, and out against the
sky-line, where a bullet could scarcely miss him.</p>

<p>Mount was now contemplating the warrant in deep admiration. He
held it out at arm's-length, cocking his head on one side; he
held it upside down; he turned it over; he scanned it sideways.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cade!" he called out, cheerily. "'Tis the same old valentine!
Gad, Captain Butler, we have seen them in every one o' the thirteen
colonies&mdash;my friend yonder, and I!"</p>

<p>"You are doubtless a sheriff, sir," observed Butler, patiently.</p>

<p>"No," said Mount; "no, not exactly what you could call a sheriff,
Captain Butler; but I have had much business with sheriffs. I
owe them more than I can ever repay," he added, sentimentally.</p>

<p>"Then you will understand, sir, the necessity of aiding the law,"
suggested Butler, holding out his hand for the warrant.</p>

<p>But Mount quietly pocketed the paper and began to whistle and
reprime his rifle.</p>

<p>"May I trouble you for that paper?" asked Butler, with his chilling,
sinister politeness.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Butler's eyes stole around the camp-fire,
but only the little Hebrew was now visible, for I lay in the shadow
and the Weasel had ominously vanished.</p>

<p>"You do not mean to retain this warrant, sir?" demanded Butler,
raising his sneering voice, and searching the thickets for some
sign of the ambushed Weasel.</p>

<p>"Oh, Captain Butler," said Mount, with a gigantic simper, "how
can I resist you? Pray tell me who this bad young Michael Cardigan
may be, and what he has done to get his name on this valentine?"</p>

<p>"It is a matter of treason," retorted Butler, sharply. "Come,
my good man, have done with silly chatter and aid me to my duty
in the King's name!"</p>

<p>Mount burst into a shout of laughter. "That's it! In the King's
name! I've heard that, too,&mdash;oh yes, I've heard that o' moonlight
nights!"</p>

<p>Butler observed him in astonishment, but Mount held his sides
and roared in his mirth: "Comes friend Butler with his warrant,
tripping it through the woods, and singing of the King like a
titmouse on a stump. Ay, singing to me to help him take a stout
fellow in the King's name! Ha! Ha! Ha! This funny Mr. Sheriff
Butler!" Then, in a flash, he wheeled on Butler, snarling, every
tooth bared: "Damn you, sir, do you take me for your lackey or
the King's hangman? To hell with you, sir! To hell with your King,
sir! Did you hear me? I said, to hell with your King!"</p>

<p>Butler's face paled in the waning fire-light. Presently he said,
in his slow, even tones: "I shall take care that your good wishes
reach the King's ears. Pray, sir, honour me with your name and
quality, though I may perhaps guess both."</p>

<p>"No need to guess," cut in the big fellow, cheerfully. "I'm Jack
Mount; I burned the <em>Gaspee</em>, I helped dump his Majesty's
tea into Boston harbour, and I should be pleased to do as much
for the King himself. Tell him so, Captain Butler; tell my Lord
Dunmore he can have a ducking, too, at his lordship's polite convenience."</p>

<p>Butler glared at him, but Mount raised his coon-skin cap and
bowed mockingly. "Charmed, sir, charmed," he simpered. "Pray,
permit me to present my comrade, Sir Cade Renard, of the backwood
aristocracy, sometimes called the Weasel. He's so shy, sir. Friend
Weasel, come out from behind that stump and bring your rifle;
step up beside me and make a very fine bow to his Majesty's deputy-sheriff.
Tell the kind gentleman what good men we are, Cade, and how proud
we feel to entertain him."</p>

<p>The Weasel sauntered up and performed a slow, wriggling bow.</p>

<p>"Minions of the moon, sir," he said; "and so charmed to receive
you, or anything you have of value. Your scalp, now, might bring
five shillings at Baton Rouge, or is that but a scratch wig you
wear, sir?"</p>

<p>"Will you deliver me my warrant and my prisoner?" demanded Butler,
with a ghastly smile.</p>

<p>"No!" said Mount, abruptly changing his manner. "Make a new trail,
you Tory hangman! March!" And he gave him a prod with his rifle.</p>

<p>Never had I seen such ferocity expressed on any human face as
I saw now on Mr. Butler's.</p>

<p>He backed out into the brush, at the point of Mount's long rifle;
then the red fire-glow left him, and he was gone into the darkness
of early morning. Presently the Weasel stole after him.</p>

<p>Mount came swaggering back, pausing to drop the warrant on the
hot coals as he passed. Renard returned in a few minutes, took
his rifle, and squatted briskly down just beyond the fire-light.</p>

<p>As Mount came up to me, I rose and thanked him for the protection
he had given so generously, and he laughed and laid one padded
fist on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hark ye, friend," he said; "take your Indian belts and your
pack and go in peace, for if Dunmore is after you, the sooner
you start north the better. Go, lad; I'm not your enemy!"</p>

<p>"I go south," I replied, cautiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, you do, eh?" said Mount, fumbling in his pockets for the
flint he had taken from my rifle. "Are you bound for Cresap's
camp, too?"</p>

<p>"Are you?" I asked, reddening.</p>

<p>He rubbed his chin, watching me with sulky eyes.</p>

<p>"You answer ever with a question!" he complained, fretfully.
"I ask you this and you ask me that&mdash;tom tiddle! tiddle tom!&mdash;and
I be no wiser now for all I have heard your name."</p>

<p>"I know Michael Cardigan," observed the Weasel, quietly coming
up, buckling on his pack.</p>

<p>"It's an honourable name," I began, in desperation, striving
to stop him, but the Weasel ignored me and addressed himself to
Mount.</p>

<p>"He's one of Sir William Johnson's household. That accounts for
those peace-belts of wampum. Shemuel, yonder, knows the lad."</p>

<p>"Oho!" exclaimed Mount, staring at me. "So you come on Sir William's
business to the Cayugas? Ha! Now I begin to grasp this pretty
game. Sir William wishes his Cayugas to sit tight while Cresap
builds forts&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, for God's sake!" I pleaded, seeing that he had guessed
all.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll hush," he replied, eying me with frank curiosity. "I
am no enemy to Sir William. A fairer and more honest gentleman
lives not in these colonies, be he Tory or patriot! Oh, I'll hush,
but every one knows Sir William will not have the Indians take
sides in this same war that's coming so fast upon us. It's no
secret, lad; every pot-house, every tavern tap-room is full o'
gossip that Butler means to rouse the Indians against us, and
that Sir William will not have it!"</p>

<p>"Since when have you come from Johnstown?" I asked, astonished.</p>

<p>"Oh, a week after you left," replied the Weasel. "We saw your
tracks, but we went another way after the first week. You lost
too much time."</p>

<p>Mount had now hoisted his pack to his shoulders and stood watching
Shemuel, the Hebrew peddler, strapping up his dingy boxes, tucking
in bits of lace and ribbon and cheap finery.</p>

<p>"Come on, Shemmy, you pigeon-toed woodchuck!" growled Mount,
cracking a fresh lump of spruce-gum in his glistening teeth.</p>

<p>The little Jew looked up at me slyly, his grimy fists buried
in the bowels of his gewgaws.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the gendleman cares to look at som goots?" he observed,
interrogatively. "I haff chains, buckles, pins, needles, buttons,
laces, knifes, ribbons for queue and gollarettes&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mount, with the toe of his moccasin, gently reversed Shemuel
into one of his own boxes, then warning him to pack up if he valued
his scalp, took my arm in friendly fashion and moved out into
the gray woods.</p>

<p>"Touching this mission of yours to the Cayugas," he said, frankly,
"I see no good to come of it, and I say this with all respect
to Sir William. By-the-bye, Sir William has much to trouble him
these days."</p>

<p>"I know that," said I, sadly.</p>

<p>"Oh no, you don't," smiled Mount. "There have been strange doings
in Johnstown since you left: a change has come in a single week,
lad; neighbours no longer speak; the town is three parts Tory
to one part patriot; even brothers hate each other. Two taverns
known to be the meeting-places of patriots have been set afire
and shot into; and old John Butler is gone north, where, they
say, he is raising a bloody crew of cut-throats, rangers, half-breeds,
and young Mohawks. Sir William is holding long talks with Brant
and Red Jacket at the upper castle. Oh, the sands begin to run
faster now, and men must soon take one side or t'other, for there's
more troops going to Boston, and that means the end of King George!"</p>

<p>I did not perhaps realize the importance of all he said; I had
seen too little of the rebels themselves to credit the seriousness
of the situation. But here was an opportunity to sound Mount on
the Cresap affair, and I began earnestly.</p>

<p>"Can you not see that Colonel Cresap is driving the Cayugas into
the King's ranks?"</p>

<p>"What do we care for the Cayugas?" replied Mount, contemptuously;
and it was in vain I wasted argument on this man who had been
born a woodsman, but who knew the savages only from the outside.
I could not make him see the foolish uselessness of angering the
Six Nations. He was one of that kind who detested all Indians,
who professed to hold them in scorn, and who had passed his life
in killing all he could.</p>

<p>"What are we to do?" he demanded, sarcastically. "Give up the
frontier and go back to Virginia with tails between our legs?"</p>

<p>"Better that than serve as silly tools for Dunmore!" I retorted
hotly.</p>

<p>"Dunmore!" sneered Mount. "We his tools, when the silly ass hasn't
wits to twiddle his own thumbs?"</p>

<p>"He had the wit to send Butler to stop me!" I answered, bitterly.</p>

<p>Mount began to grin again and wink his eyes slyly.</p>

<p>"Butler came for something else, too," he said. "Dunmore's suite
travelled south the day you left, and ought to be in Fortress
Pitt by this hour to-morrow."</p>

<p>"What of it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Ay, that's it, you see. Since you left Johnstown, all are talking
of the new beauty who threw over Walter Butler&mdash;what's her name&mdash;a
certain Miss Warren, ward of Sir William; and it is commonly reported
that the dispute over the Indians and the quarrel betwixt Butler
and Sir William stopped the match."</p>

<p>"What of it!" I broke out, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Only that this beautiful Miss Warren came with Lord Dunmore's
suite to Pittsburg, and Walter Butler has openly boasted he will
marry her spite of Sir William or the devil himself. And here
is the lady&mdash;and here comes her rash gallant tumbling after his
jill!"</p>

<p>To hear her name in the southern wilderness, to hear these things
in this place, told coarsely, told with a wink and a leer, raised
such a black fury in me that I could scarce see the man before
me. As for speaking, my throat closed and my breast heaved as
though to burst the very straps on my pack. Oh, that I had killed
Butler! I clutched my rifle and glared into the gray waste of
misty trees. Somewhere out there that devil was lurking; and when
I had fulfilled my trust I would seek him and end everything for
good and all.</p>

<p>"Are you certain that Miss Warren is already in Pittsburg?" I
managed to ask.</p>

<p>"We saw the ladies and the escort a week since," said Mount.
"The trail is good for horses below Crown Gap, and they were well
mounted, ay, nobly horsed, ladies and troopers, by Heaven! Was
it not a splendid sight, Cade?"</p>

<p>"Gay and godless," replied the Weasel, buckling the straps on
his pack more tightly and shifting the weight with a grunt. "Are
you ready, Jack?"</p>

<p>Mount looked at me.</p>

<p>"Join us and welcome," he said, briefly. "It's safer than going
alone. Our friend, Mr. Sheriff Butler, will be watching for us,
and we mustn't keep the gentleman on tenter-hooks too long, eh,
Cade?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Cade; and we moved off due west, Mount
leading, then Shemuel the peddler, then I, the Weasel trotting
furtively in the rear.</p>

<p>At times the little peddler twisted his greasy neck to look back
at me with an inscrutable expression that puzzled me; but he said
nothing, so I only scowled at him, meaning to imply my disgust
at his treachery. However, as we strung out through the forest,
I quickened my pace and came up beside him, saying, "It was not
very wise of you, Shemuel; the next time you come to our house
you get no permit to peddle."</p>

<p>"Ach!" he said, spreading his fingers in deprecation, "don'd
speag aboud it, Mr. Cardigan. Sir William he has giff me so many
permids mitout a shilling to pay. Oh, sir, he iss a grand gendleman,
Sir William, ain't he?"</p>

<p>"What made you betray my name and quality then, Shemuel?" I asked,
curiously.</p>

<p>His small eyes sought mine, then dropped meekly, as he plodded
on in silence. Nor could I get another word from him; so I fell
back into my place, with a glance at the sun, which was still
shining directly in my face.</p>

<p>"The Fort Pitt trail lies west by south," I suggested, over my
shoulder, to the Weasel.</p>

<p>"There's a shorter cut to Cresap," he replied, cunningly.</p>

<p>"Shorter than the Pitt trail?" I asked, astonished.</p>

<p>"Shorter because healthier," he returned. And, answering my puzzled
smile, he added, "A long life on a long trail, but there's ever
a shorter cut to the gibbet!"</p>

<p>Mount, who had fallen back beside us, grinned at me and rubbed
his nose.</p>

<p>"Butler will be sitting up like a bereaved catamount in the Pitt
trail for us," he said. "I've no powder to waste on him and his
crew. However, Mr. Cardigan, if you want to take a long shot,
now's your chance to mark their hides."</p>

<p>He took me by the arm and led me cautiously a few rods to the
left, then crouched down and parted the bushes with his hand.
We were kneeling on the very edge of a precipice which I never
should have seen, and over which I certainly should have walked
had I been here alone. Deep down below us the Ohio flowed, a dark,
slow stream, with jutting rocks on the eastern bank and a long
flat sand-spit on the west.</p>

<p>At the point of this spit a man was standing, leaning on a rifle.
It was not Butler.</p>

<p>"There's another fellow on that rock," whispered Mount, pointing.
"Butler will be watching the slope below our camp."</p>

<p>"Let him watch it," observed the Weasel; "we'll be with Cresap
by moon-rise!"</p>

<p>"You can take a safe shot from here," smiled Mount, looking around
at me; "but it's too far to go for the scalp."</p>

<p>I shook my head, shuddering, and we resumed our march, filing
away into the west in perfect silence until the sun stood in mid-heaven
and the heated air under the great pines drove us to the nearest
water, which I had been sniffing for some time past.</p>

<p>Resting there to drink, I looked curiously at my three companions.
Such a company I had never beheld. There was the notorious Mount,
a giant in stringy buckskins, with a paw like a bear and a smooth,
boyish face cut by the single, heavy crease of a scar below the
right eye. With his regular features and indolent movements, he
appeared to me like some overgrown village oaf, too stupid to
work, too lazy to try.</p>

<p>Beside him squatted the little Jew, toes turned in, dirty thumbs
joined pensively, musing in his red beard. His boots had left
the foreign mark which I had seen the day before in the trail;
the Weasel's moccasins were those of Albany make.</p>

<p>I examined the Weasel. Such a shrunken, serene, placid little
creature, all hunting-shirt and cap, with two finely chiselled
flat ears, which perhaps gave him that alert allure, as though
eternally listening to some sound behind his back.</p>

<p>But the mouths of these three men were curiously well made, bespeaking
a certain honesty which I began to believe they perhaps possessed
after all. Even Shemuel's mouth, under his thin, red beard, was
not the mouth of treachery, though the lips were shrewd enough,
God wot!</p>

<p>"Well," cried Mount suddenly, "what do you think of us?"</p>

<p>Somewhat embarrassed, I replied politely, but Mount shook his
head.</p>

<p>"You were thinking, what a row of gallows-birds for an honest
man to flock with! Eh? Oh, don't deny it. You can't hurt my feelings,
but you might hurt the Weasel's&mdash;eh, Cade?"</p>

<p>"I have sensitive feelings," said the Weasel dryly.</p>

<p>"I think you all stood by me when I was in distress," said I.
"I ask no more of my friends than that."</p>

<p>"Well, you're a good lad," said Mount, getting to his feet and
patting my shoulder as he passed me.</p>

<p>"Give him something to wreck his life and he'd make a rare ranger,"
observed the Weasel.</p>

<p>"Cade was in love," explained Mount soberly; "weren't you Cade?"</p>

<p>The weazened little man nodded his head and looked up at me sentimentally.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Mount, "Cade was in love and got married. His
wife ran away somewheres&mdash;didn't she Cade?"</p>

<p>Again the little creature nodded, looking soberly at me for sympathy.</p>

<p>"And then," continued Mount, "he just hunted around till he found
me, and we went to hell together&mdash;didn't we, Cade, old friend?"</p>

<p>Two large tears stole down the Weasel's seamy cheeks. He rubbed
them off with his smoky fists, leaving smears beside his nose.</p>

<p>"She took our baby, too," he sniffed; "you forgot that, Jack."</p>

<p>"So I did, so I did," said Mount, pityingly. "Come on, friends,
the sun's sliding galley west, and it's a longer road to the devil
than Boston preachers tell you. Come, Shemmy, old chuck, hoist
that pretty nose up on both feet! Now, Mr. Cardigan!"</p>

<p>We marched on heavily, bearing southwest, descending the great
slope of mountain and table-land which was but a vast roof, shedding
a thousand streams into the slow Ohio, now curving out below us,
red as blood in the kindling coals of sunset.</p>

<p>The river seemed but a mile distant, so clear was the air in
the mountains, but we journeyed on, hour after hour, until the
big yellow moon floated above the hills, and the river faded into
the blue shadows of a splendid night.</p>

<p>Mount had thrown aside all caution now. He strode on ahead, singing
a swinging air with full-chested lungs:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Come, all you Tryon County men,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And never be dismayed,<br/>
But trust in the Lord,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And He will be your aid!"

</p>
</div>
<p>And one by one we all took up the stirring song, singing cheerily
as we marched in file, till the dark forest rang back word for
word.</p>

<p>And I do remember Shemuel, his thumbs in his arm-pits, and cap
over one eye, singing right lustily and footing it proudly beside
Mount.</p>

<p>Suddenly a light twinkled on the edge of a clearing, then another
broke out like a star in the bush, and soon all about us cabin-windows
gleamed brightly and we were marching down a broad road, full
of stones and stumps, and lined on either side by cultivated land
and cabins enclosed in little stockades.</p>

<p>"Shoulder arms! Right wheel!" cried Mount; and we filed between
two block-houses, and across a short bridge, and halted, grounding
arms under the shadow of a squatty fort built with enormous logs.</p>

<p>The sentry had called out the guard, and the corporal in charge
came up to us, lifting his lanthorn. He greeted Mount cheerfully,
nodding and smiling at Renard also.</p>

<p>"Who the devil is this he-goat with red whiskers?" he demanded,
illuminating Shemuel's cheerful features.</p>

<p>"Friend of liberty," said Mount, in a low voice. "Is Colonel
Cresap in the fort, corporal?"</p>

<p>"No," said the corporal, looking hard at me; "he's off somewhere.
Who is this gentleman, Jack?"</p>

<p>I looked at Mount, perhaps appealingly, wondering what he would
say.</p>

<p>But he did not hesitate; he laid his great paw on my shoulder
and said, "He's a good lad, corporal; give him a bed and a bowl
o' porridge, and it's a kindness to Jack Mount you will do."</p>

<p>Then he held out his hand to me, and I took it.</p>

<p>"Good-night lad," he said, heartily. "We'll meet again to-morrow.
I've a few friends to see to-night. Sleep tight to the bed and
think not too much ill of this same Catamount Jack they write
books about."</p>

<p>The Weasel sidled up and offered his small, dry hand.</p>

<p>"If you were ruined," he said, regretfully, "you'd make a rare
wood-runner."</p>

<p>I thanked him uncertainly and returned Shemuel's low obeisance
with an unforgiving nod.</p>

<p>"Pray, follow me, sir," said the corporal, with a civil bow,
and I walked after him through the postern, out across the moonlit
parade, and into the western barracks, where he lighted me to
a tiny casemate and pointed to a door.</p>

<p>"We have messed, but there's some cold meat and a jug of cider
for you," he said, affably. "Yonder's a bucket of water, and I'll
leave this lanthorn for you. Open that door, and you'll find food
and drink. Good-night, sir."</p>

<p>"Good-night," I said, "and pardon my importunity, but I have
a message for Colonel Cresap."</p>

<p>"He returns to the fort to-morrow," said the soldier. Then, lingering,
he asked the news from Boston and whether any more troops had
been sent thither. But I did not know and he retired presently,
whistling "The White Cockade," and making passes at the moonbeams
with his bright bayonet.</p>

<p>As for me, I sat down on the bed, and slipping my sack from my
shoulders, I rolled over on the blanket, meaning only to close
my eyes for a minute. But dawn was shining in through the loopholes
of the casemate ere I unclosed my eyes to the world again, and
the drums and fifes were playing, the sun above the horizon.</p>

<p>Bang! went a cannon from the parapet, and, leaning out of the
porthole, I saw the flag of England crawling up the halyards over
my head.</p>

<p>I sprang out of bed, and without waiting for food, though I was
half famished, I dressed hurriedly and ran out across the parade
to the postern.</p>

<p>"How far is the Cayuga castle?" I asked the sentinel.</p>

<p>"About a mile up the river," he replied, adding: "It's not very
safe to go there just now. The Indians have been restless these
three weeks, and I guess there's deviltry hatching yonder."</p>

<p>"Don't they come in to the village at all?" I inquired, glancing
around at half a dozen men who had gathered at the postern to
watch the morning parade.</p>

<p>"There's a Cayuga, now," said the sentry, pointing to a short,
blanketed figure squatting outside the drawbridge.</p>

<p>I walked across the bridge and approached the Indian, who immediately
rose when he saw me, as though he expected ill-treatment, a kick
perhaps. The movement was full of sad significance to me, like
the cowering of a mistreated hound. Shame to those who inspire
cringing in beasts! Double dishonour on those before whom men
cower!</p>

<p>So this was the result of Cresap's coming! I saw it all in an
instant; the bullying, overbearing pioneers were here to stay,
backed by cannon and fort and a thousand long rifles, backed,
too, by my Lord Dunmore, to play for a stake, the winning of which
meant woe unspeakable to my native land.</p>

<p>The Indian was watching me sullenly. I held out my hand and said:
"Peace, brother. I am a belt-bearer."</p>

<p>There was a silence. After a moment he took my hand.</p>

<p>"Peace, bearer of belts," he said, quietly.</p>

<p>"Our council fire is at Onondaga," I said.</p>

<p>"It burns on the Ohio, too," he replied, gravely.</p>

<p>"It burns at both doors of the Long House," I said. "Go to your
sachems and wise men. Say to them that Quider is dead; that the
three clans who mourn shall be raised up; that Sir William has
sent six belts to the Cayuga. I bear them."</p>

<p>He stared at me for a full minute, then gravely turned north,
across the cleared land, drawing his scarlet blanket over his
face.</p>

<p>All that morning I waited patiently for Mount to come, believing
that he might have some friend in the village who would give me
a lodging where I could lie hid until Colonel Cresap returned
to the fort.</p>

<p>Whether Butler had gone on to Pittsburg or whether he still lay
in ambush for me below Crown Gap, I did not know.</p>

<p>One thing was clear: I could not remain at the fort without risk
of arrest if Butler arrived in Cresap's camp with a new warrant.
Every moment I tarried here in the barracks might bring danger
nearer; yet, where was I to go?</p>

<p>Bitterly disappointed at the news that Cresap was in Pittsburg,
I durst not, however, journey thither in search of him, for fear
he might have started to return, and so risk passing him on the
trails, of which there were seven that traversed the forest betwixt
Pittsburg Fortress and Cresap's camp. And on the morrow, too,
must I needs deliver my belts to the Cayugas at their castle.
This was even more important than intercepting Colonel Cresap;
for I might gain Cresap by argument, even though he returned here
with fresh instructions from Lord Dunmore, and his mind poisoned
against me by Walter Butler; but I, personally, could hope to
wield no influence with the Cayugas save by what authority was
invested in me through Sir William's wampum pledges.</p>

<p>However, spite of my dangerous predicament, I was ravenously
hungry, and made out to clean my platter and bowl as many times
as they cared to replenish it. Then I thanked my host, the corporal,
and we shook hands in friendly fashion, he inquiring when I expected
my friend Mount to return for me, and I replying that I did not
know, but would make ready to join him at once.</p>

<p>The corporal, whose name was Paul Cloud, a New York man by birth,
aided me to strap on my pack, conversing the while most agreeably,
and finally, when I was prepared, he accompanied me to the parade-ground,
where two companies of Virginia militia were drilling on the grass.</p>

<p>"My duties take me to the south stockade," he said, once more
offering his hand. And again I thanked him for his hospitality
so warmly that he seemed a trifle surprised.</p>

<p>"What friend of liberty could expect less?" he protested, smiling.
"Are you a recent recruit, sir, that you marvel at the good-fellowship
among us?"</p>

<p>"Are you, too, of that fellowship?" I exclaimed, amazed to find
rebels in uniform.</p>

<p>He looked at me rather blankly.</p>

<p>"You'll scarce find a Tory in the regiment," he said, beginning
to be amused at my ignorance. "As for Colonel Cresap's colonists
yonder, I'll warrant them all save some two score malignants like
Greathouse, the store-keeper, and the company he keeps."</p>

<p>His unsuspicious assumption that I was a rebel placed me in a
most delicate and unhappy position. I knew not what to say nor
how to explain the misunderstanding without, perhaps, seriously
damaging Jack Mount, who had vouched for me&mdash;as a friend, I supposed,
not as a rebel comrade.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I do not merit your confidence in matters touching
the fellowship to which you and my friend Mount adhere," I said,
stiffly, determined not to wear false colours. "I am not a patriot,
corporal, and Jack Mount meant only a kindness to a brother man
in distress."</p>

<p>Cloud cut me short with a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"I guess Jack Mount knows what he is about," he said, clapping
me on the shoulder. "Half our men are somewhat backward and distrustful,
like you; but I'll warrant them when the time comes! Oh, I know
them! It's your fawning, slavering, favour-currying Tory that
I shy at! Ay, the man who snatches the very speech from between
your teeth to agree with you. None o' that kind for me. I know
them."</p>

<p>He stood there, serene, smiling, with folded arms, his kindly
eyes void of all distrust; and I thought to myself that such a
man must needs have at least an honest grievance to oppose his
King withal.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, abruptly, "time is on the wing, friend. So fare
you pleasantly, and &mdash;God save our country!"</p>

<p>"Amen," I replied, before I realized that I had acknowledged
the famous patriots' greeting. He turned around to laugh significantly,
then walked away towards the sallyport, swinging his hanger contentedly.</p>

<p>Ill-pleased with my bungling in such a delicate situation, and
greatly disturbed at having implied my adherence to this fellowship
of which I yet knew nothing, I stood on the parade, biting my
lips in vexation and wondering where in the world to go.</p>

<p>The two companies of Virginia militia were marching and counter-marching
at "support," halberdiers guiding, drummers and fifers leading
off, and a long, lean major pacing to and fro, and watching the
two captains with keen, wrinkled eyes.</p>

<p>The militia were mostly Virginians born, tall, stout fellows,
smartly uniformed in drab and scarlet, and wearing the bugle on
their cross-belts, indicating them to be light infantry. Truly,
they wheeled and halted and marched and counter-marched most adroitly,
carefully preserving distances and alignment; and I thought the
major a martinet that he found nothing but fault with the officers
and men. Certainly they paraded perfectly, their black knee-gaitered
legs moving in unison, their muskets steady, their left arms swinging
as one, which interested me because, in our militia of Tryon County,
to swing the free arm is not allowed.</p>

<p>But I had no business to linger here; I felt that every minute
redoubled my danger. Yet again I asked myself where under heaven
I could go, and I thought bitterly of Mount for leaving me here
neglected.</p>

<p>Plainly the first thing to be done was to get out of the fort.
This I accomplished without the slightest trouble, nobody questioning
me; and I shortly found myself in the road which appeared to be
the main street of Cresap's village.</p>

<p>The fort, I now perceived, stood on a low hill in the centre
of cleared ground. The road encircled the fort, then ran west
through a roughly cultivated country, dotted with cabins of logs
plastered over with blue clay. The circumference of the village
itself appeared to be inconsiderable. Everywhere the dark circle
of the forest seemed to crowd in the desolate hamlet; I say desolate,
for indeed the scene was grim, even for the frontier. The whole
country had a black appearance from the thousands of charred roots
and stumps which choked the fields. Dead trees lay in heaps, stark
patches of dead pines stood like gray spectres, blasted hemlocks,
with foliage seared rusty, lined the landscape, marking the zones
doomed to cultivation. These latter were girdled trees, but I
saw no attempt to preserve any trees for shade around the cabins,
or for shade along the fences, or for beauty.</p>

<p>We in Johnstown never girdled the bush without preserving rows
of trees to ornament roads and fields, and this dismal destruction
by fire and axe reacted on my sombre thoughts, depressing me dolefully.</p>

<p>Under a leaden sky, through which a pale sun peered fitfully,
the blackened waste about me seemed horrible and ominous of horrors
to come; the very soil in the fields was black with charcoal,
through which the young corn struggled up into the fading sunshine
as though strangling.</p>

<p>Cresap's Maryland colonists were busy everywhere with harrow
and plough and axe and spade. The encircling woods echoed and
re-echoed with their chopping; their voices rang out, guiding
the slow ox-teams among the stumps. At intervals the crack of
a rifle signalled the death of some partridge or squirrel close
by.</p>

<p>There were men in the fields labouring half-naked at the unyielding
roots; men in linen shirts and smalls, planting or weeding; men
moving in distant fields, aimlessly perhaps, perhaps planning
a rough home, perhaps a grave.</p>

<p>Women sometimes passed along the paths, urging gaunt cattle to
gaunter pasture; children peered from high door-sills, hung from
unpainted windows, quarrelled in bare door-yards, half seen through
stockades; some chopped fire-wood, some carried water, some played
in the ditches or sailed chips in the dark, slow stream that crawled
out across the land towards the Ohio.</p>

<p>And here and there, on little knolls dotting the scene, tall
riflemen stood, leaning on their weapons; sentinels mounting guard
over flock and family below.</p>

<p>I looked at the flag on the fort; its dull folds hung dark and
lifeless under a darkening sky. Below it paced a sentry to and
fro, to and fro, with the gray light on his musket shining dimly.</p>

<p>I looked towards the black woods. They seemed to promise more
protection than fort and flag; there was less gloom under their
branches than under these sad cabin-roofs.</p>

<p>Unconsciously I began to walk towards the forest, yet with no
idea what I should do there. A child here and there saluted me
from stockade gates; now and then an anxious woman's face appeared
at a window, watching me out of sight along the charred road.
Presently I passed a double log-house, from the eaves of which
dangled a green bush. The door bore a painted sign-board also,
representing a large house with arms and legs like a man, at which
I puzzled, but could not guess the significance.</p>

<p>I needed salt, having for the last week used white-wood ashes
to savour my corn withal, so I entered the tavern and made known
my needs to a coarse-featured, thick-set fellow, who lay in a
chair smoking a clay pipe.</p>

<p>He rose instanter, all bows and smiles and cringing to my orders,
begging me to be seated until he could find the salt sack in the
cellar; and I sat down, after saluting the company, which consisted
of half a dozen men playing cards by the window.</p>

<p>They all returned my salute, some leaning clear around to look
at me; and although they resumed their game I noticed that they
began talking in whispers, pausing sometimes in a shuffle to turn
their eyes on me.</p>

<p>Presently the landlord came in with my small bag of salt, and
set it on the scales with many a bow and smirk at me to beg indulgence
for his delay.</p>

<p>"You have travelled far, sir," he said, pointedly; "there is
northern mud on your hunting-shirt and southern burrs on your
legging fringe. Ha! A stroke, sir! Touched, by your leave, sir!
I have run the forests myself, sir, and I read as I run &mdash;I
read as I run."</p>

<p>He was tying my sack up with grass, clumsily I thought for one
who had lived as a forest-runner. But I waited patiently, he meanwhile
conversing most politely. In fact, I could find no opportunity
to courteously make an end to his garrulous chatter, and, ere
I could refuse or prevent it, he had persuaded me to a pewter
of home-brew and had set it before me, brimming with good stout
foam.</p>

<p>"No water there, sir!" he observed, proudly; "body and froth
hum like bee-hives in August! It is my own, sir, my own, barrel
and malt and hops!"</p>

<p>I could do no less than taste the ale, and he picked up his pipe
and begged the honour of sitting in my presence: all of which
ceremony revealed to me that my language and bearing were not
at all in concord with my buckskin and my pack, and that he was
quite aware of the discrepancy.</p>

<p>"Perchance, sir, you have news from Boston?" he asked, with a
jolly laugh.</p>

<p>I shook my head. The company at the table by the window had paused
to listen.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he said, puffing his long clay into a glow, "these
be parlous times, sir, the world over! And, between ourselves,
sir, begging your pardon for the familiarity, sir, I have been
wondering myself whether the King is wholly right."</p>

<p>The stillness in the room was intense.</p>

<p>"Doubt," said I, carelessly, "is no friend to loyalty."</p>

<p>I was drinking when I finished this choice philosophy, but through
the glass bottom of my pewter I surprised a very cunning squint
in his puffy eyes.</p>

<p>"Oho!" thought I, "you wish to know my politics, eh? Let us see
how much you'll find out!" And I set down my pewter with a sigh
of contentment and tossed him a shilling for my reckoning.</p>

<p>"But," he suggested, "cannot even the King be deceived by unscrupulous
counsellors?"</p>

<p>"The King should know better than you whether his ministers be
what you accuse them of being," I said, seriously.</p>

<p>"I meant no accusation," he said, hastily; "but I voiced the
sentiments of many honest neighbours of mine."</p>

<p>"Sentiments which smack somewhat of treason," I interrupted,
coldly.</p>

<p>Through the bottom of my mug again I saw he was still far from
satisfied concerning my real sentiments. I listened as I drank:
the card-players behind me were not playing.</p>

<p>"Landlord," I asked, carelessly, cutting short another argument,
"what may your tavern sign mean with its house running loose on
a pair o' legs?"</p>

<p>"It is my own name, sir," he laughed, "Greathouse! I flatter
me there is some small wit in the conceit, sir, though I painted
yon sign myself!"</p>

<p>So this was Greathouse, a notorious loyalist&mdash;this bloated lout
who had been prying and picking at me to learn my sentiments?
The slyness of the fellow disgusted me, and I could scarce control
my open aversion, though I did succeed in leaving him with his
suspicions lulled, and got out of the house without administering
to him the kick which my leg was itching for.</p>

<p>From the corner of my eye I could see the card-players watching
me from the window; it incensed me to be so spied upon, and I
was glad when a turn in the scurvy, rutted road shut me out of
their vision.</p>

<p>There were several houses just beyond me to the left; one displayed
a holly-bush and wrinkled berries, a signal to me to avoid it,
and I should have done so had I not perceived Jack Mount loafing
in the doorway, and Shemuel seated on the horse-block, eating
a dish of fish with his fingers.</p>

<p>From the blotched face and false smile of Greathouse to the filthy
company of Shemuel was no advantage. If these two creatures were
representatives of their respective causes, I had small stomach
for either them or their parties. Tory and patriot, pot-licker
and Jew, they disgusted me; and I returned Mount's cheery salute
with a sullen nod, not pausing at the house as I passed by.</p>

<p>He came out into the road after me, asking what had gone amiss;
and I told him he had left me at the fort without advice or counsel,
and that I had quitted the barracks, not caring to be caught there
by Butler and his warrant.</p>

<p>"Shame on you, lad, for the thought!" said Mount, angrily. "Do
you think we do things by halves, Cade and I? The Weasel has been
in touch with Butler's men all night, ready to warn you the moment
they started for this camp! He's asleep in there, now," jerking
his huge thumb towards the inn, "and I've just returned from seeing
Butler well on the trail towards Pittsburg."</p>

<p>Mortified and ashamed at my complaint, and deeply touched by
the quiet kindness of these two men who had, spite of fatigue,
voluntarily set out to watch while I slept, I silently offered
my hand to Mount. He took it fretfully, complaining that all the
world had always misunderstood him as I had, and vowing he would
never more do kindness to man or beast or good red herring!</p>

<p>"Small blame if the world requites your generosity as stupidly
as I do," said I; whereat he fell a-laughing and drew me with
him into the tavern, vowing we should wash out all bitterness
in a draught of ale.</p>

<p>The inn, which was called "The Leather Bottle," appeared to be
clean though rough. Tables and chairs were massive, hewn out of
buckeye; horn instead of glass filled the tiny squares in the
window frames, and a shelf ran around the tap-room just below
the loopholes, whereon men could stand to fire in any direction.</p>

<p>Mount presented me to a young man in homespun who had been sitting
by the chimney, reading a letter&mdash;a quiet, modest gentleman of
thirty, perhaps, somewhat travel-stained and spotted with reddish
mud, which proclaimed him an arrival from the south.</p>

<p>He gave me a firm, cool clasp of the hand and a curiously sharp
yet not unkindly smile, promising to join us when he had finished
the letter he was reading.</p>

<p>I had meant to tell Mount of my conversations with Corporal Cloud
and with Greathouse, but hesitated because the smallness of the
room would carry even a whisper to the stranger by the chimney.</p>

<p>Mount must have divined my intentions, for he said, in his hearty,
deep-chested voice, "You may say what you please here, Mr. Cardigan,
and trust this gentleman from Maryland as you trust me, I hope."</p>

<p>I had not caught the name of the young man from Maryland, and
was diffident about asking. He looked up from his letter with
a brief smile and nod at us, and we sat down beside one of the
hewn buckeye tables and called upon the tap-boy for home-brew.</p>

<p>I began by telling Mount very frankly that he had put me in a
false position as a rebel. I retailed my conversation with Corporal
Cloud, how I had felt it dishonourable to accept hospitality under
a misunderstanding, and how I had deemed it necessary to confess
me. But this only appeared to amuse Mount, who laughed at me maliciously
over his brown tankard and sucked in the frothy ale with unfeigned
smacks of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Tiddle&mdash;diddle&mdash;diddle! Who the devil cares!" he said. "I wish
half of our patriots possessed your tender conscience, friend
Michael."</p>

<p>I swallowed a draught in silence, not at all pleased to feel
myself forced into a position whither it appeared everybody was
conspiring to drive me.</p>

<p>"I'm loyal to the King," I said, bluntly; "and when I am ready
to renounce him, I shall do so, not before."</p>

<p>"Certainly," observed Mount, complacently.</p>

<p>"Not that I care for Tory company, either," I added, in disgust,
thinking of my encounter with Greathouse. And I related the affair
to Mount.</p>

<p>The big fellow's eyes narrowed and he set his tankard down with
a bang.</p>

<p>"A sneak!" he said. "A sly, mealy-mouthed sneak! Look out for
this fellow Greathouse, my friend. By Heaven, I'm sorry he saw
you! You can depend upon it the news of your arrival here will
be carried to Butler. Why, this fellow, Greathouse, is a notorious
creature of Lord Dunmore, set here to spy on Colonel Cresap and
see that the militia have no commerce with rebel emissaries from
Boston. Gad, had I not believed you trusted me, and that you would
sit snug in the fort yonder instead of paying calls of state on
all the Tories in town&mdash;"</p>

<p>He took a pull at the fresh tankard, set it down two-thirds empty,
and lay back in his chair, licking his lips thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"How long do you stay here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Until I deliver my belts&mdash;that will be to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I thought you wished to see Colonel Cresap, too?" he said.</p>

<p>"I do; he will return to-day they tell me."</p>

<p>Mount leaned over the table, folding his arms under his chest.</p>

<p>"Hark ye, friend Michael," he said. "Colonel Cresap, three-quarters
of the militia, and all save a score or so of these villagers
here are patriots. The Maryland pioneers mean to make a home here
for themselves, Indians or no Indians, and it will be little use
for you to plead with Colonel Cresap, who could not call off his
people if he would."</p>

<p>"If he is a true patriot," I said, "how can he deliberately drive
the Six Nations to take up arms against the colonies?"</p>

<p>"What you don't understand," replied Mount, "is that Colonel
Cresap's people hold the Indians at small account. They are here
and they mean to stay here, spite of Sir William Johnson and the
Cayugas."</p>

<p>"But can't you see that it's Dunmore's policy to bring on a clash?"
I exclaimed, in despair. "If Cresap is conciliatory towards the
Cayugas, can't you see that Dunmore will stir up such men as Butler
and Greathouse to commit some act of violence? I tell you, Dunmore
means to have a war started here which will forever turn the Six
Nations against us."</p>

<p>"Against <em>us</em>?" said Mount, meaningly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;<em>us</em>!" I exclaimed. "If it be treason to oppose
such a monstrous crime as that which Lord Dunmore contemplates,
then I am guilty! If to be a patriot means to resist such men
as Dunmore and Butler&mdash;ay, and our Governor Tryon, too, who knows
what is being done and says nothing!&mdash;if to defend the land of
one's birth against the plots of these men makes me an enemy to
the King, why&mdash;why, then," I ended, violently, "I am the King's
enemy to the last blood drop in my body!"</p>

<p>There was a silence. I sat there with clinched fist on the table,
teeth set, realizing what I had said, glad that I had said it,
grimly determined to stand by every word I had uttered.</p>

<p>"Lord Dunmore represents the King," said Mount, smiling.</p>

<p>"Prove it to me and I am a rebel from this moment!" I cried.</p>

<p>"But Lord Dunmore is only doing his duty," urged Mount. "His
Majesty needs allies."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that Lord Dunmore is provoking war here at
the King's command?" I asked, in horror.</p>

<p>The young man by the chimney stood up and bent his pleasant eyes
on me.</p>

<p>"I have here," he said, tapping the letter in his hand, "my Lord
Dunmore's commission as major-general of militia, and his Majesty's
permission to enlist a thousand savages to serve under me in the
event of rebellion in these colonies!"</p>

<p>I had risen to my feet at the sound of the stranger's voice;
Mount, too, had risen, tankard in hand.</p>

<p>"I am further authorized," said the young stranger, coolly, "by
command of my Lord Dunmore, to offer ¬£12 sterling for every rebel
scalp taken by these Indian allies of his most Christian Majesty."</p>

<p>At that I went cold and fell a-trembling.</p>

<p>"By God!" I stammered. "By the blood of man!&mdash;this is too much&mdash;this
is too&mdash;"</p>

<p>Crash! went Mount's tankard on the table; and, turning to the
young stranger with a bow, "I bring you a new recruit, Colonel
Cresap," he said, quietly; "will you administer the oath, sir?"</p>

<p>Thunderstruck, I stared at the silent young man in his gray woollen
hunting-shirt and cloth gaiters who stood there, grave eyes bent
on me, tearing at the edge of his paper with his white teeth.</p>

<p>"Pray, be seated, Mr. Cardigan," he said, smiling. "I know you
have a message for me from Sir William Johnson. I hold it an honour
to receive commands from such an honourable and upright gentleman."</p>

<p>He drew up a heavy buckeye chair, motioning Mount and me to be
seated; the tap-boy brought his tankard; he tasted it sparingly,
and leaned back, waiting for me to speak.</p>

<p>If my speech was halting or ill-considered, my astonishment at
the identity of the stranger was to blame; but I spoke earnestly
and without reserve, and my very inexperience must have pleaded
with him, for he listened patiently and kindly, even when I told
him, with some heat, that the whole land would hold him responsible
for an outbreak on the frontier.</p>

<p>When I had finished, he thanked me for coming, and begged me
to convey his cordial gratitude to Sir William. Then he began
his defence, very modestly and with frankest confession that he
had been trapped by Dunmore into a pitfall, the existence of which
he had never dreamed of.</p>

<p>"I am to-day," he said, "the Moses of these people, inasmuch
as I have, at Lord Dunmore's command, led them into this promised
land. God knows it was the blind who led the blind. And now, for
months, I have been aware that Dunmore wishes a clash with the
Cayugas yonder; but, until Sir William Johnson opened my eyes,
I have never understood why Lord Dunmore desired war."</p>

<p>He looked at Mount as though to ask whether that notorious forest-runner
had suspected Dunmore; and Mount shook his head with a sneer.</p>

<p>"He is a witless ass," he muttered. "I see nothing in Mr. Cardigan's
fears that Dunmore means trouble here."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> do," said Cresap, calmly. "Sir William is right;
we have been tricked into this forest. Why, Jack, it's perfectly
plain to me now. This very commission in my hands, here, proves
the existence of every missing link in the chain of conspiracy.
This commission is made out for the purpose of buying my loyalty
to Dunmore. Can't you see?"</p>

<p>Mount shook his head.</p>

<p>Cresap flushed faintly and turned to me.</p>

<p>"What can I do, Mr. Cardigan? I have led these people here, but
I cannot lead them back. Do you think they would follow me in
a retreat? You do not know them. If I should argue with them every
day for a year, I could not induce a single man to abandon the
cabin he has built or the morsel of charred earth he has planted.
And where should I lead them? I have nothing behind me to offer
them. Virginia is over-populated. I have no land to give them
except this, granted by the King&mdash;granted in spite of his royal
oath, now broken to the Cayugas.</p>

<p>"You say the whole country will hold me responsible. I cannot
help that, though God must know how unjust it would be.</p>

<p>"Were I to counsel the abandonment of this fort and village,
Lord Dunmore would arrest me and clap me into Fort Pitt. Is it
not better for me to stay here among these people who trust me?
Is it not better that I remain and labour among my people in the
cause of liberty?</p>

<p>"I can do nothing while a royal Governor governs Virginia. But
if the time ever comes when our Boston brothers sound the call
to arms, I can lead six hundred riflemen out of this forest, whose
watchword will be, 'Liberty or Death!'"</p>

<p>He had grown pale while speaking; two bright scarlet patches
flamed under his cheek-bones; he coughed painfully and rested
his head on his hand.</p>

<p>"Go to your Cayugas," he said, catching his breath. "Tell them
the truth, or as much of the truth as Sir William's wisdom permits.
I am here to watch, to watch such crafty agents as Greathouse,
and young Walter Butler, whom I met on the Pitt trail three hours
since. Oh, I understand the situation now, Mr. Cardigan."</p>

<p>He tasted his ale once more, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Keep Sir William's Cayugas quiet if you can," he said. "I will
watch Dunmore's agents that they do nothing to bring on war. I
may fail, but I will do what I can. When do you speak to the Cayugas
with belts?"</p>

<p>"At dawn," I replied, soberly.</p>

<p>"Poor devils," said Cresap, sadly, "poor, tricked, cheated, and
plundered devils! This is their land. I should never have come
had not Dunmore assured me the Cayugas had been paid for the country.
And there is their great sachem, Logan, called 'The Friend of
the White Man.' Greathouse has made a drunken sot of Logan, and
all his family down to the tiny maid of ten. Ay, sir, I have seen
Logan's children lying drunk in the road there by Greathouse's
tavern&mdash;poor, little babies of twelve and ten, stark-naked, lying
drunk in the rain!"</p>

<p>After a moment I asked why he had not expelled this fiend, Greathouse,
and he replied that he had, but that Dunmore had sent him back
under his special protection.</p>

<p>"What on earth can I do?" he repeated. "The Cayuga camp is rotten
with whiskey. Their chiefs and sachems come to me and beg me to
forbid the sale. I am powerless; for back of me stands Lord Dunmore
in the shape of Greathouse. By God, sir, the man is a nightmare
to me!"</p>

<p>"Why not twist his gullet?" observed Mount.</p>

<p>Cresap paid him no attention, and the big fellow pouted, muttering
that it was a simple thing to exterminate vermin.</p>

<p>As we sat there, I heard the rain drumming against the horn panes
in the window. The room had grown very dark.</p>

<p>Cresap rose, holding out his hand to me.</p>

<p>"Shall I administer the oath of fellowship, my friend?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not yet," I replied, taking his hand.</p>

<p>"When you are ready, Mr. Cardigan," he said, simply. "Will you
lodge here? That is well; the fort is not safe. And, if I mistake
not, young Butler will be here to-morrow to search for you. He
begged me to have you arrested should you be in my camp."</p>

<p>"I shall be at the Cayuga castle by dawn," I said.</p>

<p>"And after that?" inquired Mount. "You are not going to leave
us, are you, lad?"</p>

<p>"I have my message to deliver to Sir William," I answered, earnestly;
"and," I added, "truly, I do not believe there is anything on
earth that can prevent my delivering my message, nor retard my
returning and slaying this frightful enemy of mankind, Walter
Butler."</p>
