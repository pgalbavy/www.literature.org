<p>The round moon was white and at its smallest, high overhead,
when I stepped out of the phaeton in which Miss Elizabeth sent
me back to Madame Brossard's; midnight was twanging from a rusty
old clock indoors as I crossed the fragrant courtyard to my pavilion;
but a lamp still burned in the salon of the "Grande Suite," a
light to my mind more suggestive of the patient watcher than of
the scholar at his tome.</p>

<p>When my own lamp was extinguished, I set my door ajar, moved
my bed out from the wall to catch whatever breeze might stir,
"composed myself for the night," as it used to be written, and
lay looking out upon the quiet garden where a thin white haze
was rising. If, in taking this coign of vantage, I had any subtler
purpose than to seek a draught against the warmth of the night,
it did not fail of its reward, for just as I had begun to drowse,
the gallery steps creaked as if beneath some immoderate weight,
and the noble form of Keredec emerged upon my field of vision.
From the absence of the sound of footsteps I supposed him to be
either barefooted or in his stockings. His visible costume consisted
of a sleeping jacket tucked into a pair of trousers, while his
tousled hair and beard and generally tossed and rumpled look were
those of a man who had been lying down temporarily.</p>

<p>I heard him sigh&mdash;like one sighing for sleep&mdash;as he went noiselessly
across the garden and out through the archway to the road. At
that I sat straight up in bed to stare&mdash;and well I might, for
here was a miracle! He had lifted his arms above his head to stretch
himself comfortably, and he walked upright and at ease, whereas
when I had last seen him, the night before, he had been able to
do little more than crawl, bent far over and leaning painfully
upon his friend. Never man beheld a more astonishing recovery
from a bad case of rheumatism!</p>

<p>After a long look down the road, he retraced his steps; and the
moonlight, striking across his great forehead as he came, revealed
the furrows ploughed there by an anxiety of which I guessed the
cause. The creaking of the wooden stairs and gallery and the whine
of an old door announced that he had returned to his vigil.</p>

<p>I had, perhaps, a quarter of an hour to consider this performance,
when it was repeated; now, however, he only glanced out into the
road, retreating hastily, and I saw that he was smiling, while
the speed he maintained in returning to his quarters was remarkable
for one so newly convalescent.</p>

<p>The next moment Saffron came through the archway, ascended the
steps in turn&mdash;but slowly and carefully, as if fearful of waking
his guardian&mdash;and I heard his door closing, very gently. Long
before his arrival, however, I had been certain of his identity
with the figure I had seen gazing up at the terraces of Quesnay
from the borders of the grove. Other questions remained to bother
me: Why had Keredec not prevented this night-roving, and why,
since he did permit it, should he conceal his knowledge of it
from Oliver? And what, oh, what wondrous specific had the mighty
man found for his disease?</p>

<p>Morning failed to clarify these mysteries; it brought, however,
something rare and rich and strange. I allude to the manner of
Amedee's approach. The aged gossip-demoniac had to recognise the
fact that he could not keep out of my way for ever; there was
nothing for it but to put as good a face as possible upon a bad
business, and get it over&mdash;and the face he selected was a marvel;
not less, and in no hasty sense of the word.</p>

<p>It appeared at my door to announce that breakfast waited outside.</p>

<p>Primarily it displayed an expression of serenity, masterly in
its assumption that not the least, remotest, dreamiest shadow
of danger could possibly be conceived, by the most immoderately
pessimistic and sinister imagination, as even vaguely threatening.
And for the rest, you have seen a happy young mother teaching
first steps to the first-born&mdash;that was Amedee. Radiantly tender,
aggressively solicitous, diffusing ineffable sweetness on the
air, wreathed in seraphic smiles, beaming caressingly, and aglow
with a sacred joy that I should be looking so well, he greeted
me in a voice of honey and bowed me to my repast with an unconcealed
fondness at once maternal and reverential.</p>

<p>I did not attempt to speak. I came out silently, uncannily fascinated,
my eyes fixed upon him, while he moved gently backward, cooing
pleasant words about the coffee, but just perceptibly keeping
himself out of arm's reach until I had taken my seat. When I had
done that, he leaned over the table and began to set useless things
nearer my plate with frankly affectionate care. It chanced that
in "making a long arm" to reach something I did want, my hand
(of which the fingers happened to be closed) passed rather impatiently
beneath his nose. The madonna expression changed instantly to
one of horror, he uttered a startled croak, and took a surprisingly
long skip backward, landing in the screen of honeysuckle vines,
which, he seemed to imagine, were some new form of hostility attacking
him treacherously from the rear. They sagged, but did not break
from their fastenings, and his behaviour, as he lay thus entangled,
would have contrasted unfavourably in dignity with the actions
of a panic-stricken hen in a hammock.</p>

<p>"And so conscience <em>DOES </em>make cowards of us all," I said,
with no hope of being understood.</p>

<p>Recovering some measure of mental equilibrium at the same time
that he managed to find his feet, he burst into shrill laughter,
to which he tried in vain to impart a ring of debonair carelessness.</p>

<p>"Eh, I stumble!" he cried with hollow merriment. "I fall about
and faint with fatigue! Pah! But it is nothing: truly!"</p>

<p>"Fatigue!" I turned a bitter sneer upon him. "Fatigue! And you
just out of bed!"</p>

<p>His fat hands went up palm outward; his heroic laughter was checked
as with a sob; an expression of tragic incredulity shone from
his eyes. Patently he doubted the evidence of his own ears; could
not believe that such black ingratitude existed in the world.
"Absalom, O my son Absalom!" was his unuttered cry. His hands
fell to his sides; his chin sank wretchedly into its own folds;
his shirt-bosom heaved and crinkled; arrows of unspeakable injustice
had entered the defenceless breast.</p>

<p>"Just out of bed!" he repeated, with a pathos that would have
brought the judge of any court in France down from the bench to
kiss him&mdash;"And I had risen long, long before the dawn, in the
cold and darkness of the night, to prepare the sandwiches of monsieur!"</p>

<p>It was too much for me, or rather, he was. I stalked off to the
woods in a state of helpless indignation; mentally swearing that
his day of punishment at my hands was only deferred, not abandoned,
yet secretly fearing that this very oath might live for no purpose
but to convict me of perjury. His talents were lost in the country;
he should have sought his fortune in the metropolis. And his manner,
as he summoned me that evening to dinner, and indeed throughout
the courses, partook of the subtle condescension and careless
assurance of one who has but faintly enjoyed some too easy triumph.</p>

<p>I found this so irksome that I might have been goaded into an
outbreak of impotent fury, had my attention not been distracted
by the curious turn of the professor's malady, which had renewed
its painful assault upon him. He came hobbling to table, leaning
upon Saffren's shoulder, and made no reference to his singular
improvement of the night before&mdash;nor did I. His rheumatism was
his own; he might do what he pleased with it! There was no reason
why he should confide the cause of its vagaries to me.</p>

<p>Table-talk ran its normal course; a great Pole's philosophy receiving
flagellation at the hands of our incorrigible optimist. ("If he
could understand," exclaimed Keredec, "that the individual must
be immortal before it is born, ha! then this babbler might have
writted some intelligence!") On the surface everything was as
usual with our trio, with nothing to show any turbulence of under-currents,
unless it was a certain alertness in Oliver's manner, a restrained
excitement, and the questioning restlessness of his eyes as they
sought mine from time to time. Whatever he wished to ask me, he
was given no opportunity, for the professor carried him off to
work when our coffee was finished. As they departed, the young
man glanced back at me over his shoulder, with that same earnest
look of interrogation, but it went unanswered by any token or
gesture: for though I guessed that he wished to know if Mrs. Harman
had spoken of him to me, it seemed part of my bargain with her
to give him no sign that I understood.</p>

<p>A note lay beside my plate next morning, addressed in a writing
strange to me, one of dashing and vigorous character.</p>

<p>"In the pursuit of thrillingly scientific research," it read,
"what with the tumult which possessed me, I forgot to mention
the bond that links us; I, too, am a painter, though as yet unhonoured
and unhung. It must be only because I lack a gentle hand to guide
me. If I might sit beside you as you paint! The hours pass on
leaden wings at Quesnay &mdash;I could shriek! Do not refuse me
a few words of instruction, either in the wildwood, whither I
could support your shrinking steps, or, from time to time, as
you work in your studio, which (I glean from the instructive Mr.
Ferret) is at Les Trois Pigeons. At any hour, at any moment, I
will speed to you. I am, sir,</p>

<p>"Yours, if you will but breathe a 'yes,'</p>

<p>"<em>ANNE ELLIOTT</em>."</p>

<p>To this I returned a reply, as much in her own key as I could
write it, putting my refusal on the ground that I was not at present
painting in the studio. I added that I hoped her suit might prosper,
regretting that I could not be of greater assistance to that end,
and concluded with the suggestion that Madame Brossard might entertain
an offer for lessons in cooking.</p>

<p>The result of my attempt to echo her vivacity was discomfiting,
and I was allowed to perceive that epistolary jocularity was not
thought to be my line. It was Miss Elizabeth who gave me this
instruction three days later, on the way to Quesnay for "second
breakfast." Exercising fairly shame-faced diplomacy, I had avoided
dining at the chateau again, but, by arrangement, she had driven
over for me this morning in the phaeton.</p>

<p>"Why are you writing silly notes to that child?" she demanded,
as soon as we were away from the inn.</p>

<p>"Was it silly?"</p>

<p>"You should know. Do you think that style of humour suitable
for a young girl?"</p>

<p>This bewildered me a little. "But there wasn't anything offensive&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No?" Miss Elizabeth lifted her eyebrows to a height of bland
inquiry. "She mightn't think it rather&mdash;well, rough? Your suggesting
that she should take cooking lessons?"</p>

<p>"But <em>SHE </em>suggested she might take <em>PAINTING </em>lessons,"
was my feeble protest. "I only meant to show her I understood
that she wanted to get to the inn."</p>

<p>"And why should she care to 'get to the inn'?"</p>

<p>"She seemed interested in a young man who is staying there. 'Interested'
is the mildest word for it I can think of."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" Such was Miss Ward's enigmatic retort, and though I begged
an explanation I got none. Instead, she quickened the horse's
gait and changed the subject.</p>

<p>At the chateau, having a mind to offer some sort of apology,
I looked anxiously about for the subject of our rather disquieting
conversation, but she was not to be seen until the party assembled
at the table, set under an awning on the terrace. Then, to my
disappointment, I found no opportunity to speak to her, for her
seat was so placed as to make it impossible, and she escaped into
the house immediately upon the conclusion of the repast, hurrying
away too pointedly for any attempt to detain her&mdash;though, as she
passed, she sent me one glance of meek reproach which she was
at pains to make elaborately distinct.</p>

<p>Again taking me for her neighbour at the table, Miss Elizabeth
talked to me at intervals, apparently having nothing, just then,
to make up to Mr. Cresson Ingle, but not long after we rose she
accompanied him upon some excursion of an indefinite nature, which
led her from my sight. Thus, the others making off to cards indoors
and what not, I was left to the perusal of the eighteenth century
facade of the chateau, one of the most competent restorations
in that part of France, and of the liveliest interest to the student
or practitioner of architecture.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harman had not appeared at all, having gone to call upon
some one at Dives, I was told, and a servant informing me (on
inquiry) that Miss Elliott had retired to her room, I was thrust
upon my own devices indeed, a condition already closely associated
in my mind with this picturesque spot. The likeliest of my devices&mdash;or,
at least, the one I hit upon&mdash;was in the nature of an unostentatious
retreat.</p>

<p>I went home.</p>

<p>However, as the day was spoiled for work, I chose a roundabout
way, in fact the longest, and took the high-road to Dives, but
neither the road nor the town itself (when I passed through it)
rewarded my vague hope that I might meet Mrs. Harman, and I strode
the long miles in considerable disgruntlement, for it was largely
in that hope that I had gone to Quesnay. It put me in no merrier
mood to find Miss Elizabeth's phaeton standing outside the inn
in charge of a groom, for my vanity encouraged the supposition
that she had come out of a fear that my unceremonious departure
from Quesnay might have indicated that I was "hurt," or considered
myself neglected; and I dreaded having to make explanations.</p>

<p>My apprehensions were unfounded; it was not Miss Elizabeth who
had come in the phaeton, though a lady from Quesnay did prove
to be the occupant&mdash;the sole occupant&mdash;of the courtyard. At sight
of her I halted stock-still under the archway.</p>

<p>There she sat, a sketch-book on a green table beside her and
a board in her lap, brazenly painting&mdash;and a more blushless piece
of assurance than Miss Anne Elliott thus engaged these eyes have
never beheld.</p>

<p>She was not so hardened that she did not affect a little timidity
at sight of me, looking away even more quickly than she looked
up, while I walked slowly over to her and took the garden chair
beside her. That gave me a view of her sketch, which was a violent
little "lay-in" of shrubbery, trees, and the sky-line of the inn.
To my prodigious surprise (and, naturally enough, with a degree
of pleasure) I perceived that it was not very bad, not bad at
all, indeed. It displayed a sense of values, of placing, and even,
in a young and frantic way, of colour. Here was a young woman
of more than "accomplishments!"</p>

<p>"You see," she said, squeezing one of the tiny tubes almost dry,
and continuing to paint with a fine effect of absorption, "I <em>HAD
</em>to show you that I was in the most <em>ABYSMAL </em>earnest.
Will you take me painting with, you?"</p>

<p>"I appreciate your seriousness," I rejoined. "Has it been rewarded?"</p>

<p>"How can I say? You haven't told me whether or no I may follow
you to the wildwood."</p>

<p>"I mean, have you caught another glimpse of Mr. Saffren?"</p>

<p>At that she showed a prettier colour in her cheeks than any in
her sketch-box, but gave no other sign of shame, nor even of being
flustered, cheerfully replying:</p>

<p>"That is far from the point. Do you grant my burning plea?"</p>

<p>"I understood I had offended you."</p>

<p>"You did," she said. "<em>VICIOUSLY</em>!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry," I continued. "I wanted to ask you to forgive me&mdash;"</p>

<p>I spoke seriously, and that seemed to strike her as odd or needing
explanation, for she levelled her blue eyes at me, and interrupted,
with something more like seriousness in her own voice than I had
yet heard from her:</p>

<p>"What made you think I was offended?"</p>

<p>"Your look of reproach when you left the table&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing else?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes; Miss Ward told me you were."</p>

<p>"Yes; she drove over with you. That's it!" she exclaimed with
vigour, and nodded her head as if some suspicion of hers had been
confirmed. "I thought so!"</p>

<p>"You thought she had told me?"</p>

<p>"No," said Miss Elliott decidedly. "Thought that Elizabeth wanted
to have her cake and eat it too."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Then you'll get no help from me," she returned slowly, a frown
marking her pretty forehead. "But I was only playing offended,
and she knew it. I thought your note was <em>THAT </em>fetching!"</p>

<p>She continued to look thoughtful for a moment longer, then with
a resumption of her former manner&mdash;the pretence of an earnestness
much deeper than the real&mdash;"Will you take me painting with you?"
she said. "If it will convince you that I mean it, I'll give up
my hopes of seeing that <em>SUMPTUOUS </em>Mr. Saffren and go
back to Quesnay now, before he comes home. He's been out for a
walk&mdash;a long one, since it's lasted ever since early this morning,
so the waiter told me. May I go with you? You <em>CAN'T </em>know
how enervating it is up there at the chateau&mdash;all except Mrs.
Harman, and even she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What about Mrs. Harman?" I asked, as she paused.</p>

<p>"I think she must be in love."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"I do think so," said the girl. "She's <em>LIKE </em>it, at least."</p>

<p>"But with whom?"</p>

<p>She laughed gaily. "I'm afraid she's my rival!"</p>

<p>"Not with&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"Yes, with your beautiful and mad young friend."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;oh, it's preposterous!" I cried, profoundly disturbed.
"She couldn't be! If you knew a great deal about her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I may know more than you think. My simplicity of appearance
is deceptive," she mocked, beginning to set her sketch-box in
order. "You don't realise that Mrs. Harman and I are quite <em>HURLED
</em>upon each other at Quesnay, being two ravishingly intelligent
women entirely surrounded by large bodies of elementals. She has
told me a great deal of herself since that first evening, and
I know&mdash;well, I know why she did not come back from Dives this
afternoon, for instance."</p>

<p>"<em>WHY?" I </em>fairly shouted.</p>

<p>She slid her sketch into a groove in the box, which she closed,
and rose to her feet before answering. Then she set her hat a
little straighter with a touch, looking so fixedly and with such
grave interest over my shoulder that I turned to follow her glance
and encountered our reflections in a window of the inn. Her own
shed a light upon <em>THAT </em>mystery, at all events.</p>

<p>"I might tell you some day," she said indifferently, "if I gained
enough confidence in you through association in daily pursuits."</p>

<p>"My dear young lady," I cried with real exasperation, "I am a
working man, and this is a working summer for me!"</p>

<p>"Do you think I'd spoil it?" she urged gently.</p>

<p>"But I get up with the first daylight to paint," I protested,
"and I paint all day&mdash;"</p>

<p>She moved a step nearer me and laid her hand warningly upon my
sleeve, checking the outburst.</p>

<p>I turned to see what she meant.</p>

<p>Oliver Saffren had come in from the road and was crossing to
the gallery steps. He lifted his hat and gave me a quick word
of greeting as he passed, and at the sight of his flushed and
happy face my riddle was solved for me. Amazing as the thing was,
I had no doubt of the revelation.</p>

<p>"Ah," I said to Miss Elliott when he had gone, "I won't have
to take pupils to get the answer to my question, now!"</p>
