<p>THEA was to sail on Tuesday, at noon, and on Saturday Fred Ottenburg
arranged for her passage, while she and Dr. Archie went shopping. With
rugs and sea-clothes she was already provided; Fred had got everything
of that sort she needed for the voyage up from Vera Cruz. On Sunday
afternoon Thea went to see the Harsanyis. When she returned to her
hotel, she found a note from Ottenburg, saying that he had called and
would come again to-morrow.
</p><p>On Monday morning, while she was at breakfast, Fred came in. She knew by
his hurried, distracted air as he entered the dining-room that something
had gone wrong. He had just got a telegram from home. His mother had
been thrown from her carriage and hurt; a concussion of some sort, and
she was unconscious. He was leaving for St. Louis that night on the
eleven o'clock train. He had a great deal to attend to during the day.
He would come that evening, if he might, and stay with her until train
time, while she was doing her packing. Scarcely waiting for her consent,
he hurried away.
</p><p>All day Thea was somewhat cast down. She was sorry for Fred, and she
missed the feeling that she was the one person in his mind. He had
scarcely looked at her when they exchanged words at the breakfast-table.
She felt as if she were set aside, and she did not seem so important
even to herself as she had yesterday. Certainly, she reflected, it was
high time that she began to take care of herself again. Dr. Archie came
for dinner, but she sent him away early, telling him that she would be
ready to go to the boat with him at half-past ten the next morning. When
she went upstairs, she looked gloomily at the open trunk in her
sitting-room, and at the trays piled on the sofa. She stood at the
window and watched a quiet snowstorm spending itself over the city. More
than anything else, falling snow always made her think of Moonstone; of
the Kohlers' garden, of Thor's sled, of dressing by lamplight and
starting off to school before the paths were broken.
</p><p>When Fred came, he looked tired, and he took her hand almost without
seeing her.
</p><p>“I'm so sorry, Fred. Have you had any more word?”
</p><p>“She was still unconscious at four this afternoon. It doesn't look very
encouraging.” He approached the fire and warmed his hands. He seemed to
have contracted, and he had not at all his habitual ease of manner.
“Poor mother!” he exclaimed; “nothing like this should have happened to
her. She has so much pride of person. She's not at all an old woman, you
know. She's never got beyond vigorous and rather dashing middle age.” He
turned abruptly to Thea and for the first time really looked at her.
“How badly things come out! She'd have liked you for a daughter-in-law.
Oh, you'd have fought like the devil, but you'd have respected each
other.” He sank into a chair and thrust his feet out to the fire.
“Still,” he went on thoughtfully, seeming to address the ceiling, “it
might have been bad for you. Our big German houses, our good German
cooking--you might have got lost in the upholstery. That substantial
comfort might take the temper out of you, dull your edge. Yes,” he
sighed, “I guess you were meant for the jolt of the breakers.”
</p><p>“I guess I'll get plenty of jolt,” Thea murmured, turning to her trunk.
</p><p>“I'm rather glad I'm not staying over until to-morrow,” Fred reflected.
“I think it's easier for me to glide out like this. I feel now as if
everything were rather casual, anyhow. A thing like that dulls one's
feelings.”
</p><p>Thea, standing by her trunk, made no reply. Presently he shook himself
and rose. “Want me to put those trays in for you?”
</p><p>“No, thank you. I'm not ready for them yet.”
</p><p>Fred strolled over to the sofa, lifted a scarf from one of the trays and
stood abstractedly drawing it through his fingers. “You've been so kind
these last few days, Thea, that I began to hope you might soften a
little; that you might ask me to come over and see you this summer.”
</p><p>“If you thought that, you were mistaken,” she said slowly. “I've
hardened, if anything. But I shan't carry any grudge away with me, if
you mean that.”
</p><p>He dropped the scarf. “And there's nothing--nothing at all you'll let me
do?”
</p><p>“Yes, there is one thing, and it's a good deal to ask. If I get knocked
out, or never get on, I'd like you to see that Dr. Archie gets his money
back. I'm taking three thousand dollars of his.”
</p><p>“Why, of course I shall. You may dismiss that from your mind. How fussy
you are about money, Thea. You make such a point of it.” He turned
sharply and walked to the windows.
</p><p>Thea sat down in the chair he had quitted. “It's only poor people who
feel that way about money, and who are really honest,” she said gravely.
“Sometimes I think that to be really honest, you must have been so poor
that you've been tempted to steal.”
</p><p>“To what?”
</p><p>“To steal. I used to be, when I first went to Chicago and saw all the
things in the big stores there. Never anything big, but little things,
the kind I'd never seen before and could never afford. I did take
something once, before I knew it.”
</p><p>Fred came toward her. For the first time she had his whole attention, in
the degree to which she was accustomed to having it. “Did you? What was
it?” he asked with interest.
</p><p>“A sachet. A little blue silk bag of orris-root powder. There was a
whole counterful of them, marked down to fifty cents. I'd never seen any
before, and they seemed irresistible. I took one up and wandered about
the store with it. Nobody seemed to notice, so I carried it off.”
</p><p>Fred laughed. “Crazy child! Why, your things always smell of orris; is
it a penance?”
</p><p>“No, I love it. But I saw that the firm didn't lose anything by me. I
went back and bought it there whenever I had a quarter to spend. I got a
lot to take to Arizona. I made it up to them.”
</p><p>“I'll bet you did!” Fred took her hand. “Why didn't I find you that
first winter? I'd have loved you just as you came!”
</p><p>Thea shook her head. “No, you wouldn't, but you might have found me
amusing. The Harsanyis said yesterday afternoon that I wore such a funny
cape and that my shoes always squeaked. They think I've improved. I told
them it was your doing if I had, and then they looked scared.”
</p><p>“Did you sing for Harsanyi?”
</p><p>“Yes. He thinks I've improved there, too. He said nice things to me. Oh,
he was very nice! He agrees with you about my going to Lehmann, if
she'll take me. He came out to the elevator with me, after we had said
good-bye. He said something nice out there, too, but he seemed sad.”
</p><p>“What was it that he said?”
</p><p>“He said, 'When people, serious people, believe in you, they give you
some of their best, so--take care of it, Miss Kronborg.' Then he waved
his hands and went back.”
</p><p>“If you sang, I wish you had taken me along. Did you sing well?” Fred
turned from her and went back to the window. “I wonder when I shall hear
you sing again.” He picked up a bunch of violets and smelled them. “You
know, your leaving me like this--well, it's almost inhuman to be able to
do it so kindly and unconditionally.”
</p><p>“I suppose it is. It was almost inhuman to be able to leave home,
too,--the last time, when I knew it was for good. But all the same, I
cared a great deal more than anybody else did. I lived through it. I
have no choice now. No matter how much it breaks me up, I have to go. Do
I seem to enjoy it?”
</p><p>Fred bent over her trunk and picked up something which proved to be a
score, clumsily bound. “What's this? Did you ever try to sing this?” He
opened it and on the engraved title-page read Wunsch's inscription,
“EINST, O WUNDER!” He looked up sharply at Thea.
</p><p>“Wunsch gave me that when he went away. I've told you about him, my old
teacher in Moonstone. He loved that opera.”
</p><p>Fred went toward the fireplace, the book under his arm, singing
softly:--
</p>
<p><strong>“EINST, O WUNDER, ENTBLUHT AUF MEINEM GRABE,</strong>
<strong>EINE BLUME DER ASCHE MEINES HERZENS;”</strong>
</p><p>“You have no idea at all where he is, Thea?” He leaned against the
mantel and looked down at her.
</p><p>“No, I wish I had. He may be dead by this time. That was five years ago,
and he used himself hard. Mrs. Kohler was always afraid he would die off
alone somewhere and be stuck under the prairie. When we last heard of
him, he was in Kansas.”
</p><p>“If he were to be found, I'd like to do something for him. I seem to get
a good deal of him from this.” He opened the book again, where he kept
the place with his finger, and scrutinized the purple ink. “How like a
German! Had he ever sung the song for you?”
</p><p>“No. I didn't know where the words were from until once, when Harsanyi
sang it for me, I recognized them.”
</p><p>Fred closed the book. “Let me see, what was your noble brakeman's name?”
</p><p>Thea looked up with surprise. “Ray, Ray Kennedy.”
</p><p>“Ray Kennedy!” he laughed. “It couldn't well have been better! Wunsch
and Dr. Archie, and Ray, and I,”--he told them off on his
fingers,--“your whistling-posts! You haven't done so badly. We've backed
you as we could, some in our weakness and some in our might. In your
dark hours--and you'll have them--you may like to remember us.” He
smiled whimsically and dropped the score into the trunk. “You are taking
that with you?”
</p><p>“Surely I am. I haven't so many keepsakes that I can afford to leave
that. I haven't got many that I value so highly.”
</p><p>“That you value so highly?” Fred echoed her gravity playfully. “You are
delicious when you fall into your vernacular.” He laughed half to
himself.
</p><p>“What's the matter with that? Isn't it perfectly good English?”
</p><p>“Perfectly good Moonstone, my dear. Like the readymade clothes that hang
in the windows, made to fit everybody and fit nobody, a phrase that can
be used on all occasions. Oh,”--he started across the room
again,--“that's one of the fine things about your going! You'll be with
the right sort of people and you'll learn a good, live, warm German,
that will be like yourself. You'll get a new speech full of shades and
color like your voice; alive, like your mind. It will be almost like
being born again, Thea.”
</p><p>She was not offended. Fred had said such things to her before, and she
wanted to learn. In the natural course of things she would never have
loved a man from whom she could not learn a great deal.
</p><p>“Harsanyi said once,” she remarked thoughtfully, “that if one became an
artist one had to be born again, and that one owed nothing to anybody.”
</p><p>“Exactly. And when I see you again I shall not see you, but your
daughter. May I?” He held up his cigarette case questioningly and then
began to smoke, taking up again the song which ran in his head:--
</p>
<p><strong>“DEUTLICH SCHIMMERT AUF JEDEM, PURPURBLATTCHEN, ADELAIDE!”</strong>
</p>
<p>“I have half an hour with you yet, and then, exit Fred.” He walked about
the room, smoking and singing the words under his breath. “You'll like
the voyage,” he said abruptly. “That first approach to a foreign shore,
stealing up on it and finding it--there's nothing like it. It wakes up
everything that's asleep in you. You won't mind my writing to some
people in Berlin? They'll be nice to you.”
</p><p>“I wish you would.” Thea gave a deep sigh. “I wish one could look ahead
and see what is coming to one.”
</p><p>“Oh, no!” Fred was smoking nervously; “that would never do. It's the
uncertainty that makes one try. You've never had any sort of chance, and
now I fancy you'll make it up to yourself. You'll find the way to let
yourself out in one long flight.”
</p><p>Thea put her hand on her heart. “And then drop like the rocks we used to
throw--anywhere.” She left the chair and went over to the sofa, hunting
for something in the trunk trays. When she came back she found Fred
sitting in her place. “Here are some handkerchiefs of yours. I've kept
one or two. They're larger than mine and useful if one has a headache.”
</p><p>“Thank you. How nicely they smell of your things!” He looked at the
white squares for a moment and then put them in his pocket. He kept the
low chair, and as she stood beside him he took her hands and sat looking
intently at them, as if he were examining them for some special purpose,
tracing the long round fingers with the tips of his own. “Ordinarily,
you know, there are reefs that a man catches to and keeps his nose above
water. But this is a case by itself. There seems to be no limit as to
how much I can be in love with you. I keep going.” He did not lift his
eyes from her fingers, which he continued to study with the same fervor.
“Every kind of stringed instrument there is plays in your hands, Thea,”
 he whispered, pressing them to his face.
</p><p>She dropped beside him and slipped into his arms, shutting her eyes and
lifting her cheek to his. “Tell me one thing,” Fred whispered. “You said
that night on the boat, when I first told you, that if you could you
would crush it all up in your hands and throw it into the sea. Would
you, all those weeks?”
</p><p>She shook her head.
</p><p>“Answer me, would you?”
</p><p>“No, I was angry then. I'm not now. I'd never give them up. Don't make
me pay too much.” In that embrace they lived over again all the others.
When Thea drew away from him, she dropped her face in her hands. “You
are good to me,” she breathed, “you are!”
</p><p>Rising to his feet, he put his hands under her elbows and lifted her
gently. He drew her toward the door with him. “Get all you can. Be
generous with yourself. Don't stop short of splendid things. I want them
for you more than I want anything else, more than I want one splendid
thing for myself. I can't help feeling that you'll gain, somehow, by my
losing so much. That you'll gain the very thing I lose. Take care of
her, as Harsanyi said. She's wonderful!” He kissed her and went out of
the door without looking back, just as if he were coming again
to-morrow.
</p><p>Thea went quickly into her bedroom. She brought out an armful of muslin
things, knelt down, and began to lay them in the trays. Suddenly she
stopped, dropped forward and leaned against the open trunk, her head on
her arms. The tears fell down on the dark old carpet. It came over her
how many people must have said good-bye and been unhappy in that room.
Other people, before her time, had hired this room to cry in. Strange
rooms and strange streets and faces, how sick at heart they made one!
Why was she going so far, when what she wanted was some familiar place
to hide in?--the rock house, her little room in Moonstone, her own bed.
Oh, how good it would be to lie down in that little bed, to cut the
nerve that kept one struggling, that pulled one on and on, to sink into
peace there, with all the family safe and happy downstairs. After all,
she was a Moonstone girl, one of the preacher's children. Everything
else was in Fred's imagination. Why was she called upon to take such
chances? Any safe, humdrum work that did not compromise her would be
better. But if she failed now, she would lose her soul. There was
nowhere to fall, after one took that step, except into abysses of
wretchedness. She knew what abysses, for she could still hear the old
man playing in the snowstorm, it was released in her like a passion of
longing. Every nerve in her body thrilled to it. It brought her to her
feet, carried her somehow to bed and into troubled sleep.
</p><p>That night she taught in Moonstone again: she beat her pupils in hideous
rages, she kept on beating them. She sang at funerals, and struggled at
the piano with Harsanyi. In one dream she was looking into a hand-glass
and thinking that she was getting better-looking, when the glass began
to grow smaller and smaller and her own reflection to shrink, until she
realized that she was looking into Ray Kennedy's eyes, seeing her face
in that look of his which she could never forget. All at once the eyes
were Fred Ottenburg's, and not Ray's. All night she heard the shrieking
of trains, whistling in and out of Moonstone, as she used to hear them
in her sleep when they blew shrill in the winter air. But to-night they
were terrifying,--the spectral, fated trains that “raced with death,”
 about which the old woman from the depot used to pray.
</p><p>In the morning she wakened breathless after a struggle with Mrs. Livery
Johnson's daughter. She started up with a bound, threw the blankets back
and sat on the edge of the bed, her night-dress open, her long braids
hanging over her bosom, blinking at the daylight. After all, it was not
too late. She was only twenty years old, and the boat sailed at noon.
There was still time!
