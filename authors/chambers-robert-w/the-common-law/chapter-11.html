<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Valerie West was twenty-two years old in February. One year of
life lay behind her; her future stretched away into sunlit infinity.</p>

<p>Neville attained his twenty-eighth year in March. Years still
lay before him, a few lay behind him; but in a single month he
had waded so swiftly forward through the sea of life that the
shallows were already passed, the last shoal was deepening rapidly.
Only immeasurable and menacing depths remained between him and
the horizon&mdash;that pale, dead line dividing the noonday of to-day
from the phantom suns of blank eternity.</p>

<p>It was that winter that he began the picture destined to fix
definitely his position among the painters of his times&mdash;began
it humbly, yet somehow aware of what it was to be; afraid, for
all his courage, yet conscious of something inevitable impending.
It was Destiny; and, instinctively, he arose to meet it.</p>

<p>He called the picture "A Bride." A sapphire sky fading to turquoise,
in which great clouds crowded high in argent splendour&mdash;a young
girl naked of feet, her snowy body cinctured at the waist with
straight and silvered folds, standing amid a riot of wild flowers,
head slightly dropped back, white arms inert, pendant. And in
her eyes' deep velvet depths the mystery of the Annunciation.</p>

<p>All of humanity and of maturity&mdash;of adolescence and of divinity
was in that face; in the exquisitely sensitive wisdom of the woman's
eyes, in the full sweet innocence of the childish mouth&mdash;in the
smooth little hands so unsoiled, so pure&mdash;in the nun-like pallor
and slender beauty of the throat.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Where do you keep those pretty models, Louis?'
he demanded."]</p>

<p>Whatever had been his inspiration&mdash;whether spiritual conviction,
or the physical beauty of Valerie, neither he nor she considered
very deeply. But that he was embodying and creating something
of the existence of which neither he nor she had been aware a
month ago, was awaking something within them that had never before
stirred or given sign of life.</p>

<p>Since the last section of the mural decoration for the new court
house had been shipped to its destination, he had busied himself
on two canvases, a portrait of his sister in furs, and the portrait
of Valerie.</p>

<p>Lily Collis came in the mornings twice a week to sit for her;
and once or twice Stephanie Swift came with her; also Sandy Cameron,
ruddy, bald, jovial, scoffing, and insatiably curious.</p>

<p>"Where do you keep all those pretty models, Louis?" he demanded,
prying aside the tapestry with the crook of his walking stick,
and peeping behind furniture and hangings and big piles of canvases.
"Be a sport and introduce us; Stephanie wants to see a few as
well as I do."</p>

<p>Neville shrugged and went on painting, which exasperated Cameron.</p>

<p>"It's a fraud," he observed, in a loud, confidential aside to
Stephanie; "this studio ought to be full of young men in velvet
coats and bunchy ties, singing, 'Oh la&mdash;la!' and dextrously balancing
on their baggy knees a series of assorted soubrettes. It's a bluff,
a hoax, a con game! Are you going to stand for it? I don't see
any absinthe either&mdash;or even any Vin ordinaire! Only a tea-pot&mdash;a
<em>tea-pot!</em>" he repeated in unutterable scorn. "Why, there's
more of Bohemia in a Broad Street Trust Company than there is
in this Pullman car studio!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Collis was laughing so that her brother had difficulty in
going on with her portrait.</p>

<p>"Get out of here, Sandy," he said&mdash;"or take Stephanie into the
rest of the apartment, somewhere, and tell her your woes."</p>

<p>Stephanie, who had been exploring, turning over piles of chassis
and investigating canvases and charcoal studies stacked up here
and there against the wainscot, pulled aside an easel which impeded
her progress, and in so doing accidentally turned the canvas affixed
to it toward the light.</p>

<p>"Hello!" exclaimed Cameron briskly, "who is this?"</p>

<p>Lily turned her small, aristocratic head, and Stephanie looked
around.</p>

<p>"What a perfectly beautiful girl!" she exclaimed impulsively;
"who is she, Louis?"</p>

<p>"A model," he said calmly; but the careless and casual exposure
of the canvas had angered him so suddenly that his own swift emotion
astonished him.</p>

<p>Lily had risen from her seat, and now stood looking fixedly at
the portrait of Valerie West, her furs trailing from one shoulder
to the chair.</p>

<p>"My eye and Betty Martin!" cried Cameron, "I'll take it all back,
girls! It's a real studio after all&mdash;and this is the real thing!
Louis, do you think she's seen the Aquarium? I'm disengaged after
three o'clock&mdash;"</p>

<p>He began to kiss his hand rapidly in the direction of the portrait,
and then, fondly embracing his own walking stick, he took a few
jaunty steps in circles, singing "Waltz me around again, Willy."</p>

<p>Lily Collis said: "If your model is as lovely as her portrait,
Louis, she is a real beauty. Who is she?"</p>

<p>"A professional model." He could scarcely contain his impatience
with his sister, with Cameron's fat humour, with Stephanie's quiet
and intent scrutiny&mdash;as though, somehow, he had suddenly exposed
Valerie herself to the cool and cynically detached curiosity of
a world which she knew must always remain unfriendly to her.</p>

<p>He was perfectly aware that his sister had guessed whose portrait
confronted them; he supposed, too, that Stephanie probably suspected.
And the knowledge irritated him more than the clownishness of
Cameron.</p>

<p>"It is a splendid piece of painting," said Stephanie cordially,
and turned quietly to a portfolio of drawings at her elbow. She
had let her fleeting glance rest on Neville for a second; had
divined in a flash that he was enduring and not courting their
examination of this picture; that, somehow, her accidental discovery
of it had displeased him&mdash;was even paining him.</p>

<p>"Sandy," she said cheerfully, "come here and help me look over
these sketches."</p>

<p>"Any peaches among 'em?"</p>

<p>"Bushels."</p>

<p>Cameron came with alacrity; Neville waited until Lily reluctantly
resumed her seat; then he pushed back the easel, turned Valerie's
portrait to the wall, and quietly resumed his painting.</p>

<p>Art in any form was powerless to retain Cameron's attention for
very many consecutive minutes at a time; he grew restless, fussed
about with portfolios for a little while longer, enlivening the
tedium with characteristic observations.</p>

<p>"Well, I've got business down town," he exclaimed, with great
pretence of regret. "Come on, Stephanie; we'll go to the Exchange
and start something. Shall we? Oh, anything&mdash;from a panic to a
bull-market! I don't care; go as far as you like. You may wreck
a few railroads if you want to. Only I've <em>got</em> to go....
Awfully good of you to let me&mdash;er&mdash;see all these&mdash;er&mdash;interesting
and er&mdash;m-m-m&mdash;things, Louis. Glad I saw that dream of a peacherino,
too. What is she on the side? An actorine? If she is I'll take
a box for the rest of the season including the road and one-night
stands.... Good-bye, Mrs. Collis! Good-bye, Stephanie! <em>Good</em>-bye,
Louis! &mdash;I'll come and spend the day with you when you're
too busy to see me. Now, Stephanie, child! It's the Stock Exchange
or the Little Church around the Corner for you and me, if you
say so!"</p>

<p>Stephanie had duties at a different sort of an Exchange; and
she also took her leave, thanking Neville warmly for the pleasure
she had had, and promising to lunch with Lily at the Continental
Club.</p>

<p>When they had departed, Lily said:</p>

<p>"I suppose that is a portrait of your model, Valerie West."</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied shortly.</p>

<p>"Well, Louis, it is perfectly absurd of you to show so plainly
that you consider our discovery of it a desecration."</p>

<p>He turned red with surprise and irritation:</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"I mean exactly what I say. You showed by your expression and
your manner that our inspection of the picture and our questions
and comments concerning it were unwelcome."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I showed it.... But they <em>were</em> unwelcome."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me why?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I know exactly why&mdash;unless the portrait was a
personal and private affair concerning only myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Louis! Has it gone as far as that?"</p>

<p>"As far as what? What on earth are you trying to say, Lily?"</p>

<p>"I'm trying to say&mdash;as nicely and as gently as I can&mdash;that your
behaviour&mdash;in regard to this girl is making us all perfectly wretched."</p>

<p>"Who do you mean by 'us all'?" he demanded sullenly.</p>

<p>"Father and mother and myself. You must have known perfectly
well that father would write to me about what you told him at
Spindrift House a month ago."</p>

<p>"Did he?"</p>

<p>"Of course he did, Louis! Mother is simply worrying herself ill
over you; father is incredulous&mdash;at least he pretends to be; but
he has written me twice on the subject&mdash;and I think you might
just as well be told what anxiety and unhappiness your fascination
for this girl is causing us all."</p>

<p>Mrs. Collis was leaning far forward in her chair, forgetful of
her pose; Neville stood silent, head lowered, absently mixing
tints upon his palette without regard to the work under way.</p>

<p>When he had almost covered his palette with useless squares of
colour he picked up a palette-knife, scraped it clean, smeared
the residue on a handful of rags, laid aside brushes and palette,
and walked slowly to the window.</p>

<p>It was snowing again. He could hear the feathery whisper of the
flakes falling on the glass roof above; and he remembered the
night of the new year, and all that it had brought to him&mdash;all
the wonder and happiness and perplexity of a future utterly unsuspected,
undreamed of.</p>

<p>And now it was into that future he was staring with a fixed and
blank gaze as his sister's hand fell upon his shoulder and her
cheek rested a moment in caress against his.</p>

<p>"Dearest child," she said tremulously, "I did not mean to speak
harshly or without sympathy. But, after all, shouldn't a son consider
his father and mother in a matter of this kind?"</p>

<p>"I have considered them&mdash;tried to."</p>

<p>Mrs. Collis dropped into an arm-chair. After a few moments he
also seated himself listlessly, and sat gazing at nothing out
of absent eyes.</p>

<p>She said: "You know what father and mother are. Even I have something
left of their old-fashioned conservatism clinging to me&mdash;and yet
people consider me extremely liberal in my views. But all my liberality,
all my modern education since I left the dear old absurdities
of our narrow childhood and youth, can not reconcile me to what
you threaten us with&mdash;with what you are threatened&mdash;you, your
entire future life."</p>

<p>"What seems to threaten you&mdash;and them&mdash;is my marriage to the
woman with whom I'm in love. Does that shock you?"</p>

<p>"The circumstances shock me."</p>

<p>"I could not control the circumstances."</p>

<p>"You can control yourself, Louis."</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I can do that. I can break her heart and mine."</p>

<p>"Hearts don't break, Louis. And is anybody to live life through
exempt from suffering? If your unhappiness comes early in life
to you it will pass the sooner, leaving the future tranquil for
you, and you ready for it, unperplexed&mdash;made cleaner, purer, braver
by a sorrow that came, as comes all sorrow&mdash;and that has gone
its way, like all sorrows, leaving you the better and the worthier."</p>

<p>"How is it to leave <em>her</em>?"</p>

<p>He spoke so naturally, so simply, that for the moment his sister
did not recognise in him what had never before been there to recognise&mdash;the
thought of another before himself. Afterward she remembered it.</p>

<p>She said quietly: "If Valerie West is a girl really sincere and
meriting your respect, she will face this matter as you face it."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;she would do that," he said, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Then I think that the sooner you explain matters to her&mdash;"</p>

<p>He laughed: "<em>I</em> don't have to explain anything to her,
Lily."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"She knows how things stand. She is perfectly aware of your world's
attitude toward her. She has not the slightest intention of forcing
herself on you, or of asking your indulgence or your charity."</p>

<p>"You mean, then, that she desires to separate you from your family&mdash;from
your friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," he said wearily, "she does not desire that, either."</p>

<p>His sister's troubled eyes rested on him in silence for a while;
then:</p>

<p>"I know she is beautiful; I am sure she is good, Louis&mdash;good
in&mdash;in her own way&mdash;worthy, in her own fashion. But, dear, is
that all that you, a Neville, require of the woman who is to bear
your name&mdash;bear your children?"</p>

<p>"She <em>is</em> all I require&mdash;and far more."</p>

<p>"Dear, you are utterly blinded by your infatuation!"</p>

<p>"You do not know her."</p>

<p>"Then let me!" exclaimed Mrs. Collis desperately. "Let me meet
her, Louis&mdash;let me talk with her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No.... And I'll tell you why, Lily; it's because she does not
care to meet you."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"I have told you the plain truth. She sees no reason for knowing
you, or for knowing my parents, or any woman in a world that would
never tolerate her, never submit to her entrance, never receive
her as one of them!&mdash;a world that might shrug and smile and endure
her as my wife&mdash;and embitter my life forever."</p>

<p>As he spoke he was not aware that he merely repeated Valerie's
own words; he remained still unconscious that his decision was
in fact merely her decision; that his entire attitude had become
hers because her nature and her character were as yet the stronger.</p>

<p>But in his words his sister's quick intelligence perceived a
logic and a conclusion entirely feminine and utterly foreign to
her brother's habit of mind. And she realised with a thrill of
fear that she had to do, not with her brother, but with a woman
who was to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;or does Miss West think it likely that I am a woman
to wound, to affront another&mdash;no matter who she may be? Surely,
Louis, you could have told her very little about me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never mention you to her."</p>

<p>Lily caught her breath.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Why should I?"</p>

<p>"That is unfair, Louis! She has the right to know about your
own family&mdash;otherwise how can she understand the situation?"</p>

<p>"It's like all situations, isn't it? You and father and mother
have your own arbitrary customs and traditions and standards of
respectability. You rule out whom you choose. Valerie West knows
perfectly well that you would rule her out. Why should she give
you the opportunity?"</p>

<p>"Is she afraid of me?"</p>

<p>He smiled: "I don't think so." And his smile angered his sister.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, biting her lip.</p>

<p>For a few moments she sat there deliberating, her pointed patent-leather
toe tapping the polished floor. Then she stood up, with decision:</p>

<p>"There is no use in our quarrelling, Louis&mdash;until the time comes
when some outsider forces us into an unhappy misunderstanding.
Kiss me good-bye, dear."</p>

<p>She lifted her face; he kissed her; and her hand closed impulsively
on his arm:</p>

<p>"Louis! Louis! I love you. I am so proud of you &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>you
know I love you, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I think so."</p>

<p>"You <em>know</em> I am devoted to your happiness!&mdash;your <em>real</em>
happiness&mdash;which those blinded eyes in that obstinate head of
yours refuse to see. Believe me&mdash;believe me, dear, that your <em>real</em>
happiness is not in this pretty, strange girl's keeping. No, no,
no! You are wrong, Louis&mdash;terribly and hopelessly wrong! Because
happiness for you lies in the keeping of another woman&mdash;a woman
of your own world, dear&mdash;of your own kind&mdash;a gently-bred, lovable,
generous girl whom you, deep in your heart and soul, love, unknowingly&mdash;have
always loved!"</p>

<p>He shook his head, slowly, looking down into his sister's eyes.</p>

<p>She said, almost frightened:</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you won't do it&mdash;suddenly&mdash;without letting us know&mdash;will
you, Louis?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Marry this girl!"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "it is not likely."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;you mean to marry her?"</p>

<p>"I want to.... But it is not likely to happen&mdash;for a while."</p>

<p>"How long?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>She drew a tremulous breath of relief, looking up into his face.
Then her eyes narrowed; she thought a moment, and her gaze became
preoccupied and remote, and her lips grew firm with the train
of thought she was pursuing.</p>

<p>He put his arms around her and kissed her again; and she felt
the boyish appeal in it and her lip quivered. But she could not
respond, could not consider for one moment, could not permit her
sympathy for him to enlist her against what she was devoutly convinced
were his own most vital interests&mdash;his honour, his happiness,
the success of his future career.</p>

<p>She said with tears in her eyes: "Louis, I love you dearly. If
God will grant us all a little patience and a little wisdom there
will be a way made clear to all of us. Good-bye."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Your&mdash;profession&mdash;must be an exceedingly interesting
one,' said Lily."]</p>

<p>Whether it was that the Almighty did not grant Mrs. Collis the
patience to wait until a way was made clear, or whether another
letter from her father decided her to clear that way for herself,
is uncertain; but one day in March Valerie received a letter from
Mrs. Collis; and answered it; and the next morning she shortened
a seance with Querida, exchanged her costume for her street-clothes,
and hastened to her apartments, where Mrs. Collis was already
awaiting her in the little sitting-room.</p>

<p>Valerie offered her hand and stood looking at Lily Collis, as
though searching for some resemblance to her brother in the pretty,
slightly flushed features. There was a very indefinite family
resemblance.</p>

<p>"Miss West," she said, "it is amiable of you to overlook the
informality&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not formal, Mrs. Collis," she said, quietly. "Will you
sit here?" indicating an arm-chair near the window,&mdash;"because
the light is not very good and I have some mending to do on a
costume which I must pose in this afternoon."</p>

<p>Lily Collis seated herself, her bewitched gaze following Valerie
as she moved lightly and gracefully about, collecting sewing materials
and the costume in question, and bringing them to a low chair
under the north window.</p>

<p>"I am sure you will not mind my sewing," she said, with a slight
upward inflection to her voice, which made it a question.</p>

<p>"Please, Miss West," said Lily, hastily.</p>

<p>"It is really a necessity," observed Valerie threading her needle
and turning over the skirt. "Illustrators are very arbitrary gentlemen;
a model's failure to keep an engagement sometimes means loss of
a valuable contract to them, and that isn't fair either to them
or to their publishers, who would be forced to hunt up another
artist at the last moment."</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;profession&mdash;must be an exceedingly interesting one," said
Lily in a low voice.</p>

<p>Valerie smiled: "It is a very exacting one."</p>

<p>There was a silence. Valerie's head was bent over her sewing;
Mrs. Collis, fascinated, almost alarmed by her beauty, could not
take her eyes from her. Outwardly Lily was pleasantly reserved,
perfectly at ease with this young girl; inwardly all was commotion
approaching actual consternation.</p>

<p>She had been prepared for youth, for a certain kind of charm
and beauty&mdash;but not for this kind&mdash;not for the loveliness, the
grace, the composure, the exquisite simplicity of this young girl
who sat sewing there before her.</p>

<p>She was obliged to force herself to recollect that this girl
was a model hired to pose for men&mdash;paid to expose her young, unclothed
limbs and body! Yet&mdash;could it be possible! Was this the girl hailed
as a comrade by the irrepressible Ogilvy and Annan&mdash;the heroine
of a score of unconventional and careless gaieties recounted by
them? Was this the coquette who, it was rumoured, had flung over
Querida, snapped her white fingers at Penrhyn Cardemon, and laughed
disrespectfully at a dozen respected pillars of society, who appeared
to be willing to support her in addition to the entire social
structure?</p>

<p>Very quietly the girl raised her head. Her sensitive lips were
edged with a smile, but there was no mirth in her clear eyes:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Collis, perhaps you are waiting for me to say something
about your letter and my answer to it. I did not mean to embarrass
you by not speaking of it, but I was not certain that the initiative
lay with me."</p>

<p>Lily reddened: "It lies with <em>me</em>, Miss West&mdash;the initiative.
I mean&mdash;" She hesitated, suddenly realising how difficult it had
become to go on,&mdash;how utterly unprepared she was to encounter
passive resistance from such composure as this young girl already
displayed.</p>

<p>"You wrote to me about your anxiety concerning Mr. Neville,"
said Valerie, gently.</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I did, Miss West. You will surely understand&mdash;and
forgive me&mdash;if I say to you that I am still a prey to deepest
anxiety."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>The question was so candid, so direct that for a moment Lily
remained silent. But the dark, clear, friendly eyes were asking
for an answer, and the woman of the world who knew how to meet
most situations and how to dominate them, searched her experience
in vain for the proper words to use in this one.</p>

<p>After a moment Valerie's eyes dropped, and she resumed her sewing;
and Lily bit her lip and composed her mind to its delicate task:</p>

<p>"Miss West," she said, "what I have to say is not going to be
very agreeable to either of us. It is going to be painful perhaps&mdash;and
it is going to take a long while to explain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It need not take long," said Valerie, without raising her eyes
from her stitches; "it requires only a word to tell me that you
and your father and mother do not wish your brother to marry me."</p>

<p>She looked up quietly, and her eyes met Lily's:</p>

<p>"I promise not to marry him," she said. "You are perfectly right.
He belongs to his own family; he belongs in his own world."</p>

<p>She looked down again at her sewing with a faint smile:</p>

<p>"I shall not attempt to enter that world as his wife, Mrs. Collis,
or to draw him out of it.... And I hope that you will not be anxious
any more."</p>

<p>She laid aside her work and rose to her slender height, smilingly,
as though the elder woman had terminated the interview; and Lily,
utterly confounded, rose, too, as Valerie offered her hand in
adieu.</p>

<p>"Miss West," she began, not perfectly sure of what she was saying,
"<em>I&mdash;</em>scarcely dare thank you&mdash;for what you have said&mdash;for&mdash;my&mdash;brother's&mdash;sake&mdash;"</p>

<p>Valerie laughed: "I would do much more than that for him, Mrs.
Collis.... Only I must first be sure of what is really the best
way to serve him."</p>

<p>Lily's gloved hand tightened over hers; and she laid the other
one over it:</p>

<p>"You are so generous, so sweet about it!" she said unsteadily.
"And I look into your face and I know you are good&mdash;<em>good</em>&mdash;all
the way through&mdash;"</p>

<p>Valerie laughed again:</p>

<p>"There isn't any real evil in me.... And I am not astonishingly
generous&mdash;merely sensible. I knew from the first that I couldn't
marry him&mdash;if I really loved him," she added, under her breath.</p>

<p>They were at the door now. Lily passed out into the entry, halted,
turned impulsively, the tears in her eyes, and put both arms tenderly
around the girl.</p>

<p>"You poor child," she whispered. "You dear, brave, generous girl!
God knows whether I am right or wrong. I am only trying to do
my duty&mdash;trying to do what is best for him."</p>

<p>Valerie looked at her curiously:</p>

<p>"Yes, you cannot choose but think of him if you really love him....
That is the way it is with love."</p>

<p>Afterward, sewing by the window, she could scarcely see the stitches
for the clinging tears. But they dried on her lashes; not one
fell. And when Rita came in breezily to join her at luncheon she
was ready, her costume mended and folded in her hand-satchel,
and there remained scarcely even a redness of the lids to betray
her.</p>

<p>That evening she did not stop for tea at Neville's studio; and,
later, when he telephoned, asking her to dine with him, she pleaded
the feminine prerogative of tea in her room and going to bed early
for a change. But she lay awake until midnight trying to think
out a <em>modus vivendi</em> for Neville and herself which, would
involve no sacrifice on his part and no unhappiness for anybody
except, perhaps, for herself.</p>

<p>The morning was dull and threatened rain, and she awoke with
a slight headache, remembering that she had dreamed all night
of weeping.</p>

<p>In her mail there was a note from Querida asking her to stop
for a few moments at his studio that afternoon, several business
communications, and a long letter from Mrs. Collis which she read
lying in bed, one hand resting on her aching temples:</p>

<p>"MY <em>DEAR </em>Miss <em>WEST: </em>Our interview this morning
has left me with a somewhat confused sense of indebtedness to
you and an admiration and respect for your character which I wished
very much to convey to you this morning, but which I was at a
loss to express.</p>

<p>"You are not only kind and reasonable, but so entirely unselfish
that my own attitude in this unhappy matter has seemed to me harsh
and ungracious.</p>

<p>"I went to you entertaining a very different idea of you, and
very different sentiments from the opinion which I took away with
me. I admit that my call on you was not made with any agreeable
anticipations; but I was determined to see you and learn for myself
what manner of woman had so disturbed us all.</p>

<p>"In justice to you&mdash;in grateful recognition of your tact and
gentleness, I am venturing to express to you now my very thorough
respect for you, my sense of deep obligation, and my sympathy&mdash;which
I am afraid you may not care for.</p>

<p>"That it would not be suitable for a marriage to take place between
my brother and yourself is, it appears, as evident to you as it
is to his own family. Yet, will you permit me to wish that it
were otherwise? I do wish it; I wish that the circumstances had
made such a marriage possible. I say this to you in spite of the
fact that we have always expected my brother to marry into a family
which has been intimate with our own family for many generations.
It is a tribute to your character which I am unwilling to suppress;
which I believe I owe to you, to say that, had circumstances been
different, you might have been made welcome among us.</p>

<p>"The circumstances of which I speak are of an importance to us,
perhaps exaggerated, possibly out of proportion to the fundamental
conditions of the situation. But they are conditions which our
family has never ignored. And it is too late for us to learn to
ignore them now.</p>

<p>"I think that you will feel &mdash;I think that a large part
of the world might consider our attitude toward such a woman as
you have shown yourself to be, narrow, prejudiced, provincial.
The modern world would scarcely arm us with any warrant for interfering
in a matter which a man nearly thirty is supposed to be able to
manage for himself. But my father and mother are old, and they
will never change in their beliefs and prejudices inherited from
their parents, who, in turn, inherited their beliefs.</p>

<p>"It was for them more than for myself&mdash;more even than for my
brother&mdash;that I appealed to you. The latter end of their lives
should not be made unhappy. And your generous decision assures
me that it will not be made so.</p>

<p>"As for myself, my marriage permitted me an early enfranchisement
from the obsolete conventional limits within which my brother
and I were brought up.</p>

<p>"I understand enough of the modern world not to clash with, it
unnecessarily, enough of ultra-modernity not to be too much afraid
of it.</p>

<p>"But even I, while I might theoretically admit and even admire
that cheerful and fearless courage which makes it possible for
such a self-respecting woman as yourself to face the world and
force it to recognise her right to earn her own living as she
chooses &mdash;I could not bring myself to contemplate with equanimity
my brother's marrying you. And I do not believe my father would
survive such an event.</p>

<p>"To us, to me, also, certain fixed conventional limits are the
basis of all happiness. To offend them is to be unhappy; to ignore
them would mean destruction to our peace of mind and self-respect.
And, though I do admire you and respect you for what you are,
it is only just to you to say that we could never reconcile ourselves
to those modern social conditions which you so charmingly represent,
and which are embodied in you with such convincing dignity.</p>

<p>"Dear Miss West, have I pained you? Have I offended you in return
for all your courtesy to me? I hope not. I felt that I owed you
this. Please accept it as a tribute and as a sorrowful acquiescence
in conditions which an old-fashioned family are unable to change.</p>

<p>"Very sincerely yours,</p>

<p>"<em>LILLY COLLIS</em>."</p>

<p>She lay for a while, thinking, the sheets of the letter lying
loose on the bed. It seemed to require no answer. Nor had Mrs.
Collis, apparently, any fear that Valerie would ever inform Louis
Neville of what had occurred between his sister and herself.</p>

<p>Still, to Valerie, an unanswered letter was like a civil observation
ignored.</p>

<p>She wrote that evening to Lily:</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Collis: In acknowledging your letter of yesterday
I beg to assure you that I understand the inadvisability of my
marrying your brother, and that I have no idea of doing it, and
that, through me, he shall never know of your letters or of your
visit to me in his behalf.</p>

<p>"With many thanks for your kindly expressions of good-will toward
me, I am</p>

<p>"Very truly yours,</p>

<p>"<em>VALERIE WEST</em>."</p>

<p>She had been too tired to call at Querida's studio, too tired
even to take tea at the Plaza with Neville.</p>

<p>Rita came in, silent and out of spirits, and replied in monosyllables
to Valerie's inquiries.</p>

<p>It finally transpired that Sam Ogilvy and Harry Annan had been
tormenting John Burleson after their own fashion until their inanity
had exasperated her and she expressed herself freely to everybody
concerned.</p>

<p>"It makes me very angry," she said, "to have a lot of brainless
people believe that John Burleson is stupid. He isn't; he is merely
a trifle literal, and far too intelligent to see any humour in
the silly capers Sam and Harry cut."</p>

<p>Valerie, who was feeling better, sipped her tea and nibbled her
toast, much amused at Rita's championship of the big sculptor.</p>

<p>"John is a dear," she said, "but even his most enthusiastic partisans
could hardly characterise him as a humorist."</p>

<p>"He's not a clown&mdash;if that's what you mean," said Rita shortly.</p>

<p>"But, Rita, he <em>isn't</em> humorous, you know."</p>

<p>"He <em>is</em>. He has a sense of humour perfectly intelligible
to those who understand it."</p>

<p>"Do you, dear?"</p>

<p>"Certainly ... And I always have understood it."</p>

<p>"Oh, what kind of occult humour is it?"</p>

<p>"It is a quiet, cultivated, dignified sense of humour not uncommon
in New England, and not understood in New York."</p>

<p>Valerie nibbled her toast, secretly amused. Burleson was from
Massachusetts. Rita was the daughter of a Massachusetts clergyman.
No doubt they were fitted to understand each other.</p>

<p>It occurred to her, too, that John Burleson and Rita Tevis had
always been on a friendly footing rather quieter and more serious
than the usual gay and irresponsible relations maintained between
two people under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>Sometimes she had noticed that when affairs became too frivolous
and the scintillation of wit and epigram too rapid and continuous,
John Burleson and Rita were very apt to edge out of the circle
as though for mutual protection.</p>

<p>"You're not posing for John, are you, Rita?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No. He has a bad cold, and I stopped in to see that he wore
a red flannel bandage around his throat. A sculptor's work is
so dreadfully wet and sloppy, and his throat has always been very
delicate."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you charge your mind with the coddling
of that great big, pink-cheeked boy?" laughed Valerie,</p>

<p>"Coddling!" repeated Rita, flushing up. "I don't call it coddling
to stop in for a moment to remind a friend that he doesn't know
how to take care of himself, and never will."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. You couldn't kill a man of that size and placidity
of character."</p>

<p>"You don't know anything about him. He is much more delicate
than he looks."</p>

<p>Valerie glanced curiously at the girl, who was preparing oysters
in the chafing dish.</p>

<p>"How do <em>you</em> happen to know so much about him, Rita?"</p>

<p>She answered, carelessly: "I have known him ever since I began
to pose&mdash;almost."</p>

<p>Valerie set her cup aside, sprang up to rinse mouth and hands.
Then, gathering her pink negligée around her, curled up in a big
wing-chair, drawing her bare feet up under the silken folds and
watching Rita prepare the modest repast for one.</p>

<p>"Rita," she said, "who was the first artist you ever posed for?
Was it John Burleson&mdash;and did you endure the tortures of the damned?"</p>

<p>"No, it was not John Burleson.... And I endured&mdash;enough."</p>

<p>"Don't you care to tell me who it was?"</p>

<p>Rita did not reply at that time. Later, however, when the simple
supper was ended, she lighted a cigarette and found a place where,
with lamplight behind her, she could read a book which Burleson
had sent her, and which she had been attempting to assimilate
and digest all winter. It was a large, thick, dark book, and weighed
nearly four pounds. It was called "Essays on the Obvious "; and
Valerie had made fun of it until, to her surprise, she noticed
that her pleasantries annoyed Rita.</p>

<p>Valerie, curled up in the wing-chair, cheek resting against its
velvet side, was reading the Psalms again&mdash;fascinated as always
by the noble music of the verse. And it was only by chance that,
lifting her eyes absently for a moment, she found that Rita had
laid aside her book and was looking at her intently.</p>

<p>"Hello, dear!" she said, indolently humorous.</p>

<p>Rita said: "You read your Bible a good deal, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Parts of it."</p>

<p>"The parts you believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and the parts that I can't believe."</p>

<p>"What parts can't you believe?"</p>

<p>Valerie laughed: "Oh, the unfair parts&mdash;the cruel parts, the
inconsistent parts."</p>

<p>"What about faith?"</p>

<p>"Faith is a matter of temperament, dear."</p>

<p>"Haven't you any?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in all things good."</p>

<p>"Then you have faith in yourself that you are capable of deciding
what is good and worthy of belief in the Scriptures, and what
is unworthy?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "It was a large, thick, dark book, and weighed
nearly four pounds."]</p>

<p>"It must be that way. I am intelligent. One must decide for one's
self what is fair and what is unfair; what is cruel and what is
merciful and kind. Intelligence must always evolve its own religion;
sin is only an unfaithfulness to what one really believes."</p>

<p>"What <em>do</em> you believe, Valerie?"</p>

<p>"About what, dear?"</p>

<p>"Love."</p>

<p>"Loving a man?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You know what my creed is&mdash;that love must be utterly unselfish
to be pure&mdash;to be love at all."</p>

<p>"One must not think of one's self," murmured Rita, absently.</p>

<p>"I don't mean that. I mean that one must not hesitate to sacrifice
one's self when the happiness or welfare of the other is in the
balance."</p>

<p>"Yes. Of course!... Suppose you love a man."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Valerie, smiling, "I can imagine that."</p>

<p>"Listen, dear. Suppose you love a man. And you think that perhaps
he is beginning&mdash;just beginning to care a little for you. And
suppose&mdash;suppose that you are&mdash;have been&mdash;long ago&mdash;once, very
long ago&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Unwise," said Rita, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Unwise? How?"</p>

<p>"In the&mdash;unwisest way that a girl can be."</p>

<p>"You mean any less unwise than a man might be&mdash;probably the very
man she is in love with?"</p>

<p>"You know well enough what is thought about a girl's unwisdom
and the same unwisdom in a man."</p>

<p>"I know what is thought; but <em>I</em> don't think it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't. But the world's opinion is different."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it.... What is your question again? You say to me,
here's a man beginning to care for a girl who has been unwise
enough before she knew him to let herself believe she cared enough
for another man to become his mistress. Is that it, Rita?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes."</p>

<p>"Very well. What do you wish to ask me?"</p>

<p>"I wish to ask you what that girl should do."</p>

<p>"Do? Nothing. What is there for her to do?"</p>

<p>"Ought she to let that man care for her?"</p>

<p>"Has he ever made the same mistake she has?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't think so."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Almost."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'd tell him."</p>

<p>Rita lay silent, gazing into space, her blond hair clustering
around the pretty oval of her face.</p>

<p>Valerie waited for a few moments, then resumed her reading, glancing
inquiringly at intervals over the top of her book at Rita, who
seemed disinclined for further conversation.</p>

<p>After a long silence she sat up abruptly on the sofa and looked
at Valerie.</p>

<p>"You asked me who was the first man for whom I posed. I'll tell
you if you wish to know. It was Penrhyn Cardemon!... And I was
eighteen years old."</p>

<p>Valerie dropped her book in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Penrhyn Cardemon!" she repeated. "Why, he isn't an artist!"</p>

<p>"He has a studio."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"On Fifth Avenue."</p>

<p>"What does he do there?"</p>

<p>"Deviltry."</p>

<p>Valerie's face was blank; Rita sat sullenly cradling one knee
in her arms, looking at the floor, her soft, gold hair hanging
over her face and forehead so that it shadowed her face.</p>

<p>"I've meant to tell you for a long time," she went on; "I would
have told you if Cardemon had ever sent for you to&mdash;to pose&mdash;in
his place."</p>

<p>"He asked me to go on <em>The Mohave</em>."</p>

<p>"I'd have warned you if Louis Neville had not objected."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose Louis knew?"</p>

<p>"No. He scarcely knows Penrhyn Cardemon. His family and Cardemon
are neighbours in the country, but the Nevilles and the Collises
are snobs &mdash;I'm speaking plainly, Valerie&mdash;and they have
no use for that red-faced, red-necked, stocky young millionaire."</p>

<p>Valerie sat thinking; Rita, nursing her knee, brooded under the
bright tangle of her hair, linking and unlinking her fingers as
she gently swayed her foot to and fro.</p>

<p>"That's how it is," she said at last. "Now you know."</p>

<p>Valerie's head was still lowered, but she raised her eyes and
looked straight at Rita where she sat on the sofa's edge, carelessly
swinging her foot to and fro.</p>

<p>"Was it &mdash;Penrhyn Cardemon?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes.... I thought it had killed any possibility of ever caring&mdash;that
way&mdash;for any other man."</p>

<p>"But it hasn't?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;you are in love?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"With John Burleson?"</p>

<p>Rita looked up from the burnished disorder of her hair:</p>

<p>"I have been in love with him for three years," she said, "and
you are the only person in the world except myself who knows it."</p>

<p>Valerie rose and walked over to Rita and seated herself beside
her. Then she put one arm around her; and Rita bit her lip and
stared at space, swinging her slender foot.</p>

<p>"You poor dear," said Valerie. Rita's bare foot hung inert; the
silken slipper dropped from it to the floor; and then her head
fell, sideways, resting on Valerie's shoulder, showering her body
with its tangled gold.</p>

<p>Valerie said, thoughtfully: "Girls don't seem to have a very
good chance.... I had no idea about Cardemon&mdash;that he was that
kind of a man. A girl never knows. Men can be so attractive and
so nice.... And so many of them are merciless.... I suppose you
thought you loved him."</p>

<p>"<em>Y&mdash;</em>yes."</p>

<p>"We all think that, I suppose," said Valerie, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Other girls have thought it of Penrhyn Cardemon."</p>

<p>"Other <em>girls?</em>"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Valerie's face expressed bewilderment.</p>

<p>"I didn't know that there were really such men."</p>

<p>Rita closed her disillusioned eyes.</p>

<p>"Plenty," she said wearily.</p>

<p>"I don't care to believe that."</p>

<p>"You may believe it, Valerie. Men are almost never single-minded;
women are&mdash;almost always. You see what chance for happiness we
have? But it's the truth, and the world has been made that way.
It's a man's world, Valerie. I don't think there's much use for
us to fight against it.... She sat very silent for a while, close
to Valerie, her hot face on the younger girl's shoulder. Suddenly
she straightened up and dried her eyes naïvely on the sleeve of
her kimona.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" she said, "I almost forgot!"</p>

<p>And a moment later Valerie heard her at the telephone:</p>

<p>"Is that you, John?"</p>
