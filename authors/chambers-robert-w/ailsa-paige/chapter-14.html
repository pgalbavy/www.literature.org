<p>The tremendous exodus continued; regiment after regiment packed
knapsacks, struck tents, loaded their waggons and marched back
through the mud toward Alexandria, where transports were waiting
in hundreds.</p>

<p>The 3rd Zouaves were scheduled to leave early.  Celia had only
a few hours now and then in camp with husband and son.  Once or
twice they came to the hospital in the bright spring weather where
new blossoms on azalea and jasmine perfumed the fields and flowering
peach orchards turned all the hills and valleys pink.</p>

<p>Walking with her husband and son that last lovely evening before
the regiment left, a hand of each clasped in her own, she strove
very hard to keep up the gaiety of appearances, tried with all
her might to keep back the starting tears, steady the lip that
quivered, the hands that trembled locked in theirs.</p>

<p>They were walking together in a secluded lane that led from behind
the Farm Hospital barns to a little patch of woodland through
which a clear stream sparkled, a silent, intimate, leafy oasis
amid an army-ridden desert, where there was only a cow to stare
at them, knee deep in young mint, only a shy cardinal bird to
interrupt them with its exquisite litany.</p>

<p>Their talk had been of Paige and Marye, of Paigecourt and the
advisability of selling all stock, dismissing the negroes, and
closing the place with the exception of the overseer's house. 
And Celia had made arrangements to attend to it.</p>

<p>"I certainly do despise travelling," she said, "but while I'm
so near, I reckon I'd better use my pass and papers and try to
go through to Paigecourt.  It's just as well to prepare for the
impossible, I suppose."</p>

<p>Colonel Craig polished his eye-glasses, adjusted them, and examined
the official papers that permitted his wife to go to her estate,
pack up certain family papers, discharge the servants, close the
house, and return through the Union lines carrying only personal
baggage.</p>

<p>He said without enthusiasm: "It's inside their lines.  To go
there isn't so difficult, but how about coming back?  I don't
want you to go, Celia."</p>

<p>She explained in detail that there would be no difficulty&mdash;a
little proudly, too, when she spoke of her personal safety among
her own people.</p>

<p>"I understand all that," he said patiently, "but nobody except
the commander-in-chief knows where this army is going.  I don't
want you to be caught in the zone of operations."</p>

<p>She flushed up with a defiant little laugh.  "The war isn't going
to Paigecourt, anyway," she said.</p>

<p>He smiled with an effort.  "I am not sure, dearest.  All I am
sure of is that we march in the morning, and go aboard ship at
Alexandria.  I <em>don't</em> know where we are expected to land,
or where we are going to march after we do land." . . .  He smiled
again, mischievously.  "Even if you believe that a Yankee army
is not likely to get very far into Virginia, Paigecourt is too
near Richmond for me to feel entirely sure that you may not have
another visit from Stephen and me before you start North."</p>

<p>"Listen to the Yankee!" she cried, laughing gaily to hide the
sudden dimness in her blue eyes.  "My darling Yankee husband is
ve'y absurd, and he doesn't suspect it!  Why! don't you perfec'ly
ridiculous Zouaves know that you'll both be back in New York befo'
I am&mdash;and all tired out keeping up with the pace yo' general sets
you?"</p>

<p>But when it was time to say good-bye once more, her limbs grew
weak and she leaned heavily on husband and son, her nerveless
feet dragging across the spring turf.</p>

<p>"Oh, Curt, Curt," she faltered, her soft cheeks pressed against
the stiff bullion on his sleeve and collar, "if only I had the
wretched consolation of sending you away to fight fo' the Right&mdash;fo'
God and country &mdash;There, darling!  Fo'give me&mdash;fo'give me. 
I am yo' wife first of all&mdash;first of all, Curt.  And that even
comes befo' country and&mdash;God! &mdash;Yes, it does! it <em>does</em>,
dear.  You are all three to me &mdash;I know no holier trinity
than husband, God, and native land. . . .  <em>Must</em> you go
so soon?  So soon? . . .  Where is my boy&mdash;I'm crying so I can't
see either of you &mdash;Stephen!  Mother's own little boy&mdash;mother's
little, little boy&mdash;oh, it is ve'y hard&mdash;ve'y hard&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Steve &mdash;I think you'd better kiss your mother now"&mdash;his
voice choked and he turned his back and stood, the sun glittering
on the gold and scarlet of his uniform.</p>

<p>Mother and son clung, parted, clung; then Colonel Craig's glittering
sleeve was flung about them both.</p>

<p>"I'll try to bring him through all right, Celia.  You must believe
that we are coming back."</p>

<p>So they parted.</p>

<p>And at three in the morning, Celia, lying in her bed, started
to a sitting posture.  Very far away in the night reveille was
sounding for some regiment outward bound; and then the bugles
blew for another regiment and another, and another, until everywhere
the darkened world grew gaily musical with the bugle's warning.</p>

<p>She crept to the window; it was too dusky to see.  But in obscurity
she felt that not far away husband and son were passing through
darkness toward the mystery of the great unknown; and there, in
her night-dress, she knelt by the sill, hour after hour, straining
her eyes and listening until dawn whitened the east and the rivers
began to marshal their ghostly hosts.  Then the sun rose, annihilating
the phantoms of the mist and shining on columns of marching men,
endless lines of waggons, horse-batteries, foot artillery, cavalry,
engineers with gabions and pontoons, and entire divisions of blue
infantry, all pouring steadily toward Alexandria and the river,
where lay the vast transport fleet at anchor, destined to carry
them whither their Maker and commanding general willed that they
should go.</p>

<p>To Celia's wet eyes there seemed to be little variation in the
dull blue columns with the glitter of steel flickering about them;
yet, here and there a brilliant note appeared&mdash;pennons fluttering
above lances, scarfs and facings of some nearer foot battery,
and, far away toward Alexandria, vivid squares of scarlet in a
green field, dimmed very little by the distance.  Those were zouaves&mdash;her
own, or perhaps the 5th, or the 9th from Roanoke, or perhaps the
14th Brooklyn&mdash;she could not know, but she never took her eyes
from the distant blocks and oblongs of red against the green until
the woods engulfed them.</p>

<p>Ailsa still lay heavily asleep.  Celia opened the door and called
her to the window.</p>

<p>"Honey-bud, darling," she whispered tearfully, "did you know
the Lancers are leaving?"</p>

<p>Ailsa's eyes flew wide open:</p>

<p>"Not <em>his</em> regiment!"</p>

<p>"Are there two?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ailsa, frightened.  "That must be the 6th Pennsylvania.
. . .  Because I think&mdash;somebody would have told me &mdash;Colonel
Arran&#11834;"</p>

<p>She stared through eyes from which the mist of slumber had entirely
cleared away.  Then she sprang from her bed to the window:</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;<em>oh</em>!" she said half to herself, "he wouldn't go
away without saying something to me!  He couldn't!  . . .  And&mdash;oh,
dear&mdash;oh dear, their pennons <em>are</em> swallow-tailed and scarlet! 
It looks like his regiment&mdash;it does&mdash;it does! . . .  But he wouldn't
go without speaking to me&#11834;"</p>

<p>Celia turned and looked at her.</p>

<p>"Do you mean Colonel Arran?"  And saw that she did not.</p>

<p>For a while they stood there silently together, the soft spring
wind blowing over their bare necks and arms, stirring the frail,
sheer fabric of their night-robes.</p>

<p>Suddenly the stirring music of cavalry trumpets along the road
below startled them; they turned swiftly to look out upon a torrent
of scarlet pennons and glancing lance points&mdash;troop after troop
of dancing horses and blue-clad riders, their flat forage caps
set rakishly, bit and spur and sabre hilt glistening, the morning
sun flashing golden on the lifted trumpets.</p>

<p>On they came, on, on, horses' heads tossing, the ground shaking
with the mellow sound of four thousand separate hoofs,&mdash;and passed,
troop on troop, a lengthening, tossing wave of scarlet across
the verdure.</p>

<p>Then, far away in the column, a red lance pennon swung in a circle,
a blue sleeve shot up in salute and adieu.  And Ailsa knew that
Berkley had seen her, and that the brightness of the young world
was leaving her, centred there in the spark of fire that tipped
his lance.</p>

<p>Now she saw her lover turn in his saddle and, sitting so, ride
on and on, his tall lance slanting from stirrup boot to arm loop,
the morning sun bright across his face, and touching each metal
button with fire from throat to belt.</p>

<p>So her lancer rode away into the unknown; and she sat on the
edge of her bed, crying, until it was time to go on duty and sit
beside the dying in the sick wards.</p>

<p>They brought her his last letter that evening.</p>

<p>"You wicked little thing," it ran, "if you hadn't taught me self-respect
I'd have tried to run the guard to-night, and would probably have
been caught and drummed out or shot.  We're in a bustle; orders,
totally unexpected, attach us to Porter's Corps, Sykes's division
of regulars.  Warren's brigade, which includes, I believe, the
5th Zouaves, the 10th Zouaves, 6th Pennsylvania Lancers, and 1st
Connecticut Heavy Artillery.</p>

<p>"We've scarcely time to get off; our baggage will never be ready,
and how we're going to get to Alexandria and aboard ship is more
than I know.</p>

<p>"And I'm simply furious; I'd counted on a dramatic situation,
Ailsa&mdash;the soldiers farewell, loud sobs, sweetheart faints, lancer
dashes away unmanly tears&mdash;'Be strong, be br-r-rave, dah-ling!
Hevving watches over your Alonzo!'</p>

<p>"Not so.  A big brawny brute in spurs comes in the dark to stir
us with the toe of his boot.  'Silence,' he hisses, 'if you can't
hear that damn reveille, I'll punch you in the snoot, an' then
mebbe you'll spread them lop-ears o' yourn!'</p>

<p>"Heaven!  Your Alonzo is derided by a hireling!</p>

<p>"'Pack up, you swallow-tailed, leather-seated, pig-prodding sons
of galoots!'  Thus, our first sergeant, recently of the regulars,
roll-call having ended.</p>

<p>"Coffeeless, soupless, tackless, we leer furtively at the two
days' rations in our haversacks which we dare not sample; lick
our chops reflectively, are cruelly chidden by underlings in uniform,
further insulted by other underlings, are stepped on, crowded,
bitten, and kicked at by our faithful Arab steeds, are coarsely
huddled into line, where officers come to gloat over us and think
out further ingenious indignities to heap upon us while we stand
to horse.  And we stand there two hours!</p>

<p>"I can't keep up this artificial flow of low comedy.  The plain
fact of the situation is that we're being hustled toward an amphibious
thing with paddle-wheels named <em>The Skylark</em>, and I haven't
said good-bye to you.</p>

<p>"Ailsa, it isn't likely that anything is going to knock my head
off or puncture vital sections of me.  But in case the ludicrous
should happen, I want you to know that a cleaner man goes before
the last Court Marshal than would have stood trial there before
he met you.</p>

<p>"You are every inch my ideal of a woman&mdash;every fibre in you is
utterly feminine.  I adore your acquired courage, I worship your
heavenly inconsistencies.  The mental pleasure I experienced with
you was measured and limited only by my own perversity and morbid
self-absorption; the splendour of the passion I divine in you,
unawakened, awes me, leaves me in wonder.  The spiritual tonic,
even against my own sickly will has freshened me by mere contact
with the world you live in; the touch of your lips and hands&mdash;ah,
Ailsa&mdash;has taught me at last the language that I sneered at.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we can never marry.  How it will be with us, how end,
He who, after all is said and done, <em>did</em> construct us,
knows now. And we will know some day, when life is burned out
in us.</p>

<p>"Hours, days of bitter revolt come&mdash;the old madness for you,
the old recklessness of desire, the savage impatience with life,
assail me still.  Because, Ailsa, I would &mdash;I <em>could</em>
have made you a&mdash;well, an <em>interesting</em> husband, anyway. 
You were fashioned to be the divinest wife and . . .  I'm not
going on in this strain; I'll write you when I can.  And for God's
sake take care of your life.  There's nothing left if you go&mdash;<em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>"I've made a will.  Trooper Burgess, a comrade&mdash;my former valet&mdash;carries
a duplicate memorandum.  Don't weep; I'll live to make another. 
But in this one I have written you that my mother's letters and
pictures are to be yours&mdash;when I have a chance I'll draw it in
legal form.  And, dear, first be perfectly sure I'm dead, and
then destroy my mother's letters without reading them; and then
look upon her face.  And I think you will forgive me when I tell
you that it is for her sake that I can never marry.  But you will
not understand why."</p>

<p>Over this letter Ailsa had little time to wonder or to make herself
wretched, for that week orders came to evacuate the Farm Hospital
and send all sick and wounded to the General Hospital at Alexandria.</p>

<p>A telegram arrived, too, from Miss Dix, who was authorised to
detail nurses by the Secretary of War, ordering the two nurses
of Sainte Ursula's Sisterhood to await letters of recommendation
and written assignments to another hospital to be established
farther south.  But where that hospital was to be built nobody
seemed to know.</p>

<p>A week later a dozen Protestant women nurses arrived at Alexandria,
where they were made unwelcome.  Medical directors, surgeons,
ward masters objected, bluntly declaring that they wouldn't endure
a lot of women interfering and fussing and writing hysterical
nonsense to the home newspapers.</p>

<p>For a while confusion reigned, intensified by the stupendous
mobilisation going on all around.</p>

<p>A medical officer came to the Farm Hospital and angrily informed
Ailsa that the staff had had enough of women in the wards; and
from forty cots forty half-dead, ghastly creatures partly rose
and cursed the medical gentleman till his ears burned crimson,</p>

<p>Ailsa, in her thin gray habit bearing the scarlet heart, stood
in the middle of the ward and defied him with her credentials.</p>

<p>"The medical staff of the army has only to lay its case before
the Secretary of War," she said, looking calmly at him, "and that
is where the Sanitary Commission obtains its authority.  Meanwhile
our orders detail us here for duty."</p>

<p>"We'll see about that!" he snapped, backing away.</p>

<p>"So will we," said Ailsa, smiling.  But that afternoon she and
Letty took an ambulance and went, in great distress of mind, to
see Mother Angela, Superior of the Sisters of the Holy Cross,
who had arrived from Indiana ready to continue hospital duties
on the Potomac if necessary.</p>

<p>The lovely Superieure, a lady of rare culture and ability, took
Ailsa's hand in hers with a sad smile.</p>

<p>"Men's prejudices are hard to meet.  The social structure of
the world is built on them.  But men's prejudices vanish when
those same men fall sick.  The War Department has regularised
our position; it will authorise yours.  You need not be afraid."</p>

<p>She smiled again reminiscently.</p>

<p>"When our Sisters of the Holy Cross first appeared in the wards,
the patients themselves looked at us sullenly and askance.  I
heard one say: 'Why can't they take off those white-winged sun-bonnets
in the wards?' And another sneered: 'Sun-bonnets!  Huh!  They
look like busted white parasols!'  But, Mrs. Paige, our white
'sun-bonnets' have already become to them the symbol they love
most, after the flag.  Be of good courage.  Your silver-gray garb
and white cuffs will mean much to our soldiers before this battle
year is ended."</p>

<p>That evening Ailsa and Letty drove back to the Parm Hospital
in their ambulance, old black Cassius managing his mules with
alternate bursts of abuse and of praise.  First he would beat
upon his mules with a flat stick which didn't hurt, but made a
loud racket; then, satisfied, he would loll in his seat singing
in melodious and interminable recitative:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
An' I hope to gain de prommis' lan',<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yaas I do,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Deed I do.<br/>
Lor' I hope to gain de prommis' lan',<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dat I do,<br/>
An' dar I'll flap ma wings an' take ma stan',<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yaas I will,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Deed I will,<br/>
An' I'll tune ma harp an' jine de Shinin' Ban'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Glory, Glory,<br/>
I hope to gain de prommis' lan'!

</p>
</div>
<p>And over and over the same shouted melody, interrupted only by
an outburst of reproach for his mules.</p>

<p>They drove back through a road which had become for miles only
a great muddy lane running between military encampments, halted
at every bridge and crossroads to exhibit their passes; they passed
never-ending trains of army waggons cither stalled or rumbling
slowly toward Alexandria.  Everywhere were soldiers, drilling,
marching, cutting wood, washing clothes, cooking, cleaning arms,
mending, working on camp ditches, drains, or forts, writing letters
at the edge of shelter tents, digging graves, skylarking&mdash;everywhere
the earth was covered with them.</p>

<p>They passed the camp for new recruits, where the poor "fresh
fish" awaited orders to join regiments in the field to which they
had been assigned; they passed the camp for stragglers and captured
deserters; the camp for paroled prisoners; the evil-smelling convalescent
camp, which, still under Surgeon General Hammond's Department,
had not yet been inspected by the Sanitary Commission.</p>

<p>An officer, riding their way, talked with them about conditions
in this camp, where, he said, the convalescents slept on the bare
ground, rain or shine; where there were but three surgeons for
the thousands suffering from intestinal and throat and lung troubles,
destitute, squalid, unwarmed by fires, unwashed, wretched, forsaken
by the government that called them to its standard.</p>

<p>It was the first of that sort of thing that Ailsa and Letty had
seen.</p>

<p>After the battles in the West&mdash;particularly after the fall of
Fort Donnelson&mdash;terrible rumours were current in the Army of the
Potomac and in the hospitals concerning the plight of the wounded&mdash;of
new regiments that had been sent into action with not a single
medical officer, or, for that matter, an ounce of medicine, or
of lint in its chests.</p>

<p>They were grisly rumours.  In the neat wards of the Farm Hospital,
with its freshly swept and sprinkled floors, its cots in rows,
its detailed soldier nurses and the two nurses from Sainte Ursula's
Sisterhood, its sick-diet department, its medical stores, its
two excellent surgeons, these rumours found little credence.</p>

<p>And now, here in the vicinity, Ailsa's delicate nostrils shrank
from the stench arising from the "Four Camps"; and she saw the
emaciated forms lining the hillside, and she heard the horrible
and continuous coughing.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she said to Letty the next morning, "I am going
to write to Miss Dix and inform her of conditions in that camp."</p>

<p>And she did so, perfectly conscious that she was probably earning
the dislike of the entire medical department.  But hundreds of
letters like hers had already been sent to Washington, and already
the Sanitary Commission was preparing to take hold; so, when at
length one morning an acknowledgment of her letter was received,
no notice was taken of her offer to volunteer for service in that
loathsome camp, but the same mail brought orders and credentials
and transportation vouchers for herself and Letty.</p>

<p>Letty was still asleep, but Ailsa went up and waked her when
the hour for her tour of duty approached.</p>

<p>"What do you think!" she said excitedly.  "We are to pack up
our valises and go aboard the <em>Mary Lane</em> to-morrow.  She
sails with hospital stores.  <em>What</em> do you think of that?"</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" asked Letty, bewildered.</p>

<p>"You poor, sleepy little thing," said Ailsa, sitting down on
the bed's shaky edge, "I'm sure I don't know where we're going,
dear. Two Protestant nurses are coming here to superintend the
removal of our sick boys&mdash;and Dr. West says they are old and ugly,
and that Miss Dix won't have any more nurses who are not over
thirty and who are not <em>most</em> unattractive to look at."</p>

<p>"I wonder what Miss Dix would do if she saw us," said Letty naively,
and sat up in bed; rubbing her velvety eyes with the backs of
her hands.  Then she yawned, looked inquiringly at Ailsa, smiled,
and swung her slender body out of bed.</p>

<p>While she was doing her hair Ailsa heard her singing to herself.
She was very happy; another letter from Dr. Benton had arrived.</p>

<p>Celia, who had gone to Washington three days before, to see Mr.
Stanton, returned that evening with her passes and order for transportation;
and to Ailsa's astonishment and delight she found that the designated
boat was the <em>Mary Lane</em>.</p>

<p>But Celia was almost too nervous and too tired to talk over the
prospects.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said wearily, "that drive from the Chain Bridge
to Alexandria has mos'ly killed me.  I vow and declare there was
never one moment when one wheel was not in a mud hole.  All my
bones ache, Honey-bud, and I'm cross with talking to so many Yankees,
and&mdash;do you believe me !&mdash;that ve'y horrid Stanton creature gave
orders that I was to take the oath!"</p>

<p>"The&mdash;oath?" asked Ailsa, amazed.</p>

<p>"Certainly.  And I took it," she added fiercely, "becose of my
husband!  If it had not been fo' Curt I'd have told Mr. Stanton
what I thought of his old oath!"</p>

<p>"What kind of an oath was it, Celia?"</p>

<p>Celia repeated it haughtily:</p>

<p>"'I do solemnly swear, in the presence of Almighty God, to faithfully
support the Constitution of the United States, and of the State
of New York.  So he'p me God.'"</p>

<p>"It is the oath of fealty," said Ailsa in a hushed voice.</p>

<p>"It was not necessa'y," said Celia coldly.  "My husband is sufficient
to keep me&mdash;harmless. . . .  But I know what I feel in my heart,
Honey-bud; and so does eve'y Southern woman &mdash;God help us
all. . . .  Is that little Miss Lynden going with us?"</p>

<p>"Letty?  Yes, of course."</p>

<p>Celia began to undress.  "She's a ve'y sweet little minx. . .
. She is&mdash;odd, somehow. . . .  So young&mdash;such a he'pless, cute
little thing. . .  Ailsa, in that child's eyes&mdash;or in her features
somewhere, somehow, I see &mdash;I feel a&mdash;a sadness, somehow&mdash;like
the gravity of expe'ience, the <em>something</em> that wisdom
brings to the ve'y young too early.  It is odd, isn't it."</p>

<p>"Letty is a strange, gentle little thing.  I've often wondered&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What, Honey-bee?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't know," said Ailsa vaguely.  "It is not natural
that a happy woman should be so solemnly affectionate to another. 
I've often thought that she must, sometime or other, have known
deep unhappiness."</p>

<p>When Celia was ready to retire, Ailsa bade her good-night and
wandered away down the stairs, Letty was still on duty; she glanced
into the sick-diet kitchen as she passed and saw the girl bending
over a stew-pan.</p>

<p>She did not disturb her.  With evening a soft melancholy had
begun to settle over Ailsa.  It came in the evening, now, often&mdash;a
sensation not entirely sad, not unwelcome, soothing her, composing
her mind for serious thought, for the sweet sadness of memory.</p>

<p>Always she walked, now, companioned by memories of Berkley. Wherever
she moved&mdash;in the quiet of the sick wards, in the silence of the
moonlight, seated by smeared windows watching the beating rain,
in the dead house, on duty in the kitchen contriving broths, or
stretched among her pillows, always the memories came in troops
to bear her company.</p>

<p>They were with her now as she paced the veranda to and fro, to
and fro.</p>

<p>She heard Letty singing happily over her stew-pan in the kitchen;
the stir and breathing of the vast army was audible all around
her in the darkness.  Presently she looked at her watch in the
moonlight, returned it to her breast.</p>

<p>"I'm ready, dear," she said, going to the kitchen door.</p>

<p>And another night on duty was begun&mdash;the last she ever was to
spend under the quiet roof of the Farm Hospital.</p>

<p>That night she sat beside the bed of a middle-aged man, a corporal
in a Minnesota regiment whose eyes had been shot out on picket.
Otherwise he was convalescent from dysentery.  But Ailsa had seen
the convalescent camp, and she would not let him go yet.</p>

<p>So she read to him in a low, soothing voice, glancing from time
to time at the bandaged face.  And, when she saw he was asleep,
she sat silent, hands nervously clasped above the Bible on her
knee. Then her lids closed for an instant as she recited a prayer
for the man she loved, wherever he might be that moon-lit night.</p>

<p>A zouave, terribly wounded on Roanoke Island, began to fret;
she rose and walked swiftly to him, and the big sunken eyes opened
and he said, humbly:</p>

<p>"I am sorry to inconvenience you, Mrs. Paige.  I'll try to keep
quiet."</p>

<p>"You foolish fellow, you don't inconvenience me.  What can I
do for you?"</p>

<p>His gaze was wistful, but he said nothing, and she bent down
tenderly, repeating her question.</p>

<p>A slight flush gathered under his gaunt cheek bones.  "I guess
I'm just contrary," he muttered.  "Don't bother about me, ma'am."</p>

<p>"You are thinking of your wife; talk to me about her, Neil."</p>

<p>It was what he wanted; he could endure the bandages.  So, her
cool smooth hand resting lightly over his, where it lay on the
sheets, she listened to the home-sick man until it was time to
give another sufferer his swallow of lemonade.</p>

<p>Later she put on a gingham overgown, sprinkled it and her hands
with camphor, and went into the outer wards where the isolated
patients lay&mdash;where hospital gangrene and erysipelas were the
horrors.  And, farther on, she entered the outlying wing devoted
to typhus.  In spite of the open windows the atmosphere was heavy;
everywhere the air seemed weighted with the odour of decay.</p>

<p>As always, in spite of herself, she hesitated at the door.  But
the steward on duty rose; and she took his candle and entered
the place of death.</p>

<p>Toward morning a Rhode Island artilleryman, dying in great pain,
relapsed into coma.  Waiting beside him, she wrote to his parents,
enclosing the little keepsakes he had designated when conscious,
while his life flickered with the flickering candle.  Her letter
and his life ended together; dawn made the candle-light ghastly;
a few moments later the rumble of the dead waggon sounded in the
court below.  The driver came early because there was a good deal
of freight for his waggon that day.  A few moments afterward the
detail arrived with the stretchers, and Ailsa stood up, drew aside
the screen, and went down into the gray obscurity of the court-yard.</p>

<p>Grave-diggers were at work on a near hillside; she could hear
the clink clink of spade and pick; reveille was sounding from
hill to hill; the muffled stirring became a dull, sustained clatter,
never ceasing around her for one instant.</p>

<p>A laundress was boiling clothing over a fire near by; Ailsa slipped
off her gingham overdress, unbound the white turban, and tossed
them on the grass near the fire.  Then, rolling back her sleeves,
she plunged her arms into a basin of hot water in which a little
powdered camphor was floating.</p>

<p>While busy with her ablutions the two new nurses arrived, seated
on a battery limber; and, hastily drying her hands, she went to
them and welcomed them, gave them tea and breakfast in Dr. West's
office, and left them there while she went away to awake Celia
and Letty, pack her valise for the voyage before her, and write
to Berkley.</p>

<p>But it was not until she saw the sun low in the west from the
deck of the <em>Mary Lane</em>, that she at last found a moment
to write.</p>

<p>The place, the hour, her loneliness, moved depths in her that
she had never sounded&mdash;moved her to a recklessness never dreamed
of. It was an effort for her to restrain the passionate confessions
trembling on her pen's tip; her lips whitened with the cry struggling
for utterance.</p>

<p>"Dear, never before did I so completely know myself, never so
absolutely trust myself to the imperious, almost ungovernable
tide which has taken my destiny from the quiet harbour where it
lay, and which is driving it headlong toward yours.</p>

<p>"You have left me alone, to wonder and to wonder.  And while
isolated, I stand trying to comprehend why it was that your words
separated our destinies while your arms around me made them one. 
I am perfectly aware that the surge of life has caught me up,
tossed me to its crest, and is driving me blindly out across the
waste spaces of the world toward you&mdash;wherever you may be&mdash;whatever
be the cost.  I will not live without you.</p>

<p>"I am not yet quite sure what has so utterly changed me&mdash;what
has so completely changed within me.  But I am changed.  Perhaps
daily familiarity with death and pain and wretchedness, hourly
contact with the paramount mystery of all, has broadened me, or
benumbed me.  I don't know.  All I seem to see clearly&mdash;to clearly
understand&mdash;is the dreadful brevity of life, the awful chances
against living, the miracle of love in such a maelstrom, the insanity
of one who dare not confess it, live for it, love to the uttermost
with heart, soul, and body, while life endures,</p>

<p>"All my instincts, all principles inherent or inculcated; all
knowledge spiritual and intellectual, acquired; all precepts,
maxims, proverbs, axioms incorporated and lately a part of me,
seem trivial, empty, meaningless in sound and in form compared
to the plain truths of Death.  For never until now did I understand
that we walk always arm in arm with Death, that he squires us
at every step, coolly joggles our elbow, touches our shoulder
now and then, wakes us at dawn, puts out our night-light, and
smooths the sheets we sleep under.</p>

<p>"I had thought of Death as something hiding very, very far away.
Yet I had already seen him enter my own house.  But now I understand
how close he always is; and, somehow, it has changed&mdash;hardened,
maybe&mdash;much that was vague and unformed in my character.  And,
maybe, the knowledge is distorting it; I don't know.  All I know
is that, before life ends, if there is a chance of fulfilment,
I will take it.  And fulfilment means you&mdash;my love for you, the
giving of it, of myself, of all I am, all I desire, all I care
for, all I believe, into your keeping&mdash;into your embrace.  That,
for me, is fulfilment of life.</p>

<p>"Even in your arms you tell me that there is to be no fulfilment.
I have acquiesced, wondering, bewildered, confused.  But, dear,
you can never tell me so again&mdash;if we live&mdash;if I live to look
into your eyes again&mdash;never, never.  For I shall not believe it,
nor shall I let you believe it, if only we can win through this
deathly battle nightmare which is rising between us&mdash;if ever we
can find each other again, touch each other through this red,
unreal glare of war.</p>

<p>"Oh, Philip &mdash;Philip&mdash;only to have your arms around me! 
Only to touch you!  You shall not tell me then that our destinies
do not mingle.  They shall mingle like two wines; they shall become
utterly confused in one another; I was meant for that; I will
not die, isolated by you, unknown to you, not belonging to you! 
I will not die alone this way in the world, with no deeper memory
to take into the unknown than that you said you loved me.</p>

<p>"God alone knows what change misery and sorrow and love and death
have accomplished in me; never have I stood so alone upon this
earth; never have I cared so for life, never have I so desired
to be a deathless part of yours.</p>

<p>"If you love me you will make me part of yours&mdash;somehow, some
way. And, Philip, if there is no way, yet there is always one
way if we both live.  And I shall not complain&mdash;only, I cannot
die&mdash;let life go out&mdash;so that you could ever forget that my life
had been part of yours.</p>

<p>"Is it dreadful of me to think this?  But the mighty domination
of Death has dwarfed everything around me, dear; shrivelled the
little man-made formulas and laws; the living mind and body seem
more vital than the by-laws made to govern them. . . .  God knows
what I'm writing, but you have gone into battle leaving life unfulfilled
for us both, and I assented&mdash;and my heart and soul are crying
out to you, unreconciled&mdash;crying out my need of you across the
smoke. . . .</p>

<p>"There is a battery at Cock-pit Point, firing, and the smoke
of the guns drifts across the low-hanging sun.  It must be only
a salute, for our fleet of transports moves on, torrents of black
smoke pouring out of every tall funnel, paddle-wheels churning
steadily.</p>

<p>"When the fleet passed Mount Vernon the bells tolled aboard every
boat; and we could see the green trees and a glimmer of white
on shore, and the flag flying.</p>

<p>"What sadness!  A people divided who both honour the sacredness
of this spot made holy by a just man's grave&mdash;gathering to meet
in battle&mdash;brother against brother.</p>

<p>"But Fate shall not longer array you and me against each other! 
I will not have it so!  Neither my heart nor my soul could endure
the cruelty of it, nor my reason its wickedness and insanity. 
From the first instant I met your eyes, Philip, somehow, within
me, I knew I belonged to you.  I do more hopelessly to-day than
ever&mdash;and with each day, each hour, more and more until I die. 
You will not let me go to my end unclaimed, will you?&mdash;a poor
ghost all alone, lost in the darkness somewhere among the stars&mdash;lacking
that tie between you and it which even death does not know how
to sever!</p>

<p>"I leave all to you, loving you, wishing what you wish, content
with what you give&mdash;and take&mdash;so that you do give and take and
keep and hold for life.</p>

<p>"It is very dusky; the lights, red and white, glimmer on every
transport.  We feel the sea-swell a little.  Celia left us, going
ashore at Acquia Creek.  She takes the cars to Richmond and then
to Paigecourt.  Letty sits beside me on deck.  There were two
cases of fever aboard and we went down into a dreadfully ill-smelling
cabin to do what we could.  Now we are here on deck again.  Some
officers are talking very gaily with Letty.  I am ending my letter
to you&mdash;wherever you are, my darling, under these big, staring
stars that look down at me out of space.  I don't want my ghost
to be blown about up there&mdash;unless it belongs to you.  That is
the only fear of death I ever have or ever had&mdash;that I might die
before you had all of me there is to give."</p>
