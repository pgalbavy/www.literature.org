A MAN once kept a Goat and an Ass.  The Goat, envying the Ass on
account of his greater abundance of food, said, "How shamefully
you are treated:  at one time grinding in the mill, and at another
carrying heavy burdens"; and he further advised him to pretend to
be epileptic and fall into a ditch and so obtain rest.  The Ass
listened to his words, and falling into a ditch, was very much
bruised.  His master, sending for a leech, asked his advice.  He
bade him pour upon the wounds the lungs of a Goat.  They at once
killed the Goat, and so healed the Ass.
