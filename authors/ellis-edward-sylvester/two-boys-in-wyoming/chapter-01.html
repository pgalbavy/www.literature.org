<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>You should have seen those youths, for it gives me pleasure to
say that two manlier, more plucky and upright boys it would be
hard to find anywhere in this broad land of ours. I have set out
to tell you about their remarkable adventures in the grandest
section of the West, and, before doing so, it is necessary for
you to know something concerning the lads themselves.</p>

<p>Jack Dudley was in his seventeenth year. His father was a prosperous
merchant, who intended his only son for the legal profession.
Jack was bright and studious, and a leader in his class at the
Orphion Academy; and this leadership was not confined to his studies,
for he was a fine athlete and an ardent lover of outdoor sports.
If you witnessed the game between the eleven of the Orphion Academy
and the Oakdale Football Club, which decided the championship
by a single point in favor of the former, you were thrilled by
the sight of the half-back, who, at a critical point in the contest,
burst through the group which thronged about him, and, with a
clear field in front, made a superb run of fifty yards, never
pausing until he stooped behind the goal-posts and made a touchdown.
Then, amid the cheers of the delighted thousands, he walked back
on the field, and while one of the players lay down on the ground,
with the spheroid delicately poised before his face, the same
youth who made the touchdown smote the ball mightily with his
sturdy right foot and sent it sailing between the goal-posts as
accurately as an arrow launched from a bow.</p>

<p>That exploit, as I have said, won the championship for the Orphions,
and the boy who did it was Jack Dudley. In the latter half of
the game, almost precisely the same opening presented itself again
for the great half-back, but he had no more than fairly started
when he met an obstruction in his path. The gritty opponent tackled
him like a tiger, and down they went, rolling over in the dirt,
with a fierce violence that made more than one timid spectator
fear that both were seriously injured. As if that were not enough,
the converging players pounced upon them. There was a mass of
struggling, writhing youths, with Jack underneath, and all piling
on top of him. The last arrival, seeing little chance for effective
work, took a running leap, and, landing on the apex of the pyramid,
whirling about while in the air so as to alight on his back, kicked
up his feet and strove to made himself as heavy as he could.</p>

<p>The only object this young man seemed to have was to batter down
the score of players and flatten out Jack Dudley, far below at
the bottom; but when, with the help of the referee, the mass was
disentangled, and Jack, with his mop-like hair, his soiled uniform,
and his grimy face, struggled to his feet and pantingly waited
for the signal from his captain, he was just as good as ever.
It takes a great deal to hurt a rugged youth, who has no bad habits
and is in sturdy training.</p>

<p>The active lad who had downed Jack when going at full speed,
and nipped in the bud his brilliant attempt, was Fred Greenwood,
only a few months younger. He was full-back for the Oakdales and
their best player. Furthermore, he was the closest friend of Jack
Dudley. In the game it was war to the knife between them, but
in the very crisis of the terrific struggle neither had a harsh
thought or a spark of jealousy of the other. Fred led the cheering
of the opposing eleven when Jack kicked such a beautiful goal,
but gritted his teeth and muttered:</p>

<p>"You did well, my fine fellow, but just try it again&mdash;that's
all!"</p>

<p>And Jack <em>did</em> try it again, as I have explained, and,
tackling him low, Fred downed him. While the two were apparently
suffocating under the mountain, Fred spat out a mouthful of dirt
and said:</p>

<p>"I got you that time, Jack."</p>

<p>"It has that look, but&#11834;"</p>

<p>Jack meant to finish his sentence, but at that moment the mountain
on top sagged forward and jammed his head so deeply into the earth
that his voice was too muffled to be clear. Besides, it was not
really important that the sentence should be rounded out, since
other matters engaged his attention. The two friends went through
the game without a scratch, except that Jack's face was skinned
along the right cheek, one eye was blackened, both legs were bruised,
and half his body was black and blue, and it was hard work for
him to walk for a week afterward. The condition of Fred, and indeed
of nearly every member of the two elevens, was much the same.</p>

<p>But what of it? Does a football-player mind a little thing like
that? Rather is he not proud of his scars and bruises, which attest
his skill and devotion to his own club? And then Jack had the
proud exultation of knowing that it was he who really won the
championship for his side. As for Fred, it is true he was disappointed
over the loss of the deciding game, but it was by an exceedingly
narrow margin; and he and his fellow-players, as they had their
hair cut so as to make them resemble civilized beings, said, with
flashing eyes and a significant shake of the head:</p>

<p>"Wait till next year, and things will be different."</p>

<p>Fred Greenwood was the son of a physician of large practice,
whose expectation was that his son would follow the same profession,
though the plans of the parents were in a somewhat hazy shape,
owing to the youth of the boy. As I have already said, he and
Jack Dudley had been comrades or chums almost from infancy. They
were strong, active, clear-brained lads, who had not yet learned
to smoke cigarettes or cigars, and gave no cause to fear that
they would ever do so. It is not necessary to state that neither
knew the taste of beer or alcoholic drinks, nor did they wish
to learn. They understood too well the baleful effects of such
indulgences to be in danger of ruining their bodies and souls,
as too many other youths are doing at this very time.</p>

<p>Doctor Greenwood had been the family physician of the Dudleys
for many years. The heads of the families were college mates at
Harvard, and continued their intimacy after the marriage of each,
so that it was quite natural that their sons should become fond
of each other. The fathers were sensible men, and so long as their
boys' fondness for athletic sports did not interfere with their
studies the gentlemen encouraged them, and, when possible, were
present at the contests between the representatives of the schools.</p>

<p>When Jack Dudley was presented with a shotgun and allowed to
make an excursion down the Jersey coast Fred was his companion,
and the two had rare sport in shooting duck and wild fowl. They
became quite expert for boys, and before the hunting season set
in did considerable fishing in the surrounding waters, and both
learned to be skilful swimmers and boatmen.</p>

<p>Mr. Dudley was wealthier than his professional friend, though
the large practice of the physician placed him in comfortable
circumstances. In one of his many business transactions Mr. Dudley
found that he had to choose between losing a considerable sum
of money and accepting a half-ownership in a ranch in the new
State of Wyoming. There seemed little choice between the two horns
of the dilemma, for he saw no prospect of ever getting any money
out of the Western land, but he accepted the ownership, the other
half of which was divided among three gentlemen, one of whom lived
in Cheyenne, and the others in Chicago.</p>

<p>It is perhaps worth noting that although the fathers of Jack
and Fred were great admirers of athletics, and, as I have said,
encouraged the devotion to them shown by their sons, yet neither
was inclined that way in his youth.</p>

<p>"I never expected to own a foot of ground west of the Mississippi,"
remarked Mr. Dudley, when making a call upon the doctor, "and
here, before I fairly knew it, I have become a half-owner in a
ranch away out in Wyoming."</p>

<p>"Eventually it may prove worth something," suggested Doctor Greenwood,
"for that section has enormous capabilities, and a tide of emigration
has been moving that way for years."</p>

<p>"It will take a long time to fill up that country with people.
Meanwhile I'll sell out cheap, doctor, if you feel like investing."</p>

<p>The physician laughed and thought the joke was on his friend.
He said he would think the matter over, which was another way
of saying he would do nothing more than think of it.</p>

<p>Jack and Fred were present at this interview, and listened with
keen attention to the discussion of the Western purchase. By and
by Fred gave his chum a significant look, and, excusing themselves
to their parents, they passed out of the room and up stairs to
the sleeping-quarters of Fred. The door was carefully closed behind
them, and, drawing their chairs close together, they talked in
low tones, as if some dreadful penalty would follow a discovery
of what was passing between them. Had any one been able to see
the two attractive countenances, he would not have had to be told
that the same thought was in the mind of each.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Jack," said Fred, with impressive solemnity, "it
would be a shame; it will never do; we must not allow it."</p>

<p>"Allow what?"</p>

<p>"Why you heard your father say that he never expected to go out
to Wyoming to look at that ranch he has bought."</p>

<p>"I could have told you that much, without waiting for him to
say it. It will be just like him to give it away for a song."</p>

<p>"And who knows but that it contains valuable gold or silver mines?
I have heard of treasures being bought in that way."</p>

<p>"That may be," was the thoughtful response of Jack, "though I
believe most of Wyoming&mdash;that is the valleys and plains&mdash;is a
grazing country."</p>

<p>"I don't know much about the country, but I have read enough
to learn that the greatest discoveries of gold and silver have
been in places where no one expected to find them. What I am getting
at, Jack, is that your father should make up his mind not to part
with his interest in the ranch till he knows all about it."</p>

<p>"How is he to learn, when he won't go near it? Of course he can
write to the people out there, but likely they will not tell him
the truth."</p>

<p>"He must send some one whom he can trust, and let him investigate."</p>

<p>"That does seem to be a sensible plan," remarked Jack, as if
the thought had not been in his mind from the first.</p>

<p>"A sensible plan!" repeated the enthusiastic Fred, "it is the
<em>only</em> plan; nothing else can make it sure that he is not
being swindled out of a big fortune."</p>

<p>Jack was silent a moment, while he looked steadily into the brown
eyes of his chum, who half-smilingly met the scrutiny. Then the
whole scheme burst forth.</p>

<p>"And whom can your father trust before <em>us</em>? He must see
that the best thing he can do is to send us out there to make
a full investigation. We won't charge him anything like what he
would have to pay other folks."</p>

<p>"Of course not; only our travelling expenses and supplies."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by supplies?"</p>

<p>"Say a Winchester rifle and a revolver apiece, with the proper
ammunition; what sort of supplies did you think I meant?"</p>

<p>"I thought it was food, while we were out hunting."</p>

<p>Jack turned up his nose.</p>

<p>"If we can't keep ourselves supplied with food, when we are in
a country that has the finest game in the world, we deserve to
starve."</p>

<p>"My sentiments exactly;" and as if the coincidence required something
in the nature of a compact, the boys shook hands over it.</p>

<p>"What a splendid treat it would be for us to spend some weeks
out in Wyoming!" exclaimed Jack Dudley, his eyes sparkling and
his cheeks glowing; "it looks as if it were providential that
father got hold of that ranch."</p>

<p>"There can't be any doubt about it; but how much more providential
it will be if we are sent to learn all that should be learned
about it! I wonder if that can be brought about?"</p>

<p>Enough has been told for the reader to understand the plot formed
by these two youths. There could be no question of the grand treat
it would prove to both, provided their parents could be persuaded
to take the same view of the matter; <em>there</em> was the rub.</p>

<p>Jack crossed his legs and thoughtfully scratched his head. Unconsciously
Fred did the same.</p>

<p>"It's a tougher problem than we ever attacked in Euclid," remarked
the younger. Then a bright thought struck him.</p>

<p>"Don't I look a little pale, Jack?"</p>

<p>"You look as if a month's vacation in the autumn would be acceptable;
but the fact is, Fred, I never saw you look better than you do
this minute."</p>

<p>Fred sighed.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I can't work that on father. He's too good a doctor
for me to worry him about my health."</p>

<p>"How about <em>me</em>?"</p>

<p>Fred shook his head.</p>

<p>"You look as strong as an oak knot, and you are, too; no, we
can't make them think we are in need of a month in Wyoming. We
shall have to try another tack. Now, there is no doubt that if
we spend the month of September putting in extra work on our studies,
we can stand the following month in laying off. We shall come
back with new vigor and appetite, and soon catch up with our class."</p>

<p>"There isn't a particle of doubt about that, but it still remains
that we must convince our fathers that it will be a wise course
to send us away from home. We can't do it by looking pale and
weak, for we can't look pale and weak. We must fix on something
else or it's no go."</p>

<p>"Why not fall back on what we first talked about?"</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Make your father think it will be a prudent thing for him to
send you out there to look after his property."</p>

<p>"Suppose I should convince him on that point, how about <em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>"You will need some one to look after you, and I'm just the fellow."</p>

<p>"We are both satisfied in our own minds; in fact we were from
the first; but our fathers are very hard-headed men."</p>

<p>Now, a couple of boys may be very shrewd, but it often happens
that their parents are a good deal shrewder, a fact which my young
readers will do well to remember.</p>

<p>Unsuspected by Jack Dudley and Fred Greenwood, their parents
read on the instant the momentous problem which assumed form in
the brains of their sons. When the younger signalled to his chum
to follow him out of the room, the two gentlemen understood what
it meant as clearly as if they overheard all the conversation
that followed. Waiting until they were beyond hearing, Doctor
Greenwood looked at his friend and remarked, with a smile:</p>

<p>"They are hit hard."</p>

<p>"No doubt of it; their hearts are set on making a visit to the
ranch, and it would be singular if it were otherwise. We can feel
for them, for we were once boys."</p>

<p>"Yes, John, and it's longer ago than we like to recall. What
do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"You know we have always agreed that many parents injure their
children by undue indulgence."</p>

<p>"True, and we have been indulgent to ours, but not improperly
so. A great deal depends upon the children themselves. Jack and
Fred are obedient, studious, and have good principles. If we should
say 'No' to this scheme of theirs they would be disappointed,
almost beyond what we can understand, but neither would protest
or sulk. They would study just as hard as ever. It is that which
appeals to us. If they were sullen and dissatisfied we wouldn't
care; but, John, you and I have each been blessed with model sons,
and they are entitled to privileges which it would not be safe
to grant to other boys. I confess I feel like sending both out
to Wyoming for an outing."</p>

<p>"Of course it would spoil the enjoyment of Jack unless he could
take Fred with him, but what excuse shall we make, Doc?"</p>

<p>How reluctant a father is to appear weak and too conciliatory
toward his child! These two men had virtually decided to grant
the fervent wish of their sons, but it must be done in a common-sense
way. They could not say "Boys, since you have set your hearts
on this we grant it," but they must fix upon some scheme that
would made it seem a necessity that they should go thither.</p>

<p>And now observe how ludicrously similar their thoughts were to
those that were agitating their offspring up stairs.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking," observed the physician, "of suggesting
to them that they are in need of an extension of their vacation;
but what a farce it would be! School opens next Monday, and they
are the types of rugged health, strength and activity. If I undertook
to make such a proposition I couldn't keep my face straight, and
I am sure both would burst out laughing."</p>

<p>"I know <em>I</em> should, if I were present."</p>

<p>"Parents must not make dunces of themselves before their children,"
was the philosophical remark of the physician; "some other plan
must be adopted."</p>

<p>Mr. Dudley leaned forward in his chair and slapped the shoulder
of the physician, his face aglow.</p>

<p>"I have it, Doc!"</p>

<p>"Let me hear it, for I admit that I am cornered."</p>

<p>"I will take the ground that, since I have become part owner
of this large tract of land, my first duty is to learn the truth
about it. I can write to parties out there, but they are all strangers
to me, and there is no saying how much reliance can be placed
on their reports. What is necessary is an agent who will make
an intelligent and honest report; and surely we can trust our
own sons to do that."</p>

<p>"But, John," remarked the doctor, with his pleasant smile, "there
are scores of people right here at home who will do that for you.
Suppose Jack reminds you of the fact?"</p>

<p>"If he hasn't any more sense than to make such a suggestion,
then, by gracious! I'll punish him by sending some one else."</p>

<p>"Little fear of Jack saying anything of that nature. Even if
he undertook to do so, Fred would place his hand over his mouth.
But, John, let's understand the matter before we say anything
to them. Your plan of sending out Jack to inspect the property
is a good one. It sounds business-like, and must strike them that
way; so that difficulty is removed. You and I don't know anything
about the region, nor the best time for hunting game, but it is
fair to believe that the month of October will be suitable. Suppose
we keep them in school throughout September, and then give them
a month's leave of absence, to examine and report upon your property.
If all goes well, they are to appear here, ready to resume their
studies on the first Monday in November."</p>

<p>"I can suggest no improvement upon that. No doubt the young rascals
are up-stairs, plotting how to bring us round to their way of
thinking. Suppose you call them down, Doc. Shall you or I unfold
our brilliant scheme?"</p>

<p>"You, by all means, since the property is yours."</p>

<p>The physician opened the door of his office and called "Fred!"
There was instant response, "Yes, sir." "I would like to see you
and Jack for a few minutes in the office."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; we are coming."</p>

<p>And a minute later they arrived, handsome, glowing and expectant.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dudley has something to say to you, Jack."</p>

<p>Both boys turned their faces expectantly toward the gentleman
named, who crossed his legs, cleared his throat and looked very
grave.</p>

<p>"My son, Doctor Greenwood and I have been discussing that property
of mine in the new State of Wyoming. We have agreed that I ought
to learn something about it before selling my interest in the
same. To secure such reliable information it is necessary to send
some one thither whom we know to be truthful and honest. The doctor
thinks, and I agree with him, that the right one to go is you,
Jack&mdash;that is, if you have no objections."</p>

<p>The parent paused for a reply, and Jack, as if the matter was
too important to be disposed of hastily, answered:</p>

<p>"I don't think of any objections just now, father."</p>

<p>"Very well; I am glad to hear it. If any occur to you, you will
let me know, so that I can engage some one else."</p>

<p>"I'll let you know at once, if I think of any."</p>

<p>"Very well. Our plan is that you and Fred shall resume your studies
next Monday, and keep right at them to the close of the month.
On the first of October you will start for Wyoming&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"I am surprised, my son, that you should interrupt me with that
question. Do you suppose I would allow you to spend a month in
that wild region without a companion to look after you? No, sir!
Fred goes with you. I entrust you to his care, and expect him
to bring you back in time to resume your studies on the first
Monday in November. It is very kind in the doctor to consent to
the arrangement. I hope you appreciate it, sir."</p>

<p>"I thank him very much," said Jack, looking toward the physician,
who just then drew his hand across his mouth to suppress the smile
that was tugging at the corners.</p>

<p>"Of course," continued Mr. Dudley, still with the manner of a
philosopher, "in visiting such a section, inhabited by large and
fierce game, you must take every precaution. I shall furnish each
of you with a repeating Winchester, a revolver, and such other
articles as may be necessary. We will now excuse you, with the
understanding that if any objections occur to either, you will
let us know at once, so that you may continue your studies, while
I engage other parties to attend to this business."</p>

<p>"I'll think it over," replied Jack, tremulous with delight.</p>

<p>And then he and his chum withdrew and went up-stairs again to
the room of Fred Greenwood, who hastily closed the door. The next
instant they were hugging each other, and dancing about as if
their senses had forsaken them; and indeed it may be said that
for a brief while such was the fact.</p>

<p>"Fred," said the happy Jack, when there was a lull in the excitement,
"we must fix upon a name for ourselves."</p>

<p>"I thought our parents attended to that a good many years ago."</p>

<p>"You know what I mean; we need some title that will distinguish
us from all other young gentlemen of our acquaintance. How does
'W. R.' strike you?"</p>

<p>"'W. R.'? What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"The 'Wyoming Rangers;' that sounds rather high-toned."</p>

<p>Fred shook his head.</p>

<p>"We are not going West to reduce the aboriginal population; I
hope we shall have no trouble with the red men. When we get among
the people who have always lived there, such a title will make
us ridiculous, for it smacks of conceit; it assumes too much."</p>

<p>"Suppose <em>you</em> suggest something?"</p>

<p>"Let's call ourselves the 'V. W. W.'; that surely will be appropriate."</p>

<p>"What do those letters mean?"</p>

<p>"The 'Verdant Wanderers of Wyoming;' that is precisely what we
shall be."</p>

<p>Jack Dudley laughed, and at first protested, but finally agreed
to accept the title as fitting and appropriate, and it was so
ordered.</p>
