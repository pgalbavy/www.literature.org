<p>Jack's chagrin was deepened the more he reflected upon the singular
occurrence.  Had he been outwitted by some skillfully-executed
trick of the Indians, he would have accepted it as a mishap liable
to overthrow the most experienced ranger of the woods; but he
felt he ought to have known on the instant that no real bear would
have attempted anything of the kind.</p>

<p>There was not a phase of the artifice which was not a reproach
to him.  Had the beast used the enclosure as a den or a retreat&mdash;a
thing of itself incredible&mdash;the evidence of that fact would have
been noticed the moment the boys climbed within.  Then the likelihood
of his clambering up the inclined tree in the presence of a war
party of Shawanoes and Miamis, who had laid it for that very purpose,
was too grotesquely absurd to be thought of with patience.</p>

<p>"Maybe it is as well," he said, with an effort to extract some
consolation from the blunder; "for perhaps it will lead them to
repeat the trick."</p>

<p>"Mine gracious! why didn't he drop down onto mine bead?" said
Otto, stepping hastily away from his position; "he would have
mashed me out as flat as&#11834;as&mdash;as a big tree itself."</p>

<p>"I don't see why they didn't form a procession of bears and walk
right over among us?  We would have stood still and allowed them
to hug us to death."</p>

<p>Admitting the only explanation that presented itself, Jack and
Otto were not yet able fully to account for the proceeding.  The
labor of dragging the fallen trunk and lifting the butt to the
wall, seemed too great to suppose it was to be used only to allow
one of the Indians to climb to the top and peer over upon the
boys beneath. The same thing could be accomplished by ascending
one of the trees and avoiding the peril to which some of them
had been exposed.</p>

<p>But, beside all that, what in reality was gained by taking a
peep at the youths?  The assailants knew they were there, and
it could not matter a jot in what particular manner they were
employing themselves.  They could do nothing that could give those
on the outside the slightest concern.  It was the defenders whose
interests required the anticipation of the movements of the warriors.</p>

<p>"I can't understand it," said Jack, standing close to his friend
and talking in a low voice.</p>

<p>"So ain't <em>I&mdash;</em>harks!"</p>

<p>They listened a full minute, but the silence could not have been
more profound.  A gentle wind stirred the leaves overhead, and
the tops of the trees nearest them could be seen slightly swaying
against the clear sky beyond.  The murmur of the great forest
was like the voice of silence itself while the almost inaudible
murmur of the Mississippi, sweeping so near, made itself manifest
the first time since they had turned at bay.</p>

<p>The deep quiet was more impressive than the whoops and screeches
of the warriors would have been.  Under such circumstances, it
boded mischief, and the utter uncertainty of its nature almost
unsettled the remarkable courage both up to that moment had displayed.</p>

<p>"I hears nodings," added Otto; "I'mebbe don't go to sleep and
wait for the night to come."</p>

<p>"Night is a good many hours off," replied Jack, with an uneasy
glance at the sky, which showed him the sun had not yet reached
meridian; "they can beat any people in the world waiting, when
they have a mind to do so, but there's been no necessity of halting
at all.  If they had followed up over the logs it would have been
all ended by this time."</p>

<p>"Yaw; they would have tumbled all over us, like a pig lot of
trees falling down, but now I dinks they waits."</p>

<p>"Why will they do that?"</p>

<p>"If dey climbs over like as dey didn't does, don somepody git
hurt, but if dey holds on till night den we'll have to climb over
and falls on 'em."</p>

<p>This was Otto's manner of expressing what was inevitable, in
case the besiegers should conclude to wait for the hour, which
could not be very distant, when the defenders must lose all power
of resistance.</p>

<p>The two did not forget to keep a continuous guard over the "watch-towers"
of the enemy.  Despite the repulse that had followed their attempts,
it was by no means uncertain that they would not repeat them. 
The success of the bear trick was likely to tempt them to another
essay in the same direction.</p>

<p>Otto Relstaub was leaning against the solid logs, his position
such that the sun, which was now near meridian, shone directly
upon him. His friend was almost immediately opposite&mdash;the two
looking in each other's face, and exchanging words in low tones.</p>

<p>All at once the German became sensible of something cool just
behind his neck.</p>

<p>"Vot ain't dot?" he said, putting up his hand as though to brush
away some insect.  Striking nothing, he turned to look.</p>

<p>"O-oh-oh!" he said, with a wondering expression, and an expansion
of his big, honest eyes.</p>

<p>"There's an opening behind you," remarked his friend, moving
hastily across to where he stood.</p>

<p>"Yaw; I sees him.  Where's he been hiding himself when I voon't
looking for him not a little while ago."</p>

<p>It certainly was curious that both boys should have made such
a minute examination of the interior without finding the crevice
between a couple of the logs, large enough to admit the passage
of several bullets, and through which it would have been an easy
matter for their enemies to shoot him who stood immediately in
front.</p>

<p>The opening was some six inches wide, and no more than an eighth
of an inch in height, resembling the crevice through which the
captain looks out upon the enemy from the turret of a monitor. 
The fact that the red men had made no use of it was proof they
did not suspect its existence, though that did not lessen the
wonder of Otto that he had failed to find it himself, when making
search.</p>

<p>"I see!" suddenly exclaimed Jack, who was attentively examining
the place.  "No wonder you missed it, for it was closed up.  You
must have rubbed one of your long ears against the stick which
fits it so closely."</p>

<p>The piece with which it had been closed lay on the ground, at
the feet of the boys, and made clear why they had failed to find
that for which they had hunted so carefully.</p>

<p>Jack cut the stick apart with his knife and reinserted one half
with a view of rendering it less liable to attract the notice
of the besiegers.  Then, quite sure that it was still unknown
to them, he leaned forward with his eye to the opening.</p>

<p>"While I'm peeping here keep a lookout elsewhere, Otto."</p>

<p>His friend nodded, to signify he would be obeyed, and then Jack
took a survey of his surroundings.</p>

<p>It so happened that he stood nearly under the tree which leaned
against the wall, and thus gained a good view.  He certainly saw
enough to interest the most indifferent spectator.  Five painted
Indian warriors were seen standing around what seemed to be a
dancing bear, who was gesticulating with his fore paws.  Suddenly
he cast off the shaggy hide and revealed the redskin who bad made
the audacious ascent on the log in his disguise and peeped over
on the boys below.</p>

<p>He seemed to be talking with his friends, while the whole half
dozen were gesticulating with great energy, though, in spite of
their excitement, their words were spoken so low that our friends
could hear little more than the jumbling murmur of their voices.</p>

<p>No doubt more Indians were close at hand, but Jack saw none. 
He stealthily removed the other part of the stick, and thereby
widened his view considerably, but he still failed to discover
anything more.  His vision took in the tree up which Deerfoot
had climbed, but nothing was to be observed of him, or of any
others gathered around the base.</p>

<p>Convinced that they were on the other side of the fort, Jack
gave his whole attention to those before him.</p>

<p>It looked very much as if the author of the trick described was
regaling his friends with an account of the highly successful
manner in which he had played his points on the unsuspecting parties
within the enclosure.</p>

<p>Jack was convinced that the rifle-shot which he and his friend
heard, before rushing into the refuge, was the one that slew the
bear.  The Indians had hastily skinned the animal, probably completing
the task near the time they became aware of the presence or rather
the flight of the two boys.  They had united in the pursuit, taking
the bear-skin with them, and its use in the manner described was
suggested by the prostrate tree lying so close to the logs, though
even that theory failed fully to satisfy the questions of the
youth.</p>

<p>Another interesting discovery was that he had seen two of the
Shawanoes before.  He had no difficulty in recognizing them as
those who had shown such eagerness to follow the trail of the
hunter that had shot the panther some distance back on the path.</p>

<p>The warrior who had masqueraded in the character of a big, black
bear belonged to the Miami tribe, the representatives of the two
joining hands in the crusade against the young pioneers.  Neither
the wounded red man nor the one who was past wounding was to be
seen anywhere.</p>

<p>The vigorous and somewhat suppressed conversation among the group
continued a few minutes and then abruptly stopped.  The entire
party seemed to have become "talked out" the same instant.</p>

<p>"Now they will hatch up some more mischief," was the thought
of the watcher.  "I don't think it likely they will send that
bear up the tree again. If they do he will come down a little
quicker than he goes up."</p>

<p>The sensations of the young Kentuckian were very peculiar, when
he became aware that the Shawanoe who had displayed so much skill
in hunting for his footprints in the twilight was looking directly
toward him.  He seemed in fact to be gazing into the eyes of the
youth, as though he was striving to stare him out of countenance.</p>

<p>Jack would have been glad at that moment had the opening been
hermetically sealed; but, hopeful that he was not seen, he held
his place, not stirring in the slightest, and striving to the
utmost to keep from winking his eyes.</p>

<p>The singular tableau lasted much less time than the boy imagined.
All at once the hum of conversation was renewed, every one of
the half dozen seeming to be seized with the impulse at the same
moment. He who had been gazing so steadily at Jack looked in the
face of one of his comrades.  Instantly the boy moved to one side
and replaced the rest of the stick, so that the crevice was closed
once more.</p>

<p>"There," he exclaimed, with a sigh, "I never was placed in a
more trying situation than that."</p>

<p>"Vot voon't dot?"</p>

<p>Jack quickly told his experience, and his companion shuddered
and shrugged his shoulders in sympathy.</p>

<p>"Have you seen any of them among the trees?"</p>

<p>"No.  They vill not go to roost, I dinks, till the sun comes
down."</p>

<p>"It won't do to calculate on that.  If they wait they will try
some new tricks."</p>

<p>"Vot can't them try?"</p>

<p>"The trouble is we cannot guess.  You know the Indians are so
cunning that they will think out something&mdash;"</p>

<p>Zip!</p>

<p>Both boys started and looked around.  Something had entered the
enclosure like a bullet fired from a gun.</p>

<p>"Look!" whispered Jack, pointing to the other side, where an
Indian arrow was seen sticking in the logs, at a point half way
between the ground and the top.</p>

<p>"I dinks they used guns and not arrows," said the astonished,
Otto, standing motionless and staring at the missile, whose barb
was still trembling from the force with which it had been driven
into the solid wood.</p>

<p>"They do use guns only," said Jack.  "That arrow was fired by
Deerfoot!"</p>

<p>"Dere is one piece of paper tied around mit it."</p>

<p>"It is a message from Deerfoot!" said Jack, stepping forward
and, with considerable effort, drawing forth the arrow.</p>
