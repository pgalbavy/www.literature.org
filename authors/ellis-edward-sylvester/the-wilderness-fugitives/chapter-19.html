<p>"I forgot," Rosa answered, laughingly; "but you must try to put
a little more logic in what you say."</p>

<p>"Logic!" repeated the young man. "What does a woman know about
logic? However, we will discuss that some other time. Just now
I'm busy with the new idea of Ned's. There's a good deal in what
you said," he added, addressing his companion again, "and the
more I consider it, the more favorably am I inclined. We can continue
up the Susquehanna till we go so far that there's no danger from
the Indians, and, when we believe the way is clear, we can come
back. Colonel Butler is not going to stay long at Wyoming, for
he dare not. He don't know how soon there will be a gathering
of the forces that will swoop down on him, and he'll get out while
he can. Consequently all we have to do is to remain invisible
until he leaves."</p>

<p>"Nothing easier in the world," was the prompt remark of Ned,
backing up his friend. "Jack, here, can keep out of their reach
with no trouble. It would be a great relief to your parents, too,
to know that Rosa is not running such a risk as it will be to
try to get into the fort at Wilkesbarre."</p>

<p>"How angry Butler will be!" exclaimed Jo, with as much zest as
if he saw the villain tearing his hair on account of his disappointment.</p>

<p>The plan of the young scouts was pretty well unfolded by this
time, so that both were satisfied the Mohawk knew what the opinions
were, and was able to give his own for the asking. Calm consideration
of the proposition of the friends and companions must lead one
to speak of them favorably. Colonel Butler knew that the fugitives
were aiming for Wilkesbarre, and had taken every precaution to
secure their capture. Nothing could be more certain than that
they could not enter, nor even approach within range of the fortifications
of that place, without encountering some of these redmen or Tories.
It would seem, therefore, that the most foolhardy thing for the
whites to do was to persevere in the effort to reach that place
in the face of such danger. There were plenty of other directions
that could be taken, and the plan suggested by the youths in their
brief conversation was only one of the many that suggested themselves
whenever they thought of the subject. Jo Minturn, believing their
wishes had been sufficiently uncovered by what had been said,
now addressed himself directly to the Mohawk:</p>

<p>"Lena-Wingo, you heard what we said; now I should like to know
what you think of it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense."</p>

<p>There it was! an opinion about which there could be no misunderstanding.
There was enough moonlight for the young scouts to see each other's
faces, and they stared in blank dismay. The next thing they did
was to look at Rosa, who was trying hard to restrain her laughter.</p>

<p>"You ought to be satisfied," she said, "without scowling at me
that way; you asked Lena-Wingo what he thought of your plans,
which you and Ned fixed up between you, and he told you in one
word."</p>

<p>"That's the trouble; he didn't take quite as many words as we
would have liked to hear. If he had talked the whole thing over,
we would have gained a chance to argue, and perhaps convince him."</p>

<p>The Mohawk, as a matter of course, heard all that passed between
his friends, and he seemed to think the time had come for him
to put in an additional word or two.</p>

<p>"All nonsense," he said, by way of introducing the subject. "The
Iroquois say Lena-Wingo shan't go to Wilkesbarre&mdash;all lie &mdash;Lena-Wingo
<em>will</em> go there &mdash;Iroquois say Lena-Wingo shan't take
gal there&mdash;all lie&mdash;<em>will</em> take gal there &mdash;Iroquois
say Lena-Wingo run away from Brandt&mdash;all lie&mdash;<em>never</em> run
away."</p>

<p>These broken sentences contained the secret of the Mohawk's course
of action. It had now become a matter of pride with him, and since
the Tories and Indians had made such elaborate preparations to
prevent the fugitives reaching Wilkesbarre, he was fired by the
resolve that the lines should be passed through, and the maiden
placed safely behind the fortifications at that town. In making
this determination he did not forget the interests of Rosa. He
knew what he was doing, and was sure that he could accomplish
it with safety to her, though he felt there was a possible doubt
about running the two young men through the environing danger.</p>

<p>He saw, as well as his companions, that the plan proposed by
them was attended with little danger, but when a scheme was in
that shape it lost all attraction for him. To escape the Iroquois
by dodging or running was attended, in his estimation, with a
certain ignominy that made it repulsive to him. He was naturally
elated in reflecting how neatly he had just outwitted them, and
that fact was not calculated to lessen his confidence in his own
prowess.</p>

<p>"Well, Lena-Wingo," said Jo, when the ripple of fun had died
out, "you seem to have made up your mind on the subject, and I
suppose there is no use of arguing with you."</p>

<p>"No use," was the response of the Indian.</p>

<p>"If that's the case," added Ned, "we may as well dismiss it,
and find out what is to be done."</p>

<p>"Go to Wilkesbarre," said the Mohawk, as if he were determined
there should be no misunderstanding of his position.</p>

<p>"I understand that, but the night must be pretty well gone, and
it won't do for us to sit here for two or three days, so I would
like to know what the next step is to be."</p>

<p>Ned Clinton expressed the wish that was on the tongue of his
two friends, and they listened eagerly to the reply. The Indian
straightened up his form, so that his slim, tall figure looked
slimmer and taller than ever, and he took a minute or two to gaze
into the gloom before answering.</p>

<p>"We go back yonder," he said, pointing in the direction of the
mountains which form the southeastern boundary of the valley of
Wyoming. "We go yonder&mdash;stay there&mdash;find way to go to Wilkesbarre."</p>

<p>The whites correctly interpreted this as meaning that he believed
it prudent, in view of the fact that the direct approach to the
place was so closely watched, to use some strategy to secure an
entrance, the point in his mind being merely to beat the Iroquois,
without considering the means by which it was done. In the range
of mountains stretching to the southeast of the valley, where
the Mohawk had taken Rosa many a time on a hunt, were numerous
places offering secure hiding for the fugitives from the hunt
of the enemies. It was the intention of Lena-Wingo to conduct
his friends to that neighborhood, as he explained further, and
then look over and watch the ground so carefully that he could
commit no mistake when he did make his move. So soon as he should
see the way clear, he would take Rosa to the shelter before the
Tories and Indians could learn what he was trying to do.</p>

<p>Lena-Wingo spoke with so much quiet confidence that his listeners
could not but feel something of the same spirit. As for Rosa,
she favored his plan, and so expressed herself. The Indian had
made his resolve before that, but he was as firm as the rock of
Gibraltar, reinforced by her endorsement.</p>
