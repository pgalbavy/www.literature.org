<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was nearly ten o'clock; a freezing rain still swept the black
Boston streets, with now and again a volley of hail, rattling
on closed shutters and swinging shop-signs.</p>

<p>In the dark mews behind the "Wild Goose Tavern" had gathered
a shadowy company of horsemen, unfortunate patriots who had not
been quick enough to leave the city before the troops shut its
landward gates.</p>

<p>Caught by the Governor's malignant move, separated from their
companies of Minute Men, these half-score gentlemen had met at
the "Wild Goose" to consult how best they might leave the city
and join their comrades at Lexington and Concord.</p>

<p>Some were for riding to the Neck and making a dash across the
causeway; some wanted boats, among the latter, Jack Mount, who
naturally desired to rid the town of his person as speedily as
might be.</p>

<p>"There's a hempen neck-cloth to fit my pipes in Queen Street,"
he said, plaintively, "and I desire it not, having no mind for
flummery. Let us find a flat-boat, in God's name, and get us to
Charlestown with our horses while the rain endures."</p>

<p>"Ay," replied an officer of Roxbury Minute Men, "but what if
our horses neigh in mid-stream?"</p>

<p>"The <em>Somerset</em> ran out her deck-guns at sunset," added
another. "What if she turned her swivel on us?"</p>

<p>"And how if they swept us off the causeway with a chain-shot?"
asked Mount.</p>

<p>"What think you, Mr. Cardigan?" demanded an officer of Sudbury
militia, leaning forward in his wet saddle to pat the dripping
neck of his roan.</p>

<p>"I only know that I shall ride this night to Lexington," I said,
impatiently, "and I am at your service, gentlemen, by land or
sea. Pray you, decide quickly while the rain favours us."</p>

<p>"Is there a man among us dare demand a pass of the Governor?"
asked the Sudbury officer, abruptly. "By Heaven, gentlemen, it
is death by land or by sea if we make to force the lines this
night!"</p>

<p>"And it is death to me if I stay here cackling," muttered Mount,
as we caught the distant gallop of dragoons through stony Wiltshire
Street.</p>

<p>We sat moodily in our saddles, huddled together in the darkness
and rain, listening to the sound of the horses' feet on the pavement.</p>

<p>"I'd give a thousand guineas if I were on the Charlestown shore
with Revere," muttered an officer.</p>

<p>"The Governor might sell you a pass for ten," observed another,
sneeringly. "It will cost him a penny to keep his pretty bird
o' paradise in plumes."</p>

<p>"If John Hancock were here he would get us a pass from Mrs. Hamilton,"
remarked the Sudbury officer.</p>

<p>There was a silence, then one or two men laughed.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Hamilton at Province House?" I asked, not understanding
the careless handling of her name among these gentlemen.</p>

<p>Again came laughter.</p>

<p>"It is easy to see that you have been in prison," observed the
Sudbury officer. "Mrs. Hamilton rules at Province House, and leads
Tommy Gage by the nose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By the <em>left hand</em>," interrupted another, maliciously.</p>

<p>"You mean that Mrs. Hamilton is&mdash;is&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"Town scandal," said the officer.</p>

<p>"It may be a lie," observed a young man mounted on a powerful
gray.</p>

<p>"It is a lie," I said, with an ugly emphasis.</p>

<p>"Is that remark addressed to me, sir?" demanded the Sudbury officer,
sharply.</p>

<p>"And to company, also," I replied.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen!" cried the Roxbury officer, "are we to have quarrels
among us at such a time?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said I, "if you or your company affront me. Tattle
is dirty work for a gentleman's tongue, and the sooner that tongue
is stopped with honest mud the better."</p>

<p>"I've called a gentleman out for less than that," said an old
officer, dryly.</p>

<p>"I am at your service," I replied, disgusted.</p>

<p>"And I'm with you, lad," said Mount, walking up to my stirrup.
"I have no stomach for those who wink at a woman's name."</p>

<p>"I also," said the young man on the gray, gravely.</p>

<p>A constrained silence followed, broken by the Sudbury officer.</p>

<p>"Hats off to the beautiful Mrs. Hamilton, gentlemen! Cardigan
is right, by God! If we stand not for our women, who will?"</p>

<p>And he stretched out his hand in the rain. I took it; others
offered me their hands.</p>

<p>"I ride to Province House," I said, briefly. "Jack, fetch a cloak
to hide your buckskins and wait me here. Gentlemen, I wish you
fortune in your journey."</p>

<p>As I rode out into Cambridge Street, thunder boomed in the east,
and I saw the forked lightning racing through inky heavens, veining
the storm with jewelled signs.</p>

<p>"God writes on heaven's wall!" I said, aloud.</p>

<p>A strange exultation stirred me; the dark world lay free and
wide before me, and I would ride it, now, from end to end, till
Silver Heels was mine and Butler's soul had dropped back into
that pit from whence it had crawled to hide within his demon's
body.</p>

<p>In Hillier's Lane I put Warlock to a gallop, but drew bridle
in muddy Sudbury Street, where, from the darkness, a strident
voice called on me to halt.</p>

<p>"Who comes there?" repeated the voice. I heard the trample of
horsemen and the clink of sabres striking stirrups.</p>

<p>"Coureur-de-bois for Province House!" I answered, calmly. A chafing
temper began to heat my blood; I gathered my bridle and dropped
one hand on my hatchet.</p>

<p>"On whose affairs ride you?" demanded the spectral dragoon, laying
his horse broadside across mine.</p>

<p>"On my own affairs!" I cried, angrily; "pull out there!&mdash;do you
hear me, fellow?"</p>

<p>A lanthorn was lifted to my face.</p>

<p>"Let the forest wild-cat go," muttered an officer, riding back
to the picket as I crowded my horse against the dragoon who had
hailed me.</p>

<p>Without giving them a glance I pushed through the cluster of
horsemen, and heard them cursing my insolence as I wheeled into
School Street and cantered along Governor's Alley.</p>

<p>There were torches lighted in the mews; an hostler took Warlock;
I swung out of the saddle and stepped back to a shelter from the
storm.</p>

<p>Through the rain, up Marlborough Street, down School Street,
and along Cornhill, drove the coaches and carriages of the Tory
quality, all stopping at the brilliantly lighted mansion, where,
as an hostler informed me, the Governor was giving a play and
a supper to the wealthy Tory families of Boston and to all the
officers of the British regiments quartered in the city. I knew
the latter statement was false.</p>

<p>I stood for a while in the rain among the throng of poor who
had come to wait there, in patience, on the chance of a scrap
from the servants' quarters after the servants had picked the
bones their surfeited masters would scarcely deign to lick.</p>

<p>At first, as the coaches dashed up and the chairs jogged into
the gateway, a few squalid watchers in the crowd fought to open
the carriage-doors, hoping for a coin flung to them for their
pains; but the sentinels soon put a finish to this, driving the
ragged rabble savagely, with thrusts of their musket-butts, out
into Marlborough Street. Under the gate-lanthorn's smeared reflections
I saw the poor things huddled in a half-circle, pinched and chattering
and white with hunger, soaked to the bone with the icy rain, yet
lingering, God knows why, for a brief glimpse of My Lady in pink
silk and powder, picking her way from her carriage across the
puddles, while My Lord minced at her side and the footman ran
behind to cover them both with a glistening umbrella.</p>

<p>The stony street echoed with the clatter of shod horses, the
rattle of wheels, the shouts of footmen, and the bawling of chair-bearers.</p>

<p>Once, when the wind sharpened, shifted, and blew the slanting
rain from the north, a warm odour of roasted butcher's meats came
to us, and I could hear a hollow sound rising from the throng,
which was like a groan.</p>

<p>In the Province House fiddlers were fiddling; it was chill enough
in the street, but it was doubtless over-hot within, for servants
came and threw open the windows and we could hear the fiddles
plainly and the sweet confusion of voices and a young girl's laughter.</p>

<p>A hoarse cry broke out, wrung from the very vitals of the wretches
around me.</p>

<p>"Silence!" shouted the officer of the gate-guard, striding out
in his long rain-cloak and glaring about him, with tasselled stick
upraised. The rain powdered his gilded French hat and laced vest,
and he stepped back hastily under shelter.</p>

<p>There was perfect quiet for an instant, then a movement near
me, a mutter, a quick surging of people, a cry: "Give room! Back
there! Bear him up!"</p>

<p>A voice broke out, "He is starving; the smell o' meat sickens
him!"</p>

<p>Two men staggered past, supporting a mere lad, whose deathly
face hung on his rain-soaked cotton shirt.</p>

<p>"He has the spotted sickness!" muttered a chair-bearer near me;
"it's death to take his breath! Let me pass!"</p>

<p>"The pest!" cried another, shrinking back, and stumbling away
in a panic.</p>

<p>The officer watched the scene for a moment, then his heavy, inflamed
face darkened.</p>

<p>"Back there! Be off, I say!" he bawled. "Ye stinking beggars,
d'ye mean to poison us all with the pest? Turn out the gate-guard!
Drive those filthy whelps up Cornhill!" he shouted to the corporal
of the guard.</p>

<p>The soldiers came tumbling out of the gate-lodge, but before
they could move on the throng another officer hurried up, and
I heard him sharply recalling the soldiers and rebuking the officer
who had given the order.</p>

<p>"No, no, that will not do," he said. "The town would flame if
you drive the citizens from their own streets. Let them stand
there. What harm are they doing?"</p>

<p>"The lout yonder fell down with the spotted pest," remonstrated
the first officer. "Faugh! The rabble's rotten with scurvy or
some filthy abomination&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They'll harm no one but themselves," replied the other in a
sad voice, which sounded strangely familiar to me, so familiar
that I involuntarily stepped out into the lighted space under
the gate and peered at him through the rain, shielding my eyes
with my hands.</p>

<p>The officer was Mr. Bevan.</p>

<p>Should I speak to him? Should I count on his friendship for me
to get me an audience with the Governor? Here was a chance; he
could vouch for me; so could Mrs. Hamilton.</p>

<p>As I hesitated somebody beside me clutched my elbow, and I swung
around instantly, one hand on my hunting-knife.</p>

<p>The next moment Saul Shemuel almost rolled at my feet in an ecstasy
of humble delight, sniffling, writhing, breathing hard, and clawing
at my sleeve in his transports at sight of me.</p>

<p>I seized his arm, drew him along the wall, and into the dusky
mews.</p>

<p>Impatient, yet touched, I suffered his mauling, demanding what
news he might have, and he, beside himself with joy and excitement,
could scarce find breath to pant out the news which concerned
me. "I haf seen Foxcroft," he gasped. "Mr. Foxcroft he hass come
to-day on dot <em>Pomona</em> frigate to Scarlet's Wharf, twelve
weeks from Queenstown, sir. It wass printed in dot <em>Efening
Gazette</em>, all apout Foxcroft how he iss come from Sir Peter
Warren to make some troubles for Sir John Johnson mit dot money
he took from Miss Warren, sir!"</p>

<p>"Foxcroft! Here?" I stammered.</p>

<p>"Yess, sir; I ran mit my legs to Queen Street, und I told him
how you wass in dot prison come, und he run mit his legs to Province
House, but too late, for we hear dot bell ring und dose guns shooting.
Und I said, 'Gott of Isaac, I bet you Jack Mount he hass run avay!'
Und Mr. Foxcroft he sees some dragoon soldiers come into Cornhill,
calling out: 'Dose highwaymens is gone! Vatch 'em by dot Mall!'
So Mr. Foxcroft he comes to Province House mit me, sir, und he
iss gone in to make some troubles mit Governor Gage apout Sir
John Johnson und dot money of Miss Warren! Ach, here iss Mr. Foxcroft,
now, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>I turned to confront a stout, florid gentleman, swathed in a
riding-cloak, whose little, angry eyes snapped as he cried: "Governor
Gage is a meddling ass! I care not who listens to me, and, I repeat,
he is a meddlesome ass! Sir Peter Warren shall hear of this, damme!
Am I a free agent, damme? I take it that I am a free agent, yet
I may not leave this town to-night for lack of a pass. But I'll
go! They shall not stop me! No, damme if they shall!"</p>

<p>The hostlers were all staring at him; I stepped towards him,
eagerly, but the peppery and inflamed barrister waved me off.</p>

<p>"Damme, sir!" he bawled; "who the devil are you, sir? Take your
hands from me, sir! I wish to go to my client in Lexington, and
this Tory peacock will give me no pass! I will not suffer this
outrage; I will appeal to&mdash;"</p>

<p>I gave him a jerk that shook the breath from his body, whispering
in his ear: "Be silent, in Heaven's name, sir! I am Michael Cardigan!"</p>

<p>At first, in his passion, astonishment, and incredulity, he found
no voice to answer me; but as Shemuel eagerly vouched for me,
Mr. Foxcroft's fury and suspicion subsided.</p>

<p>"You? Cardigan?" he repeated. "Well, where the devil have you
been, sir, and what the devil have you been about, sir? Eh? Answer
me that, now!"</p>

<p>"I've been in prison, under sentence of death," I replied. "Where
have <em>you</em> been, sir, to leave your client, Miss Warren,
at the mercy of Walter Butler?"</p>

<p>At that he took fire, and, with trembling fist quivering towards
heaven, he justified his absence in warm terms.</p>

<p>"I've been in England, sir, that's where I've been!" he cried.
"I've been there to find out why your blackguard of a kinsman,
Sir John Johnson, should rob my client of her property. And I've
found out that your blackguard Sir John has not only robbed her
of her means, but of the very name she has a right to! That's
what I've done, sir. And if it does not please you, you may go
to the devil!"</p>

<p>His impudence and oaths I scarcely noted, such a fierce happiness
was surging through me to the very bones. I could have hugged
the choleric barrister as he stood there, affronting me at every
breath; I fairly beamed upon him when he bade me go to the devil,
and, to his amazement, I seized his fat hands and thanked him
so gratefully that the defiance died on his lips and he stared
at me open-mouthed.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, my dear, dear friend," I cried, "I will get you
your pass to clear the Neck to-night, and we will go together
to find my cousin, Miss Warren. Wait me here, sir; I will leave
Boston this night or my name is not Cardigan!"</p>

<p>Then bidding Shemuel keep an eye on Warlock, I hurried around
to the gate-house, where the rabble still slunk, watching the
lighted windows with famished eyes.</p>

<p>The clouds in mid-heaven had caked into snowy jets of fleece,
and now the full moon of April flooded the soaked pavements with
pools of silver.</p>

<p>The sentry halted me as I entered the court-yard, but when I
asked for Mr. Bevan, he called to a comrade to take my message.
The next moment Bevan stepped out into the moonlight.</p>

<p>"What is it, my man? Can I serve you?" he said, pleasantly, peering
at me.</p>

<p>"Do you not know me, Mr. Bevan?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Cardigan!" he stammered, "is that you, Cardigan&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was close to me at a stride, both hands on my shoulders, his
kindly, troubled eyes full of wonder and pity. Perhaps I appeared
to him somewhat haggard and careworn, and then the rain had chilled
and pinched me.</p>

<p>"I am not in want," I said, trying to smile.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but why are you not among the guests at Province House?"
he asked, quickly. "The son of Captain Cardigan needs no friend
at court, I fancy."</p>

<p>He linked his gilded sleeve in my arm and drew me past the guard-house,
and ere I could protest, I found myself inside the cloak-room
among a company of old beaux and young fops, all in the hands
of footmen and body-servants who were busily dusting the hair-powder
from silken shoulders, smoothing out laces, hanging hats and cloaks
to dry, and polishing sword-hilts for their languid, insolent-eyed
masters.</p>

<p>"Can we not find a quiet corner hereabouts?" I asked. "I came
to demand a pass for Lexington. Will you use your privilege with
the Governor, Bevan?"</p>

<p>"A pass!" he exclaimed, stopping short in his tracks.</p>

<p>"To Lexington," I repeated.</p>

<p>"To-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He raised his honest, perplexed eyes to me.</p>

<p>"I must have a pass; it concerns the welfare of Miss Warren,"
I began, then hesitated, remembering that I was also to take Jack
Mount in my company, whose business in Lexington was very different
from mine.</p>

<p>"Cardigan," he said, with troubled eyes on me, "I cannot lend
myself to such a service, even for Miss Warren's sake, unless
you first give me your word of honour that your journey concerns
only Miss Warren's welfare."</p>

<p>My heart sank; I could not betray the comrade who counted on
me. Jack Mount must get free o' Boston as well as I. But how could
I lie to Bevan or requite his courtesy with treachery? Yet honour
forbade me to leave Jack Mount, even for Silver Heels's sake.</p>

<p>"Pass or no pass, I go this night," I said, sullenly.</p>

<p>"Hush!" he said; "don't talk here."</p>

<p>He led me through the card-rooms, where a score of old bucks
and purple-necked officers sat, all playing picquet in owlish
silence, then through a partition, where a fountain sprayed beds
of tall ferns, out into a lamp-illumined circular alcove, hung
with China silks, and bowered deep in flowers and tiny, blossoming
trees no higher than one's knee-buckle.</p>

<p>"The Chinese alcove," he observed. "Nobody will disturb us here,
I fancy. You have heard of the Chinese alcove, Cardigan? There
is the door to the famous golden gallery."</p>

<p>I glanced at the gilded door in the corner, half-hidden by Chinese
drapery. I had heard that the Governor's sweetheart dwelt here.</p>

<p>Bevan reached up and pulled a velvet cord. Presently a servant
brought us a silver bowl of steaming punch made with tea and fruit
in the Regent's fashion.</p>

<p>"I drink no tea," I said, shortly.</p>

<p>"I suppose not," observed Bevan, laughing, and commanded the
servant to fetch me a bowl without tea.</p>

<p>"Your courtesy to a rebel is extraordinary," I said, after an
interval.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm half rebel myself," he laughed. "I'd be in my shirt-sleeves
out Middlesex way, drilling yokels &mdash;Minute Men, I believe&mdash;were
it not that&mdash;that&mdash;oh, well, I'll wear the red jacket as long
as I live and let the future weed out the goats from the sheep."</p>

<p>"It's different with you," I said. "You are English bred."</p>

<p>"Ay, and the red o' the uniform has dyed my flesh to the bone,"
he replied.</p>

<p>"You mean that you will fight&mdash;us?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Tooth and nail, my dear fellow," he said, gayly; "foot, horse,
and dragoons! But what can I do to serve you&mdash;first?"</p>

<p>I tasted a glass of punch, then set it down impatiently. "I tell
you I must ride to Lexington," I said, firmly, "and I mean to
take friends if I choose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me no more, Cardigan," he broke in, "else I must refuse
you what little service I may render. You know as well as I why
the gates on the Neck are closed to-night. If you do not know,
listen to me. The rebels have been storing war materials. Last
October we gave their spokesmen full warning that we could no
longer tolerate the collecting of arms and ammunition. We sent
expeditions into the country to destroy what stores they had gathered."</p>

<p>He hesitated; a perplexed smile passed over his face. "You know
perfectly well," he said, "that we have good reasons for closing
the city gates to-night. I cannot give you a pass. Yet, for Miss
Warren's sake"&mdash;he lifted his hat as he spoke&mdash;"I have done what
I could in honour. Now I must leave you."</p>

<p>"What have you done?" I asked, angrily.</p>

<p>"I have conducted you to the Chinese alcove, my friend."</p>

<p>"The ante-chamber of the Governor's mistress," I retorted. "Am
I to find my pass here among these flowers and blossoms?"</p>

<p>He looked down at the glasses on the table beside us, stirred
the contents of his own, and nodded.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I demanded, hotly.</p>

<p>"I mean, Cardigan, that, except the Governor, there is only one
person to-night in Boston who can secure you a pass for Lexington.
If she chooses to do so, it is not my affair."</p>

<p>"If <em>who</em> chooses to do so?"</p>

<p>"She."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Wait and&mdash;ask her," he said, gravely.</p>

<p>He was gone, wading waist-deep in flowers, ere I could compose
my mind to think or protest, leaving me speechless; standing by
the table.</p>

<p>A minute passed; through the thickets of sweet-smelling blossoms
the candles flamed like those slender witch-lights that dance
over nature's gardens, where bergamot and cardinal robe our dim
woods in crimson glory under the October stars.</p>

<p>"What does he mean by leaving me here?" I muttered, pacing to
and fro through the fragrant, flowering lane. Then, as I stood
still, listening, far away I heard a glass door close with a crystalline
clash; there came the rustle of brocade sweeping like a breeze
along the passage; the door of the golden gallery swung outward;
a figure all silk and lace stood poised on the step above me,
screened to the knees behind the flowers.</p>

<p>"Where is the forest-runner who desires a pass to Lexington?"
she began; then, perceiving my lank, dark form against the candle-light,
she laughed a sweet, contented little laugh and bade me approach.</p>

<p>I saw that exquisite, indolent head bending towards me, the smiling
eyes seeking my features, the jewels ablaze at her throat.</p>

<p>"Marie Hamilton!" I stammered.</p>

<p>All her neck and face flamed, then whitened to the hue of death
as she stepped swiftly towards me, her brocade sweeping through
the flowers with a sound like the wind tearing silken petals.
Suddenly she stood still, clearing her startled eyes with one
jewelled hand; her knees fell a-trembling; she swayed and caught
at the stiff, golden curtains, half tearing them from the wall.</p>

<p>Into a carved chair, all glittering with dragon's wings, she
fell, a crumpled heap of lace and jewels, and buried her face
in her hands, pressing her fingers into the plump skin.</p>

<p>I watched her miserably; she twisted her white hands before her
face; her quivering mouth, her delicate body bent and writhing,
all these told me what no words could tell, and her agonized silence
shouted her shame to the midnight skies of heaven.</p>

<p>In the hush that followed, the door of the golden gallery swung
idly back and forth with a deadened, muffled beat like the noise
of great wings flapping.</p>

<p>"Michael," she said, at last.</p>

<p>"Yes," I whispered, in hopeless grief.</p>

<p>Presently she sat up, wearily, one hand on her pale, smooth brow.
I could not meet her eyes; I bent my head.</p>

<p>"Oh, God, what punishment is mine!" she sobbed.</p>

<p>She dropped her hands, clasped them, and looked wildly at me
through her tears.</p>

<p>"If I am what I am, it was because I had lost you," she said.
"I had eaten my heart out&mdash;you never came&mdash;I never thought you
cared &mdash;I never thought you cared!" she wailed, twisting
her interlocked fingers in helpless agony. "I had loved you so
long; I tried to make you understand it, but you would not. I
was mortally hurt &mdash;I said bitter things&mdash;but my heart was
yours, Michael, yours for the asking, and so was I; you had only
to take me; I would have gone with you from the first word you
spoke to me in Johnson Hall &mdash;I would have followed you&mdash;from
the first glance you gave me. Wrong? What is wrong? Love? It is
<em>never</em> wrong! I would have died for a touch of your lips;
I did almost die when you kissed me there, using me so shamelessly
with your boyish cruelty! You went away in the night; I searched
Johnstown, and I listened and questioned until I believed you
had gone to Pittsburg. And I followed you, madly jealous of Felicity,
crazed at the thought that she, too, was going to Pitt to be near
you. But you were not at Fort Pitt; I waited, and I was calm because
I believed that Felicity meant to wed with Dunmore. Then Harrod
sent in his list of killed&mdash;my husband was among the dead. I went
back to Albany. I meant to come to Boston to sell my house: I
needed money. You found me there on the road that night; I could
have died from happiness, but you would not understand me, Michael!"
she ended, piteously.</p>

<p>I kept my eyes on the floor.</p>

<p>"And now, since you have been in Boston, all these long months,"
she cried, "I have not seen you; I could not find you, nor could
I find anybody who had ever seen you. God knows I did not think
to see you here since I, destitute, utterly desperate, caring
nothing for life, took&mdash;this&mdash;shameful&mdash;step&mdash;"</p>

<p>She covered her hot face with her hands.</p>

<p>"Can you believe I love you still?" she sobbed.</p>

<p>I could endure no more; already I had stumbled through the flowery
hedge towards the door, blindly forcing a path amid the blossoms
which threw out a hundred tendrils to bar my way.</p>

<p>Once I looked back. She lay in the glittering chair, eyes following
me. The next step, and a great bunch of roses blotted her face
from my sight.</p>

<p>Through the card-room I hurried, aware of people around me, yet
seeing nothing; down the stairway, jostled by people who were
descending or mounting, and at last into the cloak-room and out
through the court-yard, which was now bright with moonlight shining
in the puddles of rain.</p>

<p>Shemuel came from the mews to meet me, leading Warlock. Mr. Foxcroft
stalked behind him.</p>

<p>"Where is the pass?" he demanded. "Did you procure the pass,
sir? What! Empty-handed! Now, by Heaven!" he cried, in a towering
fury, "this Tory Governor presumes too far!"</p>

<p>"Be silent!" I said, sharply; "do you wish to have us all arrested?
I shall go to Lexington to-night, I tell you, pass or no pass;
and, before I go, you shall tell me where I may find Miss Warren."</p>

<p>"A mile out of Lexington on the Bedford Road," he replied. "How
can you pass the Neck guard, without the Governor's leave, sir?"</p>

<p>"I will show you," said I, "if you choose to accompany me."</p>

<p>"You mean to ride for it?" he asked, excitedly.</p>

<p>I was silent.</p>

<p>"And risk a chain-shot from their twenty-four-pounders?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"Mr. Foxcroft," I said, "you may do as you please, but there
is nothing under the moon, yonder, which can keep me from going
to Lexington. Have you a horse stabled here? No? Can you hire
one? Then hire him, in Heaven's name, and get into your saddle
if you mean to go with me. Shemuel, find a good horse for Mr.
Foxcroft, and another for Jack Mount. You must pay for them; I
have no money. It is half-past ten o'clock; I will wait ten minutes."</p>

<p>Shemuel scurried back into the mews; Foxcroft followed, and in
a moment his portly figure was lost to sight in the dusky alley.</p>

<p>I looked up at the lighted windows of Province House, wondering
how on earth I was to go to Lexington. Music was sounding from
the ballroom; I looked out across the dark city; the moon hung
over the bay; the rigging of a war-ship rose black against the
silvery disk. Instinctively I turned my eyes towards the steeple
of the Old North Meeting-House. The steeple was dark; the troops
had not yet started.</p>

<p>Musing there in the moonlight, hands clasped on the pommel of
my saddle, the dull thunder of hoofs from the stable aroused me,
and presently Mr. Foxcroft came clattering out of the mews, followed
by Shemuel, also mounted, a grotesque lump of a shape, crouched
on the saddle, his flat, three-cornered hat crammed over his great
ears, his nose buried in his neck-cloth. He led a third horse
behind him.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," panted Foxcroft, "I am prepared to ride to the devil
with you and put this Tory Governor's nose out o' joint!"</p>

<p>"Do you also ride with us, Shemuel?" I asked.</p>

<p>He replied faintly in the affirmative. The little creature was
frightened. His devotion touched me very deeply.</p>

<p>Walking our horses along Common Street, we were almost immediately
accosted by dragoons, who, on learning that our destination was
the "Wild Goose Tavern," cursed us roundly, promising to clean
out that nest of rebels at no distant date. Their officer also
began to harangue us, but I pushed my horse past him and cantered
on into the Mall and out through Green Lane, wheeling into the
alley behind the "Wild Goose."</p>

<p>Of the half-score gentlemen whom I had left there, sitting their
rain-drenched horses, none remained. However, Mount was in the
tavern, and he came at my whistle, explaining that the balance
of the company had chosen to risk crossing the bay under the guns
of the <em>Somerset</em>, rather than attempt to force the Neck.</p>

<p>"God go with them!" said I; "here's Shemuel with a horse for
you. We'll ride to the shore and see what can be done."</p>

<p>Mount, who had been busily embracing Shemuel, gave the little
Jew a mighty slap of affection, vaulted into his saddle, passed
my rifle to me, and fell back beside the peddler, while Mr. Foxcroft
and I rode through the Mall once more, down towards the shore,
where, in the darkness, faint flashes through the trees came and
went as the waves of the bay caught the moonlight.</p>

<p>"Is it too far to swim?" I asked Mr. Foxcroft.</p>

<p>"Too far," he replied, with a shiver. "All is marsh beyond; the
mud would smother us ere we landed. That shoal yonder is dry at
low-water."</p>

<p>"Mr. Foxcroft," said I, "we must swim for it somewhere. Could
we not make the Charles River at a pinch?"</p>

<p>"No, nor Stony Brook," he said. "A good swimmer might circle
the floating battery and make his way outside the Neck, but he
could not last, Mr. Cardigan."</p>

<p>We had been slowly approaching the shore while we spoke. For
some time I had fancied I heard sounds in the darkness like the
stirring and movement of a body of men assembling. At first I
fancied the swelling murmur of the tide deceived me, yet at moments
it seemed as though I could distinguish a trampling sound which
could not have been the beat of the ocean's steady squadrons on
the beach.</p>

<p>Then, as we came out through the fringe of trees from which the
land fell away to the water's edge, a stirring sight lay spread
before us: below, in the dazzling moonlight, the shore swarmed
with soldiers, teamsters, and boatmen, moving hither and thither
along the water's edge. Companies of grenadiers were marching
towards the wooden wharf at the end of Hollis Street; companies
of light infantry and marines were embarking in the boats which
lay rocking along the shore; horses snorted, gathered in groups,
while boatmen poled flat-boats towards a cove from which already
a scow, freighted with horses, was being pushed out into the bay.</p>

<p>Although there was no talking, save the half-whispered commands
of the officers, the movement of so many boats, the tread of a
thousand men, the stamping and noises of horses, all swelled into
a heavy, ceaseless sound, which mingled with and intensified the
murmur of the mounting tide, stirred to its flood by the silver
magic of the rising moon.</p>

<p>Hundreds of soldiers had already embarked; we could distinguish
the dark line of their boats, all strung out as though fastened
together, stem and stern, rising and falling on the glittering
surface of the bay, ever lengthening, as new boats, loaded deep
with soldiers, put out to fall into line and sail bobbing away
into the darkness, only to reappear again under the flood of moonlight.</p>

<p>"Suppose," whispered Mount, "we lead our horses aboard that scow
yonder!"</p>

<p>In another moment, scarcely aware of what I was actually about,
I had dismounted, and was leading Warlock straight down to the
shore towards a cove, where half a dozen boatmen were standing
in a scow, resting on their long sea-poles.</p>

<p>"If they ask questions, knock them into the water!" said Mount,
calmly.</p>

<p>He repeated the instructions to Foxcroft and Shemuel as we filed
along the dim shore past a throng of boatmen, grooms, officers'
servants, and teamsters, and made straight towards the scow that
lay a few yards off shore in the little, shadowy cove.</p>

<p>It was a desperate attempt; had I given myself one minute's reflection,
I should rather have risked a dash across the Neck and a chain-shot
on the causeway. Yet its very audacity was in our favour; the
boatmen, when they saw us leading our horses down to their cove,
hastily lowered a plank bridge from their heavy scow, and Mount
coolly waded out into the water, guiding his horse aboard as calmly
as though it were his own stable, and these Tory boatmen his paid
grooms.</p>

<p>I followed with Warlock, who snorted and pawed when the salt
water rose to his fetlocks, but he danced up the plank incline
and entered the boat without coaxing. Shemuel's horse, a sleek,
weasel-bellied animal, with a wicked eye and a bunch o' hackle
for a tail, swung round in the water, slinging the little Jew
on his face in the mud, and then, with a vicious squeal, flung
up his heels and cantered off, scattering a company of marines
drawn up a hundred yards down the shore.</p>

<p>Draggled and dripping, Shemuel, standing knee-deep in salt water,
watched the flight of his horse, but I bade him come aboard at
once, and he did so, casting sidelong glances at the boatmen,
who regarded him with astonishment.</p>

<p>Mr. Foxcroft, meanwhile, had dragged his horse aboard, and Mount
ordered the boatmen to push off at once.</p>

<p>As the men took up their heavy sea-poles, I heard them whispering
to each other that Mount and I must be scouts sent ahead to spy
for the soldiers, and I caught them eying our buckskins curiously
as they lay on their poles, pushing out towards the broad belt
of moonlight which glistened beyond.</p>

<p>The wind whipped our cheeks as we swung clear of the land; the
boatmen presently took to their oars, which I noticed were muffled
midway between blade and handle. The row-locks, also, had been
padded with bunches of wheat-straw and rags.</p>

<p>Now that we were safely afloat, misgivings seized me. I had never
before been on salt water; the black waves which came slapping
on our craft disturbed me; the shadowy hulk of the war-ship which
lay athwart our course loomed up like doom, seeming to watch us
with its wicked little green and red eyes, marking us for destruction.</p>

<p>The wind freshened furiously in my face; the waves came rolling
in out of the darkness, rap! rap! slap! rap! crushing into stinging
gusts of spray, soaking us to the skin.</p>

<p>Far to our left the line of boats floated, undulating across
the bay; the beacon in Boston flared out red as we rounded Fox
Hill; the light on Mount Wh-d-m twinkled.</p>

<p>Presently Mount touched my arm and pointed. High up in the dark
haze above the city two bright lights hung. So we knew that Rolfe
was watching from the belfry of the Old North Meeting-House, and
that Paul had read the twin lamps' message and was now galloping
west through the Middlesex farms.</p>

<p>Shemuel, shivering in his wet and muddy garments, crept up beside
me to ask where we were to be landed.</p>

<p>I did not know, nor dared I ask, fearing to awake suspicion.
Besides, we were close under the sprit of a tall, black frigate,
so close that I could see the candles flaring in the battle lanthorns
and the dead bay-weeds hanging from the chains, and I could even
read her name, the <em>Falcon</em>.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, out of the shadow under the black frigate's hulk,
a cockle-shell came dancing towards us, with an officer in the
stern, who played his lanthorn on us and waved his arm.</p>

<p>"Move into line with the ship's boats!" he called out, with many
a strange sea-oath; and our brawny oarsmen pulled northeast once
more towards the long line of boats which now stretched almost
across the bay.</p>

<p>"You land at Phipps's Farm, sir?" inquired a sweating boatman
of Mount.</p>

<p>"Phipps's Farm!" broke in Mr. Foxcroft. "It's in the marshes
o' Lechemere! I'm damned if I'll be landed at Phipps's!"</p>

<p>"Isn't that where the troops land, sir?" asked the boatman, resting
his oar.</p>

<p>Mount shook his head mysteriously.</p>

<p>"We are on special service, lads," he said. "Ask no questions,
but put us ashore at Willis Creek, and tell the colonel to give
you a guinea apiece for me."</p>

<p>At this impudent remark the boatmen began to row with renewed
vigour; the salt spray drove aboard in showers, the wind roared
in our ears, the horses huddled together.</p>

<p>Once more we swung across the line of boats; in the craft just
ahead of us I could see the marines sitting with their muskets
on their knees, right hands covering the flints and pans.</p>

<p>As the distance slowly increased between us and the troop-boats,
I began to breathe more freely. Mount stood by his horse, coolly
chewing a straw from the wadded oar-locks, his fox-skin cap pushed
back on his head, the fluffy tail blowing wildly in the wind.</p>

<p>Slowly the dark shore took shape before us; already I could smell
the land smell, and hear the wind among the reeds.</p>

<p>Oh, the happiness to be free from that prison city, lying there
in the gloom across the water!&mdash;the joy to tread free ground once
more, to scent free winds, to move unrestrained across the world
again!</p>

<p>Mount, too, was sniffing restlessly at the marsh, wreathed in
sea-mist; I fancied his eyes glowed in the moonlight like the
eyes of a waiting hound.</p>

<p>Something touched my hand; Shemuel came cowering to my side.</p>

<p>"Courage," I whispered.</p>

<p>"I haf done all I could," he said, in a shaking voice.</p>

<p>"I know that, lad," I muttered.</p>

<p>His wet fingers sought mine.</p>

<p>"I shall nefer be safe no more," he whispered.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I shall nefer set foot on shore no more. I don't
live long now, Mr. Cardigan."</p>

<p>He was trembling from head to foot as I laid my hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>The boatmen had dropped their oars and taken to their poles once
more; the tall reeds rustled as our scow drove its square nose
into the shallows and grounded with a grating jar. Startled curlews,
round about us, uttered their querulous cries.</p>

<p>"There's a road swings northwest through the marshes," said Mount,
wading out into the water and leading his horse up through the
rushes. "Follow me, lad. I should know this country from Cobble
Hill to Canada."</p>

<p>Foxcroft had mounted; Jack climbed stiffly into his saddle; I
threw Warlock around in the reeds, prepared to set foot to stirrup,
when Shemuel seized my arm convulsively. A patrol of British light
horse, riding in single file, came picking their way down the
shore in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Mount and Foxcroft saw them and drew bridles; I slung my legs
across Warlock, just as they hailed us.</p>

<p>"Get up behind! Quick!" I whispered to Shemuel, watching the
horsemen riding towards Mount, who was ahead of Foxcroft.</p>

<p>Shemuel's strength appeared to have left his limbs; he struggled
to mount behind me; Warlock, alarmed at his contortions, began
to dance restlessly.</p>

<p>Impatient, I stooped to grasp Shemuel, and I already had him
by the collar when an exclamation and a sudden trampling of horses
made me turn my head just in time to see a British officer seize
Jack Mount and attempt to drag him from his saddle.</p>

<p>Before I could straighten up, the cavalry were upon us; I saw
Foxcroft snap his pistol, wheel, and gallop into the reeds; I
saw Jack Mount fling the officer off and fetch him a cracking
blow with the barrel of his rifle. Two men rode at me; I raised
my rifle with one hand, calling to Shemuel to mount behind me,
but the frightened peddler squirmed out of my clutch and rushed
off headlong into the marsh.</p>

<p>A horseman followed him, cursing; the other trooper, mired in
the rushes, struggled to get at me.</p>

<p>I swung my rifle to my cheek; it flashed in the pan; the brute
set his horse at a gallop, and, leaning forward, deliberately
shot at the unarmed peddler. Shemuel dodged, ran a few yards,
doubled on the horseman, and came rushing back towards Mount.
He gained a little hillock of rising ground; he could have escaped
into the fringing willows, but, to my horror, he turned and waved
his arms to me, shouting:</p>

<p>"Ride! Ride! Mr. Cardigan! For Miss Warren's sake, ride, sir!"</p>

<p>"Touch that man and I'll brain you!" I roared at the horseman
who had now drawn his sabre.</p>

<p>Again I tried to shoot the trooper, but the flint sparks died
out in the damp pan. With a groan I rode after him, calling out
to Shemuel to seek cover in the brush, but he only ran about on
his hillock, dodging the infuriated trooper, and calling frantically
to me that I must save myself for Miss Warren's sake.</p>

<p>Then, while my horse was floundering in the marsh, slowly drawing
his mired limbs to firm ground, I saw Shemuel dart towards me
with a shriek, and, ere I could reach him, I saw the trooper bend
down from his saddle and slash the poor, frightened creature's
head with one terrible blow of his heavy sabre.</p>

<p>Down into the mud plunged Shemuel; the trooper's horse trampled
and passed over his body, then swung in a rushing circle and bore
down on me, just as the other rider came splashing at me from
the right.</p>

<p>My rifle a third time flashed in the pan; the priming had been
wet with spray. I struck Warlock on the flanks, whirled him head
on against Shemuel's murderer, and, whipping out my war-hatchet,
aimed a furious blow at the fellow's head. The keen hatchet blade
sank into the trooper's shoulder; he tumbled out of his stirrups
and landed heavily among the cat-tails.</p>

<p>Instantly I checked Warlock, poised myself in my stirrups, and
launched the hatchet straight at the other horseman, striking
him full in the chest, but whether with blade-edge, handle, or
flat, I know not, for, as his horse swerved wide, passing me at
a tearing gallop, Mount and Foxcroft flew past, calling out that
Shemuel was dead and that I must follow them for my life.</p>

<p>Up the shore we crashed through the rushes, driving straight
out into the marsh, our horses floundering, and the light horsemen
firing their pistols at us from the firmer ground above.</p>

<p>A ball grazed Warlock; his neck was wet with blood.</p>

<p>"They'll murder us all here!" cried Foxcroft; "charge them, in
God's name!"</p>

<p>Mount heard him and bore to the left; I followed; knee to knee
we lifted our crazed horses out of the marsh and hurled them into
the little patrol of light horse, bursting upon them ere they
could wheel to meet us.</p>

<p>In the moonlight their sabres flashed before our eyes, but no
lunging point found its billet of flesh, though their blades rang
out on our rifle-barrels; then we were on them, among them, plunging
through them, and pounding away northward over a hard gravel road.</p>

<p>They discharged their pistols at us; a few of them followed us,
but all pursuit ceased below Prospect Hill; we galloped, unmolested,
into the old Charlestown and West Cambridge Road, and flew onward
through the night.</p>

<p>In lonely stretches of road, which ran rivers of moonlight, I
could see Mount riding, head on his breast, square jaw set, and
I knew he was brooding on Shemuel's dismal end.</p>

<p>The swift murder of the little peddler shocked me terribly; Shemuel's
strange premonition of his own approaching death fairly made me
shiver in my stirrups as I rode. Like a doomed man the Jew had
gone to his end, with what courage God had lent him. He had been
a friend to me. For all his squalid weakness of limb, his natural
fear of pain, his physical cowardice, he had not swerved from
the service of his country, nor had he faltered or betrayed the
confidence of men whose peril imperilled himself. Nothing save
his fidelity to us had forced him to leave the city with us; nothing
save the innate love of liberty in his grotesque and dirty body
had lured this errant child of Israel to risk his life in bearing
messages for those who watched the weighted hours creep on towards
that bloody dawn already gathering under the edges of the sleeping
world.</p>

<p>Now, as we rode, from behind us the sound of bells came quavering
across dim meadows; out of the blue night bells answered; we heard
the reports of guns, the distant clamour of a horn blowing persistently
from some hidden hamlet.</p>

<p>"The alarm!" panted Foxcroft, at my elbow, as we pounded on.
"Hurrah! Hurrah! The country lives!"</p>

<p>"Jack!" I called, through the rushing wind, "the whole land is
awaking behind us! Do you hear? Our country lives!"</p>

<p>"And England dies!" cried Mount, passionately. With both hands
uplifted, and bridle flung across his horse's neck, he galloped
in the lead. On his huge horse, towering up in the saddle, he
swept on through the night, a gigantic incarnation of our people
militant, a colossal shape embodying all that we had striven for
and suffered for from the hour when the first pioneer died at
the stake.</p>

<p>On he swept astride his rushing horse, the fox-tail on his cap
streaming, the thrums on his sleeves blowing like ripe grain;
and ever he tossed his arms towards the sky and shook his glittering
rifle above his head, till the moonshine played on it like lightning.</p>

<p>"Ring! Ring out your bells!" we shouted, as we tore through a
sleeping village; and behind us we could see candle-light break
out from the dark houses, and, ere the volleying echoes of our
horses' hoofs struck the last spark from the village streets,
the meeting-house bell began swinging, warning the distant farms
that the splendid hour had come.</p>

<p>And now, unexpectedly, we encountered a check in our course.
Full in the yellow moonlight, on a little hill over which our
road lay, we caught sight of a body of horsemen drawn up, and
we knew, by the moon shining on their gorgets, that we had before
us a company of dragoons with their officers.</p>

<p>At a word from Jack I dismounted and pulled the rails from the
road fence on our right. Through the aperture we filed, out into
a field of young winter wheat well sprouted, and then west, as
quietly as we might, with watchful eyes on the dragoons.</p>

<p>But the British horsemen had also turned, and were now trotting
along parallel to our course, which manoeuvre drove us off eastward
again across the meadows, deep starred with dandelions. For us
to alarm Lexington was now impossible. We could already see the
liberty-pole on the hill and make out where the village lay, by
a gilt weather-vane shining in the moonlight above the trees.
But there were no lights to be seen in Lexington, and we dared
not ride through the dark town, not knowing but that it might
be swarming with dragoons.</p>

<p>Still, if it were impossible for us to alarm Lexington, we could
ride on across the fields and gain the Bedford Road.</p>

<p>Mr. Foxcroft undertook to pilot us. As I rode by his side I could
scarce believe that, yonder, close at hand in the darkness, Silver
Heels slept, nor doubted that I was near. My heart began a-drumming.</p>

<p>"You are sure she is there?" I asked, plucking Foxcroft's sleeve.</p>

<p>"Unless Captain Butler has prevailed," he said, grimly.</p>

<p>I choked and trembled in my saddle.</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;do you believe she would listen to him?" I muttered.</p>

<p>"Do you?" he asked, turning on me.</p>

<p>We forced our horses through a belt of tasselled willows fringing
a little thread of a meadow stream. The dew showered our faces
like a flurry of rain. My cheeks were burning.</p>

<p>"How far is it? Are we near her house?" I asked again and again.
I strove to realize that I was nearing Silver Heels; I could not,
nor was I able to understand that I should ever again see her.</p>

<p>In moments of my imprisonment I had believed devoutly that I
should live to see her; yet since my deliverance from that cage
of stones I had not dared assure myself that I should find her;
I had not given myself time to think of the chances that might
favour me or of the possibilities of failure. Dormant among my
bitter memories lay that vile threat of Walter Butler; I dared
not stir it up to examine it; I let it lie quiet, afraid to rouse
it. By what hellish art could he, my mortal enemy, inspire aught
but hatred in the woman who had loved me and who must have known
how I had suffered at his hands?</p>

<p>Yet, if he had not lied to me, she had at least given him an
audience. But his boast that she had consented to fix a day to
wed with him I believed not, deeming it but a foolish attempt
at cruelty on a man who, truly enough, at that time, seemed doomed
to die upon the gibbet behind Queen Street court-house.</p>

<p>We now came to a stony pasture in which cattle lay, turning their
heavy heads in the dim light to watch us. I dismounted to let
down the bars. In vain I looked for a house; there were no lights
to be seen.</p>

<p>Foxcroft moved slowly; I nearly rode him down in my rising anxiety,
now almost beyond control.</p>

<p>At length, however, he discovered a narrow, overgrown lane, lined
with hazel, and we turned into it, single file, leading our horses.
The lane conducted us to an orchard, all silvery in the moonbeams,
and now, through the long rows of trees, I saw the moon shining
on the portico of a white mansion.</p>

<p>"Is that the house?" I whispered.</p>

<p>Foxcroft nodded.</p>

<p>We led our horses through a weedy garden up to the pillared portico.
Even in the moonlight I could see the neglect and decay that lay
over house and grounds. In the pale light clusters of yellow jonquils
peeped from the tangle about the doorsteps; an owl left a hemlock
tree with a whistle of broad wings and wheeled upward, squealing
fiercely.</p>

<p>And now, as I leaped to the porch, I became aware of a light
in the house. It streamed from a chink in the wooden shutters
which were closed over the window to the right of the door.</p>

<p>Foxcroft saw it; so did Mount; we tied our hard-blown horses
to the fluted wooden pillars, and, stepping to the door, rapped
heavily.</p>

<p>The hard beating of my heart echoed the rapping; intense silence
followed.</p>

<p>After a long time, pattering, uncertain steps sounded inside
the hallway; a light, dim at first, grew brighter above the fanlight
over the door.</p>

<p>The door opened to its full width; the candle flared in the draught
of night wind, smoked, flickered, then burned steadily. A little,
old man stood in the hallway; his huge shadow wavered beside him
on the wall.</p>

<p>It was the Weasel!</p>

<p>The cuffs of his coat, guiltless of lace, were too large for
his shrunken arms; his faded flowered waistcoat hung on his thin
body like a sack; yet his hair was curled and powdered over his
sunken forehead. On his colourless, wasted face a senile smile
flickered; he laid his withered hand on his breast and bowed to
us, advancing to the threshold.</p>

<p>With a gesture he welcomed us; he did not speak, but stood there
smiling his aged smile, expectant, silent, the pattern of threadbare
courtesy, the living spectre of hospitality.</p>

<p>"Cade!" whispered Mount, with ashy lips; "Cade, old friend! How
came you here?"</p>

<p>The Weasel's meaningless eyes turned on Mount; there was no light
of recognition in them.</p>

<p>"You are welcome, sir," said Renard, in the ghost of his old
voice. "I pray you enter, gentlemen; we keep open house, ah yes!&mdash;an
old custom in our family, gentlemen&mdash;you are welcome to Cambridge
Hall, believe me, most welcome."</p>

<p>The thin, garrulous chatter awoke petulant echoes through the
silent hall; he raised his childish voice and called out the names
of servants, long dead. The hollow house replied in echoes; the
candle-flame burned steadily.</p>

<p>"My servants are doubtless in their hall," he said, without embarrassment;
"that the office of hospitality devolves on me I must count most
fortunate. Pray, gentlemen, follow. The grooms will take your
horses to the stables."</p>

<p>Leading us into a room, where were a few chairs set close to
a small, shabby card-table, he begged us to be seated with a kindly
smile, then seated himself, and fell a-babbling of ancient days,
and of people long since in their graves, of his kennels and stables,
of the days when the world was younger, and hearts simpler, and
true men loved their King.</p>

<p>Nor could we check him, for he would smile and talk of the fleet
in the downs, and the fête to be given in Boston town when Sir
Peter Warren and his old sea-dogs landed to dine at Province House.
And all the while Jack Mount sat staring with tear-smeared eyes,
and lips a-quiver, and great fists clasped convulsively; and Foxcroft
leaned, elbow on knee, keen eyes watching the little madman who
sat serenely babbling of a household and a wife and a life that
existed only in his stricken brain.</p>

<p>His wines he brought us in cracked glasses&mdash;clear water from
a spring that was older than human woe, but, like his hospitality,
unfailing.</p>

<p>At intervals he spoke to empty space, as though servants waited
at his back; and it was the "Blue Room" for Mr. Foxcroft, and
the "South Chamber" for "you, sir, Captain Mount, I believe, of
his Majesty's Grenadiers?" Oh, it was heart-breaking to see the
agony in Mount's eyes and the ghastly by-play of the little, withered
man, the light of whose mind had gone out, leaving a stricken
body to be directed by the spirit of a child.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget that candle-lit scene as I saw it: Mount,
dumb with grief, sitting there in his buckskins, rifle on knee
and fox-skin cap twisted in his great brown hands; Foxcroft, his
black smalls splashed with clay, his heavy, red face set in careworn
lines; and the little, shabby Weasel, in his mended finery, shrunken
fingers interlocked on his knee, smiling vacantly at us over a
cracked glass of spring-water, and dispensing hospitality with
a mild benevolence which was truly ghastly in its unconscious
irony.</p>

<p>"What in God's name is he doing here?" I whispered to Foxcroft.</p>

<p>"Quiet," motioned Foxcroft, turning his head to listen. I, too,
had caught the sound of a light footfall on the stair. Instinctively
we all rose; the Weasel, muttering and smiling, ambled to the
dark entry.</p>

<p>Then, out of the wavering shadows, into the candle-light, stepped
a young girl, whose clear hazel eyes met ours with perfect composure.
Her face was deadly white; her fingers rested in the Weasel's
withered palm; she saluted us with a slow, deep reverence, then
raised her steady eyes to mine.</p>

<p>"Silver Heels! Silver Heels!" I whispered.</p>

<p>Her eyes closed for a moment and she quivered from head to foot.</p>

<p>"My daughter, gentlemen," said the Weasel, tenderly; bending,
he touched her fingers with his shrivelled lips, smiling to himself.</p>

<p>Her gray eyes never left mine; I stepped forward; she gave a
little gasp as I took her hand.</p>

<p>"Who is this young man?" said the Weasel, mildly. "He is not
Captain Butler, dear&mdash;or my memory fails&mdash;ay," he babbled on,
"it fails me strangely now, and I had best sit quiet while younger
heads think for me. Yet, this young man is not Captain Butler,
dear?"</p>

<p>"No, father."</p>

<p>In the silence I heard my heart beat heavily. A minute passed;
the Weasel peered at me with his dim eyes and clasped his daughter's
hand closely.</p>

<p>"Silver Heels! Silver Heels!" I cried, with a sob.</p>

<p>"Do you want me&mdash;now?" she whispered.</p>

<p>I caught her fiercely in my arms; she hung to me with closed
eyes and every limb a-tremble.</p>

<p>And, as I stood there, with my arms around her, and her face
against mine, far away I heard the measured gallop of a horse
on the highway, nearer, nearer, turning now close outside the
house, and now thundering up to the porch.</p>

<p>Instantly Jack Mount glided from the room; Foxcroft, listening,
silently drew his pistol; I reached out for my rifle which leaned
against the chair, and, striking the butt heavily against the
floor, glanced at the pan. The rifle had primed itself.</p>

<p>Then I turned smiling to Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"Do you know who is coming?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>I stepped to the centre of the room; the door opened gently;
a motionless shape stood there in the moonlight, the shape of
my enemy, Walter Butler.</p>
