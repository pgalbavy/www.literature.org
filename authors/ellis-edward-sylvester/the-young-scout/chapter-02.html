<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Buck Kennon smarted so much under the castigation of Mr. Willard
that he had hardly stopped his outcries when he reached home.
In answer to the demands of his startled father, he stated that
a big man, with a cane as large as a telegraph pole, had tried
to kill him and came pretty nigh succeeding.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennon was naturally stirred by the news and set out to investigate.
He was a sensible man, but could not be expected to submit tamely
to such an outrage upon his offspring. He learned, after due inquiry,
that the offending gentleman was Mr. Willard, the newly elected
congressman. Seeking him out, he received the facts from that
person, who expressed the regret that opportunity was denied him
for making his punishment more complete. Mr. Kennon, as I have
said, was a sensible man and told Mr. Willard that he had served
his boy right. In fact, he was so well pleased that he promised
to vote for him if he should run a second time for congress. Then
Mr. Kennon strode homeward, and, as he expressed it, made his
hopeful "dance," for his cowardly behavior.</p>

<p>The occurrence became so generally known that it reached the
ears of Mr. Bryton, the teacher, who instituted a committee of
inquiry of his own, with the result that Buck was call upon to
answer again for his flagrant breach of discipline, so that it
may be said, the mean behavior of the bully received its full
meed of punishment. The teacher talked severely to James Decker,
but felt obliged to add that, after all, he could not blame him
for his chivalrous course.</p>

<p>"It is always manly to defend the helpless, but I don’t like
fighting; it is brutalizing and I’m afraid if you keep on, James,
you will end in being a full back on some football club. Then
all hope will be lost."</p>

<p>Some nights after the exciting incident, Mr. Willard called upon
his old friend, Mr. Decker. As the gentlemen sat by themselves,
smoking their cigars and discussing public questions, the caller
suddenly remarked:</p>

<p>"Decker, do you know you have got a mighty bright boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes; James is a good lad."</p>

<p>"He’s as full of pluck as an egg is of meat. You heard about
his fight with that big bully who tried to impose upon the Goodwin
cripple boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, James told me about it; I was glad you arrived when you
did; for you not only gave the scamp a good castigation, but saved
James from being badly beaten."</p>

<p>"I don’t know about that; I think the bully suffered the most,
even though he was on top when I appeared on the scene. There’s
another fact which gives me pleasure."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Bryton, the teacher, tells me that your son is his brightest
pupil."</p>

<p>"Since he has told me and his mother the same thing, there must
be some truth in the statement. It is a source of gratitude to
me that James does so well."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with him?"</p>

<p>"I have hardly given the matter thought. He is only thirteen
years old, and there’s time enough to think of that. I presume
he will be a lawyer or doctor or minister, though," qualified
the parent. "I’m afraid that he may not take quietly to a calling
of peace."</p>

<p>"There’s no reason why he should not. What I meant to say is
this: if I am elected to serve a second term, I shall have the
appointment of a cadet to West Point; James will be of the right
age; if you desire him to go there, I will make the promise now
to appoint him."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, Mr. Willard; I will talk over the matter
with his mother and with James himself. If they all like it, I
will be glad to avail myself of your kindness."</p>

<p>"Take my advice and accept; I have already had a number of applications,
though the appointment is nearly three years off. I have made
no promises and, understand, that it is yours, if you wish it."</p>

<p>Some days later the gentlemen met again.</p>

<p>"Mr. Willard," said his friend, "James is eager to go to West
Point; his mother held off at first, but has given her consent,
and I favor the scheme very much. So I accept your promise with
thanks."</p>

<p>"We will consider it settled then. Keep the matter a secret until
after the next election, for I shall make any number of enemies
because of the disappointments."</p>

<p>"Mr. Willard, let me make a suggestion to you."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to hear it."</p>

<p>"As you say, you will receive many applications for this appointment,
and if you fail to promise every one before your election comes
around again, each man will be your opponent. It has become quite
fashionable to select the candidates for the Military Academy
by competitive examination. Do so in this case."</p>

<p>"But I wish your son to receive the honor and that may jeopardize
his success."</p>

<p>"If he cannot secure the appointment by a fair contest against
all comers, I don’t wish him to get it. I have been told that
less than one half of those admitted to West Point succeed in
being graduated, and in many cases the vacancies are unfilled
because of the poor material sent by congressmen."</p>

<p>"That I know to be a fact, and you have named the right cause.
A brilliant lad may prove to be physically weak, while one physically
strong is mentally deficient. The government has reason to complain
that so much time, labor and money are wasted because of this
state of things."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that the true means of meeting this objection
is through competitive examinations. The advantage is not only
that the government secures the best qualified young men, but
you will escape a great deal of fault finding. You can let it
be known that, when you have an appointment at your disposal,
that you will decide it by a competitive test. That places all
on the same level, and though some parents will be dissatisfied,
you will receive much less blame. So you see, Mr. Willard, that
it will be a wise procedure, whatever view you take of it."</p>

<p>"I am glad of your suggestion; I think I shall follow it. The
only objection I feel is that possibly your boy may be crowded
aside by some one else."</p>

<p>"I shall not complaint if such proves the fact. He has several
years in which to prepare himself; he possesses a fine physique;
he is anxious for the appointment, and, if all this is not sufficient
to secure it, then it will be certain to go to some one who is
better entitled to the same."</p>

<p>The disastrous consequences of Buck Kennon’s collision with James
Decker had a most salutary effect upon him. He was subdued and
thoughtful, and ceased in a great measure his oppressive course
toward his classmates.</p>

<p>It is probable that this would have been the fact, had not his
father and teacher taken a hand in reforming him. He could not
forget that, though he was able to outwrestle the young champion,
the latter really inflicted the most punishment, and what struck
Buck as strange, young Decker did not show any fear of him. James
was too manly to exult over him, but he gave Buck to understand
that if he acted again as he had toward the crippled Almon, a
second fight was certain. On the whole, Buck decided that it was
wise not to invite another bout at arms.</p>

<p>Mr. Willard followed the suggestion of his friend, Herbert Decker.
He announced, shortly after his second election to Congress, that
the West Point vacancy in his district would be filled by competitive
examination, on a certain date which was named, so that no possible
misunderstanding could follow.</p>

<p>In accordance with the custom, recommended by the authorities,
this date was so arranged that the appointment would occur one
year before the time of the application of the candidate at West
Point. Young Decker, by a little figuring, discovered that, if
he should be the successful contestant, he would attain the required
age just one week before taking his eventful journey up the Hudson,
to learn whether Uncle Sam would pronounce him qualified to become
one of his future generals and leaders of his armies.</p>

<p>And now let us pass over the intervening years to the day fixed
for the test of scholarship and ability. Mr. Bryton had been selected
by Congressman Willard to pass upon the merits of the thirty odd
candidates who presented themselves on the decisive day. The honorable
gentleman himself was present, and expressed his pleasure as he
looked into the faces of the boys, who were mostly alert and fully
alive to the task before them.</p>

<p>To his eye James Decker was the brightest and must promising
of all. Looking down from the platform, he caught his eye and
smiled encouragingly. James was tall, handsome, and manly. His
frame had expanded and hardened a good deal in the intervening
years, for he was one of those boys who possessed a healthy mind
in a healthy body.</p>

<p>He was the captain of the leading baseball club and its best
player. He had become that which his teacher dreaded, full back
on a football eleven, but he never indulged in "slugging," or
received any serious injury. He was a good runner and swimmer,
and, when Buck Kennon looked at him, he thought that he would
as soon tackle a full-grown grizzly bear as engage him in a test
of physical ability. Conditions had greatly changed in the few
years since that first collision of the lads.</p>

<p>"Of course," remarked Mr. Willard to Teacher Bryton, "I wish
this to be a competitive examination and, therefore, to be perfectly
impartial, but—that is—I am very hopeful that—or—James may be
successful."</p>

<p>"He has every chance in his favor," replied the examiner, with
a quiet smile at the earnestness of the gentleman.</p>

<p>"He has maintained the high standard he showed when I first made
his acquaintance?"</p>

<p>"Fully so; there is no boy in the school that is his equal."</p>

<p>"I would have no anxiety if it was confined to this school, but
you know it takes in my whole congressional district. More than
half these boys are from outside Burkville, and there’s no saying
what will be the result; there may be one or two prodigies among
them."</p>

<p>"That is possible, though I think, if your district had any prodigies,
I would have heard of them; I am not afraid," said the teacher,
with a glow of pride, "to pit my school against any similar institution
in city or country."</p>

<p>"You are warranted in saying that; you deserve credit for the
fine reputation you have given it."</p>

<p>At this point Mr. Bryton announced that the hour devoted to the
subject of history had expired, and he would collect the papers.
He passed round the room and took the documents in turn from the
young men, whom he told that the next hour would be devoted to
grammar.</p>

<p>The questions on the subject of grammar had been written on the
blackboard, but were hidden from sight until now. Drawing aside
the large map which had concealed them, the teacher directed the
boys to go to work. From his elevation on the platform, he could
detect any attempt on the part of one to help another, and this
was his principal occupation, except when talking with his friend
at his elbow.</p>

<p>"Suppose you take a look through the papers," suggested Mr. Willard.</p>

<p>"Would you like to examine several of them?" asked Mr. Bryton,
but the congressman spoiled the compliment by exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Gracious! I couldn’t tell whether half the answers are right.
What little I ever knew about history was forgotten long ago,
and, as for grammar, I doubt whether I can tell a conjunction
from a noun."</p>

<p>"You do yourself injustice," laughed the teacher, who selected
James Decker’s papers from the collection. His experienced eye
ran rapidly down the pages, making little jots in the way of memoranda,
until he reached the end.</p>

<p>"How has he made out?" anxiously asked Mr. Willard.</p>

<p>"His papers are perfect; I have marked him one hundred."</p>

<p>"Good! none can beat that."</p>

<p>"Some, however, may equal it. Let me look through these, which
are very neatly prepared."</p>

<p>Sure enough, those papers also were perfect as were the third.
Mr. Willard began to feel uneasy.</p>

<p>"The questions are comparatively easy; the real test will be
in mathematics, which is the favorite branch at West Point. That
is the last subject and will occupy two hours this afternoon."</p>

<p>It proved to be as the examiner had stated. Although six candidates
held their own in all other studies, yet in the severest test
of all, mathematics, James Decker drew away from them and came
out ahead of every one else.</p>

<p>It will be understood with what pleasure Mr. Willard sent in
the name of Decker to the secretary of war, as his nominee for
the vacant West Point cadetship.</p>
