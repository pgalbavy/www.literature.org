<p>A surprised and very doubtful maid admitted him to Mrs. Hammerton's
tiny reception room and took his card; and he fidgeted there impatiently
until the maid returned to conduct him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hammerton sat at coffee in the combination breakfast and
dining room of her pretty little apartment. He had never seen
her wear glasses, but a pair, presumably hers, was lying across
the morning paper on the edge of the table.</p>

<p>Windows behind her threw her face into shadow against the sunlight,
and he could not clearly distinguish her features. A canary sang
persistently in the sunshine; a friendly cat yawned on the window
sill.</p>

<p>"Have some coffee, James?" she asked, without greeting him.</p>

<p>"Thanks, I've breakfasted."</p>

<p>"Very well. There's a chair." She motioned dismissal to the maid.
"And close the door!" she added curtly.</p>

<p>The maid vanished, closing the door. Aunt Hannah poured more
coffee for herself; now she began to browse on toast and bacon.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the papers?" he asked bluntly.</p>

<p>Her eyes snapped fire: "That was a brave thing <em>you</em> did!
I never knew any of the Desboros were cowards."</p>

<p>He looked at her in angry astonishment.</p>

<p>"Well, what do <em>you</em> call it if it isn't cowardice&mdash;to
slink off and marry a defenseless girl like that!"</p>

<p>"Did you expect me to give you a chance to destroy me and poison
Jacqueline's mind? If I <em>had</em> been guilty of the thing
with which you charge me, what I have done <em>would</em> have
been cowardly. Otherwise, it is justified."</p>

<p>"You have been guilty of enough without that particular thing
to rule you out."</p>

<p>"If," he said, controlling his anger, "you really were appointed
God's deputy on earth, you'd have to rule out the majority of
men who attempt to marry."</p>

<p>"I'd do it, too," she remarked.</p>

<p>"Fortunately," he went on, "your authority for meddling is only
self delegated. You once threatened me. You gave me warning like
a fair adversary. But even rattlesnakes do that!"</p>

<p>He could see her features more plainly now, having become accustomed
to the light; and her scornful expression and the brilliant danger
in her beady eyes did not escape him. She darted at a bit of toast
and swallowed it.</p>

<p>"So," he ended calmly, "I merely accepted the warning and acted
accordingly&mdash;if you call that cowardly."</p>

<p>"I see. You were much too clever for me. In other words, you
forestalled me, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Ask yourself, Aunt Hannah."</p>

<p>"No, I ask you. You <em>did</em> forestall me, didn't you, Jim?"</p>

<p>"I think it amounts to that."</p>

<p>"Oh! Then why are you here at this hour of the morning, after
your wedding night?"</p>

<p>There was a silence. Presently she put on her glasses and glanced
at the paper. When he had his temper and his voice under absolute
control again, he said very quietly:</p>

<p>"Somebody is trying to make my wife unhappy. May I ask if it
is you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly you may ask, James. Ask as many times as you like."
She continued to scan the paper.</p>

<p>"I do ask," he insisted.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Why don't you ask your&mdash;wife?'"]</p>

<p>She laid aside the paper and took off her glasses:</p>

<p>"Very well; failing to obtain the desired information from me,
why don't you ask your&mdash;wife?"</p>

<p>"I have asked her," he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see! Jacqueline also refuses the desired information.
So you come to inquire of me. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is it."</p>

<p>"You go behind your wife's back&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't talk that way, please."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Now, listen very attentively, James, because that is
exactly the way I am going to talk to you. And I'll begin by telling
you plainly just what you have done. <em>You</em>&mdash;and you know
what <em>you</em> are&mdash;have married clandestinely a young, innocent,
inexperienced girl. You, who are not fit to decide the fate of
a new-born yellow pup, have assumed the irrevocable responsibility
of this girl's future&mdash;arranged it yourself in the teeth of the
eternal fitness and decency of things! <em>You</em>, James Desboro,
a good-for-nothing idler, irresponsible spendthrift, half bankrupt,
without ambition, without a profession, without distinction except
that you have good looks and misleading manners and a line of
ancestors which would make an Englishman laugh.</p>

<p>"When you did this thing you knew you were not fit to tie her
shoes. You knew, too, that those who really love her and who might
have shielded her except for this&mdash;this treachery, had warned
you to keep your distance. You knew more than that; you knew that
our little Jacqueline had all her life before her; that for the
first time in her brief career the world was opening its arms
to her; that she was certain to be popular, sure to be welcomed,
respected, liked, loved. You knew that now she was going to have
her chance; that men of distinction, of attainment, of lofty ideals
and irreproachable private lives&mdash;men well to do materially, too&mdash;men
of wealth, ambitious men, forceful men who count, certainly would
seek her, surround her, prefer her, give her what she had a right
to have&mdash;the society of her intellectual peers&mdash;the exercise of
a free, untrammeled judgment, and, ultimately, the opportunity
to select from among real men the man most worthy of such a woman
as she is."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hammerton laid one shapely hand on the table, fingers clenched,
and, half rising, fairly glared at Desboro.</p>

<p>"You have cheated her out of what was her due! You have stolen
her future! You have robbed her of a happy and worthy career to
link her life with your career&mdash;<em>your</em> career&mdash;or whatever
you call the futile parody on life which men of your sort enact,
disgracing God that He knew no more than to create you! And my
righteous anger against you is not wholly personal&mdash;not because
you have swindled me alone&mdash;taken from me the only person I have
really ever cared for&mdash;killed her confidence in me, her tenderness&mdash;but
because you have cheated <em>her</em>, and the world, too! For
she is a rare woman&mdash;a rare, sweet woman, James. And <em>that</em>
is what you have done to the civilisation that has tolerated you!"</p>

<p>He had risen, astounded; but as her denunciation of him became
fiercer, and the concentrated fury in her eyes more deadly, a
slightly dazed feeling began to dull his own rage, and he found
himself listening as though a mere spectator at the terrible arraignment
of another man.</p>

<p>He remained standing. But she had finished; and she was shaking
a little when she resumed her chair; and still he stood there,
pallid, staring at space. For several minutes neither of them
stirred. Finally she said, in a harsh but modified voice:</p>

<p>"I will tell you this much. Since I have known that she is married
I have not interfered. On the contrary, I have written her offering
her my love, my sympathy, and my devotion as long as I live. But
it is a terrible and wicked thing that you have done. And I can
see little chance for her, little hope, and less of happiness&mdash;when
she fully realises what she has done, and what you have done to
her&mdash;when she really understands how low she has stooped and to
what level she has descended to find the man she has married."</p>

<p>He merely gazed at her without expression. She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Hers will become a solitary life, intellectually and spiritually.
There is nothing in you to mate with it. Only materially are you
of the slightest use&mdash;and I think I am not mistaken when I say
your usefulness even there is pitiably limited, and that what
you have to offer her will not particularly attract her. For she
is a rare woman, James&mdash;a species of being absolutely different
from you. And it had been well for you, also, if you had been
wise enough to let her alone. High altitudes don't agree with
you; and not even the merry company on Mount Olympus&mdash;let alone
the graver gathering higher up&mdash;are suitable for such as you and
your mundane kind."</p>

<p>He nodded, scarcely conscious of his mechanical acquiescence
in what she said. Hat and stick in hand, he moved slowly toward
the door. She, watching his departure, said in a lower voice:</p>

<p>"You and I are of the same species. I am no better than you,
James. But&mdash;she is different. And you and I are capable of recognising
that there <em>is</em> a difference. It seems odd, almost ridiculous
to find out at this late date that it is not an alliance with
fashion, wealth, family, social connections, that can do honour
to Jacqueline Nevers, bourgeoise daughter of a French shop-keeper;
it is Jacqueline who honours the caste to which, alas, she has
not risen, but into which she has descended. God knows how far
such a sour and soggy loaf can be leavened by such as she&mdash;or
what she can do for you! Perhaps&#11834;"</p>

<p>She checked herself and shook her head. He walked back to her,
made his adieux mechanically, then went out slowly, like a man
in a trance.</p>

<p>Down in the sunny street the car was waiting; he entered and
sat there, giving no orders, until the chauffeur, leaning wide
from his seat and still holding open the door, ventured to remind
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Then&mdash;you may drive me to Mrs. Clydesdale's."</p>

<p>But the woman whose big and handsome house was now his destination,
had forbidden her servants to disturb her that morning; so when
Desboro presented himself, only his card was received at the door.</p>

<p>Elena, in the drawing-room, hearing the bell, had sprung to her
feet and stepped into the upper hall to listen.</p>

<p>She heard Desboro's voice and shivered, heard her butler say
that she was not at home, heard the bronze doors clash behind
him.</p>

<p>Then, with death in her heart, she went back noiselessly into
the drawing-room where Mr. Waudle, who was squatting on a delicate
French chair, retaining his seat, coolly awaited a resumption
of the interrupted conference. As a matter of fact, he resumed
it himself before she was seated on the sofa at his elbow.</p>

<p>"As I was telling you," he continued, "I've got to make a living.
Why shouldn't you help me? We were friends once. You found me
amusing enough in the old days&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Until you became impudent!"</p>

<p>"Who provoked me? Women need never fear familiarity unless they
encourage it!"</p>

<p>"It was absolutely innocent on my part&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hell!" he said, disgustedly. "It's always the man's fault!
When you pull a cat's tail and the animal scratches, it's the
cat's fault. All right, then; granted! But the fact remains that
if you hadn't looked sideways at me it never would have entered
my head to make any advances to you." Which was a lie. All men
made advances to Elena.</p>

<p>"Leave it so," she said, with the angry flush deepening in her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Sure, I'll leave it; but I'm not going to leave <em>you</em>.
Not yet, Elena. You owe me something for what you've done to me."</p>

<p>"Oh! Is <em>that</em> the excuse?" she nodded scornfully; but
her heart was palpitating with fear, and her lips had become dry
again.</p>

<p>He surveyed her insolently under his heavy eyelids.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "what are you going to do about it? You are
the fortunate one; you have everything &mdash;I nothing. And,
plainly, I'm sick of it. What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Suppose," she said, steadily, "that I tell my husband what you
are doing? Had you considered <em>that</em> possibility?"</p>

<p>"Tell him if you like."</p>

<p>She shrugged.</p>

<p>"What you are doing is blackmail, isn't it?" she asked disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Call it what you please," he said. "Suit yourself, Elena. But
there is a bunch of manuscript in the <em>Tattler's</em> office
which goes into print the moment you play any of your catty games
on me. Understand?"</p>

<p>She said, very pale: "Will you not tell me&mdash;give me some hint
about what you have written?"</p>

<p>He laughed: "Better question your own memory, little lady. Maybe
it isn't about you and Desboro at all; maybe it's something else."</p>

<p>"There was nothing else."</p>

<p>"There was&mdash;<em>me</em>!"</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"Sure," he said cheerfully. "What happened in Philadelphia, if
put skillfully before any jury, would finish <em>you</em>."</p>

<p>"<em>Nothing</em> happened! And you know it!" she exclaimed,
revolted.</p>

<p>"But juries&mdash;and the public&mdash;don't know. All they can do is to
hear the story and then make up their minds. If you choose to
let them hear <em>your</em> story&#11834;"</p>

<p>"There was nothing! I did nothing! <em>Nothing</em>&#11834;" she
faltered.</p>

<p>"But God knows the facts look ugly," he retorted, with smirking
composure. "You're a clever girl; ask yourself what you'd think
if the facts about you and young Desboro&mdash;you and me&mdash;were skillfully
brought out?"</p>

<p>She sat dumb, frightened, twisting her fingers; then, in the
sudden anger born of torture:</p>

<p>"If I am disgraced, what will happen to <em>you</em>!" she flashed
out&mdash;and knew in the same breath that the woman invariably perishes
where the man usually survives; and sat silent and pallid again,
her wide eyes restlessly roaming about her as though seeking refuge.</p>

<p>"Also," he said, "if you sue the <em>Tattler</em> for slander,
there's Munger, you know. He saw us in Philadelphia that night&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Certainly. And if a jury learned that you and I were in the
same&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I did not dream you were to be in the same hotel&mdash;in those rooms&mdash;you
miserable&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Easy, little lady! Easy, now! Never mind what you did or didn't
dream. You're up against reality, now. So never mind about me
at all. Let that Philadelphia business go; it isn't essential.
I've enough to work on without <em>that</em>!"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'I do not believe you,' she said between her
teeth"]</p>

<p>"I do not believe you," she said, between her teeth.</p>

<p>"Oh! Are you really going to defy me?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"I see," he said, thoughtfully, rising and looking instinctively
around. He had the quick, alert side-glance which often characterises
lesser adepts in his profession.</p>

<p>Then, half way to the door, he turned on her again:</p>

<p>"Look here, Elena, I'm tired of this! You fix it so that your
husband keeps those porcelains, or I'll go down town now and turn
in that manuscript! Come on! Which is it?"</p>

<p>"Go, if you like!"</p>

<p>There ensued a breathless silence; his fat hand was on the door,
pushing it already, when a stifled exclamation from her halted
him. After a moment he turned warily.</p>

<p>"I'm desperate," he said. "Pay, or I show you up. Which is it
to be?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>how do I know? What proof have I that you can damage
me&#11834;"</p>

<p>He came all the way back, moistening his thick lips, for he had
played his last card at the door; and, for a second, he supposed
that he was beaten.</p>

<p>"Now, see here," he said, "I don't want to do this. I don't want
to smash anybody, let alone a woman. But, by God! I'll do it if
you don't come across. So make up your mind, Elena."</p>

<p>She strove to sustain his gaze and he leered at her. Finally
he sat down beside her:</p>

<p>"I said I wouldn't give you any proofs. But I guess I will. I'll
prove to you that I've got you good and plenty, little lady. Will
that satisfy you?"</p>

<p>"Prove it!" she strove to say; but her lips scarcely obeyed her.</p>

<p>"All right. Do you remember one evening, just before Christmas,
when you and your husband had been on the outs?"</p>

<p>She bit her lip in silence.</p>

<p>"<em>Do</em> you?" he insisted.</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"All right, so far," he sneered. "Did he perhaps tell you that
he had an appointment at the Kiln Club with a man who was interested
in porcelains and jades?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, he did. He had an appointment for that night. I was the
man."</p>

<p>She understood nothing.</p>

<p>"So," he said, "I waited three hours at the Kiln Club and your
husband didn't show up. Then I telephoned his house. You and he
were probably having your family row just then, for the maid said
he was there, but was too busy to come to the telephone. So I
said that I'd come up to the house in half an hour."</p>

<p>Still she did not comprehend.</p>

<p>"Wait a bit, little lady," he continued, with sly enjoyment of
his own literary methods. "The climax comes where it belongs,
not where you expect it. So now we'll read you a chapter in which
a bitter wind blows heavily, and a solitary taxicab might have
been seen outward bound across the wintry wastes of Gotham Town.
Get me?"</p>

<p>She merely looked at him.</p>

<p>"In that low, black, rakish taxi," he went on, "sat an enterprising
man bent upon selling to your husband the very porcelains which
he subsequently bought. In other words, <em>I</em> sat in that
taxi. <em>I</em> stopped in front of this house; <em>I</em> saw
<em>you</em> leave the house and go scurrying away like a scared
rabbit. And then I went up the steps, rang, was admitted, told
to wait in the library. I waited."</p>

<p>"Where?" The word burst from her involuntarily.</p>

<p>"In the library," he repeated. "It's a nice, cosy, comfortable
place, isn't it? Fine fat sofas, soft cushions, fire in the grate&mdash;oh,
a very comfortable place, indeed! I thought so, anyway, while
I was waiting for your husband to come down stairs."</p>

<p>"It appeared that he had finally received my telephone message&mdash;presumably
after you and he had finished your row&mdash;and had left word that
I was to be admitted. That's why they let me in. So I waited very,
v&mdash;ery comfortably in the library; and somebody had thoughtfully
set out cigars, and whisky, and lemon, and sugar, <em>and</em>
a jug of hot water. It <em>was</em> a cold night, if you remember."</p>

<p>He paused long enough to leer at her.</p>

<p>"Odd," he remarked, "how pleasantly things happen sometimes.
And, as I sat there in that big leather chair&mdash;you must know which
one I mean, Elena&mdash;it is the fattest and most comforting &mdash;I
smoked my cigar and sipped my hot grog, and gazed innocently around.
And <em>what</em> do you suppose my innocent eyes encountered&mdash;just
like that?"</p>

<p>"<em>W&mdash;</em>what?" she breathed.</p>

<p>"Why, a letter!" he said, jovially slapping his fat thigh, "a
real letter lying right in the middle of the table&mdash;badly sealed,
Elena&mdash;very carelessly sealed&mdash;just the gummed point of the envelope
clinging to the body of it. Now, wasn't that a peculiar thing
for an enterprising young man to discover, I ask you?"</p>

<p>He leered and leered into her white face; then, satisfied, he
went on:</p>

<p>"The writing was <em>yours</em>, dearie. I recognised it. It
was addressed to your own husband, who lived under the same roof.
<em>And</em> I had seen you creep out, close the front door softly,
and scurry away into the night." He made a wide gesture with his
fat hands.</p>

<p>"Naturally," he said, "I thought I ought to summon a servant
to call your husband, so I could tell him what I had seen you
do. But&mdash;there was a quicker way to learn what your departure
meant&mdash;whether you were at that moment making for the river or
for Maxim's&mdash;anyway, I knew there was no time to be lost. So&#11834;"</p>

<p>She shrank away and half rose, strangling a cry of protest.</p>

<p>"Sure I did!" he said coolly. "I read your note very carefully,
then licked the envelope and resealed it, and put it into my pocket.
After all, Mr. Desboro is a man. It was none of my business to
interfere. So I let him have what was coming to him&mdash;and you,
too." He shrugged and waved his hand. "Your husband came down
later; we talked jades and porcelains and prices until I nearly
yawned my head off. And when it was time to go, I slipped the
letter back on the table. After all, you and Desboro had had your
fling; why shouldn't hubby have an inning?"</p>

<p>He lay back in his chair and laughed at the cowering woman, who
had dropped her arms on the back of her chair and buried her face
in them. Something about the situation struck him as being very
funny. He regarded her for a few moments, then rose and walked
to the door. There he turned.</p>

<p>"Fix it for me! Understand?" he said sharply; and went out.</p>

<p>As the bronze doors closed behind Mr. Waudle, Elena started and
lifted her frightened face from her arms. For a second or two
she sat there, listening, then rose and walked swiftly and noiselessly
to the bay window. Mr. Waudle was waddling down the street. Across
the way, keeping a parallel course, walked the Cubist poet, his
ankle-high trousers flapping. They did not even glance at each
other until they reached the corner of Madison Avenue. Here they
both boarded the same car going south. Mr. Waudle was laughing.</p>

<p>She came back into the drawing-room and stood, clasped hands
twisting in sheer agony.</p>

<p>To whom could she turn now? What was there to do? Since January
she had given this man so much money that almost nothing remained
of her allowance.</p>

<p>How could she go to her husband again? Never had she betrayed
the slightest sympathy for him or any interest in his hobby until
his anger was awakened by the swindle of which he had been a victim.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, under the menacing pressure from Waudle,
she had attempted finesse&mdash;manoeuvred as skillfully as possible
in the short space of time allotted her, cleverly betrayed an
awakening interest in her husband's collection, pretended to a
sudden caprice for the forgeries recently acquired, and carried
off very well her astonishment when informed that the jades and
porcelains were swindling imitations made in Japan.</p>

<p>It had been useless for her to declare that, whatever they were,
she liked them. Her husband would have none of them in spite of
his evident delight in her sudden interest. He promised to undertake
her schooling in the proper appreciation of all things Chinese&mdash;promised
to be her devoted mentor and companion in the eternal hunt for
specimens. Which was scarcely what she wanted.</p>

<p>But he flatly refused to encourage her in her admiration for
these forgeries or to tolerate such junk under his roof.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "What was she to do? She had gone half mad with
fear"]</p>

<p>What was she to do? She had gone, half mad with fear, to throw
herself upon the sympathy and mercy of Jacqueline Nevers. Terrified,
tortured, desperate, she had even thought to bribe the girl to
pronounce the forgeries genuine. Then, suddenly, at the mere mention
of Desboro, she had gone all to pieces. And when it became clear
to her that there was already an understanding between this girl
and the man she had counted on as her last resort, fear and anger
completed her demoralisation.</p>

<p>She remembered the terrible scene now, remembered what she had
said&mdash;her shameless attitude&mdash;the shameful lie which her words
and her attitude had forced Jacqueline to understand.</p>

<p>Why she had acted such a monstrous falsehood she scarcely knew;
whether it had been done to cut the suspected bond between Desboro
and Jacqueline before it grew too strong to sever&mdash;whether it
had been sheer hysteria under the new shock&mdash;whether it was reckless
despair that had hardened her to a point where she meant to take
the final plunge and trust to Desboro's chivalry, she did not
know then; she did not know now.</p>

<p>But the avalanche she had loosened that night in December, when
she wrote her note and went to Silverwood, was still thundering
along behind her, gathering new force every day, until the menacing
roar of it never ceased in her ears.</p>

<p>And now it had swept her last possible resource away &mdash;Desboro.
All her humiliation, all her shame, the lie she had acted, had
not availed. This girl had married him after all. Like a lightning
stroke the news of their wedding had fallen on her. And on the
very heels of it slunk the blackmailer with his terrifying bag
of secrets.</p>

<p>Where was she to go? To her husband? It was useless. To Desboro?
It was too late. Even now, perhaps, he was listening scornfully
to his young wife's account of that last interview. She could
see the contempt in his face&mdash;contempt for her&mdash;for the woman
who had lied to avow her own dishonour.</p>

<p>Why had he come to see her then? To threaten her? To warn her?
To spurn her? Yet, that was not like Desboro. Why had he come?
What she had said and intimated to Jacqueline was done <em>after</em>
the girl was a wife. Could it be possible that Jacqueline was
visiting her anger on Desboro, having learned too late that which
would have prevented her from marrying him at all?</p>

<p>Elena crept to the sofa and sank down in a heap, cowering there
in one corner, striving to think.</p>

<p>What would come of it? Would this proud and chaste young girl,
accepting the acted lie as truth, resent it? By leaving Desboro?
By beginning a suit for divorce&mdash;and naming&#11834;</p>

<p>Elena cringed, stifling a cry of terror. What had she done? Every
force she had evoked was concentrating into one black cloud over
her head, threatening her utter destruction. Everything she had
done since that December night was helping the forces gathering
to annihilate her. Even Desboro, once a refuge, was now part of
this tempest about to be unloosened.</p>

<p>Truly she had sowed the wind, and the work of her small white
hands was already established upon her.</p>

<p>Never in her life had she really ever cared for any man. Her
caprice for Desboro, founded on the lesser motives, had been the
nearest approach.</p>

<p>It had cost her all her self-control, all her courage, to play
the diplomat with her husband for the sake of obtaining his consent
to keep the forged porcelains. And after all it had been in vain.</p>

<p>In spite of her white misery and wretchedness, now, as she sat
there in the drawing-room alone, her cheeks crimsoned hotly at
the memory of her arts and wiles and calineries; of her new shyness
with the man she had never before spared; of her clever attitude
toward him, the apparent dawn of tenderness, the faint provocation
in her lifted eyes &mdash;God! It should have been her profession,
for she had taken to it like a woman of the streets&mdash;had submitted
like one, earning her pay. And, like many, had been cheated in
the end.</p>

<p>She rose unsteadily, cooling her cheeks in her hands and gazing
vacantly in front of her.</p>

<p>She had not been well for a few days; had meant to see her physician.
But in the rush of events enveloping her there had been no moment
to think of mere bodily ills.</p>

<p>Now, dizzy, trembling, and faintly nauseated, she stood supporting
her weight on a gilded chair, closing her eyes for a moment to
let the swimming wretchedness pass.</p>

<p>It passed after a while, leaving her so utterly miserable that
she leaned over and rang for a maid.</p>

<p>"Order the car&mdash;the Sphex limousine," she said. "And bring me
my hat and furs."</p>

<p>"Yes, madame."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;my jewel box. Here is the key&#11834;" detaching a tiny gold
one from its chain in her bosom. "And if Mr. Clydesdale comes
in, say to him that I have gone to the doctor's."</p>

<p>"Yes, madame."</p>

<p>"And &mdash;I shall take some jewels to&mdash;the safe deposit&mdash;one
or two pieces which I don't wear."</p>

<p>The maid was silent.</p>

<p>"Do you understand about the&mdash;jewels?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madame."</p>

<p>She went away. Presently she returned with Elena's hat and furs
and jewel box. The private garage adjoined the house; the car
rolled out before she was ready.</p>

<p>On the way down town she was afraid she would faint&mdash;almost wished
she would. The chauffeur's instructions landed her at a jeweler's
where she was not known.</p>

<p>A few moments later, in a private office, a grey old gentleman
very gently refused to consider the purchase of any jewelry from
her unless he knew her name, residence, and other essentials which
she flatly declined to give.</p>

<p>So a polite clerk put her into her car and she directed the chauffeur
to Dr. Allen's office, because she felt really too ill for the
moment to continue her search. Later she would manage to find
somebody who would buy sufficient of her jewelry to give her&mdash;and
Mr. Waudle&mdash;the seven thousand dollars necessary to avoid exposure.</p>

<p>Dr. Allen was in&mdash;just returned. Only one patient was ahead of
her. Presently she was summoned, rose with an effort, and went
in.</p>

<p>The physician was a very old man; and after he had questioned
her for a few moments he smiled. And at the same instant she began
to understand; got to her feet blindly, stood swaying for a moment,
then dropped as he caught her.</p>

<p>Neither the physician nor the trained nurse who came in at his
summons seemed to be very greatly worried. As they eased the young
wife and quietly set about reviving her, they chatted carelessly.
Later Elena opened her eyes. Later still the nurse went home with
her in her limousine.</p>
