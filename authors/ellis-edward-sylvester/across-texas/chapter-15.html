<p><em>NICK RIBSAM </em>was partly right in his supposition about
his missing friend, Herbert Watrous.</p>

<p>That young gentleman rode along the lower trail, as confident
as anyone could be that he was right and Nick was wrong. He did
not press Jill, for the pony had done considerable hard riding
during the day, but he arrived at the end of his brief journey
a little in advance of the other.</p>

<p>"I knew it," he said at the moment of catching sight of the pool
of clear water, which, like the spring, was slightly to the right
of the path; "there aren’t many brighter boys than Nick, but he
makes his mistake once in a while, like other folks."</p>

<p>And then, as his pony walked forward to drink, his rider gave
out the signal intended to summon Nick to the spot.</p>

<p>"He will feel cheap when he finds he is wrong, but he is manly
enough to own up to it, and admit that some folks know——"</p>

<p>Sitting astride of his animal while he was helping himself to
a drink, Herbert made good use of his eyes. Just then he observed
that, though the pool resembled a natural spring, it was not.
It was fed by a stream pouring into the upper portion, as large
as that which formed the outlet, while there was no bubbling from
the bottom.</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled the astonished youth; "it begins to look as
if it wasn’t Nick that had made a slip—hello!"</p>

<p>At that moment the call came ringing down from the upper trail.
The matter was settled. Nick had struck the right spot, and all
Herbert could do was to ride back along the path to the fork and
join him.</p>

<p>He was on the point of starting back, when it occurred to him
that it might be possible to shorten the distance by cutting across
the neck of land, as talked about before they parted. The promise
of being able to do so looked more encouraging from below than
above.</p>

<p>Slipping down from the saddle, Herbert began picking his way
through the rough portion, and advanced several rods before reaching
a section where a horse would find the travelling difficult.</p>

<p>"He could make his way this far easily enough," he said, halting
and looking back, "but it doesn’t seem so easy further on."</p>

<p>He advanced more carefully, for he was beginning to doubt the
feasibility of the plan. It will be readily seen that while he
was so uncertain as to the best course, he was consuming more
time than he suspected. Night was rapidly closing in, and he was
still debating what was best to do, when he noticed the increasing
cold.</p>

<p>"It’s the norther, sure enough!" he exclaimed, starting back
to mount his horse; "a little late, but it’s getting there all
the same."</p>

<p>In fact it "got there" with such emphasis that, before Herbert
could force his way to the pool of water, lie thought he would
freeze to death. There was no need of answering the signal of
Nick, and, catching sight of the outlines of what seemed a mass
of rocks in the darkness, he made for them, intent only on securing
shelter for the moment, or until the cutting wind abated enough
to allow him to venture out to recover his horse.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the latter, who had had more than one previous experience
with northers, was trying to help himself somewhat after the same
fashion as his master. Since the arctic breath from the distant
Rocky Mountains came from the north, Jill began edging away from
it by taking the back trail, just as cattle drift before a long
continued and violent storm of sleet and snow.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the pony held any purpose of deserting
his master. He had never tried to do anything of the kind, and
it would be injustice to accuse him in the present instance; but
the instinct of self-preservation was as strong in him as in any
other animal, and he saw no other way of lessening his sufferings
than by edging along the back trail.</p>

<p>When he reached the fork where the two paths separated, he may
have recalled his situation and he may not. Be that as it may,
it was too much to expect him to face about and advance in the
teeth of the norther, before which he had retreated so far, unless
he was compelled to do so. No one was there to urge him with spur,
and instead, therefore, of turning his course, he kept on.</p>

<p>He had moved so reluctantly to this point that he did not reach
it until Nick Ribsam knelt down a short distance off and put his
ear to the ground. By this time, too, it probably struck Jill
that he was moving more slowly than was wise. He therefore struck
a quicker gait, speedily passing beyond hearing in the gloom,
and leaving Nick puzzled, mystified, and anxious beyond expression.</p>

<p>All this time, Herbert Watrous never dreamed that his pony was
steadily increasing the distance between them. If he had known
it, he could have taken no steps to prevent the mishap, for his
whole mental and physical energies were bent toward saving himself
from perishing with the fearful cold.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more fortunate than his finding a small
cavern. It was really providential that he should stumble upon
it, and he would have fared ill had he failed to do so. It was
of slight extent, being no more than a dozen feet in depth, and
of such narrow compass that he bumped his head or struck his limbs
against the sides at every movement he made.</p>

<p>Crouching in the furthest corner, he huddled himself together
as best he could, and concluded there was hope of seeing the thing
through, provided it got no worse.</p>

<p>"If it drops another degree, I’m a goner!" he muttered, as well
as he could between his chattering teeth. "I don’t see what’s
the use of having such weather as this in Texas, when we can get
all we want at the North Pole. It beats anything I ever heard
of in Maine; I’m glad Nick has the blankets, for he must need
them."</p>

<p>For fully two hours Herbert shrank in his place, in the cavity
among the rocks. During most of that time, the wind moaned around
the front, as if seeking him out that it might freeze his very
marrow. The hardest thing for him was to comprehend that he was
actually in Texas, where but a brief while before the temperature
was like a poet’s dream.</p>

<p>There was one thing, however, which he comprehended very clearly.
If he stayed where he was much longer, he would never come out
alive. He had not heard the second signal of Nick, but was confident
that he was able to take care of himself, with his almost unlimited
supply of blankets.</p>

<p>There was one way of warming himself: that was by vigorous exercise.
That might not answer perfectly, but it must help matters. He,
therefore, crept out of his refuge, and began making his way down
to the pool near which he had left his pony. The gloom was too
profound for him to see anything distinctly, and he came within
a hair of pitching headlong into the water, along the edges of
which a thin coating of ice had formed.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Herbert was gratified to notice a decided
rising of the temperature. The relief was great, but not enough
wholly to relieve his sufferings. He called his pony by name,
but of course there was no response.</p>

<p>"He has been more sensible than me," he concluded, "for he has
gone to the spring, where Nick has started a fire for him and
made them all comfortable while I suffered."</p>

<p>The reader need not be reminded that once again Herbert was off
in his reckoning.</p>

<p>He spent the next ten minutes in jumping about, swinging his
arms, and going through the most violent gymnastics possible.
The effect was good. His benumbed limbs became supple, the chilled
surface began glowing, and a grateful warmth crept through his
entire system.</p>

<p>It would have been folly to try to reach Nick by working across
the neck of bowlders and obstructions, and he started down the
trail in the direction taken by Jill, though he was a long way
behind him.</p>

<p>This required no little care, even though he was following a
distinctly marked trail. In the darkness he received several severe
bruises, besides tumbling flat on his face more than once. But
he kept his wits about him, and made sure that he did not pass
the fork, where it was necessary to turn off and follow the trail
taken by Nick, and which had proven to be the right one.</p>

<p>Here it was necessary to use still greater care than before,
for the route was strange to him, and might contain dangerous
pitfalls.</p>

<p>"Nick will wonder what’s become of me," he reflected, maintaining
as lively a pace as he dared, "but I hope he hasn’t worried—halloo!
that’s good!" he added, as he caught the twinkle of a fire; "that’s
where I will find the good fellow, who has known enough to take
care of himself and the ponies, and would have done the same with
me if I hadn’t been so foolish."</p>
