<p>MR. MEADOWLARK was a great admirer of Bobby Bobolink. Much as he liked
to sing himself, he often remained silent when Bobby's joyous music
tinkled over the grass-tops in Farmer Green's meadow. And as Mr.
Meadowlark was listening to one of Bobby's best songs one day an idea
popped suddenly into his head. He liked this notion so well that he flew
straight across the meadow to a thicket on the edge of the woods. And
there in the undergrowth he found Buddy Brown Thrasher, who was exactly
the person he was looking for.
</p>
<p>"I've come over to tell you about an idea of mine," Mr. Meadowlark
announced. "It's about Bobby Bobolink. You know he has come back to
spend the summer here in Pleasant Valley. It seems to me he's in better
voice than ever. And now that he is quite grown up--you know he has a
wife--it seems to me that we couldn't do better than invite him to join
the Pleasant Valley Singing Society."
</p><p>Mr. Meadowlark had explained all this in a most eager manner. And he
couldn't help being a bit disappointed over the way Buddy Brown Thrasher
received it. He did not seem at all excited. To tell the truth, he was a
suspicious chap. He never fell in quickly with a new plan, no matter
what it might be. And more than once he had made matters somewhat
difficult for the Pleasant Valley Singing Society. He was hard to
please. Being a very brilliant singer himself, he was never what you
might call keen to take in a new member.
</p><p>When Mr. Meadowlark had told him about his idea Buddy Brown Thrasher
gave a sharp whistle, "Wheeu!" That was the only remark he made.
</p><p>"What's the matter?" Mr. Meadowlark inquired. "Don't you like my
scheme?"
</p><p>"Oh! It's worth looking into, no doubt," Buddy told him. "But I can't
say offhand whether it's a good one or not.... Of course Bobby Bobolink
would have to pass the test before we take him into the Singing
Society."
</p><p>"If that's all that's troubling you, cheer up!" Mr. Meadowlark cried.
"For Bobby Bobolink can pass the singing test as easily as flying."
</p><p>"I hope so," Buddy Brown Thrasher retorted. "I promise you that I'll be
present when Bobby sings before the Society. And if his singing isn't
what it ought to be, you can depend on me to know it."
</p><p>Well, Mr. Meadowlark couldn't object to that. So he told Buddy Brown
Thrasher that his promise was fair enough. And then Mr. Meadowlark
hurried away to call on other members of the Pleasant Valley Singing
Society and tell them about his plan.
</p><p>After he had seen and talked with every one, Mr. Meadowlark took it upon
himself to go back to the meadow, where he found Bobby Bobolink still
singing merrily. And for once Mr. Meadowlark couldn't wait for him to
finish. For there was no knowing when Bobby would stop.
</p><p>"You're invited," said Mr. Meadowlark, "to sing before the Pleasant
Valley Singing Society. And if you can pass the test you'll become a
member."
</p><p>Bobby Bobolink was somewhat doubtful as he listened to Mr. Meadowlark's
speech.
</p><p>"I'm afraid it will be difficult," he said.
</p><p>"Oh, no!" Mr. Meadowlark assured him. "You can pass the test easily
enough."
</p><p>But Bobby Bobolink told him that that wasn't what he meant.
</p><p>"I'm afraid," he explained, "my wife may not consent!"
