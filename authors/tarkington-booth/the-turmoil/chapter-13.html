<p>Bibbs went home pondering. He did not understand why Sibyl had
laughed. The laughter itself had been spontaneous and beyond suspicion,
but it seemed to him that she had only affected the effort to
suppress it and that she wished it to be significant. Significant
of what? And why had she wished to impress upon him the fact of
her overwhelming amusement? He found no answer, but she had succeeded
in disturbing him, and he wished that he had not encountered her.</p>

<p>At home, uncles, aunts, and cousins from out of town were wandering
about the house, several mournfully admiring the "Bay of Naples,"
and others occupied with the Moor and the plumbing, while they
waited for trains. Edith and her mother had retired to some upper
fastness, but Bibbs interviewed Jackson and had the various groups
of relatives summoned to the dining-room for food. One great-uncle,
old Gideon Sheridan from Boonville, could not be found, and Bibbs
went in search of him. He ransacked the house, discovering the
missing antique at last by accident. Passing his father's closed
door on tiptoe, Bibbs heard a murmurous sound, and paused to listen.
The sound proved to be a quavering and rickety voice, monotonously
bleating:</p>

<p>"The Lo-ord givuth and the Lo-ord takuth away! We got to remember
that; we got to remember that! I'm a-gittin' along, James; I'm
a-gittin' along, and I've seen a-many of 'em go&mdash;two daughters
and a son the Lord give me, and He has taken all away. For the
Lo-ord givuth and the Lo-ord takuth away! Remember the words of
Bildad the Shuhite, James. Bildad the Shuhite says, 'He shall
have neither son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining
in his dwellings.' Bildad the Shuhite&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bibbs opened the door softly. His father was lying upon the bed,
in his underclothes, face downward, and Uncle Gideon sat near
by, swinging backward and forward in a rocking-chair, stroking
his long white beard and gazing at the ceiling as he talked. Bibbs
beckoned him urgently, but Uncle Gideon paid no attention.</p>

<p>"Bildad the Shuhite spake and his says, 'If thy children have
sinned against Him and He have cast them away&mdash;'"</p>

<p>There was a muffled explosion beneath the floor, and the windows
rattled. The figure lying face downward on the bed did not move,
but Uncle Gideon leaped from his chair. "My God!" he cried. "What's
that?"</p>

<p>There came a second explosion, and Uncle Gideon ran out into
the hall. Bibbs went to the head of the great staircase, and,
looking down, discovered the source of the disturbance. Gideon's
grandson, a boy of fourteen, had brought his camera to the funeral
and was taking "flash-lights" of the Moor. Uncle Gideon, reassured
by Bibbs's explanation, would have returned to finish his quotation
from Bildad the Shuhite, but Bibbs detained him, and after a little
argument persuaded him to descend to the dining-room whither Bibbs
followed, after closing the door of his father's room.</p>

<p>He kept his eye on Gideon after dinner, diplomatically preventing
several attempts on the part of that comforter to reascend the
stairs; and it was a relief to Bibbs when George announced that
an automobile was waiting to convey the ancient man and his grandson
to their train. They were the last to leave, and when they had
gone Bibbs went sighing to his own room.</p>

<p>He stretched himself wearily upon the bed, but presently rose,
went to the window, and looked for a long time at the darkened
house where Mary Vertrees lived. Then he opened his trunk, took
therefrom a small note-book half filled with fragmentary scribblings,
and began to write:</p>

<p>  Laughter after a funeral.  In this reaction people will laugh
at   anything and at nothing.  The band plays a dirge on the way
to the   cemetery, but when it turns back, and the mourning carriages
are   out of hearing, it strikes up, "Darktown is Out To-night." 
That   is natural&mdash;but there are women whose laughter is like
the whirring   of whips.  Why is it that certain kinds of laughter
seem to spoil   something hidden away from the laughers?  If they
do not know of   it, and have never seen it, how can their laughter
hurt it?  Yet it   does.  Beauty is not out of place among grave-stones. 
It is not   out of place anywhere.  But a woman who has been betrothed
to a   man would not look beautiful at his funeral.  A woman might
look   beautiful, though, at the funeral of a man whom she had
known and   liked.  And in that case, too, she would probably
not want to talk   if she drove home from the cemetery with his
brother:  nor would   she want the brother to talk.  Silence is
usually either stupid or   timid.  But for a man who stammers
if he tries to talk fast, and   drawls so slowly, when he doesn't
stammer, that nobody has time to   listen to him, silence is advisable. 
Nevertheless, too much silence   is open to suspicion.  It may
be reticence, or it may be a vacuum.   It may be dignity, or it
may be false teeth.</p>

<p>  Sometimes an imperceptible odor will become perceptible in
a small   inclosure, such as a closed carriage.  The ghost of
gasoline rising   from a lady's glove might be sweeter to the
man riding beside her   than all the scents of Arcady in spring. 
It depends on the lady-  but there <em>ARE!  </em>Three miles
may be three hundred miles, or it may   be three feet.  When it
is three feet you have not time to say a   great deal before you
reach the end of it.  Still, it may be that   one should begin
to speak.</p>

<p>  No one could help wishing to stay in a world that holds some
of   the people that are in this world.  There are some so wonderful  
you do not understand how the dead <em>COULD </em>die.  How could
they let   themselves?  A falling building does not care who falls
with it.   It does not choose who shall be upon its roof and who
shall not.   Silence <em>CAN </em>be golden?  Yes.  But perhaps
if a woman of the world   should find herself by accident sitting
beside a man for the length   of time it must necessarily take
two slow old horses to jog three   miles, she might expect that
man to say something of some sort!   Even if she thought him a
feeble hypochondriac, even if she had   heard from others that
he was a disappointment to his own people,   even if she had seen
for herself that he was a useless and   irritating encumbrance
everywhere, she might expect him at least   to speak&mdash;she might
expect him to open his mouth and try to make   sounds, if he only
barked.  If he did not even try, but sat every   step of the way
as dumb as a frozen fish, she might <em>THINK </em>him a   frozen
fish.  And she might be right.  She might be right if she   thought
him about as pleasant a companion as&mdash;as Bildad the Shuhite!</p>

<p>Bibbs closed his note-book, replacing it in his trunk. Then,
after a period of melancholy contemplation, he undressed, put
on a dressing-gown and slippers, and went softly out into the
hall&mdash;to his father's door. Upon the floor was a tray which Bibbs
had sent George, earlier in the evening, to place upon a table
in Sheridan's room&mdash;but the food was untouched. Bibbs stood listening
outside the door for several minutes. There came no sound from
within, and he went back to his own room and to bed.</p>

<p>In the morning he woke to a state of being hitherto unknown in
his experience. Sometimes in the process of waking there is a
little pause&mdash;sleep has gone, but coherent thought has not begun.
It is a curious half-void, a glimpse of aphasia; and although
the person experiencing it may not know for that instant his own
name or age or sex, he may be acutely conscious of depression
or elation. It is the moment, as we say, before we "remember";
and for the first time in Bibbs's life it came to him bringing
a vague happiness. He woke to a sense of new riches; he had the
feeling of a boy waking to a birthday. But when the next moment
brought him his memory, he found nothing that could explain his
exhilaration. On the contrary, under the circumstances it seemed
grotesquely unwarranted. However, it was a brief visitation and
was gone before he had finished dressing. It left a little trail,
the pleased recollection of it and the puzzle of it, which remained
unsolved. And, in fact, waking happily in the morning is not usually
the result of a drive home from a funeral. No wonder the sequence
evaded Bibbs Sheridan!</p>

<p>His father had gone when he came down-stairs. "Went on down to
's office, jes' same," Jackson informed him. "Came sat breakfas'-table,
all by 'mself; eat nothin'. George bring nice breakfas', but he
di'n' eat a thing. Yessuh, went on down-town, jes' same he yoosta
do. Yessuh, I reckon putty much ev'y-thing goin' go on same as
it yoosta do."</p>

<p>It struck Bibbs that Jackson was right. The day passed as other
days had passed. Mrs. Sheridan and Edith were in black, and Mrs.
Sheridan cried a little, now and then, but no other external difference
was to be seen. Edith was quiet, but not noticeably depressed,
and at lunch proved herself able to argue with her mother upon
the propriety of receiving calls in the earliest stages of "mourning."
Lunch was as usual&mdash;for Jim and his father had always lunched
down-town&mdash;and the afternoon was as usual. Bibbs went for his
drive, and his mother went with him, as she sometimes did when
the weather was pleasant. Altogether, the usualness of things
was rather startling to Bibbs.</p>

<p>During the drive Mrs. Sheridan talked fragmentarily of Jim's
childhood. "But you wouldn't remember about that," she said, after
narrating an episode. "You were too little. He was always a good
boy, just like that. And he'd save whatever papa gave him, and
put it in the bank. I reckon it'll just about kill your father
to put somebody in his place as president of the Realty Company,
Bibbs. I know he can't move Roscoe over; he told me last week
he'd already put as much on Roscoe as any one man could handle
and not go crazy. Oh, it's a pity&mdash;" She stopped to wipe her eyes.
"It's a pity you didn't run more with Jim, Bibbs, and kind o'
pick up his ways. Think what it'd meant to papa now! You never
did run with either Roscoe or Jim any, even before you got sick.
Of course, you were younger; but it always <em>DID </em>seem queer&mdash;and
you three bein' brothers like that. I don't believe I ever saw
you and Jim sit down together for a good talk in my life."</p>

<p>"Mother, I've been away so long," Bibbs returned, gently. "And
since I came home I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I ain't reproachin' you, Bibbs," she said. "Jim ain't been
home much of an evening since you got back&mdash;what with his work
and callin' and goin' to the theater and places, and often not
even at the house for dinner. Right the evening before he got
hurt he had his dinner at some miser'ble rest'rant down by the
Pump Works, he was so set on overseein' the night work and gettin'
everything finished up right to the minute he told papa he would.
I reckon you might 'a' put in more time with Jim if there'd been
more opportunity, Bibbs. I expect you feel almost as if you scarcely
really knew him right well."</p>

<p>"I suppose I really didn't, mother. He was busy, you see, and
I hadn't much to say about the things that interested him, because
I don't know much about them."</p>

<p>"It's a pity! Oh, it's a pity!" she moaned. "And you'll have
to learn to know about 'em <em>NOW, </em>Bibbs! I haven't said
much to you, because I felt it was all between your father and
you, but I honestly do believe it will just kill him if he has
to have any more trouble on top of all this! You mustn't <em>LET
</em>him, Bibbs&mdash;you mustn't! You don't know how he's grieved
over you, and now he can't stand any more&mdash;he just can't! Whatever
he says for you to do, you DO it, Bibbs, you DO it! I want you
to promise me you will."</p>

<p>"I would if I could," he said, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"No, no! Why can't you?" she cried, clutching his arm. "He wants
you to go back to the machine-shop and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;'like it'!" said Bibbs.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it&mdash;to go in a cheerful spirit. Dr. Gurney said
it wouldn't hurt you if you went in a cheerful spirit&mdash;the doctor
said that himself, Bibbs. So why can't you do it? Can't you do
that much for your father? You ought to think what he's done for
<em>YOU. </em>You got a beautiful house to live in; you got automobiles
to ride in; you got fur coats and warm clothes; you been taken
care of all your life. And you don't <em>KNOW </em>how he worked
for the money to give all these things to you! You don't <em>DREAM
</em>what he had to go through and what he risked when we were
startin' out in life; and you never <em>WILL </em>know! And now
this blow has fallen on him out of a clear sky, and you make it
out to be a hardship to do like he wants you to! And all on earth
he asks is for you to go back to the work in a cheerful spirit,
so it won't hurt you! That's all he asks. Look, Bibbs, we're gettin'
back near home, but before we get there I want you to promise
me that you'll do what he asks you to. Promise me!"</p>

<p>In her earnestness she cleared away her black veil that she might
see him better, and it blew out on the smoky wind. He readjusted
it for her before he spoke.</p>

<p>"I'll go back in as cheerful a spirit as I can, mother," he said.</p>

<p>"There!" she exclaimed, satisfied. "That's a good boy! That's
all I wanted you to say."</p>

<p>"Don't give me any credit," he said, ruefully. "There isn't anything
else for me to do."</p>

<p>"Now, don't begin talkin' <em>THAT </em>way!"</p>

<p>"No, no," he soothed her. "We'll have to begin to make the spirit
a cheerful one. We may&mdash;" They were turning into their own driveway
as he spoke, and he glanced at the old house next door. Mary Vertrees
was visible in the twilight, standing upon the front steps, bareheaded,
the door open behind her. She bowed gravely.</p>

<p>"'We may'&mdash;what?" asked Mrs. Sheridan, with a slight impatience.</p>

<p>"What is it, mother?"</p>

<p>"You said, 'We may,' and didn't finish what you were sayin'."</p>

<p>"Did I?" said Bibbs, blankly. "Well, what <em>WERE </em>we saying?"</p>

<p>"Of all the queer boys!" she cried. "You always were. Always!
You haven't forgot what you just promised me, have you?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered, as the car stopped. "No, the spirit will be
as cheerful as the flesh will let it, mother. It won't do to behave
like&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice was low, and in her movement to descend from the car
she failed to here his final words.</p>

<p>"Behave like who, Bibbs?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>But she was fretful in her grief. "You said it wouldn't do to
behave like <em>SOMEBODY. </em>Behave like <em>WHO</em>?"</p>

<p>"It was just nonsense," he explained, turning to go in. "An obscure
person I don't think much of lately."</p>

<p>"Behave like <em>WHO?" </em>she repeated, and upon his yielding
to her petulant insistence, she made up her mind that the only
thing to do was to tell Dr. Gurney about it.</p>

<p>"Like Bildad the Shuhite!" was what Bibbs said.</p>
