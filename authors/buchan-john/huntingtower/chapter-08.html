<p>The first cocks had just begun to crow and the clocks had not
yet struck five when Dickson presented himself at Mrs. Morran's
back door. That active woman had already been half an hour out
of bed, and was drinking her morning cup of tea in the kitchen.
She received him with cordiality, nay, with relief.</p>

<p>"Eh, sirs, but I'm glad to see ye back. Guid kens what's gaun
on at the Hoose thae days. Mr. Heritage left here yestreen, creepin'
round by dyke-sides and berry-busses like a wheasel. It's a mercy
to get a responsible man in the place. I aye had a notion ye wad
come back, for, thinks I, nevoy Dickson is no the yin to desert
folk in trouble.... Whaur's my wee kist?... Lost, ye say. That's
a peety, for it's been my cheese-box thae thirty year."</p>

<p>Dickson ascended to the loft, having announced his need of at
least three hours' sleep. As he rolled into bed his mind was curiously
at ease. He felt equipped for any call that might be made on him.
That Mrs. Morran should welcome him back as a resource in need
gave him a new assurance of manhood.</p>

<p>He woke between nine and ten to the sound of rain lashing against
the garret window. As he picked his way out of the mazes of sleep
and recovered the skein of his immediate past, he found to his
disgust that he had lost his composure. All the flock of fears
that had left him when, on the top of the Glasgow tram-car, he
had made the great decision had flown back again and settled like
black crows on his spirit. He was running a horrible risk and
all for a whim. What business had he to be mixing himself up in
things he did not understand? It might be a huge mistake, and
then he would be a laughing stock; for a moment he repented his
telegram to Mr. Caw. Then he recanted that suspicion; there could
be no mistake, except the fatal one that he had taken on a job
too big for him. He sat on the edge of his bed and shivered, with
his eyes on the grey drift of rain. He would have felt more stout-hearted
had the sun been shining.</p>

<p>He shuffled to the window and looked out. There in the village
street was Dobson, and Dobson saw him. That was a bad blunder,
for his reason told him that he should have kept his presence
in Dalquharter hid as long as possible.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the cottage door, and presently Mrs. Morran
appeared.</p>

<p>"It's the man frae the inn," she announced. "He's wantin' a word
wi' ye. Speakin' verra ceevil, too."</p>

<p>"Tell him to come up," said Dickson. He might as well get the
interview over. Dobson had seen Loudon and must know of their
conversation. The sight of himself back again when he had pretended
to be off to Glasgow would remove him effectually from the class
of the unsuspected. He wondered just what line Dobson would take.</p>

<p>The innkeeper obtruded his bulk through the low door. His face
was wrinkled into a smile, which nevertheless left the small eyes
ungenial. His voice had a loud vulgar cordiality. Suddenly Dickson
was conscious of a resemblance, a resemblance to somebody whom
he had recently seen. It was Loudon. There was the same thrusting
of the chin forward, the same odd cheek-bones, the same unctuous
heartiness of speech. The innkeeper, well washed and polished
and dressed, would be no bad copy of the factor. They must be
near kin, perhaps brothers.</p>

<p>"Good morning to you, Mr. McCunn. Man, it's pitifu' weather,
and just when the farmers are wanting a dry seed-bed. What brings
ye back here? Ye travel the country like a drover."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm a free man now and I took a fancy to this place. An
idle body has nothing to do but please himself."</p>

<p>"I hear ye're taking a lease of Huntingtower?"</p>

<p>"Now who told you that?"</p>

<p>"Just the clash of the place. Is it true?"</p>

<p>Dickson looked sly and a little annoyed.</p>

<p>"I maybe had half a thought of it, but I'll thank you not to
repeat the story. It's a big house for a plain man like me, and
I haven't properly inspected it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll keep mum, never fear. But if ye've that sort of notion,
I can understand you not being able to keep away from the place."</p>

<p>"That's maybe the fact," Dickson admitted.</p>

<p>"Well! It's just on that point I want a word with you." The innkeeper
seated himself unbidden on the chair which held Dickson's modest
raiment. He leaned forward and with a coarse forefinger tapped
Dickson's pyjama-clad knees. "I can't have ye wandering about
the place. I'm very sorry, but I've got my orders from Mr. Loudon.
So if you think that by bidin' here ye can see more of the House
and the policies, ye're wrong, Mr. McCunn. It can't be allowed,
for we're no' ready for ye yet. D'ye understand? That's Mr. Loudon's
orders.... Now, would it not be a far better plan if ye went back
to Glasgow and came back in a week's time? I'm thinking of your
own comfort, Mr. McCunn."</p>

<p>Dickson was cogitating hard. This man was clearly instructed
to get rid of him at all costs for the next few days. The neighbourhood
had to be cleared for some black business. The tinklers had been
deputed to drive out the Gorbals Die-Hards, and as for Heritage
they seemed to have lost track of him. He, Dickson, was now the
chief object of their care. But what could Dobson do if he refused?
He dared not show his true hand. Yet he might, if sufficiently
irritated. It became Dickson's immediate object to get the innkeeper
to reveal himself by rousing his temper. He did not stop to consider
the policy of this course; he imperatively wanted things cleared
up and the issue made plain.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I'm much obliged to you for thinking so much about
my comfort," he said in a voice into which he hoped he had insinuated
a sneer. "But I'm bound to say you're awful suspicious folk about
here. You needn't be feared for your old policies. There's plenty
of nice walks about the roads, and I want to explore the sea-coast."</p>

<p>The last words seemed to annoy the innkeeper. "That's no' allowed
either," he said. "The shore's as private as the policies....
Well, I wish ye joy tramping the roads in the glaur."</p>

<p>"It's a queer thing," said Dickson meditatively, "that you should
keep an hotel and yet be set on discouraging people from visiting
this neighbourhood. I tell you what, I believe that hotel of yours
is all sham. You've some other business, you and these lodgekeepers,
and in my opinion it's not a very creditable one."</p>

<p>"What d'ye mean?" asked Dobson sharply.</p>

<p>"Just what I say. You must expect a body to be suspicious, if
you treat him as you're treating me." Loudon must have told this
man the story with which he had been fobbed off about the half-witted
Kennedy relative. Would Dobson refer to that?</p>

<p>The innkeeper had an ugly look on his face, but he controlled
his temper with an effort. "There's no cause for suspicion," he
said. "As far as I'm concerned it's all honest and aboveboard."</p>

<p>"It doesn't look like it. It looks as if you were hiding something
up in the House which you don't want me to see."</p>

<p>Dobson jumped from his chair, his face pale with anger. A man
in pyjamas on a raw morning does not feel at his bravest, and
Dickson quailed under the expectation of assault. But even in
his fright he realised that Loudon could not have told Dobson
the tale of the half-witted lady. The last remark had cut clean
through all camouflage and reached the quick.</p>

<p>"What the hell d' ye mean?" he cried. "Ye're a spy, are ye? Ye
fat little fool, for two cents I'd wring your neck."</p>

<p>Now it is an odd trait of certain mild people that a suspicion
of threat, a hint of bullying, will rouse some unsuspected obstinacy
deep down in their souls. The insolence of the man's speech woke
a quiet but efficient little devil in Dickson.</p>

<p>"That's a bonny tone to adopt in addressing a gentleman. If you've
nothing to hide what way are you so touchy? I can't be a spy unless
there's something to spy on."</p>

<p>The innkeeper pulled himself together. He was apparently acting
on instructions, and had not yet come to the end of them. He made
an attempt at a smile.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I beg your pardon if I spoke too hot. But it nettled
me to hear ye say that.... I'll be quite frank with ye, Mr. McCunn,
and, believe me, I'm speaking in your best interests. I give ye
my word there's nothing wrong up at the House. I'm on the side
of the law, and when I tell ye the whole story ye'll admit it.
But I can't tell it ye yet.... This is a wild, lonely bit and
very few folk bide in it. And these are wild times, when a lot
of queer things happen that never get into the papers. I tell
ye it's for your own good to leave Dalquharter for the present.
More I can't say, but I ask ye to look at it as a sensible man.
Ye're one that's accustomed to a quiet life and no' meant for
rough work. Ye'll do no good if you stay, and, maybe, ye'll land
yourself in bad trouble."</p>

<p>"Mercy on us!" Dickson exclaimed. "What is it you're expecting?
Sinn Fein?"</p>

<p>The innkeeper nodded. "Something like that."</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear the like? I never did think much of the Irish."</p>

<p>"Then ye'll take my advice and go home? Tell ye what, I'll drive
ye to the station."</p>

<p>Dickson got up from the bed, found his new safety-razor and began
to strop it. "No, I think I'll bide. If you're right there'll
be more to see than glaury roads."</p>

<p>"I'm warning ye, fair and honest. Ye ... can't ... be ... allowed
... to ... stay ... here!"</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" said Dickson. "Is there any law in Scotland,
think you, that forbids a man to stop a day or two with his auntie?"</p>

<p>"Ye'll stay?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I'll stay."</p>

<p>"By God, we'll see about that."</p>

<p>For a moment Dickson thought that he would be attacked, and he
measured the distance that separated him from the peg whence hung
his waterproof with the pistol in its pocket. But the man restrained
himself and moved to the door. There he stood and cursed him with
a violence and a venom which Dickson had not believed possible.
The full hand was on the table now.</p>

<p>"Ye wee pot-bellied, pig-heided Glasgow grocer," (I paraphrase),
"would <em>you</em> set up to defy me? I tell ye, I'll make ye
rue the day ye were born." His parting words were a brilliant
sketch of the maltreatment in store for the body of the defiant
one.</p>

<p>"Impident dog," said Dickson without heat. He noted with pleasure
that the innkeeper hit his head violently against the low lintel,
and, missing a step, fell down the loft stairs into the kitchen,
where Mrs. Morran's tongue could be heard speeding him trenchantly
from the premises.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Dickson dressed leisurely, and by and by went
down to the kitchen and watched his hostess making broth. The
fracas with Dobson had done him all the good in the world, for
it had cleared the problem of dubieties and had put an edge on
his temper. But he realised that it made his continued stay in
the cottage undesirable. He was now the focus of all suspicion,
and the innkeeper would be as good as his word and try to drive
him out of the place by force. Kidnapping, most likely, and that
would be highly unpleasant, besides putting an end to his usefulness.
Clearly he must join the others. The soul of Dickson hungered
at the moment for human companionship. He felt that his courage
would be sufficient for any team-work, but might waver again if
he were left to play a lone hand.</p>

<p>He lunched nobly off three plates of Mrs. Morran's kail&mdash;an early
lunch, for that lady, having breakfasted at five, partook of the
midday meal about eleven. Then he explored her library, and settled
himself by the fire with a volume of Covenanting tales, entitled
<em>Gleanings among the Mountains</em>. It was a most practical
work for one in his position, for it told how various eminent
saints of that era escaped the attention of Claverhouse's dragoons.
Dickson stored up in his memory several of the incidents in case
they should come in handy. He wondered if any of his forbears
had been Covenanters; it comforted him to think that some old
progenitor might have hunkered behind turf walls and been chased
for his life in the heather. "Just like me," he reflected. "But
the dragoons weren't foreigners, and there was a kind of decency
about Claverhouse too."</p>

<p>About four o'clock Dougal presented himself in the back kitchen.
He was an even wilder figure than usual, for his bare legs were
mud to the knees, his kilt and shirt clung sopping to his body,
and, having lost his hat, his wet hair was plastered over his
eyes. Mrs. Morran said, not unkindly, that he looked "like a wull-cat
glowerin' through a whin buss."</p>

<p>"How are you, Dougal?" Dickson asked genially. "Is the peace
of nature smoothing out the creases in your poor little soul?"</p>

<p>"What's that ye say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just what I heard a man say in Glasgow. How have you got
on?"</p>

<p>"Not so bad. Your telegram was sent this mornin'. Old Bill took
it in to Kirkmichael. That's the first thing. Second, Thomas Yownie
has took a party to get down the box from the station. He got
Mrs. Sempill's powny and he took the box ayont the Laver by the
ford at the herd's hoose and got it on to the shore maybe a mile
ayont Laverfoot. He managed to get the machine up as far as the
water, but he could get no farther, for ye'll no' get a machine
over the wee waterfa' just before the Laver ends in the sea. So
he sent one o' the men back with it to Mrs. Sempill, and, since
the box was ower heavy to carry, he opened it and took the stuff
across in bits. It's a' safe in the hole at the foot o' the Huntingtower
rocks, and he reports that the rain has done it no harm. Thomas
has made a good job of it. Ye'll no fickle Thomas Yownie."</p>

<p>"And what about your camp on the moor?"</p>

<p>"It was broke up afore daylight. Some of our things we've got
with us, and most is hid near at hand. The tents are in the auld
wife's henhoose," and he jerked his disreputable head in the direction
of the back door.</p>

<p>"Have the tinklers been back?"</p>

<p>"Ay. They turned up about ten o'clock, no doubt intendin' murder.
I left Wee Jaikie to watch developments. They fund him sittin'
on a stone, greetin' sore. When he saw them, he up and started
to run, and they cried on him to stop, but he wouldn't listen.
Then they cried out where were the rest, and he telled them they
were feared for their lives and had run away. After that they
offered to catch him, but ye'll no' catch Jaikie in a hurry. When
he had run round about them till they were wappit, he out wi'
his catty and got one o' them on the lug. Syne he made for the
Laverfoot and reported."</p>

<p>"Man, Dougal, you've managed fine. Now I've something to tell
you," and Dickson recounted his interview with the innkeeper.
"I don't think it's safe for me to bide here, and if I did, I
wouldn't be any use, hiding in cellars and such like, and not
daring to stir a foot. I'm coming with you to the House. Now tell
me how to get there."</p>

<p>Dougal agreed to this view. "There's been nothing doing at the
Hoose the day, but they're keepin' a close watch on the policies.
The cripus may come any moment. There's no doubt, Mr. McCunn,
that ye're in danger, for they'll serve you as the tinklers tried
to serve us. Listen to me. Ye'll walk up the station road, and
take the second turn on your left, a wee grass road that'll bring
ye to the ford at the herd's hoose. Cross the Laver&mdash;there's a
plank bridge&mdash;and take straight across the moor in the direction
of the peakit hill they call Grey Carrick. Ye'll come to a big
burn, which ye must follow till ye get to the shore. Then turn
south, keepin' the water's edge till ye reach the Laver, where
you'll find one o' us to show ye the rest of the road.... I must
be off now, and I advise ye not to be slow of startin', for wi'
this rain the water's risin' quick. It's a mercy it's such coarse
weather, for it spoils the veesibility."</p>

<p>"Auntie Phemie," said Dickson a few minutes later, "will you
oblige me by coming for a short walk?"</p>

<p>"The man's daft," was the answer.</p>

<p>"I'm not. I'll explain if you'll listen.... You see," he concluded,
"the dangerous bit for me is just the mile out of the village.
They'll no' be so likely to try violence if there's somebody with
me that could be a witness. Besides, they'll maybe suspect less
if they just see a decent body out for a breath of air with his
auntie."</p>

<p>Mrs. Morran said nothing, but retired, and returned presently
equipped for the road. She had indued her feet with goloshes and
pinned up her skirts till they looked like some demented Paris
mode. An ancient bonnet was tied under her chin with strings,
and her equipment was completed by an exceedingly smart tortoise-shell-handled
umbrella, which, she explained, had been a Christmas present from
her son.</p>

<p>"I'll convoy ye as far as the Laverfoot herd's," she announced.
"The wife's a freend o' mine and will set me a bit on the road
back. Ye needna fash for me. I'm used to a' weathers."</p>

<p>The rain had declined to a fine drizzle, but a tearing wind from
the south-west scoured the land. Beyond the shelter of the trees
the moor was a battle-ground of gusts which swept the puddles
into spindrift and gave to the stagnant bog-pools the appearance
of running water. The wind was behind the travellers, and Mrs.
Morran, like a full-rigged ship, was hustled before it, so that
Dickson, who had linked arms with her, was sometimes compelled
to trot.</p>

<p>"However will you get home, mistress?" he murmured anxiously.</p>

<p>"Fine. The wind will fa' at the darkenin'. This'll be a sair
time for ships at sea."</p>

<p>Not a soul was about, as they breasted the ascent of the station
road and turned down the grassy bypath to the Laverfoot herd's.
The herd's wife saw them from afar and was at the door to receive
them.</p>

<p>"Megsty! Phemie Morran!" she shrilled. "Wha wad ettle to see
ye on a day like this? John's awa' at Dumfries, buyin' tups. Come
in, the baith o' ye. The kettle's on the boil."</p>

<p>"This is my nevoy Dickson," said Mrs. Morran. "He's gaun to stretch
his legs ayont the burn, and come back by the Ayr road. But I'll
be blithe to tak' my tea wi' ye, Elspeth.... Now, Dickson, I'll
expect ye back on the chap o' seeven."</p>

<p>He crossed the rising stream on a swaying plank and struck into
the moorland, as Dougal had ordered, keeping the bald top of Grey
Carrick before him. In that wild place with the tempest battling
overhead he had no fear of human enemies. Steadily he covered
the ground, till he reached the west-flowing burn that was to
lead him to the shore. He found it an entertaining companion,
swirling into black pools, foaming over little falls, and lying
in dark canal-like stretches in the flats. Presently it began
to descend steeply in a narrow green gully, where the going was
bad, and Dickson, weighted with pack and waterproof, had much
ado to keep his feet on the sodden slopes. Then, as he rounded
a crook of hill, the ground fell away from his feet, the burn
swept in a water-slide to the boulders of the shore, and the storm-tossed
sea lay before him.</p>

<p>It was now that he began to feel nervous. Being on the coast
again seemed to bring him inside his enemies' territory, and had
not Dobson specifically forbidden the shore? It was here that
they might be looking for him. He felt himself out of condition,
very wet and very warm, but he attained a creditable pace, for
he struck a road which had been used by manure-carts collecting
seaweed. There were faint marks on it, which he took to be the
wheels of Dougal's "machine" carrying the provision-box. Yes.
On a patch of gravel there was a double set of tracks, which showed
how it had returned to Mrs. Sempill. He was exposed to the full
force of the wind, and the strenuousness of his bodily exertions
kept his fears quiescent, till the cliffs on his left sunk suddenly
and the valley of the Laver lay before him.</p>

<p>A small figure rose from the shelter of a boulder, the warrior
who bore the name of Old Bill. He saluted gravely.</p>

<p>"Ye're just in time. The water has rose three inches since I've
been here. Ye'd better strip."</p>

<p>Dickson removed his boots and socks. "Breeks, too," commanded
the boy; "there's deep holes ayont thae stanes."</p>

<p>Dickson obeyed, feeling very chilly, and rather improper. "Now,
follow me," said the guide. The next moment he was stepping delicately
on very sharp pebbles, holding on to the end of the scout's pole,
while an icy stream ran to his knees.</p>

<p>The Laver as it reaches the sea broadens out to the width of
fifty or sixty yards and tumbles over little shelves of rock to
meet the waves. Usually it is shallow, but now it was swollen
to an average depth of a foot or more, and there were deeper pockets.
Dickson made the passage slowly and miserably, sometimes crying
out with pain as his toes struck a sharper flint, once or twice
sitting down on a boulder to blow like a whale, once slipping
on his knees and wetting the strange excrescence about his middle,
which was his tucked-up waterproof. But the crossing was at length
achieved, and on a patch of sea-pinks he dried himself perfunctorily
and hastily put on his garments. Old Bill, who seemed to be regardless
of wind or water, squatted beside him and whistled through his
teeth.</p>

<p>Above them hung the sheer cliffs of the Huntingtower cape, so
sheer that a man below was completely hidden from any watcher
on the top. Dickson's heart fell, for he did not profess to be
a cragsman and had indeed a horror of precipitous places. But
as the two scrambled along the foot, they passed deep-cut gullies
and fissures, most of them unclimbable, but offering something
more hopeful than the face. At one of these Old Bill halted and
led the way up and over a chaos of fallen rock and loose sand.
The grey weather had brought on the dark prematurely, and in the
half-light it seemed that this ravine was blocked by an unscalable
mass of rock. Here Old Bill whistled, and there was a reply from
above. Round the corner of the mass came Dougal.</p>

<p>"Up here," he commanded. "It was Mr. Heritage that fund this
road."</p>

<p>Dickson and his guide squeezed themselves between the mass and
the cliff up a spout of stones, and found themselves in an upper
storey of the gulley, very steep but practicable even for one
who was no cragsman. This in turn ran out against a wall up which
there led only a narrow chimney. At the foot of this were two
of the Die-Hards, and there were others above, for a rope hung
down by the aid of which a package was even now ascending.</p>

<p>"That's the top," said Dougal, pointing to the rim of sky, "and
that's the last o' the supplies." Dickson noticed that he spoke
in a whisper, and that all the movements of the Die-Hards were
judicious and stealthy. "Now, it's your turn. Take a good grip
o' the rope, and ye'll find plenty holes for your feet. It's no
more than ten yards and ye're well held above."</p>

<p>Dickson made the attempt and found it easier than he expected.
The only trouble was his pack and waterproof, which had a tendency
to catch on jags of rock. A hand was reached out to him, he was
pulled over the edge, and then pushed down on his face.</p>

<p>When he lifted his head Dougal and the others had joined him
and the whole company of the Die-Hards was assembled on a patch
of grass which was concealed from the landward view by a thicket
of hazels. Another, whom he recognised as Heritage, was coiling
up the rope.</p>

<p>"We'd better get all the stuff into the old Tower for the present,"
Heritage was saying. "It's too risky to move it into the House
now. We'll need the thickest darkness for that, after the moon
is down. Quick, for the beastly thing will be rising soon and
before that we must all be indoors."</p>

<p>Then he turned to Dickson, and gripped his hand. "You're a high
class of sportsman, Dogson. And I think you're just in time."</p>

<p>"Are they due to-night?" Dickson asked in an excited whisper,
faint against the wind.</p>

<p>"I don't know about They. But I've got a notion that some devilish
queer things will happen before to-morrow morning."</p>
