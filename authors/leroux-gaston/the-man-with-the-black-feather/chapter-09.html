<p>It would seem that the Destiny which rules mankind takes a detestable
pleasure in making the most serene joys come before the worst
catastrophes. Never had the three friends enjoyed a dinner more
than the dinner which they had that night at the caf√© Des Trois
Etoiles. They dined well, the coffee was excellent, and the cigars
which Adolphe had brought with him, and the Russian cigarettes
which Marceline smoked, were excellent too. They lingered talking
together for a long while after dinner; and their talk, which,
under the guidance of Adolphe, never wandered far from the sphere
of the occult which now so practically concerned them, was interesting
and fascinating, in spite of the fact that that inveterate Parisian
Theophrastus would now and again jest about his dangerous plight.
At half-past ten they left the restaurant and walked back to the
flat in Gerando Street. Adolphe bade them good-night at the bottom
of the stairs.</p>

<p>That flat consisted of a narrow hall, nearly filled, and certainly
cramped, by a chest of polished oak. Into this hall four doors
opened, those of the kitchen and dining-room on the left, those
of the drawing-room and bedroom, which looked out on to the street,
on the right. There was a third window looking out on to the street,
that of the tiny room which Theophrastus had made his study. <em>This
study had two doors; one of them opened into the bedroom, the
other into the dining-room.</em> In this study was a bureau against
the wall; and in it were drawers above and below its writing-table.
This writing-table let down and shut up, and was fastened by a
somewhat elaborate lock at the edge of the bureau's top. When
it was locked, all the drawers were locked too. As a rule, Theophrastus
used to set a little violet cat on the keyhole of the lock, as
much to hide it as for ornament.</p>

<p>This little violet cat, which had glass eyes, was nothing but
an ingenious silk ball which acted as a pen-wiper and pin-cushion.
About four feet away from the desk was a very small <em>tea-table</em>.</p>

<p>On entering their flat, Theophrastus and Marceline, as was their
custom, made a careful search in every room for a hidden burglar.
Having, as usual, failed to find one, (Heaven alone knows what
they would have done with him if they had!) they went to bed with
their minds at ease. As the more timid of the two, Theophrastus
slept next the wall. They were soon asleep, Theophrastus snoring
gently.</p>

<p>Night. Not a carriage in the street. Silence.</p>

<p>The snoring of Theophrastus ceased. Was it that he had sunk into
a deeper sleep? No: he sleeps no more. His throat is dry; he stares
into the darkness with affrighted eyes; he grips with a cold hand,
a hand which fear is freezing, the shoulder of Marceline and awakens
her.</p>

<p>He says in a low voice, so low that she does not even hear him,
"Do you hear?"</p>

<p>Marceline holds her breath; she clutches her husband's icy hand.
They strain their ears; and they undoubtedly do hear something&mdash;<em>in
the flat</em>.</p>

<p>In very truth it is nothing to laugh at. The man who can laugh
at an inexplicable noise, at night, <em>in a flat</em>, has not
yet been born! There are brave men, splendidly brave, who will
stick at nothing, who will go anywhere at night, into the emptiest
streets of the most disreputable quarters, who would not hesitate
to venture, just for the pleasure of it, into lampless blind alleys.
But I tell you, because it is the truth, and you know it is the
truth, that the man who can laugh at an inexplicable noise, at
night, <em>in a flat</em>, has not yet been born.</p>

<p>We have already seen Theophrastus sleepless on the night of the
revelation of the dreadful secret which sprang from the stones
of the Conciergerie. The anxiety which weighed on his heart that
night, terrible as it had been, was as nothing compared with that
which was now strangling him, because there was at night, <em>in
the flat</em>, an inexplicable noise.</p>

<p>It was truly an odd noise, but beyond all doubting real; it was
a long-drawn <em>pur-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r</em>. It came from
behind the wall of the next room.</p>

<p>They sat up in bed noiselessly, with bristling hair, and beads
of cold sweat standing out on their brows. From the other side
of the wall came the strange <em>pur-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r</em>. It
was the purring of a cat; they recognised that purring: it was
the purring of the little violet cat. Marceline slipped down under
the clothes and whispered:</p>

<p>"It's the purring of the violet cat. Go and see what's the matter
with it, Theophrastus."</p>

<p>Theophrastus did not budge; he would have given a hundred thousand
rubber stamps to be walking along the boulevard at mid-day.</p>

<p>"It's not natural that it should be purring like that," she added.
"Go and see what's the matter with it. You must, Theophrastus!
Get your revolver out of the drawer."</p>

<p>Theophrastus found the strength to say faintly, "You know quite
well that it's not loaded."</p>

<p>They listened again; the purring had ceased; Marceline began
to hope they had been mistaken. Then Theophrastus groaned, got
out of bed, took the revolver, and quietly opened the door leading
into his study. It was bright in a sheet of moonlight; and what
Theophrastus saw made him recoil with a dull cry, shut the door,
and set his back against it as if to bar what he saw from entering
the bedroom.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said Marceline hoarsely.</p>

<p>The teeth of Theophrastus chattered as he said, "It has stopped
purring; but it has moved!"</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"On the tea-table."</p>

<p>"The violet cat is on the tea-table?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure it was in its place last night?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure. I stuck my scarf-pin in its head. It was on the
bureau, as it always is."</p>

<p>"You must have imagined it. Suppose I lit the light?" said Marceline.</p>

<p>"No, no, we might escape in the darkness ... Suppose I went and
opened the door on to the landing, and called the porter?"</p>

<p>"Don't get so terrified," said Marceline, who was little by little
recovering her wits, since she no longer heard the violet cat.
"The whole thing was an illusion. You changed its place last night;
and it didn't purr."</p>

<p>"After all, it's quite possible," said Theophrastus, whose one
desire was to get back into bed.</p>

<p>"Go and put it back in its place," said Marceline.</p>

<p>Theophrastus braced himself to the effort, went into the study,
and with a swift and trembling hand took the cat from the tea-table,
set it back on the bureau, and hurried back into bed.</p>

<p>The violet cat was no sooner back on the bureau than he began
again his <em>pur-r-r-r-r-r-r-r</em>. That purring only made them
smile: they knew what had set it going. A quarter of an hour had
passed; they were almost asleep, when a second fright made them
spring up in bed. A third purring struck on their ears. If the
first purring had smitten them with terror, and the second made
them smile, the third purring frightened them out of their lives.</p>

<p>"It's impossible!" said Marceline in a chattering whisper. "We're
victims of an hallucination! <em>B-B-B-</em>Besides, it's n-n-not
really surprising after what happened to you at the Conciergerie!"</p>

<p>The purring once more ceased. This time it was Marceline who
rose. She opened the door of the study, turned sharply towards
Theophrastus, and said, but in what a faint and dying voice:</p>

<p>"You didn't put the violet cat back on the bureau!"</p>

<p>"But I did!" groaned Theophrastus.</p>

<p>"<em>But it's gone back to the tea-table!</em>"</p>

<p>"Good God!" cried poor Theophrastus; and he buried his head under
the bed-clothes.</p>

<p>The violet cat no longer purred. Marceline became persuaded that
in his perturbation her husband had left it on the tea-table.
She took it up, holding her breath, and set it back on the bureau.
The violet cat made its purring heard for the fourth time. Marceline
and Theophrastus heard it with the same equanimity with which
they had heard the second purring. The fourth purring stopped.</p>

<p>Another quarter of an hour passed: they were not asleep or even
sleepy; and then there came <em>a fifth purring</em>.</p>

<p>Then, incredible to relate, Theophrastus leapt from the bed like
a tiger, and cried:</p>

<p>"<em>By the throttle of Madame Phalaris!</em> This is too much
of a good thing! What the deuce is that infernal violet cat up
to?"</p>
