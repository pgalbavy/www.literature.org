<p><strong>(CONTINUED)</strong>
</p>
<p>The pier was not far distant from the house in which Joanna lay; it now
only remained to get the men on shore, to surround the house with a
strong party, burst in the door and carry off the captive. They might
then regard themselves as done with the <u>Good Hope</u>; it had placed them
on the rear of their enemies; and the retreat, whether they should
succeed or fail in the main enterprise, would be directed with a greater
measure of hope in the direction of the forest and my Lord Foxham's
reserve.
</p><p>To get the men on shore, however, was no easy task; many had been sick,
all were pierced with cold; the promiscuity and disorder on board had
shaken their discipline; the movement of the ship and the darkness of
the night had cowed their spirits. They made a rush upon the pier; my
lord, with his sword drawn on his own retainers, must throw himself in
front; and this impulse of rabblement was not restrained without a
certain clamour of voices, highly to be regretted in the case.
</p><p>When some degree of order had been restored, Dick, with a few chosen
men, set forth in advance. The darkness on shore, by contrast with the
flashing of the surf, appeared before him like a solid body; and the
howling and whistling of the gale drowned any lesser noise.
</p><p>He had scarce reached the end of the pier, however, when there fell a
lull of the wind; and in this he seemed to hear on shore the hollow
footing of horses and the clash of arms. Checking his immediate
followers, he passed forward a step or two alone, even setting foot upon
the down; and here he made sure he could detect the shape of men and
horses moving. A strong discouragement assailed him. If their enemies
were really on the watch, if they had beleaguered the shoreward end of
the pier, he and Lord Foxham were taken in a posture of very poor
defence, the sea behind, the men jostled in the dark upon a narrow
causeway. He gave a cautious whistle, the signal previously agreed upon.
</p><p>It proved to be a signal far more than he desired. Instantly there fell,
through the black night, a shower of arrows sent at a venture; and so
close were the men huddled on the pier that more than one was hit, and
the arrows were answered with cries of both fear and pain. In this first
discharge, Lord Foxham was struck down; Hawksley had him carried on
board again at once; and his men, during the brief remainder of the
skirmish, fought (when they fought at all) without guidance. That was
perhaps the chief cause of the disaster which made haste to follow.
</p><p>At the shore end of the pier, for perhaps a minute, Dick held his own
with a handful; one or two were wounded upon either side; steel crossed
steel; nor had there been the least signal of advantage, when in the
twinkling of an eye the tide turned against the party from the ship.
Some one cried out that all was lost; the men were in the very humour
to lend an ear to a discomfortable counsel; the cry was taken up. "On
board, lads, for your lives!" cried another. A third, with the true
instinct of the coward, raised that inevitable report on all retreats:
"We are betrayed!" And in a moment the whole mass of men went surging
and jostling backward down the pier, turning their defenceless backs on
their pursuers and piercing the night with craven outcry.
</p><p>One coward thrust off the ship's stern, while another still held her by
the bows. The fugitives leaped, screaming, and were hauled on board, or
fell back and perished in the sea. Some were cut down upon the pier by
the pursuers. Many were injured on the ship's deck in the blind haste
and terror of the moment, one man leaping upon another, and a third on
both. At last, and whether by design or accident, the bows of the <u>Good
Hope</u> were liberated; and the ever-ready Lawless, who had maintained his
place at the helm through all the hurly-burly by sheer strength of body
and a liberal use of the cold steel, instantly clapped her on the proper
tack. The ship began to move once more forward on the stormy sea, its
scuppers running blood, its deck heaped with fallen men, sprawling and
struggling in the dark.
</p><p>Thereupon, Lawless sheathed his dagger, and turning to his next
neighbour, "I have left my mark on them, gossip," said he, "the yelping,
coward hounds."
</p><p>Now, while they were all leaping and struggling for their lives, the men
had not appeared to observe the rough shoves and cutting stabs with
which Lawless had held his post in the confusion. But perhaps they had
already begun to understand somewhat more clearly, or perhaps another
ear had overheard, the helmsman's speech.
</p><p>Panic-stricken troops recover slowly, and men who have just disgraced
themselves by cowardice, as if to wipe out the memory of their fault,
will sometimes run straight into the opposite extreme of
insubordination. So it was now; and the same men who had thrown away
their weapons and been hauled, feet-foremost, into the <u>Good Hope</u>,
began to cry out upon their leaders, and demand that some one should be
punished.
</p><p>This growing ill-feeling turned upon Lawless.
</p><p>In order to get a proper offing, the old outlaw had put the head of the
<u>Good Hope</u> to seaward.
</p><p>"What!" bawled one of the grumblers, "he carrieth us to seaward!"
</p><p>"'Tis sooth," cried another. "Nay, we are betrayed for sure."
</p><p>And they all began to cry out in chorus that they were betrayed, and in
shrill tones and with abominable oaths bade Lawless go about-ship and
bring them speedily ashore. Lawless, grinding his teeth, continued in
silence to steer the true course, guiding the <u>Good Hope</u> among the
formidable billows. To their empty terrors, as to their dishonourable
threats, between drink and dignity he scorned to make reply. The
malcontents drew together a little abaft the mast, and it was plain they
were like barnyard cocks, "crowing for courage." Presently they would be
fit for any extremity of injustice or ingratitude. Dick began to mount
by the ladder, eager to interpose; but one of the outlaws, who was also
something of a seaman, got beforehand.
</p><p>"Lads," he began, "y'are right wooden heads, I think. For to get back,
by the mass, we must have an offing, must we not? And this old
Lawless----"
</p><p>Some one struck the speaker on the mouth, and the next moment, as a fire
springs among dry straw, he was felled upon the deck, trampled under the
feet, and despatched by the daggers of his cowardly companions. At this
the wrath of Lawless rose and broke.
</p><p>"Steer yourselves," he bellowed, with a curse; and, careless of the
result, he left the helm.
</p><p>The <u>Good Hope</u> was, at that moment, trembling on the summit of a swell.
She subsided, with sickening velocity, upon the farther side. A wave,
like a great black bulwark, hove immediately in front of her; and, with
a staggering blow, she plunged head-foremost through that liquid hill.
The green water passed right over her from stem to stern, as high as a
man's knees; the sprays ran higher than the mast; and she rose again
upon the other side, with an appalling, tremulous indecision, like a
beast that has been deadly wounded.
</p><p>Six or seven of the malcontents had been carried bodily overboard; and
as for the remainder, when they found their tongues again, it was to
bellow to the saints and wail upon Lawless to come back and take the
tiller.
</p><p>Nor did Lawless wait to be twice bidden. The terrible result of his
fling of just resentment sobered him completely. He knew, better than
any one on board, how nearly the <u>Good Hope</u> had gone bodily down below
their feet; and he could tell, by the laziness with which she met the
sea, that the peril was by no means over.
</p><p>Dick, who had been thrown down by the concussion and half drowned, rose
wading to his knees in the swamped well of the stern, and crept to the
old helmsman's side.
</p><p>"Lawless," he said, "we do all depend on you; y'are a brave, steady man,
indeed, and crafty in the management of ships; I shall put three sure
men to watch upon your safety."
</p><p>"Bootless, my master, bootless," said the steersman, peering forward
through the dark. "We come every moment somewhat clearer of these
sand-banks; with every moment, then, the sea packeth upon us heavier,
and for all these whimperers, they will presently be on their backs.
For, my master, 'tis a right mystery, but true, there never yet was a
bad man that was a good shipman. None but the honest and the bold can
endure me this tossing of a ship."
</p><p>"Nay, Lawless," said Dick, laughing, "that is a right shipman's by-word,
and hath no more of sense than the whistle of the wind. But, prithee,
how go we? Do we lie well? Are we in good case?"
</p><p>"Master Shelton," replied Lawless, "I have been a Grey Friar--I praise
fortune--an archer, a thief, and a shipman. Of all these coats, I had
the best fancy to die in the Grey Friar's, as ye may readily conceive,
and the least fancy to die in John Shipman's tarry jacket; and that for
two excellent good reasons: first, that the death might take a man
suddenly; and second, for the horror of that great, salt smother and
welter under my foot here"--and Lawless stamped with his foot.
"Howbeit," he went on, "an I die not a sailor's death, and that this
night, I shall owe a tall candle to our Lady."
</p><p>"Is it so?" asked Dick.
</p><p>"It is right so," replied the outlaw. "Do ye not feel how heavy and dull
she moves upon the waves? Do ye not hear the water washing in her hold?
She will scarce mind the rudder even now. Bide till she has settled a
bit lower; and she will either go down below your boots like a stone
image, or drive ashore here, under our lee, and come all to pieces like
a twist of string."
</p><p>"Ye speak with a good courage," returned Dick. "Ye are not then
appalled?"
</p><p>"Why, master," answered Lawless, "if ever a man had an ill crew to come
to port with, it is I--a renegade friar, a thief, and all the rest on't.
Well, ye may wonder, but I keep a good hope in my wallet; and if that I
be to drown, I will drown with a bright eye, Master Shelton, and a
steady hand."
</p><p>Dick returned no answer; but he was surprised to find the old vagabond
of so resolute a temper, and fearing some fresh violence or treachery,
set forth upon his quest for three sure men. The great bulk of the men
had now deserted the deck, which was continually wetted with the flying
sprays, and where they lay exposed to the shrewdness of the winter wind.
They had gathered, instead, into the hold of the merchandise, among the
butts of wine, and lighted by two swinging lanterns.
</p><p>Here a few kept up the form of revelry, and toasted each other deep in
Arblaster's Gascony wine. But as the <u>Good Hope</u> continued to tear
through the smoking waves, and toss her stem and stern alternately high
in air and deep into white foam, the number of these jolly companions
diminished with every moment and with every lurch. Many sat apart,
tending their hurts, but the majority were already prostrated with
sickness, and lay moaning in the bilge.
</p><p>Greensheve, Cuckow, and a young fellow of Lord Foxham's whom Dick had
already remarked for his intelligence and spirit, were still, however,
both fit to understand and willing to obey. These Dick set, as a
body-guard, about the person of the steersman, and then, with a last
look at the black sky and sea, he turned and went below into the cabin,
whither Lord Foxham had been carried by his servants.
