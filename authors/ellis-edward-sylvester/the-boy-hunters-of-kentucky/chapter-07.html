<p>No one could have won the wrestling bout more fairly than did
Jack Gedney, who, having thrown the young Wyandot by the usual
side hold, had now tossed him over his head with such violence
that the youthful redskin must have made a big dent in the earth
where his crown struck it.</p>

<p>The victor was startled for a moment by the fear that he had
seriously injured his opponent, and, running forward, he stooped
over him.</p>

<p>"Is Arowaka hurt?  I am sorry," he said, kindly. "I did not really
mean to do it."</p>

<p>But the latter was on his feet like a flash, thus proving the
toughness of his race.  He was so angered that his small black
eyes flashed fire. No doubt he ranked as a skilful wrestler among
his own people, and he was chagrined beyond bearing by his defeat.</p>

<p>Grasping the handle of his knife, he drew it forth with the intention
of rushing upon Jack; but before he could do so the chieftain,
Hua-awa-oma, took part in the proceedings.</p>

<p>You know that the American Indians show little indulgence to
their children, whom they rear much as wild animals rear their
young.  They are made to suffer hardships while infants that would
prove fatal to you or me when double their age.  The doctrine
of forbearance, kindness, and patience, is unknown among those
peculiar people.</p>

<p>The chief had watched the contest between his heir and the white
boy, who was not as tall by several inches as the other.  He had
seen Arowaka beaten as if he were a child in the grasp of a giant. 
The chief was furious.  Arowaka was in the very act of drawing
his knife when his father seized one of his arms, and began belabouring
him with his long bow, which he had caught up with the other hand.</p>

<p>Jack Gedney was so amazed for a few seconds that he could only
stare in silence.  Then he was pleased, for the son deserved his
punishment, not because he was overthrown, but because he drew
his knife upon the one who had fairly conquered him.  In the midst
of the odd scene Jack Gedney awoke to the fact that his darling
rifle was leaning against the very tree where he first placed
it for Arowaka to view.  The chief and his son were closer to
it than Jack, and the latter dared not make a rush to recover
it while the Indian was in such a furious mood, but he stealthily
edged that way, in the hope of getting near enough to seize it
before the Wyandot could prevent him.</p>

<p>But Jack was disappointed.  Such a severe punishment as the chieftain
gave to his son could not, in the nature of things, last long. 
Probably a score of blows descended on the back and limbs of Arowaka
when they ceased.  The chief gave the youth an angry shove, as
though he was ashamed of him, and then, turning about, he took
a few quick paces and snatched up the gun.</p>

<p>As he seized the weapon, the Wyandot, without glancing at his
disgraced son, who stood sullenly apart, looking askance at the
scene, walked straight to Jack and handed it to him.</p>

<p>"Take him&mdash;brave boy&mdash;make great warrior &mdash;Hua-awa-oma love
Jack."</p>

<p>Doubting the earnestness of the chief, the youth reached out
his hand, expecting the weapon to be withdrawn as before; but
it was not; and a thrill of delight passed through the lad when
he felt that his rifle was once more in his own possession.</p>

<p>"Huo-awa-oma, I thank you; you speak with a single tongue; you
are a brave warrior; you have spoken truth; we are friends for
ever."</p>

<p>The Wyandot made no response to this, but turning his back alike
on white and red boy, he strode angrily off in the woods, taking
a direction that led him towards the clearing where stood the
cabin in which Jack Gedney was born.</p>

<p>Hua-awa-oma had gone only a couple of rods when his son followed
him. He did not speak, but as he moved away he turned his head
for an instant and glanced at Jack.</p>

<p>What that look meant was beyond the power of the boy to guess,
but he believed it was a threat&mdash;a warning that he had not yet
finished with him.</p>

<p>However, Jack was not alarmed by the fierce glance of the dusky
youth. He was so delighted over the restoration of his rifle that
for a few minutes he could think of nothing else.</p>

<p>Making his way back to the trail, he resumed his walk towards
the home of the Burton boys, who he knew were already impatient
over his delay.</p>

<p>"It’s very strange," he said, recalling the incidents that have
just been described; "I don’t believe that one Indian in a thousand
would have kept his word like Hua-awa-oma.  Having got hold of
my gun, he would not have let go; but I suspect, after all, the
chief is not such an honourable fellow as he seems to be from
his actions.  If Arowaka had made a better fight, even though
I beat him, his father would have let him have the gun; but I
threw him so easily that the chief was maddened, and he gave the
gun back to me more because he was angry with his son than because
of his promise to me."</p>

<p>I must say that this conclusion of Jack Gedney was worthy of
one much older than he.  You may think he showed an amazing amount
of wisdom for a lad so young, but bear in mind that he was not
only a bright boy, but he had the training that gave him a knowledge
of the woods often denied to those of his years.</p>

<p>The presence of the two Indians in this neighbourhood could not
fail to set Jack to thinking what it meant.  The Wyandots were
among those who had fought the white settlers with intense fierceness.
Some of their leaders were the most daring and skilful of the
combined tribes, and the warriors were as brave and treacherous
as the Apaches of the present time.</p>

<p>The natural question that Jack asked himself was as to the meaning
of the presence of this chief and his son so near to the settlement
and the few scattered cabins of that section.  One alarming fact
could not be lost sight of: during the past summer and early autumn
the Indians had been unusually hostile.</p>

<p>Some weeks before, Mr. Gedney was on the point of moving with
his family to the settlement until the trouble should pass; but
he disliked leaving the cabin and all the gains he had made since
coming to the West.  About that time, however, came news that
drove away his fears, and he decided to stay, at least until more
alarming tidings should reach him.</p>

<p>The thought that naturally came to Jack was that a chief generally
had a number of warriors within call, and since they were Wyandots
they were hostile to the whites, who were trying to take their
hunting-grounds away from them.  The chief himself had shown a
friendship towards Jack which he might extend to his relatives,
but of course that was mere guesswork.</p>

<p>While the boy found plenty of cause for serious thought, he took
comfort in his faith in the bravery and address of his father. 
He had been through some of the most thrilling scenes on the frontier,
and in all he had carried himself so as to win the praise of every
one.</p>

<p>So it was natural, as you will see, that, though Jack was disturbed
by his fears, he was able to find relief in his faith in his father.</p>

<p>"He knows all about Indians," said the youth to himself; "if
they mean anything wrong, he will find it out; they will never
be able to catch him asleep."</p>

<p>And with this conclusion the boy walked more briskly than before
along the trail over which he had journeyed so many times. </p>
