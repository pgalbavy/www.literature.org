<p>For modern China, the most important foreign nation is Japan.
In order to understand the part played by Japan, it is necessary
to know something of that country, to which we must now turn our
attention.</p>

<p>In reading the history of Japan, one of the most amazing things
is the persistence of the same forces and the same beliefs throughout
the centuries. Japanese history practically begins with a "Restoration"
by no means unlike that of 1867-8. Buddhism was introduced into
Japan from Korea in 552 <em>A.D.[40] </em>At the same time and
from the same source Chinese civilization became much better known
in Japan than it had been through the occasional intercourse of
former centuries. Both novelties won favour. Two Japanese students
(followed later by many others) went to China in 608 <em>A.D.,
</em>to master the civilization of that country. The Japanese
are an experimental nation, and before adopting Buddhism nationally
they ordered one or two prominent courtiers to adopt it, with
a view to seeing whether they prospered more or less than the
adherents of the traditional Shinto religion.[41] After some vicissitudes,
the experiment was held to have favoured the foreign religion,
which, as a Court religion, acquired more prestige than Shinto,
although the latter was never ousted, and remained the chief religion
of the peasantry until the thirteenth century. It is remarkable
to find that, as late as the sixteenth century, Hideyoshi, who
was of peasant origin, had a much higher opinion of "the way of
the gods" (which is what "Shinto" means) than of Buddhism.[42]
Probably the revival of Shinto in modern times was facilitated
by a continuing belief in that religion on the part of the less
noisy sections of the population. But so far as the people mentioned
in history are concerned, Buddhism plays a very much greater part
than Shinto.</p>

<p>The object of the Restoration in 1867-8 was, at any rate in part,
to restore the constitution of 645 <em>A.D. </em>The object of
the constitution of 645 <em>A.D. </em>was to restore the form
of government that had prevailed in the good old days. What the
object was of those who established the government of the good
old days, I do not profess to know. However that may be, the country
before 645 <em>A.D. </em>was given over to feudalism and internal
strife, while the power of the Mikado had sunk to a very low ebb.
The Mikado had had the civil power, but had allowed great feudatories
to acquire military control, so that the civil government fell
into contempt. Contact with the superior civilization of China
made intelligent people think that the Chinese constitution deserved
imitation, along with the Chinese morals and religion. The Chinese
Emperor was the Son of Heaven, so the Mikado came to be descended
from the Sun Goddess. The Chinese Emperor, whenever he happened
to be a vigorous man, was genuinely supreme, so the Mikado must
be made so.</p>

<p>The similarity of the influence of China in producing the Restoration
of 645 <em>A.D. </em>and that of Europe in producing the Restoration
of 1867-8 is set forth by Murdoch[43] as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
In the summer of 1863 a band of four Choshu youths were smuggled<br/>
on board a British steamer by the aid of kind Scottish friends<br/>
who sympathized with their endeavour to proceed to Europe for<br/>
purposes of study. These, friends possibly did not know that some<br/>
of the four had been protagonists in the burning down of the<br/>
British Legation on Gotenyama a few months before, and they<br/>
certainly could never have suspected that the real mission of the<br/>
four youths was to master the secrets of Western civilization<br/>
with a sole view of driving the Western barbarians from the<br/>
sacred soil of Japan. Prince Ito and Marquis Inouye&mdash;for they<br/>
were two of this venturesome quartette&mdash;have often told of their<br/>
rapid disillusionment when they reached London, and saw these<br/>
despised Western barbarians at home. On their return to Japan<br/>
they at once became the apostles of a new doctrine, and their<br/>
effective preaching has had much to do with the pride of place<br/>
Dai Nippon now holds among the Great Powers of the world.

</p>
</div>
<p>The two students who went to China in 608 <em>A.D. "</em>rendered
even more illustrious service to their country perhaps than Ito
and Inouye have done. For at the Revolution of 1868, the leaders
of the movement harked back to the 645-650 <em>A.D. </em>period
for a good deal of their inspiration, and the real men of political
knowledge at that time were the two National Doctors."</p>

<p>Politically, what was done in 645 <em>A.D. </em>and the period
immediately following was not unlike what was done in France by
Louis XI and Richelieu&mdash;curbing of the great nobles and an exaltation
of the sovereign, with a substitution of civil justice for military
anarchy. The movement was represented by its promoters as a Restoration,
probably with about the same amount of truth as in 1867. At the
latter date, there was restoration so far as the power of the
Mikado was concerned, but innovation as regards the introduction
of Western ideas. Similarly, in 645 <em>A.D., </em>what was done
about the Mikado was a return to the past, but what was done in
the way of spreading Chinese civilization was just the opposite.
There must have been, in both cases, the same curious mixture
of antiquarian and reforming tendencies.</p>

<p>Throughout subsequent Japanese history, until the Restoration,
one seems to see two opposite forces struggling for mastery over
people's minds, namely the ideas of government, civilization and
art derived from China on the one hand, and the native tendency
to feudalism, clan government, and civil war on the other. The
conflict is very analogous to that which went on in mediæval Europe
between the Church, which represented ideas derived from Rome,
and the turbulent barons, who were struggling to preserve the
way of life of the ancient Teutons. Henry IV at Canossa, Henry
II doing penance for Becket, represent the triumph of civilization
over rude vigour; and something similar is to be seen at intervals
in Japan.</p>

<p>After 645, the Mikado's Government had real power for some centuries,
but gradually it fell more and more under the sway of the soldiers.
So long as it had wealth (which lasted long after it ceased to
have power) it continued to represent what was most civilized
in Japan: the study of Chinese literature, the patronage of art,
and the attempt to preserve respect for something other than brute
force. But the Court nobles (who remained throughout quite distinct
from the military feudal chiefs) were so degenerate and feeble,
so stereotyped and unprogressive, that it would have been quite
impossible for the country to be governed by them and the system
they represented. In this respect they differed greatly from the
mediæval Church, which no one could accuse of lack of vigour,
although the vigour of the feudal aristocracy may have been even
greater. Accordingly, while the Church in Europe usually defeated
the secular princes, the exact opposite happened in Japan, where
the Mikado and his Court sank into greater and greater contempt
down to the time of the Restoration.</p>

<p>The Japanese have a curious passion for separating the real and
the nominal Governments, leaving the show to the latter and the
substance of power to the former. First the Emperors took to resigning
in favour of their infant sons, and continuing to govern in reality,
often from some monastery, where they had become monks. Then the
Shogun, who represented the military power, became supreme, but
still governed in the name of the Emperor. The word "Shogun" merely
means "General"; the full title of the people whom we call "Shogun"
is "Sei-i-Tai Shogun," which means "Barbarian-subduing great General";
the barbarians in question being the Ainus, the Japanese aborigines.
The first to hold this office in the form which it had at most
times until the Restoration was Minamoto Yoritomo, on whom the
title was conferred by the Mikado in 1192. But before long the
Shogun became nearly as much of a figure-head as the Mikado. Custom
confined the Shogunate to the Minamoto family, and the actual
power was wielded by Regents in the name of the Shogun. This lasted
until near the end of the sixteenth century, when it happened
that Iyeyasu, the supreme military commander of his day, belonged
to the Minamoto family, and was therefore able to assume the office
of Shogun himself. He and his descendants held the office until
it was abolished at the Restoration. The Restoration, however,
did not put an end to the practice of a real Government behind
the nominal one. The Prime Minister and his Cabinet are presented
to the world as the Japanese Government, but the real Government
is the Genro, or Elder Statesmen, and their successors, of whom
I shall have more to say in the next chapter.</p>

<p>What the Japanese made of Buddhism reminds one in many ways of
what the Teutonic nations made of Christianity. Buddhism and Christianity,
originally, were very similar in spirit. They were both religions
aiming at the achievement of holiness by renunciation of the world.
They both ignored politics and government and wealth, for which
they substituted the future life as what was of real importance.
They were both religions of peace, teaching gentleness and non-resistance.
But both had to undergo great transformations in adapting themselves
to the instincts of warlike barbarians. In Japan, a multitude
of sects arose, teaching doctrines which differed in many ways
from Mahayana orthodoxy. Buddhism became national and militaristic;
the abbots of great monasteries became important feudal chieftains,
whose monks constituted an army which was ready to fight on the
slightest provocation. Sieges of monasteries and battles with
monks are of constant occurrence in Japanese history.</p>

<p>The Japanese, as every one knows, decided, after about 100 years'
experience of Western missionaries and merchants, to close their
country completely to foreigners, with the exception of a very
restricted and closely supervised commerce with the Dutch. The
first arrival of the Portuguese in Japan was in or about the year
1543, and their final expulsion was in the year 1639. What happened
between these two dates is instructive for the understanding of
Japan. The first Portuguese brought with them Christianity and
fire-arms, of which the Japanese tolerated the former for the
sake of the latter. At that time there was virtually no Central
Government in the country, and the various Daimyo were engaged
in constant wars with each other. The south-western island, Kyushu,
was even more independent of such central authority as existed
than were the other parts of Japan, and it was in this island
(containing the port of Nagasaki) that the Portuguese first landed
and were throughout chiefly active. They traded from Macao, bringing
merchandise, match-locks and Jesuits, as well as artillery on
their larger vessels. It was found that they attached importance
to the spread of Christianity, and some of the Daimyo, in order
to get their trade and their guns, allowed themselves to be baptized
by the Jesuits. The Portuguese of those days seem to have been
genuinely more anxious to make converts than to extend their trade;
when, later on, the Japanese began to object to missionaries while
still desiring trade, neither the Portuguese nor the Spaniards
could be induced to refrain from helping the Fathers. However,
all might have gone well if the Portuguese had been able to retain
the monopoly which had been granted to them by a Papal Bull. Their
monopoly of trade was associated with a Jesuit monopoly of missionary
activity. But from 1592 onward, the Spaniards from Manila competed
with the Portuguese from Macao, and the Dominican and Franciscan
missionaries, brought by the Spaniards, competed with the Jesuit
missionaries brought by the Portuguese. They quarrelled furiously,
even at times when they were suffering persecution; and the Japanese
naturally believed the accusations that each side brought against
the other. Moreover, when they were shown maps displaying the
extent of the King of Spain's dominions, they became alarmed for
their national independence. In the year 1596, a Spanish ship,
the <em>San Felipe</em>, on its way from Manila to Acapulco, was
becalmed off the coast of Japan. The local Daimyo insisted on
sending men to tow it into his harbour, and gave them instructions
to run it aground on a sandbank, which they did. He thereupon
claimed the whole cargo, valued at 600,000 crowns. However, Hideyoshi,
who was rapidly acquiring supreme power in Japan, thought this
too large a windfall for a private citizen, and had the Spanish
pilot interviewed by a man named Masuda. The pilot, after trying
reason in vain, attempted intimidation.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
He produced a map of the world, and on it pointed out the vast<br/>
extent of the dominions of Philip <em>II. </em>Thereupon Masuda asked him<br/>
how it was so many countries had been brought to acknowledge the<br/>
sway of a single man.... "Our Kings," said this outspoken seaman,<br/>
"begin by sending into the countries they wish to conquer<br/>
<em>religieux</em> who induce the people to embrace our religion, and<br/>
when they have made considerable progress, troops are sent who<br/>
combine with the new Christians, and then our Kings have not<br/>
much trouble in accomplishing the rest."[44]

</p>
</div>
<p>As Spain and Portugal were at this time both subject to Philip
II, the Portuguese also suffered from the suspicions engendered
by this speech. Moreover, the Dutch, who were at war with Spain,
began to trade with Japan, and to tell all they knew against Jesuits,
Dominicans, Franciscans, and Papists generally. A breezy Elizabethan
sea captain, Will Adams, was wrecked in Japan, and on being interrogated
naturally gave a good British account of the authors of the Armada.
As the Japanese had by this time mastered the use and manufacture
of fire-arms, they began to think that they had nothing more to
learn from Christian nations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a succession of three great men &mdash;Nobunaga, Hideyoshi,
and Iyeyasu&mdash;had succeeded in unifying Japan, destroying the quasi-independence
of the feudal nobles, and establishing that reign of internal
peace which lasted until the Restoration&mdash;period of nearly two
and a half centuries. It was possible, therefore, for the Central
Government to enforce whatever policy it chose to adopt with regard
to the foreigners and their religion. The Jesuits and the Friars
between them had made a considerable number of converts in Japan,
probably about 300,000. Most of these were in the island of Kyushu,
the last region to be subdued by Hideyoshi. They tended to disloyalty,
not only on account of their Christianity, but also on account
of their geographical position. It was in this region that the
revolt against the Shogun began in 1867, and Satsuma, the chief
clan in the island of Kyushu, has had great power in the Government
ever since the Restoration, except during its rebellion of 1877.
It is hard to disentangle what belongs to Christianity and what
to mere hostility to the Central Government in the movements of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. However that may be,
Iyeyasu decided to persecute the Christians vigorously, if possible
without losing the foreign trade. His successors were even more
anti-Christian and less anxious for trade. After an abortive revolt
in 1637, Christianity was stamped out, and foreign trade was prohibited
in the most vigorous terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
So long as the sun warms the earth, let no Christian be so bold<br/>
as to come to Japan, and let all know that if King Philip<br/>
himself, or even the very God of the Christians, or the great<br/>
Shaka contravene this prohibition, they shall pay for it with<br/>
their heads.[45]

</p>
</div>
<p>The persecution of Christians, though it was ruthless and exceedingly
cruel, was due, not to religious intolerance, but solely to political
motives. There was reason to fear that the Christians might side
with the King of Spain if he should attempt to conquer Japan;
and even if no foreign power intervened, there was reason to fear
rebellions of Christians against the newly established central
power. Economic exploitation, in the modern sense of the word,
did not yet exist apart from political domination, and the Japanese
would have welcomed trade if there had been no danger of conquest.
They seem to have overrated the power of Spain, which certainly
could not have conquered them. Japanese armies were, in those
days, far larger than the armies of Europe; the Japanese had learnt
the use of fire-arms; and their knowledge of strategy was very
great. Kyoto, the capital, was one of the largest cities in the
world, having about a million inhabitants. The population of Japan
was probably greater than that of any European State. It would
therefore have been possible, without much trouble, to resist
any expedition that Europe could have sent against Japan. It would
even have been easy to conquer Manila, as Hideyoshi at one time
thought of doing. But we can well understand how terrifying would
be a map of the world showing the whole of North and South America
as belonging to Philip <em>II. </em>Moreover the Japanese Government
sent pretended converts to Europe, where they became priests,
had audience of the Pope, penetrated into the inmost councils
of Spain, and mastered all the meditated villainies of European
Imperialism. These spies, when they came home and laid their reports
before the Government, naturally increased its fears. The Japanese,
therefore, decided to have no further intercourse with the white
men. And whatever may be said against this policy, I cannot feel
convinced that it was unwise.</p>

<p>For over two hundred years, until the coming of Commodore Perry's
squadron from the United States in 1853, Japan enjoyed complete
peace and almost complete stagnation&mdash;the only period of either
in Japanese history, It then became necessary to learn fresh lessons
in the use of fire-arms from Western nations, and to abandon the
exclusive policy until they were learnt. When they have been learnt,
perhaps we shall see another period of isolation.</p>
