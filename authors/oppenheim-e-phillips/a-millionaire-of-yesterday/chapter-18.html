Dinner at the Lodge that night was not a very  lively affair.  Trent
had great matters in his brain and was not in the least disposed to
make conversation for the sake of his unbidden guests.  Da Souza's
few remarks he treated with silent contempt, and Mrs. Da Souza he
answered only in monosyllables.  Julie, nervous and depressed, stole
away before dessert, and Mrs. Da Souza soon followed her, very
massive, and frowning with an air of offended dignity.  Da Souza,
who opened the door for them, returned to his seat, moodily flicking
the crumbs from his trousers with his serviette.
<P>
"Hang it all, Trent," he remarked in an aggrieved tone, "you might
be a bit more amiable!  Nice lively dinner for the women I must say."
<P>
"One isn't usually amiable to guests who stay when they're not
asked," Trent answered gruffly.  "However, if I hadn't much to say
to your wife and daughter, I have a word or two to say to you, so
fill up your glass and listen."
<P>
Da Souza obeyed, but without heartiness.  He stretched himself out
in his chair and looked down thoughtfully at the large expanse of
shirt-front, in the centre of which flashed an enormous diamond.
<P>
"I've been into the City to-day as you know," Trent continued, "and
I found as I expected that you have been making efforts to dispose
of your share in the Bekwando Syndicate."
<P>
"I can assure you - "
<P>
"Oh rot!" Trent interrupted.  "I know what I'm talking about.  I
won't have you sell out.  Do you hear?  If you try it on I'll queer
the market for you at any risk.  I won't marry your daughter, I
won't be blackmailed, and I won't be bullied.  We're in this
together, sink or swim.  If you pull me down you've got to come too.
I'll admit that if Monty were to present himself in London to-morrow
and demand his full pound of flesh we should be ruined, but he isn't
going to do it.  By your own showing there is no immediate risk, and
you've got to leave the thing in my hands to do what I think best.
If you play any hanky-panky tricks - look here, Da Souza, I'll kill
you, sure!  Do you hear?  I could do it, and no one would be the
wiser so far as I was concerned.  You take notice of what I say, Da
Souza.  You've made a fortune, and be satisfied.  That's all!"
<P>
"You won't marry Julie, then?" Da Souza said gloomily.
<P>
"No, I'm shot if I will!" Trent answered.  "And look here, Da Souza,
I'm leaving here for town to-morrow - taken a furnished flat in
Dover Street - you can stay here if you want, but there'll only be
a caretaker in the place.  That's all I've got to say.  Make yourself
at home with the port and cigars.  Last night, you know!  You'll
excuse me!  I want a breath of fresh air."
<P>
Trent strolled through the open window into the garden, and breathed
a deep sigh of relief.  He was a free man again now.  He had created
new dangers - a new enemy to face - but what did he care?  All his
life had been spent in facing dangers and conquering enemies.  What
he had done before he could do again!  As he lit a pipe and walked
to and fro, he felt that this new state of things lent a certain
savour to life - took from it a certain sensation of finality not
altogether agreeable, which his recent great achievements in the
financial world seemed to have inspired.  After all, what could
Da Souza do?  His prosperity was altogether bound up in the success
of the Bekwando Syndicate - he was never the man to kill the goose
which was laying such a magnificent stock of golden eggs.  The
affair, so far as he was concerned, troubled him scarcely at all
on cool reflection.  As he drew near the little plantation he even
forgot all about it.  Something else was filling his thoughts!
<P>
The change in him became physical as well as mental.  The hard face
of the man softened, what there was of coarseness in its rugged
outline became altogether toned down.  He pushed open the gate with
fingers which were almost reverent; he came at last to a halt in
the exact spot where he had seen her first.  Perhaps it was at that
moment he realised most completely and clearly the curious thing
which had come to him - to him of all men, hard-hearted, material,
an utter stranger in the world of feminine things.  With a pleasant
sense of self-abandonment he groped about, searching for its
meaning.  He was a man who liked to understand thoroughly everything
he saw and felt, and this new atmosphere in which he found himself
was a curious source of excitement to him.  Only he knew that the
central figure of it all was this girl, that he had come out here
to think about her, and that henceforth she had become to him the
standard of those things which were worth having in life.  Everything
about her had been a revelation to him.  The women whom he had come
across in his battle upwards, barmaids and their fellows, fifth-rate
actresses, occasionally the suburban wife of a prosperous City man,
had impressed him only with a sort of coarse contempt.  It was
marvellous how thoroughly and clearly he had recognised Ernestine
at once as a type of that other world of womenkind, of which he
admittedly knew nothing.  Yet it was so short a time since she had
wandered into his life, so short a time that he was even a little
uneasy at the wonderful strength of this new passion, a thing which
had leaped up like a forest tree in a world of magic, a live,
fully-grown thing, mighty and immovable in a single night.  He
found himself thinking of all the other things in life from a
changed standpoint.  His sense of proportions was altered, his
financial triumphs were no longer omnipotent.  He was inclined even
to brush them aside, to consider them more as an incident in his
career.  He associated her now with all those plans concerning the
future which he had been dimly formulating since the climax of his
successes had come.  She was of the world which he sought to enter
 - at once the stimulus and the object of his desires.  He forgot
all about Da Souza and his threats, about the broken-down,
half-witted old man who was gazing with wistful eyes across the
ocean which kept him there, an exile - he remembered nothing save
the wonderful, new thing which had come into his life.  A month ago
he would have scoffed at the idea of there being anything worth
considering outside the courts and alleys of the money-changers'
market.  To-night he knew of other things.  To-night he knew that
all he had done so far was as nothing - that as yet his foot was
planted only on the threshold of life, and in the path along which
he must hew his way lay many fresh worlds to conquer.  To-night he
told himself that he was equal to them all.  There was something
out here in the dim moonlight, something suggested by the shadows,
the rose-perfumed air, the delicate and languid stillness, which
crept into his veins and coursed through his blood like magic.

Yet every now and then the same thought came; it lay like a small
but threatening black shadow across all those brilliant hopes and
dreams which were filling his brain.  So far he had played the game
of life as a hard man, perhaps, and a selfish one, but always
honestly.  Now, for the first time, he had stepped aside from the
beaten track.  He told himself that he was not bound to believe Da
Souza's story, that he had left Monty with the honest conviction
that he was past all human help.  Yet he knew that such consolation
was the merest sophistry.  Through the twilight, as he passed to
and fro, he fancied more than once that the wan face of an old man,
with wistful, sorrowing eyes, was floating somewhere before him
 - and he stopped to listen with bated breath to the wind rustling
in the elm-trees, fancying he could bear that same passionate cry
ringing still in his ears - the cry of an old man parted from his
kin and waiting for death in a lonely land.
