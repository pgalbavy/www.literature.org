<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Young Shotwell, still too incredulous to be either hurt or angry,
stood watching Palla welcoming her guests, who arrived within
a few minutes of each other.</p>

<p>First came Estridge,&mdash;handsome, athletic, standing over six feet,
and already possessed of that winning and reassuring manner which
means success for a physician.</p>

<p>"It's nice of you to ask me, Palla," he said. "And is Miss Westgard
really coming to-night?"</p>

<p>"But here she is now!" exclaimed Palla, as the maid announced
her. " &mdash;Ilse! You astonishing girl! How long have you been
in New York?"</p>

<p>And Shotwell beheld the six-foot goddess for the first time&mdash;gazed
with pleasurable awe upon this young super-creature with the sea-blue
eyes and golden hair and a skin of roses and cream.</p>

<p>"Fancy, Palla!" she said, "I came immediately back from Stockholm,
but you had sailed on the <em>Elsinore</em>, and I was obliged
to wait! &mdash;Oh!&mdash;" catching sight of Estridge as he advanced&mdash;"I
am so very happy to see you again!"&mdash;giving him her big, exquisitely
sculptured hand. "Except for Mr. Brisson, we are quite complete
in our little company of death!" She laughed her healthy, undisturbed
defiance of that human enemy as she named him, gazed rapturously
at Palla, acknowledged Shotwell's presentation in her hearty,
engaging way, then turned laughingly to Estridge:</p>

<p>"The world whirls like a wheel in a squirrel cage which we all
tread:&mdash;only to find ourselves together after travelling many,
many miles at top speed!... Are you well, John Estridge?"</p>

<p>"Fairly," he laughed, "but nobody except the immortals could
ever be as well as you, Ilse Westgard!"</p>

<p>She laughed in sheer exuberance of her own physical vigour: "Only
that old and toothless nemesis of Loki can slay me, John Estridge!"
And, to Palla: "I had some slight trouble in Stockholm. Fancy!&mdash;a
little shrimp of a man approached me on the street one evening
when there chanced to be nobody near.</p>

<p>"And the first I knew he was mouthing and grinning and saying
to me in Russian: 'I know you, hired mercenary of the aristocrats!
&mdash;I know you!&mdash;big white battle horse that carried the bloody
war-god!'</p>

<p>"I was too astonished, my dear; I merely gazed upon this small
and agitated toad, who continued to run alongside and grimace
and pull funny faces at me. He appeared to be furious, and he
said some very vile things to me.</p>

<p>"I was disgusted and walked faster, and he had to run. And all
the while he was squealing at me: 'I know you! You keep out of
America, do you hear? If you sail on that steamer, we follow you
and kill you! You hear it what I say? We kill! Kill! Kill!&#11834;'"</p>

<p>She threw up her superb head and laughed:</p>

<p>"Can you see him&mdash;this insect &mdash;Palla!&mdash;so small and hairy,
with crazy eyes like little sparks among the furry whiskers!&mdash;and
running, running at heel, underfoot, one side and then the other,
and squealing 'Kill! Kill? Kill'&#11834;"</p>

<p>She had made them see the picture and they all laughed.</p>

<p>"But all the same," she added, turning to Estridge, "from that
evening I became conscious that people were watching me.</p>

<p>"It was the same in Copenhagen and in Christiania&mdash;always I felt
that somebody was watching me."</p>

<p>"Did you have any trouble?" asked Estridge.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;there seemed to be so many unaccountable delays, obstacles
in securing proper papers, trouble about luggage and steamer accommodations&mdash;petty
annoyances," she added. "And also I am sure that letters to me
were opened, and others which I should have received never arrived."</p>

<p>"You believe it was due to the Reds?" asked Palla. "Have they
emissaries in Scandinavia?"</p>

<p>"My dear, their agents and spies swarm everywhere over the world!"
said Ilse calmly.</p>

<p>"Not here," remarked Shotwell, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh," rejoined Ilse quickly, "I ask your pardon, but America,
also, is badly infested by these people. As their Black Plague
spreads out over the entire world, so spread out the Bolsheviki
to infect all with the red sickness that slays whole nations!"</p>

<p>"We have a few local Reds," he said, unconvinced, "but I had
scarcely supposed&#11834;"</p>

<p>The bell rang: Miss Lanois and Mr. Tchernov were announced, greeted
warmly by Palla, and presented.</p>

<p>Both spoke the beautiful English of educated Russians; Vanya
Tchernov, a wonderfully handsome youth, saluted Palla's hand in
Continental fashion, and met the men with engaging formality.</p>

<p>Shotwell found himself seated beside Marya Lanois, a lithe, warm,
golden creature with greenish golden eyes that slanted, and the
strawberry complexion that goes with reddish hair.</p>

<p>"You are happy," she said, "with all your streets full of bright
flags and your victorious soldiers arriving home by every troopship.
Ah!&mdash;but Russia is the most unhappy of all countries to-day, Mr.
Shotwell."</p>

<p>"It's terribly sad," he said sympathetically. "We Americans don't
seem to know whether to send an army to help you, or merely to
stand aside and let Russia find herself."</p>

<p>"You should send troops!" she said. "Is it not so, Ilse?"</p>

<p>"Sane people should unite," replied the girl, her beautiful face
becoming serious. "It will arrive at that the world over&mdash;the
sane against the insane."</p>

<p>"And it is only the bourgeoisie that is sane," said Vanya Tchernov,
in his beautifully modulated voice. "The extremes are both abnormal&mdash;aristocrats
and Bolsheviki alike."</p>

<p>"We social revolutionists," said Marya Lanois, "were called extremists
yesterday and are called reactionists to-day. But we are the world's
balance. This war was fought for our ideals; your American soldiers
marched for them: the hun failed because of them."</p>

<p>"And there remains only one more war," said Ilse Westgard,&mdash;"the
war against those outlaws we call Capital and Labour&mdash;two names
for two robbers that have disturbed the world's peace long enough!"</p>

<p>"Two tyrants," said Marya, "who trample us to war upon each other&mdash;who
outrage us, crush us, cripple us with their ferocious feuds. What
are the Bolsheviki? 'Those who want more.' Then the name belongs
as well to the capitalists. They, also, are Bolsheviki&mdash;'men who
always want more!' And these are the two quarrelling Bolsheviki
giants who trample us &mdash;Lord Labour, Lord Capital&mdash;the devil
of envy against the devil of greed!&mdash;war to the death! And, to
the survivor, the bones!"</p>

<p>Shotwell, a little astonished to hear from the red lips of this
warm young creature the bitter cynicisms of the proletariat, asked
her to define more clearly where the Bolsheviki stood, and for
what they stood.</p>

<p>"Why," she said, lying back on the sofa and adjusting her lithe
body to a more luxurious position among the pillows, "it amounts
to this, Mr. Shotwell, that a new doctrine is promulgated in the
world&mdash;the cult of the under-dog.</p>

<p>"And in all dog-fights, if the under-dog ever gets on top, then
he, also, will try to kill the ci-devant who has now become the
under-dog." And she laughed at him out of her green eyes that
slanted so enchantingly.</p>

<p>"You mean that there always will be an under-dog in the battle
between capital and labour?"</p>

<p>"Surely. Their snarling, biting, and endless battle is a nuisance."
She smiled again: "We should knock them both on the head."</p>

<p>"You know," explained Ilse, "that when we speak of the two outlaws
as Capital and Labour, we don't mean legitimate capital and genuine
labour."</p>

<p>"They never fight," added Tchernov, smiling, "because they are
one and the same."</p>

<p>"Of course," remarked Marya, "even the united suffer occasionally
from internal pains."</p>

<p>"The remedy," added Vanya, "is to consult a physician. That is&mdash;arbitration."</p>

<p>Ilse said: "Force is good! But one uses it legitimately only
against rabid things." She turned affectionately to Palla and
took her hands: "Your wonderful Law of Love solves all phenomena
except insanity. With rabies it can not deal. Only force remains
to solve that problem."</p>

<p>"And yet," said Palla, "so much insanity can be controlled by
kind treatment."</p>

<p>Estridge agreed, but remarked that strait-jackets and padded
cells would always be necessary in the world.</p>

<p>"As for the Bolsheviki," said Marya, turning her warm young face
to Shotwell with a lissome movement of the shoulders, almost caressing,
"in the beginning we social revolutionists agreed with them and
believed in them. Why not? Kerensky was an incapable dreamer&mdash;so
sensitive that if you spoke rudely to him he shrank away wounded
to the soul.</p>

<p>"That is not a leader! And the Cadets were plotting, and the
Cossacks loomed like a tempest on the horizon. And then came Korniloff!
And the end."</p>

<p>"The peace of Brest," explained Vanya, in his gentle voice, "awoke
us to what the Red Soviets stood for. We saw Christ crucified
again. And understood."</p>

<p>Marya sat up straight on the sofa, running her dazzling white
fingers over her hair&mdash;hair that seemed tiger-red, and very vaguely
scented.</p>

<p>"For thirty pieces of silver," she said, "Judas sold the world.
What Lenine and Trotsky sold was paid for in yellow metal, and
there were more pieces."</p>

<p>Ilse said: "Babushka is dying of it. That is enough for me."</p>

<p>Vanya replied: "Where the source is infected, drinkers die at
the river's mouth. Little Marie Spiridonova perished. Countess
Panina succumbed. Alexandria Kolontar will die from its poison.
And, as these died, so shall Ivan and Vera die also, unless that
polluted source be cleansed."</p>

<p>Marya rested her tawny young head on the cushions again and smiled
at Shotwell:</p>

<p>"It's confusing even to Russians," she said, "&mdash;like a crazy
Bakst spectacle at the Marinsky. I wonder what you must think
of us."</p>

<p>But on her expressive mouth the word "us" might almost have meant
"me," and he paid her the easy compliment which came naturally
to him, while she looked at him out of lazy and very lovely eyes
as green as beryls.</p>

<p>"<em>Tiche</em>," she murmured, smiling, "<em>ce n'est pas moi
l'état, monsieur</em>." And laughed while her indolent glance
slanted sideways on Vanya, and lingered there as though in leisurely
but amiable appraisal.</p>

<p>The girl was evidently very young, but there seemed to be an
indefinable something about her that hinted of experience beyond
her years.</p>

<p>Palla had been looking at her&mdash;from Shotwell to her&mdash;and Marya's
sixth sense was already aware of it and asking why.</p>

<p>For between two females of the human species the constant occult
interplay is like steady lighting. With invisible antennæ they
touch one another incessantly, delicately exploring inside that
grosser aura which is all that the male perceives.</p>

<p>And finally Marya looked back at Palla.</p>

<p>"May Mr. Tchernov play for us?" asked Palla, smiling, as though
some vague authority in the matter were vested in this young girl
with the tiger-hair.</p>

<p>Her eyes closed indolently, and opened again as though digesting
the subtlety: then, disdainfully accepting the assumption: "Oh,
Vanya," she called out carelessly, "play a little for us."</p>

<p>The handsome youth bowed in his absent, courteous way. There
was about him a simplicity entirely winning as he seated himself
at the piano.</p>

<p>But his playing revealed a maturity and nobility of mind scarcely
expected of such gentleness and youth.</p>

<p>Never had Palla heard Beethoven until that moment.</p>

<p>He did not drift. There was no caprice to offend when he turned
with courtly logic from one great master to another.</p>

<p>Only when Estridge asked for something "typically Russian" did
the charming dignity of the sequence break. Vanya laughed and
looked at Marya Lanois:</p>

<p>"That means you must sing," he said.</p>

<p>She sang, resting where she was among the silken cushions;&mdash;the
song, one of those epics of ancient Moscow, lauded Ivan <em>IV.
</em>and the taking of Kazan.</p>

<p>The music was bizarre; the girl's voice bewitching; and though
the song was of the <em>Beliny</em>, it had been made into brief
couplets, and it ended very quickly.</p>

<p>Laughing at the applause, she sang a song of the <em>Skomorokhi</em>;
then a cradle song, infinitely tender and strange, built upon
the Chinese scale; and another&mdash;a Cossack song&mdash;built, also, upon
the pentatonic scale.</p>

<p>Discussions intruded then; the diversion ended the music.</p>

<p>Palla presently rose, spoke to Vanya and Estridge, and came over
to where Jim Shotwell sat beside Marya.</p>

<p>Interrupted, they both looked up, and Jim rose as Estridge also
presented himself to Marya.</p>

<p>Palla said: "If you will take me out, Jim, we can show everybody
the way." And to Marya: "Just a little supper, you know&mdash;but the
dining room is below."</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Her pretty drawing-room was only partly furnished&mdash;an expensive
but genuine set of old Aubusson being her limit for the time.</p>

<p>But beyond, in the rear, the little glass doors opened on a charming
dining-room, the old Georgian mahogany of which was faded to a
golden hue. Curtains, too, were golden shot with palest mauve;
and two Imperial Chinese panels of ancient silk, miraculously
embroidered and set with rainbow Ho-ho birds, were the only hangings
on the walls. And they seemed to illuminate the room like sunshine.</p>

<p>Shotwell, who knew nothing about such things but envisaged them
with reverence, seated Palla and presently took his place beside
her.</p>

<p>His neighbour on his left was Marya, again&mdash;an arrangement which
Palla might have altered had it occurred to her upstairs.</p>

<p>Estridge, very animated, and apparently happy, recalled to Palla
their last dinner together, and their dance.</p>

<p>Palla laughed: "You said I drank too much champagne, John Estridge!
Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"You bet I do. You had a cunning little bunn, Palla&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I did not! I merely asked you and Mr. Brisson what it felt like
to be intoxicated."</p>

<p>"You did your best to be a sport," he insisted, "but you almost
passed away over your first cigarette!"</p>

<p>"Darling!" cried Ilse, "don't let them tease you!"</p>

<p>Palla, rather pink, laughingly denied any aspirations toward
sportdom; and she presently ventured a glance at Shotwell, to
see how he took all this.</p>

<p>But already Marya had engaged him in half smiling, low-voiced
conversation; and Palla looked at her golden-green eyes and warm,
rich colouring, cooled by a skin of snow. Tiger-golden, the <em>rousse</em>
ensemble; the supple movement of limb and body fascinated her;
but most of all the lovely, slanting eyes with their glint of
beryl amid melting gold.</p>

<p>Estridge spoke to Marya; as the girl turned slightly, Palla said
to Shotwell:</p>

<p>"Do you find them interesting&mdash;my guests?"</p>

<p>He turned instantly to her, but it seemed to her as though there
were a slight haze in his eyes&mdash;a fixedness&mdash;which cleared, however,
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"They are delightful&mdash;all of them," he said. "Your blond goddess
yonder is rather overpowering, but beautiful to gaze upon."</p>

<p>"And Vanya?"</p>

<p>"Charming; astonishing."</p>

<p>"Lovable," she said.</p>

<p>"He seems so."</p>

<p>"And &mdash;Marya?"</p>

<p>"Rather bewildering," he replied. "Fascinating, I should say.
Is she very learned?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"She's been in the universities."</p>

<p>"Yes.... I don't know how learned she is."</p>

<p>"She is very young," he remarked.</p>

<p>It was on the tip of Palla's tongue to say something; and she
remained silent&mdash;lest this man misinterpret her motive&mdash;and, perhaps,
lest her own conscience misinterpret it, too.</p>

<p>Ilse said it to Estridge, however, frankly insouciant:</p>

<p>"You know Marya and Vanya are married&mdash;that is, they live together."</p>

<p>And Shotwell heard her.</p>

<p>"Is that true?" he said in a low voice to Palla.</p>

<p>"Why, yes."</p>

<p>He remained silent so long that she added: "The tie is not looser
than the old-fashioned one. More rigid, perhaps, because they
are on their honour."</p>

<p>"And if they tire of each other?"</p>

<p>"You, also, have divorce," said the girl, smiling.</p>

<p>"Do you?"</p>

<p>"It is beastly to live together where love does not exist. People
who believe as they do&mdash;as I do&mdash;merely separate."</p>

<p>"And contract another alliance if they wish?"</p>

<p>"Do not your divorcees remarry if they wish?"</p>

<p>"What becomes of the children?" he demanded sullenly.</p>

<p>"What becomes of them when your courts divorce their parents?"</p>

<p>"I see. It's all a parody on lawful regularity."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you speak of it that way&#11834;"</p>

<p>The girl's face flushed and she extended her hand toward her
wine glass.</p>

<p>"I didn't intend to hurt you, Palla," he said.</p>

<p>She drew a quick breath, looked up, smiled: "You didn't mean
to," she said. Then into her brown eyes came the delicious glimmer:</p>

<p>"May I whisper to you, Jim? Is it too rude?"</p>

<p>He inclined his head and felt the thrill of her breath:</p>

<p>"Shall we drink one glass together&mdash;to each other alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"To a dear comradeship, and close!... And not too desperate!"
she added, as her glance flashed into hidden laughter.</p>

<p>They drank, not daring to look toward each other. And Palla's
careless gaze, slowly sweeping the circle, finally met Marya's&mdash;as
she knew it must. Both smiled, touching each other at once with
invisible antennæ&mdash;always searching, exploring under the glimmering
aura what no male ever discovered or comprehended.</p>

<p>There was, in the living room above, a little more music&mdash;a song
or two before the guests departed.</p>

<p>Marya, a little apart, turned to Shotwell:</p>

<p>"You find our Russian folk-song amusing?"</p>

<p>"Wonderful!"</p>

<p>"If, by any chance, you should remember that I am at home on
Thursdays, there is a song I think that might interest you." She
let her eyes rest on him with a curious stillness in their depths:</p>

<p>"The song is called <em>Lada</em>," she said in a voice so low
that he just heard her. The next moment she was taking leave of
Palla; kissed her. Vanya enveloped her in her wrap.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Estridge called up a taxi; and presently went away with Ilse.</p>

<p>Very slowly Palla came back to the centre of the room, where
Shotwell stood. The scent of flowers was in his nostrils, his
throat; the girl herself seemed saturated with their perfume as
he took her into his arms.</p>

<p>"So you didn't like my friends, Jim," she ventured.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did."</p>

<p>"I was afraid they might have shocked you."</p>

<p>He said drily: "It isn't a case of being shocked. It's more like
being bored."</p>

<p>"Oh. My friends bore you?"</p>

<p>"Their morals do.... Is Ilse that sort, too?"</p>

<p>"That sort?"</p>

<p>"You know what I mean."</p>

<p>"I suppose she is."</p>

<p>"Not inclined to bother herself with the formalities of marriage?"</p>

<p>"I suppose not."</p>

<p>"It's a mischievous, ridiculous, immoral business!" he said hotly.
"Why, to look at you&mdash;at Ilse&mdash;at Miss Lanois&#11834;"</p>

<p>"We don't look like very immoral people, do we?" she said, laughingly.</p>

<p>The light raillery in her laughter angered him, and he released
her and began to pace the room nervously.</p>

<p>"See here, Palla," he said roughly, "suppose I accept you at
your own valuation!"</p>

<p>"I value myself very highly, Jim."</p>

<p>"So do I. That's why I ask you to marry me."</p>

<p>"And I tell you I don't believe in marriage," she rejoined coolly.</p>

<p>"A magistrate can marry us&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It makes no difference. A ceremony, civil or religious, is entirely
out of the question."</p>

<p>"You mean," he said, incensed, "that you refuse to be married
by any law at all?"</p>

<p>"My own law is sufficient."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well, then," he stammered; "&mdash;what&mdash;what sort of procedure&#11834;"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"You're crazy," he said; "<em>you</em> wouldn't do that!"</p>

<p>"If I were in love with you I'd not be afraid."</p>

<p>Her calm candour infuriated him:</p>

<p>"Do you imagine that you and I could ever get away with a situation
like that!" he blazed out.</p>

<p>"Why do you become so irritable and excited, Jim? We're not going
to try&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Damnation! I should think not!" he retorted, so violently that
her mouth quivered. But she kept her head averted until the swift
emotion was under control.</p>

<p>Then she said in a low voice: "If you really think me immoral,
Jim, I can understand your manner toward me. Otherwise&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Palla, dear! Forgive me! I'm just worried sick&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You funny boy," she said with her quick, frank smile, "I didn't
mean to worry you. Listen! It's all quite simple. I care for you
very much indeed. I don't mind your&mdash;caressing&mdash;me&mdash;sometimes.
But I'm not in love. I just care a lot for you.... But not nearly
enough to love you."</p>

<p>"Palla, you're hopeless!"</p>

<p>"Why? Because I am so respectful toward love? Of course I am.
A girl who believes as I do can't afford to make a mistake."</p>

<p>"Exactly," he said eagerly, "but under the law, if a mistake
is made every woman has her remedy&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Her <em>remedy</em>! What do you mean? You can't pass one of
those roses through the flame of that fire and still have your
rose, can you?"</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>"And that's what happens under <em>your</em> laws, as well as
outside of them. No! I don't love you. Under your law I'd be afraid
to marry you. Under mine I'm deathly afraid.... Because &mdash;I
know&mdash;that where love is there can be no fear."</p>

<p>"Is that your answer, Palla?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jim."</p>
