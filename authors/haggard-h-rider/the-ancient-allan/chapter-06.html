<p>The guards led me to my chariot and thrust me into it, and with me Bes.
I asked them if they would murder him also, to which the eunuch, Houman,
answered No, since he had committed no crime, but that he must go with
me to be weighed. Then soldiers took the horses by the bridles and led
them, while others, having first snatched away my bow and all our other
weapons, surrounded the chariot lest we should escape. So Bes and I were
able to talk together in a Libyan tongue that none of them understood,
even if they heard our words.
</p>
<p>“Your life is spared,” I said to him, “that the King may take you as a
slave.”
</p><p>“Then he will take an ill slave, Master, since I swear by the
Grasshopper that within a moon I will find means to kill him, and
afterwards come to join you in a land where men hunt fair.”
</p><p>I smiled and Bes went on,
</p><p>“Now I wish I had time to teach you that trick of swallowing your own
tongue, since perhaps you will need it in this boat of which they talk.”
</p><p>“Did you not say to me an hour or two ago, Bes, that we are fools to
stretch out our hands to Death until he stretches out his to us? I will
not die until I must--now.”
</p><p>“Why ‘now,’ Master, seeing that only this afternoon you bade me kill you
rather than let you be thrown to the wild beasts?” he asked peering at
me curiously.
</p><p>“Do you remember the old hermit, the holy Tanofir, who dwells in a cell
over the sepulchre of the Apis bulls in the burial ground of the desert
near to Memphis, Bes?”
</p><p>“The magician and prophet who is the brother of your grandfather,
Master, and the son of a king; he who brought you up before he became a
hermit? Yes, I know him well, though I have seldom been very near to him
because his eyes frighten me, as they frightened Cambyses the Persian
when Tanofir cursed him and foretold his doom after he had stabbed the
holy Apis, saying that by a wound from that same sword in his own body
he should die himself, which thing came to pass. As they have frightened
many another man also.”
</p><p>“Well, Bes, when yonder king told me that I must die, fear filled me
who did not wish to die thus, and after the fear came a blackness in my
mind. Then of a sudden in that blackness I saw a picture of Tanofir, my
great uncle, seated in a sepulchre looking towards the East. Moreover
I heard him speak, and to me, saying, ‘Shabaka, my foster-son, fear
nothing. You are in great danger but it will pass. Speak to the great
King all that rises in your heart, for the gods of Vengeance make use of
your tongue and whatever you prophesy to him shall be fulfilled.’ So I
spoke the words you heard and I feared nothing.”
</p><p>“Is it so, Master? Then I think that the holy Tanofir must have entered
my heart also. Know that I was minded to leap upon that king and break
his neck, so that all three of us might end together. But of a sudden
something seemed to tell me to leave him alone and let things go as they
are fated. But how can the holy Tanofir who grows blind with age, see so
far?”
</p><p>“I do not know, Bes, save that he is not as are other men, for in him
is gathered all the ancient wisdom of Egypt. Moreover he lives with the
gods while still upon earth, and like the gods can send his <u>Ka</u>, as we
Egyptians call the spirit, or invisible self which companions all from
the cradle to the grave and afterwards, whither he will. So doubtless
to-day he sent it hither to me whom he loves more than anything on
earth. Also I remember that before I entered on this journey he told
me that I should return safe and sound. Therefore, Bes, I say I fear
nothing.”
</p><p>“Nor do I, Master. Yet if you see me do strange things, or hear me speak
strange words, take no note of them, since I shall be but playing a part
as I think wisest.”
</p><p>After this we talked of that day’s adventure with the lions, and of
others that we had shared together, laughing merrily all the while, till
the soldiers stared at us as though we were mad. Also the fat eunuch,
Houman, who was mounted on an ass, rode up and said,
</p><p>“What, Egyptian who dared to twist the beard of the Great King, you
laugh, do you? Well, you will sing a different song in the boat to that
which you sing in the chariot. Think of my words on the eighth day from
this.”
</p><p>“I will think of them, Eunuch,” I answered, looking at him fiercely in
the eyes, “but who knows what kind of a song you will be singing before
the eighth day from this?”
</p><p>“What I do is done under the authority of the ancient and holy Seal of
Seals,” he answered in a quavering voice, touching the little cylinder
of white shell which I had noted upon the person of the King, but that
now hung from a gold chain about the eunuch’s neck.
</p><p>Then he made the sign which Easterns use to avert evil and rode off
again, looking very frightened.
</p><p>So we came to the royal city and went up to a wonderful palace. Here we
were taken from the chariot and led into a room where food and drink in
plenty were given to me as though I were an honoured guest, which caused
me to wonder. Bes also, seated on the ground at a distance, ate and
drank, for his own reasons filling himself to the throat as though he
were a wineskin, until the serving slaves mocked at him for a glutton.
</p><p>When we had finished eating, slaves appeared bearing a wooden framework
from which hung a great pair of scales. Also there appeared officers of
the King’s Treasury, carrying leather bags which they opened, breaking
the seals to show that the contents were pure gold coin. They set a
number of these bags on one of the scales, and then ordered Bes to seat
himself in the other. So much heavier did he prove than they expected
him to be, that they were obliged to send back to the Treasury to fetch
more bags of gold, for although Bes was so short in height, his weight
was that of a large man. One of the treasurers grumbled, saying he
should have been weighed before he had eaten and drunk. But the officer
to whom he spoke grinned and answered that it mattered little, since the
King was heir to criminals and that these bags would soon return to
the Treasury, only they would need washing first, a remark that made me
wonder.
</p><p>At length, when the scales were even, the six hunters whose lives I had
won and who had been given to me as slaves, were brought in and ordered
to shoulder the bags of gold. I too was seized and my hands were bound
behind me. Then I was led out in charge of the eunuch Houman, who
informed me with a leer that it would be his duty to attend to my
comfort till the end. With him were four black men all dressed in the
same way. These, he said, were the executioners. Lastly came Bes watched
by three of the king’s guards armed with spears, lest he should attempt
to rescue me or to do anyone a mischief.
</p><p>Now my heart began to sink and I asked Houman what was to happen to me.
</p><p>“This, O Egyptian slayer of lions. You will be laid upon a bed in a
little boat upon the river and another boat will be placed over you, for
these boats are called the Twins, Egyptian, in such a fashion that your
head and your hands will project at one end and your feet at the other.
There you will be left, comfortable as a baby in its cradle, and twice
every day the best of food and drink will be brought to you. Should your
appetite fail, moreover, it will be my duty to revive it by pricking
your eyes with the point of a knife until it returns. Also after each
meal I shall wash your face, your hands and your feet with milk and
honey, lest the flies that buzz about them should suffer hunger, and to
preserve your skin from burning by the sun. Thus slowly you will
grow weaker and at length fall asleep. The last one who went into the
boat--he, unlucky man, had by accident wandered into the court of the
House of Women and seen some of the ladies there unveiled--only
lived for twelve days, but you, being so strong, may hope to last for
eighteen. Is there anything more that I can tell you? If so, ask it
quickly for we draw near to the river.”
</p><p>Now when I heard this and understood all the horror of my fate, I forgot
the vision of my great uncle, the holy Tanofir, and his comfortable
prophecies, and my heart failed me altogether, so that I stood stock
still.
</p><p>“What, Lion-hunter and Bearder of kings, do you think it is too early to
go to bed?” mocked this devilish eunuch. “On with you!” and he began to
beat me about the face with the handle of his fly-whisk.
</p><p>Then my manhood came back to me.
</p><p>“When did the King tell you to touch me, you fatted swine?” I roared,
and turning, since I could not reach him with my bound hands, kicked
him in the body with all my strength, so that he fell down, writhing and
screaming with agony. Indeed, had not the executioners leapt upon me, I
would have trampled the life out of him where he lay. But they held me
fast and presently, after he had been sick, Houman recovered enough to
come forward leaning on the shoulders of two guards. Only now he mocked
me no more.
</p><p>We reached a quay just as the sun was setting. There in charge of a
one-eyed black slave, a little square-ended boat floated at the river’s
edge, while on the quay itself lay a similar but somewhat shorter boat,
bottom uppermost. Now the hunters whom I had won in the wager, with many
glances of compassion, for they were brave men and knew that it was I
who had saved their lives, placed the bags of gold in the bottom of the
floating boat, and on the top of these a mattress stuffed with straw.
Then the girdle of rose-hued pearls was made fast about my middle, my
hands were untied, I was seized by the executioners and laid on my back
on the mattress, and my wrists and ankles were fixed by cords to iron
rings that were screwed to the thwarts of the boat. After this the
other, shorter boat was laid over me in such a manner that it did not
touch me, leaving my head, my hands and my feet exposed as the eunuch
had said.
</p><p>While this wicked work was going forward Bes sat on the quay, watching,
till presently, after I had been made fast and covered up, he burst into
shouts of laughter, clapped his hands and began to dance about as though
with joy, till the eunuch, who had now recovered somewhat from my kick,
grew curious and asked him why he behaved thus.
</p><p>“O noble Eunuch,” he answered, “once I was free and that man made me a
slave, so that for many years I have been obliged to toil for him whom I
hate. Moreover, often he has beaten me and starved me, which was why you
saw me eat so much not long ago, and threatened to kill me, and now at
last I have my revenge upon him who is about to die miserably. That is
why I laugh and sing and dance and clap my hands, O most noble Eunuch,
I who shall become the follower and servant of the glorious King of
all the earth, and perhaps your friend, too, O Eunuch of eunuchs, whose
sacred person my brutal master dared to kick.”
</p><p>“I understand,” said Houman smiling, though with a twisted face, “and
will make report of all you say to the King, and ask him to grant that
you shall sometimes prick this Egyptian in the eye. Now go spit in his
face and tell him what you think of him.”
</p><p>So Bes waded into the water which was quite shallow here, and spat into
my face, or pretended to, while amid a torrent of vile language, he
interpolated certain words in the Libyan tongue, which meant,
</p><p>“O my most beloved father, mother, and other relatives, have no fear.
Though things look very black, remember the vision of the holy Tanofir,
who doubtless allows these things to happen to you to try your faith by
direct order of the gods. Be sure that I will not leave you to perish,
or if there should be no escape, that I will find a way to put you out
of your misery and to avenge you. Yes, yes, I will yet see that accursed
swine, Houman, take your place in this boat. Now I go to the Court to
which it seems that this gold chain gives me a right of entry, or so the
eunuch says, but soon I will be back again.”
</p><p>Then followed another stream or most horrible abuse and more spitting,
after which he waded back to land and embraced Houman, calling him his
best friend.
</p><p>They went, leaving me alone in the boat save for the guard upon the quay
who, now that darkness had come, soon grew silent. It was lonely, very
lonely, lying there staring at the empty sky with only the stinging
gnats for company, and soon my limbs began to ache. I thought of the
poor wretches who had suffered in this same boat and wondered if their
lot would be my lot.
</p><p>Bes was faithful and clever, but what could a single dwarf do among all
these black-hearted fiends? And if he could do nothing, oh! if he could
do nothing!
</p><p>The seconds seemed minutes, the minutes seemed hours, and the hours
seemed years. What then would the days be, passed in torture and
agony while waiting for a filthy death? Where now were the gods I had
worshipped and--was there any god? Or was man but a self-deceiver who
created gods instead of the gods creating him, because he did not love
to think of an eternal blackness in which he would soon be swallowed up
and lost? Well, at least that would mean sleep, and sleep is better than
torment of mind or body.
</p><p>It came to me, I think, who was so weary. At any rate I opened my eyes
to see that the low moon had vanished and that some of the stars which
I knew as a hunter who had often steered his way by them, had moved a
little. While I was wondering idly why they moved, I heard the tramp of
soldiers on the quay and the voice of an officer giving a command. Then
I felt the boat being drawn in by the cord with which it was attached to
the quay. Next the other boat that lay over me was lifted off, the ropes
that bound we were undone and I was set upon my feet, for already I was
so stiff that I could scarcely stand. A voice which I recognised as that
of the eunuch Houman, addressed me in respectful tones, which made me
think I must be dreaming.
</p><p>“Noble Shabaka,” said the voice, “the Great King commands your presence
at his feast.”
</p><p>“Is it so?” I answered in my dream. “Then my absence from their feast
will vex the gnats of the river,” a saying at which Houman and others
with him laughed obsequiously.
</p><p>Next I heard the bags of gold being removed from the boat, after which
we walked away, guards supporting me by either elbow until I found my
strength again, and Houman following just behind, perhaps because he
feared my foot if he went in front.
</p><p>“What has chanced, Eunuch,” I asked presently, “that I am disturbed from
the bed where I was sleeping so well?”
</p><p>“I do not know, Lord,” he answered. “I only know that the King of kings
has suddenly commanded that you should be brought before him as a guest
clothed in a robe of honour, even if to do so, you must be awakened from
your rest, yes, to his own royal table, for he holds a feast this night.
Lord,” he went on in a whining voice, “if perchance fortune should have
changed her face to you, I pray you bear no malice to those who, when
she frowned, were forced, yes, under the private Seal of Seals, against
their will to carry out the commands of the King. Be just, O Lord
Shabaka.”
</p><p>“Say no more. I will try to be just,” I answered. “But what is justice
in the East? I only know of it in Egypt.”
</p><p>Now we reached one of the doors of the palace and I was taken to a
chamber where slaves who were waiting, washed and anointed me with
scents, after which they clad me in a beautiful robe of silk, setting
the girdle of rose-hued pearls about me.
</p><p>When they had finished, preceded by Houman I was led to a great pillared
hall closed in with silk hangings, where many feasted. Through them I
went to a dais at the head of the hall where between half-drawn curtains
surrounded by cup-bearers and other officers, the King sat in all his
glory upon a cushioned golden throne. He had a glittering wine-cup in
his hand and at a glance I saw that he was drunk, as it is the fashion
for these Easterns to be at their great feasts, for he looked happy and
human which he did not do when he was sober. Or perchance, as sometimes
I thought afterwards, he only pretended to be drunk. Also I saw
something else, namely, Bes, wondrously attired with the gold chain
about his neck and wearing a red headdress. He was seated on the carpet
before the throne, and saying things that made the King laugh and even
caused the grave officers behind to smile.
</p><p>I came to the dais and at a little sign from Bes who yet did not seem to
see me, such a sign as he often made when he caught sight of game before
I did, I prostrated myself. The King looked at me, then asked,
</p><p>“Who is this?” adding, “Oh, I remember, the Egyptian whose arrows do not
miss, the wonderful hunter whom Idernes sent to me from Memphis, which
I hope to visit ere long. We quarrelled, did we not, Egyptian, something
about a lion?”
</p><p>“Not so, King,” I answered. “The King was angry and with justice,
because I could not kill a lion before it frightened his horses.”
</p><p>This I said because my hours in the boat had made me humble, also
because the words came to my lips.
</p><p>“Yes, yes, something like that, or at least you lie well. Whatever it
may have been, it is done with now, a mere hunters’ difference,” and
taking from his side his long sceptre that was headed with the great
emerald, he stretched it out for me to touch in token of pardon.
</p><p>Then I knew that I was safe for he to whom the King has extended his
sceptre is forgiven all crimes, yes, even if he had attempted the royal
life. The Court knew it also, for every man who saw bowed towards me,
yes, even the officers behind the King. One of the cup-bearers too
brought me a goblet of the King’s own wine, which I drank thankfully,
calling down health on the King.
</p><p>“That was a wonderful shot of yours, Egyptian,” he said, “when you sent
an arrow through the lioness that dared to attack my Majesty. Yes, the
King owes his life to you and he is grateful as you shall learn. This
slave of yours,” and he pointed to Bes in his gaudy attire, “has brought
the whole matter to my mind whence it had fallen, and, Shabaka,” here he
hiccupped, “you may have noted how differently things look to the naked
eye and when seen through a wine goblet. He has told me a wonderful
story--what was the story, Dwarf?”
</p><p>“May it please the great King,” answered Bes, rolling his big eyes,
“only a little tale of another king of my own country whom I used to
think great until I came to the East and learned what kings could be.
That king had a servant with whom he used to hunt, indeed he was my own
father. One day they were out together seeking a certain elephant whose
tusks were bigger than those of any other. Then the elephant charged the
king and my father, at the risk of his life, killed it and claimed the
tusks, as is the custom among the Ethiopians. But the king who greatly
desired those tusks, caused my father to be poisoned that he might take
them as his heir. Only before he died, my father, who could talk the
elephant language, told all the other elephants of this wickedness,
at which they were very angry, because they knew well that from the
beginning of time their tusks have belonged to him who killed them, and
the elephants are a people who do not like ancient laws to be altered.
So the elephants made a league together and when the king next went out
hunting, taking heed of nothing else they rushed at the king and tore
him into pieces no bigger than a finger, and then killed the prince his
son, who was behind him. That is the tale of the elephants who love Law,
O King.”
</p><p>“Yes, yes,” said his Majesty, waking up from a little doze, “but what
became of the great tusks? I should like to have them.”
</p><p>“I inherited them as my father’s son, O King, and gave them to my
master, who doubtless will send them to you when he gets back to Egypt.”
</p><p>“A strange tale,” said the King. “A very strange tale which seems to
remind me of something that happened not long ago. What was it? Well, it
does not matter. Egyptian, do you seek any reward for that shot of
yours at the lioness? If so, it shall be given to you. Have you a grudge
against anyone, for instance?”
</p><p>“O King,” I answered, “I do seek justice against a certain man. This
evening I was led to the bank of the river in charge of the eunuch
Houman, who desired to take me for a row in a boat. On the road, for no
offence he struck me on the head with the handle of his fly-whip. See,
here are the marks of it, O King. Unless the King commanded him to
strike me which I do not remember, I seek justice against this eunuch.”
</p><p>Now the King grew very angry and cried,
</p><p>“What! Did the dog dare to strike a freeborn noble Egyptian?”
</p><p>Here Houman threw himself upon his face in terror and began to babble
out I know not what about the punishment of the boat, which was unlucky
for him, for it put the matter into the King’s mind.
</p><p>“The boat!” he cried. “Ah! yes, the boat; being so fat you will fit it
well, Eunuch. To the boat with him, and before he enters it a hundred
blows upon the feet with the rods,” and he pointed at him with his
sceptre.
</p><p>Then guards sprang upon Houman and dragged him away. As he went he
clutched at Bes, but hissing something into his ear, the dwarf bit
him through the hand till he let go. So Houman departed and the King’s
guests laughed at the sight, for he had worked mischief to many.
</p><p>When he had gone the King stared at me and asked,
</p><p>“But why did I disturb you from your sleep, Egyptian? Oh! I remember.
This dwarf says that he has seen the fairest woman in the whole world,
and the most learned, some lady of Egypt, but that he does not know her
name, that you alone know her name. I disturbed you that you might tell
it to me but if you have forgotten it, you can go back to your bed and
rest there till it returns to you. There are plenty of boats in the
river, Egyptian.”
</p><p>“The fairest and most learned woman in the world?” I said astonished.
“Who can that be, unless he means the lady Amada?” and I paused, wishing
I had bitten out my tongue before I spoke, for I smelt a trap.
</p><p>“Yes, Master,” said Bes in a clear voice. “That was the name, the lady
Amada.”
</p><p>“Who is this lady Amada?” asked the King, seeming to grow suddenly
sober. “And what is she like?”
</p><p>“I can tell you that, O King,” said Bes. “She is like a willow shaken in
the wind for slenderness and grace. She has eyes like those of a buck
at gaze; she has lips like rosebuds; she has hair black as the night and
soft as silk, the odour of which floats round her like that of flowers.
She has a voice that whispers like the evening wind, and yet is rich
as honey. Oh! she is beautiful as a goddess and when men see her their
hearts melt like wax in the sun and for a long while they can look upon
no other woman, not till the next day indeed if they meet her in the
evening,” and Bes smacked his thick lips and gazed upwards.
</p><p>“By the holy Fire,” laughed the King, “I feel my heart melting already.
Say, Shabaka, what do you know of this Amada? Is she married or a
maiden?”
</p><p>Now I answered because I must, for after all that boat was not far away,
nor did I dare to lie.
</p><p>“She is married, O King of kings, to the goddess Isis whom she loves
alone.”
</p><p>“A woman married to a woman, or rather to the Queen of women,” he
answered laughing, “well, that matters little.”
</p><p>“Nay, O King, it matters much since she is under the protection of Isis
and inviolate.”
</p><p>“That remains to be seen, Shabaka. I think that I would dare the wrath
of every false goddess in heaven to win such a prize. Learned also, you
say, Shabaka.”
</p><p>“Aye, O King, full of learning to the finger tips, a prophetess also,
one in whom the divine fire burns like a lamp in a vase of alabaster,
one to whom visions come and who can read the future and the past.”
</p><p>“Still better,” said the King. “One, then, who would be a fitting
consort for the King of kings, who wearies of fat, round-eyed,
sweetmeat-sucking fools whereof there are hundreds yonder,” and he
pointed towards the House of Women. “Who is this maid’s father?”
</p><p>“He is dead but she is the niece of the Prince Peroa, and by birth the
Royal Lady of Egypt, O King.”
</p><p>“Good, then she is well born also. Hearken, O Shabaka, to-morrow you
start back to Egypt, bearing letters from me to my vassal Peroa, and to
my Satrap Idernes, bidding Peroa to hand over this lady Amada to Idernes
and bidding Idernes to send her to the East with all honour and without
delay, that she may enter my household as one of my wives.”
</p><p>Now I was filled with rage and horror, and about to refuse this mission
when Bes broke in swiftly,
</p><p>“Will the King of kings be pleased to give command as to my master’s
safe and honourable escort to Egypt?”
</p><p>“It is commanded with all things necessary for Shabaka the Egyptian and
the dwarf his servant, with the gold and gems and slaves he won from me
in a wager, and everything else that is his. Let it be recorded.”
</p><p>Scribes sprang forward and wrote the King’s words down, while like one
in a dream I thought to myself that they could not now be altered. The
King watched them sleepily for a while, then seemed to wake up and grow
clear-minded again. At least he said to me,
</p><p>“Fortune has shown you smiles and frowns to-day, Egyptian, and the
smiles last. Yet remember that she has teeth behind her lips wherewith
to tear out the throat of the faithless. Man, if you play me false or
fail in your mission, be sure that you shall die and in such a fashion
that will make you think of yonder boat as a pleasant bed, and with you
this woman Amada and her uncle Peroa, and all your kin and hers; yes,”
 he added with a burst of shrewdness, “and even that abortion of a dwarf
to whom I have listened because he amused me, but who perhaps is more
cunning than he seems.”
</p><p>“O King of kings,” I said, “I will not be false.” But I did not add to
whom I would be true.
</p><p>“Good. Ere long I shall visit Egypt, as I have told you, and there
I shall pass judgment on you and others. Till then, farewell. Fear
nothing, for you have my safe-conduct. Begone, both of you, for you
weary me. But first drink and keep the cup, and in exchange, give me
that bow of yours which shoots so far and straight.”
</p><p>“It is the King’s,” I answered as I pledged him in the golden, jewelled
cup which a butler had handed to me.
</p><p>Then the curtain fell in front of the throne and chamberlains came
forward to lead me and Bes back to our lodging, one of whom took the cup
and bore it in front of us. Down the hall we went between the feasting
nobles who all bowed to one to whom the Great King had shown favour, and
so out of the palace through the quiet night back to the house where I
had dwelt while waiting audience of the King. Here the chamberlains
bade me farewell, giving the cup to Bes to carry, and saying that on the
morrow early my gold should be brought to me together with all that was
needed for my journey, also one who would receive the bow I had promised
to the King, which had already been returned to my lodgings with
everything that was ours. Then they bowed and went.
</p><p>We entered the house, climbing a stair to an upper chamber. Here Bes
barred the door and the shutters, making sure that none could see or
hear us.
</p><p>Then he turned, threw his arms about me, kissed my hand and burst into
tears.
