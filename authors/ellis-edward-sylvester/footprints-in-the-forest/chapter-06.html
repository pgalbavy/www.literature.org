<p>Deerfoot the Shawanoe darted among the trees and ran a hundred
yards with great swiftness. He seemed to avoid the trunks and
limbs with the ease of a bird when sailing through the tree tops.</p>

<p>Coming to a halt, he looked around. He had not followed a direct
course into the woods, but turning to the right, ran parallel
to the open space which bordered the stream. He knew the Pawnees
would do their best, either to capture or kill him. So long as
there was a chance of making him prisoner, they would do him no
harm, for the pleasure of acting as they chose with such a captive
was a hundred fold greater than that which could be caused by
his mere death. The American Indian is as fond of enjoying the
suffering of another as is his civilized brother.</p>

<p>The burst of speed in which the youth indulged gave him a position
where it would require some searching on the part of the Pawnees
to discover him; but they were at work, as speedily became evident.</p>

<p>A few seconds only had passed, when he caught sight of several
forms flitting among the trees. While they were separated from
each other by two or three rods, they were not far off, and their
actions showed they had observed him at the same moment he detected
them. They made no outcry, but, spreading still further apart,
acted as if carrying out a plan for surrounding him.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was too wise to presume on his fleetness of foot, and
he now broke into a loping trot which was meant to be neither
greater nor less than the gait of his pursuers. Glancing back
he saw they were running faster than he, whereupon he increased
his speed.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of them discharged his gun, and a moment later another
shot was heard. The first bullet sped wide, but the second clipped
off a dead branch just above the head of the fugitive. There was
no mistake, therefore, as to the purpose of those who fired.</p>

<p>It was not the first time that Deerfoot had served as a target
for the rifle of an enemy, and though never wounded, his sensations
were any thing but pleasant. Where a good marksman failed, a poor
one was liable to succeed: for the most wonderful shots are those
made by chance.</p>

<p>Deerfoot now ran as fast as he dared, where branches and tree
trunks were so numerous. Glancing to the rear, as he continually
did, he noticed that two of the Pawnees were leading in the pursuit.
The thought came to him that no better time could be selected
for teaching them the superiority of the bow over the rifle.</p>

<p>As he ran, he drew an arrow from the quiver over his shoulder
and fitted it to the string. This was difficult, for the long
bow caught in the obstructions around him and compelled him to
slacken his pace. Then, like a flash, he leaped partly behind
a tree and drew the arrow to a head.</p>

<p>The Pawnees must have been amazed to discover, while in full
pursuit of an enemy, that he had vanished as though swallowed
by some opening in the earth; for the action of the fugitive was
so sudden that it was not observed. They ran several rods further,
during which Deerfoot made his aim sure. As they had discharged
their guns, and had not yet slackened their pace to reload them,
he had no fear of being hurt.</p>

<p>All at once the foremost Pawnee saw the long bow, with the gleaming
eyes behind the arrow, whose head was supported by the right hand
which grasped the middle of the bow.</p>

<p>"Whoof!" he gasped, dropping to the earth as if pierced through
the heart. His action saved his life, for a second sooner would
have enabled the matchless archer to withhold the shot, which
was as unerring as human skill could make it. Though the flight
of the feather-tipped missile could be traced when the spectator
stood on one side of the line, yet the individual who was unfortunate
enough to serve as a target, could not detect its approach.</p>

<p>Just as the leader went down, a quick whiz was heard, and the
arrow clove the space over him. Had his companion been in line
he would have been pierced, but he was just far enough to one
side, to be taught a lesson.</p>

<p>The strongly-driven missile went through the fleshy part of his
arm, and sped twenty feet beyond, nipping several branches and
twigs before its force was spent. No doubt the American race as
a rule is hardy and stoical, but the stricken Pawnee acted like
a schoolboy. Dropping his gun, he clasped his hand over the wound,
and emitted a yell which surpassed everything in that line that
had been heard during the day.</p>

<p>Even the warrior on the ground called to him to hold his peace,
and the wounded Pawnee, awaking perhaps to a sense of the unbecoming
figure he was cutting, compressed his thin lips and became silent.</p>

<p>But the other took good care to reload and prime his rifle before
rising, and even then he came up with the utmost slowness, peering
toward the tree from which had come the missile. He was not surprised
because he saw nothing of the Shawanoe. Having discharged the
weapon, it was natural that the latter should shelter himself
from the bullet that was to be expected in return. Deerfoot (so
reasoned the Pawnee), would not dare show himself again; but therein
the warrior made a mistake.</p>

<p>The latter slowly came up, his form in a crouching position,
his head about four feet above ground, while his eyes were fixed
on the tree from behind which had sped the well nigh fatal missile.</p>

<p>"He will soon show himself," must have been the thought of the
Indian, "the bullet can travel faster than the arrow."</p>

<p>At that moment his companion, who was still clasping his wounded
arm, uttered a warning cry. He had discovered the Shawanoe behind
another tree, aiming a second arrow at the breast of the leader.</p>

<p>With incredible dexterity, Deerfoot had run to a trunk fully
twenty yards from the one which first sheltered him. He crouched
so low and passed so swiftly that he reached the shelter before
there was a possibility of discovery. It was accident which led
the second warrior to detect the long bow, bending almost like
a horseshoe, with the arrow aimed at the other.</p>

<p>The latter could not grasp in an instant the full nature of the
peril which impended, though, as a matter of course, he knew it
must be at the hands of the Shawanoe. He cast one glance around
him, and again dropped on his face, but this time the arrow was
quicker than he.</p>

<p><em>Zip</em> came the missile straight for the brawny chest which
never could have dodged from its path in time to escape; but,
as if fate had determined to interfere, the pointed flint impinged
against a tiny branch protruding from the tree nearest the Pawnee,
clipping off enough of the tender bark to leave a gleaming white
spot, and glanced harmlessly beyond.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was astonished beyond measure. He had discharged two
arrows at the foremost foe, and had failed to harm a hair of him.
Such a double failure had never before taken place in his history.</p>

<p>But the cause was self-manifest. The Indian dodged the first,
and the twig turned the second aside. All this was natural enough,
but the fact which impressed the young Shawanoe was that it would
have taken place in neither case had he used a rifle. Was it a
wise thing, therefore, when months before, he had flung aside
his gun and taken up his bow again?</p>

<p>Deerfoot had asked himself the same question more than once since
that time, and the doubt had deepened until he could no longer
believe he was wise in clinging to his bow and arrow, great as
was his skill in their use.</p>

<p>But a third arrow was quickly drawn, and stepping from behind
the tree, so that he stood in full sight, he swung his hand aloft
with a defiant shout, and coolly walked away, as though the warriors
were too insignificant to be noticed further.</p>

<p>The wounded Pawnee was so much occupied with his hurt that he
was willing the youth should leave the neighborhood without further
molestation from him. Taking care to keep an oak fully a foot
in diameter between them, he was content to let him depart in
peace.</p>

<p>Not so with the other, who, waiting only long enough to make
sure the back of the youth was toward him, straightened up and
brought his rifle to his shoulder. The distance was considerable,
but he ought to have reached the mark, and probably would have
done so, had not a disturbing cause prevented.</p>

<p>While sighting along the barrel, the startling fact broke upon
him that the face of Deerfoot was toward him, and he was in the
act of drawing a third arrow to the head: He had whirled about
almost at the same instant that the Pawnee leveled his gun. To
say the least, it was very disconcerting, and, anxious to anticipate
the Shawanoe, the other fired before he could be certain of his
aim. The bullet went so wide that Deerfoot heard nothing of its
passage among the branches around him.</p>

<p>Although it looked as if the Shawanoe had the other at his mercy,
yet he refrained from discharging the arrow. In fact, his whole
action was designed rather to disconcert the Pawnee than to injure
him. Not only had Deerfoot's confidence in his bow and arrow weakened,
but the two escapes of the Pawnee gave him a half-superstitious
belief that it was intended the latter should not be injured.
He, therefore, relaxed the string of the bow, but, without replacing
the arrow in the quiver, he strode off, continually glancing back
to make sure the Pawnee did not use the advantage thus given him.</p>
