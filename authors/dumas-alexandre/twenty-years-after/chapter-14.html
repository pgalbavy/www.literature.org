<P>Whilst this scene was going on, D'Artagnan remained with
open mouth and a confused gaze. Everything had turned out so
differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with
wonder.</P>
<P>Athos, who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts,
took his arm and led him into the garden.</P>
<P>&quot;Whilst supper is being prepared,&quot; he said, smiling, &quot;you
will not, my friend, be sorry to have the mystery which so
puzzles you cleared up.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;True, monsieur le comte,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, who felt that
by degrees Athos was resuming that great influence which
aristocracy had over him.</P>
<P>Athos smiled.</P>
<P>&quot;First and foremost, dear D'Artagnan, we have no title such
as count here. When I call you `chevalier,' it is in
presenting you to my guests, that they may know who you are.
But to you, D'Artagnan, I am, I hope, still dear Athos, your
comrade, your friend. Do you intend to stand on ceremony
because you are less attached to me than you were?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! God forbid!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then let us be as we used to be; let us be open with each
other. You are surprised at what you see here?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Extremely.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But above all things, I am a marvel to you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I confess it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am still young, am I not? Should you not have known me
again, in spite of my eight-and-forty years of age?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On the contrary, I do not find you the same person at all.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I understand,&quot; cried Athos, with a gentle blush.
&quot;Everything, D'Artagnan, even folly, has its limit.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then your means, it appears, are improved; you have a
capital house  -  your own, I presume? You have a park, and
horses, servants.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos smiled.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I inherited this little property when I quitted the
army, as I told you. The park is twenty acres  -  twenty,
comprising kitchen-gardens and a common. I have two horses,
 -  I do not count my servant's bobtailed nag. My sporting
dogs consist of two pointers, two harriers and two setters.
But then all this extravagance is not for myself,&quot; added
Athos, laughing.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I see, for the young man Raoul,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;You guess aright, my friend; this youth is an orphan,
deserted by his mother, who left him in the house of a poor
country priest. I have brought him up. It is Raoul who has
worked in me the change you see; I was dried up like a
miserable tree, isolated, attached to nothing on earth; it
was only a deep affection that could make me take root again
and drag me back to life. This child has caused me to
recover what I had lost. I had no longer any wish to live
for myself, I have lived for him. I have corrected the vices
that I had; I have assumed the virtues that I had not.
Precept something, but example more. I may be mistaken, but
I believe that Raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as
our degenerate age could display.&quot;</P>
<P>The remembrance of Milady recurred to D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;And you are happy?&quot; he said to his friend.</P>
<P>&quot;As happy as it is allowed to one of God's creatures to be
on this earth; but say out all you think, D'Artagnan, for
you have not yet done so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are too bad, Athos; one can hide nothing from you,&quot;
answered D'Artagnan. &quot;I wished to ask you if you ever feel
any emotions of terror resembling  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Remorse! I finish your phrase. Yes and no. I do not feel
remorse, because that woman, I profoundly hold, deserved her
punishment. Had she one redeeming trait? I doubt it. I do
not feel remorse, because had we allowed her to live she
would have persisted in her work of destruction. But I do
not mean, my friend that we were right in what we did.
Perhaps all blood demands some expiation. Hers had been
accomplished; it remains, possibly, for us to accomplish
ours.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have sometimes thought as you do, Athos.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;She had a son, that unhappy woman?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Have you ever heard of him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Never.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He must be about twenty-three years of age,&quot; said Athos, in
a low tone. &quot;I often think of that young man, D'Artagnan.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Strange! for I had forgotten him,&quot; said the lieutenant.</P>
<P>Athos smiled; the smile was melancholy.</P>
<P>&quot;And Lord de Winter  -  do you know anything about him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I know that he is in high favor with Charles I.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The fortunes of that monarch now are at low water. He shed
the blood of Strafford; that confirms what I said just now
 -  blood will have blood. And the queen?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What queen?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Madame Henrietta of England, daughter of Henry IV.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;She is at the Louvre, as you know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, and I hear in bitter poverty. Her daughter, during the
severest cold, was obliged for want of fire to remain in
bed. Do you grasp that?&quot; said Athos, shrugging his
shoulders; &quot;the daughter of Henry IV. shivering for want of
a fagot! Why did she not ask from any one of us a home
instead of from Mazarin? She should have wanted nothing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Have you ever seen the queen of England?&quot; inquired
D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;No; but my mother, as a child, saw her. Did I ever tell you
that my mother was lady of honor to Marie de Medici &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Never. You know, Athos, you never spoke much of such
matters.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, mon Dieu, yes, you are right,&quot; Athos replied; &quot;but then
there must be some occasion for speaking.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Porthos wouldn't have waited for it so patiently,&quot; said
D'Artagnan, with a smile.</P>
<P>&quot;Every one according to his nature, my dear D'Artagnan.
Porthos, in spite of a touch of vanity, has many excellent
qualities. Have you seen him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I left him five days ago,&quot; said D'Artagnan, and he
portrayed with Gascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence
of Porthos in his Chateau of Pierrefonds; nor did he neglect
to launch a few arrows of wit at the excellent Monsieur
Mouston.</P>
<P>&quot;I sometimes wonder,&quot; replied Athos, smiling at that gayety
which recalled the good old days, &quot;that we could form an
association of men who would be, after twenty years of
separation, still so closely bound together. Friendship
throws out deep roots in honest hearts, D'Artagnan. Believe
me, it is only the evil-minded who deny friendship; they
cannot understand it. And Aramis?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have seen him also,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;but he seemed to
me cold.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, you have seen Aramis?&quot; said Athos, turning on
D'Artagnan a searching look. &quot;Why, it is a veritable
pilgrimage, my dear friend, that you are making to the
Temple of Friendship, as the poets would say.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why, yes,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, with embarrassment.</P>
<P>&quot;Aramis, you know,&quot; continued Athos, &quot;is naturally cold, and
then he is always involved in intrigues with women.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one,&quot;
said D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>Athos made no reply.</P>
<P>&quot;He is not curious,&quot; thought D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>Athos not only failed to reply, he even changed the subject
of conversation.</P>
<P>&quot;You see,&quot; said he, calling D'Artagnan's attention to the
fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hour's
walk, &quot;we have made a tour of my domains.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All is charming and everything savors of nobility,&quot; replied
D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>At this instant they heard the sound of horses' feet.</P>
<P>&quot;'Tis Raoul who has come back,&quot; said Athos; &quot;and we can now
hear how the poor child is.&quot;</P>
<P>In fact, the young man appeared at the gate, covered with
dust, entered the courtyard, leaped from his horse, which he
consigned to the charge of a groom, and then went to greet
the count and D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said Athos, placing his hand on D'Artagnan's
shoulder, &quot;monsieur is the Chevalier D'Artagnan of whom you
have often heard me speak, Raoul.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said the young man, saluting again and more
profoundly, &quot;monsieur le comte has pronounced your name
before me as an example whenever he wished to speak of an
intrepid and generous gentleman.&quot;</P>
<P>That little compliment could not fail to move D'Artagnan. He
extended a hand to Raoul and said:</P>
<P>&quot;My young friend, all the praises that are given me should
be passed on to the count here; for he has educated me in
everything and it is not his fault that his pupil profited
so little from his instructions. But he will make it up in
you I am sure. I like your manner, Raoul, and your
politeness has touched me.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos was more delighted than can be told. He looked at
D'Artagnan with an expression of gratitude and then bestowed
on Raoul one of those strange smiles, of which children are
so proud when they receive them.</P>
<P>&quot;Now,&quot; said D'Artagnan to himself, noticing that silent play
of countenance, &quot;I am sure of it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I hope the accident has been of no consequence?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They don't yet know, sir, on account of the swelling; but
the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured.&quot;</P>
<P>At this moment a little boy, half peasant, half foot-boy,
came to announce supper.</P>
<P>Athos led his guest into a dining-room of moderate size, the
windows of which opened on one side on a garden, on the
other on a hot-house full of magnificent flowers.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan glanced at the dinner service. The plate was
magnificent, old, and appertaining to the family. D'Artagnan
stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of
silver.</P>
<P>&quot;That workmanship is divine!&quot; he exclaimed.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, a chef d'oeuvre of the great Florentine sculptor,
Benvenuto Cellini,&quot; replied Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;What battle does it represent?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That of Marignan, just at the point where one of my
forefathers is offering his sword to Francis I., who has
broken his. It was on that occasion that my ancestor,
Enguerrand de la Fere, was made a knight of the Order of St.
Michael; besides which, the king, fifteen years afterward,
gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen
formerly in my house, also a lovely specimen of workmanship.
Men were giants in those times,&quot; said Athos; &quot;now we are
pigmies in comparison. Let us sit down to supper. Call
Charles,&quot; he added, addressing the boy who waited.</P>
<P>&quot;My good Charles, I particularly recommend to your care
Planchet, the laquais of Monsieur D'Artagnan. He likes good
wine; now you have the key of the cellar. He has slept a
long time on a hard bed, so he won't object to a soft one;
take every care of him, I beg of you.&quot; Charles bowed and
retired.</P>
<P>&quot;You think of everything,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;and I thank you
for Planchet, my dear Athos.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to
be quite sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus
addressed.</P>
<P>&quot;That name sounds strange to you,&quot; said Athos, smiling; &quot;it
was my nom de guerre when Monsieur D'Artagnan, two other
gallant friends and myself performed some feats of arms at
the siege of La Rochelle, under the deceased cardinal and
Monsieur de Bassompierre. My friend is still so kind as to
address me by that old and well beloved appellation, which
makes my heart glad when I hear it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;'Tis an illustrious name,&quot; said the lieutenant, &quot;and had
one day triumphal honors paid to it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you mean, sir?&quot; inquired Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;You have not forgotten St. Gervais, Athos, and the napkin
which was converted into a banner?&quot; and he then related to
Raoul the story of the bastion, and Raoul fancied he was
listening to one of those deeds of arms belonging to days of
chivalry, so gloriously recounted by Tasso and Ariosto.</P>
<P>&quot;D'Artagnan does not tell you, Raoul,&quot; said Athos, in his
turn, &quot;that he was reckoned one of the finest swordsmen of
his time  -  a knuckle of iron, a wrist of steel, a sure eye
and a glance of fire; that's what his adversary met with. He
was eighteen, only three years older than you are, Raoul,
when I saw him set to work, pitted against tried men.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And did Monsieur D'Artagnan come off the conqueror?&quot; asked
the young man, with glistening eye.</P>
<P>&quot;I killed one man, if I recollect rightly,&quot; replied
D'Artagnan, with a look of inquiry directed to Athos;
&quot;another I disarmed or wounded, I don't remember which.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Wounded!&quot; said Athos; &quot;it was a phenomenon of skill.&quot;</P>
<P>The young man would willingly have prolonged this
conversation far into the night, but Athos pointed out to
him that his guest must need repose. D'Artagnan would fain
have declared that he was not fatigued, but Athos insisted
on his retiring to his chamber, conducted thither by Raoul.</P></article>
