<p>Lieutenant Russell gave no hint to Nellie Dawson of the scheme
upon which he had fixed his hopes, until after she had confessed
her love for him, and he was certain beyond the shadow of a doubt,
that he possessed the sole affection of her heart. Even then he
hesitated for he knew the shock it would cause the gentle one,
who was devotedly attached to her father. But the resolution of
Captain Dawson to spend the remainder of his days at the mining
settlement, and his intention of selecting her husband from among
those that had made New Constantinople their home for years, crystallized
the determination that had been vaguely shaping itself in his
brain for weeks.</p>

<p>As he expected, she recoiled shocked by the proposal to leave
her father; but love is eloquent, and he won by convincing her
that the separation would be only temporary. Her father would
be quick to see the great wrong his course would inflict upon
his child, and he would not only consent to the union, but would
follow and make his home with them. It was this implicit belief
which made her the companion of Lieutenant Russell in the flight
from the mountain settlement.</p>

<p>The project having been carefully planned and arranged, the preparations
were more complete than those of their pursuers. They took sufficient
extra clothing in the form of wraps and blankets, and enough food
to last for several days. They were well mounted and had the companionship
of the huge dog Timon, with his almost human intelligence.</p>

<p>The lieutenant's memory of places was good, and, having a number
of hours of daylight at command, he escaped the mistake of his
pursuers. The turn from Dead Man's Gulch was made at the right
point, and they were miles on their way before their flight was
discovered by Captain Dawson and his friends.</p>

<p>Both of the fugitives did not doubt they would be pursued. They
knew the consuming anger that would take possession of her father,
who would probably collect several companions and start after
them with furious haste. He would take frightful vengeance upon
the man that had dared to steal his daughter. Everything, therefore,
must be done to keep beyond his reach until his wrath had time
to cool. The intention was to make Sacramento ahead of him. At
that city, the lieutenant would seek out his future father-in-law
and plead his cause.</p>

<p>When night closed around them, they had penetrated to a distance
of perhaps fifteen miles in the Sierras. It was at sunset that
they passed a spot, where horses and riders, the latter on foot,
had to pick their way with extreme care, while even Timon, who
clung faithfully to them, showed timidity, though he had been
over the place before. The sagacious brute knew that a mis-step
on his part meant death. The passage, however, was made without
mishap, and Russell, as he helped his companion into the saddle,
assured her that nothing so trying to the nerves was to be expected
during the rest of the journey.</p>

<p>There was no fear of pursuit until after nightfall, but Russell
frequently pointed his glass backward and scanned the trail over
his whole field of vision. When the gathering darkness shut out
everything, he had seen nothing of enemies, either white or red.
He could not forget that on his previous journey, he and the captain
had desperate fighting with the Indians and the same peril still
impended.</p>

<p>Nellie was eager to cover all the ground possible, while the
opportunity was theirs, and the flight was pushed longer than
Russell would have advised. Finally, he insisted they should stop
and rest themselves and horses for the remainder of the night.
The halting place was selected with much care. The animals were
turned loose, where the grass was growing and a small stream wound
its way toward a larger one. Then the two, accompanied by Timon,
pushed in among the rocks to where the final halt was made.</p>

<p>They were in profound darkness. The lieutenant decided to start
a fire, and, with much difficulty, gathered a sufficiency of dried
branches. They were fortunate enough to find a partial cavern,
so open in front that it would have given slight shelter in the
event of a storm. When the blaze threw out its cheerful light,
it served to dissipate the gloom which in spite of themselves
had oppressed them with the coming of night.</p>

<p>They partook of food and the lieutenant's spirits rose, for he
saw nothing to prevent the full success of the dream which had
inspired and thrilled him so long. His buoyancy was infectious,
and he brought a smile to the beauteous countenance by his merry
sallies, and his picture of the happy future that was close at
hand.</p>

<p>"Your father will be angry at first," he said; "it would be strange
if he were not, but he loves you and I think has a pretty fair
opinion of me. When he gains time to think over the matter, he
will admit the wisdom of what we have done and we shall receive
his blessing."</p>

<p>It was this assurance, more than all else, that served to lift
the gloom from her. Deep as was her love for the one at her side,
it would not have sufficed to draw her from her adored parent,
had she believed that his resentment against her would last. As
it was, she grieved that even for a brief time, as she thought
would be the case, he should hold harsh feelings toward her.</p>

<p>No chivalrous knight of the Crusades could have been more scrupulously
considerate of lady intrusted to his charge than Lieutenant Russell.
He would have died before offending Nellie Dawson by act, word
or presumptuous thought. When, as the night advanced, the bright
eyes began to grow drowsy, he arranged a couch for her, saw that
she was well provided with blankets and then turned to the immense
dog, who had never left them and who looked as if he understood
everything.</p>

<p>"Now, Timon, you are to stay right here," he said, bending over
and impressively shaking his finger at the animal; "you are not
to venture a dozen feet from your mistress without permission.
Do you understand?"</p>

<p>A whine and wagging of the tail left no doubt that the wishes
of his late master were clear to him.</p>

<p>"You have your gun at your side," he added, turning to Nellie;
"I do not think you will have any call to use it. We have not
met any Indians and your father cannot overtake us before morning.
Timon will be sure to give you warning of the approach of danger,
and, if your gun goes off, I shall be here in a twinkling."</p>

<p>He bade her good night and departed. Enough wood had been flung
on the fire to keep it going for an hour or two, but long before
it sank to ashes, the girl had drifted into dreamland.</p>

<p>The lieutenant carefully selected his own sleeping quarters.
He finally fixed upon a large flat boulder, at the rear of the
cavern occupied by Timon and his charge; but, although beyond
sight, he was near enough to reach the spot on the instant needed.
Spreading out his blanket, he lay down upon it.</p>

<p>"This recalls the old days in Virginia, when mud a foot deep,
with the rain dashing in our faces, was what we had for weeks
at a time. This couch doesn't equal a feather bed, but it will
answer."</p>

<p>The night passed without incident and it was hardly light when
the young officer was astir. He visited the horses and found them
cropping the grass, but he waited until Timon came to him before
calling upon Nellie. She, too, had been awake for some time and
they partook of their morning meal with rugged appetites.</p>

<p>She was so eager to hurry on that he lost no time in taking the
road again. Neither could doubt that their pursuers were on their
trail, and, with the aid of his small glass, he carefully studied
the country behind them. It was not long before he made the discovery
he dreaded: four horsemen were following their footprints, and
beyond them were the five Indians picking their way along the
ledge in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The lieutenant passed the glass to his companion who scrutinized
the party with the keenest interest.</p>

<p>"They must have traveled all night," remarked her escort, while
she still peered through the instrument.</p>

<p>"That shows how dreadfully angry father is; I hope it will not
last."</p>

<p>"Can you make out the members of the party?"</p>

<p>She studied them a minute or two more before answering:</p>

<p>"I think that is father who is close to the man on a mule."</p>

<p>"The one on a mule must be Vose Adams, for he is more accustomed
to that sort of animal. I am sorry he is with the party."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Nellie, lowering the glass and looking at him.</p>

<p>"He is so familiar with the trail, that it will be hard work
to outwit him; he isn't the man to make mistakes. Did you recognize
the others?"</p>

<p>"I cannot be sure, but I suspect they are Mr. Ruggles and Mr.
Brush."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you are right,&mdash;not because I was able to identify
them, but because the two are partners and your father would naturally
go to them first. I do not think any one of the four has a glass,
so, despite their sharp eyes, we have a big advantage in that
respect."</p>

<p>"But they know the route better than we, and we are losing time."</p>

<p>The course of the trail took them out of the field of vision
of their pursuers. It was at the suggestion of Russell that the
two turned aside from the ca√±on into the fissure-like gorge. This
would have been a serious mistake, except for the plan he had
in view, for it must place the pursuers in advance, the very thing
which it would seem the fugitives ought if possible to prevent.</p>

<p>The lieutenant had believed from the first that Vose Adams, in
threading his way through the mountains, traveled a good many
miles more than was necessary. It was quite likely that, if he
could follow a straight line, he would shorten the distance one-half.
Although this was impossible, the young man, nevertheless, was
convinced that by changing the route, a good many miles could
be saved: and it was in his mind to do that thing.</p>

<p>The lieutenant's experience in campaigning had taught him the
danger of going astray, when picking his way through an unfamiliar
country, but the little compass attached as a charm to his watch
chain would help him to keep track of the variations and windings,
and he was confident of coming out right. He and Nellie were well
mounted and armed, all of which being impressed upon his companion,
she offered no objection to the radical change of plan which took
them out of the ca√±on into the ravine that led them they knew
not whither, but it was ominous of disaster that at the top of
the fissure, when the two were leading their animals, a grievous
mishap occurred. The pony of Nellie slipped and sprained his ankle
so badly that he whined with pain and paused with his weight supported
on three legs.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE LIEUTENANT PASSED THE GLASS TO HIS COMPANION,
WHO SCRUTINIZED THE PARTY WITH THE KEENEST INTEREST. &</em>mdash;<em>PAGE
269</em>.]</p>

<p>"That's a bad go!" exclaimed the dismayed Russell; "it will be
several days before he is able to travel."</p>

<p>She examined the ankle, as best she could, trying to soothe the
pain by passing her hand over the injured part, but it was plain
that neither she nor her companion could give any help.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," she said sympathetically; "you cannot go any further;
what shall be done, Fred?"</p>

<p>"Only one thing seems possible,&mdash;take you on my horse."</p>

<p>"And what will become of Cap?"</p>

<p>"We must leave him behind."</p>

<p>"What will happen to him?"</p>

<p>"Some one will pick him up, or, after his leg recovers, he may
find his way back to the settlement."</p>

<p>The impulsive girl flung her arms about the animal's neck and
touched her lips to the silken nose.</p>

<p>"They shall not part us, Cap," she exclaimed with tears in her
eyes.</p>

<p>The lieutenant watched this by-play, full of sympathy for the
girl, but he was in a quandary. Prudence seemed to demand that
everything should be sacrificed to speed by abandoning the pony.
In all probability, the latter would serve as a dinner for some
of the bears, wolves or other denizens of the mountains, who would
quickly harry him to death. To wait where they were until the
animal was able to travel rendered certain a speedy meeting with
their pursuers. The woodcraft of Vose Adams would enable him to
discover with slight delay the point where the fugitives had left
the ca√±on, and he would guide his companions with the skill of
one of the mountain Indians themselves.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the plan he had in view imposed prodigious
work upon his own animal. Between the halting place and Sacramento
were many miles of easy traveling, over which he could walk, but
for long distances the beast would be compelled to carry double.
In the event of close pursuit, this must prove a fatal handicap.</p>

<p>In his perplexity, the lieutenant again examined the hurt of
the pony.</p>

<p>"It would be cruel to make him take a single step, but he may
soon recover. I am afraid to leave him behind and to continue
our flight with only my horse. You know how dangerous it is to
linger, Nellie, when it is certain <em>they</em> are not far off&#11834;"</p>

<p>She caught his arm and whispered:</p>

<p>"Look at Timon! he has discovered something!"</p>

<p>The dog was standing a few paces in front of them, with his nose
pointed toward the ca√±on. He emitted several growls and pricked
up his ears in a way that left no doubt that he was angered. The
lieutenant had hardly time to place himself in an attitude of
defence with his Winchester, when a soft footfall was heard, and
the next moment Vose Adams emerged from behind the pile of rocks
and approached them.</p>

<p>It was proof of the guide's woodcraft that he was able to come
thus close before being detected by Timon, who advanced threateningly
toward him. A word, however, from the lieutenant stayed the dog.</p>

<p>"Well, Vose," said the young man, "this is unexpected."</p>

<p>"So I jedge and I've a 'spicion that you ain't tickled half to
death to see me."</p>

<p>"We were always friends, but I can't say that either Nellie or
I am glad to meet you under the circumstances; for in truth, we
have been doing all we could to prevent such a meeting."</p>

<p>"Things has that look," added Vose, standing on guard as may
be said, for he was not free from misgiving concerning the young
lieutenant whom he had managed to run down. His positive orders
forbade him to assume the aggressive, but no one could forbid
him to defend himself, and he did not mean that this handsome
officer should catch him unprepared.</p>

<p>"Whom have you with you?" asked Russell.</p>

<p>"The captain, Wade Ruggles and the parson."</p>

<p>"What we suspected; I presume no one of the three feels specially
affectionate toward me."</p>

<p>"It is all the captain can do to prevent the other two from quarrelin'
as to which shall have the first chance to shoot you."</p>

<p>"Why does Captain Dawson prevent them?"</p>

<p>"'Cause he means to have the first chance himself."</p>

<p>"How about <em>you</em>?" grimly asked Lieutenant Russell.</p>

<p>"I'm left."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"A low down trick was played onto me; as near as I can find out,
the captain comes first, Wade and the parson next and me fourth.
You can see for yourself that there won't be any chance at all
left for me after them three is through."</p>

<p>"It doesn't look so,&mdash;that's a fact. But where are the three?"</p>

<p>"Along the main trail, down in the kenyon."</p>

<p>"Why did they not come with you?"</p>

<p>"I advised 'em to wait till I found out how the land laid and
they won't leave the spot till I get back."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Russell gave no expression to the thought that flashed
upon him. Why not keep Vose Adams a prisoner? The loss of his
services to the party would be irreparable, for, as it was, the
present hiding place of the fugitives never would have become
known to them without the help of the guide. It was a daring scheme,
but there were so many objections to carrying it out, that the
officer dismissed it. In truth he thought of a much better plan.</p>

<p>"You have told me enough, Vose, to prove that the four men&mdash;for
I may as well include yourself&mdash;feel bitterer toward me than I
suspected: do you think this enmity of theirs will last?"</p>

<p>"Not for long."</p>

<p>"How long?"</p>

<p>"They'll let up as soon as you're shot."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Russell could not restrain a smile at this way of
putting it, while Nellie was so horrified that she gasped and
stared and listened in silence.</p>

<p>"There can be little doubt that you are right, but I meant to
ask whether you do not think the captain will moderate his anger
when he is given time to think it over."</p>

<p>"He has had all night to do that, and this mornin' he was hotter
if anything, than at any time since he larned what you had done."</p>

<p>"When did he learn it?"</p>

<p>Thereupon, Vose told the facts which have already been made known
to the reader, the most interesting feature of which was that
Adams was not an original member of the pursuing party. But, although
the guide was so pronounced in his opinion of the continuance
of the enmity of Captain Dawson, the lieutenant believed otherwise.
He was confident that if he and Nellie could reach Sacramento
before meeting the irate father, the latter would be open to reason,
and all would turn out well.</p>

<p>Vose turned to the young woman.</p>

<p>"Nellie, do you want a little advice from me?"</p>

<p>"I am glad to have it at any time."</p>

<p>"Howsumever, what I say is as much for the leftenant as for you,
which the same is that both of you should give up this bus'ness."</p>

<p>"But," said Nellie, "you have just told us that father is so
angry with Lieutenant Russell that he will shoot him the moment
they meet."</p>

<p>"We can fix that easy 'nough; let the leftenant stay here while
you go with me; I think we can explain matters to the captain
and the others so they won't bother the leftenant."</p>

<p>"And what am <em>I</em> to do?" asked Russell.</p>

<p>"Push on to Sacramento as fast as you can, for though I think
I can fix it, I wouldn't advise you to take too many chances."</p>

<p>"In other words, after Nellie and I have fled from the settlement
and got this far on the road to safety, you urge me to give her
up forever."</p>

<p>"Wal, that's lookin' a little further ahead than I meant to,
but I 'spose it amounts to that."</p>

<p>"You mean well, Vose, but do you imagine that Nellie and I did
not count the cost before turning our backs on New Constantinople?
Don't you suppose we knew we should be pursued and were prepared
for the consequences?"</p>

<p>"I can't say as to that, but it strikes me that the plan I laid
before you is the only one there is."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You cannot get away from the captain and the men with him."</p>

<p>"Well, there is no call for me to repeat my opinion, but I will
say that the decision shall rest with Nellie herself. If she wishes
to go with you I will interpose not a word of objection."</p>

<p>He looked toward her as an invitation for her to speak. There
was a world of affection and faith in the lustrous eyes, as she
walked resolutely forward and placed herself by his side.</p>

<p>"Only death shall separate us!"</p>
