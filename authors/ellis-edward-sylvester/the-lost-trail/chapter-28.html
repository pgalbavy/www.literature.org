<p>Naturally the first impression of Jack Carleton, on seeing the
light, was that it proceeded from the fire kindled by Otto.  It
struck him as curious that he should do so before he could be
certain the horse was captured; but, in accordance with his training,
Jack took nothing for granted.  A few guarded steps, and he discovered
the truth; the light was much closer than he suspected, and came
through a slight rent in the side of an Indian wigwam.</p>

<p>The young Kentuckian was astounded, for he had never dreamed
of anything of the kind.  He concluded he must be on the confines
of an Indian village, and made a further investigation; but it
did not take long to learn that the lodge stood alone in the great
forest.</p>

<p>"I suppose some chieftain or warrior has quarreled with his people
and lives by himself," was the remarkably accurate guess of the
boy; "I don't know how he feels toward white folks, but I'll take
a little further look and then hunt up Otto."</p>

<p>He could not fail to note that the lodge stood close to the clearing
where he had agreed to meet his friend, and he was unable to free
himself of a dread, while stealing forward for the purpose of
peeping through the rent in the side of the aboriginal structure.
Otto must have seen the wigwam before reaching it, though the
proprietor might have been quicker in detecting the approach of
a stranger.</p>

<p>Fully sensible of the care required, Jack advanced slowly, without
noise, feeling every inch of the way.  At last he was able to
bend forward and peep through the slight opening, which first
told him of the location of the wigwam.  It required some delicate
maneuvering to gain a good view of the interior, and it need not
be said that the result was of the most interesting nature.</p>

<p>His eyes, or rather eye (inasmuch as he used only one), first
rested on the dusky baby, that had managed to kick off the blanket,
and was fiercely tugging at the piece of cooked venison which
his dusky mother bad tossed him.  He held it between his scant
teeth, grasping it with his chubby hands, while his feet beat
the air, occasionally catching under his chin, as though he was
using hands and feet to force the meat apart.  He worked his legs
with such a vigor that at times he seemed in danger of making
a back somersault and bumping through the side of the lodge.</p>

<p>Under other circumstances Jack Carleton would have laughed outright
at the comical figure of the bright-eyed infant; but the sight
of Otto Relstaub checked all such feeling, and deepened the alarm
which came with the first sight of the wigwam.</p>

<p>It so happened that Jack was much closer to his friend than he
was to any of the other three figures.  No more than two feet
separated the boys, and in peering into the lodge, the eavesdropper
looked directly over the head and shoulders of Otto.  The familiar
peaked hat, which had not been removed, the rather long, curling
hair, the round, rosy check, broad shoulders, the tip of the pug
nose, the plump chin, the feet, and the arms resting idly on the
drawn-up knees&mdash;all these made the young German look like an exaggerated
fairy, that had dropped in on some superstitious mortals and was
regaling them with tales of wonderland.  But Otto was not discoursing
to listeners; he was looking from one to the other, sometimes
smiling at the snuffing, kicking, clawing infant, and then assuming
an anxious expression, when his eyes rested on the face of the
others who shared the lodge with him.</p>

<p>The squaw was slowly drawing in and exhaling the vapor from her
pipe, with the deliberate enjoyment of an old smoker.  With her
elbows on her knees, she stared fixedly at Otto, who must have
been annoyed by her persistency.</p>

<p>Wish-o-wa-tum, the Man-not-Afraid-of-Thunder, occupied his throne
of bison skin on the other side of the wigwam, and, having tired
of sitting erect as became a monarch, was lounging on his right
elbow, leaving his left hand free to manipulate his pipe, which
was occasionally taken from his lips, after the cheeks were filled
to overflowing with pungent vapor.  Then, forming his immense
mouth into a contracted circle, be ejected the smoke with his
doubled tongue, sending forth ring after ring, in any direction
he chose. Looking up at the opening in the top of the lodge, he
started a regular procession of blue circles, twisting inward
and slowly expanding as they climbed toward the fresh air, where
they were suddenly caught and whirled into nothingness.</p>

<p>Jack had the best view of the chieftain he could wish, and fearful
of being detected, drew his head back a few inches so as to be
in entire darkness, and studied the ugly countenance.  He observed
the small, piggish eyes far apart, the big cheek bones, the disfigured
nose, the enormous mouth, the slouchy, untidy dress, and even
the half dozen straggling hairs that sprouted here and there over
his massive chin.</p>

<p>He noticed the flitting glances of the black eyes, and knew that
the unattractive Indian had, in some way or other, made a prisoner
of Otto Relstaub, whose rifle was missing.  Standing on the outside
with his loaded gun in hand, the young Kentuckian could have done
as he pleased with the red man, who had no suspicions of danger;
but the thought of shooting him was unspeakably shocking to Jack,
who could not have been persuaded to the step unless forced to
do so, in order to save the life of Otto or himself.</p>

<p>Cruel indeed must any one be who could look on the picture of
domestic happiness, the stolid father, the contented mother, and
the lusty youngster, without feeling his heart stirred by that
deep, inborn sympathy which makes the whole world akin.</p>

<p>"He isn't a Shawanoe or Miami," was the conclusion of Jack, after
a careful study of the warrior's face and general appearance;
"I have never seen an Osage, but have heard much of them, and
I'm quite sure he is one.  If that is so, he isn't as fierce as
his race on the other side the Mississippi, and I think we can
get Otto out of there without harm to any one.  If we are going
to live in this part of the world, we must keep on good terms
with the Indians.  Helloa! what is the old fellow going to do?"</p>

<p>Jack noticed that the head of the family had stopped glancing
from one part of the lodge to another, and was looking steadily
at Otto, as if he meditated some design against him.</p>

<p>And so he did.  Drawing in an enormous quantity of smoke, he
removed the stem from his leathern lips, contracted them into
another O, and suddenly shot out a vapory ring, followed instantly
by a second, third and fourth, and then by so many that they stumbled
over each other's heels, as may be said.  Indeed, the mouth of
Wish-a-wa-tum seemed to have become a mitrailleue for the moment,
that sent a continuous volley across the wigwam.</p>

<p>When the bombardment opened, Otto was looking thoughtfully at
the ground in the middle of the lodge, so that his face was turned
toward the chieftain.  The latter aimed with such skill that,
as he intended, the first ring passed directly over the end of
Otto's pug nose, which for the instant looked as though some painter
had enclosed the organ in a delicately tinted circle.</p>

<p>The latter was no more than in place, when it was followed by
several others.  The series, however, was blown into nothingness
by a resounding sneeze from Otto, which started the vapor toward
the opening above, that seemed to exert a greater power as the
distance from the ground increased.  When within a few inches
of the outlet, the smoke flew apart, spun around and whisked out
of sight, with the current that was borne upward from every part
of the lodge.</p>

<p>"Donderation!" exclaimed Otto as best he could, through the strangling
vapor; "what for you don't do dot?  Don't you vants to kill somepodys
mit your smoke&mdash;don't it?  Yaw I oogh!"</p>

<p>Man-not-Afraid-of-Thunder did not stir.  Still holding his pipe
suspended in his left hand, he looked at the discomfited youth
and smiled.</p>

<p>The smile was the most prodigious on which Jack Carleton had
ever looked.  He saw the corners of the mouth move back on the
cheeks until it seemed they must touch the ears.  Perhaps the
chief smiled so seldom that the few served to bring up the "general
average" of those that were lacking.</p>

<p>Wish-o-wa-tum could have added to the distress of Otto by continuing
his vapory cannonade, but he refrained, and amused himself by
sending the rings once more toward the chimney.</p>

<p>While this little episode was going on, the squaw, with her chin
on her hands and her elbows on her knees, continued to stare at
Otto; but she showed no disposition to smile even in the slightest
degree. In her the element of mirth appeared to be totally lacking.</p>

<p>It is more than probable that she had not acquired the art of
ejecting the circles of smoke, or she would have followed up the
exhibition of her husband with a similar one, inspired thereto
by the innate ugliness of her nature.</p>

<p>The incident described did much to dissipate the alarm of Jack
Carleton for his friend.  The overwhelming smile on the countenance
of the chieftain made it attractive, for it was free from the
disfigurement of hate.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is an Osage, with his wife and little one.  He may not
be a pleasant neighbor, but he would not dare to live away from
his tribe, if he was as cruel as the Shawanoes or Hurons.  Some
of the settlers would shoot him and his squaw and papoose."</p>

<p>This theory was reasonable, but from the nature of the case it
could not be complete in the assurance it brought to the mind
of the young Kentuckian, inasmuch as it failed to explain several
alarming facts.</p>

<p>In the first place, Otto, manifestly, was a prisoner in the lodge.
He had no gun with which to defend himself, nor could the guarded
peeping of the eavesdropper discover the weapon within the wigwam.
In what manner the German had fallen into the power of the Osage
was beyond conjecture, nor could Jack guess the ultimate intentions
of the captor.</p>

<p>"I have my loaded gun," was the thought of the youth, "and I
ought to be able to get Otto out of this scrape.  I shall be sorry,
indeed, to harm any one in the wigwam, and so long as it is possible
to avoid it, I will.  If the warrior receives injury it will be
his own fault."</p>

<p>At such times, the most curious fancies often take possession
of a person.  Jack Carleton had convinced himself that the Indian,
wigwam was the only one in the neighborhood; but he had scarcely
decided what his course should be, when he began to fear he had
made a mistake.  It seemed unlikely that a single Osage should
dwell apart from his tribe in that fashion.</p>

<p>"There must be other lodges near me," he thought, stepping softly
back and peering around in the gloom.</p>

<p>It mattered not that he saw no lights from any of them, for he
reasoned that they might be hidden by the intervening trees. 
So strong was the feeling, that he moved further off and repeated
the very reconnaissance made a short time previous.</p>

<p>He would not have done so, had he not known that Otto was in
no immediate danger from his captor.  Had the latter offered him
harm, the struggle would have been heard in the stillness of the
night, and Jack would have rushed to the relief of his friend.</p>

<p>Finally, the eavesdropper became satisfied that whatever the
issue of the strange situation, he had but the single family to
face. Then he was distressed by the doubt as to what the squaw
would do, it he carried out his scheme.  It is well known that
the Indian women are as brave, and frequently more cruel, toward
their captives than are the warriors themselves.  If the one before
him became violent, Jack would be likely to find he had undertaken
a task beyond his power.</p>

<p>His determination was to walk directly into the lodge and act
as if he believed the occupants were his friends.  He therefore
strode forward toward the entrance, purposely kicking the leaves
with his feet; and it was that noise which apprised those within
of his approach.</p>
