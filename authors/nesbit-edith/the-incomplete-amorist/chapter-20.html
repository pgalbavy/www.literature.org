<p>
  Dear Mr. Vernon. This is to thank you very much for all your help
  and criticism of my work, and to say good-bye. I am called away
  quite suddenly, so I can't thank you in person, but I shall never
  forget your kindness. Please remember me to Lady St. Craye. I
  suppose you will be married quite soon now. And I am sure you will
  both be very happy.</p>

<blockquote><div>Yours very sincerely,<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Elizabeth Desmond.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>This was the letter that Vernon read standing in the shadow of the
arch by the concierge's window. The concierge had hailed him as he
hurried through to climb the wide shallow stairs and to keep his
appointment with Betty when she should leave the atelier.</p>

<p>&quot;But yes, Mademoiselle had departed this morning at nine o'clock. To
which station? To the Gare St. Lazare. Yes - Mademoiselle had charged
her to remit the billet to Monsieur. No, Mademoiselle had not left any
address. But perhaps chez Madame Bianchi?&quot;</p>

<p>But chez Madame Bianchi there was no further news. The so amiable
Mademoiselle Desmond had paid her account, had embraced Madame,
and - Voila! she was gone. One divined that she had been called
suddenly to return to the family roof. A sudden illness of Monsieur
her father without doubt.</p>

<p>Could some faint jasmine memory have lingered on the staircase? Or was
it some subtler echo of Lady St. Craye's personality that clung there?
Abruptly, as he passed Betty's door, the suspicion stung him. Had the
Jasmine lady had any hand in this sudden departure?</p>

<p>&quot;Pooh - nonsense!&quot; he said. But all the same he paused at the
concierge's window.</p>

<p>&quot;I am desolated to have deranged Madame,&quot; - gold coin changed
hands. - &quot;A lady came to see Mademoiselle this morning, is it not?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no lady had visited Mademoiselle to-day: no one at all in
effect.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nor last night - very late?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, monsieur,&quot; the woman answered meaningly; &quot;no visitor came in last
night except Monsieur himself and he came, not to see Mademoiselle,
that understands itself, but to see Monsieur Beauch&egrave;sne an troisi&egrave;me.
No - I am quite sure - I never deceive myself. And Mademoiselle has had
no letters since three days. Thanks a thousand times, Monsieur. Good
morning.&quot;</p>

<p>She locked up the gold piece in the little drawer where already lay
the hundred franc note that Lady St. Craye had given her at six
o'clock that morning.</p>

<p>&quot;And there'll be another fifty from her next month,&quot; she chuckled.
&quot;The good God be blessed for intrigues! Without intrigues what would
become of us poor concierges?&quot;</p>

<p>For Vernon Paris was empty - the spring sunshine positively
distasteful. He did what he could; he enquired at the Gare St. Lazare,
describing Betty with careful detail that brought smiles to the lips
of the employ&eacute;s. He would not call on Miss Voscoe. He made himself
wait till the Sketch Club afternoon - made himself wait, indeed, till
all the sketches were criticised - till the last cup of tea was
swallowed, or left to cool - the last cake munched - the last student's
footfall had died away on the stairs, and he and Miss Voscoe were
alone among the scattered tea-cups, blackened bread-crumbs and torn
paper.</p>

<p>Then he put his question. Miss Voscoe knew nothing. Guessed Miss
Desmond knew her own business best.</p>

<p>&quot;But she's so young,&quot; said Vernon; &quot;anything might have happened to
her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I reckon she's safe enough - where she is,&quot; said Miss Voscoe with
intention.</p>

<p>&quot;But haven't you any idea why she's gone?&quot; he asked, not at all
expecting any answer but &quot;Not the least.&quot;</p>

<p>But Miss Voscoe said:</p>

<p>&quot;I have a quite first-class idea and so have you.&quot;</p>

<p>He could but beg her pardon interrogatively.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you know well enough,&quot; said she. &quot;She'd got to go. And it was up
to her to do it right now, I guess.&quot;</p>

<p>Vernon had to ask why.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you being engaged to another girl, don't you surmise it might
kind of come home to her there were healthier spots for you than the
end of her apron strings? Maybe she thought the other lady's apron
strings 'ud be suffering for a little show?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not engaged,&quot; said Vernon shortly.</p>

<p>&quot;Then it's time you were,&quot; the answer came with equal shortness.
&quot;You'll pardon me making this a heart-to-heart talk - and anyway it's
no funeral of mine. But she's the loveliest girl and I right down like
her. So you take it from me. That F.F.V. Lady with the violets - Oh,
don't pretend you don't know who I mean - the one you're always about
with when you aren't with Betty. <span style="text-decoration: underline">She's</span> your ticket. Betty's not.
Your friend's her style. You pass, this hand, and give the girl a
chance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I really don't understand - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I bet you do,&quot; she interrupted with conviction. &quot;I've sized you up
right enough, Mr. Vernon. You're no fool. If you've discontinued your
engagement Betty doesn't know it. Nor she shan't from me. And one of
these next days it'll be borne in on your friend that she's <span style="text-decoration: underline">the</span> girl
of his life - and when he meets her again he'll get her to see it his
way. Don't you spoil the day's fishing.&quot;</p>

<p>Vernon laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;You have all the imagination of the greatest nation in the world,
Miss Voscoe,&quot; he said. &quot;Thank you. These straight talks to young men
are the salt of life. Good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You haven't all the obfuscation of the stupidest nation in the
world,&quot; she retorted. &quot;If you had had you'd have had a chance to find
out what straight talking means - which it's my belief you never have
yet. Good-bye. You take my tip. Either you go back to where you were
before you sighted Betty, or if the other one's sick of you too, just
shuffle the cards, take a fresh deal and start fair. You go home and
spend a quiet evening and think it all over.&quot;</p>

<p>Vernon went off laughing, and wondering why he didn't hate Miss
Voscoe. He did not laugh long. He sat in his studio, musing till
it was too late to go out to dine. Then he found some biscuits
and sherry - remnants of preparations for the call of a picture
dealer - ate and drank, and spent the evening in the way recommended
by Miss Voscoe. He lay face downward on the divan, in the dark, and
he did &quot;think it all over.&quot;</p>

<p>But first there was the long time when he lay quite still - did not
think at all, only remembered her hands and her eyes and her hair, and
the pretty way her brows lifted when she was surprised or
perplexed - and the four sudden sweet dimples that came near the
corners of her mouth when she was amused, and the way her mouth
drooped when she was tired.</p>

<p>&quot;I want you. I want you. I want you,&quot; said the man who had been the
Amorist. &quot;I want you, dear!&quot;</p>

<p>When he did begin to think, he moved uneasily in the dark as thought
after thought crept out and stung him and slunk away. The verses he
had written at Long Barton - ironic verses, written with the tongue in
the cheek - came back with the force of iron truth:</p>

<blockquote><div>&quot;I love you to my heart's hid core:<br />
   Those other loves? How can one learn<br />
   From marshlights how the great fires burn?<br />
Ah, no - I never loved before!&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>He had smiled at Temple's confidences - when Betty was at hand - to be
watched and guarded. Now Betty was away - anywhere. And Temple was
deciding whether it was she whom he loved. Suppose he did decide that
it was she, and, as Miss Voscoe had said, made her see it? &quot;Damn,&quot;
said Vernon, &quot;Oh, damn!&quot;</p>

<p>He was beginning to be a connoisseur in the fine flavours of the
different brands of jealousy. Anyway there was food for thought.</p>

<p>There was food for little else, in the days that followed. Mr.
Vernon's heart, hungry for the first time, had to starve. He went
often to Lady St. Craye's. She was so gentle, sweet, yet not too
sympathetic - bright, amusing even, but not too vivacious. He approved
deeply the delicacy with which she ignored that last wild interview.
She was sister, she was friend - and she had the rare merit of seeming
to forget that she had been confidante.</p>

<p>It was he who re-opened the subject, after ten days. She had told
herself that it was only a question of time. And it was.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know she's disappeared?&quot; he said abruptly.</p>

<p>&quot;<span style="text-decoration: underline">Disappeared</span>?&quot; No one was ever more astonished than Lady St. Craye.
Quite natural, the astonishment. Not overdone by so much as a hair's
breadth.</p>

<p>So he told her all about it, and she twisted her long topaz chain and
listened with exactly the right shade of interest. He told her what
Miss Voscoe had said - at least most of it.</p>

<p>&quot;And I worry about Temple,&quot; he said; &quot;like any school boy, I worry. If
he <span style="text-decoration: underline">does</span> decide that he loves her better than you - You said you'd
help me. Can't you make sure that he won't love her better?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I could, I suppose,&quot; she admitted. To herself she said: &quot;Temple's at
Grez. <span style="text-decoration: underline">She's</span> at Grez. They've been there ten days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If only you would,&quot; he said. &quot;It's too much to ask, I know. But I
can't ask anything that isn't too much! And you're so much more noble
and generous than other people - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No butter, thanks,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;It's the best butter,&quot; he earnestly urged. &quot;I mean that I mean it.
Won't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When I see him again - but it's not very fair to him, is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's an awfully good chap, you know,&quot; said Vernon innocently. And
once more Lady St. Craye bowed before the sublime apparition of the
Egoism of Man.</p>

<p>&quot;Good enough for me, you think? Well, perhaps you're right. He's a
dear boy. One would feel very safe if one loved a man like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes - wouldn't one?&quot; said Vernon.</p>

<p>She wondered whether Betty was feeling safe. No: ten days are a long
time, especially in the country - but it would take longer than that to
cure even a little imbecile like Betty of the Vernon habit. It was
worse than opium. Who ought to know if not she who sat, calm and
sympathetic, promising to entangle Temple so as to leave Betty free to
become a hopeless prey to the fell disease?</p>

<p>Quite suddenly and to her own intense surprise, she laughed out loud.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; his alert vanity bristled in the query.</p>

<p>&quot;It's nothing - only everything! Life's so futile! We pat and pinch our
little bit of clay, and look at it and love it and think it's going to
be a masterpiece. - and then God glances at it - and He doesn't like
the modelling, and He sticks his thumb down, and the whole thing's
broken up, and there's nothing left to do but throw away the bits.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; said Vernon; &quot;everything's bound to come right in the end.
It all works out straight somehow.&quot;</p>

<p>She laughed again.</p>

<p>&quot;Optimism - from you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not optimism,&quot; he asserted eagerly, &quot;it's only - well, if
everything doesn't come right somehow, somewhere, some day, what did
He bother to make the world for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's exactly what I said, my dear,&quot; said she. She permitted herself
the little endearment now and then with an ironical inflection, as one
fearful of being robbed might show a diamond pretending that it was
paste.</p>

<p>&quot;You think He made it for a joke?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If He did it's a joke in the worst possible taste,&quot; said she, &quot;but I
see your point of view. There can't be so very much wrong with a world
that has Her in it, - and you - and possibilities.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;I'm not at all sure that - Do you
remember the chap in Jane Eyre? - he knew quite well that that Rosamund
girl wouldn't make him the wife he wanted. Yet he wanted nothing else.
I don't want anything but her; and it doesn't make a scrap of
difference that I know exactly what sort of fool I am.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A knowledge of anatomy doesn't keep a broken bone from hurting,&quot; said
she, &quot;and all even you know about love won't keep off the heartache. I
could have told you that long ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know I'm a fool,&quot; he said, &quot;but I can't help it. Sometimes I think
I wouldn't help it if I could.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; she said, and something in her voice touched the trained
sensibilities of the Amorist. He stooped to kiss the hand that teased
the topazes.</p>

<p>&quot;Dear Jasmine Lady,&quot; he said, &quot;my optimism doesn't keep its colour
long, does it? Give me some tea, won't you? There's nothing so
wearing as emotion.&quot;</p>

<p>She gave him tea.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a sort of judgment on you, though,&quot; was what she gave him with
his first cup: &quot;you've dealt out this very thing to so many
women, - and now it's come home to roost.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't know what a fearful wildfowl it was,&quot; he answered smiling.
&quot;I swear I didn't. I begin to think I never knew anything at all
before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And yet they say Love's blind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And so he is! That's just it. My exotic flower of optimism withers at
your feet. It's all exactly the muddle you say it is. Pray Heaven for
a clear way out! Meantime thank whatever gods may be - I've got <span style="text-decoration: underline">you</span>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Monsieur's confidante is always at his distinguished service,&quot; she
said. And thus sealed the fountain of confidences for that day.</p>

<p>But it broke forth again and again in the days that came after. For
now he saw her almost every day. And for her, to be with him, to know
that she had of him more of everything, save the heart, than any other
woman, spelled something wonderfully like happiness. More like it than
she had the art to spell in any other letters.</p>

<p>Vernon still went twice a week to the sketch-club. To have stayed away
would have been to confess, to the whole alert and interested class,
that he had only gone there for the sake of Betty.</p>

<p>Those afternoons were seasons of salutary torture.</p>

<p>He tried very hard to work, but, though he still remembered how a
paint brush should be handled, there seemed no good reason for using
one. He had always found his planned and cultivated emotions strongly
useful in forwarding his work. This undesired unrest mocked at work,
and at all the things that had made up the solid fabric of one's days.
The ways of love - he had called it love; it was a name like
another - had merely been a sort of dram-drinking. Such love was the
intoxicant necessary to transfigure life to the point where all
things, even work, look beautiful. Now he tasted the real draught. It
flooded his veins like fire and stung like poison. And it made work,
and all things else, look mean and poor and unimportant.</p>

<p>&quot;I want you - I want you - I want you,&quot; said Vernon to the vision with
the pretty kitten face, and the large gray eyes. &quot;I want you more than
everything in the world,&quot; he said, &quot;everything in the world put
together. Oh, come back to me - dear, dear, dear.&quot;</p>

<p>He was haunted without cease by the little poem he had written when he
was training himself to be in love with Betty:</p>

<blockquote><div>&quot;I love you to my heart's hid core:<br />
   Those other loves? How should one learn<br />
   From marshlights how the great fires burn?<br />
Ah, no - I never loved before!&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>&quot;Prophetic, I suppose,&quot; he said, &quot;though God knows I never meant it.
Any fool of a prophet must hit the bull's eye at least once in a life.
But there was a curious unanimity of prophecy about this. The aunt
warned me; that Conway woman warned me; the Jasmine Lady warned me.
And now it's happened,&quot; he told himself. &quot;And I who thought I knew all
about everything!&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Conway's name, moving through his thoughts, left the trail of a
new hope.</p>

<p>Next day he breakfasted at Montmartre.</p>

<p>The neatest little Cr&eacute;merie; white paint, green walls stenciled with
fat white geraniums. On each small table a vase of green Bruges ware
or Breton pottery holding not a crushed crowded bouquet, but one
single flower - a pink tulip, a pink carnation, a pink rose. On the
desk from behind which the Proprietress ruled her staff, enormous pink
peonies in a tall pot of Grez de Flandre.</p>

<p>Behind the desk Paula Conway, incredibly neat and business-like, her
black hair severely braided, her plain black gown fitting a figure
grown lean as any grey-hound's, her lace collar a marvel of fine
laundry work.</p>

<p>Dapper-waisted waitresses in black, with white aprons, served the
customers. Vernon was served by Madame herself. The clientele formed
its own opinion of the cause of this, her only such condescension.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, and how's trade?&quot; he asked over his asparagus.</p>

<p>&quot;Trade's beautiful,&quot; Paula answered, with the frank smile that Betty
had seen, only once or twice, and had loved very much: &quot;if trade will
only go on behaving like this for another six weeks my cruel creditor
will be paid every penny of the money that launched me.&quot;</p>

<p>Her eyes dwelt on him with candid affection.</p>

<p>&quot;Your cruel creditor's not in any hurry,&quot; he said. &quot;By the way, I
suppose you've not heard anything of Miss Desmond?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How could I? You know you made me write that she wasn't to write.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't <span style="text-decoration: underline">make</span> you write anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You approved. But anyway she hasn't my address. Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's gone away: and she also has left no address.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't think? - Oh, no - nothing <span style="text-decoration: underline">could</span> have happened to her!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; he hastened to say. &quot;I expect her father sent for her, or
fetched her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The best thing too,&quot; said Paula. &quot;I always wondered he let her come.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; - Vernon remembered how little Paula knew.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes, she's probably gone home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look here,&quot; said Miss Conway very earnestly; &quot;there wasn't any love
business between you and her, was there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he answered strongly.</p>

<p>&quot;I was always afraid of that. Do you know - if you don't mind, when
I've really paid my cruel creditor everything, I should like to write
and tell her what he's done for me. I should like her to know that she
really <span style="text-decoration: underline">did</span> save me - and how. Because if it hadn't been for her you'd
never have thought of helping me. Do you think I might?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It could do no harm,&quot; said Vernon after a silent moment. &quot;You'd
really like her to know you're all right. You <span style="text-decoration: underline">are</span> all right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm right; as I never thought I could be ever again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you needn't exaggerate the little services of your cruel
creditor. Come to think of it, you needn't name him. Just say it was a
man you knew.&quot;</p>

<p>But when Paula came to write the letter that was not just what she
said.</p>
