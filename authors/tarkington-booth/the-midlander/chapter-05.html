<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p><em>DAN </em>walked home from his grandmother’s with the wind
blowing a fine snow against his chest, within which something
seemed to be displaced and painful. Higher up, under the cold
sleek band of his tall hat, there was a stricken puzzlement; and
no doubt he was in hard case. For a young lover rebuffed upon
speaking of his sweetheart is like a fine artist who has made
some fragile, exquisite thing and offers it confidently in tender
pride, only to see it buffeted and misprized. To Dan it seemed
as though Lena herself had been injuriously mishandled, whereas
the injury fell really upon something much more delicate; the
lovely image he had made for himself and thought was Lena—an angelic
substance most different from the substance of that "little brunette"
herself.</p>

<p>He told himself that his grandmother had increased in unreasonableness
with increasing age, but in spite of all efforts to reassure himself,
and notwithstanding her prediction that he would receive a foolish
support from his parents in the matter of his engagement, it was
decidedly without jauntiness that he made his announcement to
them after dinner that evening.</p>

<p>He found them in the library, a shadowy big room where the fire
of soft coal twinkled again upon polished dark woodwork, upon
the clear glass doors of the bookcases, and touched with rose
the eye-glasses and the shining oval façade of Harlan’s shirt
as he sat reading Suetonius under a tall lamp in the bay window.
Harlan, unlike his father and his brother, always "dressed" for
dinner.</p>

<p>He was the thinner and perhaps an inch the shorter of the two
brothers; but in spite of their actual likeness of contour, people
who knew them most intimately sometimes maintained that there
was not even an outward resemblance, so sharp was the contrast
in manner and expression. It was Martha Shelby who said that if
Harlan had been a year shipwrecked and naked on a savage isle
he would still look fastidious and wear "that same old ‘How-vulgar-everything-seems-to-be!’
expression." Tramps approaching Harlan on the street to beg a
dime from him usually decided at the last moment to pass on in
philosophic silence.</p>

<p>He was no more like the two handsome, gray-haired people who
sat by the library fire, that evening, than he was like his brother.
Mr. Oliphant, genial and absent-minded, was the very man of whom
any beggar would make sure at first sight; and he was without
an important accumulation of fortune now, in fact, because venturous
friends of his had too often made sure of him to go on a note
or to forestall a bankruptcy that eventually failed to be forestalled.
His wife was not the guardian to save him from a disastrous generosity;
she was the most ready woman in the world to be recklessly kind,
and when kindness brought losses she kept as sunny a heart as
her husband did.</p>

<p>Mrs. Savage was right: from this pair no discipline for the good
of their son’s future need have been expected, although her own
effect upon him had been so severe that he began his announcement
in the library with a defensive formality that denoted apprehension.
His formality, moreover, was elaborate enough to be considered
intricate, with the result that his surprised listeners were at
first not quite certain of his meaning.</p>

<p>His father withdrew slippered feet from close intimacy with the
brass fender enclosing the hearth, stared whimsically at his son,
and inquired: "What is it all about, Dan?"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"It doesn’t quite penetrate," Mr. Oliphant informed him. "You
seem to be making an address, but I’m not secure as to its drift.
I gather that you believe something about there coming a time
in a young man’s life when his happiness depends upon an important
step, and you’d hate to be deprived of something or other. You
said something, too, about a union. It didn’t seem to connect
with labour questions, so I’m puzzled. Could you clarify my mind?"</p>

<p>Harlan, resting his book in his lap, laughed dryly and proffered
a suggestion: "It sounds to me, sir, as if he might possibly mean
a union with a damsel of marriageable age and propensities."</p>

<p>"Dan!" the mother cried. "Is that what you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes’m," he said meekly. "I wanted to tell you last night, but—well,
anyway it’s so. She’s the most splendid, noblest, finest girl
I ever met, and I know you’ll think so, too. Here—well, here’s
her picture." And he handed the blue case to Mrs. Oliphant.</p>

<p>"Why, Dan!" she said, suddenly tearful, as she took the case
and held it open before her.</p>

<p>Her husband, not speaking, got up quickly, came behind her and
looked over her shoulder at the photograph of Lena. Then after
a moment he looked at Dan, but for a time seemed to be uncertain
about what he ought to say. "She’s—ah—she’s pretty enough, Dan,"
he said finally, in his kind voice. "She’s certainly pretty enough
for us to understand your getting this way about her."</p>

<p>"Yes, Dan," his mother agreed. "She—she’s quite pretty. I’m sure
she’s pretty."</p>

<p>"She’s beautiful!" Dan declared huskily. "She’s beautiful, and
she’s more than that; she has a character that’s perfect. She
has an absolutely perfect character, mother."</p>

<p>"I hope so," Mrs. Oliphant said gently, bending her head above
the blue case. "After all, you can’t tell everything from a photograph."
She looked up at her husband as if arguing with him. "You <em>can’t</em>
tell much from a photograph."</p>

<p>"No," he assented readily. "Of course you can’t. In fact, you
can tell very little; but you can see this is a pretty girl, anyhow.
I expect you’d better tell us a little more about her, Dan."</p>

<p>Dan complied. That is to say, he did his best to make them comprehend
Lena’s perfection; and, touching lightly upon her descent from
that somewhat shadowy figure in heroic antiquity, General McMillan—Dan
felt sensitive for the general since Mrs. Savage’s suggestion
about the Knights of Pythias—he kept as much as possible to the
subject of Lena herself, and ended by declaring rather oratorically
that she had just the qualities he had always admired in the noblest
women.</p>

<p>"I do hope so, Dan dear," his mother said, her eyes still shining
with tears in the firelight. "I do hope so!"</p>

<p>"Yes," Mr. Oliphant agreed, "I hope so, too, Dan; and anyhow,
if you’ve cared enough about her to ask her to marry you, that’s
the main thing. You can be sure your mother and father will do
their best to be fond of anybody you’re fond of."</p>

<p>"But she <em>has</em> those qualities, father," Dan said, not
quite sure, himself, why he seemed to be insisting upon this in
a tone so plaintively argumentative. "Indeed she has! She has
just exactly the qualities I’ve always admired in the noblest
women I’ve ever known."</p>

<p>"In grandma, for instance?" Harlan inquired.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You said she had just the qualities you’ve observed in the noblest
women. Well, grandma has noble qualities. I was wondering——"</p>

<p>"No," Dan said, swallowing. "Lena—well, she’s different."</p>

<p>"If she has the qualities that will help you in building your
future," Mrs. Oliphant said, "that will be enough for us."</p>

<p>"She has, mother. Those are just exactly the qualities she’s
got. Don’t you think when—when——" He faltered, obviously in timidity,
and glanced nervously at the observant Harlan.</p>

<p>"When what, dear?"</p>

<p>"Well, when—when a wife’s an—an inspiration," he said, gulping
the word out;—"well, isn’t that just everything?"</p>

<p>"Of course, dear," Mrs. Oliphant said comfortingly. Then, when
she had touched her eyes with her lace-edged little handkerchief,
she spoke more briskly. "This will be quite exciting news for
your grandmother, Dan. Poor dear woman! She’s been waiting so
anxiously for you to come home; and she’s grown so frail these
last few months; she kept saying she was afraid she wouldn’t last
till you got here. She’s devoted to Harlan, of course, but I think
you’ve always been a little her favourite, Dan."</p>

<p>"A little?" Harlan repeated serenely. "She really doesn’t like
me at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she does," his mother protested. "She’s devoted to
you, too, but she——"</p>

<p>"No," Harlan interrupted quietly; "she’s never liked me. I have
no doubt when her will is read you’ll find it out."</p>

<p>But upon this his father intervened cheerfully. "Let’s don’t
talk about her will just yet," he said. "She’s going to be with
us a long time, we hope. Dan, you’d better go and tell her your
news to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I did, sir. I went this afternoon."</p>

<p>"What did she say?"</p>

<p>Dan passed his hand across his forehead. "Well—she—well, I told
her about it and—well, you know how she <em>is</em>, sir. She—isn’t
apt to get enthusiastic about hardly anything. She seemed to think—well,
one thing she seemed to think was that I’m sort of young to be
gettin’ married."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe," said his father. "Maybe she’s right."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I don’t believe so. You see grandma is almost ninety-three.
Why, to a person of that age almost anybody else looks pretty
young. You see, it isn’t so much I <em>am</em> young; it’s only
I look young to grandma."</p>

<p>But upon this argument, delivered in a tone most hopeful of convincing,
Mr. Oliphant laughed outright. "So that’s the way of it!" he exclaimed,
and, returning to his seat by the fire, again extended his feet
to the fender. "Well, whether you’re really a little too young
or only appear so, on account of your grandmother’s advanced age,
we have to face the fact that you’ve asked this young lady to
marry you, and she’s said she will. When that’s happened, all
the old folks can do is to make the best of it. You know we’ll
do that, don’t you, son?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Dan said a little bleakly. "I knew you would." He
took the blue case from his mother’s lap, and kissed her as she
looked pathetically up at him; then he moved toward the door.
"I—I always knew I could count on you and mother, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, Dan," Mrs. Oliphant murmured, "you know you can."</p>

<p>And her husband, from his chair by the fireside, echoed this
with a heartiness that was somewhat husky: "Yes, indeed, Dan.
If the young lady is necessary to your happiness——"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Why, we’ll just try to say, ‘God bless you both,’ my boy."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Dan returned, with an inadequacy that he seemed to
feel, himself, for he lingered near the doorway some moments more,
coughed in a futile and unnecessary manner, then said feebly:
"Well—well, thank you," and retired slowly to his own room.</p>

<p>When his steps were no longer heard ascending the broad stairway,
the sound of a quick sob, too impulsive to be smothered, was heard
in the silent library, and Mr. Oliphant turned to stare at his
wife. "Well, what’s the matter?" he said. "I told you, you can’t
tell anything from a photograph, didn’t I?"</p>

<p>She pressed her handkerchief to her eyes and shook her head,
offering no other response.</p>

<p>Thereupon he struck the poker into the fire, badgered a lump
of coal, and said gruffly: "It’s all nonsense! She may turn out
to be the finest girl in the world. How can you tell anything
from a photograph?"</p>

<p>"You can’t much," the serene Harlan agreed. He spoke from his
easy-chair in the bay window, whither he had returned from an
unemotional excursion to the blue leather case when it was exhibited.
"You can see, though, that Dan’s young person is perfect, as he
said, in several ways."</p>

<p>"Think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she’s perfectly <em>à la mode</em>; she’s perfectly pretty—and
perfectly what we usually call shallow."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don’t know."</p>

<p>"Don’t you?" Harlan asked, with a slight amusement, and added
reflectively: "Martha Shelby won’t like this much, I dare say."</p>

<p>"No," Mrs. Oliphant said faintly. "Poor Martha!"</p>

<p>"Oh, look here!" her husband remonstrated. "What’s the use of
all this? You’re acting as if we were facing a calamity. Dan’s
got a mighty good head on his shoulders; he wouldn’t fall in love
with a mere little goose. Besides, didn’t I ask you: ‘What can
you tell from a photograph?’"</p>

<p>"Not everything, sir," Harlan interposed. "But you can usually
get an idea of the type of person it’s a photograph of."</p>

<p>"Yes, you can," Mrs. Oliphant said. "That’s what frightens me.
She doesn’t seem the type that would want to take care of him
when he’s sick and be interested in his business and help him.
She might even be the type that wouldn’t like living here, after
New York, and would get to complaining and want to take him away.
Of course it <em>is</em> true we can’t tell from that photograph,
though."</p>

<p>"Can’t you?" Harlan asked with a short laugh. "Then why are you
so disturbed by it?"</p>

<p>"That’s sense," his father said approvingly. "If you can’t tell
anything about her, what’s the sense of worrying?"</p>

<p>"It doesn’t appear that you got my point, sir," Harlan remarked.
"You and mother are both disturbed because you <em>have</em> drawn
certain conclusions."</p>

<p>"From that picture?"</p>

<p>"I think so, sir."</p>

<p>"You’re talking nonsense," Mr. Oliphant returned testily. "Nobody
can tell anything at all from a photograph. Not a thing!"</p>

<p>"No," Mrs. Oliphant agreed, wiping her eyes again. "I hope not.
I mean I’m <em>sure</em> not."</p>

<p>"That’s right," said her husband heartily. "That’s the way to
look at it."</p>

<p>"Yes; isn’t it!" said the sardonic Harlan, as he resumed his
reading; and for a time the library was given over to a reflective
silence;—the ceiling, fifteen feet from the floor, was too solid
a structure for the pacing that had begun overhead to be heard
below.</p>

<p>Up and down his room Dan walked and walked. In the few contemporary
novels that he had read the hero’s acceptance by a beautiful girl
implied general happiness on earth; all the difficulties of mankind
seemed to disappear with the happy elimination of those of this
favourite twain. Moreover, when friends of his had become engaged
there was always joviality; there were congratulations and eager
gayeties; there were friendly chaffings from the old stock of
jokes on the shelves that afford generation after generation supplies
of such humour. Sometimes, as he was growing up, he had thought
vaguely of the time when he would be telling people of his own
engagement; he had made in his mind momentary sketches of himself,
proud, happy, laughing, and a little embarrassed, in a circle
of his relatives and friends who would be clamorous with loud
felicitations and jocose inquiries. This very vision had come
to him on his journey home so vividly that he had chuckled aloud
suddenly, in his berth at night, surprising and somewhat abashing
himself with the sound.</p>

<p>The picture had not been a successful prophecy he perceived as
he walked up and down in his dressing-gown and slippers. Something
appeared to have gone wrong somewhere in a mysterious way; and
he could not understand what it was, could only pace and grieve,
and puzzle himself. Even his talk with Martha Shelby had lacked
the stimulating gayety he expected, though she had been "mighty
sweet and sympathetic," as he thought; and as for the interview
with his grandmother, he must simply try to forget that! So he
told himself, and shivered abruptly, recalling the awfulness of
her parting instructions. His mother and father had been kind—"just
lovely"—but with them, too, something important had been lacking;
he could not think why; and so walked and walked without much
satisfaction or relief.</p>

<p>An hour after he had left the library there was a knock on his
door; and he opened this tall and heavily panelled walnut barrier
to admit his father, who looked a little worried.</p>

<p>"Dan," he said, coming in;—"I’m afraid I’ve got to get you to
do something that won’t be much fun for you."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Your aunt Olive’s just telephoned me she’s in a little trouble
to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Dan repeated. His aunt Olive, his father’s widowed
sister-in-law, was often in a little trouble of one kind or another,
and the Oliphant family had learned to expect a call for help
when she telephoned to them. "Yes, sir. Does she want me?"</p>

<p>"Guess she does," his father said. "Both the children took sick
at the same time yesterday morning, she says. Mabel seems to be
getting along all right, but Charlie’s in a high fever. You see
there’s an epidemic of la grippe all over town—that’s what’s the
matter with ’em, the doctor thinks; but so many people have got
it she can’t find a nurse to save her life. Says she’s hunted
high and low and there simply isn’t one to be had, and it seems
Charlie’s delirious; and he’s strong, for fourteen; it’s hard
to keep him in bed. I offered to go myself, but she said she’d
heard you were back in town, so she wondered if you wouldn’t come
over and sit up with him just a night or so until she——"</p>

<p>"You tell her I’ll be right there." Dan had thrown off his dressing-gown
and was in a chair, drawing on a shoe. "Tell her——"</p>

<p>"I told her so. You needn’t break your neck getting over there,
Dan. I don’t think there’s any particular hurry. She just said——"</p>

<p>"I know, sir. She gets scared about Charlie mighty easy; but
still I might as well move along, I guess," Dan said, and continued
the hurried resumption of his clothes.</p>

<p>His father stood watching him, and seemed to be a little troubled,
showing a tendency toward apologetic embarrassment. "Oh—ah, Dan——"
he said, and paused.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"I—ah—we—don’t want you to think——"</p>

<p>"Think what, sir?"</p>

<p>"Why, about your young lady—you took us by surprise, Dan. We
weren’t looking for what you told us, and so it took your mother
and me a little bit off our feet, as it were, Dan."</p>

<p>"I—I suppose so," Dan said. "I expect I didn’t go about it with
any intelligence in particular, likely. I expect I ought to have——"</p>

<p>"No, no. <em>You</em> were all right, Dan. Only as we weren’t
just looking for it, we’ve been afraid we didn’t seem as hearty
about it as we should have."</p>

<p>"Oh, that’s all right." Dan was embarrassed in his turn. "You
were—you were both just lovely about it, sir. I didn’t expect—I
mean, it isn’t the kind of thing there’s any call for you and
mother to make a big jollification and fuss over. I wasn’t expectin’
anything like that."</p>

<p>"No," his father said thoughtfully, "I suppose not. Only we’ve
been afraid you might have been a little disappointed in the quiet
way we took it."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir!"</p>

<p>"Well, I hope not. And anyway, Dan, we <em>are</em> glad about
it, if you’re sure you are."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Thank you."</p>

<p>"And we want you to know we’re <em>with</em> you, Dan. We’re
with you and for you, and we stand by you," Mr. Oliphant continued;
then paused, and concluded with a haste not altogether fortunate—"whatever
happens."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Dan said, seeming to flinch a little, though meekly;
and his father at once added an amendment to the awkward phrase.</p>

<p>"Of course, we think only the pleasantest things will happen,
Dan. And we want you to understand that this house must be home
for anybody that belongs to you as much as it is for the rest
of us. You know we feel that way, don’t you, son?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I do hope to bring her here, if you’ll let me. I’ve
been thinkin’ about it a great deal, and I believe this town is
my town"—Dan flushed a little as he spoke—"and I want to prove
it, and I want Lena to learn to feel about it the way I do. I
believe she’d miss something out of her life if she didn’t. And
I want you all to learn what a noble girl she is. I know you will,
father."</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" Mr. Oliphant took his son’s hand and shook
it. "We didn’t happen to say it downstairs, but we do congratulate
you, Dan. As far as anybody can tell from a photograph"—he paused
again here, then finished with a great heartiness of voice—"why,
as far as you can tell from that, why, she looks like—she looks
like a mighty pretty girl."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Dan smiled with a little constraint. "There’s something
else I want to talk over with you when we get time enough. I’ve
got hold of a big idea, father."</p>

<p>"Have you, my boy?"</p>

<p>"It’s about our future," Dan said nervously. "I mean Lena’s and
mine." He hesitated, then went on: "I expect it sounds like big
talk from a little man, but I believe it’s goin’ to be a great
thing for the future of our city, too."</p>

<p>Upon this his father’s expression of friendly concern became
complicated by evidences of a slight inward struggle, but he was
able to respond with sufficient gravity: "Do you, Dan? What is
it?"</p>

<p>"It’s an idea for a big development, sir. I mean a development
in the way this city’s commenced to grow."</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>"I guess I better tell you another time, sir; it’s got lots of
details, and I’m afraid I ought to be gettin’ on over to Aunt
Olive’s now, sir."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," Mr. Oliphant said, relinquishing his son’s hand.
"I only wanted to say—about your engagement—it’s all right with
us, old fellow, and we just hope <em>we’ll</em> be all right with
<em>her</em>."</p>

<p>Dan was touched. His father spoke with feeling, and the young
man could not trust his eyes to be seen. He hurried out into the
spacious upper hall, not looking back, though he said: "Yes, sir;
thank you," in a choked voice. Then, when he was halfway down
the stairs, he called cheerfully: "I’ll let you know to-morrow
morning if there’s anything much the matter with young Charlie.
I’ll be home for breakfast, anyway, and I’ll tell you about my
idea then, too. It’s goin’ to be a mighty big thing, father!"</p>

<p>"I hope so, my boy," Mr. Oliphant returned; and although there
was moisture in his own eyes, he had difficulty in restraining,
until the front door closed, a tendency to laughter. </p>
