1. MODERN RELIGION A POLITICAL RELIGION
<P>
<P>
The conception of a young and energetic God, an Invisible Prince 
growing in strength and wisdom, who calls men and women to his 
service and who gives salvation from self and mortality only through 
self-abandonment to his service, necessarily involves a demand for a 
complete revision and fresh orientation of the life of the convert.
<P>
God faces the blackness of the Unknown and the blind joys and 
confusions and cruelties of Life, as one who leads mankind through a 
dark jungle to a great conquest.  He brings mankind not rest but a 
sword.  It is plain that he can admit no divided control of the 
world he claims.  He concedes nothing to Caesar.  In our philosophy 
there are no human things that are God's and others that are 
Caesar's.  Those of the new thought cannot render unto God the 
things that are God's, and to Caesar the things that are Caesar's.  
Whatever claim Caesar may make to rule men's lives and direct their 
destinies outside the will of God, is a usurpation.  No king nor 
Caesar has any right to tax or to service or to tolerance, except he 
claim as one who holds for and under God.  And he must make good his 
claim.  The steps of the altar of the God of Youth are no safe place 
for the sacrilegious figure of a king.  Who claims "divine right" 
plays with the lightning.
<P>
The new conceptions do not tolerate either kings or aristocracies or 
democracies.  Its implicit command to all its adherents is to make 
plain the way to the world theocracy.  Its rule of life is the 
discovery and service of the will of God, which dwells in the hearts 
of men, and the performance of that will, not only in the private 
life of the believer but in the acts and order of the state and 
nation of which he is a part.  I give myself to God not only because 
I am so and so but because I am mankind.  I become in a measure 
responsible for every evil in the world of men.  I become a knight 
in God's service.  I become my brother's keeper.  I become a 
responsible minister of my King.  I take sides against injustice, 
disorder, and against all those temporal kings, emperors, princes, 
landlords, and owners, who set themselves up against God's rule and 
worship.  Kings, owners, and all who claim rule and decisions in the 
world's affairs, must either show themselves clearly the fellow-
servants of the believer or become the objects of his steadfast 
antagonism.
<P>
<P>
<P>
2. THE WILL OF GOD
<P>
<P>
It is here that those who explain this modern religiosity will seem 
most arbitrary to the inquirer.  For they relate of God, as men will 
relate of a close friend, his dispositions, his apparent intentions, 
the aims of his kingship.  And just as they advance no proof 
whatever of the existence of God but their realisation of him, so 
with regard to these qualities and dispositions they have little 
argument but profound conviction.  What they say is this; that if 
you do not feel God then there is no persuading you of him; we 
cannot win over the incredulous.  And what they say of his qualities 
is this; that if you feel God then you will know, you will realise 
more and more clearly, that thus and thus and no other is his method 
and intention.
<P>
It comes as no great shock to those who have grasped the full 
implications of the statement that God is Finite, to hear it 
asserted that the first purpose of God is the attainment of clear 
knowledge, of knowledge as a means to more knowledge, and of 
knowledge as a means to power.  For that he must use human eyes and 
hands and brains.
<P>
And as God gathers power he uses it to an end that he is only 
beginning to apprehend, and that he will apprehend more fully as 
time goes on.  But it is possible to define the broad outlines of 
the attainment he seeks.  It is the conquest of death.
<P>
It is the conquest of death; first the overcoming of death in the 
individual by the incorporation of the motives of his life into an 
undying purpose, and then the defeat of that death that seems to 
threaten our species upon a cooling planet beneath a cooling sun.  
God fights against death in every form, against the great death of 
the race, against the petty death of indolence, insufficiency, 
baseness, misconception, and perversion.  He it is and no other who 
can deliver us "from the body of this death."  This is the battle 
that grows plainer; this is the purpose to which he calls us out of 
the animal's round of eating, drinking, lusting, quarrelling and 
laughing and weeping, fearing and failing, and presently of wearying 
and dying, which is the whole life that living without God can give 
us.  And from these great propositions there follow many very 
definite maxims and rules of life for those who serve God.  These we 
will immediately consider.
<P>
<P>
<P>
3. THE CRUCIFIX
<P>
<P>
But first let me write a few words here about those who hold a kind 
of intermediate faith between the worship of the God of Youth and 
the vaguer sort of Christianity.  There are a number of people 
closely in touch with those who have found the new religion who, 
biased probably by a dread of too complete a break with 
Christianity, have adopted a theogony which is very reminiscent of 
Gnosticism and of the Paulician, Catharist, and kindred sects to 
which allusion has already been made.  He, who is called in this 
book God, they would call God-the-Son or Christ, or the Logos; and 
what is here called the Darkness or the Veiled Being, they would 
call God-the-Father.  And what we speak of here as Life, they would 
call, with a certain disregard of the poor brutes that perish, Man.  
And they would assert, what we of the new belief, pleading our 
profound ignorance, would neither assert nor deny, that that 
Darkness, out of which came Life and God, since it produced them 
must be ultimately sympathetic and of like nature with them.  And 
that ultimately Man, being redeemed and led by Christ and saved from 
death by him, would be reconciled with God the Father.*  And this 
great adventurer out of the hearts of man that we here call God, 
they would present as the same with that teacher from Galilee who 
was crucified at Jerusalem.
<P>
* This probably was the conception of Spinoza.  Christ for him is 
the wisdom of God manifested in all things, and chiefly in the mind 
of man.  Through him we reach the blessedness of an intuitive 
knowledge of God.  Salvation is an escape from the "inadequate" 
ideas of the mortal human personality to the "adequate" and timeless 
ideas of God.
<P>
Now we of the modern way would offer the following criticisms upon 
this apparent compromise between our faith and the current religion.  
Firstly, we do not presume to theorise about the nature of the 
veiled being nor about that being's relations to God and to Life.  
We do not recognise any consistent sympathetic possibilities between 
these outer beings and our God.  Our God is, we feel, like 
Prometheus, a rebel.  He is unfilial.  And the accepted figure of 
Jesus, instinct with meek submission, is not in the tone of our 
worship.  It is not by suffering that God conquers death, but by 
fighting.  Incidentally our God dies a million deaths, but the thing 
that matters is not the deaths but the immortality.  It may be he 
cannot escape in this person or that person being nailed to a cross 
or chained to be torn by vultures on a rock.  These may be necessary 
sufferings, like hunger and thirst in a campaign; they do not in 
themselves bring victory.  They may be necessary, but they are not 
glorious.  The symbol of the crucifixion, the drooping, pain-
drenched figure of Christ, the sorrowful cry to his Father, "My God, 
my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" these things jar with our 
spirit.  We little men may well fail and repent, but it is our faith 
that our God does not fail us nor himself.  We cannot accept the 
Christian's crucifix, or pray to a pitiful God.  We cannot accept 
the Resurrection as though it were an after-thought to a bitterly 
felt death.  Our crucifix, if you must have a crucifix, would show 
God with a hand or a foot already torn away from its nail, and with 
eyes not downcast but resolute against the sky; a face without pain, 
pain lost and forgotten in the surpassing glory of the struggle and 
the inflexible will to live and prevail. . . .
<P>
But we do not care how long the thorns are drawn, nor how terrible 
the wounds, so long as he does not droop.  God is courage.  God is 
courage beyond any conceivable suffering.
<P>
But when all this has been said, it is well to add that it concerns 
the figure of Christ only in so far as that professes to be the 
figure of God, and the crucifix only so far as that stands for 
divine action.  The figure of Christ crucified, so soon as we think 
of it as being no more than the tragic memorial of Jesus, of the man 
who proclaimed the loving-kindness of God and the supremacy of God's 
kingdom over the individual life, and who, in the extreme agony of 
his pain and exhaustion, cried out that he was deserted, becomes 
something altogether distinct from a theological symbol.  
Immediately that we cease to worship, we can begin to love and pity.  
Here was a being of extreme gentleness and delicacy and of great 
courage, of the utmost tolerance and the subtlest sympathy, a saint 
of non-resistance. . . .
<P>
We of the new faith repudiate the teaching of non-resistance.  We 
are the militant followers of and participators in a militant God.  
We can appreciate and admire the greatness of Christ, this gentle 
being upon whose nobility the theologians trade.  But submission is 
the remotest quality of all from our God, and a moribund figure is 
the completest inversion of his likeness as we know him.  A 
Christianity which shows, for its daily symbol, Christ risen and 
trampling victoriously upon a broken cross, would be far more in the 
spirit of our worship.*
<P>
* It is curious, after writing the above, to find in a letter 
written by Foss Westcott, Bishop of Durham, to that pertinacious 
correspondent, the late Lady Victoria Welby, almost exactly the same 
sentiments I have here expressed.  "If I could fill the Crucifix 
with life as you do," he says, "I would gladly look on it, but the 
fallen Head and the closed Eye exclude from my thought the idea of 
glorified humanity.  The Christ to whom we are led is One who 'hath 
been crucified,' who hath passed the trial victoriously and borne 
the fruits to heaven.  I dare not then rest on this side of the 
glory."
<P>
I find, too, a still more remarkable expression of the modern spirit 
in a tract, "The Call of the Kingdom," by that very able and subtle, 
Anglican theologian, the Rev. W. Temple, who declares that under the 
vitalising stresses of the war we are winning "faith in Christ as an 
heroic leader.  We have thought of Him so much as meek and gentle 
that there is no ground in our picture of Him, for the vision which 
His disciple had of Him: 'His head and His hair were white, as white 
wool, white as snow; and His eyes were as a flame of fire: and His 
feet like unto burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a 
furnace; and His voice was as the voice of many waters.  And He had 
in His right hand seven stars; and out of His mouth proceeded a 
sharp two-edged sword; and His countenance was as the sun shineth in 
its strength.'"
<P>
These are both exceptional utterances, interesting as showing how 
clearly parallel are the tendencies within and without Christianity.
<P>
<P>
<P>
4. THE PRIMARY DUTIES
<P>
<P>
Now it follows very directly from the conception of God as a finite 
intelligence of boundless courage and limitless possibilities of 
growth and victory, who has pitted himself against death, who stands 
close to our inmost beings ready to receive us and use us, to rescue 
us from the chagrins of egotism and take us into his immortal 
adventure, that we who have realised him and given ourselves 
joyfully to him, must needs be equally ready and willing to give our 
energies to the task we share with him, to do our utmost to increase 
knowledge, to increase order and clearness, to fight against 
indolence, waste, disorder, cruelty, vice, and every form of his and 
our enemy, death, first and chiefest in ourselves but also in all 
mankind, and to bring about the establishment of his real and 
visible kingdom throughout the world.
<P>
And that idea of God as the Invisible King of the whole world means 
not merely that God is to be made and declared the head of the 
world, but that the kingdom of God is to be present throughout the 
whole fabric of the world, that the Kingdom of God is to be in the 
teaching at the village school, in the planning of the railway 
siding of the market town, in the mixing of the mortar at the 
building of the workman's house.  It means that ultimately no effigy 
of intrusive king or emperor is to disfigure our coins and stamps 
any more; God himself and no delegate is to be represented wherever 
men buy or sell, on our letters and our receipts, a perpetual 
witness, a perpetual reminder.  There is no act altogether without 
significance, no power so humble that it may not be used for or 
against God, no life but can orient itself to him.  To realise God 
in one's heart is to be filled with the desire to serve him, and the 
way of his service is neither to pull up one's life by the roots nor 
to continue it in all its essentials unchanged, but to turn it 
about, to turn everything that there is in it round into his way.
<P>
The outward duty of those who serve God must vary greatly with the 
abilities they possess and the positions in which they find 
themselves, but for all there are certain fundamental duties; a 
constant attempt to be utterly truthful with oneself, a constant 
sedulousness to keep oneself fit and bright for God's service, and 
to increase one's knowledge and powers, and a hidden persistent 
watchfulness of one's baser motives, a watch against fear and 
indolence, against vanity, against greed and lust, against envy, 
malice, and uncharitableness.  To have found God truly does in 
itself make God's service one's essential motive, but these evils 
lurk in the shadows, in the lassitudes and unwary moments.  No one 
escapes them altogether, there is no need for tragic moods on 
account of imperfections.  We can no more serve God without blunders 
and set-backs than we can win battles without losing men.  But the 
less of such loss the better.  The servant of God must keep his mind 
as wide and sound and his motives as clean as he can, just as an 
operating surgeon must keep his nerves and muscles as fit and his 
hands as clean as he can.  Neither may righteously evade exercise 
and regular washing--of mind as of hands.  An incessant watchfulness 
of one's self and one's thoughts and the soundness of one's 
thoughts; cleanliness, clearness, a wariness against indolence and 
prejudice, careful truth, habitual frankness, fitness and steadfast 
work; these are the daily fundamental duties that every one who 
truly comes to God will, as a matter of course, set before himself.
<P>
<P>
<P>
5. THE INCREASING KINGDOM
<P>
<P>
Now of the more intimate and personal life of the believer it will 
be more convenient to write a little later.  Let us for the present 
pursue the idea of this world-kingdom of God, to whose establishment 
he calls us.  This kingdom is to be a peaceful and co-ordinated 
activity of all mankind upon certain divine ends.  These, we 
conceive, are first, the maintenance of the racial life; secondly, 
the exploration of the external being of nature as it is and as it 
has been, that is to say history and science; thirdly, that 
exploration of inherent human possibility which is art; fourthly, 
that clarification of thought and knowledge which is philosophy; and 
finally, the progressive enlargement and development of the racial 
life under these lights, so that God may work through a continually 
better body of humanity and through better and better equipped 
minds, that he and our race may increase for ever, working 
unendingly upon the development of the powers of life and the 
mastery of the blind forces of matter throughout the deeps of space.  
He sets out with us, we are persuaded, to conquer ourselves and our 
world and the stars.  And beyond the stars our eyes can as yet see 
nothing, our imaginations reach and fail.  Beyond the limits of our 
understanding is the veiled Being of Fate, whose face is hidden from 
us. . . .
<P>
It may be that minds will presently appear among us of such a 
quality that the face of that Unknown will not be altogether 
hidden. . . .
<P>
But the business of such ordinary lives as ours is the setting up of 
this earthly kingdom of God.  That is the form into which our lives 
must fall and our consciences adapt themselves.
<P>
Belief in God as the Invisible King brings with it almost 
necessarily a conception of this coming kingdom of God on earth.  
Each believer as he grasps this natural and immediate consequence of 
the faith that has come into his life will form at the same time a 
Utopian conception of this world changed in the direction of God's 
purpose.  The vision will follow the realisation of God's true 
nature and purpose as a necessary second step.  And he will begin to 
develop the latent citizen of this world-state in himself.  He will 
fall in with the idea of the world-wide sanities of this new order 
being drawn over the warring outlines of the present, and of men 
falling out of relationship with the old order and into relationship 
with the new.  Many men and women are already working to-day at 
tasks that belong essentially to God's kingdom, tasks that would be 
of the same essential nature if the world were now a theocracy; for 
example, they are doing or sustaining scientific research or 
education or creative art; they are making roads to bring men 
together, they are doctors working for the world's health, they are 
building homes, they are constructing machinery to save and increase 
the powers of men. . . .
<P>
Such men and women need only to change their orientation as men will 
change about at a work-table when the light that was coming in a 
little while ago from the southern windows, begins presently to come 
in chiefly from the west, to become open and confessed servants of 
God.  This work that they were doing for ambition, or the love of 
men or the love of knowledge or what seemed the inherent impulse to 
the work itself, or for money or honour or country or king, they 
will realise they are doing for God and by the power of God.  Self-
transformation into a citizen of God's kingdom and a new realisation 
of all earthly politics as no more than the struggle to define and 
achieve the kingdom of God in the earth, follow on, without any need 
for a fresh spiritual impulse, from the moment when God and the 
believer meet and clasp one another.
<P>
This transfiguration of the world into a theocracy may seem a merely 
fantastic idea to anyone who comes to it freshly without such 
general theological preparation as the preceding pages have made.  
But to anyone who has been at the pains to clear his mind even a 
little from the obsession of existing but transitory things, it 
ceases to be a mere suggestion and becomes more and more manifestly 
the real future of mankind.  From the phase of "so things should 
be," the mind will pass very rapidly to the realisation that "so 
things will be."  Towards this the directive wills among men have 
been drifting more and more steadily and perceptibly and with fewer 
eddyings and retardations, for many centuries.  The purpose of 
mankind will not be always thus confused and fragmentary.  This 
dissemination of will-power is a phase.  The age of the warring 
tribes and kingdoms and empires that began a hundred centuries or so 
ago, draws to its close.  The kingdom of God on earth is not a 
metaphor, not a mere spiritual state, not a dream, not an uncertain 
project; it is the thing before us, it is the close and inevitable 
destiny of mankind.
<P>
In a few score years the faith of the true God will be spreading 
about the world.  The few halting confessions of God that one hears 
here and there to-day, like that little twittering of birds which 
comes before the dawn, will have swollen to a choral unanimity.  In 
but a few centuries the whole world will be openly, confessedly, 
preparing for the kingdom.  In but a few centuries God will have led 
us out of the dark forest of these present wars and confusions into 
the open brotherhood of his rule.
<P>
<P>
<P>
6. WHAT IS MY PLACE IN THE KINGDOM?
<P>
<P>
This conception of the general life of mankind as a transformation 
at thousands of points of the confused, egotistical, proprietary, 
partisan, nationalist, life-wasting chaos of human life to-day into 
the coherent development of the world kingdom of God, provides the 
form into which everyone who comes to the knowledge of God will 
naturally seek to fit his every thought and activity.  The material 
greeds, the avarice, fear, rivalries, and ignoble ambitions of a 
disordered world will be challenged and examined under one general 
question: "What am I in the kingdom of God?"
<P>
It has already been suggested that there is a great and growing 
number of occupations that belong already to God's kingdom, 
research, teaching, creative art, creative administration, 
cultivation, construction, maintenance, and the honest satisfaction 
of honest practical human needs.  For such people conversion to the 
intimacy of God means at most a change in the spirit of their work, 
a refreshed energy, a clearer understanding, a new zeal, a completer 
disregard of gains and praises and promotion.  Pay, honours, and the 
like cease to be the inducement of effort.  Service, and service 
alone, is the criterion that the quickened conscience will 
recognise.
<P>
Most of such people will find themselves in positions in which 
service is mingled with activities of a baser sort, in which service 
is a little warped and deflected by old traditions and usage, by 
mercenary and commercial considerations, by some inherent or special 
degradation of purpose.  The spirit of God will not let the believer 
rest until his life is readjusted and as far as possible freed from 
the waste of these base diversions.  For example a scientific 
investigator, lit and inspired by great inquiries, may be hampered 
by the conditions of his professorship or research fellowship, which 
exact an appearance of "practical" results.  Or he may be obliged to 
lecture or conduct classes.  He may be able to give but half his 
possible gift to the work of his real aptitude, and that at a 
sacrifice of money and reputation among short-sighted but 
influential contemporaries.  Well, if he is by nature an 
investigator he will know that the research is what God needs of 
him.  He cannot continue it at all if he leaves his position, and so 
he must needs waste something of his gift to save the rest.  But 
should a poorer or a humbler post offer him better opportunity, 
there lies his work for God.  There one has a very common and simple 
type of the problems that will arise in the lives of men when they 
are lit by sudden realisation of the immediacy of God.
<P>
Akin to that case is the perplexity of any successful physician 
between the increase of knowledge and the public welfare on the one 
hand, and the lucrative possibilities of his practice among wealthy 
people on the other.  He belongs to a profession that is crippled by 
a mediaeval code, a profession which was blind to the common 
interest of the Public Health and regarded its members merely as 
skilled practitioners employed to "cure" individual ailments.  Very 
slowly and tortuously do the methods of the profession adapt 
themselves to the modern conception of an army of devoted men 
working as a whole under God for the health of mankind as a whole, 
broadening out from the frowsy den of the "leech," with its 
crocodile and bottles and hieroglyphic prescriptions, to a skilled 
and illuminating co-operation with those who deal with the food and 
housing and economic life of the community.
<P>
And again quite parallel with these personal problems is the trouble 
of the artist between the market and vulgar fame on the one hand and 
his divine impulse on the other.
<P>
The presence of God will be a continual light and help in every 
decision that must be made by men and women in these more or less 
vitiated, but still fundamentally useful and righteous, positions.
<P>
The trouble becomes more marked and more difficult in the case of a 
man who is a manufacturer or a trader, the financier of business 
enterprise or the proprietor of great estates.  The world is in need 
of manufactures and that goods should be distributed; land must be 
administered and new economic possibilities developed.  The drift of 
things is in the direction of state ownership and control, but in a 
great number of cases the state is not ripe for such undertakings, 
it commands neither sufficient integrity nor sufficient ability, and 
the proprietor of factory, store, credit or land, must continue in 
possession, holding as a trustee for God and, so far as lies in his 
power, preparing for his supersession by some more public 
administration.  Modern religion admits of no facile flights from 
responsibility.  It permits no headlong resort to the wilderness and 
sterile virtue.  It counts the recluse who fasts among scorpions in 
a cave as no better than a deserter in hiding.  It unhesitatingly 
forbids any rich young man to sell all that he has and give to the 
poor.  Himself and all that he has must be alike dedicated to God.
<P>
The plain duty that will be understood by the proprietor of land and 
of every sort of general need and service, so soon as he becomes 
aware of God, is so to administer his possessions as to achieve the 
maximum of possible efficiency, the most generous output, and the 
least private profit.  He may set aside a salary for his 
maintenance; the rest he must deal with like a zealous public 
official.  And if he perceives that the affair could be better 
administered by other hands than his own, then it is his business to 
get it into those hands with the smallest delay and the least profit 
to himself. . . .
<P>
The rights and wrongs of human equity are very different from right 
and wrong in the sight of God.  In the sight of God no landlord has 
a RIGHT to his rent, no usurer has a RIGHT to his interest.  A man 
is not justified in drawing the profits from an advantageous 
agreement nor free to spend the profits of a speculation as he will.  
God takes no heed of savings nor of abstinence.  He recognises no 
right to the "rewards of abstinence," no right to any rewards.  
Those profits and comforts and consolations are the inducements that 
dangle before the eyes of the spiritually blind.  Wealth is an 
embarrassment to the religious, for God calls them to account for 
it.  The servant of God has no business with wealth or power except 
to use them immediately in the service of God.  Finding these things 
in his hands he is bound to administer them in the service of God.
<P>
The tendency of modern religion goes far beyond the alleged 
communism of the early Christians, and far beyond the tithes of the 
scribes and Pharisees.  God takes all.  He takes you, blood and 
bones and house and acres, he takes skill and influence and 
expectations.  For all the rest of your life you are nothing but 
God's agent.  If you are not prepared for so complete a surrender, 
then you are infinitely remote from God.  You must go your way.  
Here you are merely a curious interloper.  Perhaps you have been 
desiring God as an experience, or covetmg him as a possession.  You 
have not begun to understand.  This that we are discussing in this 
book is as yet nothing for you.
<P>
<P>
<P>
7. ADJUSTING LIFE
<P>
<P>
This picturing of a human world more to the mind of God than this 
present world and the discovery and realisation of one's own place 
and work in and for that kingdom of God, is the natural next phase 
in the development of the believer.  He will set about revising and 
adjusting his scheme of life, his ways of living, his habits and his 
relationships in the light of his new convictions.
<P>
Most men and women who come to God will have already a certain 
righteousness in their lives; these things happen like a thunderclap 
only in strange exceptional cases, and the same movements of the 
mind that have brought them to God will already have brought their 
lives into a certain rightness of direction and conduct.  Yet 
occasionally there will be someone to whom the self-examination that 
follows conversion will reveal an entirely wrong and evil way of 
living.  It may be that the light has come to some rich idler doing 
nothing but follow a pleasurable routine.  Or to someone following 
some highly profitable and amusing, but socially useless or socially 
mischievous occupation.  One may be an advocate at the disposal of 
any man's purpose, or an actor or actress ready to fall in with any 
theatrical enterprise.  Or a woman may find herself a prostitute or 
a pet wife, a mere kept instrument of indulgence.  These are lives 
of prey, these are lives of futility; the light of God will not 
tolerate such lives.  Here religion can bring nothing but a 
severance from the old way of life altogether, a break and a 
struggle towards use and service and dignity.
<P>
But even here it does not follow that because a life has been wrong 
the new life that begins must be far as the poles asunder from the 
old.  Every sort of experience that has ever come to a human being 
is in the self that he brings to God, and there is no reason why a 
knowledge of evil ways should not determine the path of duty.  No 
one can better devise protections against vices than those who have 
practised them; none know temptations better than those who have 
fallen.  If a man has followed an evil trade, it becomes him to use 
his knowledge of the tricks of that trade to help end it.  He knows 
the charities it may claim and the remedies it needs. . . .
<P>
A very interesting case to discuss in relation to this question of 
adjustment is that of the barrister.  A practising barrister under 
contemporary conditions does indeed give most typically the 
opportunity for examining the relation of an ordinary self-
respecting wordly life, to life under the dispensation of God 
discovered.  A barrister is usually a man of some energy and 
ambition, his honour is moulded by the traditions of an ancient and 
antiquated profession, instinctively self-preserving and yet with a 
real desire for consistency and respect.  As a profession it has 
been greedy and defensively conservative, but it has never been 
shameless nor has it ever broken faith with its own large and 
selfish, but quite definite, propositions.  It has never for 
instance had the shamelessness of such a traditionless and 
undisciplined class as the early factory organisers.  It has never 
had the dull incoherent wickedness of the sort of men who exploit 
drunkenness and the turf.  It offends within limits.  Barristers can 
be, and are, disbarred.  But it is now a profession extraordinarily 
out of date; its code of honour derives from a time of cruder and 
lower conceptions of human relationship.  It apprehends the State as 
a mere "ring" kept about private disputations; it has not begun to 
move towards the modern conception of the collective enterprise as 
the determining criterion of human conduct.  It sees its business as 
a mere play upon the rules of a game between man and man, or between 
men and men.  They haggle, they dispute, they inflict and suffer 
wrongs, they evade dues, and are liable or entitled to penalties and 
compensations.  The primary business of the law is held to be 
decision in these wrangles, and as wrangling is subject to artistic 
elaboration, the business of the barrister is the business of a 
professional wrangler; he is a bravo in wig and gown who fights the 
duels of ordinary men because they are incapable, very largely on 
account of the complexities of legal procedure, of fighting for 
themselves.  His business is never to explore any fundamental right 
in the matter.  His business is to say all that can be said for his 
client, and to conceal or minimise whatever can be said against his 
client.  The successful promoted advocate, who in Britain and the 
United States of America is the judge, and whose habits and 
interests all incline him to disregard the realities of the case in 
favour of the points in the forensic game, then adjudicates upon the 
contest. . . .
<P>
Now this condition of things is clearly incompatible with the modern 
conception of the world as becoming a divine kingdom.  When the 
world is openly and confessedly the kingdom of God, the law court 
will exist only to adjust the differing views of men as to the 
manner of their service to God; the only right of action one man 
will have against another will be that he has been prevented or 
hampered or distressed by the other in serving God.  The idea of the 
law court will have changed entirely from a place of dispute, 
exaction and vengeance, to a place of adjustment.  The individual or 
some state organisation will plead ON BEHALF OF THE COMMON GOOD 
either against some state official or state regulation, or against 
the actions or inaction of another individual.  This is the only 
sort of legal proceedings compatible with the broad beliefs of the 
new faith. . . .  Every religion that becomes ascendant, in so far 
as it is not otherworldly, must necessarily set its stamp upon the 
methods and administration of the law.  That this was not the case 
with Christianity is one of the many contributory aspects that lead 
one to the conviction that it was not Christianity that took 
possession of the Roman empire, but an imperial adventurer who took 
possession of an all too complaisant Christianity.
<P>
Reverting now from these generalisations to the problem of the 
religious from which they arose, it will have become evident that 
the essential work of anyone who is conversant with the existing 
practice and literature of the law and whose natural abilities are 
forensic, will lie in the direction of reconstructing the theory and 
practice of the law in harmony with modern conceptions, of making 
that theory and practice clear and plain to ordinary men, of 
reforming the abuses of the profession by working for the separation 
of bar and judiciary, for the amalgamation of the solicitors and the 
barristers, and the like needed reforms.  These are matters that 
will probably only be properly set right by a quickening of 
conscience among lawyers themselves.  Of no class of men is the help 
and service so necessary to the practical establishment of God's 
kingdom, as of men learned and experienced in the law.  And there is 
no reason why for the present an advocate should not continue to 
plead in the courts, provided he does his utmost only to handle 
cases in which he believes he can serve the right.  Few righteous 
cases are ill-served by a frank disposition on the part of lawyer 
and client to put everything before the court.  Thereby of course 
there arises a difficult case of conscience.  What if a lawyer, 
believing his client to be in the right, discovers him to be in the 
wrong?  He cannot throw up the case unless he has been scandalously 
deceived, because so he would betray the confidence his client has 
put in him to "see him through."  He has a right to "give himself 
away," but not to "give away" his client in this fashion.  If he has 
a chance of a private consultation I think he ought to do his best 
to make his client admit the truth of the case and give in, but 
failing this he has no right to be virtuous on behalf of another.  
No man may play God to another; he may remonstrate, but that is the 
limit of his right.  He must respect a confidence, even if it is 
purely implicit and involuntary.  I admit that here the barrister is 
in a cleft stick, and that he must see the business through 
according to the confidence his client has put in him--and 
afterwards be as sorry as he may be if an injustice ensues.  And 
also I would suggest a lawyer may with a fairly good conscience 
defend a guilty man as if he were innocent, to save him from 
unjustly heavy penalties. . . .
<P>
This comparatively full discussion of the barrister's problem has 
been embarked upon because it does bring in, in a very typical 
fashion, just those uncertainties and imperfections that abound in 
real life.  Religious conviction gives us a general direction, but 
it stands aside from many of these entangled struggles in the jungle 
of conscience.  Practice is often easier than a rule.  In practice a 
lawyer will know far more accurately than a hypothetical case can 
indicate, how far he is bound to see his client through, and how far 
he may play the keeper of his client's conscience.  And nearly every 
day there happens instances where the most subtle casuistry will 
fail and the finger of conscience point unhesitatingly.  One may 
have worried long in the preparation and preliminaries of the issue, 
one may bring the case at last into the final court of conscience in 
an apparently hopeless tangle.  Then suddenly comes decision.
<P>
The procedure of that silent, lit, and empty court in which a man 
states his case to God, is very simple and perfect.  The excuses and 
the special pleading shrivel and vanish.  In a little while the case 
lies bare and plain.
<P>
<P>
<P>
8. THE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE
<P>
<P>
The question of oaths of allegiance, acts of acquiescence in 
existing governments, and the like, is one that arises at once with 
the acceptance of God as the supreme and real King of the Earth.  At 
the worst Caesar is a usurper, a satrap claiming to be sovereign; at 
the best he is provisional.  Modern casuistry makes no great trouble 
for the believing public official.  The chief business of any 
believer is to do the work for which he is best fitted, and since 
all state affairs are to become the affairs of God's kingdom it is 
of primary importance that they should come into the hands of God's 
servants.  It is scarcely less necessary to a believing man with 
administrative gifts that he should be in the public administration, 
than that he should breathe and eat.  And whatever oath or the like 
to usurper church or usurper king has been set up to bar access to 
service, is an oath imposed under duress.  If it cannot be avoided 
it must be taken rather than that a man should become unserviceable.  
All such oaths are unfair and foolish things.  They exclude no 
scoundrels; they are appeals to superstition.  Whenever an 
opportunity occurs for the abolition of an oath, the servant of God 
will seize it, but where the oath is unavoidable he will take it.
<P>
The service of God is not to achieve a delicate consistency of 
statement; it is to do as much as one can of God's work.
<P>
<P>
<P>
9. THE PRIEST AND THE CREED
<P>
<P>
It may be doubted if this line of reasoning regarding the official 
and his oath can be extended to excuse the priest or pledged 
minister of religion who finds that faith in the true God has ousted 
his formal beliefs.
<P>
This has been a frequent and subtle moral problem in the 
intellectual life of the last hundred years.  It has been 
increasingly difficult for any class of reading, talking, and 
discussing people such as are the bulk of the priesthoods of the 
Christian churches to escape hearing and reading the accumulated 
criticism of the Trinitarian theology and of the popularly accepted 
story of man's fall and salvation.  Some have no doubt defeated this 
universal and insidious critical attack entirely, and honestly 
established themselves in a right-down acceptance of the articles 
and disciplines to which they have subscribed and of the creeds they 
profess and repeat.  Some have recanted and abandoned their 
positions in the priesthood.  But a great number have neither 
resisted the bacillus of criticism nor left the churches to which 
they are attached.  They have adopted compromises, they have 
qualified their creeds with modifying footnotes of essential 
repudiation; they have decided that plain statements are metaphors 
and have undercut, transposed, and inverted the most vital points of 
the vulgarly accepted beliefs.  One may find within the Anglican 
communion, Arians, Unitarians, Atheists, disbelievers in 
immortality, attenuators of miracles; there is scarcely a doubt or a 
cavil that has not found a lodgment within the ample charity of the 
English Establishment.  I have been interested to hear one 
distinguished Canon deplore that "they" did not identify the Logos 
with the third instead of the second Person of the Trinity, and 
another distinguished Catholic apologist declare his indifference to 
the "historical Jesus."  Within most of the Christian communions one 
may believe anything or nothing, provided only that one does not 
call too public an attention to one's eccentricity.  The late Rev. 
Charles Voysey, for example, preached plainly in his church at 
Healaugh against the divinity of Christ, unhindered.  It was only 
when he published his sermons under the provocative title of "The 
Sling and the Stone," and caused an outcry beyond the limits of his 
congregation, that he was indicted and deprived.
<P>
Now the reasons why these men do not leave the ministry or 
priesthood in which they find themselves are often very plausible.  
It is probable that in very few cases is the retention of stipend or 
incumbency a conscious dishonesty.  At the worst it is mitigated by 
thought for wife or child.  It has only been during very exceptional 
phases of religious development and controversy that beliefs have 
been really sharp.  A creed, like a coin, it may be argued, loses 
little in practical value because it is worn, or bears the image of 
a vanished king.  The religious life is a reality that has clothed 
itself in many garments, and the concern of the priest or minister 
is with the religious life and not with the poor symbols that may 
indeed pretend to express, but do as a matter of fact no more than 
indicate, its direction.  It is quite possible to maintain that the 
church and not the creed is the real and valuable instrument of 
religion, that the religious life is sustained not by its 
propositions but by its routines.  Anyone who seeks the intimate 
discussion of spiritual things with professional divines, will find 
this is the substance of the case for the ecclesiastical sceptic.  
His church, he will admit, mumbles its statement of truth, but where 
else is truth?  What better formulae are to be found for ineffable 
things?  And meanwhile--he does good.
<P>
That may be a valid defence before a man finds God.  But we who 
profess the worship and fellowship of the living God deny that 
religion is a matter of ineffable things.  The way of God is plain 
and simple and easy to understand.
<P>
Therewith the whole position of the conforming sceptic is changed.  
If a professional religious has any justification at all for his 
professionalism it is surely that he proclaims the nearness and 
greatness of God.  And these creeds and articles and orthodoxies are 
not proclamations but curtains, they are a darkening and confusion 
of what should be crystal clear.  What compensatory good can a 
priest pretend to do when his primary business is the truth and his 
method a lie?  The oaths and incidental conformities of men who wish 
to serve God in the state are on a different footing altogether from 
the falsehood and mischief of one who knows the true God and yet 
recites to a trustful congregation, foists upon a trustful 
congregation, a misleading and ill-phrased Levantine creed.
<P>
Such is the line of thought which will impose the renunciation of 
his temporalities and a complete cessation of services upon every 
ordained priest and minister as his first act of faith.  Once that 
he has truly realised God, it becomes impossible for him ever to 
repeat his creed again.  His course seems plain and clear.  It 
becomes him to stand up before the flock he has led in error, and to 
proclaim the being and nature of the one true God.  He must be 
explicit to the utmost of his powers.  Then he may await his 
expulsion.  It may be doubted whether it is sufficient for him to go 
away silently, making false excuses or none at all for his retreat.  
He has to atone for the implicit acquiescences of his conforming 
years.
<P>
<P>
<P>
10. THE UNIVERSALISM OF GOD
<P>
<P>
Are any sorts of people shut off as if by inherent necessity from 
God?
<P>
This is, so to speak, one of the standing questions of theology; it 
reappears with slight changes of form at every period of religious 
interest, it is for example the chief issue between the Arminian and 
the Calvinist.  From its very opening proposition modern religion 
sweeps past and far ahead of the old Arminian teachings of Wesleyans 
and Methodists, in its insistence upon the entirely finite nature of 
God.  Arminians seem merely to have insisted that God has 
conditioned himself, and by his own free act left men free to accept 
or reject salvation.  To the realist type of mind--here as always I 
use "realist" in its proper sense as the opposite of nominalist--to 
the old-fashioned, over-exact and over-accentuating type of mind, 
such ways of thinking seem vague and unsatisfying.  Just as it 
distresses the more downright kind of intelligence with a feeling of 
disloyalty to admit that God is not Almighty, so it troubles the 
same sort of intelligence to hear that there is no clear line to be 
drawn between the saved and the lost.  Realists like an exclusive 
flavour in their faith.  Moreover, it is a natural weakness of 
humanity to be forced into extreme positions by argument.  It is 
probable, as I have already suggested, that the absolute attributes 
of God were forced upon Christianity under the stresses of 
propaganda, and it is probable that the theory of a super-human 
obstinancy beyond salvation arose out of the irritations natural to 
theological debate.  It is but a step from the realisation that 
there are people absolutely unable or absolutely unwilling to see 
God as we see him, to the conviction that they are therefore shut 
off from God by an invincible soul blindness.
<P>
It is very easy to believe that other people are essentially damned.
<P>
Beyond the little world of our sympathies and comprehension there 
are those who seem inaccessible to God by any means within our 
experience.  They are people answering to the "hard-hearted," to the 
"stiff-necked generation" of the Hebrew prophets.  They betray and 
even confess to standards that seem hopelessly base to us.  They 
show themselves incapable of any disinterested enthusiasm for beauty 
or truth or goodness.  They are altogether remote from intelligent 
sacrifice.  To every test they betray vileness of texture; they are 
mean, cold, wicked.  There are people who seem to cheat with a 
private self-approval, who are ever ready to do harsh and cruel 
things, whose use for social feeling is the malignant boycott, and 
for prosperity, monopolisation and humiliating display; who seize 
upon religion and turn it into persecution, and upon beauty to 
torment it on the altars of some joyless vice.  We cannot do with 
such souls; we have no use for them, and it is very easy indeed to 
step from that persuasion to the belief that God has no use for 
them.
<P>
And besides these base people there are the stupid people and the 
people with minds so poor in texture that they cannot even grasp the 
few broad and simple ideas that seem necessary to the salvation we 
experience, who lapse helplessly into fetishistic and fearful 
conceptions of God, and are apparently quite incapable of 
distinguishing between what is practically and what is spiritually 
good.
<P>
It is an easy thing to conclude that the only way to God is our way 
to God, that he is the privilege of a finer and better sort to which 
we of course belong; that he is no more the God of the card-sharper 
or the pickpocket or the "smart" woman or the loan-monger or the 
village oaf than he is of the swine in the sty.  But are we 
justified in thus limiting God to the measure of our moral and 
intellectual understandings?  Because some people seem to me 
steadfastly and consistently base or hopelessly and incurably dull 
and confused, does it follow that there are not phases, albeit I 
have never chanced to see them, of exaltation in the one case and 
illumination in the other?  And may I not be a little restricting my 
perception of Good?  While I have been ready enough to pronounce 
this or that person as being, so far as I was concerned, thoroughly 
damnable or utterly dull, I find a curious reluctance to admit the 
general proposition which is necessary for these instances.  It is 
possible that the difference between Arminian and Calvinist is a 
difference of essential intellectual temperament rather than of 
theoretical conviction.  I am temperamentally Arminian as I am 
temperamentally Nominalist.  I feel that it must be in the nature of 
God to attempt all souls.  There must be accessibilities I can only 
suspect, and accessibilities of which I know nothing.
<P>
Yet here is a consideration pointing rather the other way.  If you 
think, as you must think, that you yourself can be lost to God and 
damned, then I cannot see how you can avoid thinking that other 
people can be damned.  But that is not to believe that there are 
people damned at the outset by their moral and intellectual 
insufficiency; that is not to make out that there is a class of 
essential and incurable spiritual defectives.  The religious life 
preceded clear religious understanding and extends far beyond its 
range.
<P>
In my own case I perceive that in spite of the value I attach to 
true belief, the reality of religion is not an intellectual thing.  
The essential religious fact is in another than the mental sphere.  
I am passionately anxious to have the idea of God clear in my own 
mind, and to make my beliefs plain and clear to other people, and 
particularly to other people who may seem to be feeling with me; I 
do perceive that error is evil if only because a faith based on 
confused conceptions and partial understandings may suffer 
irreparable injury through the collapse of its substratum of ideas.  
I doubt if faith can be complete and enduring if it is not secured 
by the definite knowledge of the true God.  Yet I have also to admit 
that I find the form of my own religious emotion paralleled by 
people with whom I have no intellectual sympathy and no agreement in 
phrase or formula at all.
<P>
There is for example this practical identity of religious feeling 
and this discrepancy of interpretation between such an inquirer as 
myself and a convert of the Salvation Army.  Here, clothing itself 
in phrases and images of barbaric sacrifice, of slaughtered lambs 
and fountains of precious blood, a most repulsive and 
incomprehensible idiom to me, and expressing itself by shouts, 
clangour, trumpeting, gesticulations, and rhythmic pacings that stun 
and dismay my nerves, I find, the same object sought, release from 
self, and the same end, the end of identification with the immortal, 
successfully if perhaps rather insecurely achieved.  I see God 
indubitably present in these excitements, and I see personalities I 
could easily have misjudged as too base or too dense for spiritual 
understandings, lit by the manifest reflection of divinity.  One may 
be led into the absurdest underestimates of religious possibilities 
if one estimates people only coldly and in the light of everyday 
life.  There is a sub-intellectual religious life which, very 
conceivably, when its utmost range can be examined, excludes nothing 
human from religious cooperation, which will use any words to its 
tune, which takes its phrasing ready-made from the world about it, 
as it takes the street for its temple, and yet which may be at its 
inner point in the directest contact with God.  Religion may suffer 
from aphasia and still be religion; it may utter misleading or 
nonsensical words and yet intend and convey the truth.  The methods 
of the Salvation Army are older than doctrinal Christianity, and may 
long survive it.  Men and women may still chant of Beulah Land and 
cry out in the ecstasy of salvation; the tambourine, that modern 
revival of the thrilling Alexandrine sistrum, may still stir dull 
nerves to a first apprehension of powers and a call beyond the 
immediate material compulsion of life, when the creeds of 
Christianity are as dead as the lore of the Druids.
<P>
The emancipation of mankind from obsolete theories and formularies 
may be accompanied by great tides of moral and emotional release 
among types and strata that by the standards of a trained and 
explicit intellectual, may seem spiritually hopeless.  It is not 
necessary to imagine the whole world critical and lucid in order to 
imagine the whole world unified in religious sentiment, 
comprehending the same phrases and coming together regardless of 
class and race and quality, in the worship and service of the true 
God.  The coming kingship of God if it is to be more than hieratic 
tyranny must have this universality of appeal.  As the head grows 
clear the body will turn in the right direction.  To the mass of men 
modern religion says, "This is the God it has always been in your 
nature to apprehend."
<P>
<P>
<P>
11. GOD AND THE LOVE AND STATUS OF WOMEN
<P>
<P>
Now that we are discussing the general question of individual 
conduct, it will be convenient to take up again and restate in that 
relationship, propositions already made very plainly in the second 
and third chapters.  Here there are several excellent reasons for a 
certain amount of deliberate repetition. . . .
<P>
All the mystical relations of chastity, virginity, and the like with 
religion, those questions of physical status that play so large a 
part in most contemporary religions, have disappeared from modern 
faith.  Let us be as clear as possible upon this.  God is concerned 
by the health and fitness and vigour of his servants; we owe him our 
best and utmost; but he has no special concern and no special 
preferences or commandments regarding sexual things.
<P>
Christ, it is manifest, was of the modern faith in these matters, he 
welcomed the Magdalen, neither would he condemn the woman taken in 
adultery.  Manifestly corruption and disease were not to stand 
between him and those who sought God in him.  But the Christianity 
of the creeds, in this as in so many respects, does not rise to the 
level of its founder, and it is as necessary to repeat to-day as 
though the name of Christ had not been ascendant for nineteen 
centuries, that sex is a secondary thing to religion, and sexual 
status of no account in the presence of God.  It follows quite 
logically that God does not discriminate between man and woman in 
any essential things.  We leave our individuality behind us when we 
come into the presence of God.  Sex is not disavowed but forgotten.  
Just as one's last meal is forgotten--which also is a difference 
between the religious moment of modern faith and certain Christian 
sacraments.  You are a believer and God is at hand to you; heed not 
your state; reach out to him and he is there.  In the moment of 
religion you are human; it matters not what else you are, male or 
female, clean or unclean, Hebrew or Gentile, bond or free.  It is 
AFTER the moment of religion that we become concerned about our 
state and the manner in which we use ourselves.
<P>
We have to follow our reason as our sole guide in our individual 
treatment of all such things as food and health and sex.  God is the 
king of the whole world, he is the owner of our souls and bodies and 
all things.  He is not particularly concerned about any aspect, 
because he is concerned about every aspect.  We have to make the 
best use of ourselves for his kingdom; that is our rule of life.  
That rule means neither painful nor frantic abstinences nor any 
forced way of living.  Purity, cleanliness, health, none of these 
things are for themselves, they are for use; none are magic, all are 
means.  The sword must be sharp and clean.  That does not mean that 
we are perpetually to sharpen and clean it--which would weaken and 
waste the blade.  The sword must neither be drawn constantly nor 
always rusting in its sheath.  Those who have had the wits and soul 
to come to God, will have the wits and soul to find out and know 
what is waste, what is vanity, what is the happiness that begets 
strength of body and spirit, what is error, where vice begins, and 
to avoid and repent and recoil from all those things that degrade.  
These are matters not of the rule of life but of the application of 
life.  They must neither be neglected nor made disproportionally 
important.
<P>
To the believer, relationship with God is the supreme relationship.  
It is difficult to imagine how the association of lovers and friends 
can be very fine and close and good unless the two who love are each 
also linked to God, so that through their moods and fluctuations and 
the changes of years they can be held steadfast by his undying 
steadfastness.  But it has been felt by many deep-feeling people 
that there is so much kindred between the love and trust of husband 
and wife and the feeling we have for God, that it is reasonable to 
consider the former also as a sacred thing.  They do so value that 
close love of mated man and woman, they are so intent upon its 
permanence and completeness and to lift the dear relationship out of 
the ruck of casual and transitory things, that they want to bring 
it, as it were, into the very presence and assent of God.  There are 
many who dream and desire that they are as deeply and completely 
mated as this, many more who would fain be so, and some who are.  
And from this comes the earnest desire to make marriage sacramental 
and the attempt to impose upon all the world the outward appearance, 
the restrictions, the pretence at least of such a sacramental union.
<P>
There may be such a quasi-sacramental union in many cases, but only 
after years can one be sure of it; it is not to be brought about by 
vows and promises but by an essential kindred and cleaving of body 
and spirit; and it concerns only the two who can dare to say they 
have it, and God.  And the divine thing in marriage, the thing that 
is most like the love of God, is, even then, not the relationship of 
the man and woman as man and woman but the comradeship and trust and 
mutual help and pity that joins them.  No doubt that from the mutual 
necessities of bodily love and the common adventure, the necessary 
honesties and helps of a joint life, there springs the stoutest, 
nearest, most enduring and best of human companionship; perhaps only 
upon that root can the best of mortal comradeship be got; but it 
does not follow that the mere ordinary coming together and pairing 
off of men and women is in itself divine or sacramental or anything 
of the sort.  Being in love is a condition that may have its moments 
of sublime exaltation, but it is for the most part an experience far 
down the scale below divine experience; it is often love only in so 
far as it shares the name with better things; it is greed, it is 
admiration, it is desire, it is the itch for excitement, it is the 
instinct for competition, it is lust, it is curiosity, it is 
adventure, it is jealousy, it is hate.  On a hundred scores 'lovers' 
meet and part.  Thereby some few find true love and the spirit of 
God in themselves or others.
<P>
Lovers may love God in one another; I do not deny it.  That is no 
reason why the imitation and outward form of this great happiness 
should be made an obligation upon all men and women who are 
attracted by one another, nor why it should be woven into the 
essentials of religion.  For women much more than for men is this 
confusion dangerous, lest a personal love should shape and dominate 
their lives instead of God.  "He for God only; she for God in him," 
phrases the idea of Milton and of ancient Islam; it is the formula 
of sexual infatuation, a formula quite easily inverted, as the end 
of Goethe's Faust ("The woman soul leadeth us upward and on") may 
witness.  The whole drift of modern religious feeling is against 
this exaggeration of sexual feeling, these moods of sexual 
slavishness, in spiritual things.  Between the healthy love of 
ordinary mortal lovers in love and the love of God, there is an 
essential contrast and opposition in this, that preference, 
exclusiveness, and jealousy seem to be in the very nature of the 
former and are absolutely incompatible with the latter.  The former 
is the intensest realisation of which our individualities are 
capable; the latter is the way of escape from the limitations of 
individuality.  It may be true that a few men and more women do 
achieve the completest unselfishness and self-abandonment in earthly 
love.  So the poets and romancers tell us.  If so, it is that by an 
imaginative perversion they have given to some attractive person a 
worship that should be reserved for God and a devotion that is 
normally evoked only by little children in their mother's heart.  It 
is not the way between most of the men and women one meets in this 
world.
<P>
But between God and the believer there is no other way, there is 
nothing else, but self-surrender and the ending of self.
