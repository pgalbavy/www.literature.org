<p>Although the pressure had thus been relieved and Penrod found
peace with himself, nevertheless there were times during the rest
of that week when he felt a strong distaste for Margaret. His
schoolmates frequently reminded him of such phrases in her letter
as they seemed least able to forget, and for hours after each
of these experiences he was unable to comport himself with human
courtesy when constrained (as at dinner) to remain for any length
of time in the same room with her. But by Sunday these moods had
seemed to pass; he attended church in her close company, and had
no thought of the troubles brought upon him by her correspondence
with a person who throughout remained unknown to him.</p>

<p>Penrod slumped far down in the pew with his knees against the
back of that in front, and he also languished to one side, so
that the people sitting behind were afforded a view of him consisting
of a little hair and one bored ear. The sermon&mdash;a noble one, searching
and eloquent&mdash;was but a persistent sound in that ear, though,
now and then, Penrod's attention would be caught by some detached
portion of a sentence, when his mind would dwell dully upon the
phrases for a little while and lapse into a torpor. At intervals
his mother, without turning her head, would whisper, "Sit up,
Penrod," causing him to sigh profoundly and move his shoulders
about an inch, this mere gesture of compliance exhausting all
the energy that remained to him.</p>

<p>The black backs and gray heads of the elderly men in the congregation
oppressed him; they made him lethargic with a sense of long lives
of repellent dullness. But he should have been grateful to the
lady with the artificial cherries upon her hat. His gaze lingered
there, wandered away, and hopelessly returned again and again,
to be a little refreshed by the glossy scarlet of the cluster
of tiny globes. He was not so fortunate as to be drowsy; that
would have brought him some relief&mdash;and yet, after a while, his
eyes became slightly glazed; he saw dimly, and what he saw was
distorted.</p>

<p>The church had been built in the early 'Seventies, and it contained
some naive stained glass of that period. The arch at the top of
a window facing Penrod was filled with a gigantic Eye. Of oyster-white
and raw blues and reds, inflamed by the pouring sun, it had held
an awful place in the infantile life of Penrod Schofield, for
in his tenderer years he accepted it without question as the literal
Eye of Deity. He had been informed that the church was the divine
dwelling&mdash;and there was the Eye!</p>

<p>Nowadays, being no longer a little child, he had somehow come
to know better without being told, and, though the great flaming
Eye was no longer the terrifying thing it had been to him during
his childhood, it nevertheless retained something of its ominous
character. It made him feel spied upon, and its awful glare still
pursued him, sometimes, as he was falling asleep at night. When
he faced the window his feeling was one of dull resentment.</p>

<p>His own glazed eyes, becoming slightly crossed with an ennui
that was peculiarly intense this morning, rendered the Eye more
monstrous than it was. It expanded to horrible size, growing mountainous;
it turned into a volcano in the tropics, and yet it stared at
him, indubitably an Eye implacably hostile to all rights of privacy
forever. Penrod blinked and clinched his eyelids to be rid of
this dual image, and he managed to shake off the volcano. Then,
lowering the angle of his glance, he saw something most remarkable&mdash;and
curiously out of place.</p>

<p>An inverted white soup-plate was lying miraculously balanced
upon the back of a pew a little distance in front of him, and
upon the upturned bottom of the soup-plate was a brown cocoanut.
Mildly surprised, Penrod yawned, and, in the effort to straighten
his eyes, came to life temporarily. The cocoanut was revealed
as Georgie Bassett's head, and the soup-plate as Georgie's white
collar. Georgie was sitting up straight, as he always did in church,
and Penrod found this vertical rectitude unpleasant. He knew that
he had more to fear from the Eye than Georgie had, and he was
under the impression (a correct one) that Georgie felt on intimate
terms with it and was actually fond of it.</p>

<p>Penrod himself would have maintained that he was fond of it,
if he had been asked. He would have said so because he feared
to say otherwise; and the truth is that he never consciously looked
at the Eye disrespectfully. He would have been alarmed if he thought
the Eye had any way of finding out how he really felt about it.
When not off his guard, he always looked at it placatively.</p>

<p>By and by, he sagged so far to the left that he had symptoms
of a "stitch in the side", and, rousing himself, sat partially
straight for several moments. Then he rubbed his shoulders slowly
from side to side against the back of the seat, until his mother
whispered, "Don't do that, Penrod."</p>

<p>Upon this, he allowed himself to slump inwardly till the curve
in the back of his neck rested against the curved top of the back
of the seat. It was a congenial fit, and Penrod again began to
move slowly from side to side, finding the friction soothing.
Even so slight a pleasure was denied him by a husky, "Stop that!"
from his father.</p>

<p>Penrod sighed, and slid farther down. He scratched his head,
his left knee, his right biceps and his left ankle, after which
he scratched his right knee, his right ankle and his left biceps.
Then he said, "Oh, hum!" unconsciously, but so loudly that there
was a reproving stir in the neighbourhood of the Schofield pew,
and his father looked at him angrily.</p>

<p>Finally, his nose began to trouble him. It itched, and after
scratching it, he rubbed it harshly. Another "Stop that!" from
his father proved of no avail, being greeted by a desperate-sounding
whisper, "I <em>GOT </em>to!"</p>

<p>And, continuing to rub his nose with his right hand, Penrod began
to search his pockets with his left. The quest proving fruitless,
he rubbed his nose with his left hand and searched with his right.
Then he abandoned his nose and searched feverishly with both hands,
going through all of his pockets several times.</p>

<p>"What DO you want?" whispered his mother.</p>

<p>But Margaret had divined his need, and she passed him her own
handkerchief. This was both thoughtful and thoughtless&mdash;the latter
because Margaret was in the habit of thinking that she became
faint in crowds, especially at the theatre or in church, and she
had just soaked her handkerchief with spirits of ammonia from
a small phial she carried in her muff.</p>

<p>Penrod hastily applied the handkerchief to his nose and even
more hastily exploded. He sneezed stupendously; he choked, sneezed
again, wept, passed into a light convulsion of coughing and sneezing
together&mdash;a mergence of sound that attracted much attention&mdash;and,
after a few recurrent spasms, convalesced into a condition marked
by silent tears and only sporadic instances of sneezing.</p>

<p>By this time his family were unanimously scarlet&mdash;his father
and mother with mortification, and Margaret with the effort to
control the almost irresistible mirth that the struggles and vociferations
of Penrod had inspired within her. And yet her heart misgave her,
for his bloodshot and tearful eyes were fixed upon her from the
first and remained upon her, even when half-blinded with his agony;
and their expression&mdash;as terrible as that of the windowed Eye
confronting her&mdash;was not for an instant to be misunderstood. Absolutely,
he believed that she had handed him the ammonia-soaked handkerchief
deliberately and with malice, and well she knew that no power
on earth could now or at any time henceforth persuade him otherwise.</p>

<p>"Of course I didn't mean it, Penrod," she said, at the first
opportunity upon their homeward way. "I didn't notice&mdash;that is,
I didn't think&mdash;"  Unfortunately for the effect of sincerity she
hoped to produce, her voice became tremulous and her shoulders
moved suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Just you wait! You'll see!" he prophesied, in a voice now choking,
not with ammonia, but with emotion. "Poison a person, and then
laugh in his face!"</p>

<p>He spake no more until they had reached their own house, though
she made some further futile efforts at explanation and apology.</p>

<p>And after brooding abysmally throughout the meal that followed,
he disappeared from the sight of his family, having answered with
one frightful look his mother's timid suggestion that it was almost
time for Sunday-school. He retired to his eyry&mdash;the sawdust box
in the empty stable&mdash;and there gave rein to his embittered imaginings,
incidentally forming many plans for Margaret.</p>

<p>Most of these were much too elaborate; but one was so alluring
that he dwelt upon it, working out the details with gloomy pleasure,
even after he had perceived its defects. It involved some postponement&mdash;in
fact, until Margaret should have become the mother of a boy about
Penrod's present age. This boy would be precisely like Georgie
Bassett &mdash;Penrod conceived that as inevitable&mdash;and, like
Georgie, he would be his mother's idol. Penrod meant to take him
to church and force him to blow his nose with an ammonia-soaked
handkerchief in the presence of the Eye and all the congregation.</p>

<p>Then Penrod intended to say to this boy, after church, "Well,
that's exackly what your mother did to me, and if you don't like
it, you better look out!"</p>

<p>And the real Penrod in the sawdust box clenched his fists. "Come
ahead, then!" he muttered. "You talk too much!" Whereupon, the
Penrod of his dream gave Margaret's puny son a contemptuous thrashing
under the eyes of his mother, who besought in vain for mercy.
This plan was finally dropped, not because of any lingering nepotism
within Penrod, but because his injury called for action less belated.</p>

<p>One after another, he thought of impossible things; one after
another, he thought of things merely inane and futile, for he
was trying to do something beyond his power. Penrod was never
brilliant, or even successful, save by inspiration.</p>

<p>At four o'clock he came into the house, still nebulous, and as
he passed the open door of the library he heard a man's voice,
not his father's.</p>

<p>"To me," said this voice, "the finest lines in all literature
are those in Tennyson's 'Maud'&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Had it lain for a century dead, My dust would hear her and
beat, And blossom in purple and red, There somewhere around near
her feet.'</p>

<p>"I think I have quoted correctly," continued the voice nervously,
"but, at any rate, what I wished to&mdash;ah&mdash;say was that I often
think of those ah&mdash;words; but I never think of them without thinking
of&mdash;of&mdash;of <em>YOU. I&mdash;</em>ah&mdash;"</p>

<p>The nervous voice paused, and Penrod took an oblique survey of
the room, himself unobserved. Margaret was seated in an easy chair
and her face was turned away from Penrod, so that her expression
of the moment remained unknown to him. Facing her, and leaning
toward her with perceptible emotion, was Mr. Claude Blakely&mdash;a
young man with whom Penrod had no acquaintance, though he had
seen him, was aware of his identity, and had heard speech between
Mrs. Schofield and Margaret which indicated that Mr. Blakely had
formed the habit of calling frequently at the house. This was
a brilliantly handsome young man; indeed, his face was so beautiful
that even Penrod was able to perceive something about it which
might be explicably pleasing&mdash;at least to women. And Penrod remembered
that, on the last evening before Mr. Robert Williams's departure
for college, Margaret had been peevish because Penrod had genially
spent the greater portion of the evening with Robert and herself
upon the porch. Margaret made it clear, later, that she strongly
preferred to conduct her conversations with friends unassisted&mdash;and
as Penrod listened to the faltering words of Mr. Claude Blakely,
he felt instinctively that, in a certain contingency, Margaret's
indignation would be even more severe to-day than on the former
occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. Blakely coughed faintly and was able to continue.</p>

<p>"I mean to say that when I say that what Tennyson says&mdash;ah&mdash;seems
to&mdash;to apply to&mdash;to a feeling about you&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this point, finding too little breath in himself to proceed,
in spite of the fact that he had spoken in an almost inaudible
tone, Mr. Blakely stopped again.</p>

<p>Something about this little scene was making a deep impression
upon Penrod. What that impression was, he could not possibly have
stated; but he had a sense of the imminence of a tender crisis,
and he perceived that the piquancy of affairs in the library had
reached a point which would brand an intentional interruption
as the act of a cold-blooded ruffian. Suddenly it was as though
a strong light shone upon him: he decided that it was Mr. Blakely
who had told Margaret that her eyes were like blue stars in heaven
&mdash;<em>THIS </em>was the person who had caused the hateful
letter to be written! That decided Penrod; his inspiration, so
long waited for, had come.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I feel that perhaps I am not plain," said Mr. Blakely,
and immediately became red, whereas he had been pale. He was at
least modest enough about his looks to fear that Margaret might
think he had referred to them. "I mean, not plain in another sense&mdash;that
is, I mean not that <em>I</em> am not plain in saying what I mean
to you &mdash;I mean, what you mean to ME! I feel&mdash;"</p>

<p>This was the moment selected by Penrod. He walked carelessly
into the library, inquiring in a loud, bluff voice:</p>

<p>"Has anybody seen my dog around here anywheres?"</p>

<p>Mr. Blakely had inclined himself so far toward Margaret, and
he was sitting so near the edge of the chair, that only a really
wonderful bit of instinctive gymnastics landed him upon his feet
instead of upon his back. As for Margaret, she said, "Good gracious!"
and regarded Penrod blankly.</p>

<p>"Well," said Penrod breezily, "I guess it's no use lookin' for
him&mdash;he isn't anywheres around. I guess I'll sit down." Herewith,
he sank into an easy chair, and remarked, as in comfortable explanation,
"I'm kind of tired standin' up, anyway."</p>

<p>Even in this crisis, Margaret was a credit to her mother's training.</p>

<p>"Penrod, have you met Mr. Blakely?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Margaret primly performed the rite.</p>

<p>"Mr. Blakely, this is my little brother Penrod."</p>

<p>Mr. Blakely was understood to murmur, "How d'ye do?"</p>

<p>"I'm well," said Penrod.</p>

<p>Margaret bent a perplexed gaze upon him, and he saw that she
had not divined his intentions, though the expression of Mr. Blakely
was already beginning to be a little compensation for the ammonia
outrage. Then, as the protracted silence which followed the introduction
began to be a severe strain upon all parties, Penrod felt called
upon to relieve it.</p>

<p>"I didn't have anything much to do this afternoon, anyway," he
said. And at that there leaped a spark in Margaret's eye; her
expression became severe.</p>

<p>"You should have gone to Sunday-school," she told him crisply.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't!" said Penrod, with a bitterness so significant
of sufferings connected with religion, ammonia, and herself, that
Margaret, after giving him a thoughtful look, concluded not to
urge the point.</p>

<p>Mr. Blakely smiled pleasantly. "I was looking out of the window
a minute ago," he said, "and I saw a dog run across the street
and turn the corner."</p>

<p>"What kind of a lookin' dog was it?" Penrod inquired, with languor.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Blakely, "it was a&mdash;it was a nice-looking dog."</p>

<p>"What colour was he?"</p>

<p>"He was&mdash;ah&mdash;white. That is, I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It wasn't Duke," said Penrod. "Duke's kind of brownish-gray-like."</p>

<p>Mr. Blakely brightened.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was it," he said. "This dog I saw first had another
dog with him&mdash;a brownish-gray dog."</p>

<p>"Little or big?" Penrod asked, without interest.</p>

<p>"Why, Duke's a little dog!" Margaret intervened. "Of <em>COURSE,
</em>if it was little, it must have been Duke."</p>

<p>"It <em>WAS </em>little," said Mr. Blakely too enthusiastically.
"It was a little bit of a dog. I noticed it because it was so
little."</p>

<p>"Couldn't 'a' been Duke, then," said Penrod. "Duke's a kind of
a middle-sized dog." He yawned, and added: "I don't want him now.
I want to stay in the house this afternoon, anyway. And it's better
for Duke to be out in the fresh air."</p>

<p>Mr. Blakely coughed again and sat down, finding little to say.
It was evident, also, that Margaret shared his perplexity; and
another silence became so embarrassing that Penrod broke it.</p>

<p>"I was out in the sawdust-box," he said, "but it got kind of
chilly."  Neither of his auditors felt called upon to offer any
comment, and presently he added, "I thought I better come in here
where it's warmer."</p>

<p>"It's too warm,"' said Margaret, at once. "Mr. Blakely, would
you mind opening a window?"</p>

<p>"By all means!" the young man responded earnestly, as he rose.
"Maybe I'd better open two?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Margaret; "that would be much better."</p>

<p>But Penrod watched Mr. Blakely open two windows to their widest,
and betrayed no anxiety. His remarks upon the relative temperatures
of the sawdust-box and the library had been made merely for the
sake of creating sound in a silent place. When the windows had
been open for several minutes, Penrod's placidity, though gloomy,
denoted anything but discomfort from the draft, which was powerful,
the day being windy.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Blakely's turn to break a silence, and he did it so
unexpectedly that Margaret started. He sneezed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;" Margaret began, but paused apprehensively. "Perhaps-per-per&mdash;"
Her apprehensions became more and more poignant; her eyes seemed
fixed upon some incredible disaster; she appeared to inflate while
the catastrophe she foresaw became more and more imminent. All
at once she collapsed, but the power decorum had over her was
attested by the mildness of her sneeze after so threatening a
prelude.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'd better put one of the windows down," Mr. Blakely
suggested.</p>

<p>"Both, I believe," said Margaret. "The room has cooled off, now,
I think."</p>

<p>Mr. Blakely closed the windows, and, returning to a chair near
Margaret, did his share in the production of another long period
of quiet. Penrod allowed this one to pass without any vocal disturbance
on his part. It may be, however, that his gaze was disturbing
to Mr. Blakely, upon whose person it was glassily fixed with a
self-forgetfulness that was almost morbid.</p>

<p>"Didn't you enjoy the last meeting of the Cotillion Club?" Margaret
said finally.</p>

<p>And upon Mr. Blakely's answering absently in the affirmative,
she suddenly began to be talkative. He seemed to catch a meaning
in her fluency, and followed her lead, a conversation ensuing
which at first had all the outward signs of eagerness. They talked
with warm interest of people and events unknown to Penrod; they
laughed enthusiastically about things beyond his ken; they appeared
to have arranged a perfect way to enjoy themselves, no matter
whether he was with them or elsewhere but presently their briskness
began to slacken; the appearance of interest became perfunctory.
Within ten minutes the few last scattering semblances of gayety
had passed, and they lapsed into the longest and most profound
of all their silences indoors that day. Its effect upon Penrod
was to make him yawn and settle himself in his chair.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Blakely, coming to the surface out of deep inward communings,
snapped his finger against the palm of his hand impulsively.</p>

<p>"By George!" he exclaimed, under his breath.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Margaret asked. "Did you remember something?"</p>

<p>"No, it's nothing," he said. "Nothing at all. But, by the way,
it seems a pity for you to be missing the fine weather. I wonder
if I could persuade you to take a little walk?"</p>

<p>Margaret, somewhat to the surprise of both the gentlemen present,
looked uncertain.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said.</p>

<p>Mr. Blakely saw that she missed his point.</p>

<p>"One can talk better in the open, don't you think?" he urged,
with a significant glance toward Penrod.</p>

<p>Margaret also glanced keenly at Penrod. "Well, perhaps." And
then, "I'll get my hat," she said.</p>

<p>Penrod was on his feet before she left the room. He stretched
himself.</p>

<p>"I'll get mine, too," he said.</p>

<p>But he carefully went to find it in a direction different from
that taken by his sister, and he joined her and her escort not
till they were at the front door, whither Mr. Blakely&mdash;with a
last flickering of hope had urged a flight in haste.</p>

<p>"I been thinkin' of takin' a walk, all afternoon," said Penrod
pompously. "Don't matter to me which way we go."</p>

<p>The exquisite oval of Mr. Claude Blakely's face merged into outlines
more rugged than usual; the conformation of his jaw became perceptible,
and it could be seen that he had conceived an idea which was crystallizing
into a determination.</p>

<p>"I believe it happens that this is our first walk together,"
he said to Margaret, as they reached the pavement, "but, from
the kind of tennis you play, I judge that you could go a pretty
good gait. Do you like walking fast?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "For exercise."</p>

<p>"Shall we try it then?"</p>

<p>"You set the pace," said Margaret. "I think I can keep up."</p>

<p>He took her at her word, and the amazing briskness of their start
seemed a little sinister to Penrod, though he was convinced that
he could do anything that Margaret could do, and also that neither
she nor her comely friend could sustain such a speed for long.
On the contrary, they actually increased it with each fleeting
block they covered.</p>

<p>"Here!" he panted, when they had thus put something more than
a half-mile behind them. "There isn't anybody has to have a doctor,
I guess! What's the use our walkin' so fast?"</p>

<p>In truth, Penrod was not walking, for his shorter legs permitted
no actual walking at such a speed; his gait was a half-trot.</p>

<p>"Oh, WE'RE out for a <em>WALK!" </em>Mr. Blakely returned, a
note of gayety beginning to sound in his voice. "Marg&mdash;ah &mdash;Miss
Schofield, keep your head up and breathe through your nose. That's
it! You'll find I was right in suggesting this. It's going to
turn out gloriously! Now, let's make it a little faster."</p>

<p>Margaret murmured inarticulately, for she would not waste her
breath in a more coherent reply. Her cheeks were flushed; her
eyes were brimming with the wind, but when she looked at Penrod,
they were brimming with something more. Gurgling sounds came from
her.</p>

<p>Penrod's expression had become grim. He offered no second protest,
mainly because he, likewise, would not waste his breath, and if
he would, he could not. Of breath in the ordinary sense breath,
breathed automatically&mdash;he had none. He had only gasps to feed
his straining lungs, and his half-trot, which had long since become
a trot, was changed for a lope when Mr. Blakely reached his own
best burst of speed.</p>

<p>And now people stared at the flying three. The gait of Margaret
and Mr. Blakely could be called a walk only by courtesy, while
Penrod's was becoming a kind of blind scamper. At times he zigzagged;
other times, he fell behind, wabbling. Anon, with elbows flopping
and his face sculptured like an antique mask, he would actually
forge ahead, and then carom from one to the other of his companions
as he fell back again.</p>

<p>Thus the trio sped through the coming of autumn dusk, outflying
the fallen leaves that tumbled upon the wind. And still Penrod
held to the task that he had set himself. The street lamps flickered
into life, but on and on Claude Blakely led the lady, and on and
on reeled the grim Penrod. Never once was he so far from them
that they could have exchanged a word unchaperoned by his throbbing
ear.</p>

<p>"OH!" Margaret cried, and, halting suddenly, she draped herself
about a lamp-post like a strip of bunting. "Guh-uh-guh-<em>GOODNESS!"
</em>she sobbed.</p>

<p>Penrod immediately drooped to the curb-stone, which he reached,
by pure fortune, in a sitting position. Mr. Blakely leaned against
a fence, and said nothing, though his breathing was eloquent.
"We&mdash;we must go&mdash;go home," Margaret gasped. "We must, if&mdash;if we
can drag ourselves!"</p>

<p>Then Penrod showed them what mettle they he'd tried to crack.
A paroxysm of coughing shook him; he spoke through it sobbingly:</p>

<p>"'Drag!' 'S jus' lul-like a girl! Ha-why I walk &mdash;<em>OOF!&mdash;</em>faster'n
that every day&mdash;on my&mdash;way to school." He managed to subjugate
a tendency to nausea. "What you&mdash;want to go&mdash;home for?" he said.
"Le's go on!"</p>

<p>In the darkness Mr. Claude Blakely's expression could not be
seen, nor was his voice heard. For these and other reasons, his
opinions and sentiments may not be stated.</p>

<p>... Mrs. Schofield was looking rather anxiously forth from her
front door when the two adult figures and the faithful smaller
one came up the walk.</p>

<p>"I was getting uneasy," she said. "Papa and I came in and found
the house empty. It's after seven. Oh, Mr. Blakely, is that you?"</p>

<p>"Good-evening," he said. "I fear I must be keeping an engagement.
Good-night. Good-night, Miss Schofield."</p>

<p>"Good-night."</p>

<p>"Well, good-night," Penrod called, staring after him. But Mr.
Blakely was already too far away to hear him, and a moment later
Penrod followed his mother and sister into the house.</p>

<p>"I let Della go to church," Mrs. Schofield said to Margaret.
"You and I might help Katie get supper."</p>

<p>"Not for a few minutes," Margaret returned gravely, looking at
Penrod. "Come upstairs, mamma; I want to tell you something."</p>

<p>Penrod cackled hoarse triumph and defiance.</p>

<p>"Go on! Tell! What <em>'I</em> care? You try to poison a person
in church again, and then laugh in his face, you'll see what you
get!"</p>

<p>But after his mother had retired with Margaret to the latter's
room, he began to feel disturbed in spite of his firm belief that
his cause was wholly that of justice victorious. Margaret had
insidious ways of stating a case; and her point of view, no matter
how absurd or unjust, was almost always adopted by Mr. and Mrs.
Schofield in cases of controversy.</p>

<p>Penrod became uneasy. Perceiving himself to be in danger, he
decided that certain measures were warranted. Unquestionably,
it would be well to know beforehand in what terms Margaret would
couch the charges which he supposed he must face in open court&mdash;that
is to say, at the supper-table. He stole softly up the stairs,
and, flattening himself against the wall, approached Margaret's
door, which was about an inch ajar.</p>

<p>He heard his mother making sounds which appalled him&mdash;he took
them for sobs. And then Margaret's voice rang out in a peal of
insane laughter. Trembling, he crept nearer the door. Within the
room Margaret was clinging to her mother, and both were trying
to control their hilarity.</p>

<p>"He did it all to get even!" Margaret exclaimed, wiping her eyes.
"He came in at just the right time. That <em>GOOSE </em>was beginning
to talk his silly, soft talk&mdash;the way he does with every girl
in town&mdash;and he was almost proposing, and I didn't know how to
stop him. And then Penrod came in and did it for me. I could have
hugged Penrod, mamma, I actually could! And I saw he meant to
stay to get even for that ammonia&mdash;and, oh, I worked so hard to
make him think I wanted him to GO! Mamma, mamma, if you could
have <em>SEEN </em>that walk! That <em>GOOSE </em>kept thinking
he could wear Penrod out or drop him behind, but I knew he couldn't
so long as Penrod believed he was worrying us and getting even.
And that <em>GOOSE </em>thought I <em>WANTED </em>to get rid of
Penrod, too; and the conceited thing said it would turn out 'gloriously,'
meaning we'd be alone together pretty soon &mdash;I'd like to
shake him! You see, I pretended so well, in order to make Penrod
stick to us, that <em>GOOSE </em>believed I meant it! And if he
hadn't tried to walk Penrod off his legs, he wouldn't have wilted
his own collar and worn himself out, and I think he'd have hung
on until you'd have had to invite him to stay to supper, and he'd
have stayed on all evening, and I wouldn't have had a chance to
write to Robert Williams. Mamma, there have been lots of times
when I haven't been thankful for Penrod, but to-day I could have
got down on my knees to you and papa for giving me such a brother!"</p>

<p>In the darkness of the hall, as a small but crushed and broken
form stole away from the crack in the door, a gigantic Eye seemed
