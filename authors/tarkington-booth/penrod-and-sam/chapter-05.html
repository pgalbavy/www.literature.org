<p>Georgie Bassett was a boy set apart. Not only that; Georgie knew
that he was a boy set apart. He would think about it for ten or
twenty minutes at a time, and he could not look at himself in
a mirror and remain wholly without emotion. What that emotion
was, he would have been unable to put into words; but it helped
him to understand that there was a certain noble something about
him that other boys did not possess.</p>

<p>Georgie's mother had been the first to discover that Georgie
was a boy set apart. In fact, Georgie did not know it until one
day when he happened to overhear his mother telling two of his
aunts about it. True, he had always understood that he was the
best boy in town and he intended to be a minister when he grew
up; but he had never before comprehended the full extent of his
sanctity, and, from that fraught moment onward, he had an almost
theatrical sense of his set-apartness.</p>

<p>Penrod Schofield and Sam Williams and the other boys of the neighbourhood
all were conscious that there was something different and spiritual
about Georgie, and, though this consciousness of theirs may have
been a little obscure, it was none the less actual. That is to
say, they knew that Georgie Bassett was a boy set apart; but they
did not know that they knew it. Georgie's air and manner at all
times demonstrated to them that the thing was so, and, moreover,
their mothers absorbed appreciation of Georgie's wonderfulness
from the very fount of it, for Mrs. Bassett's conversation was
of little else. Thus, the radiance of his character became the
topic of envious parental comment during moments of strained patience
in many homes, so that altogether the most remarkable fact to
be stated of Georgie Bassett is that he escaped the consequences
as long as he did.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, no actual violence was done him, except
upon the incidental occasion of a tar-fight into which he was
drawn by an obvious eccentricity on the part of destiny. Naturally,
he was not popular with his comrades; in all games he was pushed
aside, and disregarded, being invariably the tail-ender in every
pastime in which leaders "chose sides"; his counsels were slighted
as worse than weightless, and all his opinions instantly hooted.
Still, considering the circumstances fairly and thoughtfully,
it is difficult to deny that his boy companions showed creditable
moderation in their treatment of him. That is, they were moderate
up to a certain date, and even then they did not directly attack
him&mdash;there was nothing cold&mdash;blooded about it at all. The thing
was forced upon them, and, though they all felt pleased and uplifted&mdash;while
it was happening&mdash;they did not understand precisely why. Nothing
could more clearly prove their innocence of heart than this very
ignorance, and yet none of the grown people who later felt themselves
concerned in the matter was able to look at it in that light.
Now, here was a characteristic working of those reactions that
produce what is sometimes called "the injustice of life", because
the grown people were responsible for the whole affair and were
really the guilty parties. It was from grown people that Georgie
Bassett learned he was a boy set apart, and the effect upon him
was what alienated his friends. Then these alienated friends were
brought (by odious comparisons on the part of grown people) to
a condition of mind wherein they suffered dumb annoyance, like
a low fever, whenever they heard Georgie's name mentioned, while
association with his actual person became every day more and more
irritating. And yet, having laid this fuse and having kept it
constantly glowing, the grown people expected nothing to happen
to Georgie.</p>

<p>The catastrophe befell as a consequence of Sam Williams deciding
to have a shack in his backyard. Sam had somehow obtained a vasty
piano-box and a quantity of lumber, and, summoning Penrod Schofield
and the coloured brethren, Herman and Verman, he expounded to
them his building-plans and offered them shares and benefits in
the institution he proposed to found. Acceptance was enthusiastic;
straightway the assembly became a union of carpenters all of one
mind, and ten days saw the shack not completed but comprehensible.
Anybody could tell, by that time, that it was intended for a shack.</p>

<p>There was a door on leather hinges; it drooped, perhaps, but
it was a door. There was a window&mdash;not a glass one, but, at least,
it could be "looked out of", as Sam said. There was a chimney
made of stovepipe, though that was merely decorative, because
the cooking was done out of doors in an underground "furnace"
that the boys excavated. There were pictures pasted on the interior
walls, and, hanging from a nail, there was a crayon portrait of
Sam's grandfather, which he had brought down from the attic quietly,
though, as he said, it "wasn't any use on earth up there." There
were two lame chairs from Penrod's attic and along one wall ran
a low and feeble structure intended to serve as a bench or divan.
This would come in handy, Sam said, if any of the party "had to
lay down or anything", and at a pinch (such as a meeting of the
association) it would serve to seat all the members in a row.</p>

<p>For, coincidentally with the development of the shack, the builders
became something more than partners. Later, no one could remember
who first suggested the founding of a secret order, or society,
as a measure of exclusiveness and to keep the shack sacred to
members only; but it was an idea that presently began to be more
absorbing and satisfactory than even the shack itself. The outward
manifestations of it might have been observed in the increased
solemnity and preoccupation of the Caucasian members and in a
few ceremonial observances exposed to the public eye. As an instance
of these latter, Mrs. Williams, happening to glance from a rearward
window, about four o'clock one afternoon, found her attention
arrested by what seemed to be a flag-raising before the door of
the shack. Sam and Herman and Verman stood in attitudes of rigid
attention, shoulder to shoulder, while Penrod Schofield, facing
them, was apparently delivering some sort of exhortation, which
he read from a scribbled sheet of foolscap. Concluding this, he
lifted from the ground a long and somewhat warped clothes-prop,
from one end of which hung a whitish flag, or pennon, bearing
an inscription. Sam and Herman and Verman lifted their right hands,
while Penrod placed the other end of the clothes-prop in a hole
in the ground, with the pennon fluttering high above the shack.
He then raised his own right hand, and the four boys repeated
something in concert. It was inaudible to Mrs. Williams; but she
was able to make out the inscription upon the pennon. It consisted
of the peculiar phrase "In-Or-In" done in black paint upon a muslin
ground, and consequently seeming to be in need of a blotter.</p>

<p>It recurred to her mind, later that evening, when she happened
to find herself alone with Sam in the library, and, in merest
idle curiosity, she asked: "Sam, what does 'In-Or-In' mean?"</p>

<p>Sam, bending over an arithmetic, uncreased his brow till it became
of a blank and marble smoothness.</p>

<p>"Ma'am?"</p>

<p>"What are those words on your flag?"</p>

<p>Sam gave her a long, cold, mystic look, rose to his feet and
left the room with emphasis and dignity. For a moment she was
puzzled. But Sam's older brother was this year completing his
education at a university, and Mrs. Williams was not altogether
ignorant of the obligations of secrecy imposed upon some brotherhoods;
so she was able to comprehend Sam's silent withdrawal, and, instead
of summoning him back for further questions, she waited until
he was out of hearing and then began to laugh.</p>

<p>Sam's action was in obedience to one of the rules adopted, at
his own suggestion, as a law of the order. Penrod advocated it
warmly. From Margaret he had heard accounts of her friends in
college and thus had learned much that ought to be done. On the
other hand, Herman subscribed to it with reluctance, expressing
a decided opinion that if he and Verman were questioned upon the
matter at home and adopted the line of conduct required by the
new rule, it would be well for them to depart not only from the
room in which the questioning took place but from the house, and
hurriedly at that. "An' <em>STAY </em>away!" he concluded.</p>

<p>Verman, being tongue-tied&mdash;not without advantage in this case,
and surely an ideal qualification for membership&mdash;was not so apprehensive.
He voted with Sam and Penrod, carrying the day.</p>

<p>New rules were adopted at every meeting (though it cannot be
said that all of them were practicable) for, in addition to the
information possessed by Sam and Penrod, Herman and Verman had
many ideas of their own, founded upon remarks overheard at home.
Both their parents belonged to secret orders, their father to
the Innapenent 'Nevolent Lodge (so stated by Herman) and their
mother to the Order of White Doves.</p>

<p>From these and other sources, Penrod found no difficulty in compiling
material for what came to be known as the "rixual"; and it was
the rixual he was reading to the members when Mrs. Williams happened
to observe the ceremonial raising of the emblem of the order.</p>

<p>The rixual contained the oath, a key to the secret language,
or code (devised by Penrod for use in uncertain emergencies) and
passwords for admission to the shack, also instructions for recognizing
a brother member in the dark, and a rather alarming sketch of
the things to be done during the initiation of a candidate.</p>

<p>This last was employed for the benefit of Master Roderick Magsworth
Bitts, Junior, on the Saturday following the flag-raising. He
presented himself in Sam's yard, not for initiation, indeed&mdash;having
no previous knowledge of the Society of the In-Or-In&mdash;but for
general purposes of sport and pastime. At first sight of the shack
he expressed anticipations of pleasure, adding some suggestions
for improving the architectural effect. Being prevented, however,
from entering, and even from standing in the vicinity of the sacred
building, he plaintively demanded an explanation; whereupon he
was commanded to withdraw to the front yard for a time, and the
members held meeting in the shack. Roddy was elected, and consented
to undergo the initiation.</p>

<p>He was not the only new member that day. A short time after Roddy
had been taken into the shack for the reading of the rixual and
other ceremonies, little Maurice Levy entered the Williams' gate
and strolled round to the backyard, looking for Sam. He was surprised
and delighted to behold the promising shack, and, like Roddy,
entertained fair hopes for the future.</p>

<p>The door of the shack was closed; a board covered the window,
but a murmur of voices came from within. Maurice stole close and
listened. Through a crack he could see the flicker of a candle-flame,
and he heard the voice of Penrod Schofield:</p>

<p>"Roddy Bitts, do you solemnly swear?"</p>

<p>"Well, all right," said the voice of Roddy, somewhat breathless.</p>

<p>"How many fingers you see before your eyes?"</p>

<p>"Can't see any," Roddy returned. "How could I, with this thing
over my eyes, and laying down on my stummick, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Then the time has come," Penrod announced in solemn tones. "The
time has come."</p>

<p>Whack!</p>

<p>Evidently a broad and flat implement was thereupon applied to
Roddy.</p>

<p>"OW!" complained the candidate.</p>

<p>"No noise!" said Penrod sternly, and added: "Roddy Bitts must
now say the oath. Say exackly what I say, Roddy, and if you don't&mdash;well,
you better, because you'll see! Now, say 'I solemnly swear&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"I solemnly swear&mdash;" Roddy said.</p>

<p>"To keep the secrets&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To keep the secrets&mdash;" Roddy repeated.</p>

<p>"To keep the secrets in infadelaty and violate and sanctuary."</p>

<p>"What?" Roddy naturally inquired.</p>

<p>Whack!</p>

<p>"OW!" cried Roddy. "That's no fair!"</p>

<p>"You got to say just what <em>I</em> say," Penrod was heard informing
him. "That's the rixual, and anyway, even if you do get it right,
Verman's got to hit you every now and then, because that's part
of the rixual, too. Now go on and say it. 'I solemnly swear to
keep the secrets in infadelaty and violate and sanctuary."'</p>

<p>"I solemnly swear&mdash;" Roddy began.</p>

<p>But Maurice Levy was tired of being no party to such fascinating
proceedings, and he began to hammer upon the door.</p>

<p>"Sam! Sam Williams!" he shouted. "Lemme in there! I know lots
about 'nishiatin'. Lemme in!"</p>

<p>The door was flung open, revealing Roddy Bitts, blindfolded and
bound, lying face down upon the floor of the shack; but Maurice
had only a fugitive glimpse of this pathetic figure before he,
too, was recumbent. Four boys flung themselves indignantly upon
him and bore him to earth.</p>

<p>"Hi!" he squealed. "What you doin'? Haven't you got any <em>SENSE</em>?"</p>

<p>And, from within the shack, Roddy added his own protest.</p>

<p>"Let me up, can't you?" he cried. "I got to see what's goin'
on out there, haven't I? I guess I'm not goin' to lay here all
<em>DAY! </em>What you think I'm made of?"</p>

<p>"You hush up!" Penrod commanded. "This is a nice biznuss!" he
continued, deeply aggrieved. "What kind of a 'nishiation do you
expect this is, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Well, here's Maurice Levy gone and seen part of the secrets,"
said Sam, in a voice of equal plaintiveness. "Yes; and I bet he
was listenin' out here, too!"</p>

<p>"Lemme up!" begged Maurice, half stifled. "I didn't do any harm
to your old secrets, did I? Anyways, I just as soon be 'nishiated
myself. I ain't afraid. So if you 'nishiate me, what difference
will it make if I did hear a little?"</p>

<p>Struck with this idea, which seemed reasonable; Penrod obtained
silence from every one except Roddy, and it was decided to allow
Maurice to rise and retire to the front yard. The brother members
then withdrew within the shack, elected Maurice to the fellowship,
and completed the initiation of Mr. Bitts. After that, Maurice
was summoned and underwent the ordeal with fortitude, though the
newest brother&mdash;still tingling with his own experiences&mdash;helped
to make certain parts of the rixual unprecedentedly severe.</p>

<p>Once endowed with full membership, Maurice and Roddy accepted
the obligations and privileges of the order with enthusiasm. Both
interested themselves immediately in improvements for the shack,
and made excursions to their homes to obtain materials. Roddy
returned with a pair of lensless mother-of-pearl opera-glasses,
a contribution that led to the creation of a new office, called
the "warner". It was his duty to climb upon the back fence once
every fifteen minutes and search the horizon for intruders or
"anybody that hasn't got any biznuss around here." This post proved
so popular, at first, that it was found necessary to provide for
rotation in office, and to shorten the interval from fifteen minutes
to an indefinite but much briefer period, determined principally
by argument between the incumbent and his successor.</p>

<p>And Maurice Levy contributed a device so pleasant, and so necessary
to the prevention of interruption during meetings, that Penrod
and Sam wondered why they had not thought of it themselves long
before. It consisted of about twenty-five feet of garden hose
in fair condition. One end of it was introduced into the shack
through a knothole, and the other was secured by wire round the
faucet of hydrant in the stable. Thus, if members of the order
were assailed by thirst during an important session, or in the
course of an initiation, it would not be necessary for them all
to leave the shack. One could go, instead, and when he had turned
on the water at the hydrant, the members in the shack could drink
without leaving their places. It was discovered, also, that the
section of hose could be used as a speaking-tube; and though it
did prove necessary to explain by shouting outside the tube what
one had said into it, still there was a general feeling that it
provided another means of secrecy and an additional safeguard
against intrusion. It is true that during the half-hour immediately
following the installation of this convenience, there was a little
violence among the brothers concerning a question of policy. Sam,
Roddy and Verman &mdash;Verman especially&mdash;wished to use the tube
"to talk through" and Maurice, Penrod and Herman wished to use
it "to drink through." As a consequence of the success of the
latter party, the shack became too damp for habitation until another
day, and several members, as they went home at dusk, might easily
have been mistaken for survivors of some marine catastrophe.</p>

<p>Still, not every shack is equipped with running water, and exuberance
befitted the occasion. Everybody agreed that the afternoon had
been one of the most successful and important in many weeks. The
Order of the In-Or-In was doing splendidly, and yet every brother
felt, in his heart, that there was one thing that could spoil
it. Against that fatality, all were united to protect themselves,
the shack, the rixual, the opera-glasses and the water-and-speaking
tube. Sam spoke not only for himself but for the entire order
when he declared, in speeding the last parting guest:</p>

<p>"Well, we got to stick to one thing or we might as well quit!
<em>GEORGIE BASSETT </em>better not come pokin' around!"</p>

<p>"No, <em>SIR!" </em>said Penrod.</p>
