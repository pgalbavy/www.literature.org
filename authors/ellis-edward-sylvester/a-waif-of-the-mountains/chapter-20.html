<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The trail, as has been stated, was broad and comparatively level.
The slope of the mountain to the right was so moderate that it
could be climbed by a horse almost as readily as by a man. Its
face was covered with a growth of cedars, continuing half way
to the summit, when it terminated, only bleak masses of rock,
sprinkled with snow, whose volume increased with the elevation,
being visible above and beyond.</p>

<p>When the four pursuers came together, their faces showed that
they comprehended the serious business before them. It was seen
that Captain Dawson was slightly pale, but those who had been
with him in battle had observed the same peculiarity. Accompanied,
as it was in this instance, by a peculiar steely glitter of his
eyes, it meant that he was in a dangerous mood and the man who
crossed his path did so at his peril.</p>

<p>It was evident that he and Vose Adams had reached an understanding
during the few minutes that they were riding in advance. The words
of Vose Adams were spoken for the benefit of Ruggles and the parson.</p>

<p>"You'll wait here till I take a look at things."</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do?" asked Brush.</p>

<p>"I'm going up the slope on foot to find out how the land lays."</p>

<p>"And when you find that out, what next?"</p>

<p>"He is to come back and report to me," interposed the captain.</p>

<p>There was a world of meaning in these words. It showed that the
captain allowed Adams to lead only when acting as a guide. In
all other matters, the retired officer assumed control. The opportunity
of Vose to pick off the offending lieutenant promised to be better
than that of any one else, since he would first see him, but he
had been given to understand that he must immediately return and
let the captain know the situation. Adams had promised this and
he knew Dawson too well to dare to thwart him.</p>

<p>Brush and Ruggles could make no objection, keen though their
disappointment was. They watched Adams, as he slipped off his
mule, not deeming it worth while to utter the warning both had
had in mind. It was the parson who said:</p>

<p>"I suppose we have nothing to do except to wait here till you
come back?"</p>

<p>"It looks that way, but you must ask the captain."</p>

<p>"You won't be gone long?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so."</p>

<p>"Be careful, but there's no need of waiting," said the captain.</p>

<p>The three watched the guide until he disappeared from sight among
the cedars, when the captain added:</p>

<p>"Vose told me that it was possible that camp fire had been started
by Indians, but it seems to me there is little likelihood of that."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Those people are so skilled in woodcraft that they would have
been on the alert against our approach, for a brief survey of
the trail for the last half hour would have revealed us to them."</p>

<p>"It may be," suggested the parson, "that with every reason to
believe there is no danger of anything of the kind, for it must
be rare that a white man passes along this trail, they did not
keep a lookout."</p>

<p>The captain shook his head.</p>

<p>"From what I know of the American race, it is unlike them."</p>

<p>"What knowledge have we that they have not maintained such a
lookout and discovered us as soon as we noticed the camp fire
itself? They may have formed an ambuscade at some point further
along the trail."</p>

<p>"It is a disturbing possibility and I would be alarmed, but for
my confidence in Vose. He has been through this region so often
and knows these wild people so thoroughly that he could not commit
a blunder like that. It seems to me," added the captain a few
minutes, later, "that he is absent a long time."</p>

<p>"It's tough," remarked Ruggles, "that things are fixed so we
won't have a chance to take any hand in this bus'ness."</p>

<p>The captain looked inquiringly at him and he explained:</p>

<p>"You and Vose have set it up atween you."</p>

<p>"I have told you that if your help is needed, it will be welcome;
I can add nothing to that."</p>

<p>"The captain is right," interposed the parson, "but at the same
time, he can see what a disappointment it is for us."</p>

<p>"I admit that, but we are not out of the woods yet."</p>

<p>Before he could make clear the meaning of this remark, Vose Adams
emerged from the cedars, and the three breathlessly awaited his
coming. He broke into a trot and quickly descended the slope to
where they stood. The expression of his face showed before he
spoke that he brought unwelcome news.</p>

<p>"Confound it!" he exclaimed with a shake of his head, "they're
not there!"</p>

<p>"Then they have gone on up the trail," said the captain inquiringly.</p>

<p>"No; they haven't been there; it isn't their camp."</p>

<p>"Whose is it?"</p>

<p>"Injins; there are five of 'em; they've just had their breakfast
and are gettin' ready to make a start."</p>

<p>"Didn't they see you?"</p>

<p>"That isn't the way I do bus'ness," replied Vose rather loftily;
"it's more'n likely, howsumever, they seen us all awhile ago when
we was further down the trail. They're traveling eastward."</p>

<p>"How can you know that?" asked the parson.</p>

<p>"The Injin that took his dive off the trail 'bout the time the
captain fired off his revolver, was going that way. He b'longed
to the party and was sorter leading 'em; he was a chief or something
of the kind."</p>

<p>"Where are their ponies?"</p>

<p>"They haven't any,&mdash;leastways he was the only one that had, which
is why I said he was some kind of a chief. We shall hear from
'em agin."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I mean after they find out about that little row."</p>

<p>"Why need they find out about it?"</p>

<p>"They can't help it; they'll miss their chief; they'll run across
that horse of his and that'll give 'em the clue."</p>

<p>This unexpected discovery put a new face on matters. Five mountain
Indians, the bravest and most implacable of their race, were almost
within stone's throw of the party. But for the occurrence of a
brief while before, they probably would have permitted the white
men to continue their journey unmolested, since the strength of
the two bands, all things considered, was about equal, but when
the hostiles learned of the death of their leader, they would
bend every effort toward securing revenge. They would dog the
miners, watchful, alert and tireless in their attempts to cut
them off from the possibility of ever repeating the deed.</p>

<p>"But that chief, as you seem to think he was," said Captain Dawson,
"is gone as utterly as if the ground had opened and swallowed
him. They will never have the chance to officiate at his funeral,
so how are they to learn of the manner of his taking off?"</p>

<p>"It won't take 'em long," replied Adams; "his pony will hunt
them out, now that he is left to himself; that'll tell 'em that
something is up and they'll start an investigatin' committee.
The footprints of our horses, the marks on the rocks, which you
and me wouldn't notice, the fact that we met the chief on that
narrer ledge and that he's turned up missing will soon lay bare
the whole story, and as I remarked aforesaid, we shall hear from
'em agin."</p>

<p>"It looks like a case of the hunter hunting the tiger," said
the parson, "and then awaking to the fact that the tiger is engaged
in hunting him; it is plain to see that there's going to be a
complication of matters, but I don't feel that it need make any
difference to us."</p>

<p>"It won't!" replied the captain decisively; "we haven't put our
hands to the plough with any intention of looking back. What's
the next thing to do, Vose?"</p>

<p>"We've got to look after our animals."</p>

<p>"But there's no grass here for them."</p>

<p>"A little further and we'll strike a stream of water where we'll
find some grass, though not much, but it's better than nothing."</p>

<p>Vaulting into the saddle, the guide after some pounding of his
heels against the iron ribs of Hercules, forced him into a gallop,
which the others imitated. The trail continued comparatively smooth,
and, being slightly descending, the animals were not crowded as
hard as it would seem. A mile of this brought them to the water,
where they were turned loose. The stream gushed from the mountain
side, and, flowing across the trail, was lost among the rocks
to the left. The moisture thus diffused produced a moderate growth
of tough, coarse grass, which the animals began plucking as soon
as the bits were removed from their mouths. They secured little
nutriment, but as the guide remarked, it was an improvement upon
nothing. The men bathed their faces in the cold, clear water,
took a refreshing draught, and then ate the lunch provided for
them by the thoughtful Adams. Though they ate heartily, sufficient
was kept to answer for another meal or two, if it should be thought
wise to put themselves on an allowance.</p>

<p>They had just lighted their pipes, when Wade Ruggles uttered
an exclamation. Without explaining the cause, he bounded to his
feet and ran several rods to the westward, where he was seen to
stoop and pick something from the ground. He examined it closely
and then, as he turned about and came back more slowly it was
perceived that he held a white handkerchief in his hand. His action
caused the others to rise to his feet.</p>

<p>"What have you there?" asked Captain Dawson, suspecting its identity.</p>

<p>"I guess you have seen it before," replied Wade, handing the
piece of fine, bordered linen to him. He turned it over with strange
emotions, for he was quick to recognize it.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, compressing his lips; "it is hers; she dropped
it there&mdash;how long ago, Vose?"</p>

<p>The latter examined the handkerchief, as if looking for the answer
to the question in its folds, but shook his head.</p>

<p>"Even a mountain Injin could not tell that."</p>

<p>The parson asked the privilege of examining the article. His
heart was beating fast, though no one else was aware of it, for
it was a present which he had made to Nellie Dawson on the preceding
Christmas, having been brought by Vose Adams, with other articles,
on his trip made several months before the presentation. There
was the girl's name, written by himself in indelible ink, and
in his neat, round hand. It was a bitter reflection that it had
been in her possession, when she was in the company of the one
whom she esteemed above all others.</p>

<p>"It may have been," reflected the parson, carefully keeping his
thoughts to himself, "that, when she remembered from whom it came,
she flung it aside to please him. Captain," he added, "since this
was once mine, I presume you have no objection to my keeping it."</p>

<p>"You are welcome to it; I don't care for it," replied the parent.</p>

<p>"Thank you," and the parson carefully put it away to keep company
with the letter of Nellie Dawson which broke her father's heart;
"I observe that it is quite dry, which makes me believe it has
not been exposed to the dew, and therefore could not have lain
long on the ground."</p>

<p>"You can't tell anything by that," commented Vose; "the air is
so dry up here, even with the snow and water around us, that there's
no dew to amount to anything."</p>

<p>All seemed to prefer not to discuss the little incident that
had produced so sombre an effect upon the party. Wade Ruggles
was disposed to claim the handkerchief, inasmuch as it was he
who found it, but he respected the feelings of the parson too
much to make any protest.</p>

<p>The occurrence was of no special interest to the guide. He had
said they were in danger from the Indians and he gave his thoughts
to them. While the others kept their seats on the ground, he stood
erect, and, shading his eyes with one hand, peered long and attentively
over the trail behind them. The clump of cedars from amid which
the thin column of vapor was slowly climbing into the sky and
the narrow ledge which had been the scene of their stirring adventure
were in view, though its winding course shut a portion from sight.</p>

<p>"I expected it!" suddenly exclaimed Vose.</p>

<p>The others followed the direction of his gaze and saw what had
caused his words. The five Indians, whom Vose had discovered in
camp, were picking their way along the ledge, with their faces
turned from the white men, who were watching them. Despite the
chilly air, caused by the elevation, not one of the warriors wore
a blanket. Two had bows and arrows, three rifles, carried in a
trailing fashion, and all were lithe, sinewy fellows, able to
give a good account of themselves in any sort of fight.</p>

<p>A curious fact noted by all of our friends was that while these
warriors were thus moving away, not one of them looked behind
him. Their long black hair hung loosely about their shoulders,
and in the clear air it was observable that three wore stained
feathers in the luxuriant growth on their crowns.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that they have no suspicion of us?" asked the
parson; "their action in not looking around would imply that."</p>

<p>"Don't fool yourself," was the reply of Adams; "they knowed of
us afore we knowed anything of them."</p>

<p>"Why did they allow us to pass their camp undisturbed?"</p>

<p>"Things weren't in the right shape for 'em. There are only three
guns among 'em, though them kind of Injins are as good with the
bow as the rifle, and they made up their minds that if we let
them alone, they wouldn't bother us."</p>

<p>"You said awhile ago that we should have trouble from them."</p>

<p>"And so we shall; when they reasoned like I was sayin', they
didn't know anything about the little accident that happened to
their chief; it's that which will make things lively."</p>

<p>"We can't see the point where that accident took place," said
Captain Dawson.</p>

<p>"No; the trail curves too much, but we can foller it most of
the way; they're likely to go right on without 'specting anything,
but when they find the horse, it'll set 'em to looking round.
After that, the band will begin to play."</p>

<p>While the party were watching the five Indians, the leader was
seen to pass from view around the curve in the trail, followed
by the next, until finally the fifth disappeared. All this time,
not one of the warriors looked behind him. It was a singular line
of action, and because of its singularity roused the suspicion
of the spectators.</p>

<p>While three of the miners resumed their seats on the boulders
and ground, Vose Adams kept his feet. Doubling each palm, so as
to make a funnel of it, he held one to either eye and continued
scrutinizing the point where he had last seen the hostiles. He
suspected it was not the last of them. Instead of imitating him,
his friends studied his wrinkled countenance.</p>

<p>The air in that elevated region was wonderfully clear, but it
is hardly possible to believe the declaration which the guide
made some minutes later. He insisted that, despite the great distance,
one of the Indians, after passing from view, returned over his
own trail and peeped around the bend in the rocks, and that the
guide saw his black hair and gleaming snake-like eyes. The fact
that Vose waited until the savage had withdrawn from sight, before
making the astonishing declaration, threw some discredit on it,
for it would have required a good telescope to do what he claimed
to have done with the unassisted eye alone.</p>

<p>"You see I was looking for something of the kind," he explained,
"or mebbe I wouldn't have obsarved him."</p>

<p>"Could you tell the color of his eyes?" asked the doubting Ruggles.</p>

<p>"They were as black as coal."</p>

<p>"It is safe to say that," remarked the parson, "inasmuch as I
never met an Indian who had eyes of any other color."</p>

<p>"There are such," said Vose, "and I've seen 'em, though I'll
own they're mighty scarce and I never knowed of any in this part
of the world. Howsumever, I won't purtend that I could see the
color of a man's eyes that fur, but I did see his hair, forehead
and a part of his ugly face. He knowed we was behind him all the
time, and this one wanted to find out what we was doing. When
he larned that, they kept on along the ledge, but there's no saying
how fur they'll go afore they find something's gone wrong."</p>

<p>Captain Dawson showed less interest in this by-play than the
others. He was not concerned with what was behind them, so much
as with what was in front. The belief was so strong with him that
their persistent travel through the night had brought them close
to the fugitives that he begrudged the time necessary for the
animals to rest and eat.</p>

<p>Parson Brush felt that Adams was acting wisely in giving attention
to the rear. It would be the height of folly to disregard these
formidable warriors when they meant trouble. Brush rose to his
feet and using his palms as did the guide, scanned the country
behind them.</p>

<p>He saw nothing of any warrior peering around the rocks, but he
did see something, which escaped even the keen vision of Vose
Adams himself. Beyond the ledge and a little to the left, he observed
a riderless horse, with head high in air, and gazing at something
which the two white men could not see. The parson directed the
attention of Vose to the animal.</p>

<p>"By gracious! it's the chief's horse," he exclaimed; "do you
see that?"</p>

<p>The other two were now looking and all plainly saw a warrior
advance into view, approaching the animal, which, instead of being
frightened, seemed to recognize his friends, and remained motionless
until the Indian came up and grasped the thong about his neck.
Then the two passed from sight.</p>

<p>The identical thing prophesied by Vose Adams had occurred under
the eyes of the four pursuers. The steed of the dead chieftain
had been recovered, and it would not take the hostiles long to
penetrate the mystery of the matter. Vose was wise in taking the
course he did, and his companions were now inclined to believe
his astonishing assertion that he saw one of the number when he
peeped around the curving ledge and watched their actions.</p>

<p>However, it would have been absurd to wait where they were in
order to learn every move of their enemies, for that would have
been a voluntary abandonment of the advantage secured at the cost
of so much labor and danger. Captain Dawson insisted that the
pursuit should be pressed without any thought of the red men,
and Vose consented.</p>

<p>"But there's one thing we mustn't forget, captain," he said,
"and that is that it is daytime and not night."</p>

<p>"I do not catch your meaning," replied the captain, pausing on
the point of moving off to secure his horse.</p>

<p>"It is this: them people in front will keep as sharp an eye to
the rear as to the front; more'n likely it will be sharper, and
it will be a bad thing if they discover us when we're two or three
miles off."</p>

<p>"How shall we prevent it?"</p>

<p>"We can do it, if we're careful. You'll remember that when you
went over this route last, you come upon places where you could
see for a mile or more, 'cause the trail was straight and broad,
while there are others where you can't see more'n a hundred yards.
Them that I've named last is where we must overhaul 'em."</p>

<p>"That sounds well, Vose," said the captain, "but I am unable
to see how you are going to manage so as to bring that about."</p>

<p>"While you're getting the animals ready, I'll take a look ahead."</p>

<p>This was not in the nature of an explanation, but the three willingly
did their part. Vose disappeared almost instantly, and, though
they took but a few minutes to prepare their animals for the resumption
of travel, he was back among them, the expression of his face
showing that he brought news of importance.</p>

<p>"They ain't fur off," he said.</p>

<p>"How far?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"I can't say anything more than that we're purty close to 'em.
Let's push on!"</p>
