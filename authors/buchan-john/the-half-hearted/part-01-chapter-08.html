<p>As the three men went home in the dusk they talked of the day.
Lewis had been in a bad humour, but the company of his friends
exorcised the imp of irritation, and he felt only the mellow gloom
of the evening and the sweet scents of the moor. In such weather
he had a trick of walking with his head high and his nostrils
wide, sniffing the air like the wild ass of the desert with which
the metaphorical George had erstwhile compared him. That young
man meanwhile was occupied with his own reflections. His good
nature had been victimized, he had been made to fetch and carry
continually, and the result was that he had scarcely spoken a
word to Miss Wishart. His plans thus early foiled, nothing remained
but to draw the more fortunate Arthur, so in a conspirator's aside
he asked him his verdict. But Arthur refused to speak. "She is
pretty and clever," he said, "and excellent company." And with
this his lips were sealed, and his thoughts went off on his own
concerns.</p>

<p>Lewis heard and smiled. The sun and wind of the hills beat in
his pulses like wine. To have breathed all day the fragrance of
heather and pines, to have gladdened the eye with an infinite
distance and blue lines of mountain, was with this man to have
drunk the cup of intoxicating youth. The cool gloaming did not
chill; rather it was the high and solemn aftermath of the day's
harvesting. The faces of gracious women seemed blent with the
pageant of summer weather; kindly voices, simple joys&mdash;for a moment
they seemed to him the major matters in life. So far it was pleasing
fancy, but Alice soon entered to disturb with the disquieting
glory of her hair. The family of the Haystouns had ever a knack
of fine sentiment. Fantastic, unpractical, they were gluttons
for the romantic, the recondite, and the dainty. But now had come
a breath of strong wind which rent the meshes of a philandering
fancy. A very new and strange feeling was beginning to make itself
known. He had come to think of Alice with the hot pained affection
which makes the high mountains of the world sink for the time
to a species of mole-hillock. She danced through his dreams and
usurped all the paths of his ambition. Formerly he had thought
of himself&mdash;for the man was given to self-portraiture&mdash;as the
adventurer, the scorner of the domestic; now he struggled to regain
the old attitude, but he struggled in vain. The ways were blocked,
a slim figure was ever in view, and lo! when he blotted it from
his sight the world was dark and the roads blind. For a moment
he had lost his bearings on the sea of life. As yet the discomfiture
was sweet, his confusion was a joy; and it is the first trace
of weakness which we have seen in the man that he accepted the
unsatisfactory with composure.</p>

<p>At the door of Etterick it became apparent that something was
astir. Wheel-marks were clear in the gravel, and the ancient butler
had an air of ceremony. "Mr. Wratislaw has arrived, sir," he whispered
to Lewis, whereat that young man's face shone.</p>

<p>"When? How? Where is he now?" he cried, and with a word to his
companions he had crossed the hall, raced down a lengthy passage,
and flung open the door of his sanctum. There, sure enough, were
the broad shoulders of Wratislaw bending among the books.</p>

<p>"Lord bless me, Tommy, what extraordinary surprise visit is this?
I thought you would be over your ears in work. We are tremendously
pleased to see you."</p>

<p>The sharp blue eyes had been scanning the other's frank sunburnt
face with an air of affectionate consideration. "I got off somehow
or other, as I had to see you, old man, so I thought I would try
this place first. What a fortressed wilderness you live in! I
got out at Gledsmuir after travelling some dreary miles in a train
which stopped at every farm, and then I had to wait an hour till
the solitary dogcart of the inn returned. Hullo! you've got other
visitors." And he stretched out a massive hand to Arthur and George.</p>

<p>The sight of him had lifted a load from these gentlemen's hearts.
The old watchdog had come; the little terriers might now take
holiday. The task of being Lewis's keeper did not by right belong
to them; they were only amateurs acting in the absence of the
properly qualified Wratislaw. Besides, it had been anxious work,
for while each had sworn to himself aforetime to protect his friend
from the wiles of Miss Wishart, both were now devoted slaves drawn
at that young woman's chariot wheel. You will perceive that it
is a delicate matter to wage war with a goddess, and a task unblest
of Heaven.</p>

<p>Supper was brought, and the lamps lit in the cool old room, where,
through the open window, they could still catch the glint of foam
on the stream and the dark gloom of pines on the hill. They fell
ravenously on the meal, for one man had eaten nothing since midday
and the others were fresh from moorland air. Thereafter they pulled
armchairs to a window, and lit the pipes of contentment. Wratislaw
stretched his arms on the sill and looked out into the fragrant
darkness.</p>

<p>"Any news, Tommy?" asked his host. "Things seem lively in the
East."</p>

<p>"Very, but I am ill-informed. Did you lay no private lines of
communication in your travels?"</p>

<p>"They were too short. I picked up a lot of out-of-the-way hints,
but as I am not a diplomatist I cannot use them. I think I have
already made you a present of most. By the by, I see from the
papers that an official expedition is going north from Bardur.
What idiot invented that?"</p>

<p>Wratislaw pulled his head in and sat back in his chair. "You
are sure you don't happen to know?"</p>

<p>"Sure. But it is just the sort of canard which the gentry on
the other side of the frontier would invent to keep things quiet.
Who are the Englishmen at Bardur now?"</p>

<p>The elder man looked shrewdly at the younger, who was carelessly
pulling a flower to pieces. "There's Logan, whom you know, and
Thwaite and Gribton."</p>

<p>"Good men all, but slow in the uptake. Logan is a jewel. He gave
me the best three days' shooting I ever dreamed of, and he has
more stories in his head than George. But if matters got into
a tangle I would rather not be in his company. Thwaite is a gentlemanlike
sort of fellow, but dull&mdash;very, while Gribton is the ordinary
shrewd commercial man, very cautious and rather timid."</p>

<p>"Did you ever happen to hear of a man called Marka? He might
call himself Constantine Marka, or Arthur Marker, or the Baron
Mark&mdash;whatever happened to suit him."</p>

<p>Lewis puzzled for a little. "Yes, of course I did. By George!
I should think so. It was a chap of that name who had gone north
the week before I arrived. They said he would never be heard of
again. He seemed a reckless sort of fool."</p>

<p>"You didn't see him?"</p>

<p>"No. But why?"</p>

<p>"Simply that you came within a week of meeting one of the cleverest
men living, a cheerful being whom the Foreign Office is more interested
in than any one else in the world. If you should hear again of
Constantine Marka, Marker, or Mark, please note it down."</p>

<p>"You mean that he is the author of the <em>canard</em>," said
Lewis, with sharp eyes, taking up a newspaper.</p>

<p>"Yes, and many more. This graceful person will complicate things
for me, for I am to represent the Office in the Commons if we
get back with a decent majority."</p>

<p>Lewis held out a cordial hand. "I congratulate you, Tommy. Now
beginneth the end, and may I be spared to see!"</p>

<p>"I hope you may, and it's on this I want to talk to you. Merkland
has resigned; it will be in the papers to-morrow. I got it kept
out till I could see you!"</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Lewis, with quickening interest.</p>

<p>"And we want you to take his place. I spoke to him, and he is
enthusiastic on the matter. I wired to the Conservative Club at
Gledsmuir, and it seems you are their most cherished possibility.
The leaders of the party are more than willing, so it only remains
for you to consent, my dear boy."</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't&mdash;think &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>can," said the possibility
slowly. "You see, only to-day I told that man Stocks that Merkland
would not resign, and that I was sick of party politics and would
not interfere with his chances. The poor beggar is desperately
keen, and if I stood now he would think me disingenuous."</p>

<p>"But there is no reason why he should not know the truth. You
can tell him that you only heard about Merkland to-night, and
that you act only in deference to strong external pressure."</p>

<p>"In that case he would think me a fool. I have a bad enough reputation
for lack of seriousness in these matters already. The man is not
very particular, and there is nothing to hinder him from blazoning
it up and down the place that I changed my mind in ten minutes
on a friend's recommendation. I should get a very complete licking."</p>

<p>"Do you mind, Lewie, if I advise you to take it seriously? It
is really not a case for little scruples about reputation. There
are rocks ahead of me, and I want a man like you in the House
more than I could make you understand. You say you hate party
politics, and I am with you, but there is no reason why you should
not use them as a crutch to better work. You are in your way an
expert, and that is what we will need above all things in the
next few years. Of course, if you feel yourself bound by a promise
not to oppose Stocks, then I have nothing more to say; but, unless
the man is a lunatic, he will admit the justice of your case."</p>

<p>"You mean that you really want me, Tommy?" said the young man,
in great doubt. "I hate the idea of fighting Stocks, and I shall
most certainly be beaten."</p>

<p>"That is on the knees of the gods, and as for the rest I take
the responsibility. I shall speak to Stocks myself. It will be
a sharp fight, but I see no reason why you should not win. After
all, it is your own countryside, and you are a better man than
your opponent."</p>

<p>"You are the serpent who has broken up this peaceful home. I
shall be miserable for a month, and the house will be divided
against itself. Arthur has promised to help Stocks, while the
Manorwaters, root and branch, are pledged to support him."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best, Lewie, for old acquaintance' sake. It had to
come sooner or later, you know, and it is as well that you should
seize the favourable moment. Now let us drop the subject for to-night.
I want to enjoy myself."</p>

<p>And he rose, stretched his great arms, and wandered about the
room.</p>

<p>To all appearance he had forgotten the very existence of things
political. Arthur, who had a contest to face shortly, was eager
for advice and the odds and ends of information which defend the
joints in a candidate's harness, but the well-informed man disdained
to help. He tested the guns, gave his verdict on rods, and ranged
through a cabinet of sporting requisites. Then he fell on his
host's books, and for an hour the three were content to listen
to him. It was rarely that Wratislaw fell into such moods, but
when the chance came it was not to be lightly disregarded. A laborious
youth had given him great stores of scholarship, and Lewis's books
were a curious if chaotic collection. On the fly-leaf of a little
duodecimo was an inscription from the author of Waverley, who
had often made Etterick his hunting-ground. A Dunbar had Hawthornden's
autograph, and a set of tall classic folios bore the handwriting
of George Buchanan. Lord Kames, Hume, and a score of others had
dedicated works to lairds of Etterick, and the Haystouns themselves
had deigned at times to court the Muse. Lewis's own special books&mdash;college
prizes, a few modern authors, some well-thumbed poets, and a row
in half a dozen languages on some matters of diplomatic interest&mdash;were
crowded into a little oak bookcase which had once graced his college
rooms. Thither Wratislaw ultimately turned, dipping, browsing,
reading a score of lines.</p>

<p>"What a nice taste you have in arrangement!" he cried. "Scott,
Tolstoi, Meredith, an odd volume of a Saga library, an odd volume
of the <em>Corpus Boreale</em>, some Irish reprints, Stevenson's
poems, Virgil and the <em>Pilgrim's Progress</em>, and a French
Gazetteer of Mountains wedged above them. And then an odd Badminton
volume, French <em>Memoires</em>, a Dante, a Homer, and a badly
printed German text of Schopenhauer! Three different copies of
Rabelais, a De Thou, a Horace, and-bless my soul!&mdash;about twenty
books of fairy tales! Lewie, you must have a mind like a lumber-room."</p>

<p>"I pillaged books from the big library as I wanted them," said
the young man humbly. "Do you know, Tommy, to talk quite seriously,
I get more erratic every day? Knocking about the world and living
alone make me a queer slave of whims. I am straying too far from
the normal. I wish to goodness you would take me and drive me
back to the ways of common sense."</p>

<p>"Meaning&mdash;?</p>

<p>"That I am getting cranky and diffident. I am beginning to get
nervous about people's opinion and sensitive to my own eccentricity.
It is a sad case for a man who never used to care a straw for
a soul on earth."</p>

<p>"Lewie, attend to me," said Wratislaw, with mock gravity. "You
have not by any chance been falling in love?"</p>

<p>The accused blushed like a girl, and lied withal like a trooper,
to the delight of the un-Christian George.</p>

<p>"Well, then, my dear fellow, there is hope for you yet. If a
man once gets sentimental, he desires to be normal above all things,
for he has a crazy intuition that it is the normal which women
really like, being themselves but a hair's-breadth from the commonplace.
I suppose it is only another of the immortal errors with which
mankind hedges itself about."</p>

<p>"You think it an error?" said Lewis, with such an air of relief
that George began to laugh and Wratislaw looked comically suspicious.</p>

<p>"Why the tone of joy, Lewie?"</p>

<p>"I wanted your opinion," said the perjured young man. "I thought
of writing a book. But that is not the thing I was talking about.
I want to be normal, aggressively normal, to court the suffrages
of Gledsmuir. Do you know Stocks?"</p>

<p>"Surely."</p>

<p>"An excellent person, but I never heard him utter a word above
a child's capacity. He can talk the most shrieking platitudes
as if he had found at last the one and only truth. And people
are impressed."</p>

<p>Wratislaw pulled down his eyebrows and proceeded to defend a
Scottish constituency against the libel of gullibility. But Lewis
was not listening. He did not think of the impression made on
the voting powers, but on one small girl who clamorously impeded
all his thoughts. She was, he knew, an enthusiast for the finer
sentiments of life, and of these Mr. Stocks had long ago claimed
a monopoly. He felt bitterly jealous&mdash;the jealousy of the innocent
man to whom woman is an unaccountable creature, whose habits and
likings must be curiously studied. He was dimly conscious of lacking
the stage attributes of a lover. He could not pose as a mirror
of all virtues, a fanatic for the True and the Good. Somehow or
other he had acquired an air of self-seeking egotism, unscrupulousness,
which he felt miserably must make him unlovely in certain eyes.
Nor would the contest he was entering upon improve this fancied
reputation of his. He would have to say hard, unfeeling things
against what all the world would applaud as generous sentiment.</p>

<p>When the others had gone yawning to bed, he returned and sat
at the window for a little, smoking hard and puzzling out the
knots which confronted him. He had a dismal anticipation of failure.
Not defeat&mdash;that was a little matter; but an abject show of incompetence.
His feelings pulled him hither and thither. He could not utter
moral platitudes to checkmate his opponent's rhetoric, for, after
all, he was honest; nor could he fill the part of the cold critic
of hazy sentiment; gladly though he would have done it, he feared
the reproach in girlish eyes. This good man was on the horns of
a dilemma. Love and habit, a generous passion and a keen intellect
dragged him alternately to their side, and as a second sign of
weakness the unwilling scribe has to record that his conclusion
as he went to bed was to let things drift&mdash;to take his chance.</p>
