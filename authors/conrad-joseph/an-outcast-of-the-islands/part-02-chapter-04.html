<p>Babalatchi saw Abdulla pass through the low and narrow entrance
into the darkness of Omar’s hut; heard them exchange the usual
greetings and the distinguished visitor’s grave voice asking:
"There is no misfortune&mdash;please God&mdash;but the sight?" and then,
becoming aware of the disapproving looks of the two Arabs who
had accompanied Abdulla, he followed their example and fell back
out of earshot. He did it unwillingly, although he did not ignore
that what was going to happen in there was now absolutely beyond
his control. He roamed irresolutely about for awhile, and at last
wandered with careless steps towards the fire, which had been
moved, from under the tree, close to the hut and a little to windward
of its entrance. He squatted on his heels and began playing pensively
with live embers, as was his habit when engrossed in thought,
withdrawing his hand sharply and shaking it above his head when
he burnt his fingers in a fit of deeper abstraction. Sitting there
he could hear the murmur of the talk inside the hut, and he could
distinguish the voices but not the words. Abdulla spoke in deep
tones, and now and then this flowing monotone was interrupted
by a querulous exclamation, a weak moan or a plaintive quaver
of the old man. Yes. It was annoying not to be able to make out
what they were saying, thought Babalatchi, as he sat gazing fixedly
at the unsteady glow of the fire. But it will be right. All will
be right. Abdulla inspired him with confidence. He came up fully
to his expectation. From the very first moment when he set his
eye on him he felt sure that this man&mdash;whom he had known by reputation
only&mdash;was very resolute. Perhaps too resolute. Perhaps he would
want to grasp too much later on. A shadow flitted over Babalatchi’s
face. On the eve of the accomplishment of his desires he felt
the bitter taste of that drop of doubt which is mixed with the
sweetness of every success.</p>

<p>When, hearing footsteps on the verandah of the big house, he
lifted his head, the shadow had passed away and on his face there
was an expression of watchful alertness. Willems was coming down
the plankway, into the courtyard. The light within trickled through
the cracks of the badly joined walls of the house, and in the
illuminated doorway appeared the moving form of Aissa. She also
passed into the night outside and disappeared from view. Babalatchi
wondered where she had got to, and for the moment forgot the approach
of Willems. The voice of the white man speaking roughly above
his head made him jump to his feet as if impelled upwards by a
powerful spring.</p>

<p>"Where’s Abdulla?"</p>

<p>Babalatchi waved his hand towards the hut and stood listening
intently. The voices within had ceased, then recommenced again.
He shot an oblique glance at Willems, whose indistinct form towered
above the glow of dying embers.</p>

<p>"Make up this fire," said Willems, abruptly. "I want to see your
face."</p>

<p>With obliging alacrity Babalatchi put some dry brushwood on the
coals from a handy pile, keeping all the time a watchful eye on
Willems. When he straightened himself up his hand wandered almost
involuntarily towards his left side to feel the handle of a kriss
amongst the folds of his sarong, but he tried to look unconcerned
under the angry stare.</p>

<p>"You are in good health, please God?" he murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes!" answered Willems, with an unexpected loudness that caused
Babalatchi to start nervously. "Yes! . . . Health! . . . You .
. ."</p>

<p>He made a long stride and dropped both his hands on the Malay’s
shoulders. In the powerful grip Babalatchi swayed to and fro limply,
but his face was as peaceful as when he sat&mdash;a little while ago&mdash;dreaming
by the fire. With a final vicious jerk Willems let go suddenly,
and turning away on his heel stretched his hands over the fire.
Babalatchi stumbled backwards, recovered himself, and wriggled
his shoulders laboriously.</p>

<p>"Tse! Tse! Tse!" he clicked, deprecatingly. After a short silence
he went on with accentuated admiration: "What a man it is! What
a strong man! A man like that"&mdash;he concluded, in a tone of meditative
wonder&mdash;"a man like that could upset mountains&mdash;mountains!"</p>

<p>He gazed hopefully for a while at Willems’ broad shoulders, and
continued, addressing the inimical back, in a low and persuasive
voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"But why be angry with me? With me who think only of your good?
Did I not give her refuge, in my own house? Yes, Tuan! This is
my own house. I will let you have it without any recompense because
she must have a shelter. Therefore you and she shall live here.
Who can know a woman’s mind? And such a woman! If she wanted to
go away from that other place, who am <em>I&mdash;</em>to say no! I
am Omar’s servant. I said: ‘Gladden my heart by taking my house.’
Did I say right?"</p>

<p>"I’ll tell you something," said Willems, without changing his
position; "if she takes a fancy to go away from this place it
is you who shall suffer. I will wring your neck."</p>

<p>"When the heart is full of love there is no room in it for justice," 
recommenced Babalatchi, with unmoved and persistent softness.
"Why slay me? You know, Tuan, what she wants. A splendid destiny
is her desire&mdash;as of all women. You have been wronged and cast
out by your people. She knows that. But you are brave, you are
strong&mdash;you are a man; and, Tuan &mdash;I am older than you&mdash;you
are in her hand. Such is the fate of strong men. And she is of
noble birth and cannot live like a slave. You know her&mdash;and you
are in her hand. You are like a snared bird, because of your strength.
And&mdash;remember I am a man that has seen much&mdash;submit, Tuan! Submit!
. . . Or else . . ."</p>

<p>He drawled out the last words in a hesitating manner and broke
off his sentence. Still stretching his hands in turns towards
the blaze and without moving his head, Willems gave a short, lugubrious
laugh, and asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Or else what?"</p>

<p>"She may go away again. Who knows?" finished Babalatchi, in a
gentle and insinuating tone.</p>

<p>This time Willems spun round sharply. Babalatchi stepped back.</p>

<p>"If she does it will be the worse for you," said Willems, in
a menacing voice. "It will be your doing, and I . . ."</p>

<p>Babalatchi spoke, from beyond the circle of light, with calm
disdain.</p>

<p>"Hai&mdash;ya! I have heard before. If she goes&mdash;then I die. Good!
Will that bring her back do you think &mdash;Tuan? If it is my
doing it shall be well done, O white man! and&mdash;who knows&mdash;you
will have to live without her."</p>

<p>Willems gasped and started back like a confident wayfarer who,
pursuing a path he thinks safe, should see just in time a bottomless
chasm under his feet. Babalatchi came into the light and approached
Willems sideways, with his head thrown back and a little on one
side so as to bring his only eye to bear full on the countenance
of the tall white man.</p>

<p>"You threaten me," said Willems, indistinctly.</p>

<p>"I, Tuan!" exclaimed Babalatchi, with a slight suspicion of irony
in the affected surprise of his tone. "I, Tuan? Who spoke of death?
Was it I? No! I spoke of life only. Only of life. Of a long life
for a lonely man!"</p>

<p>They stood with the fire between them, both silent, both aware,
each in his own way, of the importance of the passing minutes.
Babalatchi’s fatalism gave him only an insignificant relief in
his suspense, because no fatalism can kill the thought of the
future, the desire of success, the pain of waiting for the disclosure
of the immutable decrees of Heaven. Fatalism is born of the fear
of failure, for we all believe that we carry success in our own
hands, and we suspect that our hands are weak. Babalatchi looked
at Willems and congratulated himself upon his ability to manage
that white man. There was a pilot for Abdulla&mdash;a victim to appease
Lingard’s anger in case of any mishap. He would take good care
to put him forward in everything. In any case let the white men
fight it out amongst themselves. They were fools. He hated them&mdash;the
strong fools&mdash;and knew that for his righteous wisdom was reserved
the safe triumph.</p>

<p>Willems measured dismally the depth of his degradation. He&mdash;a
white man, the admired of white men, was held by those miserable
savages whose tool he was about to become. He felt for them all
the hate of his race, of his morality, of his intelligence. He
looked upon himself with dismay and pity. She had him. He had
heard of such things. He had heard of women who . . . He would
never believe such stories. . . . Yet they were true. But his
own captivity seemed more complete, terrible, and final&mdash;without
the hope of any redemption. He wondered at the wickedness of Providence
that had made him what he was; that, worse still, permitted such
a creature as Almayer to live. He had done his duty by going to
him. Why did he not understand? All men were fools. He gave him
his chance. The fellow did not see it. It was hard, very hard
on himself &mdash;Willems. He wanted to take her from amongst
her own people. That’s why he had condescended to go to Almayer.
He examined himself. With a sinking heart he thought that really
he could not&mdash;somehow&mdash;live without her. It was terrible and sweet.
He remembered the first days. Her appearance, her face, her smile,
her eyes, her words. A savage woman! Yet he perceived that he
could think of nothing else but of the three days of their separation,
of the few hours since their reunion. Very well. If he could not
take her away, then he would go to her. . . . He had, for a moment,
a wicked pleasure in the thought that what he had done could not
be undone. He had given himself up. He felt proud of it. He was
ready to face anything, do anything. He cared for nothing, for
nobody. He thought himself very fearless, but as a matter of fact
he was only drunk; drunk with the poison of passionate memories.</p>

<p>He stretched his hands over the fire, looked round and called
out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aissa!"</p>

<p>She must have been near, for she appeared at once within the
light of the fire. The upper part of her body was wrapped up in
the thick folds of a head covering which was pulled down over
her brow, and one end of it thrown across from shoulder to shoulder
hid the lower part of her face. Only her eyes were visible&mdash;sombre
and gleaming like a starry night.</p>

<p>Willems, looking at this strange, muffled figure, felt exasperated,
amazed and helpless. The ex-confidential clerk of the rich Hudig
would hug to his breast settled conceptions of respectable conduct.
He sought refuge within his ideas of propriety from the dismal
mangroves, from the darkness of the forests and of the heathen
souls of the savages that were his masters. She looked like an
animated package of cheap cotton goods! It made him furious. She
had disguised herself so because a man of her race was near! He
told her not to do it, and she did not obey. Would his ideas ever
change so as to agree with her own notions of what was becoming,
proper and respectable? He was really afraid they would, in time.
It seemed to him awful. She would never change! This manifestation
of her sense of proprieties was another sign of their hopeless
diversity; something like another step downwards for him. She
was too different from him. He was so civilized! It struck him
suddenly that they had nothing in common&mdash;not a thought, not a
feeling; he could not make clear to her the simplest motive of
any act of his . . . and he could not live without her.</p>

<p>The courageous man who stood facing Babalatchi gasped unexpectedly
with a gasp that was half a groan. This little matter of her veiling
herself against his wish acted upon him like a disclosure of some
great disaster. It increased his contempt for himself as the slave
of a passion he had always derided, as the man unable to assert
his will. This will, all his sensations, his personality&mdash;all
this seemed to be lost in the abominable desire, in the priceless
promise of that woman. He was not, of course, able to discern
clearly the causes of his misery; but there are none so ignorant
as not to know suffering, none so simple as not to feel and suffer
from the shock of warring impulses. The ignorant must feel and
suffer from their complexity as well as the wisest; but to them
the pain of struggle and defeat appears strange, mysterious, remediable
and unjust. He stood watching her, watching himself. He tingled
with rage from head to foot, as if he had been struck in the face.
Suddenly he laughed; but his laugh was like a distorted echo of
some insincere mirth very far away.</p>

<p>From the other side of the fire Babalatchi spoke hurriedly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here is Tuan Abdulla."</p>
