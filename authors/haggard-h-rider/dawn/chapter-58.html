<p>Arthur took the same path by which he had come--all paths were alike
to him now--but before he had gone ten yards he saw the figure of
George Caresfoot, who appeared to have been watching him. In George's
hand was a riding-whip, for he had ridden from the scene of the fire,
and was all begrimed with smoke and dirt. But this Arthur did not
notice.
</p>
<p>"Hullo," he began; "what----" and then he hesitated; there was a look
in Arthur's eyes which he did not like.
</p><p>But, if George hesitated, Arthur did not. He sprang at him like a wild
cat, and in a second had him by the throat and shoulder. For a moment
he held him there, for in his state of compressed fury George was like
a child in his hands. And as he held him a fierce and almost
uncontrollable desire took possession of him to kill this man, to
throw him down and stamp the life out of him. He conquered it,
however, and loosed the grip on his throat.
</p><p>"Let me go," shrieked George, as soon as he could get breath.
</p><p>Arthur cut short his clamours by again compressing his wind-pipe.
</p><p>"Listen," he said; "a second ago I was very near killing you, but I
remember now that, after all, it is she, not you, who are chiefly to
blame. You only followed your brutal nature, and nothing else can be
expected of a brute. Very likely you put pressure on her, like the cad
that you are, but that does not excuse her, for, if she could not
resist pressure, she is a fool in addition to being what she is. I
look at you and think that soon <u>she</u> will come down to <u>your</u> level,
the level of my successful rival. To be mated to a man like you would
drag an angel down. That will be punishment enough. Now go, you cur!"
</p><p>He swung him violently from him. His fall was broken by a bramblebush. 
It was not exactly a bed of roses, but George thought it safer
to lie there till his assailant's footsteps had grown faint--he did
not wish to bring him back again. Then he crept out of the bush
smarting all over. Indeed, his frame of mind was altogether not of the
most amiable. To begin with, he had just seen his house--which, as
luck would have it, was the only thing he had not sold to Philip, and
which was also at the moment uninsured, owing to the confusion arising
from the transfer of the property--entirely burnt down. All its
valuable contents too, including a fine collection of pictures and
private papers he by no means wished to lose, were irretrievably
destroyed.
</p><p>Nor was his mood improved by the recollection of the events of the
previous night, or by the episode of the bramble-bush, illuminated as
it was by Arthur's vigorous language; or by what he had just
witnessed, for he had arrived in time to see, though from a distance,
the last act of the interview between Arthur and Angela.
</p><p>He had seen him lift her in his arms, kiss her, and place her on the
stone seat, but he did not know that she had fainted. The sight had
roused his evil passions until they raged like the fire he had left.
Then Arthur came out upon him and he made acquaintance with the
bramble-bush as already described. But he was not going to be cheated
out of his revenge; the woman was still left for him to wreak it on.
</p><p>By the time he reached Angela, her faculties were reawakening; but,
though insensibility had yielded, sense had not returned. She sat upon
the stone seat, upright indeed, but rigid and grasping its angles with
her hands. The dog had gone. In the undecided way common to dogs, when
two people to whom they are equally attached separate, it had at that
moment taken it into its head to run a little way after Arthur.
</p><p>George marched straight up to her, livid with fury.
</p><p>"So this is how you go on when your husband is away, is it? I saw you
kissing that young blackguard, though I am not good enough for you.
What, won't you answer? Then it is time that I taught you obedience."
</p><p>"Swish!" went the heavy whip through the air, and fell across her fair
cheek.
</p><p>"Will that wake you, eh, or must I repeat the dose?"
</p><p>The pain of the blow seemed to rouse her. She rose, her loosed hair
falling round her like a golden fleece, and a broad blue stripe across
her ghastly face. She stretched out her hands; she opened her great
eyes, and in them blazed the awful light of madness.
</p><p>He was standing, whip in hand, with his back to the lake; she faced
him, a breathing, beautiful vengeance, and in a whisper so intense
that the air was full of it, commenced a rambling prayer.
</p><p>"Oh, God," she said, "bless my dear Arthur! Oh, Almighty Father,
avenge our wrongs!"
</p><p>She paused and fixed her eyes upon him, and they held him so that he
could not stir. Then, in strange contrast to the hissing whisper,
there broke from her lips a ringing and unearthly laugh that chilled
him to the marrow. So they stood for some seconds.
</p><p>The sound of angry voices had brought the bulldog back at full speed,
and, at the sight of George's threatening attitude, it halted. It had
always hated him, and now it straightway grew more like a devil than a
dog. The innate fierceness of the great brute awoke; it bristled with
fury till each separate hair stood out in knots against the skin, and
saliva ran from its twitching jaws.
</p><p>George did not know that it was near him, but Angela's wild eye fell
upon it. Slowly raising her hand, she pointed at it.
</p><p>"Look behind you," she cried.
</p><p>The sound of her voice broke the spell that was upon him.
</p><p>"Come, give me no more of your nonsense," he said, and then, as much
from vague fear and rampant brutality as from any other reason, again
struck her with the whip.
</p><p>Next second he was aware of a tremendous shock. The dog had seen the
blow, and had instantly launched itself, with all the blind courage of
its race, straight at the striker's throat. It missed its aim,
however, only carrying away a portion of George's under-lip. He yelled
with pain, and struck at it with the whip, and then began a scene
which, in its grotesque horror, beggars all description. Again and
again the dog flew at him, its perfect silence contrasting strangely
with George's shrieks of terror, and the shrill peals of horrible
laughter that came hurrying from Angela's lips as she watched the
struggle.
</p><p>At last the dog gripped the man by the forearm, and, sinking its great
teeth into the flesh, hung its weight upon it. In vain did George,
maddened by the exquisite pain, dash himself and the dog against the
ground: in vain did he stagger round and round the glen, tearing at
its throat with his uninjured hand. The brute hung grimly on.
Presently there came an end. As he reeled along, howling for help and
dragging his fierce burden with him, George stumbled over a dead bough
which lay upon the bank of the lake, and fell backwards into the
water, exactly at the spot where the foundations of the old boat-house
wall rose to within a few inches of the surface. His head struck
heavily against the stonework, and he and the dog, who would not loose
his grip, lay on it for a moment, then they rolled off together into
the deep pool, the man dragging the dog with him. There were a few
ripples, stained with little red filaments, a few air-bubbles that
marked the exhalation of his last breath, and George's spirit had left
its enclosing body, and gone--whither? Ay, reader, whither had it
gone?
</p>
<p>The outcry brought Philip and old Jakes running down to the lake. They
found Angela standing alone on the brink and laughing her wildest.
</p><p>"See," she cried, as they came panting up, "the bridegroom cometh from
his chamber," and at that moment some unreleased air within the body
brought it up for an instant to the surface, so that the torn and
ghastly face and head emerged for a second as though to look at them.
Then it sank again.
</p><p>"The brave dog holds him well--ha, ha, ha! He cannot catch me now--ha,
ha, ha! Nor you, Judas, who sold me. Judas! Judas! Judas!" and,
turning, she fled with the speed of the wind.
</p><p>Mr. Fraser had but just come down, and was walking in his garden, when
he saw this dreadful figure come flying towards him with streaming
hair.
</p><p>"<u>Betrayed</u>," she cried, in a voice which rang like the wail of a lost
soul, and fell on her face at his feet.
</p><p>When she came back to life they found that she was mad.
