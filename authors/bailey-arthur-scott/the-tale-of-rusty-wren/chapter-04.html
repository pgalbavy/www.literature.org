<p>Before Rusty Wren came to live in Farmer Green's dooryard the
family had been known to oversleep now and then. Working hard all
day long as everybody did (except Johnnie Green, who played hard
enough--goodness knows!), they slept very soundly at night. And two
or three times every summer they were sure to rise late, just by
accident.
</p>
<p>Though such a mishap always annoyed Farmer Green, it never troubled
either the hired man or Johnnie in the least. On the contrary, they
seemed to enjoy those occasions. But with Rusty Wren to rouse them
at dawn all that was changed. And Farmer Green remarked one day
that one thing was certain; they would lose no time that summer by
staying in bed too long.
</p><p>That very afternoon he had to go to the village. And when he came
home he brought several surprises with him.
</p><p>Those surprises pleased Johnnie and his mother so much that when he
went to bed that night Farmer Green felt even happier than was
usual with him. He went to bed somewhat early because he said he
had more work than ever to do the next day, on account of his
having gone to the village.
</p><p>But happy as he was that night, the following morning Farmer Green
was quite out of sorts. For the whole family overslept. Not a soul
awaked until the sun had been up at least an hour.
</p><p>"I don't understand----" Farmer Green said at the breakfast
table--"I don't understand why I failed to hear that wren this
morning. I must have been unusually sleepy."
</p><p>The hired man helped himself to some more griddle-cakes and
remarked that it was a pity. But somehow he did not <u>look</u> sorry,
in spite of what he said.
</p><p>"We'll go to bed early to-night," Farmer Green continued, "so we'll
be sure to wake up before sunrise."
</p><p>And, strange to say, the next morning the very same accident
happened again.
</p><p>"I don't see what's come over me," said Farmer Green. "I don't hear
that wren singing right under my window any more. I thought that
maybe the cat had caught him. But there he is this very moment, on
that limb!"
</p><p>Everybody said it certainly was odd, for the wren always sang as
soon as it began to grow light.
</p><p>Well, that night Farmer Green went to bed before dark, declaring
that he must be up bright and early in the morning.
</p><p>"I wish that new clock I brought home day before yesterday was an
alarm clock," he said. "Then I wouldn't have to worry about waking
up on time.... Anyhow, I ought to hear the wren again to-morrow
morning."
</p><p>But Farmer Green hoped in vain. Though the cat had not caught
Rusty, and he had not moved away, either, he no longer sang beneath
Farmer Green's window at dawn.
</p><p>For three mornings he had gone to the orchard to trill his dawn
song; and though they did not know the reason, that was why the
Green family rose late for three mornings running.
</p><p>Once Rusty Wren had been proud to be called Farmer Green's alarm
clock. But now something had happened that made him resolve to stop
waking the household.
</p><p>It was all on account of one of those surprises that Farmer Green
had brought home from the village. For without intending to do any
such thing, Farmer Green had surprised Rusty Wren as well as
Johnnie and his mother.
</p><p>Now, a surprise may be one of two kinds--pleasant or unpleasant.
And, strangely enough, the very thing that delighted the Green
family sent Rusty Wren into a spasm of jealous rage.
</p><p>Of course, it was very silly of him to lose his temper. But he was
too upset to stop to think of that.
