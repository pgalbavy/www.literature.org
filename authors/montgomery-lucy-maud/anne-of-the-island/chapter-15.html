"Just one more week and we go back to Redmond," said Anne.
She was happy at the thought of returning to work, classes
and Redmond friends.  Pleasing visions were also being woven
around Patty's Place.  There was a warm pleasant sense of home
in the thought of it, even though she had never lived there.
<P>
But the summer had been a very happy one, too -- a time of glad living
with summer suns and skies, a time of keen delight in wholesome things;
a time of renewing and deepening of old friendships; a time in which
she had learned to live more nobly, to work more patiently, to play
more heartily.
<P>
"All life lessons are not learned at college," she thought.
"Life teaches them everywhere."
<P>
But alas, the final week of that pleasant vacation was spoiled for Anne,
by one of those impish happenings which are like a dream turned upside down.
<P>
"Been writing any more stories lately?" inquired Mr. Harrison genially
one evening when Anne was taking tea with him and Mrs. Harrison.
<P>
"No," answered Anne, rather crisply.
<P>
"Well, no offense meant.  Mrs. Hiram Sloane told me the other
day that a big envelope addressed to the Rollings Reliable Baking
Powder Company of Montreal had been dropped into the post office
box a month ago, and she suspicioned that somebody was trying for
the prize they'd offered for the best story that introduced the
name of their baking powder.  She said it wasn't addressed in
your writing, but I thought maybe it was you."
<P>
"Indeed, no!  I saw the prize offer, but I'd never dream of
competing for it.  I think it would be perfectly disgraceful to
write a story to advertise a baking powder.  It would be almost
as bad as Judson Parker's patent medicine fence."
<P>
So spake Anne loftily, little dreaming of the valley of
humiliation awaiting her.  That very evening Diana popped into
the porch gable, bright-eyed and rosy cheeked, carrying a letter.
<P>
"Oh, Anne, here's a letter for you.  I was at the office, so I
thought I'd bring it along.  Do open it quick.  If it is what I
believe it is I shall just be wild with delight."  Anne, puzzled,
opened the letter and glanced over the typewritten contents.
<P>
<P>
      Miss Anne Shirley,
      Green Gables,
      Avonlea, P.E. Island.
<P>
"DEAR MADAM: We have much pleasure in informing you that
your charming story `Averil's Atonement' has won the prize
of twenty-five dollars offered in our recent competition.
We enclose the check herewith.  We are arranging for the
publication of the story in several prominent Canadian
newspapers, and we also intend to have it printed in
pamphlet form for distribution among our patrons.
Thanking you for the interest you have shown in
our enterprise, we remain,
<P>
                                   Yours very truly,
                                THE ROLLINGS RELIABLE
                                   BAKING POWDER Co."
<P>
<P>
"I don't understand," said Anne, blankly.
<P>
Diana clapped her hands.
<P>
"Oh, I KNEW it would win the prize -- I was sure of it.
_I_ sent your story into the competition, Anne."
<P>
"Diana -- Barry!"
<P>
"Yes, I did," said Diana gleefully, perching herself on the bed.
"When I saw the offer I thought of your story in a minute, and at
first I thought I'd ask you to send it in.  But then I was afraid
you wouldn't -- you had so little faith left in it.  So I just
decided I'd send the copy you gave me, and say nothing about it.
Then, if it didn't win the prize, you'd never know and you wouldn't
feel badly over it, because the stories that failed were not to be
returned, and if it did you'd have such a delightful surprise."
<P>
Diana was not the most discerning of mortals, but just at this
moment it struck her that Anne was not looking exactly overjoyed.
The surprise was there, beyond doubt -- but where was the delight?
<P>
"Why, Anne, you don't seem a bit pleased!" she exclaimed.
<P>
Anne instantly manufactured a smile and put it on.
<P>
"Of course I couldn't be anything but pleased over your unselfish
wish to give me pleasure," she said slowly.  "But you know -- I'm
so amazed -- I can't realize it -- and I don't understand.  There
wasn't a word in my story about -- about -- " Anne choked a little
over the word -- "baking powder."
<P>
"Oh, _I_ put that in," said Diana, reassured.  "It was as easy as
wink -- and of course my experience in our old Story Club helped me.
You know the scene where Averil makes the cake?  Well, I just stated
that she used the Rollings Reliable in it, and that was why it turned
out so well; and then, in the last paragraph, where PERCEVAL clasps
AVERIL in his arms and says, `Sweetheart, the beautiful coming years
will bring us the fulfilment of our home of dreams,' I added, `in which
we will never use any baking powder except Rollings Reliable.'"
<P>
"Oh," gasped poor Anne, as if some one had dashed cold water on her.
<P>
"And you've won the twenty-five dollars," continued Diana jubilantly.
"Why, I heard Priscilla say once that the Canadian Woman only pays
five dollars for a story!"
<P>
Anne held out the hateful pink slip in shaking fingers.
<P>
"I can't take it -- it's yours by right, Diana.  You sent the
story in and made the alterations.  I -- I would certainly never
have sent it.  So you must take the check."
<P>
"I'd like to see myself," said Diana scornfully.  "Why, what I
did wasn't any trouble.  The honor of being a friend of the
prizewinner is enough for me.  Well, I must go.  I should have
gone straight home from the post office for we have company.
But I simply had to come and hear the news.  I'm so glad for
your sake, Anne."
<P>
Anne suddenly bent forward, put her arms about Diana, and kissed
her cheek.
<P>
"I think you are the sweetest and truest friend in the world,
Diana," she said, with a little tremble in her voice, "and I
assure you I appreciate the motive of what you've done."
<P>
Diana, pleased and embarrassed, got herself away, and poor Anne,
after flinging the innocent check into her bureau drawer as if it
were blood-money, cast herself on her bed and wept tears of shame
and outraged sensibility.  Oh, she could never live this down -- never!
<P>
Gilbert arrived at dusk, brimming over with congratulations,
for he had called at Orchard Slope and heard the news.  But his
congratulations died on his lips at sight of Anne's face.
<P>
"Why, Anne, what is the matter?  I  expected to find you radiant
over winning Rollings Reliable prize.  Good for you!"
<P>
"Oh, Gilbert, not you," implored Anne, in an ET-TU BRUTE tone.
"I thought YOU would understand.  Can't you see how awful it is?"
<P>
"I must confess I can't.  WHAT is wrong?"
<P>
"Everything," moaned Anne.  "I feel as if I were disgraced forever.
What do you think a mother would feel like if she found her
child tattooed over with a baking powder advertisement?
I feel just the same.  I loved my poor little story, and I
wrote it out of the best that was in me.  And it is SACRILEGE to
have it degraded to the level of a baking powder advertisement.
Don't you remember what Professor Hamilton used to tell us in the
literature class at Queen's?  He said we were never to write a
word for a low or unworthy motive, but always to cling to the
very highest ideals.  What will he think when he hears I've
written a story to advertise Rollings Reliable?  And, oh, when it
gets out at Redmond!  Think how I'll be teased and laughed at!"
<P>
"That you won't," said Gilbert, wondering uneasily if it were
that confounded Junior's opinion in particular over which Anne
was worried.  "The Reds will think just as I thought -- that you,
being like nine out of ten of us, not overburdened with worldly
wealth, had taken this way of earning an honest penny to help
yourself through the year.  I don't see that there's anything low
or unworthy about that, or anything ridiculous either.  One would
rather write masterpieces of literature no doubt -- but meanwhile
board and tuition fees have to be paid."
<P>
This commonsense, matter-of-fact view of the case cheered Anne a
little.  At least it removed her dread of being laughed at,
though the deeper hurt of an outraged ideal remained.
