<p><em>WHILE </em>waiting for the stage from Crecy to stop for
them, they called at the wayside inn, and had some refreshment,
while Adolphe took up the story of L’Enfant at the point where
he had left off.</p>

<p>"That good uncle," said he, "had fellow-feeling for one of his
family, and he rescued young Cartouche from his miserable lot
and made him return to his parents. His father was a cooper by
trade, and young Louis, having profited by his youthful misfortunes,
swore that henceforth he would be a good son and a diligent apprentice.
He helped his father to make casks, working from daybreak to sunset.</p>

<p>"He was frequently seen, during lunch hour, amusing his companions
with pretty tricks of sleight-of-hand which he had learned during
the few months he had been with the gypsies. He had become so
adept at this science that on special occasions little Louis and
his family were invited to dinners and suppers before friends,
for they looked forward to the enjoyment of these tricks of Louis’,
and he became a great success in the quarter, and he, on his part,
was proud of his growing renown.</p>

<p>"In the meantime he had attained that happy period where the
least sensitive of human beings feel the beating of their hearts
awaken to the most tender sentiments. Louis Dominique was in love.
The object of his affections was a charming needlewoman of the
Rue Porte Foin, coquettish, with blue eyes, golden hair, and a
fine figure. I have said that this needlewoman was a coquette.
She loved dress, jewels and laces, and it was her desire always
to be better clothed than her companions. The modest income of
Louis Dominique did not permit of his paying for the extravagant
fancies of his poor seamstress, and so Cartouche stole from his
father. The latter soon found out and took steps by which he could
have his boy placed in the Convent of the Lazaretto, in the Faubourg
St. Denis."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Théophraste, "instead of combating with kindness the
wickedness of this child, they drive him to despair by incarcerating
him where he only meets with bad examples, and where the feeling
of revolt increases, and boils over, stifling all other feelings
in his inexperienced mind. I wager that if they had not put Louis
in the House of Correction, that all the trouble would never have
happened."</p>

<p>"Reassure yourself," said Adolphe. "Cartouche was never shut
up in the Convent of the Lazaretto, for while his father had discovered
this crime of Louis’, he did not tell him of it; but one Sunday
morning, he asked his son to take a walk with him. Dominique readily
acquiesced, and they were soon seen walking down the street together.</p>

<p>"‘Where are we going, father?’ asked Louis. ‘No matter where.
By way of the Faubourg St. Denis.’ Louis pricked up his ears.
He knew that at the end of the Faubourg St. Denis was the Lazaretto,
and he also knew that sometimes fathers escorted their boys to
the Lazaretto.</p>

<p>"He at once felt suspicious, for his conscience was not altogether
tranquil, and when they arrived at the corner of the Faubourg
St. Denis, and the battlement of the St. Lazaretto rose before
them, it seemed to him that his father looked unnatural, and he
felt uncomfortable at once. He told his father to continue his
walk, slowly, without hurrying, as he wished to stop at the corner.</p>

<p>When his father returned, the son had disappeared, and he never
saw him again."</p>

<p>About this time the coach had arrived, and Adolphe discontinued
his tale while they mounted to the top. Théophraste recognized
M. Bache, and Mme. Froude, and he at once bowed to them, but they
did not respond. He called them by name, but they remained mute.
Théophraste could not understand this, and turned to ask Adolphe
what he thought of it, and why they did not recognize him.</p>

<p>"That does not astonish me at all," said Adolphe. "It is no wonder
to me, since the dinner the other day, that nobody bows to you.
Your extraordinary behavior was enough to upset them all. Do you
not remember how you were mounted on the table and sang that vulgar
song? There were some young ladies present, Miles. Froude and
Tabouret."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Théophraste, "that accounts for Mme. Bache’s pretending
not to see me the other day in Paris, when she called at the Pharmacy
Crecy and I happened to meet her there. Never mind, Adolphe, continue
where you left off about my father. What happened to him?"</p>

<p>"Well, you forgot about your seamstress at the Rue Point Foin,
and you thought of her no more.</p>

<p>She worried over your disappearance about a fortnight, and then
got somebody else, as is done under similar circumstances to-day.
The necessity to make your way in the world recalled your old
talents, and soon you were robbing passers-by of the things in
their pockets. You operated so adroitly, that you incurred the
admiration of a great sharper, who having seen you work, stopped
you at the corner of the Rue Gallaud, and demanded of you your
money or your life. ‘You shall have my purse only when you have
my life,’ said you to him, and you drew your sword, a small sword
that you had taken the day before from a French Guardsman. The
great sharper flattered you upon your courage, and then upon your
dexterity, and he begged you to accompany him home to the Rue
Bout du Monde. He told you on the way that he sought an associate,
and you could do the business. He also told you that he had a
wife, and the wife had a very pretty sister. After a while you
married this sister, though neither notary nor priest was sent
for. The attachment did not last over six months, because the
sharper, his wife, and his sister-in-law were sent to the gallows.
You had already left them by this time, and had joined the army.
You were caught one day, drunk, by a recruiting officer, and he
took you to the barracks, and made you sign on."</p>

<p>By this time it was seven o’clock, and Adolphe interrupted the
course of his recital at that point, as they had to alight from
the coach.</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Théophraste, "I am curious to know how I was
built. Was I a handsome man, a tall man?"</p>

<p>"They represent you thus at the theater, in M. d’Ennury’s play,
but on the contrary, according to the poet Granvel, you were a
conceited man, and always fond of singing your own praises. You
were dark, lean, small, but of great courage. You were enterprising
and bold, and very alert."</p>

<p>"You have not told me," said Théophraste, "how you got that picture
in the house on the Rue Guinegaud."</p>

<p>"It is a copy of a photograph by Nedar. He photographed a wax
mask, which ought to resemble you, as that mask was made from
your face by the order of the Regent. Nedar photographed that
mask in 1859. The mask was found in the Chateau de St. Germain."</p>

<p>"Oh! I want to see it," cried Théophraste—"to touch it. We must
go to St. Germain to-morrow."</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the house, and Marceline, in neat
dishabille, smilingly opened the door and greeted them.</p>

<p>Théophraste had a great desire to see and touch that waxen mask
that had been made from his face, and the desire was still greater
when Adolphe entered into the details of it. He told him that
it had been in the Chateau de St. Germain en Laye, since the 24th
of April, 1849.</p>

<p>"It appears that the portrait was given by an abbot, one Viallier,
to be inherited by one Richot, an old officer of the Hussars of
King Louis <em>XVI. M. </em>Richot died at St. Germain. He owned
the portrait for many years, one most precious, especially as
it had belonged to the royal family. The wax mask was moulded
by a Florentine artist some days before Cartouche’s punishment.
The head-dress was a woolen or coarse felt cap, his clothing was
a shirt of very coarse linen, a waistcoat, and another vest, and
a doublet of black camelot. But the most remarkable thing of all
was that Cartouche’s hair was cut off of his corpse and pasted
on the waxen mask. The whole was shut up in a gilded wooden chest,
large and deep, of beautiful workmanship. A Venetian glass protected
the portrait, and one could still see the escutcheon of the arms
of France on the chest."</p>

<p>Théophraste asked Adolphe where he had found such precise details,
and was told that they were the result of two days’ searching
in the forgotten archives of the most noted libraries and museums
of Paris. There he found his hair, his moustache, and his clothes,
two hundred years old.</p>

<p>In spite of the horror which these relics of a man so monstrous
ought to have inspired in him, Théophraste could not control his
impatience to see them, to touch them. Here was Théophraste Longuet,
whose name was synonymous with honor, who had always feared the
shedding of blood, cherishing in his heart the coarse remains
of the greatest brigand on earth. When he had again command of
his senses, he did not find in the bottom of his soul a feeling
of absolute despair, but of great pity, a pity so keenly felt
that he did not weep only for himself, Théophraste, but also moved
him to pity Cartouche. He asked himself which was the more dominant,
honest Théophraste, carrying with him the brigand Cartouche, or
the brigand Cartouche, shut up within honest Théophraste. "It
is necessary that we should understand each other," he said aloud.
He felt that he should not have uttered that sentence which must
have seemed odd, but which expressed so well the double and yet
unique preoccupation of his soul that he could not restrain himself.
A great light dawned upon him at the same time, that recalled
the theory of reincarnation that had been explained to him by
M. Lecamus. He connected reincarnation with the natural evolution
of things, and of individuals, that which was no other than transformation.
"Does it not point to the fact that souls reincarnate themselves
in order to pass according to natural law to advancement to a
better state? It is the progressive step of being. Well, the natural
law which certain persons call God, did not find anything better
on the earth than the body of Théophraste Longuet through which
to make the criminal soul of Cartouche evolve to a better state."</p>

<p>When that idea got a firm hold on him, in place of the deepest
despair, which had led him to faint, he found himself prompted
by a sentiment almost akin to pride. He was entrusted with the
destiny of the world. He, the humble but honest Théophraste, entrusted
with the regeneration in ideal splendor, of the soul of shadows
and of the bloody Louis Dominique Cartouche, called L’Enfant.
He accepted this unexpected task willingly, since he could not
do otherwise, and he put himself at once on his guard. Instead
of saying, "It is necessary for us to understand each other,"
he immediately ordered Cartouche to obey Théophraste, and he promised
himself to lead him a life so hard that he could not say without
smiling, "Poor Cartouche." He had charged M. Lecamus to write
everything possible about Louis Dominique Cartouche in such a
way that he could not be ignorant of anything that could be known
of his life. With that and with what his black feather and his
memory had taught him, he justly thought he could resist in spirit
the Other One, which would allow him to act accordingly. He partly
confided his reflections to Adolphe, who approved of them, but
warned him against a tendency he had to separate Théophraste from
Cartouche.</p>

<p>"You must not forget," said he, "that they are one. You have
the instincts of the gardeners of the Ferte-sous-Jonarre. Those
instincts are good, but you have the soul of Cartouche, which
is detestable. Take care. You are his declared enemy, the question
is raised as to who will vanquish— the soul of former years, or
the instincts of today."</p>

<p>Théophraste asked Adolphe if the soul of Cartouche was really
altogether detestable, and was happy to learn that it had some
good points. Adolphe said that Cartouche had expressly forbidden
to kill or even wound passers-by without cause. When he operated
in Paris with some of his bands, and they brought victims to him,
he spoke to them with so much politeness and kindness, that they
always returned a part of the booty to him. Sometimes they would
limit matters to a simple exchange of clothes. When he found letters
or pictures in the pockets of the coats thus exchanged, he ran
after the ex-proprietors to return them. It was a maxim of that
extraordinary individual, that a man ought not to be robbed twice
in the same night, nor were they to be too severely treated, so
as not to prevent the Parisians from going out in the evening.
Therefore he ordered his men to take the utmost care not to kill
any one without good reason. At this time the man was not yet
thoroughly wicked. Up to then he had always had a reason for every
act. It is to be regretted, however, that he had had one hundred
and fifty reasons to assassinate.</p>

<p>Let us return to the wax mask.</p>

<p>Théophraste and Adolphe were going down the stairs in the station
of St. Germain-en-Laye, when suddenly Théophraste thought he saw
a familiar figure ahead of him, among a group of travelers. Moved
by a feeling over which he had no control, he ran rapidly towards
the group, but the figure had disappeared. Where had he seen that
figure before? It was so repulsive to him. Adolphe asked him the
cause of his agitation, and he recovered himself at once.</p>

<p>"I would swear," said Théophraste, "that it was Signor Petito,
the Italian professor of the floor below. What did Signor Petito
come to St. Germain for? I do not want to run foul of him."</p>

<p>"Well, what has he done, then?" asked Adolphe.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. Only if he runs across my way, I swear I will cut
off his ears, and you know I will do it if I say so."</p>

<p>They then went, without any more thought of Signor Petito, to
the castle. They entered the Museum, and asked to see the wax
mask of Cartouche. Théophraste became enraged when he learned
that it was not to be found there, and in his excitement he poked
the handle of his green umbrella into the eye of a plaster cast
of a member of the Legion of Honor. An old guard came up and told
him that he knew well there had been a wax mask of Cartouche in
St. Germain, and that it could be found, he thought, in the library.
But the latter had been closed up for eight days for repairs.
Théophraste gave that man a franc, and they turned their steps
toward the terrace, promising themselves to come again at a later
time, for the farther the wax mask seemed away, the more Théophraste
burned to touch it.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day, and they walked together in the forest,
in the magnificent walk which led to the battlements of the Loge,
which were constructed in front of the Castle Germain, by Queen
Anne of Austria.</p>

<p>As they reached the south angle of the ramparts, it seemed that
Théophraste recognized again, gliding in a thicket, the repulsive
form of Signor Petito.</p>

<p>Adolphe insisted that he was mistaken.</p>
