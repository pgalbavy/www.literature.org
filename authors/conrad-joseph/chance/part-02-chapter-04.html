<p>Marlow emerged out of the shadow of the book-case to get himself
a cigar from a box which stood on a little table by my side. 
In the full light of the room I saw in his eyes that slightly
mocking expression with which he habitually covers up his sympathetic
impulses of mirth and pity before the unreasonable complications
the idealism of mankind puts into the simple but poignant problem
of conduct on this earth.</p>

<p>He selected and lit the cigar with affected care, then turned
upon me, I had been looking at him silently.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, the mockery of his eyes giving a pellucid
quality to his tone, "that you think it's high time I told you
something definite.  I mean something about that psychological
cabin mystery of discomfort (for it's obvious that it must be
psychological) which affected so profoundly Mr. Franklin the chief
mate, and had even disturbed the serene innocence of Mr. Powell,
the second of the ship <em>Ferndale</em>, commanded by Roderick
Anthony&mdash;the son of the poet, you know."</p>

<p>"You are going to confess now that you have failed to find it
out," I said in pretended indignation.</p>

<p>"It would serve you right if I told you that I have.  But I won't. 
I haven't failed.  I own though that for a time, I was puzzled. 
However, I have now seen our Powell many times under the most
favourable conditions&mdash;and besides I came upon a most unexpected
source of information . . . But never mind that.  The means don't
concern you except in so far as they belong to the story.  I'll
admit that for some time the old-maiden-lady-like occupation of
putting two and two together failed to procure a coherent theory. 
I am speaking now as an investigator&mdash;a man of deductions.  With
what we know of Roderick Anthony and Flora de Barral I could not
deduct an ordinary marital quarrel beautifully matured in less
than a year&mdash;could I?  If you ask me what is an ordinary marital
quarrel I will tell you, that it is a difference about nothing;
I mean, these nothings which, as Mr. Powell told us when we first
met him, shore people are so prone to start a row about, and nurse
into hatred from an idle sense of wrong, from perverted ambition,
for spectacular reasons too.  There are on earth no actors too
humble and obscure not to have a gallery; that gallery which envenoms
the play by stealthy jeers, counsels of anger, amused comments
or words of perfidious compassion.  However, the Anthonys were
free from all demoralizing influences.  At sea, you know, there
is no gallery.  You hear no tormenting echoes of your own littleness
there, where either a great elemental voice roars defiantly under
the sky or else an elemental silence seems to be part of the infinite
stillness of the universe.</p>

<p>Remembering Flora de Barral in the depths of moral misery, and
Roderick Anthony carried away by a gust of tempestuous tenderness,
I asked myself, Is it all forgotten already?  What could they
have found to estrange them from each other with this rapidity
and this thoroughness so far from all temptations, in the peace
of the sea and in an isolation so complete that if it had not
been the jealous devotion of the sentimental Franklin stimulating
the attention of Powell, there would have been no record, no evidence
of it at all.</p>

<p>I must confess at once that it was Flora de Barral whom I suspected. 
In this world as at present organized women are the suspected
half of the population.  There are good reasons for that.  These
reasons are so discoverable with a little reflection that it is
not worth my while to set them out for you.  I will only mention
this: that the part falling to women's share being all "influence"
has an air of occult and mysterious action, something not altogether
trustworthy like all natural forces which, for us, work in the
dark because of our imperfect comprehension.</p>

<p>If women were not a force of nature, blind in its strength and
capricious in its power, they would not be mistrusted.  As it
is one can't help it. You will say that this force having been
in the person of Flora de Barral captured by Anthony . . . Why
yes.  He had dealt with her masterfully. But man has captured
electricity too.  It lights him on his way, it warms his home,
it will even cook his dinner for him&mdash;very much like a woman.
But what sort of conquest would you call it?  He knows nothing
of it.  He has got to be mighty careful what he is about with
his captive.  And the greater the demand he makes on it in the
exultation of his pride the more likely it is to turn on him and
burn him to a cinder . . . "</p>

<p>"A far-fetched enough parallel," I observed coldly to Marlow. 
He had returned to the arm-chair in the shadow of the bookcase. 
"But accepting the meaning you have in your mind it reduces itself
to the knowledge of how to use it.  And if you mean that this
ravenous Anthony&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ravenous is good," interrupted Marlow.  "He was a-hungering
and a-thirsting for femininity to enter his life in a way no mere
feminist could have the slightest conception of.  I reckon that
this accounts for much of Fyne's disgust with him.  Good little
Fyne.  You have no idea what infernal mischief he had worked during
his call at the hotel.  But then who could have suspected Anthony
of being a heroic creature.  There are several kinds of heroism
and one of them at least is idiotic.  It is the one which wears
the aspect of sublime delicacy.  It is apparently the one of which
the son of the delicate poet was capable.</p>

<p>He certainly resembled his father, who, by the way, wore out
two women without any satisfaction to himself, because they did
not come up to his supra-refined standard of the delicacy which
is so perceptible in his verses.  That's your poet.  He demands
too much from others.  The inarticulate son had set up a standard
for himself with that need for embodying in his conduct the dreams,
the passion, the impulses the poet puts into arrangements of verses,
which are dearer to him than his own self&mdash;and may make his own
self appear sublime in the eyes of other people, and even in his
own eyes.</p>

<p>Did Anthony wish to appear sublime in his own eyes?  I should
not like to make that charge; though indeed there are other, less
noble, ambitions at which the world does not dare to smile.  But
I don't think so; I do not even think that there was in what he
did a conscious and lofty confidence in himself, a particularly
pronounced sense of power which leads men so often into impossible
or equivocal situations.  Looked at abstractedly (the way in which
truth is often seen in its real shape) his life had been a life
of solitude and silence&mdash;and desire.</p>

<p>Chance had thrown that girl in his way; and if we may smile at
his violent conquest of Flora de Barral we must admit also that
this eager appropriation was truly the act of a man of solitude
and desire; a man also, who, unless a complete imbecile, must
have been a man of long and ardent reveries wherein the faculty
of sincere passion matures slowly in the unexplored recesses of
the heart.  And I know also that a passion, dominating or tyrannical,
invading the whole man and subjugating all his faculties to its
own unique end, may conduct him whom it spurs and drives, into
all sorts of adventures, to the brink of unfathomable dangers,
to the limits of folly, and madness, and death.</p>

<p>To the man then of a silence made only more impressive by the
inarticulate thunders and mutters of the great seas, an utter
stranger to the clatter of tongues, there comes the muscular little
Fyne, the most marked representative of that mankind whose voice
is so strange to him, the husband of his sister, a personality
standing out from the misty and remote multitude.  He comes and
throws at him more talk than he had ever heard boomed out in an
hour, and certainly touching the deepest things Anthony had ever
discovered in himself, and flings words like "unfair" whose very
sound is abhorrent to him.  Unfair!  Undue advantage!  He! Unfair
to that girl?  Cruel to her!</p>

<p>No scorn could stand against the impression of such charges advanced
with heat and conviction.  They shook him.  They were yet vibrating
in the air of that stuffy hotel-room, terrific, disturbing, impossible
to get rid of, when the door opened and Flora de Barral entered.</p>

<p>He did not even notice that she was late.  He was sitting on
a sofa plunged in gloom.  Was it true?  Having himself always
said exactly what he meant he imagined that people (unless they
were liars, which of course his brother-in-law could not be) never
said more than they meant.  The deep chest voice of little Fyne
was still in his ear.  "He knows," Anthony said to himself.  He
thought he had better go away and never see her again.  But she
stood there before him accusing and appealing.  How could he abandon
her?  That was out of the question.  She had no one.  Or rather
she had someone.  That father.  Anthony was willing to take him
at her valuation.  This father may have been the victim of the
most atrocious injustice.  But what could a man coming out of
jail do?  An old man too.  And then&mdash;what sort of man?  What would
become of them both? Anthony shuddered slightly and the faint
smile with which Flora had entered the room faded on her lips. 
She was used to his impetuous tenderness.  She was no longer afraid
of it.  But she had never seen him look like this before, and
she suspected at once some new cruelty of life.  He got up with
his usual ardour but as if sobered by a momentous resolve and
said:</p>

<p>"No.  I can't let you out of my sight.  I have seen you.  You
have told me your story.  You are honest.  You have never told
me you loved me."</p>

<p>She waited, saying to herself that he had never given her time,
that he had never asked her!  And that, in truth, she did not
know!</p>

<p>I am inclined to believe that she did not.  As abundance of experience
is not precisely her lot in life, a woman is seldom an expert
in matters of sentiment.  It is the man who can and generally
does "see himself" pretty well inside and out.  Women's self-possession
is an outward thing; inwardly they flutter, perhaps because they
are, or they feel themselves to be, engaged.  All this speaking
generally.  In Flora de Barral's particular case ever since Anthony
had suddenly broken his way into her hopeless and cruel existence
she lived like a person liberated from a condemned cell by a natural
cataclysm, a tempest, an earthquake; not absolutely terrified,
because nothing can be worse than the eve of execution, but stunned,
bewildered&mdash;abandoning herself passively.  She did not want to
make a sound, to move a limb.  She hadn't the strength. What was
the good?  And deep down, almost unconsciously she was seduced
by the feeling of being supported by this violence.  A sensation
she had never experienced before in her life.</p>

<p>She felt as if this whirlwind were calming down somehow!  As
if this feeling of support, which was tempting her to close her
eyes deliciously and let herself be carried on and on into the
unknown undefiled by vile experiences, were less certain, had
wavered threateningly.  She tried to read something in his face,
in that energetic kindly face to which she had become accustomed
so soon.  But she was not yet capable of understanding its expression. 
Scared, discouraged on the threshold of adolescence, plunged in
moral misery of the bitterest kind, she had not learned to read&mdash;not
that sort of language.</p>

<p>If Anthony's love had been as egoistic as love generally is,
it would have been greater than the egoism of his vanity&mdash;or of
his generosity, if you like&mdash;and all this could not have happened. 
He would not have hit upon that renunciation at which one does
not know whether to grin or shudder.  It is true too that then
his love would not have fastened itself upon the unhappy daughter
of de Barral.  But it was a love born of that rare pity which
is not akin to contempt because rooted in an overwhelmingly strong
capacity for tenderness&mdash;the tenderness of the fiery kind&mdash;the
tenderness of silent solitary men, the voluntary, passionate outcasts
of their kind.  At the time I am forced to think that his vanity
must have been enormous.</p>

<p>"What big eyes she has," he said to himself amazed.  No wonder. 
She was staring at him with all the might of her soul awakening
slowly from a poisoned sleep, in which it could only quiver with
pain but could neither expand nor move.  He plunged into them
breathless and tense, deep, deep, like a mad sailor taking a desperate
dive from the masthead into the blue unfathomable sea so many
men have execrated and loved at the same time. And his vanity
was immense.  It had been touched to the quick by that muscular
little feminist, Fyne.  "I!  I!  Take advantage of her helplessness. 
I!  Unfair to that creature&mdash;that wisp of mist, that white shadow
homeless in an ugly dirty world.  I could blow her away with a
breath," he was saying to himself with horror.  "Never!"  All
the supremely refined delicacy of tenderness, expressed in so
many fine lines of verse by Carleon Anthony, grew to the size
of a passion filling with inward sobs the big frame of the man
who had never in his life read a single one of those famous sonnets
singing of the most highly civilized, chivalrous love, of those
sonnets which . . . You know there's a volume of them.  My edition
has the portrait of the author at thirty, and when I showed it
to Mr. Powell the other day he exclaimed: "Wonderful!  One would
think this the portrait of Captain Anthony himself if . . ." 
I wanted to know what that if was.  But Powell could not say. 
There was something&mdash;a difference.  No doubt there was&mdash;in fineness
perhaps.  The father, fastidious, cerebral, morbidly shrinking
from all contacts, could only sing in harmonious numbers of what
the son felt with a dumb and reckless sincerity.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>Possessed by most strong men's touching illusion as to the frailness
of women and their spiritual fragility, it seemed to Anthony that
he would be destroying, breaking something very precious inside
that being.  In fact nothing less than partly murdering her. 
This seems a very extreme effect to flow from Fyne's words.  But
Anthony, unaccustomed to the chatter of the firm earth, never
stayed to ask himself what value these words could have in Fyne's
mouth.  And indeed the mere dark sound of them was utterly abhorrent
to his native rectitude, sea-salted, hardened in the winds of
wide horizons, open as the day.</p>

<p>He wished to blurt out his indignation but she regarded him with
an expectant air which checked him.  His visible discomfort made
her uneasy. He could only repeat "Oh yes.  You are perfectly honest. 
You might have, but I dare say you are right.  At any rate you
have never said anything to me which you didn't mean."</p>

<p>"Never," she whispered after a pause.</p>

<p>He seemed distracted, choking with an emotion she could not understand
because it resembled embarrassment, a state of mind inconceivable
in that man.</p>

<p>She wondered what it was she had said; remembering that in very
truth she had hardly spoken to him except when giving him the
bare outline of her story which he seemed to have hardly had the
patience to hear, waving it perpetually aside with exclamations
of horror and anger, with fiercely sombre mutters "Enough!  Enough!"
and with alarming starts from a forced stillness, as though he
meant to rush out at once and take vengeance on somebody.  She
was saying to herself that he caught her words in the air, never
letting her finish her thought.  Honest.  Honest.  Yes certainly
she had been that.  Her letter to Mrs. Fyne had been prompted
by honesty. But she reflected sadly that she had never known what
to say to him.  That perhaps she had nothing to say.</p>

<p>"But you'll find out that I can be honest too," he burst out
in a menacing tone, she had learned to appreciate with an amused
thrill.</p>

<p>She waited for what was coming.  But he hung in the wind.  He
looked round the room with disgust as if he could see traces on
the walls of all the casual tenants that had ever passed through
it.  People had quarrelled in that room; they had been ill in
it, there had been misery in that room, wickedness, crime perhaps&mdash;death
most likely.  This was not a fit place.  He snatched up his hat. 
He had made up his mind.  The ship&mdash;the ship he had known ever
since she came off the stocks, his home&mdash;her shelter&mdash;the uncontaminated,
honest ship, was the place.</p>

<p>"Let us go on board.  We'll talk there," he said.  "And you will
have to listen to me.  For whatever happens, no matter what they
say, I cannot let you go."</p>

<p>You can't say that (misgivings or no misgivings) she could have
done anything else but go on board.  It was the appointed business
of that morning.  During the drive he was silent.  Anthony was
the last man to condemn conventionally any human being, to scorn
and despise even deserved misfortune.  He was ready to take old
de Barral&mdash;the convict&mdash;on his daughter's valuation without the
slightest reserve.  But love like his, though it may drive one
into risky folly by the proud consciousness of its own strength,
has a sagacity of its own.  And now, as if lifted up into a higher
and serene region by its purpose of renunciation, it gave him
leisure to reflect for the first time in these last few days. 
He said to himself: "I don't know that man.  She does not know
him either. She was barely sixteen when they locked him up.  She
was a child.  What will he say?  What will he do?  No, he concluded,
I cannot leave her behind with that man who would come into the
world as if out of a grave.</p>

<p>They went on board in silence, and it was after showing her round
and when they had returned to the saloon that he assailed her
in his fiery, masterful fashion.  At first she did not understand. 
Then when she understood that he was giving her her liberty she
went stiff all over, her hand resting on the edge of the table,
her face set like a carving of white marble.  It was all over. 
It was as that abominable governess had said.  She was insignificant,
contemptible.  Nobody could love her. Humiliation clung to her
like a cold shroud&mdash;never to be shaken off, unwarmed by this madness
of generosity.</p>

<p>"Yes.  Here.  Your home.  I can't give it to you and go away,
but it is big enough for us two.  You need not be afraid.  If
you say so I shall not even look at you.  Remember that grey head
of which you have been thinking night and day.  Where is it going
to rest?  Where else if not here, where nothing evil can touch
it.  Don't you understand that I won't let you buy shelter from
me at the cost of your very soul.  I won't.  You are too much
part of me.  I have found myself since I came upon you and I would
rather sell my own soul to the devil than let you go out of my
keeping.  But I must have the right."</p>

<p>He went away brusquely to shut the door leading on deck and came
back the whole length of the cabin repeating:</p>

<p>"I must have the legal right.  Are you ashamed of letting people
think you are my wife?"</p>

<p>He opened his arms as if to clasp her to his breast but mastered
the impulse and shook his clenched hands at her, repeating: "I
must have the right if only for your father's sake.  I must have
the right.  Where would you take him?  To that infernal cardboard
box-maker.  I don't know what keeps me from hunting him up in
his virtuous home and bashing his head in.  I can't bear the thought. 
Listen to me, Flora!  Do you hear what I am saying to you?  You
are not so proud that you can't understand that I as a man have
my pride too?"</p>

<p>He saw a tear glide down her white cheek from under each lowered
eyelid. Then, abruptly, she walked out of the cabin.  He stood
for a moment, concentrated, reckoning his own strength, interrogating
his heart, before he followed her hastily.  Already she had reached
the wharf.</p>

<p>At the sound of his pursuing footsteps her strength failed her. 
Where could she escape from this?  From this new perfidy of life
taking upon itself the form of magnanimity.  His very voice was
changed.  The sustaining whirlwind had let her down, to stumble
on again, weakened by the fresh stab, bereft of moral support
which is wanted in life more than all the charities of material
help.  She had never had it.  Never.  Not from the Fynes.  But
where to go?  Oh yes, this dock&mdash;a placid sheet of water close
at hand.  But there was that old man with whom she had walked
hand in hand on the parade by the sea.  She seemed to see him
coming to meet her, pitiful, a little greyer, with an appealing
look and an extended, tremulous arm.  It was for her now to take
the hand of that wronged man more helpless than a child.  But
where could she lead him? Where?  And what was she to say to him? 
What words of cheer, of courage and of hope?  There were none. 
Heaven and earth were mute, unconcerned at their meeting.  But
this other man was coming up behind her.  He was very close now. 
His fiery person seemed to radiate heat, a tingling vibration
into the atmosphere.  She was exhausted, careless, afraid to stumble,
ready to fall.  She fancied she could hear his breathing.  A wave
of languid warmth overtook her, she seemed to lose touch with
the ground under her feet; and when she felt him slip his hand
under her arm she made no attempt to disengage herself from that
grasp which closed upon her limb, insinuating and firm.</p>

<p>He conducted her through the dangers of the quayside.  Her sight
was dim. A moving truck was like a mountain gliding by.  Men passed
by as if in a mist; and the buildings, the sheds, the unexpected
open spaces, the ships, had strange, distorted, dangerous shapes. 
She said to herself that it was good not to be bothered with what
all these things meant in the scheme of creation (if indeed anything
had a meaning), or were just piled-up matter without any sense. 
She felt how she had always been unrelated to this world.  She
was hanging on to it merely by that one arm grasped firmly just
above the elbow.  It was a captivity.  So be it.  Till they got
out into the street and saw the hansom waiting outside the gates
Anthony spoke only once, beginning brusquely but in a much gentler
tone than she had ever heard from his lips.</p>

<p>"Of course I ought to have known that you could not care for
a man like me, a stranger.  Silence gives consent.  Yes?  Eh? 
I don't want any of that sort of consent.  And unless some day
you find you can speak . . . No!  No!  I shall never ask you. 
For all the sign I will give you you may go to your grave with
sealed lips.  But what I have said you must do!"</p>

<p>He bent his head over her with tender care.  At the same time
she felt her arm pressed and shaken inconspicuously, but in an
undeniable manner. "You must do it."  A little shake that no passer-by
could notice; and this was going on in a deserted part of the
dock.  "It must be done.  You are listening to me&mdash;eh? or would
you go again to my sister?"</p>

<p>His ironic tone, perhaps from want of use, had an awful grating
ferocity.</p>

<p>"Would you go to her?" he pursued in the same strange voice. 
"Your best friend!  And say nicely &mdash;I am sorry.  Would you? 
No!  You couldn't. There are things that even you, poor dear lost
girl, couldn't stand.  Eh? Die rather.  That's it.  Of course. 
Or can you be thinking of taking your father to that infernal
cousin's house.  No!  Don't speak.  I can't bear to think of it. 
I would follow you there and smash the door!"</p>

<p>The catch in his voice astonished her by its resemblance to a
sob.  It frightened her too.  The thought that came to her head
was: "He mustn't." He was putting her into the hansom.  "Oh! 
He mustn't, he mustn't."  She was still more frightened by the
discovery that he was shaking all over. Bewildered, shrinking
into the far off corner, avoiding his eyes, she yet saw the quivering
of his mouth and made a wild attempt at a smile, which broke the
rigidity of her lips and set her teeth chattering suddenly.</p>

<p>"I am not coming with you," he was saying.  "I'll tell the man
. . . I can't.  Better not.  What is it?  Are you cold?  Come! 
What is it?  Only to go to a confounded stuffy room, a hole of
an office.  Not a quarter of an hour.  I'll come for you&mdash;in ten
days.  Don't think of it too much. Think of no man, woman or child
of all that silly crowd cumbering the ground.  Don't think of
me either.  Think of yourself.  Ha!  Nothing will be able to touch
you then&mdash;at last.  Say nothing.  Don't move.  I'll have everything
arranged; and as long as you don't hate the sight of me&mdash;and you
don't&mdash;there's nothing to be frightened about.  One of their silly
offices with a couple of ink-slingers of no consequence; poor,
scribbling devils."</p>

<p>The hansom drove away with Flora de Barral inside, without movement,
without thought, only too glad to rest, to be alone and still
moving away without effort, in solitude and silence.</p>

<p>Anthony roamed the streets for hours without being able to remember
in the evening where he had been&mdash;in the manner of a happy and
exulting lover.  But nobody could have thought so from his face,
which bore no signs of blissful anticipation.  Exulting indeed
he was but it was a special sort of exultation which seemed to
take him by the throat like an enemy.</p>

<p>Anthony's last words to Flora referred to the registry office
where they were married ten days later.  During that time Anthony
saw no one or anything, though he went about restlessly, here
and there, amongst men and things.  This special state is peculiar
to common lovers, who are known to have no eyes for anything except
for the contemplation, actual or inward, of one human form which
for them contains the soul of the whole world in all its beauty,
perfection, variety and infinity.  It must be extremely pleasant. 
But felicity was denied to Roderick Anthony's contemplation. 
He was not a common sort of lover; and he was punished for it
as if Nature (which it is said abhors a vacuum) were so very conventional
as to abhor every sort of exceptional conduct.  Roderick Anthony
had begun already to suffer.  That is why perhaps he was so industrious
in going about amongst his fellowmen who would have been surprised
and humiliated, had they known how little solidity and even existence
they had in his eyes.  But they could not suspect anything so
queer.  They saw nothing extraordinary in him during that fortnight. 
The proof of this is that they were willing to transact business
with him. Obviously they were; since it is then that the offer
of chartering his ship for the special purpose of proceeding to
the Western Islands was put in his way by a firm of shipbrokers
who had no doubt of his sanity.</p>

<p>He probably looked sane enough for all the practical purposes
of commercial life.  But I am not so certain that he really was
quite sane at that time.</p>

<p>However, he jumped at the offer.  Providence itself was offering
him this opportunity to accustom the girl to sea-life by a comparatively
short trip.  This was the time when everything that happened,
everything he heard, casual words, unrelated phrases, seemed a
provocation or an encouragement, confirmed him in his resolution. 
And indeed to be busy with material affairs is the best preservative
against reflection, fears, doubts&mdash;all these things which stand
in the way of achievement.  I suppose a fellow proposing to cut
his throat would experience a sort of relief while occupied in
stropping his razor carefully.</p>

<p>And Anthony was extremely careful in preparing for himself and
for the luckless Flora, an impossible existence.  He went about
it with no more tremors than if he had been stuffed with rags
or made of iron instead of flesh and blood.  An existence, mind
you, which, on shore, in the thick of mankind, of varied interests,
of distractions, of infinite opportunities to preserve your distance
from each other, is hardly conceivable; but on board ship, at
sea, <em>en tete-a-tete</em> for days and weeks and months together,
could mean nothing but mental torture, an exquisite absurdity
of torment.  He was a simple soul.  His hopelessly masculine ingenuousness
is displayed in a touching way by his care to procure some woman
to attend on Flora.  The condition of guaranteed perfect respectability
gave him moments of anxious thought.  When he remembered suddenly
his steward's wife he must have exclaimed <em>eureka</em> with
particular exultation.  One does not like to call Anthony an ass.
But really to put any woman within scenting distance of such a
secret and suppose that she would not track it out!</p>

<p>No woman, however simple, could be as ingenuous as that.  I don't
know how Flora de Barral qualified him in her thoughts when he
told her of having done this amongst other things intended to
make her comfortable.  I should think that, for all <em>her</em>
simplicity, she must have been appalled. He stood before her on
the appointed day outwardly calmer than she had ever seen him
before.  And this very calmness, that scrupulous attitude which
he felt bound in honour to assume then and for ever, unless she
would condescend to make a sign at some future time, added to
the heaviness of her heart innocent of the most pardonable guile.</p>

<p>The night before she had slept better than she had done for the
past ten nights.  Both youth and weariness will assert themselves
in the end against the tyranny of nerve-racking stress.  She had
slept but she woke up with her eyes full of tears.  There were
no traces of them when she met him in the shabby little parlour
downstairs.  She had swallowed them up.  She was not going to
let him see.  She felt bound in honour to accept the situation
for ever and ever unless . . . Ah, unless . . . She dissembled
all her sentiments but it was not duplicity on her part.  All
she wanted was to get at the truth; to see what would come of
it.</p>

<p>She beat him at his own honourable game and the thoroughness
of her serenity disconcerted Anthony a bit.  It was he who stammered
when it came to talking.  The suppressed fierceness of his character
carried him on after the first word or two masterfully enough. 
But it was as if they both had taken a bite of the same bitter
fruit.  He was thinking with mournful regret not unmixed with
surprise: "That fellow Fyne has been telling me the truth.  She
does not care for me a bit."  It humiliated him and also increased
his compassion for the girl who in this darkness of life, buffeted
and despairing, had fallen into the grip of his stronger will,
abandoning herself to his arms as on a night of shipwreck. Flora
on her side with partial insight (for women are never blind with
the complete masculine blindness) looked on him with some pity;
and she felt pity for herself too.  It was a rejection, a casting
out; nothing new to her.  But she who supposed all her sensibility
dead by this time, discovered in herself a resentment of this
ultimate betrayal.  She had no resignation for this one.  With
a sort of mental sullenness she said to herself: "Well, I am here. 
I am here without any nonsense.  It is not my fault that I am
a mere worthless object of pity."</p>

<p>And these things which she could tell herself with a clear conscience
served her better than the passionate obstinacy of purpose could
serve Roderick Anthony.  She was much more sure of herself than
he was.  Such are the advantages of mere rectitude over the most
exalted generosity.</p>

<p>And so they went out to get married, the people of the house
where she lodged having no suspicion of anything of the sort. 
They were only excited at a "gentleman friend" (a very fine man
too) calling on Miss Smith for the first time since she had come
to live in the house.  When she returned, for she did come back
alone, there were allusions made to that outing.  She had to take
her meals with these rather vulgar people. The woman of the house,
a scraggy, genteel person, tried even to provoke confidences. 
Flora's white face with the deep blue eyes did not strike their
hearts as it did the heart of Captain Anthony, as the very face
of the suffering world.  Her pained reserve had no power to awe
them into decency.</p>

<p>Well, she returned alone&mdash;as in fact might have been expected. 
After leaving the Registry Office Flora de Barral and Roderick
Anthony had gone for a walk in a park.  It must have been an East-End
park but I am not sure.  Anyway that's what they did.  It was
a sunny day.  He said to her: "Everything I have in the world
belongs to you.  I have seen to that without troubling my brother-in-law. 
They have no call to interfere."</p>

<p>She walked with her hand resting lightly on his arm.  He had
offered it to her on coming out of the Registry Office, and she
had accepted it silently.  Her head drooped, she seemed to be
turning matters over in her mind.  She said, alluding to the Fynes:
"They have been very good to me." At that he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"They have never understood you.  Well, not properly.  My sister
is not a bad woman, but . . . "</p>

<p>Flora didn't protest; asking herself whether he imagined that
he himself understood her so much better.  Anthony dismissing
his family out of his thoughts went on: "Yes.  Everything is yours. 
I have kept nothing back. As to the piece of paper we have just
got from that miserable quill-driver if it wasn't for the law,
I wouldn't mind if you tore it up here, now, on this spot.  But
don't you do it.  Unless you should some day feel that&mdash;"</p>

<p>He choked, unexpectedly.  She, reflective, hesitated a moment
then making up her mind bravely.</p>

<p>"Neither am I keeping anything back from you."</p>

<p>She had said it!  But he in his blind generosity assumed that
she was alluding to her deplorable history and hastened to mutter:</p>

<p>"Of course!  Of course!  Say no more.  I have been lying awake
thinking of it all no end of times."</p>

<p>He made a movement with his other arm as if restraining himself
from shaking an indignant fist at the universe; and she never
even attempted to look at him.  His voice sounded strangely, incredibly
lifeless in comparison with these tempestuous accents that in
the broad fields, in the dark garden had seemed to shake the very
earth under her weary and hopeless feet.</p>

<p>She regretted them.  Hearing the sigh which escaped her Anthony
instead of shaking his fist at the universe began to pat her hand
resting on his arm and then desisted, suddenly, as though he had
burnt himself.  Then after a silence:</p>

<p>"You will have to go by yourself to-morrow.  I . . . No, I think
I mustn't come.  Better not.  What you two will have to say to
each other&mdash;"</p>

<p>She interrupted him quickly:</p>

<p>"Father is an innocent man.  He was cruelly wronged."</p>

<p>"Yes.  That's why," Anthony insisted earnestly.  "And you are
the only human being that can make it up to him.  You alone must
reconcile him with the world if anything can.  But of course you
shall.  You'll have to find words.  Oh you'll know.  And then
the sight of you, alone, would soothe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's the gentlest of men," she interrupted again.</p>

<p>Anthony shook his head.  "It would take no end of generosity,
no end of gentleness to forgive such a dead set.  For my part
I would have liked better to have been killed and done with at
once.  It could not have been worse for you&mdash;and I suppose it
was of you that he was thinking most while those infernal lawyers
were badgering him in court.  Of you.  And now I think of it perhaps
the sight of you may bring it all back to him. All these years,
all these years&mdash;and you his child left alone in the world.  I
would have gone crazy.  For even if he had done wrong&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he hasn't," insisted Flora de Barral with a quite unexpected
fierceness.  "You mustn't even suppose it.  Haven't you read the
accounts of the trial?"</p>

<p>"I am not supposing anything," Anthony defended himself.  He
just remembered hearing of the trial.  He assured her that he
was away from England, the second voyage of the <em>Ferndale</em>. 
He was crossing the Pacific from Australia at the time and didn't
see any papers for weeks and weeks.  He interrupted himself to
suggest:</p>

<p>"You had better tell him at once that you are happy."</p>

<p>He had stammered a little, and Flora de Barral uttered a deliberate
and concise "Yes."</p>

<p>A short silence ensued.  She withdrew her hand from his arm. 
They stopped.  Anthony looked as if a totally unexpected catastrophe
had happened.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said.  "You mind . . . "</p>

<p>"No!  I think I had better," she murmured.</p>

<p>"I dare say.  I dare say.  Bring him along straight on board
to-morrow. Stop nowhere."</p>

<p>She had a movement of vague gratitude, a momentary feeling of
peace which she referred to the man before her.  She looked up
at Anthony.  His face was sombre.  He was miles away and muttered
as if to himself:</p>

<p>"Where could he want to stop though?"</p>

<p>"There's not a single being on earth that I would want to look
at his dear face now, to whom I would willingly take him," she
said extending her hand frankly and with a slight break in her
voice, "but you &mdash;Roderick."</p>

<p>He took that hand, felt it very small and delicate in his broad
palm.</p>

<p>"That's right.  That's right," he said with a conscious and hasty
heartiness and, as if suddenly ashamed of the sound of his voice,
turned half round and absolutely walked away from the motionless
girl.  He even resisted the temptation to look back till it was
too late.  The gravel path lay empty to the very gate of the park. 
She was gone&mdash;vanished.  He had an impression that he had missed
some sort of chance.  He felt sad. That excited sense of his own
conduct which had kept him up for the last ten days buoyed him
no more.  He had succeeded!</p>

<p>He strolled on aimlessly a prey to gentle melancholy.  He walked
and walked.  There were but few people about in this breathing
space of a poor neighbourhood.  Under certain conditions of life
there is precious little time left for mere breathing.  But still
a few here and there were indulging in that luxury; yet few as
they were Captain Anthony, though the least exclusive of men,
resented their presence.  Solitude had been his best friend. 
He wanted some place where he could sit down and be alone.  And
in his need his thoughts turned to the sea which had given him
so much of that congenial solitude.  There, if always with his
ship (but that was an integral part of him) he could always be
as solitary as he chose.  Yes.  Get out to sea!</p>

<p>The night of the town with its strings of lights, rigid, and
crossed like a net of flames, thrown over the sombre immensity
of walls, closed round him, with its artificial brilliance overhung
by an emphatic blackness, its unnatural animation of a restless,
overdriven humanity.  His thoughts which somehow were inclined
to pity every passing figure, every single person glimpsed under
a street lamp, fixed themselves at last upon a figure which certainly
could not have been seen under the lamps on that particular night. 
A figure unknown to him.  A figure shut up within high unscaleable
walls of stone or bricks till next morning . . . The figure of
Flora de Barral's father.  De Barral the financier&mdash;the convict.</p>

<p>There is something in that word with its suggestions of guilt
and retribution which arrests the thought.  We feel ourselves
in the presence of the power of organized society&mdash;a thing mysterious
in itself and still more mysterious in its effect.  Whether guilty
or innocent, it was as if old de Barral had been down to the Nether
Regions.  Impossible to imagine what he would bring out from there
to the light of this world of uncondemned men.  What would he
think?  What would he have to say?  And what was one to say to
him?</p>

<p>Anthony, a little awed, as one is by a range of feelings stretching
beyond one's grasp, comforted himself by the thought that probably
the old fellow would have little to say.  He wouldn't want to
talk about it. No man would.  It must have been a real hell to
him.</p>

<p>And then Anthony, at the end of the day in which he had gone
through a marriage ceremony with Flora de Barral, ceased to think
of Flora's father except, as in some sort, the captive of his
triumph.  He turned to the mental contemplation of the white,
delicate and appealing face with great blue eyes which he had
seen weep and wonder and look profoundly at him, sometimes with
incredulity, sometimes with doubt and pain, but always irresistible
in the power to find their way right into his breast, to stir
there a deep response which was something more than love&mdash;he said
to himself,&mdash;as men understand it.  More?  Or was it only something
other? Yes.  It was something other.  More or less.  Something
as incredible as the fulfilment of an amazing and startling dream
in which he could take the world in his arms&mdash;all the suffering
world&mdash;not to possess its pathetic fairness but to console and
cherish its sorrow.</p>

<p>Anthony walked slowly to the ship and that night slept without
dreams.</p>
