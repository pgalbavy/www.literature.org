<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The village of Disham lies somewhere on the rolling piece of
cultivated ground in the neighborhood of Lincoln, not so far inland
but that a sound, bringing rumors of the sea, can be heard on
summer nights or when the winter storms fling the waves upon the
long beach. So large is the church, and in particular the church
tower, in comparison with the little street of cottages which
compose the village, that the traveler is apt to cast his mind
back to the Middle Ages, as the only time when so much piety could
have been kept alive. So great a trust in the Church can surely
not belong to our day, and he goes on to conjecture that every
one of the villagers has reached the extreme limit of human life.
Such are the reflections of the superficial stranger, and his
sight of the population, as it is represented by two or three
men hoeing in a turnip-field, a small child carrying a jug, and
a young woman shaking a piece of carpet outside her cottage door,
will not lead him to see anything very much out of keeping with
the Middle Ages in the village of Disham as it is to-day. These
people, though they seem young enough, look so angular and so
crude that they remind him of the little pictures painted by monks
in the capital letters of their manuscripts. He only half understands
what they say, and speaks very loud and clearly, as though, indeed,
his voice had to carry through a hundred years or more before
it reached them. He would have a far better chance of understanding
some dweller in Paris or Rome, Berlin or Madrid, than these countrymen
of his who have lived for the last two thousand years not two
hundred miles from the City of London.</p>

<p>The Rectory stands about half a mile beyond the village. It is
a large house, and has been growing steadily for some centuries
round the great kitchen, with its narrow red tiles, as the Rector
would point out to his guests on the first night of their arrival,
taking his brass candlestick, and bidding them mind the steps
up and the steps down, and notice the immense thickness of the
walls, the old beams across the ceiling, the staircases as steep
as ladders, and the attics, with their deep, tent-like roofs,
in which swallows bred, and once a white owl. But nothing very
interesting or very beautiful had resulted from the different
additions made by the different rectors.</p>

<p>The house, however, was surrounded by a garden, in which the
Rector took considerable pride. The lawn, which fronted the drawing-room
windows, was a rich and uniform green, unspotted by a single daisy,
and on the other side of it two straight paths led past beds of
tall, standing flowers to a charming grassy walk, where the Rev.
Wyndham Datchet would pace up and down at the same hour every
morning, with a sundial to measure the time for him. As often
as not, he carried a book in his hand, into which he would glance,
then shut it up, and repeat the rest of the ode from memory. He
had most of Horace by heart, and had got into the habit of connecting
this particular walk with certain odes which he repeated duly,
at the same time noting the condition of his flowers, and stooping
now and again to pick any that were withered or overblown. On
wet days, such was the power of habit over him, he rose from his
chair at the same hour, and paced his study for the same length
of time, pausing now and then to straighten some book in the bookcase,
or alter the position of the two brass crucifixes standing upon
cairns of serpentine stone upon the mantelpiece. His children
had a great respect for him, credited him with far more learning
than he actually possessed, and saw that his habits were not interfered
with, if possible. Like most people who do things methodically,
the Rector himself had more strength of purpose and power of self-sacrifice
than of intellect or of originality. On cold and windy nights
he rode off to visit sick people, who might need him, without
a murmur; and by virtue of doing dull duties punctually, he was
much employed upon committees and local Boards and Councils; and
at this period of his life (he was sixty-eight) he was beginning
to be commiserated by tender old ladies for the extreme leanness
of his person, which, they said, was worn out upon the roads when
it should have been resting before a comfortable fire. His elder
daughter, Elizabeth, lived with him and managed the house, and
already much resembled him in dry sincerity and methodical habit
of mind; of the two sons one, Richard, was an estate agent, the
other, Christopher, was reading for the Bar. At Christmas, naturally,
they met together; and for a month past the arrangement of the
Christmas week had been much in the mind of mistress and maid,
who prided themselves every year more confidently upon the excellence
of their equipment. The late Mrs. Datchet had left an excellent
cupboard of linen, to which Elizabeth had succeeded at the age
of nineteen, when her mother died, and the charge of the family
rested upon the shoulders of the eldest daughter. She kept a fine
flock of yellow chickens, sketched a little, certain rose-trees
in the garden were committed specially to her care; and what with
the care of the house, the care of the chickens, and the care
of the poor, she scarcely knew what it was to have an idle minute.
An extreme rectitude of mind, rather than any gift, gave her weight
in the family. When Mary wrote to say that she had asked Ralph
Denham to stay with them, she added, out of deference to Elizabeth’s
character, that he was very nice, though rather queer, and had
been overworking himself in London. No doubt Elizabeth would conclude
that Ralph was in love with her, but there could be no doubt either
that not a word of this would be spoken by either of them, unless,
indeed, some catastrophe made mention of it unavoidable.</p>

<p>Mary went down to Disham without knowing whether Ralph intended
to come; but two or three days before Christmas she received a
telegram from Ralph, asking her to take a room for him in the
village. This was followed by a letter explaining that he hoped
he might have his meals with them; but quiet, essential for his
work, made it necessary to sleep out.</p>

<p>Mary was walking in the garden with Elizabeth, and inspecting
the roses, when the letter arrived.</p>

<p>"But that’s absurd," said Elizabeth decidedly, when the plan
was explained to her. "There are five spare rooms, even when the
boys are here. Besides, he wouldn’t get a room in the village.
And he oughtn’t to work if he’s overworked."</p>

<p>"But perhaps he doesn’t want to see so much of us," Mary thought
to herself, although outwardly she assented, and felt grateful
to Elizabeth for supporting her in what was, of course, her desire.
They were cutting roses at the time, and laying them, head by
head, in a shallow basket.</p>

<p>"If Ralph were here, he’d find this very dull," Mary thought,
with a little shiver of irritation, which led her to place her
rose the wrong way in the basket. Meanwhile, they had come to
the end of the path, and while Elizabeth straightened some flowers,
and made them stand upright within their fence of string, Mary
looked at her father, who was pacing up and down, with his hand
behind his back and his head bowed in meditation. Obeying an impulse
which sprang from some desire to interrupt this methodical marching,
Mary stepped on to the grass walk and put her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"A flower for your buttonhole, father," she said, presenting
a rose.</p>

<p>"Eh, dear?" said Mr. Datchet, taking the flower, and holding
it at an angle which suited his bad eyesight, without pausing
in his walk.</p>

<p>"Where does this fellow come from? One of Elizabeth’s roses &mdash;I
hope you asked her leave. Elizabeth doesn’t like having her roses
picked without her leave, and quite right, too."</p>

<p>He had a habit, Mary remarked, and she had never noticed it so
clearly before, of letting his sentences tail away in a continuous
murmur, whereupon he passed into a state of abstraction, presumed
by his children to indicate some train of thought too profound
for utterance.</p>

<p>"What?" said Mary, interrupting, for the first time in her life,
perhaps, when the murmur ceased. He made no reply. She knew very
well that he wished to be left alone, but she stuck to his side
much as she might have stuck to some sleep-walker, whom she thought
it right gradually to awaken. She could think of nothing to rouse
him with except:</p>

<p>"The garden’s looking very nice, father."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes," said Mr. Datchet, running his words together
in the same abstracted manner, and sinking his head yet lower
upon his breast. And suddenly, as they turned their steps to retrace
their way, he jerked out:</p>

<p>"The traffic’s very much increased, you know. More rolling-stock
needed already. Forty trucks went down yesterday by the 12.15&mdash;counted
them myself. They’ve taken off the 9.3, and given us an 8.30 instead&mdash;suits
the business men, you know. You came by the old 3.10 yesterday,
I suppose?"</p>

<p>She said "Yes," as he seemed to wish for a reply, and then he
looked at his watch, and made off down the path towards the house,
holding the rose at the same angle in front of him. Elizabeth
had gone round to the side of the house, where the chickens lived,
so that Mary found herself alone, holding Ralph’s letter in her
hand. She was uneasy. She had put off the season for thinking
things out very successfully, and now that Ralph was actually
coming, the next day, she could only wonder how her family would
impress him. She thought it likely that her father would discuss
the train service with him; Elizabeth would be bright and sensible,
and always leaving the room to give messages to the servants.
Her brothers had already said that they would give him a day’s
shooting. She was content to leave the problem of Ralph’s relations
to the young men obscure, trusting that they would find some common
ground of masculine agreement. But what would he think of <em>HER?
</em>Would he see that she was different from the rest of the
family? She devised a plan for taking him to her sitting-room,
and artfully leading the talk towards the English poets, who now
occupied prominent places in her little bookcase. Moreover, she
might give him to understand, privately, that she, too, thought
her family a queer one&mdash;queer, yes, but not dull. That was the
rock past which she was bent on steering him. And she thought
how she would draw his attention to Edward’s passion for Jorrocks,
and the enthusiasm which led Christopher to collect moths and
butterflies though he was now twenty-two. Perhaps Elizabeth’s
sketching, if the fruits were invisible, might lend color to the
general effect which she wished to produce of a family, eccentric
and limited, perhaps, but not dull. Edward, she perceived, was
rolling the lawn, for the sake of exercise; and the sight of him,
with pink cheeks, bright little brown eyes, and a general resemblance
to a clumsy young cart-horse in its winter coat of dusty brown
hair, made Mary violently ashamed of her ambitious scheming. She
loved him precisely as he was; she loved them all; and as she
walked by his side, up and down, and down and up, her strong moral
sense administered a sound drubbing to the vain and romantic element
aroused in her by the mere thought of Ralph. She felt quite certain
that, for good or for bad, she was very like the rest of her family.</p>

<p>Sitting in the corner of a third-class railway carriage, on the
afternoon of the following day, Ralph made several inquiries of
a commercial traveler in the opposite corner. They centered round
a village called Lampsher, not three miles, he understood, from
Lincoln; was there a big house in Lampsher, he asked, inhabited
by a gentleman of the name of Otway?</p>

<p>The traveler knew nothing, but rolled the name of Otway on his
tongue, reflectively, and the sound of it gratified Ralph amazingly.
It gave him an excuse to take a letter from his pocket in order
to verify the address.</p>

<p>"Stogdon House, Lampsher, Lincoln," he read out.</p>

<p>"You’ll find somebody to direct you at Lincoln," said the man;
and Ralph had to confess that he was not bound there this very
evening.</p>

<p>"I’ve got to walk over from Disham," he said, and in the heart
of him could not help marveling at the pleasure which he derived
from making a bagman in a train believe what he himself did not
believe. For the letter, though signed by Katharine’s father,
contained no invitation or warrant for thinking that Katharine
herself was there; the only fact it disclosed was that for a fortnight
this address would be Mr. Hilbery’s address. But when he looked
out of the window, it was of her he thought; she, too, had seen
these gray fields, and, perhaps, she was there where the trees
ran up a slope, and one yellow light shone now, and then went
out again, at the foot of the hill. The light shone in the windows
of an old gray house, he thought. He lay back in his corner and
forgot the commercial traveler altogether. The process of visualizing
Katharine stopped short at the old gray manor-house; instinct
warned him that if he went much further with this process reality
would soon force itself in; he could not altogether neglect the
figure of William Rodney. Since the day when he had heard from
Katharine’s lips of her engagement, he had refrained from investing
his dream of her with the details of real life. But the light
of the late afternoon glowed green behind the straight trees,
and became a symbol of her. The light seemed to expand his heart.
She brooded over the gray fields, and was with him now in the
railway carriage, thoughtful, silent, and infinitely tender; but
the vision pressed too close, and must be dismissed, for the train
was slackening. Its abrupt jerks shook him wide awake, and he
saw Mary Datchet, a sturdy russet figure, with a dash of scarlet
about it, as the carriage slid down the platform. A tall youth
who accompanied her shook him by the hand, took his bag, and led
the way without uttering one articulate word.</p>

<p>Never are voices so beautiful as on a winter’s evening, when
dusk almost hides the body, and they seem to issue from nothingness
with a note of intimacy seldom heard by day. Such an edge was
there in Mary’s voice when she greeted him. About her seemed to
hang the mist of the winter hedges, and the clear red of the bramble
leaves. He felt himself at once stepping on to the firm ground
of an entirely different world, but he did not allow himself to
yield to the pleasure of it directly. They gave him his choice
of driving with Edward or of walking home across the fields with
Mary&mdash;not a shorter way, they explained, but Mary thought it a
nicer way. He decided to walk with her, being conscious, indeed,
that he got comfort from her presence. What could be the cause
of her cheerfulness, he wondered, half ironically, and half enviously,
as the pony-cart started briskly away, and the dusk swam between
their eyes and the tall form of Edward, standing up to drive,
with the reins in one hand and the whip in the other. People from
the village, who had been to the market town, were climbing into
their gigs, or setting off home down the road together in little
parties. Many salutations were addressed to Mary, who shouted
back, with the addition of the speaker’s name. But soon she led
the way over a stile, and along a path worn slightly darker than
the dim green surrounding it. In front of them the sky now showed
itself of a reddish-yellow, like a slice of some semilucent stone
behind which a lamp burnt, while a fringe of black trees with
distinct branches stood against the light, which was obscured
in one direction by a hump of earth, in all other directions the
land lying flat to the very verge of the sky. One of the swift
and noiseless birds of the winter’s night seemed to follow them
across the field, circling a few feet in front of them, disappearing
and returning again and again.</p>

<p>Mary had gone this walk many hundred times in the course of her
life, generally alone, and at different stages the ghosts of past
moods would flood her mind with a whole scene or train of thought
merely at the sight of three trees from a particular angle, or
at the sound of the pheasant clucking in the ditch. But to-night
the circumstances were strong enough to oust all other scenes;
and she looked at the field and the trees with an involuntary
intensity as if they had no such associations for her.</p>

<p>"Well, Ralph," she said, "this is better than Lincoln’s Inn Fields,
isn’t it? Look, there’s a bird for you! Oh, you’ve brought glasses,
have you? Edward and Christopher mean to make you shoot. Can you
shoot? I shouldn’t think so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, you must explain," said Ralph. "Who are these young
men? Where am I staying?"</p>

<p>"You are staying with us, of course," she said boldly. "Of course,
you’re staying with us&mdash;you don’t mind coming, do you?"</p>

<p>"If I had, I shouldn’t have come," he said sturdily. They walked
on in silence; Mary took care not to break it for a time. She
wished Ralph to feel, as she thought he would, all the fresh delights
of the earth and air. She was right. In a moment he expressed
his pleasure, much to her comfort.</p>

<p>"This is the sort of country I thought you’d live in, Mary,"
he said, pushing his hat back on his head, and looking about him.
"Real country. No gentlemen’s seats."</p>

<p>He snuffed the air, and felt more keenly than he had done for
many weeks the pleasure of owning a body.</p>

<p>"Now we have to find our way through a hedge," said Mary. In
the gap of the hedge Ralph tore up a poacher’s wire, set across
a hole to trap a rabbit.</p>

<p>"It’s quite right that they should poach," said Mary, watching
him tugging at the wire. "I wonder whether it was Alfred Duggins
or Sid Rankin? How can one expect them not to, when they only
make fifteen shillings a week? Fifteen shillings a week," she
repeated, coming out on the other side of the hedge, and running
her fingers through her hair to rid herself of a bramble which
had attached itself to her. "I could live on fifteen shillings
a week&mdash;easily."</p>

<p>"Could you?" said Ralph. "I don’t believe you could," he added.</p>

<p>"Oh yes. They have a cottage thrown in, and a garden where one
can grow vegetables. It wouldn’t be half bad," said Mary, with
a soberness which impressed Ralph very much.</p>

<p>"But you’d get tired of it," he urged.</p>

<p>"I sometimes think it’s the only thing one would never get tired
of,"  she replied.</p>

<p>The idea of a cottage where one grew one’s own vegetables and
lived on fifteen shillings a week, filled Ralph with an extraordinary
sense of rest and satisfaction.</p>

<p>"But wouldn’t it be on the main road, or next door to a woman
with six squalling children, who’d always be hanging her washing
out to dry across your garden?"</p>

<p>"The cottage I’m thinking of stands by itself in a little orchard."</p>

<p>"And what about the Suffrage?" he asked, attempting sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Oh, there are other things in the world besides the Suffrage,"
she replied, in an off-hand manner which was slightly mysterious.</p>

<p>Ralph fell silent. It annoyed him that she should have plans
of which he knew nothing; but he felt that he had no right to
press her further. His mind settled upon the idea of life in a
country cottage. Conceivably, for he could not examine into it
now, here lay a tremendous possibility; a solution of many problems.
He struck his stick upon the earth, and stared through the dusk
at the shape of the country.</p>

<p>"D’you know the points of the compass?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, of course," said Mary. "What d’you take me for?&mdash;a Cockney
like you?" She then told him exactly where the north lay, and
where the south.</p>

<p>"It’s my native land, this," she said. "I could smell my way
about it blindfold."</p>

<p>As if to prove this boast, she walked a little quicker, so that
Ralph found it difficult to keep pace with her. At the same time,
he felt drawn to her as he had never been before; partly, no doubt,
because she was more independent of him than in London, and seemed
to be attached firmly to a world where he had no place at all.
Now the dusk had fallen to such an extent that he had to follow
her implicitly, and even lean his hand on her shoulder when they
jumped a bank into a very narrow lane. And he felt curiously shy
of her when she began to shout through her hands at a spot of
light which swung upon the mist in a neighboring field. He shouted,
too, and the light stood still.</p>

<p>"That’s Christopher, come in already, and gone to feed his chickens," 
she said.</p>

<p>She introduced him to Ralph, who could see only a tall figure
in gaiters, rising from a fluttering circle of soft feathery bodies,
upon whom the light fell in wavering discs, calling out now a
bright spot of yellow, now one of greenish-black and scarlet.
Mary dipped her hand in the bucket he carried, and was at once
the center of a circle also; and as she cast her grain she talked
alternately to the birds and to her brother, in the same clucking,
half-inarticulate voice, as it sounded to Ralph, standing on the
outskirts of the fluttering feathers in his black overcoat.</p>

<p>He had removed his overcoat by the time they sat round the dinner-table,
but nevertheless he looked very strange among the others. A country
life and breeding had preserved in them all a look which Mary
hesitated to call either innocent or youthful, as she compared
them, now sitting round in an oval, softly illuminated by candlelight;
and yet it was something of the kind, yes, even in the case of
the Rector himself. Though superficially marked with lines, his
face was a clear pink, and his blue eyes had the long-sighted,
peaceful expression of eyes seeking the turn of the road, or a
distant light through rain, or the darkness of winter. She looked
at Ralph. He had never appeared to her more concentrated and full
of purpose; as if behind his forehead were massed so much experience
that he could choose for himself which part of it he would display
and which part he would keep to himself. Compared with that dark
and stern countenance, her brothers’ faces, bending low over their
soup-plates, were mere circles of pink, unmolded flesh.</p>

<p>"You came by the 3.10, Mr. Denham?" said the Reverend Wyndham
Datchet, tucking his napkin into his collar, so that almost the
whole of his body was concealed by a large white diamond. "They
treat us very well, on the whole. Considering the increase of
traffic, they treat us very well indeed. I have the curiosity
sometimes to count the trucks on the goods’ trains, and they’re
well over fifty&mdash;well over fifty, at this season of the year."</p>

<p>The old gentleman had been roused agreeably by the presence of
this attentive and well-informed young man, as was evident by
the care with which he finished the last words in his sentences,
and his slight exaggeration in the number of trucks on the trains.
Indeed, the chief burden of the talk fell upon him, and he sustained
it to-night in a manner which caused his sons to look at him admiringly
now and then; for they felt shy of Denham, and were glad not to
have to talk themselves. The store of information about the present
and past of this particular corner of Lincolnshire which old Mr.
Datchet produced really surprised his children, for though they
knew of its existence, they had forgotten its extent, as they
might have forgotten the amount of family plate stored in the
plate-chest, until some rare celebration brought it forth.</p>

<p>After dinner, parish business took the Rector to his study, and
Mary proposed that they should sit in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"It’s not the kitchen really," Elizabeth hastened to explain
to her guest, "but we call it so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It’s the nicest room in the house," said Edward.</p>

<p>"It’s got the old rests by the side of the fireplace, where the
men hung their guns," said Elizabeth, leading the way, with a
tall brass candlestick in her hand, down a passage. "Show Mr.
Denham the steps, Christopher.... When the Ecclesiastical Commissioners
were here two years ago they said this was the most interesting
part of the house. These narrow bricks prove that it is five hundred
years old&mdash;five hundred years, I think&mdash;they may have said six."
She, too, felt an impulse to exaggerate the age of the bricks,
as her father had exaggerated the number of trucks. A big lamp
hung down from the center of the ceiling and, together with a
fine log fire, illuminated a large and lofty room, with rafters
running from wall to wall, a floor of red tiles, and a substantial
fireplace built up of those narrow red bricks which were said
to be five hundred years old. A few rugs and a sprinkling of arm-chairs
had made this ancient kitchen into a sitting-room. Elizabeth,
after pointing out the gun-racks, and the hooks for smoking hams,
and other evidence of incontestable age, and explaining that Mary
had had the idea of turning the room into a sitting-room&mdash;otherwise
it was used for hanging out the wash and for the men to change
in after shooting&mdash;considered that she had done her duty as hostess,
and sat down in an upright chair directly beneath the lamp, beside
a very long and narrow oak table. She placed a pair of horn spectacles
upon her nose, and drew towards her a basketful of threads and
wools. In a few minutes a smile came to her face, and remained
there for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p>"Will you come out shooting with us to-morrow?" said Christopher,
who had, on the whole, formed a favorable impression of his sister’s
friend.</p>

<p>"I won’t shoot, but I’ll come with you," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Don’t you care about shooting?" asked Edward, whose suspicions
were not yet laid to rest.</p>

<p>"I’ve never shot in my life," said Ralph, turning and looking
him in the face, because he was not sure how this confession would
be received.</p>

<p>"You wouldn’t have much chance in London, I suppose," said Christopher.
"But won’t you find it rather dull&mdash;just watching us?"</p>

<p>"I shall watch birds," Ralph replied, with a smile.</p>

<p>"I can show you the place for watching birds," said Edward, "if
that’s what you like doing. I know a fellow who comes down from
London about this time every year to watch them. It’s a great
place for the wild geese and the ducks. I’ve heard this man say
that it’s one of the best places for birds in the country."</p>

<p>"It’s about the best place in England," Ralph replied. They were
all gratified by this praise of their native county; and Mary
now had the pleasure of hearing these short questions and answers
lose their undertone of suspicious inspection, so far as her brothers
were concerned, and develop into a genuine conversation about
the habits of birds which afterwards turned to a discussion as
to the habits of solicitors, in which it was scarcely necessary
for her to take part. She was pleased to see that her brothers
liked Ralph, to the extent, that is, of wishing to secure his
good opinion. Whether or not he liked them it was impossible to
tell from his kind but experienced manner. Now and then she fed
the fire with a fresh log, and as the room filled with the fine,
dry heat of burning wood, they all, with the exception of Elizabeth,
who was outside the range of the fire, felt less and less anxious
about the effect they were making, and more and more inclined
for sleep. At this moment a vehement scratching was heard on the
door.</p>

<p>"Piper!&mdash;oh, damn! &mdash;I shall have to get up," murmured Christopher.</p>

<p>"It’s not Piper, it’s Pitch," Edward grunted.</p>

<p>"All the same, I shall have to get up," Christopher grumbled.
He let in the dog, and stood for a moment by the door, which opened
into the garden, to revive himself with a draught of the black,
starlit air.</p>

<p>"Do come in and shut the door!" Mary cried, half turning in her
chair.</p>

<p>"We shall have a fine day to-morrow," said Christopher with complacency,
and he sat himself on the floor at her feet, and leant his back
against her knees, and stretched out his long stockinged legs
to the fire&mdash;all signs that he felt no longer any restraint at
the presence of the stranger. He was the youngest of the family,
and Mary’s favorite, partly because his character resembled hers,
as Edward’s character resembled Elizabeth’s. She made her knees
a comfortable rest for his head, and ran her fingers through his
hair.</p>

<p>"I should like Mary to stroke my head like that," Ralph thought
to himself suddenly, and he looked at Christopher, almost affectionately,
for calling forth his sister’s caresses. Instantly he thought
of Katharine, the thought of her being surrounded by the spaces
of night and the open air; and Mary, watching him, saw the lines
upon his forehead suddenly deepen. He stretched out an arm and
placed a log upon the fire, constraining himself to fit it carefully
into the frail red scaffolding, and also to limit his thoughts
to this one room.</p>

<p>Mary had ceased to stroke her brother’s head; he moved it impatiently
between her knees, and, much as though he were a child, she began
once more to part the thick, reddish-colored locks this way and
that. But a far stronger passion had taken possession of her soul
than any her brother could inspire in her, and, seeing Ralph’s
change of expression, her hand almost automatically continued
its movements, while her mind plunged desperately for some hold
upon slippery banks.</p>
