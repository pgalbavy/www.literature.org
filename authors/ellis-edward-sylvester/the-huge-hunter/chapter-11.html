<p><em>WITH A WILD </em>snort of alarm, the three buffaloes turned
tail and dashed over the prairie, with the shrieking steam man
in pursuit.</p>

<p>The boy had taken the precaution to bring a rifle with him. When
he saw them flee in this terrified manner, the thought came to
him at once that he would shoot one of them, and take a portion
back to his friends for their supper.</p>

<p>It would to a grand exploit for him, and he would be prouder
of its performance than he was of the construction of the wonderful
steam man.</p>

<p>The lumbering, rolling gait of the buffaloes was not a very rapid
one, and the boy found himself speedily overhauling them without
difficulty. They did not know enough to separate, but kept close
together, sometimes crowding and striking against each other in
their furious efforts to escape.</p>

<p>But, after the chase had continued some time, one of the animals
began to fall in the rear, and Johnny directed his attention toward
him, as he would be the most easy to secure.</p>

<p>This fellow was a huge bull that was slightly lame, which accounted
for his tardiness of gait. Frightened as he was, it was not that
blind terror which had seized the Indians when they discovered
the steam man so close at their heels. The bull was one of those
creatures that if closely pressed would turn and charge the monster.
He was not one to continue a fruitless flight, no matter who or
what was his pursuer.</p>

<p>The boy was not aware of this sturdy trait in the animal, nor
did he dream of anything like resistance.</p>

<p>So he steadily drew toward him, until within twenty yards, when
he let go of his controlling rod, and picked up the rifle beside
him. A bullet from this, he supposed, would kill any animal, however
large, no matter at what portion of his body he aimed.</p>

<p>So raising partly to his feet, and steadying himself as well
as he could, he aimed for the lumping haunch of the animal. The
ball buried itself in his flank, and so retarded his speed, that
the next moment the boy found himself beside him.</p>

<p>The instant this took place, the bull lowered his head, and without
further warning, charged full at the steam man.</p>

<p>The boy saw the danger, but too late to stave it off. His immense
head struck the rear of the monster with such momentum that he
was lifted fully a foot from the ground, the concussion sounding
like the crack of a pistol.</p>

<p>Fortunately the shock did not materially injure the machine,
although the frightened boy expected to be capsized and killed
by the infuriated buffalo.</p>

<p>The latter, when he had made his plunge, instantly drew back
for another, which was sure to be fatal if made as fairly as the
first. The boy retained his presence of mind enough to let on
full steam, and the concern shot away at an extraordinary rate,
bounding over the ground so furiously that the billets of wood
were thrown and scattered in every direction, so that now, from
being the pursuer, he had speedily become the pursued. The tables
were turned with a vengeance!</p>

<p>It was only by providential good fortune that young Brainerd
escaped instant destruction. The wonder was that the steam man
was not so injured as to be unable to travel, in which case the
maddened bull would have left little of him.</p>

<p>As it was, the experience of the boy was such as he could never
forget. When he turned his affrighted glance behind he saw the
enraged animal plunging furiously after him, his head lowered,
his tongue out, his eyes glaring, and his whole appearance that
of the most brutal ferocity.</p>

<p>Had the bull come in collision with the horse or man while in
that mood he would have made short work of him.</p>

<p>But great as was his speed, it could not equal that of the wonderful
steam man, who took such tremendous strides that a few minutes
sufficed to carry him beyond all danger.</p>

<p>Johnny quietly slacked off steam, but he kept up a good swinging
gait, not caring to renew his close acquaintance with his wounded
enemy. The latter speedily discovered he was losing ground, and
finally gave up the pursuit and trotted off at a leisurely rate
to join his companions, apparently none the worse for the slight
wound he had received.</p>

<p>As soon as the boy found himself beyond the reach of the animal's
fury he halted the man and made a minute examination of the machinery.</p>

<p>The head and horns of the buffalo had dented the iron skin of
the steam man, but the blow being distributed over a large area,
inflicted no other damage, if indeed this could be called damage
of itself.</p>

<p>The boy was greatly pleased, not only at his escape but at the
admirable manner in which his invention had borne the shock of
collision. It gave him a confidence in it which hitherto he had
not felt.</p>

<p>Turning his face more toward the mountains, he again let on a
good head of steam and rattled over the prairie at a stirring
rate. An hour was sufficient to bring him to the base, where he
halted.</p>

<p>He had not forgotten the warning of the trapper, but, like almost
any inexperienced person, he could not see any cause for alarm.
He scanned every part of the prairie and mountain that was in
his field of vision, but could detect nothing alarming.</p>

<p>He supposed the parting admonition of Baldy was merely a general
warning, such as a cautious person gives to one whom he has reason
to fear is somewhat careless in his conduct.</p>

<p>It therefore required little self-argument upon his part after
putting his man in proper 'condition,' to start off on a ramble
up the mountain side. It was not his intention to remain more
than an hour or so, unless he came across some game. He had a
goodly quantity of ammunition, and was careful that his rifle
was loaded, so as not to be taken unawares by any emergency.</p>

<p>Although Johnny Brainerd was afflicted with misshapen form, yet
he was very quick and active upon his feet, and bounded along
over the rocks, and across the chasms like a deer, with such a
buoyancy of spirits that he forgot danger.</p>

<p>However, he had gone but a short distance, when he was startled
by a low fierce growl, and turning his head, saw to his horror,
that he had nearly run against a colossal animal, which he at
once recognized as the dreaded grizzly bear.</p>

<p>Such a meeting would have startled an experienced hunter, and
it was therefore with no steady nerve that he hastily brought
his piece to his shoulder and fired.</p>

<p>The shot struck the bear in the body, doing just what his shot
at the buffalo had done some time before. It thoroughly angered
him, without inflicting anything like a serious wound. With a
growl of fury the brute made straight for him.</p>

<p>What would the boy have given, as he sped down the mountain side,
were he now in his wagon, whirled over the prairie at a rate which
would enable him to laugh to scorn any such speed as that of the
brute.</p>

<p>At first he had hopes of reaching his refuge, but he was not
long in seeing that it was impossible, and found that if he escaped
he must find some refuge very speedily.</p>

<p>When he suddenly found himself beneath a goodly-sized tree it
looked like a providential indication to him, and throwing his
gun to the ground, he ascended the tree in the shortest time that
he had ever made.</p>

<p>He was none too soon as it was, for the bear was so close beneath
him that he felt the brush of its claws along his feet, as he
nervously jerked them beyond its reach.</p>

<p>Hastily scrambling to the very top of the tree, he secured himself
among the limbs, and then glanced down to see what his enemy was
doing. Great was his relief to find him sitting on his haunches,
contenting himself with merely casting wistful glances upward.</p>

<p>The sensation of even temporary safety was a relief, but when
a full hour had dragged by, with scarcely a single change of position
upon the part of the brute, Johnny began to ask himself what was
to be the end of all this.</p>

<p>It looked as though the grizzly had resolved in making his dinner
upon the youngster who had dared to fire a shot at him. The patience
of an animal is proverbially greater than that of a human being,
and that of the bear certainly exceeded to a great degree that
of his expected prey who crouched in the limbs above. </p>
