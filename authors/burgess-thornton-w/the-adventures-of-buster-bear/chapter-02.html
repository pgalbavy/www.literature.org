<p>Little Joe Otter was in a terrible rage. It was a bad beginning
for a beautiful day and Little Joe knew it. But who wouldn't be
in a rage if his breakfast was taken from him just as he was about
to eat it? Anyway, that is what Little Joe told Billy Mink. Perhaps
he didn't tell it quite exactly as it was, but you know he was
very badly frightened at the time.</p>

<p>"I was sitting on the bank of the Laughing Brook beside one of
the little pools," he told Billy Mink, "and was just going to
eat a fat trout I had caught, when who should come along but that
great big bully, Buster Bear. He took that fat trout away from
me and ate it just as if it belonged to him! I hate him! If I
live long enough I'm going to get even with him!"</p>

<p>Of course that wasn't nice talk and anything but a nice spirit,
but Little Joe Otter's temper is sometimes pretty short, especially
when he is hungry, and this time he had had no breakfast, you
know.</p>

<p>Buster Bear hadn't actually taken the fish away from Little Joe.
But looking at the matter as Little Joe did, it amounted to the
same thing. You see, Buster knew perfectly well when he invited
Little Joe to come back and get it that Little Joe wouldn't dare
do anything of the kind.</p>

<p>"Where is he now?" asked Billy Mink.</p>

<p>"He's somewhere up the Laughing Brook. I wish he'd fall in and
get drowned!" snapped Little Joe.</p>

<p>Billy Mink just had to laugh. The idea of great big Buster Bear
getting drowned in the Laughing Brook was too funny. There wasn't
water enough in it anywhere except down in the Smiling Pool, and
that was on the Green Meadows, where Buster had never been known
to go. "Let's go see what he is doing," said Billy Mink.</p>

<p>At first Little Joe didn't want to, but at last his curiosity
got the better of his fear, and he agreed. So the two little brown-coated
scamps turned down the Laughing Brook, taking the greatest care
to keep out of sight themselves. They had gone only a little way
when Billy Mink whispered: "Sh-h! There he is."</p>

<p>Sure enough, there was Buster Bear sitting close beside a little
pool and looking into it very intently.</p>

<p>"What's he doing?" asked Little Joe Otter, as Buster Bear sat
for the longest time without moving.</p>

<p>Just then one of Buster's big paws went into the water as quick
as a flash and scooped out a trout that had ventured too near.</p>

<p>"He's fishing!" exclaimed Billy Mink.</p>

<p>And that is just what Buster Bear was doing, and it was very
plain to see that he was having great fun. When he had eaten the
trout he had caught, he moved along to the next little pool.</p>

<p>"They are <em>our</em> fish!" said Little Joe fiercely. "He has
no business catching <em>our</em> fish!"</p>

<p>"I don't see how we are going to stop him," said Billy Mink.</p>

<p>"I do!" cried Little Joe, into whose head an idea had just popped.
"I'm going to drive all the fish out of the little pools and muddy
the water all up. Then we'll see how many fish he will get! Just
you watch me get even with Buster Bear."</p>

<p>Little Joe slipped swiftly into the water and swam straight to
the little pool that Buster Bear would try next. He frightened
the fish so that they fled in every direction. Then he stirred
up the mud until the water was so dirty that Buster couldn't have
seen a fish right under his nose. He did the same thing in the
next pool and the next. Buster Bear's fishing was spoiled for
that day.</p>
