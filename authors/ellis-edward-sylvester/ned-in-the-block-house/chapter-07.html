<p>The declaration of Deerfoot the Shawanoe and of Stinger the scout
that the Wyandots were holding such strict watch of the approaches
to the block-house that no one could leave or approach it, was
proof of the thoroughness of their precautions. It showed still
further that the red men had determined to slay every one within
the building.</p>

<p>The first requisite to the success of such a scheme was to prevent
any one going to their help. The assailants knew just how many
people composed the garrison; and, though the provisions might
last for days and possibly weeks, yet the end must come sooner
or later, when they would lose the power of resistance from very
exhaustion.</p>

<p>Deerfoot, with all the skill he could command, conducted his
two companions to a point along the river bank nearly in front
of the block-house. This attained, he gave them to understand
that they were in a very dangerous position, and it was necessary
to keep carefully hidden from the Wyandots.</p>

<p>Having gone thus far, it would seem that the subtle Shawanoe
ought to have gone further and secured entrance into the block-house
itself. Had Colonel Preston known the exact situation, this could
have been done, as in the case of the scout Stinger; but it was
necessary first that a perfect understanding should be established.
There were Wyandots everywhere: the watchful Shawanoe heard them
moving stealthily hither and thither, and any one less skilful
than he would have brought on a collision long before.</p>

<p>Any act, signal or communication which would apprise Colonel
Preston of the truth, would attract the notice of the watchful
red men themselves; so it would seem that Deerfoot had all his
pains for nothing. But we shall show that the remarkable Shawanoe
youth had not reached the end of his rope by any means.</p>

<p>A question has doubtless presented itself to the reader as to
the necessity of the lads entering the block-house at all. Inasmuch
as Stinger wished to get out, and they wished to get in, they
might as well have exchanged positions. Deerfoot could turn about
and hasten to Wild Oaks with news of the danger of the little
garrison, leaving all the men to defend it until assistance arrived.</p>

<p>But, as afterwards became known, Deerfoot was following a special
plan of his own. He was quick to discover that Colonel Preston
knew his peril and would therefore do his utmost to defend the
post; but the wily Shawanoe, from what he had learned, believed
that the force of assailants was so numerous and strong, that
they were able to carry the post before help could reach it from
Wild Oaks. In his estimation, the all-important thing was to get
re-inforcements into the block-house without an hour's unnecessary
delay: that done, the time would then come for application to
their friends on the Ohio.</p>

<p>If Ned Preston and Blossom Brown could be safely passed through
the door, there would be two guns added to the five within, and
such an addition was likely to prove the "balance of power," that
would save the garrison from destruction.</p>

<p>This was the belief of the Shawanoe, and, though he did not explain
his purpose at first, he was none the less determined that Colonel
Preston should receive the benefit of these two guns, before application
was made to his brother.</p>

<p>Between the block-house and Licking river was a cleared space
of one hundred yards, the cultivated ground on every hand being
so extensive that the stockade could not be approached by any
foe unseen, except at night. The banks of the Licking were from
four to six feet above the surface, while along the eastern shore,
in front of the block-house, was a fringe of bushes and undergrowth,
which offered a tempting hiding-place to a foe.</p>

<p>It was natural to expect the Wyandots to make use of this place,
and they had done so, but they already commanded the situation.</p>

<p>Deerfoot had one important advantage in the fact that the Wyandots
held no suspicion of the presence of any friends of the whites
in the vicinity of the block-house, and consequently they were
not searching for such allies.</p>

<p>But it was easy to lose this ground, and he convinced his companions
that if it should be found impossible to join Colonel Preston,
it would be equally fatal to attempt to leave the neighborhood
before night: detection was inevitable.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs when the sun rose on the morning
succeeding Jo Stinger's failure to pass through the lines (which
effort was made a number of hours before Deerfoot and his friends
reached the spot). The sky had cleared, and there was scarcely
a cloud to obscure its light.</p>

<p>Peeping carefully out from among the bushes and undergrowth,
the boys saw the massive block-house standing at the corner of
the stockade, grim, silent, and as forbidding as though no living
person was within. The heavy oaken door, the huge logs, the narrow
windows, the steeply shelving roof, with one trap-door visible,
the wooden chimney, the numerous loopholes, the sides of the stockade
stretching away to the left from the building itself: all these
added to the gloom and tomb-like appearance of the structure.</p>

<p>Not a person could be seen, as a matter of course, nor was any
sound heard from the interior; but while the three were stealthily
studying the building, they observed a faint, steely blue smoke
creeping upward from the wooden chimney. Mrs. Preston had doubtless
kindled a fire on the hearth in the lower story, for the comfort
of her little ones on this crisp autumn morning, or she was preparing
a meal for the garrison.</p>

<p>"If we were sure that door would be opened on the instant," said
young Preston, alluding to the entrance of the block-house which
confronted them, "we could make a dash across the clearing and
get inside, before the Wyandots would suspect what was going on."</p>

<p>Deerfoot nodded his head to signify that his friend was right,
but the problem remained as to how Colonel Preston should be apprised
of the fact that his friends were waiting so near at hand for
a chance to join him.</p>

<p>These boys were huddled as closely together as possible under
the bank, where they were not likely to be seen, because there
was no special reason for the Wyandots seeking the same hiding-place.</p>

<p>Having reached the spot through much tribulation, as may be said,
the friends were careful not to throw away the advantage gained.
They stealthily peeped over the edge of the bank, and their words
were spoken in guarded undertones that could not have been heard
by any one within twenty feet.</p>

<p>"I's got the idee," said Blossom Brown, thrusting forward his
dusky countenance all aglow with pleasure: "I know jes' how we
can tell de Colonel we're out yar, without de Injines knowing
a thing about it."</p>

<p>"How would my brother with the face of the night do?" asked the
Shawanoe, turning toward him.</p>

<p>"I'll jes' gib a lot ob hoots like a big owl dat am scared, and
de Colonel will know it's me, 'cause de last time I war at de
block-house I done it to please de little gals, Mary and Susie."</p>

<p>"That will never do," Ned Preston hastened to say; "for the Wyandots
would suspect the truth the instant they heard your hooting, and
it wouldn't be long before they called on us."</p>

<p>"Den," added the African, who seemed to think the responsibility
of settling the question rested with him, "let's jes' set up a
yellin' dat de Colonel will hear, and make a rush for de house:
he'll know we're comin' and will slip down and open de door, or,
if he don't, we can climb ober de fence and run round de back
way."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe did not consider the proposals of Blossom worthy
of notice, though they were made in all seriousness. Looking at
Ned, he asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will my brother let Deerfoot see one of his letters?"</p>

<p>Wondering at the meaning of this request, Preston drew a missive
from the inner pocket of his coat and handed it to the Indian.
It was written on a large sheet of blue paper, the last page of
which was unruled, so as to permit the superscription, for the
ordinary envelope was unknown in those days. The sheet was carefully
folded and doubled within itself, being sealed with a large red
wafer, and the name of Colonel Hugh Preston, and the somewhat
voluminous address, were written in a large plain hand in ink
of glossy blackness.</p>

<p>It was the penmanship which excited the wonder of the Shawanoe
more than did anything on which he had looked for many a day.
He held the letter in his hand, and, for several minutes, scrutinized
the writing with an interest that can hardly be described. Through
the paper his keen eyes detected the faint tracery of some of
the letters inside. Balancing the missive edgewise, between his
thumb and forefinger, he gently pressed it until it partly spread
open, despite the seal. Then, raising it before his face, he closed
one eye as though he were aiming his arrow at something, and peeped
within.</p>

<p>The glimpse of the writing was as pleasing to him as the sight
of the circus is to the urchin who creeps under the canvas; and,
though he could not decipher the meaning of a character, he stared
for several minutes, almost holding his breath, as though he would
force the secrets from the "Rosetta stone."</p>

<p>He had heard of such things before, but it was hard for his untutored
mind to understand that what a man had said to his friend was
in that little package, and when opened, it would speak the same
message to him. His feelings must have been similar to those of
his white brother, could he have seen the telephone of to-day
perform its wonderful work.</p>

<p>"We write our words on the paper," said Ned, hoping to help the
mind of the youth grasp the subject: "and when our friend gets
the paper, there are the words looking him in the face."</p>

<p>Deerfoot inclined his head, as though he understood the explanation,
but Ned saw that it was like the assent of the school-boy who
doesn't wish his classmates to consider him stupid.</p>

<p>"If I should make a figure on the paper that looked like a deer,
and some one should take it to you, and you looked at it, you
would know that it was meant for a deer, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>The Indian nodded emphatically this time: he clearly understood
<em>that</em>.</p>

<p>"Suppose I should make some lines and characters which you and
I agreed beforehand should mean, 'I am your friend and brother';
when those lines and characters were brought to you on paper,
wouldn't you remember what they meant?"</p>

<p>The black eyes of Deerfoot sparkled. He had caught, for the first
time in his life, an inkling of the mystery. He saw, as through
a glass, darkly, the achievements of the white man who could forward
his words hundreds of miles, hidden in a small piece of paper.</p>

<p>"Will my brother teach Deerfoot how to send his thoughts to the
Great Spirit?"</p>

<p>There was a wistful expression in the dark eyes of the Shawanoe,
which touched Ned Preston. The voice of the lad trembled, as he
answered impressively&mdash;</p>

<p>"You need no such means to reach the Great Spirit, as you must
have heard from your own people: <em>our</em> Great Spirit is
always looking down in kindness on his children, and his ears
are ever open to hear what they have asked him."</p>

<p>"Will my white brother tell Deerfoot of the Great Spirit of the
pale faces, that the missionary talks about?"</p>

<p>"I will be glad to do so, for it is what all of your people should
know; when we can gain the time, I will teach you how to read
books and write letters just as well as any white man can do,
for I am sure that one who is so bright as you, will learn it
with much ease."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot will never forget his pale-faced brother," said the
Shawanoe gratefully.</p>

<p>"And if masser Ned don't got de time, den I'll jes' take you
hummin' frough all de knowledge dat you want," said Blossom with
an exaggerated idea of his importance.</p>

<p>"It would be well for you to learn how to read and write yourself,
before trying to teach others," said Preston.</p>

<p>"I reckon dar aint many dat can beat me 'round de settlements;
I can spell 'dog' and 'cat'."</p>

<p>"Let's hear you."</p>

<p>"D-o-a-g, dog; r-a-t, cat&mdash;no, dat spells something else, &mdash;I
forget what, but I'm dar all de time, jes' de same."</p>

<p>Deerfoot was still holding the letter in his hand and looking
earnestly at Ned, without noticing the words of Blossom.</p>

<p>"Can my white brother write on the back of this the words which
Colonel Preston can read?"</p>

<p>It flashed upon young Preston that the keen-witted youth was
unraveling the plan he had held in mind from the first.</p>

<p>"Certainly I can."</p>

<p>"Write some message on this paper for him."</p>

<p>"But, Deerfoot, I have no pen, nor ink, nor pencil, or I would
only be too glad to do so."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe was prepared for this.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot will bring you something that will do."</p>

<p>He moved away from his young friends, with that silence and stealth
which seemed a part of his nature, while the delighted and expectant
friend turned to Blossom Brown&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you understand what his plan is to reach&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ned did not finish the question, for he saw that his servant,
despite the gravity of the situation and the crispness of the
air, was lying on his side sunk in a sound slumber. Fortunately
his posture was such an easy one that he did not breathe loud
enough to create any danger of being heard.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe was gone only a few minutes, when he reappeared
holding in his hand a piece of reddish brown stone, almost as
soft as the mineral known as "red chalk," and which he had evidently
broken from some crumbling rock.</p>

<p>Ned Preston carefully sharpened it to a point, as though it were
a lead-pencil. It could not be said to work very well, when applied
to paper, but he found that patience and care would enable him
to write considerable that would be legible to any one who understood
writing.</p>

<p>Accordingly with much pains and labor he traced the following
lines, first consulting Deerfoot as to what should be placed in
the communication&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>DEAR UNCLE HUGH</em>:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot, the friendly Shawanoe, Blossom Brown, our servant,
and I are along the bank of the river, exactly opposite the front
of the block-house. We want to join you, so as to help you fight
off the Wyandots, but they are so plenty all around us that we
daresn't try it, unless you are prepared to let us in the door,
the instant we reach it. When you are ready, wave your hand through
the front window, and we'll make the start.</p>
