<p>Leland succeeded in getting outside the circle of savages when,
feeling himself in the open woods, he dashed away at the top of
his speed. He ran with astonishing swiftness for a few moments,
when, as might naturally be expected, he so exhausted himself
that he was scarcely able to stand.</p>

<p>From the moment of starting, the Shawnees seemed to understand
the identity of the fugitives; and while they did not neglect
to send in pursuit of the flying negro, four of their fleetest
runners instantly dashed after the white man. Were it in the daylight,
the latter would not have stood a moment's chance against them;
but he hoped to elude them in the darkness and gloom of the woods.
The obscuration being only partial, his pursuers close in his
rear, and the noise of the rustling leaves beneath his feet betraying
every step, it will be seen at once that he was in the most constant
and imminent danger.</p>

<p>Pausing but a few seconds&mdash;barely sufficient to catch his "second
breath," he again leaped away. There is no telling how long he
would have run, had he not stepped into a hole, deep and narrow&mdash;the
mouth of a fox's burrow evidently, for it was quite hidden by
overgrowth&mdash;he fell into the hole with a sudden violence which
confused and stunned him. Panting and exhausted, he lay still
and awaited his pursuers.</p>

<p>They were far closer than he imagined. He seemed scarcely to
have disappeared, when the whole four passed within a few feet
of him. How fearfully his heart throbbed as the foot of one threw
several leaves upon his person!</p>

<p>Leland had lain here less than five minutes, when a second footstep
startled him. It came from an entirely different direction; and
approaching to within about a dozen feet, it halted. Rising to
his hands and feet so that his head was brought upon a level with
the ground, he peered through the darkness at the object. One
long, earnest, scrutinizing look, revealed the dress of a large
Indian. His position was so favorable that he could even make
out the rifle he held in his hand.</p>

<p>He stood as motionless as a statue for a moment, and then gave
utterance to a cry that resembled exactly that of the whippoorwill.
Receiving no response, he repeated it again, but with no better
success than before. The cowering fugitive was listening for the
slightest movement upon his part, when to his unfeigned amazement,
the Indian in a suppressed whisper called out, "<em>Leland!</em>"</p>

<p>The young man, however, was not thrown off his guard. He knew
that every one of his captors spoke the English language, some
of them quite fluently. It need scarcely be said that he made
no response to the call, even when it was iterated again and again.
The savage during these utterances did not stir a hand or foot,
but seemed to bend all his faculties into the one of listening.
He had stood but a few moments, when Leland caught the rustle
of approaching feet.</p>

<p>The Indian detected them at the same moment, and instantly moved
off, but with such a catlike tread that the young man scarcely
heard him at all. Ah! had he but known the identity of that strange
Indian, and responded to his call, he would have been saved.</p>

<p>It was scarcely a moment later when the whole four Indians came
back at a leisurely gait, and halted not more than a rod from
where Leland imagined he lay concealed. They commenced conversing
at once in broken English:</p>

<p>"White man got legs of deer&mdash;run fast," said one.</p>

<p>"Yeh!&mdash;git away from four Shummumdewumrum&mdash;run much fast," added
another.</p>

<p>"Go back to camp&mdash;stay dere&mdash;won't come among Shawnee ag'in&mdash;don't
like him, t'ink."</p>

<p>"He run much fast&mdash;mebbe fast as black man."</p>

<p>At this point the whole four laughed immoderately, as if in remembrance
of the ludicrous figure of Zeb. Their mirth continued for several
moments, when they sobered down and renewed their conversation.</p>

<p>"Wait till daylight&mdash;den foller trail t'rough woods &mdash;Shummumdewumrum
git eye on it&mdash;soon cotch him."</p>

<p>This Leland felt was now his great danger. Should his pursuers
return to their camp, he hoped the distance that he thus gained
upon them would be sufficient to carry him entirely beyond their
reach; but if they decided to remain where they were, his only
chance was to steal away before the morning came. Judging such
to be their intention, he determined to make the attempt at once.</p>

<p>On his hands and knees he commenced crawling forward, listening
to every word that was uttered.</p>

<p>"White man try hard to git away&mdash;don't like Shawnee great much."</p>

<p>"He run much fast, <em>den fall down in woods</em>!"</p>

<p>"<em>Den try to crawl away like snake!</em>"</p>

<p>Leland saw that it was all over with him and gave up at once.
The Indians had been aware of his hiding-place from the moment
he fell, and their passage beyond it, their return and their conversation,
were all made on purpose to toy with his fears, as a cat would
play with a mouse before destroying it.</p>

<p>As one of the savages uttered the last words, he walked directly
to the prostrate man, and ordered him to arise. Leland judged
it best to resist no further. He accordingly obeyed; and, saddened
and despairing, was led back a prisoner to the Indian camp.</p>

<p>We have heard of a fish, known in the humble fisherman's parlance
as the <em>ink-fish</em>, which, when pursued by an enemy, has
the power of tinging the water in its immediate vicinity with
such a dark color, that its pursuer is completely befogged and
gives up the hopeless chase in disgust.</p>

<p>A realizing sense of his recklessness and his imminent peril
came over Zeb when he felled the rising Shawnee to the earth.
It was his intention, in the first place, to serve every one in
the same manner; but as they came to their feet far more rapidly
than he anticipated, he gave over the idea, and, with a "Ki! yi!"
plunged headlong into the woods. At this very juncture, the attention
of the Indians was taken up with Leland, as the more important
captive of the two, and for a moment the negro escaped notice;
but the instant the four started after him, two others gave Zeb
their undivided attention.</p>

<p>The sable fugitive, with all his recklessness, did the very best
thing that could have been done under the circumstances. Instead
of fleeing, as did Leland, he ran less than a hundred yards, when
he halted abruptly and took a position behind a sapling. Here
he stood as motionless as death, while his enemies came on. Whether
his intensely black countenance had the power of diffusing deeper
darkness into the surrounding gloom, or whether it was the unexpected
manner of his flight that deluded his pursuers, we are unable
to say. Certain it is that although the two savages passed very
closely to him, neither saw nor suspected his presence.</p>

<p>"Gorra, but dat's soothin'," chuckled Zeb. "Dey've missed me
dis time, shuah! Wonder whether dey'll outlive dar disapp'intment,
when dey finds out dat when dey finds me, dey hain't found me!
Ki! yi!"</p>

<p>He maintained his motionless position for several moments longer,
all the while listening for his enemies. As their footsteps finally
died out in the distance, and he realized that he was left alone
indeed, his former characteristic returned to him.</p>

<p>"What's to be done, dat <em>am</em> de question!" said he, speaking
in an incautiously loud voice, as he spread out his left hand
at the same time, and rested the forefinger of his right upon
it. "In de <em>fust</em> place, I don't know what has become of
Master Leland. If he's done got away, how am I to find him? If
I sets up a yell to cotch his ear, like 'nuff de oders will hear
it also likewise. Den if he hasn't got away what <em>am</em> de
use ob bawlin' to him. Guess I won't bawl."</p>

<p>So much was settled at least. The fact that it would not only
be a useless but an extremely dangerous undertaking to make an
outcry at that particular time, worked itself through his head,
and the intention was accordingly given over for the present.</p>

<p>"One thing <em>am</em> sartin, howsumever," he added. "I'm hungry,
and I know dar am some meat left by dat camp-fire, dat would relish
high jus' now. But had I oughter to go dar or not? Dey mought
found me, but den I'm hungry."</p>

<p>When our own personal feelings are put into the balance, they
are apt to outweigh the dictates of prudence and sense. The experiences
of the night, although fraught in their teachings to the ignorant
black man, had not as yet attained sufficient dignity to stand
before the animal feelings of his nature.</p>

<p>Although he comprehended in a degree the risk he run, he decided
it was worth his while to do it, rather than suffer for a few
hours longer the cravings of what was only a moderate degree of
hunger.</p>

<p>"De stummich am de most importantest part ob man, and consequently
am de fust thing dat should receive his undiwided attention."</p>

<p>With this philosophical conclusion, he turned his footsteps toward
the camp-fire. Despite its proximity, he experienced considerable
difficulty in finding it. The few smoldering embers, gleaming
like a demon's eye, guided him, however, to the spot.</p>

<p>"Dar <em>am</em> anoder matter sartin," thought he, as he came
up. "Mr. Zebenezer Langdon is not agwine to be able to s'arch
here for de meat onless he has some more light &mdash;Ki! dat
coal am warm!" he exclaimed, as he hopped off from the fiery end
of a fagot.</p>

<p>It required but a few moments to gather sufficient fuel to replenish
the fire. The hot coals set the wood almost immediately into a
roaring blaze, which threw a warm, rich light through the surrounding
woods for many yards around.</p>

<p>Zeb was radiant with smiles. The cool night and the constrained
position had chilled him considerably, and he gave the fire a
few moments to infuse the comfortable warmth into his person.</p>

<p>"Now I'll jes' warm up my hands like," said he, after a few minutes,
"and den I'll go to work;" and forthwith he held them toward the
blaze, rubbing and turning them into each other with great zest
and enjoyment.</p>

<p>"<em>Dar</em>, I guess dat'll do. Now I'll make a s'arch &mdash;Gorra!
whar did <em>you</em> come from?"</p>

<p>As the negro turned, he found himself standing face to face with
the two Shawnees who had started in his pursuit but a short time
before! He realized that he was recaptured, and made no resistance.
He was instantly re-bound to the very tree from which he had escaped,
while the Indians sat upon the ground very near him, firmly resolved
that he should not again have so favorable an opportunity to leave
them.</p>

<p>The negro was hardly secured, when the other savages made their
appearance with Leland. He was also fastened to the identical
tree from which he had been loosened; and there, sad, gloomy and
despairing, he was left until morning.</p>
