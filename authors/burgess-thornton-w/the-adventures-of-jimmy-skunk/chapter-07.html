<p>Sammy Jay is a queer fellow. Although he is a scamp and dearly
loves to make trouble for his neighbors, he is always ready to
take their part when others make trouble for them. Many are the
times he has given them warning of danger. This is one reason
they are quite willing to overlook his own shortcomings. So, though
in many ways he is no better than Reddy Fox, he dearly loves to
upset Reddy's plans and is very apt to rejoice when Reddy gets
into trouble. Of course, being right there, he saw all that happened
when Reddy ran against the old barrel at the top of the hill and
sent it rolling. He had been quite as much surprised as Reddy
to find that there was some one inside, and he had followed Reddy
to see who it was. So, of course, he had seen what happened to
Reddy.</p>

<p>Now, instead of being sorry for Reddy, he had openly rejoiced.
It seems to be just that way with a great many people. They like
to see others who are considered very smart get into trouble.
So Sammy had laughed and made fun of poor Reddy. In the first
place it was very exciting, and Sammy dearly loves excitement.
And then it would make such a splendid story to tell, and no one
likes to carry tales more than does Sammy Jay. He watched Reddy
sneak away to the Green Forest, and Jimmy Skunk slowly walk away
in a very dignified manner. Then Sammy flew back to the Old Orchard
to spread the news among the little people there. It wasn't until
he reached the Old Orchard that he remembered Peter Rabbit. Instead
of flying about telling every one what had happened to Jimmy Skunk
and Reddy Fox, he found a comfortable perch in an old apple-tree
and was strangely silent. The fact is, Sammy Jay was doing some
hard thinking. He had suddenly begun to wonder. It had popped
into that shrewd little head of his that it was very strange how
suddenly Peter Rabbit had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Of course," thought Sammy, "Jimmy Skunk is sure that Reddy rolled
that barrel down hill purposely, and I don't wonder that he does
think so. But I saw it all, and I know that it was all an accident
so far as Reddy was concerned. I didn't know that Jimmy was in
that barrel, and Reddy couldn't have known it, because he didn't
come up here until after I did. But Peter Rabbit may have known.
Why did Peter run so that he would have to jump over that barrel
when he could have run right past it?</p>

<p>"Of course, he may have thought that if he could make Reddy run
right slam bang against that barrel it would stop Reddy long enough
to give him a chance to get away. That would have been pretty
smart of Peter and quite like him. But somehow I have a feeling
that he knew all the time that Jimmy Skunk was taking a nap inside
and that something was bound to happen if he was disturbed. The
more I think of it, the more I believe that Peter did know and
that he planned the whole thing. If he did, it was one of the
smartest tricks I ever heard of. I didn't think Peter had it in
him. It was rather hard on Jimmy Skunk, but it got rid of Reddy
Fox for a while. He won't dare show his face around here for a
long time. That means that Peter will have one less worry on his
mind. Hello! Here comes Jimmy Skunk. I'll ask him a few questions."</p>

<p>Jimmy came ambling along in his usual lazy manner. He had quite
recovered his good nature. He felt that he was more than even
with Reddy Fox, and as he was none the worse for his wild ride
in the barrel, he had quite forgotten that he had lost his temper.</p>

<p>"Hello, Jimmy. Have you seen Peter Rabbit this morning?" cried
Sammy Jay.</p>

<p>Jimmy looked up and grinned. "Yes," said he. "I saw him up here
early this morning. Why?"</p>

<p>"Did he see you go into that old barrel?" persisted Sammy.</p>

<p>"I don't know," confessed Jimmy. "He may have. What have you
got on your mind, Sammy Jay?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much, only Reddy Fox was chasing him when he ran against
that barrel and sent you rolling down the hill," replied Sammy.</p>

<p>Jimmy pricked up his ears. "Then Reddy didn't do it purposely!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No," replied Sammy. "He didn't do it purposely. I am quite sure
that he didn't know you were in it. But how about Peter Rabbit?
I am wondering. And I'm doing a little guessing, too."</p>
