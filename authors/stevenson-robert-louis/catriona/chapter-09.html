<p>When I left Prestongrange that afternoon I was for the first
time angry. The Advocate had made a mock of me. He had pretended
my testimony was to be received and myself respected; and in that
very hour, not only was Simon practising against my life by the
hands of the Highland soldier, but (as appeared from his own language)
Prestongrange himself had some design in operation. I counted
my enemies; Prestongrange with all the King’s authority behind
him; and the Duke with the power of the West Highlands; and the
Lovat interest by their side to help them with so great a force
in the north, and the whole clan of old Jacobite spies and traffickers.
And when I remembered James More, and the red head of Neil the
son of Duncan, I thought there was perhaps a fourth in the confederacy,
and what remained of Rob Roy’s old desperate sept of caterans
would be banded against me with the others. One thing was requisite—some
strong friend or wise adviser. The country must be full of such,
both able and eager to support me, or Lovat and the Duke and Prestongrange
had not been nosing for expedients; and it made me rage to think
that I might brush against my champions in the street and be no
wiser.</p>

<p>And just then (like an answer) a gentleman brushed against me
going by, gave me a meaning look, and turned into a close. I knew
him with the tail of my eye—it was Stewart the Writer; and, blessing
my good fortune, turned in to follow him. As soon as I had entered
the close I saw him standing in the mouth of a stair, where he
made me a signal and immediately vanished. Seven storeys up, there
he was again in a house door, the which he looked behind us after
we had entered. The house was quite dismantled, with not a stick
of furniture; indeed, it was one of which Stewart had the letting
in his hands.</p>

<p>"We’ll have to sit upon the floor," said he; "but we’re safe
here for the time being, and I’ve been wearying to see ye, Mr.
Balfour."</p>

<p>"How’s it with Alan?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Brawly," said he. "Andie picks him up at Gillane sands to-morrow,
Wednesday. He was keen to say good-bye to ye, but the way that
things were going, I was feared the pair of ye was maybe best
apart. And that brings me to the essential: how does your business
speed?"</p>

<p>"Why," said I, "I was told only this morning that my testimony
was accepted, and I was to travel to Inverary with the Advocate,
no less."</p>

<p>"Hout awa!" cried Stewart. "I’ll never believe that."</p>

<p>"I have maybe a suspicion of my own," says I, "but I would like
fine to hear your reasons."</p>

<p>"Well, I tell ye fairly, I’m horn-mad," cries Stewart. "If my
one hand could pull their Government down I would pluck it like
a rotten apple. I’m doer for Appin and for James of the Glens;
and, of course, it’s my duty to defend my kinsman for his life.
Hear how it goes with me, and I’ll leave the judgment of it to
yourself. The first thing they have to do is to get rid of Alan.
They cannae bring in James as art and part until they’ve brought
in Alan first as principal; that’s sound law: they could never
put the cart before the horse."</p>

<p>"And how are they to bring in Alan till they can catch him?"
says I.</p>

<p>"Ah, but there is a way to evite that arrestment," said he. "Sound
law, too. It would be a bonny thing if, by the escape of one ill-doer
another was to go scatheless, and the remeid is to summon the
principal and put him to outlawry for the non-compearance. Now
there’s four places where a person can be summoned: at his dwelling-house;
at a place where he has resided forty days; at the head burgh
of the shire where he ordinarily resorts; or lastly (if there
be ground to think him forth of Scotland) <em>at the cross of
Edinburgh</em>, <em>and the pier and shore of Leith</em>, <em>for
sixty days</em>. The purpose of which last provision is evident
upon its face: being that outgoing ships may have time to carry
news of the transaction, and the summonsing be something other
than a form. Now take the case of Alan. He has no dwelling-house
that ever I could hear of; I would be obliged if anyone would
show me where he has lived forty days together since the ’45;
there is no shire where he resorts whether ordinarily or extraordinarily;
if he has a domicile at all, which I misdoubt, it must be with
his regiment in France; and if he is not yet forth of Scotland
(as we happen to know and they happen to guess) it must be evident
to the most dull it’s what he’s aiming for. Where, then, and what
way should he be summoned? I ask it at yourself, a layman."</p>

<p>"You have given the very words," said I. "Here at the cross,
and at the pier and shore of Leith, for sixty days."</p>

<p>"Ye’re a sounder Scots lawyer than Prestongrange, then!" cries
the Writer. "He has had Alan summoned once; that was on the twenty-fifth,
the day that we first met. Once, and done with it. And where?
Where, but at the cross of Inverary, the head burgh of the Campbells?
A word in your ear, Mr. Balfour—they’re not seeking Alan."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I cried. "Not seeking him?"</p>

<p>"By the best that I can make of it," said he. "Not wanting to
find him, in my poor thought. They think perhaps he might set
up a fair defence, upon the back of which James, the man they’re
really after, might climb out. This is not a case, ye see, it’s
a conspiracy."</p>

<p>"Yet I can tell you Prestongrange asked after Alan keenly," said
I; "though, when I come to think of it, he was something of the
easiest put by."</p>

<p>"See that!" says he. "But there! I may be right or wrong, that’s
guesswork at the best, and let me get to my facts again. It comes
to my ears that James and the witnesses—the witnesses, Mr. Balfour!—lay
in close dungeons, and shackled forbye, in the military prison
at Fort William; none allowed in to them, nor they to write. The
witnesses, Mr. Balfour; heard ye ever the match of that? I assure
ye, no old, crooked Stewart of the gang ever out-faced the law
more impudently. It’s clean in the two eyes of the Act of Parliament
of 1700, anent wrongous imprisonment. No sooner did I get the
news than I petitioned the Lord Justice Clerk. I have his word
to-day. There’s law for ye! here’s justice!"</p>

<p>He put a paper in my hand, that same mealy-mouthed, false-faced
paper that was printed since in the pamphlet "by a bystander,"
for behoof (as the title says) of James’s "poor widow and five
children."</p>

<p>"See," said Stewart, "he couldn’t dare to refuse me access to
my client, so he <em>recommends the commanding officer to let
me in</em>. Recommends!—the Lord Justice Clerk of Scotland recommends.
Is not the purpose of such language plain? They hope the officer
may be so dull, or so very much the reverse, as to refuse the
recommendation. I would have to make the journey back again betwixt
here and Fort William. Then would follow a fresh delay till I
got fresh authority, and they had disavowed the officer—military
man, notoriously ignorant of the law, and that—I ken the cant
of it. Then the journey a third time; and there we should be on
the immediate heels of the trial before I had received my first
instruction. Am I not right to call this a conspiracy?"</p>

<p>"It will bear that colour," said I.</p>

<p>"And I’ll go on to prove it you outright," said he. "They have
the right to hold James in prison, yet they cannot deny me to
visit him. They have no right to hold the witnesses; but am I
to get a sight of them, that should be as free as the Lord Justice
Clerk himself! See—read: <em>For the rest</em>, <em>refuses to
give any orders to keepers of prisons who are not accused as having
done anything contrary to the duties of their office</em>. Anything
contrary! Sirs! And the Act of seventeen hunner? Mr. Balfour,
this makes my heart to burst; the heather is on fire inside my
wame."</p>

<p>"And the plain English of that phrase," said I, "is that the
witnesses are still to lie in prison and you are not to see them?"</p>

<p>"And I am not to see them until Inverary, when the court is set!"
cries he, "and then to hear Prestongrange upon <em>the anxious
responsibilities of his office and the great facilities afforded
the defence</em>! But I’ll begowk them there, Mr. David. I have
a plan to waylay the witnesses upon the road, and see if I cannae
get I a little harle of justice out of the <em>military man notoriously
ignorant of the law</em> that shall command the party."</p>

<p>It was actually so—it was actually on the wayside near Tynedrum,
and by the connivance of a soldier officer, that Mr. Stewart first
saw the witnesses upon the case.</p>

<p>"There is nothing that would surprise me in this business," I
remarked.</p>

<p>"I’ll surprise you ere I’m done!" cries he. "Do ye see this?"—producing
a print still wet from the press. "This is the libel: see, there’s
Prestongrange’s name to the list of witnesses, and I find no word
of any Balfour. But here is not the question. Who do ye think
paid for the printing of this paper?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it would likely be King George," said I.</p>

<p>"But it happens it was me!" he cried. "Not but it was printed
by and for themselves, for the Grants and the Erskines, and yon
thief of the black midnight, Simon Fraser. But could <em>I</em>
win to get a copy! No! I was to go blindfold to my defence; I
was to hear the charges for the first time in court alongst the
jury."</p>

<p>"Is not this against the law?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I cannot say so much," he replied. "It was a favour so natural
and so constantly rendered (till this nonesuch business) that
the law has never looked to it. And now admire the hand of Providence!
A stranger is in Fleming’s printing house, spies a proof on the
floor, picks it up, and carries it to me. Of all things, it was
just this libel. Whereupon I had it set again—printed at the expense
of the defence: <em>sumptibus moesti rei</em>; heard ever man
the like of it?—and here it is for anybody, the muckle secret
out—all may see it now. But how do you think I would enjoy this,
that has the life of my kinsman on my conscience?"</p>

<p>"Troth, I think you would enjoy it ill," said I.</p>

<p>"And now you see how it is," he concluded, "and why, when you
tell me your evidence is to be let in, I laugh aloud in your face."</p>

<p>It was now my turn. I laid before him in brief Mr. Simon’s threats
and offers, and the whole incident of the bravo, with the subsequent
scene at Prestongrange’s. Of my first talk, according to promise,
I said nothing, nor indeed was it necessary. All the time I was
talking Stewart nodded his head like a mechanical figure; and
no sooner had my voice ceased, than he opened his mouth and gave
me his opinion in two words, dwelling strong on both of them.</p>

<p>"Disappear yourself," said he.</p>

<p>"I do not take you," said I.</p>

<p>"Then I’ll carry you there," said he. "By my view of it you’re
to disappear whatever. O, that’s outside debate. The Advocate,
who is not without some spunks of a remainder decency, has wrung
your life-safe out of Simon and the Duke. He has refused to put
you on your trial, and refused to have you killed; and there is
the clue to their ill words together, for Simon and the Duke can
keep faith with neither friend nor enemy. Ye’re not to be tried
then, and ye’re not to be murdered; but I’m in bitter error if
ye’re not to be kidnapped and carried away like the Lady Grange.
Bet me what ye please—there was their <em>expedient</em>!"</p>

<p>"You make me think," said I, and told him of the whistle and
the red-headed retainer, Neil.</p>

<p>"Wherever James More is there’s one big rogue, never be deceived
on that," said he. "His father was none so ill a man, though a
kenning on the wrong side of the law, and no friend to my family,
that I should waste my breath to be defending him! But as for
James he’s a brock and a blagyard. I like the appearance of this
red-headed Neil as little as yourself. It looks uncanny: fiegh!
it smells bad. It was old Lovat that managed the Lady Grange affair;
if young Lovat is to handle yours, it’ll be all in the family.
What’s James More in prison for? The same offence: abduction.
His men have had practice in the business. He’ll be to lend them
to be Simon’s instruments; and the next thing we’ll be hearing,
James will have made his peace, or else he’ll have escaped; and
you’ll be in Benbecula or Applecross."</p>

<p>"Ye make a strong case," I admitted.</p>

<p>"And what I want," he resumed, "is that you should disappear
yourself ere they can get their hands upon ye. Lie quiet until
just before the trial, and spring upon them at the last of it
when they’ll be looking for you least. This is always supposing
Mr. Balfour, that your evidence is worth so very great a measure
of both risk and fash."</p>

<p>"I will tell you one thing," said I. "I saw the murderer and
it was not Alan."</p>

<p>"Then, by God, my cousin’s saved!" cried Stewart. "You have his
life upon your tongue; and there’s neither time, risk, nor money
to be spared to bring you to the trial." He emptied his pockets
on the floor. "Here is all that I have by me," he went on, "Take
it, ye’ll want it ere ye’re through. Go straight down this close,
there’s a way out by there to the Lang Dykes, and by my will of
it! see no more of Edinburgh till the clash is over."</p>

<p>"Where am I to go, then?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"And I wish that I could tell ye!" says he, "but all the places
that I could send ye to, would be just the places they would seek.
No, ye must fend for yourself, and God be your guiding! Five days
before the trial, September the sixteen, get word to me at the
<em>King’s Arms</em> in Stirling; and if ye’ve managed for yourself
as long as that, I’ll see that ye reach Inverary."</p>

<p>"One thing more," said I. "Can I no see Alan?"</p>

<p>He seemed boggled. "Hech, I would rather you wouldnae," said
he. "But I can never deny that Alan is extremely keen of it, and
is to lie this night by Silvermills on purpose. If you’re sure
that you’re not followed, Mr. Balfour—but make sure of that—lie
in a good place and watch your road for a clear hour before ye
risk it. It would be a dreadful business if both you and him was
to miscarry!"</p>
