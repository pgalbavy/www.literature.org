<p>Lone Wolf no doubt meant to warn Ned against any attempt at escape;
for, where the surveillance was relaxed, as it would probably
be now and then in his case, he was certain to see many occasions
when he would be tempted to give them the slip.</p>

<p>On the way to this place, Corporal Hugg had given the lad an
insight into the ways of the redmen, and the boy began to use
his knowledge. The perilous position in which he was placed helped
to sharpen his wits, for he began to see things in their true
light. The chief had expressed his hatred of Colonel Chadmund
in too vigorous language to be mistaken; and Ned now believed
that in sparing his life the Indian had been actuated by some
other motive than mercy because of his age.</p>

<p>"He means to strike father through me," he concluded, as he sat
upon the blanket in deep thought. "He will kill me in some way
more horrible than the rest, and he is waiting until he has a
good chance to do it, so that father will be sure and know it.
He thinks he has scared me out of trying to get away, but the
next chance I get I'll do it. I believe I can dodge him. But I'll
have to shut his eye up, so as to have the better show."</p>

<p>At this juncture Lone Wolf came toward him, bearing in his hand
a large bone, rather bountifully covered with meat, which he was
gnawing as he walked, grasping either end of it with his hand,
and fixing his black eyes upon the lad as he advanced.</p>

<p>"Do you want something to eat?"</p>

<p>"I should think I did," replied Ned, with a laugh which he forced
so well that no one would have suspected its sincerity. "I'm about
half starved to death, and was afraid I was not going to get any
supper at all!"</p>

<p>"Take that, and go to sleep."</p>

<p>The large bone was given a flirt by the huge warrior, and fell
directly into his lap. It was not very pleasant to take it second-hand,
but a boy in his situation could not be very fastidious, and,
thanking the chief for his princely liberality, Ned fell to and
gnawed away like a famished dog. It struck him as curious that
none of the warriors appeared to note his presence, but he knew
better than to believe that such apparent blindness was real.
He was as securely within their power as if bound hand and foot.</p>

<p>"He told me to go to sleep," he said, as he stretched out upon
his blanket; "I guess I'll try and do it. I don't see any use
of sitting up and watching such a set of wretches as they are.
I'd rather have a pack of wolves about me than such as they."</p>

<p>The night was too mild to require the blanket wrapped over him;
besides which the warmth from the camp fire was very perceptible;
so he lay upon his back looking up at the stars and endeavoring
to shut out from his thoughts the hateful beings gathered around,
and whose grunting voices and loud exclamations were never quiet,
but continued so long that they acquired a certain monotony, like
the rattle and hum of the mill, which lulls the miller to sleep.</p>

<p>"It's strange," he murmured, as his imaginings became as wayward
as a boy's will. "Father is off yonder, I don't know how many
hundred miles, and mother is just the opposite way in Santa Fe,
and here I am about half way between them. We were never so scattered
in all the world before. I wonder what father will do when he
finds out about Lone Wolf? The chief has put his blanket of greenbacks
away somewhere, and I guess he knows how to take care of them.
I declare, but that was a big haul&mdash;one hundred thousand dollars
at a lick! I should think Lone Wolf might afford to retire now
on what he has made. But the poor men," added Ned, with that sudden
throb of the heart which always came when lie recalled the fearful
attack and massacre in Devil's Pass. "Not one of them left alive!
Oh, I wish I could forget it all! but I never, never can. The
Indians have done such things many a time before, but I never
saw them. It'll kill me if I don't keep it out of my thoughts."</p>

<p>There seemed to be less moon that night than on the previous
evening, and as the boy lay looking upward, he could see a number
of stars twinkling in the sky. He reflected that beyond them was
One who could not forget his pitiful condition, who could bring
him out of all his troubles, and who was the only Being unto whom
he could go in this dark hour. Ned prayed to Him, as he had been
taught to pray at his mother's knee, and, recalling the words
which he had so often heard from her dear lips, he believed that
God could not forsake him, but that all would come out right.
He had lain thus perhaps an hour, when he turned upon his side
for the greater comfort of position. As he did so, he was reminded
of Devil's Pass by a sharp twinge in his side. It was sharp enough
to make him gasp with pain; also to put an idea into his head.</p>

<p>Having fully made up his mind to attempt to get away from the
Apaches at the very first opportunity which he could seize, it
struck him that he might help himself by engaging in a piece of
deception, justifiable under the circumstances. The bruise which
he had received was not severe enough to interfere with his walking,
but Lone Wolf might as well believe that it did. If he thought
his prisoner was too lame to do much in the way of locomotion,
his watchfulness would be certain to become quite lax, all of
which would be a great point in favor of the one mainly concerned.</p>

<p>"At any rate, I'll try it on," he said, as he shut his eyes.</p>

<p>The excessive fatigue of the lad caused him to drop off into
a sound slumber&mdash;a slumber filled with sweet dreams of home, father
and mother and all that was pleasant. But it was interrupted in
the rudest possible way.</p>

<p>The night was nearly gone, when a terrific uproar aroused him
as suddenly as if a cup of cold water had been dashed in his face.
Looking around, he saw two warriors, within six feet of him, engaged
in a savage dispute. From some source, a number of the Apaches
had obtained a supply of fire-water, and several desperate fights
had already taken place. A swarthy redskin, daubed with paint
and intoxicated to that degree which brought to the surface all
the deviltry in his nature, was striving, with knife in hand,
to get at the sleeping boy, while another, in about the same condition,
was disputing his right to do this, and claiming that it was peculiarly
his own province to slay the young prisoner. Both agreed that
death should be awarded, and each claimed that justice demanded
that he alone should do the righteous deed. This difference of
opinion had already produced high words, the warriors pulling
and shoving each other, and threatening each instant to go at
each other with their knives.</p>

<p>Ned could not understand the words spoken, but the actions of
the redskins needed no interpretation. The affrighted boy sprang
to his feet, and, forgetful of the lameness which he had arranged,
ran back several yards to a group of redskins who were squatted
upon the ground, smoking.</p>

<p>At this instant, the two disputants, wearied with hurling words
at each other, went in with their knives, and the conflict became
of the most desperate and sanguinary nature.</p>

<p>"Where is Lone Wolf?" was the question he asked, as he paused
by the group of smokers and looked inquiringly at them.</p>

<p>But if any of them understood the words uttered, they did not
choose to give the information sought, and smoked away as placidly
as if seated around their own firesides at home.</p>

<p>Just beyond were two other warriors engaged in conversation,
and Ned was sure he had heard one of them speak in broken English
during the earlier part of the evening. Hoping to gain the knowledge
he desired, he went to him.</p>

<p>"Where is Lone Wolf, the chief?"</p>

<p>"He go way&mdash;much time ago&mdash;off in the mountains."</p>

<p>"When will he come back?"</p>

<p>The redskin shook his head to signify that he did not know; but
added, the next minute:</p>

<p>"Be back to-morrer&mdash;mebbe&mdash;don't know&mdash;can't say."</p>

<p>This rather indefinite information was all that could be obtained
by the lad, who was in a shiver of terror; for he believed now
that his life was not safe for a single moment.</p>
