<p>Were you ever terribly, terribly frightened? That was the way
Chatterer felt. He was caught; there was no doubt about it! His
sharp teeth were of no use at all on those hard wires. He could
look out between them, but he couldn't get out. He was too frightened
to think. His heart pounded against his sides until it hurt. He
forgot all about that queer food he had so wanted to taste, and
which was right before him now. Indeed, he felt as if he never,
never would want to eat again. What was going to happen to him
now? What would Farmer Brown's boy do to him when he found him
there?</p>

<p>Hark! What was that? It was a step just outside the door of the
corn-crib. Farmer Brown's boy was coming! Chatterer raced around
his little wire prison and bit savagely at the hard wires. But
it was of no use, no use at all. It only hurt his mouth cruelly.
Then the door of the corn-crib swung open, a flood of light poured
in, and with it came Farmer Brown's boy.</p>

<p>"Hello!" exclaimed Farmer Brown's boy, as he caught sight of
Chatterer. "So you are the thief who has been stealing our corn,
and I thought it was a rat or a mouse. Well, well, you little
red rascal, didn't you know that thieves come to no good end?
You're pretty smart, for I never once thought of you, but you
were not so smart as you thought. Now I wonder what we had better
do with you."</p>

<p>He picked up the trap with Chatterer in it and stepped out into
the beautiful great out-of-doors. Chatterer could see across the
dooryard to the Old Orchard and the familiar old stone wall along
which he had scampered so often. They looked just the same as
ever, and yet&mdash;well, they didn't look just the same, for he couldn't
look at them without seeing those cruel wires which were keeping
him from them.</p>

<p>Farmer Brown's boy put the trap down on the ground and then began
to call. "Puss, Puss, Puss," called Farmer Brown's boy. Chatterer's
heart, which had been thumping so, almost stopped beating with
fright. There was Black Pussy, whom he had so often teased and
made fun of. Her yellow eyes had a hungry gleam as she walked
around the trap and sniffed and sniffed. Never had Chatterer heard
such a terrible sound as those hungry sniffs so close to him!
Black Pussy tried to put a paw between the wires, and Chatterer
saw the great, cruel claws. But Black Pussy couldn't get her paw
between the wires.</p>

<p>"How would you like him for breakfast?" asked Farmer Brown's
boy.</p>

<p>"Meow," said Black Pussy, arching her back and rubbing against
his legs.</p>

<p>"I suppose that means that you would like him very much," laughed
Farmer Brown's boy. "Do you think you can catch him if I let him
out?"</p>

<p>"Meow," replied Black Pussy again, and to poor Chatterer it seemed
the awfullest sound he ever had heard.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see about it by and by," said Farmer Brown's boy.
"There's the breakfast bell, and I haven't fed the biddies yet."</p>
