<p>Genesis and his dog were waiting just outside the kitchen door,
and of all the world these two creatures were probably the last
in whose company William Sylvanus Baxter desired to make a public
appearance. Genesis was an out-of-doors man and seldom made much
of a toilet; his overalls in particular betraying at important
points a lack of the anxiety he should have felt, since only Genesis
himself, instead of a supplementary fabric, was directly underneath
them. And the aged, grayish, sleeveless and neckless garment which
sheltered him from waist to collar-bone could not have been mistaken
for a jersey, even though what there was of it was dimly of a
jerseyesque character. Upon the feet of Genesis were things which
careful study would have revealed to be patent-leather dancing-pumps,
long dead and several times buried; and upon his head, pressing
down his markedly criminal ears, was a once-derby hat of a brown
not far from Genesis's own color, though decidedly without his
gloss. A large ring of strange metals with the stone missing,
adorned a finger of his right hand, and from a corner of his mouth
projected an unlighted and spreading cigar stub which had the
appearance of belonging to its present owner merely by right of
salvage.</p>

<p>And Genesis's dog, scratching himself at his master's feet, was
the true complement of Genesis, for although he was a youngish
dog, and had not long been the property of Genesis, he was a dog
that would have been recognized anywhere in the world as a colored
person's dog. He was not a special breed of dog&mdash;though there
was something rather houndlike about him&mdash;he was just a dog. His
expression was grateful but anxious, and he was unusually bald
upon the bosom, but otherwise whitish and brownish, with a gaunt,
haunting face and no power to look anybody in the eye.</p>

<p>He rose apprehensively as the fuming William came out of the
kitchen, but he was prepared to follow his master faithfully,
and when William and Genesis reached the street the dog was discovered
at their heels, whereupon William came to a decisive halt.</p>

<p>"Send that dog back," he said, resolutely. "I'm not going through
the streets with a dog like that, anyhow!"</p>

<p>Genesis chuckled. "He ain' goin' back," he said. "'Ain' nobody
kin make 'at dog go back. I 'ain' had him mo'n two weeks, but
I don' b'lieve Pres'dent United States kin make 'at dog go back!
I show you." And, wheeling suddenly, he made ferocious gestures,
shouting. "G'on back, dog!"</p>

<p>The dog turned, ran back a few paces, halted, and then began
to follow again, whereupon Genesis pretended to hurl stones at
him; but the animal only repeated his manoeuver&mdash;and he repeated
it once more when William aided Genesis by using actual missiles,
which were dodged with almost careless adeptness.</p>

<p>"I'll show him!" said William, hotly. "I'll show him he can't
follow ME!" He charged upon the dog, shouting fiercely, and this
seemed to do the work, for the hunted animal, abandoning his partial
flights, turned a tucked-under tail, ran all the way back to the
alley, and disappeared from sight. "There!" said William. "I guess
that 'll show him!"</p>

<p>"I ain' bettin' on it!" said Genesis, as they went on. "He nev'
did stop foll'in' me yet. I reckon he the foll'indest dog in the
worl'! Name Clem."</p>

<p>"Well, he can't follow ME!" said the surging William, in whose
mind's eye lingered the vision of an exquisite doglet, with pink-ribboned
throat and a cottony head bobbing gently over a filmy sleeve.
"He doesn't come within a mile of ME, no matter what his name
is!"</p>

<p>"Name Clem fer short," said Genesis, amiably. "I trade in a mandoline
fer him what had her neck kind o' busted off on one side. I couldn'
play her nohow, an' I found her, anyways. Yes-suh, I trade in
'at mandoline fer him 'cause always did like to have me a good
dog&mdash;but I d'in' have me no name fer him; an' this here Blooie
Bowers, what I trade in the mandoline to, he say HE d'in have
no name fer him. Say nev' did know if <em>WAS </em>a name fer
him 'tall. So I'z spen' the evenin' at 'at lady's house, Fanny,
what used to be cook fer Miz Johnson, nex' do' you' maw's; an'
I ast Fanny what am I go'n' a do about it, an' Fanny say, 'Call
him Clematis,' she say. ''At's a nice name!' she say. 'Clematis.'
So 'at's name I name him, Clematis. Call him Clem fer short, but
Clematis his real name. He'll come, whichever one you call him,
Clem or Clematis. Make no diff'ence to him, long's he git his
vittles. Clem or Clematis, HE ain' carin'!"</p>

<p>William's ear was deaf to this account of the naming of Clematis;
he walked haughtily, but as rapidly as possible, trying to keep
a little in advance of his talkative companion, who had never
received the training as a servitor which should have taught him
his proper distance from the Young Master. William's suffering
eyes were fixed upon remoteness; and his lips moved, now and then,
like a martyr's, pronouncing inaudibly a sacred word. "Milady!
Oh, Milady!"</p>

<p>Thus they had covered some three blocks of their journey&mdash;the
too-democratic Genesis chatting companionably and William burning
with mortification&mdash;when the former broke into loud laughter.</p>

<p>"What I tell you?" he cried, pointing ahead. "Look ayonnuh! NO,
suh, Pres'dent United States hisse'f ain' go tell 'at dog stay
home!"</p>

<p>And there, at the corner before them, waited Clematis, roguishly
lying in a mud-puddle in the gutter. He had run through alleys
parallel to their course&mdash;and in the face of such demoniac cunning
the wretched William despaired of evading his society. Indeed,
there was nothing to do but to give up, and so the trio proceeded,
with William unable to decide which contaminated him more, Genesis
or the loyal Clematis. To his way of thinking, he was part of
a dreadful pageant, and he winced pitiably whenever the eye of
a respectable passer-by fell upon him. Everybody seemed to stare&mdash;nay,
to leer! And he felt that the whole world would know his shame
by nightfall.</p>

<p>Nobody, he reflected, seeing him in such company, could believe
that he belonged to "one of the oldest and best families in town."
Nobody would understand that he was not walking with Genesis for
the pleasure of his companionship&mdash;until they got the tubs and
the wash-boiler, when his social condition must be thought even
more degraded. And nobody, he was shudderingly positive, could
see that Clematis was not his dog (Clematis kept himself humbly
a little in the rear, but how was any observer to know that he
belonged to Genesis and not to William?)</p>

<p>And how frightful that <em>THIS </em>should befall him on such
a day, the very day that his soul had been split asunder by the
turquoise shafts of Milady's eyes and he had learned to know the
Real Thing at last!</p>

<p>"Milady! Oh, Milady!"</p>

<p>For in the elder teens adolescence may be completed, but not
by experience, and these years know their own tragedies. It is
the time of life when one finds it unendurable not to seem perfect
in all outward matters: in worldly position, in the equipments
of wealth, in family, and in the grace, elegance, and dignity
of all appearances in public. And yet the youth is continually
betrayed by the child still intermittently insistent within him,
and by the child which undiplomatic people too often assume him
to be. Thus with William's attire: he could ill have borne any
suggestion that it was not of the mode, but taking care of it
was a different matter. Also, when it came to his appetite, he
could and would eat anything at any time, but something younger
than his years led him&mdash;often in semi-secrecy&mdash;to candy-stores
and soda-water fountains and ice-cream parlors; he still relished
green apples and knew cravings for other dangerous inedibles.
But these survivals were far from painful to him; what injured
his sensibilities was the disposition on the part of people especially
his parents, and frequently his aunts and uncles&mdash;to regard him
as a little boy. Briefly, the deference his soul demanded in its
own right, not from strangers only, but from his family, was about
that which is supposed to be shown a Grand Duke visiting his Estates.
Therefore William suffered often.</p>

<p>But the full ignominy of the task his own mother had set him
this afternoon was not realized until he and Genesis set forth
upon the return journey from the second-hand shop, bearing the
two wash-tubs, a clothes-wringer (which Mrs. Baxter had forgotten
to mention), and the tin boiler&mdash;and followed by the lowly Clematis.</p>
