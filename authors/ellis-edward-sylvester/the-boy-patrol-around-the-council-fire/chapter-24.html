<p>The meeting was a joyous one. Alvin and Chester sprang to their
feet and grasped in turn the hand of their astonished friend,
while Zip, never forgetting his dignity, looked on as if he understood
it all, as quite likely he did.</p>

<p>"I didn’t leave Uncle Wilson’s until after dinner yesterday,"
said Burton, "and as Zip and I were in no hurry, it was growing
dark when we got here. Somehow or other, I fancied the looks of
this old-fashioned inn and decided to stay over night, but what
is it brings you here?" asked the young man as all three sat down
to the table.</p>

<p>And then Alvin told his astounding story, to which Burton listened
with breathless interest.</p>

<p>"How dreadful!" he exclaimed; "it distresses me more than I can
tell. It was fortunate indeed that I decided to stop here, for
I may not return to Mouse Island for several days. I reckon we
shall do some tall traveling to Gosling Lake."</p>

<p>They did not linger over their breakfast. Burton tossed a few
mouthfuls of meat to the dog, which sat on the floor beside his
chair. As a rule, when off on one of his tramps, the hound shared
his room, though he did not do so at the bungalow, which explained
why Alvin and Chester saw nothing of the animal when they arrived
several hours before.</p>

<p>"It isn’t any use to theorize," remarked Burton, as the three
paid their bill and hurried out of the inn, "for at such times
you are more likely to be wrong than right. Ruth may have fallen
into the lake and been drowned, without her body being found for
several days; it may be that those tramps belong to an organized
gang and have stolen and hidden her, but in that case," added
the young man with a flash of his eyes, "they forgot to reckon
with Zip; and if so, they will soon learn their mistake."</p>

<p>"The general belief when we left last night," said Chester, "was
that she had simply wandered off in the woods until tired out,
when she lay down and fell asleep."</p>

<p>"That sounds reasonable, but I can’t shake off the fear that
it is not the right explanation."</p>

<p>It need not be said that while the three boys were hurrying over
the highway and along the rough path with the eager Zip, who knew
that something was in the air, keeping them company, the Boy Scouts
and Doctor Spellman and his wife were busy.</p>

<p>Their aimless groping through the wood was kept up until far
beyond midnight, when the physician compelled his wife to return
with him to the house and lie down for a brief rest. Scout Master
Hall suggested to the members of the troop to return to the bungalow,
he accompanying them, where they too secured sleep, and ate their
morning meal at daylight. The agreement was that all should assemble
at an early hour at the doctor’s home, where a decision would
be made as to what was next to be done.</p>

<p>If the child, as all prayed was the case, had simply gone astray
in the woods, she would awake at an early hour and renew her effort
to find her way home. With so many persons wandering here, there
and everywhere she must hear their calls and her rescue could
not be long delayed. If such proved not to be the case, and she
had not been drowned, it would mean the worst. She was the victim
of the most atrocious miscreants who lived,—for no crime is more
merciless and unforgivable than the kidnapping of the pet of a
household, and giving its parents the choice of paying an enormous
ransom or never seeing it again.</p>

<p>Now, it may have struck you as strange that no reference has
been made to Uncle Elk in the consternation which followed the
discovery that Ruth Spellman had been lost or stolen. In knowledge
of woodcraft none of the searchers could be compared to him, and
yet no one had asked his help. The reason was simple. With all
his skill in the ways of the forest, he could do no more, so long
as the night lasted, than the youngest member of the Boy Scouts.
He could join in the aimless groping and shouting, but with a
score already doing their utmost, he would simply be one among
them.</p>

<p>Although morning brought a change of conditions, it would seem
that they were still unsurmountable, for what Apache, or Sioux
or Shawnee (unless he were Deerfoot) could trail a little child
through the forest, when her almost imperceptible footprints had
been repeatedly crossed by other feet?</p>

<p>"I think we ought to appeal to Uncle Elk," said Scout Master
Hall to the parents, after the scouts assembled at the Doctor’s
home had scattered to press their hunt harder than ever. "None
of us can equal him."</p>

<p>"You know that for some cause which I cannot fathom, he has formed
an intense dislike for my wife and me," said the perplexed father.</p>

<p>"But it is impossible that it should include the little one.
At such a time as this no heart has room for enmity, no matter
what fancy may have dictated."</p>

<p>"I am willing to be guided by your judgement," replied the doctor,
after his wife had joined in the plea. "If Ruth has slept alone
in the woods, she must have awakened an hour or two ago and ought
to have been found. I don’t see how the old hermit can help us,
but we must neglect nothing. Come on."</p>

<p>But Mike Murphy had anticipated their action. We know what unbounded
faith he held in Uncle Elk, and more than once he had felt inclined
to go to his cabin. With the coming of morning he decided to do
so.</p>

<p>Consulting with Patrol Leader Chase, Mike found that he had formed
the same decision. Accordingly the two withdrew from the others
without attracting notice and made their way together to the cabin
of their old friend. This was so far removed from the zone of
active search that none of the other Scouts was met.</p>

<p>"If he can’t help us, no one can," said Chase.</p>

<p>"There’s only one cratur that can thrack Sunbeam through the
woods, and his name is Zip," replied Mike. "If I hadn’t seen with
me own eyes what he can do, I wouldn’t belave the same. Wal, here
we are!"</p>

<p>They had reached the little clearing in the middle of which stood
the familiar cabin, as silent and devoid of all signs of life
as ever. Without hesitation, Mike led the way up the path, placed
his foot on the small steps, and was about to reach up to draw
the latch, when he recoiled with a gasp.</p>

<p>"Do ye obsarve that?" he asked in a startled whisper.</p>

<p><em>The latchstring was inside!</em></p>

<p>Never since the leathern thong was first shoved through the little
orifice above the tongue of iron had this occurred, by day or
night.</p>

<p>The two boys stood for several minutes staring at the blank door,
and then looked in each other’s face. Not the slightest sound
was heard from within.</p>

<p>"What does it mean, Mike?" asked the Patrol Leader in a still
lower whisper.</p>

<p>"It maans ‘no admittince’; this is no place for us. I can’t guess
what raison Uncle Elk has for shutting ivery one out, but he’s
done it, and we must respect it."</p>

<p>They turned away, hurrying in the direction of Doctor Spellman’s
house, and had almost reached it when they met the physician,
his wife and Scout Master Hall, to whom the two boys told the
astounding news. In other circumstances they would have theorized
as to the cause of Uncle Elk’s unaccountable action, but there
was only one theme that filled every mind.</p>

<p>"It shuts us off from any aid by <em>him</em>," remarked the
doctor; "we can only keep up the search and wait for the coming
of my nephew and his dog,—but," he added bitterly, "that may not
be for days, when even he can do nothing."</p>

<p>A ringing shout caused all to turn their heads and look along
the beach toward the northern side of the lake. Three boys were
coming toward them on a run, and a few paces ahead of them, as
if he were their leader, galloped a black dog.</p>

<p>"God be thanked!" exclaimed the mother clasping her hands. "It’s
George and Zip!"</p>

<p>"Not forgitting Alvin and Chest, the two best boys that iver
lived, barring only mesilf."</p>

<p>The next minute the parties were mingling, and greeting one another.
Alvin, Chester and young Burton were panting, for they had not
let the grass grow under their feet on the way from Bovil to Gosling
Lake, but they were still good for much more of the same kind
of work.</p>

<p>"Zip is ready," said his master, "and we are near the house.
Let’s make a start, for we are soon to learn the truth."</p>

<p>The news of the arrival of Zip quickly spread by means of shouts
and calls to the scattered Boy Scouts, who began flocking to the
quarters of Doctor Spellman, until very nearly the whole troop
were gathered there. In answer to the request of Burton for some
article of wearing apparel recently worn by Ruth, the mother with
a calmness that impressed every one, brought forward a pair of
chubby shoes, which the little one in an effort to "break them
in" had kept on her feet until late in the afternoon, when they
irked her so much she changed them for an old pair. Burton held
them out to Zip, who sniffed several times and then turned his
head away to signify that he had learned enough.</p>

<p>"Now, get to work!" commanded his master.</p>

<p>The scent was perhaps fourteen hours old when the Boy Scouts
assembled in front of the wooden structure, saw Zip begin trotting
to and fro with his nose to the ground. Suddenly he bayed slightly,
and started down the slope in the direction of the lake.</p>

<p>"He’s hit the trail!" said the excited Burton, dashing after
him; "not too fast, Zip."</p>

<p>The youth never used a leash. The hound wore a handsome collar
with his name and the address of his master engraved on it. His
voice was sufficient to restrain Zip if he traveled too rapidly.</p>

<p>But the dog at his slowest traveled so fast that the boys had
to trot to keep pace with him. His master by common consent took
the lead, with Alvin, Chester, Mike and the others at his heels.
Zip would have drawn away from them all had not his master sharply
restrained him. The doctor was well to the rear, in order to keep
company with his wife.</p>

<p>The hound went straight toward the water, but a few paces away
turned to the left, taking a course which if continued would lead
him to the bungalow. This was kept up for more than a hundred
yards, when he abruptly stopped and throwing up his head looked
off over the lake, without emitting any sound.</p>

<p>The mother with a moan staggered and would have fallen had she
not been caught in the arms of her husband.</p>

<p>"That means she is drowned!" faintly whispered the stricken wife.
"O Wilson! I cannot bear it!"</p>

<p>"No, my dear; he has gone forward again; be brave; hope is still
left."</p>

<p>Zip now led the company along the beach, at the same steady trot,
with his master almost near enough to grasp his collar, and checking
him now and then when he went too fast. There could be no doubt
that he was following the scent, from which nothing could divert
him.</p>

<p>But whither was it leading?</p>

<p>The run was a long one, always within a few paces of the water,
until a point was reached opposite the path which led to the cabin
of Uncle Elk. Here, to the astonishment of every one, the dog
turned off and went up the slope.</p>

<p>"What can that mean?" was the question which each one asked himself.</p>

<p>And with more amazement than before, the procession of pursuers
saw Zip follow the path across the clearing to the door of the
cabin, where he stopped, threw up his nose and bayed. It was notice
that he had reached the end of the trail.</p>

<p>Ruth Spellman was inside the log structure.</p>

<p>In a twinkling the whole company was grouped around the front
of the building.</p>

<p>"Why don’t you go in?" demanded the Doctor, pressing impatiently
forward.</p>

<p>"You forget the latchstring is inside," reminded Scout Master
Hall.</p>

<p>"What difference does that make? Is this a time to hesitate?
Let’s break in the door! Make room for me and I’ll do it!"</p>

<p>Mike Murphy, Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes ran to the little
window a few paces beyond the door and peered through the panes.</p>

<p>"Sunbeam is there!" shouted Mike, "and nothing is the matter
with her!"</p>

<p>Before he could explain further, there was a crash. The impact
of Doctor Spellman’s powerful shoulder carried the staple which
held the latch from its fastenings and the door swung inward.
Through it swarmed the Boy Scouts, the physician and his wife
in the lead.</p>

<p>In front of the broad fireplace, where the embers had long died,
sat Uncle Elk in his rocking chair, silent, motionless and with
head bowed. Seated on his knees, with her curls half hiding her
pretty face and resting against his massive chest, was Ruth Spellman,
sleeping as sweetly as if on her cot at home.</p>

<p>With a glad cry, the mother rushed forward and flung her arms
about the child, sobbing with joy.</p>

<p>"O my darling! Thank heaven you are found!" and she smothered
the bewildered one with kisses and caresses.</p>

<p>Suddenly Doctor Spellman raised his hand and an instant hush
fell upon all. He had lifted the limp arm of the man and placed
his finger on the wrist. The professional eye saw that which escaped
the others. He said in a solemn voice:</p>

<p>"Uncle Elk is dead!" </p>
