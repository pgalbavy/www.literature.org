<p>The fire was sunk to cold ashes in the grate, and the grey morning
was creeping through the half-opened curtains like a thing ashamed,
when Lois awoke.  It was painful to move her head: her neck was
cramped.  The girl awoke in full recollection.  She sighed, roused
herself and pulled the quilt closer about her.  For a little while
she sat and mused.  A pale, tragic resignation fixed her face like
a mask.  She remembered her father's irritable answer to her
question concerning her lover's safety - &quot;Safe, aye - why not?&quot;  She
knew that he suspected the factory of having been purposely set on
fire.  But then, he had never liked Will.  And yet - and yet - Lois'
heart was heavy as lead.  She felt her lover was guilty.  And she
felt she must hide her secret of his last communication to her.
She saw herself being cross-examined - &quot;When did you last see this
man?&quot;  But she would hide what he had said about watching at the
works.  How dreary it was - and how dreadful.  Her life was ruined
now, and nothing mattered any more.  She must only behave with
dignity, and submit to her own obliteration.  For even if Will were
never accused, she knew in her heart he was guilty.  She knew it
was over between them.</p>

<p>It was dawn among the yellow fog outside, and Lois, as she moved
mechanically about her toilet, vaguely felt that all her days would
arrive slowly struggling through a bleak fog.  She felt an intense
longing at this uncanny hour to slough the body's trammelled
weariness and to issue at once into the new bright warmth of the
far Dawn where a lover waited transfigured; it is so easy and
pleasant in imagination to step out of the chill grey dampness of
another terrestrial daybreak, straight into the sunshine of the
eternal morning!  And who can escape his hour?  So Lois performed
the meaningless routine of her toilet, which at last she made
meaningful when she took her black dress, and fastened a black jet
brooch at her throat.</p>

<p>Then she went downstairs and found her father eating a mutton chop.
She quickly approached and kissed him on the forehead.  Then she
retreated to the other end of the table.  Her father looked tired,
even haggard.</p>

<p>&quot;You are early,&quot; he said, after a while.  Lois did not reply.  Her
father continued to eat for a few moments, then he said:</p>

<p>&quot;Have a chop - here's one!  Ring for a hot plate.  Eh, what?  Why
not?&quot;</p>

<p>Lois was insulted, but she gave no sign.  She sat down and took a
cup of coffee, making no pretence to eat.  Her father was absorbed,
and had forgotten her.</p>

<p>&quot;Our Jack's not come home yet,&quot; he said at last.</p>

<p>Lois stirred faintly.  &quot;Hasn't he?&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;  There was silence for a time.  Lois was frightened.  Had
something happened also to her brother?  This fear was closer and
more irksome.</p>

<p>&quot;Selby's was cleaned out, gutted.  We had a near shave of it - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have no loss, Dadda?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing to mention.&quot;  After another silence, her father said:</p>

<p>&quot;I'd rather be myself than William Selby.  Of course it may merely
be bad luck - you don't know.  But whatever it was, I wouldn't like
to add one to the list of fires just now.  Selby was at the
'George' when it broke out - I don't know where the lad was - !&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Father,&quot; broke in Lois, &quot;why do you talk like that?  Why do you
talk as if Will had done it?&quot;  She ended suddenly.  Her father
looked at her pale, mute face.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't talk as if Will had done it,&quot; he said.  &quot;I don't even
think it.&quot;</p>

<p>Feeling she was going to cry, Lois rose and left the room.  Her
father sighed, and leaning his elbows on his knees, whistled
faintly into the fire.  He was not thinking about her.</p>

<p>Lois went down to the kitchen and asked Lucy, the parlour-maid, to
go out with her.  She somehow shrank from going alone, lest people
should stare at her overmuch: and she felt an overpowering impulse
to go to the scene of the tragedy, to judge for herself.</p>

<p>The churches were chiming half-past eight when the young lady and
the maid set off down the street.  Nearer the fair, swarthy, thin-
legged men were pushing barrels of water towards the market-place,
and the gipsy women, with hard brows, and dressed in tight velvet
bodices, hurried along the pavement with jugs of milk, and great
brass water ewers and loaves and breakfast parcels.  People were
just getting up, and in the poorer streets was a continual splash
of tea-leaves, flung out on to the cobble-stones.  A teapot came
crashing down from an upper story just behind Lois, and she,
starting round and looking up, thought that the trembling, drink-
bleared man at the upper window, who was stupidly staring after his
pot, had had designs on her life; and she went on her way
shuddering at the grim tragedy of life.</p>

<p>In the dull October morning the ruined factory was black and
ghastly.  The window-frames were all jagged, and the walls stood
gaunt.  Inside was a tangle of twisted d&eacute;bris, the iron, in parts
red with bright rust, looking still hot; the charred wood was black
and satiny; from dishevelled heaps, sodden with water, a faint
smoke rose dimly.  Lois stood and looked.  If he had done that!  He
might even be dead there, burned to ash and lost for ever.  It was
almost soothing to feel so.  He would be safe in the eternity which
now she must hope in.</p>

<p>At her side the pretty, sympathetic maid chatted plaintively.
Suddenly, from one of her lapses into silence, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&quot;Why if there isn't Mr Jack!&quot;</p>

<p>Lois turned suddenly and saw her brother and her lover approaching
her.  Both looked soiled, untidy and wan.  Will had a black eye,
some ten hours old, well coloured.  Lois turned very pale as they
approached.  They were looking gloomily at the factory, and for a
moment did not notice the girls.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll be jiggered if there ain't our Lois!&quot; exclaimed Jack, the
reprobate, swearing under his breath.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, God!&quot; exclaimed the other in disgust.</p>

<p>&quot;Jack, where have you been?&quot; said Lois sharply, in keen pain, not
looking at her lover.  Her sharp tone of suffering drove her lover
to defend himself with an affectation of comic recklessness.</p>

<p>&quot;In quod,&quot; replied her brother, smiling sickly.</p>

<p>&quot;Jack!&quot; cried his sister very sharply.</p>

<p>&quot;Fact.&quot;</p>

<p>Will Selby shuffled on his feet and smiled, trying to turn away his
face so that she should not see his black eye.  She glanced at him.
He felt her boundless anger and contempt, and with great courage he
looked straight at her, smiling ironically.  Unfortunately his
smile would not go over his swollen eye, which remained grave and
lurid.</p>

<p>&quot;Do I look pretty?&quot; he inquired with a hateful twist of his lip.</p>

<p>&quot;Very!&quot; she replied.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought I did,&quot; he replied.  And he turned to look at his
father's ruined works, and he felt miserable and stubborn.  The
girl standing there so clean and out of it all!  Oh, God, he felt
sick.  He turned to go home.</p>

<p>The three went together, Lois silent in anger and resentment.  Her
brother was tired and overstrung, but not suppressed.  He chattered
on blindly.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a lark we had!  We met Bob Osborne and Freddy Mansell
coming down Poultry.  There was girl with some geese.  She looked a
tanger sitting there, all like statues, her and the geese.  It was
Will who began it.  He offered her three-pence and asked her to
begin the show.  She called him a - she called him something, and
then somebody poked an old gander to stir him up, and somebody
squirted him in the eye.  He upped and squawked and started off
with his neck out.  Laugh!  We nearly killed ourselves, keeping
back those old birds with squirts and teasers.  Oh, Lum!  Those old
geese, oh, scrimmy, they didn't know where to turn, they fairly
went off their dots, coming at us right an' left, and such a row - 
it was fun, you never knew!  Then the girl she got up and knocked
somebody over the jaw, and we were right in for it.  Well, in the
end, Billy here got hold of her round the waist - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dry it up!&quot; exclaimed Will bitterly.</p>

<p>Jack looked at him, laughed mirthlessly, and continued:  &quot;An' we
said we'd buy her birds.  So we got hold of one goose apiece - an'
they took some holding, I can tell you - and off we set round the
fair, Billy leading with the girl.  The bloomin' geese squawked an'
pecked.  Laugh - I thought I should a' died.  Well, then we wanted
the girl to have her birds back - and then she fired up.  She got
some other chaps on her side, and there was a proper old row.  The
girl went tooth and nail for Will there - she was dead set against
him.  She gave him a black eye, by gum, and we went at it, I can
tell you.  It was a free fight, a beauty, an' we got run in.  I
don't know what became of the girl.&quot;</p>

<p>Lois surveyed the two men.  There was no glimmer of a smile on her
face, though the maid behind her was sniggering.  Will was very
bitter.  He glanced at his sweetheart and at the ruined factory.</p>

<p>&quot;How's dad taken it?&quot; he asked, in a biting, almost humble tone.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; she replied coldly.  &quot;Father's in an awful way.  I
believe everybody thinks you set the place on fire.&quot;</p>

<p>Lois drew herself up.  She had delivered her blow.  She drew
herself up in cold condemnation and for a moment enjoyed her
complete revenge.  He was despicable, abject in his dishevelled,
disfigured, unwashed condition.</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, well, they made a mistake for once,&quot; he replied, with a curl
of the lip.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, they walked side by side as if they belonged to
each other.  She was his conscience-keeper.  She was far from
forgiving him, but she was still farther from letting him go.  And
he walked at her side like a boy who had to be punished before he
can be exonerated.  He submitted.  But there was a genuine bitter
contempt in the curl of his lip.</p>
