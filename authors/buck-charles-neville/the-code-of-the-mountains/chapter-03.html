<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The late convict had wasted his strength. His violent paroxysm of anger
had exhausted him more than his laborious tramp. It had sent his
temperature up and brought a sickening weakness to his muscles. He
wavered as he plodded and once or twice even stumbled to his knees,
until at last, with only three-quarters of a mile left, he turned aside
to the bank of the roadside and sat down with the sweat of weakness
dripping from his face.
</p>
<p>It was such a day as must have set poets to making jeweled phrases out
of words. The air and skies held that radiance which can make of a
Kentucky June morning a miracle of beauty. The horizons were dreamily
soft and warm. In the field at Newt Spooner's back a meadow-lark was
madly trying to burst his pulsating throat with the flood of golden joy.
In Newt Spooner's mind was a somber picture; a picture of the mountains
which a few days more would throw across the eastern sky-line, and of a
man who lived there and who was to die. He was to die without
opportunity to defend himself and without benefit of clergy. It was not
to be a fight, but an execution. In the entire mental range of the young
man panting by the roadside was no reflex of any other thing than brute
bitterness and "pizen meanness."
</p><p>A buggy and horse rose into view over the crest of the hill. It had only
one occupant and the occupant was a girl. She was unlike any woman Newt
Spooner had ever known; unlike any of the "gals" back in the mountains.
Her lithe figure had all the fresh charm of the sparkling morning and
all the spirited quality of the thorough-bred. And just as to Newt
Spooner the world held only gall, so to her it held only fragrance and
music and starshine--and an abiding faith in men and women.
</p><p>She was happy because she had not yet discovered any unhappiness and
because she was young ... and because to-day she would see in Winchester
a certain member of the opposite sex in whom her interest was direct and
personal. Meantime, June was softly glowing around the whole circle of
the sky's embrace and the trees were rustling their fresh greenery and
the birds were singing.
</p><p>She was singing, too, but suddenly she stopped as her eyes fell on the
young man by the roadside. Her quick gaze discerned that he was
desperately thin and that the color in his face burned only in hectic
spots against a chalky pallor. She saw, too, that as he wiped his
forehead on his sleeve his forearm and hand trembled. His clothes
proclaimed him lately released from the penitentiary, but her ideas on
the subject of prisons were vaguely confined to a compassionate regret
that they existed. Quite probably had she found him there looking weak
and sick even had he worn stripes, she would still have offered him
help. She drew the horse to a standstill, and called out cheerfully in a
voice as tuneful as the lark over yonder in the field:
</p><p>"Good-morning. Can't I give you a lift?"
</p><p>Newt Spooner gazed back at her sullenly and defiantly. The dog that has
only been kicked distrusts the hand thrust out in kindness. It is
unknown to his experience.
</p><p>"Naw," he declined, with as surly an utterance as possible.
</p><p>The girl flushed and her lips tightened. She flung back her head with a
gesture that set truant curls tantalizingly astir and flapped the reins
on the horse's back, but in quick afterthought she drew him down again.
This boy's rudeness did not alter the fact that he was sick. He looked
like a mountaineer and could hardly be expected to measure up to the
bluegrass requirements of courtesy.
</p><p>"You're about as polite as--as a mud-turtle," she calmly informed the
traveler, holding his eyes with an unflinching gaze, before which they
shamefacedly drooped; "but that doesn't make any difference. I'm going
into Winchester, and you don't look very well. Hadn't you better get in
and ride to town?"
</p><p>The boy from Troublesome stared his incredulity. She seemed to him a
marvelous sort of being. Her simple dress was to his eyes extravagantly
elegant and her patrician delicacy of feature belonged to an order
which neither the drudgery of the hills nor that of the state prison had
given him opportunity to study.
</p><p>"I reckon," he said slowly and diffidently, but no longer with a note of
bitterness, "hit hain't wuth while to pester ye."
</p><p>"That's all right," she commanded. "Climb in." Slowly he rose and
obeyed, the whiskey-flask protruding from his coat-pocket, and when they
had gone a quarter of a mile, Newt made his sole voluntary contribution
to the conversation.
</p><p>"I'm obleeged ter ye," he said.
</p><p>She did not question him unduly, nor ply him with conversation, but she
smiled, and in some subtle fashion there broke through the storm-wrack
of the boy's bitterness a thin ray of light and glow of graciousness.
She let him out at the court-house square, where buggies stood in rows
and traders jostled and the auctioneer's shout resounded, and there he
lost himself in the crowd; but first he stood looking after her until
her buggy turned a corner, and then he remembered that she had nodded
with a friendly smile of farewell. It was rather wonderful to be treated
like a human being.
</p><p>Newt Spooner wanted food and he wanted it to be cheap, so he foraged up
and down Main Street until he came upon that lower section where several
shabby eating-houses were sandwiched between equally shabby saloons.
</p><p>And while he stood on the pavement undecided which way to turn, a hand
was laid on his shoulder, and he wheeled, startled, to find himself
gazing into the face of his kinsman, Red Newton.
</p><p>"Come hyar," commanded the older man. "I done heered thet ye was
pardoned out, an' I sorter 'lowed ye'd be making tracks fer ther
mountings. I wants ter have talk with ye afore ye goes back."
</p><p>"I aims ter git a snack ter eat," demurred Newt. "I hain't a-goin' ter
talk ter no man afore I eats."
</p><p>The other nodded.
</p><p>"I knows a place whar we kin eat an' talk, too. Fult Cawsler hes done
moved hyar from over on Squabble Creek, an' opened a resteraw. All our
folks eats thar."
</p><p>The youth, who had three days before been Number 813, permitted himself
to be led through an uninviting doorway around which stood several gaunt
men in mud-spattered clothes. But Red Newton did not suffer him to halt
at any of those tables, covered with red oil-cloth, where several
taciturn pilgrims from the hills were feeding themselves from the blades
of their knives. Instead he whispered something to Fult Cawsler himself,
and was permitted to climb a narrow stairway at the back. At its head
they traversed a narrow hall and came into a separate room where around
a private table were seated a group of men whom the boy knew. Old Jason
Dode was, as usual, tipsy and, even as the new-comers entered, was
tilting the bottle of "red licker" which he unwillingly substituted for
the white and sweetish moonshine of his native stills. But the
important thing was that Black Pete Spooner stood gazing out of the open
window, though he stood back far enough to escape the eyes of passers-by
below. His hands were thrust deep in his pockets and on his face was the
same expression that always sat there. Few people passed Black Pete by
without turning to look again. He stood somewhat upward of six feet and
his broad shoulders tapered to a gauntness of waist and leg which gave
him the suggestion of a timber wedge. He was as tough as that
lumberman's implement and wedgelike, too, in his power of disrupting the
dividing elements which, but for him, might have hung together in
harmony.
</p><p>His dark head he carried high-flung with a swing of independence, and
that head, even more than the physique, caught and challenged attention.
</p><p>Black Pete's face was rather narrow and rather long, but its brow was
high, its nose strong and regular, and its chin had that square-blocked
declaration of resoluteness which commands respect. Under brows black
and bushy gazed out eyes that were the dominating feature. They were as
clear and penetrating as crystal lenses, and in them dwelt a sober,
almost sad contemplativeness as though the brain behind them were
habitually gazing off beyond horizons that limited other visions. They
were eyes that seemed able to pierce the opaque things of life. The hair
curled crisply in glistening black, about the forehead and neck, and
over the firm mouth a black mustache fell drooping in long ends. It was
a face that hinted at no violence, though at great strength and
determination. Rather was it suggestive of melancholy thought, and it
had won for him the satiric title of the "Deacon."
</p><p>As Red Newton and Newt Spooner came into the room, Black Pete turned his
glance for a moment upon them, then wheeled again to the window with no
apparent interest in their presence or existence. His face remained as
wistfully distracted as though he were a minister preparing a discourse,
on a text which lay very near his heart. But Newt, having seen him,
continued to stare. His eyes narrowed. He knew that several years ago,
before he had himself become a felon, the Deacon had gone West--where he
did not know. But he did know that only so long as this man remained
away from the county could there be hope of even comparative peace
between the Spooners and the Falkinses. So dreaded was the quiet-visaged
intriguer, so unalterably given to violence and the taking of lives,
that his exile had been the condition precedent to all negotiations for
truces and peace. Now Black Pete was back. Obviously, the meeting in
Cawsler's "resteraw," seventy miles from home, held some portent beyond
the casual.
</p><p>They brought the newest prodigal food, and, while he devoured it,
bolting it with wolfish hunger, he also picked up the loose ends of talk
and began to understand the situation. There had been an election down
in his section since Newt's conviction--an election and some other
things, which Red Newton briefly summarized as "merry hell." The
"penitentiarying" of Newt himself had been only the inaugural of more
sweeping and hateful innovations. Three times the old blood-feud had
broken into sporadic outbursts, and three men had been shot. But what
most galled was the fact that the commonwealth's attorney had shown a
hound-like nose for evidence and that all of the accused clansmen had
been viciously prosecuted.
</p><p>A truce had been patched, by the terms of which Jake Falerin, a cousin
of McAllister Falkins and the leader of the militant Falkinses, had
agreed to leave the hills and remove the menace of his disturbing
influence. He had gone only as far as Winchester, and, from councils
held there with visiting Falkinses, was as dangerous as though he had
remained at home, even while his own life was safer. The Spooners had
decided that this half-compliance was a practical breach of the truce,
and in accordance with that theory the Deacon had come home. At least,
he had come this far. In the meanwhile, the Honorable Cale Floyd,
commonwealth's attorney, had reaped the gratitude of his constituency.
Because he had waged relentless war on lawlessness and had begun to show
incipient symptoms of victory, he was defeated for reëlection. Sick of
the futility of such endeavor, he had closed the bare law-office before
which his shingle had swung in Jackson, and had come to Winchester,
where the field was larger and where men were more appreciative of the
qualities and principles for which he stood. He was the man who had put
stripes on Newt, and who, had he remained in office long enough, would
have made the pattern a family apparel for other Spooners.
</p><p>"That's how things stands, Newt," summarized Red, turning to the new
arrival, "an' that's what I 'lowed ye'd better know about afore ye went
back home."
</p><p>"An' them damned fellers, Jake Falerin an' Cale Floyd, is a settin' over
thar somewhars in this-hyar town right now, a-brewin' of more deviltry,"
enlightened old Jason Dode in a hiccupy voice, "an' because they hain't
in the mountings, they 'lows they kin go right on with hit. We don't
'low they kin."
</p><p>The "Deacon" turned from the window, and strolled toward the table.
Newt, having appeased his hunger, was wiping his mouth on the spotted
tablecloth. The dark giant fixed him with thoughtful eyes. When he
spoke, his voice was in contrast with those of his fellows, for his life
in the West had almost freed it from drawl and vernacular, and he spoke
with a quiet graveness.
</p><p>"Son, this Cale Floyd is the same lawyer that sent you to prison."
</p><p>Newt's eyes flashed.
</p><p>"I reckon I hain't fergot thet," he said shortly.
</p><p>Black Pete nodded sympathetically, and went on with the same grave
intonation.
</p><p>"I reckon you wouldn't mind much if he got his dues?"
</p><p>"He's ergwine ter git his'n," asserted old Jason, his bloodshot eyes
wickedly aflare. "He's ergwine ter git his'n this day afore sundown.
An' Jake Falerin's ergwine ter git his'n, too. Them two fellers'll be in
hell ternight."
</p><p>"Shut the old fool up," suggested the Deacon passively; "he'll be
shouting that out in the street after one more swig of liquor." Then he
turned to Newt again.
</p><p>"If Floyd isn't taken care of, son, the next commonwealth's attorney
will follow right after him. We've got to give a lesson an' a warning.
Do you understand?"
</p><p>"I reckon I do," replied the ex-convict, but he spoke without ardor.
</p><p>"This evenin' about half-past four o'clock," proceeded Black Pete,
"Mister Lawyer Floyd is going to make a speech in front of the
court-house. There'll be a crowd, and we figure that Falerin will be
there, too. Our boys will get up close. Some of them will start a fight
amongst themselves, and I reckon they'll pull guns. Mr. Floyd an' Mr.
Falerin are apt to get accidentally shot."
</p><p>Newt Spooner rose, and stretched his arms. His food and rest had
refreshed him, and the red spots had gone out of his cheeks.
</p><p>"What for," he inquired coolly, "air ye a-tellin' me all this-hyar
business?"
</p><p>The Deacon's grave eyes clouded, but otherwise his expression did not
change.
</p><p>"We figured you'd be interested, son. You were the first Spooner they
ever put behind penitentiary bars. This man did it. We figured that when
we came to punish these fellers--" He broke off with a shrug of his
shoulders.
</p><p>"Ye 'lowed ye mout git me ter kill 'em?" Newt spoke with absolutely no
betrayal of interest.
</p><p>"Jest the lawyer, Newt," interpolated Red Newton ingratiatingly. "He's
your'n. Hit's yore right ter punish him."
</p><p>The late convict wheeled on the speaker, and his face blackened and
lowered.
</p><p>"The hell hit is!" he screamed. "I hain't aholden nothin' 'g'inst ther
lawyer. He didn't do nothin' but what he had a license ter do. I knows
who I'm atter. You folks wants two men killed, an' you wants me ter be
ther feller ter go ter the penitentiary fer doin' hit. What the hell did
any of ye do fer me last time? What the hell do I owe any of ye, wuth
goin' back thar fer?"
</p><p>For a moment, a general silence of dazed astonishment followed the
outburst. It was the Deacon who broke it at last.
</p><p>"All right, son," he said almost gently. "Every man accordin' to his
lights. I reckon you ain't goin' to tell anybody what you've heard?"
</p><p>Newt snorted contemptuously.
</p><p>"I reckon ye knows thar hain't no danger of <u>thet</u>." "Hit 'pears like,"
interposed Red Newton with an apologetic shrug to the others, "hit
'pears like the penitenshery hes done broke ther boy's sperit. Some
folks is thet-away, but hit don't hardly seem like no Spooner."
</p><p>Newt wheeled on him.
</p><p>"Thet's a low-down lie," he stormed. "Nothin' hain't broke my sperit. I
hain't scairt of them, ner of you, ner of hell! I knows what I'm atter.
Thar's a feller I'm ergwine ter kill, but hit hain't this one. I'm
tendin' ter my own business?--not your'n. You-all got me inter one
killin', an' not a blame one of ye stood by me atterwards. Now all of ye
kin go ter hell!"
</p><p>He glared around the group for a moment and left the house, and no one
made an effort to stop him. Newt meant to take up his journey within an
hour or two. He, too, had a vengeance planned, but the man he sought was
back there in the mountains, and there was no use in "foolin' away time
an' money here."
</p><p>Yet an hour later he walked past the court-house and the large hotel
just beyond it, and abruptly, opposite the hotel door, he halted. He had
seen a buggy drive up and stop, and in the buggy was the girl who had
brought him to town. He had forgotten her, but now he paused across the
street and stood gazing. He gazed simply because she was the first
living soul who had ever been kind or gracious to him, and, precisely as
the blind man may feel the sunlight and know that it is pleasant, he
glowed dumbly under the remembrance of her smile.
</p><p>Then as he stood looking, a young man came out of the hotel with his hat
lifted and his face smiling. In his eyes was an expression easy to read,
an eager, glad welcome as he crossed the pavement with extended hand and
climbed into the buggy beside the girl. The young man was well dressed
and bore himself like a gentleman, yet he was a mountaineer by parentage
and birth.
</p><p>Newt's posture stiffened into rigidity. The color left his face and his
eyes began to burn balefully.... He had just recognized Henry Falkins.
</p><p>For an instant, the erstwhile convict stood paralyzed with astonishment,
then the blood in his arteries began pounding a fanfare of triumph.
Wheeling, he went rapidly toward the restaurant of Mr. Cawsler. There he
would find some of the clansmen, and one of them could lend him a
pistol. If they refused, he would ravish a weapon from them with his
bare hands. After that, if they let him have ten minutes for his own, he
would join them in any schemes, conspiracies or crimes that interested
them. For him, ten minutes would be sufficient. His walk broke into a
trot at which the passers-by laughed. A yokel in a hurry is always
amusing.
