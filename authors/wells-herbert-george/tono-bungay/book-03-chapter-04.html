"We got to make a fight for it," said my uncle.  "We got to face
the music!" 
<P>
I remember that even at the sight of him I had a sense of
impending calamity.  He sat under the electric light with the
shadow of his hair making bars down his face.  He looked
shrunken, and as though his skin had suddenly got loose and
yellow.  The decorations of the room seemed to have lost
freshness, and outside the blinds were up--there was not so much
fog as a dun darkness.  One saw the dingy outlines of the
chimneys opposite quite distinctly, and then a sky of such brown
as only London can display.
<P>
"I saw a placard," I said: "'More Ponderevity.'"
<P>
"That's Boom," he said.  "Boom and his damned newspapers.  He's
trying to fight me down.  Ever since I offered to buy the Daily
Decorator he's been at me.  And he thinks consolidating Do Ut cut
down the ads.  He wants everything, damn him!  He's got no sense
of dealing.  I'd like to bash his face!" 
<P>
"Well," I said, "what's to be done?" 
<P>
"Keep going," said my uncle.
<P>
"I'll smash Boom yet," he said, with sudden savagery.
<P>
"Nothing else?" I asked.
<P>
"We got to keep going.  There's a scare on.  Did you notice the
rooms?  Half the people out there this morning are reporters. 
And if I talk they touch it up!... They didn't used to touch
things up!  Now they put in character touches--insulting you. 
Don't know what journalism's coming to.  It's all Boom's doing." 
<P>
He cursed Lord Boom with considerable imaginative vigour.
<P>
"Well," said I, "what can he do?" 
<P>
"Shove us up against time, George; make money tight for us.  We
been handling a lot of money--and he tightens us up."  
<P>
"We're sound?" 
<P>
"Oh, we're sound, George.  Trust me for that!  But all the same--
There's such a lot of imagination in these things.... We're
sound enough.  That's not it."  
<P>
He blew.  "Damn Boom!" he said, and his eyes over his glasses met
mine defiantly.
<P>
"We can't, I suppose, run close hauled for a bitstop
expenditure?" 
<P>
"Where?" 
<P>
"Well,--Crest Hill"
<P>
"What!" he shouted.  "Me stop Crest Hill for Boom!"  He waved a
fist as if to hit his inkpot, and controlled himself with
difficulty.  He spoke at last in a reasonable voice.  "If I did,"
he said, "he'd kick up a fuss.  It's no good, even if I wanted
to.  Everybody's  watching the place.  If I was to stop building
we'd be down in a week."  
<P>
He had an idea.  "I wish I could do something to start a strike
or something.  No such luck.  Treat those workmen a sight too
well.  No, sink or swim, Crest Hill goes on until we're under
water."  
<P>
I began to ask questions and irritated him instantly.
<P>
"Oh, dash these explanations, George!" he cried; "You only make
things look rottener than they are.  It's your way.  It isn't a
case of figures.  We're all right--there's only one thing we got
to do."  
<P>
"Yes?" 
<P>
"Show value, George.  That's where this quap comes in; that's why
I fell in so readily with what you brought to me week before
last.  Here we are, we got our option on the perfect filament,
and all we want's canadium.  Nobody knows there's more canadium
in the world than will go on the edge of a sixpence except me and
you.  Nobody has an idee the perfect filament's more than just a
bit of theorising.  Fifty tons of quap and we'd turn that bit of
theorising into something.   We'd make the lamp trade sit on its
tail and howl.  We'd put Ediswan and all of 'em into a parcel
withour last year's trousers and a hat, and swap 'em off for a
pot ofgeraniums.  See?  We'd do it through Business
Organisations, and there you are!  See? Capern's Patent Filament!
<P>
The Ideal and the Real!  George, we'll do it!  We'll bring it
off!  And then we'll give such a facer to Boom, he'll think for
fifty years.  He's laying up for our London and African meeting. 
Let him. He can turn the whole paper on to us.  He says the
Business Organisations shares aren't worth fifty-two and we quote
'em at eighty-four.  Well, here we are gettin' ready for
him--loading our gun."  
<P>
His pose was triumphant.
<P>
"Yes," I said, "that's all right.  But I can't help thinking
where should we be if we hadn't just by accident got Capern's
Perfect Filament.  Because, you know it was an accident--my
buying up that."
<P>
He crumpled up his nose into an expression of impatient distaste
at my unreasonableness.
<P>
"And after all, the meeting's in June, and you haven't begun to
get the quap!  After all, we've still got to load our gun."
<P>
"They start on Toosday."  
<P>
"Have they got the brig?" 
<P>
"They've got a brig."  
<P>
"Gordon-Nasmyth!" I doubted.
<P>
"Safe as a bank," he said.  "More I see of that man the more I
like him.  All I wish is we'd got a steamer instead of a sailing
ship"
<P>
"And," I went on, "you seem to overlook what used to weigh with
us a bit.  This canadium side of the business and the Capern
chance has rushed you off your legs.  After all--it's stealing,
and in its way an international outrage.  They've got two
gunboats on the coast."  
<P>
I jumped up and went and stared out at the fog.
<P>
"And, by Jove, it's about our only chance!  I didn't dream."  
<P>
I turned on him.  "I've been up in the air," I said.
<P>
"Heaven knows where I haven't been.  And here's our only
chance--and you give it to that adventurous lunatic to play in
his own way--in a brig!" 
<P>
"Well, you had a voice--"
<P>
"I wish I'd been in this before.  We ought to have run out a
steamer to Lagos or one of those West Coast places and done it
from there.  Fancy a brig in the channel at this time of year, if
it blows southwest!" 
<P>
"I dessay you'd have shoved it, George.  Still you know,
George....  I believe in him."  
<P>
"Yes," I said.  "Yes, I believe in him, too.  In a way.  Still--"
<P>
We took up a telegram that was lying on his desk and opened it. 
His face became a livid yellow.  He put the flimsy paper down
with a slow, reluctant movement and took off his glasses.
<P>
"George," he said, "the luck's against us."
<P>
"What?" 
<P>
He grimaced with his mouth--in the queerest way at the telegram.
<P>
"That."  
<P>
I took it up and read:
<P>
"Motor smash compound fracture of the leg gordon nasmyth what
price mordet now"
<P>
For a moment neither of us spoke.
<P>
"That's all right," I said at last.
<P>
"Eh?" said my uncle.
<P>
"I'M going.  I'll get that quap or bust."
<P>
II                 
<P>
I had a ridiculous persuasion that I was "saving the situation." 
<P>
"I'm going," I said quite consciously and dramatically.   I saw
the whole affair--how shall I put it?--in American colours.
<P>
I sat down beside him.  "Give me all the data you've got," I
said, "and I'll pull this thing off."  
<P>
"But nobody knows exactly where--"
<P>
"Nasmyth does, and he'll tell me."
<P>
"He's been very close," said my uncle, and regarded me.
<P>
"He'll tell me all right, now he's smashed."  
<P>
He thought.  "I believe he will."  
<P>
"George," he said, "if you pull this thing off--Once or twice
before you've stepped in--with that sort of Woosh of yours--"
<P>
He left the sentence unfinished.
<P>
"Give me that note-book," I said, "and tell me all you know. 
Where's the ship?  Where's Pollack?  And where's that telegram
from?  If that quap's to be got, I'll get it or bust.  If you'll
hold on here until I get back with it."...
<P>
And so it was I jumped into the wildest adventure of my life.
<P>
I requisitioned my uncle's best car forthwith.  I went down that
night to the place of despatch named on Nasmyth's telegram,
Bampton S.O. Oxon, routed him out with a little trouble from
that centre, made things right with him and got his explicit
directions; and I was inspecting the Maud Mary with young
Pollack, his cousin and aide, the following afternoon.  She was
rather a shock to me and not at all in my style, a beast of a
brig inured to the potato trade, and she reeked from end to end
with the faint, subtle smell of raw potatoes so that it prevailed
even over the temporary smell of new paint.  She was a beast of a
brig, all hold and dirty framework, and they had ballasted her
with old iron and old rails and iron sleepers, and got a
miscellaneous lot of spades and iron wheelbarrows against the
loading of the quap.  I thought her over with Pollack,  one of
those tall blond young men who smoke pipes and don't help much,
and then by myself, and as a result I did my best to sweep
Gravesend clean of wheeling planks, and got in as much cord and
small rope as I could for lashing.  I had an idea we might need
to run up a jetty.  In addition to much ballast she held,
remotely hidden in a sort of inadvertent way a certain number of
ambiguous cases which I didn't examine, but which I gathered were
a provision against the need of a trade.
<P>
The captain was a most extraordinary creature, under the
impression we were after copper ore; he was a Roumanian Jew,
with twitching, excitable features, who had made his way to a
certificate after some preliminary naval experiences in the Black
Sea.  The mate was an Essex man of impenetrable reserve.  The
crew were astoundingly ill-clad and destitute and dirty; most of
them youths, unwashed, out of colliers.  One, the cook was a
mulatto; and one, the best-built fellow of them all, was a
Breton.  There was some subterfuge about our position on board--I
forget the particulars now--I was called the supercargo and
Pollack was the steward.  This added to the piratical flavour
that insufficient funds and Gordon-Nasmyth's original genius had
already given the enterprise.
<P>
Those two days of bustle at Gravesend, under dingy skies, in
narrow, dirty streets, were a new experience for me.  It is like
nothing else in my life.  I realised that I was a modern and a
civilised man.  I found the food filthy and the coffee horrible;
the whole town stank in my nostrils, the landlord of the Good
Intent on the quay had a stand-up quarrel with us before I could
get even a hot bath, and the bedroom I slept in was infested by a
quantity of exotic but voracious flat parasites called locally
"bugs," in the walls, in the woodwork, everywhere.  I fought
them with insect powder, and found them comatose in the morning. 
I was dipping down into the dingy underworld of the contemporary
state, and I liked it no better than I did my first dip into it
when I stayed with my Uncle Nicodemus Frapp at the bakery at
Chatham--where, by-the-by, we had to deal with cockroaches of a
smaller, darker variety, and also with bugs of sorts.
<P>
Let me confess that through all this time before we started I was
immensely self-conscious, and that Beatrice  played the part of
audience in my imagination throughout.  I was, as I say, "saving
the situation,"  and I was acutely aware of that.  The evening
before we sailed, instead of revising our medicine-chest as I
had intended, I took the car and ran across country to Lady Grove
to tell my aunt of the journey I was making, dress, and astonish
Lady Osprey by an after dinner call.
<P>
The two ladies were at home and alone beside a big fire that
seemed wonderfully cheerful after the winter night.  I remember
the effect of the little parlour in which they sat as very bright
and domestic.  Lady Osprey, in a costume of mauve and lace, sat
on a chintz sofa and played an elaborately spread-out patience
by the light of a tall shaded lamp; Beatrice, in a whiteness 
that showed her throat, smoked a cigarette in an armchair and
read with a lamp at her elbow.  The room was white-panelled and
chintz-curtained.  About those two bright centres of light were
warm dark shadow, in which a circular mirror shone like a pool of
brown water.  I carried off my raid by behaving like a slave of
etiquette.  There were moments when I think I really made Lady
Osprey believe that my call was an unavoidable necessity, that
it would have been negligent of me not to call just how and when
I did.  But at the best those were transitory moments.
<P>
They received me with disciplined amazement.  Lady Osprey was
interested in my face and scrutinised the scar.  Beatrice stood
behind her solicitude.  Our eyes met, and in hers I could see
startled interrogations.
<P>
"I'm going," I said, "to the west coast of Africa."  
<P>
They asked questions, but it suited my mood to be vague.
<P>
"We've interests there.  It is urgent I should go. I don't know
when I may return."  
<P>
After that I perceived Beatrice surveyed me steadily.
<P>
The conversation was rather difficult.  I embarked upon lengthy
thanks for their kindness to me after my accident.  I tried to
understand Lady Osprey's game of patience, but it didn't appear
that Lady Osprey was anxious for me to understand her patience. 
I came to the verge of taking my leave
<P>
"You needn't go yet," said Beatrice, abruptly.
<P>
She walked across to the piano, took a pile of music from the
cabinet near, surveyed Lady Osprey's back, and with a gesture to
me dropped it all deliberately on to the floor.
<P>
"Must talk," she said, kneeling close to me as I helped her to
pick it up.  "Turn my pages.  At the piano."
<P>
"I can't read music."  
<P>
"Turn my pages."  
<P>
Presently we were at the piano, and Beatrice was playing with
noisy inaccuracy.  She glanced over her shoulder and Lady Osprey
had resumed her patience.  The old lady was very pink, and
appeared to be absorbed in some attempt to cheat herself without
our observing it.
<P>
"Isn't West Africa a vile climate?"  "Are you going to live
there?"  "Why are you going?" 
<P>
Beatrice asked these questions in a low voice and gave me no
chance to answer.  Then taking a rhythm from the music before
her, she said--
<P>
"At the back of the house is a garden--a door in the wall--on the
lane.  Understand?" 
<P>
I turned over the pages without any effect on her playing.
<P>
"When?" I asked.
<P>
She dealt in chords.  "I wish I COULD play this!"  she said. 
"Midnight."  
<P>
She gave her attention to the music for a time.
<P>
"You may have to wait."  
<P>
"I'll wait."  
<P>
She brought her playing to an end by--as school boys
say--"stashing it up."  
<P>
"I can't play to-night," she said, standing up and meeting my
eyes.  "I wanted to give you a parting voluntary."  
<P>
"Was that Wagner, Beatrice?" asked Lady Osprey looking up from
her cards.  "It sounded very confused."  
<P>
I took my leave.  I had a curious twinge of conscience as I
parted from Lady Osprey.  Either a first intimation of
middle-age or my inexperience in romantic affairs was to blame,
but I felt a very distinct objection to the prospect of invading
this good lady's premises from the garden door.  I motored up to
the pavilion, found Cothope reading in bed, told him for the
first time of West Africa, spent an hour with him in settling all
the outstanding details of Lord Roberts B, and left that in his
hands to finish against my return.  I sent the motor back to Lady
Grove, and still wearing my fur coat--for the January night was
damp and bitterly cold--walked to Bedley Corner.  I found the
lane to the back of the Dower House without any difficulty,  and
was at the door in the wall with ten minutes to spare.  I lit a
cigar and fell to walking up and down.  This queer flavour of
intrigue, this nocturnal garden-door business, had taken me by
surprise and changed my mental altitudes.  I was startled out of
my egotistical pose and thinking intently of Beatrice, of that
elfin quality in her that always pleased me, that always took me
by surprise, that had made her for example so instantly conceive
this meeting.
<P>
She came within a minute of midnight; the door opened softly and
she appeared, a short, grey figure in a motor-coat of sheepskin,
bareheaded to the cold drizzle.  She flitted up to me, and her
eyes were shadows in her dusky face.
<P>
"Why are you going to West Africa?" she asked at once.
<P>
"Business crisis.  I have to go."
<P>
"You're not going--?  You're coming back?" 
<P>
"Three or four months," I said, "at most."  
<P>
"Then, it's nothing to do with me?" 
<P>
"Nothing," I said.  "Why should it have?" 
<P>
"Oh, that's all right.  One never knows what people think or what
people fancy."  She took me by the arm, "Let's go for a walk,"
she said.
<P>
I looked about me at darkness and rain.
<P>
"That's all right," she laughed.  "We can go along the lane and
into the Old Woking Road.  Do you mind?  Of course you don't.  My
head.  It doesn't matter.  One never meets anybody."  
<P>
"How do you know?" 
<P>
"I've wandered like this before.... Of course.  Did you
think"--she nodded her head back at her home--"that's all?" 
<P>
"No, by Jove!"  I cried; "it's manifest it isn't."  
<P>
She took my arm and turned me down the lane.  "Night's my time,"
she said by my side.  "There's a touch of the werewolf in my
blood.  One never knows in these old families.... I've wondered
often.... Here we are, anyhow, alone in the world.  Just
darkness and cold and a sky of clouds and wet.  And we--together.
<P>
I like the wet on my face and hair, don't you?  When do you
sail?"
<P>
I told her to-morrow.
<P>
"Oh, well, there's no to-morrow now.  You and I!"  She stopped
and confronted me.
<P>
"You don't say a word except to answer!" 
<P>
"No," I said.
<P>
"Last time you did all the talking."  
<P>
"Like a fool.  Now--"
<P>
We looked at each other's two dim faces.  "You're glad to be
here?" 
<P>
"I'm glad--I'm beginning to be--it's more than glad."  
<P>
She put her hands on my shoulders and drew me down to kiss her.
<P>
"Ah!" she said, and for a moment or so we just clung to one
another.
<P>
"That's all," she said, releasing herself.  "What bundles of
clothes we are to-night.  I felt we should kiss some day again. 
Always.  The last time was ages ago."  
<P>
"Among the fern stalks."  
<P>
"Among the bracken.  You remember.  And your lips were cold. 
Were mine?  The same lips--after so long--after so much!... And
now let's trudge through this blotted-out world together for a
time.  Yes, let me take your arm.  Just trudge.  See?  Hold tight
to me because I know the way--and don't talk--don't talk.  Unless
you want to talk.... Let me tell you things!  You see, dear, the
whole world is blotted out--it's dead and gone, and we're in this
place.  This dark wild place.... We're dead.  Or all the world
is dead.  No!  We're dead.  No one can see us.  We're shadows. 
We've got out of our positions, out of our bodies--and together. 
That's the good thing of it--together.  But that's why the world
can't see us and why we hardly see the world.  Sssh!  Is it all
right?"
<P>
"It's all right," I said.
<P>
We stumbled along for a time in a close silence.  We passed a
dim-lit, rain-veiled window.
<P>
"The silly world," she said, "the silly world!  It eats and
sleeps.  If the wet didn't patter so from the trees we'd hear it
snoring.  It's dreaming such stupid things--stupid judgments.  It
doesn't know we are passing, we two--free of it--clear of it. 
You and I!"
<P>
We pressed against each other reassuringly.
<P>
"I'm glad we're dead," she whispered.  "I'm glad we're dead.  I
was tired of it, dear.  I was so tired of it, dear, and so
entangled."  
<P>
She stopped abruptly.
<P>
We splashed through a string of puddles.  I began to remember
things I had meant to say.
<P>
"Look here!" I cried.  "I want to help you beyond measure.  You
are entangled.  What is the trouble?  I asked you to marry me. 
You said you would.  But there's something."  
<P>
My thoughts sounded clumsy as I said them.
<P>
"Is it something about my position?... Or is it
something--perhaps--about some other man?" 
<P>
There was an immense assenting silence.
<P>
"You've puzzled me so.  At first--I mean quite early--I thought
you meant to make me marry you."  
<P>
"I did."  
<P>
"And then?" 
<P>
"To-night," she said after a long pause, "I can't explain.  No!
I can't explain.  I love you! But--explanations!  To-night my
dear, here we are in the world alone--and the world doesn't
matter.  Nothing matters.  Here I am in the cold with you and my
bed away there deserted.  I'd tell you--I will tell you when
things enable me to tell you, and soon enough they will.  But
to-night--I won't--I won't."  
<P>
She left my side and went in front of me.
<P>
She turned upon me.  "Look here," she said, "I insist upon your
being dead.  Do you understand?  I'm not joking.  To-night you
and I are out of life.  It's our time together.  There may be
other times, but this we won't spoil.  We're--in Hades if you
like.  Where there's nothing to hide and nothing to tell.  No
bodies even.  No bothers.  We loved each other--down there--and
were kept apart, but now it doesn't matter.  It's over.... If
you won't agree to that--I will go home."  
<P>
"I wanted," I began.
<P>
"I know.  Oh! my dear, if you'd only understand I understand.  If
you'd only not care--and love me to-night."  
<P>
"I do love you," I said.
<P>
"Then LOVE me," she answered, "and leave all the things that
bother you.  Love me!  Here I am!" 
<P>
"But!--" 
<P>
"No!" she said.
<P>
"Well, have your way."  
<P>
So she carried her point, and we wandered into the night together
and Beatrice talked to me of love....
<P>
I'd never heard a woman before in all my life who could talk of
love, who could lay bare and develop and touch with imagination
all that mass of fine emotion every woman, it may be, hides.  She
had read of love, she had thought of love, a thousand sweet
lyrics had sounded through her brain and left fine fragments in
her memory; she poured it out, all of it, shamelessly, skilfully,
for me.  I cannot give any sense of that talk, I cannot even tell
how much of the delight of it was the magic of her voice, the
glow of her near presence.  And always we walked swathed warmly
through a chilly air, along dim, interminable greasy roads--with
never a soul abroad it seemed to us, never a beast in the fields.
<P>
"Why do people love each other?" I said.
<P>
"Why not?" 
<P>
"But why do I love you?  Why is your voice better than any voice,
your face sweeter than any face?" 
<P>
"And why do I love you?" she asked; "not only what is fine in
you, but what isn't?  Why do I love your dullness, your
arrogance?  For I do.  To--night I love the very raindrops on the
fur of your coat!"...
<P>
So we talked; and at last very wet, still glowing but a little
tired, we parted at the garden door.  We had been wandering for
two hours in our strange irrational community of happiness, and
all the world about us, and particularly Lady Osprey and her
household, had been asleep--and dreaming of anything rather than
Beatrice in the night and rain.
<P>
She stood in the doorway, a muffled figure with eyes that glowed.
<P>
"Come back," she whispered.  "I shall wait for you."  
<P>
She hesitated.
<P>
She touched the lapel of my coat.  "I love you NOW," she said,
and lifted her face to mine.
<P>
I held her to me and was atremble from top to toe. "O God!" I
cried.  "And I must go!" 
<P>
She slipped from my arms and paused, regarding me.  For an
instant the world seemed full of fantastic possibilities.
<P>
"Yes, GO!" she said, and vanished and slammed the door upon me,
leaving me alone like a man new fallen from fairyland in the
black darkness of the night.
<P>
III
<P>
That expedition to Mordet Island stands apart from all the rest
of my life, detached, a piece by itself with an atmosphere of
its own.  It would, I suppose, make a book by itself--it has made
a fairly voluminous official report--but so far as this novel of
mine goes it is merely an episode, a contributory experience, and
I mean to keep it at that.
<P>
Vile weather, an impatient fretting against unbearable slowness
and delay, sea--sickness, general discomfort  and humiliating
self--revelation are the master values of these memories.
<P>
I was sick all through the journey out.  I don't know why.  It
was the only time I was ever sea-sick, and I have seen some
pretty bad weather since I became a boat-builder.  But that
phantom smell of potatoes was peculiarly vile to me.  Coming back
on the brig we were all ill, every one of us, so soon as we got
to sea, poisoned,  I firmly believe, by quap.  On the way out
most of the others recovered in a few days, but the stuffiness
below, the coarse food, the cramped dirty accommodation kept me,
if not actually sea-sick, in a state of acute physical
wretchedness the whole time.  The ship abounded in cockroaches
and more intimate vermin.  I was cold all the time until after we
passed Cape Verde, then I became steamily hot; I had been too
preoccupied with Beatrice and my keen desire to get the Maud Mary
under way at once, to consider a proper wardrobe for myself, and
in particular I lacked a coat.  Heavens! how I lacked that coat!
And, moreover, I was cooped up with two of the worst bores in
Christendom, Pollack and the captain.  Pollack, after conducting
his illness in a style better adapted to the capacity of an opera
house than a small compartment, suddenly got insupportably well
and breezy, and produced a manly pipe in which he smoked a
tobacco as blond as himself, and divided his time almost equally
between smoking it and trying to clean it.  "There's only three
things you can clean a pipe with," he used to remark with a twist
of paper in hand.  "The best's a feather, the second's a straw,
and the third's a girl's hairpin.  I never see such a ship.  You
can't find any of 'em.  Last time I came this way I did find
hairpins anyway, and found 'em on the floor of the captain's
cabin.  Regular deposit.  Eh?... Feelin' better?" 
<P>
At which I usually swore.
<P>
"Oh, you'll be all right soon.  Don't mind my puffin' a bit? 
Eh?"
<P>
He never tired of asking me to "have a hand at Nap.  Good game. 
Makes you forget it, and that's half the battle."  
<P>
He would sit swaying with the rolling of the ship and suck at his
pipe of blond tobacco and look with an inexpressibly sage but
somnolent blue eye at the captain by the hour together. 
"Captain's a Card," he would say over and over again as the
outcome of these meditations.  "He'd like to know what we're up
to. He'd like to know--no end."  
<P>
That did seem to be the captain's ruling idea.  But he also
wanted to impress me with the notion that he was a gentleman of
good family and to air a number of views adverse to the English,
to English literature, to the English constitution, and the like.
<P>
He had learnt the sea in the Roumanian navy, and English out of a
book; he would still at times pronounce the e's at the end of
"there" and "here"; he was a naturalised Englishman, and he drove
me into a reluctant and uncongenial patriotism by his everlasting
carping at things English.  Pollack would set himself to "draw
him out."  Heaven alone can tell how near I came to murder.
<P>
Fifty-three days I had outward, cooped up with these two and a
shy and profoundly depressed mate who read the Bible on Sundays
and spent the rest of his leisure in lethargy, three and fifty
days of life cooped up in a perpetual smell, in a persistent sick
hunger that turned from the sight of food, in darkness, cold and
wet, in a lightly ballasted ship that rolled and pitched and
swayed.  And all the time the sands in the hour-glass of my
uncle's fortunes were streaming out.  Misery!  Amidst it all I
remember only one thing brightly, one morning of sunshine in the
Bay of Biscay and a vision of frothing waves, sapphire green, a
bird following our wake and our masts rolling about the sky. 
Then wind and rain close in on us again.
<P>
You must not imagine they were ordinary days, days, I mean, of an
average length; they were not so much days as long damp slabs of
time that stretched each one to the horizon, and much of that
length was night.  One paraded the staggering deck in a borrowed
sou'-wester hour after hour in the chilly, windy, splashing and
spitting  darkness, or sat in the cabin, bored and ill, and
looked at the faces of those inseparable companions by the help
of a lamp that gave smell rather than light.  Then one would see
going up, up, up, and then sinking down, down, down, Pollack,
extinct pipe in mouth, humorously observant, bringing his mind
slowly to the seventy-seventh decision that the captain was a
Card, while the words flowed from the latter in a nimble
incessant  good.  "Dis England eet is not a country aristocratic,
no! Eet is a glorified bourgeoisie! Eet is plutocratic.  In
England dere is no aristocracy since de Wars of Roses.  In the
rest of Europe east of the Latins, yes; in England, no.
<P>
"Eet is all middle-class, youra England.  Everything you look
at, middle-class.  Respectable!  Everything good--eet is, you
say, shocking.  Madame Grundy!  Eet is all limited and computing
and self-seeking.  Dat is why your art is so limited, youra
fiction, your philosophin, why you are all so inartistic.  You
want nothing but profit!  What will pay!  What would you?"...
<P>
He had all those violent adjuncts to speech we Western Europeans
have abandoned, shruggings of the shoulders, waving of the arms,
thrusting out of the face, wonderful grimaces and twiddlings of
the hands under your nose until you wanted to hit them away.  Day
after day it went on, and I had to keep any anger to myself, to
reserve myself for the time ahead when it would be necessary to
see the quap was got aboard and stowed--knee deep in this man's
astonishment.  I knew he would make a thousand objections to all
we had before us.  He talked like a drugged man.  It ran glibly
over his tongue.  And all the time one could see his seamanship
fretting him, he was gnawed by responsibility, perpetually
uneasy about the ship's position, perpetually imagining dangers. 
If a sea hit us exceptionally hard he'd be out of the cabin in an
instant making an outcry of inquiries, and he was pursued by a
dread of the hold, of ballast shifting, of insidious wicked
leaks.  As we drew near the African coast his fear of rocks and
shoals became infectious.
<P>
"I do not know dis coast," he used to say.  "I cama hera because
Gordon-Nasmyth was coming too.  Den he does not come!" 
<P>
"Fortunes of war," I said, and tried to think in vain if any
motive but sheer haphazard could have guided Gordon-Nasmyth in
the choice of these two men.  I think perhaps Gordon-Nasmyth had
the artistic temperament and wanted contrasts, and also that the
captain  helped him to express his own malignant Anti-Britishism.
<P>
He was indeed an exceptionally inefficient captain.  On the whole
I was glad I had come even at the eleventh hour to see to things.
<P>
(The captain, by-the-by, did at last, out of sheer nervousness,
get aground at the end of Mordet's Island, but we got off in an
hour or so with a swell and a little hard work in the boat.)
<P>
I suspected the mate of his opinion of the captain long before he
expressed it.  He was, I say, a taciturn man, but one day speech
broke through him.  He had been sitting at the table with his
arms folded on it, musing drearily, pipe in mouth, and the voice
of the captain drifted down from above.
<P>
The mate lifted his heavy eyes to me and regarded me for a
moment.  Then he began to heave with the beginnings of speech. 
He disembarrassed himself of his pipe.  I cowered with
expectation.  Speech was coming at last.  Before he spoke he
nodded reassuringly once or twice.
<P>
"E--"
<P>
He moved his head strangely and mysteriously, but a child might
have known he spoke of the captain.
<P>
"E's a foreigner."  
<P>
He regarded me doubtfully for a time, and at last decided for the
sake of lucidity to clench the matter.
<P>
"That's what E is--a DAGO!"
<P>
He nodded like a man who gives a last tap to a nail, and I could
see he considered his remark well and truly laid.  His face,
though still resolute, became as tranquil and uneventful as a
huge hall after a public meeting has dispersed out of it, and
finally he closed and locked it with his pipe.
<P>
"Roumanian Jew, isn't he?" I said.
<P>
He nodded darkly and almost forbiddingly.
<P>
More would have been too much.  The thing was said.  But from
that time forth I knew I could depend upon him and that he and I
were friends.  It happens I never did have to depend upon him,
but that does not affect our relationship.
<P>
Forward the crew lived lives very much after the fashion of ours,
more crowded, more cramped and dirty, wetter, steamier, more
verminous.  The coarse food they had was still not so coarse but
that they did not think they were living "like fighting cocks." 
So far as I could make out they were all nearly destitute men;
hardly any of them had a proper sea outfit, and what small
possessions they had were a source of mutual distrust.   And as
we pitched and floundered southward they gambled and fought, were
brutal to one another, argued and wrangled loudly, until we
protested at the uproar.
<P>
There's no romance about the sea in a small sailing ship as I saw
it.  The romance is in the mind of the landsman dreamer.  These
brigs and schooners and brigantines that still stand out from
every little port are relics from an age of petty trade, as
rotten and obsolescent as a Georgian house that has sunken into a
slum.  They are indeed just floating fragments of slum, much as
icebergs are floating fragments of glacier. The civilised man who
has learnt to wash, who has developed  a sense of physical
honour, of cleanly temperate feeding, of time, can endure them no
more.  They pass, and the clanking coal-wasting steamers will
follow them, giving place to cleaner, finer things....
<P>
But so it was I made my voyage to Africa, and came at last into a
world of steamy fogs and a hot smell of vegetable decay, and into
sound and sight of surf and distant intermittent glimpses of the
coast.  I lived a strange concentrated life through all that
time, such a life as a creature must do that has fallen in a
well.  All my former ways ceased, all my old vistas became
memories.
<P>
The situation I was saving was very small and distant now; I felt
its urgency no more.  Beatrice and Lady Grove, my uncle and the
Hardingham, my soaring in the air and my habitual wide vision of
swift effectual things, became as remote as if they were in some
world I had left for ever....
<P>
IV
<P>
All these African memories stand by themselves.  It was for me an
expedition into the realms of undisciplined nature out of the
world that is ruled by men, my first bout with that hot side of
our mother that gives you the jungle--that cold side that gives
you the air-eddy I was beginning to know passing well.  They are
memories woven upon a fabric of sunshine and heat and a constant
warm smell of decay.  They end in rain--such rain as I had never
seen before, a vehement, a frantic downpouring of water, but our
first slow passage through the channels behind Mordet's Island
was in incandescent sunshine.
<P>
There we go in my memory still, a blistered dirty ship with
patched sails and a battered mermaid to present Maud Mary,
sounding and taking thought between high ranks of forest whose
trees come out knee-deep at last in the water.  There we go
with a little breeze on our quarter, Mordet Island rounded and
the quap, it might be within a day of us.
<P>
Here and there strange blossoms woke the dank intensities  of
green with a trumpet call of colour.  Things crept among the
jungle and peeped and dashed back rustling into stillness. 
Always in the sluggishly drifting,  opaque water were eddyings
and stirrings; little rushes of bubbles came chuckling up
light-heartedly from this or that submerged conflict and
tragedy; now and again were crocodiles like a stranded fleet of
logs basking in the sun.  Still it was by day, a dreary stillness
broken only by insect sounds and the creaking and flapping of our
progress, by the calling of the soundings and the captain's
confused shouts; but in the night as we lay moored to a clump of
trees the darkness brought a thousand swampy things to life and
out of the forest came screaming and howlings, screaming and
yells that made us glad to be afloat.  And once we saw between
the tree stems long blazing fires.  We passed two or three
villages landward, and brown-black women and children came and
stared at us and gesticulated, and once a man came out in a boat
from a creek and hailed us in an unknown tongue; and so at last
we came to a great open place, a broad lake rimmed with a
desolation of mud and bleached refuse and dead trees, free from
crocodiles or water birds or sight or sound of any living thing,
and saw far off, even as Nasmyth had described, the ruins of the
deserted station, and hard by two little heaps of buff-hued
rubbish under a great rib of rock, the quap! The forest receded. 
The land to the right of us fell away and became barren, and far
on across notch in its backbone was surf and the sea.
<P>
We took the ship in towards those heaps and the ruined jetty
slowly and carefully.  The captain came and talked.
<P>
"This is eet?" he said.
<P>
"Yes," said I.
<P>
"Is eet for trade we have come?" 
<P>
This was ironical.
<P>
"No," said I.
<P>
"Gordon-Nasmyth would haf told me long ago what it ees for we
haf come."  
<P>
"I'll tell you now," I said.  "We are going to lay in as close as
we can to those two heaps of stuff--you see them?--under the
rock.  Then we are going to chuck all our ballast overboard and
take those in.  Then we're going home."  
<P>
"May I presume to ask--is eet gold?" 
<P>
"No," I said incivilly, "it isn't."
<P>
"Then what is it?" 
<P>
"It's stuff--of some commercial value."  
<P>
"We can't do eet," he said.
<P>
"We can," I answered reassuringly.
<P>
"We can't," he said as confidently.  "I don't mean what you mean.
<P>
You know so liddle--But--dis is forbidden country."  
<P>
I turned on him suddenly angry and met bright excited eyes.  For
a minute we scrutinised one another.  Then I said, "That's our
risk.  Trade is forbidden. But this isn't trade.... This thing's
got to be done."  
<P>
His eyes glittered and he shook his head....
<P>
The brig stood in slowly through the twilight toward this strange
scorched and blistered stretch of beach, and the man at the wheel
strained his ears to listening the low-voiced angry argument
that began between myself and the captain, that was presently
joined by Pollack.  We moored at last within a hundred yards of
our goal, and all through our dinner and far into the night we
argued intermittently and fiercely with the captain about our
right to load just what we pleased.  "I will haf nothing to do
with eet," he persisted.  "I wash my hands."  It seemed that
night as though we argued in vain.  "If it is not trade," he
said, "it is prospecting and mining.  That is worse.  Any one who
knows anything--outside England--knows that is worse."  
<P>
We argued and I lost my temper and swore at him.  Pollack kept
cooler and chewed his pipe watchfully with that blue eye of his
upon the captain's gestures.  Finally I went on deck to cool. 
The sky was overcast I discovered all the men were in a knot
forward, staring at the faint quivering luminosity that had
spread over the heaps of quap, a phosphorescence such as one sees
at times on rotting wood.  And about the beach east and west
there were patches and streaks of something like diluted
moonshine....
<P>
In the small hours I was still awake and turning over scheme
after scheme in my mind whereby I might circumvent the captain's
opposition.  I meant to get that quap aboard if I had to kill
some one to do it.  Never in my life had I been so thwarted!
After this intolerable voyage!  There came a rap at my cabin door
and then it opened and I made out a bearded face.  "Come in," I
said, and a black voluble figure I could just see obscurely came
in to talk in my private ear and fill my cabin with its
whisperings and gestures.  It was the captain.  He, too, had been
awake and thinking things over.  He had come to
explain--enormously.  I lay there hating him and wondering if I
and Pollack could lock him in his cabin and run the ship without
him.  "I do not want to spoil dis expedition," emerged from a
cloud of protestations, and then I was able to disentangle  "a
commission--shush a small commission--for special risks!"
"Special risks" became frequent.  I let him explain himself out. 
It appeared he was also demanding an apology for something I had
said.  No doubt I had insulted him generously.  At last came
definite offers.  I broke my silence and bargained.
<P>
"Pollack!" I cried and hammered the partition.
<P>
"What's up?" asked Pollack.
<P>
I stated the case concisely.
<P>
There came a silence.
<P>
"He's a Card," said Pollack.  "Let's give him his commission.  I
don't mind."  
<P>
"Eh?" I cried.
<P>
"I said he was a Card, that's all," said Pollack. "I'm coming."
<P>
He appeared in my doorway a faint white figure joined our
vehement whisperings.
<P>
We had to buy the captain off; we had to promise him ten per
cent. of our problematical profits.  We were to give him ten per
cent. on what we sold the cargo for over and above his
legitimate pay, and I found in my out-bargained and disordered
state small consolation in the thought that I, as the
Gordon-Nasmyth expedition, was to sell the stuff to myself as
Business Organisations.  And he further exasperated me by
insisting on having our bargain in writing.  "In the form of a
letter," he insisted.
<P>
"All right," I acquiesced, "in the form of a letter.  Here goes!
Get a light!" 
<P>
"And the apology," he said, folding up the letter.
<P>
"All right," I said; "Apology."  
<P>
My hand shook with anger as I wrote, and afterwards I could not
sleep for hate of him.  At last I got up.  I suffered, I found,
from an unusual clumsiness.  I struck my toe against my cabin
door, and cut myself as I shaved.  I found myself at last pacing
the deck under the dawn in a mood of extreme exasperation.  The
sun rose abruptly and splashed light blindingly into my eyes and
I swore at the sun.  I found myself imagining fresh obstacles
with the men and talking aloud in anticipatory rehearsal of the
consequent row.
<P>
The malaria of the quap was already in my blood.  
<P>
V                                         
<P>
Sooner or later the ridiculous embargo that now lies upon all the
coast eastward of Mordet Island will be lifted and the reality of
the deposits of quap ascertained.   I am sure that we were merely
taking the outcrop of a stratum of nodulated deposits that dip
steeply seaward.  Those heaps were merely the crumbled out
contents of two irregular cavities in the rock; they are as
natural as any talus or heap of that kind, and the mud along the
edge of the water for miles is mixed with quap, and is
radio-active and lifeless and faintly phosphorescent at night. 
But the reader will find the full particulars of my impression of
all this in the Geological Magazine for October, l905, and to
that I must refer him.  There, too, he will find my unconfirmed
theories of its nature.  If I am right it is something far more
significant from the scientific point of view than those
incidental constituents of various rare metals, pitchblende, 
rutile, and the like, upon which the revolutionary discoveries of
the last decade are based.  Those are just little molecular
centres of disintegration, of that mysterious  decay and rotting
of those elements, elements once regarded as the most stable
things in nature.  But there is something--the only word that
comes near it is CANCEROUS--and that is not very near, about
the whole of quap, something that creeps and lives as a disease
lives by destroying; an elemental stirring and disarrangement, 
incalculably maleficent and strange.
<P>
This is no imaginative comparison of mine.  To my mind
radio-activity is a real disease of matter.  Moreover, it is a
contagious disease.  It spreads.  You bring those debased and
crumbling atoms near others and those too presently catch the
trick of swinging themselves  out of coherent existence.  It is
in matter exactly what the decay of our old culture is in
society, a loss of traditions and distinctions and assured
reactions.  When I think of these inexplicable dissolvent centres
that have come into being in our globe--these quap heaps are
surely by far the largest that have yet been found in the world;
the rest as yet mere specks in grains and crystals--I am haunted
by a grotesque fancy of the ultimate eating away and dry-rotting
and dispersal of all our world.  So that while man still
struggles and dreams his very substance will change and crumble
from beneath him.  I mention this here as a queer persistent 
fancy.  Suppose, indeed, that is to be the end of our planet; no
splendid climax and finale, no towering accumulation of
achievements, but just--atomic decay! I add that to the ideas of
the suffocating comet, the dark body out of space, the burning
out of the sun, the distorted orbit, as a new and far more
possible end--as Science can see ends--to this strange by-play
of matter  that we call human life.  I do not believe this can be
the end; no human soul can believe in such an end and go on
living, but to it science points as a possible thing, science and
reason alike.  If single human beings--if one single ricketty
infant--can be born as it were by accident and die futile, why
not the whole race?  These are questions I have never answered,
that now I never attempt to answer, but the thought of quap and
its mysteries brings them back to me.
<P>
I can witness that the beach and mud for two miles or more either
way was a lifeless beach--lifeless as I could have imagined no
tropical mud could ever be, and all the dead branches and leaves
and rotting dead fish and so forth that drifted ashore became
presently shrivelled and white.  Sometimes crocodiles would come
up out of the water and bask, and now and then water birds would
explore the mud and rocky ribs that rose out of it, in a mood of
transitory speculation.  That was its utmost admiration.  And
the air felt at once hot and austere, dry and blistering, and
altogether different the warm moist embrace that had met us at
our first African landfall and to which we had grown accustomed.
<P>
I believe that the primary influence of the quap upon us was to
increase the conductivity of our nerves, but that is a mere
unjustifiable speculation on my part.  At any rate it gave a sort
of east wind effect to life.  We all became irritable, clumsy,
languid and disposed to be impatient with our languor.  We moored
the brig to the rocks with difficulty, and got aground on mud and
decided  to stick there and tow off when we had done--the bottom
was as greasy as butter.  Our efforts to fix up planks and
sleepers in order to wheel the quap aboard were as ill-conceived
as that sort of work can be--and that sort of work can at times
be very ill-conceived.   The captain had a superstitious fear of
his hold: he became wildly gesticulatory and expository and
incompetent at the bare thought of it.  His shouts still echo in
my memory, becoming as each crisis approached less and less like
any known tongue.
<P>
But I cannot now write the history of those days of blundering
and toil: of how Milton, one of the boys, fell from a plank to
the beach, thirty feet perhaps, with his barrow and broke his arm
and I believe a rib, of how I and Pollack set the limb and nursed
him through the fever that followed, of how one man after another
succumbed to a feverish malaria, and how I--by virtue of my
scientific reputation--was obliged to play the part of doctor and
dose them with quinine, and then finding that worse than nothing,
with rum and small doses of Easton's Syrup, of which there
chanced to be a case of bottles aboard--Heaven and
Gordon-Nasmyth know why.  For three long days we lay in misery
and never shipped a barrow-load.  Then, when they resumed, the
men's hands broke out into sores.  There were no gloves
available; and I tried to get them, while they shovelled and
wheeled, to cover their hands with stockings or greased rags. 
They would not do this on account of the heat and discomfort. 
This attempt of mine did, however, direct their attention to the
quap as the source of their illness and precipitated what in the
end finished our lading, an informal strike.  "We've had enough
of this," they said, and they meant it.  They came aft to say as
much.  They cowed the captain.
<P>
Through all these days the weather was variously vile, first a
furnace heat under a sky of a scowling intensity of blue, then a
hot fog that stuck in one's throat like wool and turned the men
on the planks into colourless figures of giants, then a wild
burst of thunderstorms, mad elemental uproar and rain.  Through
it all, against illness, heat, confusion of mind, one master
impetus prevailed with me, to keep the shipping going, to
maintain  one motif at least, whatever else arose or ceased, the
chuff of the spades, the squeaking and shriek of the barrows, the
pluppa, pluppa, pluppa, as the men came trotting along the
swinging high planks, and then at last, the dollop, dollop, as
the stuff shot into the hold. "Another barrow-load, thank God!
Another fifteen hundred, or it may be two thousand pounds, for
the saving of Ponderevo!...!" 
<P>
I found out many things about myself and humanity in those weeks
of effort behind Mordet Island.  I understand now the heart of
the sweater, of the harsh employer, of the nigger-driver.  I had
brought these men into a danger they didn't understand, I was
fiercely resolved to overcome their opposition and bend and use
them for my purpose, and I hated the men.  But I hated all
humanity during the time that the quap was near me.
<P>
And my mind was pervaded, too, by a sense of urgency and by the
fear that we should be discovered and our proceedings stopped.  I
wanted to get out to sea again--to be beating up northward with
our plunder.  I was afraid our masts showed to seaward and might
betray us to some curious passer on the high sea.  And one
evening near the end I saw a canoe with three natives far off
down the lake; I got field-glasses from the captain  and
scrutinised them, and I could see them staring at us.  One man
might have been a half-breed and was dressed in white.  They
watched us for some time very quietly and then paddled off into
some channel in the forest shadows.
<P>
And for three nights running, so that it took a painful grip
upon my inflamed imagination, I dreamt of my uncle's face, only
that it was ghastly white like a clown's, and the throat was cut
from ear to ear--a long ochreous cut.  "Too late," he said; "Too
late!..."
<P>
VI                      
<P>
A day or so after we had got to work upon the quap I found myself
so sleepless and miserable that the ship became unendurable. 
Just before the rush of sunrise I borrowed Pollack's gun, walked
down the planks, clambered over the quap heaps and prowled along
the beach.  I went perhaps a mile and a half that day and some
distance beyond the ruins of the old station.  I became 
interested in the desolation about me, and found when I returned
that I was able to sleep for nearly an hour.  It was delightful
to have been alone for so long,--no captain, no Pollack, no one. 
Accordingly I repeated this expedition the next morning and the
next until it became a custom with me.  There was little for me
to do once the digging and wheeling was organised, and so these
prowlings of mine grew longer and longer, and presently I began
to take food with me.
<P>
I pushed these walks far beyond the area desolated by the quap. 
On the edges of that was first a zone of stunted vegetation, then
a sort of swampy jungle that was difficult to penetrate, and then
the beginnings of the forest, a scene of huge tree stems and
tangled creeper ropes and roots mingled with oozy mud.  Here I
used to loaf in a state between botanising and reverie--always
very anxious to know what was up above in the sunlight--and here
it was I murdered a man.
<P>
It was the most unmeaning and purposeless murder imaginable. 
Even as I write down its well-remembered particulars there comes
again the sense of its strangeness, its pointlessness, its
incompatibility with any of the neat and definite theories people
hold about life and the meaning of the world.  I did this thing
and I want to tell of my doing it, but why I did it and
particularly why I should be held responsible for it I cannot
explain.
<P>
That morning I had come upon a track in the forest, and it had
occurred to me as a disagreeable idea that this was a human
pathway.  I didn't want to come upon any human beings.  The less
our expedition saw of the African population the better for its
prospects.  Thus far we had been singularly free from native
pestering.  So I turned back and was making my way over mud and
roots and dead fronds and petals scattered from the green world
above when abruptly I saw my victim.
<P>
I became aware of him perhaps forty feet off standing quite
still and regarding me.
<P>
He wasn't by any means a pretty figure.  He was very black and
naked except for a dirty loin-cloth, his legs were ill-shaped
and his toes spread wide and the upper edge of his cloth and a
girdle of string cut his clumsy abdomen into folds.  His forehead
was low, his nose very flat and his lower lip swollen and
purplish-red.  His hair was short and fuzzy, and about his neck
was a string and a little purse of skin.  He carried a musket,
and a powder-flask was stuck in his girdle.  It was a curious
confrontation.  There opposed to him stood I, a little soiled,
perhaps, but still a rather elaborately civilised human being,
born, bred and trained in a vague tradition.  In my hand was an
unaccustomed gun.  And each of us was essentially a teeming,
vivid brain, tensely excited by the encounter, quite unaware of
the other's mental content or what to do with him.
<P>
He stepped back a pace or so, stumbled and turned to run.
<P>
"Stop," I cried; "stop, you fool!" and started to run after him,
shouting such things in English.  But I was no match for him over
the roots and mud.
<P>
I had a preposterous idea.  "He mustn't get away and tell them!" 
<P>
And with that instantly I brought both feet together, raised my
gun, aimed quite coolly, drew the trigger carefully and shot him
neatly in the back.
<P>
I saw, and saw with a leap of pure exaltation, the smash of my
bullet between his shoulder blades.  "Got him," said I, dropping
my gun and down he flopped and died without a groan.  "By Jove!"
I cried with note of surprise, "I've killed him!"  I looked about
me and then went forward cautiously, in a mood between curiosity
and astonishment, to look at this man whose soul I had flung so
unceremoniously out of our common world.  I went to him, not as
one goes to something one has made or done, but as one approaches
something found.
<P>
He was frightfully smashed out in front; he must have died in the
instant.  I stooped and raised him by his shoulder and realised
that.  I dropped him, and stood about and peered about me through
the trees.  "My word!" I said.  He was the second dead human
being--apart, I mean, from surgical properties and mummies  and
common shows of that sort--that I have ever seen.  I stood over
him wondering, wondering beyond measure.
<P>
A practical idea came into that confusion.  Had any one heard the
gun?
<P>
I reloaded.
<P>
After a time I felt securer, and gave my mind again to the dead I
had killed.  What must I do?
<P>
It occurred to me that perhaps I ought to bury him.  At any rate,
I ought to hide him.  I reflected coolly, and then put my gun
within easy reach and dragged him by the arm towards a place
where the mud seemed soft, and thrust him in.  His powder-flask
slipped from his loin-cloth, and I went back to get it.  Then I
pressed him down with the butt of my rifle.
<P>
Afterwards this all seemed to me most horrible, but at the time
it was entirely a matter-of-fact transaction.  I looked round
for any other visible evidence of his fate, looked round as one
does when one packs one's portmanteau in an hotel bedroom.
<P>
When I got my bearings, and carefully returned towards the ship. 
I had the mood of grave concentration of a boy who has lapsed
into poaching.  And the business only began to assume proper
proportions for me as I got near the ship, to seem any other kind
of thing than the killing of a bird or rabbit.
<P>
In the night, however, it took on enormous and portentous 
forms.  "By God!" I cried suddenly, starting wide awake; "but it
was murder!" 
<P>
I lay after that wide awake, staring at my memories.  In some odd
way these visions mixed up with my dream of in my uncle in his
despair.  The black body which saw now damaged and partly buried,
but which, nevertheless,  I no longer felt was dead but acutely
alive and perceiving, I mixed up with the ochreous slash under my
uncle's face.  I tried to dismiss this horrible obsession from my
mind, but it prevailed over all my efforts.
<P>
The next day was utterly black with my sense of that ugly
creature's body.  I am the least superstitious of men, but it
drew me.  It drew me back into those thickets  to the very place
where I had hidden him.
<P>
Some evil and detestable beast had been at him, and he lay
disinterred.
<P>
Methodically I buried his swollen and mangled carcass again, and
returned to the ship for another night of dreams.  Next day for
all the morning I resisted the impulse to go to him, and played
nap with Pollack with my secret gnawing at me, and in the evening
started to go and was near benighted.  I never told a soul of
them of this thing I had done.
<P>
Next day I went early, and he had gone, and there were human
footmarks and ugly stains round the muddy hole from which he had
been dragged.
<P>
I returned to the ship, disconcerted and perplexed. That day it
was the men came aft, with blistered hands and faces, and sullen
eyes.  When they proclaimed, through Edwards, their spokesman,
"We've had enough of this, and we mean it," I answered very
readily, "So have I.  Let's go." 
<P>
VII                         
<P>
We were none too soon.  People had been reconnoitring us, the
telegraph had been at work, and we were not four hours at sea
before we ran against the gunboat that had been sent down the
coast to look for us and that would have caught us behind the
island like a beast in a trap.  It was a night of driving cloud
that gave intermittent gleams of moonlight; the wind and sea were
strong and we were rolling along through a drift of rails and
mist.  Suddenly the world was white with moonshine.  The gunboat
came out as a long dark shape wallowing on the water to the east.
<P>
She sighted the Maud Mary at once, and fired some sort of popgun
to arrest us.
<P>
The mate turned to me.
<P>
"Shall I tell the captain?" 
<P>
"The captain be damned" said I, and we let him sleep through two
hours of chase till a rainstorm swallowed us up.  Then we
changed our course and sailed right across them, and by morning
only her smoke was showing.
<P>
We were clear of Africa--and with the booty aboard I did not see
what stood between us and home.
<P>
For the first time since I had fallen sick in the Thames my
spirits rose.  I was sea-sick and physically disgusted, of
course, but I felt kindly in spite of my qualms.  So far as I
could calculate then the situation was saved.  I saw myself
returning triumphantly into the Thames, and nothing on earth to
prevent old Capern's Perfect Filament going on the market in
fortnight.  I had the monopoly of electric lamps beneath  my
feet.
<P>
I was released from the spell of that bloodstained black body all
mixed up with grey-black mud.  I was going back to baths and
decent food and aeronautics and Beatrice.  I was going back to
Beatrice and my real life again--out of this well into which I
had fallen.  It would have needed something more than
sea-sickness and quap fever to prevent my spirits rising.
<P>
I told the captain that I agreed with him that the British were
the scum of Europe, the westward drift of all the people, a
disgusting rabble, and I lost three pounds by attenuated retail
to Pollack at ha'penny nap and euchre.
<P>
And then you know, as we got out into the Atlantic this side of
Cape Verde, the ship began to go to pieces. I don't pretend for
one moment to understand what happened.  But I think
Greiffenhagen's recent work on the effects of radium upon
ligneous tissue does rather carry out my idea that emanations
from quap have rapid rotting effect upon woody fibre.
<P>
From the first there had been a different feel about the ship,
and as the big winds and waves began to strain her she commenced
leaking.  Soon she was leaking--not at any particular point, but
everywhere.  She did not spring a leak, I mean, but water came in
first of all near the decaying edges of her planks, and then
through them.
<P>
I firmly believe the water came through the wood.  First it began
to ooze, then to trickle.  It was like trying to carry moist
sugar in a thin paper bag.  Soon we were taking in water as
though we had opened a door in her bottom.
<P>
Once it began, the thing went ahead beyond all fighting.  For a
day or so we did our best, and I can still remember in my
limbs and back the pumping--the fatigue  in my arms and the
memory of a clear little dribble of water that jerked as one
pumped, and of knocking off and the being awakened to go on
again, and of fatigue piling up upon fatigue.  At last we ceased
to think of anything but pumping; one became a thing of torment
enchanted, doomed to pump for ever.  I still remember it as pure
relief when at last Pollack came to me pipe in mouth.
<P>
"The captain says the damned thing's going down right now;' he
remarked, chewing his mouthpiece. "Eh?" 
<P>
"Good idea!" I said.  "One can't go on pumping for ever."  
<P>
And without hurry or alacrity, sullenly and wearily we got into
the boats and pulled away from the Maud Mary until we were
clear of her, and then we stayed resting on our oars, motionless
upon a glassy sea, waiting  for her to sink.  We were all silent,
even the captain  was silent until she went down.  And then he
spoke quite mildly in an undertone.
<P>
"Dat is the first ship I haf ever lost.... And it was not a fair
game! It wass not a cargo any man should take.  No!" 
<P>
I stared at the slow eddies that circled above the departed 
Maud Mary, and the last chance of Business Organisations.  I
felt weary beyond emotion.  I thought of my heroics to Beatrice
and my uncle, of my prompt "I'LL go," and of all the ineffectual
months I had spent after this headlong decision.  I was moved to
laughter at myself and fate.
<P>
But the captain and the men did not laugh.  The men scowled at me
and rubbed their sore and blistered hands, and set themselves to
row....
<P>
As all the world knows we were picked up by the Union Castle
liner, Portland Castle.
<P>
The hairdresser aboard was a wonderful man, and he even
improvised me a dress suit, and produced a clean shirt and warm
underclothing.  I had a hot bath, and dressed and dined and drank
a bottle of Burgundy.
<P>
"Now," I said, "are there any newspapers?  I want to know what's
been happening in the world."  
<P>
My steward gave me what he had, but I landed at Plymouth still
largely ignorant of the course of events.  I shook off Pollack,
and left the captain and mate in an hotel, and the men in a
Sailor's Home until I could send to pay them off, and I made my
way to the station.
<P>
The newspapers I bought, the placards I saw, all England indeed
resounded to my uncle's bankruptcy.
