<p>Wonderfully handsome was Lightfoot the Deer as he stood in the
little opening by the pond of Paddy the Beaver, his head thrown
back proudly, as he received the congratulations of his neighbors
of the Green Forest who had seen him win the great fight with
the big stranger who had come down from the Great Mountain. To
beautiful Miss Daintyfoot, peeping out from the thicket where
she had hidden to watch the great fight, Lightfoot was the most
wonderful person in all the Great World. She adored him, which
means that she loved him just as much as it was possible for her
to love.</p>

<p>But Lightfoot didn't know this. In fact, he didn't know that
Miss Daintyfoot was there. His one thought had been to drive out
of the Green Forest the big stranger who had come down from the
Great Mountain. He had been jealous of that big stranger, though
he hadn't known that he was jealous. The real cause of his anger
and desire to fight had been the fear that the big stranger would
find Miss Daintyfoot and take her away. Of course this was nothing
but jealousy.</p>

<p>Now that the great fight was over, and he knew that the big stranger
was hurrying back to the Great Mountain, all Lightfoot's anger
melted away. In its place was a great longing to find Miss Daintyfoot.
His great eyes became once more soft and beautiful. In them was
a look of wistfulness. Lightfoot walked down to the edge of the
water and drank, for he was very, very thirsty. Then he turned,
intending to take up once more his search for beautiful Miss Daintyfoot.</p>

<p>When he turned he faced the thicket in which Miss Daintyfoot
was hiding. His keen eyes caught a little movement of the branches.
A beautiful head was slowly thrust out, and Lightfoot gazed again
into a pair of soft eyes which he was sure were the most beautiful
eyes in all the Great World. He wondered if she would disappear
and run away as she had the last time he saw her.</p>

<p>He took a step or two forward. The beautiful head was withdrawn.
Lightfoot's heart sank. Then he bounded forward into that thicket.
He more than half expected to find no one there, but when he entered
that thicket he received the most wonderful surprise in all his
life. There stood Miss Daintyfoot, timid, bashful, but with a
look in her eyes which Lightfoot could not mistake. In that instant
Lightfoot understood the meaning of that longing which had kept
him hunting for her and of the rage which had filled him when
he had discovered the presence of the big stranger from the Great
Mountain. It was love. Lightfoot knew that he loved Miss Daintyfoot
and, looking into her soft, gentle eyes, he knew that Miss Daintyfoot
loved him.</p>
