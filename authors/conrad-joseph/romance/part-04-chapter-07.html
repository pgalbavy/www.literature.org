<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>How often the activity of our life is the least real part of
it! Life, looked upon as a whole, presents itself to my fancy
as a pursuit with open arms of a winged and magnificent dream,
hovering just over our heads and casting its glory upon our hopes.
It is in this simple vision, which is one and enduring, and not
in the changing facts, that we must look for meaning and for truth.
The three quiet days we spent together on board the <em>Lion</em>
remain to me memorable and full of import, eventless and containing
the very quintessence of existence. We shared the sunshine, always
together, very close, turning hand in hand to the sea, whose unstained
blueness continued under our feet the blue above our heads, as
though we had been snatched up into the sky. The insignificant
words we exchanged seemed informed by a sustaining certitude and
an admirable gravity, as though there had been some quality of
unerring wisdom in the blind love of man and woman. From the inexhaustible
treasure of her feelings she drew words, glances, gestures that
appeased every uneasiness of my heart. In some brief moment of
illumination whose advent my man's eyes had utterly missed, she
had learned all at once everything there was to know. She knew.
She no longer needed to survey my actions, my words, my thoughts;
but she accorded me the sincere flattery of spell-bound attention,
and it was made intoxicating by her smile. In those short days
of a pause, when, like a swimmer turning on his back, we lived
in the trustful confidence of the sustaining depths, instead of
struggling with the agitation of the surface&mdash;in these days we
had the time to look at each other profoundly; and I saw her smile
come back again a little changed, more meaning and a little less
mirthful, as if her lips had been made stiff by sorrow. But she
was young; and youth, the time of softness, of tenderness, of
enthusiasm, and of pity, presents a surface as hard as marble
to the finality of death.</p>

<p>Breathing side by side, drinking in the sunshine, and talking
of ourselves not at all, but casting the sense of our love like
a magnificent garment over the wide significance of a world already
conquered, we could not help being made aware of the currents
of excitement and sympathy that converged upon our essential isolation
from the life of the ship. It was the excitement of the adventure
brewing for our drinking according to Sebright's recipe. People
approached us&mdash;spoke to us. We attended to them as if called down
from an elevation; we were aware of the kind tone; and, remaining
indistinct, they retreated, leaving us free to regain the heights
of the lovers' paradise&mdash;a region of tender whispers and intense
silences. Suddenly there would be a short, throaty laugh behind
our backs, and Williams would begin, "I say, Kemp; do you call
to mind so-and-so?" Invariably some planter or merchant in Jamaica.
I never could.</p>

<p>Williams would grunt, "No? I wonder how you passed your time
away these two years or more. The place isn't that big." His purpose
was to cheer me up by some gossip, if only he could find a common
acquaintance to talk over. I believe he thought me a queer fish.
He told me once that everybody he knew in Jamaica had that precise
opinion of me. Then with à chuckle and muttering, "Warrants&mdash;assault
&mdash;Top&mdash;nambo&mdash;ha, ha!" he would leave us to ourselves, and
continue his waddle up and down the poop. He wore loose silk trousers,
and the round legs inside moved like a contrivance made out of
two gate-posts.</p>

<p>He was absurd. They all were that before our sweet reasonableness.
But this atmosphere, full of interest and good will, was good
to breathe. The very steward&mdash;the same who had been hiding in
the lazarette during the fight&mdash;a hunted creature, displaying
the most insignificant anatomy ever inhabited by a quailing spirit,
devoted himself to the manufacture of strange cakes, which at
tea-time he would deposit smoking hot in front of Seraphina's
place. After each such exploit, he appeared amazed at his audacity
in taking so much upon himself. The carpenter took more than a
day, tinkering at an old ship's boat. He was a Shetlander&mdash;a sort
of shaggy hyperborean giant with a forbidding face, an appraising,
contemplative manner, and many nails in his mouth. At last the
time came when he, too, approached our oblivion from behind, with
a large hammer in his hand; but instead of braining us with one
sweep of his mighty arm, he remarked simply in uncouth accents,
"There now; I am thinking she will do well for what ye want her.
I can do no more for ye."</p>

<p>We turned round, arm-in-arm, to look at the boat. There she was,
lying careened on the deck, with patched sides, in a belt of chips,
shavings, and sawdust; a few pensive sailors stood about, gazing
down at her with serious eyes. Sebright, bent double, circled
slowly on a prowl of minute inspection. Suddenly straightening
himself up, he pronounced a curt "She'll do"; and, without looking
at us at all, went off busily with his rapid stride.</p>

<p>A light sigh floated down upon our heads. Williams and his wife
appeared on the poop above us like an allegorical couple of repletion
and starvation, conceived in a fantastic vein on a balcony. A
cigar smouldered in his stumpy red fingers. She had slipped a
hand under his arm, as she would always do the moment they came
near each other. She never looked more wasted and old-maidish
than when thus affirming her wifely rights. But her eyes were
motherly.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dears!" (She usually addressed Seraphina as "miss," and
myself as "young sir.") "Ah, my dears! It seems so heartless to
be sending you off in such a small boat, even for your own good."</p>

<p>"Never fear, Mary. Repaired. Carry six comfortably," reassured
Williams in a tremendous mutter, like a bull.</p>

<p>"But why can't you give them one of the others, Owen? That big
one there?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Mary. Never see boat again. Wouldn't grudge it. Only
Sebright is quite right. Didn't you hear what Sebright said? Very
sensible. Ask Sebright. He will explain to you again."</p>

<p>It was Sebright, with his asperity and his tact, with fits of
brusqueness subdued by an almost affectionate contempt, who conducted
all their affairs, as I have seen a trustworthy and experienced
old nurse rule the infinite perplexities of a room full of children.
His clear-sightedness and mental grip seemed independent of age
and experience, like the ability of genius. He had an imaginative
eye for detail, and, starting from a mere hint, would go scheming
onwards with astonishing precision. His plan, to which we were
committed&mdash;committed helplessly and without resistance&mdash;was based
upon the necessity of our leaving the ship.</p>

<p>He had developed it to me that evening, in the cabin, directly
Castro had gone out. He had already got Williams and his wife
to share his view of our situation. He began by laying it down
that in every desperate position there was a loophole for escape.
Like other great men, he was conscious of his ability, and was
inclined to theorize at large for a while. You had to accept the
situation, go with it in a measure, and as you had walked into
trouble with your eyes shut, you had only to continue with your
eyes open. Time was the only thing that could defeat one. If you
had no time, he admitted, you were at a dead wall. In this case
he judged there would be time, because O'Brien, warned already,
would sit tight for a few days, being sure to get hold of us directly
the <em>Lion</em> came into port. It was only if the <em>Lion</em>
failed to turn up within a reasonable term in Havana, that he
would take fright, and take measures to hunt her up at sea. But
I might rest assured that the <em>Lion</em> was going to Havana
as fast as the winds would allow her.</p>

<p>What was, then, the situation? he continued, looking at me piercingly
above Williams' cropped head. I had run away for dear life from
Cuba (taking with me what was best in it, to be sure, he interjected,
with a faint smile towards Seraphina). I had no money, no friends
(except my friends in this cabin, he was good enough to say);
warrants out against me in Jamaica; no means to get to England;
no safety in the ship. It was no use shirking that little fact.
We must leave the <em>Lion</em>. This was a hopeless enough position.
But it was hopeless only because it was not looked upon in the
right way. We assumed that we had to leave her forever, while
the whole secret of the trick was in this, that we need only leave
her for a time. After O'Brien's myrmidons had gone through her,
and had been hooted away empty-handed, she became again, if not
absolutely safe, then at least possible&mdash;the only possible refuge
for us&mdash;the only decent means of reaching England together, where,
he understood, our trouble would cease. Williams nodded approval
heavily.</p>

<p>"The friends of Miss Riego would be glad to know she had made
the passage under the care of a respectable married lady," Sebright
explained, in that imperturbable manner of his, which reflected
faintly all his inner moods&mdash;whether of recklessness, of jocularity
or anxiety&mdash;and often his underlying scorn. His gravity grew perfectly
portentous. "Mrs. Williams," he continued, "was, of course, very
anxious to do her part creditably. As it happened, the <em>Lion</em>
was chartered for London this voyage; and notwithstanding her
natural desire to rejoin, as soon as possible, her home and her
aged uncle in Bristol, she intended to go with the young lady
in a hackney coach to the very door."</p>

<p>I had previously told them that the lately appointed Spanish
ambassador in London was a relation of the Riegos, and personally
acquainted with Seraphina, who, nearly two years before, had been
on a short visit to Spain, and had lived for some months with
his family <em>in</em> Madrid, I believe. No trouble or difficulty
was to be apprehended as to proper recognition, or in the mattei
of rights and inheritance, and so on. The ambassador would make
that his own affair. And for the rest I trusted the decision of
her character and the strength of her affection. I was not afraid
she would let any one talk her out of an engagement, the dying
wish of her nearest kinsman, sealed, as it were, with the blood
of her father. This matter of temporary absence from the <em>Lion</em>,
however, seemed to present an insuperable difficulty. We could
not, obviously, be left for days floating in an open boat outside
Havana harbour, waiting till the ship came out to pick us up.
Sebright himself admitted that at first he did not see how it
could be contrived. He didn't see at all. He thought and thought.
It was enough to sicken one of every sort of thinking. Then, suddenly,
the few words Castro had let drop about the sugar estate and the
relay of mules came into his head&mdash;providentially, as Mrs. Williams
would say. He fancied that the primitive and grandiose manner
for a gentleman to keep a relay of mules&mdash;any amount of mules&mdash;in
case he should want to send a letter or two, caused the circumstance
to stick in his mind. At once he had "our little <em>hidalgo</em>"
in, and put him through an examination.</p>

<p>"He turned fairly sulky, and tried constantly to break out against
you, till Dona Seraphina here gave him a good talking to," Sebright
said.</p>

<p>Otherwise it was most satisfactory. The place was accessible
from the sea through a narrow inlet, opening into a small, perfectly
sheltered basin at the back of the sand-dunes. The little river
watering the estate emptied itself into that basin. One could
land from a boat there, he understood, as if in a dock&mdash;and it
was the very devil if I and Miss Riego could not lie hidden for
a few days on her own property, the more so that, as it came out
in the course of the discussion, while I had "rushed out to look
at the sunset," that the manager, or whatever they called him&mdash;the
fellow in charge&mdash;was the husband of Dona Seraphina's old nurse-woman.
Of course, it behoved us to make as little fuss as possible&mdash;try
to reach the house along by-paths early in the morning, when all
the slaves would be out at work in the fields. Castro, who professed
to know the locality very well indeed, would be of use. Meantime,
the <em>Lion</em> would make her way to Havana, as if nothing
was the matter. No doubt all sorts of confounded <em>alguazils</em>
and custom-house hounds would be ready to swarm on board in full
cry. They would be made very welcome. Any strangers on board?
Certainly not. Why should there be?... Rio Medio? What about Rio
Medio? Hadn't been within miles and miles of Rio Medio; tried
this trip to beat up well clear of the coast. Search the ship?
With pleasure&mdash;every nook and cranny. He didn't suppose they would
have the cheek to talk of the pirates; but if they did venture&mdash;what
then? Pirates? That's very serious and dishonourable to the power
of Spain. Personally, had seen nothing of pirates. Thought they
had all been captured and hanged quite lately. Rumours of the
<em>Lion</em> having been attacked obviously untrue. Some other
ship, perhaps.... That was the line to take. If it didn't convince
them, it would puzzle them altogether. Of course, Captain Williams,
in his great regard for me, had abandoned the intention of making
an affair of state of the outrage committed on his ship. He would
not lodge any complaint in Havana&mdash;nothing at all. The old women
of the Admiralty wouldn't be made to sit up this time. No report
would be sent to the admiral either. Only, if the ship were interfered
with, and bothered under any pretence whatever, once they had
been given every facility to have one good look everywhere, the
admiral would be asked to stop it. And the Spanish authorities
would have not a leg to stand on either, for this simple reason,
that they could not very well own to the sources of their information.
Meantime, all hands on board the <em>Lion</em> had to be taken
into confidence; that could not be avoided. He, Sebright, answered
for their discretion while sober, anyhow; and he promised me that
no leave or money would be given in Havana, for fear they should
get on a spree, and let out something in the grogshops on shore.
We all knew what a sailor-man was after a glass or two. So that
was settled. Now, as to our rejoining the <em>Lion</em>. This,
of necessity, must be left to me. Counting from the time we parted
from her to land on the coast, the <em>Lion</em> would remain
in Havana sixteen days; and if we did not turn up in that time,
and the cargo was all on board by then, Captain Williams would
try to remain in harbour on one pretence or another a few days
longer. But sixteen days should be ample, and it was even better
not to hurry up too much. To arrive on the fifteenth day would
be the safest proceeding in a way, but for the cutting of the
thing too fine, perhaps. With all these mules at our disposal,
Sebright didn't see why we should not make our way by land, pass
through the town at night, or in the earliest morning, and go
straight on board the <em>Lion</em>&mdash;perhaps use some sort of
disguise. He couldn't say. He was out of it there. Blackened faces
or something. Anyway, we would be looked out for on board night
and day.</p>

<p>Later on, however, we had learned from Castro that the estate
possessed a sailing craft of about twenty tons, which made frequent
trips to Havana. These sugar <em>droghers</em> belonging to the
plantations (every estate on the coast had one or more) went in
and out of the harbour without being taken much notice of. Sometimes
the battery at the water's edge on the north side or a custom-house
guard would hail them, but not often&mdash;and even then only to ask
the name, where from, and for the number of sugar-hogsheads on
board. "By heavens! That's the very thing!"  rejoiced Sebright.
And it was agreed that this would be our best way. We should time
our arrival for early morning, or else at dusk. The craft that
brought us in should be made, by a piece of unskillful management,
to fall aboard the <em>Lion</em>, and remain alongside long enough
to give us time to sneak in through an open deck-port.</p>

<p>The whole occurrence must be so contrived as to wear the appearance
of a pure accident to the onlookers, should there be any. Shouting
and an exchange of abuse on both parts should sound very true.
Then the <em>drogher</em>, getting herself clear, would proceed
innocently to the custom-house steps, where all such coasters
had to report themselves on arrival. "Never fear. We shall put
in some loud and scandalous cursing,"  Sebright assured me. "The
boys will greatly enjoy that part, I dare say."</p>

<p>Remained to consider the purpose of the schooner that had come
out of Rio Medio to hang on our skirts. It was doubtful whether
it was in our power to shake her off. Sebright was full of admiration
for her sailing qualities, coupled with infinite contempt for
the "lubberly gang on board."</p>

<p>"If I had the handling of her, now," he said, "I would take my
position as near as I liked, and stick there. It seems almost
as if she would do it of herself, if those imbeciles would only
let her have her own way. I never yet saw a Spaniard, good or
bad, that was anything of a sailor. As it is, we may maintain
a distance that would make it difficult for them to see what we
are about. And if not, then&mdash;why, you must take your leave of
us at night."</p>

<p>He didn't know that, but for the dismalness of such a departure,
it were not just as well. Who could tell what eyes might be watching
on shore?</p>

<p>"You know I never pretended my plan was quite safe. But have
you got another?"</p>

<p>I made no answer, because I had no other, and could not think
of one. Incredible as it may appear, not only my heart, but my
mind, also, in the awakened comprehension of my love, refused
to grapple with difficulties. My thoughts raced ahead of ships
and pursuing men, into a dream of cloudless felicity without end.
And I don't think Sebright expected any suggestion from me. This
took place during one of our busy talks&mdash;only he and <em>I&mdash;</em>alone
in his cabin. He had been washing his hands, making ready for
tea.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said, turning full on me, and wiping his fingers
carefully with a coarse towel&mdash;"do you know, I shouldn't wonder
if that schooner were not keeping watch on us, in suspicion of
just some such move on our part. 'Tis extraordinary how clever
the greatest fool may show himself sometimes. Only, with their
lubberly Spanish seamanship, they would expect us, probably, to
make a whole ceremony of your landing: ship hove to for hours
close in shore, a boat going off to land and returning, and all
such pother. 'We are sure to see their little show,' they think
to themselves. Eh? What? Whereas we shall keep well clear of the
land when the time comes, and drop you in the dark without as
much check on our way as there is in the wink of an eye. Hey?...
Mind, Mr. Kemp, you take the boat out of sight up that little
river, in case they should have a fancy, as they go along after
us, to peep into that inlet. As I have said it wouldn't do to
trust too much in any fool's folly."</p>

<p>And now the time was approaching; the time to awake and step
forth out of the temple of sunshine and love&mdash;of whispers and
silences. It had come. The night before both Williams and Sebright
had been on deck, working the ship with an anxious care to take
the utmost advantage of every favouring flaw in the contrary breeze.
In the morning I was told there was a norther brewing. A norther
is a tempestuous gale. I saw no signs of it. The realm of the
sun, like the vanished one of the stars, appeared to my senses
to be profoundly asleep, and breathing as gently as a child upon
the ship. The <em>Lion</em>, too, seemed to lie wrapped in an
enchanted slumber from the water-line to the tops of her upright
masts. And yet she moved with the breath of the world, but so
imperceptibly that it was the coast that seemed to be nearing
her like a line of low vapour blown along the water. Between Williams
and Sebright Castro pointed with his one arm, and a splutter of
guttural syllables fell like hail out of his lips. The other two
seemed incredulous. He stamped with both his feet angrily. Finally
they went below together, to look at the chart, I suppose. They
came up again very fast, one after another, and stood in a row,
looking on as before. Three more dissimilar human beings it would
have been difficult to imagine.</p>

<p>Dazzling white patches, about the size of a man's hand, came
out between sky and water. They grew in width, and ran together
with a hummocky outline into a continuous undulation of sand-dunes.
Here and there this rampart had a gap like a breach made by guns.
Mrs. Williams, behind me, blew her nose faintly; her eyes were
red, but she did not look at us. No eye was turned our way, and
the spell of the coast was on her, too. A low, dark headland broke
out to view through the dunes, and stood there conspicuous amongst
the heaps of dazzling sand, like a small man frowning. A voice
on deck pronounced:</p>

<p>"That's right. Here's his landmark. The fellow knew very well
what he was talking about."</p>

<p>It was Sebright's voice, and Castro, strolling away triumphantly,
affected to turn his back on the land. He had recognized the formation
of the coast about the inlet long before anybody else could distinguish
the details. His word had been doubted. He was offended, and passed
us by, wrapping himself up closely. One of Seraphina's locks blew
against my cheek, and this last effort of the breeze remained
snared in the silken meshes of her hair.</p>

<p>"There's not enough wind to fill the sail of a toy boat," grumbled
Sebright; "and you can't pull this heavy gig ashore with only
that one-armed man at the other oar." He was sorry he could not
send us off with four good rowers. The norther might be coming
on before they could return to the ship, and&mdash;apart from the presence
of four English sailors on the coast being sure to get talked
about&mdash;there was the difficulty in getting them back on board
in Havana. We could, no doubt, smuggle ourselves in; but six people
would make too much of a show. On the other hand, the absence
of four men out of the ship's company could not be accounted for
very well to the authorities. "We can't say they all died, and
we threw them overboard. It would be too startling. No; you must
go alone, and leave us at the first breath of wind; and that,
I fear, 'll be the first of the norther, too."</p>

<p>He threw his head back, and hailed, "Do you see anything of that
schooner from aloft there?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of her, sir," answered a man perched, with dangling
feet, astride the very end of the topsail yard-arm. He paused,
scanned the space from under the flat of his hand, and added,
shouting with deliberation, "There's&mdash;a&mdash;haze&mdash;to seaward, sir."
The ship, with her decks sprinkled over with men in twos and threes,
sent up to his ears a murmur of satisfaction.</p>

<p>If we could not see her, she could not see us. This was a favourable
circumstance. To the infinite gratification of everyone on board,
it had been discovered at daylight that the schooner had lost
touch with us during the hours of darkness&mdash;either through unskillful
handling, or from some accidental disadvantage of the variable
wind. I had been informed of it, directly I showed myself on deck
in the morning, by several men who had radiant grins, as if some
great piece of luck had befallen them, one and all. They shared
their unflagging attention between the land and the sea-horizon,
pointing out to each other, with their tattooed arms, the features
of the coast, nodding knowingly towards the open. At midday most
of them brought out their dinners on deck, and could be seen forward,
each with a tin plate in the left hand, gesticulating amicably
with clasp knives. A small white handkerchief hung from Mrs. Williams'
fingers, and now and then she touched her eyes lightly, one after
the other. Her husband and Sebright, with a grave mien, stamped
busily around the binnacle aft, changing places, making way for
each other, stooping in turns to glance carefully along the compass
card at the low bluff, like two gunners laying a piece of heavy
ordnance for an important shot. The steward, emerging out of the
companion, rang a handbell violently, and remained scared at the
failure of that appeal. After waiting for a moment, he produced
a further feeble tinkle, and sank down out of sight, with resignation.</p>

<p>A white sun, as if blazing with the pallor of fury, swung past
the zenith in a profound and universal stillness. There was not
a wrinkle on the sea; it presented a lustrous and glittering level,
like the polished facet of a gem. In the cabin we sat down to
the meal, not even pretending a desire to eat, exchanging vague
phrases, hanging our heads over the empty plates. But the regular
footsteps of the boatswain left in charge hesitated, stopped near
the skylight. He said in an imperfectly assured voice, "Seems
as if there was a steadier draught coming now." At this we rose
from the table impetuously, as though he had shouted an alarm
of fire, and Mrs. Williams, with a little cry, ran round to Seraphina.
Leaving the two women locked in a silent embrace, the captain,
Sebright and myself hurried out on deck.</p>

<p>Every man in the ship had done the same. Even the shiny black
cook had come out of his galley, and was already comfortably seated
on the rail, baring his white teeth to the sunshine.</p>

<p>"Just about enough to blow out a farthing dip," said Sebright,
in a disappointed mutter.</p>

<p>He thought, however, we had better not wait for more. There would
be too much presently. Some sailors hauled the boat alongside,
the rest lined the rail as for a naval spectacle, and Williams
stared blankly. We were waiting for Seraphina, who appeared, attended
by Mrs. Williams, looking more kind, bloodless, and ascetic than
ever. But my girl's cheeks glowed; her eyes sparkled audaciously.
She had done up her hair in some way that made it fit her head
like a cap. It became her exceedingly, and the decision of her
movements, the white serenity of her brow, dazzled me as if I
had never seen her before. She seemed less childlike, older, ripe
for this adventure in a new development of strength and courage.
She inclined her head slowly at the gaping sailors, who had taken
their caps off.</p>

<p>As soon as she appeared, Castro, who had been leaning against
the bulwark, started up, and with a muttered "<em>Adios, Señores</em>,"
went down the overside ladder and ensconced himself in the bow
of the boat. The leave-taking was hurried over. Williams gave
no sign of feeling, except, perhaps, for the greater intensity
of his stare, which passed beyond our shoulders in the very act
of handshaking. Sebright helped Seraphina down into the boat,
and ran up again nimbly. Mrs. Williams, with her slim hand held
in both mine, uttered a few incoherent words&mdash;about men's promises
and the happiness of women, as I thought; but, truth to say, my
own suppressed excitement was too considerable for close attention.
I only knew that I had given her my confidence, that complete
and utter confidence which neither wisdom nor power alone, can
command. And, suddenly, it occurred to me that the heiress of
a splendid name and fortune, down in the boat there, had no better
friend in the world than this woman, who had come to us out of
the waste of the sea, opening her simple heart to our need, like
a pious and naive hermit in a wilderness throwing open the door
of his cell to strange wayfarers.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Williams," I stammered. "If we&mdash;if <em>I&mdash;</em>there's
no saying what may happen to any of us. If she ever comes to you&mdash;if
she ever is in want of help...."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Always, always&mdash;like my own daughter."</p>

<p>And the good woman broke down, as if, indeed, I were taking her
own daughter away.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Mary!" Williams advanced, muttering tremendously.
"They are not going round the world. Dare say get ashore in time
for supper."</p>

<p>He stared through her without expression, as if she had been
thin air, but she seized his arm, of course, and he gave me, then,
an amazingly rapid wink which, I suppose, meant that I should
go....</p>

<p>"All right there?" asked Sebright from above, as soon as I had
taken my seat in the stern sheets by the side of Seraphina. He
was standing on the poop deck ready with a sign for letting go
the end of our painter on deck; but before I could answer in the
affirmative, Castro, ensconced forward under his hat, drew his
ready blade across the rope, as it were a throat.</p>

<p>At once a narrow strip of water opened between the boat and the
ship, and our long-prepared departure, hastened thus by half a
second, seemed to strike everybody dumb with surprise, as if we
had taken wings to ourselves to fly away. Hastily I grasped the
tiller to give the boat a sheer, and heard a sort of loud gasp
in the air above. A row of heads, posed on chins all along the
rail, stared after us with unanimous fixity. Mrs. Williams averted
her face on her husband's shoulder. Behind the couple, Sebright
raised his cap gravely.</p>

<p>Our little sail filled to a breeze which was much too feeble
to produce a perceptible effect on the ship, and we left behind
us her towering form, as one recedes from a tall white spire on
a plain. I laid the boat's head straight for the dwarf headland,
marking the mouth of the inlet on the interminable range of sand-dunes.
We drove on with a smart ripple, but before we felt sufficiently
settled to exchange a few words the animated sound languished
suddenly, paused altogether, and, with a renewed murmur under
our feet seemed to lose itself below the glassy waters.</p>
