'There is a tide in the affairs of men<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which,&mdash;taken at the flood,'&mdash;you know the rest,<br/>
&nbsp;And most of us have found it now and then;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least we think so, though but few have guess'd<br/>
&nbsp;The moment, till too late to come again.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no doubt every thing is for the best&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;Of which the surest sign is in the end:<br/>
&nbsp;When things are at the worst they sometimes mend.

</p>
<p>
There is a tide in the affairs of women<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, taken at the flood, leads<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;God knows where:<br/>
Those navigators must be able seamen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose charts lay down its current to a hair;<br/>
Not all the reveries of Jacob Behmen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With its strange whirls and eddies can compare:<br/>
Men with their heads reflect on this and that&mdash;<br/>
But women with their hearts on heaven knows what!

</p>
<p>
And yet a headlong, headstrong, downright she,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Young, beautiful, and daring&mdash;who would risk<br/>
A throne, the world, the universe, to be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beloved in her own way, and rather whisk<br/>
The stars from out the sky, than not be free<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As are the billows when the breeze is brisk&mdash;<br/>
Though such a she 's a devil (if that there be one),<br/>
Yet she would make full many a Manichean.

</p>
<p>
Thrones, worlds, et cetera, are so oft upset<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By commonest ambition, that when passion<br/>
O'erthrows the same, we readily forget,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or at the least forgive, the loving rash one.<br/>
If Antony be well remember'd yet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis not his conquests keep his name in fashion,<br/>
But Actium, lost for Cleopatra's eyes,<br/>
Outbalances all Caesar's victories.

</p>
<p>
He died at fifty for a queen of forty;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish their years had been fifteen and twenty,<br/>
For then wealth, kingdoms, worlds are but a sport<br/>
&mdash;I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember when, though I had no great plenty<br/>
Of worlds to lose, yet still, to pay my court, I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave what I had&mdash;a heart: as the world went, I<br/>
Gave what was worth a world; for worlds could never<br/>
Restore me those pure feelings, gone forever.

</p>
<p>
'Twas the boy's 'mite,' and, like the 'widow's,' may<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps be weigh'd hereafter, if not now;<br/>
But whether such things do or do not weigh,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All who have loved, or love, will still allow<br/>
Life has nought like it. God is love, they say,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Love 's a god, or was before the brow<br/>
Of earth was wrinkled by the sins and tears<br/>
Of&mdash;but Chronology best knows the years.

</p>
<p>
We left our hero and third heroine in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of state more awkward than uncommon,<br/>
For gentlemen must sometimes risk their skin<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For that sad tempter, a forbidden woman:<br/>
Sultans too much abhor this sort of sin,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And don't agree at all with the wise Roman,<br/>
Heroic, stoic Cato, the sententious,<br/>
Who lent his lady to his friend Hortensius.

</p>
<p>
I know Gulbeyaz was extremely wrong;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I own it, I deplore it, I condemn it;<br/>
But I detest all fiction even in song,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so must tell the truth, howe'er you blame it.<br/>
Her reason being weak, her passions strong,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought that her lord's heart (even could she claim it)<br/>
Was scarce enough; for he had fifty-nine<br/>
Years, and a fifteen-hundredth concubine.

</p>
<p>
I am not, like Cassio, 'an arithmetician,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But by 'the bookish theoric' it appears,<br/>
If 'tis summ'd up with feminine precision,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That, adding to the account his Highness' years,<br/>
The fair Sultana err'd from inanition;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For, were the Sultan just to all his dears,<br/>
She could but claim the fifteen-hundredth part<br/>
Of what should be monopoly&mdash;the heart.

</p>
<p>
It is observed that ladies are litigious<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon all legal objects of possession,<br/>
And not the least so when they are religious,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which doubles what they think of the transgression:<br/>
With suits and prosecutions they besiege us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As the tribunals show through many a session,<br/>
When they suspect that any one goes shares<br/>
In that to which the law makes them sole heirs.

</p>
<p>
Now, if this holds good in a Christian land,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The heathen also, though with lesser latitude,<br/>
Are apt to carry things with a high hand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And take what kings call 'an imposing attitude,'<br/>
And for their rights connubial make a stand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When their liege husbands treat them with ingratitude:<br/>
And as four wives must have quadruple claims,<br/>
The Tigris hath its jealousies like Thames.

</p>
<p>
Gulbeyaz was the fourth, and (as I said)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The favourite; but what 's favour amongst four?<br/>
Polygamy may well be held in dread,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only as a sin, but as a bore:<br/>
Most wise men, with one moderate woman wed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will scarcely find philosophy for more;<br/>
And all (except Mahometans) forbear<br/>
To make the nuptial couch a 'Bed of Ware.'

</p>
<p>
His Highness, the sublimest of mankind,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So styled according to the usual forms<br/>
Of every monarch, till they are consign'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To those sad hungry jacobins the worms,<br/>
Who on the very loftiest kings have dined,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His Highness gazed upon Gulbeyaz' charms,<br/>
Expecting all the welcome of a lover<br/>
(A 'Highland welcome' all the wide world over).

</p>
<p>
Now here we should distinguish; for howe'er<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kisses, sweet words, embraces, and all that,<br/>
May look like what is&mdash;neither here nor there,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They are put on as easily as a hat,<br/>
Or rather bonnet, which the fair sex wear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Trimm'd either heads or hearts to decorate,<br/>
Which form an ornament, but no more part<br/>
Of heads, than their caresses of the heart.

</p>
<p>
A slight blush, a soft tremor, a calm kind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of gentle feminine delight, and shown<br/>
More in the eyelids than the eyes, resign'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather to hide what pleases most unknown,<br/>
Are the best tokens (to a modest mind)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of love, when seated on his loveliest throne,<br/>
A sincere woman's breast,&mdash;for over-warm<br/>
Or over-cold annihilates the charm.

</p>
<p>
For over-warmth, if false, is worse than truth;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If true, 'tis no great lease of its own fire;<br/>
For no one, save in very early youth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would like (I think) to trust all to desire,<br/>
Which is but a precarious bond, in sooth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And apt to be transferr'd to the first buyer<br/>
At a sad discount: while your over chilly<br/>
Women, on t' other hand, seem somewhat silly.

</p>
<p>
That is, we cannot pardon their bad taste,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For so it seems to lovers swift or slow,<br/>
Who fain would have a mutual flame confess'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And see a sentimental passion glow,<br/>
Even were St. Francis' paramour their guest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In his monastic concubine of snow;&mdash;<br/>
In short, the maxim for the amorous tribe is<br/>
Horatian, 'Medio tu tutissimus ibis.'

</p>
<p>
The 'tu' 's too much,&mdash;but let it stand,&mdash;the verse<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Requires it, that 's to say, the English rhyme,<br/>
And not the pink of old hexameters;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But, after all, there 's neither tune nor time<br/>
In the last line, which cannot well be worse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And was thrust in to close the octave's chime:<br/>
I own no prosody can ever rate it<br/>
As a rule, but truth may, if you translate it.

</p>
<p>
If fair Gulbeyaz overdid her part,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not&mdash;it succeeded, and success<br/>
Is much in most things, not less in the heart<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than other articles of female dress.<br/>
Self-love in man, too, beats all female art;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They lie, we lie, all lie, but love no less;<br/>
And no one virtue yet, except starvation,<br/>
Could stop that worst of vices&mdash;propagation.

</p>
<p>
We leave this royal couple to repose:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A bed is not a throne, and they may sleep,<br/>
Whate'er their dreams be, if of joys or woes:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet disappointed joys are woes as deep<br/>
As any man's day mixture undergoes.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our least of sorrows are such as we weep;<br/>
'Tis the vile daily drop on drop which wears<br/>
The soul out (like the stone) with petty cares.

</p>
<p>
A scolding wife, a sullen son, a bill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To pay, unpaid, protested, or discounted<br/>
At a per-centage; a child cross, dog ill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A favourite horse fallen lame just as he 's mounted,<br/>
A bad old woman making a worse will,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which leaves you minus of the cash you counted<br/>
As certain;&mdash;these are paltry things, and yet<br/>
I 've rarely seen the man they did not fret.

</p>
<p>
I 'm a philosopher; confound them all!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bills, beasts, and men, and&mdash;no! not womankind!<br/>
With one good hearty curse I vent my gall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then my stoicism leaves nought behind<br/>
Which it can either pain or evil call,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I can give my whole soul up to mind;<br/>
Though what is soul or mind, their birth or growth,<br/>
Is more than I know&mdash;the deuce take them both!

</p>
<p>
As after reading Athanasius' curse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which doth your true believer so much please:<br/>
I doubt if any now could make it worse<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er his worst enemy when at his knees,<br/>
'Tis so sententious, positive, and terse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And decorates the book of Common Prayer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As doth a rainbow the just clearing air.

</p>
<p>
Gulbeyaz and her lord were sleeping, or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least one of them!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Oh, the heavy night,<br/>
When wicked wives, who love some bachelor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie down in dudgeon to sigh for the light<br/>
Of the gray morning, and look vainly for<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its twinkle through the lattice dusky quite&mdash;<br/>
To toss, to tumble, doze, revive, and quake<br/>
Lest their too lawful bed-fellow should wake!

</p>
<p>
These are beneath the canopy of heaven,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also beneath the canopy of beds<br/>
Four-posted and silk curtain'd, which are given<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For rich men and their brides to lay their heads<br/>
Upon, in sheets white as what bards call 'driven<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow.' Well! 'tis all hap-hazard when one weds.<br/>
Gulbeyaz was an empress, but had been<br/>
Perhaps as wretched if a peasant's quean.

</p>
<p>
Don Juan in his feminine disguise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the damsels in their long array,<br/>
Had bow'd themselves before th' imperial eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the usual signal ta'en their way<br/>
Back to their chambers, those long galleries<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the seraglio, where the ladies lay<br/>
Their delicate limbs; a thousand bosoms there<br/>
Beating for love, as the caged bird's for air.

</p>
<p>
I love the sex, and sometimes would reverse<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The tyrant's wish, 'that mankind only had<br/>
One neck, which he with one fell stroke might pierce:'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My wish is quite as wide, but not so bad,<br/>
And much more tender on the whole than fierce;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It being (not now, but only while a lad)<br/>
That womankind had but one rosy mouth,<br/>
To kiss them all at once from North to South.

</p>
<p>
O, enviable Briareus! with thy hands<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And heads, if thou hadst all things multiplied<br/>
In such proportion!<br/>
&mdash;But my Muse withstands<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant thought of being a Titan's bride,<br/>
Or travelling in Patagonian lands;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So let us back to Lilliput, and guide<br/>
Our hero through the labyrinth of love<br/>
In which we left him several lines above.

</p>
<p>
He went forth with the lovely Odalisques,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At the given signal join'd to their array;<br/>
And though he certainly ran many risks,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet he could not at times keep, by the way<br/>
(Although the consequences of such frisks<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are worse than the worst damages men pay<br/>
In moral England, where the thing 's a tax),<br/>
From ogling all their charms from breasts to backs.

</p>
<p>
Still he forgot not his disguise:&mdash;along<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The galleries from room to room they walk'd,<br/>
A virgin-like and edifying throng,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By eunuchs flank'd; while at their head there stalk'd<br/>
A dame who kept up discipline among<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The female ranks, so that none stirr'd or talk'd<br/>
Without her sanction on their she-parades:<br/>
Her title was 'the Mother of the Maids.'

</p>
<p>
Whether she was a 'mother,' I know not,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or whether they were 'maids' who call'd her mother;<br/>
But this is her seraglio title, got<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not how, but good as any other;<br/>
So Cantemir can tell you, or De Tott:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her office was to keep aloof or smother<br/>
All bad propensities in fifteen hundred<br/>
Young women, and correct them when they blunder'd.

</p>
<p>
A goodly sinecure, no doubt! but made<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More easy by the absence of all men&mdash;<br/>
Except his majesty, who, with her aid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And guards, and bolts, and walls, and now and then<br/>
A slight example, just to cast a shade<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the rest, contrived to keep this den<br/>
Of beauties cool as an Italian convent,<br/>
Where all the passions have, alas! but one vent.

</p>
<p>
And what is that? Devotion, doubtless&mdash;how<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could you ask such a question?&mdash;but we will<br/>
Continue. As I said, this goodly row<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ladies of all countries at the will<br/>
Of one good man, with stately march and slow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like water-lilies floating down a rill&mdash;<br/>
Or rather lake, for rills do not run slowly&mdash;<br/>
Paced on most maiden-like and melancholy.

</p>
<p>
But when they reach'd their own apartments, there,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like birds, or boys, or bedlamites broke loose,<br/>
Waves at spring-tide, or women anywhere<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When freed from bonds (which are of no great use<br/>
After all), or like Irish at a fair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their guards being gone, and as it were a truce<br/>
Establish'd between them and bondage, they<br/>
Began to sing, dance, chatter, smile, and play.

</p>
<p>
Their talk, of course, ran most on the new comer;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her shape, her hair, her air, her everything:<br/>
Some thought her dress did not so much become her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wonder'd at her ears without a ring;<br/>
Some said her years were getting nigh their summer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Others contended they were but in spring;<br/>
Some thought her rather masculine in height,<br/>
While others wish'd that she had been so quite.

</p>
<p>
But no one doubted on the whole, that she<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was what her dress bespoke, a damsel fair,<br/>
And fresh, and 'beautiful exceedingly,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who with the brightest Georgians might compare:<br/>
They wonder'd how Gulbeyaz, too, could be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So silly as to buy slaves who might share<br/>
(If that his Highness wearied of his bride)<br/>
Her throne and power, and every thing beside.

</p>
<p>
But what was strangest in this virgin crew,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although her beauty was enough to vex,<br/>
After the first investigating view,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They all found out as few, or fewer, specks<br/>
In the fair form of their companion new,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than is the custom of the gentle sex,<br/>
When they survey, with Christian eyes or Heathen,<br/>
In a new face 'the ugliest creature breathing.'

</p>
<p>
And yet they had their little jealousies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all the rest; but upon this occasion,<br/>
Whether there are such things as sympathies<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without our knowledge or our approbation,<br/>
Although they could not see through his disguise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All felt a soft kind of concatenation,<br/>
Like magnetism, or devilism, or what<br/>
You please&mdash;we will not quarrel about that:

</p>
<p>
But certain 'tis they all felt for their new<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Companion something newer still, as 'twere<br/>
A sentimental friendship through and through,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Extremely pure, which made them all concur<br/>
In wishing her their sister, save a few<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wish'd they had a brother just like her,<br/>
Whom, if they were at home in sweet Circassia,<br/>
They would prefer to Padisha or Pacha.

</p>
<p>
Of those who had most genius for this sort<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sentimental friendship, there were three,<br/>
Lolah, Katinka, and Dudu; in short<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(To save description), fair as fair can be<br/>
Were they, according to the best report,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though differing in stature and degree,<br/>
And clime and time, and country and complexion;<br/>
They all alike admired their new connection.

</p>
<p>
Lolah was dusk as India and as warm;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Katinka was a Georgian, white and red,<br/>
With great blue eyes, a lovely hand and arm,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And feet so small they scarce seem'd made to tread,<br/>
But rather skim the earth; while Dudu's form<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look'd more adapted to be put to bed,<br/>
Being somewhat large, and languishing, and lazy,<br/>
Yet of a beauty that would drive you crazy.

</p>
<p>
A kind of sleepy Venus seem'd Dudu,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet very fit to 'murder sleep' in those<br/>
Who gazed upon her cheek's transcendent hue,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Attic forehead, and her Phidian nose:<br/>
Few angles were there in her form, 'tis true,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinner she might have been, and yet scarce lose;<br/>
Yet, after all, 'twould puzzle to say where<br/>
It would not spoil some separate charm to pare.

</p>
<p>
She was not violently lively, but<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stole on your spirit like a May-day breaking;<br/>
Her eyes were not too sparkling, yet, half-shut,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They put beholders in a tender taking;<br/>
She look'd (this simile 's quite new) just cut<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From marble, like Pygmalion's statue waking,<br/>
The mortal and the marble still at strife,<br/>
And timidly expanding into life.

</p>
<p>
Lolah demanded the new damsel's name&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Juanna.'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Well, a pretty name enough.<br/>
Katinka ask'd her also whence she came&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'From Spain.'&mdash;'But where is Spain?'&mdash;'Don't ask such stuff,<br/>
Nor show your Georgian ignorance&mdash;for shame!'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Lolah, with an accent rather rough,<br/>
To poor Katinka: 'Spain 's an island near<br/>
Morocco, betwixt Egypt and Tangier.'

</p>
<p>
Dudu said nothing, but sat down beside<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Juanna, playing with her veil or hair;<br/>
And looking at her steadfastly, she sigh'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if she pitied her for being there,<br/>
A pretty stranger without friend or guide,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all abash'd, too, at the general stare<br/>
Which welcomes hapless strangers in all places,<br/>
With kind remarks upon their mien and faces.

</p>
<p>
But here the Mother of the Maids drew near,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With, 'Ladies, it is time to go to rest.<br/>
I 'm puzzled what to do with you, my dear,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She added to Juanna, their new guest:<br/>
'Your coming has been unexpected here,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And every couch is occupied; you had best<br/>
Partake of mine; but by to-morrow early<br/>
We will have all things settled for you fairly.'

</p>
<p>
Here Lolah interposed&mdash;'Mamma, you know<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't sleep soundly, and I cannot bear<br/>
That anybody should disturb you so;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I 'll take Juanna; we 're a slenderer pair<br/>
Than you would make the half of;&mdash;don't say no;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I of your young charge will take due care.'<br/>
But here Katinka interfered, and said,<br/>
'She also had compassion and a bed.

</p>
<p>
'Besides, I hate to sleep alone,' quoth she.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The matron frown'd: 'Why so?'&mdash;'For fear of ghosts,'<br/>
Replied Katinka; 'I am sure I see<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A phantom upon each of the four posts;<br/>
And then I have the worst dreams that can be,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Guebres, Giaours, and Ginns, and Gouls in hosts.'<br/>
The dame replied, 'Between your dreams and you,<br/>
I fear Juanna's dreams would be but few.

</p>
<p>
'You, Lolah, must continue still to lie<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, for reasons which don't matter; you<br/>
The same, Katinka, until by and by;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I shall place Juanna with Dudu,<br/>
Who 's quiet, inoffensive, silent, shy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And will not toss and chatter the night through.<br/>
What say you, child?'<br/>
&mdash;Dudu said nothing, as<br/>
Her talents were of the more silent class;

</p>
<p>
But she rose up, and kiss'd the matron's brow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the eyes, and Lolah on both cheeks,<br/>
Katinka, too; and with a gentle bow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Curt'sies are neither used by Turks nor Greeks)<br/>
She took Juanna by the hand to show<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their place of rest, and left to both their piques,<br/>
The others pouting at the matron's preference<br/>
Of Dudu, though they held their tongues from deference.

</p>
<p>
It was a spacious chamber (Oda is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Turkish title), and ranged round the wall<br/>
Were couches, toilets&mdash;and much more than this<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I might describe, as I have seen it all,<br/>
But it suffices&mdash;little was amiss;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas on the whole a nobly furnish'd hall,<br/>
With all things ladies want, save one or two,<br/>
And even those were nearer than they knew.

</p>
<p>
Dudu, as has been said, was a sweet creature,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very dashing, but extremely winning,<br/>
With the most regulated charms of feature,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which painters cannot catch like faces sinning<br/>
Against proportion&mdash;the wild strokes of nature<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which they hit off at once in the beginning,<br/>
Full of expression, right or wrong, that strike,<br/>
And pleasing or unpleasing, still are like.

</p>
<p>
But she was a soft landscape of mild earth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all was harmony, and calm, and quiet,<br/>
Luxuriant, budding; cheerful without mirth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, if not happiness, is much more nigh it<br/>
Than are your mighty passions and so forth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which some call 'the sublime:' I wish they 'd try it:<br/>
I 've seen your stormy seas and stormy women,<br/>
And pity lovers rather more than seamen.

</p>
<p>
But she was pensive more than melancholy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And serious more than pensive, and serene,<br/>
It may be, more than either&mdash;not unholy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her thoughts, at least till now, appear to have been.<br/>
The strangest thing was, beauteous, she was wholly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconscious, albeit turn'd of quick seventeen,<br/>
That she was fair, or dark, or short, or tall;<br/>
She never thought about herself at all.

</p>
<p>
And therefore was she kind and gentle as<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Age of Gold (when gold was yet unknown,<br/>
By which its nomenclature came to pass;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus most appropriately has been shown<br/>
'Lucus a non lucendo,' not what was,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But what was not; a sort of style that 's grown<br/>
Extremely common in this age, whose metal<br/>
The devil may decompose, but never settle:

</p>
<p>
I think it may be of 'Corinthian Brass,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which was a mixture of all metals, but<br/>
The brazen uppermost). Kind reader! pass<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This long parenthesis: I could not shut<br/>
It sooner for the soul of me, and class<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My faults even with your own! which meaneth, Put<br/>
A kind construction upon them and me:<br/>
But that you won't&mdash;then don't<br/>
&mdash;I am not less free.

</p>
<p>
'Tis time we should return to plain narration,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus my narrative proceeds:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Dudu,<br/>
With every kindness short of ostentation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Show'd Juan, or Juanna, through and through<br/>
This labyrinth of females, and each station<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Described&mdash;what 's strange&mdash;in words extremely few:<br/>
I have but one simile, and that 's a blunder,<br/>
For wordless woman, which is silent thunder.

</p>
<p>
And next she gave her (I say her, because<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The gender still was epicene, at least<br/>
In outward show, which is a saving clause)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An outline of the customs of the East,<br/>
With all their chaste integrity of laws,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By which the more a haram is increased,<br/>
The stricter doubtless grow the vestal duties<br/>
Of any supernumerary beauties.

</p>
<p>
And then she gave Juanna a chaste kiss:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dudu was fond of kissing&mdash;which I 'm sure<br/>
That nobody can ever take amiss,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because 'tis pleasant, so that it be pure,<br/>
And between females means no more than this&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That they have nothing better near, or newer.<br/>
'Kiss' rhymes to 'bliss' in fact as well as verse&mdash;<br/>
I wish it never led to something worse.

</p>
<p>
In perfect innocence she then unmade<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her toilet, which cost little, for she was<br/>
A child of Nature, carelessly array'd:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If fond of a chance ogle at her glass,<br/>
'Twas like the fawn, which, in the lake display'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beholds her own shy, shadowy image pass,<br/>
When first she starts, and then returns to peep,<br/>
Admiring this new native of the deep.

</p>
<p>
And one by one her articles of dress<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were laid aside; but not before she offer'd<br/>
Her aid to fair Juanna, whose excess<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of modesty declined the assistance proffer'd:<br/>
Which pass'd well off&mdash;as she could do no less;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though by this politesse she rather suffer'd,<br/>
Pricking her fingers with those cursed pins,<br/>
Which surely were invented for our sins,&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Making a woman like a porcupine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to be rashly touch'd. But still more dread,<br/>
O ye! whose fate it is, as once 'twas mine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In early youth, to turn a lady's maid;&mdash;<br/>
I did my very boyish best to shine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In tricking her out for a masquerade;<br/>
The pins were placed sufficiently, but not<br/>
Stuck all exactly in the proper spot.

</p>
<p>
But these are foolish things to all the wise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I love wisdom more than she loves me;<br/>
My tendency is to philosophise<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On most things, from a tyrant to a tree;<br/>
But still the spouseless virgin Knowledge flies.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we? and whence came we? what shall be<br/>
Our ultimate existence? what 's our present?<br/>
Are questions answerless, and yet incessant.

</p>
<p>
There was deep silence in the chamber: dim<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And distant from each other burn'd the lights,<br/>
And slumber hover'd o'er each lovely limb<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the fair occupants: if there be sprites,<br/>
They should have walk'd there in their sprightliest trim,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of change from their sepulchral sites,<br/>
And shown themselves as ghosts of better taste<br/>
Than haunting some old ruin or wild waste.

</p>
<p>
Many and beautiful lay those around,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like flowers of different hue, and dime, and root,<br/>
In some exotic garden sometimes found,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With cost, and care, and warmth induced to shoot.<br/>
One with her auburn tresses lightly bound,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fair brows gently drooping, as the fruit<br/>
Nods from the tree, was slumbering with soft breath,<br/>
And lips apart, which show'd the pearls beneath.

</p>
<p>
One with her flush'd cheek laid on her white arm,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And raven ringlets gather'd in dark crowd<br/>
Above her brow, lay dreaming soft and warm;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiling through her dream, as through a cloud<br/>
The moon breaks, half unveil'd each further charm,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As, slightly stirring in her snowy shroud,<br/>
Her beauties seized the unconscious hour of night<br/>
All bashfully to struggle into light.

</p>
<p>
This is no bull, although it sounds so; for<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas night, but there were lamps, as hath been said.<br/>
A third's all pallid aspect offer'd more<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The traits of sleeping sorrow, and betray'd<br/>
Through the heaved breast the dream of some far shore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beloved and deplored; while slowly stray'd<br/>
(As night-dew, on a cypress glittering, tinges<br/>
The black bough) tear-drops through her eyes' dark fringes.

</p>
<p>
A fourth as marble, statue-like and still,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay in a breathless, hush'd, and stony sleep;<br/>
White, cold, and pure, as looks a frozen rill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the snow minaret on an Alpine steep,<br/>
Or Lot's wife done in salt,&mdash;or what you will;&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My similes are gather'd in a heap,<br/>
So pick and choose&mdash;perhaps you 'll be content<br/>
With a carved lady on a monument.

</p>
<p>
And lo! a fifth appears;&mdash;and what is she?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A lady of a 'certain age,' which means<br/>
Certainly aged&mdash;what her years might be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not, never counting past their teens;<br/>
But there she slept, not quite so fair to see,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As ere that awful period intervenes<br/>
Which lays both men and women on the shelf,<br/>
To meditate upon their sins and self.

</p>
<p>
But all this time how slept, or dream'd, Dudu?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With strict inquiry I could ne'er discover,<br/>
And scorn to add a syllable untrue;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But ere the middle watch was hardly over,<br/>
Just when the fading lamps waned dim and blue,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And phantoms hover'd, or might seem to hover,<br/>
To those who like their company, about<br/>
The apartment, on a sudden she scream'd out:

</p>
<p>
And that so loudly, that upstarted all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oda, in a general commotion:<br/>
Matron and maids, and those whom you may call<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither, came crowding like the waves of ocean,<br/>
One on the other, throughout the whole hall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All trembling, wondering, without the least notion<br/>
More than I have myself of what could make<br/>
The calm Dudu so turbulently wake.

</p>
<p>
But wide awake she was, and round her bed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With floating draperies and with flying hair,<br/>
With eager eyes, and light but hurried tread,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bosoms, arms, and ankles glancing bare,<br/>
And bright as any meteor ever bred<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the North Pole,&mdash;they sought her cause of care,<br/>
For she seem'd agitated, flush'd, and frighten'd,<br/>
Her eye dilated and her colour heighten'd.

</p>
<p>
But what was strange&mdash;and a strong proof how great<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A blessing is sound sleep<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Juanna lay<br/>
As fast as ever husband by his mate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In holy matrimony snores away.<br/>
Not all the clamour broke her happy state<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of slumber, ere they shook her,&mdash;so they say<br/>
At least,&mdash;and then she, too, unclosed her eyes,<br/>
And yawn'd a good deal with discreet surprise.

</p>
<p>
And now commenced a strict investigation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, as all spoke at once and more than once,<br/>
Conjecturing, wondering, asking a narration,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alike might puzzle either wit or dunce<br/>
To answer in a very clear oration.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dudu had never pass'd for wanting sense,<br/>
But, being 'no orator as Brutus is,'<br/>
Could not at first expound what was amiss.

</p>
<p>
At length she said, that in a slumber sound<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She dream'd a dream, of walking in a wood&mdash;<br/>
A 'wood obscure,' like that where Dante found<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself in at the age when all grow good;<br/>
Life's half-way house, where dames with virtue crown'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Run much less risk of lovers turning rude;<br/>
And that this wood was full of pleasant fruits,<br/>
And trees of goodly growth and spreading roots;

</p>
<p>
And in the midst a golden apple grew,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A most prodigious pippin,&mdash;but it hung<br/>
Rather too high and distant; that she threw<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her glances on it, and then, longing, flung<br/>
Stones and whatever she could pick up, to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring down the fruit, which still perversely clung<br/>
To its own bough, and dangled yet in sight,<br/>
But always at a most provoking height;&mdash;

</p>
<p>
That on a sudden, when she least had hope,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It fell down of its own accord before<br/>
Her feet; that her first movement was to stoop<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And pick it up, and bite it to the core;<br/>
That just as her young lip began to ope<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the golden fruit the vision bore,<br/>
A bee flew out and stung her to the heart,<br/>
And so&mdash;she awoke with a great scream and start.

</p>
<p>
All this she told with some confusion and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dismay, the usual consequence of dreams<br/>
Of the unpleasant kind, with none at hand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To expound their vain and visionary gleams.<br/>
I 've known some odd ones which seem'd really plann'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Prophetically, or that which one deems<br/>
A 'strange coincidence,' to use a phrase<br/>
By which such things are settled now-a-days.

</p>
<p>
The damsels, who had thoughts of some great harm,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Began, as is the consequence of fear,<br/>
To scold a little at the false alarm<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That broke for nothing on their sleeping car.<br/>
The matron, too, was wroth to leave her warm<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bed for the dream she had been obliged to hear,<br/>
And chafed at poor Dudu, who only sigh'd,<br/>
And said that she was sorry she had cried.

</p>
<p>
'I 've heard of stories of a cock and bull;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But visions of an apple and a bee,<br/>
To take us from our natural rest, and pull<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole Oda from their beds at half-past three,<br/>
Would make us think the moon is at its full.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You surely are unwell, child! we must see,<br/>
To-morrow, what his Highness's physician<br/>
Will say to this hysteric of a vision.

</p>
<p>
'And poor Juanna, too&mdash;the child's first night<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within these walls to be broke in upon<br/>
With such a clamour! I had thought it right<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That the young stranger should not lie alone,<br/>
And, as the quietest of all, she might<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With you, Dudu, a good night's rest have known;<br/>
But now I must transfer her to the charge<br/>
Of Lolah&mdash;though her couch is not so large.'

</p>
<p>
Lolah's eyes sparkled at the proposition;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But poor Dudu, with large drops in her own,<br/>
Resulting from the scolding or the vision,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Implored that present pardon might be shown<br/>
For this first fault, and that on no condition<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(She added in a soft and piteous tone)<br/>
Juanna should be taken from her, and<br/>
Her future dreams should all be kept in hand.

</p>
<p>
She promised never more to have a dream,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least to dream so loudly as just now;<br/>
She wonder'd at herself how she could scream&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas foolish, nervous, as she must allow,<br/>
A fond hallucination, and a theme<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For laughter&mdash;but she felt her spirits low,<br/>
And begg'd they would excuse her; she 'd get over<br/>
This weakness in a few hours, and recover.

</p>
<p>
And here Juanna kindly interposed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And said she felt herself extremely well<br/>
Where she then was, as her sound sleep disclosed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When all around rang like a tocsin bell:<br/>
She did not find herself the least disposed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To quit her gentle partner, and to dwell<br/>
Apart from one who had no sin to show,<br/>
Save that of dreaming once 'mal-a-propos.'

</p>
<p>
As thus Juanna spoke, Dudu turn'd round<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hid her face within Juanna's breast:<br/>
Her neck alone was seen, but that was found<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The colour of a budding rose's crest.<br/>
I can't tell why she blush'd, nor can expound<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery of this rupture of their rest;<br/>
All that I know is, that the facts I state<br/>
Are true as truth has ever been of late.

</p>
<p>
And so good night to them,&mdash;or, if you will,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Good morrow&mdash;for the cock had crown, and light<br/>
Began to clothe each Asiatic hill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mosque crescent struggled into sight<br/>
Of the long caravan, which in the chill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dewy dawn wound slowly round each height<br/>
That stretches to the stony belt, which girds<br/>
Asia, where Kaff looks down upon the Kurds.

</p>
<p>
With the first ray, or rather grey of morn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulbeyaz rose from restlessness; and pale<br/>
As passion rises, with its bosom worn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Array'd herself with mantle, gem, and veil.<br/>
The nightingale that sings with the deep thorn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which fable places in her breast of wail,<br/>
Is lighter far of heart and voice than those<br/>
Whose headlong passions form their proper woes.

</p>
<p>
And that 's the moral of this composition,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If people would but see its real drift;&mdash;<br/>
But that they will not do without suspicion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because all gentle readers have the gift<br/>
Of closing 'gainst the light their orbs of vision;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While gentle writers also love to lift<br/>
Their voices 'gainst each other, which is natural,<br/>
The numbers are too great for them to flatter all.

</p>
<p>
Rose the sultana from a bed of splendour,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Softer than the soft Sybarite's, who cried<br/>
Aloud because his feelings were too tender<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To brook a ruffled rose-leaf by his side,&mdash;<br/>
So beautiful that art could little mend her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though pale with conflicts between love and pride;&mdash;<br/>
So agitated was she with her error,<br/>
She did not even look into the mirror.

</p>
<p>
Also arose about the self-same time,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps a little later, her great lord,<br/>
Master of thirty kingdoms so sublime,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And of a wife by whom he was abhorr'd;<br/>
A thing of much less import in that clime&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least to those of incomes which afford<br/>
The filling up their whole connubial cargo&mdash;<br/>
Than where two wives are under an embargo.

</p>
<p>
He did not think much on the matter, nor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed on any other: as a man<br/>
He liked to have a handsome paramour<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At hand, as one may like to have a fan,<br/>
And therefore of Circassians had good store,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As an amusement after the Divan;<br/>
Though an unusual fit of love, or duty,<br/>
Had made him lately bask in his bride's beauty.

</p>
<p>
And now he rose; and after due ablutions<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Exacted by the customs of the East,<br/>
And prayers and other pious evolutions,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He drank six cups of coffee at the least,<br/>
And then withdrew to hear about the Russians,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose victories had recently increased<br/>
In Catherine's reign, whom glory still adores,

</p>
<p>
But oh, thou grand legitimate Alexander!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her son's son, let not this last phrase offend<br/>
Thine ear, if it should reach&mdash;and now rhymes wander<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost as far as Petersburgh and lend<br/>
A dreadful impulse to each loud meander<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of murmuring Liberty's wide waves, which blend<br/>
Their roar even with the Baltic's&mdash;so you be<br/>
Your father's son, 'tis quite enough for me.

</p>
<p>
To call men love-begotten or proclaim<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their mothers as the antipodes of Timon,<br/>
That hater of mankind, would be a shame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A libel, or whate'er you please to rhyme on:<br/>
But people's ancestors are history's game;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if one lady's slip could leave a crime on<br/>
All generations, I should like to know<br/>
What pedigree the best would have to show?

</p>
<p>
Had Catherine and the sultan understood<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their own true interests, which kings rarely know<br/>
Until 'tis taught by lessons rather rude,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a way to end their strife, although<br/>
Perhaps precarious, had they but thought good,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the aid of prince or plenipo:<br/>
She to dismiss her guards and he his haram,<br/>
And for their other matters, meet and share 'em.

</p>
<p>
But as it was, his Highness had to hold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His daily council upon ways and means<br/>
How to encounter with this martial scold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This modern Amazon and queen of queans;<br/>
And the perplexity could not be told<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the pillars of the state, which leans<br/>
Sometimes a little heavy on the backs<br/>
Of those who cannot lay on a new tax.

</p>
<p>
Meantime Gulbeyaz, when her king was gone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Retired into her boudoir, a sweet place<br/>
For love or breakfast; private, pleasing, lone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And rich with all contrivances which grace<br/>
Those gay recesses:&mdash;many a precious stone<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sparkled along its roof, and many a vase<br/>
Of porcelain held in the fetter'd flowers,<br/>
Those captive soothers of a captive's hours.

</p>
<p>
Mother of pearl, and porphyry, and marble,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Vied with each other on this costly spot;<br/>
And singing birds without were heard to warble;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stain'd glass which lighted this fair grot<br/>
Varied each ray;&mdash;but all descriptions garble<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The true effect, and so we had better not<br/>
Be too minute; an outline is the best,&mdash;<br/>
A lively reader's fancy does the rest.

</p>
<p>
And here she summon'd Baba, and required<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don Juan at his hands, and information<br/>
Of what had pass'd since all the slaves retired,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And whether he had occupied their station;<br/>
If matters had been managed as desired,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his disguise with due consideration<br/>
Kept up; and above all, the where and how<br/>
He had pass'd the night, was what she wish'd to know.

</p>
<p>
Baba, with some embarrassment, replied<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To this long catechism of questions, ask'd<br/>
More easily than answer'd,&mdash;that he had tried<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His best to obey in what he had been task'd;<br/>
But there seem'd something that he wish'd to hide,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which hesitation more betray'd than mask'd;<br/>
He scratch'd his ear, the infallible resource<br/>
To which embarrass'd people have recourse.

</p>
<p>
Gulbeyaz was no model of true patience,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor much disposed to wait in word or deed;<br/>
She liked quick answers in all conversations;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And when she saw him stumbling like a steed<br/>
In his replies, she puzzled him for fresh ones;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And as his speech grew still more broken-kneed,<br/>
Her cheek began to flush, her eyes to sparkle,<br/>
And her proud brow's blue veins to swell and darkle.

</p>
<p>
When Baba saw these symptoms, which he knew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To bode him no great good, he deprecated<br/>
Her anger, and beseech'd she 'd hear him through&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not help the thing which he related:<br/>
Then out it came at length, that to Dudu<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan was given in charge, as hath been stated;<br/>
But not by Baba's fault, he said, and swore on<br/>
The holy camel's hump, besides the Koran.

</p>
<p>
The chief dame of the Oda, upon whom<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The discipline of the whole haram bore,<br/>
As soon as they re-enter'd their own room,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Baba's function stopt short at the door,<br/>
Had settled all; nor could he then presume<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(The aforesaid Baba) just then to do more,<br/>
Without exciting such suspicion as<br/>
Might make the matter still worse than it was.

</p>
<p>
He hoped, indeed he thought, he could be sure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan had not betray'd himself; in fact<br/>
'Twas certain that his conduct had been pure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because a foolish or imprudent act<br/>
Would not alone have made him insecure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But ended in his being found out and sack'd,<br/>
And thrown into the sea.<br/>
&mdash;Thus Baba spoke<br/>
Of all save Dudu's dream, which was no joke.

</p>
<p>
This he discreetly kept in the background,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And talk'd away&mdash;and might have talk'd till now,<br/>
For any further answer that he found,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So deep an anguish wrung Gulbeyaz' brow:<br/>
Her cheek turn'd ashes, ears rung, brain whirl'd round,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if she had received a sudden blow,<br/>
And the heart's dew of pain sprang fast and chilly<br/>
O'er her fair front, like Morning's on a lily.

</p>
<p>
Although she was not of the fainting sort,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Baba thought she would faint, but there he err'd&mdash;<br/>
It was but a convulsion, which though short<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can never be described; we all have heard,<br/>
And some of us have felt thus 'all amort,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When things beyond the common have occurr'd;&mdash;<br/>
Gulbeyaz proved in that brief agony<br/>
What she could ne'er express&mdash;then how should I?

</p>
<p>
She stood a moment as a Pythones<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands on her tripod, agonised, and full<br/>
Of inspiration gather'd from distress,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the heart-strings like wild horses pull<br/>
The heart asunder;&mdash;then, as more or lees<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their speed abated or their strength grew dull,<br/>
She sunk down on her seat by slow degrees,<br/>
And bow'd her throbbing head o'er trembling knees.

</p>
<p>
Her face declined and was unseen; her hair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell in long tresses like the weeping willow,<br/>
Sweeping the marble underneath her chair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or rather sofa (for it was all pillow,<br/>
A low soft ottoman), and black despair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stirr'd up and down her bosom like a billow,<br/>
Which rushes to some shore whose shingles check<br/>
Its farther course, but must receive its wreck.

</p>
<p>
Her head hung down, and her long hair in stooping<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Conceal'd her features better than a veil;<br/>
And one hand o'er the ottoman lay drooping,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;White, waxen, and as alabaster pale:<br/>
Would that I were a painter! to be grouping<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All that a poet drags into detail<br/>
O that my words were colours! but their tints<br/>
May serve perhaps as outlines or slight hints.

</p>
<p>
Baba, who knew by experience when to talk<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And when to hold his tongue, now held it till<br/>
This passion might blow o'er, nor dared to balk<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulbeyaz' taciturn or speaking will.<br/>
At length she rose up, and began to walk<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly along the room, but silent still,<br/>
And her brow clear'd, but not her troubled eye;<br/>
The wind was down, but still the sea ran high.

</p>
<p>
She stopp'd, and raised her head to speak&mdash;but paused,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then moved on again with rapid pace;<br/>
Then slacken'd it, which is the march most caused<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By deep emotion:&mdash;you may sometimes trace<br/>
A feeling in each footstep, as disclosed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By Sallust in his Catiline, who, chased<br/>
By all the demons of all passions, show'd<br/>
Their work even by the way in which he trode.

</p>
<p>
Gulbeyaz stopp'd and beckon'd Baba:&mdash;'Slave!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring the two slaves!' she said in a low tone,<br/>
But one which Baba did not like to brave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet he shudder'd, and seem'd rather prone<br/>
To prove reluctant, and begg'd leave to crave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Though he well knew the meaning) to be shown<br/>
What slaves her highness wish'd to indicate,<br/>
For fear of any error, like the late.

</p>
<p>
'The Georgian and her paramour,' replied<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial bride&mdash;and added, 'Let the boat<br/>
Be ready by the secret portal's side:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You know the rest.' The words stuck in her throat,<br/>
Despite her injured love and fiery pride;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And of this Baba willingly took note,<br/>
And begg'd by every hair of Mahomet's beard,<br/>
She would revoke the order he had heard.

</p>
<p>
'To hear is to obey,' he said; 'but still,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sultana, think upon the consequence:<br/>
It is not that I shall not all fulfil<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your orders, even in their severest sense;<br/>
But such precipitation may end ill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even at your own imperative expense:<br/>
I do not mean destruction and exposure,<br/>
In case of any premature disclosure;

</p>
<p>
'But your own feelings. Even should all the rest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be hidden by the rolling waves, which hide<br/>
Already many a once love-beaten breast<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in the caverns of the deadly tide&mdash;<br/>
You love this boyish, new, seraglio guest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if this violent remedy be tried&mdash;<br/>
Excuse my freedom, when I here assure you,<br/>
That killing him is not the way to cure you.'

</p>
<p>
'What dost thou know of love or feeling?<br/>
&mdash;Wretch!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Begone!' she cried, with kindling eyes&mdash;'and do<br/>
My bidding!' Baba vanish'd, for to stretch<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His own remonstrance further he well knew<br/>
Might end in acting as his own 'Jack Ketch;'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And though he wish'd extremely to get through<br/>
This awkward business without harm to others,<br/>
He still preferr'd his own neck to another's.

</p>
<p>
Away he went then upon his commission,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Growling and grumbling in good Turkish phrase<br/>
Against all women of whate'er condition,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially sultanas and their ways;<br/>
Their obstinacy, pride, and indecision,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their never knowing their own mind two days,<br/>
The trouble that they gave, their immorality,<br/>
Which made him daily bless his own neutrality.

</p>
<p>
And then he call'd his brethren to his aid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sent one on a summons to the pair,<br/>
That they must instantly be well array'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And above all be comb'd even to a hair,<br/>
And brought before the empress, who had made<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Inquiries after them with kindest care:<br/>
At which Dudu look'd strange, and Juan silly;<br/>
But go they must at once, and will <em>I&mdash;</em>nill I.

</p>
<p>
And here I leave them at their preparation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the imperial presence, wherein whether<br/>
Gulbeyaz show'd them both commiseration,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or got rid of the parties altogether,<br/>
Like other angry ladies of her nation,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are things the turning of a hair or feather<br/>
May settle; but far be 't from me to anticipate<br/>
In what way feminine caprice may dissipate.

</p>
<p>
I leave them for the present with good wishes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though doubts of their well doing, to arrange<br/>
Another part of history; for the dishes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this our banquet we must sometimes change;<br/>
And trusting Juan may escape the fishes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his situation now seems strange<br/>
And scarce secure, as such digressions are fair,<br/>
The Muse will take a little touch at warfare.
