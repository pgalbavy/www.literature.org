<p>I have spoken of Ben Mayberry's fondness for athletic sports,
and the great benefit he gained from the exercise thus obtained.
When business permitted, I visited the ball grounds, where his
skill made him the favorite of the enthusiastic crowd which always
assembled there. He played shortstop, and his activity in picking
up hot grounders and his wonderful accuracy in throwing to first
base were the chief attractions which brought many to the place.
He was equally successful at the bat, and, when only fourteen
years old, repeatedly lifted the ball over the left-field fence&mdash;a
feat which was only accomplished very rarely by the heaviest batsmen
of the visiting nines.</p>

<p>There were many, including myself, who particularly admired Ben's
throwing. How any living person can acquire such skill is beyond
my comprehension. Ben was the superior of all his companions when
a small urchin, and his wonderful accuracy improved as he grew
older.</p>

<p>To please a number of spectators, Ben used to place himself on
third base, and then "bore in" the ball to first. In its arrowy
passage it seemed scarcely to rise more than two or three feet
above the horizontal, and shot through the air with such unerring
aim that I really believe he could have struck a breast-pin on
a player's front nine times out of ten. I never saw him make a
wild throw, and some of his double plays were executed with such
brilliancy that a veteran player took his hand one day as he ran
from the field, and said:</p>

<p>"Ben, you'll be on a professional nine in a couple of years.
Harry Wright and the different managers are always on the lookout
for talent, and they'll scoop you in."</p>

<p>"I think not," said the modest Ben, panting slightly from a terrific
run. "I am a little lucky, that's all; but though I'm very fond
of playing ball I never will take it up as a means of living."</p>

<p>"There's where your head ain't level, sonny. Why, you'll get
more money for one summer's play than you will make in two or
three years nursing a telegraph machine. Besides that, think of
the fun you will have."</p>

<p>"That's all very good, and I can understand why baseball is so
tempting to so many young men. But it lasts a short time, and
then the player finds himself without any regular business. His
fingers are banged out of shape; he has exercised so violently
that more than likely his health is injured, and he is compelled
to work like a common laborer to get a living. Ten years from
now there will hardly be one of the present professionals in the
business, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"I guess you ain't far from the fact, but for all that, if I
had the chance that you have, I would be mighty glad to take in
all the baseball sport I could."</p>

<p>But Ben was sensible in this respect, and steadily refused to
look upon himself as training for the professional ball field.
In looking back to that time, I am rejoiced that such is the fact.
There are many of my readers who recall the popular players of
years ago &mdash;McBride, Wright, Fisler, Sensenderfer, McMullen,
Start, Brainard, Gould, Leonard, Dean, Spalding, Sweeney, Radcliffe,
McDonald, Addy, Pierce, and a score of others. Among them all
I recall none still in the field. Some are dead, and the rest
are so "used up" that they would make a sorry exhibition if placed
on the ball field to-day.</p>

<p>Ben Mayberry was a swift and skillful skater, and in running
there was not a boy in Damietta who could equal him. It was by
giving heed to these forms of healthful exercise, and by avoiding
liquor and tobacco, that he preserved his rosy cheeks, his clear
eye, his vigorous brain, and his bounding health.</p>

<p>"Why, how do you do, Ben?"</p>

<p>The lad looked up from his desk in the office, one clear, autumn
day, as he heard these words, and I did the same. There stood
one of the loveliest little girls I ever looked upon. She seemed
to be ten or eleven years of age, was richly dressed, with an
exuberant mass of yellow hair falling over her shoulders. Her
large, lustrous eyes were of a deep blue, her complexion as rich
and pink as the lining of a sea shell, and her features as winsome
as any that Phidias himself ever carved from Parian marble.</p>

<p>Ben rose in a hesitating way and walked toward her, uncertain,
though he suspected her identity.</p>

<p>"Is this&mdash;no, it cannot be&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes; I am Dolly Willard, that you saved from drowning with my
poor mamma last winter. I wrote you a letter soon after I got
home, but you felt too important to notice it, I suppose."</p>

<p>And the laughing girl reached her hand over the counter, while
Ben shook it warmly, and said:</p>

<p>"You wrote to me? Surely there was some mistake, for I never
got the letter; I would have only been too glad to answer it.
Maybe you forgot to drop it in the office."</p>

<p>"I gave it to Uncle George, and told him to be careful and put
it in the mail, and he said he did so when he came home, so it
was not my fault. But I am visiting at my cousin's in Commerce
Street, at Mr. Grandin's&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I know the place."</p>

<p>"They are going to have a grand party there to-night, and I've
come down to ask you to be sure and be there."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to receive your invitation, but&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You can go," said I, as Ben looked appealingly toward me.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. Yes, Miss Dolly, I count upon great pleasure
in being present."</p>

<p>"If you don't come, I'll never speak to you again," called the
pretty little miss as she passed out of the door.</p>

<p>"I am sorry and troubled about one thing," said Ben to me, when
we stood together. "This Uncle George of Dolly's is the G. R.
Burkhill who received that cipher dispatch. I am satisfied he
is a villain, and there's trouble close at hand."</p>
