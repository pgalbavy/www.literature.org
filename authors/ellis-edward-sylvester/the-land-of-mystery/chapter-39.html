<p>The horrified Fred Ashman saw that the poisoned arrow, aimed
at his own heart had buried itself in the fair arm of Ariel, as
she clasped him about the neck anxious to shield him from harm
at the expense of her own life.</p>

<p>She had saved him, but at what a fearful cost!  The agonized
lover realized it all, as he tenderly placed her on the rock beside
which they were standing.  Then, like the man who, knowing he
has been fatally struck by the rattlesnake or cobra, turns to
stamp the life out of the reptile, before looking after his own
wound, he faced about and brought his rifle to his shoulder. 
The dusky miscreant cowered low, but he could not save himself,
for the bullet which left the Winchester, entering at the skull,
ranged through the length of his body, and he rolled off the ledge
like a rotten log and went down the yawning abyss that afforded
a fit sepulture for such as he.</p>

<p>King Haffgo was standing erect, as if defying the white man to
fire at him.  He had seen the result of the shot and he did not
regret it.</p>

<p>"Die the death you deserve!" he called out in English; "for you
are not the daughter of Haffgo!"</p>

<p>Then he turned about and moved along the ledge, while Ashman
stood for an instant, with weapon levelled, feeling that the awful
occurrence had absolved him from the pledge made a short time
before.</p>

<p>He was aiming, when a faint voice at his side said:</p>

<p>"No, hurt him not; <em>I shall get well</em>!"</p>

<p>Letting the rifle fall from his grasp, he wheeled around as if
he had been shot himself.</p>

<p>What did he see?</p>

<p>The brave Ariel had drawn the arrow from her arm, and was sitting
erect.  In her right hand, was a small earthen bottle such as
was in common use among the Murhapas.</p>

<p>"Great heaven! what does this mean?" demanded her lover, uncertain
whether he was awake or dreaming.</p>

<p>She smiled faintly, and said:</p>

<p>"I feel a little faint, but the danger is past."</p>

<p>"But,&mdash;but,"&mdash;he added, "the arrow was poisoned!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but the poison has a remedy; it is in <em>that</em>," she
added, holding up the bottle; "my parent always carried it; I
brought it with me when I left home."</p>

<p>The overjoyed lover could not repress a shout of joy,&mdash;a shout
which penetrated every portion of the cavern of diamonds, but
whose meaning, fortunately for the couple, was not understood
by the ears on which it fell.</p>

<p>He knelt beside her, so that the bowlders shut both from the
view of any prowlers who might seek to reach them.  He kissed
the happy face again and again; he called her the sweetest names
that ever mortal uttered, and he assured her that they should
both live and be happy forever.</p>

<p>In his overflowing bliss, he could not realize that they were
still walled in on every hand.  All that he could know and feel,
was, that she was spared from a dreadful death,&mdash;that she had
interposed her own precious body to protect him from harm.</p>

<p>Enwrapped in his arms, she was obliged to confess that the bringing
of the potent remedy was an inspiration, when she stole out of
her father's house, for she never dreamed of the use to which
it would be put.</p>

<p>She had forgotten all about it, until the sharp twinge in her
arm apprised her that she was struck by the fearful missile. 
Then, as she was about to swoon, she recalled that she carried
the remedy in her bosom.</p>

<p>Drawing it quickly forth, while her lover's face was turned away,
she drank the whole contents, which were sufficient to save the
lives of three or four persons.  Not a drop, however, was left;
and she remarked in her own peculiar manner, that they must be
careful not to be struck by any more such missiles, since the
remedy was gone, and it would be hard to secure more.</p>

<p>With a full realization of the remarkable deliverance of his
beloved, Ashman was roused to a stronger resolution than before
of making a desperate effort to extricate themselves from their
perilous situation, which looked indeed as if without hope.</p>

<p>Rising to his feet, but screening his body as he could, he carefully
peered around the cavern of diamonds.  He cautioned Ariel to keep
out of sight, for, if it should become know that her life was
saved, her father and his warriors would doubtless make another
attempt to reach them.</p>

<p>Looking in the direction of the opening on the other side, he
saw Haffgo pass out, followed the next minute or two by the rest
of the Murhapas.  To Ashman this was proof that the party had
decided to withdraw from the cavern, but would keep watch of the
egress to make sure that the white man did not get away by some
freak of fortune.</p>

<p>Since they were sure he was caught in a trap from which there
was no escape, he had his choice of remaining and starving to
death, of coming forth and giving himself up, or of ending it
all by precipitating himself down the rocks.</p>

<p>A terrible punishment indeed for the white man that had dared
to defy the king of the Murhapas, and had been the cause of the
death of the beloved princess!</p>

<p>Ashman was still studying the insoluble problem, when a strange
impulse led him to look aloft.  It will be remembered that he
was near the roof of the cavern, among a mass of bowlders and
rocks which touched the dome.</p>

<p>Several times it had seemed to him that a felt a slight, upward
draught, as though a portion of the air found vent in that direction.
When he mentioned it to Ariel she admitted that she had noticed
the same thing, and urged him to investigate.</p>

<p>Leaving his Winchester with her, he began a cautious ascent of
the rugged stairs.  He had about twenty feet to climb, and the
greatest care was necessary.  Not until at the very top, did he
pass from the sight of the maiden who was attentively watching
his movements.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, he let go his hold and dropped, down beside
her. His face was flushed and his eyes glowing with excitement.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" he exclaimed, greatly agitated; "there is an
opening by which we can reach the outer world."</p>

<p>"I was sure of it," she replied with a happy smile.</p>

<p>During his brief absence, she had bandaged her arm as best she
could by tearing a slip from her dress.  The wound bled less than
would be supposed, and caused her little pain.</p>

<p>Taking her other hand, Ashman began helping her up among the
rocks and bowlders.  She needed little aid, however, for she was
lighter and more graceful on her feet than he.</p>

<p>Sure enough, when they arrived at the top, they came upon a broader
opening than that by which they had entered the cavern.  It was
hidden from sight by a projecting table of rock, and when they
came to pass through, the outer opening was seen to be so covered
by bushes that it never could have been found except by the accident
which first showed Ariel the way into the cavern.</p>

<p>But with hearts overflowing with gratitude to heaven, they found
themselves on the earth again, with the sun shining and the pure
air of heaven fanning their fevered faces.</p>

<p>They had emerged at the crest of the mountainous mass, which
covered a portion of the enchanted lake and the cavern of diamonds. 
Fortunately, too, they were among the woods, where they could
not see far in any direction.  This rendered them less liable
to discovery by their enemies in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Ashman held his position until the two could study their location
and gain an idea of the points of the compass.  The rising sun
helped them to do this, and, by moving carefully about until they
gained sight of the lake and the Upper Xingu, they soon ascertained
in what direction the Murhapa village lay, and the course necessary
to take in order to avoid it.</p>

<p>It was decided to put back in the forest and thread their way
through the dense wilderness, striking the Xingu at a point below
the rapids. There, if they found nothing of their friends, they
would manage to secure a boat in which they could press their
flight in the direction of the Amazon.</p>

<p>The forests abounded with wild animals and huge serpents, but
the ardent lover was admirably armed and confident that he could
protect his beloved from all harm, provided they could escape
discovery by the Murhapas and Aryks.</p>

<p>If Haffgo should venture on an approach to the rocks, where the
fugitives made their stand, he could not fail to find out the
extraordinary manner in which they had eluded him, and he would
be certain to organize instant pursuit.</p>

<p>But this was not likely to take place for a considerable time,
though the possibility led Ashman to push forward with all vigor,
often pausing to listen for sounds of pursuit.</p>

<p>The extreme caution of the lovers led them to trend much further
into the woods than was really necessary, and they were a long
time, therefore, in reaching the Xingu.</p>

<p>Neither had eaten food for an unusual while, but they cared nothing
for that.  They were too anxious for any thought except that of
getting forward as fast as possible.</p>

<p>As they progressed, startled now and then by the prowling wild
beasts which threatened attack more than once, and by the sight
of enormous serpents, some in trees and some on the ground, Fred
Ashman's thoughts naturally went forward, and he speculated as
to what was the result of the attack on his friends the preceding
night in the village.</p>

<p>He could comprehend the frightful situation in which they were
placed by the enmity of the king, and it seemed incredible that
any, or at least all of them, could have extricated themselves
from their peril. Gladly would he have risked everything in their
defence, but, as has been shown, that was beyond his power at
any time.</p>

<p>The young American shrank from firing his gun, through fear of
the report reaching the ears of the Murhapas.  If that should
take place, it would be sure to excite their suspicions, and prompt
an investigation which the fugitives dreaded.</p>

<p>Once a jaguar became so threatening, that he leveled his weapon
convinced that he must fire or be attacked, but the snarling beast
finally withdrew, after sneaking behind them for a long distance.</p>

<p>The sun had passed the meridian when the wanderers caught the
gleam of water among the trees in front.  They hastened forward,
and a moment's survey of the stream convinced them that they had
reached the Xingu beyond all question.</p>

<p>Ashman recognized several features along the banks which he had
noticed on his way up the river.  Ariel was equally positive,
so they dismissed the question from their minds.</p>

<p>Both were nearly exhausted, for they had had a tiresome tramp,
during all of which they were under a severe mental strain.  They
felt that, at last, they could sit down and rest themselves before
resuming their journey.</p>

<p>"The next thing to be done," said Ashman as he imprisoned the
hand of Ariel and drew her head upon his shoulder, "is to find
some boat in which we can float down stream.  It will be less
work than we had in ascending it."</p>

<p>"I suppose," she replied, "that there are people all the way
along the river until you reach the end of it."</p>

<p>"There are; but we found most of them unfriendly long before
we struck the region of the Aryks."</p>

<p>"Are they likely to attack us?" she asked, raising her head and
looking at her lover with an alarmed expression.</p>

<p>"We had little difficulty, so long as we kept in the middle of
the stream, and one discharge from our guns was generally enough
to drive them away."</p>

<p>"And for how far does this prevail?"</p>

<p>"Two or three days ought to take us out of the danger.  Then
it will be plain sailing all the rest of the way.  The river is
long, but, dearest, we shall be with each other, and it will seem
brief."</p>

<p>She parted her lips to make a suitable reply, when a startled
expression came upon her lovely countenance and she whispered:</p>

<p>"They must have followed us through the woods."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked, grasping his rifle.</p>

<p>"I hear some one moving behind us."</p>

<p>"It is a wild animal&#11834;"</p>

<p>He checked himself, for, to his unspeakable amazement, Professor
Grimcke at that instant stepped to view.</p>

<p>The two men caught sight of each other at the same moment.  They
stared as if in doubt, and then, with exclamations of delight,
clasped hands.</p>

<p>By great good fortune, the lovers had emerged from the forest
within a stone's throw of the point where Grimcke, Long, Bippo,
and Pedros were waiting with the canoe hidden among the trees.</p>

<p>After this reunion they set out for home.</p>

<p>A few days carried them beyond danger, and in good time the Amazon
was reached.  Bippo and Pedros were left at Marcapa, at which
port the explorers secured passage for home, where they arrived
in safety.  And in that land, so strange to the beauteous Ariel,
daughter of Haffgo, king of the Murhapas, we bid good-by to our
friends.  But to her, Ashman was all the world; and in the sunshine
of their mutual love they dwell to-day, happy, grateful, contented,
and envying no one, assured, as they are, that none can be more
blessed than they.</p>
