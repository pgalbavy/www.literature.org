<p>Scout Master Hall here interposed:</p>

<p>"Uncle Elk, I don’t think any of the boys have a flint and steel,
and I am sure I do not possess them; matches are so cheap and
convenient that we have discarded the method of our grandparents."</p>

<p>"I knew that when I spoke; the conditions are that no match nor
flint, steel and tinder shall be called into use. The only artificial
helps the scouts can have are their knives, hatchets and such
aids as they may carry with them. Come, boys, use your wits and
inaugurate the conflagration."</p>

<p>The command or rather proposition stumped the lads, who looked
at one another, smiled and shook their heads. Finally Patrol Leader
Chase approached the Instructor, who was calmly waiting, saluted
and said:</p>

<p>"I suppose all of us, sir, have read in story books that the
Indians and other savages often start a fire by rubbing a couple
of dry sticks together."</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen it done?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"And you never will. No person ever produced a flame by that
means, for the reason that he cannot move the sticks fast enough
and keep them going. I tried it once till my arms ached and found
that I had only succeeded in slightly warming the surfaces of
the pieces of pine. I might have kept it up until to-day with
no other result."</p>

<p>"What whoppers lots of the story books tell!" commented Colgate
Craig.</p>

<p>"We expect them to do that; my only objection is that so many
of the yarns are absurd. Will you allow me to diverge for a minute?"
added Uncle Elk, with a bow to Scout Master Hall, who nodded.</p>

<p>"You are always interesting, Uncle Elk."</p>

<p>"To illustrate: some of our most popular stories are of hidden
treasure and the means used to unearth it, the most interesting
yarn being that a key to its location is left which is in so complicated
a cipher that its solution baffles every one for a long time.
Now why in the name of common sense did Captain Kidd or whoever
buried his ill-gotten riches leave any cipher at all? Who taught
the ignorant pirate or brigand how to build up a wonderful cryptogram?
Why does he leave a riddle for the mere sake of making strangers
rack their brains over it? So it is that many of the most successful
detective stories of to-day are simply feverish conglomerations
of ingenious impossibilities."</p>

<p>Uncle Elk paused and chuckled.</p>

<p>"Excuse those tremendous words,—I forgot myself. Let’s get back
to the business before us. It is true that Indians obtain fire
by means of friction, that is, when they know how to do it, but
the majority are ignorant of the secret. Boys," added the Instructor,
brightening up, "have you ever reflected upon the almost limitless
uses of friction? Life would be impossible without it. When the
axle of a railway car uses up its oil the brakeman is notified
of the fact by the blaze which speedily follows. The falling stars
shooting through space are invisible till they reach our atmosphere,
when the friction causes them to glow with heat."</p>

<p>"Well, nothing is clearer than that fire can be produced by friction,
but, as I said, no man can take two pieces of the dryest wood
and evolve a flame without aid. Am I right in saying that none
of you know how to generate fire without matches or the old-fashioned
flint and steel?"</p>

<p>Unanimous inclination of heads and a general chorus, "You are."</p>

<p>"I propose to teach you the trick. One boy will do, but it is
better to have two. Will Corporal Robe and Michael oblige?"</p>

<p>The lads stepped forward and gravely saluted Uncle Elk.</p>

<p>"I observe that the corporal carries his hatchet in the sheath
at his belt, but Michael has none."</p>

<p>"I don’t naad the constant reminder of Gin’ral Washington as
he does, to make me stick to the truth," said Mike with a grin
and a quickness which was answered by a laugh from all. He added:</p>

<p>"It’ll be my plaisure to see that the corporal obeys insthructions;
I’m not afeard of him if he does carry that axe wid him."</p>

<p>"The first thing to do," continued Uncle Elk, "is to cut two
pieces of dry cedar, one a foot and a half long and say an inch
through, though it does not matter if it is slightly less."</p>

<p>Mike had forgotten everything told the boys by the Instructor
regarding the <em>Juniperus Virginiana</em>, but from his manner
you would have thought him competent to give points to Uncle Elk
himself. I have said that our young Irish friend was gifted with
an excellent memory, a fact which he had proved many times, and
especially while listening to the words of the hermit in his home
the night before. In the latter instance, however, he was deeply
interested while he had become a trifle wearied by the dissertations
of the Instructor. You know how it is in such circumstances.</p>

<p>None the less, as I said, Mike’s manner gave the opposite impression.
Assuming the pose of director he walked slightly in advance of
the corporal, as the two set out to find the cedar sticks needed.
Since all the boys had heard the directions of Uncle Elk, they
followed their comrades and joined in the search. Kenneth Henke,
prompted by the waggish spirit of Mike, ran a little in advance
and halted beside a vigorous maple sapling.</p>

<p>"What do you ask better than this? Aren’t we lucky, Mike?"</p>

<p>"That we are, ’tis just what we want, as me cousin Hughey said
when his mither set a bushel of peeled praties in front of him
for dessert."</p>

<p>And Mike walked up to the maple and tapped it smartly with his
buckthorn.</p>

<p>"What are you driving at?" asked the astonished corporal; "that
isn’t a cedar."</p>

<p>"And who said it was? Why didn’t ye wait till I finished my enlightening
observation? I was about to say whin ye broke in that it is the
very tree that we want to lave alone. What do ye maan by such
unseemly levity?" demanded Mike, turning upon the other lads who
were laughing at his slip. "Now, corporal, don’t try to cut down
that cedar wid the back of yer hatchet; the blade will sarve ye
much better."</p>

<p>With the keen-edged implement the other youth quickly severed
a dry limb from the proper tree and trimmed it to a length of
eighteen inches. Having done this, he looked up and saw Uncle
Elk and Scout Master Hall among the spectators gathered round
him. Robe turned to the old man for further directions.</p>

<p>"Whittle each end to a sharp point."</p>

<p>This was quickly done.</p>

<p>"Cut another stick and hew it flat, with the thickness of the
first; make a notch in it and at the end of the small end of the
notch a little saucer-like pit."</p>

<p>Let me describe what was done under the direction of the Instructor.</p>

<p>A small pine knot was selected and a little excavation cut in
it with the point of the corporal’s knife. This was to receive
the upper end of the vertical sharpened stick, the knot serving
as a cap to hold the upright in position and in which it revolved,
after the fashion of the common auger which is worked with one
hand. The lower end of the upright fitted in the cavity of the
flat stick which lay horizontal on the ground and this revolving
point generated the fire.</p>

<p>The one necessity was that the dry, pointed lower extremity should
be made to spin around fast enough for the friction to produce
a flame. This speed had to be much faster than can be secured
by the unaided hand, no matter how swift it may be. The needed
velocity is thus secured:</p>

<p>A cedar bow, some two feet long was made. There was no difficulty
in doing this, since every patrol of Boy Scouts is sure to be
well provided with twine or cord. The bow was bent sufficiently
to hold taut the string that is wound once around the upright
stick. Then, by drawing the bow back and forth for its whole length,
the vertical piece revolved very fast and the necessary friction
was secured on the lower point which rested in the cavity of the
flat stick lying on the ground.</p>

<p>Before operations began some thin dry cedar shavings, macerated
with cedar bark, were rolled into a sphere the size of a billiard
ball. This made excellent tinder and all was ready.</p>

<p>Instructed by Uncle Elk, Corporal Robe rested his left hand on
the pine knot or cap on the top of the upright stick, so as to
hold it in place. He fixed one knee on the flat piece on the ground
to keep it from slipping. Then, as indicated, he started the business
by drawing the bow its full length back and forth. The drill fairly
hummed. It was hardly a minute when the dust thus ground out turned
black, smoked and filled the notch. The flat stick was withdrawn
and with his hat the corporal fanned the powder, which quickly
showed a crimson point. The tinder was gently laid on top of this,
the fanning renewed and lo! a glowing flame broke forth. Then
followed clapping of hands and compliments.</p>

<p>Although Mike Murphy had played the part of spectator all through,
he doffed his hat and bowed low.</p>

<p>"This is so sudden, gintlemen, as Terry O’Brien said whin the
lightning knocked him off the church steeple where he was working,
but I thank ye all the same."</p>

<p>"It took about three minutes," remarked Uncle Elk, "because the
corporal is an apprentice; I have done it in less than a minute.
In these modern days it isn’t often necessary to know how to start
a fire solely by means of friction, but you can see that such
knowledge might well prove the means of saving one’s life. There
isn’t a flint and steel in your whole party, and I presume the
same may be said of all troops of Boy Scouts. Suppose that in
the depths of the woods, in the middle of winter, a small company
finds that every match has been used. The only method of starting
a fire is by the means just employed. It is so simple that it
is always at command. So many story writers have the habit of
saying in their glib, off-hand way that their marooned or astray
heroes kindled a flame by rubbing two sticks together that the
readers believe it, when the thing is as impossible as perpetual
motion. Now, since you have started a fire, your next duty is
to put it out."</p>

<p>No water being handy, the few embers were scattered and stamped
into the moist earth, until not a spark remained. Addressing the
company, Uncle Elk said:</p>

<p>"Ernest Thompson-Seton tells an amusing story which he heard
from Walter Hough. An Apache Indian turned up his nose at the
matches of the white men and boasted that he could ignite a quantity
of sticks quicker than Hough could with matches. It was such,
a preposterous claim that Hough challenged him to a trial. It
was accepted, they took their positions, the buck gave a few turns,
but as the umpire was about to say ‘Go!’ the Indian called, ‘Stop—stop
him—no good.’ He rearranged the contrivance and Mr. Hough grasped
his match.</p>

<p>"‘Stop—stop him—no good,’ protested the redskin again, demanding
a delay a third time before he nodded his head and the umpire
called, ‘Go!’</p>

<p>"Mr. Hough felt his advantage was so overwhelming that he did
not hurry in striking the sputtering match, but hardly had it
ignited, when the Apache uttered an exclamation of triumph, for
he had produced smoke. This was covered with tinder, fanned a
few seconds and broke into a vivid flame before the white man
had his sticks ablaze.</p>

<p>"The Indian had won, but it was by a trick. While he appeared
to be testing his contrivance the sly rascal was really ‘winding
it up’ and it was a part of his game.</p>

<p>"The Moros of the Philippines have an ingenious way of producing
fire. They use a short piece of bamboo, a bit of broken china
and tinder. Holding the bamboo firmly in his left hand, the bit
of china, with a pinch of tinder between the china and thumb in
his right hand, the native strikes a quick downward blow with
the china along the bamboo. A long spark follows and ignites the
tinder which is readily blown into the blaze."</p>

<p>"Why should the process you describe cause a flame?" asked Scout
Master Hall.</p>

<p>"The bamboo is very hard with a glazed surface; the sharp edge
of the china pares off a thin strip of the glaze, and the friction
of the blow ignites it. The operation is so simple that the Moro
children have no trouble with it. But we have no bamboo in our
woods, and that method is consequently impossible. The method
you have just learned is quite likely to be at your command in
all circumstances when lost in the woods and is much more convenient
than the other means." </p>
