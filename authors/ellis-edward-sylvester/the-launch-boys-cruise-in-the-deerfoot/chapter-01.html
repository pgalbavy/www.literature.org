<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I once heard the bravest officer I ever knew declare that the
height of absurdity was for a person to boast that he did not
know the meaning of fear. "Such a man is either a fool or the
truth is not in him," was the terse expression of the gallant
soldier.</p>

<p>Now it would have been hard to find a more courageous youth than
Alvin Landon, who had just entered his seventeenth year, and yet
he admits that on a certain soft moonlit night in summer he felt
decidedly "creepy," and I believe you and I would have felt the
same in his situation. He was walking homeward and had come to
a stretch of pine forest that was no more than an eighth of a
mile in length. The road was so direct that when you entered the
wood you could see the opening at the farther side, where you
came again upon meadows and cultivated fields. The highway was
so broad that only a portion of it was shaded and there was no
excuse for one losing his way even when the moon and stars failed
to give light. All you had to do was to "keep in the middle of
the road" and plod straight on.</p>

<p>But when the orb of night rode high in the sky and the course
was marked as plainly as at midday, there was always the deep
gloom on the right and left, into which the keenest eye could
not penetrate. A boy's imagination was apt to people the obscurity
with frightful creatures crouching and waiting for a chance to
pounce upon him.</p>

<p>Alvin was a student in a preparatory school on the Hudson, where
he was making ready for his admission to the United States Military
Academy at West Point. The appointment had been guaranteed his
father, a wealthy capitalist, by one of the Congressmen of his
district, but nearly two years had to pass before the lad would
be old enough to become a cadet, and pass the rigid mental and
physical examination required of every one enrolled in the most
admirable military institution in the world.</p>

<p>On this mild August night he was going home from the little cove
where his motor boat nestled under the shed built for its protection.
His chum Chester Haynes, about his own age, lived within a hundred
yards of the shelter of the craft, so that it was always under
his eye, when not dashing up the Kennebec or some of its tributaries,
or cruising over the broad waters of Casco Bay. On their return
from an all-day excursion, they reached Chester's home so late
that Alvin stayed to supper. It was dark when he set out for his
own home, a good half mile north, the last part of the walk leading
through the odorous pines of which I have made mention.</p>

<p>The lad had no weapon, for he needed none. His father was opposed
to the too free use of firearms by boys and insisted that when
a lad found it necessary to carry a pistol for protection it was
time for him to stay within doors where no one could harm him.</p>

<p>The youth was impatient because of a certain nervousness which
came to him when he stepped into the pulseless gloom and saw far
ahead the broad silvery door opening into the open country beyond.</p>

<p>"About all the Indians in this part of the world," he mused,
yielding to a whimsical fancy, "are at Oldtown; the others are
making baskets, bows and arrows, moccasins and trinkets to sell
to summer visitors. There used to be bears and panthers and wolves
and deer in Maine, but most of them are in the upper part. I shouldn't
dare to shoot a buck or moose if he came plunging at me with antlers
lowered, for it is the close season and a fellow can't satisfy
the wardens by saying he had to shoot in self-defence. As for
other kinds of wild animals, there's no use of thinking of them.</p>

<p>"I should be ashamed to let Chester know I felt creepy to-night,
when I have been through these woods so often without a thought
of anything wrong. But it does seem to me that some sort of mischief
is brooding in the air&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Tu-whit-tu-whoo-oo!</em>"</p>

<p>Alvin must have leaped a foot from the ground. He was sure he
felt his cap rise several inches above his crown, with still an
upward tendency. Then he softly laughed.</p>

<p>"Only a screech owl, but that hoot when you are not expecting
it is startling enough to make a fellow jump. It seems to me nature
might have given that bird a more cheerful voice, say like the
thrush or nightingale. Then it would be pleasant to listen to
his music after dark. I remember when I was a little codger and
was coming home late one night, near Crow's Nest, one of those
things began hooting right over my head and I didn't stop running
till I tumbled through the gate. I think I have a little more
sense now than in those days."</p>

<p>It did not add to his peace of mind when he glanced behind him
to see a shadowy form coming toward him from the rear and keeping
so close to the line of obscurity on his right that only a flitting
glimpse of him was caught. Few situations are more nerve-racking
than the discovery at night of an unknown person dogging your
footsteps. He may be a friend or an enemy&mdash;more likely the latter&mdash;and
you see only evil intent in his stealthy pursuit.</p>

<p>But Alvin's good sense quieted his fears and he resumed his course,
still holding the middle of the road, alert and watchful.</p>

<p>"He can't mean any harm," he thought, "for every one in this
part of the country is a neighbor of the others. I shall be glad
to have his company and will lag so that he will soon overtake
me&mdash;hello!"</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that two ghost-like figures suddenly
whisked across the road in front. They seemed to be in a hurry
and acted as if they wished to escape observation&mdash;though why
they should feel thus was more than Alvin could guess. It dawned
upon him that he was between two fires.</p>

<p>"It's queer that so many strangers are abroad to-night, though
they have as much right to tramp through the country as I."</p>

<p>At the time of learning the rather disquieting fact, young Landon
had gone two-thirds of the way through the wood, so that the couple
in front were near the open country. Striving to convince himself
that he had no cause for misgiving, he still felt uneasy as he
moved stealthily forward. He gave no thought to the one behind,
for it was easy to avoid him. His interest centered upon the two
in front, with whom he was quite sure to come in contact. They
were no longer in sight, but whether they were walking in the
broad ribbon of shadow at the side of the highway, or awaiting
his approach, was impossible to tell.</p>

<p>He stopped and listened. The one dismal hoot of the owl seemed
to have satisfied the bird, which remained silent. The straining
ear failed to catch the slightest footfall. Recalling the feathery
dust upon which he was stepping, Alvin knew that no one could
hear his footfalls.</p>

<p>For the first time, he now left the band of illumination, moving
into the darkness on his left. There he could be invisible to
every one not less than four or five paces away.</p>

<p>"If they don't wish me to see them, there's no reason why they
should see me," was the thought which impelled him. Gradually
he slackened his pace until he stood still. Then with all his
senses keyed to a high tension he did some hard thinking. Despite
his ridicule of his own fears, he could not shake off the suspicion
that mischief was brooding over him. The two men in front and
the third at the rear belonged to the same party.</p>

<p>"They mean to rob me," muttered Alvin, compressing his lips.</p>

<p>The belief seemed reasonable, for he was worthy of the attention
of one or more yeggmen. He carried a gold watch, the gift of his
father, a valuable pin in his scarf, a present from his mother,
and always had a generous amount of money with him. Many a youth
in his situation would have meekly surrendered his property upon
the demand of a company of criminals against whom it was impossible
to prevail, but our young friend was made of sterner stuff. He
would not yield so long as he could fight, and his bosom burned
with righteous anger at the thought that such an outrage was possible
in these later days.</p>

<p>All the same, he was too sensible to invite a physical encounter
so long as there was a good chance of avoiding it. The wisest
thing to do was to step noiselessly in among the pines at his
side, pick his way for a few rods, and then wait for the danger
to pass; or he could continue to steal forward, shaping his course
so as to reach the open country, so far to one side of the highway
that no one would see him.</p>

<p>You will smile when I tell you why Alvin Landon did not follow
this plan.</p>

<p>"They may suspect what I'm doing and sneak along the edge of
the wood to catch me as I come out. Then I'll have to run for
it, and I'll be hanged if I'll run from all the yeggmen in the
State of Maine!"</p>

<p>He listened intensely, not stirring a muscle for several minutes.
Once he fancied he heard a faint rustling a little way behind
him, but it might have been a falling leaf. At the front the silence
was like that of the tomb.</p>

<p>"They're waiting for me. Very well!"</p>

<p>Instead of keeping within the darkness, he stepped back into
the middle of the road and strode forward with his usual pace.
He did not carry so much as a cane or broken limb with which to
defend himself. All at once he began whistling that popular college
air, "When I saw Sweet Nellie Home." He would not admit to himself
that it was because he felt the slightest fear, but somehow or
other, the music seemed to take the place of a companion. He began
to suspect that it might not be so bad after all for a frightened
lad thus to cheer himself when picking his course through a dark
reach of woods.</p>

<p>"At any rate it can't tell them where I am, for all of them already
know it," was his conclusion.</p>
