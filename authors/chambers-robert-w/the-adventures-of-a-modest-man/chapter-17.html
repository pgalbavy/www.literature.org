<p>After a while I repeated: "They <em>did</em> marry, didn't they?"</p>

<p>"What do <em>you</em> think?"</p>

<p>"I'm perfectly certain they did."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what more do you want?" he laughed.</p>

<p>"Another of your reminiscences disguised as fiction," I said,
tinkling my spoon on the edge of my tumbler to attract the waiter.</p>

<p>"Two more," I said, lighting a caporal cigarette, the penetrating
aroma of which drifted lazily through forgotten years, drawing
memory with it in its fragrant back-draught.</p>

<p>"Do you remember Seabury's brother?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Beaux Arts? Certainly. Architect, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he came into a lot of money and started for home to
hit a siding."</p>

<p>"Little chump," I said; "I remember him. There was a promising
architect spoiled."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. He is doing a lot to his money."</p>

<p>"Good?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Otherwise I should have said that his money is doing
a lot to him."</p>

<p>"Cut out these fine shades and go back to galley-proof," I said,
sullenly. "What about him, anyway?"</p>

<p>Williams said, slowly: "A thing happened to that man which had
no right to happen anywhere except in a musical comedy. But,"
he shrugged his shoulders, "everybody's lives are really full
of equally grotesque episodes. The trouble is that the world is
too serious to discover any absurdity in itself. We writers have
to do that for it. For example, there was Seabury's brother. Trouble
began the moment he saw her."</p>

<p>"Saw who?" I interrupted.</p>

<p>"Saw her! Shut up!"</p>

<p>I did so. He continued:</p>

<p>They encountered one another under the electric lights in the
wooden labyrinth which forms the ferry terminal of the Sixth Avenue
Elevated Railroad, she hastening one way, he hurrying the opposite.
There was ample room for them to pass each other; it may have
been because she was unusually pretty, it may have been his absent-mindedness,
but he made one of those mistakes which everybody makes once in
a lifetime: he turned to the left, realised what he was doing,
wheeled hastily to the right&mdash;as she, too, turned&mdash;only to meet
her face to face, politely dodge, meet again, lose his head and
begin a heart-breaking contra-dance, until, vexed and bewildered,
she stood perfectly still, and he, redder than she, took the opportunity
to slink past her and escape.</p>

<p>"Hey!" said a sarcastic voice, as, blinded with chagrin, he found
himself attempting to force a locked wooden gate. "You want to
go the other way, unless you're hunting for the third rail."</p>

<p>"No, I don't," he said, wrathfully; "I want to go uptown."</p>

<p>"That's what I said; you want to go the other way, even if you
don't know where you want to go," yawned the gateman disdainfully.</p>

<p>Seabury collected his scattered wits and gazed about him. Being
a New Yorker, and acquainted with the terminal labyrinth, he very
quickly discovered his error, and, gripping suit-case and golf-bag
more firmly, he turned and retraced his steps at the natural speed
of a good New Yorker, which is a sort of a meaningless lope.</p>

<p>Jammed into the familiar ticket line, he peered ahead through
the yellow glare of light and saw the charming girl with whom
he had danced his foolish contra-dance just receiving her ticket
from the boxed automaton. Also, to his satisfaction, he observed
her disappear through the turnstile into the crush surging forward
alongside of the cars, and, when he presently deposited his own
ticket in the chopper's box, he had no more expectation of ever
again seeing her than he had of doing something again to annoy
and embarrass her.</p>

<p>But even in Manhattan Destiny works overtime, and Fate gets busy
in a manner that no man knoweth; and so, personally though invisibly
conducted, Seabury lugged his suit-case and golf-bag aboard a
train, threaded his way into a stuffy car and took the only empty
seat remaining; and a few seconds later, glancing casually at
his right-hand neighbour, he blushed to find himself squeezed
into a seat beside his unusually attractive partner in the recent
contra-dance.</p>

<p>That she had already seen him, the calm indifference in her blue
eyes, the poise of her flushed face, were evidence conclusive.</p>

<p>He shrank back, giving her all the room he could, set his bag
of golf-clubs between his knees, and looked innocent. First, as
all New Yorkers do, he read the line of advertisements opposite
with the usual personal sense of resentment; then he carelessly
scanned the people across the aisle. As usual, they resembled
everybody he had never particularly noticed; he fished out the
evening paper, remembered that he had read it on the ferryboat,
stuck it into his golf-bag, and contemplated the battered ends
of his golf-clubs.</p>

<p>Station after station flashed yellow lamps along the line of
car windows; passengers went and passengers took their places;
in one of the streets below he caught a glimpse of a fire engine
vomiting sparks and black smoke; in another an ambulance with
a squalid assemblage crowded around a policeman who was emerging
from a drug store.</p>

<p>He had pretty nearly succeeded in forgetting the girl and his
mortification; he cast a calmly casual glance over his well-fitting
trousers and shoes. The edge of a shoe-lace lay exposed, and he
leisurely remedied this untidy accident, leaning over and tying
the lace securely with a double knot.</p>

<p>Fourteenth, Eighteenth, Twenty-third, ran the stations. He gathered
his golf-bag instinctively and sat alert, prepared to rise and
leave the car with dignity.</p>

<p>"Twenty-eighth!" It was his station. Just as he rose the attractive
girl beside him sprang up, and at the same instant his right leg
was jerked from under him and he sat down in his seat with violence.
Before he comprehended what had happened, the girl, with a startled
exclamation, fell back into her seat, and he felt a spasmodic
wrench at his foot again.</p>

<p>Astonished, he struggled to rise once more, but something held
him&mdash;his foot seemed to be caught; and as he turned he encountered
her bewildered face and felt another desperate tug which brought
him abruptly into his seat again.</p>

<p>"What on earth is the matter?" he asked.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'I &mdash;I don't know,' she stammered; 'my shoe
seems tied to yours.'"]</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I don't know," she stammered; "my shoe seems to be
tied to yours."</p>

<p>"Tied!" he cried, bending down in a panic, "wasn't that <em>my</em>
shoe-lace?" His golf-bag fell, he seized it and set it against
the seat between them. "Hold it a moment," he groaned. "I tied
your shoe-lace to mine!"</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> tied it!" she repeated, furiously.</p>

<p>"I saw a shoe-lace&mdash;I thought it was mine &mdash;I tied it fast&mdash;in
a d-d-double knot&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Untie it at once!" she said, crimson to the roots of her hair.</p>

<p>"Great Heavens, madam! I didn't mean to do it! I'll fix it in
a moment&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't," she whispered, fiercely; "the people opposite are looking
at us! Do you wish to hold us both up to ridicule?" He straightened
up, thoroughly flurried.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;this is my station&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"It is mine, too. I'd rather sit here all night than have those
people see you untie your shoe from mine! How&mdash;how <em>could</em>
you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I've explained that I didn't mean to do it," he returned, dropping
into the breathless undertone in which she spoke. "Happening to
glance down, I saw a shoe-lace end and thought my shoe was untied&#11834;"</p>

<p>She looked at him scornfully.</p>

<p>"And I tied it tight, that's all. I'm horribly mortified; this
is the second time I've appeared to disadvantage&#11834;"</p>

<p>"People in New York usually turn to the right; even horses&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I doubt," he said, "that you can make me feel much worse than
I feel now, but it's a sort of a horrible relief to know what
a fool you think me."</p>

<p>She said nothing, sitting there, cooling her hot face in the
breeze from the forward door; he, numb with chagrin, stole an
apprehensive glance at the passengers opposite. Nobody appeared
to have observed their plight, and he ventured to say so in a
low voice.</p>

<p>"Are you certain?" she asked, her own voice not quite steady.</p>

<p>"Perfectly. Look! Nobody is eying our feet."</p>

<p>Her own small feet were well tucked up under her gown; she instinctively
drew them further in; he felt a little tug; they both coloured
furiously.</p>

<p>"This is simply unspeakable," she said, looking straight ahead
of her through two bright tears of mortification.</p>

<p>"Suppose," he whispered, "you edge your foot a trifle this way
&mdash;I think I can cut the knot with my penknife&mdash;" He glanced
about him stealthily. "Shall I try?"</p>

<p>"Not now. Wait until those people go."</p>

<p>"But some of them may live in Harlem."</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I can't help it. Do you suppose I'm going to let you
lean over before all those people and try to untie our shoes?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to sit here until they're all gone?" he asked, appalled.</p>

<p>"I do. Terrible as the situation is, we've got to conceal it."</p>

<p>"Even if some of them go to the end of the line?"</p>

<p>"I don't care!" She turned on him with a hint of that pretty
fierceness again. "Do you know what you've done? You've affronted
and mortified me and humiliated me beyond endurance. I have a
guest to dine with me: I shall not arrive before midnight!"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," he said miserably, "that anything you say can
add to my degradation? Can't you imagine how a man must feel who
first of all makes a four-footed fool of himself before the most
attractive girl he&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't say that!" she cried, hotly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will! You are! And I dodged and tumbled about like a
headless chicken and ran into the wrong gate. I wish I'd climbed
out on the third rail! And then, when I hoped I'd never see you
again, I found myself beside you, and &mdash;Good Heavens! I lost
no time in beginning my capers again and doing the most abandoned
deed a man ever accomplished on earth!"</p>

<p>She appeared to be absorbed in contemplation of a breakfast-food
advertisement; her color was still high; at times she worried
her under lip with her white teeth, but her breath rose and fell
under the fluffy bosom of her gown with more regularity, and the
two bright tears in her eyes had dried unshed. Wrath may have
dried them.</p>

<p>"I wish it were possible," he said very humbly, "for you to see
the humour&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Humour!" she repeated, menacingly.</p>

<p>"No &mdash;I didn't mean that, I meant the&mdash;the&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You did! You meant the humour of the situation. I will answer
you. I do <em>not</em> see the humour of it!"</p>

<p>"You are quite right," he admitted, looking furtively at the
edge of her gown which concealed his right foot. "It is, as you
say, simply ghastly to be tied together by the feet. Don't you
suppose I could&mdash;without awakening suspicion&mdash;cut the&mdash;the laces
with a penknife?"</p>

<p>"I beg you will attempt nothing whatever until this car is empty."</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said. "I will do anything in the world I can
to spare you."</p>

<p>She did not reply, and he sat there nervously balanced on the
edge of his seat, watching the lights of Harlem flash into view
below. He had been hungry; he was no longer. Appetite had been
succeeded by a gnawing anxiety. Again and again warm waves of
shame overwhelmed him, alternating with a sort of wild-eyed pity
for the young girl who sat so rigidly beside him, face averted.
Once a mad desire to laugh seized him; he wondered whether it
might be a premonition of hysteria, and shuddered. It did not
seem as though he could possibly endure it another second to be
tied by the foot to this silently suffering and lovely companion.</p>

<p>"Do you think," he said, hoarsely, "at the next station that
if we rose together&mdash;and kept step&#11834;"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"<em>A&mdash;</em>a sort of lock-step," he explained, timidly.</p>

<p>"I would if I thought it possible," she replied under her breath;
"but I dare not. Suppose you should miss step! You are likely
to do anything if it's only sufficiently foolish."</p>

<p>"You could take my arm and pretend you are my lame sister," he
ventured.</p>

<p>"Suppose the train started. Suppose, by any one of a thousand
possible accidents, you should become panic-stricken. What sort
of a spectacle would we furnish the passengers of this car? No!
No! No! The worst of it is almost over. My guest is there&mdash;astounded
at my absence. Before I am even half-way back to Twenty-eighth
Street she will have become sufficiently affronted to leave the
house. I might as well go on to the end of the road." She turned
toward him hastily: "Where is the end of this road?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere in the Bronx, I believe," he said, vaguely.</p>

<p>"That is hours from Twenty-eighth Street, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I believe so."</p>

<p>The train whirled on; stations were far between, now. He sat
so silent, so utterly broken and downcast, that after a long while
she turned to him with a hint of softness in her stern reserve.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said, "I do not suppose you deliberately intended
to tie our feet together. I am not absurd. But the astonishment,
the horror of finding what you had done exasperated me for a moment.
I'm cool enough now; besides, it is perfectly plain that you are
the sort of man one is&mdash;is accustomed to know."</p>

<p>"I hope not!" he said, devoutly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I mean&mdash;" She hesitated, and the glimmer of a smile touched
her eyes, instantly extinguished, however.</p>

<p>"I understand," he said. "You mean that it's lucky your shoe-laces
are tied to the shoe-lace of a man of your own sort. I hope to
Heaven you may find a little comfort in that."</p>

<p>"I do," she said, with the uncertain violet light in her eyes
again. "It's bad enough, goodness knows, but I &mdash;I am very
sure you did not mean&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You are perfectly right; I mean well, as they say of all chumps.
And the worst of it is," he added, wildly, "I never before knew
that I was a chump! I never before saw any symptoms. Would you
believe me, I never in all my life have been such an idiot as
I was in those first few minutes that I crossed your path. How
on earth to account for it; how to explain, to ask pardon, to&mdash;to
ever forget it! As long as I live I shall wake at night with the
dreadful chagrin burning my ears off. Isn't it the limit? And
I &mdash;I shouldn't have felt so crushed if it had been anybody
excepting you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I do not understand," she said gravely.</p>

<p>"I do," he muttered.</p>
