A great city swept away by the sea, a beautiful country
devastated by an active volcano - these are not the sort of things
you see every day of the week.  And when you do see them, no
matter how many other wonders you may have seen in your time,
such sights are rather apt to take your breath away.  Atlantis
had certainly this effect on the breaths of Cyril, Robert,
Anthea, and Jane.</p>

<p>They remained in a breathless state for some days.  The learned
gentleman seemed as breathless as anyone; he spent a good deal of
what little breath he had in telling Anthea about a wonderful
dream he had.  'You would hardly believe,' he said, 'that anyone
COULD have such a detailed vision.'</p>

<p>But Anthea could believe it, she said, quite easily.</p>

<p>He had ceased to talk about thought-transference.  He had now
seen too many wonders to believe that.</p>

<p>In consequence of their breathless condition none of the children
suggested any new excursions through the Amulet.  Robert voiced
the mood of the others when he said that they were 'fed up' with
Amulet for a bit.  They undoubtedly were.</p>

<p>As for the Psammead, it went to sand and stayed there, worn out
by the terror of the flood and the violent exercise it had had to
take in obedience to the inconsiderate wishes of the learned
gentleman and the Babylonian queen.</p>

<p>The children let it sleep.  The danger of taking it about among
strange people who might at any moment utter undesirable wishes
was becoming more and more plain.</p>

<p>And there are pleasant things to be done in London without any
aid from Amulets or Psammeads.  You can, for instance visit the
Tower of London, the Houses of Parliament, the National Gallery,
the Zoological Gardens, the various Parks, the Museums at South
Kensington, Madame Tussaud's Exhibition of Waxworks, or the
Botanical Gardens at Kew.  You can go to Kew by river
steamer - and this is the way that the children would have gone if
they had gone at all.  Only they never did, because it was when
they were discussing the arrangements for the journey, and what
they should take with them to eat and how much of it, and what
the whole thing would cost, that the adventure of the Little
Black Girl began to happen.</p>

<p>The children were sitting on a seat in St James's Park.  They had
been watching the pelican repulsing with careful dignity the
advances of the seagulls who are always so anxious to play games
with it.  The pelican thinks, very properly, that it hasn't the
figure for games, so it spends most of its time pretending that
that is not the reason why it won't play.</p>

<p>The breathlessness caused by Atlantis was wearing off a little. 
Cyril, who always wanted to understand all about everything, was
turning things over in his mind.</p>

<p>'I'm not; I'm only thinking,' he answered when Robert asked him
what he was so grumpy about.  'I'll tell you when I've thought it
all out.'</p>

<p>'If it's about the Amulet I don't want to hear it,' said Jane.</p>

<p>'Nobody asked you to,' retorted Cyril mildly, 'and I haven't
finished my inside thinking about it yet.  Let's go to Kew in the
meantime.'</p>

<p>'I'd rather go in a steamer,' said Robert; and the girls laughed.</p>

<p>'That's right,' said Cyril, 'BE funny.  I would.'</p>

<p>'Well, he was, rather,' said Anthea.</p>

<p>'I wouldn't think, Squirrel, if it hurts you so,' said Robert
kindly.</p>

<p>'Oh, shut up,' said Cyril, 'or else talk about Kew.'</p>

<p>'I want to see the palms there,' said Anthea hastily, 'to see if
they're anything like the ones on the island where we united the
Cook and the Burglar by the Reverend Half-Curate.'</p>

<p>All disagreeableness was swept away in a pleasant tide of
recollections, and 'Do you remember ...?' they said.  'Have you
forgotten ...?'</p>

<p>'My hat!' remarked Cyril pensively, as the flood of reminiscence
ebbed a little; 'we have had some times.'</p>

<p>'We have that,' said Robert.</p>

<p>'Don't let's have any more,' said Jane anxiously.</p>

<p>'That's what I was thinking about,' Cyril replied; and just then
they heard the Little Black Girl sniff.  She was quite close to
them.</p>

<p>She was not really a little black girl.  She was shabby and not
very clean, and she had been crying so much that you could hardly
see, through the narrow chink between her swollen lids, how very
blue her eyes were.  It was her dress that was black, and it was
too big and too long for her, and she wore a speckled
black-ribboned sailor hat that would have fitted a much bigger
head than her little flaxen one.  And she stood looking at the
children and sniffing.</p>

<p>'Oh, dear!' said Anthea, jumping up.  'Whatever is the matter?'</p>

<p>She put her hand on the little girl's arm.  It was rudely shaken
off.</p>

<p>'You leave me be,' said the little girl.  'I ain't doing nothing
to you.'</p>

<p>'But what is it?' Anthea asked.  'Has someone been hurting you?'</p>

<p>'What's that to you?' said the little girl fiercely.  'YOU'RE all
right.'</p>

<p>'Come away,' said Robert, pulling at Anthea's sleeve.  'She's a
nasty, rude little kid.'</p>

<p>'Oh, no,' said Anthea.  'She's only dreadfully unhappy.  What is
it?' she asked again.</p>

<p>'Oh, YOU'RE all right,' the child repeated; 'YOU ain't agoin' to
the Union.'</p>

<p>'Can't we take you home?' said Anthea; and Jane added, 'Where
does your mother live?'</p>

<p>'She don't live nowheres - she's dead - so now!' said the little
girl fiercely, in tones of miserable triumph.  Then she opened
her swollen eyes widely, stamped her foot in fury, and ran away. 
She ran no further than to the next bench, flung herself down
there and began to cry without even trying not to.</p>

<p>Anthea, quite at once, went to the little girl and put her arms
as tight as she could round the hunched-up black figure.</p>

<p>'Oh, don't cry so, dear, don't, don't!' she whispered under the
brim of the large sailor hat, now very crooked indeed.  'Tell
Anthea all about it; Anthea'll help you.  There, there, dear,
don't cry.'</p>

<p>The others stood at a distance.  One or two passers-by stared
curiously.</p>

<p>The child was now only crying part of the time; the rest of the
time she seemed to be talking to Anthea.</p>

<p>Presently Anthea beckoned Cyril.</p>

<p>'It's horrible!' she said in a furious whisper, 'her father was a
carpenter and he was a steady man, and never touched a drop
except on a Saturday, and he came up to London for work, and
there wasn't any, and then he died; and her name is Imogen, and
she's nine come next November.  And now her mother's dead, and
she's to stay tonight with Mrs Shrobsall - that's a landlady
that's been kind - and tomorrow the Relieving Officer is coming
for her, and she's going into the Union; that means the
Workhouse.  It's too terrible.  What can we do?'</p>

<p>'Let's ask the learned gentleman,' said Jane brightly.</p>

<p>And as no one else could think of anything better the whole party
walked back to Fitzroy Street as fast as it could, the little
girl holding tight to Anthea's hand and now not crying any more,
only sniffing gently.</p>

<p>The learned gentleman looked up from his writing with the smile
that had grown much easier to him than it used to be.  They were
quite at home in his room now; it really seemed to welcome them. 
Even the mummy-case appeared to smile as if in its distant
superior ancient Egyptian way it were rather pleased to see them
than not.</p>

<p>Anthea sat on the stairs with Imogen, who was nine come next
November, while the others went in and explained the difficulty.</p>

<p>The learned gentleman listened with grave attention.</p>

<p>'It really does seem rather rough luck,' Cyril concluded,
'because I've often heard about rich people who wanted children
most awfully - though I know <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> never should - but they do.  There
must be somebody who'd be glad to have her.'</p>

<p>'Gipsies are awfully fond of children,' Robert hopefully said. 
'They're always stealing them.  Perhaps they'd have her.'</p>

<p>'She's quite a nice little girl really,' Jane added; 'she was
only rude at first because we looked jolly and happy, and she
wasn't.  You understand that, don't you?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said he, absently fingering a little blue image from
Egypt.  'I understand that very well.  As you say, there must be
some home where she would be welcome.'  He scowled thoughtfully
at the little blue image.</p>

<p>Anthea outside thought the explanation was taking a very long
time.</p>

<p>She was so busy trying to cheer and comfort the little black girl
that she never noticed the Psammead who, roused from sleep by her
voice, had shaken itself free of sand, and was coming crookedly
up the stairs.  It was close to her before she saw it.  She
picked it up and settled it in her lap.</p>

<p>'What is it?' asked the black child.  'Is it a cat or a
organ-monkey, or what?'</p>

<p>And then Anthea heard the learned gentleman say - </p>

<p>'Yes, I wish we could find a home where they would be glad to
have her,' and instantly she felt the Psammead begin to blow
itself out as it sat on her lap.</p>

<p>She jumped up lifting the Psammead in her skirt, and holding
Imogen by the hand, rushed into the learned gentleman's room.</p>

<p>'At least let's keep together,' she cried.  'All hold
hands - quick!'</p>

<p>The circle was like that formed for the Mulberry Bush or
Ring-o'-Roses.  And Anthea was only able to take part in it by
holding in her teeth the hem of her frock which, thus supported,
formed a bag to hold the Psammead.</p>

<p>'Is it a game?' asked the learned gentleman feebly.  No one
answered.</p>

<p>There was a moment of suspense; then came that curious
upside-down, inside-out sensation which one almost always feels
when transported from one place to another by magic.  Also there
was that dizzy dimness of sight which comes on these occasions.</p>

<p>The mist cleared, the upside-down, inside-out sensation subsided,
and there stood the six in a ring, as before, only their twelve
feet, instead of standing on the carpet of the learned
gentleman's room, stood on green grass.  Above them, instead of
the dusky ceiling of the Fitzroy Street floor, was a pale blue
sky.  And where the walls had been and the painted mummy-case,
were tall dark green trees, oaks and ashes, and in between the
trees and under them tangled bushes and creeping ivy.  There were
beech-trees too, but there was nothing under them but their own
dead red drifted leaves, and here and there a delicate green
fern-frond.</p>

<p>And there they stood in a circle still holding hands, as though
they were playing Ring-o'-Roses or the Mulberry Bush.  just six
people hand in hand in a wood.  That sounds simple, but then you
must remember that they did not know WHERE the wood was, and
what's more, they didn't know WHEN then wood was.  There was a
curious sort of feeling that made the learned gentleman say - </p>

<p>'Another dream, dear me!' and made the children almost certain
that they were in a time a very long while ago.  As for little
Imogen, she said, 'Oh, my!' and kept her mouth very much open
indeed.</p>

<p>'Where are we?' Cyril asked the Psammead.</p>

<p>'In Britain,' said the Psammead.</p>

<p>'But when?' asked Anthea anxiously.</p>

<p>'About the year fifty-five before the year you reckon time from,'
said the Psammead crossly.  'Is there anything else you want to
know?' it added, sticking its head out of the bag formed by
Anthea's blue linen frock, and turning its snail's eyes to right
and left.  'I've been here before - it's very little changed.'
'Yes, but why here?' asked Anthea.</p>

<p>'Your inconsiderate friend,' the Psammead replied, 'wished to
find some home where they would be glad to have that unattractive
and immature female human being whom you have picked up - gracious
knows how.  In Megatherium days properly brought-up children
didn't talk to shabby strangers in parks.  Your thoughtless
friend wanted a place where someone would be glad to have this
undesirable stranger.  And now here you are!'</p>

<p>'I see we are,' said Anthea patiently, looking round on the tall
gloom of the forest.  'But why HERE?  Why NOW?'</p>

<p>'You don't suppose anyone would want a child like that in YOUR
times - in YOUR towns?' said the Psammead in irritated tones. 
'You've got your country into such a mess that there's no room
for half your children - and no one to want them.'</p>

<p>'That's not our doing, you know,' said Anthea gently.</p>

<p>'And bringing me here without any waterproof or anything,' said
the Psammead still more crossly, 'when everyone knows how damp
and foggy Ancient Britain was.'</p>

<p>'Here, take my coat,' said Robert, taking it off.  Anthea spread
the coat on the ground and, putting the Psammead on it, folded it
round so that only the eyes and furry ears showed.</p>

<p>'There,' she said comfortingly.  'Now if it does begin to look
like rain, I can cover you up in a minute.  Now what are we to
do?'</p>

<p>The others who had stopped holding hands crowded round to hear
the answer to this question.  Imogen whispered in an awed tone - </p>

<p>'Can't the organ monkey talk neither!  I thought it was only
parrots!'</p>

<p>'Do?' replied the Psammead.  'I don't care what you do!'  And it
drew head and ears into the tweed covering of Robert's coat.</p>

<p>The others looked at each other.</p>

<p>'It's only a dream,' said the learned gentleman hopefully;
'something is sure to happen if we can prevent ourselves from
waking up.'</p>

<p>And sure enough, something did.</p>

<p>The brooding silence of the dark forest was broken by the
laughter of children and the sound of voices.</p>

<p>'Let's go and see,' said Cyril.</p>

<p>'It's only a dream,' said the learned gentleman to Jane, who hung
back; 'if you don't go with the tide of a dream - if you
resist - you wake up, you know.'</p>

<p>There was a sort of break in the undergrowth that was like a
silly person's idea of a path.  They went along this in Indian
file, the learned gentleman leading.</p>

<p>Quite soon they came to a large clearing in the forest.  There
were a number of houses - huts perhaps you would have called
them - with a sort of mud and wood fence.</p>

<p>'It's like the old Egyptian town,' whispered Anthea.</p>

<p>And it was, rather.</p>

<p>Some children, with no clothes on at all, were playing what
looked like Ring-o'-Roses or Mulberry Bush.  That is to say, they
were dancing round in a ring, holding hands.  On a grassy bank
several women, dressed in blue and white robes and tunics of
beast-skins sat watching the playing children.</p>

<p>The children from Fitzroy Street stood on the fringe of the
forest looking at the games.  One woman with long, fair braided
hair sat a little apart from the others, and there was a look in
her eyes as she followed the play of the children that made
Anthea feel sad and sorry.</p>

<p>'None of those little girls is her own little girl,' thought
Anthea.</p>

<p>The little black-clad London child pulled at Anthea's sleeve.</p>

<p>'Look,' she said, 'that one there - she's precious like mother;
mother's 'air was somethink lovely, when she 'ad time to comb it
out.  Mother wouldn't never a-beat me if she'd lived 'ere - I
don't suppose there's e'er a public nearer than Epping, do you,
Miss?'</p>

<p>In her eagerness the child had stepped out of the shelter of the
forest.  The sad-eyed woman saw her.  She stood up, her thin face
lighted up with a radiance like sunrise, her long, lean arms
stretched towards the London child.</p>

<p>'Imogen!' she cried - at least the word was more like that than
any other word - 'Imogen!'</p>

<p>There was a moment of great silence; the naked children paused in
their play, the women on the bank stared anxiously.</p>

<p>'Oh, it IS mother - it IS!' cried Imogen-from-London, and rushed
across the cleared space.  She and her mother clung together - so
closely, so strongly that they stood an instant like a statue
carved in stone.</p>

<p>Then the women crowded round. 'It IS my Imogen!' cried the woman.</p>

<p>'Oh it is!  And she wasn't eaten by wolves.  She's come back to
me.  Tell me, my darling, how did you escape?  Where have you
been?  Who has fed and clothed you?'</p>

<p>'I don't know nothink,' said Imogen.</p>

<p>'Poor child!' whispered the women who crowded round, 'the terror
of the wolves has turned her brain.'</p>

<p>'But you know ME?' said the fair-haired woman.</p>

<p>And Imogen, clinging with black-clothed arms to the bare neck,
answered - </p>

<p>'Oh, yes, mother, I know YOU right 'nough.'</p>

<p>'What is it?  What do they say?' the learned gentleman asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>'You wished to come where someone wanted the child,' said the
Psammead.  'The child says this is her mother.'</p>

<p>'And the mother?'</p>

<p>'You can see,' said the Psammead.</p>

<p>'But is she really?  Her child, I mean?'</p>

<p>'Who knows?' said the Psammead; 'but each one fills the empty
place in the other's heart.  It is enough.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' said the learned gentleman, 'this is a good dream.  I wish
the child might stay in the dream.'</p>

<p>The Psammead blew itself out and granted the wish.  So Imogen's
future was assured.  She had found someone to want her.</p>

<p>'If only all the children that no one wants,' began the learned
gentleman - but the woman interrupted.  She came towards them.</p>

<p>'Welcome, all!' she cried.  'I am the Queen, and my child tells
me that you have befriended her; and this I well believe, looking
on your faces.  Your garb is strange, but faces I can read.  The
child is bewitched, I see that well, but in this she speaks
truth.  Is it not so?'</p>

<p>The children said it wasn't worth mentioning.</p>

<p>I wish you could have seen all the honours and kindnesses
lavished on the children and the learned gentleman by those
ancient Britons.</p>

<p>You would have thought, to see them, that a child was something
to make a fuss about, not a bit of rubbish to be hustled about
the streets and hidden away in the Workhouse.  It wasn't as grand
as the entertainment at Babylon, but somehow it was more
satisfying.</p>

<p>'I think you children have some wonderful influence on me,' said
the learned gentleman.  'I never dreamed such dreams before I
knew you.'</p>

<p>It was when they were alone that night under the stars where the
Britons had spread a heap Of dried fern for them to sleep on,
that Cyril spoke.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said, 'we've made it all right for Imogen, and had a
jolly good time.  I vote we get home again before the fighting
begins.'</p>

<p>'What fighting?' asked Jane sleepily.</p>

<p>'Why, Julius Caesar, you little goat,' replied her kind brother. 
'Don't you see that if this is the year fifty-five, Julius Caesar
may happen at any moment.'</p>

<p>'I thought you liked Caesar,' said Robert.</p>

<p>'So I do - in the history.  But that's different from being killed
by his soldiers.'</p>

<p>'If we saw Caesar we might persuade him not to,' said Anthea.</p>

<p>'YOU persuade CAESAR,' Robert laughed.</p>

<p>The learned gentleman, before anyone could stop him, said, 'I
only wish we could see Caesar some time.'</p>

<p>And, of course, in just the little time the Psammead took to blow
itself out for wish-giving, the five, or six counting the
Psammead, found themselves in Caesar's camp, just outside
Caesar's tent.  And they saw Caesar.  The Psammead must have
taken advantage of the loose wording of the learned gentleman's
wish, for it was not the same time of day as that on which the
wish had been uttered among the dried ferns.  It was sunset, and
the great man sat on a chair outside his tent gazing over the sea
towards Britain - everyone knew without being told that it was
towards Britain.  Two golden eagles on the top of posts stood on
each side of the tent, and on the flaps of the tent which was
very gorgeous to look at were the letters S.P.Q.R.</p>

<p>The great man turned unchanged on the newcomers the august glance
that he had turned on the violet waters of the Channel.  Though
they had suddenly appeared out of nothing, Caesar never showed by
the faintest movement of an eyelid, by the least tightening of
that firm mouth, that they were not some long expected embassy. 
He waved a calm hand towards the sentinels, who sprang weapons in
hand towards the newcomers.</p>

<p>'Back!' he said in a voice that thrilled like music.  'Since when
has Caesar feared children and students?'</p>

<p>To the children he seemed to speak in the only language they
knew; but the learned gentleman heard - in rather a strange
accent, but quite intelligibly - the lips of Caesar speaking in
the Latin tongue, and in that tongue, a little stiffly, he
answered - </p>

<p>'It is a dream, O Caesar.'</p>

<p>'A dream?' repeated Caesar.  'What is a dream?'</p>

<p>'This,' said the learned gentleman.</p>

<p>'Not it,' said Cyril, 'it's a sort of magic.  We come out of
another time and another place.'</p>

<p>'And we want to ask you not to trouble about conquering Britain,'
said Anthea; 'it's a poor little place, not worth bothering
about.'</p>

<p>'Are you from Britain?' the General asked.  'Your clothes are
uncouth, but well woven, and your hair is short as the hair of
Roman citizens, not long like the hair of barbarians, yet such I
deem you to be.' 'We're not,' said Jane with angry eagerness;
'we're not barbarians at all.  We come from the country where the
sun never sets, and we've read about you in books; and our
country's full of fine things - St Paul's, and the Tower of
London, and Madame Tussaud's Exhibition, and - ' Then the others
stopped her.</p>

<p>'Don't talk nonsense,' said Robert in a bitter undertone.</p>

<p>Caesar looked at the children a moment in silence.  Then he
called a soldier and spoke with him apart.  Then he said aloud - </p>

<p>'You three elder children may go where you will within the camp. 
Few children are privileged to see the camp of Caesar.  The
student and the smaller girl-child will remain here with me.'</p>

<p>Nobody liked this; but when Caesar said a thing that thing was
so, and there was an end to it.  So the three went.</p>

<p>Left alone with Jane and the learned gentleman, the great Roman
found it easy enough to turn them inside out.  But it was not
easy, even for him, to make head or tail of the insides of their
minds when he had got at them.</p>

<p>The learned gentleman insisted that the whole thing was a dream,
and refused to talk much, on the ground that if he did he would
wake up.</p>

<p>Jane, closely questioned, was full of information about railways,
electric lights, balloons, men-of-war, cannons, and dynamite.</p>

<p>'And do they fight with swords?' asked the General.</p>

<p>'Yes, swords and guns and cannons.'</p>

<p>Caesar wanted to know what guns were.</p>

<p>'You fire them,' said Jane, 'and they go bang, and people fall
down dead.'</p>

<p>'But what are guns like?'</p>

<p>Jane found them hard to describe.</p>

<p>'But Robert has a toy one in his pocket,' she said.  So the
others were recalled.</p>

<p>The boys explained the pistol to Caesar very fully, and he looked
at it with the greatest interest.  It was a two-shilling pistol,
the one that had done such good service in the old Egyptian
village.</p>

<p>'I shall cause guns to be made,' said Caesar, 'and you will be
detained till I know whether you have spoken the truth.  I had
just decided that Britain was not worth the bother of invading. 
But what you tell me decides me that it is very much worth
while.'</p>

<p>'But it's all nonsense,' said Anthea.  'Britain is just a savage
sort of island - all fogs and trees and big rivers.  But the
people are kind.  We know a little girl there named Imogen.  And
it's no use your making guns because you can't fire them without
gunpowder, and that won't be invented for hundreds of years, and
we don't know how to make it, and we can't tell you.  Do go
straight home, dear Caesar, and let poor little Britain alone.'</p>

<p>'But this other girl-child says - ' said Caesar.</p>

<p>'All Jane's been telling you is what it's going to be,' Anthea
interrupted, 'hundreds and hundreds of years from now.'</p>

<p>'The little one is a prophetess, eh?' said Caesar, with a
whimsical look.  'Rather young for the business, isn't she?'</p>

<p>'You can call her a prophetess if you like,' said Cyril, 'but
what Anthea says is true.'</p>

<p>'Anthea?' said Caesar.  'That's a Greek name.'</p>

<p>'Very likely,' said Cyril, worriedly.  'I say, I do wish you'd
give up this idea of conquering Britain.  It's not worth while,
really it isn't!'</p>

<p>'On the contrary,' said Caesar, 'what you've told me has decided
me to go, if it's only to find out what Britain is really like. 
Guards, detain these children.'</p>

<p>'Quick,' said Robert, 'before the guards begin detaining.  We had
enough of that in Babylon.'</p>

<p>Jane held up the Amulet away from the sunset, and said the word. 
The learned gentleman was pushed through and the others more
quickly than ever before passed through the arch back into their
own times and the quiet dusty sitting-room of the learned
gentleman.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that when Caesar was encamped on the coast
of Gaul - somewhere near Boulogne it was, I believe - he was
sitting before his tent in the glow of the sunset, looking out
over the violet waters of the English Channel.  Suddenly he
started, rubbed his eyes, and called his secretary.  The young
man came quickly from within the tent.</p>

<p>'Marcus,' said Caesar.  'I have dreamed a very wonderful dream. 
Some of it I forget, but I remember enough to decide what was not
before determined.  Tomorrow the ships that have been brought
round from the Ligeris shall be provisioned.  We shall sail for
this three-cornered island.  First, we will take but two legions.</p>

<p>This, if what we have heard be true, should suffice.  But if my
dream be true, then a hundred legions will not suffice.  For the
dream I dreamed was the most wonderful that ever tormented the
brain even of Caesar.  And Caesar has dreamed some strange things
in his time.'</p>

<p>'And if you hadn't told Caesar all that about how things are now,
he'd never have invaded Britain,' said Robert to Jane as they sat
down to tea.</p>

<p>'Oh, nonsense,' said Anthea, pouring out; 'it was all settled
hundreds of years ago.'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' said Cyril.  'Jam, please.  This about time being
only a thingummy of thought is very confusIng.  If everything
happens at the same time - '</p>

<p>'It CAN'T!' said Anthea stoutly, 'the present's the present and
the past's the past.'</p>

<p>'Not always,' said Cyril.</p>

<p>'When we were in the Past the present was the future.  Now then!'
he added triumphantly.</p>

<p>And Anthea could not deny it.</p>

<p>'I should have liked to see more of the camp,' said Robert.</p>

<p>'Yes, we didn't get much for our money - but Imogen is happy,
that's one thing,' said Anthea.  'We left her happy in the Past. 
I've often seen about people being happy in the Past, in poetry
books.  I see what it means now.'</p>

<p>'It's not a bad idea,' said the Psammead sleepily, putting its
head out of its bag and taking it in again suddenly, 'being left
in the Past.'</p>
