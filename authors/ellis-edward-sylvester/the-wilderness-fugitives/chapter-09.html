<p>Mr. Perkins having been allowed to relate his own story&mdash;in the
telling of which he drew a pretty long bow&mdash;his listeners judged
it was time to do something practical. He was asked therefore
whether he could inform them where to lay hands on a boat with
which to cross the Susquehanna.</p>

<p>"Do I know where a boat is?" he repeated, as if surprised at
the mere idea that he could not give the information. "Why, of
course I do. There's one only a short distance from where we are
standing this very minute."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you refer to the one which Colonel Butler appropriated
for himself," suggested Ned, whose faith in the man was considerably
lessened by what he told them.</p>

<p>"No such thing; I'll put one in your hands in five minutes, if
you will go with me."</p>

<p>The three friends looked at Lena-Wingo, as if they wished his
opinion before they assented to the proposal. The Mohawk had been
a patient listener throughout, and he nodded his head and set
the example by leading the way.</p>

<p>"Go with him&mdash;he find boat."</p>

<p>Mr. Perkins seemed to form an exalted idea of his own usefulness
by the consciousness that he was the real guide for the time being,
and he stalked off like some leader of his clan. The apprehension
that he was misleading them was quieted by the confidence which
the Mohawk showed in his offer.</p>

<p>"I don't think there's any Indians or Tories about here, and
the Lord be thanked," remarked the settler, who found it about
impossible to hold his tongue when it was once loosed; "but it
will be well to act as if there was danger at every turn now.
I advise you all to do like me&mdash;and that is, not to speak a word
when on the way through the woods&mdash;for I tell you that it is the
easiest thing in the world to let a whole tribe know your poking
round&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be still!" struck in the Mohawk, evidently angered, where the
others were only amused. "Talk too much!"</p>

<p>This peremptory summons to put a check to his clatter was accepted
in the most philosophic manner by the individual for whom the
command was intended.</p>

<p>"That's what I have always maintained," he said. "People are
ever inclined to use their tongues more than they ought."</p>

<p>"Is your gun loaded?" asked Lena-Wingo, in a more considerate
manner.</p>

<p>"Yes. I have got a double charge in her."</p>

<p>Thereupon the Indian whispered to Ned Clinton and Jo Minturn
to drop quietly behind, doing it in such a way that their disappearance
would not be noticed by their vaunting leader. The hint was acted
upon and within five minutes from the time it was given, Mr. Perkins
was conducting only the red scout through the forest, while he
supposed the three were directly in the rear of him, awed and
speechless by the stunning observations he was continually making
for their benefit.</p>

<p>"As I was about to remark when you interrupted me," continued
the loquacious settler, "there is no fault more frequent than
that of using the tongue when it should be permitted to rest,
and the Lord be thanked that weakness can never be laid to my
charge. When Mrs. Perkins and me was a-coming to our retreat in
the woods, she was so inclined to talk that I had to admonish
her several times it was likely to get us into trouble. But law
me! who ever heard of a handsome young lady that would take any
advice about talking? Mrs. Perkins is very sensitive on that subject,
and she chose to disregard what I said, and what was the consequence?
Why, my friends&mdash;it wasn't five&mdash;certainly not ten&mdash;minutes after
that, while we were picking our way along as best we could &mdash;What's
that?"</p>

<p>The settler paused in his walk and talk, like one who was suddenly
apprised that he was on the brink of some peril.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he repeated in a whisper, turning his head toward
the Mohawk, who was dimly discernible in the gloom.</p>

<p>"Iroquois Indian look for you."</p>

<p>"Good heavens and earth! You don't think so, do you?" fairly
gasped the man, trembling with affright.</p>

<p>"He Indian&mdash;he hear you talk&mdash;he come look for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, heaven! It won't do for me to stay here," whispered the
poor fellow, beginning a cautious retreat that brought him into
collision with the Mohawk, who was standing perfectly still, as
if listening for something that would tell him what the real danger
was.</p>

<p>Lena-Wingo threw him off with such force that he stumbled forward
upon his hands and knees.</p>

<p>"What the blazes are you doing?" demanded the indignant Perkins,
scrambling to his feet. "What's the use of knocking a feller over
that way?"</p>

<p>By this time he was erect and gazing, or rather glaring, back
into the gloom, as if to make sure where his man was standing
and then demolish him. But, to his amazement, his man was not
to be seen; he had fled,&mdash;driven away, as the settler believed,
by the fear of the other Indians that were so near at hand. Perkins
was silent for a moment, not knowing what he should do. Then he
called the name of the Mohawk in a cautious tone:</p>

<p>"Hello! Leaner-Winger, where are you?"</p>

<p>But the silence gave no token, and he pronounced the name of
Ned, Jo and Rosa in turn, without any further success.</p>

<p>"They've all left me," he muttered angrily. "All of them together
haven't the courage that I have alone. Wall, I can get along without
them if they can without me; but if there are Indians, I'll bet
they'll be sorry they gave me the slip. It ain't every party that's
lucky enough to have a man of my experience and skill and courage
to help them out of trouble&mdash;blazes!"</p>

<p>The bravery of the settler, which had been growing during the
silence succeeding the first alarm, suddenly collapsed when his
ear caught a sound, precisely as if some one was stealing over
the leaves toward him. There must be real danger after all!</p>

<p>"Who's there?" called Perkins, in a shiver. "If you don't answer
I'll shoot."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, no answer was evoked by such a threat and the settler
made up his mind that if he could not effect an orderly retreat
he must make some kind of a fight. Accordingly, he peered ahead
in the darkness, seeking a view of the crouching redskin, with
the purpose of giving him the whole charge of the musket.</p>

<p>"I hope there ain't more than one of them, for if there happens
to be," he said to himself, "I ain't likely to get a chance to
reload before they come down on me. It was an infernal mean piece
of business in that crowd to sneak off that way and leave me in
the lurch just when I was likely to need their help."</p>

<p>While he was muttering in his endless fashion, he was still retreating
as stealthily as possible, hoping to get far enough off from the
dangerous spot to give himself a chance to make a run for some
safe concealment. He had taken only a step or two, when he was
hailed from somewhere in the gloom ahead.</p>

<p>"Stop, white man, or me take scalp!"</p>

<p>The settler paused at this fearful summons and his knees smote
together.</p>

<p>"Wh-wh-what do yo-yo-you want?" he stammered, hardly conscious
of what he was saying.</p>

<p>"Want your scalp, white man."</p>

<p>"Thunderation! I hain't got any! My wife pulled out all my hair
the first week we were married. I'm bald-headed, so what's the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" broke in the voice of the hidden Indian, who seemed to
know that he was trying to steal away.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?" asked the victim, showing a disposition
to argue the matter.</p>

<p>"Want your scalp! Come up&mdash;hand it to me."</p>

<p>This was more than flesh and blood could stand. With a howl of
terror the settler whirled around and dashed into the depths of
the forest, never pausing long enough to notice that the voice
which addressed such terrifying words to him was that of Lena-Wingo,
the Mohawk.</p>
