<p>To Neeland, the entire affair had seemed as though it were some
rather obvious screen-picture at which he was looking&mdash;some photo-play
too crudely staged, and in which he himself was no more concerned
than any casual spectator.</p>

<p>Until now, Neeland had not been scared; Ali Baba and his automatic
pistol were only part of this unreality; his appearance on the
scene had been fantastically classical; he entered when his cue
was given by Scheherazade&mdash;this oily, hawk-nosed Eurasian with
his pale eyes set too closely and his moustache hiding under his
nose à la Enver Pasha&mdash;a faultless make-up, an entry properly
timed and prepared. And then, always well-timed for dramatic effect,
Golden Beard had appeared. Everything was <em>en règle</em>, every
unity nicely preserved. Scheherazade had protested; and her protest
sounded genuine. Also entirely convincing was the binding and
gagging of himself at the point of an automatic pistol; and, as
for the rest of the business, it was practically all action and
little dialogue&mdash;an achievement really in these days of dissertation.</p>

<p>All, as he looked on at it over the bandage which closed his
mouth, had seemed unreal, impersonal, even when his forced attitude
had caused him inconvenience and finally pain.</p>

<p>But now, with the light extinguished and the closing of the door
behind Golden Beard and Ali Baba, he experienced a shock which
began to awaken him to the almost incredible and instant reality
of things.</p>

<p>It actually began to look as though these story-book conspirators&mdash;these
hirelings of a foreign government who had not been convincing
because they were too obvious, too well done&mdash;actually intended
to expose him to serious injury.</p>

<p>In spite of their sinister intentions in regard to him, in spite
of their attempts to harm him, he had not, so far, been able to
take them seriously or even to reconcile them and their behaviour
with the commonplaces of the twentieth century in which he lived.</p>

<p>But now, in the darkness, with the clock on the washstand shelf
ticking steadily, he began to take the matter very seriously.
The gag in his mouth hurt him cruelly; the bands of linen that
held it in began to stifle him so that his breath came in quick
gasps through his nostrils; sweat started at the roots of his
hair; his heart leaped, beat madly, stood still, and leaped again;
and he threw himself against the strips that held him and twisted
and writhed with all his strength.</p>

<p>Suddenly fear pierced him like a poignard; for a moment panic
seized him and chaos reigned in his bursting brain. He swayed
and strained convulsively; he strove to hurl all the inward and
inert reserve of strength against the bonds that held him.</p>

<p>After what seemed an age of terrible effort he found himself
breathing fast and heavily as though his lungs would burst through
his straining, dilating nostrils, seated exactly as he had been
without a band loosened, and the icy sweat pouring over his twitching
face.</p>

<p>He heard himself trying to shout&mdash;heard the imprisoned groan
shattered in his own throat, dying there within him.</p>

<p>Suddenly a key rattled; the door was torn open; the light switched
on. Golden Beard stood there, his blue eyes glaring furious inquiry.
He gave one glance around the room, caught sight of the clock,
recoiled, shut off the light again, and slammed and locked the
door.</p>

<p>But in that instant Neeland's starting eyes had seen the clock.
The fixed hands on one of the dials still pointed to 2:13; the
moving hands on the other lacked three minutes of that hour.</p>

<p>And, seated there in the pitch darkness, he suddenly realised
that he had only three minutes more of life on earth.</p>

<p>All panic was gone; his mind was quite clear. He heard every
tick of the clock and knew what each one meant.</p>

<p>Also he heard a sudden sound across the room, as though outside
the port something was rustling against the ship's side.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a click and the room sprang into full light;
an arm, entering the open port from the darkness outside, let
go the electric button, was withdrawn, only to reappear immediately
clutching an automatic pistol. And the next instant the arm and
the head of Ilse Dumont were thrust through the port into the
room.</p>

<p>Her face was pale as death as her eyes fell on the dial of the
clock. With a gasp she stretched out her arm and fired straight
at the clock, shattering both dials and knocking the timepiece
into the washbasin below.</p>

<p>For a moment she struggled to force her other shoulder and her
body through the port, but it was too narrow. Then she called
across to the bound figure seated on the bed and staring at her
with eyes that fairly started from their sockets:</p>

<p>"Mr. Neeland, can't you move? Try! Try to break loose&#11834;"</p>

<p>Her voice died away in a whisper as a flash of bluish flame broke
out close to the ceiling overhead, where the three bombs were
slung.</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" she faltered. "The fuses are afire!"</p>

<p>For an instant her brain reeled; she instinctively recoiled as
though to fling herself out into the darkness. Then, in a second,
her extended arm grew rigid, slanted upward; the pistol exploded
once, twice, the third time; the lighted bombs in their sling,
released by the severed rope, fell to the bed, the fuses sputtering
and fizzling.</p>

<p>Instantly the girl fired again at the big jug of water on the
bracket over the head of the bed; a deluge drenched the bed underneath;
two fuses were out; one still snapped and glimmered and sent up
little jets and rings of vapour; but as the water soaked into
the match the cinder slowly died until the last spark fell from
the charred wet end and went out on the drenched blanket.</p>

<p>She waited a little longer, then with an indescribable look at
the helpless man below, she withdrew her head, pushed herself
free, hung to the invisible rope ladder for a moment, swaying
against the open port. His eyes were fastened on her where she
dangled there against the darkness betwixt sky and sea, oscillating
with the movement of the ship, her pendant figure now gilded by
the light from the room, now phantom dim as she swung outward.</p>

<p>As the roll of the ship brought her head to the level of the
port once more, she held up her pistol, shook it, and laughed
at him:</p>

<p>"Now do you believe that I can shoot?" she called out. "Answer
me some time when that mocking tongue of yours is free!"</p>

<p>Then, climbing slowly upward into darkness, the light, falling
now across her body, now athwart her skirt, gilded at last the
heels of her shoes; suddenly she was gone; then stars glittered
through the meshes of the shadowy, twitching ladder which still
barred the open port. And finally the ladder was pulled upward
out of sight.</p>

<p>He waited. After a little while&mdash;an interminable interval to
him&mdash;he heard somebody stealthily trying the handle of the door;
then came a pause, silence, followed by a metallic noise as though
the lock were being explored or picked.</p>

<p>For a while the scraping, metallic sounds continued steadily,
then abruptly ceased as though the unseen meddler had been interrupted.</p>

<p>A voice&mdash;evidently the voice of the lock-picker&mdash;pitched to a
cautious key, was heard in protest as though objecting to some
intentions evident in the new arrival. Whispered expostulations
continued for a while, then the voices became quarrelsome and
louder; and somebody suddenly rapped on the door.</p>

<p>Then a thick, soft voice that he recognised with a chill, grew
angrily audible:</p>

<p>"I say to you, steward, that I forbid you to entaire that room.
I forbid you to disturb thees yoong lady. Do you know who I am?"</p>

<p>"I don't care who you are&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I have authority. I shall employ it. You shall lose your berth!
Thees yoong lady within thees room ees my fiancée! I forbid you
to enter forcibly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Haven't I knocked? Wot's spilin' you? I am doing my duty. Back
away from this 'ere door, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"You spik thees-a-way, so impolite&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Get out o' my way! Blime d'you think I'll stand 'ere jawin'
any longer?"</p>

<p>"I am membaire of Parliament&#11834;"</p>

<p>And the defiant voice of Jim's own little cockney steward retorted,
interrupting:</p>

<p>"Ahr, stow it! Don't I tell you as how a lydy telephones me just
now that my young gentleman is in there? Get away from that door,
you blighter, or I'll bash your beak in!"</p>

<p>The door trembled under a sudden and terrific kick; the wordy
quarrel ceased; hurried steps retreated along the corridor; a
pass key rattled in the lock, and the door was flung wide open:</p>

<p>"Mr. Neeland, sir&mdash;oh, my Gawd, wot ever 'ave they gone and done,
sir, to find you 'ere in such a 'orrid state!"</p>

<p>But the little cockney lost no time; fingers and pen-knife flew;
Neeland, his arms free, tore the bandage from his mouth and spat
out the wad of cloth.</p>

<p>"I'll do the rest," he gasped, forcing the words from his bruised
and distorted lips; "follow that man who was outside talking to
you! Find him if you can. He had been planning to blow up this
ship!"</p>

<p>"<em>That</em> man, sir!"</p>

<p>"Yes! Did you know him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but I darsn't let on to him I knew him&mdash;what with
'earing that you was in here&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You <em>did</em> know him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Neeland, sir, that there cove is wot he says he is, a member
of Parliament, and his name is Wilson&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You're mad! He's an Eurasian, a spy; his name is Karl Breslau
&mdash;I heard it from the others&mdash;and he tried to blow up the
captain's cabin and the bridge with those three bombs lying there
on the bed!"</p>

<p>"My God, sir&mdash;what you tell me may be so, but what I say is true,
sir; that gentleman you heard talking outside the door to me is
Charles Wilson, member of Parliament, representing Glebe and Wotherness;
and I knew it w'en I 'anded 'im the 'ot stuff!&mdash;'strewth I did,
sir&mdash;and took my chance you'd 'elp me out if I got in too rotten
with the company!"</p>

<p>Neeland said:</p>

<p>"Certainly you may count on me. You're a brick!" He continued
to rub and slap and pinch his arms and legs to restore the circulation,
and finally ventured to rise to his shaky feet. The steward offered
an arm; together they hobbled to the door, summoned another steward,
placed him in charge of the room, and went on in quest of Captain
West, to whom an immediate report was now imperative.</p>
