<P>On the following evening, as we have said, Rosa returned 
with the Bible of Cornelius de Witt.</P>
<P>Then began between the master and the pupil one of those 
charming scenes which are the delight of the novelist who 
has to describe them.</P>
<P>The grated window, the only opening through which the two 
lovers were able to communicate, was too high for 
conveniently reading a book, although it had been quite 
convenient for them to read each other's faces.</P>
<P>Rosa therefore had to press the open book against the 
grating edgewise, holding above it in her right hand the 
lamp, but Cornelius hit upon the lucky idea of fixing it to 
the bars, so as to afford her a little rest. Rosa was then 
enabled to follow with her finger the letters and syllables, 
which she was to spell for Cornelius, who with a straw 
pointed out the letters to his attentive pupil through the 
holes of the grating.</P>
<P>The light of the lamp illuminated the rich complexion of 
Rosa, her blue liquid eyes, and her golden hair under her 
head-dress of gold brocade, with her fingers held up, and 
showing in the blood, as it flowed downwards in the veins 
that pale pink hue which shines before the light owing to 
the living transparency of the flesh tint.</P>
<P>Rosa's intellect rapidly developed itself under the 
animating influence of Cornelius, and when the difficulties 
seemed too arduous, the sympathy of two loving hearts seemed 
to smooth them away.</P>
<P>And Rosa, after having returned to her room, repeated in her 
solitude the reading lessons, and at the same time recalled 
all the delight which she had felt whilst receiving them.</P>
<P>One evening she came half an hour later than usual. This was 
too extraordinary an instance not to call forth at once 
Cornelius's inquiries after its cause.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! do not be angry with me,&quot; she said, &quot;it is not my 
fault. My father has renewed an acquaintance with an old 
crony who used to visit him at the Hague, and to ask him to 
let him see the prison. He is a good sort of fellow, fond of 
his bottle, tells funny stories, and moreover is very free 
with his money, so as always to be ready to stand a treat.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You don't know anything further of him?&quot; asked Cornelius, 
surprised.</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; she answered; &quot;it's only for about a fortnight that my 
father has taken such a fancy to this friend who is so 
assiduous in visiting him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, so,&quot; said Cornelius, shaking his head uneasily as every 
new incident seemed to him to forebode some catastrophe; 
&quot;very likely some spy, one of those who are sent into jails 
to watch both prisoners and their keepers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't believe that,&quot; said Rosa, smiling; &quot;if that worthy 
person is spying after any one, it is certainly not after my 
father.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;After whom, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Me, for instance.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why not?&quot; said Rosa, smiling.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, that's true,&quot; Cornelius observed, with a sigh. &quot;You 
will not always have suitors in vain; this man may become 
your husband.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't say anything to the contrary.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What cause have you to entertain such a happy prospect?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Rather say, this fear, Mynheer Cornelius.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you, Rosa, you are right; well, I will say then, this 
fear?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have only this reason  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tell me, I am anxious to hear.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This man came several times before to the Buytenhof, at the 
Hague. I remember now, it was just about the time when you 
were confined there. When I left, he left too; when I came 
here, he came after me. At the Hague his pretext was that he 
wanted to see you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;See me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, it must have undoubtedly been only a pretext for now, 
when he could plead the same reason, as you are my father's 
prisoner again, he does not care any longer for you; quite 
the contrary,  -  I heard him say to my father only yesterday 
that he did not know you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Go on, Rosa, pray do, that I may guess who that man is, and 
what he wants.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you quite sure, Mynheer Cornelius, that none of your 
friends can interest himself for you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have no friends, Rosa; I have only my old nurse, whom you 
know, and who knows you. Alas, poor Sue! she would come 
herself, and use no roundabout ways. She would at once say 
to your father, or to you, 'My good sir, or my good miss, my 
child is here; see how grieved I am; let me see him only for 
one hour, and I'll pray for you as long as I live.' No, no,&quot; 
continued Cornelius; &quot;with the exception of my poor old Sue, 
I have no friends in this world.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then I come back to what I thought before; and the more so 
as last evening at sunset, whilst I was arranging the border 
where I am to plant your bulb, I saw a shadow gliding 
between the alder trees and the aspens. I did not appear to 
see him, but it was this man. He concealed himself and saw 
me digging the ground, and certainly it was me whom he 
followed, and me whom he was spying after. I could not move 
my rake, or touch one atom of soil, without his noticing 
it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, yes, yes, he is in love with you,&quot; said Cornelius. &quot;Is 
he young? Is he handsome?&quot;</P>
<P>Saying this he looked anxiously at Rosa, eagerly waiting for 
her answer.</P>
<P>&quot;Young? handsome?&quot; cried Rosa, bursting into a laugh. &quot;He is 
hideous to look at; crooked, nearly fifty years of age, and 
never dares to look me in the face, or to speak, except in 
an undertone.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And his name?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Jacob Gisels.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then you see that, at all events, he does not come after 
you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At any rate, if he loves you, Rosa, which is very likely, 
as to see you is to love you, at least you don't love him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To be sure I don't.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then you wish me to keep my mind easy?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I should certainly ask you to do so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, now as you begin to know how to read you will 
read all that I write to you of the pangs of jealousy and of 
absence, won't you, Rosa?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I shall read it, if you write with good big letters.&quot;</P>
<P>Then, as the turn which the conversation took began to make 
Rosa uneasy, she asked,  - </P>
<P>&quot;By the bye, how is your tulip going on?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, Rosa, only imagine my joy, this morning I looked at it 
in the sun, and after having moved the soil aside which 
covers the bulb, I saw the first sprouting of the leaves. 
This small germ has caused me a much greater emotion than 
the order of his Highness which turned aside the sword 
already raised at the Buytenhof.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You hope, then?&quot; said Rosa, smiling.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes, I hope.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And I, in my turn, when shall I plant my bulb?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, the first favourable day I will tell you; but, whatever 
you do, let nobody help you, and don't confide your secret 
to any one in the world; do you see, a connoisseur by merely 
looking at the bulb would be able to distinguish its value; 
and so, my dearest Rosa, be careful in locking up the third 
sucker which remains to you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is still wrapped up in the same paper in which you put 
it, and just as you gave it me. I have laid it at the bottom 
of my chest under my point lace, which keeps it dry, without 
pressing upon it. But good night, my poor captive 
gentleman.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How? already?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It must be, it must be.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Coming so late and going so soon.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My father might grow impatient not seeing me return, and 
that precious lover might suspect a rival.&quot;</P>
<P>Here she listened uneasily.</P>
<P>&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Van Baerle. &quot;I thought I heard 
something.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Something like a step, creaking on the staircase.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Surely,&quot; said the prisoner, &quot;that cannot be Master Gryphus, 
he is always heard at a distance&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, it is not my father, I am quite sure, but  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But it might be Mynheer Jacob.&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa rushed toward the staircase, and a door was really 
heard rapidly to close before the young damsel had got down 
the first ten steps.</P>
<P>Cornelius was very uneasy about it, but it was after all 
only a prelude to greater anxieties.</P>
<P>The flowing day passed without any remarkable incident. 
Gryphus made his three visits, and discovered nothing. He 
never came at the same hours as he hoped thus to discover 
the secrets of the prisoner. Van Baerle, therefore, had 
devised a contrivance, a sort of pulley, by means of which 
he was able to lower or to raise his jug below the ledge of 
tiles and stone before his window. The strings by which this 
was effected he had found means to cover with that moss 
which generally grows on tiles, or in the crannies of the 
walls.</P>
<P>Gryphus suspected nothing, and the device succeeded for 
eight days. One morning, however, when Cornelius, absorbed 
in the contemplation of his bulb, from which a germ of 
vegetation was already peeping forth, had not heard old 
Gryphus coming upstairs as a gale of wind was blowing which 
shook the whole tower, the door suddenly opened.</P>
<P>Gryphus, perceiving an unknown and consequently a forbidden 
object in the hands of his prisoner, pounced upon it with 
the same rapidity as the hawk on its prey.</P>
<P>As ill luck would have it, his coarse, hard hand, the same 
which he had broken, and which Cornelius van Baerle had set 
so well, grasped at once in the midst of the jug, on the 
spot where the bulb was lying in the soil.</P>
<P>&quot;What have you got here?&quot; he roared. &quot;Ah! have I caught 
you?&quot; and with this he grabbed in the soil.</P>
<P>&quot;I? nothing, nothing,&quot; cried Cornelius, trembling.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! have I caught you? a jug and earth in it There is some 
criminal secret at the bottom of all this.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, my good Master Gryphus,&quot; said Van Baerle, imploringly, 
and anxious as the partridge robbed of her young by the 
reaper.</P>
<P>In fact, Gryphus was beginning to dig the soil with his 
crooked fingers.</P>
<P>&quot;Take care, sir, take care,&quot; said Cornelius, growing quite 
pale.</P>
<P>&quot;Care of what? Zounds! of what?&quot; roared the jailer.</P>
<P>&quot;Take care, I say, you will crush it, Master Gryphus.&quot;</P>
<P>And with a rapid and almost frantic movement he snatched the 
jug from the hands of Gryphus, and hid it like a treasure 
under his arms.</P>
<P>But Gryphus, obstinate, like an old man, and more and more 
convinced that he was discovering here a conspiracy against 
the Prince of Orange, rushed up to his prisoner, raising his 
stick; seeing, however, the impassible resolution of the 
captive to protect his flower-pot he was convinced that 
Cornelius trembled much less for his head than for his jug.</P>
<P>He therefore tried to wrest it from him by force.</P>
<P>&quot;Halloa!&quot; said the jailer, furious, &quot;here, you see, you are 
rebelling.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Leave me my tulip,&quot; cried Van Baerle.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, yes, tulip,&quot; replied the old man, &quot;we know well the 
shifts of prisoners.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But I vow to you  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let go,&quot; repeated Gryphus, stamping his foot, &quot;let go, or I 
shall call the guard.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Call whoever you like, but you shall not have this flower 
except with my life.&quot;</P>
<P>Gryphus, exasperated, plunged his finger a second time into 
the soil, and now he drew out the bulb, which certainly 
looked quite black; and whilst Van Baerle, quite happy to 
have saved the vessel, did not suspect that the adversary 
had possessed himself of its precious contents, Gryphus 
hurled the softened bulb with all his force on the flags, 
where almost immediately after it was crushed to atoms under 
his heavy shoe.</P>
<P>Van Baerle saw the work of destruction, got a glimpse of the 
juicy remains of his darling bulb, and, guessing the cause 
of the ferocious joy of Gryphus, uttered a cry of agony, 
which would have melted the heart even of that ruthless 
jailer who some years before killed Pelisson's spider.</P>
<P>The idea of striking down this spiteful bully passed like 
lightning through the brain of the tulip-fancier. The blood 
rushed to his brow, and seemed like fire in his eyes, which 
blinded him, and he raised in his two hands the heavy jug 
with all the now useless earth which remained in it. One 
instant more, and he would have flung it on the bald head of 
old Gryphus.</P>
<P>But a cry stopped him; a cry of agony, uttered by poor Rosa, 
who, trembling and pale, with her arms raised to heaven, 
made her appearance behind the grated window, and thus 
interposed between her father and her friend.</P>
<P>Gryphus then understood the danger with which he had been 
threatened, and he broke out in a volley of the most 
terrible abuse.</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed,&quot; said Cornelius to him, &quot;you must be a very mean 
and spiteful fellow to rob a poor prisoner of his only 
consolation, a tulip bulb.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For shame, my father,&quot; Rosa chimed in, &quot;it is indeed a 
crime you have committed here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, is that you, my little chatter-box?&quot; the old man cried, 
boiling with rage and turning towards her; &quot;don't you meddle 
with what don't concern you, but go down as quickly as 
possible.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Unfortunate me,&quot; continued Cornelius, overwhelmed with 
grief.</P>
<P>&quot;After all, it is but a tulip,&quot; Gryphus resumed, as he began 
to be a little ashamed of himself. &quot;You may have as many 
tulips as you like: I have three hundred of them in my 
loft.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To the devil with your tulips!&quot; cried Cornelius; &quot;you are 
worthy of each other: had I a hundred thousand millions of 
them, I would gladly give them for the one which you have 
just destroyed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, so!&quot; Gryphus said, in a tone of triumph; &quot;now there we 
have it. It was not your tulip you cared for. There was in 
that false bulb some witchcraft, perhaps some means of 
correspondence with conspirators against his Highness who 
has granted you your life. I always said they were wrong in 
not cutting your head off.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Father, father!&quot; cried Rosa.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes! it is better as it is now,&quot; repeated Gryphus, 
growing warm; &quot;I have destroyed it, and I'll do the same 
again, as often as you repeat the trick. Didn't I tell you, 
my fine fellow, that I would make your life a hard one?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A curse on you!&quot; Cornelius exclaimed, quite beyond himself 
with despair, as he gathered, with his trembling fingers, 
the remnants of that bulb on which he had rested so many 
joys and so many hopes.</P>
<P>&quot;We shall plant the other to-morrow, my dear Mynheer 
Cornelius,&quot; said Rosa, in a low voice, who understood the 
intense grief of the unfortunate tulip-fancier, and who, 
with the pure sacred love of her innocent heart, poured 
these kind words, like a drop of balm, on the bleeding 
wounds of Cornelius. </P></div>
