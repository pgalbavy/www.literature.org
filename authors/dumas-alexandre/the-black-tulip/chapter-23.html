<P>And in fact the poor young people were in great need of protection.</P>
<P>They had never been so near the destruction of their hopes 
as at this moment, when they thought themselves certain of 
their fulfilment.</P>
<P>The reader cannot but have recognized in Jacob our old 
friend, or rather enemy, Isaac Boxtel, and has guessed, no 
doubt, that this worthy had followed from the Buytenhof to 
Loewestein the object of his love and the object of his 
hatred,  -  the black tulip and Cornelius van Baerle.</P>
<P>What no one but a tulip-fancier, and an envious 
tulip-fancier, could have discovered,  -  the existence of 
the bulbs and the endeavours of the prisoner,  -  jealousy 
had enabled Boxtel, if not to discover, at least to guess.</P>
<P>We have seen him, more successful under the name of Jacob 
than under that of Isaac, gain the friendship of Gryphus, 
which for several months he cultivated by means of the best 
Genievre ever distilled from the Texel to Antwerp, and he 
lulled the suspicion of the jealous turnkey by holding out 
to him the flattering prospect of his designing to marry 
Rosa.</P>
<P>Besides thus offering a bait to the ambition of the father, 
he managed, at the same time, to interest his zeal as a 
jailer, picturing to him in the blackest colours the learned 
prisoner whom Gryphus had in his keeping, and who, as the 
sham Jacob had it, was in league with Satan, to the 
detriment of his Highness the Prince of Orange.</P>
<P>At first he had also made some way with Rosa; not, indeed, 
in her affections, but inasmuch as, by talking to her of 
marriage and of love, he had evaded all the suspicions which 
he might otherwise have excited.</P>
<P>We have seen how his imprudence in following Rosa into the 
garden had unmasked him in the eyes of the young damsel, and 
how the instinctive fears of Cornelius had put the two 
lovers on their guard against him.</P>
<P>The reader will remember that the first cause of uneasiness 
was given to the prisoner by the rage of Jacob when Gryphus 
crushed the first bulb. In that moment Boxtel's exasperation 
was the more fierce, as, though suspecting that Cornelius 
possessed a second bulb, he by no means felt sure of it.</P>
<P>From that moment he began to dodge the steps of Rosa, not 
only following her to the garden, but also to the lobbies.</P>
<P>Only as this time he followed her in the night, and 
bare-footed, he was neither seen nor heard except once, when 
Rosa thought she saw something like a shadow on the 
staircase.</P>
<P>Her discovery, however, was made too late, as Boxtel had 
heard from the mouth of the prisoner himself that a second 
bulb existed.</P>
<P>Taken in by the stratagem of Rosa, who had feigned to put it 
in the ground, and entertaining no doubt that this little 
farce had been played in order to force him to betray 
himself, he redoubled his precaution, and employed every 
means suggested by his crafty nature to watch the others 
without being watched himself.</P>
<P>He saw Rosa conveying a large flower-pot of white 
earthenware from her father's kitchen to her bedroom. He saw 
Rosa washing in pails of water her pretty little hands, 
begrimed as they were with the mould which she had handled, 
to give her tulip the best soil possible.</P>
<P>And at last he hired, just opposite Rosa's window, a little 
attic, distant enough not to allow him to be recognized with 
the naked eye, but sufficiently near to enable him, with the 
help of his telescope, to watch everything that was going on 
at the Loewestein in Rosa's room, just as at Dort he had 
watched the dry-room of Cornelius.</P>
<P>He had not been installed more than three days in his attic 
before all his doubts were removed.</P>
<P>From morning to sunset the flower-pot was in the window, 
and, like those charming female figures of Mieris and 
Metzys, Rosa appeared at that window as in a frame, formed 
by the first budding sprays of the wild vine and the 
honeysuckle encircling her window.</P>
<P>Rosa watched the flower-pot with an interest which betrayed 
to Boxtel the real value of the object enclosed in it.</P>
<P>This object could not be anything else but the second bulb, 
that is to say, the quintessence of all the hopes of the 
prisoner.</P>
<P>When the nights threatened to be too cold, Rosa took in the 
flower-pot.</P>
<P>Well, it was then quite evident she was following the 
instructions of Cornelius, who was afraid of the bulb being 
killed by frost.</P>
<P>When the sun became too hot, Rosa likewise took in the pot 
from eleven in the morning until two in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Another proof: Cornelius was afraid lest the soil should 
become too dry.</P>
<P>But when the first leaves peeped out of the earth Boxtel was 
fully convinced; and his telescope left him no longer in any 
uncertainty before they had grown one inch in height.</P>
<P>Cornelius possessed two bulbs, and the second was intrusted 
to the love and care of Rosa.</P>
<P>For it may well be imagined that the tender secret of the 
two lovers had not escaped the prying curiosity of Boxtel.</P>
<P>The question, therefore, was how to wrest the second bulb 
from the care of Rosa.</P>
<P>Certainly this was no easy task.</P>
<P>Rosa watched over her tulip as a mother over her child, or a 
dove over her eggs.</P>
<P>Rosa never left her room during the day, and, more than 
that, strange to say, she never left it in the evening.</P>
<P>For seven days Boxtel in vain watched Rosa; she was always 
at her post.</P>
<P>This happened during those seven days which made Cornelius 
so unhappy, depriving him at the same time of all news of 
Rosa and of his tulip.</P>
<P>Would the coolness between Rosa and Cornelius last for ever?</P>
<P>This would have made the theft much more difficult than 
Mynheer Isaac had at first expected.</P>
<P>We say the theft, for Isaac had simply made up his mind to 
steal the tulip; and as it grew in the most profound 
secrecy, and as, moreover, his word, being that of a 
renowned tulip-grower, would any day be taken against that 
of an unknown girl without any knowledge of horticulture, or 
against that of a prisoner convicted of high treason, he 
confidently hoped that, having once got possession of the 
bulb, he would be certain to obtain the prize; and then the 
tulip, instead of being called Tulipa nigra Barlaensis, 
would go down to posterity under the name of Tulipa nigra 
Boxtellensis or Boxtellea.</P>
<P>Mynheer Isaac had not yet quite decided which of these two 
names he would give to the tulip, but, as both meant the 
same thing, this was, after all, not the important point.</P>
<P>The point was to steal the tulip. But in order that Boxtel 
might steal the tulip, it was necessary that Rosa should 
leave her room.</P>
<P>Great therefore was his joy when he saw the usual evening 
meetings of the lovers resumed.</P>
<P>He first of all took advantage of Rosa's absence to make 
himself fully acquainted with all the peculiarities of the 
door of her chamber. The lock was a double one and in good 
order, but Rosa always took the key with her.</P>
<P>Boxtel at first entertained an idea of stealing the key, but 
it soon occurred to him, not only that it would be 
exceedingly difficult to abstract it from her pocket, but 
also that, when she perceived her loss, she would not leave 
her room until the lock was changed, and then Boxtel's first 
theft would be useless.</P>
<P>He thought it, therefore, better to employ a different 
expedient. He collected as many keys as he could, and tried 
all of them during one of those delightful hours which Rosa 
and Cornelius passed together at the grating of the cell.</P>
<P>Two of the keys entered the lock, and one of them turned 
round once, but not the second time.</P>
<P>There was, therefore, only a little to be done to this key.</P>
<P>Boxtel covered it with a slight coat of wax, and when he 
thus renewed the experiment, the obstacle which prevented 
the key from being turned a second time left its impression 
on the wax.</P>
<P>It cost Boxtel two days more to bring his key to perfection, 
with the aid of a small file.</P>
<P>Rosa's door thus opened without noise and without 
difficulty, and Boxtel found himself in her room alone with 
the tulip.</P>
<P>The first guilty act of Boxtel had been to climb over a wall 
in order to dig up the tulip; the second, to introduce 
himself into the dry-room of Cornelius, through an open 
window; and the third, to enter Rosa's room by means of a 
false key.</P>
<P>Thus envy urged Boxtel on with rapid steps in the career of 
crime.</P>
<P>Boxtel, as we have said, was alone with the tulip.</P>
<P>A common thief would have taken the pot under his arm, and 
carried it off.</P>
<P>But Boxtel was not a common thief, and he reflected.</P>
<P>It was not yet certain, although very probable, that the 
tulip would flower black; if, therefore, he stole it now, he 
not only might be committing a useless crime, but also the 
theft might be discovered in the time which must elapse 
until the flower should open.</P>
<P>He therefore  -  as being in possession of the key, he might 
enter Rosa's chamber whenever he liked  -  thought it better 
to wait and to take it either an hour before or after 
opening, and to start on the instant to Haarlem, where the 
tulip would be before the judges of the committee before any 
one else could put in a reclamation.</P>
<P>Should any one then reclaim it, Boxtel would in his turn 
charge him or her with theft.</P>
<P>This was a deep-laid scheme, and quite worthy of its author.</P>
<P>Thus, every evening during that delightful hour which the 
two lovers passed together at the grated window, Boxtel 
entered Rosa's chamber to watch the progress which the black 
tulip had made towards flowering.</P>
<P>On the evening at which we have arrived he was going to 
enter according to custom; but the two lovers, as we have 
seen, only exchanged a few words before Cornelius sent Rosa 
back to watch over the tulip.</P>
<P>Seeing Rosa enter her room ten minutes after she had left 
it, Boxtel guessed that the tulip had opened, or was about 
to open.</P>
<P>During that night, therefore, the great blow was to be 
struck. Boxtel presented himself before Gryphus with a 
double supply of Genievre, that is to say, with a bottle in 
each pocket.</P>
<P>Gryphus being once fuddled, Boxtel was very nearly master of 
the house.</P>
<P>At eleven o'clock Gryphus was dead drunk. At two in the 
morning Boxtel saw Rosa leaving the chamber; but evidently 
she held in her arms something which she carried with great 
care.</P>
<P>He did not doubt that this was the black tulip which was in 
flower.</P>
<P>But what was she going to do with it? Would she set out that 
instant to Haarlem with it?</P>
<P>It was not possible that a young girl should undertake such 
a journey alone during the night.</P>
<P>Was she only going to show the tulip to Cornelius? This was 
more likely.</P>
<P>He followed Rosa in his stocking feet, walking on tiptoe.</P>
<P>He saw her approach the grated window. He heard her calling 
Cornelius. By the light of the dark lantern he saw the tulip 
open, and black as the night in which he was hidden.</P>
<P>He heard the plan concerted between Cornelius and Rosa to 
send a messenger to Haarlem. He saw the lips of the lovers 
meet, and then heard Cornelius send Rosa away.</P>
<P>He saw Rosa extinguish the light and return to her chamber. 
Ten minutes after, he saw her leave the room again, and lock 
it twice.</P>
<P>Boxtel, who saw all this whilst hiding himself on the 
landing-place of the staircase above, descended step by step 
from his story as Rosa descended from hers; so that, when 
she touched with her light foot the lowest step of the 
staircase, Boxtel touched with a still lighter hand the lock 
of Rosa's chamber.</P>
<P>And in that hand, it must be understood, he held the false 
key which opened Rosa's door as easily as did the real one.</P>
<P>And this is why, in the beginning of the chapter, we said 
that the poor young people were in great need of the 
protection of God. </P></article>
