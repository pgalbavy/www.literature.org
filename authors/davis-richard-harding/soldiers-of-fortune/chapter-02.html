<p>A year before Mrs. Porter's dinner a tramp steamer on her way to the
capital of Brazil had steered so close to the shores of Olancho that
her solitary passenger could look into the caverns the waves had
tunnelled in the limestone cliffs along the coast. The solitary
passenger was Robert Clay, and he made a guess that the white palisades
which fringed the base of the mountains along the shore had been forced
up above the level of the sea many years before by some volcanic
action.  Olancho, as many people know, is situated on the northeastern
coast of South America, and its shores are washed by the main
equatorial current.  From the deck of a passing vessel you can obtain
but little idea of Olancho or of the abundance and tropical beauty
which lies hidden away behind the rampart of mountains on her shore.
You can see only their desolate dark-green front, and the white caves
at their base, into which the waves rush with an echoing roar, and in
and out of which fly continually thousands of frightened bats.
</p><p>The mining engineer on the rail of the tramp steamer observed this
peculiar formation of the coast with listless interest, until he noted,
when the vessel stood some thirty miles north of the harbor of
Valencia, that the limestone formation had disappeared, and that the
waves now beat against the base of the mountains themselves.  There
were five of these mountains which jutted out into the ocean, and they
suggested roughly the five knuckles of a giant hand clenched and lying
flat upon the surface of the water.  They extended for seven miles, and
then the caverns in the palisades began again and continued on down the
coast to the great cliffs that guard the harbor of Olancho's capital.
</p><p>"The waves tunnelled their way easily enough until they ran up against
those five mountains," mused the engineer, "and then they had to fall
back."  He walked to the captain's cabin and asked to look at a map of
the coast line.  "I believe I won't go to Rio," he said later in the
day; "I think I will drop off here at Valencia."
</p><p>So he left the tramp steamer at that place and disappeared into the
interior with an ox-cart and a couple of pack-mules, and returned to
write a lengthy letter from the Consul's office to a Mr. Langham in the
United States, knowing he was largely interested in mines and in
mining.  "There are five mountains filled with ore," Clay wrote, "which
should be extracted by open-faced workings.  I saw great masses of red
hematite lying exposed on the side of the mountain, only waiting a pick
and shovel, and at one place there were five thousand tons in plain
sight.  I should call the stuff first-class Bessemer ore, running about
sixty-three per cent metallic iron.  The people know it is there, but
have no knowledge of its value, and are too lazy to ever work it
themselves.  As to transportation, it would only be necessary to run a
freight railroad twenty miles along the sea-coast to the harbor of
Valencia and dump your ore from your own pier into your own vessels.
It would not, I think, be possible to ship direct from the mines
themselves, even though, as I say, the ore runs right down into the
water, because there is no place at which it would be safe for a large
vessel to touch.  I will look into the political side of it and see
what sort of a concession I can get for you.  I should think ten per
cent of the output would satisfy them, and they would, of course, admit
machinery and plant free of duty."
</p><p>Six months after this communication had arrived in New York City, the
Valencia Mining Company was formally incorporated, and a man named Van
Antwerp, with two hundred workmen and a half-dozen assistants, was sent
South to lay out the freight railroad, to erect the dumping-pier, and
to strip the five mountains of their forests and underbrush.  It was
not a task for a holiday, but a stern, difficult, and perplexing
problem, and Van Antwerp was not quite the man to solve it.  He was
stubborn, self-confident, and indifferent by turns.  He did not depend
upon his lieutenants, but jealously guarded his own opinions from the
least question or discussion, and at every step he antagonized the
easy-going people among whom he had come to work.  He had no patience
with their habits of procrastination, and he was continually offending
their lazy good-nature and their pride.  He treated the rich planters,
who owned the land between the mines and the harbor over which the
freight railroad must run, with as little consideration as he showed
the regiment of soldiers which the Government had farmed out to the
company to serve as laborers in the mines.  Six months after Van
Antwerp had taken charge at Valencia, Clay, who had finished the
railroad in Mexico, of which King had spoken, was asked by telegraph to
undertake the work of getting the ore out of the mountains he had
discovered, and shipping it North.  He accepted the offer and was given
the title of General Manager and Resident Director, and an enormous
salary, and was also given to understand that the rough work of
preparation had been accomplished, and that the more important service
of picking up the five mountains and putting them in fragments into
tramp steamers would continue under his direction.  He had a letter of
recall for Van Antwerp, and a letter of introduction to the Minister of
Mines and Agriculture.  Further than that he knew nothing of the work
before him, but he concluded, from the fact that he had been paid the
almost prohibitive sum he had asked for his services, that it must be
important, or that he had reached that place in his career when he
could stop actual work and live easily, as an expert, on the work of
others.
</p><p>Clay rolled along the coast from Valencia to the mines in a
paddle-wheeled steamer that had served its usefulness on the
Mississippi, and which had been rotting at the levees in New Orleans,
when Van Antwerp had chartered it to carry tools and machinery to the
mines and to serve as a private launch for himself.  It was a choice
either of this steamer and landing in a small boat, or riding along the
line of the unfinished railroad on horseback.  Either route consumed
six valuable hours, and Clay, who was anxious to see his new field of
action, beat impatiently upon the rail of the rolling tub as it
wallowed in the sea.
</p><p>He spent the first three days after his arrival at the mines in the
mountains, climbing them on foot and skirting their base on horseback,
and sleeping where night overtook him.  Van Antwerp did not accompany
him on his tour of inspection through the mines, but delegated that
duty to an engineer named MacWilliams, and to Weimer, the United States
Consul at Valencia, who had served the company in many ways and who was
in its closest confidence.
</p><p>For three days the men toiled heavily over fallen trunks and trees,
slippery with the moss of centuries, or slid backward on the rolling
stones in the waterways, or clung to their ponies' backs to dodge the
hanging creepers.  At times for hours together they walked in single
file, bent nearly double, and seeing nothing before them but the
shining backs and shoulders of the negroes who hacked out the way for
them to go.  And again they would come suddenly upon a precipice, and
drink in the soft cool breath of the ocean, and look down thousands of
feet upon the impenetrable green under which they had been crawling,
out to where it met the sparkling surface of the Caribbean Sea.  It was
three days of unceasing activity while the sun shone, and of anxious
questionings around the camp-fire when the darkness fell, and when
there were no sounds on the mountain-side but that of falling water in
a distant ravine or the calls of the night-birds.
</p><p>On the morning of the fourth day Clay and his attendants returned to
camp and rode to where the men had just begun to blast away the sloping
surface of the mountain.
</p><p>As Clay passed between the zinc sheds and palm huts of the
soldier-workmen, they came running out to meet him, and one, who seemed
to be a leader, touched his bridle, and with his straw sombrero in his
hand begged for a word with el Senor the Director.
</p><p>The news of Clay's return had reached the opening, and the throb of the
dummy-engines and the roar of the blasting ceased as the
assistant-engineers came down the valley to greet the new manager.
They found him seated on his horse gazing ahead of him, and listening
to the story of the soldier, whose fingers, as he spoke, trembled in
the air, with all the grace and passion of his Southern nature, while
back of him his companions stood humbly, in a silent chorus, with
eager, supplicating eyes.  Clay answered the man's speech curtly, with
a few short words, in the Spanish patois in which he had been
addressed, and then turned and smiled grimly upon the expectant group
of engineers.  He kept them waiting for some short space, while he
looked them over carefully, as though he had never seen them before.
</p><p>"Well, gentlemen," he said, "I'm glad to have you here all together.  I
am only sorry you didn't come in time to hear what this fellow has had
to say.  I don't as a rule listen that long to complaints, but he told
me what I have seen for myself and what has been told me by others.  I
have been here three days now, and I assure you, gentlemen, that my
easiest course would be to pack up my things and go home on the next
steamer.  I was sent down here to take charge of a mine in active
operation, and I find--what?  I find that in six months you have done
almost nothing, and that the little you have condescended to do has
been done so badly that it will have to be done over again; that you
have not only wasted a half year of time--and I can't tell how much
money--but that you have succeeded in antagonizing all the people on
whose good-will we are absolutely dependent; you have allowed your
machinery to rust in the rain, and your workmen to rot with sickness.
You have not only done nothing, but you haven't a blue print to show me
what you meant to do.  I have never in my life come across laziness and
mismanagement and incompetency upon such a magnificent and reckless
scale.  You have not built the pier, you have not opened the freight
road, you have not taken out an ounce of ore.  You know more of
Valencia than you know of these mines; you know it from the Alameda to
the Canal.  You can tell me what night the band plays in the Plaza, but
you can't give me the elevation of one of these hills.  You have spent
your days on the pavements in front of cafés, and your nights in
dance-halls, and you have been drawing salaries every month.  I've more
respect for these half-breeds that you've allowed to starve in this
fever-bed than I have for you.  You have treated them worse than they'd
treat a dog, and if any of them die, it's on your heads.  You have put
them in a fever-camp which you have not even taken the trouble to
drain.  Your commissariat is rotten, and you have let them drink all
the rum they wanted.  There is not one of you--"
</p><p>The group of silent men broke, and one of them stepped forward and
shook his forefinger at Clay.
</p><p>"No man can talk to me like that," he said, warningly, "and think I'll
work under him.  I resign here and now."
</p><p>"You what--" cried Clay, "you resign?"
</p><p>He whirled his horse round with a dig of his spur and faced them.
</p><p>"How dare you talk of resigning?  I'll pack the whole lot of you back
to New York on the first steamer, if I want to, and I'll give you such
characters that you'll be glad to get a job carrying a transit.  You're
in no position to talk of resigning yet--not one of you.  Yes," he
added, interrupting himself, "one of you is MacWilliams, the man who
had charge of the railroad.  It's no fault of his that the road's not
working.  I understand that he couldn't get the right of way from the
people who owned the land, but I have seen what he has done, and his
plans, and I apologize to him--to MacWilliams.  As for the rest of you,
I'll give you a month's trial.  It will be a month before the next
steamer could get here anyway, and I'll give you that long to redeem
yourselves.  At the end of that time we will have another talk, but you
are here now only on your good behavior and on my sufferance.
Good-morning."
</p><p>As Clay had boasted, he was not the man to throw up his position
because he found the part he had to play was not that of leading man,
but rather one of general utility, and although it had been several
years since it had been part of his duties to oversee the setting up of
machinery, and the policing of a mining camp, he threw himself as
earnestly into the work before him as though to show his subordinates
that it did not matter who did the work, so long as it was done.  The
men at first were sulky, resentful, and suspicious, but they could not
long resist the fact that Clay was doing the work of five men and five
different kinds of work, not only without grumbling, but apparently
with the keenest pleasure.
</p><p>He conciliated the rich coffee planters who owned the land which he
wanted for the freight road by calls of the most formal state and
dinners of much less formality, for he saw that the iron mine had its
social as well as its political side.  And with this fact in mind, he
opened the railroad with great ceremony, and much music and feasting,
and the first piece of ore taken out of the mine was presented to the
wife of the Minister of the Interior in a cluster of diamonds, which
made the wives of the other members of the Cabinet regret that their
husbands had not chosen that portfolio.  Six months followed of hard,
unremitting work, during which time the great pier grew out into the
bay from MacWilliams' railroad, and the face of the first mountain was
scarred and torn of its green, and left in mangled nakedness, while the
ringing of hammers and picks, and the racking blasts of dynamite, and
the warning whistles of the dummy-engines drove away the accumulated
silence of centuries.
</p><p>It had been a long uphill fight, and Clay had enjoyed it mightily.  Two
unexpected events had contributed to help it.  One was the arrival in
Valencia of young Teddy Langham, who came ostensibly to learn the
profession of which Clay was so conspicuous an example, and in reality
to watch over his father's interests.  He was put at Clay's elbow, and
Clay made him learn in spite of himself, for he ruled him and
MacWilliams of both of whom he was very fond, as though, so they
complained, they were the laziest and the most rebellious members of
his entire staff.  The second event of importance was the announcement
made one day by young Langham that his father's physician had ordered
rest in a mild climate, and that he and his daughters were coming in a
month to spend the winter in Valencia, and to see how the son and heir
had developed as a man of business.
</p><p>The idea of Mr. Langham's coming to visit Olancho to inspect his new
possessions was not a surprise to Clay.  It had occurred to him as
possible before, especially after the son had come to join them there.
The place was interesting and beautiful enough in itself to justify a
visit, and it was only a ten days' voyage from New York.  But he had
never considered the chance of Miss Langham's coming, and when that was
now not only possible but a certainty, he dreamed of little else.  He
lived as earnestly and toiled as indefatigably as before, but the place
was utterly transformed for him.  He saw it now as she would see it
when she came, even while at the same time his own eyes retained their
point of view.  It was as though he had lengthened the focus of a
glass, and looked beyond at what was beautiful and picturesque, instead
of what was near at hand and practicable.  He found himself smiling
with anticipation of her pleasure in the orchids hanging from the dead
trees, high above the opening of the mine, and in the parrots hurling
themselves like gayly colored missiles among the vines; and he
considered the harbor at night with its colored lamps floating on the
black water as a scene set for her eyes.  He planned the dinners that
he would give in her honor on the balcony of the great restaurant in
the Plaza on those nights when the band played, and the senoritas
circled in long lines between admiring rows of officers and caballeros.
And he imagined how, when the ore-boats had been filled and his work
had slackened, he would be free to ride with her along the rough
mountain roads, between magnificent pillars of royal palms, or to
venture forth in excursions down the bay, to explore the caves and to
lunch on board the rolling paddle-wheel steamer, which he would have re
painted and gilded for her coming.  He pictured himself acting as her
guide over the great mines, answering her simple questions about the
strange machinery, and the crew of workmen, and the local government by
which he ruled two thousand men.  It was not on account of any personal
pride in the mines that he wanted her to see them, it was not because
he had discovered and planned and opened them that he wished to show
them to her, but as a curious spectacle that he hoped would give her a
moment's interest.
</p><p>But his keenest pleasure was when young Langham suggested that they
should build a house for his people on the edge of the hill that jutted
out over the harbor and the great ore pier.  If this were done, Langham
urged, it would be possible for him to see much more of his family than
he would be able to do were they installed in the city, five miles away.
</p><p>"We can still live in the office at this end of the railroad," the boy
said, "and then we shall have them within call at night when we get
back from work; but if they are in Valencia, it will take the greater
part of the evening going there and all of the night getting back, for
I can't pass that club under three hours. It will keep us out of
temptation."
</p><p>"Yes, exactly," said Clay, with a guilty smile, "it will keep us out of
temptation."
</p><p>So they cleared away the underbrush, and put a double force of men to
work on what was to be the most beautiful and comfortable bungalow on
the edge of the harbor.  It had blue and green and white tiles on the
floors, and walls of bamboo, and a red roof of curved tiles to let in
the air, and dragons' heads for water-spouts, and verandas as broad as
the house itself.  There was an open court in the middle hung with
balconies looking down upon a splashing fountain, and to decorate this
patio, they levied upon people for miles around for tropical plants and
colored mats and awnings.  They cut down the trees that hid the view of
the long harbor leading from the sea into Valencia, and planted a
rampart of other trees to hide the iron-ore pier, and they sodded the
raw spots where the men had been building, until the place was as
completely transformed as though a fairy had waved her wand above it.
</p><p>It was to be a great surprise, and they were all--Clay, MacWilliams,
and Langham--as keenly interested in it as though each were preparing
it for his honeymoon.  They would be walking together in Valencia when
one would say, "We ought to have that for the house," and without
question they would march into the shop together and order whatever
they fancied to be sent out to the house of the president of the mines
on the hill.  They stocked it with wine and linens, and hired a volante
and six horses, and fitted out the driver with a new pair of boots that
reached above his knees, and a silver jacket and a sombrero that was so
heavy with braid that it flashed like a halo about his head in the
sunlight, and he was ordered not to wear it until the ladies came,
under penalty of arrest.  It delighted Clay to find that it was only
the beautiful things and the fine things of his daily routine that
suggested her to him, as though she could not be associated in his mind
with anything less worthy, and he kept saying to himself, "She will
like this view from the end of the terrace," and "This will be her
favorite walk," or "She will swing her hammock here," and "I know she
will not fancy the rug that Weimer chose."
</p><p>While this fairy palace was growing the three men lived as roughly as
before in the wooden hut at the terminus of the freight road, three
hundred yards below the house, and hidden from it by an impenetrable
rampart of brush and Spanish bayonet. There was a rough road leading
from it to the city, five miles away, which they had extended still
farther up the hill to the Palms, which was the name Langham had
selected for his father's house.  And when it was finally finished,
they continued to live under the corrugated zinc roof of their office
building, and locking up the Palms, left it in charge of a gardener and
a watchman until the coming of its rightful owners.
</p><p>It had been a viciously hot, close day, and even now the air came in
sickening waves, like a blast from the engine-room of a steamer, and
the heat lightning played round the mountains over the harbor and
showed the empty wharves, and the black outlines of the steamers, and
the white front of the Custom-House, and the long half-circle of
twinkling lamps along the quay. MacWilliams and Langham sat panting on
the lower steps of the office-porch considering whether they were too
lazy to clean themselves and be rowed over to the city, where, as it
was Sunday night, was promised much entertainment.  They had been for
the last hour trying to make up their minds as to this, and appealing
to Clay to stop work and decide for them.  But he sat inside at a table
figuring and writing under the green shade of a student's lamp and made
no answer.  The walls of Clay's office were of unplaned boards,
bristling with splinters, and hung with blue prints and outline maps of
the mine.  A gaudily colored portrait of Madame la Presidenta, the
noble and beautiful woman whom Alvarez, the President of Olancho, had
lately married in Spain, was pinned to the wall above the table.  This
table, with its green oil-cloth top, and the lamp, about which winged
insects beat noisily, and an earthen water-jar--from which the water
dripped as regularly as the ticking of a clock--were the only articles
of furniture in the office.  On a shelf at one side of the door lay the
men's machetes, a belt of cartridges, and a revolver in a holster.
</p><p>Clay rose from the table and stood in the light of the open door,
stretching himself gingerly, for his joints were sore and stiff with
fording streams and climbing the surfaces of rocks. The red ore and
yellow mud of the mines were plastered over his boots and
riding-breeches, where he had stood knee-deep in the water, and his
shirt stuck to him like a wet bathing-suit, showing his ribs when he
breathed and the curves of his broad chest.  A ring of burning paper
and hot ashes fell from his cigarette to his breast and burnt a hole
through the cotton shirt, and he let it lie there and watched it burn
with a grim smile.
</p><p>"I wanted to see," he explained, catching the look of listless
curiosity in MacWilliams's eye, "whether there was anything hotter than
my blood.  It's racing around like boiling water in a pot."
</p><p>"Listen," said Langham, holding up his hand.  "There goes the call for
prayers in the convent, and now it's too late to go to town.  I am
glad, rather.  I'm too tired to keep awake, and besides, they don't
know how to amuse themselves in a civilized way--at least not in my
way.  I wish I could just drop in at home about now; don't you,
MacWilliams?  Just about this time up in God's country all the people
are at the theatre, or they've just finished dinner and are sitting
around sipping cool green mint, trickling through little lumps of ice.
What I'd like--" he stopped and shut one eye and gazed, with his head
on one side, at the unimaginative MacWilliams--"what I'd like to do
now," he continued, thoughtfully, "would be to sit in the front row at
a comic opera, ON THE AISLE.  The prima donna must be very, very
beautiful, and sing most of her songs at me, and there must be three
comedians, all good, and a chorus entirely composed of girls.  I never
could see why they have men in the chorus, anyway.  No one ever looks
at them.  Now that's where I'd like to be.  What would you like,
MacWilliams?"
</p><p>MacWilliams was a type with which Clay was intimately familiar, but to
the college-bred Langham he was a revelation and a joy. He came from
some little town in the West, and had learned what he knew of
engineering at the transit's mouth, after he had first served his
apprenticeship by cutting sage-brush and driving stakes.  His life had
been spent in Mexico and Central America, and he spoke of the home he
had not seen in ten years with the aggressive loyalty of the confirmed
wanderer, and he was known to prefer and to import canned corn and
canned tomatoes in preference to eating the wonderful fruits of the
country, because the former came from the States and tasted to him of
home.  He had crowded into his young life experiences that would have
shattered the nerves of any other man with a more sensitive conscience
and a less happy sense of humor; but these same experiences had only
served to make him shrewd and self-confident and at his ease when the
occasion or difficulty came.
</p><p>He pulled meditatively on his pipe and considered Langham's question
deeply, while Clay and the younger boy sat with their arms upon their
knees and waited for his decision in thoughtful silence.
</p><p>"I'd like to go to the theatre, too," said MacWilliams, with an air as
though to show that he also was possessed of artistic tastes.  "I'd
like to see a comical chap I saw once in '80--oh, long ago--before I
joined the P. Q. &amp; M.  He WAS funny.  His name was Owens; that was his
name, John E. Owens--"
</p><p>"Oh, for heaven's sake, MacWilliams," protested Langham, in dismay;
"he's been dead for five years."
</p><p>"Has he?" said MacWilliams, thoughtfully.  "Well--" he concluded,
unabashed, "I can't help that, he's the one I'd like to see best."
</p><p>"You can have another wish, Mac, you know," urged Langham, "can't he,
Clay?"
</p><p>Clay nodded gravely, and MacWilliams frowned again in thought. "No," he
said after an effort, "Owens, John E. Owens; that's the one I want to
see."
</p><p>"Well, now I want another wish, too," said Langham.  "I move we can
each have two wishes. I wish--"
</p><p>"Wait until I've had mine," said Clay.  "You've had one turn. I want to
be in a place I know in Vienna.  It's not hot like this, but cool and
fresh.  It's an open, out-of-door concert-garden, with hundreds of
colored lights and trees, and there's always a breeze coming through.
And Eduard Strauss, the son, you know, leads the orchestra there, and
they play nothing but waltzes, and he stands in front of them, and
begins by raising himself on his toes, and then he lifts his shoulders
gently--and then sinks back again and raises his baton as though he
were drawing the music out after it, and the whole place seems to rock
and move.  It's like being picked up and carried on the deck of a yacht
over great waves; and all around you are the beautiful Viennese women
and those tall Austrian officers in their long, blue coats and flat
hats and silver swords.  And there are cool drinks--" continued Clay,
with his eyes fixed on the coming storm--"all sorts of cool drinks--in
high, thin glasses, full of ice, all the ice you want--"
</p><p>"Oh, drop it, will you?" cried Langham, with a shrug of his damp
shoulders.  "I can't stand it.  I'm parching."
</p><p>"Wait a minute," interrupted MacWilliams, leaning forward and looking
into the night.  "Some one's coming."  There was a sound down the road
of hoofs and the rattle of the land-crabs as they scrambled off into
the bushes, and two men on horseback came suddenly out of the darkness
and drew rein in the light from the open door.  The first was General
Mendoza, the leader of the Opposition in the Senate, and the other, his
orderly.  The General dropped his Panama hat to his knee and bowed in
the saddle three times.
</p><p>"Good-evening, your Excellency," said Clay, rising.  "Tell that peon to
get my coat, will you?" he added, turning to Langham.  Langham clapped
his hands, and the clanging of a guitar ceased, and their servant and
cook came out from the back of the hut and held the General's horse
while he dismounted.  "Wait until I get you a chair," said Clay.
"You'll find those steps rather bad for white duck."
</p><p>"I am fortunate in finding you at home," said the officer, smiling, and
showing his white teeth.  "The telephone is not working.  I tried at
the club, but I could not call you."
</p><p>"It's the storm, I suppose," Clay answered, as he struggled into his
jacket.  "Let me offer you something to drink."  He entered the house,
and returned with several bottles on a tray and a bundle of cigars.
The Spanish-American poured himself out a glass of water, mixing it
with Jamaica rum, and said, smiling again, "It is a saying of your
countrymen that when a man first comes to Olancho he puts a little rum
into his water, and that when he is here some time he puts a little
water in his rum."
</p><p>"Yes," laughed Clay.  "I'm afraid that's true."
</p><p>There was a pause while the men sipped at their glasses, and looked at
the horses and the orderly.  The clanging of the guitar began again
from the kitchen.  "You have a very beautiful view here of the harbor,
yes," said Mendoza.  He seemed to enjoy the pause after his ride, and
to be in no haste to begin on the object of his errand.  MacWilliams
and Langham eyed each other covertly, and Clay examined the end of his
cigar, and they all waited.
</p><p>"And how are the mines progressing, eh?" asked the officer, genially.
"You find much good iron in them, they tell me."
</p><p>"Yes, we are doing very well," Clay assented; "it was difficult at
first, but now that things are in working order, we are getting out
about ten thousand tons a month.  We hope to increase that soon to
twenty thousand when the new openings are developed and our shipping
facilities are in better shape."
</p><p>"So much!" exclaimed the General, pleasantly.
</p><p>"Of which the Government of my country is to get its share of ten per
cent--one thousand tons!  It is munificent!"  He laughed and shook his
head slyly at Clay, who smiled in dissent.
</p><p>"But you see, sir," said Clay, "you cannot blame us.  The mines have
always been there, before this Government came in, before the Spaniards
were here, before there was any Government at all, but there was not
the capital to open them up, I suppose, or--and it needed a certain
energy to begin the attack.  Your people let the chance go, and, as it
turned out, I think they were very wise in doing so.  They get ten per
cent of the output. That's ten per cent on nothing, for the mines
really didn't exist, as far as you were concerned, until we came, did
they? They were just so much waste land, and they would have remained
so.  And look at the price we paid down before we cut a tree. Three
millions of dollars; that's a good deal of money.  It will be some time
before we realize anything on that investment."
</p><p>Mendoza shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.  "I will be frank
with you," he said, with the air of one to whom dissimulation is
difficult.  "I come here to-night on an unpleasant errand, but it is
with me a matter of duty, and I am a soldier, to whom duty is the
foremost ever.  I have come to tell you, Mr. Clay, that we, the
Opposition, are not satisfied with the manner in which the Government
has disposed of these great iron deposits.  When I say not satisfied,
my dear friend, I speak most moderately.  I should say that we are
surprised and indignant, and we are determined the wrong it has done
our country shall be righted.  I have the honor to have been chosen to
speak for our party on this most important question, and on next
Tuesday, sir," the General stood up and bowed, as though he were before
a great assembly, "I will rise in the Senate and move a vote of want of
confidence in the Government for the manner in which it has given away
the richest possessions in the storehouse of my country, giving it not
only to aliens, but for a pittance, for a share which is not a share,
but a bribe, to blind the eyes of the people.  It has been a shameful
bargain, and I cannot say who is to blame; I accuse no one.  But I
suspect, and I will demand an investigation; I will demand that the
value not of one-tenth, but of one-half of all the iron that your
company takes out of Olancho shall be paid into the treasury of the
State.  And I come to you to-night, as the Resident Director, to inform
you beforehand of my intention.  I do not wish to take you unprepared.
I do not blame your people; they are business men, they know how to
make good bargains, they get what they best can.  That is the rule of
trade, but they have gone too far, and I advise you to communicate with
your people in New York and learn what they are prepared to offer
now--now that they have to deal with men who do not consider their own
interests but the interests of their country."
</p><p>Mendoza made a sweeping bow and seated himself, frowning dramatically,
with folded arms.  His voice still hung in the air, for he had spoken
as earnestly as though he imagined himself already standing in the hall
of the Senate championing the cause of the people.
</p><p>MacWilliams looked up at Clay from where he sat on the steps below him,
but Clay did not notice him, and there was no sound, except the quick
sputtering of the nicotine in Langham's pipe, at which he pulled
quickly, and which was the only outward sign the boy gave of his
interest.  Clay shifted one muddy boot over the other and leaned back
with his hands stuck in his belt.
</p><p>"Why didn't you speak of this sooner?" he asked.
</p><p>"Ah, yes, that is fair," said the General, quickly.  "I know that it is
late, and I regret it, and I see that we cause you inconvenience; but
how could I speak sooner when I was ignorant of what was going on?  I
have been away with my troops.  I am a soldier first, a politician
after.  During the last year I have been engaged in guarding the
frontier.  No news comes to a General in the field moving from camp to
camp and always in the saddle; but I may venture to hope, sir, that
news has come to you of me?"
</p><p>Clay pressed his lips together and bowed his head.
</p><p>"We have heard of your victories, General, yes," he said; "and on your
return you say you found things had not been going to your liking?"
</p><p>"That is it," assented the other, eagerly.  "I find that indignation
reigns on every side.  I find my friends complaining of the railroad
which you run across their land.  I find that fifteen hundred soldiers
are turned into laborers, with picks and spades, working by the side of
negroes and your Irish; they have not been paid their wages, and they
have been fed worse than though they were on the march; sickness and--"
</p><p>Clay moved impatiently and dropped his boot heavily on the porch.
</p><p>"That was true at first," he interrupted, "but it is not so now.  I
should be glad, General, to take you over the men's quarters at any
time.  As for their not having been paid, they were never paid by their
own Government before they came to us and for the same reason, because
the petty officers kept back the money, just as they have always done.
But the men are paid now.  However, this is not of the most importance.
Who is it that complains of the terms of our concession?"
</p><p>"Every one!" exclaimed Mendoza, throwing out his arms, "and they ask,
moreover, this: they ask why, if this mine is so rich, why was not the
stock offered here to us in this country?  Why was it not put on the
market, that any one might buy?  We have rich men in Olancho, why
should not they benefit first of all others by the wealth of their own
lands?  But no! we are not asked to buy.  All the stock is taken in New
York, no one benefits but the State, and it receives only ten per cent.
It is monstrous!"
</p><p>"I see," said Clay, gravely.  "That had not occurred to me before.
They feel they have been slighted.  I see."  He paused for a moment as
if in serious consideration.  "Well," he added, "that might be
arranged."
</p><p>He turned and jerked his head toward the open door.  "If you boys mean
to go to town to-night, you'd better be moving," he said.  The two men
rose together and bowed silently to their guest.
</p><p>"I should like if Mr. Langham would remain a moment with us," said
Mendoza, politely.  "I understand that it is his father who controls
the stock of the company.  If we discuss any arrangement it might be
well if he were here."
</p><p>Clay was sitting with his chin on his breast, and he did not look up,
nor did the young man turn to him for any prompting.  "I'm not down
here as my father's son," he said, "I am an employee of Mr. Clay's.  He
represents the company.  Good-night, sir."
</p><p>"You think, then," said Clay, "that if your friends were given an
opportunity to subscribe to the stock they would feel less resentful
toward us?  They would think it was fairer to all?"
</p><p>"I know it," said Mendoza; "why should the stock go out of the country
when those living here are able to buy it?"
</p><p>"Exactly," said Clay, "of course.  Can you tell me this, General?  Are
the gentlemen who want to buy stock in the mine the same men who are in
the Senate?  The men who are objecting to the terms of our concession?"
</p><p>"With a few exceptions they are the same men."
</p><p>Clay looked out over the harbor at the lights of the town, and the
General twirled his hat around his knee and gazed with appreciation at
the stars above him.
</p><p>"Because if they are," Clay continued, "and they succeed in getting our
share cut down from ninety per cent to fifty per cent, they must see
that the stock would be worth just forty per cent less than it is now."
</p><p>"That is true," assented the other.  "I have thought of that, and if
the Senators in Opposition were given a chance to subscribe, I am sure
they would see that it is better wisdom to drop their objections to the
concession, and as stockholders allow you to keep ninety per cent of
the output.  And, again," continued Mendoza, "it is really better for
the country that the money should go to its people than that it should
be stored up in the vaults of the treasury, when there is always the
danger that the President will seize it; or, if not this one, the next
one."
</p><p>"I should think--that is--it seems to me," said Clay with careful
consideration, "that your Excellency might be able to render us great
help in this matter yourself.  We need a friend among the Opposition.
In fact--I see where you could assist us in many ways, where your
services would be strictly in the line of your public duty and yet
benefit us very much.  Of course I cannot speak authoritatively without
first consulting Mr. Langham; but I should think he would allow you
personally to purchase as large a block of the stock as you could wish,
either to keep yourself or to resell and distribute among those of your
friends in Opposition where it would do the most good."
</p><p>Clay looked over inquiringly to where Mendoza sat in the light of the
open door, and the General smiled faintly, and emitted a pleased little
sigh of relief.  "Indeed," continued Clay, "I should think Mr. Langham
might even save you the formality of purchasing the stock outright by
sending you its money equivalent.  I beg your pardon," he asked,
interrupting himself, "does your orderly understand English?"
</p><p>"He does not," the General assured him, eagerly, dragging his chair a
little closer.
</p><p>"Suppose now that Mr. Langham were to put fifty or let us say sixty
thousand dollars to your account in the Valencia Bank, do you think
this vote of want of confidence in the Government on the question of
our concession would still be moved?"
</p><p>"I am sure it would not," exclaimed the leader of the Opposition,
nodding his head violently.
</p><p>"Sixty thousand dollars," repeated Clay, slowly, "for yourself; and do
you think, General, that were you paid that sum you would be able to
call off your friends, or would they make a demand for stock also?"
</p><p>"Have no anxiety at all, they do just what I say," returned Mendoza, in
an eager whisper.  "If I say 'It is all right, I am satisfied with what
the Government has done in my absence,' it is enough.  And I will say
it, I give you the word of a soldier, I will say it.  I will not move a
vote of want of confidence on Tuesday.  You need go no farther than
myself.  I am glad that I am powerful enough to serve you, and if you
doubt me"--he struck his heart and bowed with a deprecatory smile--"you
need not pay in the money in exchange for the stock all at the same
time.  You can pay ten thousand this year, and next year ten thousand
more and so on, and so feel confident that I shall have the interests
of the mine always in my heart.  Who knows what may not happen in a
year?  I may be able to serve you even more.  Who knows how long the
present Government will last?  But I give you my word of honor, no
matter whether I be in Opposition or at the head of the Government, if
I receive every six months the retaining fee of which you speak, I will
be your representative.  And my friends can do nothing.  I despise
them.  _I_ am the Opposition.  You have done well, my dear sir, to
consider me alone."
</p><p>Clay turned in his chair and looked back of him through the office to
the room beyond.
</p><p>"Boys," he called, "you can come out now."
</p><p>He rose and pushed his chair away and beckoned to the orderly who sat
in the saddle holding the General's horse.  Langham and MacWilliams
came out and stood in the open door, and Mendoza rose and looked at
Clay.
</p><p>"You can go now," Clay said to him, quietly.  "And you can rise in the
Senate on Tuesday and move your vote of want of confidence and object
to our concession, and when you have resumed your seat the Secretary of
Mines will rise in his turn and tell the Senate how you stole out here
in the night and tried to blackmail me, and begged me to bribe you to
be silent, and that you offered to throw over your friends and to take
all that we would give you and keep it yourself.  That will make you
popular with your friends, and will show the Government just what sort
of a leader it has working against it."
</p><p>Clay took a step forward and shook his finger in the officer's face.
"Try to break that concession; try it.  It was made by one Government
to a body of honest, decent business men, with a Government of their
own back of them, and if you interfere with our conceded rights to work
those mines, I'll have a man-of-war down here with white paint on her
hull, and she'll blow you and your little republic back up there into
the mountains.  Now you can go."
</p><p>Mendoza had straightened with surprise when Clay first began to speak,
and had then bent forward slightly as though he meant to interrupt him.
His eyebrows were lowered in a straight line, and his lips moved
quickly.
</p><p>"You poor--" he began, contemptuously.  "Bah," he exclaimed, "you're a
fool; I should have sent a servant to talk with you. You are a
child--but you are an insolent child," he cried, suddenly, his anger
breaking out, "and I shall punish you.  You dare to call me names!  You
shall fight me, you shall fight me to-morrow.  You have insulted an
officer, and you shall meet me at once, to-morrow."
</p><p>"If I meet you to-morrow," Clay replied, "I will thrash you for your
impertinence.  The only reason I don't do it now is because you are on
my doorstep.  You had better not meet me tomorrow, or at any other
time.  And I have no leisure to fight duels with anybody."
</p><p>"You are a coward," returned the other, quietly, "and I tell you so
before my servant."
</p><p>Clay gave a short laugh and turned to MacWilliams in the doorway.
</p><p>"Hand me my gun, MacWilliams," he said, "it's on the shelf to the
right."
</p><p>MacWilliams stood still and shook his head.  "Oh, let him alone," he
said.  "You've got him where you want him."
</p><p>"Give me the gun, I tell you," repeated Clay.  "I'm not going to hurt
him, I'm only going to show him how I can shoot."
</p><p>MacWilliams moved grudgingly across the porch and brought back the
revolver and handed it to Clay. "Look out now," he said, "it's loaded."
</p><p>At Clay's words the General had retreated hastily to his horse's head
and had begun unbuckling the strap of his holster, and the orderly
reached back into the boot for his carbine.  Clay told him in Spanish
to throw up his hands, and the man, with a frightened look at his
officer, did as the revolver suggested. Then Clay motioned with his
empty hand for the other to desist. "Don't do that," he said, "I'm not
going to hurt you; I'm only going to frighten you a little."
</p><p>He turned and looked at the student lamp inside, where it stood on the
table in full view.  Then he raised his revolver.  He did not
apparently hold it away from him by the butt, as other men do, but let
it lie in the palm of his hand, into which it seemed to fit like the
hand of a friend.  His first shot broke the top of the glass chimney,
the second shattered the green globe around it, the third put out the
light, and the next drove the lamp crashing to the floor.  There was a
wild yell of terror from the back of the house, and the noise of a
guitar falling down a flight of steps.  "I have probably killed a very
good cook," said Clay, "as I should as certainly kill you, if I were to
meet you.  Langham," he continued, "go tell that cook to come back."
</p><p>The General sprang into his saddle, and the altitude it gave him seemed
to bring back some of the jauntiness he had lost.
</p><p>"That was very pretty," he said; "you have been a cowboy, so they tell
me.  It is quite evident by your manners.  No matter, if we do not meet
to-morrow it will be because I have more serious work to do.  Two
months from to-day there will be a new Government in Olancho and a new
President, and the mines will have a new director.  I have tried to be
your friend, Mr. Clay. See how you like me for an enemy.  Goodnight,
gentlemen."
</p><p>"Good-night," said MacWilliams, unmoved.  "Please ask your man to close
the gate after you."
</p><p>When the sound of the hoofs had died away the men still stood in an
uncomfortable silence, with Clay twirling the revolver around his
middle finger.  "I'm sorry I had to make a gallery play of that sort,"
he said.  "But it was the only way to make that sort of man understand."
</p><p>Langham sighed and shook his head ruefully.
</p><p>"Well," he said, "I thought all the trouble was over, but it looks to
me as though it had just begun.  So far as I can see they're going to
give the governor a run for his money yet."
</p><p>Clay turned to MacWilliams.
</p><p>"How many of Mendoza's soldiers have we in the mines, Mac?" he asked.
</p><p>"About fifteen hundred," MacWilliams answered.  "But you ought to hear
the way they talk of him."
</p><p>"They do, eh?" said Clay, with a smile of satisfaction. "That's good.
'Six hundred slaves who hate their masters.' What do they say about me?"
</p><p>"Oh, they think you're all right.  They know you got them their pay and
all that.  They'd do a lot for you."
</p><p>"Would they fight for me?" asked Clay.
</p><p>MacWilliams looked up and laughed uneasily.  "I don't know," he said.
"Why, old man?  What do you mean to do?"
</p><p>"Oh, I don't know," Clay answered.  "I was just wondering whether I
should like to be President of Olancho."
