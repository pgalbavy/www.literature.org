<p>The weather cleared toward morning, and the sun rose without
a cloud obscuring its face. The halt had been made along a small
tributary of the Wichita, whose upper waters flow through the
country of the Kiowas, Comanches, and Apaches, that of the Cheyennes
and Arapahoes lying further north.</p>

<p>The scene was inspiriting. The cowboys gathered around the wagon
for breakfast, the cook having been thoughtful enough to protect
the wood against the rain. The animals were busy cropping the
grass, which was rich and succulent on all sides of the Trail,
the hands for the time being bestowing only general attention
on them, but everyone was ready to leap into the saddle and dash
off at a instant's call.</p>

<p>Captain Shirril discovered that a bunch of thirty cattle were
missing, and believed they had joined his friend's herd a mile
to the southward, from which it would be necessary to separate
or cut them out.</p>

<p>Antonio Nunez, the Mexican, and Shackaye, the Comanche (the latter
of whom showed no evidence of having been engaged in questionable
business during the preceding night), were similarly attired,
though it would be supposed that the full-blooded Indian would
have dressed in accordance with the fashion of his people. He
claimed, however, to have been engaged in the cattle business
before, and, when he first presented himself in camp on his wiry
pony, he wore the broad-brimmed sombrero, baggy leather breeches,
and red sash around his waist, which were the most noticeable
features of the Mexican's make-up.</p>

<p>The Comanche, however, used no spurs, his feet being shod with
moccasins, and, instead of the revolver worn by the Mexicans,
he carried a knife thrust in at his girdle and a breech-loading
rifle, which was not repeating.</p>

<p>The cowboys sported the same broad-brimmed hats, which in some
instances cost more than all the rest of their suits, the leggings,
flannel overshirts, and gaudy handkerchiefs tied loosely around
their necks.</p>

<p>All, as a matter of course, were expert horsemen, and were furnished
with two or three excellent animals apiece, for their business
is as trying upon them as upon the men.</p>

<p>The meal was quickly finished, and Captain Shirril, with two
of his hands, set out for the camp to the rear, where he hoped
to find the missing cattle. Since there was a possibility that
they had strayed in other directions, three more men were despatched
to make search.</p>

<p>It was rather curious that the captain selected as his assistants
his nephew Avon and the young Comanche Shackaye. When they were
riding off, Gleeson, the Texan, looked at the youth and winked,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>Half-way to the camp, the three galloped over a ridge or swell
in the prairie, when to their surprise they came upon the missing
animals browsing just beyond.</p>

<p>"That's lucky!" said the captain; "the job is going to be easier
than I supposed. Avon, you and Shackaye ride to the left, while
I will turn to the right. Look out for that ugly steer; we have
had trouble with him before, and I believe he is in a bad mood
now."</p>

<p>The Indian grinned on hearing these words and said:</p>

<p>"Me no 'fraid; me rope him if he fight."</p>

<p>And to show his contempt for the huge brute, he drove his mustang
straight for him as he was grazing on the further side of the
group. The steer raised his head, with the grass hanging from
his jaws, and looked quietly at the approaching Indian. He seemed
to be in doubt as to his purpose, until Shackaye, when almost
upon him, swung his arm above his head and uttered a tantalizing
shout, as if he wished to enrage the beast.</p>

<p>If such was his purpose he succeeded, for with a muttered bellow,
the steer dropped his head and charged fiercely at the pony, which,
to save himself, was obliged to wheel with such suddenness that
the young Comanche, despite his superb horsemanship, was thrown
violently to the ground directly in front of the animal.</p>

<p>Occasionally a cowboy is caught in the perilous situation of
the young Comanche. His horse may stumble, his lasso (always called
a "rope" except in California) become entangled, or he may be
thrown to the ground in the path of the charging steer or bull,
which is sure to be upon him before he can regain his feet and
steed.</p>

<p>In such emergencies there is but the single thing to do: that
is, to shoot the animal, and to hesitate to do so means certain
death to the endangered cattleman.</p>

<p>Two causes prevented Shackaye from appealing to this last and
only recourse. His fall was so violent that he was slightly dazed,
though he did not lose sight of his peril, but he made the mistake
of attempting to climb to his feet and darting aside, when the
time at command was insufficient to take him beyond reach of the
savage steer.</p>

<p>His rifle remained in place on the front of his saddle, so that
it was beyond his reach, while, as I have stated elsewhere, he
carried no pistol. He was, therefore, without firearms.</p>

<p>Captain Shirril was fully two hundred yards away, but he saw
the imminence of the danger, and, bringing his gun to a level,
fired at the steer, calling at the same moment to his nephew to
shoot it. The captain's bullet struck the beast, but without producing
any effect, unless to add to his rage.</p>

<p>It took Avon but a second or two to raise his Winchester to his
shoulder and aim at the animal, which was near at hand.</p>

<p>"If I was sure that was you last night," he thought, "I would
let the steer do his duty, but maybe you are innocent, so here
goes!"</p>

<p>It was no special feat of marksmanship to send a rifle-ball through
the heart of the charging brute, but he was so close to the Comanche
when he received the shot that he would have tumbled over him,
had not Shackaye managed to roll aside in time to avoid the huge
mass, which ploughed along the ground, as if fired from an enormous
gun.</p>

<p>The occurrence alarmed the other cattle, and they started off
at such a pace that the instant attention of the captain and his
nephew was required. Paying no further heed to the unhorsed Shackaye,
Avon sent his mustang after the flying animals, the captain doing
the same from his direction.</p>

<p>The hardest of riding was required to round them up and turn
their faces toward the main herd, and it was not long before Avon
found himself pitted against a steer fully as ugly as that which
he had been obliged to shoot a few minutes before. All the others
were finally forced into the right course, and this obstinate
animal was disposed to join them, but after trotting for a short
distance, he seemed to tire of being good, and, wheeling about,
charged like a runaway engine at the youthful horseman who was
harrying him so hard.</p>

<p>In such crises a great deal depends on the intelligence of the
horse. Thunderbolt sprang aside with the nimbleness of a monkey,
and Avon received just enough warning to hold his place in the
saddle. The steer attempted to keep up his pursuit, turning with
remarkable quickness for such a large animal, but the dexterity
of Thunderbolt was still greater, and he easily evaded the sharp
horns which came near him more than once. Finally, as if he saw
the uselessness of his pursuit, the steer headed in the opposite
direction from that which he ought to have taken, and sped away
with all the fleetness he possessed.</p>

<p>Avon saw his uncle galloping to his help.</p>

<p>"Leave him to me!" called the nephew; "I'll conquer him."</p>

<p>Captain Shirril drew up, and, from his perch in the saddle, watched
the result of the curious contest.</p>

<p>Avon had his rope ready to fling over the horns of the fugitive,
but before doing so, he resorted to another artifice, which few
persons of his years can carry out successfully. It is not only
difficult, but it is vastly more dangerous, in the event of the
animal showing fight, as the steer had already done.</p>

<p>It was necessary to force Thunderbolt close beside the fugitive,
and, despite the courage of the mustang, it was only natural that
he should feel some reluctance against doing this. Those horns
possessed prodigious length and sharpness, and had already been
turned upon him; but he was obedient, and urged by the pricking
of the spur and the words of his master, he edged still nearer,
though it need not be said that he kept an eye to windward. It
was well he did so.</p>

<p>Young Burnet was in the act of leaning forward to attempt the
dangerous and difficult feat, when the steer again dropped his
head, with one side lower than the other, as such animals do when
assailing a foe sideways, and charged upon the mustang.</p>

<p>Nine horses out of ten would have been fatally impaled by the
suddenness of the assault, for there was no time for him to wheel;
but with a dexterity that seemed incredible, he instantly rose
on his hind feet and bounded clean over the steer. The wonder
of the exploit was how the horse gathered himself and applied
his strength with such astonishing quickness, but he did it like
a trained gymnast, his rider maintaining his seat without difficulty
and feeling a thrill of admiration at the amazing skill of his
steed.</p>

<p>If a dumb animal can ever show surprise, the steer displayed
it at the action of the mustang. Having made his lunge with his
horns, he must have become aware that, instead of piercing flesh
and blood, they clove vacancy only. With his head aloft, and snorting
with anger, he stared where the horse and rider were a moment
before, but where now they were not.</p>

<p>He looked to the right and left, as if unable to comprehend what
had become of them. Captain Shirril was seated motionless on his
steed, several hundred yards distant, and, if the steer decided
for a moment in his own mind that he was the individual he was
looking for, he must have been puzzled to know how it was his
horse traveled so far in such an amazingly brief space of time.</p>

<p>The sound of hoofs caused the animal to look on the other side
of him, where, sure enough, only a short distance off was the
identical offender, calmly surveying him as if plotting further
mischief.</p>

<p>Instantly the head of the steer dropped again, and he was in
the act of charging with the same impetuosity as before, when
he changed his mind, and, instead of becoming a pursuer, resumed
the character of a fugitive.</p>
