<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Three more miserable lads could not be imagined than our young
friends when the train stopped at the station in New Brunswick,
and they knew that the total amount of their joint funds was less
than a dollar.</p>

<p>No one spoke, but they sat pale, woebegone and staring helplessly
at each other, undecided what to do.</p>

<p>The conductor, who was an alert official, said to Billy:</p>

<p>"This is where you get off; come, step lively."</p>

<p>The lad rose to his feet without a word, and started down the
aisle for the door. His companions glanced at him, and, feeling
that it would not do for them to separate, also rose by common
impulse and followed him out on the platform, where they stood
silent and wretched until the train left.</p>

<p>Jimmy McGovern was the first to speak, and it was with the deepest
sigh he ever drew:</p>

<p>"Well, boys, what’s to be done?"</p>

<p>"Let’s go back home," said Billy, "and get the jewelry under
the stump, sell that and start over again; I guess we’ll know
enough to take care of our money next time."</p>

<p>"But we haven’t enough to pay our fare," remarked Tommy.</p>

<p>"We can walk to Jersey City; we’ve got a little money, and we’ll
sell a revolver there: that will take one of us to Ashton, and
he can get the jewelry."</p>

<p>It was a most repellent course, and they spent a half-hour in
discussing it; but it really seemed that nothing else was possible,
and the proceeding was agreed upon.</p>

<p>Few words were spoken as they walked down the slope from the
station, made their way to the bridge a short distance below the
trestle-work, and walked across to the other side. Inquiry showed
them that they had almost thirty miles to walk to Jersey City,
and since the forenoon was well advanced, they could not expect
to reach their destination before the morrow.</p>

<p>But it was the spring of the year, the weather was mild, and
they concluded they could beg something to eat. If the farmers
refused them permission to sleep in their houses, they could take
refuge in some barn, after the manner of ordinary tramps.</p>

<p>But an unexpected series of adventures was before them.</p>

<p>After crossing the Raritan and walking a short distance, they
turned into a stretch of woods, where they sat down to discuss
further what ought to be done. With the elastic spirits of childhood,
all had rallied somewhat from the extreme depression following
the discovery of the loss of their funds. The leader was especially
hopeful.</p>

<p>"I don’t know but what it is best this happened," said he, "for
we hadn’t enough money to see us through, and one of us might
have to come back after we got to Chicago, and that would have
been bad."</p>

<p>"But we expected to get money there," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"I don’t believe it would be as easy as we thought; now I will
leave you two in New York, after we reach there, go back to Ashton,
get the jewelry and bring it with me. We can sell it for two or
three thousand dollars, and we’ll be fixed."</p>

<p>The others caught the infection of hope and rose to their feet,
eager to reach the metropolis as soon as possible.</p>

<p>They were about to resume their journey, when they heard voices
near them. Looking around, two frowzy men were observed walking
slowly toward them. One was munching a sandwich, while the other
had a short black pipe between his teeth.</p>

<p>The reader may not know that the woods, on the northern bank
of the Raritan, is the spot where the numerous tramps of New Jersey
have their general rendezvous. Several hundred of these nuisances
are sometimes gathered there, and they are held in great dread
by the neighbors, for they are lazy, thievish, and lawless, and
have perpetrated so many outrages that more than one descent has
been made upon their camp by the authorities, while the law-abiding
citizens have been on the point, at times, of taking severe measure
against them.</p>

<p>Unsuspicious of the fact, the boys had approached close to the
camp of the tramps.</p>

<p>The two tousled specimens caught sight of the boys at the same
moment that the latter discovered them. The one munching a sandwich
stopped, stared a second, and then, speaking as well as he could,
with his mouth full of food, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Well, I’ll be shot if this doesn’t beat the bugs!"</p>

<p>"Why, Snakeroot Sam!" called the delighted Tommy Wagstaff, "if
this isn’t the luckiest thing that could happen!"</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?" asked that worthy, swallowing what
was in his mouth, and indulging in a grin which disclosed a double
row of large black teeth. His companion pulled his pipe and looked
on in silence.</p>

<p>"Why, didn’t I tell you we was going to start for the West about
this time?" asked the happy leader of the little party.</p>

<p>"So you did; I jotted it down in my notebook, but seein’ as how
you didn’t give me the percise date, I couldn’t be on hand to
wish you good-bye; but what are you doin’ <em>here</em>?"</p>

<p>"We’ve had bad luck," was the disconsolate reply; "we’ve been
robbed of all our money."</p>

<p>"And are goin’ to hoof it back?"</p>

<p>"That’s what we’ll have to do, but we mean to take a new start."</p>

<p>"How did this unfortinit misfortune come to overtake ye?"</p>

<p>Tommy gave the history of their mishap, the two tramps listening
with much interest.</p>

<p>"This is my friend, Ragged Jim," said Sam, when the narrative
was finished, "and he’s true blue."</p>

<p>Ragged Jim nodded his head and grunted, without taking the black
clay pipe from between his teeth, while Snakeroot Sam munched
his sandwich at intervals.</p>

<p>"So you’ve no money with you?"</p>

<p>"Not a dollar," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>"How ’bout your shootin’ irons?"</p>

<p>"They’re all right; we’ve got a good revolver."</p>

<p>"Let me look at ’em; I’d like to be sure that they’re the right
kind to plug redskins with."</p>

<p>The boys promptly produced their weapons, and passed them over
to Sam, who examined each in turn, and then handed a couple to
his companion.</p>

<p>"I obsarve a watch-chain onto ye," continued Sam; "I hope you
aint so dishonorable es to carry a chain without a watch at t’other
end to sorter balance it."</p>

<p>"I’ve got my father’s time-piece with me," replied Tommy, producing
the fine chronometer, and passing it to the tramp, who extended
his hand for it.</p>

<p>Sam turned it over in his hand with the same attentive interest
he had shown in the case of the revolvers. The single weapon he
had shoved in his hip-pocket. He held the timepiece to his ear,
listened to its ticking, surveyed the face, and then deliberately
slipped it into his trousers pocket, catching the chain in the
hole through which he had previously run a ten-penny nail to give
his garments the right fit.</p>

<p>"How does that look on me?" he asked, with a grin, of his friend.</p>

<p>"It fits you bootiful," replied Ragged Jim, "which the same is
the case with these weapons and myself."</p>

<p>"Good-day, sonnies," said Snakeroot Sam, doffing his dilapidated
hat with mock courtesy.</p>

<p>"But," said the dismayed Tommy, "that’s my watch."</p>

<p>"Why, sonny, you shouldn’t tell a story; that’s wicked."</p>

<p>"But it <em>is</em> mine; I want it."</p>

<p>"Didn’t you just tell me it was your father’s?"</p>

<p>"Yes—but I want it."</p>

<p>"Give my lovin’ respects to your governor, and tell him when
I come his way I’ll stop and pass it over to him."</p>

<p>With tears in his eyes, Tommy rushed forward as the tramp began
moving off, and caught his arm.</p>

<p>"Sam, you must let me have that!"</p>

<p>"What! are you goin’ to commit highway robbery?" he demanded,
as if frightened: "do you want it bad?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do, and I mean to get it."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>Snakeroot Sam turned about, seized the boy by the nape of his
coat, and delivered a kick which sent sent him several paces and
caused him to fall on his face. Then he wheeled as if to serve
Jimmy and Billy in the same manner, but they eluded him by running
out of the woods to the highway. Ragged Jim stood laughing at
the scene, and Sam made again for Tommy; but he had leaped to
his feet and hurried after his companions.</p>

<p>"By-by," called Sam; "when you get that money call on me again
and I’ll take charge of it."</p>

<p>When the three came together in the road, each was crying. Tommy
suffered from the pain of his ill-usage, while all were in despair.
Neither could say a word to comfort the others, and they tramped
wearily along, beginning to feel for the first time that their
good fortune had deserted them at last.</p>

<p>Not one would confess it, but he would have given anything at
command could he have been safely at home at that moment, with
the deeds of the past few days wiped out and undone forever.</p>

<p>The sky, which had been sunshiny in the morning, was now overcast,
and they had not gone far when drops of rain began falling.</p>

<p>"We’re going to get wet," ventured Billy Waylett.</p>

<p>"I don’t care," replied Tommy, "I can’t feel any worse than I
do now."</p>

<p>A few minutes later a drizzling rain began falling, but, although
they passed a house near the road, they did not stop, and kept
on until their clothing was saturated. They were cold, chilly,
and hungry, for noon had gone and all ate lightly in the morning.</p>

<p>"I’m tired out," said Billy, at last; "let’s stop yonder and
warm ourselves; maybe the folks will give us something to eat."</p>

<p>The dwelling stood a little way from the road, with which it
communicated by means of a lane lined on both sides with tall
trees. No one was visible around it, but they turned through the
broad gate and hurried through the rain, which was still falling,
with its cold, dismal patter, every drop of which seemed to force
its way through the clothing to their bodies.</p>

<p>About half the distance was passed when Tommy, who was slightly
in advance of his companions, wheeled about and dashed for the
highway again.</p>

<p>"There’s a dog coming!" was his exclamation.</p>

<p>The others heard the threatening growl, and descried an immense
canine coming down the lane like a runaway steam engine.</p>

<p>Nothing but a hurried flight was left to them, and they ran with
the desperation of despair. Billy, being the younger and shorter,
was unable to keep up with the others. His dumpy legs worked fast,
but he fell behind, and his terrified yells a moment later announced
that the dog had overtaken him and was attending to business.</p>

<p>His horrified companions stopped to give what help they could,
but the dog, having extracted a goodly piece from Billy’s garments,
was satisfied to turn about and trot back to the house to receive
the commendation of his master, who was standing on the porch
and viewing the proceedings with much complacency.</p>

<p>An examination of Billy, who was still crying, showed that the
skin had only been scratched, though his trousers had suffered
frightfully. All had received such a scare that they determined
to apply to no more houses for relief, even if the rain descended
in torrents and they were starving.</p>

<p>And so they tramped wearily onward through the mud and wet, hungry
and utterly miserable. It seemed to them that their homes were
a thousand miles distant and they would never see them again.</p>

<p>They could not help picturing their warm, comfortable firesides,
where their kind parents denied them nothing, and where they had
spent so many happy days, with no thought of what they owed those
loving ones whom they were treating with such ingratitude.</p>

<p>Tears were in the eyes of all three, and, though they grew so
weary that they could hardly drag one foot after the other, they
plodded along until the gathering darkness told them night was
closing in.</p>

<p>They had met wagons, horsemen, and several persons on foot. From
some of the last they made inquiries and learned that, although
they had passed through several towns, they were yet south of
Rahway. Their hunger became so gnawing that Tommy spent all their
money in buying a lot of cakes, which they devoured with the avidity
of savages, and felt hungry when none was left to eat.</p>

<p>To the inquiries made of them they returned evasive answers,
and when they reached any one of the numerous towns and villages
between New Brunswick and the Hudson, they hurried through them
and into the open country, where the people viewed them with less
curiosity.</p>

<p>When the darkness became so deep that they could not very well
see their way, it was necessary to decide where and how they were
to spend the night. The drizzling rain was still falling; they
were chilled to the bone, and so tired that they could hardly
walk.</p>

<p>In the gathering gloom, they observed a barn near the highway,
in which they concluded to take refuge, for it was impossible
to walk farther, and no better shelter was likely to present itself.</p>

<p>But for the cruel reception received at the first house earlier
in the afternoon, they would have asked for charity of some of
the neighbors, and doubtless would have received kind treatment,
for it would be unjust to describe all the people of that section
as unfeeling and heartless.</p>

<p>Had they made their predicament known in any one of the towns,
they would have been taken care of until their families could
be communicated with; but they were too frightened to think of
anything of that nature.</p>

<p>Halting a short way from the barn, Tommy cautiously advanced
to make a reconnoissance. He walked timidly around it, but discovered
nothing of any person, nor did he hear the growl of a watch-dog.
The dwelling-house stood so far off that it was distinguished
only by the lights twinkling from within.</p>

<p>When Tommy came to try the main door, however, it was locked,
and he feared they were barred out. He persevered, and with a
thrill of hope found the stable-door unfastened—a piece of carelessness
on the part of the owner, unless he meant to return shortly.</p>

<p>The lad whistled to his companions waiting in the road, and they
hurried to his side. Telling them the cheering news, he let them
pass in ahead of him, after which he carefully closed the door
as it was before.</p>

<p>Then followed several minutes of groping in the dark, during
which Jimmy narrowly missed receiving a dangerous kick from one
of the horses, and at last the hay-mow was located. With considerable
labor they crawled to the top, covered their shivering bodies
as best they could, and, nestling close together, to secure what
warmth they could, sank almost immediately into deep slumber.</p>

<p>They were so utterly worn out that neither opened his eyes until
the sun was above the horizon. The storm had cleared away, the
air was cool, and though their bodies were stiffened and half-famished,
they were in better spirits than when they clambered into the
refuge.</p>

<p>When all had fully awakened and rubbed their eyes, they sat for
a moment or two on the hay, considering what could be done.</p>

<p>"I’m so hungry," said Billy Waylett, "that I feel as though I
could eat this hay."</p>

<p>"And I’ll chew some of the meal if we can’t do any better," added
Jim.</p>

<p>"Both of you together aint half as hungry as <em>I</em> am,"
said Tommy, "and I’m going to the house to ask for something to
eat."</p>

<p>"Maybe they’ve got a dog," suggested Billy, with a shudder.</p>

<p>"I don’t care if they have; I’ll kill and eat <em>him</em>."</p>

<p>From this it will be seen that the young Indian slayers were
in a sorry plight indeed.</p>

<p>"You fellers stay here," said Tommy, "while I fix things, and
then I’ll send for you; I’m bound to do something or die, for
I can’t stand this any longer—"</p>

<p>Just then the barn door opened, and several persons entered.</p>

<p>"I think we’ll find them in here," remarked one; "they couldn’t
have traveled much farther."</p>

<p>"But I don’t see how the young rascals could get in my barn."</p>

<p>"We’ll take a look through that haymow."</p>

<p>And the next minute the head and shoulders of a burly man rose
to view, and the runaways were discovered.</p>
