<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Silver Heels stood in the tap-room of "Buckman's Tavern" casting
bullets; the barefoot drummer watched the white-hot crucible and
baled out the glittering molten metal or fed it with lumps of
lead stripped from the gate-post of Hooper's house in Danvers.</p>

<p>Near the window sat some Woburn Minute Men, cross-legged on the
worn floor, rolling cartridges. From time to time the parson of
Woburn, who had come to pray and shoot, took away the pile of
empty powder-horns and brought back others to be emptied.</p>

<p>The tavern was dim and damp; through freshly bored loopholes
in the shutters sunlight fell, illuminating the dark interior.</p>

<p>In their shirts, barearmed and bare of throat to the breast-bone,
a score of Lexington Minute Men stood along the line of loopholes,
their long rifles thrust out. They had no bayonets, but each man
had driven his hunting-knife into the wall beside him.</p>

<p>Jack Mount and the Weasel lay, curled up like giant cats, at
the door, blinking peacefully out through the cracks into the
early sunshine. I could hear their low-voiced conversation from
where I stood at my post, close to Silver Heels:</p>

<p>"Redcoats, Cade, not redskins," corrected Mount. "British lobster-backs&mdash;eh,
Cade? You remember how we drubbed them there in Pittsburg, belt
and buckle and ramrod&mdash;eh, Cade?"</p>

<p>"That was long ago, friend."</p>

<p>"Call me Jack! Why don't you call me Jack any more?" urged Mount.
"You know me now, don't you, Cade?"</p>

<p>"Ay, but I forget much. Do you know how I came here?"</p>

<p>"From Johnstown, Cade&mdash;from Johnstown, lad!"</p>

<p>"I cannot remember Johnstown."</p>

<p>Presently the Weasel peered around at Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"Who is that young lady?" he asked, mildly.</p>

<p>Silver Heels heard and smiled at the old man. The faintest quiver
curved her mouth; there was a shadow of pain in her eyes.</p>

<p>The fire from the crucible tinted her cheeks; she raised both
bared arms to push back her clustering hair. Hazel gray, her brave
eyes met mine across the witch-vapour curling from the melting-pot.</p>

<p>"Do you recall how the ferret, Vix, did bite Peter's tight breeches,
Michael?"</p>

<p>"Ay," said I, striving to smile.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and the jack-knife made by Barlow?"</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>She flushed to the temples and looked at my left hand. The scar
was there. I raised my hand and kissed the blessed mark.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear Michael," she whispered, "truly you were ever the
dearest and noblest and best of all!"</p>

<p>"Unfit to kiss thy shoon's latchet, sweet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yet hast untied the latchets of my heart."</p>

<p>A stillness fell on the old tavern; the Minute Men stood silently
at the loopholes, the barefoot drummer sat on his drum, hands
folded, watching with solemn, childish eyes the nuggets of lead
sink, bubble, and melt.</p>

<p>A militiaman came down-stairs for a bag of bullets.</p>

<p>"They be piping hot yet," said the drummer-boy, "and not close
pared."</p>

<p>But the soldier carelessly gathered heaping handfuls in his calloused
palms, and went up the bare, creaking stairs again to his post
among the pigeons.</p>

<p>The heat of the brazier had started the perspiration on Silver
Heels's face and neck; tiny drops glistened like fresh dew on
a blossom. She stood, dreamily brushing with the back of her hand
the soft hair from her brow. Her dark-fringed eyes on me; under
her loosened kerchief I saw the calm breathing stir her neck and
bosom gently as a white flower stirs at a breath of June.</p>

<p>"The scent of the sweet-fern," she murmured; "do you savour it
from the pastures?"</p>

<p>I looked at her in pity.</p>

<p>"Ay, dear heart," she whispered, with a sad little smile, "I
am homesick to the bones of me, sick for the blue hills o' Tryon
and the whistling martin-birds, sick for the scented brake and
the smell of sweet water babbling, sick for your arm around me,
and your man's strength to crush me to you and take the kiss my
very soul does ache to give."</p>

<p>A voice broke in from the pigeon-loft above, "Is there a woman
below to sew bandages?"</p>

<p>"Truly there is, sir," called back Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"I'll take the mould," said the small drummer, "but you are to
come when the fight begins, for I mean to do a deal o' drumming!"</p>

<p>She started towards the stairway, then turned to look at me.</p>

<p>"My post is wherever you are," I said, stepping to her side.</p>

<p>I took her little hand, all warm and moist from the bullet-moulding,
and I kissed the palm and the delicate, rounded wrist.</p>

<p>"There is a long war before us ere we find a home," I said.</p>

<p>"I know," she said, faintly.</p>

<p>"A long, long war; separation, sadness. Will you wed me before
I go to join with Cresap's men?"</p>

<p>"Ay," she said.</p>

<p>"There is a parson below, Silver Heels."</p>

<p>Her face went scarlet.</p>

<p>"Let it be now," I whispered, with my arm around her.</p>

<p>She looked up into my eyes. I leaned over the landing-rail and
called out, "Send a man for the parson of Woburn!"</p>

<p>An Acton man stepped out on the tavern porch and shouted for
the parson. Presently the good man came, in rusty black, shouldering
a fowling-piece, his pockets bulging with a Bible and Book of
Common Prayer, his wig all caked and wet from a tour through the
dewy willows behind the inn.</p>

<p>"Is there sickness here&mdash;or wounds?" he asked, anxiously. Then
he saw me above and came wheezing up the stairs.</p>

<p>"Heart-sickness, sir," I said; "we be dying, both of us, for
the heart's ease you may bring us through your holy office."</p>

<p>At length he understood &mdash;Silver Heels striving to keep
her sweet eyes lifted when he spoke to her, and I quiet and determined,
asking that he lose no time, for no man knew how long we few here
in the tavern had to live. In the same breath I summoned a soldier
from the south loophole in the garret, and asked him to witness
for me; and he took off his hat and stood sheepishly twirling
it, rifle in hand.</p>

<p>And so we were wedded, there in the ancient garret, the pigeons
coo-cooing overhead, the blue wasps buzzing up and down the window-glass,
and our hands joined before the aged parson of Woburn town. I
had the plain gold ring which I had bought in Albany for this
purpose, nor dreamed to wed my sweetheart with it thus!&mdash;and O
the sweetness in her lips and eyes when I drew it from the cord
around my neck and placed it on her smooth finger at the word!</p>

<p>Little else I remember, save that the old parson kissed her,
and the soldier kissed her outstretched hand, and let his gun
fall for bashful fright. Nor that we were truly wedded did I understand,
even when the parson of Woburn went away down the creaking stairs
with his fowling-piece over his shoulder, leaving us standing
mute together under the canopy of swinging herbs. We still held
hands, standing quiet, in a vague expectation of some mystery
yet to come. Children that we were!&mdash;the mystery of mysteries
had been wrought, never to be undone till time should end.</p>

<p>A pigeon flew, whimpering, to the beam above us, then strutted
and bowed and coo-cooed to its startled, sleek, white sweetheart;
a wind blew through the rafters, stirring the dry bunches of catnip,
mint, and thyme, till they swung above, scented censers all, exhaling
incense.</p>

<p>There was a pile of cotton cloth on the floor; Silver Heels sank
down beside it and began to tear it into strips for sewing bandages.</p>

<p>I looked from the window, seeing nothing.</p>

<p>Presently the Minute Man at the south loop spoke:</p>

<p>"A man riding this way&mdash;there!&mdash;on the Concord Road!"</p>

<p>Silver Heels on the floor worked steadily, ripping the snowy
cotton.</p>

<p>"There is smoke yonder on the Concord Road," said the Minute
Man.</p>

<p>  [Illustration: "<em>AND SO WE WERE WEDDED</em>"]</p>

<p>I roused and rubbed my eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you hear firing," he asked, "far away in the west?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Concord lies northwest."</p>

<p>Silver Heels, absorbed in her task, hummed a little tune under
her breath.</p>

<p>"The smoke follows the road," said the Minute Man.</p>

<p>The firing became audible in the room. Silver Heels raised her
head with a grave glance at me. I went and knelt beside her.</p>

<p>"It is coming at last, little sweetheart," I said. "Will you
go, now? Foxcroft will take you across the fields to some safe
farm."</p>

<p>"You know Sir William would not have endured to see me leave
at such a time," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear heart, but you cannot carry a rifle."</p>

<p>"But I can make bullets and bandages."</p>

<p>"The British fire at women; you must go!" I said, aloud.</p>

<p>"I will not go."</p>

<p>"I command."</p>

<p>"No." She bent her fair, childish head and the tears fell on
the cloth in her lap.</p>

<p>"Look! Look at the redcoats!" called out the Minute Man at the
attic window.</p>

<p>As I rose I heard plainly the long, resounding crash of musket
firing, and the rattle of rifles followed like a hundred echoes.</p>

<p>"Look yonder!" he cried.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Concord Road was choked with scarlet-clad soldiers.
Mapped out below us the country stretched, and over it, like a
blood-red monster worm, wound the British column&mdash;nay, like to
a dragon it came on, with flanking lines thrust out east and west
for its thin red wings, and head and tail wreathed with smoke.</p>

<p>And now we could see feathery puffs of smoke from the road-side
bushes, from distant hills, from thickets, from ploughed fields,
from the long, undulating stone walls which crossed the plain.
Faster and faster came the musket volleys, but faster yet rang
out the shots from our yeomanry, gathering thicker and thicker
along the British route, swarming in from distant towns and hamlets
and lonely farms.</p>

<p>The old tavern was ringing with voices now&mdash;commands of officers,
calls from those who were posted above, clattering steps on the
porch as the Acton men ran out to their posts behind the tufted
willows in the swamp.</p>

<p>He who had been placed in charge at the tavern, a young officer
of the Woburn Alarm Men, shouted for silence and attention, and
ordered us not to fire unless fired upon, as our position would
be hopeless if cannon were brought against us. Then he commanded
all women to leave the tavern and seek shelter at Slocum's farm
across the meadows.</p>

<p>"No, no!" murmured Silver Heels, obstinately, as I took her hand
and started for the stairs, "I will not go,&mdash;I cannot &mdash;I
cannot! Let me stay, Michael; for God's sake, let me stay!" And
she fell on her knees and caught at my hands.</p>

<p>"To your posts!" roared the Woburn officer, drawing his sword
and coming up the stairs two at a jump. He stopped short when
he saw Silver Heels, and glanced blankly at me; but there was
no time now for flight, for, as he stepped to the window beside
me, pell-mell into the village green rushed the British light
infantry, dusty, exhausted, enraged. In brutal disorder they surged
on, here a squad huddled together, there a company, bullied, threatened,
and harangued by its officers with pistols and drawn swords; now
a group staggering past, bearing dead or wounded comrades, now
a heavy cart loaded with knapsacks and muskets, driven by hatless
soldiers.</p>

<p>Close on their heels tramped the grenadiers. Soldier after soldier
staggered and fell from the ranks, utterly exhausted, unable to
rise from the grass.</p>

<p>The lull in the firing was broken by a loud discharge of musketry
from Fiske's Hill, and presently more redcoats came rushing into
the village, while at their very heels the Bedford Alarm Men shot
at them, and chased them. Everywhere our militia came swarming&mdash;from
Sudbury, Westford, Lincoln, Acton; Minute Men from Medford, from
Stowe, from Beverly, and from Lynn&mdash;and their ancient firelocks
blazed from every stone wall, and their long rifles banged from
the distant ridges.</p>

<p>Below me in the street I saw the British officers striving desperately
to reform their men, kicking the exhausted creatures to their
feet again, striking laggards, shoving the bewildered and tired
grenadiers into line, while thicker and thicker pelted the bullets
from the Minute Men and militia.</p>

<p>They were brave men, these British officers; I saw a young ensign
of the Tenth Foot fall with a ball through his stomach, yet rise
and face the storm until shot to death by a dozen Alarm Men on
the Bedford Road.</p>

<p>It was dreadful; it was doubly dreadful when a company of grenadiers
suddenly faced about and poured a volley into our tavern, for,
ere the crashing and splintered wood had ceased, the tavern fairly
vomited flame into the square, and the British went down in heaps.
Through the smoke I saw an officer struggling to disengage himself
from his fallen and dying horse; I saw the massed infantry reel
off through the village, firing frenziedly right and left, pouring
volleys into farm-houses, where women ran screaming out into the
barns, and frantic watch-dogs barked, tugging at their chains.</p>

<p>It was not a retreat, not a flight; it was a riot, a horrible
saturnalia of smoke and fire and awful sound. As a maddened panther,
wounded, rushes forth to deal death right and left, even tearing
its own flesh with tooth and claw, the British column burst south
across the land, crazed with wounds, famished, athirst, blood-mad,
dealing death and ruin to all that lay before it.</p>

<p>Terrible was the vengeance that followed it, hovered on its gasping
flanks, scourged its dwindling ranks, which withered under the
searching fire from every tuft of bushes, every rock, every tree-trunk.</p>

<p>Already the ghastly pageant had rushed past us, leaving a crimson
trail in its wake; already the old tavern door was flung wide,
and our Minute Men were running down the Boston Road and along
the ridges on either side, firing as they came on.</p>

<p>I, with Mount and the Weasel, hung to their left flank till two
o'clock, when, about half a mile from Lexington Meeting-house,
we heard cannon, and understood that the relief troops from Boston
had come up.</p>

<p>Then, knowing that there were guns enough and to spare without
ours, we shouldered our hot rifles and trudged back to "Buckman's
Tavern," through the dust, behind a straw-covered wain which was
driving slowly under the heat of an almost vertical sun.</p>

<p>Mount, parched with thirst, hailed the driver of the wain, asking
him if he carried cider.</p>

<p>"Only a wounded man," he said, "most dead o' the red dragoons."</p>

<p>I stepped to the slowly moving wagon and looked over the tail-board
down into the straw.</p>

<p>"Shemuel!" I cried.</p>

<p>"Shemuel!" roared Mount.</p>

<p>The little Jew opened his sick eyes under his bandage. The Weasel
climbed nimbly over the tail-board and settled down beside the
wounded man, taking his blood-smeared hand.</p>

<p>"Shemuel! Shemuel! We saw them split your head!" stammered Mount,
in his astonishment and joy.</p>

<p>"Under my hat I did haff a capful of shillings," replied Shemuel,
weakly; "I &mdash;I go back&mdash;two days' time to find me my money
by dot Lechemere swamp&mdash;eh, Jack?"</p>

<p>"God bless you, old nosey!" cried Mount; "we'll get your money,
lad! Won't we, Cardigan?"</p>

<p>The little Jew turned his heavy eyes on me.</p>

<p>"You haff found Miss Warren?" he gasped. "Ach, so iss all well.
I go back&mdash;two days' time&mdash;find me my money." He smiled and closed
his eyes.</p>

<p>So we re-entered Lexington, Jack Mount, the Weasel, Saul Shemuel,
and I; and on the tavern steps Silver Heels stood, her tired,
colourless face lighted up, her outstretched hands falling on
my shoulders; and I to take her in my arms, for she had fallen
a-weeping. Above us the splendid blue of the sky spread its eternal
tent, our only shelter, our only home on the long trail through
the world; our lamp was the sun, our fireplace a continent, and
the four winds our walls, and our estates were bounded by two
oceans, washing the shores of a land where the free, at last,
might dwell.</p>

<p>In the south the thunder of the British cannon muttered, distant
and more distant; the storm had passed.</p>

<p>Had the storm passed? The smoke hung in the north where Concord
town was burning, yet around us birds sang.</p>

<p>And now came Jack Mount, riding postilion on the horses which
drew the post-chaise; behind him trotted the Weasel, leading out
Warlock. Silver Heels saw them and stood up, smiling through her
tears.</p>

<p>"Truly, we stayed and did our duty, did we not, dear heart?"</p>

<p>"With your help, sweet."</p>

<p>"And deserted not our own!"</p>

<p>"Yours the praise, dear soul."</p>

<p>"And did face our enemies like true people all; is it not so,
Michael?"</p>

<p>"It is so."</p>

<p>"Then let us go, my husband. I am sick for my own land, and for
the happiness to come."</p>

<p>"Northward we journey, little sweetheart."</p>

<p>"To the blue hills and the sweet-fern?"</p>

<p>"Ay, home."</p>

<p>And so we started for the north, out of the bloody village where
our liberty was born at the first rifle-shot, out of the sound
of the British cannon, out of the land of the salt sea, back to
the inland winds and the incense of our own dear forests, and
the music of sweet waters tumbling where the white pines sing
eternally.</p>

<p>I rode Warlock beside the chaise; Shemuel lay within; Silver
Heels sat beside the poor, hurt creature, easing his fevered head;
but her eyes ever returned to me, and the colour came and went
in her face as our eyes spoke in silence.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said Foxcroft, huskily.</p>

<p>Mount squared himself in his saddle; the Weasel, rifle on thigh,
set his horse's head north.</p>

<p>Slowly the cavalcade moved on; the robins sang on every tree;
far to the southward the thunder of the British cannon rolled
and re-echoed along the purple hills; and over all God's golden
light was falling on life, and love, and death.</p>
