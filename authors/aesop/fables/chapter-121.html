A HOUND, who in the days of his youth and strength had never
yielded to any beast of the forest, encountered in his old age a
boar in the chase.  He seized him boldly by the ear, but could
not retain his hold because of the decay of his teeth, so that
the boar escaped.  His master, quickly coming up, was very much
disappointed, and fiercely abused the dog.  The Hound looked up
and said, "It was not my fault.  master:  my spirit was as good as
ever, but I could not help my infirmities.  I rather deserve to
be praised for what I have been, than to be blamed for what I
am."
