<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Deerfoot the Shawanoe had drawn his arrow to the head and was
in the very act of launching it at the Wyandot who was advancing
on Ned Preston, when he saw that it was unnecessary.</p>

<p>The puff of blue smoke from one of the portholes, the whiplike
crack of the Kentuckian's rifle, the death-shriek of the warrior,
as he staggered back and dropped to the earth, told the startling
story too plainly to be mistaken.</p>

<p>With the faintest possible sigh, the dusky youth relaxed the
tension on the string, but he still leaned forward and peered
through the bushes, for the danger was not yet past. He more than
suspected the needle-pointed shaft would have to be sent after
the second Indian who pressed the lad so close; but, as the reader
knows, Ned Preston darted through the entrance in the very nick
of time, just escaping the tomahawk which whizzed over his head
and buried itself half way to the head in the solid puncheon slabs
of the door.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot thanks the Great Spirit of the white men," the Indian
youth muttered, looking reverently upward, "that his brother,
whom he loves more than his own life, is unharmed."</p>

<p>The young Shawanoe felt that no time was to be lost in attending
to his own safety. More than likely some one of the Wyandots had
caught sight of the arrow, as it sailed through the air, with
its important message, and the meeting of the previous day told
him he was regarded with suspicion already.</p>

<p>He saw no Indians near him and he cautiously retreated in the
direction of the river, which flowed only a short distance from
him. The bushes and undergrowth, although they had lost most of
their leaves, served him well as a screen, and, when he had advanced
three or four rods to the northward, he began to feel more hopeful,
though, it need scarcely be said, he did not relax his extraordinary
caution in the least.</p>

<p>His purpose was to follow the river bank, until he had passed
beyond the surrounding Wyandots, after which it would be an easy
matter to make his way to Wild Oaks, with the news of the sore
extremity of the block-house. It was reasonable to believe that
Waughtauk and his warriors would guard every point much more closely
than the Licking directly in front of the station, for the one
hundred yards of open clearing made it impossible for any person
to approach or leave the building in the daytime, without exposing
himself to a raking fire, before reaching a point as close as
that attained by Ned Preston and Blossom Brown, when they were
checked by the two warriors.</p>

<p>Deerfoot, therefore, was warranted in thinking he had selected
the least guarded point, though he could not be sure of success,
after the discharge of the arrow through the narrow window.</p>

<p>The few rods were passed as noiselessly as the hand of the clock
creeps over its face, when the Shawanoe became aware that he was
close to several Wyandots. He had not seen them, but that strange
subtlety, or intuition, which in some human beings seems like
a sixth sense, told him of the fact.</p>

<p>He immediately sank flat on his face, and, by an imperceptible
effort, continued to advance toward the warriors, at a much slower
rate than before. Ten feet were passed in this guarded fashion,
when he stopped: he had learned enough.</p>

<p>Between himself and the top of the bank, where it was level with
the clearing, was less than twelve feet. This space sloped irregularly
downward to the edge of the stream, and it was covered in many
places by a rank undergrowth, which, when bearing leaves, would
have been an effectual screen for an Indian or wild animal.</p>

<p>Besides this scraggly vegetation, there were logs, limbs and
debris of freshets that had been brought down the river and had
collected along the shores. This will explain why it was that
such extreme caution was required on the part of any one who sought
to avoid detection.</p>

<p>When Deerfoot stopped, he was at a point from which he saw three
Wyandots, each with a gun in his hand, gazing over the clearing
in the direction of the block-house. They seemed to be intently
occupied, but no living person could pass between them and the
river, which almost touched the feet of one, without discovery.</p>

<p>It was utterly useless to look for escape in that direction,
and without a minute's pause, the young Shawanoe worked his way
back to where he was standing when he used his bow, wondering
as he did so, why the twang of the string had not caught the ears
of the Wyandots so near him.</p>

<p>He now turned about, so as to face up stream, and tried what
might be called the only recourse left. If he was shut off in
that direction, he was in the worst dilemma of his life.</p>

<p>An almost incredible experience awaited him, for at about the
same distance as before, he discovered he was near others of his
enemies, as he was compelled to regard the Wyandots. Rather curiously,
when he advanced far enough to look through the bushes, he once
more discerned three of them.</p>

<p>They were bestowing most of their attention on the block-house,
and one of them discharged his gun toward it, their friends further
down the river doing the same.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was somewhat closer to them than to the others, for
fortunately he found a partly decayed log, lying directly across
his path, and he used this as a partial screen, though by doing
so, he increased the difficulty of his withdrawal, should it suddenly
become necessary.</p>

<p>The young Shawanoe had scarcely secured the position, when the
warriors began talking in their own tongue, which was as familiar
to Deerfoot as his own.</p>

<p>He was so close that he did not lose a single word of the conversation,
which, as may be suspected, was of no little interest to himself.</p>

<p>"The pale-face is a brave youth, and he runs like Deerfoot, the
son of the Shawanoe chieftain Allomaug."</p>

<p>"The Long Knives flee, when the Wyandots leave their villages
and hunt for them."</p>

<p>"The Yenghese are not brave," said the third warrior, who had
just fired his gun, and who used another term by which the Caucasian
was distinguished from his copper-hued brother; "they run like
the rabbits, when the hunter drives them from cover; they fled
into the strong lodge, when they saw the shadow of Waughtauk coming
from the north."</p>

<p>"They will hide behind the logs till their brothers along the
Ohio can haste to help them," observed the first speaker, who
seemed to be the pessimist of the party; "their lodge is strong,
and the Wyandot braves cannot break it down."</p>

<p>Deerfoot, from his concealment, saw the painted face of the other
warrior, as it was turned indignantly on the croaker.</p>

<p>"My brother talks like the squaw who thinks the voice of the
wind, when it blows among the trees at night, is that of the panther
and bear that are pushing their noses under her lodge to turn
it over; has Arawa no heart, that he speaks so like a squaw that
is ill?"</p>

<p>Arawa seemed to feel somewhat ashamed of himself and made no
reply: he would doubtless have been glad if the drift of the conversation
should change, but as his companions showed no eagerness to change
it, he launched out boldly himself:</p>

<p>"Why did we not shoot the pale-face youth and him with the color
of the night, when they hastened across the open ground? It was
ours to do so."</p>

<p>"We thought there was no escape for them, and there would not
be in many moons should they run again."</p>

<p>"But they cannot save the Yenghese dogs, for the strong lodge
shall be burned down before the sun shows itself again in the
east," observed the optimist.</p>

<p>"Many moons ago, when the face of the sun was all fire, we tried
to burn the strong lodge, but the flame ran away from us and it
will do so many times more."</p>

<p>This was Arawa the pessimist, croaking once more, and the others
scowled so fiercely upon him, that they seemed on the point of
offering violence with a view of modifying his views; but, if
so, they changed their minds, and one of them tendered some information:</p>

<p>"The sun and the winds and the moon have made the roof of the
strong lodge like the wood with which Arawa makes the fire in
his wigwam; it is not as it was many moons ago."</p>

<p>Arawa seemed on the point of opening his mouth to say that, while
the moon and the winds and the sun had been engaged in the drying
out process, the snows and storms and tempests had been taking
part; but if such was his intention, he changed his mind and made
a remark of still more vital interest to the cowen near the log.</p>

<p>"The pale-face dogs, and he with the countenance of the night,
must have had the serpent-tongued Deerfoot to help them."</p>

<p>This startling statement seemed to be endorsed by the other two,
one of whom said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arawa speaks the truth."</p>

<p>"Arawa reads what he sees aright," added the other, while Deerfoot
himself felt that all three had hit the nail on the head with
astonishing accuracy.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot of the Shawanoes is a dog," observed one of the warriors,
"and he shall die the death of a dog."</p>

<p>The individual referred to was rather relieved to hear this declaration,
because in order to inflict the death of a dog on him, it would
be necessary first to catch him&mdash;a condition which implied that
the Wyandots would make every effort to take him prisoner, instead
of shooting him on sight, as they often did with others.</p>

<p>Where such a strong attempt should be made, it gave the young
friend of the white men a much greater chance of eluding his foes.</p>

<p>The Wyandots, while grouped together and occasionally firing
a gun at the block-house, continued their derogatory remarks about
the young Shawanoe, who did not lose a word. He could see them
distinctly: one had his back toward him most of the time, but
he turned now and then so that his profile was visible. The lynx
eyes of the youth noticed the flaming red, which was daubed over
his face, crossed with zebra-like streaks of black, with circles
on the forehead and promiscuous dots here and there; the irregular
nose, the bridge of which had been broken, and the retreating
chin,&mdash;all of which rendered this particular Wyandot as ugly of
countenance as the imagination can picture.</p>

<p>The others, however, were not much improvement as respects looks:
one had a projecting underchin, the other a very broad face, and
the three were anything but pleasing in appearance.</p>

<p>Stealthily studying them, Deerfoot knew that, like all the other
warriors surrounding the block-house, they were his deadly enemies,
and would leave no effort untried to capture him the moment they
became aware of his presence.</p>

<p>But to escape, it was necessary to pass beyond them, and desperate
as was the chance, Deerfoot saw a faint hope of success, enough
to lead him to make the attempt.</p>

<p>The Wyandots were further up the bank than were the others, and
there was more vegetation and shrubbery there than lower down
stream; but, for all that, the chance was a forlorn one indeed.</p>

<p>Deerfoot relied mainly on the fact that the interest of the warriors
was absorbed in the block-house itself: if they should continue
to give it their whole attention, he might be able to move by
them undiscovered.</p>

<p>More than once, he had scrutinized the Licking, but with no encouraging
result. Had it been very deep close to the bank, he would have
wished no more favorable conditions. He could swim a long distance
under water and dive so far as to elude almost any kind of pursuit.</p>

<p>But the stream was too shallow to be of any use in that respect,
and he would have been forced to wade a long way before finding
a sufficient depth to benefit him.</p>

<p>Whether he would have succeeded in flanking the Wyandots, had
everything remained as it was, is an open question, for the conditions
were overwhelmingly against him. But an obstacle appeared of which
not even the acute-minded Shawanoe dreamed.</p>

<p>At the very moment he began moving from behind the rotten log,
with a view of pushing beyond, his trained ear caught a faint
rattling noise, like the whirr of a locust. He knew that it was
the warning of a rattlesnake which he had disturbed by his slight
change of position.</p>

<p>Singularly enough it was below the log and close to the water:
it must have been moving toward the side where the Shawanoe was
hiding, when it discovered him. It instantly began drawing itself
rapidly in coil and prepared to strike its enemy.</p>

<p>Deerfoot saw that it was at just the right distance to bury its
fangs in his face. He made the quickest retreat of his life. He
did not become panic-stricken, but slid back several feet, so
silently that he made less noise than did the <em>crotalus</em>
itself, which was not heard by the Wyandots, who were so much
interested in the block-house and its immediate surroundings.</p>

<p>The action of the young Indian seemed to surprise the serpent,
which found its prey beyond reach at the moment it was ready to
launch its needle-pointed fangs into his body. With the tail slightly
elevated, the snake continued vibrating it slowly and giving forth
a sound like the faint chirping of crickets.</p>

<p>Deerfoot extracted a single arrow from his quiver, and, while
lying on his face, supported on his right elbow, drew back the
missile as though it was a javelin which he was about to cast
at an enemy.</p>

<p>The distance was short, and he knew what he could do. Like a
flash his left hand shot forward, and the flint of the arrow went
directly through the narrow portion of the rattlesnake's body,
a few inches below its head. So powerful was the throw that the
upper portion was carried backward and pinned to the earth.</p>

<p>The <em>crotalus</em> species is so easily killed that a slight
blow is sufficient to render it helpless. The arrow, which had
transfixed the serpent in front of Deerfoot, destroyed the reptile
so suddenly that it made only a few furious whippings, when it
was dead.</p>

<p>The youth felt not the slightest fear of the reptile, but he
dreaded lest its threshings should attract the notice of the Wyandots,
whom he furtively watched, until the rattlesnake lay still.</p>

<p>One of the warriors did look around, as though he heard something
unusual, but he seemed satisfied with a mere glance, and, turning
back, sighted his gun at the block-house and threw away a charge,
as so many of his people were doing around him.</p>

<p>"Now is my chance," thought Deerfoot, as he once more began his
stealthy, shadow-like creeping around the decayed log, from behind
which had glided the venomous serpent that confronted him.</p>

<p>The dead reptile still lay in his path, and Deerfoot reached
his bow forward, thrust one end under it and flung it aside, for
he shared the sentiments of the great generality of mankind, who
look upon all ophidians as the most detestable plagues which encumber
the earth.</p>
