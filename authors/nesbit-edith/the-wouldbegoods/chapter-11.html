The tramp was very dusty about the feet and legs, and his clothes
were very ragged and dirty, but he had cheerful twinkly grey eyes,
and he touched his cap to the girls when he spoke to us, though a
little as though he would rather not.</p>

<p>We were on the top of the big wall of the Roman ruin in the Three
Tree pasture.  We had just concluded a severe siege with bows and
arrows - the ones that were given us to make up for the pistol that
was confiscated after the sad but not sinful occasion when it shot
a fox.</p>

<p>To avoid accidents that you would be sorry for afterwards, Oswald,
in his thoughtfulness, had decreed that everyone was to wear wire
masks.</p>

<p>Luckily there were plenty of these, because a man who lived in the
Moat House once went to Rome, where they throw hundreds and
thousands at each other in play, and call it a Comfit Battle or
Battaglia di Confetti (that's real Italian).  And he wanted to get
up that sort of thing among the village people - but they were too
beastly slack, so he chucked it.</p>

<p>And in the attic were the wire masks he brought home with him from
Rome, which people wear to prevent the nasty comfits getting in
their mouths and eyes.</p>

<p>So we were all armed to the teeth with masks and arrows, but in
attacking or defending a fort your real strength is not in your
equipment, but in your power of Shove.  Oswald, Alice, Noel and
Denny defended the fort.  We were much the strongest side, but that
was how Dicky and Oswald picked up.</p>

<p>The others got in, it is true, but that was only because an arrow
hit Dicky on the nose, and it bled quarts as usual, though hit only
through the wire mask.  Then he put into dock for repairs, and
while the defending party weren't looking he sneaked up the wall at
the back and shoved Oswald off, and fell on top of him, so that the
fort, now that it had lost its gallant young leader, the life and
soul of the besieged party, was of course soon overpowered, and had
to surrender.</p>

<p>Then we sat on the top and ate some peppermints Albert's uncle
brought us a bag of from Maidstone when he went to fetch away the
Roman pottery we tried to sell the Antiquities with.</p>

<p>The battle was over, and peace raged among us as we sat in the sun
on the big wall and looked at the fields, all blue and swimming in
the heat.</p>

<p>We saw the tramp coming through the beetfield.  He made a dusty
blot on the fair scene.</p>

<p>When he saw us he came close to the wall, and touched his cap, as
I have said, and remarked - </p>

<p>'Excuse me interrupting of your sports, young gentlemen and ladies,
but if you could so far oblige as to tell a labouring man the way
to the nearest pub.  It's a dry day and no error.'</p>

<p>'The &quot;Rose and Crown&quot; is the best pub,' said Dicky, 'and the
landlady is a friend of ours.  It's about a mile if you go by the
field path.'</p>

<p>'Lor' love a duck!' said the tramp, 'a mile's a long way, and
walking's a dry job this 'ere weather.'  We said we agreed with
him.</p>

<p>'Upon my sacred,' said the tramp, 'if there was a pump handy I
believe I'd take a turn at it - I would indeed, so help me if I
wouldn't!  Though water always upsets me and makes my 'and shaky.'</p>

<p>We had not cared much about tramps since the adventure of the
villainous sailor-man and the Tower of Mystery, but we had the dogs
on the wall with us (Lady was awfully difficult to get up, on
account of her long deer-hound legs), and the position was a strong
one, and easy to defend.  Besides the tramp did not look like that
bad sailor, nor talk like it.  And we considerably outnumbered the
tramp, anyway.</p>

<p>Alice nudged Oswald and said something about Sir Philip Sidney and
the tramp's need being greater than his, so Oswald was obliged to
go to the hole in the top of the wall where we store provisions
during sieges and get out the bottle of ginger-beer which he had
gone without when the others had theirs so as to drink it when he
got really thirsty.  Meanwhile Alice said - </p>

<p>'We've got some ginger-beer; my brother's getting it.  I hope you
won't mind drinking out of our glass.  We can't wash it, you
know - unless we rinse it out with a little ginger-beer.'</p>

<p>'Don't ye do it, miss,' he said eagerly; 'never waste good liquor
on washing.'</p>

<p>The glass was beside us on the wall.  Oswald filled it with
ginger-beer and handed down the foaming tankard to the tramp.  He
had to lie on his young stomach to do this.</p>

<p>The tramp was really quite polite - one of Nature's gentlemen, and
a man as well, we found out afterwards.  He said - </p>

<p>'Here's to you!' before he drank.  Then he drained the glass till
the rim rested on his nose.</p>

<p>'Swelp me, but I WAS dry,' he said.  'Don't seem to matter much
what it is, this weather, do it? - so long as it's suthink wet. 
Well, here's thanking you.'</p>

<p>'You're very welcome,' said Dora; 'I'm glad you liked it.'</p>

<p>'Like it?' - said he.  'I don't suppose you know what it's like to
have a thirst on you.  Talk of free schools and free libraries, and
free baths and wash-houses and such!  Why don't someone start free
DRINKS?  He'd be a ero, he would.  I'd vote for him any day of the
week and one over.  Ef yer don't objec I'll set down a bit and put
on a pipe.'</p>

<p>He sat down on the grass and began to smoke.  We asked him
questions about himself, and he told us many of his secret
sorrows - especially about there being no work nowadays for an
honest man.  At last he dropped asleep in the middle of a story
about a vestry he worked for that hadn't acted fair and square by
him like he had by them, or it (I don't know if vestry is singular
or plural), and we went home.  But before we went we held a hurried
council and collected what money we could from the little we had
with us (it was ninepence-halfpenny), and wrapped it in an old
envelope Dicky had in his pocket and put it gently on the billowing
middle of the poor tramp's sleeping waistcoat, so that he would
find it when he woke.  None of the dogs said a single syllable
while we were doing this, so we knew they believed him to be poor
but honest, and we always find it safe to take their word for
things like that.</p>

<p>As we went home a brooding silence fell upon us; we found out
afterwards that those words of the poor tramp's about free drinks
had sunk deep in all our hearts, and rankled there.</p>

<p>After dinner we went out and sat with our feet in the stream. 
People tell you it makes your grub disagree with you to do this
just after meals, but it never hurts us.  There is a fallen willow
across the stream that just seats the eight of us, only the ones at
the end can't get their feet into the water properly because of the
bushes, so we keep changing places.  We had got some liquorice root
to chew.  This helps thought.  Dora broke a peaceful silence with
this speech - </p>

<p>'Free drinks.'</p>

<p>The words awoke a response in every breast.</p>

<p>'I wonder someone doesn't,' H. O. said, leaning back till he nearly
toppled in, and was only saved by Oswald and Alice at their own
deadly peril.</p>

<p>'Do for goodness sake sit still, H. O.,' observed Alice.  'It would
be a glorious act!  I wish WE could.'</p>

<p>'What, sit still?' asked H. O.</p>

<p>'No, my child,' replied Oswald, 'most of us can do that when we
try.  Your angel sister was only wishing to set up free drinks for
the poor and thirsty.'</p>

<p>'Not for all of them,' Alice said, 'just a few.  Change places now,
Dicky.  My feet aren't properly wet at all.'</p>

<p>It is very difficult to change places safely on the willow.  The
changers have to crawl over the laps of the others, while the rest
sit tight and hold on for all they're worth.  But the hard task was
accomplished and then Alice went on - </p>

<p>'And we couldn't do it for always, only a day or two - just while
our money held out.  Eiffel Tower lemonade's the best, and you get
a jolly lot of it for your money too.  There must be a great many
sincerely thirsty persons go along the Dover Road every day.'</p>

<p>'It wouldn't be bad.  We've got a little chink between us,' said
Oswald.</p>

<p>'And then think how the poor grateful creatures would linger and
tell us about their inmost sorrows.  It would be most frightfully
interesting.  We could write all their agonied life histories down
afterwards like All the Year Round Christmas numbers.  Oh, do
let's!'</p>

<p>Alice was wriggling so with earnestness that Dicky thumped her to
make her calm.</p>

<p>'We might do it, just for one day,' Oswald said, 'but it wouldn't
be much - only a drop in the ocean compared with the enormous
dryness of all the people in the whole world.  Still, every little
helps, as the mermaid said when she cried into the sea.'</p>

<p>'I know a piece of poetry about that,' Denny said.</p>

<blockquote><div>'Small things are best.<br />
Care and unrest<br />
To wealth and rank are given,<br />
But little things<br />
On little wings - <br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>do something or other, I forget what, but it means the same as
Oswald was saying about the mermaid.'</p>

<p>'What are you going to call it?' asked Noel, coming out of a dream.</p>

<p>'Call what?'</p>

<p>'The Free Drinks game.'</p>

<blockquote><div>'It's a horrid shame<br />
If the Free Drinks game<br />
Doesn't have a name.<br />
You would be to blame<br />
If anyone came<br />
And - '<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>'Oh, shut up!' remarked Dicky.  'You've been making that rot up all
the time we've been talking instead of listening properly.'  Dicky
hates poetry.  I don't mind it so very much myself, especially
Macaulay's and Kipling's and Noel's.</p>

<p>'There was a lot more - &quot;lame&quot; and &quot;dame&quot; and name&quot; and &quot;game&quot; and
things - and now I've forgotten it,' Noel said in gloom.</p>

<p>'Never mind,' Alice answered, 'it'll come back to you in the silent
watches of the night; you see if it doesn't.  But really, Noel's
right, it OUGHT to have a name.'</p>

<p>'Free Drinks Company.'  'Thirsty Travellers' Rest.'  'The
Travellers' joy.'</p>

<p>These names were suggested, but not cared for extra.</p>

<p>Then someone said - I think it was Oswald -  'Why not &quot;The House
Beautiful&quot;?'</p>

<p>'It can't be a house, it must be in the road.  It'll only be a
stall.'</p>

<p>'The &quot;Stall Beautiful&quot; is simply silly,' Oswald said.</p>

<p>'The &quot;Bar Beautiful&quot; then,' said Dicky, who knows what the 'Rose
and Crown' bar is like inside, which of course is hidden from
girls.</p>

<p>'Oh, wait a minute,' cried the Dentist, snapping his fingers like
he always does when he is trying to remember things.  'I thought of
something, only Daisy tickled me and it's gone - I know - let's call
it the Benevolent Bar!'</p>

<p>It was exactly right, and told the whole truth in two words. 
'Benevolent' showed it was free and 'Bar' showed what was free;
e.g. things to drink.  The 'Benevolent Bar' it was.</p>

<p>We went home at once to prepare for the morrow, for of course we
meant to do it the very next day.  Procrastination is you know
what - and delays are dangerous.  If we had waited long we might
have happened to spend our money on something else.</p>

<p>The utmost secrecy had to be observed, because Mrs Pettigrew hates
tramps.  Most people do who keep fowls.  Albert's uncle was in
London till the next evening, so we could not consult him, but we
know he is always chock full of intelligent sympathy with the poor
and needy.</p>

<p>Acting with the deepest disguise, we made an awning to cover the
Benevolent Bar keepers from the searching rays of the monarch of
the skies.  We found some old striped sun-blinds in the attic, and
the girls sewed them together.  They were not very big when they
were done, so we added the girls' striped petticoats.  I am sorry
their petticoats turn up so constantly in my narrative, but they
really are very useful, especially when the band is cut off.  The
girls borrowed Mrs Pettigrew's sewing-machine; they could not ask
her leave without explanations, which we did not wish to give just
then, and she had lent it to them before.  They took it into the
cellar to work it, so that she should not hear the noise and ask
bothering questions.</p>

<p>They had to balance it on one end of the beer-stand.  It was not
easy.  While they were doing the sewing we boys went out and got
willow poles and chopped the twigs off, and got ready as well as we
could to put up the awning.</p>

<p>When we returned a detachment of us went down to the shop in the
village for Eiffel Tower lemonade.  We bought seven-and-sixpence
worth; then we made a great label to say what the bar was for. 
Then there was nothing else to do except to make rosettes out of a
blue sash of Daisy's to show we belonged to the Benevolent Bar.</p>

<p>The next day was as hot as ever.  We rose early from our innocent
slumbers, and went out to the Dover Road to the spot we had marked
down the day before.  It was at a cross-roads, so as to be able to
give drinks to as many people as possible.</p>

<p>We hid the awning and poles behind the hedge and went home to
brekker.</p>

<p>After break we got the big zinc bath they wash clothes in, and
after filling it with clean water we just had to empty it again
because it was too heavy to lift.  So we carried it vacant to the
trysting-spot and left H. O. and Noel to guard it while we went and
fetched separate pails of water; very heavy work, and no one who
wasn't really benevolent would have bothered about it for an
instant.  Oswald alone carried three pails.  So did Dicky and the
Dentist.  Then we rolled down some empty barrels and stood up three
of them by the roadside, and put planks on them.  This made a very
first-class table, and we covered it with the best tablecloth we
could find in the linen cupboard.  We brought out several glasses
and some teacups - not the best ones, Oswald was firm about
that - and the kettle and spirit-lamp and the tea-pot, in case any
weary tramp-woman fancied a cup of tea instead of Eiffel Tower.  H.
O. and Noel had to go down to the shop for tea; they need not have
grumbled; they had not carried any of the water.  And their having
to go the second time was only because we forgot to tell them to
get some real lemons to put on the bar to show what the drink would
be like when you got it.  The man at the shop kindly gave us tick
for the lemons, and we cashed up out of our next week's
pocket-money.</p>

<p>Two or three people passed while we were getting things ready, but
no one said anything except the man who said, 'Bloomin'
Sunday-school treat', and as it was too early in the day for anyone
to be thirsty we did not stop the wayfarers to tell them their
thirst could be slaked without cost at our Benevolent Bar.</p>

<p>But when everything was quite ready, and our blue rosettes fastened
on our breasts over our benevolent hearts, we stuck up the great
placard we had made with 'Benevolent Bar.  Free Drinks to all Weary
Travellers', in white wadding on red calico, like Christmas
decorations in church.  We had meant to fasten this to the edge of
the awning, but we had to pin it to the front of the tablecloth,
because I am sorry to say the awning went wrong from the first.  We
could not drive the willow poles into the road; it was much too
hard.  And in the ditch it was too soft, besides being no use.  So
we had just to cover our benevolent heads with our hats, and take
it in turns to go into the shadow of the tree on the other side of
the road.  For we had pitched our table on the sunny side of the
way, of course, relying on our broken-reed-like awning, and wishing
to give it a fair chance.</p>

<p>Everything looked very nice, and we longed to see somebody really
miserable come along so as to be able to allieve their distress.</p>

<p>A man and woman were the first: they stopped and stared, but when
Alice said, 'Free drinks!  Free drinks!  Aren't you thirsty?' they
said, 'No thank you,' and went on.  Then came a person from the
village - he didn't even say 'Thank you' when we asked him, and
Oswald began to fear it might be like the awful time when we
wandered about on Christmas Day trying to find poor persons and
persuade them to eat our Conscience pudding.</p>

<p>But a man in a blue jersey and a red bundle eased Oswald's fears by
being willing to drink a glass of lemonade, and even to say, 'Thank
you, I'm sure' quite nicely.</p>

<p>After that it was better.  As we had foreseen, there were plenty of
thirsty people walking along the Dover Road, and even some from the
cross-road.</p>

<p>We had had the pleasure of seeing nineteen tumblers drained to the
dregs ere we tasted any ourselves.  Nobody asked for tea.</p>

<p>More people went by than we gave lemonade to.  Some wouldn't have
it because they were too grand.  One man told us he could pay for
his own liquor when he was dry, which, praise be, he wasn't over
and above, at present; and others asked if we hadn't any beer, and
when we said 'No', they said it showed what sort we were - as if the
sort was not a good one, which it is.</p>

<p>And another man said, 'Slops again!  You never get nothing for
nothing, not this side of heaven you don't.  Look at the bloomin'
blue ribbon on 'em!  Oh, Lor'!' and went on quite sadly without
having a drink.</p>

<p>Our Pig-man who helped us on the Tower of Mystery day went by and
we hailed him, and explained it all to him and gave him a drink,
and asked him to call as he came back.  He liked it all, and said
we were a real good sort.  How different from the man who wanted
the beer.  Then he went on.</p>

<p>One thing I didn't like, and that was the way boys began to gather.
Of course we could not refuse to give drinks to any traveller who
was old enough to ask for it, but when one boy had had three
glasses of lemonade and asked for another, Oswald said - </p>

<p>'I think you've had jolly well enough.  You can't be really thirsty
after all that lot.'</p>

<p>The boy said, 'Oh, can't I?  You'll just see if I can't,' and went
away.  Presently he came back with four other boys, all bigger than
Oswald; and they all asked for lemonade.  Oswald gave it to the
four new ones, but he was determined in his behaviour to the other
one, and wouldn't give him a drop.  Then the five of them went and
sat on a gate a little way off and kept laughing in a nasty way,
and whenever a boy went by they called out - </p>

<p>'I say, 'ere's a go,' and as often as not the new boy would hang
about with them.  It was disquieting, for though they had nearly
all had lemonade we could see it had not made them friendly.</p>

<p>A great glorious glow of goodness gladdened (those go all together
and are called alliteration) our hearts when we saw our own tramp
coming down the road.  The dogs did not growl at him as they had at
the boys or the beer-man.  (I did not say before that we had the
dogs with us, but of course we had, because we had promised never
to go out without them.) Oswald said, 'Hullo,' and the tramp said,
'Hullo.'  Then Alice said, 'You see we've taken your advice; we're
giving free drinks.  Doesn't it all look nice?'</p>

<p>'It does that,' said the tramp.  'I don't mind if I do.'</p>

<p>So we gave him two glasses of lemonade succeedingly, and thanked
him for giving us the idea.  He said we were very welcome, and if
we'd no objection he'd sit down a bit and put on a pipe.  He did,
and after talking a little more he fell asleep.  Drinking anything
seemed to end in sleep with him.  I always thought it was only beer
and things made people sleepy, but he was not so.  When he was
asleep he rolled into the ditch, but it did not wake him up.</p>

<p>The boys were getting very noisy, and they began to shout things,
and to make silly noises with their mouths, and when Oswald and
Dicky went over to them and told them to just chuck it, they were
worse than ever.  I think perhaps Oswald and Dicky might have
fought and settled them - though there were eleven, yet back to back
you can always do it against overwhelming numbers in a book - only
Alice called out - </p>

<p>'Oswald, here's some more, come back!'</p>

<p>We went.  Three big men were coming down the road, very red and
hot, and not amiable-looking.  They stopped in front of the
Benevolent Bar and slowly read the wadding and red-stuff label.</p>

<p>Then one of them said he was blessed, or something like that, and
another said he was too.  The third one said, 'Blessed or not, a
drink's a drink.  Blue ribbon, though, by  - -' (a word you ought
not to say, though it is in the Bible and the catechism as well). 
'Let's have a liquor, little missy.'</p>

<p>The dogs were growling, but Oswald thought it best not to take any
notice of what the dogs said, but to give these men each a drink. 
So he did.  They drank, but not as if they cared about it very
much, and then they set their glasses down on the table, a liberty
no one else had entered into, and began to try and chaff Oswald. 
Oswald said in an undervoice to H. O. - </p>

<p>'Just take charge.  I want to speak to the girls a sec.  Call if
you want anything.'  And then he drew the others away, to say he
thought there'd been enough of it, and considering the boys and new
three men, perhaps we'd better chuck it and go home.  We'd been
benevolent nearly four hours anyway.</p>

<p>While this conversation and the objections of the others were going
on, H. O. perpetuated an act which nearly wrecked the Benevolent
Bar.</p>

<p>Of course Oswald was not an eye or ear witness of what happened,
but from what H. O. said in the calmer moments of later life, I
think this was about what happened.  One of the big disagreeable
men said to H. O. - </p>

<p>'Ain't got such a thing as a drop o' spirit, 'ave yer?'</p>

<p>H. O. said no, we hadn't, only lemonade and tea.</p>

<p>'Lemonade and tea! blank' (bad word I told you about) 'and blazes,'
replied the bad character, for such he afterwards proved to be. 
'What's THAT then?'</p>

<p>He pointed to a bottle labelled Dewar's whisky, which stood on the
table near the spirit-kettle.</p>

<p>'Oh, is THAT what you want?' said H. O. kindly.</p>

<p>The man is understood to have said he should bloomin' well think
so, but H. O. is not sure about the 'bloomin'.</p>

<p>He held out his glass with about half the lemonade in it, and H. O.
generously filled up the tumbler out of the bottle, labelled
Dewar's whisky.  The man took a great drink, and then suddenly he
spat out what happened to be left in his mouth just then, and began
to swear.  It was then that Oswald and Dicky rushed upon the scene.</p>

<p>The man was shaking his fist in H. O.'s face, and H. O. was still
holding on to the bottle we had brought out the methylated spirit
in for the lamp, in case of anyone wanting tea, which they hadn't.
'If I was Jim,' said the second ruffian, for such indeed they were,
when he had snatched the bottle from H. O. and smelt it, 'I'd chuck
the whole show over the hedge, so I would, and you young gutter-
snipes after it, so I wouldn't.'</p>

<p>Oswald saw in a moment that in point of strength, if not numbers,
he and his party were out-matched, and the unfriendly boys were
drawing gladly near.  It is no shame to signal for help when in
distress - the best ships do it every day.  Oswald shouted 'Help,
help!' Before the words were out of his brave yet trembling lips
our own tramp leapt like an antelope from the ditch and said - </p>

<p>'Now then, what's up?'</p>

<p>The biggest of the three men immediately knocked him down.  He lay
still.</p>

<p>The biggest then said, 'Come on - any more of you?  Come on!'</p>

<p>Oswald was so enraged at this cowardly attack that he actually hit
out at the big man - and he really got one in just above the belt. 
Then he shut his eyes, because he felt that now all was indeed up. 
There was a shout and a scuffle, and Oswald opened his eyes in
astonishment at finding himself still whole and unimpaired.  Our
own tramp had artfully simulated insensibleness, to get the men off
their guard, and then had suddenly got his arms round a leg each of
two of the men, and pulled them to the ground, helped by Dicky, who
saw his game and rushed in at the same time, exactly like Oswald
would have done if he had not had his eyes shut ready to meet his
doom.</p>

<p>The unpleasant boys shouted, and the third man tried to help his
unrespectable friends, now on their backs involved in a desperate
struggle with our own tramp, who was on top of them, accompanied by
Dicky.  It all happened in a minute, and it was all mixed up.  The
dogs were growling and barking - Martha had one of the men by the
trouser leg and Pincher had another; the girls were screaming like
mad and the strange boys shouted and laughed (little beasts!), and
then suddenly our Pig-man came round the corner, and two friends of
his with him.  He had gone and fetched them to take care of us if
anything unpleasant occurred.  It was a very thoughtful, and just
like him.</p>

<p>'Fetch the police!' cried the Pig-man in noble tones, and H. O.
started running to do it.  But the scoundrels struggled from under
Dicky and our tramp, shook off the dogs and some bits of trouser,
and fled heavily down the road.</p>

<p>Our Pig-man said, 'Get along home!' to the disagreeable boys, and
'Shoo'd' them as if they were hens, and they went.  H. O. ran back
when they began to go up the road, and there we were, all standing
breathless in tears on the scene of the late desperate engagement. 
Oswald gives you his word of honour that his and Dicky's tears were
tears of pure rage.  There are such things as tears of pure rage. 
Anyone who knows will tell you so.</p>

<p>We picked up our own tramp and bathed the lump on his forehead with
lemonade.  The water in the zinc bath had been upset in the
struggle.  Then he and the Pig-man and his kind friends helped us
carry our things home.</p>

<p>The Pig-man advised us on the way not to try these sort of kind
actions without getting a grown-up to help us.  We've been advised
this before, but now I really think we shall never try to be
benevolent to the poor and needy again.  At any rate not unless we
know them very well first.</p>

<p>We have seen our own tramp often since.  The Pig-man gave him a
job.  He has got work to do at last.  The Pig-man says he is not
such a very bad chap, only he will fall asleep after the least drop
of drink.  We know that is his failing.  We saw it at once.  But it
was lucky for us he fell asleep that day near our benevolent bar.</p>

<p>I will not go into what my father said about it all.  There was a
good deal in it about minding your own business - there generally is
in most of the talkings-to we get.  But he gave our tramp a
sovereign, and the Pig-man says he went to sleep on it for a solid
week.</p>
