Next day Ann Veronica and Capes felt like newborn things.  It
seemed to them they could never have been really alive before,
but only dimly anticipating existence.  They sat face to face
beneath an experienced-looking rucksack and a brand new
portmanteau and a leather handbag, in the afternoon-boat train
that goes from Charing Cross to Folkestone for Boulogne.  They
tried to read illustrated papers in an unconcerned manner and
with forced attention, lest they should catch the leaping
exultation in each other's eyes. And they admired Kent sedulously
from the windows.
<P>
They crossed the Channel in sunshine and a breeze that just
ruffled the sea to glittering scales of silver. Some of the
people who watched them standing side by side thought they must
be newly wedded because of their happy faces, and others that
they were an old-established couple because of their easy
confidence in each other.
<P>
At Boulogne they took train to Basle; next morning they
breakfasted together in the buffet of that station, and thence
they caught the Interlaken express, and so went by way of Spies
to Frutigen.  There was no railway  beyond Frutigen in those
days; they sent their baggage by post to Kandersteg, and walked
along the mule path to the left of the stream to that queer
hollow among the precipices, Blau See, where the petrifying
branches of trees lie in the blue deeps of an icy lake, and
pine-trees clamber among gigantic boulders.  A little inn flying
a Swiss flag nestles under a great rock, and there they put aside
their knapsacks and lunched and rested in the mid-day shadow of
the gorge and the scent of resin.  And later they paddled in a
boat above the mysterious deeps of the See, and peered down into
the green-blues and the blue-greens together.  By that time it
seemed to them they had lived together twenty years.
<P>
Except for one memorable school excursion to Paris, Ann Veronica
had never yet been outside England.  So that it seemed to her the
whole world had changed--the very light of it had changed. 
Instead of English villas and cottages there were chalets and
Italian-built houses shining white; there were lakes of emerald
and sapphire and clustering castles, and such sweeps of hill and
mountain, such shining uplands of snow, as she had never seen
before.  Everything was fresh and bright, from the kindly manners
of the Frutigen cobbler, who hammered mountain nails into her
boots, to the unfamiliar wild flowers that spangled the wayside. 
And Capes had changed into the easiest and jolliest companion in
the world.  The mere fact that he was there in the train
alongside her, helping her, sitting opposite to her in the
dining-car, presently sleeping on a seat within a yard of her,
made her heart sing until she was afraid their fellow passengers
would hear it.  It was too good to be true.  She would not sleep
for fear of losing a moment of that sense of his proximity.  To
walk beside him, dressed akin to him, rucksacked and
companionable, was bliss in itself; each step she took was like
stepping once more across the threshold of heaven.
<P>
One trouble, however, shot its slanting bolts athwart the shining
warmth of that opening day and marred its perfection, and that
was the thought of her father.
<P>
She had treated him badly; she had hurt him and her aunt; she had
done wrong by their standards, and she would never persuade them
that she had done right. She thought of her father in the garden,
and of her aunt with her Patience, as she had seen them--how many
ages was it ago?  Just one day intervened.  She felt as if she
had struck them unawares.  The thought of them distressed her
without subtracting at all from the oceans of happiness in which
she swam.  But she wished she could put the thing she had done in
some way to them so that it would not hurt them so much as the
truth would certainly do.  The thought of their faces, and
particularly of her aunt's, as it would meet the fact--
disconcerted, unfriendly, condemning, pained--occurred to her
again and again.
<P>
"Oh!  I wish," she said, "that people thought alike about these
things."
<P>
Capes watched the limpid water dripping from his oar.  "I wish
they did," he said, "but they don't."
<P>
"I feel-- All this is the rightest of all conceivable things.  I
want to tell every one.  I want to boast myself."
<P>
"I know."
<P>
"I told them a lie.  I told them lies.  I wrote three letters
yesterday and tore them up.  It was so hopeless to put it to
them.  At last--I told a story."
<P>
"You didn't tell them our position?"
<P>
"I implied we had married."
<P>
"They'll find out.  They'll know."
<P>
"Not yet."
<P>
"Sooner or later."
<P>
"Possibly--bit by bit. . . .  But it was hopelessly hard to put. 
I said I knew he disliked and distrusted you and your work--that
you shared all Russell's opinions: he hates Russell beyond
measure--and that we couldn't possibly face a conventional
marriage.  What else could one say?  I left him to suppose--a
registry perhaps. . . ."
<P>
Capes let his oar smack on the water.
<P>
"Do you mind very much?"
<P>
He shook his head.
<P>
"But it makes me feel inhuman," he added.
<P>
"And me. . . ."
<P>
"It's the perpetual trouble," he said, "of parent and child. 
They can't help seeing things in the way they do.  Nor can we. 
WE don't think they're right, but they don't think we are.  A
deadlock.  In a very definite sense we are in the
wrong--hopelessly in the wrong.  But--It's just this: who was to
be hurt?"
<P>
"I wish no one had to be hurt," said Ann Veronica. "When one is
happy--I don't like to think of them. Last time I left home I
felt as hard as nails.  But this is all different.  It is
different."
<P>
"There's a sort of instinct of rebellion," said Capes. "It isn't
anything to do with our times particularly. People think it is,
but they are wrong.  It's to do with adolescence.  Long before
religion and Society heard of Doubt, girls were all for midnight
coaches and Gretna Green.  It's a sort of home-leaving instinct."
<P>
He followed up a line of thought.
<P>
"There's another instinct, too," he went on, "in a state of
suppression, unless I'm very much mistaken; a child-expelling
instinct. . . .  I wonder. . . .  There's no family uniting
instinct, anyhow; it's habit and sentiment and material
convenience hold families together after adolescence.  There's
always friction, conflict, unwilling concessions.  Always!  I
don't believe there is any strong natural affection at all
between parents and growing-up children.  There wasn't, I know,
between myself and my father.  I didn't allow myself to see
things as they were in those days; now I do.  I bored him.  I
hated him.  I suppose that shocks one's ideas. . . .  It's true.
. . .  There are sentimental and traditional deferences and
reverences, I know, between father and son; but that's just
exactly what prevents the development of an easy friendship. 
Father-worshipping sons are abnormal--and they're no good.  No
good at all.  One's got to be a better man than one's father, or
what is the good of successive generations?  Life is rebellion,
or nothing."
<P>
He rowed a stroke and watched the swirl of water from his oar
broaden and die away.  At last he took up his thoughts again:  "I
wonder if, some day, one won't need to rebel against customs and
laws?  If this discord will have gone?  Some day, perhaps--who
knows?--the old won't coddle and hamper the young, and the young
won't need to fly in the faces of the old. They'll face facts as
facts, and understand.  Oh, to face facts!  Gods! what a world it
might be if people faced facts!  Understanding!  Understanding! 
There is no other salvation.  Some day older people, perhaps,
will trouble to understand younger people, and there won't be
these fierce disruptions; there won't be barriers one must defy
or perish. . . .  That's really our choice now, defy--or
futility. . . .  The world, perhaps, will be educated out of its
idea of fixed standards. . . .  I wonder, Ann Veronica, if, when
our time comes, we shall be any wiser?"
<P>
Ann Veronica watched a water-beetle fussing across the green
depths.  "One can't tell.  I'm a female thing at bottom.  I like
high tone for a flourish and stars and ideas; but I want my
things."
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 2
<P>
<P>
Capes thought.
<P>
"It's odd--I have no doubt in my mind that what we are doing is
wrong," he said.  "And yet I do it without compunction."
<P>
"I never felt so absolutely right," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"You ARE a female thing at bottom," he admitted. "I'm not nearly
so sure as you.  As for me, I look twice at it. . . .  Life is
two things, that's how I see it; two things mixed and muddled up
together.  Life is morality--life is adventure.  Squire and
master. Adventure rules, and morality--looks up the trains in the
Bradshaw.  Morality tells you what is right, and adventure moves
you.  If morality means anything it means keeping bounds,
respecting implications, respecting implicit bounds.  If
individuality means anything it means breaking bounds--adventure.
<P>
Will you be  moral and your species, or immoral and yourself?
We've decided to be immoral.  We needn't try and give ourselves
airs.  We've deserted the posts in which we found ourselves, cut
our duties, exposed ourselves to risks that may destroy any sort
of social usefulness in us. . . .  I don't know.  One keeps rules
in order to be one's self.  One studies Nature in order not to be
blindly ruled by her.  There's no sense in morality, I suppose,
unless you are fundamentally immoral."
<P>
She watched his face as he traced his way through these
speculative thickets.
<P>
"Look at our affair," he went on, looking up at her. "No power on
earth will persuade me we're not two rather disreputable persons. 
You desert your home; I throw up useful teaching, risk every hope
in your career.  Here we are absconding, pretending to be what we
are not; shady, to say the least of it.  It's not a bit of good
pretending there's any Higher Truth or wonderful principle in
this business.  There isn't.  We never started out in any
high-browed manner to scandalize and Shelleyfy.  When first you
left your home you had no idea that _I_ was the hidden impulse. 
I wasn't.  You came out like an ant for your nuptial flight.  It
was just a chance that we in particular hit against each
other--nothing predestined about it.  We just hit against each
other, and here we are flying off at a tangent, a little
surprised at what we are doing, all our principles abandoned, and
tremendously and quite unreasonably proud of ourselves.  Out of
all this we have struck a sort of harmony. . . .  And it's
gorgeous!"
<P>
"Glorious!" said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"Would YOU like us--if some one told you the bare outline of our
story?--and what we are doing?"
<P>
"I shouldn't mind," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"But if some one else asked your advice?  If some one else said,
'Here is my teacher, a jaded married man on the verge of middle
age, and he and I have a violent passion for one another.  We
propose to disregard all our ties, all our obligations, all the
established prohibitions of society, and begin life together
afresh.'  What would you tell her?"
<P>
"If she asked advice, I should say she wasn't fit to do anything
of the sort.  I should say that having a doubt was enough to
condemn it."
<P>
"But waive that point."
<P>
"It would be different all the same.  It wouldn't be you."
<P>
"It wouldn't be you either.  I suppose that's the gist of the
whole thing."  He stared at a little eddy. "The rule's all right,
so long as there isn't a case.  Rules are for established things,
like the pieces and positions of a game.  Men and women are not
established things; they're experiments, all of them.  Every
human being is a new thing, exists to do new things.  Find the
thing you want to do most intensely, make sure that's it, and do
it with all your might.  If you live, well and good; if you die,
well and good.  Your purpose is done. . . . Well, this is OUR
thing."
<P>
He woke the glassy water to swirling activity again, and made the
deep-blue shapes below writhe and shiver.
<P>
"This is MY thing," said Ann Veronica, softly, with thoughtful
eyes upon him.
<P>
Then she looked up the sweep of pine-trees to the  towering
sunlit cliffs and the high heaven above and then back to his
face.  She drew in a deep breath of the sweet mountain air.  Her
eyes were soft and grave, and there was the faintest of smiles
upon her resolute lips.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 3
<P>
<P>
Later they loitered along a winding path above the inn, and made
love to one another.  Their journey had made them indolent, the
afternoon was warm, and it seemed impossible to breathe a sweeter
air.  The flowers and turf, a wild strawberry, a rare butterfly,
and suchlike little intimate things had become more interesting
than mountains.  Their flitting hands were always touching.  Deep
silences came between them. . . .
<P>
"I had thought to go on to Kandersteg," said Capes, "but this is
a pleasant place.  There is not a soul in the inn but ourselves. 
Let us stay the night here.  Then we can loiter and gossip to our
heart's content."
<P>
"Agreed," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"After all, it's our honeymoon."
<P>
"All we shall get," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"This place is very beautiful."
<P>
"Any place would be beautiful," said Ann Veronica, in a low
voice.
<P>
For a time they walked in silence.
<P>
"I wonder," she began, presently, "why I love you --and love you
so much? . . .  I know now what it is to be an abandoned female. 
I AM an abandoned female. I'm not ashamed--of the things I'm
doing.  I want to put myself into your hands.  You know--I wish I
could roll my little body up small and squeeze it into your hand
and grip your fingers upon it.  Tight.  I want you to hold me and
have me SO. . . .  Everything. Everything.  It's a pure joy of
giving--giving to YOU. I have never spoken of these things to any
human being. Just dreamed--and ran away even from my dreams.  It
is as if my lips had been sealed about them.  And now I break the
seals--for you.  Only I wish--I wish to-day I was a thousand
times, ten thousand times more beautiful."
<P>
Capes lifted her hand and kissed it.
<P>
"You are a thousand times more beautiful," he said, "than
anything else could be. . . .  You are you.  You are all the
beauty in the world.  Beauty doesn't mean, never has meant,
anything--anything at all but you. It heralded you, promised you.
. . ."
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 4
<P>
<P>
They lay side by side in a shallow nest of turf and mosses among
bowlders and stunted bushes on a high rock, and watched the day
sky deepen to evening between the vast precipices overhead and
looked over the tree-tops down the widening gorge.  A distant
suggestion of chalets and a glimpse of the road set them talking
for a time of the world they had left behind.
<P>
Capes spoke casually of their plans for work.  "It's a flabby,
loose-willed world we have to face.  It won't even know whether
to be scandalized at us or forgiving. It will hold aloof, a
little undecided whether to pelt or not--"
<P>
"That depends whether we carry ourselves as though we expected
pelting," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"We won't."
<P>
"No fear!"
<P>
"Then, as we succeed, it will begin to sidle back to us.  It will
do its best to overlook things--"
<P>
"If we let it, poor dear."
<P>
"That's if we succeed.  If we fail," said Capes, "then--"
<P>
"We aren't going to fail," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
Life seemed a very brave and glorious enterprise to Ann Veronica
that day.  She was quivering with the sense of Capes at her side
and glowing with heroic love; it seemed to her that if they put
their hands jointly against the Alps and pushed they would be
able to push them aside.  She lay and nibbled at a sprig of dwarf
rhododendron.
<P>
"FAIL!" she said.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 5
<P>
<P>
Presently it occurred to Ann Veronica to ask about the journey he
had planned.  He had his sections of the Siegfried map folded in
his pocket, and he squatted up with his legs crossed like an
Indian idol while she lay prone beside him and followed every
movement of his indicatory finger.
<P>
"Here," he said, "is this Blau See, and here we rest until
to-morrow.  I think we rest here until to-morrow?"
<P>
There was a brief silence.
<P>
"It is a very pleasant place," said Ann Veronica, biting a
rhododendron stalk through, and with that faint shadow of a smile
returning to her lips. . . .
<P>
"And then?" said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"Then we go on to this place, the Oeschinensee.  It's a lake
among precipices, and there is a little inn where we can stay,
and sit and eat our dinner at a pleasant table that looks upon
the lake.  For some days we shall be very idle there among the
trees and rocks.  There are boats on the lake and shady depths
and wildernesses of pine-wood.  After a day or so, perhaps, we
will go on one or two little excursions and see how good your
head is--a mild scramble or so; and then up to a hut on a pass
just here, and out upon the Blumlis-alp glacier that spreads out
so and so."
<P>
She roused herself from some dream at the word. "Glaciers?" she
said.
<P>
"Under the Wilde Frau--which was named after you."
<P>
He bent and kissed her hair and paused, and then forced his
attention back to the map.  "One day," he resumed, "we will start
off early and come down into Kandersteg and up these zigzags and
here and here, and so past this Daubensee to a tiny inn--it won't
be busy yet, though; we may get it all to ourselves--on the brim
of the steepest zigzag you can imagine, thousands of feet of
zigzag; and you will sit and eat lunch with me and look out
across the Rhone Valley and over blue distances beyond blue
distances to the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa and a long regiment of
sunny, snowy mountains. And when we see them we shall at once
want to go to them--that's the way with beautiful things--and
down we shall go, like flies down a wall, to Leukerbad, and so to
Leuk Station, here, and then by train up the Rhone Valley and
this little side valley to Stalden; and there, in the cool of the
afternoon, we shall start off up a gorge, torrents and cliffs
below us and above us, to sleep in a half-way inn, and go on next
day to Saas Fee, Saas of the Magic, Saas of the Pagan People. 
And there, about Saas, are ice and snows again, and sometimes we
will loiter among the rocks and trees about Saas or peep into
Samuel Butler's chapels, and sometimes we will climb up out of
the way of the other people on to the glaciers and snow.  And,
for one expedition at least, we will go up this desolate valley
here to Mattmark, and so on to Monte Moro.  There indeed you see
Monte Rosa.  Almost the best of all."
<P>
"Is it very beautiful?"
<P>
"When I saw it there it was very beautiful.  It was wonderful. 
It was the crowned queen of mountains in her robes of shining
white.  It towered up high above the level of the pass, thousands
of feet, still, shining, and white, and below, thousands of feet
below, was a floor of little woolly clouds.  And then presently
these clouds began to wear thin and expose steep, deep slopes,
going down and down, with grass and pine-trees, down and down,
and at last, through a great rent in the clouds, bare roofs,
shining like very minute pin-heads, and a road like a fibre of
white silk-Macugnana, in Italy.  That will be a fine day--it will
have to be, when first you set eyes on Italy. . . .  That's as
far as we go."
<P>
"Can't we go down into Italy?"
<P>
"No," he said; "it won't run to that now.  We must wave our hands
at the blue hills far away there and go back to London and work."
<P>
"But Italy--"
<P>
"Italy's for a good girl," he said, and laid his hand for a
moment on her shoulder.  "She must look forward to Italy."
<P>
"I say," she reflected, "you ARE rather the master, you know."
<P>
The idea struck him as novel.  "Of course I'm manager for this
expedition," he said, after an interval of self-examination.
<P>
She slid her cheek down the tweed sleeve of his coat.  "Nice
sleeve," she said, and came to his hand and kissed it.
<P>
"I say!" he cried.  "Look here!  Aren't you going a little too
far?  This--this is degradation--making a fuss with sleeves.  You
mustn't do things like that."
<P>
"Why not?"
<P>
"Free woman--and equal."
<P>
"I do it--of my own free will," said Ann Veronica, kissing his
hand again.  "It's nothing to what I WILL do."
<P>
"Oh, well!" he said, a little doubtfully, "it's just a phase,"
and bent down and rested his hand on her shoulder for a moment,
with his heart beating and his nerves a-quiver.  Then as she lay
very still, with her hands clinched and her black hair tumbled
about her face, he came still closer and softly kissed the nape
of her neck. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 6
<P>
<P>
Most of the things that he had planned they did.  But they
climbed more than he had intended because Ann  Veronica proved
rather a good climber, steady-headed and plucky, rather daring,
but quite willing to be cautious at his command.
<P>
One of the things that most surprised him in her was her capacity
for blind obedience.  She loved to be told to do things.
<P>
He knew the circle of mountains about Saas Fee fairly well: he
had been there twice before, and it was fine to get away from the
straggling pedestrians into the high, lonely places, and sit and
munch sandwiches and talk together and do things together that
were just a little difficult and dangerous.  And they could talk,
they found; and never once, it seemed, did their meaning and
intention hitch.  They were enormously pleased with one another;
they found each other beyond measure better than they had
expected, if only because of the want of substance in mere
expectation.  Their conversation degenerated again and again into
a strain of self-congratulation that would have irked an
eavesdropper.
<P>
"You're--I don't know," said Ann Veronica. "You're splendid."
<P>
"It isn't that you're splendid or I," said Capes. "But we satisfy
one another.  Heaven alone knows why.  So completely!  The oddest
fitness!  What is it made of?  Texture of skin and texture of
mind? Complexion and voice.  I don't think I've got illusions,
nor you. . . .  If I had never met anything of you at all but a
scrap of your skin binding a book, Ann Veronica, I know I would
have kept that somewhere near to me. . . .  All your faults are
just jolly modelling to make you real and solid."
<P>
"The faults are the best part of it," said Ann Veronica; "why,
even our little vicious strains run the same way. Even our
coarseness."
<P>
"Coarse?" said Capes, "We're not coarse."
<P>
"But if we were?" said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"I can talk to you and you to me without a scrap of effort," said
Capes; "that's the essence of it.  It's made up of things as
small as the diameter of hairs and big as life and death. . . . 
One always dreamed of this and never believed it.  It's the
rarest luck, the wildest, most impossible accident.  Most people,
every one I know else, seem to have mated with foreigners and to
talk uneasily in unfamiliar tongues, to be afraid of the
knowledge the other one has, of the other one's perpetual
misjudgment and misunderstandings.
<P>
"Why don't they wait?" he added.
<P>
Ann Veronica had one of her flashes of insight.
<P>
"One doesn't wait," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
She expanded that.  "_I_ shouldn't have waited," she said.  "I
might have muddled for a time.  But it's as you say.  I've had
the rarest luck and fallen on my feet."
<P>
"We've both fallen on our feet!  We're the rarest of mortals! 
The real thing!  There's not a compromise nor a sham nor a
concession between us.  We aren't afraid; we don't bother.  We
don't consider each other; we needn't. That wrappered life, as
you call it--we've burned the confounded rags!  Danced out of it! 
We're stark!"
<P>
"Stark!" echoed Ann Veronica.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 7
<P>
<P>
As they came back from that day's climb--it was up the
Mittaghorn--they had to cross a shining space  of wet, steep
rocks between two grass slopes that needed a little care.  There
were a few loose, broken fragments of rock to reckon with upon
the ledges, and one place where hands did as much work as toes. 
They used the rope--not that a rope was at all necessary, but
because Ann Veronica's exalted state of mind made the fact of the
rope agreeably symbolical; and, anyhow, it did insure a joint
death in the event of some remotely possibly mischance.  Capes
went first, finding footholds and, where the drops in the
strata-edges came like long, awkward steps, placing Ann
Veronica's feet.  About half-way across this interval, when
everything seemed going well, Capes had a shock.
<P>
"Heavens!" exclaimed Ann Veronica, with extraordinary passion. 
"My God!" and ceased to move.
<P>
Capes became rigid and adhesive.  Nothing ensued. "All right?" he
asked.
<P>
"I'll have to pay it."
<P>
"Eh?"
<P>
"I've forgotten something.  Oh, cuss it!"
<P>
"Eh?"
<P>
"He said I would."
<P>
"What?"
<P>
"That's the devil of it!"
<P>
"Devil of what? . . .  You DO use vile language!"
<P>
"Forget about it like this."
<P>
"Forget WHAT?"
<P>
"And I said I wouldn't.  I said I'd do anything.  I said I'd make
shirts."
<P>
"Shirts?"
<P>
"Shirts at one--and--something a dozen.  Oh, goodness! Bilking! 
Ann Veronica, you're a bilker!"
<P>
Pause.
<P>
"Will you tell me what all this is about?" said Capes.
<P>
"It's about forty pounds."
<P>
Capes waited patiently.
<P>
"G.  I'm sorry. . . .  But you've got to lend me forty pounds."
<P>
"It's some sort of delirium," said Capes.  "The rarefied air?  I
thought you had a better head."
<P>
"No!  I'll explain lower.  It's all right.  Let's go on climbing
now.  It's a thing I've unaccountably overlooked.  All right
really.  It can wait a bit longer. I borrowed forty pounds from
Mr. Ramage.  Thank goodness you'll understand.  That's why I
chucked Manning. . . .  All right, I'm coming.  But all this
business has driven it clean out of my head. . . .  That's why he
was so annoyed, you know."
<P>
"Who was annoyed?"
<P>
"Mr. Ramage--about the forty pounds."  She took a step.  "My
dear," she added, by way of afterthought, "you DO obliterate
things!"

They found themselves next day talking love to one another high
up on some rocks above a steep bank of snow that overhung a
precipice on the eastern side of the Fee glacier.  By this time
Capes' hair had bleached nearly white, and his skin had become a
skin of red copper shot with gold.  They were now both in a state
of unprecedented physical fitness.  And such skirts as Ann
Veronica had had when she entered the valley of Saas were safely
packed away in the hotel, and she wore a leather belt and loose
knickerbockers and puttees--a costume that suited the fine, long
lines of her limbs far better than any feminine walking-dress
could do.  Her complexion had resisted the snow-glare
wonderfully; her skin had only deepened its natural warmth a
little under the Alpine sun.  She had pushed aside her azure
veil, taken off her snow-glasses, and sat smiling under her hand
at the shining glories--the lit cornices, the blue shadows, the
softly rounded, enormous snow masses, the deep places full of
quivering luminosity--of the Taschhorn and Dom.  The sky was
cloudless, effulgent blue.
<P>
Capes sat watching and admiring her, and then he fell praising
the day and fortune and their love for each other.
<P>
"Here we are," he said, "shining through each other like light
through a stained-glass window.  With this air in our blood, this
sunlight soaking us. . . .  Life is so good.  Can it ever be so
good again?"
<P>
Ann Veronica put out a firm hand and squeezed his arm.  "It's
very good," she said.  "It's glorious good!"
<P>
"Suppose now--look at this long snow-slope and then that blue
deep beyond--do you see that round pool of color in the ice--a
thousand feet or more below?  Yes? Well, think--we've got to go
but ten steps and lie down and put our arms about each other. 
See?  Down we should rush in a foam--in a cloud of snow--to
flight and a dream.  All the rest of our lives would be together
then, Ann Veronica.  Every moment.  And no ill-chances."
<P>
"If you tempt me too much ," she said, after a silence, "I shall
do it.  I need only just jump up and throw myself upon you.  I'm
a desperate young woman. And then as we went down you'd try to
explain.  And that would spoil it. . . .  You know you don't mean
it."
<P>
"No, I don't.  But I liked to say it."
<P>
"Rather!  But I wonder why you don't mean it?"
<P>
"Because, I suppose, the other thing is better.  What other
reason could there be?  It's more complex, but it's better. 
THIS, this glissade, would be damned scoundrelism.  You know
that, and I know that, though we might be put to it to find a
reason why.  It would be swindling.  Drawing the pay of life and
then not living.  And besides--We're going to live, Ann
Veronica!  Oh, the things we'll do, the life we'll lead! There'll
be trouble in it at times--you and I aren't going to run without
friction.  But we've got the brains to get over that, and tongues
in our heads to talk to each other.  We sha'n't hang up on any
misunderstanding. Not us.  And we're going to fight that old
world down there.  That old world that had shoved up that silly
old hotel, and all the rest of it. . . .  If we don't live it
will think we are afraid of it. . . .  Die, indeed!  We're going
to do work; we're going to unfold about each other; we're going
to have children."
<P>
"Girls!" cried Ann Veronica.
<P>
"Boys!" said Capes.
<P>
"Both!" said Ann Veronica.  "Lots of 'em!"
<P>
Capes chuckled.  "You delicate female!"
<P>
"Who cares," said Ann Veronica, "seeing it's you? Warm, soft
little wonders!  Of course I want them."
<P>
<P>
<P>

"All sorts of things we're going to do," said Capes; "all sorts
of times we're going to have.  Sooner or later we'll certainly do
something to clean those prisons you told me about--limewash the
underside of life.  You and I.  We can love on a snow cornice, we
can love over a pail of whitewash.  Love anywhere.  Anywhere!
Moonlight and music--pleasing, you know, but quite unnecessary. 
We met dissecting dogfish. . . .  Do you remember your first day
with me? . . .  Do you indeed remember?  The smell of decay and
cheap methylated spirit! . . .  My dear! we've had so many
moments!  I used to go over the times we'd had together, the
things we'd said--like a rosary of beads.  But now it's beads by
the cask--like the hold of a West African trader.  It feels like
too much gold-dust clutched in one's hand.  One doesn't want to
lose a grain.  And one must--some of it must slip through one's
fingers."
<P>
"I don't care if it does," said Ann Veronica.  "I don't care a
rap for remembering.  I care for you.  This moment couldn't be
better until the next moment comes. That's how it takes me.  Why
should WE hoard?  We aren't going out presently, like Japanese
lanterns in a gale.  It's the poor dears who do, who know they
will, know they can't keep it up, who need to clutch at way-side
flowers.  And put 'em in little books for remembrance. Flattened
flowers aren't for the likes of us. Moments, indeed!  We like
each other fresh and fresh. It isn't illusions--for us.  We two
just love each other --the real, identical other--all the time."
<P>
"The real, identical other," said Capes, and took and bit the tip
of her little finger.
<P>
"There's no delusions, so far as I know," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"I don't believe there is one.  If there is, it's a mere
wrapping--there's better underneath.  It's only as if I'd begun
to know you the day before yesterday or there-abouts.  You keep
on coming truer, after you have seemed to come altogether true. 
You. . . .  brick!"

"To think," he cried, "you are ten years younger than I! . . . 
There are times when you make me feel a little thing at your
feet--a young, silly, protected thing. Do you know, Ann Veronica,
it is all a lie about your birth certificate; a forgery--and
fooling at that.  You are one of the Immortals.  Immortal!  You
were in the beginning, and all the men in the world who have
known what love is have worshipped at your feet.  You have
converted me to--Lester Ward!  You are my dear friend, you are a
slip of a girl, but there are moments when my head has been on
your breast, when your heart has been beating close to my ears,
when I have known you for the goddess, when I have wished myself
your slave, when I have wished that you could kill me for the joy
of being killed by you.  You are the High Priestess of Life. . .
."
<P>
"Your priestess," whispered Ann Veronica, softly. "A silly little
priestess who knew nothing of life at all until she came to you."
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 11
<P>
<P>
They sat for a time without speaking a word, in an enormous
shining globe of mutual satisfaction.
<P>
"Well," said Capes, at length, "we've to go down, Ann Veronica. 
Life waits for us."
<P>
He stood up and waited for her to move.
<P>
"Gods!" cried Ann Veronica, and kept him standing. "And to think
that it's not a full year ago since I was a black-hearted rebel
school-girl, distressed, puzzled, perplexed, not understanding
that this great force of love was bursting its way through me! 
All those nameless discontents--they were no more than love's
birth-pangs.  I felt--I felt living in a masked world.  I felt as
though I had bandaged eyes.  I felt--wrapped in thick cobwebs. 
They blinded me.  They got in my mouth.  And now--Dear!  Dear! 
The dayspring from on high hath visited me.  I love.  I am loved. 
I want to shout!  I want to sing!  I am glad!  I am glad to be
alive because you are alive!  I am glad to be a woman because you
are a man!  I am glad!  I am glad!  I am glad!  I thank God for
life and you.  I thank God for His sunlight on your face.  I
thank God for the beauty you love and the faults you love.  I
thank God for the very skin that is peeling from your nose, for
all things great and small that make us what we are.  This is
grace I am saying!  Oh! my dear! all the joy and weeping of life
are mixed in me now and all the gratitude.  Never a new-born
dragon-fly that spread its wings in the morning has felt as glad
as I!"
