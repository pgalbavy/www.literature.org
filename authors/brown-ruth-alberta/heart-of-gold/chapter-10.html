<p>"Marie, if that is anyone to see Grandma, show them in here,
and tell 'em she will be back in a few minutes. Well, that's what
she said to do when she went out." For Marie had paused uncertainly
on her way to answer the doorbell, and eyed Peace skeptically.</p>

<p>"O, very well," retorted the maid crossly. "But mind your manners
and be a lady."</p>

<p>Before Peace could think of a suitable reply to that studied
insult, the girl had flung open the door and ushered in a very
tall, angular person, who at first sight seemed all arms and legs.
But when one caught a glimpse of his face, one straightway forgot
all other characteristics, for in rugged homeliness it would have
been hard to surpass him, and yet there was a striking kindliness
of feature, a certain gentleness of eye that instantly drew people
to him, so that instinctively they knew him to be their friend.
Up into this face sulky Peace found herself staring, as the tall
figure crossed the parlor threshold, and came to meet her with
hand outstretched in greeting.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" a rich voice rumbled. "Are you the mistress
of the house today?"</p>

<p>"You're as homely as Abraham Lincoln," she gasped, scarcely aware
that she had spoken aloud. "In fact, you look very much like his
pictures,&mdash;as much as a gray, bald-headed, whiskerless man could
look like a black-bearded one."</p>

<p>"Thanks," he laughed genially. "That is the greatest compliment
anyone could pay me. I only wish I were as noble a man."</p>

<p>"We grow to be like our highest ideas," Peace answered primly,
recalling a little lecture she had received that morning. "You
are Dr. Shumway, ain't you? Pastor of South Avenue Church?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mademoiselle; and you are one of Dr. Campbell's granddaughters?"</p>

<p>"By adoption. My name is Peace Greenfield, and my father and
real grandfather were ministers in their time. That's why I am
so much interested in preachers. Have you any children?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Five," he answered, amused at the grown-up air she had assumed.
"How many are there of you?"</p>

<p>"Six. Four older'n me and just Allee younger. The bishop said
he thought all of yours were grown up. Are they?"</p>

<p>"We&mdash;ll, none of them are very small now. Pansy is the youngest,
and she is nearly fourteen."</p>

<p>"Pansy! Of all names! I s'pose she is as big as an elephant,
ain't she?"</p>

<p>"She <em>is</em> rather large for her age," acknowledged the
surprised minister, hardly knowing how to receive these candid
remarks of his youthful hostess.</p>

<p>"All the Pansies I ever knew were," sighed Peace. "I don't see
why people will name their biggest children Pansy."</p>

<p>"But how is one to tell how fat a child will be when it grows
up?" argued the puzzled man.</p>

<p>"It's never safe to name a baby Pansy. It's sure to be a whale.
Besides, Pansy isn't a pretty name for a <em>person</em>. It is
all right for a flower, but for a real live thing&mdash;well, ministers
do have awfully queer notions about pretty names, anyway. Are
all your children girls?"</p>

<p>"No, only four. Keturah, Caroline, Penelope and Pansy."</p>

<p>"Mercy! What outrageous names! It is very plain that <em>you</em>
didn't go to the Bible for your children, but you couldn't have
done any worse if you had."</p>

<p>"Why, child, what do you mean?" gasped the thoroughly uncomfortable
pastor, mentally deciding that this was the rudest specimen of
humanity that he had ever met in his life.</p>

<p>"Well, you see after my sister Gail was born and named after
Mamma, Grandpa came to stay with us and while he lived he took
the job of naming the rest of us,&mdash;all but Allee. He died before
she came. But he hunted out words from the Bible to call us, and
they are all misfits but Hope."</p>

<p>"Hope is a very pretty name," murmured the minister, somewhat
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, and Hope is a very pretty girl, too. The name and the girl
go together all right in that case. But look at Faith and Cherry&mdash;her
real name is Charity&mdash;and me. Look at my name. There ain't a thing
peaceful about me. I seem bound to make a stir wherever I go,
no matter how hard I try to be good. It just ain't <em>in</em>
me to be quiet and keep my mouth shut. Now, if Grandpa had waited
till I grew up, he never would have called me 'Peace.' Still,
I'm glad he didn't call me 'Catarrh.' That's outlandish. I thought
that was something which ailed folks."</p>

<p>"Catarrh is," agreed Dr. Shumway, amusement supplanting the indignation
which he had felt welling up within him. "My girl's name is Keturah.
We call her Kitty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I s'pose so. The girls named Kitty are always big and homely,
too."</p>

<p>"Well, our Kitty is neither big nor homely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, doesn't she look like you?"</p>

<p>He smiled grimly. "No," he answered. "She resembles her angel
mother."</p>

<p>"Have you got an angel in your family, too?" Peace's brown eyes
were softly tender, and the busy minister suddenly loved the talkative
little sprite who was so very frank in her observations.</p>

<p>"Yes, two. The mother of my five children, and my only grandson,
Keturah's child."</p>

<p>"A baby?"</p>

<p>"Yes." His eyes sought the live embers in the great fireplace,
and he sat apparently lost in thought.</p>

<p>Peace sighed and was thoughtfully silent a moment; then as the
pause grew oppressive to her, she observed, "So Keturah's married."</p>

<p>The minister looked up startled, then smiled in amusement. "Yes,
and Caroline also, but Carrie has no children."</p>

<p>"Who keeps house for you if your wife is an angel and your biggest
children are married? Do they live with you still?"</p>

<p>"O, no. Both girls have homes of their own in other towns. My
sister Anne stays with us, and with the help of Penelope and Pansy
manages the house very well."</p>

<p>"What did you do with your boy? You haven't said a word about
him yet."</p>

<p>"Dickson? O, he doesn't live at home any more, either. He is
a doctor at Danbury Hospital in Fairview. He is getting to be
quite a remarkable surgeon and we are all proud of him, I can
tell you."</p>

<p>"How nice!" exclaimed Peace, glancing involuntarily at the slippered
feet resting on the cushioned stool of Dr. Campbell's great Morris
chair. "I wish we had a good doctor in our family. Then p'r'aps
<em>he</em> could make me walk again."</p>

<p>"Walk again!" Amazement, consternation showed in the minister's
face, and his eyes also sought the useless little feet on their
cushion. "Why, child," he whispered, all the pity and sympathy
of his great heart throbbing in his voice, "are <em>you</em> lame?"</p>

<p>It seemed incredible, and yet he recalled now that all the while
he had sat there listening to her chatter, those gay slippers
had not once moved.</p>

<p>"Yes," Peace answered simply, surprised at his question. "Didn't
you know that before?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'll have to live in chairs all my life," she explained. "They
<em>said</em> maybe after a time I could have crutches, but it's
my back that's hurt and crutches won't be much good to me, I guess.
I <em>clum</em> a roof and fell&mdash;oh, months and months ago."</p>

<p>Briefly she recounted the unlucky adventure and the sad, weary
days that had followed, while the preacher listened spell-bound,&mdash;shocked
at the sorrowful tale.</p>

<p>When she had finished, his quivering lips whispered tenderly,
"Poor little girl!" and two great tears stole down his rugged
cheeks.</p>

<p>Peace was deeply touched at this unusual display of sympathy,
and laying her thin little hand on his knee, she said softly,
"I love you." There was a pause. Then before Dr. Shumway could
think of any appropriate words in which to voice his turbulent
thoughts, the crippled girl abruptly exclaimed, "Why, do you know,
you've got eyes like my cat!"</p>

<p>The reverend gentleman fairly bounced from his chair in his astonishment.
"Eyes like your c&mdash;cat!" he stuttered.</p>

<p>"Yes," Peace calmly answered. "One brown and one blue. I've been
watching you ever since you came in, trying to make out why you
looked so queer, and now I know,&mdash;it's your eyes. Does it feel
any different having two colors instead of one?"</p>

<p>"<em>N&mdash;</em>o," he managed to reply, still staring with fascinated
eyes at the child in the chair opposite.</p>

<p>"Well, I should think it would," she began, but at that moment
there was a brisk step on the wide veranda, the front door opened
and Mrs. Campbell entered.</p>

<p>Dr. Shumway rose to meet her, and Peace's interview with the
new pastor of South Avenue Church was at an end.</p>

<p>But the face of the small cripple haunted the minister, her pathetic
story lingered in his mind, and he found himself constantly thinking
of the long, weary years of helpless waiting stretching out before
her.</p>

<p>"O, it can't be," he protested over and over again. "She was
never meant for a life like that! Activity is written all over
her. She is right when she says she can't keep quiet. What wonderful
good such energy could accomplish if trained in the right direction!
I wonder if Dickson &mdash;I believe I will write him. No, it
would be better for him to see her first without having heard
anything about the case. How can we bring it to pass?"</p>

<p>Straightway he began to plan how he might carry out a certain
scheme which was gradually taking shape in his brain, until at
length a practicable idea at last presented itself and he broached
the subject to the other members of his household.</p>

<p>They were seated at the dinner table one night when he casually
observed to his two youngest daughters, "Girls, what do you think
of a Christmas party at the parsonage this year? Can we manage
one?"</p>

<p>"A Christmas party!" gasped both girls in dismay.</p>

<p>Even his sister Anne stared at him aghast.</p>

<p>"Well, why not?" he inquired, when no one ventured an explanation
of the family's evident consternation.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to entertain," wailed Pansy. "I'm too clumsy."</p>

<p>"We are hardly settled here," ventured sister Anne deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"Keturah is coming home for Christmas," whispered Penelope.</p>

<p>"So are Dick and Carrie," said the preacher briskly. "We all
will be together once again and I want my whole family to meet
the young folks of my new flock. What if we aren't in apple-pie
order? We'll be less so by the time the party is over, I'll wager.
As for Kitty, &mdash;I think we better plan for our Christmas
party."</p>

<p>"That settles it," whispered Pansy to the youngest sister, as
her father began to discuss some household problem with his sister.
"But I'll bet he's got some pet scheme up his sleeve. His party
isn't just to introduce us,&mdash;you see."</p>

<p>Penelope was shrewd in her observations and knew her father like
a book, but she did not guess his secret, nor was she particularly
curious this time. She did not want a Christmas party at the parsonage.
It meant so much work and clutter. Besides, it was so much nicer
to have just a little family gathering, such as they were accustomed
to each year. There would be Kitty and Ed, Carrie and Phil, and
Dick. &mdash;Dickson was still unmarried. &mdash;That would make
five extra in the little family, and five people were a plenty
to plan for, without having a party. But then, what was the use
of objecting? Her father had said party, and a party there would
be. The only thing to do was to make the best of it and plan the
most unique program the brains of the whole household could devise.
So Aunt Anne, Penelope and Pansy set to work.</p>

<p>True to his convictions, Dr. Shumway wrote nothing of his plans
to his son, nor did he once mention his hopes to the distracted
Campbell family, although he had skilfully managed that his son's
professional reputation should reach the ears of them all. To
be doubly sure that his pet scheme should not fail, he gave Peace
a personal invitation to attend his Christmas party, and made
several visits to the Campbell home apparently to discuss his
plans with members of that household, while in reality his object
was to rouse the invalid's curiosity and interest so she would
be sure to join the merrymakers at the parsonage on that night
of nights. Then Dickson could not fail to meet her and their acquaintance
would come about naturally. He could not feel that Dr. Coates
and the specialists had really found the seat of the trouble yet,
but Dickson would know if there was any hope for the little sufferer.
Dickson,&mdash;stalwart, genial, gentle Dickson,&mdash;his boy,&mdash;his boy
would know.</p>

<p>So it was with great eagerness that he looked forward to the
Christmas party, for Peace had solemnly promised to be there in
her wheel-chair, and it was hard to refrain from telling the whole
story to his boy before the time was ripe.</p>

<p>But when at last the night arrived, Peace was not among the guests
who thronged the gayly decorated parsonage. The old-time pain
had come back, and she lay white and spent upon her bed in the
Flag Room, watching with anguish in her heart while the other
sisters made ready for the festivities. They had demurred at leaving
her. It seemed so selfish to go and enjoy themselves when she
must stay behind and suffer, but she had insisted.</p>

<p>"Because I can't go to the <em>pastorage</em> myself isn't any
reason why you should stick at home, too," she told them. "Besides,
I want to know all about it, and it takes the whole family to
see <em>everything</em>."</p>

<p>"What in the world do you mean?" they chorused.</p>

<p>And she explained, "Well, Gail remembers the speeches and what
folks say just to each other. Faith hears only the music. Hope
sees the pretty things folks wear. Cherry tells what they had
to eat, and Allee fills up the chinks."</p>

<p>They laughed merrily at the small invalid's powers of discernment,
and were finally persuaded to attend the party which was barred
to her. So they donned their daintiest dresses, robbed the greenhouse
for their adornment, kissed the little sister fondly and hurried
away into the night. Peace listened to the sound of their footsteps
crunching through the hard-packed snow, until the last echo died
away. Then turning her face to the wall, she gave way to a flood
of bitter tears.</p>

<p>"Why, darling," cried the watchful Mrs. Campbell, kneeling beside
the sobbing child and striving to soothe and comfort her, "what
is the matter? Did you want to go so badly?"</p>

<p>"No, no, it ain't that," poor Peace hiccoughed, burying her head
on the grandmotherly shoulder. "But I thought I was 'most well,
and now the hurt has begun again. I ain't crying 'cause the girls
have gone, truly. It's just that dreadful ache in my back. O,
Grandma, am I going to be like my Lilac Lady after all? She had
well days when she could read and sew; and then there were times
when the pain was so bad that she couldn't bear to see folks at
all. I don't want to die, but oh, Grandma, how can I stand that
awful ache?"</p>

<p>"O God," prayed the woman's heart, torn with agony at the sight
of her darling's suffering, "help us to make it easier for her."</p>

<p>And as if in answer to her petition, there was a step on the
stair, and a big, stalwart, fur-coated figure stood unannounced
in the doorway. Mrs. Campbell rose hurriedly to her feet and confronted
the stranger. What right had he in her house? How came he there?</p>

<p>He smiled reassuringly at her look of alarm, and something in
his boyish face made Peace exclaim, "You look like Pansy Shumway,
though you're not so fat and homely."</p>

<p>At that, he laughed outright. "It's because I am her brother,
I expect," he answered simply.</p>

<p>"O, are you Dr. Dick?" she cried eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. "They told me you could not come to our party,
so I have brought the party to you,&mdash;a bit of it, at least."</p>

<p>Fishing into the depths of his great pockets, he brought forth
a marvelous array of cakes, candies, nuts and pop-corn, finally
producing what looked to be a scarlet carnation in a tiny plantpot
of rich loam, but upon investigation Peace found that her little
nosegay was merely a flower thrust into a mound of chocolate ice-cream;
and her delight made her forget her pain for a moment.</p>

<p>"You're a reg'lar Santy Claus," she giggled. "Did you come down
the chimbley? I never heard the door bell."</p>

<p>"O, I met Prexy on the steps and he told me where to find you,
so I came right up without further invitation." He did not add
that for more than an hour he had been closeted with Dr. Campbell
in the parsonage study, where the anxious President had sought
him to learn if there could be any hope for their little Peace.</p>

<p>"I s'pose the door is a safer way of getting into houses than
falling down chimbleys would be," said the girl, pleased with
her own fancies. "But it would have seemed a little realer if
you had tumbled out of the fireplace. Where is your pack, and
what have you brought for me?"</p>

<p>"What would you like best?" he parried, studying the drawn face
among the pillows.</p>

<p>"O, let me see &mdash;A new back, I guess," she sighed ruefully,
as a sharp twinge of pain recalled her to her surroundings and
caused her to writhe in agony, "and a pair of legs to match. You
are a sure-enough doctor, ain't you? Can't you mend me up again?
The other doctors' job didn't last very long."</p>

<p>"Perhaps if you will let me rub the little back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, I can't bear to have a doctor touch it!" she shuddered. "They
always make it hurt worse."</p>

<p>"I'll be very careful," he promised, "and if it hurts, I'll stop
right away."</p>

<p>Still she hesitated.</p>

<p>"'F I could just go to sleep," she sighed. "I'm so tired."</p>

<p>"You will go to sleep if you will let me rub the back a little."</p>

<p>She looked incredulous, but another stinging pain brought the
tears to her eyes, and she cried pitifully, "Yes, oh, yes,&mdash;just
rub me now. It does hurt so bad I can't help crying, and you don't
look as if you liked to poke people to pieces."</p>

<p>"It is my business to put people together again," he said gravely,
turning the pain-racked little body with deft hands, all the while
keeping up a lively chatter to amuse the small sufferer. So light
was his touch, so sympathetic his personality, that very soon
the tense muscles began to relax, the drawn lines in the childish
face gradually smoothed themselves away, and the brown eyes grew
heavy with sleep.</p>

<p>Realizing that the Santa Claus stranger had kept his promise,
Peace murmured drowsily, as she felt herself drifting away to
slumberland, "You are a good doctor, Dr. Dick. I'll hire you the
next time I fall off a roof. I b'lieve you could have mended me
up if you'd had first chance."</p>

<p>"Please God, it may not be too late now," he muttered under his
breath, and stole softly from the room to report his convictions
to Dr. Campbell, who was waiting in the hall below.</p>
