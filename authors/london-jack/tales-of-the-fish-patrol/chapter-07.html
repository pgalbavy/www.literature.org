"I'm not wanting to dictate to you, lad," Charley said; "but I'm
very much against your making a last raid.  You've gone safely
through rough times with rough men, and it would be a shame to have
something happen to you at the very end."
<P>
"But how can I get out of making a last raid?" I demanded, with the
cocksureness of youth.  "There always has to be a last, you know,
to anything."
<P>
Charley crossed his legs, leaned back, and considered the problem.
"Very true.  But why not call the capture of Demetrios Contos the
last?  You're back from it safe and sound and hearty, for all your
good wetting, and - and - "  His voice broke and he could not speak
for a moment.  "And I could never forgive myself if anything
happened to you now."
<P>
I laughed at Charley's fears while I gave in to the claims of his
affection, and agreed to consider the last raid already performed.
We had been together for two years, and now I was leaving the fish
patrol in order to go back and finish my education.  I had earned
and saved money to put me through three years at the high school,
and though the beginning of the term was several months away, I
intended doing a lot of studying for the entrance examinations.
<P>
My belongings were packed snugly in a sea-chest, and I was all
ready to buy my ticket and ride down on the train to Oakland, when
Neil Partington arrived in Benicia.  The Reindeer was needed
immediately for work far down on the Lower Bay, and Neil said he
intended to run straight for Oakland.  As that was his home and as
I was to live with his family while going to school, he saw no
reason, he said, why I should not put my chest aboard and come
along.
<P>
So the chest went aboard, and in the middle of the afternoon we
hoisted the Reindeer's big mainsail and cast off.  It was
tantalizing fall weather.  The sea-breeze, which had blown steadily
all summer, was gone, and in its place were capricious winds and
murky skies which made the time of arriving anywhere extremely
problematical.  We started on the first of the ebb, and as we
slipped down the Carquinez Straits, I looked my last for some time
upon Benicia and the bight at Turner's Shipyard, where we had
besieged the Lancashire Queen, and had captured Big Alec, the King
of the Greeks.  And at the mouth of the Straits I looked with not a
little interest upon the spot where a few days before I should have
drowned but for the good that was in the nature of Demetrios
Contos.
<P>
A great wall of fog advanced across San Pablo Bay to meet us, and
in a few minutes the Reindeer was running blindly through the damp
obscurity.  Charley, who was steering, seemed to have an instinct
for that kind of work.  How he did it, he himself confessed that he
did not know; but he had a way of calculating winds, currents,
distance, time, drift, and sailing speed that was truly marvellous.
<P>
"It looks as though it were lifting," Neil Partington said, a
couple of hours after we had entered the fog.  "Where do you say we
are, Charley?"
<P>
Charley looked at his watch, "Six o'clock, and three hours more of
ebb," he remarked casually.
<P>
"But where do you say we are?" Neil insisted.
<P>
Charley pondered a moment, and then answered, "The tide has edged
us over a bit out of our course, but if the fog lifts right now, as
it is going to lift, you'll find we're not more than a thousand
miles off McNear's Landing."
<P>
"You might be a little more definite by a few miles, anyway," Neil
grumbled, showing by his tone that he disagreed.
<P>
"All right, then," Charley said, conclusively, "not less than a
quarter of a mile, not more than a half."
<P>
The wind freshened with a couple of little puffs, and the fog
thinned perceptibly.
<P>
"McNear's is right off there," Charley said, pointing directly into
the fog on our weather beam.
<P>
The three of us were peering intently in that direction, when the
Reindeer struck with a dull crash and came to a standstill.  We ran
forward, and found her bowsprit entangled in the tanned rigging of
a short, chunky mast.  She had collided, head on, with a Chinese
junk lying at anchor.
<P>
At the moment we arrived forward, five Chinese, like so many bees,
came swarming out of the little 'tween-decks cabin, the sleep still
in their eyes.
<P>
Leading them came a big, muscular man, conspicuous for his pock-
marked face and the yellow silk handkerchief swathed about his
head.  It was Yellow Handkerchief, the Chinaman whom we had
arrested for illegal shrimp-fishing the year before, and who, at
that time, had nearly sunk the Reindeer, as he had nearly sunk it
now by violating the rules of navigation.
<P>
"What d'ye mean, you yellow-faced heathen, lying here in a fairway
without a horn a-going?" Charley cried hotly.
<P>
"Mean?" Neil calmly answered.  "Just take a look - that's what he
means."
<P>
Our eyes followed the direction indicated by Neil's finger, and we
saw the open amidships of the junk, half filled, as we found on
closer examination, with fresh-caught shrimps.  Mingled with the
shrimps were myriads of small fish, from a quarter of an inch
upward in size.
<P>
Yellow Handkerchief had lifted the trap-net at high-water slack,
and, taking advantage of the concealment offered by the fog, had
boldly been lying by, waiting to lift the net again at low-water
slack.
<P>
"Well," Neil hummed and hawed, "in all my varied and extensive
experience as a fish patrolman, I must say this is the easiest
capture I ever made.  What'll we do with them, Charley?"
<P>
"Tow the junk into San Rafael, of course," came the answer.
Charley turned to me.  "You stand by the junk, lad, and I'll pass
you a towing line.  If the wind doesn't fail us, we'll make the
creek before the tide gets too low, sleep at San Rafael, and arrive
in Oakland to-morrow by midday."
<P>
So saying, Charley and Neil returned to the Reindeer and got under
way, the junk towing astern.  I went aft and took charge of the
prize, steering by means of an antiquated tiller and a rudder with
large, diamond-shaped holes, through which the water rushed back
and forth.
<P>
By now the last of the fog had vanished, and Charley's estimate of
our position was confirmed by the sight of McNear's Landing a short
half-mile away.  Following along the west shore, we rounded Point
Pedro in plain view of the Chinese shrimp villages, and a great to-
do was raised when they saw one of their junks towing behind the
familiar fish patrol sloop.
<P>
The wind, coming off the land, was rather puffy and uncertain, and
it would have been more to our advantage had it been stronger.  San
Rafael Creek, up which we had to go to reach the town and turn over
our prisoners to the authorities, ran through wide-stretching
marshes, and was difficult to navigate on a falling tide, while at
low tide it was impossible to navigate at all.  So, with the tide
already half-ebbed, it was necessary for us to make time.  This the
heavy junk prevented, lumbering along behind and holding the
Reindeer back by just so much dead weight.
<P>
"Tell those coolies to get up that sail," Charley finally called to
me.  "We don't want to hang up on the mud flats for the rest of the
night."
<P>
I repeated the order to Yellow Handkerchief, who mumbled it huskily
to his men.  He was suffering from a bad cold, which doubled him up
in convulsive coughing spells and made his eyes heavy and
bloodshot.  This made him more evil-looking than ever, and when he
glared viciously at me I remembered with a shiver the close shave I
had had with him at the time of his previous arrest.
<P>
His crew sullenly tailed on to the halyards, and the strange,
outlandish sail, lateen in rig and dyed a warm brown, rose in the
air.  We were sailing on the wind, and when Yellow Handkerchief
flattened down the sheet the junk forged ahead and the tow-line
went slack.  Fast as the Reindeer could sail, the junk outsailed
her; and to avoid running her down I hauled a little closer on the
wind.  But the junk likewise outpointed, and in a couple of minutes
I was abreast of the Reindeer and to windward.  The tow-line had
now tautened, at right angles to the two boats, and the predicament
was laughable.
<P>
"Cast off!" I shouted.
<P>
Charley hesitated.
<P>
"It's all right," I added.  "Nothing can happen.  We'll make the
creek on this tack, and you'll be right behind me all the way up to
San Rafael."
<P>
At this Charley cast off, and Yellow Handkerchief sent one of his
men forward to haul in the line.  In the gathering darkness I could
just make out the mouth of San Rafael Creek, and by the time we
entered it I could barely see its banks.  The Reindeer was fully
five minutes astern, and we continued to leave her astern as we
beat up the narrow, winding channel.  With Charley behind us, it
seemed I had little to fear from my five prisoners; but the
darkness prevented my keeping a sharp eye on them, so I transferred
my revolver from my trousers pocket to the side pocket of my coat,
where I could more quickly put my hand on it.
<P>
Yellow Handkerchief was the one I feared, and that he knew it and
made use of it, subsequent events will show.  He was sitting a few
feet away from me, on what then happened to be the weather side of
the junk.  I could scarcely see the outlines of his form, but I
soon became convinced that he was slowly, very slowly, edging
closer to me.  I watched him carefully.  Steering with my left
hand, I slipped my right into my pocket and got hold of the
revolver.
<P>
I saw him shift along for a couple of inches, and I was just about
to order him back - the words were trembling on the tip of my
tongue - when I was struck with great force by a heavy figure that
had leaped through the air upon me from the lee side.  It was one
of the crew.  He pinioned my right arm so that I could not withdraw
my hand from my pocket, and at the same time clapped his other hand
over my mouth.  Of course, I could have struggled away from him and
freed my hand or gotten my mouth clear so that I might cry an
alarm, but in a trice Yellow Handkerchief was on top of me.
<P>
I struggled around to no purpose in the bottom of the junk, while
my legs and arms were tied and my mouth securely bound in what I
afterward found to be a cotton shirt.  Then I was left lying in the
bottom.  Yellow Handkerchief took the tiller, issuing his orders in
whispers; and from our position at the time, and from the
alteration of the sail, which I could dimly make out above me as a
blot against the stars, I knew the junk was being headed into the
mouth of a small slough which emptied at that point into San Rafael
Creek.
<P>
In a couple of minutes we ran softly alongside the bank, and the
sail was silently lowered.  The Chinese kept very quiet.  Yellow
Handkerchief sat down in the bottom alongside of me, and I could
feel him straining to repress his raspy, hacking cough.  Possibly
seven or eight minutes later I heard Charley's voice as the
Reindeer went past the mouth of the slough.
<P>
"I can't tell you how relieved I am," I could plainly hear him
saying to Neil, "that the lad has finished with the fish patrol
without accident."
<P>
Here Neil said something which I could not catch, and then
Charley's voice went on:
<P>
"The youngster takes naturally to the water, and if, when he
finishes high school, he takes a course in navigation and goes deep
sea, I see no reason why he shouldn't rise to be master of the
finest and biggest ship afloat."
<P>
It was all very flattering to me, but lying there, bound and gagged
by my own prisoners, with the voices growing faint and fainter as
the Reindeer slipped on through the darkness toward San Rafael, I
must say I was not in quite the proper situation to enjoy my
smiling future.  With the Reindeer went my last hope.  What was to
happen next I could not imagine, for the Chinese were a different
race from mine, and from what I knew I was confident that fair play
was no part of their make-up.
<P>
After waiting a few minutes longer, the crew hoisted the lateen
sail, and Yellow Handkerchief steered down toward the mouth of San
Rafael Creek.  The tide was getting lower, and he had difficulty in
escaping the mud-banks.  I was hoping he would run aground, but he
succeeded in making the Bay without accident.
<P>
As we passed out of the creek a noisy discussion arose, which I
knew related to me.  Yellow Handkerchief was vehement, but the
other four as vehemently opposed him.  It was very evident that he
advocated doing away with me and that they were afraid of the
consequences.  I was familiar enough with the Chinese character to
know that fear alone restrained them.  But what plan they offered
in place of Yellow Handkerchief's murderous one, I could not make
out.
<P>
My feelings, as my fate hung in the balance, may be guessed.  The
discussion developed into a quarrel, in the midst of which Yellow
Handkerchief unshipped the heavy tiller and sprang toward me.  But
his four companions threw themselves between, and a clumsy struggle
took place for possession of the tiller.  In the end Yellow
Handkerchief was overcome, and sullenly returned to the steering,
while they soundly berated him for his rashness.
<P>
Not long after, the sail was run down and the junk slowly urged
forward by means of the sweeps.  I felt it ground gently on the
soft mud.  Three of the Chinese - they all wore long sea-boots -
got over the side, and the other two passed me across the rail.
With Yellow Handkerchief at my legs and his two companions at my
shoulders, they began to flounder along through the mud.  After
some time their feet struck firmer footing, and I knew they were
carrying me up some beach.  The location of this beach was not
doubtful in my mind.  It could be none other than one of the Marin
Islands, a group of rocky islets which lay off the Marin County
shore.
<P>
When they reached the firm sand that marked high tide, I was
dropped, and none too gently.  Yellow Handkerchief kicked me
spitefully in the ribs, and then the trio floundered back through
the mud to the junk.  A moment later I heard the sail go up and
slat in the wind as they drew in the sheet.  Then silence fell, and
I was left to my own devices for getting free.
<P>
I remembered having seen tricksters writhe and squirm out of ropes
with which they were bound, but though I writhed and squirmed like
a good fellow, the knots remained as hard as ever, and there was no
appreciable slack.  In the course of my squirming, however, I
rolled over upon a heap of clam-shells - the remains, evidently, of
some yachting party's clam-bake.  This gave me an idea.  My hands
were tied behind my back; and, clutching a shell in them, I rolled
over and over, up the beach, till I came to the rocks I knew to be
there.
<P>
Rolling around and searching, I finally discovered a narrow
crevice, into which I shoved the shell.  The edge of it was sharp,
and across the sharp edge I proceeded to saw the rope that bound my
wrists.  The edge of the shell was also brittle, and I broke it by
bearing too heavily upon it.  Then I rolled back to the heap and
returned with as many shells as I could carry in both hands.  I
broke many shells, cut my hands a number of times, and got cramps
in my legs from my strained position and my exertions.
<P>
While I was suffering from the cramps, and resting, I heard a
familiar halloo drift across the water.  It was Charley, searching
for me.  The gag in my mouth prevented me from replying, and I
could only lie there, helplessly fuming, while he rowed past the
island and his voice slowly lost itself in the distance.
<P>
I returned to the sawing process, and at the end of half an hour
succeeded in severing the rope.  The rest was easy.  My hands once
free, it was a matter of minutes to loosen my legs and to take the
gag out of my mouth.  I ran around the island to make sure it was
an island and not by any chance a portion of the mainland.  An
island it certainly was, one of the Marin group, fringed with a
sandy beach and surrounded by a sea of mud.  Nothing remained but
to wait till daylight and to keep warm; for it was a cold, raw
night for California, with just enough wind to pierce the skin and
cause one to shiver.
<P>
To keep up the circulation, I ran around the island a dozen times
or so, and clambered across its rocky backbone as many times more -
all of which was of greater service to me, as I afterward
discovered, than merely to warm me up.  In the midst of this
exercise I wondered if I had lost anything out of my pockets while
rolling over and over in the sand.  A search showed the absence of
my revolver and pocket-knife.  The first Yellow Handkerchief had
taken; but the knife had been lost in the sand.
<P>
I was hunting for it when the sound of rowlocks came to my ears.
At first, of course, I thought of Charley; but on second thought I
knew Charley would be calling out as he rowed along.  A sudden
premonition of danger seized me.  The Marin Islands are lonely
places; chance visitors in the dead of night are hardly to be
expected.  What if it were Yellow Handkerchief?  The sound made by
the rowlocks grew more distinct.  I crouched in the sand and
listened intently.  The boat, which I judged a small skiff from the
quick stroke of the oars, was landing in the mud about fifty yards
up the beach.  I heard a raspy, hacking cough, and my heart stood
still.  It was Yellow Handkerchief.  Not to be robbed of his
revenge by his more cautious companions, he had stolen away from
the village and come back alone.
<P>
I did some swift thinking.  I was unarmed and helpless on a tiny
islet, and a yellow barbarian, whom I had reason to fear, was
coming after me.  Any place was safer than the island, and I turned
instinctively to the water, or rather to the mud.  As he began to
flounder ashore through the mud, I started to flounder out into it,
going over the same course which the Chinese had taken in landing
me and in returning to the junk.
<P>
Yellow Handkerchief, believing me to be lying tightly bound,
exercised no care, but came ashore noisily.  This helped me, for,
under the shield of his noise and making no more myself than
necessary, I managed to cover fifty feet by the time he had made
the beach.  Here I lay down in the mud.  It was cold and clammy,
and made me shiver, but I did not care to stand up and run the risk
of being discovered by his sharp eyes.
<P>
He walked down the beach straight to where he had left me lying,
and I had a fleeting feeling of regret at not being able to see his
surprise when he did not find me.  But it was a very fleeting
regret, for my teeth were chattering with the cold.
<P>
What his movements were after that I had largely to deduce from the
facts of the situation, for I could scarcely see him in the dim
starlight.  But I was sure that the first thing he did was to make
the circuit of the beach to learn if landings had been made by
other boats.  This he would have known at once by the tracks
through the mud.
<P>
Convinced that no boat had removed me from the island, he next
started to find out what had become of me.  Beginning at the pile
of clamshells, he lighted matches to trace my tracks in the sand.
At such times I could see his villanous face plainly, and, when the
sulphur from the matches irritated his lungs, between the raspy
cough that followed and the clammy mud in which I was lying, I
confess I shivered harder than ever.
<P>
The multiplicity of my footprints puzzled him.  Then the idea that
I might be out in the mud must have struck him, for he waded out a
few yards in my direction, and, stooping, with his eyes searched
the dim surface long and carefully.  He could not have been more
than fifteen feet from me, and had he lighted a match he would
surely have discovered me.
<P>
He returned to the beach and clambered about, over the rocky
backbone, again hunting for me with lighted matches, The closeness
of the shave impelled me to further flight.  Not daring to wade
upright, on account of the noise made by floundering and by the
suck of the mud, I remained lying down in the mud and propelled
myself over its surface by means of my hands.  Still keeping the
trail made by the Chinese in going from and to the junk, I held on
until I reached the water.  Into this I waded to a depth of three
feet, and then I turned off to the side on a line parallel with the
beach.
<P>
The thought came to me of going toward Yellow Handkerchief's skiff
and escaping in it, but at that very moment he returned to the
beach, and, as though fearing the very thing I had in mind, he
slushed out through the mud to assure himself that the skiff was
safe.  This turned me in the opposite direction.  Half swimming,
half wading, with my head just out of water and avoiding splashing,
I succeeded in putting about a hundred feet between myself and the
spot where the Chinese had begun to wade ashore from the junk.  I
drew myself out on the mud and remained lying flat.
<P>
Again Yellow Handkerchief returned to the beach and made a search
of the island, and again he returned to the heap of clam-shells.  I
knew what was running in his mind as well as he did himself.  No
one could leave or land without making tracks in the mud.  The only
tracks to be seen were those leading from his skiff and from where
the junk had been.  I was not on the island.  I must have left it
by one or the other of those two tracks.  He had just been over the
one to his skiff, and was certain I had not left that way.
Therefore I could have left the island only by going over the
tracks of the junk landing.  This he proceeded to verify by wading
out over them himself, lighting matches as he came along.
<P>
When he arrived at the point where I had first lain, I knew, by the
matches he burned and the time he took, that he had discovered the
marks left by my body.  These he followed straight to the water and
into it, but in three feet of water he could no longer see them.
On the other hand, as the tide was still falling, he could easily
make out the impression made by the junk's bow, and could have
likewise made out the impression of any other boat if it had landed
at that particular spot.  But there was no such mark; and I knew
that he was absolutely convinced that I was hiding somewhere in the
mud.
<P>
But to hunt on a dark night for a boy in a sea of mud would be like
hunting for a needle in a haystack, and he did not attempt it.
Instead he went back to the beach and prowled around for some time.
I was hoping he would give me up and go, for by this time I was
suffering severely from the cold.  At last he waded out to his
skiff and rowed away.  What if this departure of Yellow
Handkerchief's were a sham?  What if he had done it merely to
entice me ashore?
<P>
The more I thought of it the more certain I became that he had made
a little too much noise with his oars as he rowed away.  So I
remained, lying in the mud and shivering.  I shivered till the
muscles of the small of my back ached and pained me as badly as the
cold, and I had need of all my self-control to force myself to
remain in my miserable situation.
<P>
It was well that I did, however, for, possibly an hour later, I
thought I could make out something moving on the beach.  I watched
intently, but my ears were rewarded first, by a raspy cough I knew
only too well.  Yellow Handkerchief had sneaked back, landed on the
other side of the island, and crept around to surprise me if I had
returned.
<P>
After that, though hours passed without sign of him, I was afraid
to return to the island at all.  On the other hand, I was almost
equally afraid that I should die of the exposure I was undergoing.
I had never dreamed one could suffer so.  I grew so cold and numb,
finally, that I ceased to shiver.  But my muscles and bones began
to ache in a way that was agony.  The tide had long since begun to
rise, and, foot by foot, it drove me in toward the beach.  High
water came at three o'clock, and at three o'clock I drew myself up
on the beach, more dead than alive, and too helpless to have
offered any resistance had Yellow Handkerchief swooped down upon
me.
<P>
But no Yellow Handkerchief appeared.  He had given me up and gone
back to Point Pedro.  Nevertheless, I was in a deplorable, not to
say dangerous, condition.  I could not stand upon my feet, much
less walk.  My clammy, muddy garments clung to me like sheets of
ice.  I thought I should never get them off.  So numb and lifeless
were my fingers, and so weak was I, that it seemed to take an hour
to get off my shoes.  I had not the strength to break the porpoise-
hide laces, and the knots defied me.  I repeatedly beat my hands
upon the rocks to get some sort of life into them.  Sometimes I
felt sure I was going to die.
<P>
But in the end, - after several centuries, it seemed to me, - I got
off the last of my clothes.  The water was now close at hand, and I
crawled painfully into it and washed the mud from my naked body.
Still, I could not get on my feet and walk and I was afraid to lie
still.  Nothing remained but to crawl weakly, like a snail, and at
the cost of constant pain, up and down the sand.  I kept this up as
long as possible, but as the east paled with the coming of dawn I
began to succumb.  The sky grew rosy-red, and the golden rim of the
sun, showing above the horizon, found me lying helpless and
motionless among the clam-shells.
<P>
As in a dream, I saw the familiar mainsail of the Reindeer as she
slipped out of San Rafael Creek on a light puff of morning air.
This dream was very much broken.  There are intervals I can never
recollect on looking back over it.  Three things, however, I
distinctly remember:  the first sight of the Reindeer's mainsail;
her lying at anchor a few hundred feet away and a small boat
leaving her side; and the cabin stove roaring red-hot, myself
swathed all over with blankets, except on the chest and shoulders,
which Charley was pounding and mauling unmercifully, and my mouth
and throat burning with the coffee which Neil Partington was
pouring down a trifle too hot.
<P>
But burn or no burn, I tell you it felt good.  By the time we
arrived in Oakland I was as limber and strong as ever, - though
Charlie and Neil Partington were afraid I was going to have
pneumonia, and Mrs. Partington, for my first six months of school,
kept an anxious eye upon me to discover the first symptoms of
consumption.
<P>
Time flies.  It seems but yesterday that I was a lad of sixteen on
the fish patrol.  Yet I know that I arrived this very morning from
China, with a quick passage to my credit, and master of the
barkentine Harvester.  And I know that to-morrow morning I shall
run over to Oakland to see Neil Partington and his wife and family,
and later on up to Benicia to see Charley Le Grant and talk over
old times.  No; I shall not go to Benicia, now that I think about
it.  I expect to be a highly interested party to a wedding, shortly
to take place.  Her name is Alice Partington, and, since Charley
has promised to be best man, he will have to come down to Oakland
instead.
