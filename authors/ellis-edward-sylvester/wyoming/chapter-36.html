<p>Fred Godfrey, as may well be supposed, was amazed at the words
of Habakkuk McEwen, but he believed the fellow was simply descending
to this subterfuge in the hope of saving his life.</p>

<p>Understanding the nature of the man as well as he did, he could
not find fault, and he made an effort to help him, without telling
a clear untruth.</p>

<p>"I can say that before and after I joined my friends, he behaved
very differently from the others."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"He was asked to do several things for their benefit and refused,
and he favored this attempt to get away by leaving the place where
we had taken shelter in the rocks."</p>

<p>"That's because he was too cowardly to do anything else," broke
in Mr. Brainerd.</p>

<p>"Did lie fire either of those shots that brought down a couple
of our men?"</p>

<p>"I believe not-did he, Mr. Brainerd?"</p>

<p>"No; he can't shoot well enough to hit a flock of barns ten feet
off, and he shivered so with fear he couldn't hold his gun in
hand."</p>

<p>"That's a lie!" exclaimed Habakkuk, who began to feel hopeful;
"I had a dozen chances to pick off some of the red men and I wouldn't
do it, 'cause I was their friend."</p>

<p>"Wal, I'll 'tend to you after awhile," said Golcher, puzzled
by the turn matters had taken. "You folks may sit down on the
log a while, and I'll 'tend to another matter."</p>

<p>During this curious conversation the Senecas were grouped on
the other side of the camp-fire, so that the faces of captors
as well as captured were shown in the glare of the blaze, upon
which more wood was flung.</p>

<p>Fred Godfrey regretted this, having resolved to make a break
whenever the chance presented itself, for there was no mercy to
be expected for him. The Senecas were impatient, and he was well
aware that Jake Golcher hated him with a hatred that would stop
at nothing in the way of suffering.</p>

<p>If convinced that the death of a soldier would be his, he would
have stayed and died, like the brave youth he was.</p>

<p>But once away and he might do something for those who were dearer
to him than his own life.</p>

<p>While he stood listening to the conversation recorded, he sought
to finish that which he had tried to accomplish all the way thither&mdash;that
was, to loosen the bonds that held his elbows and wrists as if
they were bound with iron.</p>

<p>He could not make any progress, and he began to feel as though
he had deferred the step too long. He thought to have overturned
his immediate guards, and dashed in the woods, before reaching
the camp of the Senecas.</p>

<p>This was destined to be an eventful night to all concerned. The
Tory had taken a step toward Maggie Brainerd, with the manifest
intention of addressing her, when a new-comer appeared on the
scene, in the person of an Indian runner from the other side of
the river.</p>

<p>It was evident he came from high authorities, with orders. From
what followed, it is probable that the leaders of the Indians
and Tories felt there was need of additional forces on the western
bank, to complete the work of which much still remained to do.</p>

<p>Forty Fort, which contained many of the settlers, and women and
children, had not yet surrendered, and the massacre could not
be completed so long as a remnant of the patriots held out.</p>

<p>That such was the errand of the runner appeared from the fact
that he addressed himself directly to Gray Panther, who the next
moment summoned Golcher to his side, and the three held a brief
conversation.</p>

<p>The captives naturally fixed their attention on them and noticed
that they gesticulated, and the Tory indulged in a number of expressions
in English that were of a vigorous nature.</p>

<p>Some of the Senecas sauntered over in front of the sorrowful
group, and looked at them with natural curiosity. Habakkuk McEwen,
on account of his fantastic dress and paint, still attracted the
most notice, and some of the warriors ventured on a remark or
two in their own tongue, but he made no answer, and did his utmost
to maintain a dignified bearing.</p>

<p>"Habakkuk," said Fred Godfrey, in a low voice, "what did you
mean by telling that wretch such a story?"</p>

<p>"Sh! keep quiet," replied McEwen, in an undertone, and without
looking toward the one he was addressing; "you know it's my only
chance."</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, when both Fred and his father
were disposed to suspect the fellow of treachery, but second thought
convinced them that he meant well enough, and was only making
a natural effort to gain the favor of the man who held his life
in his hands.</p>

<p>It was in accordance with the natural instinct of the fellow,
who was more than willing to resort to any artifice that promised
to avert the doom hanging over his head.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say that he was the only one who
would ask mercy at the hands of Jake Golcher, or who would pretend
any sentiment other than an utter abhorrence of him.</p>
