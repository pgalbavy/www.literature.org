<P>
Never did Prince Maiyo show fewer signs of his Japanese origin
than when in the company of other men of his own race. Side by
side with His Excellency the Baron Hesho, the contrasts in
feature and expression were so marked as to make it hard, indeed,
to believe that these two men could belong to the same nation.
The Baron Hesho had high cheekbones, a yellow skin, close-cropped
black hair, and wore gold-rimmed spectacles through which he
beamed upon the whole world. The Prince, as he lounged in his
wicker chair and watched the blue smoke of his cigarette curl
upwards, looked more like an Italian--perhaps a Spaniard. The
shape of his head was perfectly Western, perfectly and typically
Romanesque. The carriage of his body must have been inherited
from his mother, of whom it was said that no more graceful woman
ever walked. Yet between these two men, so different in all
externals, there was the strongest sympathy, although they met
but seldom.
<P>
"So we are to lose you soon, Prince," the Baron was saying.
<P>
"Very soon indeed," Prince Maiyo answered. "Next week I go down
to Devenham. I understand that the Prime Minister and Sir Edward
Bransome will be there. If so, that, I think, will be practically
my leave-taking. There is no object in my staying any longer over
here."
<P>
The Baron blinked his eyes meditatively.
<P>
"I have seen very little of you, Maiyo," he said, "since your
last visit to the Continent. I take it that your views are
unchanged?"
<P>
The Prince assented.
<P>
"Unchanged indeed," he answered,--"unchangeable, I think almost
that I might now say. They have been wonderful months, these last
months, Baron," he continued. "I have seen some of those things
which we in Japan have heard about and wondered about all our
lives. I have seen the German army at manoeuvres. I have talked
to their officers. Where I could, I have talked to the men. I
have been to some of their great socialist meetings. I have heard
them talk about their country and their Emperor, and what would
happen to their officers if war should come. I have seen the
French artillery. I have been the guest of the President. I have
tried to understand the peculiar attitude which that country has
always adopted toward us. I have been, unrecognized, in St.
Petersburg. I have tried to understand a little the resources of
that marvellous country. I came back here in time for the great
review in the Solent. I have seen the most magnificent ships and
the most splendid naval discipline the world has ever known. Then
I have explored the interior of this island as few of our race
have explored it before, not for the purpose of studying the
manufactures, the trades, the immense shipbuilding
industries,--simply to study the people themselves."
<P>
The Baron nodded gravely.
<P>
"I ask no questions," he said. "It is the Emperor's desire, I
know, that you go straight to him. I take it that your mind is
made up,--you have arrived at definite conclusions?"
<P>
"Absolutely" Prince Maiyo answered. "I shall make no great secret
of them. You already, my dear Baron, know, I think, whither they
lead. I shall be unpopular for a time, I suppose, and your own
position may be made a little difficult. After that, things will
go on pretty much the same. Of one thing, though, I am assured. I
see it as clearly as the shepherd who has lain the night upon the
hillside sees the coming day. It may be twelve months, it may be
two years, it may even be three, but before that time has passed
the clouds will have gathered, the storm will have burst. Then, I
think, Hesho, our master will be glad that we are free."
<P>
The Baron agreed.
<P>
"Only a few nights ago," he said, "Captain Koki and the other
attaches spent an evening with me. We have charts and pieces, and
with locked doors we played a war game of our own invention. It
should all be over in three weeks."
<P>
Prince Maiyo laughed softly.
<P>
"You are right," he said. "I have gone over the ground myself. It
could be done in even less time. You should ask a few of our
friends to that war game, Baron. How they would smile! You read
the newspapers of the country?"
<P>
"Invariably," the Ambassador answered.
<P>
"There is an undercurrent of feeling somewhere," the Prince
continued,--"one of the cheaper organs is shrieking all the time
a brazen warning. Patriotism, as you and I understand it, dear
friend, is long since dead, but if one strikes hard enough at the
flint, some fire may come. Hesho, how short our life is! How
little we can understand! We have only the written words of those
who have gone before, to show us the cities and the empires that
have been, to teach us the reasons why they decayed and crumbled
away. We have only our own imagination to help us to look forward
into the future and see the empires that may rise, the kingdoms
that shall stand, the kingdoms that shall fall. Amongst them all,
Hesho, there is but this much of truth. It is our own dear
country and our one great rival across the Pacific who, in the
years to come, must fight for the supremacy of the world."
<P>
"It will be no fight, that," the Ambassador answered slowly,--"no
fight unless a new prophet is born to them. The money-poison is
sucking the very blood from their body. The country is slowly but
surely becoming honey-combed with corruption. The voices of its
children are like the voices from the tower of Babel. If their
strong man should arise, then the fight will be the fiercest the
world has ever known. Even then the end is not doubtful. The
victor will be ours. When the universe is left for them and for
us, it will be our sons who shall rule. Listen, Maiyo."
<P>
"I listen," the Prince answered.
<P>
The Baron Hesho had laid aside his spectacles. He leaned a little
towards his companion. His voice had fallen to a whisper, his
hand fell almost caressingly upon his friend's shoulder.
<P>
"I would speak of something else," he continued. "Soon you go to
the Duke's house. You will meet there the people who are in
authority over this country. When you leave it, everything is
finished. Tell me, is the way homeward safe for you?"
<P>
"Wonderful person!" Prince Maiyo said, smiling.
<P>
"No, I am not wonderful," the Ambassador declared. "All the time
I have had my fears. Why not? A month ago I sought your aid. I
knew from our friends in New York that a man was on his way to
England with letters which made clear, beyond a doubt, the
purpose of this world journey of the American fleet. I sent for
you. We both agreed that it was an absolute necessity for us to
know the contents of those letters."
<P>
"We discovered them," the Prince answered. "It was well that we
did."
<P>
"You discovered them," the Ambassador interrupted. "I have taken
no credit for it. The credit is yours. But in this land there are
so many things which one may not do. The bowstring and the knife
are unrecognized. Civilization has set an unwholesome value upon
human life. It is the maudlin sentiment which creeps like
corruption through the body of a dying country."
<P>
"I know it," the Prince declared, sighing. "I know it very well
indeed."
<P>
"Dear Maiyo," the Ambassador asked, "how well do you know it?"
<P>
"My friend," the Prince answered, "it were better for you not to
ask that question."
<P>
"Here under this roof," the Baron continued, "is sanctuary, but
in the streets and squares beyond, it seems to me--and I have
thought this over many times,--it seems to me that even the
person of the great Prince, cousin of the Emperor, holy son of
Japan, would not be safe."
<P>
Prince Maiyo shrugged his shoulders. There was gravity in his
face, but it was the gravity of a man who has learnt to look upon
serious things with a light heart.
<P>
"I, also," he said, "have weighed this matter very carefully in
my mind. What I did was well done, and if the bill is thrust into
my face, I must pay. First of all, Baron, I promise you that I
shall finish my work. After that, what does it matter? You and I
know better than this nation of life-loving shopkeepers. A week,
a year, a span of years,--of what account are they to us who have
sipped ever so lightly at the great cup? If we died tomorrow for
the glory of our country, should we not say to one another, you
and I, that it was well?"
<P>
The Baron rose to his feet and bowed. Into his voice there had
crept a note almost of reverence.
<P>
"Prince," he said, "almost you take me back to the one mother
country. Almost your words persuade me that the strangeness of
these Western lands is a passing thing. We wonder, and as we
wonder they shall crumble away. The sun rises in the East."
<P>
The Prince also rose. Servants came silently forward, bearing his
hat and gloves.
<P>
"Perhaps," the Prince smiled, as he made his adieux--
<P>
"Perhaps," the Ambassador echoed. "Who can tell?"
<P>
The Prince sent away his carriage and walked homeward, greeting
every now and then an acquaintance. He walked cheerfully and with
a smile upon his face. There was nothing in his appearance which
could possibly have indicated to the closest observer that this
was a man who had taken death by the hand. At the corner of
Regent Street and Pall Mall he overtook Inspector Jacks. He
leaned forward at once and touched the detective on the shoulder.
<P>
"Mr. Jacks," he said, "it is pleasant to see you once more. I was
afraid that I should have to leave without bidding you farewell."
<P>
The Inspector started. The Prince laughed to himself as he
watched that gesture. Indeed, a man who showed his feelings so
easily would be very much at a loss in Tokio!
<P>
"You are going away, Prince?" the Inspector asked quickly.
"When?"
<P>
"The exact day is not fixed," the Prince replied, "but it is true
that I am going home. I have finished my work, and, you see,
there is nothing to keep me over here any longer. Tell me, have
you had any fortune yet? I read the papers every day, hoping to
see that you have cleared up those two terrible affairs."
<P>
Inspector Jacks shook his head.
<P>
"Not yet, Prince," he said.
<P>
"Not yet," the Prince echoed. "Dear me, that is very
unfortunate!"
<P>
Inspector Jacks watched the people who were passing, for a
moment, with a fixed, unseeing gaze.
<P>
"I am afraid," he said, "that we must seem to you very slow and
very stupid. Very likely we are. And yet, yet in time we
generally reach our goal. Sometimes we go a long way round.
Sometimes we wait almost over long, but sooner or later we
strike."
<P>
The Prince nodded sympathetically.
<P>
"The best of fortune to you, Mr. Jacks!" he said. "I wish you
could have cleared these matters up before I left for home. It is
pure selfishness, of course, but I have always felt a great
interest in your work."
<P>
"If we do not clear them up before you leave the country,
Prince," the Inspector answered, "I fear that we shall never
clear them up at all."
<P>
The Prince passed on smiling. A conversation with Inspector Jacks
seemed always to inspire him. It was a fine afternoon and Pall
Mall was crowded. In a few moments he came face to face with
Somerfield, who greeted him a little gloomily.
<P>
"Sir Charles," the Prince said, "I hope that I shall have the
pleasure of meeting you at Devenham?"
<P>
"I am not sure," Somerfield answered. "I have been asked, but I
promised some time ago to go up to Scotland. I have a third share
in a river there, and the season for salmon is getting on."
<P>
"I am sorry," the Prince declared. "I have no doubt, however, but
that Miss Morse will induce you to change your mind. I should
regret your absence the more," he continued, "because this, I
fear, is the last visit which I shall be paying in this country."
<P>
Somerfield was genuinely interested.
<P>
"You are really going home?" he asked eagerly.
<P>
"Almost at once," the Prince answered.
<P>
"Only for a time, I suppose?" Somerfield continued.
<P>
The Prince shook his head.
<P>
"On the contrary," he said, "I imagine that this will be a long
goodbye. I think I can promise you that if ever I reach Japan I
shall remain there. My work in this hemisphere will be
accomplished."
<P>
Somerfield looked at him with the puzzled air of a man who is
face to face with a problem which he cannot solve.
<P>
"You'll forgive my putting it so plainly, Prince," he remarked,
"but do you mean to say that after having lived over here you
could possibly settle down again in Japan?"
<P>
The Prince returned for a moment his companion's perplexed gaze.
Then his lips parted, his eyes shone. He laughed softly,
gracefully, with genuine mirth.
<P>
"Sir Charles," he said, "I shall not forget that question. I
think that of all the Englishmen whom I have met you are the most
English of all. When I think of your great country, as I often
shall do, of her sons and her daughters, I will promise you that
to me you shall always represent the typical man of your race and
fortune."
<P>
The Prince left his companion loitering along Pall Mall, still a
little puzzled. He called a taxi and drove to Devenham House. The
great drawing rooms were almost empty. Lady Grace was just saying
goodbye to some parting guests. She welcomed the Prince with a
little flush of pleasure.
<P>
"I find you alone?" he remarked.
<P>
"My mother is opening a bazaar somewhere," Lady Grace said. "She
will be home very soon. Do let me give you some tea."
<P>
"It is my excuse for coming," the Prince admitted.
<P>
She called back the footman who had shown him in.
<P>
"China tea, very weak, in a china teapot with lemon and no sugar.
Isn't that it?" she asked, smiling.
<P>
"Lady Grace," he declared, "you spoil me. Perhaps it is because I
am going away. Every one is kind to the people who go away."
<P>
She looked at him anxiously.
<P>
"Going away!" she exclaimed. "When? Do you mean back to Japan?"
<P>
"Back to my own country," he answered. "Perhaps in two weeks,
perhaps three--who can tell?"
<P>
"But you are coming to Devenham first?" she asked eagerly.
<P>
"I am coming to Devenham first," he assented. "I called this
afternoon to let your father know the date on which I could come.
I promised that he should hear from me today. He was good enough
to say either Thursday or Friday. Thursday, I find, will suit me
admirably."
<P>
She drew a little sigh.
<P>
"So you are going back," she said softly. "I wonder why so many
people seem to have taken it for granted that you would settle
down here. Even I had begun to hope so."
<P>
He smiled.
<P>
"Lady Grace," he said, "I am not what you call a cosmopolitan. To
live over here in any of these Western countries would seem to
denote that one may change one's dwelling place as easily as one
changes one's clothes. The further east you go, the more
reluctant one is, I think, to leave the shadow of one's own
trees. The man who leaves my country leaves it to go into exile.
The man who returns, returns home."
<P>
She was a little perplexed.
<P>
"I should have imagined," she said, "that the people who leave
your country as emigrants to settle in American or even over here
might have felt like that. But you of the educated classes I
should have thought would have found more over here to attract
you, more to induce you to choose a new home."
<P>
He shook his head.
<P>
"Lady Grace," he said, "believe me that is not so. The traditions
of our race--the call of the blood, as you put it over here--is
as powerful a thing with our aristocratics as with our peasants.
We find much here to wonder at and admire, much that, however
unwillingly, we are forced to take back and adopt in our own
country, but it is a strange atmosphere for us, this. For my
country-people there is but one real home, but one motherland."
<P>
"Yet you have seemed so contented over here," she remarked. "You
have entered so easily into all our ways."
<P>
He set down his teacup and smiled at her for a moment gravely.
<P>
"I came with a purpose," he said. "I came in order to observe and
to study certain features of your life, but, believe me, I have
felt the strain--I have felt it sometimes very badly. These
countries, yours especially, are like what one of your great
poets called the Lotus-Lands for us. Much of your life here is
given to pursuits which we do not understand, to sports and
games, to various forms of what we should call idleness. In my
country we know little of that. In one way or another, from the
Emperor to the poor runner in the streets, we work."
<P>
"Is there nothing which you will regret?" she asked.
<P>
"I shall regret the friends I have made,--the very dear friends,"
he repeated, "who have been so very much kinder to me than I have
deserved. Life is a sad pilgrimage sometimes, because one may not
linger for a moment at any one spot, nor may one ever look back.
But I know quite well that when I leave here there will be many
whom I would gladly see again."
<P>
"There will be many, Prince," she said softly, "who will be sorry
to see you go."
<P>
The Prince rose to his feet. Another little stream of callers had
come into the room. Presently he drank his tea and departed. When
he reached St. James' Square, his majordomo came hurrying up and
whispered something in his own language.
<P>
The Prince smiled.
<P>
"I go to see him," he said. "I will go at once."
