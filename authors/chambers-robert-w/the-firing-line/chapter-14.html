<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>An hour or two later that afternoon Wayward and Constance Palliser,
Gussie Vetchen, and Livingston Cuyp gazed with variously mingled
sentiments upon the torpid saurians belonging to one Alligator
Joe in an enclosure rather remote from the hotel.</p>

<p>Vetchen bestowed largess upon the small, freckled boy attendant;
and his distinguished disapproval upon the largest lady-crocodile
which, with interlocked but grinning jaws, slumbered under a vertical
sun in monochromatic majesty.</p>

<p>"One perpetual and gigantic simper," he said, disgusted.</p>

<p>"Rather undignified for a thing as big as that to lay eggs like
a hen," observed Cuyp, not intending to be funny.</p>

<p>Wayward and Miss Palliser had wandered off together to inspect
the pumps. Vetchen, always inquisitive, had discovered a coy manatee
in one tank, and was all for poking it with his walking-stick
until he saw its preposterous countenance emerge from the water.</p>

<p>"Great heavens," he faltered, "it looks like a Dutch ancestor
of Cuyp's!"</p>

<p>Cuyp, intensely annoyed, glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"Where the mischief did Miss Suydam and Malcourt go?" he asked
Wayward. "I say, Miss Palliser, you don't want to wait here any
longer, do you?"</p>

<p>"They're somewhere in the labyrinth," said Wayward. "Their chair
went that way, didn't it, boy?"</p>

<p>"Yeth, thir," said the small and freckled attendant.</p>

<p>So the party descended the wooden incline to where their sleepy
black chairmen lay on the grass, waiting; and presently the two
double chairs wheeled away toward that amusing maze of jungle
pathways cut through the impenetrable hammock, and popularly known
as the labyrinth.</p>

<p>But Miss Suydam and Mr. Malcourt were not in the labyrinth. At
that very moment they were slowly strolling along the eastern
dunes where the vast solitude of sky and sea seemed to depress
even the single white-headed eagle standing on the wet beach,
head and tail adroop, motionless, fish-gorged. No other living
thing was in sight except the slim, blue dragon-flies, ceaselessly
darting among the beach-grapes; nothing else stirred except those
two figures on the dunes, moving slowly, heads bent as though
considering the advisability of every step in the breaking sands.
There was a fixed smile on the girl's lips, but her eyes were
mirthless, almost vacant.</p>

<p>"So you've decided to go?" she said.</p>

<p>"Portlaw decides that sort of thing for me."</p>

<p>"It's a case of necessity?"</p>

<p>Malcourt answered lightly: "He intends to go. Who can stop a
fat and determined man? Besides, the season is over; in two weeks
there will be nobody left except the indigenous nigger, the buzzards,
and a few cast-off summer garments&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And a few cast-off winter memories," she said. "You will not
take any away with you, will you?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean clothes?"</p>

<p>"Memories."</p>

<p>"I'll take some."</p>

<p>"Which?"</p>

<p>"All those concerning you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Louis." They had got that far. And a trifle farther,
for her hand, swinging next his, encountered it and their fingers
remained interlocked. But there was no change of expression in
her pretty, pale face as, head bent, shoulder to shoulder with
him, she moved thoughtfully onward along the dunes, the fixed
smile stamped on her lips.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with your memories?" she asked. "Pigeon-hole
and label them? Or fling them, like your winter repentance, in
the Fire of Spring?"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with yours, Virginia?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. They are not disturbing enough to destroy. Besides,
unlike yours, they are my first memories of indiscretions, and
they are too new to forget easily, too incredible yet to hurt.
A woman is seldom hurt by what she cannot understand."</p>

<p>He passed one arm around her supple waist; they halted; he turned
her toward him.</p>

<p>"What is it you don't understand?"</p>

<p>"This."</p>

<p>"My kissing you? Like this?"</p>

<p>She neither avoided nor returned the caress, looking at him out
of impenetrable eyes more green than blue like the deep sea under
changing skies.</p>

<p>"Is this what you don't understand, Virginia?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that&mdash;and your moderation."</p>

<p>His smile changed, but it was still a smile.</p>

<p>"Nor I," he said. "Like our friend, Warren Hastings, I am astonished.
But there our resemblance ends."</p>

<p>The eagle on the wet sands ruffled, shook his silvery hackles,
and looked around at them. Then, head low and thrust forward,
he hulked slowly toward the remains of the dead fish from which
but now he had retired in the disgust of satiation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Malcourt and Miss Suydam were walking cautiously forward
again, selecting every footstep as though treading on the crumbling
edges of an abyss.</p>

<p>"It's rather stupid that I never suspected it," she said, musing
aloud.</p>

<p>"Suspected what?"</p>

<p>"The existence of this other woman called Virginia Suydam. And
I might have been mercifully ignorant of her until I died, if
you had not looked at me and seen us both at once."</p>

<p>"We all are that way."</p>

<p>"Not all women, Louis. Have you found them so? You need not answer.
There is in you, sometimes, a flash of infernal chivalry; do you
know it? I can forgive you a great deal for it; even for discovering
that other and not very staid person, so easily schooled, easily
taught to respond; so easily thrilled, easily beguiled, easily
caressed. Why, with her head falling back on your shoulder so
readily, and her lips so lightly persuaded, one can scarcely believe
her to have been untaught through all these years of dry convention
and routine, or unaware of that depravity, latent, which it took
your unerring faith and skill to discover and develop."</p>

<p>"How far have I developed it?"</p>

<p>She bent her delicate head: "I believe I have already admitted
your moderation."</p>

<p>He shivered, walking forward without looking at her for a pace
or two, then halted.</p>

<p>"Would you marry me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I had rather not. You know it."</p>

<p>"Why?&mdash;once again."</p>

<p>"Because of my strange respect for that other woman that I am&mdash;or
was."</p>

<p>"Which always makes me regret my&mdash;moderation," he said, wincing
under the lash of her words. "But I'm not considering you! I'm
considering the peace of mind of that other woman&mdash;not yours!"
He took her in his arms, none too gently. "Not yours. I'd show
no mercy to <em>you</em>\ There is only one kind of mercy you'd
understand. Look into my eyes and admit it."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>"But your other self understands!"</p>

<p>"Why don't you destroy her?"</p>

<p>"And let her die in her contempt for me? You ask too much &mdash;Virginia-that-I-know.
If that other Virginia-that-I-don't-know loved me, I'd kill <em>this</em>
one, not the other!"</p>

<p>"Do you care for that one, Louis?"</p>

<p>"What answer shall I make?"</p>

<p>"The best you can without lying."</p>

<p>"Then"&mdash;and being in his arms their eyes were close&mdash;"then I
think I could love her if I had a chance. I don't know. I can
deny myself. They say that is the beginning. But I seldom do&mdash;very
seldom. And that is the best answer I can give, and the truest."</p>

<p>"Thank you.... And so you are going to leave me?"</p>

<p>"I am going North. Yes."</p>

<p>"What am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Return to your other self and forget me."</p>

<p>"Thank you again.... Do you know, Louis, that you have never
once by hint or by look or by silence suggested that it was I
who deliberately offered you the first provocation? That is another
flicker of that infernal chivalry of yours."</p>

<p>"Does your other self approve?" he said, laughing.</p>

<p>"My other self is watching us both very closely, Louis. I &mdash;I
wish, sometimes, she were dead! Louis! Louis! as I am now, here
in your arms, I thought I had descended sufficiently to meet you
on your own plane. But&mdash;you seem higher up&mdash;at moments.... And
now, when you are going, you tell my other self to call in the
creature we let loose together, for it will have no longer any
counterpart to caress.... Louis! I <em>do</em> love you; how can
I let you go! Can you tell me? What am I to do? There are times&mdash;there
are moments when I cannot endure it&mdash;the thought of losing the
disgrace of your lips&mdash;your arms&mdash;the sound of your voice. Don't
go and leave me like this&mdash;don't go&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Suydam's head fell. She was crying.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>The eagle on the wet beach, one yellow talon firmly planted on
its offal, tore strip after strip from the quivering mass. The
sun etched his tinted shadow on the sand.</p>

<p>When the tears of Miss Suydam had been appropriately dried, they
turned and retraced their steps very slowly, her head resting
against his shoulder, his arm around her thin waist, her own hand
hanging loosely, trailing the big straw hat and floating veil.</p>

<p>They spoke very seldom&mdash;very, very seldom. Malcourt was too busy
thinking; Virginia too stunned to realise that, it was, now, her
other austere self, bewildered, humiliated, desperate, which was
walking amid the solitude of sky and sea with Louis Malcourt,
there beneath the splendour of the westering sun.</p>

<p>The eagle, undisturbed, tore at the dead thing on the beach,
one yellow talon embedded in the offal.</p>

<p>Their black chair-boy lay asleep under a thicket of Spanish bayonet.</p>

<p>"Arise, O Ethiope, and make ready unto us a chariot!" said Malcourt
pleasantly; and he guided Virginia into her seat while the fat
darky climbed up behind, rubbing slumber from his rolling and
enormous eyes.</p>

<p>Half-way through the labyrinth they met Miss Palliser and Wayward.</p>

<p>"Where on earth have you been?" asked Virginia, so candidly that
Wayward, taken aback, began excuses. But Constance Palliser's
cheeks turned pink; and remained so during her silent ride home
with Wayward.</p>

<p>Lately the world had not been spinning to suit the taste of Constance
Palliser. For one thing Wayward was morose. Besides he appeared
physically ill. She shrank from asking herself the reason; she
might better have asked him for her peace of mind.</p>

<p>Another matter: Virginia, the circumspect, the caste-bound, the
intolerant, the emotionless, was displaying the astounding symptoms
peculiar to the minx! And she had neither the excuse of ignorance
nor of extreme youth. Virginia was a mature maiden, calmly cognisant
of the world, and coolly alive to the doubtful phases of that
planet. And why on earth she chose to affiche herself with a man
like Malcourt, Constance could not comprehend.</p>

<p>And another thing worried the pretty spinster&mdash;the comings, goings,
and occult doings of her nephew with the most distractingly lovely
and utterly impossible girl that fate ever designed to harass
the soul of any young man's aunt.</p>

<p>That Hamil was already in love with Shiela Cardross had become
painfully plainer to her every time she saw him. True, others
were in love with Miss Cardross; that state of mind and heart
seemed to be chronic at Palm Beach. Gussie Vetchen openly admitted
his distinguished consideration, and Courtlandt Classon toddled
busily about Shiela's court, and even the forlorn Cuyp had become
disgustingly unfaithful and no longer wrinkled his long Dutch
nose into a series of white corrugations when Wayward took Miss
Palliser away from him. Alas! the entire male world seemed to
trot in the wake of this sweet-eyed young Circe, emitting appealingly
gentle and propitiating grunts.</p>

<p>"The very deuce is in that girl!" thought Constance, exasperated;
"and the sooner Garry goes North the better. He's madly unhappy
over her.... Fascinating little thing! <em>I</em> can't blame
him too much&mdash;except that he evidently realises he can't marry
such a person&mdash;"</p>

<p>The chair rolled into the hotel grounds under the arch of jasmine.
The orchestra was playing in the colonnade; tea had been served
under the cocoa-nut palms; pretty faces and gay toilets glimmered
familiarly as the chair swept along the edge of the throng.</p>

<p>"Tell the chair-boy that we'll tea here, Jim," said Miss Palliser,
catching sight of her nephew and the guilty Circe under whose
gentle thrall Hamil was now boldly imbibing a swizzle.</p>

<p>So Wayward nodded to the charioteer, the chair halted, and he
and Constance disembarked and advanced across the grass to exchange
amenities with friends and acquaintances. Which formalities always
fretted Wayward, and he stood about, morose and ungracious, while
Constance floated prettily here and there, and at last turned
with nicely prepared surprise to encounter Shiela and Hamil seated
just behind her.</p>

<p>The younger girl, rising, met her more than half-way with gloved
hand frankly offered; Wayward turned to Hamil in subdued relief.</p>

<p>"Lord! I've been looking at those confounded alligators and listening
to Vetchen's and Cuyp's twaddle! Constance wouldn't talk; and
I'm quite unfit for print. What's that in your glass, Garry?"</p>

<p>"A swizzle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anything in it except lime-juice and buzz?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then I won't have one. Constance! Are you drinking tea?"</p>

<p>"Do you want some?" she asked, surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do&mdash;if you can give me some without asking how many lumps
I take&mdash;like the inevitable heroine in a British work of fiction&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jim, what a bear you are to-day!" And to Shiela, who was laughing:
"He snapped and growled at Gussie Vetchen and he glared and glowered
at Livingston Cuyp, and he's scarcely vouchsafed a word to me
this afternoon except the civility you have just heard. Jim, I
<em>will</em> ask you how many lumps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O Lord! Britain triumphant! Two &mdash;I think; ten if you wish,
Constance&mdash;or none at all. Miss Cardross, you wouldn't say such
things to me, would you?"</p>

<p>"Don't answer him," interposed Constance; "if you do you'll take
him away, and I haven't another man left! Why are you such a dreadful
devastator, Miss Cardross?... Here's your tea, James. Please turn
around and occupy yourself with my nephew; I'd like a chance to
talk to Miss Cardross."</p>

<p>The girl had seated herself beside Miss Palliser, and, as Wayward
moved over to the other table, she gave him a perverse glance,
so humourous and so wholly adorable that Constance Palliser yielded
to the charm with an amused sigh of resignation.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said, "Miss Suydam and I are going North very
soon, and we are coming to see your mother at the first opportunity."</p>

<p>"Mother expects you," said the girl simply. "I did not know that
she knew Miss Suydam&mdash;or cared to."</p>

<p>Something in the gentle indifference of the words sent the conscious
blood pulsing into Miss Palliser's cheeks. Then she said frankly:</p>

<p>"Has Virginia been rude to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a little."</p>

<p>"Unpardonably?"</p>

<p>"N-no. I always can pardon."</p>

<p>"You dear!" said Constance impulsively. "Listen; Virginia does
snippy things at times. I don't know why and she doesn't either.
I know she's sorry she was rude to you, but she seems to think
her rudeness too utterly unpardonable. May I tell her it isn't?"</p>

<p>"If you please," said Shiela quietly.</p>

<p>Miss Palliser looked at her, then, succumbing, took her hand
in hers.</p>

<p>"No wonder people like you, Miss Cardross."</p>

<p>"Do <em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>"How could I escape the popular craze?" laughed Miss Palliser,
a trifle embarrassed.</p>

<p>"That is not an answer," returned Shiela, the smile on her red
lips faintly wistful. And Constance surrendered completely.</p>

<p>"You sweet, cunning thing," she said, "I do like you. You are
perfectly adorable, for one reason; for the other, there is something&mdash;a
nameless something about you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite&mdash;nameless," said the girl under her breath.</p>

<p>A little flash of mist confused Miss Palliser's eyesight for
a moment; her senses warned her, but her heart was calling.</p>

<p>"Dear," she said, "I could love you very easily."</p>

<p>Shiela looked her straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>"What you give I can return; no more, no less&mdash;"</p>

<p>But already Constance Palliser had lifted the girl's smooth hand
to her lips, murmuring: "Pride! pride! It is the last refuge for
social failures, Shiela. And you are too wise to enter there,
too sweet and wholesome to remain. Leave us our obsolete pride,
child; God knows we need something in compensation for all that
you possess."</p>

<p>Later they sipped their tea together. "I always wanted you to
like me," said the girl. Her glance wandered toward Hamil so unconsciously
that Constance caught her breath. But the spell was on her still;
she, too, looked at Hamil; admonition, prejudice, inculcated precept,
wavered hazily.</p>

<p>"Because I care so much for Mr. Hamil," continued the girl innocently.</p>

<p>For one instant, in her inmost intelligence, Miss Palliser fiercely
questioned that innocence; then, convinced, looked questioningly
at the girl beside her. So questioningly that Shiela answered:</p>

<p>"What?"&mdash;as though the elder woman had spoken.</p>

<p>"I don't know, dear.... Is there anything you&mdash;you cared to ask
me?&mdash;say to me?&mdash;tell me?&mdash;perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>So fearless and sweet and true the gaze that met her own that
Constance hesitated.</p>

<p>"About Mr. Hamil?"</p>

<p>The girl looked at her; understood her; and the colour mounted
to her temples.</p>

<p>"No," she said slowly, "there is nothing to tell anybody....
There never will be."</p>

<p>"I wish there were, child." Certainly Constance must have gone
quite mad under the spell, for she had Shiela's soft hands in
hers again, and was pressing them close between her palms, repeating:
"I am sorry; I am, indeed. The boy certainly cares for you; he
has told me so a thousand times without uttering a word. I have
known it for weeks&mdash;feared it. <em>Now</em> I wish it. I am sorry."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hamil&mdash;understands&mdash;" faltered Shiela; "I &mdash;I care
so much for him&mdash;so much more than for any other man; but not
in the way you&mdash;you are kind enough to&mdash;wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>Does</em> he understand?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes. I think so. I think we understand each other&mdash;thoroughly.
But"&mdash;she blushed vividly&mdash;"<em>I&mdash;</em>did not dream that <em>you</em>
supposed&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Palliser looked at her searchingly.</p>

<p>" &mdash;But&mdash;it has made me very happy to believe that you consider
me&mdash;acceptable."</p>

<p>"Dearest child, it is evident that <em>we</em> are the unacceptable
ones&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't say that&mdash;or think it. It is absurd&mdash;in one sense....
Are we to be friends in town? Is that what you mean?"</p>

<p>"Indeed we are, if you will."</p>

<p>Miss Cardross nodded and withdrew her hands as Virginia and Malcourt
came into view across the lawn.</p>

<p>Constance, following her glance, saw, and signalled silent invitation;
Malcourt sauntered up, paid his respects airily, and joined Hamil
and Wayward; Virginia spoke in a low voice to Constance, then,
leaning on the back of her chair, looked at Shiela as inoffensively
as she knew how. She said:</p>

<p>"I am very sorry for my rudeness to you. Can you forgive me,
Miss Cardross?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... Won't you have some tea?"</p>

<p>Her direct simplicity left Virginia rather taken aback. Perhaps
she expected some lack of composure in the girl, perhaps a more
prolix acceptance of honourable amends; but this terse and serene
amiability almost suggested indifference; and Virginia seated
herself, not quite knowing how she liked it.</p>

<p>Afterward she said to Miss Palliser:</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such self-possession, my dear? You know I might
pardon my maid in exactly the same tone and manner."</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't ask your maid to tea, would you?" said Constance,
gently amused.</p>

<p>"I might, if I could afford to," she nodded listlessly. "I believe
that girl could do it without disturbing her Own self-respect
or losing caste below stairs or above. As for the Van Dieman&mdash;just
common cat, Constance."</p>

<p>Miss Palliser laughed. "Shiela Cardross refused the Van Dieman
son and heir&mdash;if you think that might be an explanation of the
cattishness."</p>

<p>"Really?" asked Virginia, without interest. "Where did you hear
that gossip?"</p>

<p>"From our vixenish tabby herself. The thin and vindictive are
usually without a real sense of humour. I rather suspected young
Jan Van Dieman's discomfiture. He left, you know, just after Garret
arrived," she added demurely.</p>

<p>Virginia raised her eyes at the complacent inference; but even
curiosity seemed to have died out in her, and she only said, languidly:</p>

<p>"You think she cares for Garret? And you approve?"</p>

<p>"I think I'd approve if she did. Does that astonish you?"</p>

<p>"Not very much."</p>

<p>Virginia seemed to have lost all spirit. She laughed rarely,
nowadays. She was paler, too, than usual&mdash;paler than was ornamental;
and pallor suited her rather fragile features, too. Also she had
become curiously considerate of other people's feelings&mdash;rather
subdued; less ready in her criticisms; gentler in judgments. All
of which symptoms Constance had already noted with incredulity
and alarm.</p>

<p>"Where did you and Louis Malcourt go this afternoon?" she asked,
unpegging her hair.</p>

<p>"Out to the beach. There was nothing there except sky and water,
and a filthy eagle dining on a dead fish."</p>

<p>Miss Palliser waited, sitting before her dresser; but as Virginia
offered no further information she shook out the splendid masses
of her chestnut hair and, leaning forward, examined her features
in the mirror with minute attention.</p>

<p>"It's strange," she murmured, half to herself, "how ill Jim Wayward
has been looking recently. I can't account for it."</p>

<p>"I can, dear," said Virginia gently.</p>

<p>Constance turned in surprise.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Malcourt says that he is practising self-denial. It hurts,
you know."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Constance, flushing up.</p>

<p>"I said that it hurts."</p>

<p>"Such a slur as that harms Louis Malcourt&mdash;not Mr. Wayward!"
returned Constance hotly.</p>

<p>Virginia repeated: "It hurts&mdash;to kill desire. It hurts even before
habit is acquired ... they say. Louis Malcourt says so. And if
that is true&mdash;can you wonder that poor Mr. Wayward looks like
death? I speak in all sympathy and kindness&mdash;as did Mr. Malcourt."</p>

<p>So <em>that</em> was it! Constance stared at her own fair face
in the mirror, and deep into the pained brown eyes reflected there.
The eyes suddenly dimmed and the parted mouth quivered.</p>

<p>So that was the dreadful trouble!&mdash;the explanation of the recent
change in him&mdash;the deep lines of pain from the wing of the pinched
nostril&mdash;the haunted gaze, the long, restless silences, the forced
humour and its bitter flavour tainting voice and word!</p>

<p>And she had believed&mdash;feared with a certainty almost hopeless&mdash;that
it was his old vice, slowly, inexorably transforming what was
left of the man she had known so long and cared for so loyally
through all these strange, confusing years.</p>

<p>From the mirror the oval of her own fresh unravaged face, framed
in the burnished brown of her hair, confronted her like a wraith
of the past; and, dreaming there, wide-eyed, expressionless, she
seemed to see again the old-time parlour set with rosewood; and
the faded roses in the carpet; and, through the half-drawn curtains,
spring sunlight falling on a boy and a little girl.</p>

<p>Virginia, partly dressed for dinner, rose and went to the window,
frail restless hands clasped behind her back, and stood there
gazing out at the fading daylight. Perhaps the close of day made
her melancholy; for there were traces of tears on her lashes;
perhaps it suggested the approaching end of a dream so bright
and strange that, at times, a dull pang of dread stilled her heart&mdash;checking
for a moment its heavy beating.</p>

<p>Light died in the room; the panes turned silvery, then darker
as the swift Southern night fell over sea, lagoon, and forest.</p>

<p>Far away in the wastes of dune and jungle the sweet flute-like
tremolo of an owl broke out, prolonged infinitely. From the dark
garden below, a widow-bird called breathlessly, its ghostly cry,
now a far whisper in the night, now close at hand, husky, hurried,
startling amid the shadows. And, whir! whir-r-r! thud! came the
great soft night-moths against the window screens where sprays
of silvery jasmine clung, perfuming all the night.</p>

<p>Still Constance sat before the mirror which was now invisible
in the dusk, bare elbows on the dresser's edge, face framed in
her hands over which the thick hair rippled. And, in the darkness,
her brown eyes closed&mdash;perhaps that they might behold more clearly
the phantoms of the past together there in an old-time parlour,
where the golden radiance of suns long dead still lingered, warming
the faded roses on the floor.</p>

<p>And after a long while her maid came with a card; and she straightened
up in her chair, gathered the filmy robe of lace, and, rising,
pressed the electric switch. But Virginia had returned to her
own room to bathe her eyelids and pace the floor until she cared
to face the outer world once more and, for another hour or two,
deceive it.</p>
