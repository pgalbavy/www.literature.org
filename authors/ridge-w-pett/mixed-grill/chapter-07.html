<p>IT was pleasant to get about the square of the station—where luggage had
to be labelled and heated passengers stormed at porters and a rather
stout brass bell was rung, and where at moments of pressure it did seem
that the world had suddenly gone mad—pleasant to stroll there and to feel
you were one of the few who recognised the identity of the quiet man
smoking a briar pipe and carrying an umbrella, over near the label case.
He was middle-aged, with an unobtrusive manner; in the summer he wore a
straw hat sedately; he seemed to be always waiting for a train that never
arrived.  If a loiterer made his way into the station and stood about the
bookstall longer than seemed necessary, the quiet man would go near to
him, moving when he moved, stopping when he stopped, and losing no sight
of him until he went off.  The quiet man had apparently no friends, and
the staff addressed him rarely.
</p>
<p>Now the Station Master’s boy knew that this man was a retired member of
the police force, the plain-clothes detective attached to the terminus.
And in connection with a predecessor of this mysterious official they
told him, in the Up Parcels Office, an incident.
</p><hr/>
<p>Sergeant Bellchambers had not succeeded in gaining the popularity that
most men, in this world, desire, but one or two of his first
investigations received favourable comment from the General Manager, and
this repaid him for lack of sympathy from others.  It was said that in
the M division they had been glad to see him take his pension and go, the
opinion of the Inspector’s desk being that Bellchambers was a born
muddler.  This might have been the invention of the station staff; what
was quite certain was that in his reports on blue paper in the early
cases referred to he fixed blame on men whom the station considered
innocent, and these men were, in consequence, fined or reduced.
Moreover, he had not been content with singling out individuals and
recommending them for the stocks, but he condemned an entire department;
for which reason the station said darkly:
</p><p>“We shall ’ave to get our own back.”
</p><p>This was the state of things when the cigar robberies began.  Parcels of
cigars came up regularly from a certain firm and from a certain local
station, sometimes for delivery in London, sometimes for transfer to
another railway; one parcel in four reached its destination in good
appearance outwardly, but with part of the contents abstracted.  The firm
made heavy claims, wrote furious letters, and at last managed to get a
communication into the public press in which bitter reference was made to
the supineness and slothful behaviour of the railway company.  The
Superintendent of the Line sent for Bellchambers, withdrawing him from
easy duties on the station square.
</p><p>“The only question is—” said the high official.
</p><p>“Where do these robberies take place?” suggested Bellchambers.  “That’s
the point,” he added sagely, “that’s what we’ve got to get at.”
</p><p>“What is your opinion, Sergeant?”
</p><p>Sergeant Bellchambers made a fine pretence of taking thought before he
answered.  Then with red-ink pen he wrote on an envelope and passed it
across the table.
</p><p>“Up Office,” read the Superintendent.
</p><p>“’Ush,” said Bellchambers warningly.
</p><p>“Do you think you can find the thieves?”
</p><p>“If I’m given a free hand,” said Bellchambers, “and no quibble raised,
sir, about my petty disbursements.”
</p><p>“Go in and win,” said the Superintendent.  “When do you start?”
</p><p>“This very night, sir?”
</p><p>“Let me have a report in the morning.”
</p><p>That evening the head of the department sent to the Up Office a new hand
to assist the late-duty men.  He was black-bearded with a very ruddy
face, and he wore a uniform that had apparently belonged to a shorter and
a slimmer person.  His name, he said, was Edward Jones, but the Up Office
seemed not contented with this and decided on the suggestion of a junior
clerk to call him by the title of “Sunset.”  He settled to the work with
moderate determination, calling off parcels and sorting them into bins
for delivery with perhaps more intelligence than the raw amateur usually
showed: he spoke in a hoarse voice, and this he accounted for by
confessing himself a slave to tobacco; he discussed the matter with the
other men, between the arrival of trains, and seemed, not unnaturally,
more interested in those who smoked than in the one or two who limited
themselves to a cigarette a week, consumed after dinner on Sundays.  The
Up Office always had a composite scent, in which fruit, game, cheese, and
other things mixed, with sometimes one gaining ascendancy, sometimes
another; a new flavour of a more pleasant and a vaguer character was
contributed presently by a small brown-paper-covered box, brought in from
an arrival platform, bearing a proud label:—
</p><p><strong>VALUABLE CIGARS.</strong>
</p><p><strong>KEEP DRY.</strong>
</p><p>“’Ere’s a chance for some one,” said the porter, as he called it off.
“Sunset, old chum, these’d do your palate good.”
</p><p>“Silly thing to mark ’em like that,” remarked the new man.  “It’s
throwing temptation in anybody’s way.  I should say they’re likely enough
worth about fifteen pence to one-and-six a-piece.”
</p><p>“How d’you know?”
</p><p>“I don’t profess to know,” said the new man hurriedly.  “I’m only giving
a rough estimate.  But bless my soul,” he went on after a pause, “what a
refining influence a cigar has.”
</p><p>“If it’s a good one,” suggested a boy porter.
</p><p>“They’re all good,” declared the new man with enthusiasm.  “They’re like
the ladies in that respect.  Some are better’n others, but they’re all
good.”
</p><p>“Not a married man, then?” asked a foreman.
</p><p>“I’m a bloomin’ bachelor,” said the new chum.  “And what a thing it is on
your Sunday off, when you’re waiting at the end of her road, to light up
a cigar with a fine aroma to it.  It not only gives you an air of
belonging to the ’igher aristocracy, but it also carries away any
suspicion of corduroy that might be ’anging about.”
</p><p>“I’ve never give less than twopence,” remarked the boy porter.
</p><p>“I’m sorry for you,” said the new man.  “I should have thought a chap
with your fore’ead had got more ambition.  Why, when I was a lad of your
height—”
</p><p>“Pardon me,” interrupted the foreman, “you seem to ’ave a most
extr’ordinary flow of conversation.”
</p><p>“I’m celebrated for it.”
</p><p>“I wonder,” said the foreman curiously, “whether you’d mind stopping it
for a moment and doing a bit of work instead.  Reason I suggest it is
that the Company pays you for what you do and not for what you talk.”
</p><p>“I can take a ’int,” said the new man coldly.
</p><p>There seemed a desire on the part of the others that night to make Porter
Jones work as hard as it is possible for a man to work.  The heaviest
hampers were confided to his care; the slimiest cases of fish were placed
upon his shoulder; he it was who was told off to see to some consignments
of rather advanced venison.  The parcel of valuable cigars remained in
the Number Five bin to be transferred to another Company by the first
delivery in the morning, and it was observed that whenever Porter Jones
came into the office he glanced in that direction.  Now the Up Office, as
I have hinted, had been perturbed over the recent complaints, and the
mere fact that they had to fill up memoranda in regard to the various
investigations, to the effect that, “I beg to say in reference to the
attached papers that I know nothing whatever of the matter, I am, sir,
your obedient servant,” this in itself was enough to put a keener edge on
observation.  Wherefore, a secret meeting was held near the gas-stove by
the booking-up desk, and it was decided that the new man should be
watched closely; it was felt it would be a proud and estimable thing for
the office, the character of which was at this period slurred, if it
could itself detect a wrong-doer and take him to justice.  And should it
happen that the detected one proved to be a new man with no friends in
the department to lament his fall, then the most doubtful would have to
revert to old beliefs in a wise and thoughtful Providence.  Their
suspicions were increased by the fact that whenever Porter Jones, in the
brief intervals between work from nine o’clock onwards, resumed
conversation, he invariably bent its direction towards the subject of
cigars.
</p><p>“Take no notice,” whispered the foreman to his colleagues.  “At least
when I say take no notice, I mean take all the notice you can, but keep
your little heads shut as tight as possible.”
</p><p>“Shall one of us lay up for him?”
</p><p>“Who’s the smallest?” asked the foreman, with an air of having already
thought of this device.
</p><p>“I are,” said the boy porter.
</p><p>“Evidently,” remarked the foreman, looking down at him, “evidently a chap
of superior education.  Country born, ain’t you?”
</p><p>“I were.”
</p><p>“Then,” said the foreman, “up you jump behind them ‘books off’ and you
watch, my lad, watch Sunset for all you are worth.”
</p><p>The Up Office closed at midnight in order to sleep for a few hours.
Before that time the men had made preparations for departure, packing
shining hand-bags and exchanging the official cap for a bowler hat, and
brushing their boots; this last act is one of which the railway man never
tires.  Porter Jones alone seemed to be taking no preliminary steps, and
when asked where he lived replied lightly and evasively that he should
probably finish up at the Carlton Club.  The gas lights were turned down
one by one and darkness increased its possession of the office.  Porter
Jones went up to the end where Bin Number Five was situated; the others
hummed to give a suggestion of unconcern.  Suddenly there was commotion
at the darkened end of the office, and seizing hand lamps, they hurried
forward.
</p><p>“’Old him, ’old him,” cried the boy porter.  The counsel seemed
unnecessary, for he gripped Porter Jones most effectively by the collar
of the corduroy jacket.  “Set on his ’ead.  Lam him one.”
</p><p>“What’s all this fuss about?” demanded the foreman.
</p><p>“He’s got it,” screamed the boy porter.  “Sunset’s got it hid under his
jacket.”
</p><p>“Got what hid?” asked the foreman.  “Let’s ’ave the facts first of all.”
</p><p>“I can easily explain,” gasped the new man.  “I only wanted to see if—
Make him leave go.  He’s—he’s throttling me.”
</p><p>“He’s a-trying to,” admitted the boy porter.
</p><p>“Let him loose,” ordered the foreman.  “Men, stand around him so as he
can’t make his escape.  What’s that bulging under your arm, matey?”
</p><p>The new man gave an awkward laugh, as he withdrew the labelled parcel.
</p><p>“I can explain it all to you,” he said, addressing the foreman and trying
to rebutton his torn collar, “if you will favour me with two minutes
alone outside.”
</p><p>“Don’t you do it,” advised the others.  “See him ’anged first.”
</p><p>“Whatsoever you ’ave to say,” declared the foreman steadily, “you’d
better say it here and now.”
</p><p>“Well, it’s like this.  I’m the detective.”
</p><p>“Ho!” said the foreman satirically.  “Detective and thief in one, eh?
Vurry ’appy combination, I must say.”
</p><p>“See here,” said the other, annoyed at the incredulous tone, “I’ll take
off this beard and then you can some of you identify me.”
</p><p>As he did so the foreman held up his hand lamp, examining the features
carefully.
</p><p>“Do any of you chaps recognise him?”
</p><p>The staff replied at once that to the best of their belief they had never
before in this world set eyes on him.
</p><p>“Don’t play the goat,” he urged anxiously.  “We’ve all got our duties to
perform.”
</p><p>“That’s true; we shall ’ave to lock you up for the night.”
</p><p>“Right you are,” said the other gleefully.  “Take me round to the nearest
police station and then—”
</p><p>“That would mean losing our last train ’ome,” pointed out the foreman.
</p><p>“I s’pose,” said the boy porter respectfully, “it wouldn’t do to put him
in the lamp room?”
</p><p>“Chaps,” said the foreman, “my idea is we’d better, I think, put him in
the lamp room.  Get Porter Swan to lend you the keys, my lad.  As for
you, you scoundrel—”
</p><p>“If you so much as dare to lock me up there I’ll see that you regret it
every day of your lives.”  He argued vehemently.
</p><p>“Look ’ere, me man,” said the boy porter, returning with the keys, “we
want none of your empty threats.  If you think we’re going to be bluffed
by a chap of your calibre—”
</p><p>“My what?” shouted the indignant man, struggling to get at the lad.
</p><p>“Go on, my child,” said the foreman approvingly.  “Let him have some of
your long ones.”  The foreman turned to the others.
</p><p>“This is where your school teaching comes in ’andy,” he whispered.
</p><p>“A chap of your calibre,” repeated the boy porter, encouraged; “you’re
labouring under the very worst misapprehension—”
</p><p>“Good!” said the others.
</p><p>“Worst misapprehension that you ever suffered from or endured or
tolerated or submitted to or underwent or—”
</p><p>“That’s enough for him,” interrupted the foreman, “we’d best not overdo
it.  Got his arms tied, lads?”
</p><p>“You’ll suffer for this,” he cried.
</p><p>“I’ll take me oath you will,” said the foreman.  “Now then, two of you at
each arm and—march!  Boy, blow out the gas and lock up.”
</p><p>No one was encountered on the way to the lamp room who had authority to
interfere with the plans of the Up Office, and the unfortunate man was
conducted at a sharp walk to that gloomy, sooty, greasy haven.  The place
reeked with oily waste, and some appeared to have been smouldering,
giving a result that nice people would call displeasing.  The uneven
flooring was laid out with lakes of dirty water; zinc counters did not
permit themselves to be touched.  The foreman turned out the one glimmer
of light as though by accident.
</p><p>“Got a match on you?” he asked the prisoner in a kindly tone.
</p><p>“Only one box.”
</p><p>“Hand it over,” ordered the foreman, “for a moment.  Thanks,” slipping it
into his pocket.  “Now we can catch our twelve-fifteen.  Good night, old
sort.”
</p><p>“’Appy dreams,” cried the others.
</p><p>“Don’t be late in the morning,” called out the boy porter.
</p><p>The imprisoned man, not daring to trust himself to reply, heard the door
close, heard the lock shoot.  He groaned, and began to reckon the black
hours that he would have to endure in the place; at the least, the number
would be six; he did not care to think what it might be at the most.
Throughout the whole of the time he was unable to close his eyes, and his
only relief to the length of the hours came by thinking of the report
that he would indite the following morning.  He polished up in his mind
some of the references to the boy porter, and to the man who gripped his
arm in bringing him from the Up Office; it seemed that his suspicions in
regard to the pilferages were centred, for some reason, on those who had
most aggrieved him.  Before daylight began to grin at him through the
barred window of the lamp room he had mentally completed his report, and
the last paragraph he felt was especially good.
</p><p>    “I am able to speak with absolute certainty, and I can go so far as
    to say the men who are undoubtedly responsible for the recent
    pilferages are those I have named, and I beg to suggest respectfully
    that steps be taken to relieve them of their present duties at the
    earliest possible moment.  The only alternative is a clean sweep of
    the whole of the Up Office staff, and this, sir, I hesitate to
    recommend.  But for reasons that I have stated, and for others which
    I think it wise not to place upon paper, I earnestly hope that the
    recommendation I have made will be acted upon without delay.
</p><p><strong>“W. BELLCHAMBERS.</strong>
</p><p>    “P.S.—Especially the foreman and the junior.”
</p><p>“Can’t make it hotter for them,” said Sergeant Bellchambers to himself
regretfully, “without it looking as though I’d got some personal spite.”
</p><p>The night seemed endless, but it proved to have a finish, and
Bellchambers, when the lamp-man opened the door in the morning, went out,
a tired, oil-scented, yawning, but a determined official.  A wash and a
shave increased the last quality, and when the Superintendent arrived at
nine o’clock, morning paper under his arm, Sergeant Bellchambers was
waiting for him in the lobby of the office with confidence written all
over his face in large letters.
</p><p>“Evening, sir.”
</p><p>“Good-morning, Sergeant.”
</p><p>“I mean morning,” corrected Bellchambers.  “I’ve been up all night over
that little affair you spoke about.”
</p><p>“Ah!” said the Superintendent, sitting down in his arm-chair, “with no
result?”
</p><p>“On the contrary, sir,” said Sergeant Bellchambers importantly.  “If it
isn’t troubling you too much I’ll trouble you to cast your eyes over this
report of mine.”
</p><p>The Superintendent let his glasses flick open and adjusted them on his
nose.  The Sergeant, leaning one arm on the mantelpiece, watched his
superior officer, waiting for the sign of gratified approval.  This, to
his great astonishment, did not come, and the Superintendent’s face
remained unchanged when he had thrown the report on the shining table.
</p><p>“Do you mean to say that you want me to get rid of these men?”
</p><p>“That was the impression,” said the Sergeant, with a touch of acidity, “I
intended to convey.”
</p><p>“And you think they’re guilty?”
</p><p>“I’ll stake my reputation on it, sir,” said Sergeant Bellchambers.
</p><p>“That is not much of a bet,” remarked the other.
</p><p>“You can take it from me that these pilferages will never cease until the
men I’ve referred to are turned out.”
</p><p>“I’m very anxious to do something,” said the Superintendent, taking up a
ruler thoughtfully.
</p><p>“Like myself, sir,” said Bellchambers.  “That’s me all over.”
</p><p>“But not,” said the Superintendent, hitting the table, “not in the
direction you suggest.  Read this!”
</p><p>He handed over the morning paper to Sergeant Bellchambers, pointing to a
letter headed “Recent Complaints of Pilferages.”
</p><p>“Ah!” said the Sergeant exultingly, “they’re going for us again, then.
‘Dear Sir,’ he read.  ‘With reference to our letters to you complaining
of abstraction from our parcels of cigars sent by railway, we think it
only right to inform you that we have discovered these pilferages were
made by one of our own men.  It appears that after delivering the parcels
at the station here, and after they were weighed, he was in the habit of
offering to take them to the train, and whilst doing this effected the
robberies to which reference has been made.  We need scarcely point out
that if the station had been wisely managed these lamentable occurrences
would in all probability never have taken place; the only question is,
who is responsible?  We are, dear sir, yours faithfully—’”
</p><p>“A paltry trick to play on anybody,” said the Sergeant.  “At the same
time, sir, I think there’ll be no harm in making a change in the staff.”
</p><p>“I intend to do so.  Will you keep your eyes open, Sergeant—”
</p><p>“Ain’t they always?”
</p><p>“And,” said the Superintendent, “look out for another berth.  Shut the
door quietly after you.”
