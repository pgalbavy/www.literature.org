<p>
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They pursued it with forks and hope;<br/>
They threatened its life with a railway-share;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They charmed it with smiles and soap.

</p>
<p>
But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Beaver’s lace-making was wrong,<br/>
Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That his fancy had dwelt on so long.

</p>
<p>
He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,<br/>
Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the charge of deserting its sty.

</p>
<p>
The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sty was deserted when found:<br/>
And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a soft under-current of sound.

</p>
<p>
The indictment had never been clearly expressed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it seemed that the Snark had begun,<br/>
And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the pig was supposed to have done.

</p>
<p>
The Jury had each formed a different view<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Long before the indictment was read),<br/>
And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One word that the others had said.

</p>
<p>
"You must know&mdash;" said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed "Fudge!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That statute is obsolete quite!<br/>
Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an ancient manorial right.

</p>
<p>
"In the matter of Treason the pig would appear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have aided, but scarcely abetted:<br/>
While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you grant the plea ‘never indebted.’

</p>
<p>
"The fact of Desertion I will not dispute;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But its guilt, as I trust, is removed<br/>
(So far as related to the costs of this suit)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the Alibi which has been proved.

</p>
<p>
"My poor client’s fate now depends on your votes."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the speaker sat down in his place,<br/>
And directed the Judge to refer to his notes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And briefly to sum up the case.

</p>
<p>
But the Judge said he never had summed up before;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Snark undertook it instead,<br/>
And summed it so well that it came to far more<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the Witnesses ever had said!

</p>
<p>
When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the word was so puzzling to spell;<br/>
But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn’t mind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undertaking that duty as well.

</p>
<p>
So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was spent with the toils of the day:<br/>
When it said the word "<em>GUILTY!" </em>the Jury all groaned,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some of them fainted away.

</p>
<p>
Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too nervous to utter a word:<br/>
When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fall of a pin might be heard.

</p>
<p>
"Transportation for life" was the sentence it gave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And <em>then</em> to be fined forty pound."<br/>
&nbsp;The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the phrase was not legally sound.

</p>
<p>
But their wild exultation was suddenly checked<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the jailer informed them, with tears,<br/>
Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the pig had been dead for some years.

</p>
<p>
The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Snark, though a little aghast,<br/>
As the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went bellowing on to the last.

</p>
<p>
Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To grow every moment more clear:<br/>
Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.<br/>
