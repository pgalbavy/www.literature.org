Of course, no personal tale is complete without bringing the
narrative of the person down to the last moment.  But mine is no
tale of a reformed drunkard.  I was never a drunkard, and I have
not reformed.
<P>
It chanced, some time ago, that I made a voyage of one hundred and
forty-eight days in a windjammer around the Horn.  I took no
private supply of alcohol along, and, though there was no day of
those one hundred and forty-eight days that I could not have got a
drink from the captain, I did not take a drink.  I did not take a
drink because I did not desire a drink.  No one else drank on
board.  The atmosphere for drinking was not present, and in my
system there was no organic need for alcohol.  My chemistry did
not demand alcohol.
<P>
So there arose before me a problem, a clear and simple problem:
THIS IS SO EASY, WHY NOT KEEP IT UP WHEN YOU GET BACK ON LAND?  I
weighed this problem carefully.  I weighed it for five months, in
a state of absolute non-contact with alcohol.  And out of the data
of past experience, I reached certain conclusions.
<P>
In the first place, I am convinced that not one man in ten
thousand or in a hundred thousand is a genuine, chemical
dipsomaniac.  Drinking, as I deem it, is practically entirely a
habit of mind.  It is unlike tobacco, or cocaine, or morphine, or
all the rest of the long list of drugs.  The desire for alcohol is
quite peculiarly mental in its origin.  It is a matter of mental
training and growth, and it is cultivated in social soil.  Not one
drinker in a million began drinking alone.  All drinkers begin
socially, and this drinking is accompanied by a thousand social
connotations such as I have described out of my own experience in
the first part of this narrative.  These social connotations are
the stuff of which the drink habit is largely composed.  The part
that alcohol itself plays is inconsiderable when compared with the
part played by the social atmosphere in which it is drunk.  The
human is rarely born these days, who, without long training in the
social associations of drinking, feels the irresistible chemical
propulsion of his system toward alcohol.  I do assume that such
rare individuals are born, but I have never encountered one.
<P>
On this long, five-months' voyage, I found that among all my
bodily needs not the slightest shred of a bodily need for alcohol
existed.  But this I did find: my need was mental and social. 
When I thought of alcohol, the connotation was fellowship.  When I
thought of fellowship, the connotation was alcohol.  Fellowship
and alcohol were Siamese twins.  They always occurred linked
together.
<P>
Thus, when reading in my deck chair or when talking with others,
practically any mention of any part of the world I knew instantly
aroused the connotation of drinking and good fellows.  Big nights
and days and moments, all purple passages and freedoms, thronged
my memory.  "Venice" stares at me from the printed page, and I
remember the cafe tables on the sidewalks.  "The Battle of
Santiago," some one says, and I answer, "Yes, I've been over the
ground." But I do not see the ground, nor Kettle Hill, nor the
Peace Tree.  What I see is the Cafe Venus, on the plaza of
Santiago, where one hot night I drank and talked with a dying
consumptive.
<P>
The East End of London, I read, or some one says; and first of
all, under my eyelids, leap the visions of the shining pubs, and
in my ears echo the calls for "two of bitter" and "three of
Scotch." The Latin Quarter--at once I am in the student cabarets,
bright faces and keen spirits around me, sipping cool, well-
dripped absinthe while our voices mount and soar in Latin fashion
as we settle God and art and democracy and the rest of the simple
problems of existence.
<P>
In a pampero off the River Plate we speculate, if we are disabled,
of running in to Buenos Ayres, the "Paris of America," and I have
visions of bright congregating places of men, of the jollity of
raised glasses, and of song and cheer and the hum of genial
voices.  When we have picked up the North-east Trades in the
Pacific we try to persuade our dying captain to run for Honolulu,
and while I persuade I see myself again drinking cocktails on the
cool lanais and fizzes out at Waikiki where the surf rolls in. 
Some one mentions the way wild ducks are cooked in the restaurants
of San Francisco, and at once I am transported to the light and
clatter of many tables, where I gaze at old friends across the
golden brims of long-stemmed Rhine-wine glasses.
<P>
And so I pondered my problem.  I should not care to revisit all
these fair places of the world except in the fashion I visited
them before.  GLASS IN HAND!  There is a magic in the phrase.  It
means more than all the words in the dictionary can be made to
mean.  It is a habit of mind to which I have been trained all my
life.  It is now part of the stuff that composes me.  I like the
bubbling play of wit, the chesty laughs, the resonant voices of
men, when, glass in hand, they shut the grey world outside and
prod their brains with the fun and folly of an accelerated pulse.
<P>
No, I decided; I shall take my drink on occasion.  With all the
books on my shelves, with all the thoughts of the thinkers shaded
by my particular temperament, I decided coolly and deliberately
that I should continue to do what I had been trained to want to
do.  I would drink--but oh, more skilfully, more discreetly, than
ever before.  Never again would I be a peripatetic conflagration. 
Never again would I invoke the White Logic.  I had learned how not
to invoke him.
<P>
The White Logic now lies decently buried alongside the Long
Sickness.  Neither will afflict me again.  It is many a year since
I laid the Long Sickness away; his sleep is sound.  And just as
sound is the sleep of the White Logic.  And yet, in conclusion, I
can well say that I wish my forefathers had banished John
Barleycorn before my time.  I regret that John Barleycorn
flourished everywhere in the system of society in which I was
born, else I should not have made his acquaintance, and I was long
trained in his acquaintance.
