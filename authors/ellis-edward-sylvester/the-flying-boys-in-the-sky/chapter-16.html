<p>Harvey Hamilton stood speechless. When he spoke to Professor
Morgan, they were no more than a rod apart, with only the broad
open space in front of the hotel between them. Upon hearing himself
addressed, the man had looked straight into the face of the lad
and then, as already said, passed on without the faintest sign
of recognition.</p>

<p>A more direct snub cannot be imagined, and yet it was not in
the nature of a snub. Nothing had occurred that could justify
so marked a slight. The humiliation which Harvey felt for a few
seconds quickly passed away.</p>

<p>"He must have been too absorbed in reverie to see me, and yet
that can’t be possible, for he showed that he heard me call him
by his title."</p>

<p>By and by the young aviator reached the only conclusion that
seemed reasonable.</p>

<p>"He is a crank in every sense of the word; he is as crazy as
a June bug; he was friendly enough last night and this forenoon,
and now he is in a different mood. Well, I shall always feel grateful
for the good turn he did me. If we meet again, he may be in a
more genial frame of mind; at least I hope so."</p>

<p>The downpour was increasing and the air had become so chilly
that Harvey passed inside to the sitting-room. The same number
of men were present as before, smoking, chewing and gossiping.
He glanced into their countenances, as he moved his chair beside
the sleeping Bohunkus Johnson, prepared to pass the dismal hours
as best he could without finding any reading matter in the form
of books or newspapers. He had registered before dinner and engaged
a room for himself and another for his companion. His letters
were given to the landlord, who promised to send them to the post
office in time for the afternoon’s mail.</p>

<p>Somehow or other, there was one man among the group in whom Harvey
felt a slight interest, though he attributed the fact to the lack
of anything else to engage his mind. This individual was standing
at the desk, when Harvey came from the outside, studying the dog-eared
register, as if he too was guided by some idle impulse. He glanced
at the newcomer and followed him into the larger room, where he
lighted a cigar and took a seat against the other wall.</p>

<p>He was of slight frame, in middle life, dressed in a gray business
suit, with clean shaven face, a thin sharp nose, good teeth and
keen blue eyes. He was alert of manner, and might well have been
a drummer held in town for a brief while against his will. When
Harvey glanced at him again he quickly averted his eyes. Apparently
he did not wish to be detected in the act and he came within a
hair of succeeding in his attempt. He gazed in an absent way through
the door leading to the bar-room and smoked his cigar like a man
who thoroughly enjoyed the weed.</p>

<p>Being in an idle mood, Harvey twisted the corner of his handkerchief
into a tight spiral, making the end quite stiff and pointed, and,
leaning forward, began drawing it back and forth against the base
of the sleeping Bohunkus Johnson’s nose. Immediately every other
person in the room began watching the proceedings.</p>

<p>For a little while the negro slept on undisturbed. Then he suddenly
crinkled his broad, flat nose and flipped his hand at the fly
or mosquito that was supposed to be tickling him. The spectators
grinned, and Harvey waited till Bunk was slumbering as heavily
as before. Then he resumed his role of Tantalus. This time he
tickled so energetically that Bunk struck impatiently at his tormentor
and banged the top of the chair a vigorous blow—so vigorous indeed
that several of the men snickered and the dusky youth opened his
eyes and raised his head, as wide awake as ever in his life.</p>

<p>"Think yo’s smart, doan’ yo’?" he growled, donning the cap that
had fallen to the floor and shaking himself together.</p>

<p>"The next thing, Bunk, you’ll fall asleep in the biplane and
tumble out head first."</p>

<p>"I doan’ see dat it’ll make any difference to yo’ if I do," replied
the other, nettled by the general laughter more than by the manner
of his awaking.</p>

<p>"It won’t, but it will to you. If you want to sleep all the time
go to your room."</p>

<p>Bohunkus mumbled something, shifted his position, sank down in
his chair until he seemed to be sitting on the upper part of his
spine, and in a few minutes was nodding again. Harvey molested
him no further, but looking up discovered by a furtive glance
that the thin young man in gray had been studying him for an indefinite
time, though quick to shift his gaze as before.</p>

<p>Harvey drew his note-book from his pocket, and, bringing his
chair to the table, began making sketches with his pencil, wholly
from imagination. The stranger, a little while later, drew up
his seat opposite and busied himself in the same way. Thus the
situation remained for perhaps ten minutes.</p>

<p>Suddenly a pellet of paper the size of a dime was flipped across
the brief space and fell upon the page that was covered with Harvey’s
tracings. He knew it came from the man on the other side of the
table, and he understood it was meant to be secret. It was an
extraordinary way by which to communicate with him, when it would
have been easy to speak one or two words in so guarded tones that
they could not be overheard. But the man must have had his reasons,
which would appear later.</p>

<p>With that quickness of resource that has been shown to be a marked
trait of Harvey Hamilton, he did a bright thing. Without betraying
any haste or interest, he picked up the tiny wad and slipped it
into his waistcoat pocket. He did not even look at the stranger,
but nodded his head, keeping his eyes on his note-book. A minute
later the man rose from his chair and sauntered into the bar-room,
turning off to one side so as to be out of sight of the youth
had he looked for him while still in his seat, which he did not.</p>

<p>It was with curious emotions that Harvey saw he was called upon
to play a peculiar role. He had been given a written communication
in such a manner as to make it certain the sender wished no other
person to know what had taken place. The youth must read the message,
but do so secretly. To untwist the bit and examine it while in
the sitting-room would betray everything. Only one course remained.</p>

<p>It was not yet dark, for it will be remembered it was summer
time, but stepping to the bar, behind which the landlord was standing
serving a customer, Harvey asked for the key to his room. It was
handed to him from a nail and he was directed to ascend the stairs
to the upper hall, along which he was to walk until he saw the
number "34" on the door.</p>

<p>As Harvey started to follow directions, he glanced about the
bar-room, in which there were six or eight persons, but the author
of the mysterious message was not among them. He was standing
on the porch outside, and looked for an instant through the window
at Harvey, but no sign or signal was exchanged between them.</p>

<p>Not until he had entered his room and locked the door did Harvey
unroll the paper pellet, and, standing by the window where the
light was good, read the following words:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I shall knock at your door at nine o’clock this evening. Keep<br/>
your colored servant out of the way. I have something important<br/>
to say to you. When we meet outside of your room neither must<br/>
show that he has ever met the other. Don’t fail me.

</p>
<p>
S. P."

</p>
</div>
<p>After the perplexity caused by these curious sentences, Harvey
Hamilton’s feeling was that of amusement.</p>

<p>"I have come to Chesterton in my aeroplane, and dived head first
into one of the most tremendous mysteries that ever was. Bunk
and I set out to find adventure and it looks as if we had struck
it rich. But what the mischief can it all mean?"</p>

<p>Try as hard as he might, he could not take the matter as seriously
as it seemed to him he ought to do. The time was well on in the
twentieth century, he was in one of the most civilized sections
of the Union, and things as a rule were conducted in accordance
with law. Surely "S. P." was not hinting at murder, or burglary,
or incendiarism, or any other heinous crime.</p>

<p>"What is he driving at and who is he?"</p>

<p>Harvey Hamilton would not have been a bright, high-spirited youth
of seventeen years had he not been stirred by the curious communication
that had been delivered so oddly to him. He speculated and theorized,
and the more he did so the more he was puzzled.</p>

<p>"Some folks like to be mysterious," he said, "and the less cause
they have for being so the more secret they are. Why didn’t ‘S.
P.’, whoever he is, drop me a word, which he could have done without
it being noticed by any one else?</p>

<p>"It must have been there was another person in the room that
he was afraid would become suspicious, but I have no idea who
he was. It is odd that this fellow is the only one who interested
me.</p>

<p>"What can his business be with me? I was never in this part of
the world before and haven’t had anything to do with the people
here, nor anywhere in the neighborhood, except those young men
this forenoon. It can’t have any relation to them, for they have
not had time to reach Chesterton since our run-in."</p>

<p>"How about Professor Morgan?" Harvey asked himself with a start.
"I know he is in town and didn’t show any pleasure when I recognized
him. Can it be that he and ‘S. P.’ have anything between them
in which I am concerned?"</p>

<p>He sat for a long time turning over the perplexing subject in
his mind, with the only result of becoming more befogged.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! what’s the use?" he exclaimed impatiently, as he came
to his feet and donned his cap; "it is nearly night and I have
to wait but a few hours, when he will make everything clear. So
here goes."</p>

<p>He locked his door behind him and started down the long hall.
At the head of the stairs, whom should he meet but the alert looking
man in gray? Harvey was about to suggest that they return to his
room together and have their conference, but the other did not
seem to see him; and recalling the warning, the youth passed down
the steps as if he had encountered an utter stranger. The latter
did not show up at the supper table and Harvey was relieved, for
it would have been some embarrassment to him. It may have been
the man’s knowledge of this fact that caused him to keep out of
the way.</p>

<p>Time passed slowly. When Harvey looked at his watch and saw that
it lacked fifteen minutes of the time appointed, he started for
his room. Bohunkus had already gone up stairs. When he bade his
friend good night, he said to him:</p>

<p>"I need sleep, Bunk, so stay in your room till I call you in
the morning."</p>

<p>"All right; I hain’t no ’bjection; I sha’n’t get up till yo’
bang on my door." </p>
