A FOX and a Monkey were traveling together on the same road.  As
they journeyed, they passed through a cemetery full of monuments. 
"All these monuments which you see," said the Monkey, "are
erected in honor of my ancestors, who were in their day freedmen
and citizens of great renown."  The Fox replied, "You have chosen
a most appropriate subject for your falsehoods, as I am sure none
of your ancestors will be able to contradict you."  
 
A false tale often betrays itself.
