<p>The lovelight shone in the eyes of Lieutenant Russell, as he
looked down at the slight figure beside him. He tenderly passed
his arm around the girl and touched his lips to her forehead.</p>

<p>"It was not that I doubted you, Nellie," he said, "but that Vose
might know the full truth."</p>

<p>Then turning to the guide, he asked:</p>

<p>"Do you still advise her to leave me?"</p>

<p>Vose Adams was unaccustomed to scenes like this. He moved about
uneasily, coughed, cleared his throat, and for a few minutes was
at a loss for words.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to advise," he finally said; "but don't you
think, if she could go to the captain and let him see how she
feels, he will give in? How would it do for both of you to walk
back with your arms round each other's neck and sayin' sweet words&mdash;wouldn't
that fetch him? Hanged, if I know what to tell you!" he exclaimed
desperately, observing the smiles on their faces.</p>

<p>"I am afraid your plan wouldn't work," said the lieutenant, "but
you have proved yourself the very friend we need."</p>

<p>These words were a hint of the scheme that had come into the
brain of the young officer. Had he made a prisoner of Vose Adams,
as he thought for a minute of doing, the guide would really be
more dangerous, since there was no way of guarding against his
treachery, but if he could be turned into a friend, it would be
almost equivalent to saving the fugitives. It was that for which
the young man planned, but he felt that the real work must be
done by Nellie. He could not win the good will of Vose, but she
could, for who was able to resist her appeals?</p>

<p>It was a proof of the brightness of the girl that she caught
the purpose of her escort the moment his last words were uttered,
and she performed her part with a cleverness that could not have
been surpassed.</p>

<p>Tears were in the eyes of the emotional Nellie, but she stepped
across the brief intervening space and laid her hand on the arm
of Adams.</p>

<p>"How glad I am, Vose, that you will help us, for you have told
enough to show that it will not do for us to meet father for some
time to come; we are now in your hands."</p>

<p>"Blamed if I won't do anything I can! But what can <em>I</em>
do? 'Spose I sneak back, shoot the captain and then plug Ruggles
and the parson? Will that suit you?"</p>

<p>"Gracious; I should rather you would kill me than harm a hair
of father's head."</p>

<p>"Wal, 'spose I shoot you and the leftenant and the captain and
the rest? No; that won't do; how the mischief shall I fix things?"</p>

<p>The cooler headed Russell saw that the problem had been solved;
Nellie Dawson had won over Vose Adams, as may be said, by the
turn of her finger. He was eager to do all he could to help them,
but in the flurry of the moment could not reason with his usual
acumen.</p>

<p>"We don't want any shooting, Vose; I am sure that if we can reach
Sacramento without meeting the captain, his anger will pass away.
In Sacramento, I shall be able to arrange a meeting between him
and his daughter, and his love for her will break down the barriers
and do the rest."</p>

<p>"I'm in too deep water when you get to figgerin' that way, but
there seems to be reason in what you say, but what about Ruggles
and the parson?"</p>

<p>"We'll leave them out; they are in this as the friends of Captain
Dawson, and will not dare go contrary to his wishes, but if they
do, it can make no difference to my plan."</p>

<p>"They're just as savage as the captain," said Vose significantly;
"and it won't do to forget 'em; but what did you expect to do,
when you left the kenyon? If you come back, you would have been
sartin to meet us, and what then?"</p>

<p>"My intention was not to return, but to keep away from the main
trail and hunt a shorter road through the mountains to Sacramento."</p>

<p>Vose Adams gave a low whistle of astonishment.</p>

<p>"That's the worst I ever heard!"</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"You're not follerin' any trail at all; you would be sartin to
get lost and would never find your way through the mountains;
anyhow it would take you three or four years, which I ca'clate
is longer than you want to wait."</p>

<p>"How can you be so positive?"</p>

<p>"It's true I never went to Sacramento and back, except by follerin'
for most of the way the trail that I know so well, but other folks
as smart as you have been lost in the mountains and you couldn't
help it."</p>

<p>"You advise against it then?"</p>

<p>"I'm so sure of your goin' wrong that I won't try to help you
unless you give up the idee."</p>

<p>"Then I hereby give it up."</p>

<p>Since Vose Adams had committed himself to Russell and Nellie's
interests, there was no more talking at cross purposes. The object
of the three was the same, and they sat down on the rocks for
consultation. There was abundance of time in which to do this,
since those whom they feared would not leave the cañon until the
return of their guide, and he did not mean to go back until the
day was so far spent that further delay was unavoidable.</p>

<p>"They will be mad when they see me," he said with a grin, "but
it won't do them any good and I'll fix up a yarn about gettin'
on and then off your trail agin, that they'll have to be satisfied
with."</p>

<p>"That will serve for to-night, but you will all be astir at an
early hour to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"They will still have to depend on me to guide 'em, and I rather
think I can steer 'em off the track, so as to give you plenty
of time to get out of the way."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"As soon as they leave the kenyon, that is as soon as the way
is clear, you must ride back to it and put on all steam for Sacramento,
for I understand, leftenant, that you've give up your idee of
finding a new route through the mountains."</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"You've got two good animals and you'll gain a full day's start."</p>

<p>"You forget about poor Cap," said Nellie.</p>

<p>"So I did! if he can't go with you, you'll have to leave him
behind and ride double, but it will be rather tough on your horse,
leftenant."</p>

<p>"Nellie doesn't weigh enough to make any difference, and I expect
to walk most of the distance."</p>

<p>An unexpected piece of good fortune raised the spirits of the
three. To the amazement of all, Cap, the pony, was seen hunting
for grass and bearing upon the lame foot with little inconvenience.
That which was thought to be a bad sprain was only a wrench, from
which he promised speedily to recover.</p>

<p>"He'll be as well as ever by to-morrow mornin'," said Vose Adams;
"you'll need to humor him at first, but not for long."</p>

<p>As has been intimated, the guide remained with them through most
of the afternoon, for, if he had gone back to his friends earlier
than he did, he would not have dared to offer any excuse for not
leading them in the pursuit, and he meant to avert all possibility
of that. The reader understands by this time why the guide formulated
such an astounding fiction when attempting to explain the cause
of his delay. Had his listeners been in cooler mood, they might
have tangled him up with a few questions, but their exasperation
and disgust prevented.</p>

<p>Before parting with the fugitives, Vose assured them that he
was confident their plans could not fail.</p>

<p>"All they've got to do," he reflected, "is to do nothing afore
to-morrow and then when the road is open, strike out over the
main trail as hard as they can travel. I hope none of them Injins
that we had the row with will be pokin' 'round to-night, for if
there's to be any trouble, it'll come from them."</p>

<p>It will be recalled that the story of Adams was received with
such coolness that he indignantly resigned and told the captain
to run matters himself.</p>

<p>"And he'll make purty work of it," chortled Vose "he won't be
able to come within miles of where they are hidin'."</p>

<p>When the moody silence had lasted for some time, the guide was
moved to remark in a more conciliatory spirit:</p>

<p>"There's one thing that mustn't be forgot: Colonel Briggs and
his folks won't make any trouble, but we're not done with them
Injins."</p>

<p>"Isn't there likelihood that Colonel Briggs will divert them?"
asked the parson.</p>

<p>"No; for the redskins can't be fooled; they'll know it wasn't
any of the colonel's folks that give their chief his walkin' papers,
but us, and they're the sort of people that don't forget a thing
of that kind."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of hunting up enough wood to start a fire," said
the captain; "but we don't need it, and I suppose it will be safer
without it."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," observed Ruggles, "that what we've got the
most to fear is that the Injins will run off with our animals:
we would be left in a bad fix."</p>

<p>"We must look out for that; I'll stand guard the first part of
the night."</p>

<p>Each was ready to take his turn, and it was arranged that Captain
Dawson should act as sentinel until midnight, when he would awake
Vose Adams, who would assume the duty till morning. Soon afterward,
the three wrapped themselves in their blankets and stretched out
on the ground, near the boulders, where they speedily sank into
deep slumber.</p>

<p>It seemed to Adams that he had slept less than an hour, when
the captain touched him. Rising immediately to a sitting position,
he asked:</p>

<p>"Is it midnight?"</p>

<p>"It's a half hour past."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you awake me afore? Have you seen anything wrong?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure; my doubt made me hold on a little longer, but
I learned nothing of account."</p>

<p>"What was it anyway?"</p>

<p>"It is only that the animals appear to be uneasy, but it may
mean nothing, or it may mean a good deal."</p>

<p>"It's more'n likely it means something. Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Lying down off there to the right, almost near enough to be
seen."</p>

<p>"They can't be too close; wal, you can sleep and I'll take my
turn."</p>

<p>Thus warned by Captain Dawson, Vose Adams assumed the duties
of sentinel with his senses on the alert. He had become so accustomed
to the delicate duty, when aware that the slightest slip on his
part meant death, that he was better fitted for the task than
any member of the party, though the experience of Ruggles and
the captain in the army had given them the ability to awake at
any moment fixed upon before sinking into slumber, and they were
sensitive to the least disturbance while enjoying refreshing rest.</p>

<p>Adams believed what he had remarked more than once that the little
company of mountain Indians would do their utmost to revenge themselves
upon the men who had taken off their chief. He suspected that
the five were prowling in the neighborhood, looking for some such
opportunity, and that they would strike a blow before the rising
of the morrow's sun.</p>

<p>Nothing was to be hoped for in the way of a diversion, created
by the intrusion of Colonel Briggs and his vagrant miners. Not
that the Indians were not eager to strike at any members of the
hated race, but the all-controlling motive was lacking in the
case of the larger party.</p>

<p>Although the moon was in the sky, only a small part of its light
penetrated the cañon. Peering into the darkness, Vose dimly made
out the forms of the four animals, who, having ceased their cropping
of the grass, had lain down for the remainder of the night. They
were so near that they could not be stampeded or stolen without
the effort being known to the sentinel.</p>

<p>It would have been the height of rashness to start a camp fire,
for all the figures within its circle of illumination must have
formed the best of targets for their stealthy foes. As it was,
an enemy would have to steal from the gloom and approach near
enough to touch them, before striking a blow or firing a shot.</p>

<p>Vose Adams, with his Winchester in his right hand and held close
to his side, took his seat on the ground, resting his back against
the nearest boulder. As a rule, a sentinel can keep awake for
an extended time only by motion and exercise, such as walking
to and fro, but the trained hunter often takes the risk and there
is little danger of his succumbing, especially after he has just
finished a nap, as was the case with the guide.</p>

<p>Thus seated, with the boulder rising several feet above his head,
Adams's only reliance was upon his keenness of hearing and sight.</p>

<p>He had not waited long when he saw proof of what the captain
had told him: the animals were restless, or rather one of them
was. The quadruped thus affected was Hercules, his own mule, who,
although lying down, twice rose to his feet, shifted his position
and lay down again. Then he sniffed as if the air contained an
odor that was displeasing to him.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't think much of it, if it was one of the horses," reflected
his master, "but Hercules has brains; he knows more'n all the
others together, and yet it may be it ain't that after all."</p>

<p>One of the singular facts regarding cattle and other quadrupeds
is that they are sometimes troubled with disquieting dreams, the
same as ourselves. This trifling cause has resulted many a time
in the stampeding of a drove numbering tens of thousands.</p>

<p>"I've knowed Hercules to kick and snort in his sleep, and one
time he come mighty near breakin' a leg of mine; howsumever, I
don't think that's the trouble with him to-night. I 'spect it's
Injins this time!"</p>

<p>When Captain Dawson lay down to sleep and Vose Adams assumed
his place as sentinel, the moon was near the zenith, but the contour
of the cañon shut out its beams. While Vose was striving to pierce
the gloom, over and about the four animals, he noted a flickering
tremor against the vast wall which formed the other side of the
cañon. A faint, fleecy veil of moonlight having been lifted over
the mountain crests, was now flung downward and caught against
and suspended upon the projecting rocks and crags. It was but
a frosty shimmer, but the veil dangled lower and lower, pendant
here and there until the fringe rested on the bottom of the gorge.</p>

<p>The sleeping miners and horses were wrapped in deep shadow, but
the tremulous, almost invisible veil still fluttered on the further
side of the cañon. By and by, the shifting moon would whisk it
up again and all would be gloom as before.</p>

<p>The sentinel lay flat on his face and peered over the prone animals
toward the faint light across the cañon, and, looking thus, he
saw the outlines of a man moving among the horses and mule. A
shadow could not have been more noiseless. Not the faintest rustle
betrayed his footsteps.</p>

<p>"Just what I expected," thought Vose; "I'll wager Hercules against
a dozen of the best horses in Sacramento that that shadder is
one of them five Injins we seen stealin' along the ledge this
mornin'. All the same, I can't imagine what the mischief he is
driving at."</p>

<p>The guide's first impulse was to bring his rifle to his shoulder
and let fly. The intruder was so near that it was impossible to
miss him, but two causes operated to prevent this summary course:
Vose wished first to learn the business of the intruder, and there
was a single possibility in a hundred that he was neither an Indian
nor an enemy.</p>

<p>The latter doubt could be solved by challenging the prowler with
a threat to fire, if instant satisfaction was refused, while the
firing could be made so promptly that the stranger would have
no chance of whisking out of reach. Vose decided to wait until
he got some idea of the other's business.</p>

<p>He could still dimly discern the form, but it was so obscure
that had it not been moving about, he would not have been able
to distinguish it or make sure it was within his field of vision.</p>

<p>While studying the phantom, the lower part of the veil of moonlight
on the other side of the cañon was twitched up for a hundred feet.
Lingering thus a minute, it was twitched still higher; then a
third flirt snatched it out of the gorge. The shifting of the
moon had left the cañon shrouded in darkness as before.</p>

<p>Nothing could have attested more strikingly the marvelous stealth
of the intruder than the fact that not one of the horses was awakened
by him. The approach of the great Geronimo and several of his
Apaches was betrayed under somewhat similar circumstances by the
neighing of a horse that they awakened, apparently when making
no noise at all.</p>

<p>This prowler was a shadow in a world of shadows. If Hercules
detected his presence, the man succeeded in soothing the fear
of the hybrid.</p>

<p>"<em>Halt or I'll fire!</em>"</p>

<p>Vose Adams's voice was low, but in the tomb-like stillness a
thunderclap could not have been more distinct. The hail, however,
produced no response. The angered Vose drew his Winchester to
a level, with his finger on the trigger, but when he ran his eye
along the barrel, he failed to perceive any target. He lowered
the muzzle a few inches and peered over the top. Nothing was discernible.</p>

<p>"You're there somewhere and I'll find you!"</p>

<p>Instead of rising erect, the sentinel advanced in a crouching
posture, so that his head was no higher than if he were on his
hands and knees.</p>

<p>This clever strategy was thrown away. Within five seconds, he
was at the side of Hercules, prepared and expecting to grapple
with his enemy, who, to his exasperation, continued invisible.
Vose did not require to have the matter explained to him, for
he understood it. Upon being hailed, the intruder instead of throwing
up his hands or starting to run, had also assumed a stooping position.
It was as if he had quietly sunk below the surface of a sea of
darkness through which he was wading, and swum with noiseless
celerity to a point beyond reach.</p>

<p>Vose was angered but took his defeat philosophically.</p>

<p>"You was too smart for me that time; I never had it played finer
on me, but I guess it's just as well; you've learned that we're
on the lookout and you can't sneak into camp without <em>some</em>
risk of having a hole bored inter you."</p>

<p>But Vose was not yet through with his nocturnal experiences.
He held his seat for some fifteen or twenty minutes without seeing
or hearing anything to cause the slightest misgiving. The horses
still slept, and even the uneasy Hercules appeared to have become
composed and to have made up his mind to slumber until morning.</p>

<p>"I don't b'leve there'll be anything more to disturb me, onless
some wild animal wants his supper&#11834;"</p>

<p>The thought had hardly taken shape, when a shiver of affright
ran through him, though the cause was so slight that it might
have brought a smile, being nothing more than a pebble rolling
down the ravine, up which the fugitives had passed the day before.
The stone came slowly, loosening several similar obstructions,
which joined with it, the rustling increasing and continuing until
all reached the bottom and lay at rest a few feet from where he
sat.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been easier than for this to occur in the
natural course of things, since hundreds of such instances were
taking place at every hour of the day and night, but in the tense
state of the sentinel's nerves, he was inclined to attribute it
either to the Indian that had just visited camp and slunk away,
or to one of his comrades trying to steal a march upon him.</p>

<p>"I 'spose the next thing will be for him to climb over this boulder
behind me and drop onto my head. Howsumever, if he does, he'll
find me awake."</p>

<p>Vose sat thus, depending almost wholly upon his sense of hearing
to apprise him of the stealthy approach of an enemy, while the
long silent hours gradually passed, without bringing additional
cause for alarm.</p>
