Who keeps a watch upon his toes<br/>
Need never fear he'll bump his nose.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Old Granny Fox.

<p>Now there is nothing like being shut in alone in the dark to
make one think. A voice inside of Reddy began to whisper to him.
"If you hadn't tried to be smart and show off you wouldn't have
brought all this trouble on yourself and Old Granny Fox," said
the voice.</p>

<p>"I know it," replied Reddy right out loud, forgetting that it
was only a small voice inside of him.</p>

<p>"What do you know?" asked Prickly Porky. He was still keeping
Reddy in and Granny out and he had overheard what Reddy said.</p>

<p>"It is none of your business!" snapped Reddy.</p>

<p>Reddy could hear Prickly Porky chuckle. Then Prickly Porky repeated
as if to himself in a queer cracked voice the following:</p>

<p> "Rudeness never, never pays,   Nor is there gain in saucy ways.  
It's always best to be polite   And ne'er give way to ugly spite.  
If that's the way you feel inside   You'd better all such feelings
hide;   For he must smile who hopes to win,   And he who loses
best will grin."</p>

<p>Reddy pretended that he hadn't heard. Prickly Porky continued
to chuckle for a while and finally Reddy fell asleep. When he
awoke it was to find that Prickly Porky had left and old Granny
Fox had brought him something to eat.</p>

<p>Just as soon as Reddy Fox was able to travel he and Granny had
moved to the Old Pasture. The Old Pasture is very different from
the Green Meadows or the Green Forest. Yes, indeed, it is very,
very different. Reddy Fox thought so. And Reddy didn't like the
change,&mdash;not a bit. All about were great rocks, and around and
over them grew bushes and young trees and bull-briars with long
ugly thorns, and blackberry and raspberry canes that seemed to
have a million little hooked hands, reaching to catch in and tear
his red coat and to scratch his face and hands. There were little
open places where wild-eyed young cattle fed on the short grass.
They had made many little paths all crisscross among the bushes,
and when you tried to follow one of these paths you never could
tell where you were coming out.</p>

<p>No, Reddy Fox did not like the Old Pasture at all. There was
no long, soft green grass to lie down in. And it was lonesome
up there. He missed the little people of the Green Meadows and
the Green Forest. There was no one to bully and tease. And it
was such a long, long way from Farmer Brown's henyard that old
Granny Fox wouldn't even try to bring him a fat hen. At least,
that's what she told Reddy.</p>

<p>The truth is, wise old Granny Fox knew that the very best thing
she could do was to stay away from Farmer Brown's for a long time.
She knew that Reddy couldn't go down there, because he was still
too lame and sore to travel such a long way, and she hoped that
by the time Reddy was well enough to go, he would have learned
better than to do such a foolish thing as to try to show off by
stealing a chicken in broad daylight, as he had when he brought
all this trouble on them.</p>

<p>Down on the Green Meadows, the home of Granny and Reddy Fox had
been on a little knoll, which you know is a little low hill, right
where they could sit on their doorstep and look all over the Green
Meadows. It had been very, very beautiful down there. They had
made lovely little paths through the tall green meadow grass,
and the buttercups and daisies had grown close up to their very
doorstep. But up here in the Old Pasture Granny Fox had chosen
the thickest clump of bushes and young trees she could find, and
in the middle was a great pile of rocks. Way in among these rocks
Granny Fox had dug their new house. It was right down under the
rocks. Even in the middle of the day jolly, round, red Mr. Sun
could hardly find it with a few of his long, bright beams. All
the rest of the time it was dark and gloomy there.</p>

<p>No, Reddy Fox didn't like his new home at all, but when he said
so old Granny Fox boxed his ears.</p>

<p>"It's your own fault that we've got to live here now," said she.
"It's the only place where we are safe. Farmer Brown's boy never
will find this home, and even if he did he couldn't dig into it
as he did into our old home on the Green Meadows. Here we are,
and here we've got to stay, all because a foolish little Fox thought
himself smarter than anybody else and tried to show off."</p>

<p>Reddy hung his head. "I don't care!" he said, which was very,
very foolish, because, you know, he did care a very great deal.</p>

<p>And here we will leave wise Old Granny Fox and Reddy, safe, even
if they do not like their new home. You see, Lightfoot the Deer
is getting jealous. He thinks there should be some books about
the people of the Green Forest, and that the first one should
be about him. And because we all love Lightfoot the Deer, the
very next book is to bear his name.</p>
