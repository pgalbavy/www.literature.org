<p>Miss Apperthwaite was at home the following Saturday. I found
her in the library with Les Miserables on her knee when I came
down from my room a little before lunch-time; and she looked up
and gave me a smile that made me feel sorry for any one she had
ceased to smile upon.</p>

<p>"I wanted to tell you," I said, with a little awkwardness but
plenty of truth, "I've found out that I'm an awful fool."</p>

<p>"But that's something," she returned, encouragingly&mdash;"at least
the beginning of wisdom."</p>

<p>"I mean about Mr. Beasley&mdash;the mystery I was absurd enough to
find in 'Simpledoria.' I want to tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>I</em> know," she said; and although she laughed with
an effect of carelessness, that look which I had thought "far
away" returned to her eyes as she spoke. There was a certain inscrutability
about Miss Apperthwaite sometimes, it should be added, as if she
did not like to be too easily read. "I've heard all about it.
Mr. Beasley's been appointed trustee or something for poor Hamilton
Swift's son, a pitiful little invalid boy who invents all sorts
of characters. The old darky from over there told our cook about
Bill Hammersley and Simpledoria. So, you see, I understand."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you do," I said.</p>

<p>A little hardness&mdash;one might even have thought it bitterness&mdash;became
apparent in her expression. "And I'm glad there's SOMEbody in
that house, at last, with a little imagination!"</p>

<p>"From everything I have heard," I returned, summoning sufficient
boldness, "it would be difficult to say which has more &mdash;Mr.
Beasley or the child."</p>

<p>Her glance fell from mine at this, but not quickly enough to
conceal a sudden, half-startled look of trouble (I can think of
no other way to express it) that leaped into it; and she rose,
for the lunch-bell was ringing.</p>

<p>"I'm just finishing the death of Jean Valjean, you know, in Les
Miserables," she said, as we moved to the door. "I'm always afraid
I'll cry over that. I try not to, because it makes my eyes red."</p>

<p>And, in truth, there was a vague rumor of tears about her eyes&mdash;not
as if she had shed them, but more as if she were going to&mdash;though
I had not noticed it when I came in.</p>

<p>... That afternoon, when I reached the "Despatch" office, I was
commissioned to obtain certain political information from the
Honorable David Beasley, an assignment I accepted with eagerness,
notwithstanding the commiseration it brought me from one or two
of my fellows in the reporter's room. "You won't get anything
out of <em>HIM!" </em>they said. And they were true prophets.</p>

<p>I found him looking over some documents in his office; a reflective,
unlighted cigar in the corner of his mouth; his chair tilted back
and his feet on a window-sill. He nodded, upon my statement of
the affair that brought me, and, without shifting his position,
gave me a look of slow but wholly friendly scrutiny over his shoulder,
and bade me sit down. I began at once to put the questions I was
told to ask him&mdash;interrogations (he seemed to believe) satisfactorily
answered by slowly and ruminatively stroking the left side of
his chin with two long fingers of his right hand, the while he
smiled in genial contemplation of a tarred roof beyond the window.
Now and then he would give me a mild and drawling word or two,
not brilliantly illuminative, it may be remarked. "Well&mdash;about
that&mdash;" he began once, and came immediately to a full stop.</p>

<p>"Yes?" I said, hopefully, my pencil poised.</p>

<p>"About that &mdash;I guess&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Beasley?" I encouraged him, for he seemed to have dried
up permanently.</p>

<p>"Well, sir&mdash;I guess &mdash;Hadn't you better see some one else
about <em>THAT</em>?"</p>

<p>This with the air of a man who would be but too fluent and copious
upon any subject in the world except the one particular point.</p>

<p>I never met anybody else who looked so pleasantly communicative
and managed to say so little. In fact, he didn't say anything
at all; and I guessed that this faculty was not without its value
in his political career, disastrous as it had proved to his private
happiness. His habit of silence, moreover, was not cultivated:
you could see that "the secret of it" was just that he was <em>BORN
</em>quiet.</p>

<p>My note-book remained noteless, and finally, at some odd evasion
of his, accomplished by a monosyllable, I laughed outright&mdash;and
he did, too! He joined cachinnations with me heartily, and with
a twinkling quizzicalness that somehow gave me the idea that he
might be thinking (rather apologetically) to himself: "Yes, sir,
that old Beasley man is certainly a mighty funny critter!"</p>

<p>When I went away, a few moments later, and left him still intermittently
chuckling, the impression remained with me that he had had some
such deprecatory and surreptitious thought.</p>

<p>Two or three days after that, as I started down-town from Mrs.
Apperthwaite's, Beasley came out of his gate, bound in the same
direction. He gave me a look of gay recognition and offered his
hand, saying, "<em>WELL! </em>Up in <em>THIS </em>neighborhood!"
as if that were a matter of considerable astonishment.</p>

<p>I mentioned that I was a neighbor, and we walked on together.
I don't think he spoke again, except for a "Well, sir!" or two
of genial surprise at something I said, and, now and then, "You
don't tell me!"  which he had a most eloquent way of exclaiming;
but he listened visibly to my own talk, and laughed at everything
that I meant for funny.</p>

<p>I never knew anybody who gave one a greater responsiveness; he
seemed to be <em>WITH </em>you every instant; and <em>HOW </em>he
made you feel it was the true mystery of Beasley, this silent
man who never talked, except (as my cousin said) to children.</p>

<p>It happened that I thus met him, as we were both starting down-town,
and walked on with him, several days in succession; in a word,
it became a habit. Then, one afternoon, as I turned to leave him
at the "Despatch"  office, he asked me if I wouldn't drop in at
his house the next day for a cigar before we started. I did; and
he asked me if I wouldn't come again the day after that. So this
became a habit, too.</p>

<p>A fortnight elapsed before I met Hamilton Swift, Junior; for
he, poor little father of dream-children, could be no spectator
of track events upon the lawn, but lay in his bed up-stairs. However,
he grew better at last, and my presentation took place.</p>

<p>We had just finished our cigars in Beasley's airy, old-fashioned
"sitting-room," and were rising to go, when there came the faint
creaking of small wheels from the hall. Beasley turned to me with
the apologetic and monosyllabic chuckle that was distinctly his
alone.</p>

<p>"I've got a little chap here&mdash;" he said; then went to the door.
"Bob!"</p>

<p>The old darky appeared in the doorway pushing a little wagon
like a reclining-chair on wheels, and in it sat Hamilton Swift,
Junior.</p>

<p>My first impression of him was that he was all eyes: I couldn't
look at anything else for a time, and was hardly conscious of
the rest of that weazened, peaked little face and the under-sized
wisp of a body with its pathetic adjuncts of metal and leather.
I think they were the brightest eyes I ever saw&mdash;as keen and intelligent
as a wicked old woman's, withal as trustful and cheery as the
eyes of a setter pup.</p>

<p>"<em>HOO-</em>ray!"</p>

<p>Thus the Honorable Mr. Beasley, waving a handkerchief thrice
around his head and thrice cheering.</p>

<p>And the child, in that cricket's voice of his, replied:</p>

<p>"Br-r-ra-vo!"</p>

<p>This was the form of salutation familiarly in use between them.
Beasley followed it by inquiring, "Who's with us to-day?"</p>

<p>"I'm <em>MISTER </em>Swift," chirped the little fellow. "<em>MIS-TER
</em>Swift, if you please, Cousin David Beasley."</p>

<p>Beasley executed a formal bow. "There is a gentleman here who'd
like to meet you." And he presented me with some grave phrases
commendatory of my general character, addressing the child as
"Mister Swift"; whereupon Mister Swift gave me a ghostly little
hand and professed himself glad to meet me.</p>

<p>"And besides me," he added, to Beasley, "there's Bill Hammersley
and Mr. Corley Linbridge."</p>

<p>A faint perplexity manifested itself upon Beasley's face at this,
a shadow which cleared at once when I asked if I might not be
permitted to meet these personages, remarking that I had heard
from Dowden of Bill Hammersley, though until now a stranger to
the fame of Mr. Corley Linbridge.</p>

<p>Beasley performed the ceremony with intentional elegance, while
the boy's great eyes swept glowingly from his cousin's face to
mine and back again. I bowed and shook hands with the air, once
to my left and once to my right. "And Simpledoria!" cried Mister
Swift. "You'll enjoy Simpledoria."</p>

<p>"Above all things," I said. "Can he shake hands? Some dogs can."</p>

<p>"Watch him!"</p>

<p>Mister Swift lifted a commanding finger. "Simpledoria, shake
hands!"</p>

<p>I knelt beside the wagon and shook an imaginary big paw. At this
Mister Swift again shook hands with me and allowed me to perceive,
in his luminous regard, a solemn commendation and approval.</p>

<p>In this wise was my initiation into the beautiful old house and
the cordiality of its inmates completed; and I became a familiar
of David Beasley and his ward, with the privilege to go and come
as I pleased; there was always gay and friendly welcome. I always
came for the cigar after lunch, sometimes for lunch itself; sometimes
I dined there instead of down-town; and now and then when it happened
that an errand or assignment took me that way in the afternoon,
I would run in and "visit"  awhile with Hamilton Swift, Junior,
and his circle of friends.</p>

<p>There were days, of course, when his attacks were upon him, and
only Beasley and the doctor and old Bob saw him; I do not know
what the boy's mental condition was at such times; but when he
was better, and could be wheeled about the house and again receive
callers, he displayed an almost dismaying activity of mind&mdash;it
was active enough, certainly, to keep far ahead of my own. And
he was masterful: still, Beasley and Dowden and I were never directly
chidden for insubordination, though made to wince painfully by
the look of troubled surprise that met us when we were not quick
enough to catch his meaning.</p>

<p>The order of the day with him always began with the "<em>HOO-</em>ray"
and "<em>BR-R-RA-</em>vo" of greeting; after which we were to
inquire, "Who's with us to-day?" Whereupon he would make known
the character in which he elected to be received for the occasion.
If he announced himself as "Mister Swift," everything was to be
very grown-up and decorous indeed. Formalities and distances were
observed; and Mr. Corley Linbridge (an elderly personage of great
dignity and distinction as a mountain-climber) was much oftener
included in the conversation than Bill Hammersley. If, however,
he declared himself to be "Hamilton Swift, Junior," which was
his happiest mood, Bill Hammersley and Simpledoria were in the
ascendant, and there were games and contests. (Dowden, Beasley,
and I all slid down the banisters on one of the Hamilton Swift,
Junior, days, at which really picturesque spectacle the boy almost
cried with laughter&mdash;and old Bob and his wife, who came running
from the kitchen, <em>DID </em>cry.) He had a third appellation
for himself&mdash;"Just little Hamilton"; but this was only when the
creaky voice could hardly chirp at all and the weazened face was
drawn to one side with suffering. When he told us he was "Just
little Hamilton" we were very quiet.</p>

<p>Once, for ten days, his Invisibles all went away on a visit:
Hamilton Swift, Junior, had become interested in bears. While
this lasted, all of Beasley's trousers were, as Dowden said, "a
sight." For that matter, Dowden himself was quite hoarse in court
from growling so much. The bears were dismissed abruptly: Bill
Hammersley and Mr. Corley Linbridge and Simpledoria came trooping
back, and with them they brought that wonderful family, the Hunchbergs.</p>

<p>Beasley had just opened the front door, returning at noon from
his office, when Hamilton Swift, Junior's voice came piping from
the library, where he was reclining in his wagon by the window.</p>

<p>"Cousin David Beasley! Cousin David, come a-running!" he cried.
"Come a-running! The Hunchbergs are here!"</p>

<p>Of course Cousin David Beasley came a-running, and was immediately
introduced to the whole Hunchberg family, a ceremony which old
Bob, who was with the boy, had previously undergone with courtly
grace.</p>

<p>"They like Bob," explained Hamilton. "Don't you, Mr. Hunchberg?
Yes, he says they do extremely!" (He used such words as "extremely"
often; indeed, as Dowden said, he talked "like a child in a book,"
which was due, I dare say, to his English mother.) "And I'm sure,"
the boy went on, "that all the family will admire Cousin David.
Yes, Mr. Hunchberg says, he thinks they will."</p>

<p>And then (as Bob told me) he went almost out of his head with
joy when Beasley offered Mr. Hunchberg a cigar and struck a match
for him to light it.</p>

<p>"But <em>WHAR," </em>exclaimed the old darky, "whar in de name
o' de good Gawd do de chile git dem <em>NAMES? </em>Hit lak to
<em>SKEER </em>me!"</p>

<p>That was a subject often debated between Dowden and me: there
was nothing in Wainwright that could have suggested them, and
it did not seem probable he could have remembered them from over
the water. In my opinion they were the inventions of that busy
and lonely little brain.</p>

<p>I met the Hunchberg family, myself, the day after their arrival,
and Beasley, by that time, had become so well acquainted with
them that he could remember all their names, and helped in the
introductions. There was Mr. Hunchberg&mdash;evidently the child's
favorite, for he was described as the possessor of every engaging
virtue&mdash;and there was that lively matron, Mrs. Hunchberg; there
were the Hunchberg young gentlemen, Tom, Noble, and Grandee; and
the young ladies, Miss Queen, Miss Marble, and Miss Molanna&mdash;all
exceedingly gay and pretty. There was also Colonel Hunchberg,
an uncle; finally there was Aunt Cooley Hunchberg, a somewhat
decrepit but very amiable old lady. Mr. Corley Linbridge happened
to be calling at the same time; and, as it appeared to be Beasley's
duty to keep the conversation going and constantly to include
all of the party in its general flow, it struck me that he had
truly (as Dowden said) "enough to keep him busy."</p>

<p>The Hunchbergs had lately moved to Wainwright from Constantinople,
I learned; they had decided not to live in town, however, having
purchased a fine farm out in the country, and, on account of the
distance, were able to call at Beasley's only about eight times
a day, and seldom more than twice in the evening. Whenever a mystic
telephone announced that they were on the way, the child would
have himself wheeled to a window; and when they came in sight
he would cry out in wild delight, while Beasley hastened to open
the front door and admit them.</p>

<p>They were so real to the child, and Beasley treated them with
such consistent seriousness, that between the two of them I sometimes
began to feel that there actually were such people, and to have
moments of half-surprise that I couldn't see them; particularly
as each of the Hunchberg's developed a character entirely his
own to the last peculiarity, such as the aged Aunt Cooley Hunchberg's
deafness, on which account Beasley never once forgot to raise
his voice when he addressed her. Indeed, the details of actuality
in all this appeared to bring as great a delight to the man as
to the child. Certainly he built them up with infinite care. On
one occasion when Mr. Hunchberg and I happened to be calling,
Hamilton remarked with surprise that Simpledoria had come into
the room without licking his hand as he usually did, and had crept
under the table. Mr. Hunchberg volunteered the information (through
Beasley) that upon his approach to the house he had seen Simpledoria
chasing a cat. It was then debated whether chastisement was in
order, but finally decided that Simpledoria's surreptitious manner
of entrance and his hiding under the table were sufficient indication
that he well understood his baseness, and would never let it happen
again. And so, Beasley having coaxed him out from under the table,
the offender "sat up," begged, and was forgiven. I could almost
feel the splendid shaggy head under my hand when, in turn, I patted
Simpledoria to show that the reconciliation was unanimous.</p>
