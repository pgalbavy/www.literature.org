<p>The name of Vermont recalls the gallant "Green Mountain Boys,"
who proved their sturdy patriotism not only in the Revolution,
but before those stormy days broke over the land. In the colonial
times the section was known as the "New Hampshire Grants," and
was claimed by both New York and New Hampshire, but Vermont refused
to acknowledge the authority of either, even after New York, in
1764, secured a decision in her favor from King George, and set
vigorously to work to compel the settlers to pay a second time
for their lands. The doughty pioneers would have none of it, and
roughly handled the New York officers sent thither. In 1777 Vermont
formally declared her independence and adopted a State constitution.
Then, since the Revolution was on, Ethan Allen and the rest of
the "Green Mountain Boys" turned in and helped whip the redcoats.
That being done, Vermont again asserted her independence, compelled
New York to recognize it in 1789, and she was admitted to the
Union in 1791.</p>

<p>It was away back in 1633 that the first Englishman bearing the
name of Dewey arrived in Massachusetts with a number of other
emigrants. They settled in Dorchester, and in 1636 Thomas Dewey,
as he was named, removed to Windsor, Connecticut, where he died
in 1648, leaving a widow and five children. Following down the
family line, we come to the birth of Julius Yemans Dewey, August
22, 1801, at Berlin, Vermont. He studied medicine, practiced his
profession at Montpelier, the capital, and became one of the most
respected and widely known citizens of the State. He was married
three times, and by his first wife had three sons and one daughter.
The latter was Mary, and the sons were Charles, Edward, and George,
the last of whom became the famous Admiral of the American navy
and the hero of the late war between our country and Spain. He
was born in the old colonial house of Dr. Dewey, December 26,
1837.</p>

<p>George was a good specimen of the mischievous, high-spirited
and roystering youngster, who would go to any pains and run any
risk for the sake of the fun it afforded. This propensity was
carried to such an extent that the youth earned the name of being
a "bad boy," and there is no use of pretending he did not deserve
the reputation. He gave his parents and neighbors a good deal
of anxiety, and Dr. Dewey, who knew how to be stern as well as
kind, was compelled more than once to interpose his authority
in a way that no lad is likely to forget.</p>

<p>Dr. Dewey was a man of deep religious convictions. In middle
life he gave up the practice of medicine and founded the National
Life Insurance Company, to whose interests he devoted his time
and ability, and met with a good degree of success. George was
gifted by nature with rugged health, high spirits and indomitable
pluck and fearlessness. None could surpass him in running, leaping,
swimming and in boyish sports. He was fond of fishing and of rough
games, and as a fighter few of his years could stand in front
of him. In numerous athletic trials he was invariably the victor,
and it must be admitted that he loved fighting as well as he liked
playing ball or fishing. He gave and received hard knocks, and
even at that early age showed evidence of the combative, aggressive
courage that became so marked a feature of his manhood.</p>

<p>An incident is related by <em>Z.K. </em>Pangborn, the well known
editor of New Jersey, who took charge of the Montpelier school,
in which George Dewey was a pupil. The school was notorious for
the roughness of a number of its pupils, who had ousted more than
one instructor and welcomed the chance to tackle a new one. Master
Dewey was the ringleader of these young rebels, and chuckled with
delight when the quiet-looking, ordinary-sized teacher sauntered
down the highway to begin his duties in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>At the time of the gentleman's appearance George was sitting
astride of a big limb in a tree at the side of the road, his pockets
bulging with stones, which he was hurling with unpleasant accuracy
at every one who came within range. Several youngsters were howling
from having served as targets to the urchin up the tree, and as
soon as Mr. Pangborn saw how things were going he shouted to Dewey
to stop his sport. The boy replied by advising the teacher to
go to the hottest region named in works on theology, and, descending
the tree, led several young scamps in an attack upon the instructor.
There was a lively brush, in which it cannot be said that either
party was the victor.</p>

<p>A drawn battle is always unsatisfactory to two armies, and George
determined to have it out in the schoolroom with the teacher,
who, expecting the struggle, had prepared for it and was as eager
as the boys for the fight. As before, Dewey was the leader in
the attack on the pedagogue, who was wiry, active, and strong.
He swung his rawhide with a vigor that made Dewey and the others
dance, but they pluckily kept up the assault, until the instructor
seized a big stick, intended to serve as fuel for the old-fashioned
stove, and laid about him with an energy that soon stretched the
rebels on the floor.</p>

<p>Then how he belabored them! As fast as one attempted to climb
to his feet he was thumped back again by the club that continually
whizzed through the air, and if a boy tried to stay the storm
by remaining prone, the instructor thumped him none the less viciously.
Indeed, matters had got to that point that he enjoyed the fun
and was loath to let up, as he felt obliged to do, when the howling
rebels slunk to their seats, thoroughly cowed and conquered.</p>

<p>George Dewey was the most battered of the lot and made a sorry
sight. In fact, he was so bruised that his teacher thought it
prudent to accompany him to his home and explain to his father
the particulars of the affray in school. Mr. Pangborn gave a detailed
history of the occurrence, to which Dr. Dewey listened gravely.
When he understood everything, he showed his good sense by thanking
the teacher for having administered the punishment, asking him
to repeat it whenever the conduct of his son made it necessary.</p>

<p>This chastisement marked a turning point in the boy's career.
He did a good deal of serious thinking throughout the day, and
saw and felt his wrongdoing. He became an attentive, obedient
pupil, and years after, when grown to manhood, he warmly thanked
Mr. Pangborn for having punished him with such severity, frankly
adding: "I believe if you hadn't done so I should have ended my
career in the penitentiary."</p>

<p>Dr. Dewey wished to give George a career in the army, and he
sent him to Norwich University, a military training school, in
order to fit him for the Military Academy at West Point. George's
tastes, however, were for the navy, and after much pleading with
his father he brought him to his way of thinking. The utmost that
Dr. Dewey could do was to secure the appointment of his son as
alternate, who, as may be understood, secures the appointment
only in the event of the principal failing to pass the entrance
examination. In this case the principal would have passed without
trouble, and, to quote an ordinary expression, George Dewey would
have been "left," had not the mother of the other boy interposed
at the critical moment. Under no circumstances would she allow
her son to enter the navy. He was compelled to give up all ambition
in that direction and to take up the study of theology. At this
writing he is a popular preacher, who will always believe it was
a most providential thing for our country that turned him aside
from blocking the entrance of George Dewey to the Naval Academy
at Annapolis.</p>

<p>Our hero entered the institution September 23, 1854. It did not
take him long to discover that the institution, like that at West
Point, is controlled by the most rigid discipline possible. No
stricter rules can be devised than those that prevail at the two
institutions. I have heard it said by a West Point graduate that
a cadet cannot sit down and breathe for twenty-four hours without
violating some rule. The fact that a few men do escape being "skinned"&mdash;that
is, punished for derelictions of duty&mdash;does not prove that they
have not committed any indiscretions, but that they have escaped
detection.</p>

<p>Hard, however, as was the road for Dewey to travel, he never
shrank or turned aside, for he knew the same path had been traveled
by all who had gone before him, and he reasoned that what man
had done man could do, and he did it.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the future Admiral entered the Naval Academy
at a stirring period in the history of our country, over which
the coming Civil War already cast its awful shadow, and, as the
months and years passed, the shadow darkened and grew more portentous
until the red lightning rent the clouds apart and they rained
blood and fire and woe and death.</p>

<p>At the Annapolis Academy the lines between the cadets from the
North and the South were sharply drawn. They reflected the passions
of their sections, and, being young and impulsive, there were
hot words and fierce blows. As might be supposed, George Dewey
was prominent in these affrays, for it has been said of him that
there was never a fight in his neighborhood without his getting
into the thickest of it.</p>

<p>One day a fiery Southerner called him a dough-face, whereupon
Dewey let go straight from the shoulder and his insulter turned
a backward somersault. Leaping to his feet, his face aflame with
rage, he went at the Green Mountain Boy, who coolly awaited his
attack, and they proceeded instantly to mix it up for some fifteen
minutes in the most lively manner conceivable. At the end of that
time the Southerner was so thoroughly trounced that he was unable
to continue the fight.</p>

<p>It was not long before Dewey had a furious scrimmage with another
cadet, whom he soundly whipped. He challenged Dewey to a duel,
and Dewey instantly accepted the challenge. Seconds were chosen,
weapons provided and the ground paced off. By that time the friends
of the two parties, seeing that one of the young men, and possibly
both, were certain to be killed, interfered, and, appealing to
the authorities of the institution, the deadly meeting was prevented.
These incidents attest the personal daring of Admiral Dewey, of
whom it has been said that he never showed fear of any living
man. Often during his stirring career was the attempt made to
frighten him, and few have been placed in so many situations of
peril and come out of them alive, but in none did he ever display
anything that could possibly be mistaken for timidity. He was
a brave man and a patriot in every fibre of his being.</p>

<p>A youth can be combative, personally brave and aggressive, and
still be a good student, as was proven by the graduation of Dewey,
fifth in a class of fourteen. As was the custom, he was ordered
to a cruise before his final examination. He was a cadet on the
steam frigate <em>Wabash</em>, which cruised in the Mediterranean
squadron until 1859, when he returned to Annapolis and, upon examination,
took rank as the leader of his class, proof that he had spent
his time wisely while on what may be called his trial cruise.
He went to his old home in Montpelier, where he was spending the
days with his friends, when the country was startled and electrified
by the news that Fort Sumter had been fired on in Charleston harbor
and that civil war had begun. Dewey's patriotic blood was at the
boiling point, and one week later, having been commissioned as
lieutenant and assigned to the sloop of war <em>Mississippi</em>,
he hurried thither to help in defence of the Union.</p>

<p>The <em>Mississippi</em> was a sidewheel steamer, carrying seventeen
guns, and was destined to a thrilling career in the stirring operations
of the West Gulf squadron, under the command of Captain David
Glasgow Farragut, the greatest naval hero produced by the Civil
War, and without a superior in all history.</p>
