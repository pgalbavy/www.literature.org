<p>Then there was a pause, and we stood there in the chilly silent darkness
waiting till the moment came to start. It was, perhaps, the most trying
time of all--that slow, slow quarter of an hour. The minutes seemed
to drag along with leaden feet, and the quiet, the solemn hush,
that brooded over all--big, as it were, with a coming fate, was most
oppressive to the spirits. I once remember having to get up before
dawn to see a man hanged, and I then went through a very similar set of
sensations, only in the present instance my feelings were animated by
that more vivid and personal element which naturally appertains rather
to the person to be operated on than to the most sympathetic spectator.
The solemn faces of the men, well aware that the short passage of
an hour would mean for some, and perhaps all of them, the last great
passage to the unknown or oblivion; the bated whispers in which they
spoke; even Sir Henry’s continuous and thoughtful examination of his
woodcutter’s axe and the fidgety way in which Good kept polishing his
eyeglass, all told the same tale of nerves stretched pretty nigh to
breaking-point. Only Umslopogaas, leaning as usual upon Inkosi-kaas and
taking an occasional pinch of snuff, was to all appearance perfectly and
completely unmoved. Nothing could touch his iron nerves.
</p>
<p>The moon went down. For a long while she had been getting nearer and
nearer to the horizon. Now she finally sank and left the world in
darkness save for a faint grey tinge in the eastern sky that palely
heralded the dawn.
</p><p>Mr Mackenzie stood, watch in hand, his wife clinging to his arm and
striving to stifle her sobs.
</p><p>‘Twenty minutes to four,’ he said, ‘it ought to be light enough to
attack at twenty minutes past four. Captain Good had better be moving,
he will want three or four minutes’ start.’
</p><p>Good gave one final polish to his eyeglass, nodded to us in a jocular
sort of way--which I could not help feeling it must have cost him
something to muster up--and, ever polite, took off his steel-lined cap
to Mrs Mackenzie and started for his position at the head of the kraal,
to reach which he had to make a detour by some paths known to the
natives.
</p><p>Just then one of the boys came in and reported that everybody in the
Masai camp, with the exception of the two sentries who were walking
up and down in front of the respective entrances, appeared to be fast
asleep. Then the rest of us took the road. First came the guide, then
Sir Henry, Umslopogaas, the Wakwafi Askari, and Mr Mackenzie’s
two mission natives armed with long spears and shields. I followed
immediately after with Alphonse and five natives all armed with guns,
and Mr Mackenzie brought up the rear with the six remaining natives.
</p><p>The cattle kraal where the Masai were camped lay at the foot of the
hill on which the house stood, or, roughly speaking, about eight hundred
yards from the Mission buildings. The first five hundred yards of this
distance we traversed quietly indeed, but at a good pace; after that we
crept forward as silently as a leopard on his prey, gliding like ghosts
from bush to bush and stone to stone. When I had gone a little way I
chanced to look behind me, and saw the redoubtable Alphonse staggering
along with white face and trembling knees, and his rifle, which was at
full cock, pointed directly at the small of my back. Having halted and
carefully put the rifle at ‘safety’, we started again, and all went well
till we were within one hundred yards or so of the kraal, when his teeth
began to chatter in the most aggressive way.
</p><p>‘If you don’t stop that I will kill you,’ I whispered savagely; for the
idea of having all our lives sacrificed to a tooth-chattering cook was
too much for me. I began to fear that he would betray us, and heartily
wished we had left him behind.
</p><p>‘But, monsieur, I cannot help it,’ he answered, ‘it is the cold.’
</p><p>Here was a dilemma, but fortunately I devised a plan. In the pocket of
the coat I had on was a small piece of dirty rag that I had used some
time before to clean a gun with. ‘Put this in your mouth,’ I whispered
again, giving him the rag; ‘and if I hear another sound you are a dead
man.’ I knew that that would stifle the clatter of his teeth. I must
have looked as if I meant what I said, for he instantly obeyed me, and
continued his journey in silence.
</p><p>Then we crept on again.
</p><p>At last we were within fifty yards of the kraal. Between us and it was
an open space of sloping grass with only one mimosa bush and a couple of
tussocks of a sort of thistle for cover. We were still hidden in fairly
thick bush. It was beginning to grow light. The stars had paled and a
sickly gleam played about the east and was reflected on the earth. We
could see the outline of the kraal clearly enough, and could also make
out the faint glimmer of the dying embers of the Masai camp-fires. We
halted and watched, for the sentry we knew was posted at the opening.
Presently he appeared, a fine tall fellow, walking idly up and down
within five paces of the thorn-stopped entrance. We had hoped to catch
him napping, but it was not to be. He seemed particularly wide awake. If
we could not kill that man, and kill him silently, we were lost. There
we crouched and watched him. Presently Umslopogaas, who was a few paces
ahead of me, turned and made a sign, and next second I saw him go
down on his stomach like a snake, and, taking an opportunity when
the sentry’s head was turned, begin to work his way through the grass
without a sound.
</p><p>The unconscious sentry commenced to hum a little tune, and Umslopogaas
crept on. He reached the shelter of the mimosa bush unperceived and
there waited. Still the sentry walked up and down. Presently he turned
and looked over the wall into the camp. Instantly the human snake who
was stalking him glided on ten yards and got behind one of the tussocks
of the thistle-like plant, reaching it as the Elmoran turned again. As
he did so his eye fell upon this patch of thistles, and it seemed to
strike him that it did not look quite right. He advanced a pace towards
it--halted, yawned, stooped down, picked up a little pebble and threw
it at it. It hit Umslopogaas upon the head, luckily not upon the armour
shirt. Had it done so the clink would have betrayed us. Luckily, too,
the shirt was browned and not bright steel, which would certainly have
been detected. Apparently satisfied that there was nothing wrong, he
then gave over his investigations and contented himself with leaning
on his spear and standing gazing idly at the tuft. For at least three
minutes did he stand thus, plunged apparently in a gentle reverie, and
there we lay in the last extremity of anxiety, expecting every moment
that we should be discovered or that some untoward accident would
happen. I could hear Alphonse’s teeth going like anything on the oiled
rag, and turning my head round made an awful face at him. But I am bound
to state that my own heart was at much the same game as the Frenchman’s
castanets, while the perspiration was pouring from my body, causing the
wash-leather-lined shirt to stick to me unpleasantly, and altogether I
was in the pitiable state known by schoolboys as a ‘blue fright’.
</p><p>At last the ordeal came to an end. The sentry glanced at the east, and
appeared to note with satisfaction that his period of duty was coming to
an end--as indeed it was, once and for all--for he rubbed his hands and
began to walk again briskly to warm himself.
</p><p>The moment his back was turned the long black snake glided on again, and
reached the other thistle tuft, which was within a couple of paces of
his return beat.
</p><p>Back came the sentry and strolled right past the tuft, utterly
unconscious of the presence that was crouching behind it. Had he looked
down he could scarcely have failed to see, but he did not do so.
</p><p>He passed, and then his hidden enemy erected himself, and with
outstretched hand followed in his tracks.
</p><p>A moment more, and, just as the Elmoran was about to turn, the great
Zulu made a spring, and in the growing light we could see his long lean
hands close round the Masai’s throat. Then followed a convulsive twining
of the two dark bodies, and in another second I saw the Masai’s head
bent back, and heard a sharp crack, something like that of a dry
twig snapping, and he fell down upon the ground, his limbs moving
spasmodically.
</p><p>Umslopogaas had put out all his iron strength and broken the warrior’s
neck.
</p><p>For a moment he knelt upon his victim, still gripping his throat till he
was sure that there was nothing more to fear from him, and then he rose
and beckoned to us to advance, which we did on all fours, like a colony
of huge apes. On reaching the kraal we saw that the Masai had still
further choked this entrance, which was about ten feet wide--no doubt in
order to guard against attack--by dragging four or five tops of mimosa
trees up to it. So much the better for us, I reflected; the more
obstruction there was the slower would they be able to come through.
Here we separated; Mackenzie and his party creeping up under the shadow
of the wall to the left, while Sir Henry and Umslopogaas took their
stations one on each side of the thorn fence, the two spearmen and the
Askari lying down in front of it. I and my men crept on up the right
side of the kraal, which was about fifty paces long.
</p><p>When I was two-thirds up I halted, and placed my men at distances of
four paces from one another, keeping Alphonse close to me, however. Then
I peeped for the first time over the wall. It was getting fairly light
now, and the first thing I saw was the white donkey, exactly opposite
to me, and close by it I could make out the pale face of little Flossie,
who was sitting as the lad had described, some ten paces from the wall.
Round her lay many warriors, sleeping. At distances all over the surface
of the kraal were the remains of fires, round each of which slept some
five-and-twenty Masai, for the most part gorged with food. Now and then
a man would raise himself, yawn, and look at the east, which was turning
primrose; but none got up. I determined to wait another five minutes,
both to allow the light to increase, so that we could make better
shooting, and to give Good and his party--of whom we could see or hear
nothing--every opportunity to make ready.
</p><p>The quiet dawn began to throw her ever-widening mantle over plain and
forest and river--mighty Kenia, wrapped in the silence of eternal snows,
looked out across the earth--till presently a beam from the unrisen sun
lit upon his heaven-kissing crest and purpled it with blood; the sky
above grew blue, and tender as a mother’s smile; a bird began to pipe
his morning song, and a little breeze passing through the bush shook
down the dewdrops in millions to refresh the waking world. Everywhere
was peace and the happiness of arising strength, everywhere save in the
heart of cruel man!
</p><p>Suddenly, just as I was nerving myself for the signal, having already
selected my man on whom I meant to open fire--a great fellow sprawling
on the ground within three feet of little Flossie--Alphonse’s teeth
began to chatter again like the hoofs of a galloping giraffe, making a
great noise in the silence. The rag had dropped out in the agitation of
his mind. Instantly a Masai within three paces of us woke, and, sitting
up, gazed about him, looking for the cause of the sound. Moved beyond
myself, I brought the butt-end of my rifle down on to the pit of the
Frenchman’s stomach. This stopped his chattering; but, as he doubled up,
he managed to let off his gun in such a manner that the bullet passed
within an inch of my head.
</p><p>There was no need for a signal now. From both sides of the kraal broke
out a waving line of fire, in which I myself joined, managing with a
snap shot to knock over my Masai by Flossie, just as he was jumping up.
Then from the top end of the kraal there rang an awful yell, in which
I rejoiced to recognize Good’s piercing notes rising clear and shrill
above the din, and in another second followed such a scene as I have
never seen before nor shall again. With an universal howl of terror and
fury the brawny crowd of savages within the kraal sprang to their feet,
many of them to fall again beneath our well-directed hail of lead before
they had moved a yard. For a moment they stood undecided, and then
hearing the cries and curses that rose unceasingly from the top end
of the kraal, and bewildered by the storm of bullets, they as by one
impulse rushed down towards the thorn-stopped entrance. As they went we
kept pouring our fire with terrible effect into the thickening mob as
fast as we could load. I had emptied my repeater of the ten shots it
contained and was just beginning to slip in some more when I bethought
me of little Flossie. Looking up, I saw that the white donkey was lying
kicking, having been knocked over either by one of our bullets or a
Masai spear-thrust. There were no living Masai near, but the black nurse
was on her feet and with a spear cutting the rope that bound Flossie’s
feet. Next second she ran to the wall of the kraal and began to climb
over it, an example which the little girl followed. But Flossie was
evidently very stiff and cramped, and could only go slowly, and as she
went two Masai flying down the kraal caught sight of her and rushed
towards her to kill her. The first fellow came up just as the poor
little girl, after a desperate effort to climb the wall, fell back into
the kraal. Up flashed the great spear, and as it did so a bullet from my
rifle found its home in the holder’s ribs, and over he went like a shot
rabbit. But behind him was the other man, and, alas, I had only that
one cartridge in the magazine! Flossie had scrambled to her feet and was
facing the second man, who was advancing with raised spear. I turned my
head aside and felt sick as death. I could not bear to see him stab her.
Glancing up again, to my surprise I saw the Masai’s spear lying on the
ground, while the man himself was staggering about with both hands to
his head. Suddenly I saw a puff of smoke proceeding apparently from
Flossie, and the man fell down headlong. Then I remembered the Derringer
pistol she carried, and saw that she had fired both barrels of it at
him, thereby saving her life. In another instant she had made an effort,
and assisted by the nurse, who was lying on the top, had scrambled over
the wall, and I knew that she was, comparatively speaking, safe.
</p><p>All this takes time to tell, but I do not suppose that it took more than
fifteen seconds to enact. I soon got the magazine of the repeater filled
again with cartridges, and once more opened fire, not on the seething
black mass which was gathering at the end of the kraal, but on fugitives
who bethought them to climb the wall. I picked off several of these men,
moving down towards the end of the kraal as I did so, and arriving at
the corner, or rather the bend of the oval, in time to see, and by means
of my rifle to assist in, the mighty struggle that took place there.
</p><p>By this time some two hundred Masai--allowing that we had up to the
present accounted for fifty--had gathered together in front of the
thorn-stopped entrance, driven thither by the spears of Good’s men,
whom they doubtless supposed were a large force instead of being but ten
strong. For some reason it never occurred to them to try and rush the
wall, which they could have scrambled over with comparative ease;
they all made for the fence, which was really a strongly interwoven
fortification. With a bound the first warrior went at it, and even
before he touched the ground on the other side I saw Sir Henry’s great
axe swing up and fall with awful force upon his feather head-piece, and
he sank into the middle of the thorns. Then with a yell and a crash they
began to break through as they might, and ever as they came the great
axe swung and Inkosi-kaas flashed and they fell dead one by one, each
man thus helping to build up a barrier against his fellows. Those who
escaped the axes of the pair fell at the hands of the Askari and the two
Mission Kaffirs, and those who passed scatheless from them were brought
low by my own and Mackenzie’s fire.
</p><p>Faster and more furious grew the fighting. Single Masai would spring
upon the dead bodies of their comrades, and engage one or other of the
axemen with their long spears; but, thanks chiefly to the mail shirts,
the result was always the same. Presently there was a great swing of the
axe, a crashing sound, and another dead Masai. That is, if the man was
engaged with Sir Henry. If it was Umslopogaas that he fought with the
result indeed would be the same, but it would be differently attained.
It was but rarely that the Zulu used the crashing double-handed
stroke; on the contrary, he did little more than tap continually at his
adversary’s head, pecking at it with the pole-axe end of the axe as a
woodpecker {Endnote 7} pecks at rotten wood. Presently a peck would go
home, and his enemy would drop down with a neat little circular hole
in his forehead or skull, exactly similar to that which a cheese-scoop
makes in a cheese. He never used the broad blade of the axe except when
hard pressed, or when striking at a shield. He told me afterwards that
he did not consider it sportsmanlike.
</p><p>Good and his men were quite close by now, and our people had to cease
firing into the mass for fear of killing some of them (as it was, one of
them was slain in this way). Mad and desperate with fear, the Masai by
a frantic effort burst through the thorn fence and piled-up dead, and,
sweeping Curtis, Umslopogaas, and the other three before them, into the
open. And now it was that we began to lose men fast. Down went our poor
Askari who was armed with the axe, a great spear standing out a foot
behind his back; and before long the two spearsmen who had stood with
him went down too, dying fighting like tigers; and others of our party
shared their fate. For a moment I feared the fight was lost--certainly
it trembled in the balance. I shouted to my men to cast down their
rifles, and to take spears and throw themselves into the melee. They
obeyed, their blood being now thoroughly up, and Mr Mackenzie’s people
followed their example.
</p><p>This move had a momentary good result, but still the fight hung in the
balance.
</p><p>Our people fought magnificently, hurling themselves upon the dark mass
of Elmoran, hewing, thrusting, slaying, and being slain. And ever
above the din rose Good’s awful yell of encouragement as he plunged to
wherever the fight was thickest; and ever, with an almost machine-like
regularity, the two axes rose and fell, carrying death and disablement
at every stroke. But I could see that the strain was beginning to tell
upon Sir Henry, who was bleeding from several flesh wounds: his breath
was coming in gasps, and the veins stood out on his forehead like blue
and knotted cords. Even Umslopogaas, man of iron that he was, was hard
pressed. I noticed that he had given up ‘woodpecking’, and was now using
the broad blade of Inkosi-kaas, ‘browning’ his enemy wherever he could
hit him, instead of drilling scientific holes in his head. I myself did
not go into the melee, but hovered outside like the swift ‘back’ in a
football scrimmage, putting a bullet through a Masai whenever I got a
chance. I was more use so. I fired forty-nine cartridges that morning,
and I did not miss many shots.
</p><p>Presently, do as we would, the beam of the balance began to rise against
us. We had not more than fifteen or sixteen effectives left now, and the
Masai had at least fifty. Of course if they had kept their heads, and
shaken themselves together, they could soon have made an end of the
matter; but that is just what they did not do, not having yet recovered
from their start, and some of them having actually fled from their
sleeping-places without their weapons. Still by now many individuals
were fighting with their normal courage and discretion, and this alone
was sufficient to defeat us. To make matters worse just then, when
Mackenzie’s rifle was empty, a brawny savage armed with a ‘sime’,
or sword, made a rush for him. The clergyman flung down his gun, and
drawing his huge carver from his elastic belt (his revolver had dropped
out in the fight), they closed in desperate struggle. Presently, locked
in a close embrace, missionary and Masai rolled on the ground behind the
wall, and for some time I, being amply occupied with my own affairs, and
in keeping my skin from being pricked, remained in ignorance of his fate
or how the duel had ended.
</p><p>To and fro surged the fight, slowly turning round like the vortex of
a human whirlpool, and the matter began to look very bad for us. Just
then, however, a fortunate thing happened. Umslopogaas, either by
accident or design, broke out of the ring and engaged a warrior at some
few paces from it. As he did so, another man ran up and struck him with
all his force between his shoulders with his great spear, which, falling
on the tough steel shirt, failed to pierce it and rebounded. For a
moment the man stared aghast--protective armour being unknown among
these tribes--and then he yelled out at the top of his voice--
</p><p>‘_They are devils--bewitched, bewitched!_’ And seized by a sudden panic,
he threw down his spear, and began to fly. I cut short his career with
a bullet, and Umslopogaas brained his man, and then the panic spread to
the others.
</p><p>‘_Bewitched, bewitched!_’ they cried, and tried to escape in every
direction, utterly demoralized and broken-spirited, for the most part
even throwing down their shields and spears.
</p><p>On the last scene of that dreadful fight I need not dwell. It was a
slaughter great and grim, in which no quarter was asked or given. One
incident, however, is worth detailing. Just as I was hoping that it was
all done with, suddenly from under a heap of slain where he had been
hiding, an unwounded warrior sprang up, and, clearing the piles of dying
dead like an antelope, sped like the wind up the kraal towards the
spot where I was standing at the moment. But he was not alone, for
Umslopogaas came gliding on his tracks with the peculiar swallow-like
motion for which he was noted, and as they neared me I recognized in the
Masai the herald of the previous night. Finding that, run as he would,
his pursuer was gaining on him, the man halted and turned round to give
battle. Umslopogaas also pulled up.
</p><p>‘Ah, ah,’ he cried, in mockery, to the Elmoran, ‘it is thou whom I
talked with last night--the Lygonani! the Herald! the capturer of little
girls--he who would kill a little girl! And thou didst hope to stand man
to man and face to face with Umslopogaas, an Induna of the tribe of
the Maquilisini, of the people of the Amazulu? Behold, thy prayer is
granted! And I didst swear to hew thee limb from limb, thou insolent
dog. Behold, I will do it even now!’
</p><p>The Masai ground his teeth with fury, and charged at the Zulu with
his spear. As he came, Umslopogaas deftly stepped aside, and swinging
Inkosi-kaas high above his head with both hands, brought the broad blade
down with such fearful force from behind upon the Masai’s shoulder just
where the neck is set into the frame, that its razor edge shore right
through bone and flesh and muscle, almost severing the head and one arm
from the body.
</p><p>‘_Ou!_’ ejaculated Umslopogaas, contemplating the corpse of his foe; ‘I
have kept my word. It was a good stroke.’
