<p>The Alali women, fifty strong, sallied forth into the forest to
chastise their recalcitrant males. They carried their heavy bludgeons
and many feathered pebbles, but most formidable of all was their
terrific rage. Never in the memory of one of them had man dared
question their authority, never had he presumed to show aught but fear
of them; but now, instead of slinking away at their approach, he had
dared defy them, to attack them, to slay them! But such a condition
was too preposterous, too unnatural, to exist, nor would it exist much
longer. Had they had speech they would have said that and a number of
other things. It was looking black for the men; the women were in an
ugly mood--but what else could be expected of women who were denied the
power of speech?
</p>
<p>And in this temper they came upon the men in a large clearing where the
renegades had built a fire and were cooking the flesh of a number of
antelope. Never had the women seen their men so sleek and trim. Always
before had they appeared skinny to the verge of cadaverousness, for in
the past they had never fared so well as since the day that Tarzan of
the Apes had given weapons to the son of The First Woman. Where before
they had spent their lives fleeing in terror from their terrible women,
with scarce time to hunt for decent food, now they had leisure and
peace of mind and their weapons brought them flesh that otherwise they
might not have tasted once in a year. From caterpillars and grub worms
they had graduated to an almost steady diet of antelope meat.
</p><p>But the women gave very little heed at the moment to the physical
appearance of the men. They had found them. That was enough. They were
creeping nearer when one of the men looked up and discovered them, and
so insistent are the demands of habit that he forgot his new-found
independence and leaping to his feet, bolted for the trees. The
others, scarce waiting to know the cause of his precipitancy, followed
close upon his heels. The women raced across the clearing as the men
disappeared among the trees upon the opposite side. The former knew
what the men would do. Once in the forest they would stop behind the
nearest trees and look back to see if their pursuers were coming in
their direction. It was this silly habit of the males that permitted
their being easily caught by the less agile females.
</p><p>But all the men had not disappeared. One had taken a few steps in the
mad race for safety and had then halted and wheeled about, facing the
oncoming women. He was the son of The First Woman, and to him Tarzan
had imparted something more than knowledge of new weapons, for from
the Lord of the Jungle, whom he worshipped with doglike devotion, he
had acquired the first rudiments of courage, and so it now happened
that when his more timorous fellows paused behind the trees and
looked back they saw this one standing alone facing the charge of
fifty infuriated shes. They saw him fit arrow to bow, and the women
saw, too, but they did not understand--not immediately--and then the
bow string twanged and the foremost woman collapsed with an arrow in
her heart; but the others did not pause, because the thing had been
done so quickly that the full purport of it had not as yet penetrated
their thick skulls. The son of The First Woman fitted a second arrow
and sped it. Another woman fell, rolling over and over, and now the
others hesitated--hesitated and were lost, for that momentary pause
gave courage to the other men peering from behind the trees. If one of
their number could face fifty women and bring them to halt what might
not eleven men accomplish? They rushed forth then with spears and
arrows just as the women renewed their assault. The feathered pebbles
flew thick and fast, but faster and more accurately flew the feathered
arrows of the men. The leading women rushed courageously forward to
close quarters where they might use their bludgeons and lay hold of the
men with their mighty hands, but they learned then that spears were
more formidable weapons than bludgeons, with the result that those who
did not fall wounded, turned and fled.
</p><p>It was then that the son of The First Woman revealed possession of
a spark of generalship that decided the issue for that day, and,
perhaps, for all time. His action was epochal in the existence of the
Zertalacolols. Instead of being satisfied with repulsing the women,
instead of resting upon laurels gloriously won, he turned the tables
upon the hereditary foe and charged the women, signaling his fellows
to accompany him, and when they saw the women running from them, so
enthused were they by this reversal of a custom ages old, they leaped
swiftly in pursuit.
</p><p>They thought that the son of The First Woman intended that they should
slay all of the enemy and so they were surprised when they saw him
overhaul a comely, young female and, seizing her by the hair, disarm
her. So remarkable did it seem to them that one of their number,
having a woman in his power, did not immediately slay her, they were
constrained to pause and gather around him, asking questions in their
strange sign language.
</p><p>"Why do you hold her?" "Why do you not kill her?" "Are you not afraid
that she will kill you?" were some of the many that were launched at
him.
</p><p>"I am going to keep her," replied the son of The First Woman. "I do not
like to cook. She shall cook for me. If she refuses I shall stick her
with this," and he made a jab toward the young woman's ribs with his
spear, a gesture that caused her to cower and drop fearfully upon one
knee.
</p><p>The men jumped up and down in excitement as the value of this plan and
the evident terror of the woman for the man sank into their dull souls.
</p><p>"Where are the women?" they signed to one another; but the women had
disappeared.
</p><p>One of the men started off in the direction they had gone. "I go!" he
signaled. "I come back with a woman of my own, to cook for me!" In a
mad rush the others followed him, leaving the son of The First Woman
alone with his she. He turned upon her.
</p><p>"You will cook for me?" he demanded.
</p><p>To his signs she but returned a sullen, snarling visage. The son of
The First Woman raised his spear and with the heavy shaft struck the
girl upon the head, knocking her down, and he stood over her, himself
snarling and scowling, menacing her with further punishment, while she
cowered where she had fallen. He kicked her in the side.
</p><p>"Get up!" he commanded.
</p><p>Slowly she crawled to her knees and embracing his legs gazed up into
his face with an expression of doglike adulation and devotion.
</p><p>"You will cook for me?" he demanded again.
</p><p>"Forever!" she replied in the sign language of their people.
</p>
<p>Tarzan had remained but a short time in the little room adjoining
that in which Zoanthrohago had received Elkomoelhago, when he was
summoned to appear before them alone, and as he entered the room his
master motioned him to approach the desk behind which the two men sat.
There was no other person in the room, even the warriors having been
dismissed.
</p><p>"You are quite positive that he understands nothing of our language?"
demanded the king.
</p><p>"He has not spoken a word since he was captured," replied Zoanthrohago.
"We had supposed him some new form of Zertalacolol until it was
discovered that he possessed a language through which he was able to
communicate with the other Trohanadalmakusian slave. It is perfectly
safe to speak freely before him, All-Wise."
</p><p>Elkomoelhago cast a quick, suspicious glance at his companion. He
would have preferred that Zoanthrohago of all men address him as
All-Glorious--it was less definite in its implication. He might deceive
others, even himself, as to his wisdom, but he was perfectly aware that
he could not fool Zoanthrohago.
</p><p>"We have never discussed fully," said the king, "the details of this
experiment. It was for this purpose that I came to the laboratory
today. Now that we have the subject here let us go into the matter
fully and determine what next step we should take."
</p><p>"Yes, All-Wise," replied Zoanthrohago.
</p><p>"Call me Thagosoto," snapped Elkomoelhago.
</p><p>"Yes, Thagosoto," said the prince, using the Minunian word for
Chief-Royal, or King, as Elkomoelhago had commanded. "Let us discuss
the matter, by all means. It presents possibilities of great importance
to your throne." He knew that what Elkomoelhago meant by <u>discussing</u>
the matter consisted only in receiving from Zoanthrohago a detailed
explanation of how he had reduced the stature of the slave Zuanthrol
to one quarter its original proportions; but he proposed, if possible,
to obtain value received for the information, which he knew the king
would use for his own aggrandizement, giving Zoanthrohago no credit
whatever for his discoveries or all the long moons he had devoted to
accomplishing this marvelous, scientific miracle.
</p><p>"Before we enter into this discussion, O, Thagosoto," he said, "I beg
that you will grant me one boon, which I have long desired and have
hitherto hesitated to request, knowing that I did not deserve the
recognition I crave for my poor talents and my mean service to thy
illustrious and justly renowned rule."
</p><p>"What boon do you wish?" demanded Elkomoelhago, crustily. At heart he
feared this wisest of men, and, like the coward that he was, with him
to fear was to hate. If he could have destroyed Zoanthrohago he would
gladly have done so; but he could not afford to do this, since from
this greatest of walmaks came whatever show of scientific ability the
king could make, as well as all the many notable inventions for the
safeguarding of the royal person.
</p><p>"I would sit at the royal council," said Zoanthrohago, simply.
</p><p>The king fidgeted. Of all the nobles of Veltopismakus here was the very
last he would wish to see numbered among the royal councilors, whom he
had chosen with especial reference to the obtuseness of their minds.
</p><p>"There are no vacancies," he said, at last.
</p><p>"The ruler of all men might easily make a vacancy," suggested
Zoanthrohago, "or create a new post--Assistant Chief of Chiefs, for
example, so that when Gofoloso was absent there would be one to take
his place. Otherwise I should not have to attend upon your council
meetings, but devote my time to the perfection of our discoveries and
inventions."
</p><p>Here was a way out and Elkomoelhago seized it. He had no objection to
Zoanthrohago being a royal councilor and thus escaping the burdensome
income-tax, which the makers of the tax had been careful to see proved
no burden to themselves, and he knew that probably that was the only
reason that Zoanthrohago wished to be a councilor. No, the king had no
objection to the appointment, provided it could be arranged that the
new minister was present at no council meetings, for even Elkomoelhago
would have shrunk a bit from claiming as his own all the great
discoveries of Zoanthrohago had Zoanthrohago been present.
</p><p>"Very well," said the king, "you shall be appointed this very day--and
when I want you at the council meetings I will send for you."
</p><p>Zoanthrohago bowed. "And now," he said, "to the discussion of our
experiments, which we hope will reveal a method for increasing the
stature of our warriors when they go forth to battle with our enemies,
and of reducing them to normal size once more when they return."
</p><p>"I hate the mention of battles," cried the king, with a shudder.
</p><p>"But we must be prepared to win them when they are forced upon us,"
suggested Zoanthrohago.
</p><p>"I suppose so," assented the king; "but once we perfect this method of
ours we shall need but a few warriors and the rest may be turned to
peaceful and useful occupations. However, go on with the discussion."
</p><p>Zoanthrohago concealed a smile, and rising, walked around the end of
the table and stopped beside the ape-man. "Here," he said, placing
a finger at the base of Tarzan's skull, "there lies, as you know, a
small, oval, reddish gray body containing a liquid which influences
the growth of tissues and organs. It long ago occurred to me that
interference with the normal functioning of this gland would alter
the growth of the subject to which it belonged. I experimented with
small rodents and achieved remarkable results; but the thing I wished
to accomplish, the increase of man's stature I have been unable to
achieve. I have tried many methods and some day I shall discover the
right one. I think I am on the right track, and that it is merely now
a matter of experimentation. You know that stroking your face lightly
with a smooth bit of stone produces a pleasurable sensation. Apply
the same stone to the same face in the same manner, but with greatly
increased force and you produce a diametrically opposite sensation.
Rub the stone slowly across the face and back again many times, and
then repeat the same motion rapidly for the same number of times and
you will discover that the results are quite different. I am that
close to a solution; I have the correct method but not quite, as yet,
the correct application. I can reduce creatures in size, but I cannot
enlarge them; and although I can reduce them with great ease, I cannot
determine the period or endurance of their reduction. In some cases,
subjects have not regained their normal size under thirty-nine moons,
and in others, they have done so in as short a period as three moons.
There have been cases where normal stature was regained gradually
during a period of seven suns, and others where the subject passed
suddenly from a reduced size to normal size in less than a hundred
heart-beats; this latter phenomenon being always accompanied by
fainting and unconsciousness when it occurred during waking hours."
</p><p>"Of course," commented Elkomoelhago. "Now, let us see. I believe the
thing is simpler than you imagine. You say that to reduce the size of
this subject you struck him with a rock upon the base of the skull.
Therefore, to enlarge his size, the most natural and scientific thing
to do would be to strike him a similar blow upon the forehead. Fetch
the rock and we will prove the correctness of my theory."
</p><p>For a moment Zoanthrohago was at a loss as to how best to circumvent
the stupid intention of the king without humiliating his pride and
arousing his resentment; but the courtiers of Elkomoelhago were
accustomed to think quickly in similar emergencies and Zoanthrohago
speedily found an avenue of escape from his dilemma.
</p><p>"Your sagacity is the pride of your people, Thagosoto," he said, "and
your brilliant hyperbole the despair of your courtiers. In a clever
figure of speech you suggest the way to achievement. By reversing the
manner in which we reduced the stature of Zuanthrol we should be able
to increase it; but, alas, I have tried this and failed. But wait, let
us repeat the experiment precisely as it was originally carried out and
then, by reversing it, we shall, perhaps, be enabled to determine why I
have failed in the past."
</p><p>He stepped quickly across the room to one of a series of large
cupboards that lined the wall and opening the door of it revealed a
cage in which were a number of rodents. Selecting one of these he
returned to the table, where, with wooden pegs and bits of cord he
fastened the rodent securely to a smooth board, its legs spread out and
its body flattened, the under side of the lower jaw resting firmly upon
a small metal plate set flush with the surface of the board. He then
brought forth a small wooden box and a large metal disc, the latter
mounted vertically between supports that permitted it to be revolved
rapidly by means of a hand crank. Mounted rigidly upon the same axis as
the revolving disc was another which remained stationary. The latter
disc appeared to have been constructed of seven segments, each of a
different material from all the others, and from each of these segments
a pad, or brush, protruded sufficiently to press lightly against the
revolving disc.
</p><p>To the reverse side of each of the seven segments of the stationary
disc a wire was attached, and these wires Zoanthrohago now connected
to seven posts projecting from the upper surface of the wooden box.
A single wire attached to a post upon the side of the box had at its
other extremity a small, curved metal plate attached to the inside of
a leather collar. This collar Zoanthrohago adjusted about the neck of
the rodent so that the metal plate came in contact with its skin at the
base of the skull and as close to the hypophysis gland as possible.
</p><p>He then turned his attention once more to the wooden box, upon the
top of which, in addition to the seven binding posts, was a circular
instrument consisting of a dial about the periphery of which were a
series of hieroglyphics. From the center of this dial projected seven
tubular, concentric shafts, each of which supported a needle, which was
shaped or painted in some distinguishing manner, while beneath the dial
seven small metal discs were set in the cover of the box so that they
lay in the arc of a circle from the center of which a revolving metal
shaft was so arranged that its free end might be moved to any one of
the seven metal discs at the will of the operator.
</p><p>The connections having all been made, Zoanthrohago moved the free end
of the shaft from one of the metal discs to another, keeping his eyes
at all times intently upon the dial, the seven needles of which moved
variously as he shifted the shaft from point to point.
</p><p>Elkomoelhago was an intent, if somewhat bewildered, observer, and the
slave, Zuanthrol, unobserved, had moved nearer the table that he might
better watch this experiment which might mean so much to him.
</p><p>Zoanthrohago continued to manipulate the revolving shaft and the
needles moved hither and thither from one series of hieroglyphics to
another, until at last the walmak appeared satisfied.
</p><p>"It is not always easy," he said, "to attune the instrument to the
frequency of the organ upon which we are working. From all matter and
even from such incorporeal a thing as thought there emanate identical
particles, so infinitesimal as to be scarce noted by the most delicate
of my instruments. These particles constitute the basic structure of
all things whether animate or inanimate, corporeal or incorporeal. The
frequency, quantity and rhythm of the emanations determine the nature
of the substance. Having located upon this dial the coefficient of
the gland under discussion it now becomes necessary, in order to so
interfere with its proper functioning that the growth of the creature
involved will be not only stopped but actually reversed, that we
decrease the frequency, increase the quantity and compound the rhythm
of these emanations. This I shall now proceed to do," and he forthwith
manipulated several small buttons upon one side of the box, and
grasping the crankhandle of the free disc revolved it rapidly.
</p><p>The result was instantaneous and startling. Before their eyes
Elkomoelhago, the king, and Zuanthrol, the slave, saw the rodent shrink
rapidly in size, while retaining its proportions unchanged. Tarzan, who
had followed every move and every word of the walmak, leaned far over
that he might impress indelibly upon his memory the position of the
seven needles. Elkomoelhago glanced up and discovered his interest.
</p><p>"We do not need this fellow now," he said, addressing Zoanthrohago.
"Have him sent away."
</p><p>"Yes, Thagosoto," replied Zoanthrohago, summoning a warrior whom he
directed to remove Tarzan and Komodoflorensal to a chamber where they
could be secured until their presence was again required.
