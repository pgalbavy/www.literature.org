<p><em>LORD JIM</em></p>

<p>BY <em>JOSEPH CONRAD</em></p>

<p><em>AUTHOR’S NOTE</em></p>

<p>When this novel first appeared in book form a notion got about
that I had been bolted away with. Some reviewers maintained that
the work starting as a short story had got beyond the writer’s
control. One or two discovered internal evidence of the fact,
which seemed to amuse them. They pointed out the limitations of
the narrative form. They argued that no man could have been expected
to talk all that time, and other men to listen so long. It was
not, they said, very credible.</p>

<p>After thinking it over for something like sixteen years, I am
not so sure about that. Men have been known, both in the tropics
and in the temperate zone, to sit up half the night ‘swapping
yarns’. This, however, is but one yarn, yet with interruptions
affording some measure of relief; and in regard to the listeners’
endurance, the postulate must be accepted that the story was interesting.
It is the necessary preliminary assumption. If I hadn’t believed
that it was interesting I could never have begun to write it.
As to the mere physical possibility we all know that some speeches
in Parliament have taken nearer six than three hours in delivery;
whereas all that part of the book which is Marlow’s narrative
can be read through aloud, I should say, in less than three hours.
Besides&mdash;though I have kept strictly all such insignificant details
out of the tale&mdash;we may presume that there must have been refreshments
on that night, a glass of mineral water of some sort to help the
narrator on.</p>

<p>But, seriously, the truth of the matter is, that my first thought
was of a short story, concerned only with the pilgrim ship episode;
nothing more. And that was a legitimate conception. After writing
a few pages, however, I became for some reason discontented and
I laid them aside for a time. I didn’t take them out of the drawer
till the late Mr. William Blackwood suggested I should give something
again to his magazine.</p>

<p>It was only then that I perceived that the pilgrim ship episode
was a good starting-point for a free and wandering tale; that
it was an event, too, which could conceivably colour the whole
‘sentiment of existence’ in a simple and sensitive character.
But all these preliminary moods and stirrings of spirit were rather
obscure at the time, and they do not appear clearer to me now
after the lapse of so many years.</p>

<p>The few pages I had laid aside were not without their weight
in the choice of subject. But the whole was re-written deliberately.
When I sat down to it I knew it would be a long book, though I
didn’t foresee that it would spread itself over thirteen numbers
of Maga.</p>

<p>I have been asked at times whether this was not the book of mine
I liked best. I am a great foe to favouritism in public life,
in private life, and even in the delicate relationship of an author
to his works. As a matter of principle I will have no favourites;
but I don’t go so far as to feel grieved and annoyed by the preference
some people give to my Lord Jim. I won’t even say that I ‘fail
to understand . . .’ No! But once I had occasion to be puzzled
and surprised.</p>

<p>A friend of mine returning from Italy had talked with a lady
there who did not like the book. I regretted that, of course,
but what surprised me was the ground of her dislike. ‘You know,’
she said, ‘it is all so morbid.’</p>

<p>The pronouncement gave me food for an hour’s anxious thought.
Finally I arrived at the conclusion that, making due allowances
for the subject itself being rather foreign to women’s normal
sensibilities, the lady could not have been an Italian. I wonder
whether she was European at all? In any case, no Latin temperament
would have perceived anything morbid in the acute consciousness
of lost honour. Such a consciousness may be wrong, or it may be
right, or it may be condemned as artificial; and, perhaps, my
Jim is not a type of wide commonness. But I can safely assure
my readers that he is not the product of coldly perverted thinking.
He’s not a figure of Northern Mists either. One sunny morning,
in the commonplace surroundings of an Eastern roadstead, I saw
his form pass by&mdash;appealing&mdash;significant&mdash;under a cloud&mdash;perfectly
silent. Which is as it should be. It was for me, with all the
sympathy of which I was capable, to seek fit words for his meaning.
He was ‘one of us’.</p>
