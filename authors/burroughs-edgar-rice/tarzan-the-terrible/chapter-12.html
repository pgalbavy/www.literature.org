<p>And while the warriors and the priests of A-lur searched the temple and
the palace and the city for the vanished ape-man there entered the head
of Kor-ul-JA down the precipitous trail from the mountains, a naked
stranger bearing an Enfield upon his back.  Silently he moved downward
toward the bottom of the gorge and there where the ancient trail
unfolded more levelly before him he swung along with easy strides,
though always with the utmost alertness against possible dangers. A
gentle breeze came down from the mountains behind him so that only his
ears and his eyes were of value in detecting the presence of danger
ahead.  Generally the trail followed along the banks of the winding
brooklet at the bottom of the gorge, but in some places where the
waters tumbled over a precipitous ledge the trail made a detour along
the side of the gorge, and again it wound in and out among rocky
outcroppings, and presently where it rounded sharply the projecting
shoulder of a cliff the stranger came suddenly face to face with one
who was ascending the gorge.
</p>
<p>Separated by a hundred paces the two halted simultaneously.  Before him
the stranger saw a tall white warrior, naked but for a loin cloth,
cross belts, and a girdle. The man was armed with a heavy, knotted club
and a short knife, the latter hanging in its sheath at his left hip
from the end of one of his cross belts, the opposite belt supporting a
leathern pouch at his right side.  It was Ta-den hunting alone in the
gorge of his friend, the chief of Kor-ul-JA. He contemplated the
stranger with surprise but no wonder, since he recognized in him a
member of the race with which his experience of Tarzan the Terrible had
made him familiar and also, thanks to his friendship for the ape-man,
he looked upon the newcomer without hostility.
</p><p>The latter was the first to make outward sign of his intentions,
raising his palm toward Ta-den in that gesture which has been a symbol
of peace from pole to pole since man ceased to walk upon his knuckles.
Simultaneously he advanced a few paces and halted.
</p><p>Ta-den, assuming that one so like Tarzan the Terrible must be a
fellow-tribesman of his lost friend, was more than glad to accept this
overture of peace, the sign of which he returned in kind as he ascended
the trail to where the other stood. "Who are you?" he asked, but the
newcomer only shook his head to indicate that he did not understand.
</p><p>By signs he tried to carry to the Ho-don the fact that he was following
a trail that had led him over a period of many days from some place
beyond the mountains and Ta-den was convinced that the newcomer sought
Tarzan-jad-guru. He wished, however, that he might discover whether as
friend or foe.
</p><p>The stranger perceived the Ho-don's prehensile thumbs and great toes
and his long tail with an astonishment which he sought to conceal, but
greater than all was the sense of relief that the first inhabitant of
this strange country whom he had met had proven friendly, so greatly
would he have been handicapped by the necessity for forcing his way
through a hostile land.
</p><p>Ta-den, who had been hunting for some of the smaller mammals, the meat
of which is especially relished by the Ho-don, forgot his intended
sport in the greater interest of his new discovery. He would take the
stranger to Om-at and possibly together the two would find some way of
discovering the true intentions of the newcomer. And so again through
signs he apprised the other that he would accompany him and together
they descended toward the cliffs of Om-at's people.
</p><p>As they approached these they came upon the women and children working
under guard of the old men and the youths--gathering the wild fruits
and herbs which constitute a part of their diet, as well as tending the
small acres of growing crops which they cultivate. The fields lay in
small level patches that had been cleared of trees and brush. Their
farm implements consisted of metal-shod poles which bore a closer
resemblance to spears than to tools of peaceful agriculture.
Supplementing these were others with flattened blades that were neither
hoes nor spades, but instead possessed the appearance of an unhappy
attempt to combine the two implements in one.
</p><p>At first sight of these people the stranger halted and unslung his bow
for these creatures were black as night, their bodies entirely covered
with hair. But Ta-den, interpreting the doubt in the other's mind,
reassured him with a gesture and a smile. The Waz-don, however,
gathered around excitedly jabbering questions in a language which the
stranger discovered his guide understood though it was entirely
unintelligible to the former. They made no attempt to molest him and he
was now sure that he had fallen among a peaceful and friendly people.
</p><p>It was but a short distance now to the caves and when they reached
these Ta-den led the way aloft upon the wooden pegs, assured that this
creature whom he had discovered would have no more difficulty in
following him than had Tarzan the Terrible.  Nor was he mistaken for
the other mounted with ease until presently the two stood within the
recess before the cave of Om-at, the chief.
</p><p>The latter was not there and it was mid-afternoon before he returned,
but in the meantime many warriors came to look upon the visitor and in
each instance the latter was more thoroughly impressed with the
friendly and peaceable spirit of his hosts, little guessing that he was
being entertained by a ferocious and warlike tribe who never before the
coming of Ta-den and Tarzan had suffered a stranger among them.
</p><p>At last Om-at returned and the guest sensed intuitively that he was in
the presence of a great man among these people, possibly a chief or
king, for not only did the attitude of the other black warriors
indicate this but it was written also in the mien and bearing of the
splendid creature who stood looking at him while Ta-den explained the
circumstances of their meeting. "And I believe, Om-at," concluded the
Ho-don, "that he seeks Tarzan the Terrible."
</p><p>At the sound of that name, the first intelligible word that had fallen
upon the ears of the stranger since he had come among them, his face
lightened. "Tarzan!" he cried, "Tarzan of the Apes!" and by signs he
tried to tell them that it was he whom he sought.
</p><p>They understood, and also they guessed from the expression of his face
that he sought Tarzan from motives of affection rather than the
reverse, but of this Om-at wished to make sure. He pointed to the
stranger's knife, and repeating Tarzan's name, seized Ta-den and
pretended to stab him, immediately turning questioningly toward the
stranger.
</p><p>The latter shook his head vehemently and then first placing a hand
above his heart he raised his palm in the symbol of peace.
</p><p>"He is a friend of Tarzan-jad-guru," exclaimed Ta-den.
</p><p>"Either a friend or a great liar," replied Om-at.
</p><p>"Tarzan," continued the stranger, "you know him? He lives? O God, if I
could only speak your language." And again reverting to sign language
he sought to ascertain where Tarzan was. He would pronounce the name
and point in different directions, in the cave, down into the gorge,
back toward the mountains, or out upon the valley below, and each time
he would raise his brows questioningly and voice the universal "eh?" of
interrogation which they could not fail to understand. But always Om-at
shook his head and spread his palms in a gesture which indicated that
while he understood the question he was ignorant as to the whereabouts
of the ape-man, and then the black chief attempted as best he might to
explain to the stranger what he knew of the whereabouts of Tarzan.
</p><p>He called the newcomer Jar-don, which in the language of Pal-ul-don
means "stranger," and he pointed to the sun and said <u>as</u>. This he
repeated several times and then he held up one hand with the fingers
outspread and touching them one by one, including the thumb, repeated
the word adenen until the stranger understood that he meant five. Again
he pointed to the sun and describing an arc with his forefinger
starting at the eastern horizon and terminating at the western, he
repeated again the words as adenen. It was plain to the stranger that
the words meant that the sun had crossed the heavens five times. In
other words, five days had passed. Om-at then pointed to the cave where
they stood, pronouncing Tarzan's name and imitating a walking man with
the first and second fingers of his right hand upon the floor of the
recess, sought to show that Tarzan had walked out of the cave and
climbed upward on the pegs five days before, but this was as far as the
sign language would permit him to go.
</p><p>This far the stranger followed him and, indicating that he understood
he pointed to himself and then indicating the pegs leading above
announced that he would follow Tarzan.
</p><p>"Let us go with him," said Om-at, "for as yet we have not punished the
Kor-ul-lul for killing our friend and ally."
</p><p>"Persuade him to wait until morning," said Ta-den, "that you may take
with you many warriors and make a great raid upon the Kor-ul-lul, and
this time, Om-at, do not kill your prisoners.  Take as many as you can
alive and from some of them we may learn the fate of Tarzan-jad-guru."
</p><p>"Great is the wisdom of the Ho-don," replied Om-at. "It shall be as you
say, and having made prisoners of all the Kor-ul-lul we shall make them
tell us what we wish to know. And then we shall march them to the rim
of Kor-ul-GRYF and push them over the edge of the cliff."
</p><p>Ta-den smiled. He knew that they would not take prisoner all the
Kor-ul-lul warriors--that they would be fortunate if they took one and
it was also possible that they might even be driven back in defeat, but
he knew too that Om-at would not hesitate to carry out his threat if he
had the opportunity, so implacable was the hatred of these neighbors
for each other.
</p><p>It was not difficult to explain Om-at's plan to the stranger or to win
his consent since he was aware, when the great black had made it plain
that they would be accompanied by many warriors, that their venture
would probably lead them into a hostile country and every safeguard
that he could employ he was glad to avail himself of, since the
furtherance of his quest was the paramount issue.
</p><p>He slept that night upon a pile of furs in one of the compartments of
Om-at's ancestral cave, and early the next day following the morning
meal they sallied forth, a hundred savage warriors swarming up the face
of the sheer cliff and out upon the summit of the ridge, the main body
preceded by two warriors whose duties coincided with those of the point
of modern military maneuvers, safeguarding the column against the
danger of too sudden contact with the enemy.
</p><p>Across the ridge they went and down into the Kor-ul-lul and there
almost immediately they came upon a lone and unarmed Waz-don who was
making his way fearfully up the gorge toward the village of his tribe.
Him they took prisoner which, strangely, only added to his terror since
from the moment that he had seen them and realized that escape was
impossible, he had expected to be slain immediately.
</p><p>"Take him back to Kor-ul-JA," said Om-at, to one of his warriors, "and
hold him there unharmed until I return."
</p><p>And so the puzzled Kor-ul-lul was led away while the savage company
moved stealthily from tree to tree in its closer advance upon the
village. Fortune smiled upon Om-at in that it gave him quickly what he
sought--a battle royal, for they had not yet come in sight of the caves
of the Kor-ul-lul when they encountered a considerable band of warriors
headed down the gorge upon some expedition.
</p><p>Like shadows the Kor-ul-JA melted into the concealment of the foliage
upon either side of the trail. Ignorant of impending danger, safe in
the knowledge that they trod their own domain where each rock and stone
was as familiar as the features of their mates, the Kor-ul-lul walked
innocently into the ambush.  Suddenly the quiet of that seeming peace
was shattered by a savage cry and a hurled club felled a Kor-ul-lul.
</p><p>The cry was a signal for a savage chorus from a hundred Kor-ul-JA
throats with which were soon mingled the war cries of their enemies.
The air was filled with flying clubs and then as the two forces
mingled, the battle resolved itself into a number of individual
encounters as each warrior singled out a foe and closed upon him.
Knives gleamed and flashed in the mottling sunlight that filtered
through the foliage of the trees above.  Sleek black coats were
streaked with crimson stains.
</p><p>In the thick of the fight the smooth brown skin of the stranger mingled
with the black bodies of friend and foe. Only his keen eyes and his
quick wit had shown him how to differentiate between Kor-ul-lul and
Kor-ul-JA since with the single exception of apparel they were
identical, but at the first rush of the enemy he had noticed that their
loin cloths were not of the leopard-matted hides such as were worn by
his allies.
</p><p>Om-at, after dispatching his first antagonist, glanced at Jar-don. "He
fights with the ferocity of JATO," mused the chief.  "Powerful indeed
must be the tribe from which he and Tarzan-jad-guru come," and then his
whole attention was occupied by a new assailant.
</p><p>The fighters surged to and fro through the forest until those who
survived were spent with exhaustion. All but the stranger who seemed
not to know the sense of fatigue. He fought on when each new antagonist
would have gladly quit, and when there were no more Kor-ul-lul who were
not engaged, he leaped upon those who stood pantingly facing the
exhausted Kor-ul-JA.
</p><p>And always he carried upon his back the peculiar thing which Om-at had
thought was some manner of strange weapon but the purpose of which he
could not now account for in view of the fact that Jar-don never used
it, and that for the most part it seemed but a nuisance and needless
encumbrance since it banged and smashed against its owner as he leaped,
catlike, hither and thither in the course of his victorious duels. The
bow and arrows he had tossed aside at the beginning of the fight but
the Enfield he would not discard, for where he went he meant that it
should go until its mission had been fulfilled.
</p><p>Presently the Kor-ul-JA, seemingly shamed by the example of Jar-don
closed once more with the enemy, but the latter, moved no doubt to
terror by the presence of the stranger, a tireless demon who appeared
invulnerable to their attacks, lost heart and sought to flee. And then
it was that at Om-at's command his warriors surrounded a half-dozen of
the most exhausted and made them prisoners.
</p><p>It was a tired, bloody, and elated company that returned victorious to
the Kor-ul-JA. Twenty of their number were carried back and six of
these were dead men. It was the most glorious and successful raid that
the Kor-ul-JA had made upon the Kor-ul-lul in the memory of man, and it
marked Om-at as the greatest of chiefs, but that fierce warrior knew
that advantage had lain upon his side largely because of the presence
of his strange ally. Nor did he hesitate to give credit where credit
belonged, with the result that Jar-don and his exploits were upon the
tongue of every member of the tribe of Kor-ul-JA and great was the fame
of the race that could produce two such as he and Tarzan-jad-guru.
</p><p>And in the gorge of Kor-ul-lul beyond the ridge the survivors spoke in
bated breath of this second demon that had joined forces with their
ancient enemy.
</p><p>Returned to his cave Om-at caused the Kor-ul-lul prisoners to be
brought into his presence singly, and each he questioned as to the fate
of Tarzan. Without exception they told him the same story--that Tarzan
had been taken prisoner by them five days before but that he had slain
the warrior left to guard him and escaped, carrying the head of the
unfortunate sentry to the opposite side of Kor-ul-lul where he had left
it suspended by its hair from the branch of a tree. But what had become
of him after, they did not know; not one of them, until the last
prisoner was examined, he whom they had taken first--the unarmed
Kor-ul-lul making his way from the direction of the Valley of
Jad-ben-Otho toward the caves of his people.
</p><p>This one, when he discovered the purpose of their questioning, bartered
with them for the lives and liberty of himself and his fellows. "I can
tell you much of this terrible man of whom you ask, Kor-ul-JA," he
said. "I saw him yesterday and I know where he is, and if you will
promise to let me and my fellows return in safety to the caves of our
ancestors I will tell you all, and truthfully, that which I know."
</p><p>"You will tell us anyway," replied Om-at, "or we shall kill you."
</p><p>"You will kill me anyway," retorted the prisoner, "unless you make me
this promise; so if I am to be killed the thing I know shall go with
me."
</p><p>"He is right, Om-at," said Ta-den, "promise him that they shall have
their liberty."
</p><p>"Very well," said Om-at. "Speak Kor-ul-lul, and when you have told me
all, you and your fellows may return unharmed to your tribe."
</p><p>"It was thus," commenced the prisoner. "Three days since I was hunting
with a party of my fellows near the mouth of Kor-ul-lul not far from
where you captured me this morning, when we were surprised and set upon
by a large number of Ho-don who took us prisoners and carried us to
A-lur where a few were chosen to be slaves and the rest were cast into
a chamber beneath the temple where are held for sacrifice the victims
that are offered by the Ho-don to Jad-ben-Otho upon the sacrificial
altars of the temple at A-lur.
</p><p>"It seemed then that indeed was my fate sealed and that lucky were
those who had been selected for slaves among the Ho-don, for they at
least might hope to escape--those in the chamber with me must be
without hope.
</p><p>"But yesterday a strange thing happened. There came to the temple,
accompanied by all the priests and by the king and many of his
warriors, one whom all did great reverence, and when he came to the
barred gateway leading to the chamber in which we wretched ones awaited
our fate, I saw to my surprise that it was none other than that
terrible man who had so recently been a prisoner in the village of
Kor-ul-lul--he whom you call Tarzan-jad-guru but whom they addressed as
Dor-ul-Otho. And he looked upon us and questioned the high priest and
when he was told of the purpose for which we were imprisoned there he
grew angry and cried that it was not the will of Jad-ben-Otho that his
people be thus sacrificed, and he commanded the high priest to liberate
us, and this was done.
</p><p>"The Ho-don prisoners were permitted to return to their homes and we
were led beyond the City of A-lur and set upon our way toward
Kor-ul-lul. There were three of us, but many are the dangers that lie
between A-lur and Kor-ul-lul and we were only three and unarmed.
Therefore none of us reached the village of our people and only one of
us lives. I have spoken."
</p><p>"That is all you know concerning Tarzan-jad-guru?" asked Om-at.
</p><p>"That is all I know," replied the prisoner, "other than that he whom
they call Lu-don, the high priest at A-lur, was very angry, and that
one of the two priests who guided us out of the city said to the other
that the stranger was not Dor-ul-Otho at all; that Lu-don had said so
and that he had also said that he would expose him and that he should
be punished with death for his presumption. That is all they said
within my hearing.
</p><p>"And now, chief of Kor-ul-JA, let us depart."
</p><p>Om-at nodded. "Go your way," he said, "and Ab-on, send warriors to
guard them until they are safely within the Kor-ul-lul.
</p><p>"Jar-don," he said beckoning to the stranger, "come with me," and
rising he led the way toward the summit of the cliff, and when they
stood upon the ridge Om-at pointed down into the valley toward the City
of A-lur gleaming in the light of the western sun.
</p><p>"There is Tarzan-jad-guru," he said, and Jar-don understood.
