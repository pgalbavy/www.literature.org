<p>The three boys had scarcely agreed to the proposition to follow
the hound, when Bowser, as if he understood their intention, rose
from the ground where he had been lying, close to the camp fire,
looked sharply out in the gloom of the surrounding woods, and
then moved along the same course he had taken several times before.</p>

<p>He did not trot, but walked with a deliberate gait, as if he
felt the importance of being the leader of such a party.</p>

<p>"It must be a wild animal," said Sam, in an undertone, "or Bowser
wouldn't act that way."</p>

<p>"It's the bear, of course; see that your guns are ready, and
when you fire be sure you don't miss," warned Herbert.</p>

<p>An idea suddenly occurred to Nick Ribsam.</p>

<p>"All wild animals are afraid of fire: let's each take a torch
to keep him off."</p>

<p>The others eagerly caught up a blazing brand and strode forward
with more confidence than ever.</p>

<p>Herbert Watrous, who was sensible that he had not made such an
exhibition before the others as he desired, placed himself at
the head of the little company.</p>

<p>He hardly would have done this, had he not been certain that
the flaming brands would act as a shield to keep away the wild
animal, whatever its nature.</p>

<p>Each lad found it a little awkward to carry his loaded and cocked
rifle in one hand and the flaming stick of wood in the other.
It cannot be said there was any special difficulty in the task
itself, but if a crisis came the boy would have to surrender one
of his weapons.</p>

<p>The young hunters formed a picturesque group as they moved forward
in Indian file, each holding a burning torch above his head and
swinging it so as to keep the blaze going, while his gun was trailed
in the other hand.</p>

<p>The hound Bowser was at the head, Herbert Watrous next, Sam Harper
followed, and Nick Ribsam, who still limped slightly, brought
up the rear.</p>

<p>The hound showed an intelligence which would have been surprising
but for his action respecting the rattlesnake. He kept on a slow
walk, so as not to leave his friends, and now and then looked
at them, as if to make sure they were not trying to shrink from
an important duty.</p>

<p>"Keep your torches going," called out Herbert, in a husky whisper,
as he swung his own so vigorously that a large piece dropped off,
and, falling on his foot, caused him to leap up with an exclamation
of affright.</p>

<p>The fact was, they had gone no more than a hundred feet from
the camp fire when Herbert began to feel that he had not shown
enough care in picking out his torch, for the blaze was feeble,
and, in spite of continued nursing, showed a tendency to collapse
altogether.</p>

<p>"Keep close to me, boys," he said, waiting for Sam to come still
nearer, "for I don't like the way this torch is behaving; I believe
it is going out altogether, and I think I'll get a better&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>Look out! there he is now!</em>" exclaimed Sam, in no little
excitement.</p>

<p>As he uttered the warning words, Bowser turned squarely about
and ran back to where his master had halted with the smoking torch,
and crouched at his feet, whining and appealing for protection
against some enemy.</p>

<p>Just then a savage sniff was heard, followed instantly by the
sound of hoofs, as the unknown animal charged upon Herbert Watrous,
who was whirling his half-expired torch around his head with such
swiftness that it made a ring of fire, similar to those which
all boys delight to look upon during the pyrotechnic displays
on the Fourth of July.</p>

<p>Herbert was so impressed with the importance of this action,
that he threw all his energy in it, stooping down and rising on
his tip-toes with the motion of the torch, and grunting hard and
with much regularity, as he always did when exerting himself with
unusual vigor.</p>

<p>He caught the warning cry of Sam and the rattle of the hoofs
at the same instant.</p>

<p>"<em>Shoot him! Shoot him!</em>" he shouted to his friends, who
could not gain the view of the beast necessary to make the shot
safe for Herbert himself.</p>

<p>The savage creature, from some reason, probably because the torch
was less formidable, made for the city youth, who was not aware
of his danger until too late.</p>

<p>The brute went directly between his outspread feet, and, lifting
him on his back, carried him several paces, when Herbert, his
gun, torch, and himself, mixed up in great confusion, rolled off
backward, turning a partial somersault and landing solidly on
his head, his gun going off in the confusion and adding to it.</p>

<p>Sam Harper threw down his torch, so as to use his rifle, but
he saw Herbert's dilemma and waited the chance to shoot without
danger of harming him; but the partial extinguishment of his own
torch, and the total blotting out of Herbert's, rendered the risk
still greater.</p>

<p>While he stood, with gun partly raised and hand on the trigger,
Herbert rolled off, but Sam had not time to catch the fact when
the beast shot between his legs, and he felt himself lifted off
his feet and fairly whizzing through the air.</p>

<p>Nick Ribsam's torch was burning brightly and illuminated the
whole scene. He was in a stooping position, holding his flaming
brand so he could see everything, and he was laughing so hard
that he could hardly keep from falling to the ground from weakness.</p>

<p>He had recognized the animal, which they had held in such terror,
as a large hog that had doubtless wandered in the woods so long
with his mates, eating the acorns and nuts fallen from the trees,
that he was half wild and ready to attack any one who came near
him.</p>

<p>The hog was a lank, bony fellow, with great strength and swiftness
of gait, and, like his fiercer brother the wild boar of Europe,
he possessed undoubted courage.</p>

<p>"Well, if that ain't the funniest sight I ever saw!" roared Nick,
bending himself almost double with laughter; "we thought it was
a bear, and I guess Herbert and Sam are sure it is a royal Bengal
tiger or mad elephant&mdash;"</p>
