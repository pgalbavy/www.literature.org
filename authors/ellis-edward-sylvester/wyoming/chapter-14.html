<p>One of the most striking features of the massacre in Wyoming
Valley, in July, 1778, was the number of extraordinary individual
escapes on the part of the fleeing patriots and panic-stricken
settlers. There is no episode in American history marked by so
many singular, and, indeed, almost inexplainable incidents, in
this respect, as was that disaster which swept over one of the
fairest spots that sun ever shone upon.</p>

<p>In the battle there were, on the patriot side, about two hundred
and thirty enrolled men, and seventy old people, boys, civil magistrates,
and other volunteers, embracing six companies, which were mustered
at Forty Fort, where the families from the east side of the Susquehanna
had taken refuge.</p>

<p>A young man, slight of frame and weak of body, was chased by
several Indians, one of whom was almost close enough to throw
his tomahawk. The fugitive, despite his fleetness, was losing
ground, when Zebulon Butler, one of the last to leave the field,
galloped by him on horseback. The fugitive caught the tail of
the animal, and thus helped, made good progress. But the warriors,
knowing he could not keep his hold long, continued the chase.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the poor fellow speedily lost his hold, and was
about to give up, when he caught sight of a drunken soldier, lying
in the wheat-fields. As Colonel Butler went by, he shouted to
the stupid fellow to fire at the Indians. He roused up, rubbed
his eyes, and pointing his wabbling musket in the direction where
he supposed his pursuers to be, let fly.</p>

<p>The leading warrior dropped dead, and his companions, supposing
there was an ambush in front, turned and ran for life, while the
exhausted fugitive pitched forward on the ground and was saved.
Unfortunately, however, this soldier was not the only intoxicated
patriot at Wyoming on that day.</p>

<p>A wealthy settler, finding a party of Indians at his heels, did
his utmost to throw them off his trail, but failed, and was in
despair.</p>

<p>While still struggling forward he came upon the trunk of a large
hollow tree, into which he crept. Knowing the red men would soon
be along, he remained quiet for several hours, scarcely daring
to move a limb.</p>

<p>By and by he heard footsteps, and to his consternation, several
warriors actually sat down on the log itself. The murmur of their
voices, as they talked together, was audible, and he saw no way
by which he could escape discovery.</p>

<p>The opening in the log through which he had crawled was in plain
sight of the Indians, who stooped down and peered in.</p>

<p>The fugitive saw the painted faces, as they strained their eyes
to pierce the gloom, and he was certain they would detect him
as soon as they became used to the darkness.</p>

<p>But shortly after he crawled into the refuge a spider spun his
web across the opening, and the quick eye of the warriors noted
it. With good reason they accepted it as a proof that no one had
taken refuge there, and they accordingly left.</p>

<p>The fugitives, whose history we have set out to give, crouched
behind the rocks in the woods, and tremblingly listened to the
approaching footsteps, that all believed were those of Indians.</p>

<p>The gathering twilight was already strong enough in the wilderness
to hide them from the observation of any who might stray to that
section, and a fight was almost certain to be the result of detection.</p>

<p>It was noticeable that Habakkuk McEwen took more precaution against
discovery than the African, or even the ladies. He lay flat on
his face, where no one could see him unless he passed directly
by the spot.</p>

<p>He kept whispering to the others to be quiet, and to "scrooch"
lower, for the Indians are proverbial for their keen sightedness.</p>

<p>The curiosity of the ladies got the better of their prudence,
and each one peered cautiously from behind the sheltering rock.
Aunt Peggy besought Maggie and Eva to keep out of sight, but all
the time she was thrusting her own head forward and drawing it
back again in a way that was more likely to attract attention
to herself than if she remained stationary.</p>

<p>"If you girls ain't more careful, some of the scand'lous villains&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that instant Eva Brainerd sprang to her feet with a faint
scream, and, to the horror of her friends, leaped nimbly upon
the rock, then down to the ground, and ran like a fawn in the
direction whence came the disturbance, and where the outlines
of a dark figure were dimly observed.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's papa! my own papa!" exclaimed the joyful girl, who
was caught in the arms of her no less delighted parent, and pressed
to his breast.</p>

<p>"Heaven be thanked!" exclaimed Mr. Brainerd, kissing and embracing
the fond child again and again, and then, holding her hand in
his, he fairly ran toward the bewildered fugitives, who had sprung
to their feet as they recognized him.</p>

<p>Then the laughing, happy Maggie's white arms were thrown around
her father's neck, and both cried for joy.</p>

<p>Mr. Brainerd was in a sorry plight. His coat, vest, and hat were
gone, and his draggling garments were dripping with river water,
but it was his own genial self who stood before them. And when
he released his daughter, he shook the hand of Aunt Peggy warmly,
as he did that of Habakkuk McEwen, who was an old acquaintance,
and at whose Indian-like disguise he laughed.</p>

<p>All were talking, smiling, and congratulating each other for
the next few minutes, and nothing was thought of the peril incurred
in giving way to their feelings at such a time, and in such a
place.</p>

<p>But there was one still missing&mdash;the loved brother, who had gone
so valiantly in search of his parent. When the latter had told
his story, Maggie asked:</p>

<p>"Papa, where can Fred be?"</p>

<p>"I hope he is safe; but we cannot be sure of it for some time
yet. He is a brave, noble boy. I will never cease to be grateful,
if he is spared to join us."</p>

<p>The father, hiding his own misgivings as best he could, only
said that he and his son (as he always regarded his step-son),
were compelled to separate a short time before, on the other side
of the river, and since a man of his age was able to rejoin his
friends, there surely must be reason to believe that one so young
and active as Fred would soon show himself. So all resolved to
hope, though their fears made the hope more painful than cheering.</p>

<p>"It won't do to stay here," said Mr. Brainerd, when told that
they thought of camping where they were till morning.</p>

<p>"Is the danger imminent?" asked McEwen.</p>

<p>"The Tories and Indians are continually crossing the river, and
there must be at least a hundred on this side; their whole purpose
is massacre. I do not think it possible for us to escape discovery
if we wait another hour."</p>

<p>"Then let's be off!" said Habakkuk, throwing his rifle over his
shoulder, and starting in the direction of the mountains.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" interposed Gimp; "Ise de guide ob dis procession,
and if you takes my place you'll be lost sartin sure."</p>

<p>"All right, go ahead!" assented the other; "only don't be so
slow about it."</p>

<p>"Many of the poor people," explained Mr. Brainerd, as the party
made ready to start, "are following the trails through the woods
and mountains, and they are suffering frightfully&mdash;hark!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, the sharp crack of two guns was heard, so close
at hand that all started and looked behind them.</p>

<p>Nothing however was seen, and the elder added, as they resumed
their flight, "Others of our friends have done like us and left
the trails, but without avoiding danger, though they may lessen
it."</p>

<p>"But we can't tramp all the way through the woods in this fashion,"
protested Aunt Peggy, as she caught her foot in a root and narrowly
saved herself from falling forward on her hands.</p>

<p>"No; after getting to the other side of the mountains we will
work off to the right and strike the regular Stroudsburg trail,
and keep to it until beyond the reach of the Tories and Indians."</p>

<p>"That's the doctrine I subscribe to," assented Habakkuk; "Mr.
Brainerd, you will take charge of the extra gun, which allows
one to each man; that's three, and we ought to be able to give
a good account of ourselves, though I do hope we shall get through
without any more trouble."</p>

<p>As before, the African acted the part of guide. He had tramped
through these woods so many times that it may be said he was familiar
with every acre. In the preceding winter he and Mr. Brainerd had
hunted deer, and both remembered a romantic spot where there was
a natural cavern, not very deep, which they availed themselves
of for shelter when overtaken by a driving snow-storm.</p>

<p>As Mr. Brainerd recalled the place he directed Gimp to conduct
them thither, it being his purpose to stay there until night should
fully settle upon the wilderness.</p>

<p>His reason for what might seem a singular step was that the sounds
of firing, and the occasional whoops of Indians near at hand,
convinced him that, if they attempted to go much farther while
it was so light, they would be sure to come in collision with
some of these savage bands, in which event it would be hardly
possible to escape the loss of several, if not all the party.</p>

<p>"We will take advantage of the natural fort," said he, "until
it is dark, and then Gravity knows the woods so well, he can lead
us through the mountains to the other side, where we need not
hesitate to take the main trail to Stroudsburg."</p>
