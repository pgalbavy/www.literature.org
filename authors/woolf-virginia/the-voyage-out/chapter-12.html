<p>When Susan's engagement had been approved at home, and made public
to any one who took an interest in it at the hotel&mdash;and by this
time the society at the hotel was divided so as to point to invisible
chalk-marks such as Mr. Hirst had described, the news was felt
to justify some celebration&mdash;an expedition? That had been done
already. A dance then. The advantage of a dance was that it abolished
one of those long evenings which were apt to become tedious and
lead to absurdly early hours in spite of bridge.</p>

<p>Two or three people standing under the erect body of the stuffed
leopard in the hall very soon had the matter decided. Evelyn slid
a pace or two this way and that, and pronounced that the floor
was excellent. Signor Rodriguez informed them of an old Spaniard
who fiddled at weddings&mdash;fiddled so as to make a tortoise waltz;
and his daughter, although endowed with eyes as black as coal-scuttles,
had the same power over the piano. If there were any so sick or
so surly as to prefer sedentary occupations on the night in question
to spinning and watching others spin, the drawing-room and billiard-room
were theirs. Hewet made it his business to conciliate the outsiders
as much as possible. To Hirst's theory of the invisible chalk-marks
he would pay no attention whatever. He was treated to a snub or
two, but, in reward, found obscure lonely gentlemen delighted
to have this opportunity of talking to their kind, and the lady
of doubtful character showed every symptom of confiding her case
to him in the near future. Indeed it was made quite obvious to
him that the two or three hours between dinner and bed contained
an amount of unhappiness, which was really pitiable, so many people
had not succeeded in making friends.</p>

<p>It was settled that the dance was to be on Friday, one week after
the engagement, and at dinner Hewet declared himself satisfied.</p>

<p>"They're all coming!" he told Hirst. "Pepper!" he called, seeing
William Pepper slip past in the wake of the soup with a pamphlet
beneath his arm, "We're counting on you to open the ball."</p>

<p>"You will certainly put sleep out of the question," Pepper returned.</p>

<p>"You are to take the floor with Miss Allan," Hewet continued,
consulting a sheet of pencilled notes.</p>

<p>Pepper stopped and began a discourse upon round dances, country
dances, morris dances, and quadrilles, all of which are entirely
superior to the bastard waltz and spurious polka which have ousted
them most unjustly in contemporary popularity&mdash;when the waiters
gently pushed him on to his table in the corner.</p>

<p>The dining-room at this moment had a certain fantastic resemblance
to a farmyard scattered with grain on which bright pigeons kept
descending. Almost all the ladies wore dresses which they had
not yet displayed, and their hair rose in waves and scrolls so
as to appear like carved wood in Gothic churches rather than hair.
The dinner was shorter and less formal than usual, even the waiters
seeming to be affected with the general excitement. Ten minutes
before the clock struck nine the committee made a tour through
the ballroom. The hall, when emptied of its furniture, brilliantly
lit, adorned with flowers whose scent tinged the air, presented
a wonderful appearance of ethereal gaiety.</p>

<p>"It's like a starlit sky on an absolutely cloudless night," Hewet
murmured, looking about him, at the airy empty room.</p>

<p>"A heavenly floor, anyhow," Evelyn added, taking a run and sliding
two or three feet along.</p>

<p>"What about those curtains?" asked Hirst. The crimson curtains
were drawn across the long windows. "It's a perfect night outside."</p>

<p>"Yes, but curtains inspire confidence," Miss Allan decided. "When
the ball is in full swing it will be time to draw them. We might
even open the windows a little. . . . If we do it now elderly
people will imagine there are draughts."</p>

<p>Her wisdom had come to be recognised, and held in respect. Meanwhile
as they stood talking, the musicians were unwrapping their instruments,
and the violin was repeating again and again a note struck upon
the piano. Everything was ready to begin.</p>

<p>After a few minutes' pause, the father, the daughter, and the
son-in-law who played the horn flourished with one accord. Like
the rats who followed the piper, heads instantly appeared in the
doorway. There was another flourish; and then the trio dashed
spontaneously into the triumphant swing of the waltz. It was as
though the room were instantly flooded with water. After a moment's
hesitation first one couple, then another, leapt into mid-stream,
and went round and round in the eddies. The rhythmic swish of
the dancers sounded like a swirling pool. By degrees the room
grew perceptibly hotter. The smell of kid gloves mingled with
the strong scent of flowers. The eddies seemed to circle faster
and faster, until the music wrought itself into a crash, ceased,
and the circles were smashed into little separate bits. The couples
struck off in different directions, leaving a thin row of elderly
people stuck fast to the walls, and here and there a piece of
trimming or a handkerchief or a flower lay upon the floor. There
was a pause, and then the music started again, the eddies whirled,
the couples circled round in them, until there was a crash, and
the circles were broken up into separate pieces.</p>

<p>When this had happened about five times, Hirst, who leant against
a window-frame, like some singular gargoyle, perceived that Helen
Ambrose and Rachel stood in the doorway. The crowd was such that
they could not move, but he recognised them by a piece of Helen's
shoulder and a glimpse of Rachel's head turning round. He made
his way to them; they greeted him with relief.</p>

<p>"We are suffering the tortures of the damned," said Helen.</p>

<p>"This is my idea of hell," said Rachel.</p>

<p>Her eyes were bright and she looked bewildered.</p>

<p>Hewet and Miss Allan, who had been waltzing somewhat laboriously,
paused and greeted the newcomers.</p>

<p>"This <em>is</em> nice," said Hewet. "But where is Mr. Ambrose?"</p>

<p>"Pindar," said Helen. "May a married woman who was forty in October
dance? I can't stand still." She seemed to fade into Hewet, and
they both dissolved in the crowd.</p>

<p>"We must follow suit," said Hirst to Rachel, and he took her
resolutely by the elbow. Rachel, without being expert, danced
well, because of a good ear for rhythm, but Hirst had no taste
for music, and a few dancing lessons at Cambridge had only put
him into possession of the anatomy of a waltz, without imparting
any of its spirit. A single turn proved to them that their methods
were incompatible; instead of fitting into each other their bones
seemed to jut out in angles making smooth turning an impossibility,
and cutting, moreover, into the circular progress of the other
dancers.</p>

<p>"Shall we stop?" said Hirst. Rachel gathered from his expression
that he was annoyed.</p>

<p>They staggered to seats in the corner, from which they had a
view of the room. It was still surging, in waves of blue and yellow,
striped by the black evening-clothes of the gentlemen.</p>

<p>"An amazing spectacle," Hirst remarked. "Do you dance much in
London?" They were both breathing fast, and both a little excited,
though each was determined not to show any excitement at all.</p>

<p>"Scarcely ever. Do you?"</p>

<p>"My people give a dance every Christmas."</p>

<p>"This isn't half a bad floor," Rachel said. Hirst did not attempt
to answer her platitude. He sat quite silent, staring at the dancers.
After three minutes the silence became so intolerable to Rachel
that she was goaded to advance another commonplace about the beauty
of the night. Hirst interrupted her ruthlessly.</p>

<p>"Was that all nonsense what you said the other day about being
a Christian and having no education?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It was practically true," she replied. "But I also play the
piano very well," she said, "better, I expect than any one in
this room. You are the most distinguished man in England, aren't
you?" she asked shyly.</p>

<p>"One of the three," he corrected.</p>

<p>Helen whirling past here tossed a fan into Rachel's lap.</p>

<p>"She is very beautiful," Hirst remarked.</p>

<p>They were again silent. Rachel was wondering whether he thought
her also nice-looking; St. John was considering the immense difficulty
of talking to girls who had no experience of life. Rachel had
obviously never thought or felt or seen anything, and she might
be intelligent or she might be just like all the rest. But Hewet's
taunt rankled in his mind&mdash;"you don't know how to get on with
women," and he was determined to profit by this opportunity. Her
evening-clothes bestowed on her just that degree of unreality
and distinction which made it romantic to speak to her, and stirred
a desire to talk, which irritated him because he did not know
how to begin. He glanced at her, and she seemed to him very remote
and inexplicable, very young and chaste. He drew a sigh, and began.</p>

<p>"About books now. What have you read? Just Shakespeare and the
Bible?"</p>

<p>"I haven't read many classics," Rachel stated. She was slightly
annoyed by his jaunty and rather unnatural manner, while his masculine
acquirements induced her to take a very modest view of her own
power.</p>

<p>"D'you mean to tell me you've reached the age of twenty-four
without reading Gibbon?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," she answered.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!" he exclaimed, throwing out his hands. "You must begin
to-morrow. I shall send you my copy. What I want to know is&mdash;"
he looked at her critically. "You see, the problem is, can one
really talk to you? Have you got a mind, or are you like the rest
of your sex? You seem to me absurdly young compared with men of
your age."</p>

<p>Rachel looked at him but said nothing.</p>

<p>"About Gibbon," he continued. "D'you think you'll be able to
appreciate him? He's the test, of course. It's awfully difficult
to tell about women," he continued, "how much, I mean, is due
to lack of training, and how much is native incapacity. I don't
see myself why you shouldn't understand&mdash;only I suppose you've
led an absurd life until now&mdash;you've just walked in a crocodile,
I suppose, with your hair down your back."</p>

<p>The music was again beginning. Hirst's eye wandered about the
room in search of Mrs. Ambrose. With the best will in the world
he was conscious that they were not getting on well together.</p>

<p>"I'd like awfully to lend you books," he said, buttoning his
gloves, and rising from his seat. "We shall meet again. I'm going
to leave you now."</p>

<p>He got up and left her.</p>

<p>Rachel looked round. She felt herself surrounded, like a child
at a party, by the faces of strangers all hostile to her, with
hooked noses and sneering, indifferent eyes. She was by a window,
she pushed it open with a jerk. She stepped out into the garden.
Her eyes swam with tears of rage.</p>

<p>"Damn that man!" she exclaimed, having acquired some of Helen's
words. "Damn his insolence!"</p>

<p>She stood in the middle of the pale square of light which the
window she had opened threw upon the grass. The forms of great
black trees rose massively in front of her. She stood still, looking
at them, shivering slightly with anger and excitement. She heard
the trampling and swinging of the dancers behind her, and the
rhythmic sway of the waltz music.</p>

<p>"There are trees," she said aloud. Would the trees make up for
St. John Hirst? She would be a Persian princess far from civilisation,
riding her horse upon the mountains alone, and making her women
sing to her in the evening, far from all this, from the strife
and men and women&mdash;a form came out of the shadow; a little red
light burnt high up in its blackness.</p>

<p>"Miss Vinrace, is it?" said Hewet, peering at her. "You were
dancing with Hirst?"</p>

<p>"He's made me furious!" she cried vehemently. "No one's any right
to be insolent!"</p>

<p>"Insolent?" Hewet repeated, taking his cigar from his mouth in
surprise. "Hirst&mdash;insolent?"</p>

<p>"It's insolent to&mdash;" said Rachel, and stopped. She did not know
exactly why she had been made so angry. With a great effort she
pulled herself together.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," she added, the vision of Helen and her mockery before
her, "I dare say I'm a fool." She made as though she were going
back into the ballroom, but Hewet stopped her.</p>

<p>"Please explain to me," he said. "I feel sure Hirst didn't mean
to hurt you."</p>

<p>When Rachel tried to explain, she found it very difficult. She
could not say that she found the vision of herself walking in
a crocodile with her hair down her back peculiarly unjust and
horrible, nor could she explain why Hirst's assumption of the
superiority of his nature and experience had seemed to her not
only galling but terrible&mdash;as if a gate had clanged in her face.
Pacing up and down the terrace beside Hewet she said bitterly:</p>

<p>"It's no good; we should live separate; we cannot understand
each other; we only bring out what's worst."</p>

<p>Hewet brushed aside her generalisation as to the natures of the
two sexes, for such generalisations bored him and seemed to him
generally untrue. But, knowing Hirst, he guessed fairly accurately
what had happened, and, though secretly much amused, was determined
that Rachel should not store the incident away in her mind to
take its place in the view she had of life.</p>

<p>"Now you'll hate him," he said, "which is wrong. Poor old Hirst&mdash;he
can't help his method. And really, Miss Vinrace, he was doing
his best; he was paying you a compliment&mdash;he was trying&mdash;he was
trying&mdash;" he could not finish for the laughter that overcame him.</p>

<p>Rachel veered round suddenly and laughed out too. She saw that
there was something ridiculous about Hirst, and perhaps about
herself.</p>

<p>"It's his way of making friends, I suppose," she laughed. "Well
&mdash;I shall do my part. I shall begin&mdash;'Ugly in body, repulsive
in mind as you are, Mr. Hirst&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" cried Hewet. "That's the way to treat him. You
see, Miss Vinrace, you must make allowances for Hirst. He's lived
all his life in front of a looking-glass, so to speak, in a beautiful
panelled room, hung with Japanese prints and lovely old chairs
and tables, just one splash of colour, you know, in the right
place,&mdash;between the windows I think it is,&mdash;and there he sits
hour after hour with his toes on the fender, talking about philosophy
and God and his liver and his heart and the hearts of his friends.
They're all broken. You can't expect him to be at his best in
a ballroom. He wants a cosy, smoky, masculine place, where he
can stretch his legs out, and only speak when he's got something
to say. For myself, I find it rather dreary. But I do respect
it. They're all so much in earnest. They do take the serious things
very seriously."</p>

<p>The description of Hirst's way of life interested Rachel so much
that she almost forgot her private grudge against him, and her
respect revived.</p>

<p>"They are really very clever then?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Of course they are. So far as brains go I think it's true what
he said the other day; they're the cleverest people in England.
But&mdash;you ought to take him in hand," he added. "There's a great
deal more in him than's ever been got at. He wants some one to
laugh at him. . . . The idea of Hirst telling you that you've
had no experiences! Poor old Hirst!"</p>

<p>They had been pacing up and down the terrace while they talked,
and now one by one the dark windows were uncurtained by an invisible
hand, and panes of light fell regularly at equal intervals upon
the grass. They stopped to look in at the drawing-room, and perceived
Mr. Pepper writing alone at a table.</p>

<p>"There's Pepper writing to his aunt," said Hewet. "She must be
a very remarkable old lady, eighty-five he tells me, and he takes
her for walking tours in the New Forest. . . . Pepper!" he cried,
rapping on the window. "Go and do your duty. Miss Allan expects
you."</p>

<p>When they came to the windows of the ballroom, the swing of the
dancers and the lilt of the music was irresistible.</p>

<p>"Shall we?" said Hewet, and they clasped hands and swept off
magnificently into the great swirling pool. Although this was
only the second time they had met, the first time they had seen
a man and woman kissing each other, and the second time Mr. Hewet
had found that a young woman angry is very like a child. So that
when they joined hands in the dance they felt more at their ease
than is usual.</p>

<p>It was midnight and the dance was now at its height. Servants
were peeping in at the windows; the garden was sprinkled with
the white shapes of couples sitting out. Mrs. Thornbury and Mrs.
Elliot sat side by side under a palm tree, holding fans, handkerchiefs,
and brooches deposited in their laps by flushed maidens. Occasionally
they exchanged comments.</p>

<p>"Miss Warrington <em>does</em> look happy," said Mrs. Elliot;
they both smiled; they both sighed.</p>

<p>"He has a great deal of character," said Mrs. Thornbury, alluding
to Arthur.</p>

<p>"And character is what one wants," said Mrs. Elliot. "Now that
young man is <em>clever</em> enough," she added, nodding at Hirst,
who came past with Miss Allan on his arm.</p>

<p>"He does not look strong," said Mrs. Thornbury. "His complexion
is not good. &mdash;Shall I tear it off?" she asked, for Rachel
had stopped, conscious of a long strip trailing behind her.</p>

<p>"I hope you are enjoying yourselves?" Hewet asked the ladies.</p>

<p>"This is a very familiar position for me!" smiled Mrs. Thornbury.
"I have brought out five daughters&mdash;and they all loved dancing!
You love it too, Miss Vinrace?" she asked, looking at Rachel with
maternal eyes. "I know I did when I was your age. How I used to
beg my mother to let me stay&mdash;and now I sympathise with the poor
mothers&mdash;but I sympathise with the daughters too!"</p>

<p>She smiled sympathetically, and at the same time rather keenly,
at Rachel.</p>

<p>"They seem to find a great deal to say to each other," said Mrs.
Elliot, looking significantly at the backs of the couple as they
turned away. "Did you notice at the picnic? He was the only person
who could make her utter."</p>

<p>"Her father is a very interesting man," said Mrs. Thornbury.
"He has one of the largest shipping businesses in Hull. He made
a very able reply, you remember, to Mr. Asquith at the last election.
It is so interesting to find that a man of his experience is a
strong Protectionist."</p>

<p>She would have liked to discuss politics, which interested her
more than personalities, but Mrs. Elliot would only talk about
the Empire in a less abstract form.</p>

<p>"I hear there are dreadful accounts from England about the rats,"
she said. "A sister-in-law, who lives at Norwich, tells me it
has been quite unsafe to order poultry. The plague&mdash;you see. It
attacks the rats, and through them other creatures."</p>

<p>"And the local authorities are not taking proper steps?" asked
Mrs. Thornbury.</p>

<p>"That she does not say. But she describes the attitude of the
educated people&mdash;who should know better&mdash;as callous in the extreme.
Of course, my sister-in-law is one of those active modern women,
who always takes things up, you know&mdash;the kind of woman one admires,
though one does not feel, at least I do not feel&mdash;but then she
has a constitution of iron."</p>

<p>Mrs. Elliot, brought back to the consideration of her own delicacy,
here sighed.</p>

<p>"A very animated face," said Mrs. Thornbury, looking at Evelyn
M. who had stopped near them to pin tight a scarlet flower at
her breast. It would not stay, and, with a spirited gesture of
impatience, she thrust it into her partner's button-hole. He was
a tall melancholy youth, who received the gift as a knight might
receive his lady's token.</p>

<p>"Very trying to the eyes," was Mrs. Eliot's next remark, after
watching the yellow whirl in which so few of the whirlers had
either name or character for her, for a few minutes. Bursting
out of the crowd, Helen approached them, and took a vacant chair.</p>

<p>"May I sit by you?" she said, smiling and breathing fast. "I
suppose I ought to be ashamed of myself," she went on, sitting
down, "at my age."</p>

<p>Her beauty, now that she was flushed and animated, was more expansive
than usual, and both the ladies felt the same desire to touch
her.</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em> enjoying myself," she panted. "Movement&mdash;isn't
it amazing?"</p>

<p>"I have always heard that nothing comes up to dancing if one
is a good dancer," said Mrs. Thornbury, looking at her with a
smile.</p>

<p>Helen swayed slightly as if she sat on wires.</p>

<p>"I could dance for ever!" she said. "They ought to let themselves
go more!" she exclaimed. "They ought to leap and swing. Look!
How they mince!"</p>

<p>"Have you seen those wonderful Russian dancers?" began Mrs. Elliot.
But Helen saw her partner coming and rose as the moon rises. She
was half round the room before they took their eyes off her, for
they could not help admiring her, although they thought it a little
odd that a woman of her age should enjoy dancing.</p>

<p>Directly Helen was left alone for a minute she was joined by
St. John Hirst, who had been watching for an opportunity.</p>

<p>"Should you mind sitting out with me?" he asked. "I'm quite incapable
of dancing." He piloted Helen to a corner which was supplied with
two arm-chairs, and thus enjoyed the advantage of semi-privacy.
They sat down, and for a few minutes Helen was too much under
the influence of dancing to speak.</p>

<p>"Astonishing!" she exclaimed at last. "What sort of shape can
she think her body is?" This remark was called forth by a lady
who came past them, waddling rather than walking, and leaning
on the arm of a stout man with globular green eyes set in a fat
white face. Some support was necessary, for she was very stout,
and so compressed that the upper part of her body hung considerably
in advance of her feet, which could only trip in tiny steps, owing
to the tightness of the skirt round her ankles. The dress itself
consisted of a small piece of shiny yellow satin, adorned here
and there indiscriminately with round shields of blue and green
beads made to imitate hues of a peacock's breast. On the summit
of a frothy castle of hair a purple plume stood erect, while her
short neck was encircled by a black velvet ribbon knobbed with
gems, and golden bracelets were tightly wedged into the flesh
of her fat gloved arms. She had the face of an impertinent but
jolly little pig, mottled red under a dusting of powder.</p>

<p>St. John could not join in Helen's laughter.</p>

<p>"It makes me sick," he declared. "The whole thing makes me sick.
. . . Consider the minds of those people&mdash;their feelings. Don't
you agree?"</p>

<p>"I always make a vow never to go to another party of any description,"
Helen replied, "and I always break it."</p>

<p>She leant back in her chair and looked laughingly at the young
man. She could see that he was genuinely cross, if at the same
time slightly excited.</p>

<p>"However," he said, resuming his jaunty tone, "I suppose one
must just make up one's mind to it."</p>

<p>"To what?"</p>

<p>"There never will be more than five people in the world worth
talking to."</p>

<p>Slowly the flush and sparkle in Helen's face died away, and she
looked as quiet and as observant as usual.</p>

<p>"Five people?" she remarked. "I should say there were more than
five."</p>

<p>"You've been very fortunate, then," said Hirst. "Or perhaps I've
been very unfortunate." He became silent.</p>

<p>"Should you say I was a difficult kind of person to get on with?"
he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Most clever people are when they're young," Helen replied.</p>

<p>"And of course I am&mdash;immensely clever," said Hirst. "I'm infinitely
cleverer than Hewet. It's quite possible," he continued in his
curiously impersonal manner, "that I'm going to be one of the
people who really matter. That's utterly different from being
clever, though one can't expect one's family to see it," he added
bitterly.</p>

<p>Helen thought herself justified in asking, "Do you find your
family difficult to get on with?"</p>

<p>"Intolerable. . . . They want me to be a peer and a privy councillor.
I've come out here partly in order to settle the matter. It's
got to be settled. Either I must go to the bar, or I must stay
on in Cambridge. Of course, there are obvious drawbacks to each,
but the arguments certainly do seem to me in favour of Cambridge.
This kind of thing!" he waved his hand at the crowded ballroom.
"Repulsive. I'm conscious of great powers of affection too. I'm
not susceptible, of course, in the way Hewet is. I'm very fond
of a few people. I think, for example, that there's something
to be said for my mother, though she is in many ways so deplorable.
. . . At Cambridge, of course, I should inevitably become the
most important man in the place, but there are other reasons why
I dread Cambridge&mdash;" he ceased.</p>

<p>"Are you finding me a dreadful bore?" he asked. He changed curiously
from a friend confiding in a friend to a conventional young man
at a party.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," said Helen. "I like it very much."</p>

<p>"You can't think," he exclaimed, speaking almost with emotion,
"what a difference it makes finding someone to talk to! Directly
I saw you I felt you might possibly understand me. I'm very fond
of Hewet, but he hasn't the remotest idea what I'm like. You're
the only woman I've ever met who seems to have the faintest conception
of what I mean when I say a thing."</p>

<p>The next dance was beginning; it was the Barcarolle out of Hoffman,
which made Helen beat her toe in time to it; but she felt that
after such a compliment it was impossible to get up and go, and,
besides being amused, she was really flattered, and the honesty
of his conceit attracted her. She suspected that he was not happy,
and was sufficiently feminine to wish to receive confidences.</p>

<p>"I'm very old," she sighed.</p>

<p>"The odd thing is that I don't find you old at all," he replied.
"I feel as though we were exactly the same age. Moreover&mdash;" here
he hesitated, but took courage from a glance at her face, "I feel
as if I could talk quite plainly to you as one does to a man&mdash;about
the relations between the sexes, about . . . and . . ."</p>

<p>In spite of his certainty a slight redness came into his face
as he spoke the last two words.</p>

<p>She reassured him at once by the laugh with which she exclaimed,
"I should hope so!"</p>

<p>He looked at her with real cordiality, and the lines which were
drawn about his nose and lips slackened for the first time.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" he exclaimed. "Now we can behave like civilised
human beings."</p>

<p>Certainly a barrier which usually stands fast had fallen, and
it was possible to speak of matters which are generally only alluded
to between men and women when doctors are present, or the shadow
of death. In five minutes he was telling her the history of his
life. It was long, for it was full of extremely elaborate incidents,
which led on to a discussion of the principles on which morality
is founded, and thus to several very interesting matters, which
even in this ballroom had to be discussed in a whisper, lest one
of the pouter pigeon ladies or resplendent merchants should overhear
them, and proceed to demand that they should leave the place.
When they had come to an end, or, to speak more accurately, when
Helen intimated by a slight slackening of her attention that they
had sat there long enough, Hirst rose, exclaiming, "So there's
no reason whatever for all this mystery!"</p>

<p>"None, except that we are English people," she answered. She
took his arm and they crossed the ball-room, making their way
with difficulty between the spinning couples, who were now perceptibly
dishevelled, and certainly to a critical eye by no means lovely
in their shapes. The excitement of undertaking a friendship and
the length of their talk, made them hungry, and they went in search
of food to the dining-room, which was now full of people eating
at little separate tables. In the doorway they met Rachel, going
up to dance again with Arthur Venning. She was flushed and looked
very happy, and Helen was struck by the fact that in this mood
she was certainly more attractive than the generality of young
women. She had never noticed it so clearly before.</p>

<p>"Enjoying yourself?" she asked, as they stopped for a second.</p>

<p>"Miss Vinrace," Arthur answered for her, "has just made a confession;
she'd no idea that dances could be so delightful."</p>

<p>"Yes!" Rachel exclaimed. "I've changed my view of life completely!"</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" Helen mocked. They passed on.</p>

<p>"That's typical of Rachel," she said. "She changes her view of
life about every other day. D'you know, I believe you're just
the person I want," she said, as they sat down, "to help me complete
her education? She's been brought up practically in a nunnery.
Her father's too absurd. I've been doing what I can&mdash;but I'm too
old, and I'm a woman. Why shouldn't you talk to her&mdash;explain things
to her&mdash;talk to her, I mean, as you talk to me?"</p>

<p>"I have made one attempt already this evening," said St. John.
"I rather doubt that it was successful. She seems to me so very
young and inexperienced. I have promised to lend her Gibbon."</p>

<p>"It's not Gibbon exactly," Helen pondered. "It's the facts of
life, I think&mdash;d'you see what I mean? What really goes on, what
people feel, although they generally try to hide it? There's nothing
to be frightened of. It's so much more beautiful than the pretences&mdash;always
more interesting&mdash;always better, I should say, than <em>that</em>
kind of thing."</p>

<p>She nodded her head at a table near them, where two girls and
two young men were chaffing each other very loudly, and carrying
on an arch insinuating dialogue, sprinkled with endearments, about,
it seemed, a pair of stockings or a pair of legs. One of the girls
was flirting a fan and pretending to be shocked, and the sight
was very unpleasant, partly because it was obvious that the girls
were secretly hostile to each other.</p>

<p>"In my old age, however," Helen sighed, "I'm coming to think
that it doesn't much matter in the long run what one does: people
always go their own way&mdash;nothing will ever influence them." She
nodded her head at the supper party.</p>

<p>But St. John did not agree. He said that he thought one could
really make a great deal of difference by one's point of view,
books and so on, and added that few things at the present time
mattered more than the enlightenment of women. He sometimes thought
that almost everything was due to education.</p>

<p>In the ballroom, meanwhile, the dancers were being formed into
squares for the lancers. Arthur and Rachel, Susan and Hewet, Miss
Allan and Hughling Elliot found themselves together.</p>

<p>Miss Allan looked at her watch.</p>

<p>"Half-past one," she stated. "And I have to despatch Alexander
Pope to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Pope!" snorted Mr. Elliot. "Who reads Pope, I should like to
know? And as for reading about him &mdash;No, no, Miss Allan;
be persuaded you will benefit the world much more by dancing than
by writing." It was one of Mr. Elliot's affectations that nothing
in the world could compare with the delights of dancing&mdash;nothing
in the world was so tedious as literature. Thus he sought pathetically
enough to ingratiate himself with the young, and to prove to them
beyond a doubt that though married to a ninny of a wife, and rather
pale and bent and careworn by his weight of learning, he was as
much alive as the youngest of them all.</p>

<p>"It's a question of bread and butter," said Miss Allan calmly.
"However, they seem to expect me." She took up her position and
pointed a square black toe.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hewet, you bow to me." It was evident at once that Miss
Allan was the only one of them who had a thoroughly sound knowledge
of the figures of the dance.</p>

<p>After the lancers there was a waltz; after the waltz a polka;
and then a terrible thing happened; the music, which had been
sounding regularly with five-minute pauses, stopped suddenly.
The lady with the great dark eyes began to swathe her violin in
silk, and the gentleman placed his horn carefully in its case.
They were surrounded by couples imploring them in English, in
French, in Spanish, of one more dance, one only; it was still
early. But the old man at the piano merely exhibited his watch
and shook his head. He turned up the collar of his coat and produced
a red silk muffler, which completely dashed his festive appearance.
Strange as it seemed, the musicians were pale and heavy-eyed;
they looked bored and prosaic, as if the summit of their desire
was cold meat and beer, succeeded immediately by bed.</p>

<p>Rachel was one of those who had begged them to continue. When
they refused she began turning over the sheets of dance music
which lay upon the piano. The pieces were generally bound in coloured
covers, with pictures on them of romantic scenes&mdash;gondoliers astride
on the crescent of the moon, nuns peering through the bars of
a convent window, or young women with their hair down pointing
a gun at the stars. She remembered that the general effect of
the music to which they had danced so gaily was one of passionate
regret for dead love and the innocent years of youth; dreadful
sorrows had always separated the dancers from their past happiness.</p>

<p>"No wonder they get sick of playing stuff like this," she remarked
reading a bar or two; "they're really hymn tunes, played very
fast, with bits out of Wagner and Beethoven."</p>

<p>"Do you play? Would you play? Anything, so long as we can dance
to it!" From all sides her gift for playing the piano was insisted
upon, and she had to consent. As very soon she had played the
only pieces of dance music she could remember, she went on to
play an air from a sonata by Mozart.</p>

<p>"But that's not a dance," said some one pausing by the piano.</p>

<p>"It is," she replied, emphatically nodding her head. "Invent
the steps." Sure of her melody she marked the rhythm boldly so
as to simplify the way. Helen caught the idea; seized Miss Allan
by the arm, and whirled round the room, now curtseying, now spinning
round, now tripping this way and that like a child skipping through
a meadow.</p>

<p>"This is the dance for people who don't know how to dance!" she
cried. The tune changed to a minuet; St. John hopped with incredible
swiftness first on his left leg, then on his right; the tune flowed
melodiously; Hewet, swaying his arms and holding out the tails
of his coat, swam down the room in imitation of the voluptuous
dreamy dance of an Indian maiden dancing before her Rajah. The
tune marched; and Miss Allen advanced with skirts extended and
bowed profoundly to the engaged pair. Once their feet fell in
with the rhythm they showed a complete lack of self-consciousness.
From Mozart Rachel passed without stopping to old English hunting
songs, carols, and hymn tunes, for, as she had observed, any good
tune, with a little management, became a tune one could dance
to. By degrees every person in the room was tripping and turning
in pairs or alone. Mr. Pepper executed an ingenious pointed step
derived from figure-skating, for which he once held some local
championship; while Mrs. Thornbury tried to recall an old country
dance which she had seen danced by her father's tenants in Dorsetshire
in the old days. As for Mr. and Mrs. Elliot, they gallopaded round
and round the room with such impetuosity that the other dancers
shivered at their approach. Some people were heard to criticise
the performance as a romp; to others it was the most enjoyable
part of the evening.</p>

<p>"Now for the great round dance!" Hewet shouted. Instantly a gigantic
circle was formed, the dancers holding hands and shouting out,
"D'you ken John Peel," as they swung faster and faster and faster,
until the strain was too great, and one link of the chain &mdash;Mrs.
Thornbury&mdash;gave way, and the rest went flying across the room
in all directions, to land upon the floor or the chairs or in
each other's arms as seemed most convenient.</p>

<p>Rising from these positions, breathless and unkempt, it struck
them for the first time that the electric lights pricked the air
very vainly, and instinctively a great many eyes turned to the
windows. Yes&mdash;there was the dawn. While they had been dancing
the night had passed, and it had come. Outside, the mountains
showed very pure and remote; the dew was sparkling on the grass,
and the sky was flushed with blue, save for the pale yellows and
pinks in the East. The dancers came crowding to the windows, pushed
them open, and here and there ventured a foot upon the grass.</p>

<p>"How silly the poor old lights look!" said Evelyn M. in a curiously
subdued tone of voice. "And ourselves; it isn't becoming." It
was true; the untidy hair, and the green and yellow gems, which
had seemed so festive half an hour ago, now looked cheap and slovenly.
The complexions of the elder ladies suffered terribly, and, as
if conscious that a cold eye had been turned upon them, they began
to say good-night and to make their way up to bed.</p>

<p>Rachel, though robbed of her audience, had gone on playing to
herself. From John Peel she passed to Bach, who was at this time
the subject of her intense enthusiasm, and one by one some of
the younger dancers came in from the garden and sat upon the deserted
gilt chairs round the piano, the room being now so clear that
they turned out the lights. As they sat and listened, their nerves
were quieted; the heat and soreness of their lips, the result
of incessant talking and laughing, was smoothed away. They sat
very still as if they saw a building with spaces and columns succeeding
each other rising in the empty space. Then they began to see themselves
and their lives, and the whole of human life advancing very nobly
under the direction of the music. They felt themselves ennobled,
and when Rachel stopped playing they desired nothing but sleep.</p>

<p>Susan rose. "I think this has been the happiest night of my life!"
she exclaimed. "I do adore music," she said, as she thanked Rachel.
"It just seems to say all the things one can't say oneself." She
gave a nervous little laugh and looked from one to another with
great benignity, as though she would like to say something but
could not find the words in which to express it. "Every one's
been so kind&mdash;so very kind," she said. Then she too went to bed.</p>

<p>The party having ended in the very abrupt way in which parties
do end, Helen and Rachel stood by the door with their cloaks on,
looking for a carriage.</p>

<p>"I suppose you realise that there are no carriages left?" said
St. John, who had been out to look. "You must sleep here."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Helen; "we shall walk."</p>

<p>"May we come too?" Hewet asked. "We can't go to bed. Imagine
lying among bolsters and looking at one's washstand on a morning
like this &mdash;Is that where you live?" They had begun to walk
down the avenue, and he turned and pointed at the white and green
villa on the hillside, which seemed to have its eyes shut.</p>

<p>"That's not a light burning, is it?" Helen asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"It's the sun," said St. John. The upper windows had each a spot
of gold on them.</p>

<p>"I was afraid it was my husband, still reading Greek," she said.
"All this time he's been editing <em>Pindar</em>."</p>

<p>They passed through the town and turned up the steep road, which
was perfectly clear, though still unbordered by shadows. Partly
because they were tired, and partly because the early light subdued
them, they scarcely spoke, but breathed in the delicious fresh
air, which seemed to belong to a different state of life from
the air at midday. When they came to the high yellow wall, where
the lane turned off from the road, Helen was for dismissing the
two young men.</p>

<p>"You've come far enough," she said. "Go back to bed."</p>

<p>But they seemed unwilling to move.</p>

<p>"Let's sit down a moment," said Hewet. He spread his coat on
the ground. "Let's sit down and consider." They sat down and looked
out over the bay; it was very still, the sea was rippling faintly,
and lines of green and blue were beginning to stripe it. There
were no sailing boats as yet, but a steamer was anchored in the
bay, looking very ghostly in the mist; it gave one unearthly cry,
and then all was silent.</p>

<p>Rachel occupied herself in collecting one grey stone after another
and building them into a little cairn; she did it very quietly
and carefully.</p>

<p>"And so you've changed your view of life, Rachel?" said Helen.</p>

<p>Rachel added another stone and yawned. "I don't remember," she
said, "I feel like a fish at the bottom of the sea." She yawned
again. None of these people possessed any power to frighten her
out here in the dawn, and she felt perfectly familiar even with
Mr. Hirst.</p>

<p>"My brain, on the contrary," said Hirst, "is in a condition of
abnormal activity." He sat in his favourite position with his
arms binding his legs together and his chin resting on the top
of his knees. "I see through everything&mdash;absolutely everything.
Life has no more mysteries for me." He spoke with conviction,
but did not appear to wish for an answer. Near though they sat,
and familiar though they felt, they seemed mere shadows to each
other.</p>

<p>"And all those people down there going to sleep," Hewet began
dreamily, "thinking such different things, &mdash;Miss Warrington,
I suppose, is now on her knees; the Elliots are a little startled,
it's not often <em>they</em> get out of breath, and they want
to get to sleep as quickly as possible; then there's the poor
lean young man who danced all night with Evelyn; he's putting
his flower in water and asking himself, 'Is this love?'&mdash;and poor
old Perrott, I daresay, can't get to sleep at all, and is reading
his favourite Greek book to console himself&mdash;and the others&mdash;no,
Hirst," he wound up, "I don't find it simple at all."</p>

<p>"I have a key," said Hirst cryptically. His chin was still upon
his knees and his eyes fixed in front of him.</p>

<p>A silence followed. Then Helen rose and bade them good-night.
"But," she said, "remember that you've got to come and see us."</p>

<p>They waved good-night and parted, but the two young men did not
go back to the hotel; they went for a walk, during which they
scarcely spoke, and never mentioned the names of the two women,
who were, to a considerable extent, the subject of their thoughts.
They did not wish to share their impressions. They returned to
the hotel in time for breakfast.</p>
