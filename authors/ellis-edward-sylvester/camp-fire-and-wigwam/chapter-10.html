<p>It would be hard to measure the effect of the little achievement
of Jack Carleton upon the Indians who held him captive. He had
pronounced the name of the chieftain with such clearness that
every one recognized it. After all it was no great exploit, and
it may have been the red men feigned a goodly portion of the astonishment
they seemed to feel.</p>

<p>Jack did not make any more essays in that direction, and a few
minutes later the vagabonds gave their principal attention to
their pipes. One of them gathered an armful of brush and flung
it on the fire; and another, rising to his feet, turned his back
toward the blaze with his hands together behind him, as though
the warmth was very pleasant. While he stood thus, he held the
stem of his pipe in his mouth and looked absently at the boy,
who could not see the face of the red man with much distinctness,
as it was in shadow.</p>

<p>The fuel just thrown on the flames increased the warmth to such
a degree that those who were the nearest shifted their position.
The warrior who was on his feet stepped forward a single pace,
and was still standing in his idle fashion with his hands half
folded behind him, when a spark flew outward with a snap, and
dropped down the neck of the unsuspicious red man. When he felt
the burn, like the thrust of a big needle, he sprang several feet
in the air, and began frantically clutching at the tormenting
substance. The second or third attempt secured the spark, which
clung to his hand, burning his fingers to that extent that he
emitted a rasping exclamation, bounded upward, and by a particularly
vigorous flirt of his hand freed it of the spark, which then expired
of itself.</p>

<p>As I have said, no man has less humor in his composition than
the North American Indian, and yet it is not by any means lacking
in him. It assumes odd forms at times, and too often seems based
on the physical suffering of some person or animal; but in the
instance of which I am speaking, every one of the spectators was
filled with mirth. The laughter shook them from head to foot,
though with all its vigor it could not have been heard fifty feet
away.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton had been so long depressed that something like
a reaction came over him. He threw his head back and the woods
rang with his hearty mirth as they never rang before. If there
was any one else within half a mile, he must have wondered what
all the uproar meant.</p>

<p>The cause of this amusement conducted himself very much like
a civilized being. When he had rubbed the blistered spot on the
back of his neck with the scorched hand, he glared angrily at
the others, as if he saw no adequate cause for the unusual mirth;
then when it broke out afresh, he made a weak attempt to join
in, but failing to do so, he sullenly seated himself on the ground
and looked as glum as a man meditating some wicked deed.</p>

<p>All at once, he turned toward Jack Carleton with such a fierce
scowl that the boy was sobered. He believed with reason that the
Indian was ready to leap upon him with his knife, punishing him
in that dreadful manner for the provocation he felt toward the
rest.</p>

<p>"I guess I have laughed enough," was the prudent thought of the
boy, who straightway tried to look as if he sympathized with the
red man for his slight misfortune.</p>

<p>Jack could not tell how well he succeeded in imparting a pitying
expression to his countenance, but all disposition to laugh at
the warrior's mishap had departed, and it is not improbable that
the youth owed his life to the fact.</p>

<p>Although the overflowing mirth soon ended, there were a number
of smiles on the faces of the warriors for a long time afterward,
doubtless caused by the remembrance of the laughable performance
earlier in the evening.</p>

<p>As the halt was for the night, the boy could hardly suppress
his curiosity to see what shape matters would take. His strong
hope was that he would be allowed to lie where he then sat, and
that none of the warriors would arrange it so he could not change
his position without awaking him.</p>

<p>It looked as if the prayer of Jack was to be granted. More wood
was thrown on the fire, and the Indians took but a brief time
to dispose themselves for slumber. The pipes were laid away, their
guns examined, and each placed his weapon alongside of him, as
though it was his intimate friend, from whose body he expected
to obtain the warmth to keep him comfortable through the night.
The savage who held Jack's gun was the only silent and reserved
member of the party. The boy had heard him utter less than half
a dozen words since the journey began. He was shorter and more
squatty than the others, and his whole aim in life appeared to
be a desire to please Ogallah, their chief. During the hilarity
that reigned a short time before, he had grinned at his companion,
but his mirth was less hearty than that of the rest.</p>

<p>The blankets were spread out on the leaves to their fullest extent,
and then the warriors lay down, with their backs against each
other and their moccasins pointing toward the fire. Then the covering
was gathered up in front of each and flung over behind, where
the folds interlapped, all that remained visible being a part
of the black hair and the feathers in the crowns of the warriors,
who seemed to find not the least difficulty in breathing with
their heads swathed and bandaged up like a wounded limb.</p>

<p>Two couples were thus formed, who were separated by the space
of six or eight feet, while a rod beyond burned the camp-fire
against the shaggy trunk of the oak. The intervening area and
some distance away was lighted by the flames which had eaten into
the bark, until the solid wood beneath was charred and blackened
by the heat. Ogallah, the chief, strode to a point midway between
the fire and the couples, flung his blanket on the ground, and,
pointing down to it, motioned to Jack Carleton to come forward
and use it for his couch.</p>

<p>This was not the most agreeable order to receive, but it might
have been much worse, and he obeyed with a readiness that looked
genuine, though it could not have been entirely so. Jack nodded
to the chief, as he took his seat and gathered the heavy folds
around him, lay down on his right side, with his face toward the
fire. Ogallah looked at the lad, whose knees almost touched his
chin, and muttering to himself, walked back to the oak and sat
with his back against it, his feet close to his body and his arms
folded in front.</p>

<p>The chief was about one-fourth of the way around the oak from
the camp-fire, so that the light revealed his entire left side,
and his not very attractive profile, the whole being thrown against
the blank darkness beyond, which shut the rest of his body from
view. This proceeding indicated that Ogallah meant to act the
part of sentinel while his warriors slept. He did not require
the blanket, as would have been the case had he lain down to slumber,
and he was magnanimous enough, therefore, to turn it over the
captive, who would have been as well pleased never to touch it.</p>

<p>It cannot be supposed that the sachem and his warriors were in
any fear of disturbance during the darkness, for they were in
a country with which they were familiar, and they knew no dangerous
enemies were within many miles of them. Had they met a party belonging
to another tribe, more than likely the two, as a matter of principle,
would have fallen upon each other like so many tigers; but none
of their own race was hunting for them, and the white settlers
were altogether out of the question. But the possibility of peril&mdash;remote
though it might be&mdash;always hangs over the hunter, as indeed it
does over us all, and the red men had no thought of trusting themselves
to slumber without one of their number standing guard over the
rest.</p>

<p>Sleep is so insidious in its approach that the sentry, as a usual
thing, can only fight it off by incessant action. So long as he
paces back and forth, his senses stay with him, but when he sits
down a minute or so to rest, unconsciousness is sure to come.
But Ogallah would not have assumed the easy position had he not
felt sure of his self-control. It will be perceived that he had
so placed himself that he had a perfect view of the camp, while
he could see all that was possible of the surrounding gloom. If
required, he could use the oak as a shield, and only a slight
signal was needed on his part to rouse the sleeping warriors to
instant wakefulness.</p>

<p>"Now, if he keeps awake," thought Jack Carleton, peeping through
the folds of his blanket with his half-closed eyes, "it don't
look as though there will be much chance for me, but if he drops
into a doze I may slip off, and I won't need much of a start to
get away from him."</p>

<p>The most natural query would be as to which was more likely to
fall asleep&mdash;the Indian or the boy. Ordinarily a youngster like
Jack would have been no match for the warrior, who had been trained
to privation, suffering, hardship, self-denial and watchfulness
from his earliest infancy; but it need not be said that the state
of one's mind has everything to do with his ability to slumber
and secure rest therefrom. Ogallah was mentally quiet; he had
gone through a severe tramp, but no more so than had been the
case hundreds of times, and he was accustomed to sleep at that
hour. Such was the case also with Jack Carleton, but he was in
a fever of hope and nervousness, which made it hard for him to
hold his eyes partly closed in his effort to counterfeit unconsciousness.
It was accepted as a matter of course that the four warriors who
were lying down would speedily glide into the land of dreams,
since such was their wish. Slight as is the noise which is sufficient
to rouse a sleeping Indian, young Carleton would have felt no
misgiving respecting those so near him; it was Ogallah, the sentinel
chieftain, whom he feared.</p>

<p>"If he suspects that I mean to try something of the kind," was
the conclusion of Jack, "he will not close his eyes any longer
than to wink. But I'll watch him."</p>

<p>This task which the boy set himself was of the most trying nature.
Had his mind been composed he would have fallen asleep within
five minutes, but he was never more wide awake in all his life
than he was two hours after he had lain down with the Indian blanket
wrapped about him, and his face toward the camp-fire.</p>

<p>During that period, so far as he was able to see, the Indian
had not moved so much as a muscle, and Jack himself had done very
little more. Lying on his right side, with his arm doubled under
him for a pillow, the cumbrous blanket enclosing him from head
to foot, an irregular opening in front of his face allowed him
to peer through the folds at the camp-fire, the oak, and the chieftain.
The last still sat leaning slightly backward, with his shoulders
against the trunk, his arms folded over his knees, while he seemed
to be gazing off into vacancy. The heels of his moccasins remained
close against the thighs, so that the form of the Indian bore
quite a resemblance to the letter N.</p>

<p>The flickering light from the camp-fire disclosed as it did at
first, the side and profile of the chieftain. Gradually the flames
sank lower and there came moments when the sentinel was scarcely
visible. Then, all at once, the fire would flare up for a few
seconds and the figure would be in brighter relief than before.
Again the eyes of Jack would rebel against the extreme tension
to which they were subjected. The Indian, instead of remaining
with his back against the oak, would seem to be hitching forward
and upward in the most grotesque fashion. After bumping about
in the air for a time, he would sink, still bumping, to the ground,
where he would hitch backward to his place by the tree. Then the
latter, instead of standing as motionless as a rock, showed signs
of restlessness. It would begin by swaying back and forth until
it too was waltzing in an unearthly fashion around the camp-fire.
Again the surrounding gloom became studded with blinking stars,
ogres and the most grotesque figures, which performed in an indescribable
fashion. Darkness and light alternated, until the boy feared he
was losing the power of vision altogether; but it will be understood
that this was the natural protest of the eye against the painful
and long continued strain to which it was subjected.</p>
