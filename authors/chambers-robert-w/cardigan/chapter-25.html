<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>We were condemned to death without a hearing by a military court
sitting at Fort Hill, before which we appeared in chains. The
19th of April was set for our execution; we were taken back to
the south battery in a coach escorted by light horse, and from
there conveyed through the falling snow to the brick prison on
Queen Street.</p>

<p>This time, however, we were not led into the loathsome "Pirates'
Chapel," but the jailers conducted us to the upper tier of the
prison, recently finished, and from the barred windows of which
we could look out into Long Acre and School Street across the
eight gibbets to the King's Chapel. It appeared that England treated
condemned highwaymen with more humanity than coast pirates, for
our cells were clean and not very cold, and our food was partly
butcher's meat. Besides this, they allowed us a gill of rum every
three days, an ounce of tobacco once every twenty-four hours,
and finally unlocked our irons, leaving us without manacles, in
order that the sores on our necks, wrists, and legs might heal.</p>

<p>It was now the 1st of January, 1775. The New Year brought changes
to the prison, but the most important change, for us, was the
appointment of Billy Bishop as warden of our tier, to replace
Samuel Craft, now promoted to chief warden in the military prison
on Boston Neck.</p>

<p>The warden, his wife, and his children occupied the apartment
at the west end of our corridor; and the day that Craft, the former
warden, moved out, and the Bishop family moved in, I believed
firmly that at last our fighting chance for life had come.</p>

<p>All day long I watched the famous thief-taker installing his
family in their new dwelling-place; doubtless Mount also noted
everything from his cell, but I could not communicate with him
without raising my voice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bishop, a blowsy slattern with a sickly, nursing child,
sat on a bundle of feather bedding and directed her buxom daughter
where to place the furniture. The wench had lost her bright colour,
and something, too, in flesh. Her features had become thinner,
clean-cut, almost fine, though her lips still curved in that sensual
pout which so repels me in man or woman.</p>

<p>That she knew Mount was here under sentence of death was certain;
I could see the sorrowful glances she stole at the grating of
his cell as she passed it, her bare, round arms loaded with household
utensils. And once her face burned vivid as she stole by, doubtless
meeting Mount's eyes for the first time since he had bent in his
saddle and kissed her in the dark mews behind the "Virginia Arms"&mdash;so
long, so long ago!</p>

<p>All day the thief-taker's family were busied in their new quarters,
and all day long the girl passed and repassed our cells, sometimes
with a fearful side glance at the gratings, sometimes with bent
head and lips compressed.</p>

<p>My heart began singing as I watched her. Surely, here was aid
for us&mdash;for one of us at all events.</p>

<p>The early winter night fell, darkening our cells and the corridor
outside; anon I heard Bishop bawling for candle and box, and I
looked out of my grating into the darkening corridor, where the
thief-taker was stumping along the entry bearing an empty candle-stick.
Mrs. Bishop followed with the baby; she and her husband had fallen
to disputing in strident tones, charging each other with the loss
of the candles. As they passed my cell I moved back; then, as
I heard their voices growing fainter and fainter down the corridor,
I stepped swiftly forward and pressed my face to the grating.
Dulcima Bishop stood within two feet of my cell.</p>

<p>"Will you speak to me?" I called, cautiously.</p>

<p>"La! Is it you, sir?" she stammered, all a-tremble.</p>

<p>"Yes; come quickly, child! There, stand with your back to my
cell. Are you listening?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," she faltered.</p>

<p>"Do you still love Jack Mount?" I asked.</p>

<p>Her neck under her hair crimsoned.</p>

<p>"Will you help him?" I demanded, under my breath.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, yes," she whispered, turning swiftly towards my grating.
"Tell me what to do, sir! I knew he was here; I saw him once in
the 'Chapel,' but they boxed my ears for peeping&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Turn your back," I cut in; "don't look at my grating again.
Now, listen! This is the 1st of January. We are to die at dawn
on the 19th of April. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You are to get us out, do you understand, child?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;oh yes, yes! How, Mr. Cardigan? Tell me and I'll do it;
truly, I will!"</p>

<p>"Then go to Jack's cell and let him talk to you. And have a care
they do not catch you gossiping with prisoners!"</p>

<p>The girl glanced up and down the corridor; a deeper wave of red
stained her face, but already I heard Mount calling her in a cautious
voice, and she went, timidly, with lowered eyes.</p>

<p>I laid my ear to the grating and listened; they were whispering,
and I could not hear what they said. Once an echoing step in the
entry sent the girl flying across the corridor into her room,
but it was only a night keeper on his rounds, and he went on quickly,
tapping the lock of each cell as he passed. When the glimmer of
his lanthorn died away in the farther passages, the girl flew
back to Mount's grating. I listened and watched for a sign of
Bishop and his wife.</p>

<p>"Jack," I called out in a low voice, "tell her to find Shemuel
if she can."</p>

<p>"Quiet, lad," he answered; "I know what is to be done."</p>

<p>Before I could speak again, a distant sound warned the girl to
her room once more; presently Bishop came stumping back, holding
a lighted candle and still disputing with his slattern wife.</p>

<p>"You did! I tell you I seen you!" he grunted. "You left them
candles in the wood-box."</p>

<p>"Well, why didn't you say so before you tore up all the parcels?"
demanded his wife, shrilly.</p>

<p>"Oh, quit your nagging!" he snarled. "All the rogues in the prison
will be laughing at you!"</p>

<p>"Let 'em laugh! Let 'em laugh!" she panted, waddling along furiously
beside him; "I can't help it. I know I married a fool. Bishop,
you're a fool, and you know it, and everybody knows it, so don't
pick on me, for I won't have it!"</p>

<p>I saw the termagant as she passed my door, tagging after the
thief-taker, who looked surly enough, but evidently was no match
for the dirty shrew at his heels. How pitiful and petty their
anger to a man in the shadow of death! But their wrangling voices
were presently shut out as their door slammed. I waited a while,
but heard nothing more, so took myself off to the corner, there
to lie on my iron cot and try to think.</p>

<p>A young moon hung over King's Chapel, shedding a tremulous light
on the snowy parade. Very dimly I could make out the tall shapes
of eight gibbets, stark and black against the starry sky. There
was no wind; the pendent bundles of bones and chains which hung
from each gibbet did not sway as they had swayed that morning
in a flurry of wind-driven snow, while the brazen drums of the
marines played eight souls into hell eternal.</p>

<p>I watched the stars, peacefully, thinking of the stars that lighted
our misty hills in Johnstown; I thought of Silver Heels and my
love for her, and how, by this time, she must deem me the most
dishonourable and craven among men. I thought of this calmly;
long since I had weathered the storms of grief and rage impotent,
which had torn me with their violence night after night as I lay
in chains in the "Chapel."</p>

<p>No; all would yet be well; some day I should hold her in my arms.
All would be well; some day I should hold the life of Walter Butler
on my sword's point, and send his red soul howling! Yes, all would
be well&mdash;</p>

<p>A ray of light fell on my face; I turned and sat up on the edge
of my cot as the key in the cell door gritted.</p>

<p>Full under the flare of a lanthorn stood a man in a military
uniform of scarlet and green. Behind him appeared Warden Bishop,
holding the lanthorn.</p>

<p>"This is the Weasel, sir," he said, "at least he goes by that
name, although the Weasel I have chased these ten years was a
different cut of a rogue. But it's all one, captain; he was took
with Jack Mount, and he'll dance a rope-jig the 19th of April
next."</p>

<p>"Why not sooner?" asked the officer, gravely.</p>

<p>I started, quivering in every limb.</p>

<p>"Why not hang him sooner?" inquired Walter Butler, moving back
a step into the corridor. He limped as he walked and leaned on
a cane. My mark was still upon him.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Bishop, scratching his ears, "we hung eight
coast-scrapers in November, and two sheep-thieves in December.
We've got three pickpockets to swing this month, then Symonds,
the wharf-robber, is to go in February. There's no room in March
either, because the Santa Cruz gang goes up the 13th&mdash;seven o'
them in chains&mdash;and the gallows yonder ain't dropped last year's
fruit yet, and the people hereabouts complains o' the stench of
a hot day and a south wind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can't he change places with some other rogue?" interrupted Butler,
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Lord, no!" cried Bishop, horrified. "Leastways, not unless the
court-martial directs it, sir. They don't do no such things in
Boston, sir."</p>

<p>"They do in Tryon County," observed Butler, eying me coolly.
Presently a ghastly smile stretched his pallid face, but his yellow
eyes glared unchanging.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he said, "so you are to sail to glory at a rope's
end, eh? You wouldn't burn, you know. But the flames will come
later, I fancy. Eh, Mr.&mdash;er &mdash;Mr. Weasel?"</p>

<p>"Are your broken bones mended?" I asked, quietly.</p>

<p>"Quite mended, thank you."</p>

<p>"Because," I said, "you will need them some day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I need them now," he said, cheerfully; "I am to wed a bride
ere long. Give me joy, Weasel! I am to know the day this very
night."</p>

<p>I could not utter a sound for the horror which froze my tongue.
He saw it; fastened his eyes on my face, and watched me, silent
as a snake with its fangs in its paralyzed prey.</p>

<p>"Would you care to see the famous Jack Mount, captain?" asked
Bishop, swelling with pride. "I took him myself, sir. All the
papers had it &mdash;I have the cuttings in my room; I can fetch
them, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>Butler did not appear to hear him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he continued, thoughtfully, "I ride this night to Lexington.
She's a sweet little thing&mdash;a trifle skinny, perhaps. I think
you have seen her&mdash;perhaps picked her pocket. When we are wed
we shall come to Boston&mdash;on the 19th of April next."</p>

<p>I sprang at him; I had gone stone-blind with rage, and knew not
what I did; the steel door crashed in my face; the locks rattled.</p>

<p>Outside the door I heard Butler's cool voice, continuing: "But
if she pleases me not, to-night, I may change my mind and take
her for my mistress&mdash;as Sir William took your aunt&mdash;as my friend
General Gage has taken your old sweetheart, Mrs. Hamilton. One
wench is like another in silken petticoats. Sleep soundly, Master
Weasel. If I find her too thin for my taste I'll leave her for
Dunmore."</p>

<p>All that night I lay on the stone floor of my cell, by turns
inert, stupid, frantic.</p>

<p>When Bishop came to me in the morning he thought me ill and summoned
the prison apothecary to cup me; but ere that individual appeared
with his pills and leeches, I was quiet and self-possessed, ready
to argue with the pill-roller and convince him I needed no nostrums.
All that day I watched for Dulcima; twice I saw her go to Mount's
cell, but could hear nothing of what they whispered.</p>

<p>Now as I was standing, looking out of the grating, I chanced
to glance down, and saw that the apothecary had left his case
of herbs and drugs on a bench which stood just outside my cell
door.</p>

<p>Idly I read the labels on the bottles and boxes: "Senna, Jalap,
Brimstone, Es. Cammomile, Saffron Pills, Tinc. Opium&mdash;"</p>

<p>Opium? An easy death.</p>

<p>I gazed at the dark flask, scarcely a foot below me, but as safe
from me as though under lock and key. Presently I turned around;
my cell contained a cot, an iron table, a bowl for washing, and
a towel.</p>

<p>After a moment's thought I caught up the coarse towel, drew from
it some threads, twisted them, tied on more threads, and then,
greasing the cord with a bit of soap, made a running noose at
the end.</p>

<p>There was nobody in the corridor. I heard voices in Bishop's
room, whither the apothecary had gone to examine the baby at Mrs.
Bishop's summons. Very carefully I let down my thread, fishing
for the bottle's neck with my slip-noose; but the neck was so
placed that I could not snare it, and I drew up another bottle
instead, bearing the label: "<em>Ex. S. Nigrum</em>."</p>

<p>What <em>Ex. S. Nigrum</em> might be I did not know, but hid
the tiny flask under a loose fragment of stone in my flooring
where a black beetle had his abode. Scooping out for it a little
hole in the damp earth, I buried it, not harming my friend the
beetle; then I returned to fish for my opium flask, but could
not snare it. Finally I drew in my string just as the apothecary
came out with Mrs. Bishop at his heels.</p>

<p>He stood a moment, talking, then picked up his cow-hide case,
closed it, and took himself off.</p>

<p>That night, when the corridor was dusky and Bishop sprawled outside
his door to smoke his evening pipe, I called to him and asked
him for a jug of water. He fetched it and seemed disposed to linger
and chat a bit, but I was uncommunicative, and presently he left
me to my own devices, lighting the lanthorn in the corridor ere
he retired to his room with his long pipe.</p>

<p>I now unearthed my flask containing the <em>Ex. S. Nigrum</em>,
poured a single drop into my basin, filled it up with water, and
then returned the flask to its hiding-place.</p>

<p>"We shall see," I muttered, "whether there be any virtue of poison
in my <em>Nigrum</em>," and I caught the poor little black beetle
who had come out to enjoy the lamplight.</p>

<p>Now as the drop of <em>Ex. S. Nigrum</em> had been diluted many
hundreds of times by the water in my bowl, I argued that, if this
solution dealt death to the beetle, a few drops, pure, would put
Jack Mount and me beyond the hangman's hands.</p>

<p>Poor little beetle! how he struggled! I was loath to sacrifice
him, but at last I dropped him into the bowl.</p>

<p>He did not swim; I watched him for a moment, and finally touched
him. The little thing was stone dead.</p>

<p>That I had a terrible and swift poison in my possession I now
believed; and my belief became certainty when the apothecary came
next day in a panic, crying out to Bishop that he had lost a flask
of nightshade syrup, and feared lest the infant might find it
and swallow the poison.</p>

<p>I watched Bishop and his wife rummaging their rooms in a spasm
of panic, and finally saw them go off with the puling pill-roller
to report the loss to the head warden.</p>

<p>Later that day a turnkey searched my cell, but did not see the
cracked corner of the stone slab, which I covered with one foot.</p>

<p>When all was quiet, I called to Dulcima and bade her tell Jack
Mount that I had the poison and would use it on us both if we
could not find other means to escape the gallows.</p>

<p>The poor child took the message, and presently returned, wiping
her tears, to say that Jack had every hope of liberty; that I
must not despair or take the life which no longer was at my own
disposal, and that she, Dulcima, had already communicated with
Shemuel.</p>

<p>She handed me a steel awl, telling me to pick at the mortar which
held the stones on my window-ledge, and to fill these holes with
water every night, so that the water might freeze and crack the
stones around the base of the steel bars.</p>

<p>I had never thought of such a thing! I had often seen the work
of frost on stones, but to take advantage of nature in this manner
never occurred to me.</p>

<p>Eagerly and cautiously I set to work with my little steel pick,
to drill what holes I might before Bishop came. But it was heart-breaking
labour, and so slow that at the end of a week I had not loosened
a single bar.</p>

<p>The next week the weather was bitterly cold. I had drilled some
few holes around the base of an iron stanchion, and now I filled
them with water and plugged them with a paste of earth from beneath
my flooring, threads from my towel, and some soap.</p>

<p>At dawn I was at my window, and to my delight found the stone
cracked; but the iron bar was as firm as ever, so I set to drilling
my holes deeper.</p>

<p>At the end of that week Dulcima let me know that Jack had loosened
one bar of his window, and could take it from its socket whenever
I was ready. So I worked like a madman at my bar, and by night
was ready to charge the holes with water.</p>

<p>It was now the middle of March; a month only remained to us in
which to accomplish our liberty, if we were to escape at all.</p>

<p>That night I lay awake, rising constantly to examine my work,
but to my despair the weather had slowly changed, and a warm thaw
set in, with rain and the glimmer of distant lightning. In vain
I worked at my bar; I could see the dark sky brighten with lightning;
presently the low mutter of thunder followed. An hour later the
rain fell hissing into the melting snow in the prison yard.</p>

<p>I sent word to Mount that I could not move my bar, but that he
must not wait for me if he could escape from the window. He answered
that he would not stir a peg unless I could; and the girl choked
as she delivered the message, imploring me to hasten and loose
the bar.</p>

<p>I could not do it; day after day I filled the cracks and holes,
waiting for freezing weather. It rained, rained, rained.</p>

<p>Weeks before, Mount had sent the girl to seek out Mr. Foxcroft
and tell him of my plight. I also had sent by her a note to Silver
Heels.</p>

<p>The girl returned to report that Mr. Foxcroft had sailed for
England early in November, and that nobody there had ever heard
of a Miss Warren in Queen Street.</p>

<p>Then Butler's boast came to me, and I sent word to Shemuel, bidding
him search the village of Lexington for Miss Warren. I had not
yet heard from him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mount communicated, through Dulcima, with the Minute
Men's Club, and already a delegation headed by Mr. Revere had
waited on Governor Gage to demand my release on grounds of mistaken
identity.</p>

<p>The Governor laughed at them, asserting that I was notorious;
but as the days passed, so serious became the demands from Mr.
Revere, Mr. Hancock, and Mr. Otis that the Governor sent Walter
Butler to assure these gentlemen that he knew Mr. Cardigan well,
and that the rogue in prison, who pretended to that name, was,
in fact, a notorious felon named the Weasel, who had for years
held the highway with the arch-rogue, Mount.</p>

<p>At this, Shemuel came forward to swear that Mr. Butler and I
were deadly enemies and that Butler lied, but he was treated with
scant ceremony, and barely escaped a ducking in the mill-pond
by the soldiers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Hancock had communicated with Sir John at Onondaga,
and awaited a reply to his message, urging Sir John to come to
Boston and identify me.</p>

<p>No reply ever came, nor did Sir John stir hand or foot in my
behalf. Possibly he never received the message. I prefer to think
so.</p>

<p>Matters were at this pass when I finally gave up all hope of
loosening my window bars, and sent word to Jack Mount that he
must use his sheets for a cord and let himself out that very night.
But the frightened girl returned with an angry message of refusal
from the chivalrous blockhead.</p>

<p>The next day it was too late; Bishop's suspicions somehow had
been aroused, and it took him but a short time to discover the
loosened bars in Jack Mount's cell.</p>

<p>How the brute did laugh when he came on the work accomplished.
He searched Mount's cell, discovered the awl and a file, shouted
with laughter, summoned masons to make repairs, and, still laughing,
came to visit me.</p>

<p>I had not dared to leave my poison-flask in the hole under the
stone. What to do with it I did not know; but, as I heard Bishop
come chuckling towards my cell, I drove the glass stopper into
the flask firmly as I could, then, wiping it, placed it in my
mouth, together with the small gold ring I had bought in Albany,
and which I had, so far, managed to conceal.</p>

<p>It was a desperate move; I undressed myself as he bade me, and
sat on my bed, faint with suspense, while Bishop rummaged. He
found the hole where I had hidden the flask. The awl lay there,
and he pouched it with a chuckle.</p>

<p>When Bishop had gone, I drew the deadly little flask from my
mouth, trembling, and chilled with sweat. Then I placed it again
in its hiding-place, hid the ring in my shoe, and dressed slowly,
brushing my shabby clothes, and returning the pockets and flaps
which Bishop in his careful search had rifled. He did not search
my cell again.</p>

<p>And now the days began to run very swiftly. On the 18th of April,
towards five o'clock in the evening, a turnkey, passing my cell,
told me that General Gage was in the prison with a party of ladies,
and that he would doubtless visit my cell. He added, grimly, that
the death-watch was to be set over us in an hour or two, and that,
thereafter, I could expect no more visitors from outside until
I held my public reception on the gallows.</p>

<p>Laughing heartily at his own wit, the turnkey passed on about
his business, and I went to the grating to listen and look out
into the twilight of the corridor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bishop, whose sick baby was squalling, lighted the lanthorn
above the door of her room, and retired, leaving me free to converse
with Mount.</p>

<p>"Jack," I called, hoarsely, "the death-watch begins to-night."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" he answered, cheerfully. "Wait a bit; there's time to
cheat a dozen gibbets 'twixt this and dawn."</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, bitterly, "we can cheat the hangman with what
I have in this little flask."</p>

<p>"You must give it to the girl," he said. "She will flavour our
last draught with it if worst comes to worst. She will be here
in a moment."</p>

<p>At that instant I caught sight of Dulcima Bishop, her cloak all
wet with rain, passing quickly along the corridor towards Mount's
cell; and I called her and gave her my flask, glad to have it
safe at least from the search which the death-watch was certain
to make.</p>

<p>The poor child turned pale under the scarlet hood of her witch-cloak
when I bade her promise to serve us with a kinder and more honourable
death than the death planned for us on the morrow.</p>

<p>"I promise, sir," she said, faintly, raising her frightened white
face, framed by the wet cloak and damp strands of hair. She added
timidly: "I have a knife for&mdash;for Jack&mdash;and a file."</p>

<p>"It is too late for such things," I answered, quietly. "If it
is certain that you cannot get the keys from your father, there
is no hope for us."</p>

<p>Her face, which in the past month had become terribly pinched
and thin, quivered; her hands tightened on the edge of the grating.
"If&mdash;if I could get the keys&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"Unless you do so there is no hope, child."</p>

<p>There was a silence; then she cried, in a choking voice: "I can
get them! Will that free Jack? I will get the keys; truly, I will!
Oh, do you think he can go free if I open the cell?"</p>

<p>"He has a knife," I said, grimly; "I have my two hands. Open
the cells and we will show you."</p>

<p>She covered her eyes with her hands. Jack called to her from
his grating; she started violently, turned and went to him.</p>

<p>They stood whispering a long time together. I paced my cell,
with brain a-whirl and hope battering at my heart for the admittance
I craved to give. If she could only open that door!&mdash;that rusted,
accursed mass of iron, the very sight of which was slowly crushing
out the last spark of manhood in me!</p>

<p>"Are you listening?" whispered Dulcima at my grating again.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered.</p>

<p>"Watch our door at seven to-night!" she said. "Be ready. I will
open your door."</p>

<p>"I am ready," I answered.</p>

<p>At that moment the sound of voices filled the corridor; the girl
fled to her room; a dozen turnkeys shuffled past, bowing and cringing,
followed by Collins, the chief warden, an old man whom I had not
before seen. Then came a gentleman dressed in a long dark cloak
which hung from twin epaulettes, his scarlet and gold uniform
gleaming below. Was that the Governor?</p>

<p>He passed my cell, halted, glanced around, then retraced his
steps. After a moment I heard his voice distinctly at some distance
down the corridor; he was saying:</p>

<p>"The highwaymen are here, Mrs. Hamilton&mdash;if&mdash;if you would care
to see them."</p>

<p>I sat up in my cot, all a-tremble. Far down the corridor I heard
a woman laughing. I knew that laugh.</p>

<p>"But," persisted the Governor, "you should really see the highwaymen,
madam. Trust me, you never before beheld such a giant as this
rogue, Jack Mount."</p>

<p>The voices seemed to be receding; I sprang to my grating; the
Governor's bland voice still sounded at some distance down the
passage; Mrs. Hamilton's saucy laughter rang faintly and more
faintly.</p>

<p>Half a dozen keepers were lounging just outside of my cell. I
summoned one of them sharply.</p>

<p>"Tell General Gage that Mrs. Hamilton knows me!" I said. "A guinea
for you when she comes!"</p>

<p>The lout stared, grinned, and finally shambled away, pursued
by the jeers of his comrades. Then they turned their wit against
me, begging to know if I had not some message for my friends the
Grand Turk and the Emperor of China.</p>

<p>I waited in an agony of suspense; after a long time I knew that
the keeper had not delivered my message.</p>

<p>In the fierce returning flood of despair at the loss of this
Heaven-sent chance for life, I called out for Bishop to come to
me; I struck at the iron bars until my hands were bathed in blood.</p>

<p>At length Bishop arrived, in a rage, demanding to know if I had
lost my senses to create such an uproar when his Excellency, Governor
Gage, had come to inspect the prison.</p>

<p>In vain I insisted that he take my message; he laughed an ugly
laugh and refused. Mrs. Bishop, whose infant was now very sick,
came out, wrapped in her shawl, carrying the baby to the prison
hospital for treatment, and a wrangle began between her and Bishop
concerning supper.</p>

<p>My words were lost or ignored; Bishop demanded his supper at
once, and his wife insisted that she must take the child to the
hospital. The precious moments flew while they stood there under
my grating, disputing and abusing each other, while the sick child
wailed ceaselessly and dug its puny fingers into the sores on
its head.</p>

<p>Presently a keeper passed, saying that the Governor wished to
know what such indecent noise meant; and Bishop, red with rage,
turned on his wife and cursed her ferociously until she retreated
with the moaning child.</p>

<p>"Draw me a measure o' buttry ale; d'ye hear, ye slut?" he growled,
following her. "If I'm to eat no supper till you get back, I'll
want a bellyful o' malt to stay me!"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Bishop waddled on contemptuously, declaring she meant
to go to the hospital, and that he could die o' thirst for aught
she cared.</p>

<p>Dulcima, who stood in her doorway across the corridor, watched
the scene stolidly. Bishop turned on her with an oath, and ordered
her to draw his evening cup; she unhooked the tankard which hung
under the lanthorn, hesitated, and looked straight at her father.
He gave her a brutal shove, demanding to know why she dawdled
while he thirsted, and the girl moved off sullenly, with flaming
cheeks and eyes averted.</p>

<p>When she returned from the buttry I saw the warden take the frothing
tankard, brush the foam away with his forefinger, and drain the
measure to the dregs.</p>

<p>He handed the empty tankard to his daughter, smacking his lips
with a wry face, and drawing the back of his hand across his chin.
Then he became angry again.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" he muttered; "the ale's spoiled! What's in it, you baggage?"
he demanded, suddenly swinging around on his daughter. "Draw me
a cider cup to wash this cursed brew out o' me!"</p>

<p>There was a crash. The girl had dropped the tankard at her feet.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash Bishop raised his hand and dealt his daughter
a blow on the neck that sent her to her knees.</p>

<p>"Break another pot and I'll break your head, you drab!" he roared.
"Get up or I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>He choked, gasped, lifted his shaking hand to his mouth, and
wiped it.</p>

<p>"Curse that ale!" he stammered; "it's sickened me to the bones!
What in God's name is in that brew?"</p>

<p>He turned and pushed open his door, lurching forward across the
threshold with dragging feet. A moment later Dulcima passed my
cell, her trembling hands over her eyes.</p>

<p>I went to my cot and lay down, face buried, teeth set in my lip.
A numbness which at moments dulled the throbbing of my brain seemed
to settle like chains on every limb.</p>

<p>Dully I waited for the strokes of the iron bell sounding the
seventh hour; a lassitude crept over me&mdash;almost a stupor. It was
not despair; I had long passed that; it was Hope, slowly dying
within my body.</p>

<p>A few moments afterwards a strange movement inside my cell aroused
me, and I opened my hot eyes.</p>

<p>In the dusk I saw the figure of a man seated beside my cot; peering
closer, I perceived his eyes were fixed steadily on me. I sat
up on my bed and asked him what he desired.</p>

<p>He did not answer. A ray of candle-light stealing through the
barred window fell on the bright barrel of a pistol which lay
across his knees.</p>

<p>"What do you wish?" I repeated, the truth dawning on me. "Can
you not watch me from the corridor as well as in my cell?"</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>Then at last I understood that this gray shape brooding there
at my bedside was a guard of the death-watch, pledged never to
leave me, never to take his eyes from me for an instant until
the warden of the prison delivered me into the hands of the sheriff
on the morrow for my execution.</p>

<p>Ding-dong! Ding-dong! The prison bell was at last striking the
seventh hour. I lay still in my blanket, counting the strokes
which rang out in thin, peevish monotony, like the cracked voice
of a beldame repeating her petty woes.</p>

<p>At the last jangle, and while the corridor still hummed with
the thin reverberations, I rose and began to pace my narrow cell,
head bent on my breast, but keeping my eyes steadily on the grating.</p>

<p>The guard of the death-watch observed me sullenly. I drank from
my pot of water, bathed my feverish face, and walked to the grating.</p>

<p>The lanthorn above Bishop's doorway burned brightly; the corridor
was quiet. No sound came from Mount's cell. I could hear rain
drumming on a roof somewhere, that was all.</p>

<p>Bishop was due at seven o'clock to inspect our bolts and bars;
he had always arrived punctually. I watched his door. Presently
it occurred to me that I had not seen Bishop since six o'clock
when he had gone into his room, cursing the ale which his daughter
had fetched him. This was unusual; he had never before failed
to sit there on his threshold after supper, smoking his long clay
pipe, and blinking contentedly at our steel bolts.</p>

<p>Minute after minute passed; behind me I heard my guard beating
a slight tattoo with his heavy boots on the stones.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as I stood at my grating, I saw Dulcima Bishop step
from the warden's door, close it behind her, and noiselessly lock
it on the outside. The light of the lanthorn fell full on her
face; it was ghastly. The girl stood a moment, swaying, one hand
on the door; then she made a signal towards Mount's cell; and
the next instant I saw Jack Mount bound noiselessly into the corridor.
He caught sight of me, held up a reddened, dripping knife, pointed
to my cell door, and displayed a key.</p>

<p>Instantly I turned around and sauntered away from the grating
towards my tumbled bed. As I passed the death-watch, he rose and
walked over to the outer window where my pot of water stood to
cool.</p>

<p>Eying me cautiously he lifted the jug and drank, then set the
pot back and silently resumed his seat, laying his pistol across
his knees.</p>

<p>How was I to get at him? If Mount made the slightest noise in
the corridor, the guard was certain to go to the grating.</p>

<p>Pretending to be occupied in smoothing out my tumbled bedding,
I strove to move so that I might get partly behind him, but the
fellow's suspicions seemed to be aroused, for he turned his head
as I moved, and watched me steadily.</p>

<p>To spring on him meant to draw his fire, and a shot would be
our undoing. But whatever I did must be done now; I understood
that.</p>

<p>As I hesitated there, holding the blanket in my hands as though
I meant to fling it on the bed again, the lamp in the corridor
suddenly went out, plunging my cell in darkness.</p>

<p>The guard sprang to his feet; I fairly flung my body at him,
landing on him in a single bound, and hurling him to the stone
floor.</p>

<p>Instantly the light of the lanthorn flooded my cell again; I
heard my iron door opening; I crouched in fury on the struggling
man under me, whose head and arms I held crushed under the thick
blanket. Then came a long, silent struggle, but at last I tore
the heavy pistol from his clutch, beat him on the head with the
steel butt of it until, through the blanket over his face, red,
wet stains spread, and his straining chest and limbs relaxed.</p>

<p>Pistol in hand, I rose from the lifeless heap on the floor, and
turned to find my cell door swinging wide, and Dulcima Bishop
watching me, with dilated eyes.</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" she asked, and broke out in an odd laugh which
stretched her lips tight over her teeth. "Best end him now if
he still lives," she added, with a sob; "death is afoot this night,
and I have done my part, God wot!"</p>

<p>I struck the man again&mdash;it sickened me to do it. He did not quiver.</p>

<p>She lifted the lanthorn from the floor and motioned me to follow.
At the end of the corridor Mount stood, wiping his reeking knife
on the soft soles of his moccasins.</p>

<p>"The trail's clear," he whispered, gayly; "now, lass, where is
the scullions' stairway? Blow out that light, Cardigan! Quiet,
now&mdash;quiet as a fox in the barn! Give me your hand, lass&mdash;and
t'other to the lad."</p>

<p>The girl caught me by the arm and blew out the light, then she
drew me into what seemed to be an impenetrable wall of darkness.
Groping forward, I almost fell down a steep flight of stone steps
which appeared to lead into the bowels of the earth. Down, down,
then through a passage, Mount leading, the girl fairly dragging
me off my feet in her excitement, and presently a wooden door
creaked open, and a deluge of icy water dashed over me.</p>

<p>It was rain; I was standing outside the prison, ankle-deep in
mud, the free wind blowing, the sleet driving full in my eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is good, this is good!" muttered Mount, in ecstasy,
spreading out his arms as though to take the world to his sick
heart once more. "Smell the air, lad! Do you smell it? God! How
sweet is this wind in my throat!"</p>

<p>The girl shivered; her damp, dishevelled hair blew in her face.
She laid one shaking hand on Mount's wet sleeve, then the other,
and bowed her head on them, sobbing convulsively.</p>

<p>Mount bent and kissed her.</p>

<p>"I swear I will use you kindly, child," he said, soberly. "Come,
lass, gay! gay! What care we for a brace o' dead turnkeys? Lord,
how the world will laugh at Billy Bishop when they hear I stole
his girl, along with the prison keys! Laugh with me, lass! I mean
honestly and kindly by you; I'm fit for a rope at the gibbet's
top if I use you ill!"</p>

<p>"Would&mdash;would you truly wed me?" she stammered, raising her white
face to his.</p>

<p>He swore roundly that he would wed her and end his days in serving
her on his marrow-bones for gratitude.</p>

<p>And, as he made his vow, a startling change passed over her face;
she laughed, turned her bright, feverish eyes on us with a reckless
toss of her head, and drew the poison-flask from her bosom.</p>

<p>"You think," she said, "that we no longer need this little friend
to sorrow? You are wrong!"</p>

<p>And, ere Mount or I could move, she raised the tiny flask betwixt
forefinger and thumb, and dropped the dark scarlet contents between
her teeth.</p>

<p>"I drink to your freedom, Jack," she said, blindly, reeling into
Mount's arms. "Your&mdash;freedom &mdash;Jack," she gasped, smiling;
"my father drank to it&mdash;in ale. He lies dead on the floor of it.
All this&mdash;for&mdash;for your freedom, Jack!"</p>

<p>Mount was kneeling in the mud; she lay in his arms, the sleet
pattering on her upturned face.</p>

<p>"For your freedom," she murmured, drowsily&mdash;"a maid must burn
in hell for that. I burn, I burn! Oh, the fire in me, Jack!"</p>

<p>Her body writhed and twisted; her great bright eyes never left
his. Presently she lay still. A moment later the prison bell broke
out wildly through the storm, and a gunshot rang from the north
guard-house.</p>

<p>We placed the dead child under a tree in the new grass, and covered
her face with willow branches, all silky with the young buds of
April. Then, bending almost double, we ran south along the prison
wall, turning west as the wall turned, and presently came to the
wooden fence of King's Chapel.</p>

<p>Mount gained the top of the fence from my shoulders, and drew
me up. Then we dropped.</p>

<p>There were lights moving in Governor's Alley and the mews; through
the sleet great snow-flakes whirled into the slush of the filthy
street. The prison bell rang frantically behind us.</p>

<p>"It's the alarm, Jack!" I whispered.</p>

<p>He gave me a dull look, then shivered in his wet buckskins.</p>

<p>"She can't lie out there in the sleet," he muttered, blood-shot
eyes roving restlessly in the darkness. "I am going back!"</p>

<p>"For God's sake, don't do that!" I begged; but he cursed me and
brushed me aside.</p>

<p>Back over the wall he dropped. I started to follow, but he shoved
me roughly and bade me mind my own concerns.</p>

<p>I leaned against the foot of the wall; the sleet pelted me; I
bared my throat to it. After a while I heard Mount's labouring
breath on the other side of the wall, and I climbed up to aid
him.</p>

<p>He held the dead child in his arms; I took the body from him;
he climbed over, and received it again, bearing it as though it
were but a snow-flake's weight in his great arms.</p>

<p>"Go you and find a pick and spade in the mews, yonder," he said.
There was a fixed stare in his eyes that alarmed me. "Damn you,"
he said, "it is the least we can do!"</p>

<p>"Jack," I said, "we cannot stay here to be taken again! You cannot
bury her now; the ground is frosted; people will hear us!"</p>

<p>He glared at me, then swung his heavy head right and left. The
next moment he started running through the storm, cradling the
burden in his arms. I followed, not knowing what he meant to do.</p>

<p>At the King's Chapel gate he turned in along a dim gravel path,
hedged with dripping box. Around us lay the headstones of the
dead, with here and there a heavy tomb looming up in the storm
around us.</p>

<p>For a moment he halted, peering about him. A square white sepulchre
surmounted a mound on his right; he motioned me to hold the dead
child and stepped forward, laying his hands on the slab. Then,
with a heave of his powerful back, he lifted the huge stone, laying
open the shadowy sepulchre below.</p>

<p>Again he took the dead in his arms, wiped the rain-drops from
the face, laid the limp form in the sepulchre, and smoothed the
clothing. Together we replaced the slab; it taxed all my strength
to lift one end of it. The bell of the prison clanged frantically.</p>

<p>Mount stood back, breathing heavily, hands hanging. I waited
in silence.</p>

<p>"What a little thing she was!" he muttered; "what a child&mdash;to&mdash;do&mdash;that!
Do you think she will lie easy there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said.</p>

<p>At the sound of my voice Mount roused and turned sharply to me.</p>

<p>"The thief and the thief-taker's daughter!" he whispered, with
a ghastly laugh. "They'll make a book of it &mdash;I warrant you!&mdash;and
hawk it for a penny in Boston town!"</p>

<p>He touched the slab, all glistening with sleet, gripped the edge
of the sepulchre, turned, and shook his fist at the prison. Then,
quietly passing his arm through mine, he led the way out of the
chapel yard, guiding me between the soaking hedges to the iron
gate, and so out into the black alley.</p>

<p>Almost immediately a man shouted: "Stop thief! Turn out the guard!"
and a soldier, in the shadow of the wall, fired at us.</p>

<p>Mount glared at him stupidly, hands dangling; the soldier ran
up to him and presented his bayonet, calling on us to give up.</p>

<p>The sound of his voice appeared to rouse Mount to fury; he seized
the musket, wrenched it from the soldier, and beat him into the
mud. Then swinging the weapon by the barrel, he knocked down two
bailiffs who were closing in on us, and started after another,
with a yell of rage.</p>

<p>"Jack! Jack!" I cried. "Are you mad? Follow me; quick! We can't
stay here, you great fool!"</p>

<p>He heard me, halted, hurled the musket after his flying foe,
and broke out into a harsh laugh.</p>

<p>"Come on, lad," he said. "I did but mean to warm my blood and
purge it of the prison rust. Truly I think we must make for the
purlieus till they lose our trail!"</p>

<p>Through reeking lanes, foul alleys, and muddy mews where gaunt
dogs battled over scraps with gaunter children, we ran, or lurked
to listen, shunning the bleared lanthorn-light, shining through
the storm.</p>

<p>At times the horror of that flight even now appalls me&mdash;that
flight through the starving town o' Boston, where old women mouthed
at us with their scurvy-cankered gums; where, slinking along dead
walls, we stumbled over old men patiently picking with skinny
fingers in the rotted herbage for roots to stay their starved
stomachs' craving; where, in doorways, naked children, with bellies
bloated by famine, stared at us out of hollow eyes.</p>

<p>The town appeared to be alive with British soldiery; mounted
pickets roved through the streets; parties of officers passed
continually; squad after squad of marines crossed our path, and
at first we thought that all this show of troops was due to us
and our escape, the hour being late for so many troops to be abroad.</p>

<p>"There's something else in the wind," muttered Mount, as we hid
in Belcher's Lane to avoid a party of dragoons; "all this pother
is never made on our account. There's deviltry a-brewing, lad.
We had best start for the 'Wild Goose.'"</p>

<p>Through the mud of Cow Lane, Flounder Mews, and Battery Marsh
we crept on, on, along back roads and shiny lanes, then, alarmed
by a galloping dragoon, we threaded the marshy alleys to the north,
from Hancock's Wharf clear around the peninsula to Back Street
and Link Alley.</p>

<p>From thence through Hog Alley and Frog Lane south towards the
Neck, only to be frightened north once more by the mad gallop
of dragoons, and so to hide in Mackerel Lane.</p>

<p>And I am minded, as I recall that night's skulking flight, of
a bandy little watchman who, at the mere sight of us, did drop
his lanthorn and make off, bawling for aid, until Jack came up
with him and fetched him a clip which knocked him and his noisy
rattle into the mud of Mackerel Lane.</p>

<p>We fled as though all Boston ran snapping at our shin-bones,
and at last we turned, unmolested, into Green Lane, and so came
in sight of the "Wild Goose Tavern." Then, as we dropped into
a breathless trot and began to plod across Chambers Street, a
man, standing in the shadow of a tree, started forward as we came
up.</p>

<p>Mount halted and drew his knife, snarling like a jaded wolf.</p>

<p>"Mount! Cardigan!" cried the man.</p>

<p>"Paul!" exclaimed Mount, eagerly.</p>

<p>The goldsmith wrung our hands with a grip of iron.</p>

<p>"It is the beginning of the end," he said. "The Grenadiers are
to march. I've a horse on the Charlestown shore. Gage has closed
the gates on the Neck."</p>

<p>"What do the Grenadiers want?" asked Mount, all on fire again,
fagged and exhausted as he was.</p>

<p>"They want the cannon and stores at Concord," replied Revere,
in a low, eager voice. "I'm waiting for Clay Rolfe. If the Grenadiers
march by land, Rolfe hangs a lamp in the steeple of the Old North;
if they take boats, he hangs two lamps. I guess they mean to cross
the bay. The boats have been moored under the sterns of the war-ships
for a week. I've a good horse across the water; I'll have the
country-folk out by daylight if the troops stir an inch to-night.
Wait; there's Rolfe now!"</p>

<p>A dark cloaked figure came swiftly out of the mews, swinging
two unlighted lanthorns. It was Clay Rolfe, our landlord at the
"Wild Goose," and he grasped our hands warmly, laughing in his
excitement.</p>

<p>"Your boatman is ready under Hunt's Wharf, Paul," he said. "You
had best row across the bay while the rain lasts. It will clear
before midnight, and the <em>Somerset</em> is moored close to
the <em>Lively</em> to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Revere, "I've no mind to run the fleet yonder under
a full moon." And he offered his hand to us, one after another,
giving our hands a terrific squeeze.</p>

<p>"Don't forget, Rolfe," he said&mdash;"one if by land; two if by sea!"</p>

<p>Rolfe turned to us.</p>

<p>"Gage has officers watching every road outside of Boston; but
Paul will teach them how fast news can travel." He glanced at
the sky; rain fell heavily. "It won't last," he muttered; "there'll
be a moon to-night; Paul, you had best row across now. The oars
are muffled."</p>

<p>They saluted us and walked rapidly down Green Lane, wrapped to
the eyes in their riding-cloaks.</p>

<p>"If Shemuel is at the 'Wild Goose,'" I said, "perhaps he has
news for me."</p>

<p>We entered the inn and found it deserted by all save a servant,
who recognized us and bade us welcome.</p>

<p>"The Grenadiers are out to-night, sir," he said to me. "All our
company has gone to join the Alarm Men at Lexington and Concord.
There is not a soul here, sir, except me."</p>

<p>"Where is Shemuel?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He is watching the Province House, sir; General Gage entertains
to-night. It is all a ruse to quiet suspicion, sir. But we know
what is on foot, Mr. Cardigan!"</p>

<p>Mount had dropped into a chair; the rain dripped from the red
thrums of his buckskins; his fox-skin cap was soaked. There was
blood on his hands; the servant brought a basin and towel.</p>

<p>"God knows what will happen at Concord," he said; "Mr. Hancock
has gone there; Mr. Revere is to ride through Middlesex to raise
the farmers. Have you seen the dragoons, sir? They do be riding
and capering about town, stopping all mounted travellers. They
stopped the Providence coach an hour since, and there was a fight
with the towns-people in Beacon Street. The tents of the marines
are down on the Mall; some say the storm tore them down."</p>

<p>So gossiping, the lad served us with bread, cheese, pickled beef,
and a noggin of punch, and we listened, tearing at our food, and
gulping it like famished beasts o' the woods.</p>

<p>He brought me my clothes of buckskin, and I tore my rotten prison
rags from me&mdash;alas! the shreds of that same silver-velvet suit
which I had put on six months since, to wed with Silver Heels.</p>

<p>We stripped to the buff; the lad soused us well with steaming
water and again with water like ice.</p>

<p>Mount encased his huge frame in his spare buckskins. I once more
dressed in my forest dress, refreshed and fortified by food and
water which seemed truly to wash away the prison taint from our
skins as the hot bowl of spirits washed the stale prison cheer
from within.</p>

<p>The lad brought us our arms, and I could have shouted aloud my
joy as I belted in my knife, hatchet, and bullet-pouch, and flung
my rifle across my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Where is my horse?" I asked. "Have you looked to him, lad? By
Heaven, if aught of mischance has come to him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The great black horse Warlock, sir?" cried the lad. "He is stabled
in the mews, sir. Mr. Rolfe has had him cared for like a baby;
the head groom takes him out every day, Mr. Cardigan, and the
horse is all satin and steel springs, sir."</p>

<p>"Where is he? Get a lanthorn," I said, huskily.</p>

<p>A moment later, in the mews, I heard a shrill whinny, and the
tattoo of shod hoofs dancing.</p>

<p>"Warlock!" I cried.</p>

<p>The next instant my arms were around his neck.</p>
